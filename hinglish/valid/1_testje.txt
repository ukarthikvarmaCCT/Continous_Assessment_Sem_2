 Many insect males copulate with isolated females multiple times in their lives, and both male and female copulate repeatedly with many castes
 andey saadharantaya bahut chote hote hai
 Nevertheless, it is often possible to tell the egg which kind of insect will emerge from the egg
 bahudhaa yah baat bahut mahatv rakhti he, kyonki isse hanikaarak kiton kii hanikaarak dasha ke vishay main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the shape, form and color of eggs and the place and method of laying eggs
 andey samtal, shalkyakar, golakaar, shankvakar tathaa chaude ho sakate hai
 The upper shell of the egg is completely smooth or with a variety of markings
 andey pruthak pruthak yaa samudaayon main rakhe jate hai
 The eggs of oilseeds reside within the ovum
 jalawaasi kiton ke andey chipchipe lasadaar padaarth se dhake rahete hai
 Enlargement of the egg is found in sufficient quantity to feed the fetus, called a yoke
 andaropan vibhinn prakaar se hota he
 Eggs are laid in such places where the immediate requirements of the offspring can be fulfilled
 kuch jatiyon kii maadaaen nichi udaan udati, apane andey aniyamit reeti se giraati chali jaati hai
 The females of many moths, whose eggs eat grass or its roots, keep dropping their eggs on the grass while flying
 saadharantaya andey aise paudhon par rakhe, paudhon ke utakon main pravisht kar die jate hai jinako dimbh khate hai, jaise kuch prakaar ke tiddon main
 Some insects lay their eggs in the soil
 parashrayi jatiyon ke keet apane andon ko un poshakon ke upar yaa bheetar rakhte hai, jo unki santanon kaa poshan karte hai
 Females of different castes have different numbers of eggs
 drumayuka kii kuch jatiyon kii maadaaen sheetkaal main keval ek hi bada anda rakhti hai
 The domestic fly lays more than 2,000 eggs in its life
 dimak kii rani main anda rakhane kii shakti sabase adhik hoti he
 It can lay one egg per second and lays 10,00,000 eggs in its six to twelve years of life
 andey ke sansechan ke pashchaat parivardhan aarambh ho jaataa he
 Initially a two-legged root band or germ band is formed, which is divided into twenty eggs by transverse lines
 agle chah khand sir, parvarti teen khand vaksh or shesh khand telson ke saath milakar udar banaate hai
 In addition to the first segment and the telson, a paired embryonic component develops in each segment
 avyavon ke pratham yugma kaa sambandh dwitiya khand se rahata he or inase shringikas banati hai
 The second pair is very short and transient
 teesri, chauthi or paanchavi jodi ke avyav viksit hokar mandible, mexila or labium ban jate hai
 The three pair of components behind them are somewhat large and clear
 ye taangon ke agravarti he
 The last pair of abdominal components become sarsai, but all the remaining pairs are usually destroyed before they reach the ovum
 andey se baccha nikalnaa-bhrun jab purna reeti se viksit ho jaataa he or andey se baahar nikalne ko taiyaar hota he, tab shukti main pehle se bani hui topi ko apane anda phodne vaale kaanton se hataakar baahar nikal aata he
 Initially in some insects, the fetus swallows air and increases its expansion so much that the secretion is broken
 bachche ko baahar nikalne main uski peshiyaan sahaayta karti hai
 Growth begins only after hatching
 janm se praudhata tak keet ke aakaar main jo vruddhi hoti he vah atyadhik aashcharya janak he
 The adult insect weighs between 1,000 and 70,000 times the birth weight
 itani adhik vruddhi aise khol ke bheetar, jiskaa vistaar bad nahin saktaa, nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, breaking of the shell is very important
 yah kentul ke patan se hi sambhav he
 Chronic externality is called snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ke fatne se purv hi iske bhitaravaale adhicharm kii koshikaaye naveen bahyatvak kaa utsarjan kar detii hai
 Then some of these special types of cells, which are called snake glands, produce a fluid substance
 yah drav padaarth puraane bahyatvak ke bhitari str ko villin kar nae bahyatvak se pruthak kar detaa he, isko komal bhi bana detaa he tathaa swayan puraane or nae bahyatvak ke madhya ek maheen jhilli si ban jaati he
 At such a time, the insect grows
 kentul patan ke pashchaat keet kii akruti ko instar kehete hai
 When the insect comes out of the egg, the first instar occurs, after the first snake fall the insect is the second instar, the last instar is called the complete insect or adult insect
 adhiktar kiton main andey se jo dimbh nikalataa he uski akruti or rup vayask keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 Many insects undergo many changes until they become mature in shape and form
 is prakaar ke parivartanon ko roopantaran kehete hai
 Pests that do not convert are called conversionless
 iskaa udhaaharan leha he
 Most insects undergo metamorphosis, and such pests are called metabolites
 kiton main do prakaar ke kriyasheel apraudh paae jate hai
 These are called nymph and egg
 ninf us apraudh avasthaa ke keet ko kehete hai jo andey se nikalne par adhik unnat hota he
 The differentiation of nymph from the complete insect is that it does not develop side and external gonads
 ye sthal par rahete hai or pakshon kaa vikson bahya rup se hota he
 The growth from nymph to complete insect is gradual and does not form pupa
 is prakaar ke parivartan kaa apurna roopantaran tathaa keet samudaay ko hemimetabola kehete hai, jaise eekh kii pankhi
 The ovum is very different from that of the late stage insect
 isamen pakshon kaa koi bhi bahya chinh nahin paaya jaataa
 The ovum has to become a pupa before it becomes a complete insect

 This type of transformation is called a hyper transformation, as in cantharis
 kiton main roopantaran ke niyaman kaa do hormonon se sambandh hota he- kentul patan kaarak hormone or shishav hormone
 Derm-degeneration hormone often excretes the thoracic gland
 yah hormone keet kaa kentulapatan karata he
 In adult, the thoracic gland disappears, so the dermis also ends
 yadi ninf kii vakshiya granthi praudh main jamaa di jaae to praudh bhi kentulapatan karne lagegaa
 Infant hormones emit corpora alata
 yah hormone praudh ke lakshanon ko dabaae rakhata he or ninfon ke lakshanon ke tivrata se ubhaadne main sahaayta karata he
 The reactivity of the thoracic gland increases at the time of conversion, and the effect of its hormone is sufficient enough that infancy crushes the effect of hormones and thus conversion occurs
 nead jalawaasi or bahut kriyasheel apraudh hote hai
 Their breathing stops
 shwasan jalashvasanikaaon dwaara hota he
 These are campodyiformes, that is, the legs are well developed and the body is flat

 When the eggs hatch, their growth conditions may vary according to different species
 inaki yah dasha kuch ansh tak yoke kii maatra par, jo inaki vruddhi ke liye andey main upasthit rahata he, nirbhar rahati he
 It has often been seen that when the egg has a small amount of yoke, the ovum is more imperfect when it comes out of the egg
 dimbh chaar prakaar ke hote hai protopod dimbh par jivi kalapakshon main paae jate hai, kyonki inke andon main yoke atyalp maatra main hota he
 These eggs are almost in embryonic state

 is prakaar ke pun adhiktar shalbhon main paae jate hai
 In the coarctate pupa, the last snout of the ovum does not collapse, but this snake becomes stiff and becomes the piperium outside the pupa
 is prakaar kaa pupa gharelu makkhi main paaya jaataa he
 The insects break their shells in different ways while leaving the puparium
 chabaakar khaane vaale keet apane jambh se apane puparium ko kutar-kutar kar baahar nikalate hai
 Suckle feeding insects emit a fluid, which softens the silk of the Koya from one side and breaks down spontaneously
 kuch shalki-pakshon main kaante hote hai, jinase ve puparium main daraar banaate he
 Some bipedes have a pouch on their head, filling the air in which they press the end of the puparium
 is prakaar yah sira tut jaataa he or makkhi nikal aati he
 When coming out of the puparium, the insect first excretes its contents
 is samay iske pag sikude hote hai, phir rengkar sabase sameep yah jo bhi avlamb paa jaataa he us par isi dasha main vishram karne lagata he
 The sides also spread quickly due to the bleeding of the body in the sides and by the shrinking and spreading of muscles
 puparium se nikalne ke kuch samay pashchaat hi keet udne kaa praytn karne lagata he
 Addition of complete pests In pests with incomplete conversion, changes in the pests of complete pests are gradual and varied
 ye bahya tathaa aantarik donon hote hai
 The senses of Renif are transformed into the senses of Purnakit
 iske aakaar main vruddhi ke atirikt bahut hi thodaa anya parivartan aata he
 In insects with complete conversion, the senses and tissues of the ovum merge in varying degrees in the state of the pupa
 is vidhi ko hystolysis kehete hai
 At the same time, the senses of the adult are formed in their place
 naveen utakon kaa yah utpaadan histoginesis kehalaata he
 Both types of changes keep happening simultaneously without destroying the indisposition of senses
 vastav main purnakit kaa bananaa dimbh main hi aarambh ho jaataa he
 First of all, buds of complete pests are formed
 ye kalikas bhavishya main hone vaale keet ke un sab bhaagon kaa, jinaki isko aavashyaktaa hogi, punarniman karti hai tathaa un sab indriyon ko bhi banaati hai jo dimbh main nahin pai jaati
 Many insects continue to grow under diapause ie, growth-friendly conditions
 is bich yadi koi pratikul paristhiti aa jaati he, jaise nimna taap; to kuch samay ke liye parivardhan ruuk jaataa he, kintu paristhiti sudharte hi parivardhan turant hi phir aarambh ho jaataa he
 But there are many insects in which external conditions seem favorable
 kintu kuch nishchit paristhitiyon ke kaaran parivardhan ruuk jaataa he
 This growth spurt can range from a few weeks to several years
 vibhinn jatiyon ke kiton main yah avadhi praaia: bhinn hoti he or is prakaar parivartan main vilamb ho jaataa he
 But in the end this blockage occurs only at a certain stage of history by the organism

 Due to such life many changes take place in the legs, mouth parts and sensory senses of these insects
 aise kuch kiton ke vyavhaar main bhi spasht pavirthan drushtigochar hota he
 Some insects use their legs to catch their prey and to pause while eating
 vyaadh patang apni teenon jodi taange or jalmatkun tathaa mantid keval bagali taangon kaa hi is kaary main upyog karte hai
 This causes a change in their legs

 Parasites are pests that subsist on other organisms, but receive food from them without killing them and often depend on the same nutrient
 ye apane andey praaia: apane poshak ke sharir par dete hai
 There are two types of parasitic insects - one that survives on vertebrates and the other on insects and their relatives
 pratham varg ke keet anoplura, mellophayga or cyphonaptera ganon tathaa hippobosidi vansh ke antargat aate hai
 These parasites are very small compared to their nutrient
 poshak main inako sahane karne kii shakti viksit ho jaati he or is kaaran inkaa prabhaav prananashak nahin hota
 Most of these are excellent parasites and live on the body of the nutrient
 cyphonaptera ke atirikt anya kaa sharir upar neeche se chauras hota he or ye poshak ke sharir se chipke rahete hai
 They have hooks to hold the nutrient on their feet and the eyes become weak or fading
 pakshon kaa bhi praaia: abhaav rahata he or yadi ve hote bhi he to bahut chote hote hai
 There are only a few parasites of insects
 strepsyptus gana ke atirikt madhumakhi kii juun, breula hi keval inkaa anya udhaaharan he
 The behavior of semi-parasites is similar to that between parasitic and parasitic
 aarambh main yah paraseete kii tarah rahata he, arthath poshak kii ati aavashyak indriyon ko nasht nahin karata, kintu baad main iskaa vyavhaar apahari jaisaa ho jaataa he or yah apane poshak kaa bhakshan kar jaataa he
 It usually lays its eggs above or inside the body of the nutrient
 iske dimbh poshak se sthaayee rup se chipke rahete he or apana bhojan poshak ke sharir ke bheetar yaa baahar se praapt karte hai
 Mostly these insects are found only in the Tachinidis of the bipedal lineage and in the Parasitica class of the genus Aap
 inke praudh kriyasheel hote hai or parashrayi nahin hote
 The size of a semi-parasite is larger than the size of a nutrient and by its behavior it always destroys the nutrient
 poshak adhiktar anya keet hi hote hai, jinke andon yaa anya apraudh avasthaaon par ardhparasite kaa akraman hota he
 Adult pests are never attacked
 texnidi vansh ke keet poshak ke bheetar rahete hai, kintu andey poshak ke upar, yaa poshak se dur, rakhte hai
 Many parasites are like external parasites, but most are internal parasites and lay their eggs within the skin of the nutrient

 atelura naamak keet chitiyon ke vivaron main rahata he or jab ek cheentee duusari cheentee ko apana ulti kiya hua bhojan dene lagati he to usko pi letaa he
 There are also pests that benefit their nutrients in exchange for being with them
 kuch kanchukpaksh chitiyon ke vivaron main aashray or bhojan pate hai or iske badale main apane sharir se srav nikaal kar dete hai, jisko paane ke liye ye chitiyaan bahut lalayit rahati hai
 The last category of this relationship is that the ants actually feed the guest skeletal in exchange for secretions
 paraspar laabh pahunchaane kaa yah ek sundar udhaaharan he 
 Most insects have a habit of living alone, but insects of some castes form their own circle under the given circumstances
 sheetkaal main jab taap bahut neeche gir jaataa he, gharelu makkhiyaan praaia: ek saath ekatra ho jaati hai
 Some caterpillars are gregarious and all born bred together live together in the same webs, but such circles disperse as soon as the meal ends and each cull begins to remain independent
 bahut se keet anek paristhitiyon se vivash ho greeshmakaal bitaane, pupa banane or sheet nishkyita ke liye ekatra ho jate hai
 One of these situations is the search for a safe place

 vah keet, jo apni santanon kii kam se kam unke jivan ke aarambh main dekhbhaal karata he, saamaajik jivan kii pratham shrenee kaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Social insects of different classes have different traits, but the most important feature of each of their congregations is that there is only one family, consisting of a male, a female and their offspring, or a mating female and its offspring
 , Ie, at least two generations live together in one place
 vaastavik saamaajik jivan bara, madhumakhiyon, chitiyon or dimakon main paaya jaataa he
 
 ek anya prakaar kaa sahjivan he jisamen ek keet duusare keet ke sharir par chipka rahata he
 The insects that stick on the body are usually large, but small insects do not eat them, that is, they do not cause any harm
 miloidi vansh ke triangulin dimbh ko saamaajik kalapaksh apane sharir par apane ghonslen main le jate hai
 These eggs eat their offspring there
 silionidi vansh ke kuch paraseete, maadaa tiddon kii peeth par, baith jate hai
 The grasshoppers lay on their backs until they lay eggs

 a large number of insects live in water
 ye adhiktar mithe pani main rahete hai, kuch khaare pani or samudr main bhi paae jate hai
 Many symptoms of these pests are useful
 bahut se kalapakshon kii chikani or chamakati hui deh tairte samay pani kii rukaawat kam kar detii he
 Many insects have special means to keep them from flowing into the waterfowl, such as the black flies holding the silk threads
 machharon ke dimbhon main shwasaradhran ke chaaron ore pai janevaali grathiyon se tel mila hua srav nikalataa he
 Due to this, the external properties of these places have hydrological properties and water cannot stay there
 at: shwasan berok tok hota rahata he
 Some insects, such as Poudura aquatica, have hair that causes the extracellular hydrocephalus
 is gun ke kaaran shwasapranal main jal nahin pravesh kar paata
 They also have special means for obtaining food, for example, in the nymphs of Odineta, the veil of labium acts as a trap
 machharon ke dimbhon ke mukhon main compankaaree burush hote hai jo jal main lehren utpann karte hai or is prakaar bhojan ke sookshmakan inaki grasika main pahanch jate hai

 They respire through the trachea, reservoir, or blood reservoir
 kuch keet vaayu ko apane paas jamaa kar lete hai or jab ve jal main duube hote hai tab uskaa upyog karte hai
 The trachea system of the transparent ovum of the insect called the cortex of the biceps becomes a pair of bean-shaped pairs
 ye theliyaan utplavan indriya kaa kaary karti hai
 This ovum can change the volume of these bags by some unknown method and thus can generate relative master speed according to the depth of water
 keet saare sansar main, himachhadit dhruviya bhaagon se lekar bumadhya rekha ke pasavaale, tapate hue bhaagon tak main paae jate hai
 Their distribution is more extensive than all other terrestrial organisms
 ye lagbhag un sabhi sthanon main paae jate hai jahaan vanaspatiyaan ug sakati hai, arthath jahaan bhi inako bhojan praapt ho saktaa he
 Vegetables are the food of insects and other organisms
 paksh ek mahaan mahatvavaali rachana he
 Insects have incomparable distribution power, which is not found in other terrestrial organisms
 vitaran kii shakti kiton kii prayek jati ko teevr spardhaa se or kathor nirvachan ke prabhaav se, jiskaa parinaam parimit kshetra main atyadhik bheed hona hota he, bachane ke liye swatantraaa pradaan karti he, kintu bahut se keet aise bhi hai jinka vitaran simit he
 Oil pests, rice truncated insects, pulses pests etc
 are famous among insects found in the houses of humans all over the world
 inke atirikt aajkal chane kaa shalab, aalu k shalab, shakarkand kaa suundwala keet or bandgobhi kaa shalab, bhi saare sansar main paae jate hai
 Similarly, there are many such pests that are found only in a particular state or country
 aisa vitaran bahut si paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahata he
 Feeding and natural conditions are undoubtedly very effective conditions
 jalawaasi keet vahaan nahin rah sakate jahaan jal nahin he
 Insects living in the bark of trees cannot be found in places where there is no tree
 prakritik avrodh, jaise unche unche pahaad, samudr tathaa marusthal, kiton kaa vitaran ek desh se duusare desh main nahin hone dete
 Some insects, such as safilize, cabbage butterfly, etc
 are found only in the temperate zone
 falon kii makkhiyaan, dhan ke keet aadi keval ayanvrutt main hi milte hai
 Some insects, such as locusts and some butterflies, sometimes have a propensity to migrate and reach far-off countries
 kintu bahut se kiton ke aadhunik vitaran kii vyakhya prithvi kii aadhunik dasha or jalwaayu ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati or isliye praaia: bhouvrittiya parivartanon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 The insect called Spring Tail is found in New Zealand and Chile
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi kaal main in donon deshon ke bich atactic mahadweep failaa hua tha, kyonki yah keet itnaa komal or pakshaheen he ki iskaa anya kisi prakaar se vitaran ho hi nahin saktaa
 Spring tail has the most extensive distribution compared to other insects and due to this it has adapted itself to these different conditions
 chitiyon kaa bhi lagbhag isi prakaar vitaran he or inhone bhi apane ko vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool kar liya he
 The Bear, in 1954-55, stated that the eggs of Miriapoda who can breed in the embryo should be considered as ancestors of insects
 yah siddh karne ke liye kiton ke praudh or kuch miriapoda ke dimbhon kii, udaahranarth, aiulas kii, jo ek milipid he, tulana karne main mahatpurna hai
 When the egg of the ileus emerges from the egg, its head appears to be composed of as many segments as the head of the insect
 sharir ke shesh bhaag main lagbhag 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se pratham teen khandon main prayek par ek jodi taange hoti hai
 Fourth and the sections behind them are also without legs
 kintu inke parivardhan main rukaawat aa jaati he or ye bahut hi chote rah jate hai
 In this way, the ovum of this six-legged ileus becomes a long adult at the end, which has many segments and many legs in the body
 yadi is dimbh kii pratham teen jodi ke pashchaatwali taangon ke parivardhan main adhik rukaawat ho or dimbh ke sharir ke lagbhag 12 khand praudhavastha main drudh rahen to yah jeev keet ke aakaar kaa hoga, jisamen pratham teen jodi taangon ke pechhevali taange yaa to itani ksheen hongi ki keval unke avshesh hi honge yaa ve sarvatha lupt hongi
 It is very interesting that in fact there are pests in which even the remains of the legs are present on the abdomen, such as Campodia, Japix and Matilis
 in kiton ke paksh nahin hote or inamen ve rachanaaen vartmaan rahati hai jo anya kiton main lupt ho gai hai, jaise janangranthiyon kaa khandibhavan
 Therefore, in the development of insects, these insects should understand the mid stage condition of the eggs and other insects born in the brain of Miriapoda
 anya anek tarkon se bhi yah anumodith hota he ki miriapoda kii tarah kii akritiyon se hi kiton kii utpatti hui he
 It is highly likely that myriapoda are the ancestors of insects in all those long-bodied and tangled organisms, because they contain many of the same creations, for example, malpigian tubules and tracheal tubules
 kintu iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki kiton kii utpatti praudh miriapoda se nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki inamen bahut si visheshtaayen or vilakshantaayen hai
 The Aperigota subclass is a group of mostly diverse insects and only the Thysanurae ganas of that subclass are probably close to the main category of growth of Terrigote insects
 aisa tark dwaara siddh kiya gaya he ki aptarigota ke shesh teen ganon ko keet maananaa hi nahin chahie
 However, there does not seem to be any satisfactory reason to separate these three ganas from this subclass, although there is no doubt that they exhibit unique compositions, for example the pests of Collenbola gana have only nine segments
 protura gana ke kiton main enamorphosis hota he, diplura, gana ke kiton main alakshanik trekial tantra paaya jaataa he, diplura or colembala kii shringikaaon ke kashabh main peshiyaan hoti hai
 The subclass Terrigota is divided into two parts - exopterigota and endopterigota
 exopterigota ganon ke affimeroptera or odoneta main paraspar nikat sambandh he, kyonki ye donon hi peliapteron, gana hai
 Blatteria, Mantodia, Isoptera, Joreptra, Gyloblatodia, Rhe Jupaj, Phaseamidea, Plicoptera, Dermaptera and Ambioptera r Jupaxica orthopteraid belong to the community, if considered from the body theory of modern insects
 nimnlikhit lakshanon ke kaaran ye sab gun ek samudaay banaate hai-aparivartit mukhbhaag, pashchapaksh main vishaal anelle lob udar ke pasch sire par ek jodi sarasai, aganit mailipagian nalikaayeor pratiprishth tantric tantu main kai ek pruthak-pruthak gucchhikaayen
 Of these Ganas, Blatteria and Mantodia have a very close relationship, placing them both together under Dictyoptera
 exopterigota ke shesh gana, jinke naam hai socoptera, mellophayga, simonculeta, matkunagan or jhallaripaksh, matkunaganik samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 The characteristics of the Mtkunganik community are as follows: special types of mandibulate or sucking mouth, anel lobes not found in the posterior side, lack of sarsai
 malepigian nalikaaon kii sankhya bahut thodi hoti he or pratiprishth tantriktantu kii gucchhikaaye lagbhag ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There are no clear distinctions between the rheumatic and the mitochondrial communities, as the side veins in the Joraptera are somewhat weakened, the number of mallepigian tubules is even smaller, and the neoplasms are also slightly dilated
 socoptera or mellophayga main spasht sambandh prathit hota he, kyonki donon main vilakshan prakaar kaa hypofarics hota he
 Probably Cyphonculata is closely related to Malophaga
 inase ve keval anek bahya or aantarik rachanaaon tathaa prakruti main hi saadrishy nahin rakhte, apitu shwasaradhran kii rachana or andey se bachche nikalne kii vidhi main bhi saadrishy he
 Now the question arises as to why both lice of lice are not considered under the same gana
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki donon ganon ke mukhbhaagon main itnaa adhik antar hota he
 That it is often considered appropriate to keep them separately in different ganas
 indopterigot kiton ke vishay main dhyaan de to kalapaksh, strepciptera or kanchukpaksh ko anya ganon ke saath rakhane main atyadhik kathinata upasthit hoti he, at: inke atirikt shesh sab gana panorapid samudaay ke antargat rakhe gaye hai
 The panorepid community is centralized on the mykaptera with the laminae neuroptera and forms a few distinct microbial branches
 aisa adhik sambhav he ki micoptera ke nimnasth sadasyon se ek ore dwipaksh or duusari ore shalki paksh or lomapaksh kii utpatti hui ho
 The adults of Siphonaptera are very different in composition, but its ovum bipedal subgroups do not differ from some of the Poles of the nematosera, and if the genus Siphonaptera did not originate from the primordial bipedes, it would have at least been from the Panorapid community
 kalapaksh, kanchukpaksh or strepciptera ke vishay main bhi kuch kathinata prathit hoti he
 The subalpine of the acupuncture is conspicuous in the ovum of the symphyta and the ovum of the panorepid insects, as well as the origin of the vein on the sides of the symphyta appears to be from the megalopteran pattern, without difficulty
 in do kaarnon se aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki kalapaksh ke purvaj tathaa jaalpaksh or anya panorapid ganon ke purvaj ek hi the
 There is a view of the Kunchuk side that they originated in a different way from other Indopterigot
 kintu kuch lekhakon kaa aisa anumaan he ki kanchukpaksh kii utpatti jaalpaksheeya akritiwale purvajon se hui
 Strepsiptera are often thought to be related to the ejaculate, but some authors determine their relationship to the appendage

 tarkshastra shabd angreji 'logic' kaa anuwaad he
 No scripture with this type of name is famous in ancient Indian philosophy
 bhartiya darshan main tarkshastra kaa janm swatantra shaastra ke rup main nahin hua
 Akshpad! Gautama or Gautama's Nyasutra is the first treatise in which the problems of so-called logic are systematically considered
 ukt sutron kaa ek bada bhaag in samasyaon par vichaar karata he, phir bhi ukt granth main yah vishay darshanapaddati ke ang ke rup main nirupit hua he
 Sixteen test materials are mentioned in the judiciary
 inamen sarvapratham pramaan naam kaa vishay yaa padaarth he
 In fact, in Indian philosophy, today's logic can be replaced by 'evidence'
 kintu pramanshastra kii vishaywastu tarkshastra kii apeksha adhik vistrut he
 The Greek philosopher Aristotle is believed to have been the originator and founder of logic in Europe, as before there had been some thinking on certain logistical problems by metaphysical teachers, Socrates and Aflatoon or Plato
 yah dilachasp baat he ki swayan arestu, jisane vichaaron ke itihaas main pehali baar gyaan kaa vibhinn shakhaon main vibhaajan kiya, 'tarkshastra' naam se parichit nahin he
 He has named his objective thinking as 'analytics'
 tarkshastra ke vaachak shabd 'lajika' kaa sarvapratham prayog roman lekhak siciro main miltaa he, yadhyapi vahaan uskaa arth kuch bhinn he
 According to Aristotle, the subject of logic is contemplation, not the bearer of thought
 uske tarkshastreey granthon main mukhyatah nimna vishyon kaa pratipaadan hua he : The sentence is made up of terms
 prayek pad kuch vastuon kaa sanket karata he or kuch gunon yaa visheshtaon kaa bodhak bhi hota he
 The characteristic of the object symbol is called the 'denotation' of the term, the indicated nature of the illuminative properties is called 'connotation' in the macro form, just as the denotation of the term 'man' is 'all humans', its connotation is 'life' and 'enlightenment'
 prayek vaakya main ek uddeshy pad hota he, ek vidhey pad or unhen jodanevaala sanyojak
 The predicate terms are of several categories, some describing the purpose, some describing its external characteristics
 vidhey padon ke vargeekaran kaa arestu ke paribhaasha sambandhi vichaaron se ghanaa sambandh he
 Classification of sentences or statements are also many; That is, according to quality, quantity, relation and determinism
 sambandh ke anusaar vaakya categorical ; hetuhetumd ; or dispanctive hote hai
 According to certainty, there are three types of narrative, probabilistic and deterministic
 vaakya kaa pramukh rup 'categarical' he
 By the way, sentences are classified according to quality and magnitude
 gun or pariman ke sammilit prakaaron ke anuroop vargeekaran dwaara chaar tarah ke vaakya uplabdh hote hai, jinhe roman aksharon - e, i, ai, o dwaara sanketit kiya jaataa he
 The nouns a and e are the positive servative legislative and negation sentences, such as 'all man is perfect' and 'no man is perfect'; Some related legislative and prohibitive sentences are called i and o respectively; For example - 'some humans are educated' and 'some humans are not educated'
 ' The main prophetic theme of Aristotle's logic is the inference expressed in the judgments; There are 19 types of correct estimates which are published in four types of components
 chaar prakaar ke nyaay vaakya avyavsanhatiyaan 'figures' kehalaati hai or unamem paae janevaale sahi anumaanroop 'mood' kahe jate hai
 These 'moods' can be changed from second 'figures' to forms of first 'figure'
 pratham 'figure' sabase purna 'figure' maani jaati he
 In Indian philosophy, as stated above, the thing that has developed is the philosophy; The so-called logic is only a part of it
 gautam ke 'nyayasutra' main prama yaa yatharth gyaan ke utpaadak vishisht yaa pradhan kaaran 'pramaan' kehalaate hai; unki sankhya chaar he, arthath pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd
 According to the Bhat Mimansakas and Vedantis, the evidence is six, that is, the appropriate four and the economy and unavailability
 bhartiya gyaan mimasaa main ukt pramaanon ko lekar bahut chintan or vivaad hua he
 The analysis of the Darsha done by Buddhists, Naiyayikas, Vedantis etc
 is particularly influenced by their respective metaphysical views
 nyaay ke anusaar anumaan do prakaar kaa hota he, pararthanumaan tathaa swaarthanumaan
 The prescriptive judgment of inference consists of five sentences called pledge, for, example, subrogation and incorporation, respectively
 vedantiyon ke anusaar in paanchon main se shuru yaa baad ke teen vaakya anumaan ke liye paryaapt he
 In the opinion of Buddhist logician Dharmakirti, there is a reason for guessing, ie, gender or having three characteristics
 ye teen visheshtaayen hai- anumey yaa paksh main nishchit upasthiti; sapaksh main hi upasthiti ; or asapaksh yaa vipaksh main nishchit anupasthiti 
 Here is the mountain side, where fire is estimated by the presence of dhoom; The kitchen is spacious, where the presence of dhoom is known with uncertain presence, where the absence of dhoom with fire is certain
 aage ham 'tarkshastra' shabd kaa prayog uske sankeern, aadhunik arth main karenge
 What would be the definition of logic within the scope of this meaning? In John Stuart Mill's opinion, the subject of logic is permissions, not empirical truth
 tarkshastra vishwaason kaa vigyaan nahin he, vah upapatti athwa sakshya kaa vigyaan nahin he
 The field of logic is that part of our knowledge, whose form is 'allowed by pre-known truths'
 tarkshastra kaa kaary kisi satya kaa sakshya jutanaa nahin he, vah yah aankane kaa praytn he ki kisi anumiti ke liye uchit sakshya prastut kiya gaya he yaa nahin
 In short, the work of logic is an exploration of the basis of correct permission
 tarkshastra kaa gyaan hamamen yah dekhne or aankane kii kshamta utpann karata he ki kisi satya kaa sakshya jutanaa nahin he, vah yah aankane kaa praytn he ki kisi anumiti ke nishchayatmak aadhaaron kaa gyaapan hi he, arthath uskaa vishay nishchayatmak anumitiyon or aadharbhoot sakshya ke sambandhon ko spasht karnaa athwa un niyamon ko prakaash main laana he jo sahi anumaan prakriya ko niyantrit karte hai
 So it is sometimes said that logic is a regulatory science or science whose function is to stabilize ideal forms of permissiveness or logic
 iske vipareet bhautikee yaa bhautikashastra, arthshaastra, samajashaastra aadi yatharthanveshi vigyaan he, jo vastusatta ke yatharth yaa vaastavik roopon yaa niyamon kaa anveshan karte hai
 This classification of sciences is somewhat misleading
 tarkshastra yaa achaarshastra niamak shaastra he, is kathan kaa yah arth lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ukt shaastra kritrim dhang se kshetravishesh main maanav vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa nirdesh karte hai maano sahi chintan evam sahi naitik vyavhaar ke niyam maanav prakruti ke nijee niyam na hokar usapar baahar se laade janevaale niyam hai
 But this is not the case
 vastutah tarkshastra un niyamon ko, jo sahi chintan prakaaron main swatah, swabhaavatah otprot samajhe jate hai, prakat rup main nirdeshit karne kaa upkaran maatr he
 Thoughtful humans automatically distinguish between innocent and innocent arguments - types of thinking, right and wrong
 kintu is prakaar kaa antar karte hue ve kinhin niamak aadarshon yaa kanoonon kii avgati yaa chetana kaa parichay nahin dete
 It is the work of logic to analyze the types of reasoning considered to be right and bring the rules in them to the level of conscious information
 isi prakaar achaarshastra bhi hamen un niyamon yaa aadarsho kii jaankaree detaa he, jo hamaare bhale bure ke nirnyon main, anjaane rup main, parivyapt rahete hai
 That is why it is said that the specific ethics, or ethics and moral education of a society, illuminates the moral biases of that society
 isi arth main deshavishesh, kalvishesh athwa samajavishesh ke naitik vichaarak apane desh, yug athwa samaaj ke pratinidhi chintak hote hai
 The above belief in relation to logic leads to an important conclusion
 yadi kinhin kaarnon se manushya kii chintanapranali athwa tarkpranali main parivartan yaa vikaas ho, to uske anuroop tarkshastreey mantavyon main bhi parivartan yaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 It also happens in the history of logic that in the long run it becomes necessary to amend the old norms or rules of thinking; Along with the creation of new thinking types, the representation of new logical rules can also be expected
 europe main jab bhautik vigyaan kii pragati shuru hui, to vahaan kramshah arestu kii nigamanpranali kii aalochana or usase bhinn aagmanpranali kii pariklpana or prashansa bhi hone lagi
 Lord Bacon did this work in European ideological history
 baad main, vaigyanik anveshan pranali kaa adhik vishleshan ho chukne par, europe ke tarkshastriyon ne nigamanmoolak vichaarpaddati evam pariklpana nigamanpranali jaisi avadharanaon kaa vikaas kiya
 Inductive logics consider rules that make it possible to make or represent general statements based on observed events or trades
 saamaanya kathan praayah vyaptivakyon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There has been considerable scrutiny in Indian scripture about the question of how coverage is achieved
 'jahaan-jahaan dhooma hota he, vahaan agni hoti he' - yah vyaptivakya he
 Apparently our observation shows only a few examples of the association of Dhoom and Agni
 prashn he, kuch sthitiyon main nirikshit do chizon ke saahchary se ham unke sarvadeshik or saarvkalik saahchary kii kalpana ke auchity ko kaise siddh kar sakate he? is samasya ko tarkshastra main aagamanaatmak pluti kii samasya kehete hai
 The hypothesis incorporation system presents a solution to the question of normative statements or general concepts without getting confused
 sankshep main aadhunik vaigyanik anveshan kii pranali yah he : Above we emphasized that with the development of new logic systems, there is also a change in the form of logical principles
 is drushti se tarkshastra ek gatisheel vidya he; vah sthir, shaashvat niyamon kaa sankalan yaa ullekh maatr nahin hai
 In fact, the development of various physical, biological and sociological scientists has influenced logic
 anumaan or tarkna kii pranaaliyon tathaa niyamon se adhik aaj vibhinn vidyaon kii anveshna prakriya anushilan kaa vishisht vishay ban gai he
 The classical investigation of the above process is called ritualism
 yahan ek zyada mahatv kaa spashtikaran apekshit he
 Our reasoning process is not of the same order in different areas of experience and thinking
 vigyaan or ganit main tarkna ke tareeke ek prakaar ke hai
 These methods also vary greatly in the field of literature review or ethical decisions
 duusare shabdon main ham kah sakate he ki kala samiksha, sahitya mimasaa, nitishastra aadi ke kshetro main pareekshakon ke swamtasthaapan evam paramatkhandan kii pranaliyaan ek hi si nahin hotin
 They can also vary greatly
 is sthiti ko nimnaankit shabdon main bhi prakat kiya jaataa he: In the twentieth century, there is a development of symbolic or symbolic logic different from the traditional Aristotle logic
 kuch pareekshakon kii drushti main yah ek badi ghatana he
 This new logic is also called mathematical logic
 unnisvin sadi ke madhya main do angrej ganitajnon ne tarkshastra ke is naye rup kaa aadhaar khadaa kiya; ye do ganitagya the - augustus di margan tathaa george bul
 His main exploration was that the permissions mentioned in Aristotle's logic have far more authentic permissions
 arestu ke nyaay-vaakya main prakat kii jane anumitiyon kaa aadhaar siddhant vargsmavesh kaa niyam hai
 By the way, the famous example of conjecture is: all human beings are mortal; Socrates is a human here; So Socrates is deathly here, deathliness is the widespread religion of the class called Man; It is also the religion of Socrates incorporated into that class
 margan or bul ne yah pataa chalaaya ki anumiti kaa asli aadhaar vishesh koti ke sambandh hote he, varg samavesh kaa niyam in kai sambandhken main se ek ke antarbhoot he
 Therefore, that rule should not be considered an independent principle of permissibility
 duusare, aisi anek anumitiyaan hoti hai, jo nyayavakya ke rup main prakat nahin kii ja sakati
 Example: 'the state of a is more than b and the state of b is more than C, hence the state of a is more than C
 ' prasiddh darshanik eff0 ech0 breadle ne bhi aisi anumitiyon kaa sanket kiya he, jo arestu ke nyaayavakya main niveshit nahin ho saktin
 It has been said above that according to the new thinkers the basis of permissiveness is some relationship between the sentences
 swayan 'sambandh' kii avadharana ko paribhaashit karnaa kathin he
 Relationships are classified in many ways
 kuch sambandh do padon yaa padaartho me bich hote hai, kuch teen ke, ityadi
 a substance is related if it is necessary to mention another substance while making some statement about it
 'ram sita kaa pati he', 'raja ne apane shatru ko jehar de diya', 'devdatt ne vishnudutt se das hajaar rupye lekar makaan kharid liya;' - ye vaakya kramshah dwimulak, trimulak evam chaturmulak sambandhon ko prakat karte hai
 According to another classification, there are three types of relationships, even, odd, and non-odd
 jo sambandh karte he; yatha - ram shyaam kaa bhai he; devdatt vishnudutt kaa hamaumr he yaa sahpaathee he; ityadi
 Odd relationship Ram is the husband of Sita
 a-sam visham- devdatt vishnudutt ko pyaar karata he
 One type of relationship is called a spurious relationship; Different than that 'avasthaa main bada hona' ye sab utplavi sambandh hai
 If k is larger than K, or taller or heavier than K, and b k then it proves that k is taller or heavier than C
 anutplavi sambandh- k kha kaa pita he or kha ga kaa; yahan yah siddh nahin hota ki k ga kaa pita he
 Where we see that the originating relationship is allowed for permission
 arastu dwaara pratipaadit varg samavesh kaa siddhant vastutah utplavi sambandh kaa doosraa udhaaharan akshep sambandh he
 If the sentence y dedicates the sentence r, and the sentence sentences l, then y represents the l
 pratikanishtha tarkshastra kii ek anya visheshta yah he ki vahaan vaakyon or unke sambandhon ko pratikon ke dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Permutation has specific relation to base sentences; These relationships depend on the size of the sentences, not their meanings
 faltah vaakyon ke arthon kaa vichaar kiye bina, unke aakaaron main anusyut sambandhon ko or unpar aadhaarit anumitiyon ko, pratikon kii bhashaa main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 Various relations can be briefly revealed when symbolized
 yah prakriya ganit kii shlaghneey visheshta he
 The invention of writing numbers with decimal methods was a key to the advancement of mathematics, it was invented in India
 ankon ko likhane kii roman pranali main das, pachaas sau aadi sankhyaon ke liye alag-alag sanketachinh he; iske vipareet prachlit dashamalav pranali main ankavishesh kaa mulya uski sthiti ke anusaar hota he or sif nau ankon tathaa shunya-chihn, kii madad se kisi bhi sankhya ko prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 In symbolic logic, the rules of permissions related to classes, sentences, etc
, have been presented in symbols
 vargkalan main virgon ke parsparik sambandhon, virodh aadi ke niyam batalaaye gaye hai
 Similarly, rules of syntax, opposition etc
 have been stated
 isi prakaar vaakyakalan main vaakyasambandhon ke niamak siddhaton yaa niyamon kaa ullekh rahata he
 The principle embodied in Aristotle's jurisprudence is one of the said rules
 isse prakat he ki pratikanishtha tarkshastra kaa anumitikshetra arestu ke tarkshastra kii apeksha kahin adhik vistrut he

 kathgodam-ranibagh continued to exist as an independent city until 1942, after which it was combined with Haldwani Notified Area to form the Nagar Palika Parishad haldwani-kathgodam
 21 may 2011 ko haldwani-kathgodam ko nagar palika parishad se nagar nigam ghoshit kiya gaya, or phir iske vistaar ko dekhte hue iskaa naam badalakar nagar nigam haldwani kar diya gaya
 Three kilometers from Kathgodam heading towards Nainital is a very delightful site called Ranibagh

 There is a confluence of two small rivers named Pushpabhadra and Gagaranchal near Ranibagh

 As soon as the queen reached the river Gaula to take a bath, the army of Ruhels surrounded her
 rani jiya shiv bhakt or sati mahila thi
 He remembered his isht and got buried in the stones of the river Gaula
 ruhelon ne unhen bahut dhunda parantu ve kahin nahin mili
 It is said that he hid himself in his gaghera
 ve us ghaghare ke aakaar main hi shila ban gai thim
 Even today, on the banks of river Gaula, there is such a rock, which is similar in size to the Kumaoni Ghaghre
 us shila par rang-birange pathar aise lagate hai, maano kisi ne rangeen ghaghara bicha diya ho
 That colorful rock is believed to be the memento of Jia Rani
 rani jiya ko yah sthaan bahut pyaara tha
 It was here that he planted his garden and here he also breathed his last
 vah sadaa ke liye chali gai parantu usne apane gaat par ruhelon kaa haath nahin lagane diya tha
 Since then, this place is known as Ranibagh in the memory of that queen

 Tourists who are not able to live in the cool air of Nainital, enjoy the mountainous climate by staying in Jyolikot

 Geoliquot is famous for fruits, but this place also has the distinction of being the center of various kinds of birds

 From this journey, he brought three million pages of atomic pictures, manuscripts and patrols with him
 pehali baar koi bhartiya mongolia se bharat-anupranit sahitya or kala-nidhiyaan lekar aayaa tha
 As soon as the rise of independence, Acharyaji was looking for the first opportunity to re-establish relations with the cultural countries of India
 acharya ji kaa mongolon main janaa kya tha, ve to anand-vibhor ho uthe ki kai shadiyon ke uparant bharat ke acharya ke charan unki bhoomi paavan kar rahe hai
 In January 1956, when Acharya went on a visit to the Soviet Union, Siberia and the Mongol Republic, there was cold to freeze the body

 The first trine consists of the Rat, Dragon and Monkey
 These three signs are said to be intense and powerful individuals capable of great good, who make great leaders but are rather unpredictable
 The three are said to be intelligent, magnanimous, charismatic, charming, authoritative, confident, eloquent and artistic, but can be manipulative, jealous, selfish, aggressive, vindictive or deceitful
 The second trine consists of the Ox, Snake and Rooster
 These three signs are said to possess endurance and application, with slow accumulation of energy, meticulous at planning but tending to hold fixed opinions
 The three are said to be hard-working, modest, industrious, loyal, philosophical, patient, good-hearted and morally upright, but can also be self-righteous, egotistical, vain, judgmental, narrow-minded or petty
 The third trine consists of the Tiger, Horse and Dog
 These three signs are said to seek true love, to pursue humanitarian causes, to be idealistic and independent but tending to be impulsive
 The three are said to be productive, enthusiastic, independent, engaging, dynamic, honourable, loyal and protective, but can also be rash, rebellious, quarrelsome, anxious, disagreeable or stubborn
 The fourth trine consists of the Rabbit, Goat and Pig
 These three signs are said to have a calm nature and an intellectual approach; they seek aesthetic beauty and are artistic, well-mannered and compassionate, yet detached and resigned to their condition
 The three are said to be caring, self-sacrificing, obliging, sensible, creative, empathetic, tactful and prudent, but can also be naïve, pedantic, insecure, cunning, indecisive or pessimistic
 There are many stories and fables to explain the beginning of the zodiac
 Since the Han Dynasty, the 12 Earthly Branches have been used to record the time of day
 However, for the sake of entertainment and convenience, they have been replaced by the 12 animals
 The 24 hours are divided into 12 periods, and a mnemonic refers to the behavior of the animals: a Branch may refer to a double-hour period
 In the latter case it is the center of the period; for instance, 马 means noon or a period from 11am to 1pm
 An ancient folk story tells that Cat and Rat were the worst swimmers in the animal kingdom
 Although they were poor swimmers, they were both quite intelligent
 To get to the meeting called by the Jade Emperor, they had to cross a river to reach the meeting place
 The Jade Emperor had also decreed that the years on the calendar would be named for each animal in the order they arrived to the meeting
 Cat and Rat decided that the best and fastest way to cross the river was to hop on the back of Ox
 Ox, being naïve and good-natured, agreed to carry them both across
 Midway across the river, Rat pushed Cat into the water
 Then as Ox neared the other side of the river, Rat jumped ahead and reached the shore first
 So he claimed first place in the competition and the zodiac
 Following closely behind was strong Ox who was named the 2nd animal in the zodiac
 After Ox, came Tiger, panting, while explaining to the Jade Emperor how difficult it was to cross the river with the heavy currents pushing it downstream all the time
 But with its powerful strength, Tiger made to shore and was named the 3rd animal in the cycle
 Suddenly, from a distance came a thumping sound, and the Rabbit arrived
 It explained how it crossed the river: by jumping from one stone to another in a nimble fashion
 Halfway through, it almost lost the race, but the Rabbit was lucky enough to grab hold of a floating log that later washed him to shore
 For that, it became the 4th animal in the Zodiac cycle
 In 5th place was the Flying Dragon
 Of course, the Jade Emperor was deeply curious as to why a swift flying creature such as the Dragon should fail to reach first place
 The mighty dragon explained that he had to stop and make rain to help all the people and creatures of the earth, and therefore he was held back
 Then, on his way to the finish, he saw a little helpless Rabbit clinging onto a log so he did a good deed and gave a puff of breath to the poor creature so that it could land on the shore
 The Jade Emperor was very pleased with the actions of the Dragon, and he was added into the zodiac cycle
 As soon as he had done so, a galloping sound was heard, and the Horse appeared
 Hidden on the Horse's hoof was the Snake, whose sudden appearance gave the Horse a fright, thus making it fall back and giving the Snake the 6th spot, while the Horse placed 7th
 Not long after that, a little distance away, the Goat, Monkey, and Rooster came to the shore
 These three creatures helped each other to get to where they are
 The Rooster spotted a raft, and took the other two animals with it
 Together, the Goat and the Monkey cleared the weeds, tugged and pulled and finally got the raft to the shore
 Because of their combined efforts, the Emperor was very pleased and promptly named the Goat as the 8th creature, the Monkey as the 9th, and the Rooster the 10th
 The 11th animal was the Dog
 Although he was supposed to be the best swimmer, he could not resist the temptation to play a little longer in the river
 Though his explanation for being late was because he needed a good bath after a long spell
 For that, he almost did not make it to the finish line
 Just as the Jade Emperor was about to call it a day, an oink and squeal was heard from a little pig
 The Pig got hungry during the race, promptly stopped for a feast and then fell asleep
 After the nap, the pig continued the race and was named the 12th animal of the zodiac cycle
 The cat drowned in 13th place and did not make it in the zodiac
 It is said that is the reason why cats always chase Rats; to get back at them for what they have done
 Another folk story tells that on registration day, the Rat met up with the Ox
 He thought to himself "ox is the fastest, strongest animal!" So the little Rat played a trick on the Ox
 He asked the Ox if he would like to listen to him sing
 The Rat opened his mouth but said nothing
 "how was that?" he asked the Ox and of course he replied "sorry little Rat, i didn't hear you
" The Rat told the Ox to let him jump onto his back so that he could sing it more clearly, and the Ox agreed
 Soon without knowing, the Ox was walking to the signing post, forgetting the Rat on his back
 When they reached there, the Rat jumped off and claimed first place
 The Ox following and the rest
 In Buddhism, legend has it that Buddha summoned all of the animals of the earth to come before him before his departure from this earth, but only 12 animals actually came to bid him farewell
 To reward the animals who came to him, he named a year after each of them
 The years were given to them in the order they had arrived
 The 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac must have been developed in the early stages of Chinese civilization over hundreds of years before it became the current edition; and it's very hard to investigate the real origin
 Most historians agree that Cat is not in the list since the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac were formed before cats were introduced to China from India with Buddhism
 Another story tells that God called the animals to a banquet that night
 The Rat, who loved to play tricks on his neighbor, told the cat that the banquet was on the day after tomorrow
 The cat believed his neighbor the Rat and slept whilst dreaming of the banquet
 The next day, the Rat arrived first followed by the Ox, the Tiger and the rest of the animals
 The order of the animals was decided by the order that they arrived
 The cat was devastated and vowed that he would always hate the Rat
 This is why cats chase Rats in folklore
 Due to confusion with synonyms during translation, some of the animals depicted by the English words did not exist in ancient China
 For example, 羊 can mean ram, sheep or Goat
 Similarly, 鼠 can also be translated as mouse, as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in Chinese
 Further, 豬 is sometimes translated to boar after its Japanese name, and 牛 plainly means cow or Ox, and not water buffalo, 水牛
 雞 may mean chicken or cock
 However, Rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms, same for 羊, 鼠, etc
 The Chinese zodiac signs are also used by cultures other than Chinese
 For one example, they usually appear on Korean New Year and Japanese New Year's cards and stamps
 The United States Postal Service and those of several other countries issue a "year of the xxrep 4 _ " postage stamp each year to honor this Chinese heritage
 The Chinese lunar coins, depicting the zodiac animals, inspired the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins, as well as varieties from Australia, Korea, and Mongolia
 The Chinese zodiac is an internationally popular theme, available from many of the world's government and private mints
 The Chinese zodiac is also used in some other Asian countries that have been under the cultural influence of China
 However, some of the animals in the zodiac may differ by country
 The Korean zodiac is almost identical to the Chinese zodiac except it includes the Sheep instead of the Goat

 unhone kakori kand main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He was prosecuted by the British and on December 19, 1927, he was hanged to death in Faizabad jail
 ram prasad bismil kii bhanti ashfaaq ulla khaan bhi urdu bhashaa ke behtareen shaayar the
 His Urdu Takhallus, nicknamed in Hindi, was Hasrat
 urdu ke atirikt ve hindi va angreji main lekh evam kavitaayen bhi likhaa karte the
 His full name was Ashfaq Ullah Khan Warsi Hasrat
 bhartiya swatantrata sangram ke sampoorn itihaas main bismil or ashfaaq kii bhoomika nirvivaad rup se hindu-muslim ekta kaa anupam aakhyaan he
 Ashfaq Ullah Khan was born on 22 October 1900 in Kadankhail Jalalnagar locality near the railway station in Shahjahanpur, Shahidgarh, Uttar Pradesh
 unke pita kaa naam mohammad shafiq ulla khaan tha
 His mother, Mazhurunnisha Begum, was counted among the beautiful figures of Balam
 ashfaaq ne swayan apni diary main likhaa he ki jahaan ek ore unke baap-daadon ke khandaan main ek bhi graduate hone tak kii talim na paa sakaa vahiin duusari ore unki nanihaal main sabhi log ucch shikshit the
 Many of them had also been appointed to the rank of Deputy Collector and SJM
 1857 ke gadar main un logon ne jab hindustan kaa saath nahin diya to janata ne gusse main aakar unki aaleeshaan kothi ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 That Kothi is still famous as Jali Kothi throughout the city
 baharhaal ashfaaq ne apni kurabaani dekar nanihaal waalon ke naam par lage us badnuma daag ko hameshaa - hameshaa ke liye dho daalaa
 Ashfaq was the youngest of his siblings
 sab unhen pyaar se achchhu kehete the
 One day his elder brother Riyasat Ullah told Ashfaq about Bismil that he is a very capable and high-ranking poet, Goya is not seen in Shahjahanpur due to arrest in Mainpuri case
 kaaphi arse se faraar he khuda jane kahan or kin halaat main basar karata hoga
 Bismil is his best classmate
 ashfaaq tabhi se bismil se milane ke liye betaav ho gayi
 Time passed 1920 main aam muaafi ke baad ram prasad bismil apane vatan shahjahanpur aaye or gharelu kaarobaar main lag gayi
 Ashfaq tried to earn his trust by meeting Bismil many times but did not succeed
 chunaanche ek roj raat ko khannaut nadi ke kinare sunsaan jagah main meeting ho rahi thi ashfaaq vahaan ja pahunche
 When Ashfaq called Amen on a lion of Bismil, Bismil called him near and asked for introduction
 yah jaanakar ki ashfaaq unke classphelo riyasat ulla kaa sagaa chota bhai he or urdu jubaan kaa shaayar bhi he, bismil ne usase arya samaaj mandir main aakar alag se milane ko kaha
 Ashfaq went to the Arya Samaj even after refusing lakhs of his family members and became a active member of his party Matriwadi after a long chat with Ram Prasad Bismil
 yaheen se unki jindagi kaa nayaa falsafa shuru hua
 Along with the poets, they also became khadmatgars of the community
 ashfaaq bahut doordarshee the unhone ram prasad bismil ko yah salaah di ki krantikari gatividhiyaan ke saath-saath congress party main bhi apni paith banaakar rakhana hamaari kaamyavi main madadgaar hi sabit hoga
 However, along with Ashfaq and Bismil, many other youths of Shahjahanpur joined Congress and gave the party power
 1921 kii ahmedabad congress main ram prasad bismil va premakrishna khanna ke saath ashfaaq bhi shaamil hue
 In the session, he met Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who was considered among the senior martyrs of Congress
 moulana hasarat mohani dwaara prastut purna swaraj ke prastaav kaa jab gandhi ji ne virodh kiya to shahjahanpur ke congressi swayamsevakon ne gandhi kii dtakar mukhaalafat kii or khub hangaamaa machaaya
 Ultimately, Gandhiji had to accept the proposal even without wanting it
 isi prakaar disambar 1922 kii gaya congress main bhi navayuvakon dwaara gandhi kii jamkar khinchaayi kii gayi
 In this, the youth of Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh became one
 un sabakaa gandhi se ek hi sawaal tha- "aapane kisase poochkar asahyog aandolan waapas liya?" After the Congress of 1922, two parties were formed in the party, one of the rich people and the other of the young men from the general section
 pehle vaale dal ne 1 janvari 1923 ko swaraj party bana lee duusare dal ne krantikari party ke gathan kaa man bana liya
 Some young men from Bengal came directly to Shahjahanpur and met the experienced revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil of Mainpuri conspiracy and urged them to cooperate in the formation of a new party
 bismil un dinon silk kii sadiyon ke vyapaar main uljhe hue the unke paas samay nahin tha
 At this Ashfaq explained to him and pledged to cooperate fully on his behalf
 uske baad hi bismil ne apane saajheedaar banarsi laal ko sara karowar saunp diya or puure man se ashfaaq or bismil krantikari party ke kaam main jute gayi
 In view of Ashfaq's commendable role in taking the Revolutionary Review, published in English on 1 January 1925, on behalf of the party to the entire district of Uttar Pradesh, HRA Central member Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee nominated Ashfaq as Bismil's cooperative
 And putting the responsibility of the state on the shoulders of these two, went to Bengal itself
 bengal main shachindranath sanyaal va yogesh chandra chatarji jaise do pramukh vyaktiyon ke giraftaar ho jane par hindustan republican asosiyeshan kaa puraa daaromadar bismil ke kandhon par aa gaya
 In this, apart from Prem Krishna Khanna, Thakur Roshan Singh from Shahjahanpur, Ashfaq Ulla Khan's contribution was commendable
 jab ireland ke krantikariyon kii tarj par jabaran dhan chhinane kii yojana banaayi gayi to ashfaaq ne apane bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan kii licency bandook or do peti kaartoos bismil ko uplabdh karaaye taaki dhanadhy logon ke gharon main dakaitiyaan daalkar party ke liye paisa ikattha kiya ja sake
 But when Bismil planned to loot the government treasury, Ashfaq single-handedly opposed it in the executive meeting
 unka tark tha ki abhi yah kadam uthaanaa khatre se khaali na hoga; sarkaar hamen nestnabud kar degi
 On this, when all the people instead of Ashfaq, Bismil openly said, "panditji! See the act of this mother
 hamaari party main ek muslim ko shaamil karne kii jid kaa asar ab aap hi bhugtiye, ham log to chale
 "ashfaq said this -" Panditji is our leader, we cannot be equal to him
 unka faisla hamen manjur he
 We will not say anything today but tomorrow the whole world will see how a Pathan carried out this action? "and the same happened, the next day as the train moved from Kakori station on the evening of August 9, 1925, Rajendranath Lahiri pulled the chain, Ashfaq
 He placed the driver on the floor of the driver and took him in his possession and Ram Prasad Bismil dropped the treasure box down, slamming the guard on the ground
 lohe kii majboot tijori jab kisi se na tuuti to ashfaaq ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaaya or ghan lekar puri takat se tijori par pil padey
 As soon as Ashfaq's vault was broken, everyone saw his steely strength
 varanaa yadi tijori kuch der or na tuutati or lakhanu se police yaa army aa jaati to mukaable main kai jane ja sakati thim; phir us kakori kand ko itihaas main koi doosraa hi naam diya jaataa
 The night of 26 September 1925, when simultaneous arrests were made in the whole country, Ashfaq escaped by throwing dust in the eyes of the police
 pehle ve nepal gayi kuch din vahanrahakar kanpur aa gayi or ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ke pratap press main 2 din ruke
 From there, through Banaras, he worked for a few days in Daltonganj, a district of Bihar, but returned to the city of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, before the police got the idea
 vidhyaarthee ji ne unhen apane paas se kuch rupee dekar bhopal unke bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan ke paas bhej diya
 After staying there for some time, Ashfaq went to Rajasthan and stayed at his brother's friend Arjunlal Sethi's house
 sethi ji kii ladkee un par fida ho gayi or unke saamne shaadi kaa prastaav pesh kar diya
 Finally, one night, he got upset from there and reached Daltonganj in the same district of Bihar and changed his old name and started a job
 ek din bhed khul gaya to ashfaaq train pakad kar dilli chale gayi or apane jile shahjahanpur ke hi mul nivasee ek puraane dost ke ghar par tehre
 Here the same trouble followed Ashfaq
 jiske yahan tehre hue the us dost kii ladkee ne bhi ashfaaq par dore daalane shuru kar diye
 Being convinced of the situation, Ashfaq had made a plan to go abroad and meet Lala Hardayal outside Delhi, that on receiving news of a spy, Ikramul Haq, vice-chairman of Delhi Intelligence Police, arrested him
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki us dost ne hi ashfaaq ko pakadvane main police kii imadad kii thi
 It is a historical fact that the decision of Kakori scandal was heard on 6 April 1926
 ashfaaq ulla khaan or shachindranath bakshi ko police bahut baad main giraftaar kar paayi thi at: special seshan jaj je0aar0dablue0 banet kii adaalat main 7 disambar 1926 ko ek poorak mukadmaa daayar kiya gaya
 The trial magistrate Ainuddin advised Ashfaq to appoint a Muslim lawyer for his case, but Ashfaq insisted and chose Kripashankar Hazela as his lawyer
 is par ek din si0ai0di0 ke police captain khanbahadur tasadduk hossain ne jail main jaakar ashfaaq se mili or unhen phaansi kii sajaa se bachane ke liye sarkari gavaah banane kii salaah di
 When Ashfaq did not listen to his advice, he went in solitude and explained Ashfaq - itnaa sunate hi ashfaaq kii tyoriyaan chadh gayin or ve gusse main daantkar bole- On hearing this, the poor captain lost his seat and he took his face and moved silently from there
 baharhaal 13 july 1927 ko poorak mukademe kaa faisla suna diya gaya - dfa 120 va 121 ke antargat umr-kaid or 396 ke antargat sajaaye-maut arthath phansika dand
 The judge had clearly written in his judgment that these accused did not do this conspiracy for their personal benefit, but even then if these people express their remorse on their actions then the punishment can be reduced
 vakil kii salaah par lakhanu jail main jaakar ashfaaq bismil se mili or unka mat jaananaa chaha
 On this, Bismil explained to them that just as we have to kill one or two pieces in order to win a losing game in chess, in the same way, if we can also file an apology and save ourselves from the death penalty, it would be better
 
 saat saal main umr-kaid puri ho jane ke baad ham isse bhi bhayankar kand karke is beraham sarkaar kii naak main dam kar denge
 On the other hand, with the mutual consent, Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaq Ullah Khan filed their apologies
 ashfaaq ne pehla maafinama 11 agast 1927 va doosraa maafinama 29 agast 1927 ko likhakar bheja
 Additionally, on the advice of the lawyer, another mercy-appeal was sent to the Viceroy and Governor General on behalf of Ashfaq's mother, Musamat Mazhurunnisha Begum, but there was no consideration
 ashfaaq va unki maan ke baad vidhaan sabha sadasyon ne sanyukt rup se hastakshar karke sanyukt praant ke governor wiliam moris ko ek memorendam nainital bheja
 Along with this, Pt Govind Vallabh Pant and CY Chintamani also sent an application, but all efforts remained useless
 22 sitambar 1927 ko home secretary ech0 dablue0 hegg ne apni final report di jiske ant main usne spasht likhaa tha- "in logon kaa uddeshy ek sthapit sarkaar ko ulatna tha
 Since it has been fully proved, it can only be executed in this case, whereas in the Bengal conspiracy, of which it was a branch, no such factual confirmation has been made so far; Therefore, the people there have been kept free from execution
 mujhe pakkaa vishwaas he ki yadi inhen phaansi kii sajaa na dekar jinda chod diya gaya to ye bengal to kya, puure hindustan main fail jaayenge
 " in tamaam apilon va daleelon kaa itnaa asar jarur hua ki phaansi kii taarikh do baar aage badhaa di gayi
 Earlier this date was 16 September 1927, later 11 October 1927
 chunki landan kii privi-concil main marsi-apil ja chuki thi at: phaansi kii taarikh phir se aage ke liye taal di gayi
 Eventually the date of 19 December 1927 was fixed and the information was sent to the four jails
 faijabad jail main yah soochna pahonchte hi ashfaaq ne 29 navambar 1927 ko apane bhai riyasat ulla khaan, 15 disambar 1927 ko apni valida mohatarama majahoorunnishaan begum tathaa 16 disambar 1927 ko apni munh boli bahan nalini didi ko khat likhaa or khuda kii ibaadat main jute gayi
 Jumerat, on the evening of 15 December 1927, from the dungeon of Faizabad jail, Ashfaq Ullah Khan sent his last message in Urdu language by writing the name of the people of Hindustan
 unka makasad yah tha ki muslim samudaay ke log is par khaas tavajjo ata karen
 From page 172 to 178 in a police officer Pt
 Vidyaranav Sharma's book Ages of God: Bismil and Ashfaq have given this full message, some special pieces are being given here for the audience of Wikipedia
 iske baad unhone hindu-muslim ekta ke phaayde, ahmedabad congress jaisaa ittihad, gori angrejiyat kaa bhoot utaarne kii baat karte hue desh ke logon se videshi moh va deshi chizon se nafrat kaa tyaag karne kii nayab naseehat dete hue chand angreji panktiyon ke saath rukhsat hone kii guzarish kii thi
 "to every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late
 But how can man die better, than facing fearful odds
 For the ashes of his fathers, and temples of his gods
" shahjahanpur ke aagney kavi swargeey agnivesh shukla ne yah bhavpurn kavita likhi thi jisamen unhone faijabad jail kii kaal-kothri main phaansi se purv apni jindagi kii aakhri raat gujaarte hue ashfaaq ke dilo-dimag main uth rahe jajwaton ke tufaan ko hindi shabdon kaa khubasurat jama pahanaaya he
 Here are selected portions of that poem in the service of Wikipedia readers: bismil hindu hai kehete hai, phir aauunga-phir aauunga; le nayaa janm i bharat maan! tujko aaazaad karaaunga
 
 ji karata he main bhi kah don, par majahab se bandh jaataa hoon; main musalmaan hoon punarjanm kii baat nahin kah paata hoon
 Yes, if God is found somewhere, i will spread my bag; Instead of heaven, i will ask for a new birth
 
 On the hanging day, Monday December 19, 1927, Ashfaq woke up in the morning as usual, retired from defecation etc
 and took a bath
 kuch der vajrasana main baith quran kii aayaton ko dohraraya or kitaab band karke use aankhon se choomaa
 Then on his own, he stood on the gallows and said, "my hands will not be stained with human blood
" khuda ke yahan meraa insaaf hoga
 "then i put the trap on my own
 ashfaaq kii laash faijabad jila karagaar se shahjahanpur laayi ja rahi thi
 While changing the train at Lucknow station, Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, who came from Kanpur despite the illness, paid his respects to his dead body
 parsishah photographer se ashfaaq ke shav kaa photo khinchvaaya or ashfaaq ke parivaar janon ko yah hidaayat dekar kanpur waapas chale gayi ki shahjahanpur main inkaa pakkaa makbara jarur banavaa dena, agar rupayon kii jarurat padey to khat likh dena main kanpur se maniorder bhej doongaa
 Ashfaq's body was buried in the garden in front of his ancestral house
 unki majaar par sangemarmar ke pathar par ashfaaq ulla khaan kii hi kahi hui ye panktiyaan likhva di gayin: Your life will be due to your death
 ashfaaq yah pehle se hi jaanate the ki unki shahadat ke baad hindustan main libral party yani congress hi power main aayegi or un jaise aam tabake ke balidaniyon kaa koi charchaa nahin hoga; sirf shaskaon ke smriti-lekh hi surakshit rakhe jaayenge
 That is why he had predicted the present situation long back in 1927 by saying this verse: bahut afsos hota he bady takalif hoti he, shahid ashfaaq kii turbat he or dhoopon kaa saaya he!! Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi sent a money order of 200 rupees and put the roof on the tomb of Ashfaq and saved it from the shadow of sunlight
 ram prasad 'bismil' kii tarah ashfaaq bhi bahut achche shaayar the
 If you compare the poetry of these two, then you will not see even the difference of even a ratty
 pehali baar kii mulaakaat main hi bismil ashfaaq ke mureed ho gayi the jab ek meeting main bismil ke ek sher kaa jabaav unhone apane ustad jigar muradaabadi kii ghazal ke makte se diya tha
 When Bismil said- to ashfaaq ne "amin" kehete hue jabaav diya- There is a daily story of Ashfaq Arya Samaj temple going to Bismil for some work in Shahjahanpur
 sanyog se us samay ashfaaq jigar muradaabadi kii yah ghazal gunaguna rahe the- When Bismil smiled upon hearing this lion, Ashfaq asked, "why Ram brother! Did i say something wrong to Misra?" To this, Bismil replied - "no my Krishna Kanhaiya! This is not the case
" main jigar sahab kii bahut izzat karata hoon magar unhone mirza gaalib kii puraani jameen par ghisa pita sher kahkar koun-sa bada tir maar liya
 If someone had given a new tone, i would have also called Irshad
 " ashfaaq ko bismil kii yah baat janchi nahin; unhone chunauti bhare lahaze main kaha- "to ram bhai! ab aap hi isamen girah lagaaiye, main maan jaaounga aapaki soch jigar or mirza gaalib se bhi parale darje kii he
 "at the same time, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' said this lion - yah sunate hi ashfaaq uchhal padey or bismil ko gale laga ke bole- "ram bhai! maan gayi; aap to ustaadon ke bhi ustad hai
 " iske baad to ashfaaq or bismil main hode-si lag gayi ek se ek umdaa sher kehane kii
 But if we look carefully, then there was a kind of telepathy work in both of them, only then they show uniformity in their feelings
 misaal ke taur par chand misare hajir hai:bismil kaa yah sher- How close does this piece of Ashfaq seem? mulk kii mali haalat ko khasta hota dekhakar likhi gayi bismil kii ye panktiyaan- How many more meet this lion of Ashfaq? isi prakaar vatan kii barwaadi par bismil kii peeda- This lion of Ashfaq resembling it is not inferior in his capacity bismil kii ek bady mashhoor ghazal ummide-sukhan kii ye panktiyaan- Ashfaq liked it very much
 unhone isi bahar main sirf ek hi sher kaha tha jo unki aprakashit diary main is prakaar miltaa he:- Those who want to do a special or comparative study of the poetry of Ashfaq and Bismil can go to any library and see the second part of the history book of the revolutionary literature of the freedom struggle

 mcdonald Calcium hypochlorite is an inorganic compound
 iskaa rasinic sutara cacl he
 It is a white beveled solid
 isse chlorine kii teevr gandh nikalati rahati he
 It is used in purification of drinking water
 chlorofarm tathaa chlorine gas banane main bhi iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is also called bleaching
 yah chooney kaa chloride hota he or dekhne main chooney kii tarah safed hota he par isamen chlorine kii gandh hoti he
 It was first built in 1799 by Charles Tennant of Glasgow
 viranjan churna sthaayee nahin hota
 With the passage of time, the amount of chlorine in it decreases, causing its bleaching property to deteriorate
 vyapaarik viranjan churna main viranjan kii drushti se paryaapt maatra main niskriy padaarth mili rahete hai
 It decomposes at high temperature
 vaayu kii ardrata or carbon dioxide se bhi iskaa vighatan dhire dhire hota he
 Bleaching powder is formed from lime and chlorine
 buje chooney par chlorine kii kriya se yah banataa he
 Chlorine gas is flowed at a level two to three inches deep of lime
 chooney kaa yah str 10 se lekar 20 foot chaude, 100 foot lambey or 6 se lekar 7 foot unche kaksh main bana hota he or aavashyaktaanusaar samay-samay par str ko ulatate rahane kii vyavastha rahati he
 Absorption of chlorine is first intense but slows down
 kaksh ke sthaan main ab nalon kaa vyavhaar hota he, jinamein upar se chuunaa girtaa he or neeche se chlorine pravisht karata he or donon nalon ke madhya chooney dwaara chlorine ke avasorana se tatkaal churna praapt hota he
 Calcium processing sodium prakram dwaara nirmaan The formula of bleaching powder is given
 isamen calcium kaa ek bandha chlorine se or doosraa bandha hypochlorus mulak se sambhddha he
 Some unused lime is also added to the powder
 at: ise sanghatan kaa abhas sutara se bahut kuch lagata he
 Not all chlorine of powder is available for bleaching
 adhik se adhik 40% chlorine hi uplabdh hota he, par saamaanya churna main uplabdh chlorine kii maatra sadaa hi isse kam rahati he or samay ke bitne ke saath ghatati jaati he
 This powder is widely used for bleaching and as an anthelmintic, but now many other substances, such as liquid chlorine, calcium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite, in which the amount of available chlorine is much more than bleaching, are now being replaced
 Coming in sursagar, brajabhasha main mahakavi surdaas dwaara rache gaye kirtanon-padon kaa ek sundar sankalan he jo shabdaarth kii drushti se upyukt or aadarneey he
 The first nine chapters are brief in this, but the tenth wing has expanded a lot
 isamen bhakthi kii pradhanta he
 Its two episodes "krishna's bal-leela" and "bhramar-geetasar" are extremely important
 sursagar main lagbhag ek lakh pad hone kii baat kahi jaati he
 But in the current editions, only about five thousand posts are found
 vibhinn sthanon par isaki sau se bhi adhik pratilipiyaan praapt hui hai, jinka pratilipi kaal sanwat 1658 vi0 se lekar unnisvin shatabdi tak he inamen pracheenatam pratilipi nathdwara ke saraswati bhandar main surakshit paayi gai hai
 In terms of philosophical views, there is a substantial difference between "bhagwat" and "sursagar"
 sursagar kii saraahna karte hue doctor hajaari prasad dvivedi ne likhaa he - Two forms of "sursagar" are found in the complete handwritten form - "collective" and "dwadash Scandal" according to Sanskrit Bhagavata
 sangrahatmak "sursagar" ke bhi do rup dekhne main aate hai
 The first, the first of the Bhagavalilic verse composed at the time of shree-vallabhacharya's disciple at your-gaughat- begins with "braj Bhayau maihair ke put, jab yaayi suni", the second - from "mathura-janma-leela"
 


 kaha jaataa he, hindi saahityetihaas granthon se ojhal "sursagar" ke utpatti vikaas kaa ek alag itihaas he, jo ab tak prakaash main nahin aayaa he or shri sur ke samakaleen bhakt itihaas rachayitaaon- "shri gokulanath ji, srihariraay ji or shri nabhadas ji prabhruti main jiskaa vishesh rup se ullekh kiya he
 Therefore, it is known from many important texts on these Purva that Shri Sur composed the post of Sahasravadhi, composed the post of Lakshavadhi, did not write any scripture
 baad main anant-sur-padaavalee sagar kahalaai
 In fact, Srisur, as it is known from the above reference texts, was Bhagavalli's emotion-free vocalist, always composing new verses, singing in front of his lord "govardhannathji"
 rachana karne vaale the, so nity savere se sandhya tak gaae jane vaale raagon main lalit rason kaa rang bharkar apni vaani kii tulika se chitrit kar apane ko dhanya kiya karte the
 Ashtu, neither did he have a sense of collecting his unmasked works nor did he have the desire to order many
 unka kaary to apane prabhu kii naanaa gunan garuli gunavali gaanaa, uske amritopam ras main nimagn ho jhoomna tathaa-"etechaansh kalapuns: krishnastu bhagwaan swayan" kii nandalay main bal se paugand avasthaa tak lilaon main tadatmbhaav se vibhor hona tha, yahan apni samast muktak rachanaaon ko ekatra kar krambaddh karne kaa samay or sthaan kahan tha
 It is said that Mr
 Surdas was "utterly blind," how did he collect all his compositions then? Yet the writing and compilation of the verses composed and sung by Surdas must have been going on
 anyathaa ve moulik rup se rachit or gaae gaye pad jupt ho gaye hote
 Perhaps Sur's contemporary disciples or friends — if Sur Sachmuch was blind — would have been writing and compiling those verses
 ab tak uske sangrahatmak yaa dwadas skandhaatmak banane kaa koi itihaas purnat: gyaat nahin he
 During the time of "geet-sangeet-sagar" Sri Vitthalnathji Goswami, many funds serviced by Srimadvallabhacharya, by your descendants, went out of Braj
 yat: sampradaay ke anusaar "kirtanon ke bina seva nahin or seva bina kirthan nahin" at: jahaan jahaan ye nidhiyaan gayi, vahiin vahiin "kanth" yaa "granth" rup main ashtchhaap ke kaviyon kii kritiyaan bhi gai or vahaan inke sankalit rup main-"nity kirthan" or "varshotsav" naam pade, aisa bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "collectible" form of the Sea of sur was compiled before Srisur
 uski san
 1630 vi
 kii likhi prati braj main milti he
 Many later written collections are also found in him
 mudrit rup iskaa kahin purana he
 First it was from Mathura, later from Agra, Jaipur, Delhi and Calcutta no
 In 1898, Leitho was published with a press release
 krishnanand vyasadev sankalit "ragakalpadrum" bhi is samay kaa sangrahatmak sursagar kaa ek vikrut rup he, jo sangeet ke rangon main banta hua he
 The famous poet "dwijdev" of Braj Bhasha - ie Maharaj Mansingh, Ayodhya Naresh, called it no
 It was edited in 1920 and published from Navalkishore Press, Lucknow
 ye sabhi sangrahatmak rup sursagar, bhagwaan shrikrishna kii janmlila gayan rup gokul nandalay main manaae gaye "nandamahotsav" se prarambh hokar unki samast brajalila mathura aagaman, uddhav-gopi-samvaad, shri ram, narsingh tathaa vaaman jayantiyaan evam pehle-shri vallabhacharya ji kii shishyta se purv rache gaye "deenta aashray" ke padon ke baad samaapt hue hai
 The trend of compilation of sur suras thus ended not only on the collective form of their ocean, but it progressed in various forms, so that their verses are seen in handwritten and printed forms of various works, which are as follows - Deen asylum posts
 , The astrological post, today called "sahityahari"
 ramayana, balalila ke pad, vinay patrika, vairagyasatak, surachhattisi, surbahottaree, sur bhramaragit, sura, surdaas nayan, murali maadhuri aadi-aadi, kintu ye sabhi sangrah aapke sangrahatmak "sagar kalpataru" ke hi madhur fal hai
 The form of the ocean of Sri Sur became Shri Vyas Praneeth and Shuk-mukh-nisrit "dwadash Skandhika"
 vah kab bana, kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 The literary texts of Hindi are silent in this subject
 is dwadash skandhaatmak "sur sagar" kii sabase pracheen prati san
 1757 vi
 kii milti he
 Many subsequent handwritten copies are found
 unke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki sur samudit sagar kaa yah "shrimadbhagwat anusaar dwadash skandhaatmak rup" atharahavin shatee ke pehle nahin ban paaya tha
 Its so-called "collectible" form had by this time gained considerable circulation
 saath hi is rup kii sundarataa, sarasata or bhashaa kii shuddhta evam manoharata main bhi koi vishesh antar nahin ho paaya tha
 She remained as beautiful as she was at the time of Sura, but she could not live properly in its twilight forms
 jyon jyon hastlikhit roopon main vah aage badhati gai tyon-tyon sur kii manjul bhashaa se dur hatati gai
 However, anyone who lost his existence and composed ungrammatical narrative stories like "hari, Hari, Hari Hari Sumran Kareo" and the "deenata asylum" posts created before Sri Sur came to Shrimadvallabhacharya's feet According to the first wing, not only the tenth wing, the latter, the eleventh and the twelfth wings are decorated, it is respected
