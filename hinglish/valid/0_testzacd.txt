 Islam is a monotheistic religion which, according to its followers, is based on the teachings of the Qur'an, the last divine book of Allah, delivered by Muhammad, the last Rasul and prophet of Allah

 The Sharia, a book written purportedly from the mouth of Hazrat Mohammad Saheb and providing instructions to follow the book, are the only two resources that rightly identify the source of Islam's information
 islamic dharm ke pramukh mat yah hai: Muslims believe in a single God whom they call Allah
 akeshwarwad ko arabi main tauhid kehete hai, jo shabd vaahid se aata he jiskaa arth he ek
 In Islam, God is considered beyond human comprehension
 musalamaanon se ishvar kii kalpana karne ke bajaay uski prarthana or jai-jayakaar karne ko kaha gaya he
 According to Muslims, God is unique - there is no one like him
 islam main ishwar kii ek vilakshan avadharana par bal diya gaya he or yah bhi mana jaataa ki uskaa sampoorn vivaran karnaa manushya se pare he
 Say: na use kisi ne janaa or na hi wo kisi kaa janak he

 ” According to Islam, from time to time, God made a person his messenger for the guidance of man on earth
 lagbhag sansaar me 124,000 nabi ek khuda ko poojane kaa sandesh dene ke liye bheje gayi the
 These messengers were also among humans and called people towards God
 ishwar in duuton se vibhinn roopon se sampark rakhata tha
 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishwar ne swayan, shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahab was also a part of this link
 unako jo dharmik pustak pradaan kii gayi uskaa naam quran he
 The Qur'an describes 25 other prophets of Allah

 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all prophets sent by God and Muslims consider Muhammad the last prophet of God

 Muslims believe in the existence of angels
 unke anusaar devdoot swayan koi vivek nahin rakhte or ishwar kii ajna kaa yatharoop paalan hi karte hai
 They are only abstract and flawless figures made of light, which are neither male nor female, but different from human beings in every sense
 haalanki devdoot agananeey hai, par kuch devdoot quran main prabhaav rakhte hai: Like other religions of Central Asia, in Islam also, the end of the universe is considered by the doomsday
 iske anusaar ishwar ek din sansar ko samaapt karegaa
 Only God is aware of when this day will come
 islam ke anusaar sabhi mrit logon ko us din punerjeevit kiya jayega or allaah ke aadeshaanusaar apana jivan vyateet karne waalon ko swarg bheja jayega or uskaa aadesh na manaane waalon ko nark main jalaayaa jayega
 Muslims believe in luck

 No event can happen without his permission

 According to Islam, man is himself responsible for his misdeeds because God allows man to take them for himself or not

 There are two major classes of Islam, the Shia and the Sunni
 donon ke apane apane islamic niyam hai lekin aadharbhoot siddhanth milte-julate hai
 Many Sunnis do not consider Shias completely Muslims
 sunni islam main har musalmaan ke 5 aavashyak kartavya hote hai jinhen islam ke 5 stambh bhi kaha jaataa he
 Slightly different doctrines are called stanzas in Shia Islam
 sunni islam ke 5 stambh hai- Arabic: لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله Transliteration: La ilaha ilallah Muhammad Rasool Allah Hindi: There is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
 is ghoshnaa se har musalmaan ishwar kii akeshwarvadita or mohammad ke rasul hone ke apane vishwaas kii gavaahi detaa he
 This is the most prominent principle of Islam
 har musalmaan ke liye anivaary he ki vah ise sweekaare Islam has its own influence on every aspect of life for Muslims
 islamic siddhanth musalamaanon ke gharelu jivan, unke rajnatik yaa aarthik jivan, musalmaan rajyon kii videsh niti ityadi par prabhaav daalate hai
 The Shariah refers to a set of policies that is based on Islamic legal traditions and Islamic personal and ethical practices
 sharia kii niti ko neenv bana kar nyaayashastra ke adhyyan ko fiqah kehete hai
 Due to different interpretations of Islamic scholars in the case of Fiqh, jurisprudence in Islam got divided in many parts and many different jurisprudence related doctrines were born
 inhen panth kehete hai
 The major texts in Sunni Islam are- adhiktar musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki chaaron panth aadharbhoot rup se sahi hai or inamen jo matbhed hai vah nyaayashastra kii baarik vyakhyaaon ko lekar he
 Muhammad the Prophet attained the ultimate knowledge in the hills of Mecca around 610
 jab unhone upadesh dena aarambh kiya tab makka ke samrudh logon ne ise apni saamaajik or dharmik vyavastha par khatra samajha or unka virodh kiya
 Finally in 622 he had to travel from Mecca to Medina with his followers
 is yatra ko hijra kaha jaataa he or yaheen se islamic calendar kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The lives of the people of Madina were troubled by mutual fighting and the messages of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab made them very popular there
 630 main hazrat mohammad sahab ne apane anuyaayiyon ke saath ek sandhi kaa ulanghan hone ke kaaran makka par chadhaai kar di
 The Meccans surrendered and converted to Islam
 makka main sthit kaaba ko islam kaa pavitra sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prophet Muhammad saheb died in 632
 par unki mrityu tak islam ke prabhaav se arab ke saare kabeeley ek raajnneetik or saamaajik sabhyataa kaa hissaa ban gayi the
 After this, the Khilafat phase began in Islam
 mohammad ke sasur abu bakr siddiq musalamaanon ke pehle khalipha 632 main banaaye gayi
 Many prominent Muslims accepted the mill to be their caliph
 sunni musalamaanon ke anusaar abu bakr siddiq kii khilaafat ke sambandh main koi vivaad nahin hua apitu sabhi ne unhe khalifaa swikaar kar liya tha, sunni manytaaon ke anusaar hazrat mohammad sahab ne swayan apane swargvaas se purv hi abu bakr siddiq ko apane sthaan par imamat karne kaa kaary bhaar dekar abu bakr siddiq ke khalifaa hone kaa kaa sanket de diya tha san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko hazrat ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 Keep in mind that Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan, that is, Bani Hashim Ali, wanted to be Khalifa
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 parantu shiya muslim ke anusaar mohammad ke chachaa jaad bhai, ali, jin kaa musalmaan bahut aadar karte the ne abu bakr ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But this controversy was averted in order to prevent the destruction of Islam, in fact, because of the wisdom of Hazrat Ali, the fighting of Muslim forces from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Iranian Empire took place during Abu Bakr's tenure
 yah yuddh mohammad ke jamaane se chali aa rahi dushmani kaa hissaa the
 Umar bin Khatab was made caliph in 634 after Abu Bakr
 unke kaarykaal main islamic samrajya bahut tezi se failaa or sampurna irani samrajya or do tihaai purvi roman samrajya par musalamaanon ne kabaja kar liya
 The entire empire was divided into various territories and a governor was appointed for each region which was under the Caliphate
 umr bin khattab ke baad usmaan bin afphan 644 main khalipha bane
 These were also among the prominent companions of Muhammad
 usmaan bin afphan par unke virodhiyon ne ye aarope lagane shuru kiye ki wo pakshpaat se niyuktiyaan karte hai or ki ali hi khalipha hone ke sahi hakdaar hai
 Then the spirit of rebellion arose in Egypt and from there an armed group of 1000 people came to Madina, the capital of Islamic Empire
 us samay tak sabhi khalipha aam logon kii tarah hi rahete the
 Therefore, this group succeeded in killing Usman in 656
 kuch pramukh musalamaanon ne ab ali ko khalipha sweenkar kar liya lekin kuch pramukh musalamaanon kaa dal ali ke khilaaf bhi ho gaya
 These Muslims believed that it was not right for Ali to become the Khalifa until the killers of Usman were punished
 yah islam kaa pehla grihayuddh tha
 Initially, a part of this group was led by Ayesha, Muhammad's wife
 ali or ashya kii senaaon ke bich main jang hooi jise jang-e-jamal kehete hai
 Ali's army conquered in this battle
 ab syria ke rajyapal muavia ne vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa
 Mu'awiya was also a relative of Usman, there was no result of war between Mu'awiya's army and Ali's army
 ali ne samrajya main faili ashaanti par kaabo paane ke liye rajdhani madina se kufa main pehle hi badal di thi
 Mu'awiya's armies now spread throughout the Islamic Empire, and soon Mu'awiya was captured by the entire empire except the territory of Kufa
 tabhi ek kattarpanthi ne 661 main ali kii hatya kar di
 After Ali, however, Mu'awiya became the Khalifa, but there remained a section of Muslims who believed that the Khalifa of the Muslims could belong to the family of Muhammad
 unka maananaa tha ki yah khalipha swayan bhagwaan ke dwaara aadhyatmik maargdarshan paata he
 According to him Ali was the first Imam
 yah varg shiya varg ke naam se prasiddh hua
 The rest of the Muslims, who do not believe that only the family of Muhammad can be Khalifa, are called Sunni
 sunni pehle chaaron khalifaaon ko rashidoon khalipha kehete hai jiskaa arth he sahi maarg pe chalane vaale khalipha
 Khilafat became hereditary after Mu'awiya became the Caliph
 isse umayyad kilaafat kaa aarambh hua
 According to Shia history cars, Yazid, son of Mu'awiya, started working against the policies of Islam as soon as he got the Khilafat, religious Muslims became uncomfortable by his act, now Yazid needed to recognize his wrong policies from such a person Grant that all Muslims trust, for this work, Yazid gave the blessings of Hazrat Muhammad, Hazrat Ali Alaihis Salaam and Hazrat Muhammad's only Hazrat Hussain, son of the daughter of Fatimah, wanted to sanction his Khilafat but Hazrat Hussain refused to give his approval because of his actions against the policies of Islam
 On the refusal of Hazrat Hussain, the soldiers of Yazid, Hazrat Hussain and his 72 Stopped water on the companions and took their housemates hostage by killing them with great disrespect, sunni mat ke bade vidhwano imam ahamed bin hambl, imam gajali vagairah ne yajid ko qatle hossain karne kaa zimmedaar nahin mana he
 Hussein attained martyrdom in this battle
 shiya log 10 muharram ke din isi kaa shok manaate hai
 The Ummayd dynasty remained in power for 70 years and during this period they occupied North Africa, South Europe, Sindh and many parts of Central Asia
 ummyad vansh ke baad abbasi vansh 750 main satta main aayaa
 Shia and Ajmi Muslims greatly assisted the Abbasids in rebelling against the Ummayd dynasty
 ummyad vansh kii ek shakha dakshin spain or kuch or kshetron par simat kar rah gayi
 The notion of only an Islamic empire now began to wane
 abbasiyon ke raaj main islam kaa swarna yug shuru hua
 The Abbasid Khalifa gave great importance to knowledge
 muslim duniya bahut tezi se vishav main gyaan kendra banane lagi
 Many scholars studied books related to literature, philosophy, science, mathematics etc
 of ancient Yunnan, India, China and Persian civilizations and translated them into Arabic
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is ke kaaran bahut bada gyaanakosh itihaas ke pannon main khone se rah gaya
 Muslim scholars did not just translate
 unhone in sabhi vishyon main apni chhap bhi chodi
 Many new discoveries related to anatomy and diseases in medical science were made in India, such as the difference between measles and smallpox was understood
 ibane seenaa ne chikitsa vigyaan se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin jo ki aage ja kar aadhunik chikitsa vigyaan kaa aadhaar baniin

 Algebra got its English name from al-khwarizmi's book Kitab-al-jabar-val-muqabla

 In Islamic Philosophy, the philosophy of ancient Greek civilization was developed with Islamic color
 ibane seenaa ne navaplatowad, arastuvaad or islamic dharamshastra ko jod kar siddhanton kii ek nai pranali kii rachana kii
 This created a new wave in philosophy known as Ibnisinism
 isi tarah iban rashud ne arestu ke siddhanton ko islamic siddhanton se jod kar ibnarashuwad ko janm diya
 The art of studying Islamic theology was developed with the help of dualism
 ise kalam kehete hai
 Finding the meaning of Muhammad Sahab's quotes, activities, etc
 and making laws from them became a subject in itself

 Apart from Islam at that time, there were 3 traditions in Arabia

 Zuma also got involved in a corruption-related controversy after his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was accused of corruption and fraud
 us samay lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshak rahe bulilani ngakuka zuma or ANC mukhya sachetak tony yengeni ke khilaaf takat kaa durupyog karne ke iljaamon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 In 2004, Zuma became a prominent figure in the Schabir Shaik trial

 During the trial, Shack was shown requesting a bribe of 500 000 rand per year for Zuma in support of Zuma's defense contractor Thomson CSF, which is recorded in the infamous "encrypted fax"
 2 june 2005 ko, shaike ko doshi paaya gaya or 15 saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 Judge Hillary Squires gives a detailed account of several transactions between Shack and Zuma, with a summary that "all the accused companies have been used to pay Jacob Zuma at one time"
 The media incorrectly quoted Squires' statement with the phrase "a generally corrupt relationship", while the exact same word does not exist in court transcripts
 is vaakyansh kii shuruyaat karne waalon kii pratiraksha main, shaike ke khilaaf faisle ke sampoorn pratilekh main vastav main zuma kaa zikr 471 baar hua he, "bhrasht" yaa "bhrashtachar" shabd kaa prayog 54 baar kiya gaya he or isamen aise 12 vaakya hai jinamein "bhrasht" or "zuma" donon shabdon kaa prayog ek saath he
 Later media sources changed the phrase to "mutually beneficial symbiosis", which was replaced by Article 235 of the verdict, which was: "to think it would be against common sense and ordinary human nature to benefit from the accusations of Zuma
" Was not realized, which was getting far more than before 1997; and even if nothing was ever said between them that could help mutually beneficial symbiosis Is installed, which can generate a sense of in only thanks to a series of continuing in accordance with the evidence was there, its conditions to start and these payments after the recipient
 " On June 14, 2005, President Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the post of vice-president, after media speculated about his future with deep speculation
 mabek ne sansad kii sanyukt baithak main kaha ki "yah mananeey up raashtrapati, sarkaar, hamaari yuva loktantric pranali or hamaare desh ke hit main sabase acha hoga ki mananeey jacob zuma ko unke prajatantr ke up raashtrapati or cabinet ke sadsy ke pad kii jimmedaariyon se mukt kar diya jaae
" tab zuma ne sansad ke sadsy ke pad se istipha de diya
 Following the Shack trial, Zuma was formally accused of corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority
 sthagan ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara daayar aavedan ke khaarij ho jane ke baad maamle ko petermarittsburg hai court se waapas le liye gaya
 Zuma's legal team continued to delay the action and despite Zuma's assertion that he wished to look into the matter in court, he managed to conceal some important evidence from the court that resulted in the prosecution's adjournment on the due date Had to file an application for 8 navambar 2007 ko supreme court of apil ne rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke paksh main apana nirnay sunaaya jo zuma ke raksha dal dwaara kiye hue vibhinn khoj or jabti sambandhi kaaryon ke sambandh main tha or unke dwaara kiye gaye chaar apilon ko kaarij kar diya gaya
 The decision was in relation to obtaining a personal diary of a senior member of a French arms company by the National Prosecuting Authority, which provided information related to Zuma's corrupt practices, possibly while awarding an arms deal
 28 disambar 2007 ko, scorpian ne zuma par ucch nyaayalay main thag-vyapaar, kaale dhan ko vaid karne, bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi ke vibhinn maamalon main abhiyog chalaaya
 a conviction and imprisonment of more than 1 year would have made Zuma ineligible for election to the South African Parliament and consequently he would have been disqualified for the presidency of South Africa
 4 agast 2008 ko zuma adaalat main haazir hue
 12 sitambar 2008 ko petermarittsburg nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke bataaya ki zuma par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope prakriyaatmak aadhaar par avaidh hai kyonki lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshaalay ne aarope lagane kaa nirnay lene se pehle zuma ko abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka nahi diya or rajya ko kanoonee bhugtan karne ke nirdesh die
 Nikholson also stated that, he believed that political interference played a role in the decision to file charges again against Zuma, although he did not explain why he dismissed the allegations against Zuma as invalid
 nikholson ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki unka nirnay zuma ke aparaadh yaa nirparaadh se sambandhit nahin tha, balki yah keval ek prakriyaatmak aadhaar par tha
 Various media reports have misinformed that the charges against Zuma have been dismissed
 maamla yah nahin tha
 The NDPP was able to re-accuse Zuma, however, only once he was given the opportunity to present a representation to the NDPP, based on the ndpp's decision to do so
 In paragraph 47 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson wrote, abhyavedan ko sunne kii baadhyataa audi alterum partem ke siddhant kaa ek hissaa he
 The requirement is that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision may be given an opportunity to make a representation with a view to achieving a favorable outcome
 The affected person should usually be informed of the essence or elements of the case to which he or she has to respond
 adaalat ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki NDPP ke samvidhan kii dhara 179 main ullikhit prakriya kaa paalan kar paane kii vifaltaa ne NDPP dwaara zuma par punah aarope lagane ke nirnay ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 Judge Nicholson found that various estimates could be made at the time of the allegations leveled against Zuma which corroborated the conclusion that it contained some degree of political interference by the executive branch of the government
 nyaayadhish nikholson apane nirnay ke para 210 main likhte hai, After the President's political defeat in Polokwane, the timing of the indictment by Mr Emsche on 28 December 2007 was the most unfortunate

 In Article 220 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson further wrote, raajnneetik hastkshep, dabaav yaa prabhaav ke sanketon se upar uth kar jo vyavhaar maine nirdhaarit kiye hai unamem ek chintajanak dhaancha he
 It began with the "political leadership" given by Minister Maduna to Mr
 Ngcuka when he refused to prosecute the applicant, whose crime was to talk to and meet with Thint representatives and other matters that i have referred to
 Given the rule of evidence, the court is bound to accept the conclusion that is least suited to the interest of the party who has special knowledge of the facts
 yah nishchit rup se yengeni maamle main ullikhit "suraag yaa suzav" ke raajnneetik hastkshep se adhik prabal he
 It is a matter of grave concern that such a process took place in New South Africa and prompted destruction under apartheid regime
 " The South African judiciary was severely criticized by Zuma's supporters before the hearing

 The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal against this decision
 thabo mabek ne petermarittsburg ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke nirnay par apil karne ke liye sanvaidhanik nyaayalay main ek halafanama daayar kiya: It was unfair for the court to come to such far-reaching "vexatious, scandalous and unfavorable" conclusions related to me, and to judge and condemn those conclusions based on the Zuma case

 yah vichaaradhin he
 " 12 janvari 2009 ko blomphontain ke supreme court of apil main is apil ke liye nirnay ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to decide on two aspects of the appeal
 The first aspect was whether Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before he decided to withdraw the bribery and corruption charges against him
 The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in understanding the political interference given by then President Thabo Mbeki in the context of the npa's decision to impose charges on Zuma
 NPA ke faisle kii samiksha ke dauraan abhyavedan aamantrit karne ke sawaal par harms deepi ne paaya ki nikholson dwaara di gai samvidhan ke 179 khand kii vyakhya galat thi kyonki NPA kaa aisa koi daayitv nahin tha or isliye ve zuma par aarope lagane ke liye swatantra tha joki usne kiya
 On the question of Nikholson's argument given by Mbeki about political interference, Harms DP found that "the lower court has violated its rights"

 The revelations were in the form of pieces of phone talk showing that Scorpion's president, Leonard mccarthy, and former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulleani Ngcuka, had conspired with Zuma about the timing of the prosecution, presumably Zuma's political The opponent was for the political benefit of President Thabo Mbeki

 Soon after the announcement of the NPA, however, at least two political parties reported that they would consider legal action on their own if the charges were dropped

 While Zuma filed his response tentatively, Ampshe delayed the hearing of the case, requesting two extensions to present the npa's response
 NPA ke pravaktaa mthunzi mahaaga ne kaha ki ve kagajaat daakhil nahin karenge kyonki "bakaayaa maamle" aise hai jinhen hal kiya janaa baaki he
 District, the Democratic Alliance party chief, argued that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and "they have no constitutional basis"
 While legal challenges continued, a June 2009 poll showed that more than half of South Africans believe that President Jacob Zuma is doing a good job
 june 2009 ke ant main TNS research studies dwaara kiye gaye chunaav main yah zaahir ho gaya ki zuma ke anumodan str main lagaataar sudhaar hua he

 In December 2005, Zuma was accused of raping a 31-year-old woman at her home in Forest Town, Johannesburg
 kathith peedita ANC ke ek mahatvapurn parivaar kii thi, vah zuma ke sangharsh ke dinon kediwangat saathi kii putree thi or ek aids kaaryakarta thi jise echivi positive se grasit mana jaataa tha
 Zuma denied the allegations and claimed that the sexual relationship was made by mutual consent
 aarope daakhil kiye jane se pehle hi, jaise hi navambar main balaatkaar ke aaropon ke bare main afvaahen udi, zuma kii raajnneetik sambhaavnaaen patan kii ore agrasar prathit hone lagi
 Most of his high level political supporters did not react to these new allegations in the same way that he had given against corruption charges

 Zuma also deserves condemnation from religious and secular groups when he declares that the ANC will rule South Africa until Jesus returns and it is God's will to continue the anc's rule: ishwar chahta he ki ham is desh par shashan karen kyonki ham ek maatr aisa sanghathan hai jiske banane ke samay padariyon dwaara aashirwad diya gaya tha

 yahi kaaran he ki ham tab tak shashan karenge jab tak yishu waapas nahin aate
 hame hamaare shaharon ko kisi or ke dwaara shashan karne kii anumati nahin deni chahie jab ham swayan sattarudh hai
 Zuma later defended his remarks by saying that they were "political expressions": "talking about Jesus is not an insult to his name; it is actually a historical saying," and that is the ANC
 ' yah sirf ek raajnneetik abhivyakti he ki ham majboot hai or ek lambey samay tak majboot rahenge

 lekin, march 2010 tak, nau maheenon apana kaarybhaar sambhaalane ke baad bhi, ve aisa karne main asafal rahe
 This led to increased pressure from opposition parties and ANC alliance partner COSATU to do so
 
 ANC pravaktaa bryan sokutu ne kaha ki zuma kaa "maamla vishesh" he kyonki unke "bade parivaar" ke kaaran unhen sampatti ghoshit karne main mushkil pesh aa rahi hai
 The ANC later distanced itself from this statement
 Zuma revealed his interests shortly thereafter
 2010 main, zuma ke angrakshakon ko kai janata or patrakaron se jude maamalon main shaamil ghatnaon main ulajhaa paaya gaya
 In February, Chumani Maxwell, a student from Cape Town, was detained by police for "indecent gesturing" towards Zuma's convoy

 yah deraa haryana ke jila karnal ke asandh se 3 kimi ke antar karnal road par jaisinghpura gaav main he a philosophical study of individual experiences and structures of consciousness is called phenomenology or phenomenology
 isaki sthapana 20veen shatabdi ke aarmabhik dinon main adamund haserl ne kii thi
 According to phenomenology, which had a profound influence on the twentieth-century Germanic philosophy, things attain their meaning through the realization of the consciousness of the person seeing them
 yah bodh itihaas, samskruti or isi tarah ke puri tarah se pramanit na kiye ja sakane vaale karkon kii dein hota he
 According to phenomenology, if these factors are separated from experience, then a pure subjectivity can be achieved at the level of knowledge
 is darshan ke sansthaapak german darshanik edmand hasar the
 He said that all kinds of consciousness are always intentional or intentional
 yani ham keval sachet nahin hote, balki kisi na kisi vastu ke prati sachet hote hai
 That object does not necessarily have to exist physically
 masalan, agar kisi ko lag rahaa he ki uske saamne ek nachlistaan maujuud he to vah ek marichika bhi ho sakati he
 In fact, that oasis, despite not being truly in front of the eye, is revealed to the viewer because of the meaningful connection he has made with it
 isiilie nachlistaan ho yaa uski marichika, vastu apane prekshak dwaara uske prati kii gayi apekshaayen puri kar paati he
 From this Hassar concluded that the experience of a person is not an affront to the work-cause relationship with the object
 ghatnakriyashastra ke vikaas ne darshan ke saath-saath samajashastreey or kala sambandhi chintan ko bhi kaafii prabhavit kiya
 Hassar's assistant and great philosopher Martin Heidegger took this concept towards understanding the meaning of existence and the structure of human existence
 hidagar ke alaava morris marali-ponti, jyaan-paul sartra kaa chintan bhi ghatnakriyashastra se prabhavit hua
 It is on this basis that phenomineological sociology was developed by Alfred Shuze
 ghatnakriyashastra kaa vikaas prakritik vigyaanon ke aadharbhoot siddhanton ke saath samvaad karte hue hua he
 Hassar's specialty was that he constantly reviewed his thinking and creations in the light of criticism and introspection, so he continued to develop this philosophy throughout his life
 kehane ke liye dekart or hasar kii bauddhik pariyojna ek hi thi
 Both wanted to free the knowledge base from the uncertainties
 lekin hasar kii yah vivechna darshanashastra ko dekart se aage kii manzil kii taraf le gayi
 Their aim was to develop an indispensable and definite way of seeing empirical objects
 dekart kii manyata thi ki ishwar or swayan ke astitv par shaq nahin kiya ja saktaa, par baaki har chiz par sanshay karnaa taarkik rup se sakvabhav he
 But instead of doubting a belief or faith, Hassar went towards identifying the undisputed element inherent in his nature
 unhone chetana kii prayek kriya ko parakhte hue yah jaanane kaa prayaas kiya ki kisi vastu ke anubhav kaa purv- kalpit ghatak koun sa he
 If this pre-conceived part is kept aside without deciding whether it is right or wrong, then the truth of that experience will not matter
 kinare rakhane kii kriya ko hasar ne apni bhashaa main ‘braketing’ or sahi yaa galat kaa faisalaa na lene ko ‘ipoki’ qaraar diya
 Citing the example of a tree, he said that if the daily preservation of a tree is restored, it will not change the tree-related experience that has been achieved through consciousness
 dekart kii thisis to us jagah ruk jaati he jahaan ve ‘main’ ke hone ko asandigdh yaa gyaan kaa kam se kam ek nishchit aadhaar maan lete hai
 Hassar suggested freeing someone's experience of being from the pre-imaginations contained in it
 chintan ke kshetra main yah ek radical kadam tha
 There are historical, cultural and material factors at the basis of the pre-made understanding associated with the experience of the object whose authenticity always remains under doubt
 agar kisi vastu yaa vyakti kii sachhee samaj banani he to use aitihaasik shai ke taur par nahin samajhnaa chahie, kyonki us surat main vah samaj purvagrahon or purv-dharanaon ke filtaron se chhan kar aayegi
 In this way the method of obtaining a definite knowledge of a pure and unchanging subjectivity in the form of phenomenology emerged
 1901 se 1913 ke bich prakashit hasar kii do rachanaayen logical investigations or idiaz partining tu a pyor finominolji and finominoljical filosphi is darshan kaa pramukh granth maani jaati hai
 The main problem of this influential theory of knowledge was how to remove it from the limits of being fascinated by philosophers
 rozmarra ke saamudayik jivan or samskruti ke jagat main gyaan-rachana kii ek swaabhaavik pravriti ke rup main isaki sthapana mushkil thi
 In his final work Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology published in 1938, Hassar tried to find a solution to this problem
 unhone prakritik vigyaanon ke siddhantaparak ravaiye kii kadi aalochana karte hue use vyaktiparak ravaiye ke barakes rakhaa
 He said that natural sciences put so much emphasis on work-cause relationship and quantitativeness that different motivations, beliefs and desires of an individual have no importance for them
 chetana ke sabhipraay hone kii thisis or viksit karte hue unhone kaha ki alag- alag ravaiyon ke aadhaar par log apni-apni duniyaaon kii samaj banaate hai
 The influence of Hassar and phenomenology in the field of aesthetics can be seen in the formulations of Roman Ingarden
 saahitiyik rachana ko ek sabhipraay vastu maan kar ingarden uski shinaakht uske kisi bhautik tatva ke aadhaar par karne se inkaar karte hai
 According to this view, literary work is endowed with a durable kind of identity independent of its diverse interpretations
 kriti kii samalochna karte hue pathak uske saar par dhyaan detaa he or us prakriya main kalpana-aadhaarit tattvon kii saamagree se vah thos nishkarsh nikaalata he jo lekhak dwaara anirdhaarit chhod diya gaya he
 Hassar's followers, influenced by the basic thesis of phenomenology, did not accept his sentimental attitude
 hasar kaa darshan jis prekshak ke anubhav par kendrit tha uske kamobesh amoort astitv ke mukaable hidagar or unke baad sartra ne apana chintan ek aise prekshak par kendrit kiya jiskaa taalluk ek vaastavik, bhautik or sparshy jagat se tha
 Hassar saw the meaning of experience as an essential and universal essence, while Heidegger interpreted that meaning as the result of experience while going through the practical problems of life
 hidagar ne kaha ki manushya hathode kaa jo istemaal karata he, usee ke mutabik uski samaj banaata he
 Therefore, ordinary human beings compose their knowledge by pursuing different goals instead of universal understanding made of phenomenology according to phenomenology

 In this, the mantra called Mutt was preached for many centuries
 isaki vidhi kriyaayein thim lekin sabakaa uddeshy yah tha ki shatru kaa pranant ho
 That is why people used to be very afraid of the exorcists who used to chant mantras and where there was strong opposition, there was a demand for such people
 jab kisi vyakti ko koi lanbaa yaa achaanak rog hota tha to andeh hua karata tha ki us par mantra kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the other party used to call Ojha to get rid of him and get him to do Maran or Ascendant against the enemy
 is prakaar donon ore se mantrayuddh hua karata tha
 When the peace of the disease or the enemy died, it was believed that it is the result of the use of mantra and as the number of such successes increased, the confidence of the people towards the exorcist was increased and the mantrasidhi The importance of jab asafalataa hoti thi to log samajhate the ki mantra kaa prayog bhalee bhanti nahin kiya gaya
 The Ojha people used to do such actions, which affected humans
 kriyaaon ko is samay hypnoticem kaha jaataa he
 Mantras, their method of pronunciation, various gestures, use of different types of substances, ghosts and dakini shakini etc

 He was also involved in fresco painting, perspective, drawing and painting, Dominico Ghirandaiah, who was the owner of the largest workshop in Florence at the time
 1488 main, 13 varsh kii umr main, ve grimandadaao ke prashikshu ban gayi
 The following year, his father inspired Grimmandao to pay Michelangelo as an artist, rare for a fourteen-year-old artist

 In those days, Michelangelo composed "madonna of the Steps" and "battle of the Centaurs"
 8 april 1492 ko lorenzo di 'medici kii mrityu ke baad maaikel angelo medici rajsabha ko chhodkar apane pita ke ghar laut aaye
 Between 1493 and 1499 he purchased a marble block and carved the statue of the Roman hero Hercules, which was sent to France
 20 janvari 1494 ko, baari barfbaari ke baad, lorenzo ke vaaris, piero di medici ne ek barf kii murti ko banane kaa aadesh diya
 Michelangelo returned to the Medici Rajya Sabha to make this statue
 usee varsh, girolamo savonarola ke badhate prabhutv ke parinamswaroop medici ko florence se nishkasit kar diya gaya tha
 Michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval and first moved to Venice then Bolona
 bolona me unhe saint dominic kii samadhi ko purn karne ke liye kai choti-choti murthiyan banane kaa kaam saunpa gaya
 By the end of 1494, Florence's political situation had calmed down

 In 1505, Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II and ordered the construction of the Pope's mausoleum, which included forty statues and was completed in five years
 pope kii sangrakshan ke tahat, maaikel angelo ne kai anya kaaryon ko puraa karne ke liye makbare par apane kaam par lagaataar rukaawat kaa saamana kiya
 Although Michelangelo had worked at the mausoleum for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction

 During the same period, Michelangelo painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel, which took about four years to complete
 kondivi ke anusaar bramate jo saint peter kii basilica ke nirmaan par kaam kar rahaa tha, pope ke makbare kaa kaa kaam maaikel angelo ko milane se asahmati tha
 He convinced the Pope to employ Michelangelo in a medium with which Michelangelo was unfamiliar

 Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which is a broad term that refers to any electronic data that accompanies the purpose of a signature, but not the use of a digital signature in all electronic signatures
 is done
 In some countries, including the United States and the European Union, electronic signatures have legal significance
 tathaapi, electronic hastakshar se sambandhit kanoon hameshaa yah spasht nahin karte ki kanoonee paribhaasha ko pare rakhte hue, kya ve digital beej-lekhan hastakshar ke arth main yahaan prayukt hai or isliye unka mahatv, kuch had tak bhraamak he
 Digital signatures implement a type of asymmetric cryptography
 ek asurakshit channel se preshit, ek upyukt rup se karyanvit digital hastakshar, praptakarta ko yah vishwaas dilaate hai ki sandesh, adhiyaachit preshak dwaara hi bheja gaya tha
 In many ways digital signatures are comparable to traditional handwritten signatures; Counterfeiting with a properly implemented digital signature is harder than a handwritten type
 yahaan prayukt arth main, digital hastakshar pranaliyaan gupt rup par aadhaarit hai or thik tarah se lagu kiye jane par hi ye prabhavi ho sakati hai
 Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation, meaning the signer cannot successfully claim that they have not signed the message, while simultaneously claiming that their private key is confidential; Also, some non-repudiation systems offer time stamps for digital signatures, so that once the private key is aware, the signature is still valid
 digital rup se hastakshith sandesh, bitstring ke rup main nirupaneey kuch bhi ho sakate hai: udaahranon main shaamil hai electronic mail, anubandh, yaa kisi anya gupt protocol ke madhyam se preshit sandesh
 a digital signature system typically consists of three algorithms: do mukhya visheshtaon kii aavashyaktaa he
 First, the signature and the corresponding public key must be verified by a signature generated from a fixed message and a fixed private key
 duusare, pariklit rup se nijee kunjee naa rakhane vaale paksh ke liye maanya hastakshar janit karnaa asaadhya hona chahie
 In 1976, Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman first described the notion of a digital signature system, although they only speculated that such a system could exist
 uske turant baad, ronaald revest, aadi shamir or len edalmen ne RSA elgorithadam kaa avishkaar kiya, jiskaa upyog aadim digital hastakshron ke liye kiya ja saktaa tha
 The first to offer a widely marketed software package for digital signatures was Lotus Notes 1
0, which was released in 1989, using the RSA algorithm
 buniyadi RSA hastakshron kii sanganana nimnatah he
 To generate an RSA signature key, one simply has to generate an RSA key pair containing modulus N, which is the product of two large prime numbers, with integers e and d such that ed = 1 mod φ, where φ is Euler phi- Is a function hastaksharkarta kii saarvajanik kunjee main n or e shaamil honge or hastaksharkarta kii gopneey kunjee main shaamil hoga d 
 To sign the message m, the signer calculates σ = md mod N
 The recipient checks to verify that σe = m is mod N
 jaisaa ki pehle ullekh kiya gaya, yah buniyadi pranali bahut surakshit nahin he
 To prevent attacks, one can first apply the confidential hash function to the message m and then apply the RSA algorithm described above to the fruit

 Other digital signature systems were developed after the RSA, with initials being the Lamport signature, the Merkle signature, and the Rabin signature
 1984 main, shafi goldvaisar, silviyo mikaali or ronaald revest ne sabase pehle digital hastakshar yojanaon kii suraksha apekshaaon ko yathatathy rup se paribhaashit kiya
 He described a hierarchy of invasive models for signature systems and introduced the GMR signature scheme, the first that could prove to be able to prevent even an existential forgery against a selective message attack
 sabase praarambhik hastakshar pranaliyaan ek jaisi thim: unamem kuutadwar kram-parivartan kaa upyog shaamil tha, jaise RSA phalnak, yaa robin hastakshar yojana ke maamle main, varg saapeksh sanyukt n pariklan
 ek kuutadwara kram-parivartan parivaar, kram-parivartanon kaa ek aisa parivaar he, jo aise prachal dwaara nirdisht hota he, jiskaa agravarti disha main pariklan aasaan he, lekin ulti disha main pariklan mushkil he
 However, there is a "trapdoor" for each parameter, which enables easy calculation in the reverse direction
 kuutadwar kram-parivartan ko saarvajanik-kunjee encripshan pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan prachal saarvajanik kunjee he or kuutadwar gopneey kunjee he or jahaan encripshan, agravarti disha main kram-parivartan ke pariklan se mail khaati he, jabaki dikripshan vipareet disha se mail khaati he
 Decoding permutations can also be seen as digital signature systems, where calculations in the opposite direction with the secret key are considered signatures, and further direction calculations are performed to verify the signature
 is sangatta ke kaaran, digital hastakshron ko aksar saarvajanik-kunjee kii gopneey pranaaliyon par aadhaarit ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he, jahaan hastakshar dicripshan ke baraabar he or satyaapan ancripshan ke anuroop he, lekin digital hastakshar pariklan kaa keval yahi ek tareeqa nahin he
 The signature system of this type, when used directly, is vulnerable to a key-only existential forgery attack
 jaalsaji karne ke liye, hamalavar ek yadrichhik hastakshar σ chunata he or us hastakshar se mail khaane vaale sandesh m ko jaanane ke liye satyaapan prakriya kaa upyog karata he
 In practice, however, this type of signature is not directly used, rather, the message being signed is first fragmented to produce a short abbreviation
 yah jaalsaji hamalaa, phir, keval hesh phalnak nirgamit karata he, jo σ se mail khaataa he, naa ki ek sandesh, jo us mulya kii ore le jaataa he, jo ek hamale kii ore agrasar nahin hota
 In a random authentic model, this hash and decrypted form of signature cannot be falsely phrased, even if it is a selective-message attack
 puure dastauez ke bajaay, is prakaar ke hesh par hastakshar ke kai kaaran maujuud hai
 In their foundational document, Goldwasser, Mikali, and Rivest introduced a hierarchy of aggressive models against digital signatures: unhone hamalaa parinaamon ke padanukram ko bhi varnit kiya he: Therefore, the strict notion of security is protection against existential forgery under an adaptive selective message attack
 sanchaar hetu digital hastakshar lagu karne ke liye kuch saamaanya kaaran neeche prastut hai: Although messages may often contain information about the existence of the message sender, that information may not be accurate
 digital hastakshron kaa upyog, sandesh ke strot ko pramanit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 When ownership of a digital signature's secret key is transmitted to a specific user, a valid signature indicates that the message was sent by that user
 preshak kii pramanikta main ucch vishwaas kaa mahatv vittiya sandarbh main vishesh rup se spasht he
 For example, suppose an instruction is sent by a bank branch requesting a change in the balance in the account to the central office
 agar kendriya karyaalay aashwast nahin he ki is tarah kaa sandesh vastav main ek adhikrut strot se bheja gaya he, to aise anurodh par karrwai ek badi galati ho sakati he
 In many cases, the sender and receiver of the message may need to believe that the message has not been changed during dispatch
 haalanki ancripshan sandesh kii saamagree ko chhupaati he, bina us ancrypted sandesh ko samajhe use badalanaa sambhav ho saktaa he
 However, if the message is digitally signed, any changes to the message after the signature will invalidate the signature
 iske alaava, ek maanya hastakshar ke saath nae sandesh ko utpann karne ke liye, sandesh yaa uske hastakshar ko sanshodhit karne kaa koi kargar tarika maujuud nahin he, kyonki adhikansh gopneey hesh phalnak dwaara ise abhi bhi pariklanaatmak taur par susadhy nahin mana jaataa he 
 All public key / private key confidential systems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret
 upyogkarta ke computer par ek nijee kunjee ko sangrahit or ek sthaneey kutashabd dwaara sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he, lekin iske do nuksaan hai: a more secure option is to store the private key on the smart card
 kai smart card hastkshep-pratirodhi taur par dizin kiye gaye hai 
 In a typical digital signature implementation, a hash computed from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU encrypts the hash using the user's stored private key and then returns the encrypted hash
 aam taur par, upyogkarta dwaara vyaktigat pahchaan sankhya yaa PIN code kii pravishti dwaara apane smart card ko sakriy karnaa hoga 
 It can be arranged that the private key is never removed from the smart card, although this cannot always be implemented
 agar smart card churaayaa gaya he, tab bhi chor ko digital hastakshar utpann karne ke liye PIN code kii jarurat hogi
 This reduces the security of the system to the security of the PIN, although an attacker must still have the card
 ek tasalli dene vaala pahalu yah he ki nijee kunjee, agar janit ho or smart card par sangrahit kii jaae, to aam taur par use copy karnaa mushkil mana jaataa he or manyata he ki uski keval ek prati maujuud rahati he
 Thus, the owner can find out about the missing of the smart card and the corresponding certificate can be canceled immediately
 nijee kunjee jo keval software dwaara sangrakshit hai, unki keval nakal taiyaar karnaa aasaan ho saktaa he or aise jokhimon kaa pataa lagaana zyaada mushkil hota he
 a numeric keypad is usually required to enter a PIN code to activate a smart card
 kuch card readeron main unke apane sankhyatmak kii-pad hote hai
 This is much safer than entering a PIN using an integrated card reader in the PC and then the computer's keyboard
 ek sankhyatmak kii-pad vaale reader prachhann shravan sankat se bachane ke liye banaae gaye hai, jahaan sambhavit taur par PIN code ko jokhim main daalate hue, computer ek kii-stroke logar chalaa saktaa he
 Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often EAL3 certified
 smart card dizin ek sakriy kshetra he or aisi smart card pranaliyaan hai, jo in vishesh samasyaon se bachane ke uddeshy ko liye hue hai, haalanki bahut kam suraksha ke saboot inke saamne hai
 One of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user is not able to "see" what he is signing
 upyogkarta aavedan, nijee kunjee kaa upyog karte hue digital hastakshar karne vaale elgoridam dwaara encript karne ke liye ek hesh code pesh karata he
 An attacker who regains control of the user's PC may possibly replace the user's application with a foreign application, ie the user's own communication with the attacker's communication
 isse ek durbhaavnapurna anuprayog dwaara upyogkarta ke mul dastauez ko on-screen par pradarshit karte hue, upyogkarta ko kisi bhi dastauez par hastakshar karne ke liye chaal chal saktaa he, jahaan hamalavar apane dastavej hastakshar karne vaale anuprayog ko pesh karata he
 For security in this scenario, an authentication mechanism can be set up between the user's application and the signed application
 saamaanya aashay he ki prayokta anuprayog or hastakshar karne vaala anuprayog, donon ke liye ek duusare kii satyanishthata ko satyapit karne ke liye koi madhyam uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 udhaaharan ke liye, hastakshar karne vaala anuprayog apeksha kar saktaa he ki uske paas aane vaale sabhi anurodh, digital takanic se hastakshrit binariyon se aaen
 Technically speaking, the digital signature applies to a string of bits, while humans and applications "believe" that they are signing interpretations of the meaning of those bits
 arthgat rup se vyakhyayit hone ke liye bit string ko aise rup main parivartit karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo maanav or anuprayogon ke liye sarthak ho or yah computer pranali ke hardware or software aadhaarit prakriyaaon ke sangyojan ke madhyam se kiya jaataa he
 The problem is that the interpretation of the meaning of bits can be converted as a function of the process of converting bits into semantic content
 jis computer pranali par dastauez sansaadhit ho rahaa ho, vahaan parivartan lagu karat hue digital dastauez ke vyakhya ko badalanaa apekshaakrit aasaan he
 In the context of meaning, this brings uncertainty about who was actually signed
 WYSIWYS kaa matlab he ki ek hastakshrit sandesh ke arth kii vyakhya nahin badali ja sakati he
 In particular it also means that a message cannot contain secret information that the signer is unaware of and that can be revealed after the signature is implemented
 WYSIWYS digital hastakshron kii ek vaanchhneeya visheshta he, jiske bare main aadhunik computer pranali kii badhati jatilta ke kaaran guarantee dena mushkil he
 The basic prerequisites shared in digital signature systems are that they must be meaningful - regardless of privacy principle or legal provision: yadi in sabhi sharton kaa paalan hota he, tab hi digital hastakshar vastav main ek pramaan hoga ki sandesh kisne bheja, atah unki saamagree ke prati unki sahmati hogi
 The law cannot change this truth of existing engineering possibilities, although in reality some of these have not been reflected
 vidhanmandalon ne, PKI ke sanchaalan se laabh kii pratyaasha rakhane vaale kaarobaaron yaa takneekee rup se agrasar logon dwaara puraani samasyaon ke liye nae samaadhaanon kaa samarthan karne waalon ke agrahon dwaara, kai kshetron main adhiniyamon tathaa / yaa viniyamon ko banaate hue digital hastakshron ke liye praadhikaar, pushtikaran, samarthan or anumati dekar, uske kanoonee prabhaav ke liye prabandh kiya he
 Some industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between industry members and regulators
 inamen shaamil hai, automobile udyog ke liye automotive network exange or swasthya udyog ke liye SAFE baio-pharma association
 In many countries, the digital signature status is somewhat similar to a traditional pen and paper signature
 aam taur par, in praavdhaanon kaa matlab he ki digital hastakshar kanoonee rup se dastauez par hastakshar karne vaale ko usamen ullikhit sharton se baandhte hai
 For this reason, it is often considered appropriate to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing
 By using an encryption key pair, a person can participate in an encrypted conversation, but encryption does not legally sign every message they send
 keval jab donon paksh kisi samjhaute par pahunchate hai, ve apane hastakshar kunjee ke saath qaraar par hastakshar kar sakate hai or keval us sthiti main hi ve kanoonee taur par vishisht dastauez kii sharton se bandhate hai
 After signing, the document can be sent over an encrypted link

 Scattered like dots of light at night in the cloudless sky, flickering lights show many stars
 kuch chamakate taron ke samooh akaash ko vibhinn bhaagon main baant dete hai
 The group of these stars is called the constellation
 puure akaash ko 89 taramandalon main vibhakt karke un taramandalon ke naam rakh die gaye hai
 The constellations of the zodiac are very famous, their nouns are Aries, Taurus etc
 kisi ek taramandal ke taron ko unke drishy kantimaan ke avaroh kram main chun liya jaataa he
 Asterisks are then named by placing Greek letters next to the constellation's name, such as the brightest star of the Aries zodiac named after the alphabet
 kuch taramandalon main taron kii sankhya itani adhik he ki greek varnmaala ke aksharon kii sankhya unke liye kam pad jaati he
 For naming such strings, we write the former Latin letters of the constellations and numbers if necessary
 kuch taare atiprakashit hone ke kaaran atiprasiddh hai tathaa unke naam taramandalon ke sandarbh ke bina bhi jane ja sakate hen, jaise lubdhak, magha, chitra aadi
 This type of nomenclature helps to identify strings
 khaali aankhon se dekhne par kuch taare adhik chamkile tathaa kuch kam chamkile dikhaai dete hai
 According to their radiance, we classify the stars into several radians
 taare hamase bahut adhik duuri par sthit hai
 We do not see less bright stars as the distance increases
 bina yantra kii sahaayta ke hamaari ankhen chathe kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakati hai
 The classification of radians is such that the stars appear brightest, their minimums are considered to be the minimum number of stars, less than that of bright stars, and so on
 kantimaan ke taare kii apeksha use purvavarti kantimaan taare kii chamak athwa 2
512 guna adhik hoti he
 In this way, the star of the first radiance is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the second radius and the star of the second radius is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the third radius
 yadi ham chathe kantimaan ke taare kii chamak 1 maan len, to pratham kantimaan se chathe kantimaan tak ke taron kii chamak 100:39

 mount palomar vedhashala ke 200 inch vyas ke paravarti doordarshee se ham 23 kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakate hai
 Current measurement means the measurement of the intensity of starlight
 pehle yah kaary vishesh prakaar ke photomeateron kii sahaayta se aankhon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 The records obtained in this way are called visual records
 ankhen pile prakaash kii sugrahi hai, at: drishyakantimaan pile or hare rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 Later the decoction was done with the help of photography plates
 is prakaar se gyaat kaantikan ko photography kantimaan kehete hai
 Photographic currents are measures of blue light
 taare kai rangon ke prakaash vikeern karte hai
 Therefore, the intensity of light is measured by sensitized plates of different colors and by the use of pigments to determine the strength of stars
 pile rang kii sugrahi platon par pile rangashodhakon se photography tathaa drishy kantimanon ke antar ko varna suchak kehete hai
 This determines the temperature of the wires
 kantimaan photograhi selon par prakaash ko grahan kar tathaa use bahugunit kar prakaash kii tivrata maapi jaati he
 While measuring current we also have to keep in mind the effect of the atmosphere and the effect of the interstellar dust and gases of the stars
 kantimaan ke yatharth gyaan se hamen taron kii dooriyaan tathaa bahut se bhautik padaartho ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 The personal light of many stars is very high, but due to being stationary at a great distance, their visible record is more visible
 yatharth kantimaan to tabhi gyaat ho saktaa he, jab ve upamaatr se samaan duuri par sthit hon
 All the stars are imagined at a distance of 10 parsecs, and the known value is called absolute value
 yadi hamen taare kaa drishy kantimaan gyaat ho tathaa uski duuri gyaat ho to ham nimnlikhit sutara se nirpeksh kantimaan jaan sakate hai: 5– 5 logarithmic distances are in the parsecs
 vilomat: yadi hamen nirpeksh kantimaan gyaat ho to ham taron kii dooriyaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 The absolute record of the Sun is 4
7
 kisi taare kii surya ke saapeksh kanti ko saapeksh kanti kehete hai
 In this, the radian of the Sun is assumed to be 1
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se ham taron se praapt honevaali urja kaa adhyayan karte hai, jisase unki bhautik sthitiyon ke adhyayan main sahaayta milti he
 No 8 no purnataya nirmal akaash main hamen drushti sahaayak yantron ke 3,200 se adhik taare nahin dikhalaai padate
 Since we can see only half of the sky, the number of microscopic stars is about 6,500
 inamen 20 stars brighter than 1,5 radiance 2 kantimaan tak chamkile 50 taare hai 150 stars up to 3 radiant 4 kantimaan tak chamkile 500 taare hai Tara 5 shines to 1500 bright stars shesh chakshudrishy taare chathe kantimaan ke he
 If we make our vision 10 times inward, then the number of visible stars will increase by 1000 times, that is, if the stars are assumed to be spread evenly, then their number will increase by six times their distance
 yah sambandh adhik chamkile taron tak hi simit he
 The number of stars known by the largest telescope in a lesser galaxy is about 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 taare kii vaastavik gati tathaa gamandisha gyaat karne ke liye ham uski gati ko do bhaagon main baant lete hai
 The angular value of the motion of the perpendicular direction on the sight is called the private motion of the star
 taron kii nijee gatiyaan kam hotin hai
 In order to find them we have to compare the photographs of stars taken in very distant times
 jo taare hamaare nikat hai, ve doorvarti taron ke saapeksh aage peeche hat jate hai
 By dividing this angular value by the interval of time, the individual speeds become known
 is koniya drushtisutra kii disha kii tarak gati ko traigy veg kehete hai
 To find the radial velocity, we take the spectrum of stars with the help of spectroscopy
 yadi varnakram rekhaayen nile chor kii taraf hati hon, to ham dopalar sidwant kii sahaayta se jaan lete hai ki tara hamaari ore aa rahaa he tathaa, yadi varnakram rekhaayen laal chor kii ore hati hon, to ham se dur ja rahaa he
 The transfer of lines is inversely proportional to their triangulation
 banard ne ophiukas taramandal ke ek dashm kantiman ke taare kii nijee gati 10
3 prati varsh gyaat kii he, jo vishaltam he
 Knowledge of private motion is helpful in the study of the stars and from this we also know that the stars of more blue motion are relatively closer to us
 traigy veg kaa surya ke saapeksh gyaan karne ke liye, hamen prithvi kii gati ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 The knowledge of private motion and radial velocity makes the actual speed and its direction known by the principle of force-parallel-quadrilateral
 taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye trikoshmetiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The star closest to us is also at such a distance that if we consider the diameter of the Earth as its base, then they seem to be parallel, that is, the parallax of the star is zero
 at: taron ke lamban ko gyaat karne ke liye hamen bade aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, we base the diameter of the Earth's orbit
 yadi ham kisi taare kii disha ke ek vedh ke chha: maheene baad uskaa vegh karen to hamen prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas kaa aadhaar mil jaataa he
 With this type of perforation, the nearest stars show slight changes relative to the distant stars
 ise nikaalte samay hamen taare kii nijee gati ke prabhaav par bhi vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Even then it is so low that the parallax of the nearest star is 76
 yadi kisi taare kaa lamban 1 ho to vah prithvi se prithvi kii kaksha kii trigya se 2,06,265 guni duuri par hota he
 This distance is called a parsec
 duuri maapne ke liye jis anya ikai kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah he prakashavarsh 
 The velocity of light is 1,86,000 miles per second
 is veg se prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tak jaataa he utani duuri ko ek prakaash varsh kehete hai yah duuri lagbhag 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 mile hoti he
 a parsec is about 3
26 light years
 trikoshmetiya vidhi se ham keval atyant samipsth taron kii dooriyaan hi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to find the distances of distant stars, we have to take shelter of other methods
 yadi ham kisi prakaar taron ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko jaan saken, to ham nirpeksh kantimaan sheershak main die gaye sutara kii sahaayta se unki dooriyaan gyaat kar sakate hai
 Fortunately, we have stars of Cefide and Lyra, whose absolute values we can find
 taron ke lambnon ko gyaat karne kii nimnlikhit anya vidhiyaan hai: These classifications have personal significance and they give us special help in the analysis of stars
 in vargikarnon kaa sankshipt parichay nimnlikhit he: The Sun is our nearest star, which we can study very well
 taron ke tatwon ke adhyayan se hamen adhikansh taare aise uplabdh hote he, jinka janm lagbhag usee samay hua jis samay hamaare surya kaa
 These stars are in descending sequence of temperature, shape and radiance
 is varg ko mukhya anukram kehete hai
 In this, the size of the stars of extreme heat will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about the tithe of the Sun
 surya isi anukram kaa ek majhole aakaar kaa tara he, jisaki dravyamatra tathaa taap ausat se kam he
 Upward stars in the curve of the main sequence are extremely rare
 is anukram ke adhikansh taare surya se chote tathaa kam taap ke hai
 The amount of elements available in them is like the Sun
 surya ke adhyayan se ham is varg ke atirikt taron ke do or mukhya varg he: daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed hai
 Dancing, and leftward stars
 daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed - daanavkaar, ati daanavaakar tathaa upadanavaakar 
 Extravagant stars are very large in size
 udaahranarth, jyeshtha kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa lagbhag 300 guna he
 In celestial stars, the diameter of the second beta pigassi of the Khagashv is 170 times the diameter of the Sun and that of the Brahmin is 12 times the diameter of the Sun
 upadanavaakar taare mukhya anukram tathaa daanav varg ke taara ke bich sthit hai
 Left-wing stars also have Vamana, Upavaman, Lalrang Vamana and white-vamana distinction
 in virgon main shwet vamanakaar taare apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Their specialty is that their mass volume is mid-range and less radiant, but their size is very small and their density is extremely high
 hamen jitne taare dikhaai dete hai, unamem atyadhik maatra main ve taare hai, jo hamaari gallexi ke sadsy hai
 Our Galaxy is a world in itself
 iskaa aakaar sarpil he
 There are many other celestials, which have a spiral shape
 unki rachana tathaa akruti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye hamen apni akashganga ke kuch vishesh prakaar ke taron ke adhyayan se sahaayta milti he
 There are mainly two classes of these stars
 kuch taare sadaa gallexi kii sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai tathaa anya gallexi ke nabhik ke nikat paae jate hai
 Among them, the stars of the first class are immediate neighbors of our Sun and the stars of the second class are away from the Sun
 walter wade ne pratham varg ke taron kaa naam pratham tara shrenee, athwa population pratham, tathaa duusare varg ke taron kaa naam dwitiya tara shrenee, athwa population dwitiya rakhaa he
 Both of these types of Taravargo vary in spectral-radius-curves
 pratham tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare nile rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan 7 athwa 8 hota he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare laal rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan - 3 yaa usase adhik hota he
 In the stars of the first star, there is an excessive amount of interstellar gas and dust, while in the stars of the second star it is very small
 in tarashreniyon ke adhyayan se hame gallexion kii sarpil bhujaaon tathaa nabhikon ko nishchit karne maatr ke hi liye nahin, kintu inase hamen taron kii utpatti tathaa vikaas kii sthiti kaa adhyayan karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Molecules of the mass of stars, which remain neutral in the atmosphere, become ionized due to the progressive increase in temperature and they lose more and more of their negative electrons
 iske prabhaav se aise taron ke varnakram main bananevaali chamakili or kaali rekhaon main vibhinnata aa jaati he
 In other words, the lines represent the different states of heat of the molecules that radiate the light of stars
 is prakaar taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se unke mukhya 10 bhed kiye gaye hai, jinhen roman lipi ke bade aksharon o, bi, e, epa, ji, ke, em, aar, en, tathaa es se vyakt karte hai
 Since alphabetical classification is related to temperature, the smaller alphabet a to e of the English alphabet is placed after o for strings of o spectrum and O, to show successive degradation of the temperature of the same class of stars
 Oba etc
 isi prakaar ke abhipraay ko vyakt karne ke liye bi se em ke varnakram ke taron ke liye unke suchak aksharon ke baad 0 se lekar 9 tak ke ank rakhe jate hai
 These are ionized helium stars
 inke varnakramon main ynikrut helium tathaa dohare tihare ynikrut oxigen tathaa nitrogen kii rekhaayen praapt hotin hai
 According to this ionized state, its surface temperature should be from 30, xxrep 4 0 to 40, xxrep 4 0 c or more
 o varnakram ke gyaat taron kii sankhya sau se adhik nahin he, jinamein adhikash nangi aankhon se nahin dekhe ja sakate
 The three stars of this class, Gama Beloram Oy, Zeta Pappis Oy and Zitaorayan, are Oi5 Chakshu Darshan
 ye udasin helium vaale taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 25,000 ° to 12,000 ° C
 yah taap yadhyapi helium ko ynikrut karne main asamarth he, tathaapi iske varnakram main ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen uplabdh hotin hai
 Helium and ionized oxygen lines begin to decrease in stars from the B5 star to the lower heat, and hydrogen lines and broad black absorption lines of hydrogen emerge
 hamaari tarasuchiyon main bi taare bahut hai
 These are the major stars of hydrogen
 inkaa prishthiya taap 12,000° se lekar 8,000° sein0 tak he
 Their number is very high
 kuch jyotishi inhe calcium taare kehete the

 12,000 ° g spectral stars have been identified
 inkaa prishthiya taap 5,000° se lekar 3,5000 sein° tak hota he
 Earlier they were known as Suryakalanka stars
 titonium oride taare
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,500 ° to 2,000 ° C
 inamen praaia: sabhi chal taare hai, jinamein keval chakshudrishy koi nahin he
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,000 ° to 5,000 ° N
 ye sabhi daanavaakar tathaa adhikanshat: chal taare hai
 These are very few in number
 inamen se koi bhi tara keval chakshu se saraltapurvak drishy nahin he
 There are some stars whose radiance keeps decreasing
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 In order to give clear instructions of movable stars, big letters of English alphabet R, S, t etc
 are placed in front of the constellation, like r SETI etc
 inaki sankhya badhane ke saath ek akshar ke sthaan par do athwa teen akshar bhi rakhane pad sakate hai, yatha aar aar lira aadi
 About 20,000 movable stars are known and they are weighed regularly
 taron ke do vishaal varg hai: pehla bahyahetuk chal tathaa doosraa swat: chal
 Extraterrestrial moving stars are receptive pair stars
 inamen algul tara prasiddh he
 Its normal record is 2
2, but it goes up to 3
4
 swat: chal taare teen shreniyon main rakhe ja sakate hai: sapandansheel chal, visphotak chal tathaa anya chal taare
 Some of these stars have a rotation period of less than a day
 aise taare aar aar lira varg ke hai
 The rotation period of some is from 1 to 50 days
 aise taare sefiid varg ke taare hai
 The rotation period of some stars ranges from 100 to 1000 days
 inhen dirdh aavartkaalik taare kehete hai
 The stars of this class are red colored stars
 kuch taare ardhniyamit chal hai, inkaa chakra 40 se lekar 150 din tak kaa he
 These stars are also red colored stars
 inamen aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taare atyant mahatvapurn hai
 r Lyra stars got its name because all of these properties are similar to the moving star described in Lyra Planetarium, which was named RR Lyra
 naam se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki aise taare keval lira taramandal main hi hote hai, kintu is shrenee ke taare hamaari gallexi tathaa anya tarapranaliyon aadi main sarvatra hai
 The reason for the importance of these stars is their distancing
 aar aar lira varg ke taron main aavartankaal ke badhane par par bhi unke nirpeksh kantimaan main antar nahin padataa
 This means that if one of the galaxial stars has RR Lyra stars, they will be of the same absolute radius and it is almost equal to zero of the same absolute radius
 aisi avasthaa main unke drishy kantimaan ke gyaan se unki duuri nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat ho sakati he
 Absolute radius = visual radius + 5 - 5 logarithmic distance inkaa yah naam isliye padaa ki inaki prakruti delta sefius, athwa chartuth kapish, kii tarah kii he
 The fourth Auburn is the brightest star in the Cepheid category, which can be seen from the eye
 sefiod taron kaa aavartankaal ek din se kuch adhik se lekar 45 din se kuch adhik he
 Our galaxy's cepheid stars often have a 7-day rotation period
 sefiid taron kii sabase badi visheshta he inkaa aavartankaal-kanti-saahchary niyam se sangat hona
 This means that as the growth period of the cepheid wires increases, their absolute value increases
 yah sambandh atyant mahatvapurn he
 With its help, the distance can be determined by the previous formula by knowing the absolute value of the safe stars
 sefiid taron kii sahaayta se taragucchon tathaa tarapaddatiyon kii duuri gyaat kii jaati hai
 The reason for the change of thermogenic color is generally assumed to be the flutter principle, which means that the rotation of the surface of the cepheid wires causes growth and depletion, causing the star to expand and shrink sequentially
 vastut: spandan siddhant sabhi sthitiyon kaa yatharth uttar nahin detaa
 Therefore, nowadays astrologers are beginning to understand that the different positions of cefoid stars are due to the change of their temperature, which itself is an iterative cycle
 1,000 se adhik sefiid taare gyaat he
 Such wires explode regularly or irregularly
 ye taare saamanyat: atyant dhundle hote hai, kintu visphot hone ke baad inaki kanti atyant asaadhaaran rup se bad jaati he
 After this situation lasts for a few days, the stars fall into their normal radius
 is prakaar ke taron ko navtara kehete hai
 In 1918, the glow of the Navatar of Aquila Tarapunja had increased by forty thousand times within four days
 anya prasiddh navtare hai: parasyus taramandal kaa navtara, 1925 i0 victoris navtara tathaa 1934 i0 kaa harkulis taramandal kaa navtara
 Those who become very exceptionally bright after the Navatarite explosion are called Atinavatara
 1885 i0 ke andromida niharika ke atinavtaare ne chah dinon main itnaa adhik prakaash vikeern kiya ki surya kadachit utane prakaash ko 10 lakh varsho main vikeern kar paaegaa
 Other types of moving stars are often of irregular rotation
 kisi svachh raatri main akaash main kuch dhundle prakaash ke dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 If we look at them with powerful instruments, then we find three types of things: star flakes, nebulae and galaxies
 niharikas chamakili gaison se bani hai tathaa aakashgangaayen hamaari gallexi kii tarah swatantra tarapranaliyaan hai
 There are two types of star flakes, one that is available in the sky-like plane, or near the celestial spiral arms
 aise guchchhe akashgangeey guchchhe kehalaate hai
 The number of stars in these is relatively less
 is prakaar ke varg main krittika tara guchchhe atyadhik chamkila tathaa bada he
 The globular globules lie away from the spiral arms and near the nucleus
 golakaar taragucchon main apekshaakrit atyaadhik taare rahete hai
 They are often seen with a twist
 inhen doordarshiyon se hi dekha jaataa he
 The Ombanga Sentari and 47 Tukane Panchal Kantiman, Chakshudhishyas, are related to the population of the spherical galaxy
 avashya hi inase taron ke vikaas kii avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he
 The distance of the cluster is determined with the help of the RR Lyra and cepheid wires present in these wires
 inke adhyayan se gallexi ke swaroop ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Most stars are double, or majority, they do not have anything interconnected in pairs of stars, but they appear very close because they are located towards our line of sight
 aise taron ko chakshush, dohare taare kehete hai
 Such stars are few
 adhikansh taare vastut: ek yaa adhik taron ke saath hai
 Two stars, which travel in a certain type of longitudinal path with mutual attraction, are called star-pairs
 yah nishchay ho jane par ki koi tara vastut: yugma hai, ham uske sambandh kii bahut si baaten gyaat kar sakate hai, kyonki uski, athwa uske saathi tara kii, gati vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kaa paalan karti hai
 The speed and mass of the pair wires can be determined with certainty
 yugmatare mukhyatya teen prakaar ke hote hai: drishy, grahauakari tathaa varnakrameey 
 To know the class of visual pair, one has to weigh their distance and angle of view
 adhikansh drishy yugmataron kaa parikramankal bahut lanbaa hota he, jise gyaat karne ke liye saikadon varshon tak vegh kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, although more than 25,000 visual pairings have been known, the knowledge of more than 200 orbits is not yet known
 grahauakari yugmatare ke sahchar kii kaksha praaia: hamaari drushtirekha kii disha main thode se jhukaav se rahati he, jisase ek tara duusare ko purnataya yaa khandash: dhak letaa he or isse ek taare kaa prakaash hamen dikhaai nahin padataa
 This allows the pair to be identified, because in normal conditions, the amount of light that this star has remains at the time of eclipse decreases
 yah grahan kii sthiti niyat samay se hotin hai
 In such strings, the Beta percussion, that is, Algool, is very famous
 saamaanya avasthaa main iskaa kantimaan 2
2 hota he, ja grahan ke samay 3
4 rah jaataa he
 After the eclipse, its record becomes 2
2 again
 kuch yugmataron ke sahchar kii kaksha kaa samtal prithvi ke sameep se nahin jaataa, at: ham uske grahan kii sthiti nahin dekh sakate hai
 But by changing the lines of its spectrum, we get to know that this star sometimes comes towards us and sometimes goes away from us, so that it is clear that it is flying around an invisible star
 aise taare varnakrameey yugmataron kaa parikraman kaal kam hota he
 Classes of about 309 spectral stars have been known
 taron ke aakaar praaia: teen vidhiyon se jane jate hai: From absolute temperature and temperature, grahauakari yugmataron ke grahankaal se tathaa By interferometer
 pratham vidhi plank ke nimnlikhit sutara par aadhaarit he: View Absolute Record Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 jahaan r = taare kii trigya he
 The radius relative to its orbit becomes known by the time of eclipse of the eclipse star
 vyatikaranmaapi se taare kaa koniya vyas gyaat ho jaataa he tathaa isaki duuri gyaat hone se iskaa saral rekhaatmak vyas bhi gyaat ho jaataa he
 On the basis of the diameter of the stars, their names are donated and left
 taron kii dravyamatra gyaat karne kii pratyaksh vidhi yugma taron ke sahachaar kii gati kaa adhyayan karne se praapt hotin hai
 The mass quantities of these stars are determined with the help of the law of gravitation
 kisi bhi vaaman taare kii dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke dashamansh se kam nahin uplabdh hui hai, tathaa surya se 10 guni se adhik dravyamatra ke taare bhi viral hi hai
 Density of a star = mass / volume
 is prakaar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki daanavaakar taron kaa ghanatv atyant kam hota he tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa atyadhik
 The diameter of a giant star like Jyeshta is 480 times the diameter of the Sun, even if its mass is no more than 20 times the mass of the Sun
 parinamat: iskaa ghanatv surya ke ghanatv ke 
 xxrep 7 0 2 se bhi kam he
 It is also much lower than the density of ordinary air
 shwetavaman taare sirium bi kaa, jisaki trigya surya kii trigya kii 
034 tathaa dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra kii 86 he, ghanatv itnaa adhik he ki uske dravya ke ek ghan inch kaa bhaar ek ton hoga
 Normally with the help of a photometer, by comparing the density of different colors of starlight with the density of colors already known in the laboratory, the surface temperature of stars can be determined
 kintu iske nishchit rup se gyaat karne kii sarvottam vidhi he, unke prakaash kaa varnakrameey vishleshan
 On the basis of this, there is a spectral classification of stars, which literally signifies their temperature
 taare apni urja nabhikeey abhikriya se praapt karte hai
 Due to the heating of the star's nucleus, the hydrogen atoms of the stars are converted from the nucleus to the atoms of helium
 iske parinaam swaroop taron main atyadhik taap kii utpatti hotin hai, jise ye prakaash ke rup main vikeern karte rahete hai
 They have to lose very little power to generate a lot of energy

 The atmosphere of stars is also studied by the lines of the spectrum
 surya ke vayumandal ke adhyayan se hamen pataa chalaa he ki isamen hydrogen atyadhik maatra main hai
 The second place is of helium
 anya tatv kam maatra main hai, tathaapi magnesium or oxigen ke parmaanu nishchit rup se vidyaman hai
 Of the known chemical elements, 61 elements have been identified in the Sun's atmosphere
 adhikashan taron kaa vayumandal surya sareekha he, tathaapi sabhi taron kaa vayumandal bilkul ek sa nahin he
 There is a difference between the amounts of carbon and oxygen in them
 taron ke mul tatwon ko unke varnakram kii rekhaon ke adhyayan se janaa jaataa he
 In the laboratory, the spectrums of the different basic elements are taken, and by matching them to the spectrum of the stars, the basic elements available in the stars are identified
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki ausat taron main lagbhag 70 heidrogen, 28 helium, 1
5 carbon, nitrogen, oxigen tathaa niann or 0
5 loh varg ke tathaa anya baari tatv hote hai
 The heavy element population first wires have about 3 and the population second ones have less than 1
 taron kaa janm taron ke antarvarti gas tathaa dhul ke kanon se hota he
 The electrophoresis of gas clouds usually remain in a neutral state, but when a very hot star moves near them, they ionize and move and form a nucleus, attracting the masses of gas and dust around them
 Starts wearing huge forms
 gati tathaa sankochan se nabhik kaa taap badhane par, inamen nabhikeey abhikriya prarambh ho jaati he, jisase ye prakaash urja ko vikeern karne lagate tathaa hamen nae taron ke swaroop main dikhalaai dene lagate hai
 Studies of the energy radiations of various types of stars have shown that the stars of Population II are very ancient and the stars of Population i are relatively later
 taron ke jivan se taatpary unke prakashmay jivan se hota he
 The basis of the light of stars is their reserves of hydrogen, from which they receive heat energy by nuclear reaction
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile hai, swabhaavat: ve apane hydrogen ke bhandar kaa adhikadhik upbhog karke use adhik shighrata se helium main parivartit karte rahete hai
 Although stars can regain their heat energy for many years by shrinking their hydrogen reserves, their main basis of life depends on their hydrogen intake
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile dikhalaai dete hai, unka jeevankaal 109 varsh ke lagbhag tathaa mukhya anukram ke dhundle taaro kaa jeevankaal 1013 varsh ke lagbhag hota he
 The life of the Sun is about 1010 years
 apane chaaron ore faile hue taramay vishwa ke rahasy ko jaanane kii hamaari ichha bahut puraani he
 By studying the stars, we have found the world to be full of many galaxies like the Galaxy
 laal rang kii ore rekhaon ke sthanrann dwaara hamane taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se itnaa jaan liya he ki hamaara vishwa fail rahaa he
 However, due to our limited means, we have not been able to know the true form of the world
 hamaare vishwa kaa kitna vistaar he failata hua vishwa kis seemaa tak fail saktaa he vishwa kii vakrata kisi he, tathaa vakrata trigya kya he ye sabhi prashan abhi tak vivaadaaspad hai tathaa in vishyon main hamaara koi nishchit sarvasammat siddhant nahin he

 He had a very tall, bold face and a muscular body
 umr makka ke mashhoor pahalawaanon main se ek the, jinka puure makka main bada dabadabaa tha
 Umar used to participate in the annual wrestling matches
 armbh main hazarat umr islam ke kattar shatru the
 And wanted to kill Muhammad sahib
 umr shuru main but parasti karte the
 Omar was from a rich family in Mecca, a very brave and courageous person
 umr musalamaanon ko pasand nahin karte the, naa hi mohammad sahab ke mishan ko
 But Prophet Muhammad sahab went to Kabaa one evening and prayed to Allah that Allah should give Umar or Amr Abu Jahl to both of you who are dear to you
 yah dua umr ke haq main qabool hui
 Omar had once set out with the intention of killing the Prophet, a man named Naeem was found on the way who told Omar that his sister and her husband had brought Islam
 umr gusse main aakar bahan ke ghar chal diye
 Both of them were studying Quran at home
 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Omar became angry and started killing them both
 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake
 kaha ki main kuran padhanaa chahta hoon, isko apamaanit nahin karuunga vaayada kiya
 When Omar read the Quran, he said that it is the declaration of God that no human being can be created
 ek chamatkaar kii tarah se umr kuran ke satya ko grahan kar liya tathaa mohammad sahab se milane gayi
 Muhammad Sahab was very happy when Omar entered Islam
 musalamaanon khushi kii lahar daud gai umr ke islam laane par
 Omar announced that now everyone will study together in the Namaz Kabe, which no one could have imagined earlier
 umr islam ke shatru the parantu ab vah islam ke sarankshak ban gayi
 Seeing Omar in Islam created a furore among Muhammad's enemies
 ab islam ko umr naam kii ek tej talwaar mil gai thi jisase sara makka tharrata tha
 The Meccans hurled their sobs at the weak Muslims, upon which Muhammad sahab prayed to Allah, then Allah ordered him to go to Medina
 saare musalmaan chhupakar madeene kii taraf hizrat yani pravaas karne lage
 But Omar was very courageous, took his sword, took a bow and shot, reached near the Kaaba and did a tawaaf, read two rakat hymns and then said "who wants to make his mother cry on himself, orphan his children and widow his wife
" Meet the place
 " kisi kaa saahas nahin hua ki umr ko roke

 Sun Hijri created the Islamic calendar which is called the Almanac of Islam
 624 i main musalamaanon ko badr kii jang ladanaa padaa jisamen hazarat umr ne bhi aham kirdaar nibhaayaa
 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated
 badr kii jang ke ek saal baad makka vaale ekajute ho kar madeene pe hamalaa karne aa gaye, jang uhud naamak pahari ke paas hui
 In the beginning of the war, the Muslim army was heavy but due to some reasons the Muslims were defeated
 kuch logon ne afvaah uda di ki mohammad sahab shahid kar diye gayi to bahut se muslim ghabara gaye, umr ne bhi talwaar phenk di tathaa kehane lage ab jeena bekaar he
 After some time i came to know that this is a rumor and then stood again

 Omar led the Muslim army and finally Mecca also conquered
 iske baad bhi kai jangon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, umr ne un sabhi jango main netratav kiya
 On 8 June 632, Muhammad Sahib said goodbye to the world
 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he
 On hearing this news, Umar lost his senses, took out his sword and started saying loudly that i will separate his head from the person who said that the prophet has died
 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
 Hazrat Abu Bakr wrote his will to Hazrat Usman before his death that Omar would be his successor

 More than two-thirds of the non-tribal population of India uses some language of the Hindu Aryan language family at different levels

 Bhima Nayaka, the son of Seva Lal's father Ramji Nayak, was a very big businessman
 unhen lagbhag bhartiya sabhi bhashaaon kaa gyaan tha
 Their total wealth consisted of 4000 to 5000 cows and bullocks
 jiskaa upyog anaaj kii yatayaat ke liye kiya jaataa tha or wo 52 taandon ke ke nayak the
 He was called Naikada
 a village had a population of around 500
 har tande ke liye ek purush or ek stri gore dharm prachaarak ke rup main kaam karte the, unhen baavann bheru or 64 joganni kehete the
 There used to be a union of these 52 Bheru and 64 Jogani
 or ye mukhya nayakda ke antargat kaayam karte the
 That is why Saint Seva Lal's grandfather was called Ramshagh Nayak
 bhima nayak bhi 52 taandon ke sanghapramukh the
 Historical documents have shown that Bhima Nayak with the British cost 2 lakh rupees
 Had a merchant agreement
 is baat se saaf pataa chalaata he kii, sevaalaal kaa janm vaibhav sapann ghar main hua tha
 Apart from this, a lot of false stories are heard about his birth
 sevaalaal kii maan kaa naam dharamni tha jo ki jairam badtiya kii suputree thi
 After the marriage of Bhima Nayak, he had no child for almost 12 years, later Saint Sevlal was born after the worship of Mother Mother
 sangh ke paramparik niti ke nusaar swaraksha or anaaj kii raksha ke liye yauddhaon kii nirmiti kii jaati thi
 Keeping the same in mind, Sevlal formed a confederation of 7 Sanghatanaikas in which Sevlal himself, his three brothers, Hapa Badu, Pura and Dharmi, Dhaka, Ramsang were also together
 isi sanghatan ko baad main 6 sangh nayakon ne apanaaya
 In this way a federation of 13 people was formed? Which led to 700 Tando comprising of Madhyabharata, Dakshin Bharat
 madhyabhaarat ke vyapaaree bhagavaandaras vadtiya kulsampatti 2 lakh bail) or dakshibharat ke vyapaaree jangi, bhangi bhukiya sevaalaal ke sangh main samavisht hue
 According to the state position of the 17th century, we can say that, the influence and power of the British power was increasing day by day and the system of Indian kings was getting weaker
 angreji hukumat kaa gore banjaaraa vyapaaree par raajaaon ko rasad pahunchane ke khilaaf dabaav badhate ja rahaa tha
 And the British tax-affected Gor Banjara merchants were being charged with tax collection which was against the merchant rules of Gor Banjara
 is kar vasuli ke khilaaf prastaav lekar sevaalaal apane sabhi sangh nayakon ke saath nizaam se milane gayi
 Fearing the British rule, the Nizam turned down the proposal, in view of this Sevlal declared war against the Nizam
 phir hyderabad main yuddh hua or parinamswarup nizaam ne sevaalaal kii sabhi sharte manjur kii or bharat ke anya rajyon ke karpranali ke liye dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ko milane kii salaah di
 Sevlal accepted the Nizam's advice and accepted the honor given by the Nizam
 sammaan ke taur par nizaam ne tamrapatr, talwaar or bhetwastu di
 These Bhetavastuans still exist in the Pohragadh temple
 dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ne is prastaav ko naamanjur kiya, parinaam swarup sevaalaal ne yuddh kaa elaan kiya, gulam khan ke 25000 sainikon kaa muqabla sevaalaal ke 900 yauddhaon ne kiya
 Historians never mentioned this war, Ghulam Khan lost heavily
 gulam khan ne karpranali ko maaf karne ko manjur kiya
 This was a huge political victory for Sevlal from a business point of view
 is jeet ke chalate sevaalaal kaa naam puure bharat varsh main prasiddh hua
 Gaurbanjara of Lahore honored Sevlal
 jaipur ke banjaaraa vyapaaree or bahujan logon kii pukaar par sevaalaal ne bhumia naamak dahshatagrast kaa shirched kiya or rajasthanvaasiyon ko bhumia se mukti dilaai
 Even today, this is a sign of Sevlal's Mandir at Sawai Mansing Hospital in Jaipur
 dilhisthit rysina hill lakishon banjaaraa ne sevaalaal ke swaagat main banaai hui chhatri nehru planitorium, nai dilli main maujuud he
 Similarly, there is still Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Sevanamak village near Mumbai, where Sevalal Port used to be in the 17th century
 vaise hi dharmtar naam kaa port raigarh jilhe main pen ke paas maujud he
 Similarly, not even Bhaucha in Mumbai is Sevabhaya's push
 is jagah par portuguese kaa jahaaj fas gaya tha use sevaalaal ne nikaala, falswarup unhen motiyon kii maala diya gaya, isi vajah se sevaalaal motivalo ke naam se bhi jane jate hai
 Sevlal had a merchant center in the village named Gagode near Paan in Rayagada district where the Mandir of his name still exists
 sevaalaal bahut bade vyapaaree, yauddha, sangatak, arthtajna to the hi lekin uske saath ve bahut bade samajasudharak the
 The strength and wisdom of Sevlal can be ascertained from the fact that the prophecies that Sevlal had about the social and economic and natural state of India are coming true after 250 years

 In thermodynamics and physicochemical, thermodynamics is the study of the energy produced or exploited in a chemical reaction
 ushmarsayan main praaia: urja ke shoshan yaa utsarjan ke parinamswaroop hone vaale bhautik parivartan aadi) kaa bhi adhyayan shaamil he
 Along with this, heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of manufacture, enthalpy and free energy are also calculated
 saadharantaya kisi pratikriya main kshepit yaa shoshit ushma ko uske sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar dete hai
 for example : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories It is dissolved that when combining with 1 gram-molecule hydrogen gas and 1 gram-molecule chlorine gas, when 2 gram-molecule hydrochloric acid gas is formed, 44,000 calories of heat are lost
 isi prakaar nimnaankit sameekaran dekhie : H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories dwaara yah prakat hota he ki yadi 2 gram hydrogen tathaa 254 gram iodine gas ke sangyojan se 256 gram hydrogen iodide gas banaai jaae to is pratikriya main 11,860 calories ushma shoshit hogi
 It is clear that the amount of heat absorbed in any activity will depend on the physical state of the substances participating in it; That is why it is also written
 bhautik avasthaa kaa jo prabhaav pratikriya-ushma par padataa he vah nimnaankit udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega : And dwitiya sameekaran main ushma kii kshepit maatra pratham samikarnon kii apeksha adhik he kyonki isamen 18 gram bhaap ke dravit hone main kshepit ushma kii maatra sammilit he
 For reactions in which the volume of the reactors also changes, the reaction heat will also depend on whether the reaction is done at constant volume or at constant pressure
 yadi pratikriya karte samay aaytan sthir rakhaa jaae, to mandal ko bahya daab ke viruddh kuch kaary nahin karnaa padataa
 Therefore, at constant volume, the real energy of the reaction is absorbed or absorbed
 parantu yadi kriya karte samay daab ko sthir rakhte hue aaytan ko badhane yaa ghatane diya jaae, to pratikriya-ushma kaa yatharth maan gyaat nahin hoga
 for example; In increasing the volume, the board works against external pressure, which will have energy expenditure; Therefore, if the reaction is exothermic, the amount of radiation will be reduced at this stage
 saadhaarant: pratikriyaaon kii ushma sthir aaytan par hi naapi jaati he
 From the thermodynamic point of view, reactions are often divided into several classes and are named reaction-heat to suit the reaction nature - such as solution-heat, dilution-heat, production-heat, combustion-heat, and relaxation-heat
 kisi viley ko vilaayak main gholne par praaia: ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The salts that react with water to form hydrated salts, most of the heat is absorbed when they dissolve
 anya lavenon ke ghulne main kshepit ushma kii maatra bahut kam he
 The amount of energy absorbed or absorbed when a gram-molecule of a substance is dissolved in a solvent is called solution-heat
 iske atirikt sandra vilyan ko tanu karne main bhi ushma main parivartan hota he or ise vilyan kii tanukaran-ushma kehete hai
 The volume of dilution-heat decreases with the dilution of the solutions and can be considered as zero for more dilute solutions
 aise tanu vilyanon kii ushmarsayan main "jaleey" kehete hai
 for example; Potassium nitrate dissolves in water to form a highly concentrated solution, so its solution heat is 8,500 calories
 is tathy ko nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : The amount of heat that is absorbed or absorbed in the formation of a gram-molecule of a compound by the addition of element elements is called the production-heat of that compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnaankit samikarnon dwaara spasht he ki carbon dioxide, methen, tathaa nitric amla kii utpaadan-ushma kramnusaar 94
4, 18
8 tathaa 42
4 calories he : Production heat can also be negative, such as: aavyav tatwon se jin yogicon ke banane main ushma kshepit hoti he unhen ushmakshepak yogic kehete hai or jin yogicon ke banane main ushma shoshit hoti he unhen ushmashoshak yogic kehete hai
 Most compounds are exothermic, such as hydrogen, chloride, water, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride, etc
 are all exothermic compounds
 ushmashoshak yogicon ke udhaaharan hydrogen iodide, carbon dicelaphid, aesetilin, ozone aadi die ja sakate hai
 Thermodynamic compounds are much less stable than exothermic compounds and are easily dissected into their elemental elements
 ushmakshepak or ushmashoshak yogicon ke sthayitv kaa uparyukt bhed unamem antarnihit urja ke antar ke kaaran hota he
 for example; When 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide is formed by combining 1 gram-molecule carbon and 1 gram-molecule oxygen, 94,300 calories of heat are absorbed
 spasht he ki apane avyav tatwon kii apeksha 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide main 94,300 calories urja kam hogi
 Similarly, in a calorific compound like carbon disulfide, it will have 22,000 calories more energy than its element elements
 yadi samast tatwon kii antarnihit urja ko shunya maan liya jaae, to upyukt vivechan se spasht he ki yogicon kii antarrihit urja unki utpaadan ushma ke baraabar hogi; parantu yadi utpaadan urja rinatmak he to antarnihit urja dhanatmak hogi or iske vipareet yadi utpaadan ushma dhanatmak ho, to antarnihit urja rinatmak hogi
 For example, the underlying energies of carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide would be equal to 94,300 and 22,000 calories respectively
 kisi tatv yo yogic kii 1 gram-anu maatra ko oxigen main sthir aaytan par purnataya jalaane se ushma kii jo maatra kshepit hoti he, use us tatv yaa yogic kii dahan-ushma kehete hai
 For example, it is clear from the following equation that combustion-heat of methane is 2,12,800 calories: carbon ko oxigen main jalaane par do yogicon kaa bananaa sambhav he- It is worth noting that the combustion heat of carbon is 94,300 calories, not 26,000 calories, because carbon is completely burned or oxidized in the first act itself
 duusari kriya main carbon, carbon monoksaide main parivartit ho gaya he, parantu abhi uskaa dahan purna nahin hua kyonki carbon monoksaide kaa or dahan karke use carbon dioxide main oxykrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a special type of colorimeter is used to find combustion heat called bomb-colorimeter
 vaigyanik barthelon ne ise sarvapratham 1881 main banaaya tha
 This gunmetal is made of steel and is of cylinder shape
 iske aantarik tal par ek vishesh prakaar kaa inaimal chadhaa rahata he, jisase usapar oxigen kii koi kriya nahin hoti
 It has strong screws to firmly close the lid
 jis padaarth kii dahan-ushma nikaalnaa ho uski ek nishchit maatra platinum kii pyaali "pa" main le lee jaati he or bam main lagbhag 20-25 vayumandaleey daab par oxigen bhar lete hai
 After this, close the vam firmly and keep it in an ordinary colorimeter
 saadhaaran calorimapak main jal kii ek nishchit maatra le lee jaati or prayog dwaara pehle hi yah nirdhaarit kar liya jaataa he ki is calorimapak main jal ke taap ko 1 degree centegrade badhaane ke liye kitni ushma kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The temperature of the water is measured in the external colorimeter
 ab platinum ke taron a tathaa a dwaara lohe ke ek maheen taar t main vidyut pravaahit karte hai
 The wire becomes red by heating the current and the substance placed in the cup starts to oxidize
 lohe ke taar ke jalane main tathaa oxikaran kii is kriya main ushma kshepit hoti he, jisaki maatra bahya calorimapak main upasthit jal ke taap main vruddhi se gyaat kar lee jaati he
 The amount of heat absorbed by combustion of a substance can be found by subtracting the heat absorbed by the burning of iron from the amount of heat obtained from this experiment
 spasht he ki is prayog main mandal kaa aaytan sthir rahata he; atev is vidhi se kisi padaarth kii dahan-ushma nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 The amount of heat that is coated when a gram-equivalent amount of alkali is relaxed by a gram-equivalent amount of acid is called senescence-heat
 yadi amla tathaa kshar itane tanu vilyanon main liye jaaen ki ve purnataya yanon main vighatit hon to shithilikaran kii kriya keval hydrogen tathaa hydroxil yanon ke sanyog se avighatit anu banane kii kriya hogi
 Therefore, in dilute solutions, the heat of relaxation of strong bases by all strong acids will be the same
 prayog dwaara is ushma kaa maan 13,700 calories aata he
 Hence, the relaxation of strong alkali by strong acids can be expressed by the following equations: jahaan x koi mulak he or m koi dhaatu he, Ie arthath But if acid or alkali is weak, it will not completely dissolve in the dilute solution
 atev aise amlon yaa kshaaron kii shithilikaran ushma 13,700 calories nahin aegi
 For example, ionization-heat of ammonium hydroxide is -1,500 calories, so ammonium hydroxide and the relaxing heat of a strong acid would be 12,200 calories
 prayog dwaara shithilikaran ushma ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye saadhaarant: ek tharmas flask main kshar ke tanu vilyan kii ek nishchit maatra lekar flask ko sthir tapawale jal main dubaakar rakhte hai, jisase vikiran dwaara flask ke bheetar vilyan ke taap main antar na ho
 Now, by taking an equivalent amount of acid in the solution, they stabilize its temperature equal to the temperature of alkali
 amla kaa taap sthir ho jane par use shighrata se kshar main mila dete hai
 The highest temperature of the solution is measured by running a solution of a boiler
 ab yadi mishra vilyan kii maatra, uski vishisht-ushma, taap, prayukt flask kii ushmadharita gyaat ho, to shithilikaran kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra sugamawa se gyaat kii ja sakati he
 By the same method, the salts-heat of salts can also be removed easily
 ushma-rasayan kaa sabase pramukh niyam swiss vaigyanik jarmen henry hes ne san 1840 main pratipaadit kiya tha
 According to this rule, hes kaa niyam ushma-rasayan main bahut upyogi siddh hua he
 With this help, heat-changes in non-direct reactions can also be removed indirectly
 udhaaharan ke liye; saadhaarant: carbonic yogicon kii utpaadan-ushma pratyaksh kriya dwaara nahin nikaali ja sakati, parantu carbonic yogic tathaa iske avyav tatwon kii dahan-ushma ko nirdhaarit karke yogic kii utpaadan-ushma hes ke niyam se nikaal sakate hai
 Energy derived from chemical activities has been the means of running our industries
 aaj kritrim upgrah ke yug main jab maanav chandramaa tathaa anya grahon kii yatra main prayatnsheel he to aise idhano kii khoj aavashyak ho gai he jinaki sookshm se sookshm maatra adhik tam urja de sake
 Boron compounds are proving very useful in this direction, because they have higher combustion heat than the same amount of carbon compounds and they are able to give us more energy
 ushmarsayan ke anya upyog bahut kaal se hote aae hai
 For example, the first table shows the highest production-heat of aluminum oxide
 isi gun kaa upyog golddeshmit kii ushman vidhi main kiya gaya he
 Reaction due to the high heat-production of aluminum oxide, main itani adhik ushma kshepit hoti he ki mandal kaa taap lagbhag 3,000 centegrade tak pahunch jaataa he or loha tak pigal jaataa he
 Thus the broken rail tracks can also be joined by melting the broken parts of heavy machines with the help of the above mentioned action

 This scale is used in thermometers used to measure traditional fever
 yadi kisi vyakti ke sharir kaa taapmaana 98 degree fahrenheit se zyada ho jaataa he to vah fever peedit hota he
 Written by Jyotish Singh, Dravaguna is the basic subject of Ayurveda
 iske antargat aushadhiy padpon - unki pahchaan, gun tathaa upachaaratmak upyogon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It can be called 'materia medica' of Ayurveda
 is vigyaan main bheshajagun vigyaan, bheshaj-abhigyaan tathaa padpon ke chikitsiya upyog shaamil he
 It has eight branches
 'dravyagun' do shabdon se milakar bana he - 'dravya' tathaa 'gun' 
 Both living and non-living things come under matter
 charak kaa kahana he ki kuch bhi aisa nahin he jo 'aushadhi' na ho
 Ayurveda is of the opinion that the effect of a medicine is often different from the effect of a single ingredient alone
 ayurveda main vanaspatiyon ke gunagunon ko paanch bhaagon main bhanta gaya he- ras, gun, veery, vipaak or shakti 
 To know the function and effect of medicines, knowledge of their juice, properties, semen, vipaka, and potency is very important
 ye bhi kaha gaya he ki- More than 600 medicinal plants are used as medicine in Ayurveda
 inhen akele yaa dusron saath milakar rogon se mukti paaya jaataa he
 Medicinal plants originate in different types of agro-climatic zones
 vartmaan samay main aushadhiy padpon ko 'prakritik aushadh' ke rup main prayog karne kaa chalan badha he
 Due to this the importance of this subject has increased even more
