 Psychiatry or psychiatry is a specialization in the medical field that studies psychiatrists
 manovikar vigyaan aadhunik yug kaa ek naveen vigyaan he
 In the 20th century itself, discoveries of importance have been made in various parts of this science
 19veen shatabdi tak vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar aise rog maane jate the jinka saadhaaran chikitsak se koi sambandh nahin tha
 In the state of complex psychosis, the patient was kept in mental hospitals, so that he could not do any harm to other people of the society
 in chikitsaalayon main bhi uskaa koi vishesh upachaar nahin hota tha
 The doctors did not really have clear knowledge about his treatment and how to do the medicine
 ab paristhiti badal gai he
 Psychology is not considered a blind cell, which deals with a small number of demented people, but this science is considered to be a matter of such importance that a proper knowledge of it is not only for skilled physical therapists, but also every servant and worker of society, It is also necessary to be a teacher, social reformer and political leader
 itnaa hi nahin, iske gyaan kii aavashyaktaa prayek sushikshit naagarik ko bhi he
 If a strong psychologist comes to mind and we do not know it, then we will not be able to seek the help of any expert to get rid of it
 koi bhi vyakti, jo purna swasth he or jisaki buddhi kii sabhi log prashansa karte hai, apane man kaa santulan kisi samay khokar veikshipt ho saktaa he
 Then it becomes useless for the society
 manushya ko chahie ki vah aisi paristhitiyon kaa gyaan kar le jisase vah kisi prakaar kii asaadhaaran maansik avasthaa main na aa jaay, arthath maansik rog se peedit na ho jaay
 Then it is necessary to have reverence in psychiatry even for getting mental medicine
 maanav kii vishesh aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye manovikar vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 This is the result of a special gift of the 20th century
 is shatee main manushya kii kaaryakshmata or uski sukhsamagriyon main kalpanaateet abhivruddhi hui he
 His logical power and scientific miracles have increased immensely
 iske saath saath uski maansik kriyaayein bhi pehle se kai guni bad gai he
 It is not Corey that talent and madness complement each other
 buddhivikas ke saath saath veikshiptata kaa bhi vikaas hota he
 Science increases pleasant materials, and also creates sad conditions
 vah bahya paristhitiyon ke suljhaav paidaa karne ke saath saath nai maansik ulajhanein bhi utpann kar detaa he
 On the one hand, science increases the security of human beings, on the other hand it also creates unthinkable concerns
 atev yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki 20veen shatabdi veikshiptata kii shatabdi he
 If it has increased insanity, then it is also the task to find special measures to mitigate it
 jo desh jitna hi sabhyataa main pragatisheel he, usamen veikshiptatanivarak chikitsak or chikitsaalay bhi utane adhik hai
 Therefore, many types of psychological discoveries are being made in various fields of anthropology for the prevention of psychosis
 doctor frid ke purv maansik rogon kii chikitsa ke liye doctor log bhautik oshadhiyon kaa hi upyog praaia: karte the
 Some people used mechanism to calm these diseases
 tantropchaar kaa aadhaar vishwaas or nirdesh rahata he
 Even today this method is mostly used in rural illiterate people
 belgium ke prasiddh monsopchaarak da mesumar ne sammohan or nirdesh kaa vyapak upyog maansik rogon ke upachaar main kiya
 Manojat physical diseases were also prevented by this
 france ke bran hime or sharako naamak vidwaanon ne sanmohan kii upyogita monsopchaar main bataai
 The patient used to relieve the mental feeling suppressed in his condition and in this type of catharsis, he also got rid of the disease
 france ke nenson ke doctor imil kuye ne maansik rogon ke upachaar main nirdesh kaa upyog kiya, parantu in sabhi vidhiyon se manovikar vigyaan kii vishesh unnati nahin hui
 For this, serious experimental study of the mind was necessary
 yah kaam doctor frid ne kiya
 Now it is believed that no person can be freed from his dementia without knowing the variations of the mind and knowing the processes going on in them
 doctor frid ke anusaar man ke teen str hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 The mind also performs three types of tasks: the creation of desires, their control and their satisfaction
 pehla kaam bhogashrith man kaa he, doosraa kaam naitik man kaa he or teesraa kaam ahankaar kaa he
 Desires are often born on a subconscious level, they are controlled on the subconscious and their satisfaction is on the conscious level
 manushya ke bhogecchhuk man or naitik man main praaia: sangharsh chalata rahata he
 When this struggle goes on in the human consciousness, then no matter what the cause is, it does not cause disease, but when a strong desire is suppressed by a strong will, through the moral mind, then the level of the mental consciousness But instead of being in the unconscious mind of man
 is sangharsh kaa hona hi maansik rog he or vyakti ko is sangharsh se mukt karnaa uski maansik chikitsa he, jo manovikar vigyaan kaa dhyey he
 For this, the patient is brought into a state of mental dysfunction and then he is instructed to remember his unpleasant or immoral experiences
 iske liye kuch log ab bhi sanmohan vidhi kaa upyog karte hai, parantu frid rogi kaa manovishleshan karte the
 In this method, by bringing the patient to a calm and relaxed state, all the thoughts and pictures that come to mind are asked to speak
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi rogi bahut puraane apriy anubhavon ko kah daalata he
 When those experiences become fully alive and the patient feels ashamed, guilt, joy and sadness in the same way as he did the first time, then his feelings are cathartic and many symptoms of the disease cease
 rogi kaa laabh kori bauddhik smriti se nahin hota, varan puraane anubhavon kii sajiv smriti, arthath bhavpurn smriti, se hota he
 When a repressed emotion is created, it is first charged to the mental doctor
 bhav ke baahar aane ke liye rogi kaa chikitsak ke prati sneh kaa rukh hona nitant aavashyak he
 Unless there is unity of heart between the patient and the physician, repressed desire does not come to the level of subconsciousness
 phir yah sneh din prati din badhata jaataa he
 As the patient's trust in the doctor increases, his disease decreases
 apane rog se mukt hote samay rogi chikitsak ko bahut pyaar karne lagata he
 The growth of this love and cure are two aspects of the same fact
 ab chikitsak kaa karttavya hota he ki vah rogi ke prem ke aaveg ko uske uchit paatr par mode de, athwa uskaa upyog kisi rachanaatmak kaary main karaae
 The doctor keeps trying to get the patient to get emotional composition
 vah use apane aapkaa gyaan badhaane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 The patient can be considered as disease free only if he has not only been free from all the symptoms of the disease, but has received emotional self-reliance and self-suggestion
 manovikar vigyaan isi manodasha kii prapti kaa saadhan he
 In addition to psychology, new discoveries of mental therapeutics have also taken place in other directions
 inamen se do pradhan hai : Due to the struggle going on in the mind of a mental patient, he becomes a victim of insomnia
 ab yadi aise vyakti ko kisi prakaar neend laai jaay, tab sambhav he ki uskaa rog halakaa ho jaay
 The mental patient always has to fight at two places, one inner and the other outer
 use bahari or bhitari chintaayen sataati rahati hai
 Due to this he experiences an extraordinary interruption
 isse vah apni neend kho detaa he
 Loss of sleep increases his tiredness even more and then he goes into a state of insanity
 yadi use neend aane lage, to uski maansik shakti bahut kuch sanchit ho jaay or vah apni bahari samasyaon ko hal karne main samarth ho jaay
 After this, the fierceness of his internal problems also reduces
 atev jo bhi oshadhi rogi ko neend laa de, vah use laabhprad hoti he
 For this, the Indian Ayurvedic medicine is serpagandha, or the sleeping cup made of allopathic method
 jatil maansik rogon se peedit vyakti ko kabhi kabhi achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 For this, he is given an injection of insulin
 iske dene ke baad rogi idhar udhar chatpataata he or shaareerik anthan vyakt karata he
 On repeated injections, the patient has a tendency to rupture, beat and calm
 uskaa man shithilikaran kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 Then the patient naturally recovers
 isi prakaar kaa upachaar bijli ke jhatkon se bhi hota he
 By this, the patient is brought into a semi-conscious or unconscious state
 uski cheshtaayen pratik rup se damit bhaavon kaa rechan karti hai
 In the treatment of complex patients, often electric shocks are employed
 jab inkaa prayog pehle pahal hua tha, tab is upachaar vidhi se badi aashaa hui thi, par ye sabhi aashaaen puri nahin huin
 Some mental diseases are also treated in a natural way
 rogi apane jatil kaamon ko chhod jab prakruti main bhavalin hone lagata he, tab use maansik samya swat: praapt ho jaataa he
 In our current civilization, opportunities for social tension have increased enormously
 jab manushya apni saadhaaran dincharya ko chhod apane man ko aaraam dene lag jaataa he, tab use swasthyalabh ho jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Yung's disease, the person comes to show the need for rest
 vah use apni ichchhaaon ko vash main laane kaa sabak sikhaata he
 According to Edward Carpenter, our present civilization is mental illness
 yah hamen prakritik jivan se dur hataati he
 It increases our desires so much that we always drown ourselves in fulfillment of them
 jis vidhi se in vyarth kii ichchhaaon main kami ho, vahi maansik swasthya kii sarvottam oshadhi he
 Therefore, natural life is the best way to cure psyche
 manovikar vigyaan main na keval prakritik jivan kaa sthaan he, varan dharm kaa bhi he
 Many mental disorders arise from the increase of craving and the lack of restraint
 dharm trishna kii vruddhi ko roktaa or sanyam ko badhaata he
 Therefore, he does not allow many types of psychosis to arise
 duusare, dharm kaa sambandh sahitya or kala se anivaary rup se rahata he
 Through them, the desires of the lower class of humans continue to become sad
 iske kaaran manushya kii in ichchhaaon or naitik buddhi main sangharsh nahin hota or maansik grathiyon ke banane kaa avasar hi nahin aata
 Psychological science thus shifts our vision to those old ways of life and values prevalent in human society, due to which the human suffering has to suffer many kinds of mental afflictions
 is gyaan ke sahare saamaajik mulyon or samskruti kaa jo nirmaan hoga, vah manushya ke jivan ko sthaayee swasthya pradaan karegaa
 With this hope, this science is expanding not only by mental practitioners, but by all social welfare-thinkers
 bharat main manorog vigyaan abhi tak alp viksit avasthaa main he
 The common man's information about psychiatrists is full of misconceptions
 aaj ke vaigyanik yug main bhi bhoot-pret, upree saaya, devi-devtaa, mausam, nakshatra, bhagya, bure karmon kaa fal aadi ko in rogon kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 Hence, the exorcists, priests, clerics, monks, fake vaidyas, neem-hakims, untrained sex-experts, etc
 are acting as unscientific psychiatrists
 saamaanya chikitsak evam chikitsa-visheshgy manorogon ko sahi samay par pahchaanane tathaa rogiyon ko manorog chikitsak ke paas bhejne main praaia: asamarth hai
 There are several reasons for this; The main ones are: money greed, insufficient information, inadequate training, lack of psychiatrists, poverty, non-acceptance of psychosis by the patient or his relatives, etc
 samachar-patr tathaa anya prachaar-prasar madhyam bhi logon ko manorogon ke bare main sahi jaankaree dene main asafal rahe hai
 As a result, the misconceptions of fear and ignorance about these diseases have not gone away in people
 bharat kii 100 karod se adhik aabaadi par maatr lagbhag 4000 manorog chikitsak hai
 This number is very low
 bharat main 42 manorog ke aspataal hai jinamein lagbhag bees hajaar bistar hai
 Recently, it has been planned to provide psychiatric treatment in all government hospitals so that psychiatrists can be provided medical treatment in general hospitals only

 Ethics gives priority to adopting diplomacy, mentorship and similar non-violent methods

 elizabeth behosh vil ke gale main lataka ek pracheen padak nikaal leti he yah sochakar ki kahin log use luteraa na samaj le
 He is then seen by a robber ship which is actually the Black Pearl
 aanth saal baad royal navy ke captain james naurinton ko padonnati dekar camodor bana diya jaataa he or vah elizabeth ke saamne shaadi kaa prastaav rakhata he
 Before Elizabeth can answer her, she is suffocated in a tightly tied dress and she falls into the bay
 pani main girane par jaise hi uske gale main lataka padak tal ko choota he ek spand kii lahar chhot jaati he
 Marauder Captain Jack Sparrow arrives at Port Royal for the purpose of moving the ship
 vah duubati hui elizabeth ko bachaa letaa he par naurinton jaik kii asaliyat jaan letaa he or use giraftaar kar letaa he
 Jack immediately escapes by taking Elizabeth hostage and hides in the blacksmith shop where he is confronted by Will Turner, who is now a disciple of the chief blacksmith
 donon ke bich talwarbazi chhid jaati he par antat jaik ko behosh kar diya jaataa he or faansee ke liye jail main daal diya jaataa he
 That night, Port Royal arrives and hears a call to the Black Pearl medal
 jang main elizabeth pakadi jaati he par "baatcheet" kaa kanoon pukaar kar batch jaati he
 She makes a deal to spare Port Royal in exchange for a medal and reveals Captain Barbosa her false name to Turner
 barbosa maan jaataa he par saude main khami dhund kar elizabeth ko bandi bana letaa he, yah soch kar ki vah shraap se mukti paane kii chaabi he
 Will, who is in love with Elizabeth, suggests a deal to take Jack Sparrow to the Black Pearl, but Nourinton rejects the suggestion, calling him just a blacksmith
 vil baad main jaik ko elizbeth ko bachaane ke liye manaa letaa he jiske badale vah use azaad karvaa degaa
 Knowing Jack's full name as Turner, he accepts his proposal thinking that he will acquire Pearl through him
 vil or jaik echemes interceptor jahaaz khiskaa lete he or tortuga ja kar jaik ke puraane dost joshaame gibs kii madad se karmidal bhartee kar lete he
 He walks to the island of Isla de Muerta because Jack knows that the robbers will go there to break the curse
 vil ko pataa chalata he ki jaik pehle kabhi blike parl kaa captain tha par azetek ke sone kaa raaj pataa chalane ke baad uske saathi barbosa ne baghawat karke use ek viraan tapu par chhod diya
 According to the robbers' law, he was given a shotgun and a bullet so that he could shoot himself better than starving
 par jaik teen din baad batch niklaa or das saal baad bhi usne vah goli bachaa rakhi he taaki use barbosa ke seene main utaar saken
 The robbers looted Aztec's gold, but later they found out the curse that turned him into male-skeletons at night
 shraap tabhi toda ja saktaa he jab saare sikke ikatthe karke har lutere kaa khun us par chadhaaya jaae
 Butstap Bill, Jack's lone supporter, sent a coin to his son Bill, thinking that Barbossa and his crew deserved the curse
 barbosa ne tab bill ko top se baandhakar samundar main phenk diya par baad main use pataa chalaa ki uskaa khun bhi chahie hoga; or ab use isi kaam ke liy aakhri bache turnar kii talash he
 Barbosa on Isla de Muerta, thinking that Elizabeth Butstap is Bill's daughter, dyes the last coin with his blood and drops it into the chest, but the curse still does not break
 tapu par pahunchakar vil ko lagata he ki jaik use dhokaa degaa or vah jaik ko behosh kar detaa he
 He takes Elizabeth to the interceptor after rescuing him and leaving Jack behind
 jaik barbosa se parl ke badale bill turnar kii aakhri santan bataane kaa sauda karata he
 Hearing this, Barbossa reminds Jack that it was his attitude that caused him to lose his hands to Pearl
 barbosa kaa bida interceptor ko dubaa detaa he or uske karmidal ko bandi bana letaa he
 Will reveals that he is the son of Butstap Bill and demands to release Elizabeth and the crew otherwise he will shoot himself and Barbossa's dream of breaking the curse will never be realized
 barbosa maan jaataa he par saude main punah khami dhund kar elizabeth or jaik ko ek viraan tapu par chhod detaa he jahaan usne jaik ko aakhri baar chhoda tha
 Will is taken to Isla de Muerta where Barbossa intends to kill him and break the curse
 viraan tapu par elizabeth ko pataa chalata he ki jaik vahaan se kaise batch niklaa tha; vah tapu sharaab ke taskaron kaa sharaab chhipaane kaa adda tha or jaik unase sauda karke batch niklaa tha
 Elizabetha burns the accumulated liquor so that the ship of Naurinton can find them after seeing the fire
 vah naurinton ke shaadi ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he is shart par ki vah vil kii jaan bachaa le
 Isla de Muerta arrives and prepares for the Nourinton battle, and Jack convinces Barbossa to settle
 vah use shraap tab tak na todne kii salaah detaa he jab tak va naurinton kaa dontles jahaaz naa hathiyaa len
 Jack's plan fails when Barbossa orders his crew to submerge Dauntless
 elizabeth parl par jaakar jaik ke karmidal ko chudaa liti he is ummid main ki ve sab uski sahaayta karenge par vah parl lekar nikal jate he or elizabeth akele hi vil kii madad karne nikal padati he
 She saves Will and on the other hand Jack is fighting Barbossa
 naurinton apane jahaaz par hamalaa hote dekh apane dal ko waapas lautne kaa hukum detaa he
 On reaching the ship, he has to fight with the cursed robbers
 duusari ore barbosa jaise hi elizabeth ko maarane ke liye aage badhata he jaik use goli maar detaa he
 Barbossa feels that Jack has destroyed the bullet, but only then Will breaks the curse by dropping his blood-stained coin into the chest
 shraap tuutane ke kaaran barbosa maaraa jaataa he or dontles par waapas saamaanya hue lutere aatmasamarpan kar dete he
 Jack is being punished to death at Port Royal, but Will arrives and saves him, and both are soon surrounded
 yah dekhakar naurinton vil ko uski aukaat yaad dilaataa he jiske uttar main vil or elizabeth use bataaten he ki yah uske or jaik ke bich he
 Jack falls backwards into the bay and swims and escapes on the newly repaired Black Pearl
 vil ko maafee mil jaati he or elizabeth se shaadi karne kii ijazat bhi
 Asked about Jack, Nourinton talks about giving him a day's hike so that he can get back to her
 jaik ke jahaaz dene ke vaade ke baavjood anamaria use parl kii kaman saunp detii he
 Jack starts looking at his compass, a Pirates' Life for Me, and the film ends
 ant main sheershakon ke baad barbosa kaa bandar jiskaa naam bhi jaik he, sandook main se ek sikaa nikaal letaa he or kankal ban kar camera par jhapat padataa he

 Under which, the demand for political representation raised by Babasaheb gave the Dalit class the right to two votes
 ek vot se dalit apana pratinidhi chunenge tathaa duusari vot se saamaanya varg kaa pratinidhi chunenge
 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits

 At the same time, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs
 is samjhaute par hastakshar karke babasahab ne gandhi ko jeevandaan diya
 Ambedkar was inattentive to the deal, calling Gandhi's fast as a play played by Gandhi to deprive untouchables of their political rights and pressurize them to withdraw from their demands

 samvidhan ke prarambh main naagarikta se sambandhit praavdhaanon ko bharat ke samvidhan ke bhaag II main anuchhed 5 se 11 main diya gaya he
 The relevant Indian law is the Citizenship Act 1955, as amended by the Citizenship Act 1986, Citizenship Act 1992, Citizenship Act 2003 and Citizenship Ordinance 2005, the Citizenship Act 2003 was approved by the President of India on 7 January 2004 and 3 It came into existence in December 2004

 26 janvari 1950 ke baad parantu 1 july 1947 se pehle bharat main janma koi bhi vyakti janm ke dwaara bharat kaa naagarik he
 Any person born in India on or after 1 July 1947 is a citizen of India if one of his parents at the time of his birth was a citizen of India
 7 janvari 2004 ke baad bharat main paidaa hua vah koi bhi vyakti bharat kaa naagarik mana jaataa he, yadi uske donon abhibhavak bharat ke naagarik hon athwa yadi ek abhibhavak bhartiya ho or doosraa abhibhavak uske janm ke samay par gaiyr kanoonee apravasi na ho, to vah naagarik bhartiya yaa videshi ho saktaa he
 Persons born outside India after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992 are citizens of India by descent if their father was a citizen of India at the time of their birth
 10 disambar 1992 ko yaa iske baad bharat main paidaa hua vyakti bharat kaa naagarik he yadi uske janm ke samay koi ek abhibhavak bharat kaa naagarik tha
 From 3 December 2004 onwards, a person born outside India will not be considered a citizen of India if their birth is not registered with the Indian Consulate within a period of one year after birth
 In certain circumstances, registration can be done after a period of 1 year with the permission of the Central Government
 ek bhartiya vaanijya duutavas main ek avyask bachche ke janm ke panjikaran ke liye aavedan dene ke saath abhibhavakon ko likhit main upkram ko yah bataanaa hota he ki is bachche ke paas kisi or desh kaa passport nahin he
 The Central Government, on application, can register a person as a citizen of India under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 if it falls under one of the following categories: - ek videshi naagarik sameekaran ke dwaara bharat kii naagarikta praapt kar saktaa he jo baarah saal se bharat main rah rahaa ho

 The renunciation of citizenship is covered under section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 yadi ek vayask bhartiya naagarikta ke tyaag kii ghoshnaa karata he, vah bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he
 Also from the date of renunciation, the minor child of such person also loses Indian citizenship
 jab baccha atharah saal kii umr main pahunchataa he, use phir se bhartiya naagarikta praapt karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The declaration of renunciation under the Indian citizenship law requires that the person making the declaration be "full of age and ability"
 naagarikta kii samaapti ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 9 main cover kiya gaya he
 The provisions for termination are different and differentiated from the provision for declaration of renunciation
 adhinium kii dhara 9 ke anusaar bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo panjikaran yaa sameekaran ke dwaara kisi or desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaaegi
 isamen yah bhi praavdhaan he ki bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo swechha se kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaayegi
vishesh rup se, samaapti kaa praavdhaan tyaag ke praavdhaan se alag he, kyonki yah "bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik " par lagu hota he or vayaskon ke liye hi pratibandhit nahin he
 That is why Indian children also automatically lose their Indian citizenship if at any time after their birth they acquire citizenship of another country, for example, by equation or registration - whether any other citizenship is acquired by the child's parents
 Why should there not be a result of action
 naagarikta niyam 1956 ke anusaar kisi or desh kaa passport praapt karnaa bhi us desh kii rashtriyata kaa svaichhik adhigrahan he
 According to Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, "the fact that a citizen of India has on some date obtained a passport from the government of another country will be conclusive proof that he has voluntarily granted the citizenship of that country Is derived from " ek baar phir se, yah niyam lagu hota he yadi bachche ke liye uske abhibhavakon ke dwaara videshi passport praapt kiya gaya he or chaahe is tarah ke passport ko praapt karnaa kisi anya desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar aavashyak ho, jo bachche ko apana ek naagarik maanata he 
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki us vyakti ke paas abhi bhi bhartiya passport he
 a person who acquires another citizenship loses Indian citizenship from the same day he acquired the citizenship or passport of another country
 british rajanyik padon ke liye ek prachlit abhyaas he, udahaaran ke liye, us aavedakon se bhartiya passport ko zabt kar bhartiya praadhikaranon ko lautaa diya jaye, jo british passport ke liye aavedan karte hai, yaa jinhone ise praapt kar liya he
 There are special rules for Indian citizens regarding Goa, Daman and Diu
 naagarikta niyam, 1956 kii anusuchee ke niyam 3A ke anusaar, "ek vyakti jo naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 7 ke tahat jari, daadaraa or nagar haveli aadesh 1962, athwa goa, daman or div aadesh 1962 ke aadhaar par bhartiya naagarik ban gaya he or uske paas kisi anya desh ke dwaara jari kiya yaa passport he, tathy ki usne 19 janvari 1963 se pehle apana passport nahin lautaaya he, yah is baat kaa nirnaayak pramaan hoga ki usne is dinaank se pehle swechha se us desh kii naagarikta ko praapt kar liya he
 On 16 February 1962, the Bench of the Supreme Court of India stated in the case of Izhar Ahmed Khan v
 Union of India that "if it is found that the person has acquired foreign citizenship by equation or registration, there is no doubt that As a result of type equation or registration, he will no longer be a citizen of India
 yah bhartiya rashtriyata kaa ek rup he, jiske dharak ko bharat kaa videshi naagarik kaha jaataa he
 The Indian constitution rejects dual citizenship or dual nationality, exceptions from the point where minor citizenship is obtained spontaneously
 bhartiya praadhikaranon ne is kanoon kii vyakhya kii he ki ek vyakti kisi duusare desh kaa passport nahin rakh saktaa agar uske paas bhartiya passport he- yahaan tak ki ek bachche ke maamle main jise anya desh ke dwaara uskaa naagarik hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he or aisa ho saktaa he ki us desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar us bachche ko videsh yatra karne ke liye us desh ke passport kii aavashyaktaa ho - or bhartiya adaalaton ne is maamle par kaaryakari shakha vistrut vivek diya he
 Therefore, the foreign citizenship of India is not a full citizenship of India and thus it denies dual citizenship or dual nationality
 bharat kii kendriya sarkaar ek vyakti ko aavedan par, bharat ke ek videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut kar sakati he yadi vah vyakti bhartiya mul kaa he or aise desh se he jo kisi ek yaa anya rup main dohari naagarikta kii anumati detaa he
 Broadly speaking, "a person of Indian origin" is a citizen of another country who: dhyaan den ki bhartiya mata pita ke bachche swatah hi in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte or isliye swatah osiai ke paatr nahin hai
 Indian Missions have been authorized to grant foreign citizenship of India within 30 days in cases where no serious crime is involved such as drug trafficking, moral turpitude, terrorist activities or any activities that have caused more than one year There can be jail
 videshi bhartiya naagarikta un logon ko nahin di ja sakati, jinhone videshi rashtriyata ko praapt kiya he, yaa praapt karne kii yojana bana rahen hai, athwa unke paas bhartiya passport bhi he
 This law requires that an Indian national who takes a foreign nationality must immediately return his / her Indian passport
 Those who are eligible for it can apply for registration of foreign Indian citizenship
 bharat ke videshi nagarikon ko bhartiya passport karne kii koi yojana nahin he, haalanki panjikaran kaa praaanpatr passport jaisi pustika main hoga mantriparishad ne bharat ke panjikrut videshi nagarikon ko biometric smart card dene ke prastaav par kaam karne ke liye bhartiya videsh mantralay ko dishanirdesh bhi die hai
 a foreign national of India can enjoy all the rights and privileges available to non-nris on the basis of parity
 isamen krishi evam vriksharopan sampatti main nivesh karne yaa saarvajanik karyaalay rakhane kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 a person is required to keep his existing foreign passport which should include a new visa called a 'U' visa, which is a multi-purpose, multi-entry, visa and lasts a lifetime
 iske saath bharat kaa videshi naagarik kabhi bhi, kisi bhi prayojan ke liye, kitni bhi samay avadhi ke liye desh kaa daura kar saktaa he
 a Vietnamese citizen of India will not be able to enjoy the following rights even while living in India: Right to vote, President's office, Vice President's office, Supreme Court and High Court judges, members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Vidhan Sabha or Legislative Council The right to become, the right to appoint in public services
 Also, foreign nationals of India are not eligible for inner line permit
 If they want to travel to some special places in India, they have to apply for a protected area permit
 ek dilachasp sawaal yah he ki bharat ke videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut ek vyakti bharat main rahete hue apane desh ke rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar kho degaa
1930 ke rashtriyata kanoon ke sangharsh se sambandhit vishesh sawaalon par hegg sammelan kaa anuchhed 4 kahata he ki "ek rajya apane kisi vyakti ko aise rajya ke khilaaf rajanyik sangrakshan pradaan nahin kar saktaa jisaki rashtriyata aise vyaktiyon ke paas bhi ho
 yah maamla do chizon par nirbhar karata he: pehla, kya bharat kii sarkaar bharat ke videshi naagarikta ko sachhee naagarikta maanati he or is aadhaar par duusare desh ke dwaara rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar samaapt ho jaataa he; or doosraa, kya vyakti kaa apana desh ise pahachaanata he or bharat kii asweekruti ko sweekaar karata he
 Both points are questionable
 bharat videshi nagarikon ko ek swatantra yatra dastavej nahin detaa he parantu iske bajaay duusare desh ke passport main ek vija rakh detaa he
 If a person is only eligible to hold a passport from another country but cannot retain any form of Indian travel document, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the person is the only citizen of another country for the purpose of diplomatic protection
 bharat kii videshi naagarikta praapt karne par, british naagarik 1981 ke british rashtriyata adhinium kii dhara 4B ke tahat purna british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran nahin karvaa sakate
 yah unhen ek alag tareeke se purna british naagarikta praapt karne se nahin roak saktaa or yah unki british naagarikta ko radd nahin karata yadi ve dhara 4B ke tahat pehle se panjikrut hai
 The Public Information Bureau of India issued a press release which on 29 June 2005 clarified India's foreign citizenship scheme
 osiai yojana kaa purna vivaran bharat sarkaar ke grih mantralay web pej par uplabdh he
 Many other articles have also been written, including: osiai card bhartiya vija kaa vikalp nahin he or isliye osiai dharakon ko bharat main yatra karte samay vah passport apane paas rakhana chahie jo jivan bhar ke vija ko darshata he
 Although a dual citizenship is not fully developed, an OCI card holder has the privilege that multinational companies currently prefer to hire an OCI card holder for a multi-purpose and multi-entry lifetime tour of India
 Have a visa
 yah card dharak ko ek aaajeevan vija pradaan karata he, iske alaava ve alag se kaam karne kaa permit bhi praapt kar lete hai
 OCI holders are treated like nris in economic, financial and educational matters and do not have only political rights, do not have the right to purchase agricultural and plantation property or hold public office
 They do not even have to undergo registration with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer on arrival in the country and can stay here for as long as they want
 osiai card dharak aaraam se yatra kar sakate heim or bharat main kaam le sakate hai, jabaki anya ko rojgaar vija par beurocratic deree hone par pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Many companies are following an active policy of PIO migration to expand their business

 Any person who currently has a non-indian passport who can authenticate their Indianness up to three generations ago
 yahi niyam ek bhartiya naagarik ke jivan saathi par or bhartiya mul ke vyaktiyon par lagu hota he
 Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries are not eligible to obtain a card of Indian origin as specified by the Central Government
 ek piaio card aam taur par jari hone kii tithi se pandrah varsh kii avadhi tak vaidya hota he
 This gives the holder the following advantages

 zukaam ke kaaran hone vaali khaansee, flu ke kaaran hone vaali khaansee kii tulana main halki hoti he
 Cough and fever in adults further indicate the possibility of flu
 kai aise virus jo saamaanya zukaam kaa kaaran hote hai, koi lakshan pradarshit nahin karte
 The color of mucus coming from the lower airways can range from clear to yellow and green
 balgam kaa rang yah sanket nahin detaa ki sankraman jeevanu dwaara hua he yaa vishaanu dwaara
 Colds usually begin with fatigue, experiencing too much cold, sneezing, and headache
 atirikt lakshan jaise naak se srav or khaansee aadi do dinon ke baad dikhne lagate hai
 All symptoms reach their peak two to three days after the onset of infection
 lagbhag saat se das dinon main lakshan samaapt ho jate hai lekin kabhi-kabhi yah teen saptaah tak bhi rah sakate hai
 Cough persists for more than ten days in 35% to 40% of cases related to children
 bacchon se sambandhit 10% maamalon main yah khaansee 25 se bhi adhik dinon tak bani rahati he
 ] Common cold is an easily spread infection of the upper respiratory tract
 rhinovyrus saamaanya zukaam kaa sabase aam kaaran he
 It accounts for 30% to 80% of all cases
 rhinovyrus ek arene yukt virus hota he jo kii paikornavairide parivaar se hota he
 There are 99 known viruses in this family of viruses
 saamaanya zukaam anya virus ke dwaara bhi ho saktaa he
 Coronavirus is responsible for 10% to 30% of all cases
 sabhi maamalon main se 5% se 15% ke liye flu uttaradaayi hota he
 Other cases may be caused by human parainfluenza virus, human respiratory sinusitis, adenovirus, enterovirus and metanumovirus
 saamanyatya sankraman kii sthiti main ek se adhik virus upasthit hote hai
 In total, more than two hundred types of viruses are thought to be associated with colds
 saamaanya zukaam kaa virus aam taur par ek do mukhya tareekon se failata he
 Inhalation of small droplets containing the virus by inhalation or by mouth or by contact with infected nasal mucus or infected objects
 inamen se koun sa kaaran zukaam ke prasar ke liye uttaradaayi he, iskaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 These viruses can survive in the environment for a long time
 iske baad virus haathon se naak athwa aankhon main prasaarit ho jaataa he, jahaan sankraman ho jaataa he
 People sitting next to each other are at higher risk of becoming infected
 rog pratirohak kshamta kii kami vaale tathaa aksar kharaab saaf-safai vaale bacchon main aapasi nazadiiki ke kaaran dainik dekhbhaal kendron athwa skulon sankraman aam hota he
 Subsequently, the infection passes from children to other family members
 vayuyan main vyavsaayik udaan ke dauraan punahparichaalit vaayu ke prayog se zukaam ke prasar hone kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin he
 The infection is most likely to spread during the first three days of a cold caused by rhinovirus
 iske pashchaat sankraman failane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 The traditional theory is that the cold is caused by living in cold weather for a long time, such as in rainy or winter, and that is why this disease is also given this name
 yah vivadaspad he ki sharir ke shitalan se bhi saamaanya zukaam hone kaa khatra hota he yaa nahin
 Some viruses that cause common cold are seasonal and have a higher frequency during cold or wet weather
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah mukhyatya adhik samay tak ghar ke andar or sankramit vyakti ke nikat rahane se hota he; vishesh rup se ve bachche jo skool waapas lautate hai haalanki, yah shwasan pranali main hone vaale parivartanon se bhi sambandhit ho saktaa he, jinke falswaroop halake-phulke sankraman ho jate hai
 Due to low humidity, it can increase its rate of spread because in dry air, small droplets spread easily and they stay in the air for longer time and go far
 samooh pratiraksha use kehete hai jab koi samooh ek vishesh sankraman ke prati pratirakshit ho jaataa he or aisa purv main zukam ke vishaanuon ke sampark main aa chuke hone ke kaaran hota he
 Thus the rate of respiratory infection is higher in the younger population and lower in the older population
 kamazor pratiraksha pranali bhi is beemaari ke liye ek khatra he
 Lack of sleep and malnutrition are also considered a risk against this infection, which subsequently increases the risk of rhinovirus
 yah mana jaataa he ki aisa pratiraksha pranali par inke prabhaav ke kaaran hota he
 Common cold symptoms are generally considered to be the immune system's response to the virus
 is pratiraksha pratikriya kii prakriya vishaanu vishisht hoti he
 For example, rhinovirus is usually acquired by direct contact
 yah ICAM-1 maanav abhigrahakon se agyaat vidhi se jud jaataa he or uttejk madhyasthon ke srav ko sakriy karata he
 Causing these inflammatory mediators
 aamtaur par yah nasika ke apithalium ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaata he
 In contrast, the respiratory syncytial virus is acquired by both direct contact and airborne droplets
 iske pashchaat nichali shwasananalika main adhik failane se purv yah naak or gale main pratikrutiyaan banaata he
 RSV damages the epithelium
 human parinfluenza virus aamtaur par naak, gale or vayumarg main jalan paidaa karte hai
 In young children, affecting the trachea can also result in a throat disease, which causes dry cough and difficulty in breathing
 aisa bacchon ke vayumarg ke chote aakaar ke kaaran hota he
 The difference between upper respiratory tract infections depends mostly on where the symptoms appear
 saamaanya zukaam mukhya rup se naak, faringitis mukhya rup se gale ko or bronchitis mukhya rup se fefdon ko prabhavit karata he
 Common cold is often defined as a burning sensation in the nose and may also involve throat infections to varying degrees
 isamen swa-nidaan aam he
 Isolation of the virus agent that actually causes it is unusual
 aamtaur par lakshanon ke aadhaar par vishaanu ke prakaar kii pahchaan kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 The only effective way to stop the spread of common cold is to stop the spread of the virus
 isamen mukhyatah haath ko dhonaa or chehre par mask pahananaa shaamil hota he
 Long bees and after-use gloves are also worn in healthcare environments
 sankramit vyaktiyon ko alag rakhana isamen sambhav nahin hota kyonki yah beemaari bahut vyapak he or iske lakshan bahut vishisht nahin hote
 Many viruses can be the cause of this disease and there are very quick changes in them, so vaccination has also proved difficult in this disease
 vyapak str par prabhaavshaalee tike viksit kar paane kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 Regular hand washing can reduce the transmission of cold viruses
 yah bacchon ke bich sabase adhik prabhavi he
 It is not known whether using anti-virus or antibacterial materials during hand washing generally increases the benefits of hand washing or wearing masks while being around infected people
 yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye paryaapt pramaan nahin he ki adhik shaareerik or saamaajik duuri bananaa isamen laabhakaari he yaa nahin
 Zinc supplementation can be effective in reducing the frequency of a person with a cold
 niyamit taur par liya jane vaala vitamin si poorak saamaanya zukaam kii gambhirtha yaa jokhim ko kam nahin karata he
 Vitamin c may reduce the duration of a cold
 abhi tak aisi koi dawa yaa jadi booti aushadhi nahin he jo pramanit taur par saamaanya zukaam kii avadhi ko kam kar sakati ho
 Its treatment includes relieving symptoms
 isamen khub aaraam karnaa, sharir main jalyojan banaae rakhane ke liye drav padaarth lenaa, halake garm-namakeen pani se garaare karnaa aadi shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, most of the benefits from treatment can only be attributed to the placebo effect
 lakshanon ko ghatane main jo ilaaj sahaayta karte hai, ve hai saadhaaran dard nivarak or bukhaar kam karne vaali dawaayein jaise, ybruphen or acitaminophen / paracetamal
 There is no evidence that phlegm medicines are more effective than common pain relieving drugs
 bacchon ke liye khaansee kii dawa dene kii salaah nahin di jaati he kyonki inase hone vaale nuksaan ke jokhim ko dekhte hue is baat ke paryaapt pramaan nahin hai jo yah siddh karen ki ye prabhavakaari hoti hai
 In 2009, Canada banned over-the-counter cough medicines and cold medicines for children over 6 years of age due to risks and unproven benefits
 dextromethorthfan ke durupyog ke chalate kai deshon main is par pratibandh lag gaya he
 Symptoms of nasal discharge in adults can be reduced by first-generation medicines of antihistamines
 haalanki, pehali peedi kii antihistamine ke saath susti jaise kuch dushprabhav jude hote hai
 Other desiccants such as pseudoephedrine are also very effective in adults
 ipratropium jo ki naak main daalaa jane vaala ek spray he, naak se srav ke lakshan ko kam kar saktaa he, lekin srav ke kaaran hone vaali ghutan ko yah bahut prabhavit nahin kar paata he
 Second-generation antihistamines do not appear to be so effective
 adhyayan ke abhaav ke kaaran, yah gyaat nahin he ki adhik maatra main taral lene se lakshanon main sudhaar hota he yaa shwasan rog kii avadhi kam hoti he
 Similarly, there is a lack of data regarding the use of hot moist air
 adhyayan main yah paaya gaya ki chest vaper rab raatri ke samay kuch lakshanatmak aaraam dene main sahaayak hai jaise, khaansee, sankulan or sone main kathinaayee Antibiotics do not have any effect on viral infections, so they also have no effect on common cold
 antibytic dawaaen aam taur par khub likhi jaati hai jabaki in dawaaon ke dushprabhav samagrata main nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 These drugs are also commonly prescribed because people expect the doctor to prescribe them and the doctor also wants to help people
 antibytic dawaaon ke likhe jane kaa ek kaaran yah he ki un sankramanon ke karkon ko alag karnaa mushkil he jo antibytic ke madhyam se thik ho sakate hai
 No effective antiviral drugs are available for the common cold, even though some preliminary research has shown benefit
 haalanki aam zukaam ke liye kai vaikalpik upachaar upyog main laae jate hai, lekin phir bhi adhikansh upachaaron ke samarthan main paryaapt vaigyanik pramaan uplabdh nahin hai
 As of 2010, there was not enough evidence to support or oppose honey or nasal obstruction
 yadi zukaam hone ke 24 ghante ke andar hi zinc kii poorak khuraaq le lee jaae to isse lakshanon kii gambhirtha or unki avadhi donon kam ho sakate hai
 The effect of vitamin c on the common cold is dismal, while extensive research has been done on it
 ekaneshia kii upyogita se sambandhit pramaan asangat hai vibhinn prakaar ke ekaneshia purakon kaa prabhaav bhi bhinn-bhinn ho sakate hai
 Usually the intensity of common cold is not high and it ends on its own with most symptoms improving within a week
 gambhir jatiltaayen, yadi ghatit hoti hai to un logon main hoti hai jo yaa to atyant vruddh hai, behad kam aayu ke hai yaa aise log jinka pratiraksha tantra bahut kamazor hai
 There may be secondary bacterial infections that cause sinusitis, pharyngitis, or ear infections
 aisa aankalan he ki 8% maamalon main sinocitis hota he
 Ear infections occur in 30% of cases
 aam zukaam ek sarvaadhik hone vaali aam maanviya beemaari he or vaishvik str par log isse prabhavit hote hai
 Adults usually have this infection two to five times a year
 bacchon ko ek varsh main chah baar se lekar das baar tak zukaam hota he 
 Older people have higher rates of symptomatic infections because their immune systems are weaker
 haalaanki aam zukaam ke hone ke kaaran kii pahchaan 1950 ke dashak main hui thi, lekin yah beemaari manushyon main bahut pracheen samay se chali aa rahi he
 Its symptoms and treatment are mentioned in Ebers papyrus of Egypt, the oldest available medical material and written in the sixteenth century BCE
 yah naam "aam zukaam" solahavin shatabdi isa purv main prayog main aayaa, jiskaa kaaran iske lakshanon or thandak ke mausam ke kaaran upje lakshanon ke bich kii samanta thi
 In the United Kingdom, The Common Cold Unit was established in 1946 by the Medical Research Council and it was here that the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956
 In the 1970s, the CCU showed that during the incubation period of infection with rhinovirus, interferon Treatment provided some protection against the disease
 koi vyavhaarik upachaar vikasit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 The unit was discontinued in 1989, following the completion of research on the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus-induced cold by zinc gluconate lozenges
 CCU ke itihaas main zinc, ekmaatr safal upachaar tha jise viksit kiya gaya
 The economic impact of common cold is not well understood in most of the world
 sanyukt rajya america main, aam zukaam ke kaaran prativarsh 75 million se 100 million baar chikitsak se paraamarsh lenaa padataa he, isaki kamatar karke aanki gai laagat bhi $7
7 billian prativarsh he
 The American people spend $ 2
9 billion annually on over the counter drugs
 iske atirikt america log lakshanatmak aaraam ke liye likhi gayi dawaaiyon par $400 million kharch karte hai
 More than one-third of those going to the doctor were advised to eat antibiotics
 antibytic dawaaon kaa prayog antibytic pratirodh ko prabhavit karata rahata he
 According to an estimate, there is a loss of 22 million to 189 million school days in schools every year due to cold
 natijatan, mata-pita ko 126 million kaarydiwason par ghar rahakar apane bacchon kii dekhbhaal kerani padi
 When it was linked to 150 million workdays left by employees suffering from a cold, the economic impact of a cold-related loss of work was $ 20 billion per year
 yah sanyukt rajya america ke kaary samay main 40% kii haani ke baraabar he
 Several antiviral drugs have been tested to be effective in common cold
 2009 tak, koi aisi dawa nahin mili thi jo ki prabhavakaari bhi ho or upyog hetu licenseshuda bhi ho
 Several trials of antiviral claim placeonaril are being conducted
 yah pikornavairas ke viruddh prabhavi hone kaa vaada karti dikhti he
 BTA-798 is also undergoing several tests
 plasonaril ke maukhik rup ke saath suraksha mudde jude the tathaa airosol rup par adhyayan jari he
 Researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of wisconsin-madison have mapped the genome of all known virus strains to cause common cold
 bhagashef ek kamendriya he jo striyon tathaa stanadhariyon, shuturmurg evam kuch anya jantuon kii maadaaon main paaya jaataa he
 Vedanta is a branch of Jnana Yoga that motivates a person towards the attainment of knowledge
 iskaa mukhya strot upanishad he jo veda grantho or aranyak granthon kaa saar samajhe jate hai
 The Upanishads are the last part of Vedic literature, hence it is called Vedanta
 karmkand or upasna kaa mukhyat: varnan mantra or brahmanon main he, gyaan kaa vivechan upanishdon main
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 veydant kii teen shakhaayen jo sabase zyada jaani jaati hai ve hai: advait veydant, vishisht advait or dwait
 Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Shri Madhwacharya, who are considered to be the promoters of these three branches respectively, besides these there are other branches of Gyan Yoga
 ye shakhaayen apane pravartakon ke naam se jaani jaati hai jinamein bhaskar, vallabh, chaitanya, nimbarak, vachaspati mishra, sureshwar or vigyaan bhikshu
 Among the major Vedantis that have taken place in modern times, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Arvind Ghosh, Swami Shivananda Raja Rammohan Roy and Raman Maharishi are notable
 ye aadhunik vichaarak advait veydant shakha kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The promoters of other Vedantos have also propagated their ideas well in India but they are little known outside India
 ‘veydant’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘vedon kaa ant’
 Initially, the word 'vedanta' was used for the Upanishads, but later on the principles of the Upanishads formed the basis, the word 'vedanta' started being used for those who developed it
 upanishdon ke liye 'veydant' shabd ke prayog ke praayah teen kaaran diye jate hai :- According to Acharya Udayveer Shastri, the term 'vedanta' refers to- upar kaha ja chukaa he ‘veydant’ shabd multah upanishdon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 We have many Upanishads related to different codes and their branches
 jinamein pramukh tathaa pracheen hai - ish, ken, kath, mundak, mandukya, taittiriya, aitarey, chaandogya tathaa brihadaaranyak
 There is a lot of similarity between the philosophical principles of these Upanishads, but there also seems to be opposition in many places
 kaalaantar main yah aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai ki virdohi prathit hone vaale vichaaron main samanvay sthapit kar sarvasammat upadeshon kaa sankalan kiya jaye
 To fulfill this need, Badarayana Vyasa composed the Brahmasutra which is also known as Vedanta Sutra, Shareerakasutra, Shareerakamimansa or Uttaraimamsa
 isamen upanishdon ke siddhanton ko atyant sankshep main, sutara rup main sankalit kiya gaya he
 Due to being too succinct, there is ambiguity in the formulas themselves and it is not possible to understand them without commentary or commentary
 isiilie anek bhashyakaron ne apane-apane bhashyon dwaara inke abhipraay ko spasht karne kaa praytn kiya kintu is spashtikaran main unka apana-apana drushtikon tha or isiliye unamem paryaapt matbhed he
 Each tried to prove that his commentary clarifies the true meaning of the Brahmasutras
 faltah sabhi bhashyakaar ek-ek veydant sampradaay ke pravartak ban gayi
 Prominent among them are Shankar's monotheism, Ramanuja's specificism, Madhva's dualism, Nimbark's dualism and Vallabh's puritanism
 in bhashyon ke anantar in bhashyon par tikaayen tathaa tikaaon par tikaaon kaa kram chalaa
 Many independent texts were also written to confirm the opinion of their community, due to which the literature of Vedanta became very large
 aitihaasik rup se kisi guru ke liye acharya banane / samajhe jane ke liye veydant kii pustakon par tikaayen yaa bhashya likhane padate hai
 These books include three important books, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gītā and the Brahmasutra, which are called Prasthanatrayi
 tadnusaar aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or madhwacharya teenon ne in teen mahatvapurn pustakon par vishisht rachanaayen di hai
 The ideas revealed in the three texts can be interpreted in many ways
 isi kaaran se brahm, jeev tathaa jagat ke sambandh main anek mat upasthit kiye gaye or is tarah veydant ke anek rupo kaa nirmaan hua tha | Gaudapada and his follower Adi Shankaracharya consider Brahma as the head and consider Jiva and Jagat as integral to him
 unke anusaar tatv ko utpatti or vinaash se rahit hona chahie
 The perishable world is non-existent, the living being is not the same as it appears
 jaagrath or swapnavasthaon main jeev jagat main rahata he parantu sushupti main jeev prapanch gyanshunya chetnavastha main rahata he
 This proves that the pure form of the organism should be like sushumpti
 sushupti avasthaa anitya he at: isse pare turiyavastha ko jeev kaa shuddh rup mana jaataa he
 In this state there is no relation with the mortal world and the organism does not have to enter the mortal world again
 yah turiyavastha abhyaas se praapt hoti he
 When the knowledge of impenetration arises in Brahma-jiva-jagat, the world becomes absorbed in Jiva and Jiva
 teenon main vaastavik abhed hone par bhi agyaan ke kaaran jeev jagat ko apane se pruthak samajhataa he
 But like the dream world, the awakened world is also a fantasy of an organism
 bhed itnaa hi he ki swapn vyaktigat kalpana kaa parinaam he jabaki jaagrath anubhav-samshti-gat mahakalpana kaa
 Falsehood is proved in both of them when they know the dream
 parantu baudhon kii tarah veydant main jeev ko jagat kaa ang hone ke kaaran mithyaa nahin mana jaataa
 a creature experiencing falsehood is the ultimate truth, if he believes it to be false, all knowledge has to be considered false
 parantu jis rup main jeev sansar main vyavhaar karata he uskaa vah rup avashya mithyaa he
 Zoroastrian state of consciousness is zero pure state
 gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa sambandh mithyaa sambandh he
 Beyond this, the organism attains its pure state of consciousness
 is avasthaa main bhed kaa lesh bhi nahin he kyonki bhed dwait main hota he
 This Advaita state is called Brahm
 tatv aseem hota he, yadi doosraa tatv bhi ho to pehle tatv kii seemaa ho jaaegi or simit ho jane se vah tatv buddhigamya hoga jisamen gyaata-gyey-gyaan kaa bhed pratibhasith hone lagegaa
 Experience testifies that all known objects are mortal
 at: yadi ham tatv ko anshwar maanate hai to hamen use advay, agyeya, shuddh chaitanya maananaa hi hoga
 By assuming such an element, we have to explain the resplendent state of the world with the help of discourse
 rassi main pratibhasith honevaale sarp kii tarah yah jagat na to sat he, na asat he
 Had it been true, it would never have been destroyed, if it had been immaterial, there would have been no experience of happiness or sorrow
 at: sat asat se vilakshan anivarchaneey avasthaa hi vaastavik avasthaa ho sakati he
 This ignorance has been rendered by the Upanishads as Neti
 agyaan bhav rup he kyonki isse vastu ke astitv kii uplabdhi hoti he, yah abhaav rup he, kyonki iskaa vaastavik rup kuch bhi nahin he
 This ignorance is considered the cause of the world
 agyaan kaa brahm ke saath kya sambandh he, iskaa sahi uttar kathin he parantu brahm apane shuddh nirgun rup main agyaan virahit he, kisi tarah vah bhavabhaav vilakshan agyaan se aavrutt hokar sagun ishwar kahalaane lagata he or is tarah sristikram chaalu ho jaataa he
 God has knowledge of his pure form, but an organism has to be enlightened through cultivation to gain knowledge of his Brahman form
 guru ke mukh se 'tatvamasi' kaa upadesh sunakar jeev 'ahan brahmasmi' kaa anubhav karata he
 At that stage, one sees the whole world as soulful and the whole world in itself because at that time there is no element apart from it
 isi avasthaa ko turiyavastha yaa moksh kehete hai
 Ramanujacharya said contrary to Shankar's view that God is an independent element, but the living is also true, not false
 ye jeev ishwar ke saath sambhddha hai
 Their relation is also not due to ignorance, it is real
 moksh hone par bhi jeev kii swatantra satta rahati he
 The physical world and creatures are different in truth, but the truth of God is unique from their truth
 brahm purna he, jagat jad he, jeev agyaan or du:kha se ghira he
 These three together merge because the universe and the living entity are the bodies of Brahm and Brahma is their soul and destiny
 brahm se pruthak inkaa astitv nahin he, ye brahm kii seva karne ke liye hi hai
 In this philosophy, instead of advaita, the idea of plurality is there, but Brahma is an element that establishes unity among many
 bahutv se vishisht advay brahm kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran ise vishishtadvait kaha jaataa he
 Distinguished knowledge is considered impossible in the Vichitadvaita doctrine
 isiilie shankar kaa shuddh advay brahm is mat main grahya nahin he
 Brahma is special and its specialty is that all the sattva qualities are in it
 at: brahm vastav main shariri ishwar he
 All individual souls are true and it is from this that the body of Brahma is created
 ye brahm main, moksh hane par, leen nahin hotin; inkaa astitv akshunn bana rahata he
 In this way, Brahma is a formula for unity in diversity
 yahi brahm pralay kaal main sookshmbhoot or atmaaon ke saath kaaran rup main sthit rahata he parantu sristikaal main sookshm sthool rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 This work is called Brahm
 anant gyaan or anand se yukt brahm ko narayan kehete hai jo lakshmi ke saath baikunth main nivas karte hai
 One can reach near this Narayana by devotion
 sarvottam bhakthi narayan ke prasad se praapt hoti he or yah bhagavadgyanamay he
 There is no place of caste-varna distinction in the path of devotion
 sabake liye bhagwatprapti kaa yah rajmarg he
 Madhva propagated the dvaita Vedanta in which the five distinctions are considered to be the basis - Jiva God, Jiva Jiva, Jiva Jagatta, God Jagatta, Jagatta Jagatta
 inamen bhed swat: siddh he
 Without distinction the position of the object is impossible
 jagat or jeev ishwar se pruthak hai kintu ishwar dwaara niyantrit hai
 Saguna is the creator, guardian and destroyer of the world
 bhakthi se prasann honevaale ishwar ke ishaare par hi sristi kaa khel chalata he
 Although the creature is naturally enlightened and blissful, it has to suffer with the connection of body, mind, etc
 yah sansarg karmon ke parinamswaroop hota he
 The creature is a doer and a fruiter even if he is God-controlled
 ishwar main nity prem hi bhakthi he jisase jeev mukt hokar, ishwar ke sameep sthit hokar, anandbhog karata he
 The physical world is subordinate to God and by the will of God, it is situated in the gross and subtle state respectively in creation and holocaust
 ramanuj kii tarah madhv jeev or jagat ko brahm kaa sharir nahin maanate
 These are auto-located elements
 unamem paraspar bhed vaastavik he
 God only controls them
 is darshan main brahm jagat kaa nimitt kaaran he, prakruti upadan kaaran he
 The philosophy of Nimbark is highly influenced by Ramanuja
 jeev gyaan swaroop tathaa gyaan kaa aadhaar he
 Righteous-religion-sentiment or impersonal relationship is considered in life and knowledge
 yahi gyaata, karta or bhokta he
