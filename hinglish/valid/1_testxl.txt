 Will be guilty simultaneously; Even if Swami had not been informed of the work of the servant or the error in the prescribed work, or why the servant had not done the work against the command of the Swami or had been disappointed in doing the prescribed work

 achal sampatti ke lenden main, ek varantee vilekh yah vaada he ki ek bhoomi ke kharidaar ke swaamitv kaa bachaav kiya jayega
 a warranty may be expressed or implied
 utpaada ke vikreta kii taraf se ek guarantee he jo us seemaa ko nirdisht karti he jabatak us utpaada kii gunvattta yaa pradarshan kaa aashwaasan kaa bharosa diya jaataa he or un sthityon kaa spashtikaran hota he jinke antargat us utpaada ko waapas kiya ja saktaa he, badla ja saktaa he, yaa marammat kii ja sakati he
 It is often given as a specific, written "warranty" document
 haalanki, vikreta dwaara maal ke vivaran or shaayad unke strot or gunvattta ke aadhaar par kanoonee niyamon se bhi ek varantee utpann ho sakati he or us vinirdesh se kisi bhi prakaar kii saamagree bhinnata guarantee kaa ulanghan hogi
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi utpaada kaa varnan karne vaala vigyaapan aksar express varantee se bharaa hota he; us utpaada ko vigyaapit vivaran ke anukool hona chahie
 kai vigyapandaata is uddeshy ke liye asveekaran shaamil karte hai 
 saamanytah, ek likhit varantee kharidaar ko vishwaas dilaati he ki us vastu kii gunvattta acchhee he or vah "saamagree or banaavat" main dosha rahit he
 An express warranty can be made verbally, in writing and without any intention by the seller to actually make the warranty
 sanyukt rajya america main, ek vikreta ko mulya ke liye apni raay banane kii anumati hoti he jise pafari ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jis par ek kharidaar saude ke aadhaar ke rup main bharosa nahin kar saktaa
 udhaaharan ke liye, "yah shikari chaaku duniya main sabase behtareen chaaku he" maatr ati prashansa he, jabaki ek bayaan jaise ki "is shikari chaaku ko dhar karne kii kabhi aavashyaktaa nahin he" ko ek express varantee ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he jab tak ki us chaaku ko uske icchit prayojan ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some other countries, consumer protection laws exist that prohibit advertisers from making untrue or inaccurate statements
 kisi prasiddh trademark kaa durupyog bhi ek express varantee ko vyakt kar saktaa he, jiskaa ulanghan "passing of" kehalaata he; maal ke strot or gunvattta ko galat prastut kiya gaya
 Some products have warranties under which a repair is promised for a month, year or lifetime
 siddhant rup main, ek vyakti marammat ke liye kisi utpaada ko "dealer" ko waapas kar saktaa he, lekin adhikansh dukaane -or nirmaataa bhi- jo is tarah ke utpaadon ko bechate hai unke paas marammat suvidhaon kaa abhaav hota he
 Car dealers have repair shops that cause many people to buy new cars; Computer dealers and consumer electronics dealers used to have such shops in the 1990s, but most of them are now extinct
 abhyaas main, ek utpaada jo ek maheene ke bheetar vifal ho jaataa he use dukaan kii guarantee ke tahat nae dwaara pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he; yaa ek utpaada jo dukaan kii guarantee ke samaapt hone ke baad vifal hota he lekin jisaki nirmaataa kii guarantee baaki he use nirmaataa dwaara badla ja saktaa he - store guarantee or nirmaataa kii varantee paraspar anany hai
 There were once repair shops that provided warranty service for small electrical appliances, such as electric razors or lamps and toasters; But in the 1980s, most of those letters turned to forwarding service that sent warranty products to manufacturers to replace them, and most of them disappeared in the 1990s
 kuch apwaad bhi hai: kuch companiyaan - visheshkar toshiba - vastav main varantee ke antargat utpaadon kii marammat karti he
 Thomas Freedman explains how Toshiba built an arrangement to handle warranty operations in the case of UPS: a customer, who ordered a computer directly from Toshiba's website, sent the malfunctioning computer via UPS to Toshiba Can
 vastav main, vah kabhi toshiba tak nahin pahunchataa he
 Rather, UPS maintains its own Toshiba-computer repair shops
 jab upies, upyogkarta ke computer ko uthaata he, vah use upies kii dukaan par bhej detaa he, jahaan use thik kiya jaataa he, pareekshan kiya jaataa he or ek nirdisht samay seemaa ke bheetar upyogkarta ke paas lautaa diya jaataa he
 In general, the user's software and data are preserved
 ek nihit varantee vah hoti he jo vikreta ke vyakt abhyavedan kii bajaay saude kii prakruti or kharidaar dwaara nihit samaj se utpann hoti he
 The warranty of commercial use is implied, unless expressly denied by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase "as-is" or "with all defects
" To be "marketable", the goods must suit the expectations of an ordinary buyer, meaning they are what they say
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek fal jiskaa swaroop or khushboo acchhee he lekin jisamen chupe hue dosha hai, vah vanijopayogita kii varantee kaa ulanghan karegaa agar uski gunvattta aise fal ke maanakon ko puraa nahin karti jo "vyapaar main aamtaur par sthapit he"
 masachusets ke upabhokta sangrakshan kanoon main, gharelu upabhokta vastuon par is varantee ko asweekaar karnaa gaiyrkanoonee he aadi
 a fitness warranty for a specific purpose is implied when a buyer relies on the seller to select goods to suit a specific request
 udhaaharan ke liye, is varantee kaa tab ulanghan hota he, jab ek kharidaar ek maikenic se snow tair kii maang karata he or badale main aise tair praapt karata he jo barf main prayog ke liye asurakshit hai
 This implied warranty can be expressly denied by name, putting the risk of malfunction back on the buyer
 ek aaajeevan varantee, aamtaur par bazaar main ek utpaada ke jivan par hoti he na ki upabhokta ke jeevankaal par, 
 yadi ek utpaada ko band kar diya gaya he or ab uplabdh nahin he, to varantee ek simit avadhi tak lambi chal sakati he
 For example, the Cisco limited lifetime warranty currently lasts five years after the product is discontinued
 kul bazaar ke hisse ke rup main prayukt / second-hand utpaada bazaar kaa mahatv ikkisvin sadi kii shuruyaat ke baad se kaaphi bad rahaa he
 Second-hand products include products that have previously been used by a consumer / user
 upyogkarta apane utpaadon ko tab bhi badal dete hai jab vah acchhee haalat main hai
 Some products, such as computers and mobile phones, have a short lifespan and the technologies of these products continue to be marketed
 natijatan, nae utpaadon kii bikri aksar, badale jane kii vyavastha se judy hoti he, jisase second-hand utpaadon ke liye ek bazaar falit hota he
 For example, unit sales of used cars in France increased from 4
7 million to 5
4 million between 1990 and 2005, with new car sales falling from 2
3 million to 2
07 million units in the same period
 ek varantee kaa ulanghan tab hota he jab vaade ko todaa jaataa he; bikri ke samay jab maal vaisaa nahin hota jaisi usase ummid hoti he, chaahe vah dosha spasht ho yaa nahin
 vikreta ko us varantee kaa sammaan karte hue samay se paise waapas yaa vaastu kaa pratisthaapan karnaa chahie
 agar vikreta varantee kaa sammaan karne se inkaar kar detaa he to varantee ke ulanghan kii adalati shikaayat ke liye vah bikri avadhi sambandhi kaanoon ke tahat samay ko shuru kar detii he
 This period is often overlooked where there is an "extended warranty", in which a seller or manufacturer contracts to provide additional service to repair or replace goods that fail within that extended period
 haalanki, agar maal bikri ke samay hi kharaab the or sambandhit avadhi sambandhi kaanoon samaapt nahin hua he, to kisi bhi "vistaarit varantee" kaa astitv yaa avadhi dwitiyak hoti he: vahaan ek praathmik varantee kaa ulanghan hota he jiske liye vikreta uttaradaayi ho saktaa tha
 Attempting to avoid liability for breach of the primary warranty while claiming the termination of the irrelevant extended warranty can be an unfair and misleading business practice
 ek anubandh main avadhi sambandhi kaanoon kaa daawa ek apkrutya daawey kii tulana main chota ho saktaa he or varantee ulanghan ke kuch maamle der se daayar kiye jate hai or unhen ek dhokhadhadi yaa anya sambandhit apkrutya ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa he
 For example, a consumer buys an item that is broken or missing parts before it is removed from the package
 yah ek doshapurn utpaada he or use vikreta ko lautaaya ja saktaa he yaa badla ja saktaa he, bina isaki parvaah kiye ki vikreta kii "vaapasi niti" kya he, tab bhi jab is samasya kaa uddhatan "vistaarit varantee" ke samaapt ho jane ke baad hua ho
 isi tarah, agar utpaada samay se pehle hi kharaab ho jaataa he, to ho saktaa he ki vah usee samay kharaab tha jab use bechaa gaya tha or tab use lautaaya yaa badla ja saktaa tha
 If the seller insults the warranty, a contract claim can be initiated in court
 khudara vyapaar main, ek varantee, saamanytah saadhaaran prayog kii sharton ke tahat ek utpaada kii vishwasaneeyata kii guarantee ko sanderbhit karti he
 This is called an "extended" warranty because it covers defects that may arise after the date of sale
 agar ek utpaada kharidne ke baad, samay kii nirdhaarit avadhi ke bheetar kharaab hota he to to nirmaataa yaa vitarak ke liye yah aam taur par aavashyak hota he ki vah graahak ke liye us vastu ko badal de, yaa marammat kare, yaa paise waapas kare
 aisi varantee main aamtaur par, "prakritik aapadaa", maalik dwaara durupyog, durbhaavnapurna vinaash, vanijyik upyog, yaa waisi hi kuch baat jo saamaanya nijee upyog main hui yantric kharabi ke baahar hui ho
 adhikansh varantee ke antargat ve hisse shaamil nahin kiye jate jo saamaanya rup se kharaab hone vaale hote hai or ve aapurtiyon jinhen nishchit samyavadhi ke baad pratisthapit kiya janaa chahie kyonki saamaanya rup se unka upyog kiya ja chukaa hota he 
 ek vistaarit varantee ko kharid mulya main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, yaa vaikalpik rup se ek atirikt shulk ke saath vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he or unka vaarshik vistaar ho saktaa he or saath hi saath us utpaada main "aaajeevan" jaise aspasht shabd ho sakate hai
 Third-party warranty providers offer an optional "extended warranty" agreement for multiple products, which is considered a contract of insurance for that product
 tritiy-paksh ko vibhinn choti, swa-bimit companiyon ke madhyam se bechaa jaataa he or saath hi saath vishaal, prasiddh store shrinkhalaa dwaara bhi jaise ki best bai or circuit city
 jaisaa ki beemaa ke anya prakaar ke maamle main hota he, companiyaan jua khelti hai ki utpaada vishwasaneey honge or varantee ko bhul jaaya jayega, yaa kisi bhi tarah ke daawey ko saste main nipta diya jaayegaa
 kuch tritiy paksh kii companiyaan khud kii sahaayta pradaan karti hai jaise ki jettief bijness system; ye companiyaan kharaab hisson ko nikaal detii hai or pratisthaapan ke liye nirmaataa ke paas waapas bhej detii hai
 Extended warranties are not usually provided through the manufacturer, but are extended through independent administrators
 kuch paristhitiyon main yah upabhokta ke hit main kaam kar saktaa he ki utpaada kaa beemaa ek aisi company se kiya gaya he jo kharid ke sthaan or / yaa seva ke sthaan se baahar kii he
 For example, when an auto warranty is provided through a car dealership, it is usually a subcontracted warranty, where the vehicle repair deal is settled at a lower rate, often including service, The following standard is negotiated with Labor and Part
 kai baar is prakaar kii varantee ke liye marammat ke samay ek apratyaashit kharch kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaise ki:-varantee sharton ke baahar pradaan kii gai apratyaashit sevaayen-gaiyr-varantee hisse or shram dar-purna shesh raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa jabaki ek pratipurti kii vyavastha dilarship / varantee daawa karyaalayon ke madhyam se kii gai ho
kuch yantriki or vyapaaree seva kendra aavashyak marammat ko taal sakate hai yaa badal sakate hai jab tak ki dilarship varantee samaapt na ho gai ho taaki marammat kii laagat unki varantee ke antargat naa aae, yaa saadhaaran dukaan dar lagu ho
 The * true literature of an insurance service agreement is the most important aspect of determining the quality of your extended auto warranty
 ek puri tarah se bimit auto varantee, jo kabhi-kabhi thok daron yaa isi tarah par mil jaati he, vah mulya antar ke laayak ho sakati he, yadi koi he to
 sachcha sahitya ek anubandh he jo aapaki ore se likhaa gaya ho jisamen aapkaa naam zarur hona chahie or aapaki utpaada idi sankhya yaa vaahan idi sankhya kaagaj par zarur likhi honi chahie
 yah aapkaa sachcha sahitya he or jab bhi kisi anubandh ke saath kaary karte hai to vahaan hameshaa bhinn "niyam evam sharten," hoti hai, to sunishchit karen ki aap sirf unhi companiyon ke saath sauda karen jo aisa seva anubandh pradaan karte hai 
 is prakaar kii varantee company, up-anubandhit, aatanrik, khudara or third-party varantee companiyon kii tulana main ullekhneey rup se kaafii alag hoti he, sirf isliye kyonki vah ucch dukaan dar ko aavruth karegi or graahak ko dilarship ke baahar or saath hi saath desh bhar main ek alag maikenic kaa chayan karne kii anumati degi
 bimit varantee aksar vaahan kii sarvice hone se pehle hi marammat, shram dar or prayukt parts kii laagat ke liye bhugtan kar detii hai, jisase maalik ko marammat kiye gaye vaahan yaa utpaada ko praapt karte samay sirf nune sah-bhugtan / katautee dena hota he
 The rights and treatment of buyers and sellers in the United States is governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code because it differs from state to state in its form
 UCC, express varantee or nihit varantee, donon ko niyantrit karata he
 It also includes limitations under which sellers may reject certain types of warranties (eg, commercial warranties or qualifications for a specific purpose or in the case of merchandise sold "as-is")
 is
 jabaki america main, varantee ko aam taur par likhit rup main diya jaataa he jo kanoon ke niyantran ke adheen he, anya deshon main varantee vishisht vidhiyon se niyantrit ho sakati hai
 For example, a country's law may provide that goods must be insured for a period of 12 months by the seller and may provide other special rights and remedies in the event of a product failure
 haalanki, america main bhi aise vishisht kanoon he jo khariddaaron ko varantee yaa varantee kii tarah aashwaasan uplabdh kara saktaa he
 For example, many states have statutory warranties on new housing construction and many have so-called "lemon Laws" that govern motor vehicles that deteriorate repeatedly
 jatil vyavsaayik lenden main, kharidaar or vikreta aapas main ek vishisht abhyavedan or varantee pradaan kar sakate hai
 In common parlance, these are known as "representations and warranties"
 ye bayaan he jiske dwaara ek paksh duusare paksh ko kuch nishchit aashwaasan detaa he or jis par doosraa paksh bharosa kar saktaa he
 In this context, a representation is usually a specific fact that can be verified as being true or false, "the seller represents that it is a duly held corporation and exists lawfully under the laws of the State of Delaware
" " yahaan, ek varantee, aashwaasan ke rup main adhik he, jaise "aapurtikarta varantee detaa he ki is pariyojna par kaam kar rahe uske sabhi karmchaaree gopneeyata samjhauton ke adheen honge jisamen ulanghan ke liye nishedhagna raahat paane kii aapurtikarta kii kshamta shaamil he
 "if the representations and warranties are not true or not fulfilled then often specific treatment or consequences for such a condition are specified
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vikreta yah abhyavedan or varantee de saktaa he ki bike hue saamaan main uskaa purna swaamitv adhikaar he or us lenden ko lekar vikreta ke liye koi kanoonee baadha nahin he
 If it is discovered that the seller does not have full rights or is subject to any other consent that prohibited the sale and if it affects the ownership of the buyer or he has to spend for it, the buyer has The seller has the right to seek relief under the agreement
 in lendenon main partiyaan aamtaur par un muddon ko lekar abhyavedan or varantee kii maang karti hai jinako lekar ve chintit hai
 Because of the consequences of making representations and warranties, parties usually try to restrict their limits
 in do binduon ke bich tanaav, partiyon ke bich niyam or samjhaute kii sharton ko lekar hone vaali baatcheet ko aakaar dene main madad karata he
 a car warranty extends for a minimum of 1 year, usually 3 years and 5 years
