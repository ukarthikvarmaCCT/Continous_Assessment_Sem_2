Do you get respect only by the strength of caste and gotra? 'nahin poochta he koi tum vrati, vir yaa dani ho? Everyone asks just this, which family are you proud of? magar, manuj kya kare? janm lenaa to uske haath nahin, Choosing caste and clan is a matter of our own

 ' Karna was in contemplation for the Guru when he was engrossed, immovable, tabhi ek vishkit kahin se asana ke neeche paitha

 But, the hot torrent of blood that suddenly came in the body, parashuram jag pade, rakt ko dekh hue vismit man main

 'nishchal baitha rahaa, soch, yah keet swayan ud jaayegaa, How much will this little creature hurt me? par, yah to bheetar dhansata hi gaya, mujhe hairaan kiya, i am ashamed that you have seen everything yourself

 Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic arithmetic in which the count starts at 1 after reaching an integer
 ise kabhi-kabhi ghadi kaa ganit bhi kehete hai
 In this field, the Swiss mathematician Eiler did a remarkable job
 iske baad karl fredrick gouse ne isko or aage badhaayaa
 One small use of modulo mathematics is during clock time
 abhi subah ke 8 baje hai ; ab se 7 ghante baad 8 + 7 = 15 bajnaa chahie jise ham 3 bajnaa kehete hai
 
 arthath modulo 12 ke liye 15 or 3 dono samaan hai
 Two whole numbers a and b are said to be the remainder of the modulus n, when a - b is divisible by n
 isko nimnlikhit prakaar se likhte hai : n is called modulus of equilibrium
 udhaaharan ke liye Because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12
 rinatmak purnankon ke liye bhi yahi niyam he- The properties of equilibrium are similar to the properties of equations
 yadi a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b or c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } d, tab a+c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b+d or ac ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } bd 
 If f is a polynomial function of x, where x is a multiple of integers and a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b, then f ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} f, but if ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} ac, then It is not necessary that b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c, eg 1 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 6, but 1 and 3 are not equivalent to
 ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } ac se jo uchit fal nikaala ja saktaa he, vah keval yahi he ki samsheshtha kii is ankan paddati kaa ek bada laabh yah he ki isaki sahaayta se sankhya siddhant ke bahut se falon ko sundar dhang se nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 The aggregate and truncated residuals have a set-equilibrium relationship equivalence relation
 iskaa arth he ki nimnakit sambandh satya he : a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} a; a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b kaa arth b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } a he
 a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b, b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c means a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} c
 isliye samsheshtha sambandh purnaakon ke samucchy ko atulyata ke virgon main is prakaar baantata he ki ek varg ke prayek do purnank maapak m ke prati samshesh hai or bhinn bhinn virgon ke do purnank maapak m ke prati samshesh nahin hai
 If one integer is taken from each of the m squares, then one set of whole residues per modulus m will be obtained
 is prakaar -3, 3, 2, 12, 14, 20, -6 mapank 7 ke prati sampurna avasheshon kaa samucchy he
 The set of simple residuals to modulus m is 0, 1, 2, 3 


 m-1, and the absolute minimum is the following set of absolute residuals: 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 2, xxrep 6 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } / 2, jab m visham he And 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 2, xxrep 4

 da lijend off bhagat sinh hame vistaar main yah bataata he ki kaise bhagat sinh ne brithish raaj ke virudhd or bhartiya swatantrta ke prati kaisaa apn vichaar ruchi ko viksit kiya
 The picture begins with the disposal of the mortal and body of Bhagat Singh and then the memorial of his life
 ek aitihaasik, vishaadh or deshbhakti ki bhaavana aati he
 Born in 1907, Bhagat Singh had been coming to see the atrocities of the British Raj since childhood
 desh ke prati aradhana or kartavyaparayanta ke kaaran unhone apn ghar chhod diya or apane aap ko hindustan republic main shaamil kar diya
 He also participated in many movements
 police ke haat hue lala lajpat rai ke maut k badl lene ke liye, bhagat ne police afasar, jone sounders kii hatya main shaamil tha
 Shivram Rajguru and Sukhdev were also with him to carry out this murder
 unako ek cell main bandh kiy jaataa he or berahami se pit diy jaataa he
 He had to endure a lot of corruption there

 When the British proposed trade disputes and the Public Safety Bill, they planned and executed a bomb blast in Indian Parliament
 khaali bencho par bam phancokar unhone sansad main shaamil logo kii suraksha k khyaal rakh
 He was arrested
 lahore jail main bhi unhone ek aandolan loch kiya
 Bhagat and his comrades started an earthquake strike in the jail to improve the condition of the fighter prisoners

 Bhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1907
 ve bhartiya swatantrata aandolan ke sabase prabhavshali krantikario main se ek mana jaataa he
 He was an Indian Socialist
 unhe akasar 'shahid bhagat sinh' ke naam se jane jate hai
 Born in a Sikh family, Bhagat Singh was already involved in activities against the British Raj
 ek bachche ke rup main bhagat ne british shaskaon dwara apane saathi bharatiyo ke saath kiye jane vaale atyaachaaro ko dekhakar bahut pareshaan hote the
 When Bhagat was a teenager, he respected European revolutionaries movement very much
 isi baat unhe araajaktaavaadi or marxvaadi vichaardhaara kii ore le gayi
 He joined many revolutionary organizations
 unhe mohandas karmmmand gandhi kaam or kriya se bahut prerana mili
 But when Gandhi ended the unbearable movement, Bhagat was very disappointed
 isliye unhone hindustan republic association main shaamil ho gayi
 And very quickly, in 1928, the name of the association was changed to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association and became one of the main leaders of the association

 Bharatendu composed it for the Hindu National Theater of Banaras in a single day
 
 The play is divided into 6 digits
 isamen ank ke bajaay drishy shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 In the first scene, Mahanta appears with his two disciples who send his disciples Govardhan Das and Narayan Das to a nearby town to beg
 ve govardhan das ko lobh ke bure parinaam ke prati sachet karte hai
 The second scene has a view of the city market where everything is being sold in the city
 govardhan das bazaar kii yah kaphaiyat dekhakar anandit hota he or saat paise main dhai ser mithai lekar apane guru ke paas laut jaataa he
 In the third scene, both the disciples return to the Mahant
 narayan das kuch nahin laata he jabaki gobardhan das dhai ser mithai lekar aata he
 The Mahant becomes alert after hearing the news of Guni and Avaguni getting the same sentiment in the city and asks his disciples to leave the city immediately
 ve kehete hai-"set set sab ek se, jahaan kapur kapaas
 In such country Quds, do not live like bass
 
 "narayan Das agrees to them while Govardhan Das decides to stay there in the temptation of cheap tasty food

 On the complaint of drunken King Fariyadi's goat bashing, he starts from Baniya and goes to Kotwal via artisan, lime, Bhisti, butcher and shepherd and is sentenced to death
 paanchaven drishy main mithai khate or prasann hote mote ho gaye govardhan das ko chaar sipaahi pakadakar faansee dene ke liye le jate hai
 They tell him that the goat died so that someone must be hanged for the sake of justice
 jab duble kotwaal ke gale se faansee kaa fandaa bada niklaa to raja ne kisi mote ko phaansi dene kaa hukum de diya
 In the sixth scene, the preparations to hang Govardhan Das in the cremation are complete
 tabhi uske guru mahant ji aakar uske kaan main kuch mantra dete hai
 After this, both the Guru disciples show a rush to hang

 Collector - brahmi lipi evam usase vyutpann adhikansh lipiyon kii varnmaala ke prayek varg ke paanchaven varnon ke samooh ko panchamakshar yaa panchamakshar kehete hai 
 Devanagari has 7, J, N, n and m stamps
 vibhinn bhashaaon main panchamaaksharon kaa prayog hota he
 All languages have their own rules or conventions for using Panchamaksharas
 hindi main takneekee tankan yantron kii samasyaon se nikaalane ke liye taatkaalik rup se panchamaaksharon ke ardhswaroop ke sthaan par anuswaar kaa upyog karke kaam chalaa lene kaa upaay sujhaayaa gaya tha jiske falswaroop samasamyik hindi lekhan main panchamakshar ke sthaan par anuswaar ko variyata di jane lagi he
 Generally, the xxwrep 4 n, and m of the fifth varna - 'kavarga', 'chvarga', 'tavarg', 'tavarg' and 'heaven' are used to explain the phonetics of anusvara
 jaise- ganga- ganga, pancham - pancham, kanth - kanth, kandha - kandhaa, kampan- kampan aadi
 As far as Hindi is concerned, in order to facilitate the use of Devanagari on typing machines, in some situations it was suggested to write a reminder in place of Panchamakshar
 kintu aisa nahin he ki panchamaaksharon kaa prayog varjit kiya gaya tha, yaa panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par anuswaar kaa prayog adhik shuddh ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 In some situations, some suggestions related to the use of Anusvara in place of Panchamakshars were given for Subhita
 varnmaala ke vibhinn virgon ke pariprekshya main inke prayog main parivartan sambhav he
 like- kavarg main ji kaa prayog k, kha, ga, gha ke purv hota he
 However, in some words like 'paramukh' and 'vaamay', only the use of 'om' is found
 yahan kaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 ङ The consonant does not come at the beginning and end of the word
 iske anusaar vishisht dhvanyatmak prayogon ko chhodkar is varg ke liye anuswaar kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In class, j is used before Ch, Ch, H, J
 jaise- anchal, panchhi, anjan evam jhanjhat aadi
 Although j is not used in Hindi writing often
 inke sthaan par ab anuswaar kaa hi prayog ho rahaa he
 j also does not come at the beginning or end of the word
 tavarg main n kaa prayog t, tha, da, dha ke purv hota he
 Like- Hour, gorge, egg etc
 ab inke sthaan par praayah anuswaar kaa prayog hota he
 Nāna is used only in Sanskrit words independently
 vah bhi madhya or ant main
 In addition to class, credit also comes before interest, and credit, but in such a situation, a reminder does not come in its place
 jaise- punya, kanv evam vishann
 n is used in the tavarga before t, t, d, d
 jaise- jantar, manther, tandoor, gandh aadi
 Now it is recommended to use Anusvara instead of them
 jaise- ant, panth, anand evam gandhak
 In class, m is used before P, F, B, B
 jaise- sampark, gumphit, ambar, gambheer aadi
 Now, instead of N, J, n and N, the reminder is often used in their place
 jaise- sampark, gunfit, ambar evam gambhir
 Kishori Das Vajpayee, who authored the Hindi word translation, believes that the Panchamaksharas are resonant hypnosis
 unke anusaar hindi ke rup gathan main 'ng', 'na' tathaa 'na' kaa koi yoga nahin he
 The sweetness that is in 'N' and 'M' is not in these three
 isiilie hindi ne 'na' tathaa 'm' ko hi apanaaya he
 Sanskrit words which are used in Hindi, they come in them - 'vaamay', 'chanchalya', 'panditya' etc
 vaajapeyi ji kaa maananaa he ki anuswaar kaa sthaan bhi nasika he
 According to Sanskrit grammar, 'm' is often and 'n' is sometimes a reminder
 yahi kaaran he ki anuswaar lagane se bhi swar-vyanjan madhur dhwani dene lagate hai - 'kankan kinkini noopur dhuni suni'
 As 'N' is so sweet

 Indicatively, the following rational fractions can be broken into partial fractions
 jahaan ƒ or g bahupad he
 Its partial fractions will be as follows: jahaan gj bahupad hai or ye g ke gunkhand hai
 Suppose the given fraction is r = PQ { \ displaystyle r = { \ frac {P} {Q}}}: jab diye hue bhinn ke har ko x − a { \ displaystyle x-a} jaise raikhik gunankhand ho saken ; jahaan n >=1 r = p n = a 1 + a 2 2 +
 
 
 + a nn { \ displaystyle r = { \ frac {P} {^ {n}}} = { \ frac {A1} {}} + { \ frac {A2} {^ {2}}} + 


 + { \ frac {an} {^ {n xxrep 4 } jab diye hue bhinn ke har kaa raikhik gunankhand na ho balki 2 + b 2 { \ displaystyle ^{2}+b^{2}} jaise dwighat gunkhand ho : r = p n = a 1 + a 2 2 +
 
 
 + a nn { \ displaystyle r = { \ frac {P} {^ {n}}} = { \ frac {A1} {}} + { \ frac {A2} {^ {2}}} + 


 + { \ frac {an} {^ {n xxrep 4 } Here, the denominator splits into two distinct linear factors: so we have the partial fraction decomposition Multiplying through by x2 + 2x − 3, we have the polynomial identity Substituting x = −3 into this equation gives a = −1 / 4, and substituting x = 1 gives b = 1 / 4, so that After long-division, we have Since 2 - 4 × 8 = −16 1 and it is just p if m = 1
) Thus, for instance the first derivative at x = 1 gives that is 8 = 4B + 8 so B=0
 Thus, f can be decomposed into rational functions whose denominators are z + 1, z − 1, z + i, z − i
 Since each term is of power one, −1, 1, −i and i are simple poles
 Hence, the residues associated with each pole, given by are respectively, and Limits can be used to find a partial fraction decomposition
 First, factor the denominator: The decomposition takes the form of As x → 1 { \ displaystyle x \ to 1}, the a term dominates, so the right-hand side approaches a x − 1 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {a}{x-1}}} 
 Thus, we have As x → ∞ { \ displaystyle x \ to \ infty}, the right-hand side is Thus, b = − 1 3 { \ displaystyle B=-{ \ frac {1}{3}}} 
 At x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0}, - 1 = - a + c { \ displaystyle -1 = -A + C}
 Therefore, c = - 2 3 { \ displaystyle c = - { \ frac {2} {3}}}
 The decomposition is thus 1 3 x − 1 + − 1 3 x − 2 3 x 2 + x + 1 { \ displaystyle { \ frac { \ frac {1}{3}}{x-1}}+{ \ frac {-{ \ frac {1}{3}}x-{ \ frac {2}{3}}}{x^{2}+x+1}}} 
 The piston is a component of the reciprocating engine, reciprocating pump, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders
 yah gatisheel ghatak he jo ek silendar dwaara antarvisht hota he or ise piston ring dwaara gas-tit banaaya jaataa he
 In an engine, the purpose is to transfer the force of the expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft through a piston rod and / or connecting rod
 In the pump, this work is reversible and the force is transferred from the crankshaft to the cylinder for the purpose of compressing or exiting the fluid in the cylinder
 kuch injanon main, silendar diwaar main porton ko dhakte or kholte hue piston ek valve ke rup main bhi kaary karata he
 There are two ways by which an internal combustion piston engine can convert combustion to driving power: two stroke cycle and four stroke cycle
 a single-cylinder two-stroke engine generates energy with every crankshaft rotation, while a single-cylinder four-stroke engine generates energy every two revolutions
 chote do stroke ingine ke puraane dizin, chaar stroke ingine kii tulana main adhik pradooshan utpann karte hai
 However, modern two-stroke design, such as the Vespa ET2 injection, uses fuel injection and is as clean as a four-stroke
 dijal ke bade do stroke ingine, jo jalpot or rail injanon main prayog hote hai, unamem hameshaa eendhan-injection kaa istemaal kiya gaya he or ve kam utsarjan utpann karte hai
 One of the world's largest internal combustion engines, the vertsile-sulzer RTA96-C is a two-stroke; It is larger than most two-story houses and its piston is about 1 meter in diameter and is the most efficient living mobile engine

 Some features of the close tolerance piston are given below: dabl piston kii aam visheshtaayen: Since the piston is the main part of the retraction in an engine, its mobility creates an imbalance

 To transmit the energy of the piston to the crank, the piston is connected to a connecting rod which is further connected to the crank
 kyonki piston ke raikhik andolan ko crank ke chakree aandolan main parivartit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, parinaam swaroop yantric nuksaan se guzaranaa padataa he

 Kaushitaki Brahmanopanishad is the full name of Kaushitaki Upanishad
 yah ek rigvedic upanishad he
 The Kaushitaki Upanishad is part of the Kaushitaki Brahmin of the Rigveda
 isamen kul chaar adhyay hai
 This Upanishad highlights the worship of Jeevatma and Brahmaloka, Pranopasana, Agnihotra, Miscellaneous Worship, the glory of Pranaattva and the Chaitanya element existing in Sun, Moon, Electrical Cloud, Sky, Air, Fire, Water, Mirrors and Resonance
 ant main 'aatmatatva' ke swaroop or uski upasna se praapt fal par vichaar kiya gaya he
 In the first chapter, the Agnihotra and 'phalushruti' for 'brahm Gyan' are highlighted by the dialogues of the great grandson of Gautama Rishi and Garga Rishi
 jab mrityu ke uparant sadhak brahmalok pahunchataa hai, to uskaa saamana apsaraon or ek vicitra panlag par baithe brahmaji se hota he
 He talks to them
 is vaartalap ko 'paryank-vidya' bhi kehete hai
 Maharishi Chitra, the great grandson of the sage Garga, decides to perform the yagya and invites Arun's son Mahatma Uddālaka as the principal Ritvik, but Muni Uddālaka himself does not go and send his son तvetaketu to perform the yagna
 shwethaketu apane pita kii aagyaanusaar vahaan pahunchakar ek oonche asana par virajman hote hai
 Then the picture questions him - 'hey Gautamkumar! There is such a covered place in this world, where you can take me and keep it, or even there is such a completely separate and uniquely void position, knowing that you can establish me in the same world? aisa kahkar shwethaketu yajna kaa asana chhodkar chale gayi or apane pita se prashn kiya-'he pitashri! maharishi chitra ne jo prashn mujhase kiya he, uskaa uttar main kaise duun?' shwethaketu ne chitra kaa prashn apane pita ke saamne doharaa diya
 Then the sage Uddālaka said - ‘son! i do not even know the answer
 ham donon maharishi chitra kii yajyashala main chalakar va iskaa adhyayan karke hi is vidya ko praapt karenge
 'after that, both the father-son took the help of the famous Aruni Muni and went to Maharishi Chitra with curiosity and said that they have come to him for learning
 chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! aap brahmanon main ati poojaneey hai or brahmavidya ke adhikari he; kyonki mere paas aate hue aapke man main apni shreshthata kaa tanik-bhi abhimaan nahin he
 i will certainly make you understand this
 'maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he vipravar! jo vyakti agnihotradi satkaryon kaa anushthan karne vaale hai, ve sabhi is lok se chandralok, arthath swarglok kii ore gaman karte hai, lekin jo vyakti swargeey sukh ke prati aasakt hokar chandralok sweekaar kar letaa he, uske sabhi punya nasht ho jate hai or vah pun: is dharti par waapas aa girtaa he, arthath uskaa phir se punarjanm ho jaat he
 He cannot get salvation
 'maharishi chitra ke aisa kehane par gautam muni ne phir poocha-'he bhagwan! mujhe bataayen ki main koun hoon? mujhe is bhavasaagar se paar hone kaa vah upaay bataayen, jisase main samast bhav-bandhanon se mukt ho sakuun?' Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Gautam! The seeker going through the Devayana route is able to enter the 'brahmalok' through the six loks like Agnilok, Vayalok, Suryalok, Varunalok, Indralok and Prajapatilok respectively
 'brahmalok' ke pravesh dwaar par 'ar' naam kaa ek bada jalashay he
 This reservoir is directed by enemies such as work, anger, attachment etc
 yahaan pal-bhar kaa bhi ahankaar or kaam, krodh, lobh aadi kaa bandhan, sadhak ke sabhi punyon ko nasht kar daalata he
 This reservoir is the biggest obstacle in the attainment of 'ishta', but one who crosses it again reaches the bank of the holy Virja river
 uskaa samast shram or vriddhavastha, viraja nadi ke darshan maatr se hi dur ho jate hai
 Next comes a tree called 'ilai'
 yaheen par anek devataaon ke sundar upawanon, udyanon, baawali, coop, sarovar, nadi or jalashay aadi se yukt nagar he, jo viraja nadi or ardhachandrakaar parcote se ghira he
 All these appear to fascinate the mind again and again, but a seeker who does not indulge in them and moves forward, sees a huge shrine of Brahma Ji in front of him
 is devalayas kaa naam 'aparajita' he
 It is very difficult to conquer the Sun due to its bright colors
 isaki raksha megh, yajna se uplakshith vaayu tathaa akaash-swaroop indra evam prajapati dwaara kii jaati he, parantu jo unhen parajeet kar letaa he, vah brahmalok main pravesh kar jaataa he
 There, on the altar called 'vichakshana', in the midst of a huge splendid assembly-hall, Lord Almighty appears as an almighty soul sitting on a very beautiful throne
 vishwa janani amba or ambavayavi naamak apsaraayein unki seva main rat hai, jo brahmavetta sadhak kaa swaagat karti hai or use alankrita karke brahma ji ke sammukh upasthit karti hai
 'this Upanishad shows the way to reach Brahmaloka from the Devayana route by tying a very beautiful metaphor
 yaheen par rishi kahata he ki rath main baithkar yatra karne vaala purush, jis prakaar rath ke pahiyon ko daudte hue to dekhtaa he, parantu vah pahiyon kii gati ke bhoomi se hone vaale sanyog ko nahin dekh paata
 Similarly, a seeker who travels to Brahmaloka, sitting on a chariot, sees day and night, sees the movement of time, sees sin and virtue, but does not indulge in them
 vah unase dur rahakar hi 'brahm' ko praapt karata he
 Work, anger, greed, fascination and ego do not obstruct his path
 maharishi chitra aage bataate hai-'he gautam! brahmavetta ban sadhak apni sampoorn indriyon main brahmagandh, brahmaras, brahmatej, brahmayash tathaa brahmanad kaa anubhav karata he
 Then Brahma ji asks the Brahmist - 'who are you?' At that time, the question asked by Brahma ji should be answered by the Brahmandi in this way- is prakaar brahma ji ke sabhi prashnon kaa uttar dene ke uparant swayan brahma ji sadhak se kehete hai ki 'jal' aadi prasiddh paanch mahabhoot mere sthaan hai
 Therefore, my folk is also dominated by water etc
 tum mujhase abhinn mere upaask ho
 Therefore, this is also your world
 'is prakaar vah sadhak brahma kii 'jiti' or 'vyashti', donon ko praapt kar letaa he
 'maharishi Chitra overwhelmed Gautam Rishi thus preaching' Brahm Gyan '
 rishi gautam apane putr shwethaketu ke saath maharishi chitra ko pranaam karke waapas laut gayi
 This chapter highlights the worship of 'pranatattva' and the practical side of 'theosophy'
 iske atirikt apane paapon ko nasht karne ke liye 'suryopasna' putr kii kushal-mangal kaamana or suraksha ke liye, 'chandropasna,' achche swasthya ke liye 'somopasna,'moksh-prapti ke liye 'pranompasna' tathaa putr ko apane sampoorn jivan kaa daayitv-bhaar saunpte samay 'sampradaan karm' kaa bada hi sangopang varnan kiya he
 In the chapter on worship of nature, 'prana' is considered as the form of 'brahma'
 praan kii kalpana raja ke rup main kii gayi he
 'mana' is his messenger, 'vani' is his queen, 'chakshu' is his guardian minister, 'karnendriya' is the gatekeeper accepting the message
 praan ke aate hi samast indriyon kii seva praan-rupi raja ko swat: hi praapt ho jaati he
 The well-known Mahatma accepts dry arid 'life' as Brahma
 at: praan kii upasna hi isht siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 Excellence in life, happiness, prosperity, fame, glory and knowledge can be done through pranopasana
 suryopasnakaushitaki rishi ne apane anubhav se suryopasna teen baar-praat:kaal, madhyahnkaal or sanykaal- karne kii baat kahi he
 He has said that in the morning, keep the Yajnopavit in the morning and keep it on the left shoulder
 phir jalpaatr ko teen baar shuddh jal se bharkar, udai hote hue surya ko arghya pradaan karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen—' virgosi papmanan me vriddhi
 'thus in the mid-day, remember Lord Bhaskar and chant this mantra -' ॐ Vriddhidhi in udvargosi papamanam
 ' isi prakaar sanykaal main, ast hote hue surya kii upasna karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen- ' sanwargosi papmanan me sanvruddhi
 In this way, by performing Suryopasana, all the sins of a person day and night are eradicated, the power to not commit sinful deeds is generated
 chandropasnamavasya main, jab surya pashchim bhaag main sthit ho tathaa chandramaa sushumna naamak rashmi main chandramaa sthit ho, tab is vidhi se chandropasna kerani chahie
 Also keep two green sprouts in the pot offering arghya
 tab arghya dete hue is mantra kaa uccharan karen-'yatte susiman hridayamadhi chandramsishritan tenamritatvasyeshane maahan pautramadyan rudam
 With this kind of prayer, the worshiper keeps the son from mourning and in the event of no son, he gets the son-jewel
 somopasanarishi ne somopasna ko swasth sharir kaa kaaran mana he
 He prays to Mon - 'O woman-like Mon! You attain development through the sunlight in the form of men
 tum sabhi ore se ann kii prapti main sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You are full of gentle qualities
 tumhaara divya ras surya ke tej ko praapt karke purush maatr ke liye atyant hitkaari ho jaataa he
 Confirm the men who have consumed this divine juice and be fully helpful in defeating all their enemies
 he som! tum aagney tej se prasannataa ko praapt karte hue, amritv kii prapti main sahyog pradaan karo or swayan apane yash ko swarglok main sthir karo
 Hey Mon! i follow your right hand and rotate my right arm again and again
 ' rishi ne som ko paanch mukh vaala prajapati kaha he
 His mouth is 'brahmin', the second face is 'kshatriya', the third face is 'eagle' bird, the fourth face is 'agni'
 or paanchvaan mukh tum 'swayan' ho
 In this way, after praying to Som, before touching the woman ready for conception, touch her heart and recite this Mantra - 'yeat Sumime Hridaye Hitmant: Prajapatau Manyehan Maa Tadvidwansen Ten Mahan Pautramadhan Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii gayi prarthana se sadhak ko kabhi putr shok nahi jhelana padataa
 The sage refers to the mother who feeds her milk to her children
 uske doodh main somras-jaisi rakshaatmak shakti vidyaman hoti he
 The child remains healthy with that only
 mata kaa doodh balak ke liye naiysargik prakriya he
 Resistance to nature leads to many terrible consequences
 moksh hetu pranopasanamoksh ke liye prantatva kii upasna ke sandarbh main, rishi ne ek sundar roopak dwaara praanon ke mahatv ko darshaya he
 At one time, all the gods etc
, subjugated by ego, started to dispute each other to prove their importance
 praan ke saath sabhi ne sharir se bahirgaman kar diya
 As he left, the body slept like a wood without consciousness
 'vaani' ne apana varchasv siddh karne ke liye sharir main akele hi pravesh kiya
 As soon as Vani entered, the body started speaking to Vani, but he could not get up from his place
 iske baad 'netrendriya' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 Then he started speaking with speech and looking with eyes, but this time also he could not get up
 phir 'shrotendiy' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 He started listening, speaking and seeing
 lekin is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa, nishcesht hi padaa rahaa
 Thereafter, the mind entered that body
 man ke dwaara vah sochane yogya to ho gaya, par is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then at the end 'prana' entered that body
 us prantatva ke pravesh karte hi vah sharir uthakar baith gaya
 With this, the importance of life became paramount, all other senses acknowledged the power of spiritual practice in salvation, salvation etc
 unhone janaa ki praanon ke dwaara hi amritv gun ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he or yah sharir upar uthakar swarglok kii ore ja saktaa he
 All the senses and senses of the body work through life
 at: praanon kii upasna dwaara hi brahm se sanyog kaa kaaran banataa he
 Only through life can one achieve the specific form of knowledge
 pita dwaara sampradaan-karm karnaa is adhyay main pita dwaara apane putr ko uttaradhikari banane kii prakriya kaa sangopang ullekh kiya gaya he
 The sage says that knowing that his last time has come, the father should be relieved of all his responsibilities and whatever he has, he should hand over to his son
 putr ko bhi apane pita dwaara chode gayi daayitv ko saharsha sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 The father should wear good clothes and call his son to him and say to him - 'O son! i give you my speech power, your soul, your eye, your ears, your taste, all your best deeds, your joys and sorrows, your copulatory power and kindness, your mobility, all your desires, your wisdom, your fame , Brahmatej and bestow my health and the power to digest food, etc
, or i covet within you
 ' pita dwaara aisa kehane par putr vinamrata se unhen sweekaar kare or apane baayen kandhe kii ore drushti karke haath se oot karke kahe-'pitashri! aap apni icchaanusaar kaamanayukta swarg ko tathaa vahaan ke samast bhogon ko praapt karen
 'after this, if the father is sick, then he can live with him by making or believing his son to be the master of the house or else abandon everything and leave the house to live a life of renunciation
 aisa pita uchit samay ke aane par divyalok ko gaman karne vaala hota he
 In fact, this is the correct rule of succession
 is adhyay main rishi ne praan, pragna or indriyon kaa vishad varnan karte hue unke parsparik sambandhon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 Dialogue-style has been used for this
 yahaan indra or divodas raja ke putr pratardan ke parsparik sanvaadon dwaara praan ko pragna kaa swaroop bataaya he or kaha he ki is pragna se hi lokhit sambhav he
 Once in the Devasur Sangram, Pratardan Swargalok, son of King Divodas, went to assist the Devatas
 vahaan unki adwitiya yudhkala evam shaury se prasann hokar indra ne unhen vardaan dena chaha tha
 On this, Pratardan said - 'hey Devraj! The best bridesmaid whom you consider to be the ultimate welfare for mankind, you should provide me any such best bridesmaid
 'pratardan kii baat sunakar devraj indra ne kaha-'rajan! is sansar main koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he, jo dusron ke sukh ke liye var maangata ho
 You ask for a bridesmaid that is for you? ”on this, Pratidan refused to accept any groom
 raja pratardan ko satya kaa arudh dekhakar devraj indra ne kaha-'he rajan! tum mujhe hi, mere yatharth rup ko jaano? yahi maanav-jati ke liye shreshth vardaan he
 In this statement of Devraj, Pratardan recognized that Indra did not know how many astray Asuras and sages and punishments, but Indra's hair was not deterred due to being egoless and fruitless
 tab usne samajha ki nishkaam karm karte hue or ahankaar kaa sarvatha tyaag karte hue, jo jivan jiya jaataa he, vah maanav-kalyaan ke liye hi hota he
 Therefore, it is absolutely essential for a public welfare person to be selfless and selfless
 aisa vyakti hi indra, arthath pragna-rupi praan-tatva ke yatharth swaroop ko praptaj kar saktaa he or bade-se-bada paapakarm bhi use prabhavit nahin kar saktaa
 If a terrorist has to be killed to protect the divine instincts, then he also does not feel sin
 devraj indra ne pratardan ko upadesh dete hue kaha ki jo bhi mere satya swaroop ko pahchaan jaataa he, use kabhi paap nahin lagata; kyonki, 'main swayan hi pragna-swaroop praan hum
 'indra goes on to say that i am worshiped by the age and the nectar-form, famous to me, Indra, as a self-righteous being with that soul and superior knowledge
 vah spasht karata he ki aayu hi praan he, praan hi aayu he or praan hi amritatatv he
 As long as there is life in this body, then there is age
 is prantatva ke dwaara hi sadhak duusare lok main jaakar amritatatva ke vishesh sukh ko praapt karata he
 a person who worships Indra in the form of 'age' and 'amrit', he attains Purnayu in this world and enjoys the pleasures of heaven
 sharir main praan kaa mahatva hi sarvopari he
 If any part of the body is destroyed while still alive, the body remains alive, but if the life is not there, it is impossible for the body to survive even for a moment
 kriya shakti kaa bodh karaane vaala praan hi he
 Prana itself gives the power to be the instinct in knowledge
 ise hi 'pragna-swaroop praan' athwa 'aatma' kaha gaya he
 Therefore, for the upliftment of life, this life should be worshiped in the form of wisdom
 sharir main pragna or praan, donon saath-saath nivas karte hai tathaa jeevatma ke saath milakar ek saath hi is sharir ko chhodte hai
 This is the philosophy of pranamaya parabrahma and this is science
 isi kii upasna jan-kalyaan kaa mukhya strot he
 In a dormant state, when a human is asleep, then all senses and knowledge are absorbed in life
 lekin jab vah jaagta he, tab sabhi prakaar kaa gyaan, praan se nikalakar apni-apni indriyon main samaa jaataa he or sushupt indriyaan sajag ho jaati hai
 This is explained by the example of a dying person in the Upanishads
 ek vyakti, jo maranasann avasthaa main he, uski samast chetana shakti indriyon kaa saath chhodkar praan main samaa jaati he
 At that time, he neither hears nor sees, nor speaks, has been able to move his hands and feet, nor does his brain work
 yahi sthiti dhyansth yogi kii hoti he
 But when that moribund person resurrects after getting rid of diseases or that meditation practitioner returns to a comfortable life again, then all his senses become aware again according to their nature
 man ke dwaara nirdeshit hone lagati hai
 Prana first awakens the mind
 vahi sampoorn indriyon ko niyantrit or aniyantrit karata he
 Mind is directly related to 'pragya' and Pragya is related to Prana
 is prakaar praan, pragna or indriyon kaa anyonyashrith sambandh he
 Pragnya is the intelligence and all senses are governed by the same
 sharir se unmukt hone vaala 'praan' jab utkraman karata he, tab vah us samay in sabhi indriyon-sahit hi utkraman karata he
 Vani abandons all names, nose of all smells, eye of all forms, ears of all sounds and mind of all meditative subjects
 at: sharir main praan hi vah pragna he or pragna hi vah praan he, jo ek saath is sharir main nivas karte hai
 All the senses of the body are operated by them
 pragna ke dwaara hi vah samast indriyon ke swabhaav ke anuroop anubhuti ko praapt karata he
 In the absence of wisdom, the existence of all becomes negligible
 praan athwa pragna ke bina kisi bhi rup, vishay athwa indriya kii siddhi nahin ho sakati
 Just as the chariot's names are dependent on the arrows and the chariot's navel, all senses of the same kind exist by wisdom
 yah pragna athwa praan hi paramatma kaa anandaswarup or ajar-amar rup he
 It neither gets growth by good work nor shrinks from bad work
 yah samdarshi he
 He is the ruler of all the worlds and lord of all
 yah praan hi hamaara aatma he
 Knowing this, the presence of God can be experienced
 is adhyay main gargy naamak brahman rishi or kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke madhya hue vaartalap ko aadhaar banaakar samvaad-style main brahmand kii vividh shaktiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he tathaa 'aatma' ko hi 'brahm' sweekaar kiya he
 The son of Balaka Rishi, who originated in Garga gotra, was famous as Garga Rishi
 ve chaaron vedon ke prakand vidwaan the
 Ushinar Pradesh was his residence
 ve praaia: desh ke vibhinn pradeshon main bhraman karte rahete the
 Sometimes in Matsya country, sometimes he used to reach to live in kuru-panchal
 ek baar ve ghoomte-ghoomte kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke dabaar main pahunche
 There he spoke to the king in a very egotistical voice - 'O Rajan! i will teach you 'brahmatattva'
 ' gargy rishi ke aisa kehane par kaashi naresh ajatshatru ne kaha-'he vipravar! aapke is upadesh ke liye main aapako ek sahastra uttam kul vaali guaen pradaan karuunga
 i am happy that till now Mithila Naresh Janak was the name of the listener and donator of theology
 aaj aapane hamaare paas aakar videh raaj janak kii bhaanti hamaara gaurav badhaayaa he
 While preaching "brahmattattva", there was this kind of conversation between Rishi Gargya and Ajatshatru - Sage Gargya - "O Rajan! The God who is situated in this sunrise, i practice the same with my intellect
 'ajatshatru—'he brahman! aisa nahin he
 This white robed Sun is the greatest of all
 yah sabase ucch sthiti main kendrit, sabakaa sheesh he
 The person who worships this great man in this way, he reaches the highest position
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! chandra mandal main jo yah antaryami viraat purush he, main use brahmroop main maanakar uski upasna karata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! It's not like this
 yah to som raja he or ann kii aatma bhi yahi he
 i worship this in the same way
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah nishciya hi ann kii aatma ho jaati he tathaa dhan dhaany se bhar jaataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! i am a worshiper of this interim giant Virabh Parrahm under the Electricity Board
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 i worship this electricity as 'soul of light'
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan prakaash-swaroop 'aatma' ho jaataa he
 'rishi Gargi-' o Rajan! i consider that transcendental God existing as a roar in the cloud
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa na kahen
 i worship this superior element only by understanding the soul of the word
 jo is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan hi shabd kii aatma ke rup main parinat ho jaataa he
 'rishi Gargya then said -' o Rajan! i worship the iconic Parbrahm Parmeshwar in the sky as the imperishable Brahman
 'ajatshatru ne uttar diya-'he vipravar! main is vishay main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 This complete, trend-less Brahman is greater than all
 avashya hi main isi rup main isaki upasna karata hum
 One who worships such a divine Brahman, he becomes devoid of all beings
 samay se purv uski mrityu nahin hoti
 Similarly, while advancing the conversation, the sage Gargya called the Virat Purush in the atmosphere Brahm, but Ajatashatru called him Vaikuntha with great opulence of Indra, where the frustrations are destroyed and he is always undefeated
 uske baad rishi ne agni mandal main sthit viraat purush ko, jalmandal main upasthit viraat purush ko, darpan main pratibimbit viraat purush ko, pratidhwani main sthit dhwani ko, gatisheel viraat purush ke peeche uthne vaale dhvanyatmak shabd ko, sharirdhari kii chaaya ko, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko, pragna se yukt praan-swaroop aatma ko, daahine netra main sthit viraat purush ko, baayen netra main sthit viraat purush ko avinashi brahm ke rup main upasthit karke, uski upasna karne kii baat kahi
 But Ajatashatru, denying all, respectively, Agni, who endured the fire to strike others, is the nameless soul to Brahma in the water, the image to the image, the resonance lacks motion, the phonetic word is the 'life form', the body's shadow
 The form of death, the form of Prajapati to the great man in the body, the form of Yama to the soul with wisdom, the name to the man situated in the right eye, the fire Central and light of spirit, true man in the left eye, power and said high spirit and spoke to worship in the same way
 ajatshatru kii baat sunakar gargy rishi maun ho gayi or unhone ajatshatru ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya, parantu kshatriya hone ke kaaran ajatshatru ne brahman gargy ko shishy bananaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 Yes, in solitude, he made them aware of Brahm
 ve unhen lekar ek sote hue vyakti ke paas gayi or use anek naamon se pukaar kar jagaane kaa praytn kiya, parantu jab vah nahin jaagaa, to ajatshatru ne chadi se chot markar use uthaaya
 On his waking Ajatashatru said to sage Gargya - 'O Vipravar! Where did this person sleep unconscious like this and in which state was it and now after waking up, where has it come? ' The sage Gargya could not understand this secret, so King Ajatashatru said again - 'rishiwar! The place where this man used to sleep is life-like heart
 vahaan 'hita' naam kii prasiddh naadee he
 Through him, the heart extends to the entire pulse, which is even finer than the thousandth part of the hair
 in naadiyon main purush sote samay sthit rahata he
 The 'prana' situated in the heart of this sleeping man is possible with all the senses
 yah praan hi 'aatma' kaa khol he
 This intelligent soul sits in this shell in a subtle way, like a sword in a wooden sheath
 purush ke jaagane par yah 'aatma' sampoorn 'prantatva' ko sakriy kar detii he
 Then all the senses of that 'witness-form soul' follow like a permitted servant
 'isi 'aatma' ko jaanane vaala gyani, indra kii bhaanti apane sabhi shatru asuron athwa paapon ko nasht karke triloki kaa sarvshereshth pad praapt karata he
 Therefore, to know the 'soul', renunciation of ego is absolutely necessary
 tabhi vah apane paapon kon nasht kar saktaa he
 a tree of Kalpavriksha Devaloka
 ise kalpadrup, kalpataru, surtaru devataru tathaa kalpalata ityadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to the Puranas, Kalpavriksha was also among the 14 gems obtained from Samudramanthan
 yah indra ko de diya gaya tha or indra ne isaki sthapana surkanan main kar di thi
 Hindus believe that whatever is requested from Kalpavriksha, it gives it
 iskaa naash kalpant tak nahin hota
 One such tree named 'tuba' is also found in Islamic religious literature, which always flourishes in Eden
 siddh, nath or sant kalpalata yaa kalpavallari sangya 'unmani' ko dete hai kyonki unke matanusaar sahjavastha yaa kaivalya kii prapti ke liye unmani hi ekmaatr saadhan he jo na keval sabhi kaamanaayon ko puri karanevaali he apitu swayan avinshwar bhi he or jise mil jaati hai, use bhi avinshwar bana detii he
 Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties settle their disputes through the intervention of a third person and without resorting to court
 yah aisi vidhi he jisamen vivaad kisi namit vyakti ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he jo donon pakshon ko sunne ke pashchaat ardh-nyaayik tareeke se masale kaa nirnay karata hai
 For example, referring a dispute to 'panch' or 'panchayat' is a form of arbitration
 saamanyat:, vivadakari paksh apana maamla kisi madhyastham nyaayaadhikaran ko sanderbhit karte hai tathaa nyaayaadhikaran dwaara liya gaya nirnay 'award' kehalaata he
 Arbitration is mainly used in business areas such as construction projects, shipping and shipping, patents, trade marks and brands, financial services including banking and insurance, foreign cooperation, partnership disputes etc
 samaadhaan samadhankarta kii sahaayta se pakshakaron dwaara vivaadon ke sauhardpurn niptaan kii prakriya he
 This is different from arbitration in the sense that the award in arbitration is the decision of the third party or arbitral tribunal whereas in the case of resolution the decision is of the parties which is taken from the arbitrator of the conciliator
 vivaad samaadhaan kii aisi vidhiyaan kanoonee mukademe kii tulana main kai prakaar se laabhprad hai :- The functions of an arbitrator are as follows: - jashoda nand,bharat ke uttar pradesh kii chauthi vidhansabha sabha main vidhayak rahe

 baalkon ke vyavhaar kaa ek nirikshan anayas dhang se kiya jaataa he or doosraa vishesh niyamon ke anusaar
 Among the measures used to derive pediatric statistics are the main ones: systematic scientific observation, experimentation, study of biologists, diary writing, questionnaires, insight and psychoanalysis

 Genetic factors also contribute to anorexia
 agar parivaar me kisi ko ye beemaari he to ye mumkin he ki duusare kisi sadsy ko bhi iskaa asar ho sakta he

 Tara is the wife of Vanararaj Vali in the Hindu epic Ramayana
 tara kii budhimata, pratyutpannamatitvata, saahas tathaa apane pati ke prati kartavyanishtha ko sabhi puranic granthon main saraahaa gaya he
 Tara is considered by the Hindu religion to be one of the Panchakanyaas
 puranic granthon main panchakanyaon ke vishay main kaha gaya he:- Ahilya Draupadi Kunti Tara Mandodari and
 panchakanya smaranityan mahapatak naashak
 Though Tara is portrayed only three places in the Valmiki Ramayana in the lead role, her character has left an indelible impression in the minds of those who understand the Ramayana story
 jin teen jagah tara kaa charitra mukhya bhoomika main he, vah is prakaar hai:- According to some texts, she was the granddaughter of Jupiter, the guru of the gods
 ek katha ke anusaar samudr manthan ke dauraan chaudaa maniyon main se ek apsaraayen thim
 One of those nymphs was Tara
 wali or sushen donon manthan main devatagan kii madad kar rahe the
 When they saw Tara, both of them vied to make her a wife
 wali tara ke dahini taraf tathaa sushen uske baayin taraf khadey ho gaye
 Then Vishnu decided that at the time of marriage, the girl is her husband on the right side and the father who gives the bride on the left side
 atah wali tara kaa pati tathaa sushen uskaa pita ghoshit kiye gaye
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but because both brothers had the same face and body composition, Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antatah wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Sugriva went to Kishkindha and again challenged Vali to a duel
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys Rama's patronage because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare him again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 aisi manyata he ki ram ne wali par jo tir chalaaya tha vah ek saadhaaran tir tha, arthath ram ke tarkash main anekanek astr the jinase pal bhar main jeev to kya puri kii puri sabhyataa kaa vinaash ho saktaa tha, jaise brahmastra ityadi
 But Maryada Purushottam Rama - who was an avatar of Vishnu and omniscient - shot a simple arrow because Vali does not die instantly and before he dies, he must get the answer to his questions so that he can die in peace He was able to meet his relatives well before dying
 wali ke aahat hone kaa samachar sunakar tara apane putr angad ke saath ranbhumi kii taraf bhaagi
 On the way, he finds the apes fleeing from Rann, who advised him to go back to Kishkindha with Angad and coronate Angad and avoid the wrath of Rama
 lekin tara ne us vanar samooh ko apane saath kiya or maranasann wali kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Going there, the lamentation of Tara is very important in front of the person, because no other creature besides humans mourns so much after the death of his or her own family
 pehle to tara marate hue wali ko ang lagaati he, uske pashchaat sugriv tathaa ram ko vah khari khoti sunaati he
 Hanuman intervenes and helps Tara and explains philosophy to her
 yah ek anoothaa sandarbh he ki tara ne wali kii chita main apane bhi praan tyaagane kaa sankalp liya
 This means that the practice of sati has been prevalent in our society since ancient times
 is sandarbh main itnaa hi kahana uchit hoga ki vilaap ke samay usne jo vachan kahe vah koi saadhaaran nari nahin bol sakati he
 He had a good knowledge of politics and diplomacy, and for this reason, despite the apes of the monkeys, he nominated Sugriva as king, not to crown Angad
 apane putr par koi aanch na aane paye, is kaaran usne sugriv ko apana swami sweekaar kar liya
 After Vali's slaughter, Tara thought it appropriate to accept Sugriva as the lord because he had to protect Angad's interests as well
 jab sugriv rajollas main tallin ho gaya or ram ko sita kaa dhundne kaa vachan bhul gaya to ram ne lakshmana ko use apana vachan yaad karaane ko bheja
 Laxman was quite angry anyway
 unhone kiskindha kii rajdhani pampapur main lagbhag akraman bol diya
 Sugriva realized his mistake but did not dare to face Laxman
 usne tara se aagrah kiya ki vah lakshmana ko shant kar de
 Madonmutt came out of Tara Ranivas and calmed Lakshmana
 usne maharishi vishwamitra kaa udhaaharan diya ki aise mahatma bhi indriya vishyak bhogon ke aage laachaar ho gaye the phir sugriv kii to bisaat hi kya or yah bhi ki vah manushya nahin varan ek vanar he
 Tara also described that Sugriva sent messengers to gather forces in all four directions
 valmiki ramayana tathaa anya bhashaaon ke roopantaranon main yah ullekh he ki adhkhule nayanon vaali madonmatta tara ke tarkon ko sunakar lakshmana thodi shant ho gaye or uske pashchaat sugriv ke aagaman or usase sita ko khojane kaa aashwaasan paakar waapas chale gaye
 Some regional adaptations of the Ramayana also show that at the time when Lakshman raged in the palace of the palace of the capital of Kishkindha, his first wife, Ruma, who was drinking with Sugriva, was not Tara and Bhoga Vilas
 He was engrossed in both
 yahan par yah yaad dilaanaa uchit hoga ki ram se maitri karte samay sugriv ne apane rajya ke chhin jane se bhi adhik wali dwaara apni patni rumaa ke chhin jane kaa khed prakat kiya tha
 But after getting a partner like Tara, Sugriva also forgot his beloved wife Ruma
 ramayana ke kai roopantaranon main yah ullekh aayaa he ki jab mayavi se yuddh karte samay wali ko kaafii samay biit gaya or sugriv ne kandara ke muhane main ek shila lagaakar uskaa dwaar band kar diya or kiskindha waapas aakar is baat kii soochna mantriyon ko di ki shaayad wali mayavi ke haathon maaraa gaya he, to mantranaa karke mantriyon ne sugriv ko kiskindha kaa raja chunaa or prakat rup se vidhwaa hui tara apane pati ke chote bhai kii patni sweekrut hui
 This practice is neither given the status of sin in the Valmiki Ramayana nor in its regional converts
 lekin jab wali mayavi kaa vadh karke waapas kiskindha aata he or krodh ke kaaran sugriv ko desh-nikaala detaa he or uski patni rumaa ko hadap letaa he to kiskindhakand main sugriv-ram milaap ke dauraan ram ise ghor paap kii sangya dete hai
 Even after Vali's slaughter, Tara became Sugriva's wife again
 shaayad us kaal ke samaaj main bahu-patni tathaa bahu-pati pratha kaa chalan sweekaarya rahaa ho
