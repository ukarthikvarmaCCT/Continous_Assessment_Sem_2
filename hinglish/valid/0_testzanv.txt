 Many scientists believe that genetic study of humans is not a simple task
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya jaataa he ki manushya kii santan ke janm main lagbhag 10 maas lag jate hai or ise purna vayask hone main kam se kam 20 varsh lagate hai
 Therefore, genetic study of humans is complicated due to the time it takes 20,22 years to study only one generation
 iske saath hi manushya ko ek baar main saadharantaya ek hi baccha utpann hota he, isse bhi adhyayan main kathinaayee hoti he
 Despite these difficulties, the study of external structure of human body, diseases, their symptoms and causes etc

 Many people of Japan are able to derive a lot of meaning from it by reading Chinese newspaper without knowing a single word of Chinese
 vahi akhbaar agar unhen chini main pard ke sunaaya jaae to unhen kuch bhi samaj na aaye
 It is the same thing as seeing the sign of हिन्दी, the Hindi-speaking will say 'chhatri', the English-speaking will say 'umbrella' and the French-speaking 'paraplui'
 isi vajah se chinibhashi log aksar china main paae gaye hazaron saal puraane shilaalekh dekhakar unako kuch had tak samajhane main sakasham hote hai kyonki bahut se bhavchitra lambe arase se thode-thode pher-badal ke saath chale aa rahe hai
 Although expressions are used in Chinese script, many words are written by adding sounds related to these images
 aksar shabdon main ek bhavchitra arth kaa kuch andaaza detaa he or doosraa dhwani banane main sahaayak hota he
 Therefore the Chinese script is actually a mixed form of hieroglyph and sound-based script
 udhaaharan ke liye chini main 沖 ko 'chong' uccharit kiya jaataa he or iskaa arth he 'pani kaa tej bahaav yaa lahar'
 There are three small ridges on its left which means "water"
 yah pani se sambandhit anya shabdon main bhi pai jaati hai, jaise ki 河, 河 or 流 
 To the left of Chong, it is a drawing of water but to its right is a sign of जिसका which means 'beech' and is pronounced 'jong'
 jab in donon bhavchitron ko milakar 沖 likhaa jaataa he to pathak ko yah sanket he ki arth ke liye baayein taraf kaa chinh dekho or dhwani ke liye daayen taraf dekho
 So the reader understands that it is a word related to water which will be pronounced similar to 'jong'
 is se vah bhaanp jaataa he ki yah shabd 'chong' he
 Consider that the meaning of the word Jong on the right side is not used at all and the sound of the word related to the water on the left side is not used at all

 These are called prophets in Islam
 jin nabiyon ko ishvar ne swayan shaastra yaa dharm pustaken pradaan kin unhen rasul kehete hai
 Muhammad Sahib was also a part of this episode

 The Quran describes 25 other prophets of God
 swayan quran ke anusaar ishwar ne in nabiyon ke alaava dharti par or bhi kai nabi bheje hai jinka varnan quran main nahin he
 All Muslims accept the legitimacy of all the prophets sent by God and most Muslims consider Muhammad Saheb as the last prophet of God
 ahmadiyya samudaay ke log mohammad sahab ko antim nabi nahin maanate hai or swayan ko islam kaa anuyaayi bhi kehete hai
 According to the Supreme Court of India, he is considered a Muslim in India
 kai anya pratishthit musalmaan vidwaan samay samay par pehle bhi mohammad sahab ke antim nabi hone par sawaal uthaa chuke hai
 All religious books provided by God to the Rasools are valid for Muslims
 musalamanon ke anusaar quran ishwar dwaara manushya ko pradaan kii gayi antim dharmik pustak he
 Four more books are discussed in the Quran: musalmaan yah samajhate hai ki isaayiyon or yahudiyon ne apni pustakon ke sandashon main badlaav kar diye hai
 He does not deny the possibility of having other religious books apart from these four
 musalmaan farishton ke astitv ko maanate hai
 According to him, the angels themselves have no will and only obey the command of God
 vah khalis roshni se baniin hooi amoort or nirdosh hastiyon hai jo ki na mard hai na aurat balki insaan se har lihaaz se alag hai
 Although there are uncountable angels, four angels influence in the Quran: madhya asia ke anya dharmon kii tarah islam main bhi qayaamat kaa din mana jaataa he
 According to this, God will end the world one day
 yah din kab aayegaa isaki sahi jaankaree keval ishwar ko hi he
 This is called the Day of Muslim Doom
 islam main shaareerik rup se sabhi mare hue logon kaa us din ji uthne par bahut jor diya gaya he
 On that day every human will be rewarded for his good and bad deeds
 islam main hindu mat kii tarah samay ke paripatr hone kii avadharana nahin he
 The world will not be created again after the Day of Doom
 musalmaan taqadir ko maanate hai
 The meaning of fate is for them that God knows all about the past, present and future

 Most people of the world are citizens of some state or the other

 In fact, the term 'state' can be used in three different ways

 kai raajnneetik darshanikon kii manyata he ki sabase pehle nicolo maikiyaveli ke lekhan main aadhunik arthon main rajya ke prayog ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In his famous work The Prince, published in 1532, he used the word 'stato' to describe the geo-regional sovereign government
 maikiyaveli kii ek anya rachana 'da discorsis' kii vishay-vastu alag he, lekin buniyadi vaicharik aadhaar uskaa bhi da prince jaisaa hi he
 According to Machiavelli, only the prince is independent in the monarchy, but every person in the republic is a prince
 use apni suraksha, swatantraaa or sampatti bachaane ke liye vaise hi kaushal apnaane kaa adhikaar he
 According to Machiavelli, the Prince needs to grow collectively in the Republic, and these cannot be developed on the basis of traditional virtues such as friendship and philanthropy
 ganraajya main har vyakti naam or namaa hasil karne ke makasad se duusare ke saath khule manch par sahyog karegaa
 Machiavelli believed that the Republic would be able to operate more efficiently than the monarchy, would have greater immunity and could expand its borders more efficiently through war
 maikiyaveli ke anusaar yah sab karne kii prakriya main hi shaktishaalee, adamya or aatm-nirbhar vyaktiyon kii rachana ho sakegi
 How will such republics be prevented from turning into autocracy? Machiavelli offers two conditions for this: Every republic must make an arrangement in which each person can compete creatively with the other, to prevent one person from earning so much power that he or she will dominate others
 Could
 ucch- kuleen abhijanon yaa vyapaarik prabhuvarg or aam janata ke bich prabhutv ko lekar sangharsh hota rahegaa jinke garbh se ganraajya ko nayi urja milegi or achche kanoonon kaa janm hoga, basharte behatar raajnneetik sansthaaon ke zariye un sangharshon ko kaabo main rakhaa ja sake
 There should be laws whose information can make clear to the people what they can do defiantly in the republic, and what they will have to face punishment for doing
 aarthik samruddhi kii ijazat honi chahie, par nijee str par atyadhik sampatti arjeet karne par kanuunan roak honi chahie
 The state should have a religion for the development of civic virtues, but Machiavelli was not ready to give this status to Christianity
 florence kii pratiraksha karne ke apane anubhav ke aadhaar par maikiyaveli ne nishkarsh nikaala tha ki ganraajya ko akramanon se bachaane ke liye nagarikon kii sena hona chahie
 Quentin Skinner admits that when Machiavelli discussed the kingdom, he was referring to the kingdom of a prince
 vah us arth main nirvaiyaktik nahin tha, jis arth main aaj iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the early period of European modernity, both the church and the king had political power and both had their own armies
 isse carch or raja ke bich yuddh kii bhi sambhaavna bani rahati thi
 The Treaty of Westphalia was signed in 1648 after the Thirty Years' War
 isane carch kii shakti kam kii or raja ko uske apane kshetra main praadhikaar diya
 It acknowledged the existence of sovereign states at the international level
 darshanik str par samaaj ke liye rajya kii anivaaryta sthapit karne kaa shrey satrahavin sadi ke vichaarak thomas hobbs or unki rachana levaythan ko jaataa he
 On the cover of the first edition of this book, a portrait of a giant crowned figure was carved with small human fingers
 is daityakaar vyakti ke ek haath main talwaar thi, or duusare main rajdand
 Indeed, Hobbes was an exponent of this materialistic and blissful idea that man's aim is to enjoy maximum pleasure and least suffering
 agar duusare ke anand main manushya ko sukh mil saktaa he, to hobbs ke anusaar vah paroapkaar ke liye bhi sakasham he
 But, if resources are depleted or there is some kind of fear, then human beings will be subjected to autism and immediate urges to save philanthropy
 aisi sthiti main use apane upar kisi sarkaar kaa niyantran chahie, varanaa vah apane sukh ko adhiktam or dukh ko nunatam karne kaa abaadh prayaas karte hue sabhyataa or samskruti se hin prakritik avasthaa main pahunch jaayegaa
 Fearing to lose what he has, man will be trying to reach from one point of power to the other, which will only end with his death
 agar majboot rajya ne uski in koshishon ko sanyamit na kiya to maanav jati prakritik avasthaa main pahunch jaayegi jahaan har vyakti duusare ke dushman ke rup main paraspar vinaashkari gatividhiyon main laga hoga
 In the words of Hobbes, this ultimate powerful and omnipresent state governing man is Leviathan
 hobbs ko koi shaq nahin tha ki agar yah daityakaar hasti levaythan manushya ko shasit nahin karegi to vah shanti or vyavastha hasil karne ke tarksangat nirnay par nahin pahunch saktaa
 In that case, human beings will not be able to reach a mutual agreement not to harm each other
 tarkon kii yah shrunkhlaa hobbs ko dikhaati he ki manushya ek saamaajik samjhaute ke tahat ek samaaj rachataa he jisamen har koi apana hit sadhana chahta he or isiilie dusron se qaraar karata he ki vah kisi duusare ke hit par chot nahin karegaa basharte badale main uske hit par chot na kii jaae
 Hobbes was of the view that this agreement should not be violated, so a sovereign power would be needed to guarantee public peace and security
 yah samprabhu keval takat ke dar se hi apni satta lagu nahin karegaa
 Hobbes discusses several possible constitutional forms in Leviathan's second chapter, 'the Commonwealth'
 lekin, siddhanthata hobbs avibhajit satta ke paksh main nazar aate hai
 For this, there is no harm in advocating the power of royalty
 hobbs kii nigaah main yah samprabhu nirankush nahin hoga kyonki swayan ko kaayam rakhane laayak paristhitiyaan sunishchit karne ke liye use apni praja ko ek had tak azaadi bhi deni hogi
 The distribution of material commodities and prosperity will have to be ensured in such a way that the clashes of that conflict are always cold, which often arise from the process of mutual transaction
 hobbs kaa vichaar tha ki dharm nijee maamla he, par uske saarvajanik pahaluon ko puri tarah rajya ke mukhiya ke faisale par chhod dena chahie
 The head of state should be the head of the church
 bible jin maamalon main spasht nirdesh nahin detii, vahaan rajya ke mukhiya kaa nirdesh antim samajha janaa chahie
 It is because of these ideas that Hobbes calls the Catholic Church an empire of darkness, because he demands from his followers that heresies go beyond loyalty to the kingdom

 This definition is strongly influenced by Max Weber's interpretation which he introduced in his work The Profession and Vocation of Politics
 isamen webar ne aadhunik rajya ke teen pahalu bataaye the : uski bhu-kshetreeyata, hinsa karne kaa uskaa adhikaar or vaidhata
 Weber argued that chaos would spread if an organization in a society living in a certain territory did not show people any rules and laws by showing fear of violence

 The credit for popularizing the modern street theater in India goes to Safdar Hashmi
 unke janm diwas 12 april ko deshbhar main rashtriya nukkad naatak diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Thus, drama and theater started in the open, that is, the nook was the first place used in the play of plays
 aadim yug main sab log din bhar kaam se thak jane ke baad manoranjan ke liye kahi khule main ek gheraa banaakar baith jate the or us ghere ke bichon-bich hi unka bhojan pakataa rahata, khan-paan hota or vahi baad main naachna-gaanaa hota
 Thus the process also involved the presence of three essential elements associated with street plays from the beginning - an enclosure as a performance venue, the intimate connection between the audience and actors, and the stories, events and events directly related to the audience's everyday life
 Staging plays
 madhyakaal main sahi rup main nukkad naatakon se milti-julati natya-style kaa janm or vikaas bharat ke vibhinn praanton, kshetron or boliyon-bhashaaon main lok naatakon ke rup main hua

 a methodical form of this came in the form of the birth of an institution like IPTA, when people from different art mediums came together across India and started protesting against foreign rule and power through staging and demonstrations of revolutionary songs, plays and dances

 Sometimes it was the promotion of stories, sometimes religion and sometimes political ideology
 kisi bhi yug or kaal main is tathy ko rekhaankit kar sakate hai
 Today, big commercial-business companies are using street plays to promote their products, the government system uses mediums such as street plays to propagate their policies and directives and political parties will be able to use their party on election days
 People are attracted to this mode for publicity

 This form of theatrical performance helps in establishing direct communication with the public
 isamen drishy parivartan nahin hota or kalakaar vibhinn sanketon ke madhyam se isaki soochna dete hai, jise darshak aasaani se samaj jate hai

 Continuous use can also be bad when the user does not benefit from it
 nirantarata ke teen mahatvapurn pahalu hai
 First of all, controls for different features should be presented in the same way so that the users get the controls easily
 For example, users find it difficult to use the software when some command menu, some symbol, some right click Mediums are available, some under a separate button on one corner of the screen, some grouped by work, some grouped by "common", some "by" Are grouped by Nt "
 kisi aadesh ko khoj rahe upyogkarta ke paas satat khoj ranneeti honi chahie
 jitani adhik khoj ranneetiyaan hongi upyogkarta ke liye khoj utani hi or adhik niraashajanak hogi
 jitna adhik satat samoohikaran utani hi aasaan khoj
 Second, the "principle of least astonishment" is important

" anya hai "paathya vastu kaa chayan karen, tab chaynit ke liye karrwai lagu karen
"

 Third, the continuity advice version-per-version changes towards the user interface
 parivartan kam se kam hona chahie or aage kii anukulata banaai rakhi jaani chahie
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft ofis 2003 main menu baar se microsoft ofis 2007 main riban tulbaar main badalane se punardizine ko mishrit pratikriya mili jiskaa uddeshy sarvaadhik prayukt kaaryon ko sulabh karana tha
 It was said that this caused "anger and frustration" and "major efforts in time, training and cost"
 Power users said the new interface "takes a lot of time and patience to learn
 " excel upyogkarta samooh dwaara ek online surveykshan ne bataaya ki parivartan ke prati lagbhag 80% uttardaataaon kii raay nakaaratmak thi or is 80% menutpaadakta main swa-anumaanit kami "kareeb 35%" thi
 Continuity in user interface design is not a gross but one of the most important
 kuch maamalon main, nirantarata siddhanton kaa ulanghan paryaapt spasht laabh pradaan kar saktaa he or ek budhimaan or saavdhaan yuzar interfes diziner kuch anya mahatvapurn lakshya praapt karne ke liye nirantarata kaa ulanghan kar saktaa he
 Generally, less mature software has fewer users who are immersed in the same position
 puraane or adhik vistrut rup se prayukt software ko vighatnkaaree laagat se bachane ke liye yathapurv sthiti ko adhik dhyaan se dur karnaa chahie
 sabase anbhavi upyogkarta or jo ek program se sabase adhik laabh praapt karte hai, ye ve upyogkarta hai jo badalane par sabase bada kharch vahan karte hai
 However, consistency is one of the most important core principles in such exchanges and it should be violated at least
 Poor user interface design and poorly implemented changes to an existing user interface can cost users dearly
 jin alag alag tareekon se upyogkarta kisi utpaada kaa upyog kar sakate There are two terms used to describe them in UI design
 rupatmakataa ek hi utpaada ke kai vaikalpik interfes ko sanderbhit karti he jabaki paddati usee interfes kii vibhinn sthitiyon kaa varnan karata he
 Transmission is the path modulation applied by the user interface to move input and output
 roopaatmakataa ke udhaaharan hai: The user interface can implement many redundant input and output modalities, allowing the user to select interactions
 ek mod ek computer program main sanchaalan kaa alag tarika he jisamen computer program kii sthiti ke aadhaar par ek hi input alag kathith parinaam utpann kar sakate hai
 For example, capslocks starts an input mode in which the typed characters will be uppercase by default and the characters from the same typing will be in lowercase if Caps is not in lockmode
 Heavy use of the method often reduces the applicability of the user interface as the user has to try to remember to switch between the current mode state and the mode state as needed
 chakravaal vidhi anirdharya varg samikarnon ko hal karne kii chakree vidhi he
 This also solves Pell's equation
 iske avishkaar kaa shrey praaia bhaskar dwitiya ko diya jaataa he kintu kuch log iskaa shrey jayadev ko bhi dete hai
 This method is named 'chakrawal') because in it, after attaining quality from Kuttak, again the class is typified and again Kuttak is done
 628 i main brahmagupta ne This was solved for the smallest integers x and y
 ve n ke kuch hi maanon ke liye iskaa hal nikaal sake, sabhi ke liye nahin
 Jaidev and Bhaskar first presented a solution to this equation using the Chakraval method
 unhone nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa hal diya he- The following solution has been given by him- yah samasya bahut kathin samasya he kyonki x or y ke maan bahut bade aate hai
 Its difficulty can be estimated from the fact that it was solved in Europe by William Browner in 1657-58
 apane bijganit naamak granth main bhaskaracharya ne chakravaal vidhi kaa varnan is prakaar kiya he- Mirza Ghalib is a 1954 Hindi language film

 kai macrocycles ke rup main karyrat hai macrocyclic ligands
 a macrocycle prefix is named after the beginning with cyclo, citing the most senior unit in the cycle from an order of seniority established, sequentially citing the remaining units in order in the direction of the less closest unit to the next seniority
 Followed by pul bhi kramik rup se uddhrut kar rahe hai, jabaki substituents substitutional siddhanton se uddhrut kar rahe hai
 Some scattered reports for synthetic macrocycles done prior to 1960, for example Linstead, Elvidge and co-workers reported the synthesis of various types of macrocyclic compounds in the 1950s, some of which are similar to potential trivalent and tetra-toothed porphyrins and phthalocyanines
 are ligands
 ve tamba, nikal, cobalt, aadi jaisi dhaatuon ke saath parisaron farm ke liye 1960 ke dashak main suchit kiya gaya curtis newjiland main kaam kar trisethylenediaminenickel perchlorate or asitone ek mecrosaiclic utpaada main jiske parinamswaroop ke bich pratikriya kaa varnan kiya
 In general, macrocycles are synthesized from small, usually linear, molecules
 vahaan rahe hai do pramukh shreniyan synthesizing ke liye macrocycles, praathamikta donon main kiya ja rahaa karne ke liye adhiktam paidaavaar ke liye aavashyak utpaada chunane ke dwaara, jo ranneetiyon ko baadhit pratispardhaa raikhik polymerization or anya pratikriyaaon he
 This cyclization proceeds do not require a conventional biological reaction, a metal ion of any kind of directional effect

 Some cyclizations are facilitated by the presence of metal ions, which helps to organize the macrocyclic ligand
 The metal ion acts as a 'template' for the cyclization reaction
 Phthalocyanine tha pehali synthetic macrocycle dwaara utpaadit template pratikriya he
 Metal ions can direct condensation preferentially to the cyclic rather than polymeric product or stabilize the macrocycle once formed
 template ke rup main istemaal kiya keshan ke aakaar Schiff aadhaar system ke liye synthetic maarg nirdesan main mahatv kaa sabit hui he
 The compatibility between the radius of the templating cation and the "hole" of the macrocycle contributes to the effectiveness of the synthetic pathway and the resulting geometry of the compound
 mecrocyclic prabhaav apni khuli shrinkhalaa anuroop kii tulana main ek mecrosaiclic ligand kii badi gatij or thermodynamic stabilities ko darshata he
 It was expected for a complex to show higher stability with an increase in the number of chelate rings, but an improvement in the stability of macrocyclic ligands was expected in magnitude much greater than the sole presence of an additional chelate ring
 Cabbiness or Margerum dwaara 1970 main kaarykaal mecrocyclic prabhaav kii coining karne ke liye is atirikt or apratyaashit sthirataa kaa netritv
 The study suggests the induction of various thermodynamic and kinetic parameters resulting in this effect
 Porphyrins chaar pyrrole sab uniton se bana heterocyclic mecrosaiclic yogicon kaa ek samooh he, sab ek methine pul ke madhyam se α carbon par paraspar rup main varnit hai
 They have been the subject of major research since the mid-20th century because of their wide distribution within nature
 ve aam taur par is tarah ke rup main yaa to hime lohe yaa magnesium yogicon kii dhaatu parisaron ke rup main maujuud hai
 They serve as artificial groups in a vast amount of primary metabolites, such as myoglobins, catalases, chlorophylls, and cytochromes

 As one of the earliest points of interest within the field, ion transport of macrocycles mainly revolves around crown ethers and cryptands
 haal ke prayaason se kuch keshan parivahan kii daron ke niyantran kii suvidha ke liye switch pradaan karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Two primary examples of the types of switches that have been developed are switches using photo cryptands, and electrical switches using Anthraquinone derived lasso ether

 Once recognition of substrates other than metal ion can be achieved, new catalysis applications can be made
 Macrocycles chote anuon ke na sirf bada sanskaran hai, lekin lagata he ki pradarshan kar kaaryaatmak up domen biomolecules ke sabase chote udhaaharan ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Macrocycles are highly potent and are also found to be selective
 ve ek lakshya kii sataha ke liye dhaalnaa or badhyakaari baatcheet ko adhiktam karne ke liye lacheela kar rahe hai
 They also exhibit physical and pharmacokinetic properties such as good solubility, lipophilicity, metabolic stability and bioavailability, despite having a molecular weight higher than that stated in Lipinski's regulations
 marcocycle kii ek ullekhneey aavedan tumor imaging or photo gatisheel chikitsa ke bheetar chikitsa ke bheetar he
 Overall, the most standard treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy and all of these treatments have major side effects due to loss of specific organ function
 haalanki, Photodynamic therapy tulana paramparaagat upachaar main chalaaya hua he or sambhavit jabaki saamaanya ang ke utakon se bachane ke ghaatak cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht karne ke liye paas
 PDT has many notable advantages versus that of traditional therapies, being implemented in places where surgery is not possible offering alternative options for older patients who are vulnerable to conventional treatments, and, ultimately, the specific ones associated with chemotherapy Exhibits of organ poisoning are not included

 Through this, written messages can be transferred to computers connected to a network
 yujanet kai hajaar forum or samachar samoohon ko ek duusare se jodta he
 Newsgroups are actually like bulletin board systems
 is par bheje jane vaale sandesh ek badhate kram main dikhaai dete hai
 When a new discussion is started on a message, a new topic is added to it
 newsgrup par sabhi sadsy sandesh pard kar us par apni pratikriya de sakate hai
 While giving feedback, members can also give their identity by hiding it
 yujanet ek tareeke se jalsthal par panjikrut kiye gaye sadasyon ke us forum kii agali kadi he, jahaan net par charchaa kii ja sakati he
 Its specialty is that there are more people and more opportunities to debate in depth on a subject than in the newsgroup
 isaki madad se sadsy twarit gati se anya sadasyon se jud sakate hai yaa phir unhen pratikriyaayein de sakate hai
 To become a part of Usenet, news server help is to be taken
 vahaan tak google dwaara bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The major difference between BBS and Usenet is that BBS has only one network and can operate only in a limited area
 bibies main ek sangathit kram hota he or uske har sadsy ke liye ek vishay tay hota he
 Every newsgroup is identified by its subject
 isi se isaki ek sarini yaa suchi banati he, nae log is suchi se vishay ke anusaar sandesh pard sakate hai
 On the other hand, Usenet's network is global and people from all over the world can respond by writing their messages
 ek yujanet pathak ke liye apni pasand ke anusaar newsgrup chunanaa or uske vishay par likhnaa yaa charchaa main shaamil hona saral hota he
 Hindi is also used on Usenet on the Internet
 saamanyatya logon kii yahi dharna hoti he ki pathakon kii ruchi badhaane ke liye bloging sabase sahi tarika he, kintu aisa nahin he
 Blogging is one-way communication of a particular person, two-way communication is best, that is the basis of discussions
 iske liye yuzanet sarvottam he
 Usenet traffic has increased over time
