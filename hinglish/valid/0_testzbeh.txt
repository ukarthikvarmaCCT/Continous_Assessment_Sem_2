 [[category: Hindi Institute}} saanchaa:grammatical categoriesvyakaranika kaal kisa bhi sthiti yaa kriya ke samay ko kriyaapad ke dwaara, par, ke dauraan yaa se pare vyakt karanevaali ek kaalik bhashavaigyanik gunvattta he
 Kaal is at least one of the four qualities, with emotion, voice and aspect, which can make the expression clear
 kaal ek abhivyakti ke ghatnakram ke saath samayik sandarbhon kaa viparyaas vyatirek darshaate hai
 All languages use the same tense - present, past and future, although the expression of these tenses cannot always be explicitly translated from one language to another
 While all languages have typical forms of verbs by which they are identified and sorted into dictionaries, generally the most common present tense or a simple form, the methods used to express their tenses, differ between languages
 kuch aisi bhashaaen hai jinamein kaal kriya rup ke madhyam se antahkunchit nahin hota or na hi sanrachanaatmak drushti se abhivyakt hota he, balki iske bajaay, jab bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tab, samayik kriya visheshan ke istemaal se antarnihit kiya jaataa he or kuch main samayik jaankaree antahkunchit visheshan ke istemaal dwaara prakat hoti he
 In some languages a single verb may be intermixed to indicate aspect and tense simultaneously
 ek bhashaa main kaal kii sankhya vivadagrast ho sakati he, kyonki kaal sangya samayik abhivyakti, atirikt pahalu or yahan tak ki bhav pradarshit karne ke liye aksar galat maani jaati he
 In many texts, the term time mistakenly refers to the quality of uncertainty, frequency, nudity, duration, probability, and even whether information is derived from experience or from rumor
 It is not actually tenses, but traditional nomenclature often classifies them as such
 hakeekat main, sabhi bhashaaon main saamaan kaal hote hai
 They are usually divided into three groups - present, past and future, in which each category is defined in a defined sense
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal vah hote hai jinamein swayan kathan ke samayik sandarbh se pehle avyav kriya ke samayik sandarbh ghatit hote hai
 Past tense can range from simple past / past to immediate past / past, distant or distant past / past as well, there is only one difference between them and that is, the distance on the events between the occasional reference points
 angrezi main kaal do prakaar ke samoohon main vibhajit he - shuddh kaal or kriyabhaav dyotak kaal
 shuddh kaal vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein dwitiyak samayik sandarbh purnataya nishchit samajha yaa janaa jaataa he
 In other words, pure tense refers to expressions in which attestation is believed to be true or known
 duusari ore, kriyabhaav dyotak kaal vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann kii nischitata purnataya nishchit nahin he
 In English, this form is expressed by adding a verb adverb, adverb signifier adverb or adverb signifier adverb
 kriya ghataane se keval angrezi main bhoot kaal abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In all the raw and infallible aspects, the past tense is expressed using the indirect form of the aspectual complement, tha / were, to be)
 gaiyr-kalavadhi pahaluon main, bhoot kaal ek vishesh antahkunchit rup ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen abhimukhataa poorak 'kar liya' ko chhod kar avyav kriya kaa paroksh upyog kiya gaya he
 This form is possible only in a few positive lectures
 kathan ke sabhi anya prakaaron main, pheravat rup niojit kiya janaa chahie
 The present tense is expressed by an unmarked form similar to the past tense, but in this the aspectual complement is forbidden only in agreement with the person and number in the inflection forms (is / is, is / is)
 jaisaa ki bhoot kaal ke saath he antahkunchit rup kuch sakaaratmak vyakhyanon ke liye upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 In English, the pure future tense is expressed in the same way as the present tense, but with a future-signifying adverb or time phrase
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal yaa to ek purnataya sweekrut kriyabhaav dyotak rup ke istemaal dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he yaa ek atirikt kriyabhaav dyotak kriya visheshan yaa padbandh ke saath ek shuddh kaal rup dwaara
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal sabase aksar bhavishyakaal abhivyakt karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The verb denote future refers to any of the eight future forms in which attestation cannot be called true due to the uncertain nature of future results
 These forms vary according to certainty and always express that level of future certainty within the intent of a supportive mood
 neeche die gaye soochiptr main "janaa" kriya ke prayog se kuch indo-europi or phino-argic kaal main kaal abhivyakti ke udhaaharan dikhaae gaye hai
 The tenses are broadly classified as present, past, or future
 in vyapak vargikarnon ke bheetar kai sambhavit kaal maujuud hai
 The difference between these periods is mainly the degree of occasional distance from the time of narration
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal kii saamaanya shrenee ke bheetar, tatkaal ateet, sudur ateet, dur sudur ateet or doorvarti ateet maujuud ho sakate hai, inamen antar keval kathan ke ghatnakram ke saath kathan ke samay se duuri main badhottaree kaa he
 Some languages not only distinguish between past, present and future, but also between non-past, non-present, non-future
 Both later periods include the first two, without explaining which they are doing

 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language

 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 It is also said that the time-domain figure changed to the frequency-domain

 If a given set of real or complex numbers: x, n ∈ z { \ displaystyle x, \ ; n \ in \ mathbb {Z}}, then the DTFT of x { \ displaystyle x \ ,} is often expressed as is: x = ∑ n = − ∞ ∞ x e − i ω n 
 { \ displaystyle X= \ sum _{n=- \ infty }^{ \ infty }x \ ,e^{-i \ omega n}
} Discrete-time sequence will be regained after the following conversion: The integrals span one full period of the DTFT, which means that the x samples are also the coefficients of a Fourier series expansion of the DTFT
 Infinite limits of integration change the transform into a continuous-time Fourier transform, which produces a sequence of Dirac impulses
 That is: Below are some standard discrete time sequences and their dtfts

 We use the following notation: The first column provides a description of the property, the second column shows the function in the time domain, the third column shows the spectrum in the frequency domain: Furrier transformations can be expressed as the sum of real and imaginary or even and odd

 Hepatitis c is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis c virus HCV and affects the liver
 Its infection is often asymptomatic, but once it occurs, long-term infection can rapidly lead to liver damage and further damage, which usually manifests after several years
 In some cases, some patients with cirrhosis may develop liver cancer or develop other complications of cirrhosis such as liver cancer and life-threatening esophageal varices and gastric varices

 An estimated 270–300 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C
 Hepatitis c is a completely human disease
 It cannot be obtained from any other animal nor given to them
 Chimpanzees can be infected with this virus in the laboratory, but they do not develop the disease, which has made the experiment more difficult
 There is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C
 The presence of hepatitis c "non-hepatitis") was assumed in the 1970s and finally proven in 1989
 It is one of five hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, E

 Hepatitis c virus is usually detected in the blood approximately one to three weeks after infection by PCR and antibodies to the virus are usually detected between 3 to 15 weeks
 There is maximum variation in natural viral clearance rates, and 10–60% of people with HCV are able to isolate the virus from their bodies during the acute phase, as demonstrated by normalization of liver enzymes and aspartate transaminases) and plasma HCV-RNA clearance

 Recent data suggest that roughly one-third of untreated patients develop liver cirrhosis in at least 20 years
 In the other one-third of people, cirrhosis develops within 30 years
 The rest of the patients develop so slowly that there is no risk of cirrhosis in their life
 In contrast, the NIH unanimous guideline states that the risk of developing cirrhosis is 3–20 percent over a period of 20 years

 Symptoms of liver disease are usually absent especially until the liver is actually harmed
 However, hepatitis c is a somatic disease and patients may notice a wide difference in clinical performance from the absence of symptoms to the onset of a serious illness
 Pervasive symptoms associated with chronic hepatitis c include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, lump pain, itching, nightmares, loss of appetite, nausea, and depression

 Liver enzyme tests show different elevations of ALT and AST
 From time to time, they can also show normal results
 The results of prothrombin and albumin are usually normal but may be abnormal once cirrhosis occurs
 Elevation levels of liver tests do not coincide with liver damage on biopsy
 Viral genotype and viral load also do not coincide with liver injury
 Liver biopsy is the best test to accurately determine damage and inflammation
 Radiographic studies such as ultrasound or CT scan do not show liver damage if not advanced enough
 However, non-invasive tests such as the fibro test and actitest are coming up to assess liver fibrosis and necrotico-inflammation, respectively
 These tests have been confirmed and have been recommended in Europe

 Although injecting drug use is the most common route of HCV infection, any action or activity or condition in which there is a possibility of blood-to-blood contact may be a potential source of HCV infection
 The virus can be transmitted through sexual contact, but it is rare and usually occurs only when an STD causes lesions to open and hemorrhage and increases the likelihood of more blood contact

 Currently, people who have used or used injections for drugs have an increased risk of Hepatitis C
 It is believed that these people may have used shared needles or other drug paraphernalia, which could be contaminated by hcv-infected blood
 It is estimated that 60% to 80% of intravenous recreational drug users in the United States are suspected to be infected with HCV
 Harm reduction strategies to prevent the spread of Hepatitis c in many countries encouraged education, provision of clean and safe needles and syringes, and safe injection techniques
 Currently the United States has seen a decline in broadcasting through this route, the reasons for which are not yet clear

 People may be exposed to HCV through inadequate or improper medical or dental equipment
 Improperly disinfected devices can carry contaminated blood including needles or syringes, hemodialysis equipment, oral hygiene equipment, and jet air guns
 The risk of HCV iatrogenic can be reduced to zero by diligently using appropriate techniques of punctuality and sterilization and destroying the equipment used

 If proper sterilization techniques are not followed, HCV infected blood can be transmitted from person to person even when tattooing, dyes, stilts, and piercing tools
 Tackling or piercing "underground" or non-professionally before the mid-1980s is of concern because sterile techniques may be inadequate in such settings to prevent the spread of disease; The use of shared tattooing devices increases the risk of HCV exposure
 In fact, this was the reason Pamela Anderson officially had to say: "I shared hepatitis c with my ex-husband Tommy Lee using a single needle for a shared tattoo
" Tommy had the disease and he never told me about it during our marriage
 "the U
S
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on the subject, "transmission of hepatitis c and other infectious diseases is possible if tattoos are made or body pierced by informal centers or infected equipment
" Despite these risks, HCV infection is difficult to get tattooed in approved facilities

 Long-term hepatitis c can be suspected based on medical history, history of tattooing or piercing, undefined symptoms, abnormal liver enzymes, or tests performed during routine blood tests
 Hepatitis c is usually diagnosed on blood donation occasions and contact tracing

 The anti-hcv virus indicates a risk, but it is not known whether the infection is present
 All people who have been found to have positive anti-hcv should undergo additional testing for the presence of Hepatitis c virus to find out if there is currently an infection
 Polymerase chain reaction PCR, transcription mediated amplification TMA or branched DNA were tested to detect the presence of viruses and the use of molecular nucleic acid testing methods
 All HCV nucleic acid molecular tests not only have the ability to detect whether a virus is present but also have the ability to measure the amount of virus present in the blood viral load)

 Hepatitis c virus causes chronic infection in 50% to 80% of infected persons
 About 50% of these do not respond during treatment
 Long-term HCV carriers have little chance of eradicating the virus
 However, in most patients with chronic hepatitis C, it will not end without treatment

 In some cases, it may also cause temporary disability
 a good proportion of patients will experience side effects such as 'flu-like' syndrome ranging from anemia, heart problems and psychiatric problems like suicide or thoughts of suicide
 The latter problems are exacerbated by the general physical stress experienced by the patient

 HCV antibodies transmitted from mother to child can remain until 15 months of age
 If early diagnosis is desired, testing can be done for HCV RNA between 2 and 6 months of age and can be independently tested again after the first test results
 If a later diagnosis is preferred, an anti-hcv test may be performed after 15 months of age
 Most babies infected with HCV at birth do not have any symptoms and spend childhood well

 It is estimated that around 200 million people worldwide are infected with Hepatitis c and more than 3-4 million people are infected with it every year
 There are approximately 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year in the United States
 It is currently the major cause of cirrhosis and a common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
 As a result, it has become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the US
 Co-infection of HIV is common in HIV positive population and the rate is also high
 There are 10,000–20,000 deaths from HCV in the United States every year
 This death rate is expected to increase as the number of those who got infected due to transfusion before HCV testing became clear

 In the United States, approximately 350,000 or 35% of patients infected with HIV are also infected with the hepatitis c virus
 The main reason for this is that both viruses are blood borne and exist in the same population
 HCV is the main cause of chronic liver disease in the United States
 Clinical studies have shown that HIV infection is rapidly causing chronic hepatitis c to cirrhosis and liver failure
 It cannot be said that treatment is not an option for people living with co-infection

 In the mid-1970s, Harvey J
, head of the infectious diseases department at the blood transfusion department of the National Institutes of Health
 Alter and his research group proved through their research that most of the post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not caused by hepatitis a or b viruses
 Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify a virus initially called non-a, non-b hepatitis NAABH failed for the next century
 In 1987, Michael Huffton, qui-lim Chu, and George Quo teamed up with Dr
 DW Bradley of the CDC at Chiron Corporation to use molecular cloning to identify unknown organisms
 In 1988, Alter confirmed the presence of the virus in view of its presence in a panel of samples of AANBH
 After the discovery of the virus in April 1989, its new name, Hepatitis c virus, was published in two articles in the journal HCV Science
 chiron ne virus or uske nidaan par kai patent daayar kiye
 sidisi dwaara daayar pratispardhi patent aavedan ko 1990 main us samay kaarij kar diya gaya jab chiron ne sidisi ko 1

 adaalat main haarane ke baad 1998 main usne maamla waapas le liya
 In 2000, Dr
 Alter and Huffton were awarded the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research, "pioneering work such as discovering viruses that spread the disease like hepatitis c and developed screening methods that led to the 1970's in the US In 2000, 30% of hepatitis cases due to blood transfusion decreased to zero in 2000

 Viramidine is an alternative drug in place of ribavirin, which benefits the liver and may be more effective against hepatitis c when given the prescribed dose, which is currently in Phase III of the experimental trial
 It will be used in combination with interferon, as used for ribavirin
 However, this drug is not expected to be effective in strains resistant to ribavirin, which had not previously been used and failed in ribavirin / interferon treatment at the time of infection

 kiliestogamas phool swaparagit hote hai, jiske baad ve khul bhi sakate hai yaa shaayad nahin bhi
kai prakaar ke viola or salvi prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Insectivorous flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 saamanytah phulon ke anek bhaagon main ek granthi hoti he jise paraag kaha jaataa he jo in kiton ko aakarshith karti hai
 Some flowers have structures called madhursa instructions that tell pollinators where to find honey
 phool paragakon ko khushboo or rang se bhi aakarshith karte hai
 Yet some flowers mimic or imitate to attract pollinators
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch orchid kii prajatiyaan phool srujit karti hai jo kii maadaa madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khushboo se mail khate hai
 Flowers are also experts in forms and stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollinator when it lands on its attracting Vastu
 However, the pollen transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly equally
 vaataparageet phool vaayu kaa istemaal paraag ko ek phool se agle phool tak le jane main karte hai udahaaran ke liye ghaasein, santi vriksh, emborsia jati kii raig ghans or esar jati ke ped or jhaadiyaan

 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem on an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite
 phir bhi kuch paudhon ki naslon main phool apurna yaa ek lingeey hote hai: yaa to keval punkesar yaa strikesar angon ko dhaaran kiya hue
pehle maamle main agar ek vishesh paudha jo ki yaa to maadaa yaa purush he to aisi nasl ko dioisius mana jaataa he
 But if a sexual male or female flower appears on the same plant, such a species is called monoecious

 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers

 phulon kii ek vishisht sanrachana hoti he jo kii unhen ek hi nasl ke paraag ko ek paudhe se dusre paudhe main sthantarit karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America

 Still others use mimicry to attract pollinators, for example the flowers of some species of some orchids match the color, shape and fragrance of bees
 nar madhumakhi aise hi phulon main se ek phool se dusre phool par saathi kii talash main ghoomte rahete hai
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paraagan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insectivorous: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another

 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs
 ye ghanisht sambandh vilopan ke nakaaratmak prabhaav ke rup main yogic ho jate hai
 In such a relationship, the deletion of even one means that the deletion of almost the other member also
 The reason for some endangered plant species is a decrease in the population of dying pollinators

 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization

 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity
