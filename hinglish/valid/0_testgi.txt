 Although the available records of this period are incomplete, Edward Chancellor in his book Devil Take the Hindmost says that there exists some evidence that betting in these stocks expanded rapidly and perhaps the first speculative bubble in "stocks" was revealed

 Economic historians find the Dutch stock market of the 1600s particularly interesting: the use of stock futures, stock options, bear sales, the use of debt to buy shares, the bursting of the betting bubble in 1965 and the fashion changes that unfolded And returned on time with the market
 Dr
 Edward Stringham also noted that despite the government passing laws against methods such as the sale of bears, their use continued throughout this period
 This is unusual, as it indicates that individual parties were legally fulfilling ineligible contracts and in which the parties could be harmed

 However, shareholders' rights over the assets of the company are inapplicable from the rights of the company's creditors
 shairdharakon ko kuch log hitdharakon kaa aanshik subset maanate hai, jisamen aisa koi bhi shaamil ho saktaa he jiskaa vyavsaayik satta main pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh equity main ruchi ho yaa gair-laabhakaari sanghathan main arthetar dilchaspee rakhane vaala koi bhi vyakti
 is prakaar sangheey hitdharakon main svaichhik anshadaataaon ko aahanit karnaa saamaanya ho saktaa he, bhale hi ve shairdharak naa hon
 Although the directors and officers of the company are bound by fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the shareholders, the shareholders in general have no such duty to each other
 tathaapi, kuch asaamaanya maamalon main, kuch adaalatein shairdharakon ke bich aise kartavya samavisht karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 For example, the majority shareholders of closely connected corporations in California of the United States have a duty not to destroy the value of shares held by minority shareholders

 In the general case of a public commercial business corporation, where there may be thousands of shareholders, it would be impractical that everyone participate in the daily decisions required to run the company

 Thus often the original owners of the company still have control of the company
 haalanki 50% sheyaron kaa swaamitv, ek company ke 50% swaamitv main parinat nahin hota he, tathaapi yah shairdharak ko company ke bhawan, upkaran, saamagree, yaa anya sampatti ke upyog kaa adhikaar nahin detaa he
 This is because the company is considered a legal person, thus it owns all its assets
 yah beemaa jaise kshetron main mahatvapurn he, jo mukhya shairdharak nahin, apitu company ke naam par honi chahie
 In most countries, the board of directors and the managers of the company have the fiduciary responsibility to run the company in the interests of their stakeholders
 Nevertheless, as Martin Whitman writes: haalanki nideshak mandal dwaara company chalaaya jaataa he, company kii niti par shairdharak kaa kuch prabhaav hota he, kyonki shairdharak hi nideshak mandal kaa chunaav karte hai
 Each shareholder generally has a vote percentage equal to the percentage of shares owned by him
 atah jab tak shairdharak sahamat hai ki prabandhan kaa nishpaadan kharaab he, nae nideshak mandal kaa chunaav kar sakate hai jo nae prabandhan dal ko rakh saktaa he
 In practice, however, truly contested circles are rare
 aam taur par mandal ke ummidavaaron ko andruni sutara yaa swayan nideshak mandal namit karte hai or stock kii ek paryaapt raashi andruni sutron dwaara dhaarit or vot di jaati he
 Ownership of shares does not mean liabilities responsibility
 yadi ek company diwalia ho jaataa he or uske dwaara rinon kii chook hui he, to shairdharak kisi bhi tarah se jimmedaar nahin hai
 However, the money received by converting assets into cash will be used to repay the debts, so that shareholders will not receive any money until the money has been paid to all creditors

 sabase aam upaay he share dalal ke madhyam se
 chaahe ve purna seva hon yaa batta dalal, ve ek vikreta se kharidaar ke liye stock ke antaran kii vyavastha karte hai
 Most trading is actually done through brokers listed on a stock market
 chayan ke liye purna seva dalal yaa batta dalal jaise kai alag share dalal maujuud hai
 Full service brokers typically charge a higher fee per trade, but offer investment advice or more personalized service; Discount brokers offer little investment advice or no advice, but charge less for trading
 ek anya prakaar kaa dalal ek bank yaa credit union ho saktaa he jinke paas purna seva yaa batta dalal saude kaa set-ap hota he
 There are other ways to buy shares through brokers
 ek zariyaa he company se hi sidhe kharidi
 yadi kam se kam ek share kaa swaamitv he, to adhikansh companiyaan unke niveshak sambandh vibhaagon ke zarie sidhe company se sheyaron kii kharidi anumat karti he
 However, the initial share of the company's stock must be obtained through a regular stockbroker
 Another method of buying stock in the company is direct public distribution offers, which are usually sold by the company itself
 ek pratyaksh saarvajanik peshkash ek praarambhik saarvajanik vitaran prastaav he jisamen aam taur par bina dallalon kii sahaayta ke, company se sidhe stock kii kharidi kii jaati he
 As far as financing of purchase of stock is concerned, there are two ways: the purchase of stock by money which is currently owned by the buyer, or by the purchase of stock on margin
 The purchase of stock on margin means the purchase of stock from the money borrowed against the stock in the same account
 These stocks, or collateral, guarantee that the buyer can repay the loan; Otherwise, the stock broker has the right to sell the stock to repay the borrowed amount
 yadi share mulya apekshit margin se neeche aa jaataa he, to vah khate main stock ke mulya kaa kam se kam 50% bech saktaa he
 Buying on margin works in the same way as buying a car or house, borrowing money using a car or house as collateral
 Also, the loan is not free, the broker usually charges 8-10% interest
 share bechnaa vyavahaaratah share kharidne ke samaan hi he
 Generally, the investor wants to buy at a lower price and sell at a higher price, if not in that order; However, an investor can incur a myriad of reasons to sell at a loss, e

 To avoid further damage
 share kii kharid ke samaan hi, vikreta se kharidaar ko stock ke antaran kii vyavastha hetu dalal ke prayaason ke liye len-dein shulk lagata he
 This fee may be higher or lower, depending on the type of brokerage, full service or discount transaction
 len - dein hone ke baad, vikreta sabhi paise kaa hakdaar he
 An important piece of sales is to keep searching news about income
 The important thing is that in the jurisdiction where the shares are sold, the additional proceeds, if any, which are more than the cost basis, will have to be paid on capital gains tax
 share kii keemat main maang or aapurti ke mul siddhant ke kaaran utaar-chadhaav aata he
 Like all commodities in the market, the share price is sensitive to demand
 tathaapi, kisi vishisht stock ke liye maang ko prabhavit karne vaale kai kaarak maujuud hai
 The fields of fundamental analysis and technical analysis attempt to understand the market conditions leading to price changes, or forecast future price levels
 haal hi kaa ek adhyayan darshata he ki america graahak santushti suchakank dwaara maape gaye anusaar graahakon kii santushti, share ke bazaar mulya se visheshtah sah-sambhddha he
 The share price may be influenced by the analyst's outlook for the company's business forecasts and the company's general market segment
 kisi bhi samay, kisi equity kaa mulya darasal aapurti or maang kaa parinaam he
 Supply is the number of shares presented for sale at a given time
 maang bilkul usee samay niveshak dwaara kharidne kii ichha vaale sheyaron kii sankhya he
 The share price varies to achieve and maintain equilibrium
 jab bhavi kharidaaron kii sankhya vikritaon kii sankhya se adhik ho, to mulya badhata he
 Ultimately, sellers attracted by high selling prices enter the market and / or buyers exit, thereby achieving a balance between buyers and sellers
 jab vikritaon kii sankhya kharidaaron kii sankhya se kam hoti he, to mulya gir jaataa he
 Ultimately buyers enter and / or sellers leave, regaining balance
 is prakaar, kisi nishchit samay par company ke share kaa mulya sabhi niveshkon dwaara apane paison ke saath matdaan dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 If more investors want shares and are willing to pay more, the price will go up
 If more investors are selling shares and there are not enough buyers, the price will fall
 beshak, yah spasht nahin karata he ki log kaise adhiktam mulya kaa nirnay lete hai jis par ve khareednaa chaahate hai yaa nunatam mulya, jis par ve bechney ke liye taiyaar hai
 The efficient market hypothesis continues to gain popularity in the realm of commercial investment, although this theory has been widely suspected in the academic and business sectors
 sankshep main, EMH kahata he ki samagratah nivesh tarksangat he; ki kisi nishchit kshan main share kii keemat gyaat jaankaree ke tarksangat moolyankan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jiskaa company ke bhavi mulya ko prabhavit kar saktaa he; or yah ki equity ke share mulya kushaltapurvak nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai, taatpary yah ki nishchit samay par jitani acchhee tarah gyaat ho sake ve stock ke pratyaashit mulya kaa sateek pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In other words, discount prices are the result of anticipated future cash flows

 Kavishiromani Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri barooth di spinoja yahudee mul ke dach darshanik the
 His changed name was 'benedict de Spinoza'
 unhone ullekhneey vaigyanik abhikshmata kaa parichay diya kintu unke kaaryon kaa mahatv unke mrityu ke uparant hi samjha ja sakaa
 Spinoza was born in 1632 in Holland, a Jewish family
 ve swabhaav se ekantapriya, nirbhik tathaa nirlobh the
 He was shown greed to abandon his beliefs, conspired to assassinate him, was excommunicated from the Jewish sect, yet he remained adamant
 sansaarik jivan unako ek asay rog ke samaan jaan padataa tha
 Therefore, he used to be restless to get rid of him and attain God
 spinoja kaa sabase prasiddh granth unka 'athiks' he
 But in addition to this he has practiced seven or eight texts
 principles ov philasphi tathaa metaphysical cojitations kaa prakaashan 1663 main or trectatus thiologico polyticas kaa prakaashan 1670 main, bina unke naam ke hua
 His three incomplete texts are Tractractus Politicus, Tractatus de Intelectus Emendadione, Grammatis linguis Hebresi - published in 1677 the same year after his death, with his main treatise Ethics
 bahut dinon baad unke ek or granth trectatus brevis di deo kaa pataa chalaa, jiskaa prakaashan 1858 main hua
 Many texts have been written about Spinoza's life and philosophy, which are listed in Spinoza in the Light of Vedanta
 is kalpana kaa ki dravya kii sristi ho sakati he at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv dravya hai, spinoja ne ghor virodh kiya
 Matter is self-illuminated and independent, it cannot be created
 at: vichaartatv or vistaartatv, jo srist hai, dravya nahin balki oopaadhi hai
 Spinoza atheists can be said to mean that he opposed the idea of god prevalent in Judaism and Christianity
 spinoja kaa dravya yaa ishwar nirgun, niraakaar tathaa vyaktitwaheen sarvyaapee he
 To somehow make God special is to limit it
 is arth main spinoja kaa ishwar advait vedant ke brahm ke samaan he
 Just as Brahman has two titles, name and form, similarly Spinoza's two titles of matter are thoughts and extensions
 ye dravya ke gun nahin he
 Like the form of Brahman's form, matter also has properties that are proved by its form, such as its uniqueness, independence, perfection etc
 vichaar tathaa vistaar ko gun na kahkar oopaadhi kahana adhik uparyukt he, kyonki spinoja ke anusaar ve dravya ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye buddhi dwaara aropit hai
 Such infinite titles are valid for Spinoza
 ishwar kii ye oopaadhiyaan bhi aseem hai parantu ishwar kii nissimta nirpeksh he vahaan in oopaadhiyon kii aseemta saapeksh he
 God is the creator of the world, but not in the form that he creates the whole world with his willpower
 vastav main ishwar main ichhashakti aropit karnaa usko simit karnaa he
 But this does not mean that God is not independent; His freedom is his secularism, not his free will, because of this Spinoza does not consider the world to be the purpose
 ishwar jagat kaa kaaran usee arth main he jisamen swarnapind aabhushan kaa yaa akaash tribhuj kaa
 But this does not mean that God is changeable
 jagat kalpit he kintu uskaa aadhaar ishwar satya he
 God and the world are different, but not divisible
 jis prakaar ishwar main ichhashakti nahin he vaise hi manushya main bhi swatantra ichhashakti naam kii koi vastu nahin he
 The reality is that each thought is caused by another thought, so no idea is independent
 saath hi spinoja kii vichaaragegat par bhautik jagat kaa prabhaav nahin padataa
 The work-cause-chain is different but both are the same substance, so they seem related
 vyavhaarajagat main spinoja niyativaadee jaan padate hai
 They say that the rejection of willpower does not affect our behavior and conduct, so it is unnecessary to avoid it
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki yadi hamako yah drudh nishchay ho jaae ki sansar kii kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa icchanirpeksh he to hamako badi shanti mili
 Man remains unrestful as long as there is hope for change in the cause-chain
 ichaswatantray main vishwaas hi hamaara bandhan he
 Desire freedom should be used to resolve will
 ichaswatantray ke shaman se rajsik vritti tathaa maansik vikaron kaa shaman hota he or man ishwarchinthan ke yogya hota he
 The ultimate goal of life is the attainment of God, because only then can the attainment of eternal death
 ishwar kii prapti ishwar se prem karne se hoti he parantu prem kaa arth bhavukta nahin balki tanmayata he
 This is why Spinoza called this love intellectual love
 ishwarathnmayata kaa ek arth yah bhi he ki ham sadachaar sadachaar ke liye karen, kyonki sadachaar ke uplakshya main pratifal kii ichha rakhana ek bandhan kii sristi karnaa he
 When our mind becomes divine and our outlook is a constant approach, then we experience identification with God and attain absolute peace
 spinoja ke vichaar main ishwar ke sagun saakaar rup kaa bhi mahatv he
 This imagination is very useful for those whose intellectual level is low and for those who have awakened faith in their mind by virtue, realization of God
 ishwar ko na maanane kii apeksha sagun saakaar ishwar ko maananaa shreyaskar he
 Spinoza's idea was all-encompassing, which is why in today's era people are increasingly looking towards Spinoza

 kuch vidwaan jaise jaik goodi kehete hai ki "veda ek maukhik samaaj ke utpaada nahin hai", is drushtikon ko greek, srbija or anya samskritiyon jaise vibhinn maukhik samaajon se sahitya ke sancharit sanskarnon main visangatiyon kii tulana karke is drushtikon kaa aadhaar rakhte hue, us par dhyaan dete hue vaidic sahitya bahut susangat or vishaal he jise likhi bina, pidiyon main maukhik rup se bana diya gaya tha
 However, says Gowdy, Vedic texts are likely to be included in both a written and oral tradition, calling it "parallel products of a literacy society"

 There has been a tradition of study and interpretation of Vedas in India since ancient times
 vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm anusaar arshyug main brahma se lekarvedavyasathatha jaimini tak ke rishi-muniyon or darshanikaun ne shabd,pramaan ke rup main inhen ko maane hai or inke aadhaar par apane granthon kaa nirmaan bhi kiye hai
 Parashar, Katyayan, Yajnavalkya, Vyasa, Panini etc
 are called Vedavetta of ancient times
 vedon ke vidit hone yani chaar rishiyon ke dhyaan main aane ke baad inaki vyakhya karne kii parampara rahi he 
 Therefore, as a result only one Vedka form has been considered as four mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads
 itihaspurana aadi mahan granth vedon kaa vyaakhyaanke swarupamen rache gaye
 In ancient times and medieval times, scriptures have been due to this interpretation and interpretation
 mukhya vishay - dev, agni, rudra, vishnu, marut, saraswati ityadi jaise shabdon ko lekar hue
 In the view of Vedavetta Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati, knowledge, deeds, worship and science are subjects of the Vedas
 jeev, ishwar, prakruti in teen anadi nity sattaaon kaa nij swaroop kaa gyaan keval veda se hi uplabdh hota he

 Although in today's era we are creating a feeling of unity, unity and love in the whole world, but in the period when Britain ruled India, many myths arose from the translation of Vedas by some Anglo translators
 yah koi dosha nahin balki sonchi samajhi sajeesh thi
 His main task was to hollow out India and convert Hindus to Christians

 "but the historians of the same period proved that it is only a myth and there is not even a lot of truth in it and the ancestors of Hadappa Mohenjo Daro were also Aryans

 Some patriots like Bal Gangadhar Tilak also came to these British talks and started writing in a utopatang manner
 unase jab poocha gaya to unhone bataaya ki ve to jo kuch likhe, angrejon ke vaidic anuwaad kaa adhyayan karke hi likhe
 India has become independent now, but this plant which the British had sown is still growing fruit and flower

 This omnipotent text of Vedic Age is also known as 'vedatrayi'
 pehle yah veda granth ek hi tha jiskaa naam yajurveda tha- ekaivasid yajurveda chaturdhah vyabhajat punah vahi yajurveda punah rik-yajus-saamah ke rup me prasiddh hua jisase vah 'trayee' kahalaaya | baad main veda ko padhanaa bahut kathin prathit hone laga, isliye usee ek veda ke teen yaa chaar vibhaag kiye gaye
 Then he came to be known as Vedatrayi in the form of Rigyajusam or Chaturveda as Rigyjusamatharva after a long time
 mantron kaa prakaar or aashay yani arth ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya
 Its basis is as follows - vaidic parampara do prakaar ke he - brahm parampara or aditya parampara
 The Vedatrayi tradition of both traditions was famous in ancient times
 vishwa main shabd-prayog kii teen sheliyaan hoti he: padya, gadhy or gaan
 There are three such divisions 'verse, prose and song' of Vedas mantras - padya main akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam kaa nishchit niyam hota he
 Therefore, the noun of fixed letter-number and Ved-mantras with foot and punctuation is 'rik'
 jin mantron main chand ke niyamanusaar akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam rishidrisht nahin he, ve gadyatmak mantra 'yajuh' kehalaate hai or jitne mantra ganaatmak hai, ve mantra ‘'sam'’ kehalaate hai
 On the basis of these three types of word-publishing-styles, the word 'trilogy' is also used for Veda in scripture and folk
 yajurveda gadhysangrah he, at: is yajurveda main jo rugveda ke chandobaddh mantra hai, unako bhi yajurveda padhane ke samay gadhy jaisaa hi padhaa jaataa he
 The said four divisions of the Vedas were not separate before the end of Dwaparyuga
 us samay to rik, yajuh or sam - in teen shabd-shaileonme sangrahatmak ek vishisht adhyayaneey shabd-raashi hi veda kehalaati thi
 Atharva also became attached to Veda's counterpart after that, then in place of 'trilogy' he started being called 'chaturveda'
 When the Guru was angry, Yajnavalkya, who received all the Vedas from Aditya, said in his memory after Vedatrayi and in front of Puranas, including Atharva, Veda s Tharvapuranani eti
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar hai- lekin pehle ye ek hi the
 In the present tense, the Vedas are considered four
 parantu in chaaron ko milakar ek hi 'veda granth' samajha jaataa tha
 Significantly, despite the trilogy, the Veda was one, then it was divided into four parts
 sunne se failane or peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhane ke kaaran vaa srishtikarta brahmaji bhi apaurushey vanike rupame praapt karne ke kaaran shruti, swatah pramaan ke kaaran amnaay, purush bhinn ishvarkrut hone se apaurushey ityadi naam vedon ke hai
 Hearing and remembering Gurmukh in the order of reading and reciting the Veda is of great importance in terms of the preservation and success of the Veda
 isi kaaran veda ko ‘'shruti'’ bhi kehete hai
 The Veda is conserved through diligent practice, hence the name "amnaya"
 vedon kii raksharth maharishiyon ne asht vikrutiyonki rachana kii he -jataa maala shikha rekha dhwajo dando ratho ghanah | ashtau vikrutyah prokto krampurva maharaayah || jiske falswarup pracheen kalke tarah aaj bhi hrasv, deergh,plutt or udaatt,anudaatt swarit adike anurup mantroccharan hota he
 Accordingly, the classification of the Vedic word-zodiac of each branch - each Veda mentioned above has four parts
 pehle bhaag mantrabhag ke alaava anya teen bhagako veda na maanane vaale bhi hai lekin aisa vichaar tarkpurna siddh hote nahin dekha gaya hai
 In the eternal Vedic tradition, mantra, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishad are the four components of the same Veda
 kul milakar vedake bhaag ye hai :- Despite the above four sections being Vedas, some people consider only 'samhita' as Vedas
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke samay shrikrishnadwaipayan vedavyas ji ne yagyanushthan ke upyog ko drushtigat rakhkar us ek veda ke chaar vibhaag kar diye or in chaaron vibhaagon kii shiksha chaar shishyon ko di
 These four divisions are famous as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 pel, vaishampayan, jaimini or sumantu naamak -chaar shishyon ko kramshah rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda kii shiksha di
 These four disciples taught Shakal etc
 to their different disciples
 in shishyon ke dwaara apane-apane adheen vedon ke prachaar va sangrakshan ke kaaran ve vaidic granth,charan ,shakha, pratishakha or anushaakha ke madhyam se bahut rupame vistaarit hogaye | unheen prachaarak rishiyon ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The aforementioned four disciples started as many disciples as they were called Charanasamuh
 Each stage has many branches in us
 or isi tarah pratishakha,anushaakha aadi ban gaye
 Several branches of the Vedas, that is, the method of lecture, have been described
 rishi patanjali ke mahabhashya ke anusaar rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 101, samaveda kii 1001, arthvveda kii 9 is prakaar 1131 shakhaaen hai parantu aaj 12 shakhaaen hi mul granthon main uplabdh hai
 The Vedic words of each branch of the Veda are available in four parts: 1
 Samhita 2
 Brahmin 3
 Aranyaka 4
 Upanishads
 kuch log inamen samhita ko hi veda maanate hai
 The remaining three parts are considered as the interpretation texts of the Vedas
 alag shakhaon main mul samhita to vahi rahati hai lekin aaranyak or brahman granthon main antar aa jaataa he
 Upanishad is also found in many mantras, as in the Shuklayujurveda mantrabhag, the Isavasopanishad
 In the old times, there were as many branches as there were mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 Babajud of such branches is also found in texts of only 9 branches today
 anya shakhaonme kisiike mantra,kisiike brahman,kisiike aaranyak or kisiike upanishad hi paaya jaataa he
 Not only this, even more branches are found in Upanishads, only then more Upanishads are found

 vedon ke vishay unki vyakhya par nirbhar karte hai - agni, yajna, surya, indra, som, brahm, man-aatma, jagat-utpatti, padaarthon ke gun, dharm, daampaty, dhyaan-yoga, praan jaise vishay isamen barambar aate hai

 In ancient times it had 101 branches but at present it has only five branches - Kathak, Kapisthal, Maitrayani, Taittiriya, Vajasaneyi
 is veda ke do bhed hai - krishna yajurveda or shukla yajurveda

 parantu aajkal teen hi prachlit hai - kothumiya, jaimineey or ranyneey
 It is divided into anterior and posterior

 There are a total of 640 mantras in all the four scandals

 Thus there are a total of 650 spells in the Purvartik
 chah prapathak hai
 Uttarachik is divided into 21 chapters

 Most of the mantras in it are derived from the Rigveda

 Many subjects are described in this, Mathematics, Science, Ayurveda, Sociology, Agricultural Science, etc
 kuch log isamen mantra-tantra bhi khojate hai
 While this Veda preaches Brahm Gyan, it also explains the way of salvation
 ise brahm veda bhi kehete hai
 It is also called Atharva Angiras mainly due to the mantras of Rishis and Atharvan
 yah 20 kandon main vibhakt he
 There are many sutras in each kand and there are mantras in sutras
 is veda main kul 5977 mantra hai
 Its two branches Shaunik and Piplad are available today
 atharvaveda kaa vidvan chaaron vedon kaa gyaata hota he
 In the Yajna, the Rigveda calls for the Gods, the Samaveda is the oblation, the Yajurveda's Adhvaryu Dev: finishes the coterm and the Atharvaveda's Brahma controls the entire Yagya Karma
 ayurveda, dhanurveda, gandharvaveda tathaa sthapatyaved- ye kramshah chaaron vedon ke upved katyayan ne batalaaye hai
 For all round practice of Vedas, there are texts of education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda and astrology which are called 6 parts
 pratipadsutra, anupad, chandobhasha, dharamshastra, nyaay tathaa vaisheshik- ye 6 darshana upang granth bhi uplabdh he
 The topics of appendages are as follows - veda kii samhitaon main mantraksharon main khadi tathaa aadi rekhaayen lagaakar unke ucch, madhyam, yaa mand sangitamay swar uccharan karne ke sanket kiye gayi hai
 They are named as the sublime, Anudatta and Swarit
 ye swar bahut pracheen samay se prachlit hai or mahamuni patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main inke mukhya mukhya niyamon kaa samavesh kiya he
 Vowels are spoken more or less as they also have two distinctions
 jaise udaatt-udaattatar, anudaatt-anudaattatar, swarit-swaritodatt
 Apart from these, there is considered to be another vowel - Shruti - the three vowels merge in it
 is prakaar kul swaron kii sankhya 7 ho jaati he
 Even in these seven vowels, there is a distinction between the vowels for which there is some change in the vowels
 yadhyapi in swaron ke ankan or tankan main kai vidhiyaan prayog kii jaati hai or prakaashak-bhashyakaron main koi ek vidha saamaanya nahin he, adhikansh sthanon par anudaatt ke liye akshar ke neeche ek aadi lakeer tathaa swarit ke liye akshar ke upar ek khadi rekha banane kaa niyam he
 Sublime has no sign of its own
 isse ankan main samasya aane se kai lekhak-prakaashak swar chihnon kaa prayog hi nahin karte
 There are many types of verses used in Vedic mantras, the main ones are- iske anusaar vedokt yagyon kaa anushthan hi veda ke shabdon kaa mukhya upyog mana gaya he
 From the beginning of the creation, there has generally been a diversity in the style, chanting and rituals of chanting
 is vividhta ke kaaran hi vedon kii shakhaon kaa vistaar hua he
 There are 21 branches of Rigveda, 101 branches of Yajurveda, 1000 branches of Samaveda and 9 branches of Atharva Veda - thus there are a total of 1,131 branches
 is sankhya kaa ullekh maharishi patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main bhi kiya he
 Out of the above 1,131 branches, currently only 12 branches are available in the original texts: - uparyukt 12 shakhaon main se keval 6 shakhaon kii adhyayan-style praapt he-shakal, taittareey, madhyandini, kaanv, kauthum tathaa shaunak shakha
 It would also not be inappropriate to say that some other texts of other branches are available, but they cannot get full introduction of the branch and the names of many branches are also not available
 jaisaa ki upar likhaa he, vedon ke kai shabdon kaa samajhnaa utana saral nahin rahaa he
 In order to understand the real meaning of Vedanka, Vedangauka was invented from within
 Because of this, the meanings described in them cannot be known
 Most of the controversies have been about the nature of God, that is, the one or the like of many gods
 vedonke vaastavik arth vahi kar saktaa he jovedang- shiksha,kalp, vyakaran, nirukt,chand or jyotishka gyaata he
 The interpretation of Sanskrit scholars of Europe has also been inspired by the theory of indo-aryan caste
 pracheen kaal main hi inaki satta ko chunauti dekar kai aise mat prakat hue jo aaj bhi dharmik mat kehalaate hai lekin kai roopon main bhinn hai
 Their main differences are explained below
 uname se jiskaa apana avichhinn paramparase veda,shakha,or kalpasutron se nirdeshit hokar ek adwitiya brahmatatvako iswar maanakar kisi ek devvadame na ulajhakar vedavadame raman karte hai ve vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm mananevaale he ve hi vedonko sarvopari maanate he
 Apart from this, there are some sects who hold different views and consider them as separate gods
 jin vishyon par vivaad rahaa he unka varnan neeche diya he
 Yajna: There is a contradiction in many scholars, opinions and commentators regarding the importance of the present form of Yajna
 yajna main aag ke prayog ko pracheen parsi pujan vidhi ke itnaa samaan hona or havan kii atyadhik mahatta ke prati vidwaanon main ruchi rahi he
 Deity: There has been disagreement among many scholars about the word Dev
 vedokt nirgun- niraakaar or sagun- saakaar me se antim pakshako maanane vaale kai maton main ise mahamanushya ke rup main vishisht shakti praapt saakaar charitra masajhate hai or unka murti rup main pujan karte hai to anya kai inhen ishwar ke hi naam bataate hai
 Philanthropic things, learned people and guiding mantras have been called devas
 udaahranarth agni shabd kaa arth aag na samajhakar sabase aage yani pratham yani parameshwar samajhate hai
 The meaning of the deity Shavad is considered divine, that is, full of the power of God - like earth etc
 isi mat main mahadev, devon ke adhipati hone ke kaaran ishwar ko kehete hai
 Similarly, due to the universal God Vishnu and truth everywhere, it is called Brahma
 is prakaar brahma, vishnu or mahadev kisi charitra ke naam nahin balki ishwar ke hi naam he
 Vedic and temporal words are used to determine the meaning of grammar and nirukta
 iske abhavame arthke anarth kar baithte he
 Similarly, Ganesh, Prajapati, Devi, Buddha, Lakshmi etc
 are the names of God
 vedadi shastronme aae vibhann ek hi parameshwarake he
 As has been said in the Upanishads - Eko Dev Sarvabhuteshu Gudha: Omnipotent Sarvabhutanthatraatma
 Some people quarrel in the nature of God
 inmese koi murtipuja karte he or koi aise log he jo murtipuja ke viruddh hai or ishwar ko ekmaatr satya, sarvopari samajhate hai
 Ashwamedha: From Ashwamedha comes the idea of violence and sacrifice
 yah kai hinduon ko bhi ascharyajanak lagata he kyonki kai sthanon par shuddhtavaadi hinsa se parhez karte rahe hai
 Many believe that Advaram is also used in the word Medha, which means non-violence
 atah medh kaa bhi arth kuch or rahaa hoga
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Ashwa must have been power rather than horse
 shriram sharma acharya krit bhaashayon ke anusaar ashv shabd kaa arth shakti, gau shabd kaa arth poshan he
 With this, the meaning of Ashwamedha seems to be different from horse sacrifice
 som:kuch log ise sharaab maanate hai lekin kai anuwaadon ke anusaar ise kuta-piskar banaaya jaataa tha
 Therefore, it does not look like a drink
 par iske asli rup kaa nirdhaaran nahin ho paaya he

 17 farvari 2009 ko, GSM association ne ghoshnaa kari ki ve mobile phone ke liye ek maanak charger par sahamat hue hai
 The standard charger adopted by the 17 manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola, should be the micro USB connector

 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates
 t-mobile allows its account holders to open a SIM code after a good 90 days Provide according to the FAQ
 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
 In the US, competition in these types of services does not exist because some major service providers do not offer pay-when-you-go service

 500 years later the serpent of Kadru's eggs appeared

 An undeveloped child came out of it, the subdivision was not developed, the subdivision did not develop, he was furious and cursed the mother to be the slave of Kadru for 500 years and said that if the second egg does not boil prematurely, then it will give the fully developed child to the mother
 Will release from slavery

 Vinata and Kadru once went out for a walk

 The next day there was talk of horse color
 vinata ne uskaa rang safed bataaya tha tathaa kadru ne uskaa rang safed, par poonch kaa rang kaala bataaya tha
 Kadru had fraud in his mind

 He cursed the snakes who did not obey his command that they should be consumed in the yagya of Janamejaya

 Later he reached Amrit
 atyant sookshm rup dhaaran karke vah amritaghat ke paas nirantar chalane vaale chakra ko paar kar gaya
 Two snakes were guarding there
 un donon ko markar vah amritaghat uthaakar le uda
 Seeing that he himself did not drink the nectar, Vishnu was pleased at his insipid gesture and gave him a boon that without saying that drink the nectar too it would be ajar-immortal and his place on the Vishnu-flag

 He informed the snakes that he had brought the nectar
 sarp vinata ko daasitv se mukt kar den tathaa snaan kar len
 He placed the nectar-kalash on misrule until Indra stole the nectar after the snake returned by taking a bath
 sarpon ne kusha ko hi chata jisase unki jeebh ke do bhaag ho gaye, at: ve dwijive kahalaane lage
 Indra was very jealous of the Balkhilya Maharishi

 Kashyapa married Suparna and Kadru

 lautne par kashyap ko gyaat hua
 They worshiped Shiva after the sages said
 shiv ke prasann hone par unhen aashirwad mila ki donon nadiyaan ganga se milakar pun: nari-rup dhaaran karengi
 When this happened, Prajapati Kashyap performed a marginal promotion of both
 yajna ke samay kadru ne ek aankh se sanket dwaara rishiyon kaa uphaas kiya
 Therefore, she became angry with his curse
 kashyap ne pun: rishiyon ko kisi prakaar prasann kiya
