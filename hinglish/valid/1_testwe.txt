 kesamutti sutt yaa kalam sutt tipitak ke angutar nikaay main sthit bhagwaan buddha ke upadesh kaa ek ansh hai
 People of Buddhism's Theravada and Mahayana sects often refer to it as a proof of the Buddha's support of 'free thinking'
 kesamuttisutt ke anya bhashaaon main naam is prakaar hai- Pali literature has a special place in world literature
 vishwa ke praayah sabhi bhashaa-saahitiyon ko is bhashaa tathaa iske vishaal sahitya ne prabhavit tathaa pallavit kiya he
 It has a very important place in the development of fiction, philosophy and intellectual literature
 yah sahitya sampoorn vishwa main naitik tathaa adarshavaadi sahitya ke vikaas main sadiyon se mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa aa rahaa he
 a detailed and authentic description of the then history, philosophy, culture and traditions is available in Pali language, but for its scientific, valid, welfare and human teachings, this literature is a special place of reverence in the world
 pali sahitya atyant vishaal tathaa vistrut he
 The Buddha-recitations received in it were mainly compiled into three parts, which are thus divided - Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka
 vinay-pitak main bhikkhuon va bhikkhuniyon ke aachaar-niyamon kaa sankalan kiya gaya he
 The teachings assigned by Lord Buddha in sutta-pitaka are mainly compiled
 abhidhamm-pitak main darshan-sambandhi tattvon kii samikshaayen sangrahit kii gai hai
 Because in the sutta-pitaka, the teachings of Lord Buddha and his principal disciples are mentioned
 is kaaran upaask-varg ke liye is pitak kaa bahut adhik mahatva he
 In the sutta-pitaka, the art of living the spiritual and physical life happily through beautiful similes and metaphors in a very simple and comprehensible style has been taught according to the Buddhist tradition
 sutt-pitak paanch bhaagon main uplabdh hota he
 In these five parts, the Angaadva-nika has a special place due to its specialness
 angutar-nikaay kii visheshta he ki is nikaay main 1 se lekar 11 kii sankhya ke kram main ankon ke adhar par bhagwaan buddha ke upadesh sangrahit kiye gayi hai

 atah adhyay ko hi nipaat kii sangya se janaa jaataa he

 is tarah kramshah ekadask-nipaat tak gyaarah-gyaarah prakaar se dharm kii vyakhya kii gai he
 Increasing the numbers from ekk-nipat, Duk-tik-chattak-panchak-chhak-sattak-atthak-nav-dasak-ekadasak, thus increasing the post-order increment
 atah ‘anguttaranikaay’ yah naam purnatah sarthak tathaa samuchit hi prathit hota he
 Anga means numeral in the word Angush
 in ankon kaa uttar arth main hone par angutar shabd siddh hota he
 Answer is intended here in the direction of calculation of digits respectively
 is prakaar yah angutar nikaay naam sarthak tathaa upyukt he
 The way the Angamukta body's Kesamuti Sutta talks about awakening scientific consciousness and intellectualism and denying superstitions and stereotypes is an example in itself
 dhai hajaar varshon purv itani aadhunik, vaigyanik tathaa taro-taaja vichaar-paddati ko upasthaapit karne vaale bhagwaan buddha sach hi kitne mahaan vaigyanik or vimarshak the
 Two and a half thousand years ago, Buddha said so many scientific things, which can show the path to science even today
 nishchay hi yah sutt vigyaan ke liye ek kasuti hi he
 The knowledge conveyed by addressing the Kalams in the Kesamutti Sutta of the Angusakya body holds a special place in the entire literature
 vastutah is sutt ke vaigyanik drushtikon ke kaaran hi buddha sahitya tathaa buddha-gyaan parampara pratishtha ko praapt hui
 Kesamuti Sutta is not very big in Pali language, but it has great importance
 isamen varnan aayaa he ki bhagwaan buddha apane vishaal bhikkhusangh sahit kosal janapad main charika karte hue cese-mutt naamak kalaamon ke nigam main pahunche
 The Kalam people also knew Suyash of Lord Buddha in the past as 'itipi so saffron arham sammasambuddho vijchacharanasampanno sugato lokavidu anutaro purisadhammasarathi sattha devamanusasan buddha saffron'
 atah ve bhagwaan buddha ke darshan karne ke liye unke paas pahunche
 Going to him, the Kalams, expressing their curiosity, asked, 'O bhunte! Some of the shraman-brahmins come to the case-mutt Corporation
 ve yahan apane hi mat kii prashansa karte hai tathaa dusron ke mat kii ninda karte hai or dusron ke mat ko nicha dikhaate hai
 Again, other shraman-brahmins do not get tired of coming here and praising their opinion and condemning the views of others
 ’1 After presenting his talk in this way to Lord Buddha, he asked God, 'O bhunte! Praising our opinion and polluting the opinion of others raises doubts in our minds about who has told the truth and who lies among these shraman-brahmins? tab kalaamon ke man ke shaq kaa shaman karte hue mahaan vaigyanik tathaa manashchikitsak bhagwaan buddha satya kii kasuti ko unke samaksh prastut karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he kalamo! shaq karnaa thik he
 Doubt is ok vastutah sandeh karne ke sthaan par hi sandeh utpann hua he
 ' he kalaamon! kisi tathy ko vefval isliye nahin maananaa chahie ki yah to parampara se prachlit he, athwa pracheen kaal se hi aisa kaha jaataa rahaa he, athwa yah dharmagranthon main kaha gaya he, athwa kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye is tathy kaa grahan samuchit he
 One should not accept any fact only because of size or gravity, but it should be accepted because it is a religion, is indescribable and if it is received, its fruit will be pleasant and beneficial
 2 How scientific, rational and hopeful are these things that have gone somewhere in Kesamuti Sutta
 uparyukt vishay ke kaaran hi vaigyanik chintan main mahati vraphanti kaa sutarapaat hua
 Later thinkers of the Buddha paid much attention to this subject
 yah sutt buddha-dhamm ke vaigyanik chintan kaa yah anupam adhar he
 It has been told that any thing, even if it is going on in the tradition, should not be accepted in the name of tradition without any discretion
 shatabdiyon se parampara ke naam par bahut saare vyarth ke aadambar tathaa buraaiyaan chali aayi hai, in buraaiyon ko bina kisi sawaal ke maan lenaa kadaapi budhimatta nahin
 Similarly, if a subject has been said since ancient times or it has been going on in the traditional form, then it is not appropriate to accept it without modification
 un vishyon ke achche-bure ke vishay main swatantratya vichaar kiya hi janaa chahie
 Adolf is famous about Hitler, he used to tell his followers that 'by repeating any falsehood, it also appears to be true
 ’ bahudhaa paramparaayen bhi yahi bhoomika adaa karti he
 No matter how bad the tradition or how low it is, but following it, it seems to be right
 pifer nirantar doharaaye jane par vahi uchit lagane lagata he
 Therefore, one should not blindly believe things that have been considered and heard for a long time
 koi baat yadi kisi pavitra dharm-granth main likhi ho tab bhi use bina vivek ke nahin maan lenaa chahie
 Regardless of any subject written in any scripture or book, prudent thinking is also necessary
 bahut saare aise anupayogi, amanviya tathaa ghrunit vishay bhi bahut saare dhrm-granthon, pavitra maani jane vaali kitabon tathaa puraanon main bhare pade hai
 Discussion and discussion should be done on all the topics mentioned in it from a scientific point of view and a scientific debate is also necessary
 kisi dharm-guru yaa aakarshak vyaktitv ke dhani vyakti ke vachan hone maatr se bhi un par vishwaas nahin kar lenaa chahie
 Over the centuries, many hypocritical religious leaders have practiced bad traditions and their own benefits
 apane swaarth kii purti ke liye ve anek prakaar ke hathkande chalaate hai
 Again, a fact or evidence may be appropriate for the resolution of a suit, but in other matters it may be counterproductive and inappropriate
 yah ukti prasiddh hi he ki ‘sikke ke do pahalu hote hai’, yadi ek paksh ujala yaa laabhadaayak he to doosraa paksh kalushit tathaa hanikaarak bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, in all circumstances, the eclipse of the fact used to resolve a suit is not always appropriate
 pifer deshkal, avasthaa tathaa paristhitiyon ke kaaran tathyon tathaa satya main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 It is visible that many times there is a distinction between truth and reality
 ’ baar baar dohraane yaa prachlan ke kaaran ham kisi baat ko usee rup main satya maan lete he, kintu vaastaviktaa main vah vaisaa hota hi nahin he
 Therefore, it is appropriate to take a decision only keeping the reality in view
 aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy ko nahin sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Many times it is seen that just being big is not enough, it should also have qualities
 atah maatr aakaar kii guruta ke kaaran kisi bhi cheez ko maan lenaa kori buddhi he
 Thus, in this preaching given to the Kalams, it has been taught that the fact or shape or gravity used to resolve the tradition or written or scripted in the scriptures or practiced since ancient times is not accepted by any fact or subject
 Should be taken
 is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ne in vishyon ko paristhitiyon ke anuroop amaanya ghoshit kiya - What are the criteria then that can be accepted? If it is a religion, it is indescribable and if it is accepted, its fruit will be pleasant and beneficial
 nishchay hi maanviya chintan, vaigyanik tathaa vivekwaad ke liye is sutt se behatar kasuti or ho hi kya sakati he? Then Lord Buddha told the Kalams about valid things
 unhone un sabhi vishyon ko atyant vrafambaddh tathaa vyavasthit dhang se kalaamon ke samaksh upasthaapit kiya jo maanya tathaa satya kahe ja sakate hai - Lord Buddha says that any subject can be accepted only when that subject is religious - that is, friendly and efficient in religion
 nishchay hi, yadi samaaj main kisi kaary yaa vishay ke kaaran sabhi kaa kalyaan hota he tathaa dukh se peedit janata ko raahat milti he athwa logon ke jivan main uâti tathaa vikaas kaa maarg khulata he va sabakaa hit hota he, to ye vishay vufashal hi kahe jaayenge
 Therefore, all welfare and human auspicious actions are called vuphshal dharma
 in vufashal karmon ko manyata dena chahie tathaa in vufashal karmon ko karte hue maanavtaa kii seva kerani chahie
 All those subjects which are indescribable and unpredictable, should be considered valid in the society
 yadi kisi vishay main koi dosha nahin he tathaa vah vishay puujarh he, tab aisi paristhiti main use manyata dena hi chahie
 All those subjects and beliefs should be validated, whose eclipse will lead to pleasing and beneficial results
 yadi kisi kaary ko karne se uske parinaam sukhakaari he or samast maanavtaa kaa jisase hit saadhti hota ho, to aise karmon ko karnaa nishchay hi samaaj ke liye laabhadaayak hota he
 It is beneficial to do such welfare subjects
 is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ne kalaamon ke samaksh adhelikhit vishyon kasautiyon ko maanya athwa satya ghoshit kiya
 They are as follows - is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ke ye vaigyanik vachan aadhunik kaal main utane hi praasangik tathaa grahniya he
 These modern science-tested criteria of Lord Buddha can prove to be a guide for modern science
 aadhunik bharat main pali tathaa buddha sahitya kii punah pratishtha karne kaa shrey mukhyatah bhikshutray arthath rahul sankrutyaayan, jagadish kaashyap tathaa bhadant anand kaushalyayan ko jaataa he
 At a time when Buddhism and Pali literature were omitted from India, they edited and translated the texts and published them
 inke jivan-chariton ko dhyanpurvak padhane par gyaat hota he ki ye teenon hi dharmadhurandhar angutar nikaay main vidyaman kesamutti-sutt se atyadhik prabhavit rahen
 This is a kind of manifesto for rationalism and free thinking in the entire matter of the matter, which is given to him while addressing the Kalams
 kalaamon ko diya gaya yah sutt vastav main maanavtaa ke liye ek daay he
 This Kesamuti Sutta greatly influenced these learned monks
 bhagwaan buddha or buddha-darshan ke prati aakarshan hone kii baat ko rahul sanvrifatyayan apni aatmakatha 3 main is tarah se prakat karte hai - In the society and times of two and a half thousand years, i began to taste the rational simple and piercing sentences of the Buddha with fullness
 tripitak main aaye mojizen or chamatkaar apni asambhavta ke liye meri ghrinaa ke paatr nahin, balki manoranjan kii saamagree the
 i used to think, that the impact of twenty five hundred years cannot be on those texts
 asambhav baton main kitni buddha ne vastutah kahin, iskaa nirnay aaj kiya nahin ja saktaa, pifer raakh main chhipe angaaron yaa pattharon se dhanvef ratna kii tarah bich-bich main aate buddha ke chamatkaarik vaakya mere man ko balaat apni ore khinch lete the
 When i heard the Buddha's sermons to the Kalams - 'do not take care of any book, tradition, elderly person, always be sure that you should be mounted on it', then the heart said - Here is a man whose firm belief in truth Is, who understands the importance of free intelligence of man
 jab mainen majjhim-nikaay main padhaa- ‘bede kii bhanti mainen tumhen dharm kaa upadesh kiya he, vah paar utarane ke liye he, sir par dhoye-dhoye phirane ke liye nahin, to maaloom hua, jis chiz ko main itane dinon se dhoondta phir rahaa tha, vah mil gai
 Rahulji should be very impressed with the human welfare related things assigned by Lord Buddha and due to the rendering of rational subjects
 vastutah bhagwaan buddha ke dwaara kahin gai shikshaaon main ek bhi maanav kalyaan tathaa tark ke pare nahin he
 In the Vefasamuti Sutta, the enlightening lines given to the Kalamas by the Buddha God descended into Rahulji's heart
 bhadant anand kaushalyayan bhi angutar nikaay kii prastaavna main isi prakaar kii baat ko sweekaar karke is sutt ke prati apni vrufatagyata nivedit karte hai
 He writes that he was attracted to buddhist-dhamma and literature only after reading kesamutti-sutta
 angutar nikaay kii prastaavna main ve is prakaar likhte hai - This new thing by Lord Buddha is somewhere in global history
 kisi bhi dharmaguru ne itnaa bada saahas nahin kiya
 All seem to be trying to establish their own godliness or save it
 kintu bhagwaan buddha kii baat hi niraali he
 They also present the teaching of not blindly following what they said - bhavarth - ‘he pandit! jis tarah ucch taap se pakakar koi suvarna parkhaa jaataa he, usee tarah mere bhi vachanon ko parakhkar grahan karnaa chahie, na ki mere prati gaurav ke kaaran
 ' uparyukt shloke ke madhyam se bhagwaan buddha apane prati shraddhabhaav ko pare rakhkar vigyaan kii kasuti par kasate hue vishay ko grahan karne kii prerana dete hai
 In this way, the contribution of this Anguswada body in returning Pali and Buddhism to India should be considered

 7 Indian states east india company ke sipaahi deshi updravi or east india company ke british sainik bengal presidency ke british naagarik swayamsevak21 riyaasaten Other small states of Nepal's royalty 1857 kaa bhartiya vidroh, jise pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram, sipaahi vidroh or bhartiya vidroh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he british shashan ke viruddh ek sashastr vidroh tha
 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years
 east india company ne robert clive ke netritv main san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh jeeta
 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke baad kamjor hue punjab par angrejon ne apana haath badhaaya or san 1848 main doosraa angrej-sikh yuddh hua
 In 1849, the company also took control of Punjab
 san 1853 main aakhri maratha peshwa baaji raav ke dattak putr naanaa sahib kii padavi chin lee gayi or unka vaarshik kharchaa band kar diya gaya
 Berar in 1854 and Awadh were merged with the Company in 1856
 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized
 ye log angrejon ke haathon apni sharmindagi or haar kaa badla lene ke liye taiyaar the
 In the eight years of Lord Dalhousie's rule, the area of one million square miles was taken over by the company
 iske atirikt east india company kii bengal sena main bahut se sipaahi avadh se bhartee hote the, ve avadh main hone vaali ghatnaon se achoote nahin rah sake
 The event, which was spoken in Calcutta by the royal family of Nagpur, was seen as a disrespect to the royal family
 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice
 in kanoonon ne samaaj ke kuch pakshon mukhyatah bengal main krodh utpann kar diya
 The British abolished child marriage and also prohibited female feticide
 angrejon dwaara thagi kii samaapti bhi kii gai parantu yah sandeh abhi bhi bana hua he ki thag ek dharmik samudaay tha yaa keval saadhaaran dakaiton kaa samudaay
 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company
 san 1849 main lard dalhoji kii ghoshnaa ke anusaar bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari ko aitihaasik laal kila chhodana padega or shahar ke baahar janaa hoga or san 1856 main lard cannig kii ghoshnaa ki bahadur shah ke uttaradhikari raja nahin kahalaayenge ne mughalon ko company ke vidroh main khada kar diya
 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army
 bombay, madras or bengal presidensi kii apni alag sena or senapramukh hota tha
 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the
 The army of Bombay and Madras Presidency, being a people of different regions, these forces were full of diversity and did not have the dominion of the people of any one region
 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time
 sipaahi dhire-dhire sena ke jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon se asantusht ho chuke the
 The salary of the army was low
 bhartiya sainikon kaa vetan mahaj saat rupaye pratimah tha
 And after winning Awadh and Punjab the sepoys' allowance was also abolished
 enfield bandook ke bare main faili afvaahon ne sipaahiyon kii ashnka ko or badhaa diya ki company unki dharm or jati parivartan karnaa chaahati he
 The revolt began due to a gun
 sipaahiyon ko pattesion 1853 enfield bandook di gayin jo ki 0
577 calibar kii bandook thi tathaa puraani or kai dashakon se upyog main laayi ja rahi brown bas ke mukaable main shaktishaalee or achook thi
 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun
 ack or afawaah jo ki us samay faili hui thi, company kaa rajya san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh se prarambh hua tha or san 1857 main 100 varshon baad samaapt ho jaayegaa
 Chapatis and lotus flowers were distributed in many parts of India
 ye aane vaale vidroh ke lakshna the
 Many months before the rebellion began, there was an atmosphere of tension and many rebellious incidents took place

 The fame of Kumaril had spread well in the last period of Harsha
 kumaril ne shabar bhashya par teen prasiddh vrittigranth likhe
 The philosophy of Kumaril can be studied in three main parts - Gyanamimamsa, Tatvamimamsa and Acharamimamsa
 gyaan ke swaroop tathaa uske sadhano kaa kumaril ne vistaar se vivechan kiya he 
 The first question about knowledge is what is the nature of true knowledge or prama - that is, what is seen, smelled, tasted, how does the mind know
 mimasaa ke anusaar, pehle se agyaat tathaa satya vastu ke gyaan ko prama kehete hai
 This knowledge is not obstructed or dismantled by any other knowledge and this knowledge arises for innocent reasons
 jis saadhan dwaara prama athwa yatharth gyaan kii prapti hoti he use pramaan kehete hai
 There are six types of evidence from the opinion of Kumaril - direct, inference, inference, word, economy and unavailability
 advait vedant bhi upyukt chah pramaanon ko sweekaar karata he
 Epistemology considers knowledge to be self-evident
 kumaril ke anusaar gyaan kii pramanikta athwa satyata kii pratiti uske utpann hone ke saath hoti he
 At the time when there is knowledge of an object, at the same time its truth is also known
 uski satyata siddh karne ke liye kisi anya pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 But the realization of knowledge's untruth or inauthenticity occurs when it later appears to conflict with the true nature of the object or becomes aware of the faults of the reason causing it
 at: mimasaa gyaan ke vishay main swat:pramanyawad ko maanati he
 According to epistemology, knowledge is the automatic and unproven layer of knowledge
 kumaril or prabhakar donon hi is mat kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 They accept the existence of external objects
 sansar ko ve advait vedant athwa mahayan buddha darshan kii tarah mithyaa nahin maanate
 The world is true
 sansar kaa tathaa padaarthon kaa man se swatantra astitv he
 By their opinion, there are five types of matter: matter, quality, action, general and absence
 inako ve do bhaagon main vibhajit karte hai : bhav or abhaav
 The first four expressions are called substances
 abhaav ko vaisheshikon kii tarah unhone chaar prakaar kaa mana he : pragabhav, pradhvansabhaav, atyantabhaav tathaa anyonyabhaav
 a substance is one in which the qualities reside
 kumaril ke anusaar yah gyaarah prakaar kaa he : prithvi, jal, vaayu, akaash, aatma, man, maal, dik, andhkaar or shabd
 Of these, the first nine matter are derived from Vaiseshika philosophy
 kumaril ne andhkaar tathaa shabd ko bhi dravya kii hi manyata di he
 In the matter of virtues too, there seems to be a substantial influence of Vaishashika on Kumaril
 prashastpad kii tarah ve bhi 24 gun maanate hai
 These are form, rasa, smell, touch, number, magnitude, separability, coincidence, divination, divinity, immaturity, gravity, fluidity, affection, knowledge, desire, malice, effort, pleasure, sorrow, samskara, sound, nature and power
 gunon kii is suchi main unhone prashastvaad ke shabd ke sthaan par dhwani tathaa dharm or adharm ke sthaan par prakatya or shakti rakhaa he
 Like Vaisheshika, they consider five types: interpolation, deflection, flexion, transmission and movement
 prabhakar ke anusaar karm anumaan kaa vishay he kintu kumaril kaa mat he ki iskaa pratyaksh hota he
 Both Prabhakar and Kumaril believe the general to be true
 unke anusaar iskaa indriyon se saakshaat grahan hota he
 They have complete opposition from the Buddhists in this matter because they do not accept the authority of the general
 kumaril sansar kii utpatti tathaa pralay nahin maanate
 Things continue to be generated and destroyed in the world
 jeevon ke janm maran kaa pravaad chalata rahata he kintu samgr sansar kii na to utpatti hi hoti he, na vinaash
 Like justice, Kumaril does not consider God to be the cause of the world
 anek tarkon dwaara unhone yah siddh karne kaa praytn kiya he ki ishwar ko jagat kaa kaaran maananaa yuktisangat nahin he
 According to Kumaril, the soul is a continual substance
 vah vibhu athwa vyapak he
 He is both the doer and the karma-fruit-bhakta
 aatma sharir, indriya, man tathaa buddhi se bhinn he
 She is not just a child of science
 kumaril ne baudhon ke anaatmavaad tathaa vigyansantan ke siddhant kaa anek prabal tarkon dwaara khandan kiya he
 According to him, the realization of the existence of the eternal soul and the actions of remembrance etc
 cannot be explained
 aatma parinami tathaa nity he
 The soul is partially rooted and partly conscious
 chidansh se aatma vastuon kaa gyaan praapt karata he : achidansh se vah gyaan, sukh, dukh, ichha, praytn aadi ke rup main oupaadhik gun he jo vishesh paristhiti, jaise indriya kaa vishay se sanyog, hone par utpann hota he
 In the state of sleep and salvation, there is no consciousness in the soul
 kumaril ke mat se aatma gyaata tathaa gyaan kaa vishay, donon hi he
 The sentences of the Vedas that i am soul or Brahman, know the soul, confirm this belief
 mimasaa darshan kaa pradhan uddeshy dharm kaa nirupan karnaa he
 According to Jaimini, the symptom of religion is consciousness i
e
 the act of enunciation of action or method of Veda
 mimasakon ke anusaar veda kaa mukhya taatpary kriyaparak athwa vidhivaakyon kaa pratipaadan karnaa he
 There are three types of karma as propounded in the Veda: Kamya, prohibited and regular Naimittik
 kumaril ke anusaar: * Kamya karmas - are done for the attainment of any desire, like a person who desires heaven will perform a yajna
 *pratishiddh karm - jinka vedon main nishedh mana gaya he
 * Continual Karma - which is considered necessary daily, such as Sandhyavandan etc
 naimitthik karm vishesh avasaron par kiye jate he, jaise shraadh
 a man definitely gets the fruits of his good and bad deeds
 vartmaan main kiye hue yagyadi karmon kaa fal bhavishya athwa janmaantar main kaise praapt hota he? ise samajhane ke mimasak apurv kii kalpana karte he
 According to Kumaril, Apoorva is an invisible force that arises from performing a task
 apurv ke hi kaaran aatma ko apane karmon ke anuroop fal kii prapti hoti he
 This is the invisible link between karma and fruit
 kumaril ke anusaar vedant kaa adhyayan evam chintan mokshaprapti main sahaayak hota he
 The state of salvation ends forever with the soul's body, sense, intelligence and connection to these things of the world
 aatma dukh se purna rup se mukt ho jaataa he
 In that state there is no feeling of happiness either
 yah purna swatantraaa tathaa shanti kii avasthaa he
 In order to attain salvation, one should sacrifice kamya and prohibited deeds
 kintu nity naimitthik karmo kaa sampadan nity karte rahanaa aavashyak he
 The ritual of veditha karmas is the seeker of salvation

 The word malaria originates from the medieval Italian language Mala Area which means 'bad wind'
 ise 'daldali bukhaar' yaa 'egg' bhi kaha jaataa tha kyonki yah daldali kshetron main vyapak rup se failata tha
 The first serious scientific study on malaria occurred in 1880 when Charles Louis Alphonse Lavern, a French military physician, first noticed the parasite inside a red blood cell while working in Algeria
 tab usne yah prastaavit kiya ki malaria rog kaa kaaran yah protozoa paraseete he
 For this and other discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Medical Nobel Prize

 malaria ke lakshanon main shaamil hai- fever, kanpakanpi, jodon main dard, ulti, raktaalpata, mutr main haemoglobin or daure
 The most common symptom of malaria is a sudden cold, accompanied by a cold, followed by a fever
 4 se 6 ghante ke baad fever utarataa he or pasinaa aata he
 In P
 falciparum infection this entire process occurs every 36 to 48 hours or may be persistent fever; Malaria resulting from P
 vivax and P
 ovale causes fever every two days, and P
 malaria every three days
 malaria ke gambhir maamle lagbhag hameshaa pi

 In very severe cases, death can occur within a few hours
 gambhir maamalon main uchit ilaaj hone par bhi mrityu dar 20% tak ho sakati he
 Treatment is often not satisfactory in the epidemic area, so the death rate is very high and 1 out of every 10 malaria patients die
 malaria yuva bacchon ke vikasshil mastishk ko gambhir kshati pahunchaa saktaa he
 Children are more likely to develop brain malaria, and in this case the blood supply to the brain may decrease and often directly harm the brain as well

 Therefore, it is wrong to assume that the disease has been completely eradicated even after the disease has been eradicated from the blood
 pi

 One out of every five cases of P
 vivax in temperate regions suddenly arises next year by hiding in cold weather
 malaria plasmodium gana ke protozoa parjiviyon se failata he
 Four members of this group infect humans - Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae
 inamen se sarvaadhik khatarnaak pi
 failciparum mana jaataa he, yah malaria ke 80 pratishat maamalon or 90 pratishat mrityuon ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 This parasite also infects birds, crawling creatures, monkeys, chimpanzees and mice

 The primary nutrient of the malaria parasite is the female anopheles mosquito, which also helps to spread malaria infection
 anopheleas gana ke machhar saare sansar main faile hue hai
 Only the female mosquito nourishes by blood, so it is the carrier and not the male
 maadaa machhar anopheleas raat ko hi katati he
 In the evening, it goes out in search of prey and roams till the hunt is found

 Both the eggs and the larvae emanating from them are in dire need of water

 vayask machhar paraag or sharkara vaale anya bhojya-padaarthon par palate hai, lekin maadaa machhar ko andey dene ke liye rakt kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The female Anopheles mosquito becomes the first prey and carrier of the malaria parasite
 yuva machhar sankramit maanav ko kaatane par uske rakt se malaria paraseete ko grahan kar lete hai
 The germs of the parasite present in the blood develop into males and females in the stomach of the mosquito and then together form an ovum that grows in the wall of the mosquito's intestines
 paripakv hone par ye footte hai or isamen se nikalne vaale bijaanu us machhar kii laar-grathiyon main pahunch jate hai
 When a mosquito bites a healthy human, it sends saliva as well as spores to the skin
 maanav sharir main ye bijaanu phir palakar jananaanu banaate hai, jo phir aage sankraman failaate hai
 In addition, malaria can also be spread by transfusion of infected blood, but this is very unusual
 malaria paraseete kaa maanav main vikaas do charnon main hota he: yakrut main pratham charan or laal rakt koshikaon main doosraa charan
 When an infected mosquito bites a human, the spores enter the human blood and reach the liver and infect the liver cells within 30 minutes of entering the body
 phir ye yakrut main alangik janan karne lagate hai
 This phase lasts for 6 to 15 days
 is janan se hajaaron anshaanu banate hai jo apni mehmaan koshikaon ko tod kar rakt main pravesh kar jaate hai tathaa laal rakt koshikaon ko sankramit karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 This starts the second phase of the disease

 ovel ke kuch bijaanu yakrut ko hi sankramit karke ruk jate hai or suptanu ke rup main niskriy ho jate hai
 These remain dormant for 6 to 12 months and then suddenly appear as bacteria and cause disease

 Many such phases go on
 malaria main bukhaar ke daure aane kaa kaaran hota he hajaaron anshaanuon kaa ekasaath nai laal rakt koshikaon ko prabhavit karnaa
 The malaria parasite spends almost all of its life hiding in liver cells or red blood cells, thus protecting the immune system of the human body
 tilli main nasht hone se bachane ke liye pi
 failciparum ek anya chaal chalata he- yah laal rakt koshika kii sataha par ek chipkau protein pradarshit kara detaa he jisase sankramit rakt koshikaaye ko choti rakt vahikaaon main chipak jaati hai or tilli tak pahunch nahin paati hai
 For this reason only the ring forms are seen in the bloodstream, in all other developmental stages it sticks to the surfaces of small blood vessels
 is chipchipahat ke chalate hi malaria raktastrav kii samasya karata he
 Although the protein pfemp1 displayed on the surface of an infected red blood cell can become a victim of the body's immune system, it does not occur because this protein has a very high diversity
 har paraseete ke paas iske 60 prakaar hote he vahiin sabhi ke paas mila kar asankhya roopon main ye is protein ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 They are one step ahead of the body's immune system by repeatedly changing this protein
 kuch anshaanu nar-maadaa jananaanuon main badal jate hai or jab machhar katata he to rakt ke saath unhen bhi le jaataa he
 Here they complete their life cycle again
 anek malaria-grast kshetron main bukhaar ke har marij ko malaria kaa anumanik nidaan de diya jaataa he or kunain se ilaaj shuru kar diya jaataa he
 Along with this, blood plaques are also made, but the results are not awaited to start treatment
 aisa kai aise kshetron main bhi kiya jaataa he jahaan saamaanya prayogshaala pareekshanon kii suvidhaae uplabdh nahin hon
 But a study in Malawi suggests that unnecessary treatment of malaria can be avoided if the temperature of the anus, anemia, and spleen size are taken into consideration along with fever
 )
 Testing blood vessels under a microscope is considered the cheapest, best and reliable method of diagnosing malaria
 is pareekshan se chaaron malaria parjiviyon ke vishisht lakshanon ke dwaara alag-alag nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Blood plaques are made in two ways - thin and thick
 patali patticoon main paraseete kii banaavat ko behatar dhang se surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he, vahiin duusari ore moti patticoon se kam samay main rakt kii adhik maatra kii jaanch kii ja sakati he or isse kam maatra ke sankraman kaa bhi nidaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Experienced testers can detect up to 0
 xxrep 6 0 1 percent infection in the blood
 in kaarnon se moti or patali donon pattiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Also, it is necessary to examine more than one ring phase, because the ring phases of the four parasites often look the same
 
 Several antigen-based dipstick tests or malaria rapid antigen tests are also available to diagnose malaria
 inhen rakt kii keval ek boond kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, or sirf 15-20 minute main hi parinaam saamne aa jaataa he, prayogshaala kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 These are considered to be slightly inferior to microscopic examination
 lekin jin kshetron main sookshmdarshi jaanch kii suvidha uplabdh nahin hoti yaa pareekshakon ko malaria ke nidaan kaa anubhav nahin hota vahaan prabhavit kshetra main ja kar rakt kii ek boond se antigen pareekshan kar liya jaataa he
 These tests were first developed using the fermented glutamate dehydrogenase of P
 falciparum as an antigen
 lekin jaldi hi ek anya kinvak lactate dihadrosenez kaa prayog karke optimal-iti naamak pareekshan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 These enzymes are not present in the blood for a long time and when the parasite is eliminated, they also get out of the blood, so these tests are also used to know the success or failure of treatment
 optimal-iti failciparum or gaiyr-failciparum malaria main antar bhi kar saktaa he
 It can diagnose P
 falciparum by 0
01 percent and non-falciparum malaria parasites in the blood by 0

 In addition to this, some tests have also been developed using polymerase chain reactions and using molecular methods, but they are still quite expensive, and are available only in specialized laboratories
 saste, samvedi tathaa saral pareekshanon ke vikaas kii ab bhi aavashyaktaa he, jinka prayog kshetra main, malaria ke nidaan ke liye kiya ja sake
 It is often a mistake to identify severe malaria in Africa, due to which other mortal diseases are not treated

 With proper treatment, the patient gets well
 kuch lakshanon kaa upachaar saamaanya dawaaon se kiya jaataa he, saath main malaria-rodhi davaayen bhi di jaati he
 These drugs are of two types - first those which are resistant and protect against disease when taken before the disease occurs and the second which are used after getting infected by the disease
 anek davaayen keval pratirodh yaa keval upachaar ke liye istemaal hoti hai, jabaki anya kai donon tarah se prayog main laai ja sakati hai
 Some drugs increase each other's effects and are used together
 pratirohak dawaaon kaa prayog aksar samuhik rup se hi kiya jaataa he
 Many medicines based on quinine are considered good treatment for malaria
 iske atirikt artimicinin jaisi aushadhiyaan, jo artimisia ennua naamak paudhe se taiyaar kii jaati he, malaria ke ilaaj main prabhavi pai gai hai
 Use of some other drugs has also been successful against malaria
 kuch aushadhiyon par prayog jari he
 The most prominent factor in the choice of medicine is that malaria parasites have developed resistance to which drugs in that area
 anek davaayen jinka prayog pehle malaria ke viruddh safal samajha jaataa tha aajkal safal nahin samajha jaataa kyon ki malaria ke paraseete dhire dhire unke prati pratirohak kshamta praapt kar chuke hai
 Malaria treatment is available in homeopathy, although many physicians believe that serious diseases like malaria should be treated with allopathic medicines, as they are based on scientific research
 yahan tak ki british homeopathic association kii salaah yahi he ki malaria ke upachaar ke liye homeopathy par nirbhar nahin karnaa chahie
 In Ayurveda, malaria is called anomalous fever and many medicines are available for its treatment

 In view of the increasing demand for malaria medicines, fake medicines are traded on a large scale in many affected countries, which causes many deaths
 aajkal companiyaan nai takneekon kaa prayog karke is samasya se nipatane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 The spread of malaria depends on these factors - the density of the human population, the density of the mosquito population, the spread from mosquitoes to humans and the spread from humans to mosquitoes
 in karkon main se kisi ek ko bhi bahut kam kar diya jaae to us kshetra se malaria ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, to prevent the spread of disease in malaria affected areas, along with medicines, measures are taken to eradicate mosquitoes or to avoid biting them
 anek anusandhan karta daawa karte hai ki malaria ke upachaar kii tulana me us se bachaav kaa vyay deergh kaal me kam rahegaa
 Extensive efforts were made to eradicate malaria globally in the decade 1956–1960
 kintu uname safalataa nahin mil saki or malaria aaj bhi africa me usee str par maujuud he
 Much control over malaria can be achieved by destroying mosquito breeding sites
 khadey pani main machhar apana prajnan karte hai, aise khadey pani kii jagahon ko dhak kar rakhana, sukha dena yaa baha dena chaiye yaa pani kii sataha par tel daal dena chaiye, jisase machharon ke larva saans na le paaen
 In addition, pesticides are often sprayed on the walls of homes in malaria-affected areas
 anek prajatiyon ke machhar manushya kaa khun chusane ke baad diwaar par baith kar ise hajam karte hai
 In such a situation, if insecticides are sprayed on the walls, the mosquito will die as soon as it sits on the wall, before any other humans are bitten
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne malaria prabhavit kshetron main chhidkav ke liye lagbhag 12 dawaaon ko manyata di he
 These include drugs such as permethrin and deltamethrin in addition to DDT, especially in areas where mosquitoes have developed anti-ddt resistance
 machhardaniyaan machharon ko logon se dur rakhane me safal rahati hai tathaa malaria sankraman ko kaaphi had tak rokatii hai
 Since the Anopheles mosquito bites at night, the protection is completed by hanging large mosquito nets on the bed / bed and completely encircling the bed
 machhardaniyaan apane aap main bahut prabhavi upaay nahin hai kintu yadi unhen rasinic rup se upachaarit kar den to ve bahut upyogi ho jaati hai
 Malaria-affected areas have seen a 20 percent reduction in malaria by spreading awareness about malaria
 saath hi malaria kaa nidaan or ilaaj jald se jald karne se bhi iske prasar main kami hoti he
 Other efforts include collecting and analyzing malaria on a large scale and examining how effective the methods of malaria control are
 aise ek vishleshan main pataa laga ki lakshan-viheen sankraman vaale logon kaa ilaaj karnaa bahut aavashyak hota he, kyonki inamen bahut maatra main malaria sanchit rahata he
 Vaccines are being developed against malaria, although success has not yet been achieved
