 Eric Williams
 lekin donon hi ne sangheey chunaav nahin ladaa or apane sambandhit dweep ke niyantran ko banaae rakhane ko pasand kiya
 This meant that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Union as viable
 isi tarah, dlapi ke jamcon sansthaapak alexander bastamante ne bhi sangh ke chunaav ke liye manaa kar diya or trinidadian eshford sinanan ke liye party netritv chhod diya

 However, the immediate catalyst for the dissolution of the League was Jamaican dissent

 jamaica, sangh main isiilie shaamil hua tha kyonki uske netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki west indies ko jaldi hi swatantraaa de di jaaegi

 Antigua's Prime Minister Ware Bird replied that his province in the Union is an equal share of Trinidad, not like "a little Tobago"

 However, these talks ultimately proved fruitless

 Several other monuments have been built on the way to the main western entrance to Humayun's tomb
 inamen se pramukh smarak isa khan niyazi kaa makbara he, jo mukhya makbare se bhi 20 varsh purv 1547 main bana tha
 Isa Khan Niyazi was an Afghan Nawab of the court of Sher Shah Suri, ruler of the Sur dynasty, fighting against the Mughals
 yah makbara isa khan ke jeevankaal main hi bana tha or uske baad uske puure parivaar ke liye hi kaam aayaa
 To the west of the mausoleum is a three courtyard wide red sandstone mosque
 yah athmukha makbara sur vansh ke lodhi makbare parisar sthit anya makbaron se bahut mail khaataa he
 Other monuments located outside the main boundary in this complex are prominent: the tomb of Bu Halima and its gardens
 ye makbara ab dhwans ho chukaa he or avasheshon se gyaat hota he ki ye kendra main sthit nahin tha
 This suggests that it may have been added later
 iske baad aati he arab sarai jise hamida begum ne mukhya makbare ke nirmaan main lage kaarigaron ke liye banwaaya tha
 The officer's tomb is also built in this complex, which was built for a Nawab of Akbar
 iske saath hi isaki masjid bhi bani he
 Outside the entire complex is a mausoleum called Neela Burj
 iskaa ye naam iske gumbad ke upar lagi neeli glemud tilon ke kaaran padaa he
 The tomb was built by Abdul Rahim Khane Khankhana, son of Bairam Khan, the courtier of Akbar for his servant Mian Faheem
 fahim miyaan inke bete firos khan ke sang hi paley bade the or uske saath hi 1625 / 26 main jahangir ke samay main hue ek mughal senapati mahabat khan ke vidroh main ladate hue kaam aaye the
 This tomb is unique in its architecture
 ye baahar se ashtakoniya he jabaki andar se vargakar he
 Its roof is particularly notable because of its different domed dome from the prevailing double dome of its time, and very beautiful painting and mosaic on the plaster inside

 At the time of Partition of India, in August 1947, the old fort and Humayun's Tomb were converted into refugee camps for refugees from India to newly established Pakistan
 baad main inhen bharat sarkaar dwaara apane niyantran main le liya gaya
 These camps lasted for about five years and caused great damage to the monuments, especially their gardens, beautiful water drains etc

 Friction: yadi kisi sthir thos vastu par koi duusari thos vastu is tarah se rakhi jaati he kii donon samtal prishto ek-dusre ko spost karte he, to is dasha main duusari vastu ko pehali vastu par khisakane ke liye bal lagaana padataa he l is bal kaa man ek seemaa se kam hone par duusari vastu pehali vastu par nahin khisak sakati he l is kathan se yah spasht he kii donon vastue ke sampark taal ek bal gati ke vipareet disha main utpan ho jaataa he jo duusari vastu kii gati main virodh karata he l is virdohi bal ko ‘gharshan’ kehete he l Friction is a force that opposes the relative tangential motion between two planes
 gharshan bal kaa maan donon talon ke bich abhilamb bal par nirbhar karata he
 There are two types of friction: static and kinetic
 sthitik gharshan do pindon ke sampark-prishth kii samaantar disha main lagata he, lekin gatij gharshan gati kii disha par nirbhar nahi karata
 Generally, no surface is completely smooth, but it has very small elevations and pits
 inako achche sookshmdarshi dwaara hi dekha ja saktaa he
 Therefore, when two such surfaces touch each other, the lifts of one surface get trapped in the pits of the other surface
 is avasthaa main ek sataha ko duusari sataha par khiskaane ke liye bal lagane par sataha kii banaavat main vikrut utpann ho jaati he
 Accordingly, stress works in the direction against the force used due to the elasticity of materials, which is called friction
 hamaare dainik jivan main gharshan kaa bahut mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The speed of each vehicle moving on the surface of the earth is possible only by the friction between the surface and the base of the vehicle
 at: gharshan gati baadhak tathaa sadhak donon hi he
 Friction also has a prominent place in the behavior of torrents and lubricants
 Sand adopts a cone shape with the inclination angle of the internal friction
kisi thos padarthpind ko thos sataha par visthapit karne ke liye sparsh sataha ke samaantar bal prayukt karnaa hota he
 If the force applied is less than a certain magnitude, the substance does not displace and if it is exceeded, it displaces at a fixed velocity
 aisa sparsh karanevaali satahon ke bich gharshan ke kaaran hota he, jisase taatpary yah he ki thos padarthpind par sparsh sataha ke samaantar prayukt bal kii viruddh disha main ek bal kaary karata he, jise gharshan bal kehete hai
 Friction force causes roughness of surfaces
 visthaapan se purv gharshanbal prayukt bal ke baraabar hota he, jise sthitik gharshan kehete he
 The force used for displacement must be at least of such magnitude that the deformation is greater than the peak elasticity
 visthaapan ke liye aavashyak is nunatam bal ke pariman ko charam gharshanbal kehete hai
 The peak pressure between the two forces of friction and both surfaces has the following relation: jabaki sthitik dharshansthiraank kehalaata he
 Its value can be determined by placing the substance on the surface and placing it on the surface by knowing the minimum inclination angle of the surface at which the substance starts slipping
 is kone ko gharshankon kehete hai
 The tangent of the friction angle is equal in magnitude to the static friction constant, ie gati ke samay bhi padarthpind par gharshanbal kaary karata he
 Its magnitude mainly depends on the type of displacement
 ek thos padarthpind ko thos sataha par khiskaakar yaa ludhakaakar hi visthapit kar sakate hai; at: inhen do visthaapan prakaaron ke anusaar nimnaankit do prakaar ke gatiya gharshan hote hai
 1 - erosive friction 2 - lunthan gharshan both types of motion is expressed by the following formula: Fb = bc x p While friction is the pressure on the surface and the kinetic friction constant, the value of which depends on both surfaces
 satahon kii laghu saapeksh gati ke liye cag kaa maan gati ke pariman par nirbhar nahin karata
 But when the magnitude of the speed exceeds the critical velocity, the value of the kag increases with the increase in velocity
 cag kaa maan lunthan tathaa sarpan gatiyon ke liye bhinn bhinn hota he
 Below is the approximate value of friction-multipliers for some substances

 Raju is a gullible spear orphan who fills his stomach by singing songs
 ek din use zakhmi haalat main ek daakuon ke giroh kaa sardaar miltaa he jisaki jaan raju bachaa letaa he
 That gang of bandits then arrives and Raka Raju, the right-hand man of the Sardar, considers him a policeman and along with the Sardar, orders him to take him along with him to his base
 hosh aane par sardaar raaka ko bataata he ki raju ne hi uski jaan bachaai thi
 Raju falls in love with Sardar's girl Kammo but Rama is also eyeing Kammo
 kammo raju ko samajhaati he ki darasal wo log achche hai kyonki amir log garibon ko lootakar apni tijoriyaan bharte hai or wo log amiron ko lut kar garibon main paisa waapas kar dete hai
 Bhole Raju likes this and he stays with the gang
 ek din vah giroh kisi gaanv ke sahuukaar kii ladki kii shaadi main dhaava bol detaa he or lut paat ke saath saath raaka nav vivaahit dampati ko bhi maar detaa he
 This thing has a deep impact on Raju and he goes to the police superintendent and tells that the robber is now going to rob the Rajgarh village
 jab police suparintendent usase kahata he ki vah raaka or uske saare saathiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar degaa to bholaa raju samajhataa he ki police bhi utani hi zaalim he jitne ye daaku
 He escapes and intercepts the gang of dacoits going to Rajgarh and informs them about the police arrangements

 But he falls prey to police bullets
 raaka or uske saathi raju ko saath lekar apane adde waapas aa jate hai jahaan sardaar ke saamne raju kii peshi hoti he
 Raju confesses in front of everyone that he had informed the police about the robber's plan to rob the Rajgarh and asks Raka why he did not send himself to anyone else to take stock
 raaka use martha he to vah daakuon ke adde ko chhodane kaa faisalaa kar letaa he lekin kammo ke aagrah par nahin jaataa he
 Raka and Sardar also arrive there and Kammo tells them that she has accepted Raju as her husband by eating the scent of power
 raaka agbabula ho jaataa he or sardaar se raju ko goli maarane ko kahata he
 When the Sardar turns his back on this, he shoots the Sardar himself and tries to forcefully marry Kammo and make up his mind to offer Raju's sacrifice on the wedding day
 kammo raaka se batch kar bhauji, jo ki ek robdar daaku kii patni he, ke paas jaati he jo use or raju ko bhaag nikalne main madad karti he
 The two flee to the police superintendent and the police superintendent kamo imprisons them to clean up the bandits
 raju waapas daakuon ke adde par aakar daakuon ke bivi bacchon se aagrah karata he ki ve daakuon se hathiyaar daalane kii zid karen
 The robber agrees to lay down arms for his wife's children
 akelaa pad gaya raaka bhi unke saath police ke paas jane ko nikal padataa he
 The robber leaves his base and goes towards the police and on the other hand Kammo comes under the pressure of the police to take the police towards the whereabouts of the bandits
 ek jagah donon dalon kaa takaraav hota he or raaka ke uksaane par daaku phir se hathiyaar uthaakar police se loha lene kaa man bana lete hai
 That is when Raju stands between the two parties with the bandits' wives and asks the bandits to lay down their arms again
 raaka samet is baar sabhi daaku apane hathiyaar daalkar apane or apane parivaar ko police ke supurd kar dete hai
 Raju requests the police superintendent that he should not be hanged
 police suparintendent sabko aashwaasan detaa he ki daakuon ko apane kiye kii sazaa to zarur milegi magar maut kii sazaa nahin
