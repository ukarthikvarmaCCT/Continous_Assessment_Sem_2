 Arrived in front of Abdunnavi
 mughalon par dutarafa maar padi
 faujadaar goli prahaar se maaraa gaya
 The remaining Mughals fled
 gokulasinh aage bade or sadabad kii chhavnee ko lootakar aag laga di
 Its smoke and flames rose so high that it was quickly visible in the palaces of Agra and Delhi
 dikhaai bhi kyon nahin deteen
 samrajya ke vajeer sadulla khan kii chhavnee kaa namonishaan mit gaya tha
 Not only Mathura, but also from the Agra district, the flag of the royal flag was flown and piled up in Agra city and fort
 niraash or mritpraaya hinduon main jivan kaa sanchaar hua
 They saw that the toxins of the Mughal power could be broken
 unhen dikhaai diya apni bhavi aashaaon kaa rakhwala-ek punarsthaapak gokulasinh
 After this fierce wars continued for five months
 mughalon kii sabhi taiyaariyaan or chune hue senapati prabhaavaheen or asafal siddh hue
 kya sainik or kya senapati sabhi ke upar gokulasinh kaa veerta or yuddh sanchaalan kaa aatank baith gaya
 Finally in September month, completely disappointed, Shaf Shikan Khan sent a treaty proposal to Gokulsingh that- 1
 badshaah unako kshamaadaan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 2
 They return all the looted salmon
 3
 vachan den ki bhavishya main vidroh nahin karenge
 Gokulsingh asked what is my crime, which i will apologize to the emperor? Your king should apologize to me, because he has insulted my religion very much, causing great harm
 duusare uske kshamaa daan or minnat kaa bharosa is sansar main koun karata he? It was futile to proceed with the treaty
 gokulasinh ne koi gunjaais hi nahin chodi thi
 Aurangzeb's idea was that Gokulsingh would also be wooed by giving him the title of 'raja' or 'thakur' and another Mughal pet would be increased
 His deliberate plan to make India 'darul Islam' will continue to move forward smoothly
 But in front of Gokulsingh, his code policy was badly defeated
 at: aurangzeb swayan ek badi sena, topon or toptiyon ke saath, apane is abhootpurv pratidwandi se nipatane chal padaa
 paramparaayen or maryaada tuutane kaa yah ek aisa jwalanth or prerak udhaaharan he, jidhar itihaaskaaron kaa dhyaan nahin gaya he
 According to the account of the European traveler Manuchi, Akbar had to go first and now Aurangzeb, whose empire was not only in the Mughals but was the largest of all hindu-muslim rulers till that time
 yah thi veeravar gokulasinh kii mahanata
 dilli se chalakar aurangzeb 28 navambar 1669 ko mathura ja pahunchaa
 Many of Gokulsinh's soldiers and generals who were not salaried, were people inspired by the revolution, moved to Agra district in the neighborhood in connection with Rabi sowing
 aurangzeb ne apni chhavnee mathura main banaai or vahaan se sampoorn yuddh sanchaalan karne laga
 Gokulsingh was being surrounded
 usne ek or senapati hasan ali khan ko ek majboot or susajjit sena ke saath mursaan kii ore se bheja
 hasan ali khan ne 4 disambar 1669 kii praat: kaal ke samay achaanak chapa markar, jaaton kii teen gadhiyaan - revada, chandrarakh or sarakhru ko gherliya
 In front of the shoots of royal cannons and guns, these small strongholds could not prove to be very useful and broke down very quickly
 hasan ali khan kii safaltaaon se khush hokar aurangzeb ne shaf shikan khan ke sthaan par use mathura kaa faujadaar bana diya
 Amanullah Khan from Agra Pargana, Faujdar Namdar Khan of Moradabad, Faujdar Hoshayar Khan of Agra city arrived with their respective forces to help him
 This huge army surrounded Gokulsinh and started moving forward
 gokulasinh ke viruddh kiya gaya yah abhiyaan, un akramanon se vishaal str kaa tha, jo bade-bade rajyon or vahaan ke raajaaon ke viruddh hote aae the
 This valor had neither big fortifications, nor the Aravalli hills nor a diverse geographical region like Maharashtra
 Despite these disastrous conditions, the patience and tact with which they faced the central power of a powerful empire, achieved equal results, is unprecedented
 disambar 1669 ke antim saptaah main tilapat se 20 mile dur, gokulasinh ne shahi senaaon kaa saamana kiya
 The Jats attacked the Mughal army with a firm determination and fierce anger
 subah se shaam tak yuddh hota rahaa
 No decision could be made
 duusare din fir ghamaasan chhid gaya
 The Jats were at war with supernatural valor
 mogul sena, topakhane or jirahabakhtar se susajjit ghudsavaar senaaon ke hote huue bhi gokulasinh par vijay praapt na kar sake
 There have been fewer wars in the history of India where many of the obstructed and weaker sides have fought with such calm determination and steadfast patience
 haldi ghati ke yuddh kaa nirnay kuch hi ghanton main ho gaya tha
 All the three wars of Panipat had ended in one day, but the war of Veerwar Gokulsinh also continued on the third day
 tisare din, fir bhayankar sangram hua
 About it, a historian says that the Jat invasion was so strong that the royal army's feet were uprooted, but then a new crowning Mughal army came under the leadership of Hasan Ali Khan
 is sena ne gokulasinh kii vijay ko paraajay main badal diya
 Emperor Alamgir's honor was saved
 jaaton ke pair to ukhd gaye fir bhi apane gharon ko nahin bhaage
 unka gantavy bani tilapat kii gadhi jo yuddh kshetra se bees mile dur thi
 From the third day, a fierce war broke out here and continued for three days
 baari topon ke bich tilapat kii gadhi bhi iske aage tik nahin saki or uskaa patan ho gaya
 After the fall of Tilpat, Gokulsingh and his tau Uday Singh were taken as family captives
 unke saat hajaar saathi bhi bandi hue
 in sabko agra laayaa gaya
 Aurangzeb had already arrived and was ensconced in the Red Fort's crazy mango
 sabhi bandiyon ko uske saamne pesh kiya gaya
 Aurangzeb said - adhisankhya jaaton ne kaha - "badshaah, agar tere khuda or rasul kaa kaa rasta vahi he jis par tu chal rahaa he to hamen tere raste par nahin chalanaa
" The next day, Gokulsingh and Uday Singh were brought to Agra Kotwali - a body bound in iron, tied hands, neck to foot
 The first ax of the executioner ran on the shapely arm of Gokulsinh, when a mass of thousands of people got up crying
 His right arm, dislocated with an ax, started to fall and fell on the platform
 parantu us vir kaa mukh hi nahin sharir bhi nishkamp tha
 He cast an eye on the fountain, and then looked at the executioners to strike another
 parantu jallaad jaldi main nahin the
 He had similar instructions
 duusare kulhaade par hajaaron log aartnaad kar uthe
 unamem hindu or musalmaan sabhi the
 Many closed their eyes
 Many escaped crying
 kotwali ke chaaron ore maano pralay ho rahi thi
 One was not aware of the other
 vaataavaran main ek hi dhwani thi- "he ram!


he rahim !! idhar agra main gokulasinh kaa sir gira, udhar mathura main keshavaraiji kaa mandir ! Samaraveer Gokula: Poetry of the Kisan Revolution rajasthan ke sammanit evam purashkrut kaviver shri balvir singh ‘karun’ apane geetikavy or prabandhkavy kii pragatisheel bhartiya jivan drushti or prabhaavapurn shabdashilp ke kaaran ab akhil bhartiya str par charchit hai
 Karun ji, inspired by Rashtrakavi Dinkar's poetry, has been decorated with the title of Dinkar ji's Aksharputra in Nalanda's thought meeting
 is ojasvi or manasvee kavi ne ‘samarvir gokula’ naamak prabandh kavy kii rachana kar satrahavin sadi ke ek upekshit adhyay ko jeevant kar diya he
 When this country, which is concerned about varna-caste and heaven-class, forgets itself
 konne main khaaj kii tarah vampanthi itihaaskaar or sahityakar swatantray sangharsh ke itihaas ke prishthon ko hataa detaa he
 But the progressive national poetry stream has throbbed with new heat and new energy and held its writing
 parinaam he-‘samarvir gokula’
 It should be remembered that even in the beautiful environment of Reetikal, all Sri Guru Govind Singh, Lalkavi, Bhushan, Sudan and Chandrashekhar composed the heroic poetry
 unki prerana bhoomi rashtriya bhaavana hi thi
 In the modern era, Balvir Singh 'karun' made a grand presentation of 'samar Veer Gokula' in the first decade of the twenty-first century after 'vijay Ketu' and 'I speak Dronacharya'
 yah ‘vijay ketu’ kii kavyakala tathaa pragatisheel itihaas drushti ke utkarsh kaa pramaan he
 'samaraveer Gokula is a national poem of the seventeenth century peasant revolution
 kavi ne bhoomika main likhaa he- ‘maharana pratap, maharana raaj singh, chhatrapati shivaji, hasan khan mewati, guru govind singh, mahavir gokula tathaa bharatpur ke jat shaskaon ke alaava aise or adhik naam nahin ginaye ja sakate jinhone mughal satta ko khulkar lalakaara ho
 Veer Gokula should be named prominently because he laughed under the nose of Delhi and set up an army of 20 thousand peasant soldiers, who were unpaid, untrained and equipped with domestic weapons
 yah baat vistaar ke liye na bhuulakar raashtra kii raksha hetu pranarpan karne aaye the
 ' shyaamanarayan pandeya rachit ‘haldighati’, pan mohanlal mahato ‘viyogi’ pranit ‘aryavartt’, prabhatakrut ‘rashtrapurush’ or shrikrishna ‘saral’ ke prabandh kavy kii charchaa band he
 'tulsidas' and 'shivaji's letter' composed by Nirala are both neglected
 dinakar or nepali ke kavy vismrit kiye ja rahe hai
 However, the compositions of progressive Indian way of life in poetry begin to come up with new consciousness
 pramaan he-‘samarvir gokula’ kii prashansit prastuti
 The inspiration of this poem was such that it was written in just forty days
 iskaa mahaduddeshy aisa ki bhartiya itihaas kaa ek sangharkshil adhyay kavyarup dhaaran kar kavyangat main dhyaan aakrisht karne laga
 Medieval gallantry and martyrdom came alive in national consciousness and started echoing in management
 upeshit jat kisaan kaa tejomay samarpit vyaktitv apane tej se damak uthaa
 In history, the character of the repressed Narnahar Gokul came in front of everyone in the verses
 aath sargon kaa yah prabandhkavy ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak kaa mahatvapurn avdaan he
 The poet has endured the suffering of Gokul born in the peasant clan of Mathura
 us peeda ne rashtriya sandarbh main upekshit ko kavyanjali dene kaa prayaas kiya he
 Remember the compassion of the poet, etc
 Then the importance of inspiration of the poet 'karun' will become clear
 isiilie kavi ne pratham satr main gokul ke kisaan vyaktitv ko mughal badshaah ke samaksh prastut kiya he
 Gokul was replaced by the Nikash of the supremacy of the High God
 atah kisaan-majdoor-dalit ke utthan ke yug main gokul kii upeksha kab tak hoti! usne to kisaan jivan ke astitv evam asmita ke liye aamaran sangharsh kiya
 Resolved to oppose peasant repression by foreign Mughal rule
 videshi mughal shashan dwaara kisaan daman ke virodh kaa sankalp kiya
 That is why the poet has written in the first canto- kavi ne mahasoos kiya he ki tilapat kaa gokul shahenshaah aurangzeb ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ban gaya tha
 But what did your loved ones do? - kavi ne duusare sarg main yug kii visham sthitiyon or bhartiya ashavad ko aitihaasik or prakritik sandarbh main apni kavyakala dwaara chitrit kar diya he
 The time cycle of nature arouses hope - bhartiya drushti kii maanviya jijeevishaa tathaa aashaa ke manohar rup dekhen - In Brijmandal, the hero Gokul was born
 yahi ashavad kaa aadhaar bana
 The third canto is a panorama of the farmer life of Gokul - in images and paintings
 kisaan jivan kaa aisa varnan-chithran anyatra viral he
 The feel of the poet is presented with his condolences and shrewd fun
 faltah yah kisaan jivan kaa prabandh kavy ban gaya he
 But the farmer could not fill his stomach during the Mughal rule
 karadhaan bhayaavah tha
 Jaziya was charged as a terrible punishment for the Kafir farmer
 atah peeda gaharaati jaati thi
 But the poet has not been able to describe the hard and fast rule of Mughal rule
 pratyaksh atyaachaar se rosh-aakrosh or vidroh kaa varnan swaabhaavik rup main chauthe sarg main kiya he
 This canto has become a concept of revolution and conflict resolution
 sach he ki mathura ke kisaan kanha or baldau ke ansh na the
 Remembering his pride, he started thundering like a lion
 kavi kii rashtriya chetana keval mathura or jat kisaan kii baat nahin karti
 He remembers the blood of India
 tabhi to dilli kaa takht saham uthaa
 On the other hand, twenty thousand farmers got organized and stood against the throne
 kavi kii lekhnee kii pragatisheel drushti dekhen- The public awakened by connecting with the culture
 mughal atyaachaar ke viruddh gokul kaa jayakaar hone laga
 The struggle started
 kavi ne aage kii teen sargon main gokul or uski kisaan kranti sena ke swatantray sangram kaa pramanik varnan kiya he
 From the national point of view, the repressive forms of Mughal rule, the resentment of the peasants and the bravery of the united struggle are the characteristics of this war
 kavi ne satrahavin sadi kii kisaan sena ke sangram ko ikkisvin sadi main dikhaakar ek nayi rashtriya chetana sfoort kar di he
 This neglected chapter is inspiring the dust by showing its stunning form
 kavi karun ne paanchaven tathaa chathe sarg main sadabad or tilapat ke bheeshan sangharsh ko apni chirparichit varnan style main tathaa bimbpurn shilp se pratyaksh kar diya he
 Such is the personality of the hero Gokul Kavya - aise shauryashirsh gokul ne mughal chhavnee sadabad par adhikaar karke mughalon ko hatprabh kar diya tha
 But historians ignored it
 atah kavi ne likh diya he- These historians remain silent on the foreign tyrannical form of the Mughals
 par kavi balvir singh ne gokul ke shaury se ghabaraaye aurangzeb kaa sajiv chithran kar diya he - His throne shook
 samrajya kaa bhugol simatata gaya
 Therefore Aurangzeb himself came in 1669 with a big army
 gokul ke kendra tilapat main bheeshan sangram hone laga
 See a picture of that war - yruddh chalata rahaa
 The strength of the Mughal army increased
 tilapat par dabaav badhata rahaa
 Gokul was at war with his uncle Uday Singh till the last moment
 paraajay niyati ban gayi
 Imprisoned and brought before Aurangzeb
 usne nirbhik bhav se atyaachaari shahenshaah ke prati apni ghor ghrinaa vyakt kar di
 The seventh canto is the proof
 aurangzeb is tejasvi kisaan nayak ko dekh dang rah gaya
 He sentenced to death
 vikalp dharmantaran rahaa
 VIII canto - The final canto is the climax of the management
 kavi ne swatantray-sangram ke kaaran ghoshit prandand kii bhoomika ke rup main prakruti, prakruti kii rahasyachetana tathaa bhartiya chintan ke anusaar aatma kii amarta kaa aakhyaan sunaaya he
 The poet says- atah gokul apane dharm kaa parityag nahin karegaa
 They both want to be punished to become immortal
 is visham paristhiti-swatantrasangram, paraajay or prandand yaa dharmaparivartan main kavi kaa prashn he, rashtriya chetana kaa prashn he- All these bright stars samaran he ki san 1670 ke sangharsh evam shahadat ke baad satnamiyon ne shahadat di he
 Shivaji's struggle was successful in 1674
 parantu 1675 main guru teg bahadur ne kashmir ke liye balidaan diya
 But Surajmal of Bharatpur hoisted the independent flag
 shaayad isi sangharsh-shrankhla kaa parinaam rahaa san 1947 kaa pandraa agast
 History should not forget this series of conflicts
 sahityakar to bhuulane nahin degaa
 This thesis of Balveer Singh 'karun' is justifying his
 kavi satrahavin sadi ke saath ikkisvin sadi kii rashtriyachetana se anupranit he
 Hence its value increases
 yah prabandhkavy hindi kavy kii uplabdhi he
 The writing of the poet is appreciated

 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi
 Gandhiji named these untouchables as Harijans whom they considered to be children of God
 8 may 1933 ko gandhi ji ne harijan andolan main madad karne ke liye aatm shuddhikaran kaa 21 din tak chalane vaala upwas kiya
 This new campaign was not liked by the Dalits however he remained a prominent leader

 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled
 us samay desh ke pramukh mandiron main harijanon kaa pravesh purnatah pratibandhit tha
 Thrissur, the district of Kerala state, is a major religious city in South India
 yaheen ek pratishthit mandir he guuruvayur mandir, jisamen krishna bhagwaan ke balaroop ke darshan karaati bhagwaan guruvayurppan kii murti sthapit he
 Like other temples before independence, there was complete ban on entry of Harijans in this temple too

 The trustees of the temple were told that the first day of the new year, that is, January 1, 1934, would be celebrated as the last decision day and that in the event of no determination from their level on this date, the activists by Mahatma Gandhi and Mr
 Kelappan Fasting can be done in favor of is kaaran guruvayur mandir ke trusteo kii ore se baithak bulaakar mandir ke upasko kii raay bhi praapt kii gayi
 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai
 With the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi, the first day of January was celebrated as the determination day and the decision made was received

 He did not disagree with the party's move but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with the Indians would facilitate the strengthening of the party's membership which has hitherto belonged to communists, socialists, trade associations, students, religious leaders
 Laker existed between trade unions and various voices
 isse in sabhi ko apni apni baton ke sun jane kaa avasar praapt hoga
 Gandhi, while leading a party for Raj, did not want to prove any goal by campaigning which would be accepted as a political arrangement with Raj temporarily
 gandhi ji nehru presidensi or congress ke lahore adhiveshan ke saath hi 1936 main bharat laut aae
 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future
 usne congress ko samaajwaad ko apane uddeshy ke rup main apnaane se nahin roka
 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye
 Gandhi and his supporters made it clear that he would not support the war effort unless India was granted immediate independence
 unhone spasht kiya ki is baar bhi yah aandolan band nahin hoga yadi hinsa ke vyaktigat krityon ko moort rup diya jaataa he
 He said that the order of anarchy around him is worse than the real one
 unhone sabhi congressiyon or bharatiyon ko ahimsa ke saath karo yaa maro ke dwaara antim swatantrata ke liye anushaasan banaae rakhane ko kaha
 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life
 unka 50 saal purana sachiv mahadev desai 6 din baad hi dil kaa daura padane se mar gaye or gandhi ji ke 18 maheene jail main rahane ke baad 22 farvari 1944 ko unki patni kasturba gandhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria
 unke kharaab swasthya or jaruri upachaar ke kaaran 6 may 1944 ko yuddh kii samaapti se purv hi unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Raj did not want to see him dying in jail which would increase the anger of the country
 haalanki bharat chodo andolan ko apane uddeshy main ashink safalataa hi mili lekin andolan ke nishthur daman ne 1943 ke ant tak bharat ko sangathit kar diya
 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country

 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Leaders like Sardar Patel feared that Pakistan could use this money to wage war against India
 jab yah maang uthne lagi ki sabhi muslimon ko pakistan bheja jaae or muslimon or hindu netaaon ne is par asantosh vyakt kiya or ek duusare ke saath samjhauta karne se manaa karne se gandhi ji ko gaharaa sadma pahunchaa
 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India

 varsh 1884 main ve kavitaayen 'bhanusingh thakurer padaabali' naam se prakashit huin
 These poems were earlier published at various times in a magazine called 'bharati'
 in kavitaaon ke rachana kaa itihaas baad main rabindranath thakur ne 'jibansmriti' granth ke 'bhanusinher kabita' naamak adhyay main varnit kiya he

 mahabharat hinduon kaa ek pramukh kavy granth he, jo smriti ke itihaas varg main aata he
 Sometimes it is simply called "india"
 yah kavyagranth bharat kaa anupam dharmik, puranic, aitihaasik or darshanik granth hai
 It is the world's longest literary text and epic, one of the main texts of Hinduism
 is granth ko hindu dharm main pancham veda mana jaataa he
 Although it is considered to be one of the most unique works of literature, even today, this book is an exemplary source for every Indian
 yah kriti pracheen bharat ke itihaas kii ek gaatha he
 In this, the most sacred book of Hinduism is contained in the Bhagavad Gita
 puure mahabharat main lagbhag 1,10,000 shloke hai, jo unani kaavyon elliod or odissi se pariman main das guna adhik hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, mythological references and the Mahabharata itself, the creator of this poem is considered to be Vedavas ji
 is kavy ke rachayita vedavyas ji ne apane is anupam kavy main vedon, vedangon or upanishdon ke guhyatam rahasyon kaa nirupan kiya hai
 Apart from this, justice, education, medicine, astrology, warfare, yogashastra, economics, architecture, craftsmanship, kamshastra, astronomy and theology are also described in detail in this poem
 vedavyas ji ko mahabharat puraa rachane main 3 varsh lag gayi the, iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki us samay lekhan lipi kala kaa itnaa vikaas nahi hua tha, us kaal main rishiyon dwaara vaidic granthon ko peedi dar peedi paramparaagat maukhik rup se yaad karke surakshit rakhaa jaataa tha
 Sanskrit was the language of the sages at that time and Brahmi was the language of common language
 is prakaar rishiyon dwaara sampoorn vaidic sahitya maukhik rup se yaad kar peedi dar peedi sahastron varshon tak yaad rakhaa gaya
 Then gradually, with the fall of the Vedic era due to the influence of time, the style of memorizing the Vedic literature of the sages disappeared, since then the practice of writing Vedic literature on manuscripts became safe
 yah sarvamaanya he ki mahabharat kaa aadhunik rup kai avasthaaon se guzar kar bana he
 Four early stages of its creation have been identified by scholars
 ye avasthaaen sambhavit rachana kaal kram main nimna likhit hai: Saraswati River dwarka Devi Saraswati Chav Tato Jayamudirayet
 
 The Mahabharata is a story of a war between two families of the Kauravas and the Pandavas of the Chandravanshi
 100 kaurav bhaaiyon or paanch pandav bhaaiyon ke bich bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 Several different dates have been set by Indian and Western scholars of this war
 mukhya ullekh :mahabharat kii vistrut katha According to the Puranas, Brahma was born from Atri, Atri to the Moon, Moon to Mercury and Mercury to ila-nandan Pururava
 unase aayu, aayu se raja nahush or nahush se yayati utpann hue
 Purified by Yayati
 puru ke vansh main bharat or bharat ke kul main raja kuru hue
 Shantanu happened in the lineage of Kuru
 shantanu se ganganandan bhishma utpann hue
 From Shantanu, Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born from Satyavati's womb
 chitrangad naam vaale gandharv ke dwaara maare gayi or raja vichitraveery rajyakshma se grast ho swargavaasi ho gayi
 Then by the order of Satyavati, Vyasji produced Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu from the womb of Ambalika by Neog
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari dwaara sau putron ko janm diya, jinamein duryodhana sabase bada tha or pandu ke yudhistor, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place
 ek baar van main akhet khelte hue pandu ke baan se ek maithunarat mrigarupadhari rishi kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cursed by that sage, "now whenever you are maltreated, you will die", Pandu becomes very sad and abandons all lusts including his queens and makes Dhritarashtra in Hastinapur to live in the forest
 raja pandu ke kehane par kunti ne durvasa rishi ke diye mantra se dharm ko aamantrit kar unase yudhisthir or kaalaantar main vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna ko utpann kiya
 Madri gave birth to that mantra from Kunti and gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva from Ashwankumar
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman karte hue pandu ke man chanchal ho jane se maithun main pravruth huye jisase shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 kunti ne vivaah se pehle surya ke ansh se karn ko janm diya or loklaj ke bhay se karn ko ganga nadi main baha diya
 Adhiratha, the charioteer of Dhritarashtra, saved him and followed him
 karn kii ruchi yudhkala main thi atah dronacharya ke manaa karne par usne parashuram se shiksha praapt kii
 Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas many times in his childhood due to Shakuni's treachery and even in his youth, when Yudhishthira was made the crown prince, he tried to send the Pandavas to Lakshagraha, the home of Laksha, and burn them with fire, but the aid of Vidur
 Due to this, they got out of that burning house
 pandav vahaan se ekachakra nagari gayi or muni kaa vesh banaakar ek brahman ke ghar main nivas karne lage
 Then at the behest of Vyas ji, he went to Panchal kingdom where Draupadi was going to be a swayamvara
 vahaan ek ke baad ek sabhi raajaaon evam rajkumaron ne machhlee par nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi
 After this, Arjuna, seeing the reflection in Telapatra, penetrated Matsya with a single arrow and Draupadi went ahead and put a garland on Arjun's neck
 mata kunti ke vachananusaar paanchon pandavon ne draupadi ko patnirup main praapt kiya
 At the time of Draupadi's swayamvara, along with Duryodhana, Drupada, Dhritadumayan and many others had suspected that they were only five Brahmin Pandavas
 atah unki pariksha karne ke liye drupad ne unhen apane rajaprasaad main bulaayaa
 In Rajprasad, Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna showed the first treasury but the Pandavas did not show any interest in Ratnabhushans and ratna-manikya etc
 kept there
 kintu jab ve shastraagaar main gayi to vahaan rakhe astr-shastron main un sabhi ne bahut adhik ruchi dikhaayi or apni pasand ke shastron ko apane paas rakh liya
 Their activity convinced Drupada that they are Pandavas as Brahmins
 draupadi swayamvar se purv vidura ko chhodkar sabhi pandavon ko mrit samajhane lage or is kaaran dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya
 In order to avoid the crisis of civil war, Yudhishthira accepted Khandav forest as half the state in the ruins given by Dhritarashtra
 vahaan arjuna ne shrikrishna ke saath milakar samast devataaon ko yuddh main parrast karte hue khandvavan ko jala diya or indra ke dwaara kii hui vrishti kaa apane baanon ke chhatrakaar band se nivaaran karke agni dev ko trupt kiya
 As a result, Arjuna received the divine Gandiva bow and the best chariot from Agnidev and Shri Krishna received the Sudarshan Chakra
 indra apane putr arjuna kii veerta dekhakar atiprasann hue
 He removed the forests of Khandavaprastha
 uske uparaant pandavon ne shrikrishna ke saath may daanav kii sahaayta se us shahar kaa soundaryikaran kiya
 The city became like a second heaven
 indra ke kehane par dev shilpi vishwakarma or may daanav ne milakar khandav van ko indrapuri jitne bhavy nagar main nirmit kar diya, jise indraprastha naam diya gaya
 The Pandavas, while conquering all directions, performed a Rajsuya yagna, complete with abundant gold
 unka vaibhav duryodhana ke liye asay ho gaya atah shakuni, karn or duryodhana aadi ne yudhisthir ke saath jue main pravrutt hokar uske bhaaiyo, draupadi or unke rajya ko kapat dyut ke dwaara hanste-hanste jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But Gandhari came and stopped this from happening
 dhritarashtra ne ek baar phir duryodhana kii prerana se unhen se jua khilne kii ajna di
 It was decided that whichever side would lose in a single stake, they would wear deer for twelve years and remain in exile for one year
 us ek varsh main bhi yadi unhen pahchaan liya gaya to phir se baarah varsh kaa vanvaas bhogana hoga
 Thus Yudhishthira, after being defeated in gambling, went to the forest with his brothers
 vahaan barahawaan varsh bitne par ek varsh ke agyatavaas ke liye ve viraat nagar main gayi
 When the Kauravas started carrying Virat's cows, they were defeated by Arjuna
 us samay kauravon ne pandavon ko pahchaan liya tha parantu unka kaa agyatavaas tab tak puraa ho chukaa tha
 But even after completing 12 years of known and one-year exile, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 shrikrishna ke suzav par pandavon ne bhishma se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 Bhishma said that the Pandavas fought the battle in front of Shikhandi
 bhishma use kanya hi maanate the or use saamne paakar wo shastr nahin chalaane vaale the
 And Shikhandi also had to avenge the humiliation of his previous birth and for that he took a boon from Shiva that Bhishma's death would be the reason
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya or shikhandi ko saamne dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya or arjuna ne apni banvrishti se unhen baanon ki shayya par sula diya
 Then Acharya Drona assumed the charge of generalship
 phir se donon paksho main bada bhayankar yuddh hua
 Virat and Drupada etc
 were drowned in the sea by King Dronopi
 lekin jab pandavo ne chhal se dron ko yah vishwaas dilaa diya ki ashwatthama maaraa gaya
 So Acharya Drona was disappointed and gave up his weapon and left his body after taking yoga samadhi
 aise samay main dhridhyumna ne yoga samadhi liye dron kaa mastak talwaar se kaat kar bhoomi par gira diya
 After Drona slaughter, Karna became the captain of the Kaurava army
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many heroes of the enemy side with his arrows
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya
 Due to the curse of Guru Parshuram, he finds himself unable to use the divine weapons and comes down to remove the wheel of the chariot
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske dwaara kiye abhimanyu vadh, kuru sabha main draupadi ko veshya or uski karn vadh karne kii pratigya yaad dilaakar use maarane ko kehete he, tab arjuna ne ek divine astr se karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 Subsequently, King Shalya became the commander of the Kaurava army, but he could last only half a day in the war
 dopaher hote-hote raja yudhisthir ne unhen maar diya
 Duryodhana's entire army was killed, and in the end he had a miserable battle with Bhimsen
 bhim ne chhal se uski jaangh par prahaar karke use maar daalaa
 To take revenge of this, Ashwatthama put an Akshauhini army of Pandavas, the five sons of Draupadi, her Panchaldeshi brothers and Dhritadhyumna to sleep forever
 tab arjuna ne ashwatthama ko parrast karke uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 Ashwatthama then used Brahmastra on Uttara's womb
 uskaa garbh uske astr se praaia dagdh ho gaya tha, kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ne usko pun: jivan-daan diya
 The same womb of Uttara later became known as King Parikshit
 is yuddh ke ant main kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama teen kauravapakshiya or paanch pandav, saatyaki tathaa shrikrishna ye saat pandavapakshiya vir jivit bache
 Yudhishthira then came to the throne
 brahmanon or gandhari ke shaap ke kaaran yadavakul kaa sanhaar ho gaya
 Balbhadra left his body with yoga and went into the ocean as Sheshnag
 bhagwaan krishna ke sabhi praputra ek din mahamuniyon kii shakti dekhne ke liye ek ko stri banaakar muniyon ke paas gaye or poocha ki he munishreshth! yah mahila garbh se he, hamen bataaen ki iske garbh se kiskaa janm hoga? muniyon ko gyaat hua ki yah balak unase krida karte hue ek purush ko mahila bana unke paas laae hai
 The sages cursed Krishna's great-grandchildren that a pestle will lick from this human's womb, which will end your dynasty
 krishna ke prapautron nen us moosal ko pathar par ragad kar chura bana nadi main baha diya tathaa uske nok ko phenk diya
 All of Krishna's great-grandchildren died from the leaves of the tree produced from that powder
 yah dekh shrikrishna bhi ek ped ke neeche dhyaan lagaakar beth gayi
 a hunter named 'zara' placed the tip of the pestle on the tip of his arrow and struck the arrow with the footstool of Lord Krishna as an antelope
 us baan dwaara krishna ke pair kaa chumban unke paramdhaam gaman kaa kaaran bana
 The Lord departed Goloka with his entire body
 iske baad samudr ne dwarkapuri ko apane jal main dubaa diya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas from the mouth of Arjuna returning from Dwarka, Yudhishthira, considering the impermanence of the world, placed Parikshit on the Rajasana and took Draupadi and the brothers along the path of Mahaprasthana towards the Himalayas
 us mahapath main yudhisthir ko chhod sabhi ek-ek karke gir pade
 In the end, Yudhishthira climbed on Indra's chariot and went to heaven with his brothers
 or adhik yahan C: Dhritarashtra and Pandu were born to Vyasa after the demise of Vichitravirya
 c: kunti ko vivaah se pehle karn paidaa hua
 D: Pandavas were the sons of Pandu

 The one who expresses the last universal truth-principle will be expressed as the last incarnation
 ab tak hue avatar, paigambar, ishdoot ityadi ko ham sabhi unke hone ke baad, unke jivan kaal kii avadhi main yaa unke sharir tyaag ke baad se hi jaanate hai
 But the hypothesis about the 24th incarnation of Mahavishnu and the tenth in major incarnations and the last Kalki avatar for the future i
e
 tomorrow to come is as follows- Name form - 'kalki Purana' Various religious of Hindus And is one of the mythological texts
 vishnu ke anya avtaron kii tarah kalki kaa varnan bhi vedon main nahin miltaa
 But the Puranas have detailed descriptions of the Kalki avatar
 vishnu puraana or bhagavat puraana donon main hi kalki avatar kaa ullekh aayaa hai
 The Kalki Puranas are completely focused on this incarnation
 lagbhag sabhi puraanon ke anusaar kalki kaa janm ek brahman vishnuyash ke ghar par hoga
 Kalki Bhagavan will be a devotee of Shiva and his guru will be Parashurama
 kalki puraana main ”kalki“ avatar ke janm va parivaar kii katha is prakaar kalpit he- ”shambhal naamak gram main vishnuyash naam ke ek brahman nivas karenge, jo sumati naamak stri ke saath vivaah karengen donon hi dharm-karm main din bitaayenge
 Kalki will be born as a son in his house and will recite the Vedadi scriptures at a young age
 baad main ve jeevon ke dukh se kaatar ho mahadev kii upasna karke astravidya praapt karenge jinka vivaah brihadrath kii putree padmadevi ke saath hoga
 " jis prakaar saamaanya vyaavhaarik rup main bhavishya main janm lene vaale kisi bhi vyakti kaa naam nishchit karnaa asambhav he usee prakaar uske mata-pita, janm sthaan or patni ko bhi nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 It is worth noting that all incarnations, prophets, prophets etc
 came during the royal system
 jab kalki puraana likhaa gaya hoga tab rajtantr vyavastha thi isliye bhavishya ke kalki kii katha purnataya usee style main hi he jis style main anya avtaron kii katha he
 The feeling of Vishwamana's share can be expressed by any person whose projection or presentation is only through the person's own culture at that time
 phir bhi kalki katha ke bhi kuch na kuch arth to avashya he
 Careful- kalki avatar ke kaliyug main hindustan ke sambhal main hone par sabhi hindu sahamat hai parantu sambhal kahan he isamen anek matbhed hai
 Some scholars consider Sambhal in Orissa, Himalaya, Punjab, Bengal and Shankarpur
 kuch sambhal ko china ke gobhi marusthal main maanate hai jahaan manushya pahunch hi nahin saktaa
 Some believe in Vrindavan
 kuch sambhal ko muradabad jile main maanate hai jahaan kalki avatar mandir bhi he
 The subject to consider is that "sambhal will have Kalki avatar or where Kalki avatar will be the same
" “ sambhal kaa shabdic arth samaan rup se bhala yaa shaanti karnaa yaa shaanti hona arthath jahaan shaanti va aman ho yaa shaanti failaane vaala ho, hota he
 In the Kalki Purana, 68 pilgrimage sites are mentioned in Sambhal
 kaliyug main keval sambhal hi ek maatr aisa tirth sthaan hoga jo kalyaan daayak or shaanti pradaan karne vaala hoga
 The meaning of the pilgrimage is in the meaning of holy place, darshan, heart, mind, heart, ghat, pond, place of water, immortal living water, place of people coming and gathering place
 brahman pita vishnuyash or mata sumati- kalki puraana ke anusaar kalki avatar ke pita va mata kaa naam vishnuyash va sumati hoga, jo naam nahin balki gunon ko nirdeshit karata he
 a Brahmin means one who knows the Vedas, the Puranas and the pure Supreme consciousness
 vishnu arthath parameshwar, sarvavyaapak ish jo sab sthanon main upasthit he, brahmand ko paidaa karne vaala sristaa
 Yash means praise or praise
 is prakaar pita vishnuyash kaa arth hua, aisa pita jo sarvavyaapak paramatma kii stuti evam prashansa karne vaala va sabakaa bhala karne vaala hitaishi he
 Similarly, Sumati means to have a beautiful or good opinion or idea
 kalki avatar kii patni - kalki puraana main It is said about the "kalki" incarnation that- "he will be married to Padmadevi, the daughter of Brihadratha
" “ parantu katra-jammu main vaishno devi kii katha ke sambandh main bikne vaali pustika, internet par uplabdh katha or gulshan kumaar krit ”maan vaishno devi“ pradarshit film par aadhaarit katha ke anusaar ”trikuta ne shriram se kaha- usne unhen pati rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Shriram tells him that he has pledged to be loyal to Sita only in this incarnation but Lord Shriram assured him that in Kali Yuga he would appear as Kalki and marry her
 “ a description of a goddess is found in Kriskindhand of Sriramcharitmanas
 inhone hanumanji tathaa anya banar biron ko jal va fal diya tha tathaa unhen gupha se nikaalkar sagar ke tat par pahunchaaya tha
 These Goddesses are Swayamprabha
 yahi devi mata vaishnav ke rup main pratishthit hai
 Kalki will be the incarnation of God in the last phase of Kali Yuga
 tab ye kalki bhagwaan dushton ko dandit karenge or dharti par dharm kii sthapana karenge
 And Devi Swayamprabha will marry as promised in Sri Ramavatar
 arthath vaishno devi jo yugon se pind rup main hai unhen kalki avatar ek saakaar rup pradaan karenge jo ”maan vaishno devi“ ke saakaar rup ”maan kalki devi“ hogin
 Body shape - maharishi vyas rachit or ishwar ke aathven avatar shri krishna ke mukh se vyakt shrimadbhagavadgita main bhi avatar ke hone kaa pramaan miltaa he
 From time to time, we have religious faith in India
 abhiyutthanam dharmasy tadatmanan srujamyaham
 
 arthath he bharat! jis kaal main dharm kii haani hoti he or adharm kii adhikta hoti he
 It is in that period that i reveal my soul
 is prakaar kalki avatar kaa sharir maanav kaa hi hoga jisase aatma kaa rup prakat hoga or krishna rup hoga
 Karma Roop - Kalki Mahavatar will destroy all evil by riding a white horse with a sword in his hand
 kisi bhi dharm shastron main vichaaron ke nirupan ke liye pratikon kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he kyonki vichaar kii koi akruti nahin hoti
 Thus, on clarifying the meaning of Kalki avatar, we find that the white horse means the symbol of peace or the non-violent path, the sword means knowledge, the universal truth-principle which will lead to mental slaughter of all
 agar ham in pratikon ko usee rup main len to kya aaj ke ek se ek vigyaan aadhaarit shastr arthath aujaar ke yug main talwaar se kitne logon kaa vadh sambhav he or vah vyakti kitna shaareerik shakti se yukt hoga, yah vichaarneey vishay he? The result is only one mental slaughter which is possible only by universal truth-theory
 or pichley avtaron dwaara shaareerik va aarthik kaarnon kaa prayog kar dharm sthapana ho chukaa he
 Kalki Purana Katha creators would not have even imagined that in the future a new system based on visual matter science based visual time and formless constitution will also come and at that time there will be no king and monarchy, then whom will Kalki Avatar kill? Dvya or world form - according to the qualities of Kalki incarnation, the true form of doing karma is shown with one step and with many hands symbolizing many karma
 isse yah spasht hota he ki kalki avatar dwaara ek karm sampann hoga or uske kaaran anek haathon se karm hone lagegein arthath ve yah kehane main sakasham hogen ki ”main anek haathon se karm kar rahaa hoon or sabhi mere hi karmgyaan se karm ko kar rahen hai
 " saarvbhaum satya gyaan ke shaastra ”gita“ ke baad saarvbhaum karmgyaan kii aavashyaktaa he jo kalki avatar ke kaaryo kaa hi ek charan he
 Knowledge Form - Knowledge of the last universal truth-principle will be the knowledge form of the last incarnation, which will have the following reasons
 1
 prakruti ke teen gun- satv, raj, tam se mukt hokar ishwar se saakshaatkaar karne ke ”gyaan“ kaa shaastra ”shrimadbhagavadgita yaa gita yaa gitopanishad“ uplbdh ho chukaa tha parantu saakshaatkaar ke uparant karm karne ke gyaan arthath ishwar ke mastishk kaa ”karmgyaan“ kaa shaastra uplabdh nahin hua tha arthath ishwar ke saakshaatkaar kaa shaastra to uplabdh tha parantu ishwar ke karm karne kii vidhi kaa shaastra uplabdh nahin tha
 Man needs his brain more than God
 2
 prakruti kii vyakhya kaa gyaan kaa shaastra ”shrimadbhagavadgita yaa gita yaa gitopanishad“ to uplabdh tha parantu brahmand kii vyakhya kaa tantra shaastra uplabdh nahin tha
 3
 Individual religion was available in the society, but macroeconomic science was not available so that humans can live in their own religions and respect other religion, also understand national religion and know their duty towards it
 4
 shaastra-sahitya se bhare is sansar main koi bhi ek aisa maanak shaastra uplabdh nahin tha jisase purna gyaan kii uplabdhi ho sake saath hi maanav or uske shashan pranali ke satyikaran ke liye anant kaal tak ke liye maargdarshan praapt ho sake
 5
 Many different types of scriptures were available to understand God, but the scripture to understand the avatar was not available
 kalki avatar ke guru – According to the Kalki Purana, "lord Parashurama will be the guru of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu and teach him war
 ve hi kalki ko bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke divya shastr praapt karne ke liye kahenge
 "states had been established by many Asuri kings until the sixth incarnation in the truth-based Satyuga with personal unseen natural consciousness in the personal attest of the invisible period - Parashurama incarnation
 As a result, in such a situation, a man's soul was in circumstances created by the invisible natural consciousness
 Working in the present with priority, was established in and she has done many things Slaughtered the castes and established a new system by co-existence of Asuras and Devas
 jo ek nai or acchhee vyavastha thi
 Therefore, that man was later known as Parashurama incarnation in his name and the system was known as "parashurama tradition", which was the birth of the realization "loktantra", the same based democracy system was spread by Shriram and failed
 In the Dwapar Yuga, after the completion of the Mahabharata war, Lord Krishna had laid the foundation of the formless democratic system, when Lord Mercury Uti found and is currently shapeless constitution based democracy front
 isi vyavastha kii purnataa ke liye kalki avatar honge
 Which can be done only with the understanding of Shiva system, that is, it is the weapon of Shiva and because of understanding democracy, Parashurama will be the guru of Kalki
 kalki avatar mandir - The 24th incarnation of Mahavishnu and the tenth and last Kalki avatar in major incarnations are the only incarnations whose idols are being installed in the Siddhapeeths before their incarnation
 yun to jahaan-jahaan vishnu ke avtaron ko mandir main sthaan diya gaya he vahaan-vahaan anya avtaron ke saath kalki avatar kii bhi prakshepit murti pratishthit he

 usee saarvbhaum satya ko uganusaar yoga karaayaa jaataa he keval bheed ikattha ho jane se kuch bhi nahin hota
 To identify avatars, the most basic theme is what is giving something new that affects the peace, unity, stability and development of the majority of the society at that time
 saarvbhaum satya ko vyakt karne vaala prayek maanav sharirdhari avatar hi he parantu yug ke sarvocch str ke saarvbhaum satya ko vyakt karne vaala yugavatar kehalaata he

 Dental caries, also known as dental caries or perforation, is a disease in which bacterial processes damage the hardening of the tooth
 ye utak kramshah tuutane lagate hai, jisase dant-kshay utpann ho jate hai
 Tooth decay is caused by two bacteria: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus
 If left untreated, the disease can result in pain, tooth loss, infection, and even death in extreme conditions
 vartmaan main, danta-kshay puure vishwa main sabase aam beemaari bana hua he
 The study of dental caries is called tuberology
 kshayon kii prastuti main antar ho saktaa he; haalanki, jokhim kaarak or vikaas ke charan ek samaan hote hai
 Initially, it may appear as a small pore area, which eventually develops into a large hole
 kabhi-kabhi kshay ko pratyaksh rup se dekha bhi ja saktaa he, haalanki daanton ke kam darshneey bhaagon ke liye va kshati ke vistaar kaa akalan karne ke liye isaki pahchaan kii anya vidhiyon, jaise radiograph, kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Tooth decay is caused by a specific type of acid-producing bacteria that damages teeth in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates, such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose
 daanton kii khanij saamagree lactic amla ke kaaran hone vaali amlata-vruddhi ke prati samvedansheel hoti he
 Typically, a tooth has a continuous process of demineralization and remineralization between teeth and saliva
 jab daant kii sataha par piech 5
5 se neeche chalaa jaataa he, to punarkhnijikaran kii tulana main akhnijikaran adhik tezi se hone lagata he

 These classifications can be used to describe a specific case of tooth decay, so that others can be informed of the situation more accurately and at the same time be informed of the severity of tooth decay
 
 saamanytah sthiti ke aadhaar par vargeekaran karne par kshati ke do prakaar hote hai: chikani sataha par milane vaali kshati or gaddhon va daraaron main milane vaali kshati
 chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa sthaan, vikaas or shrenee gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshati se bhinn hota he
 G
 V
 Blake developed a classification system that is widely used and is based on the condition of tooth decay
 mul vargeekaran main danta-kshayon ko paanch samoohon main rakhaa gaya tha, jinhen shabd “shrenee ” tathaa ek roman ank ke dwaara suchit kiya jaataa tha
 Decay in pits and crevices is reported as Category I; The damage on smooth surface is further divided into Category II, Category III, Category IV and Category V
 danta-kshay ke blake ke vargeekaran main ek shrenee VI bhi joda gaya tha or yah bhi chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Pits and cracks are structural marks on the tooth from which enamel turns inward
 daraaron kaa nirmaan khaanchon ke vikaas ke dauraan hota he, lekin us sthaan par sthit dantabalk puri tarah judaa hua nahin hota
 As a result, a deep linear crater is formed on the enamel's surface structure, which provides a place for dental caries to develop and thrive
 daraaren adhikanshtah pasch daanton kii samrodhak sataha or jambhika par sthit agr daanton kii talvya sataha par sthit hoti hai
 The pits are small, needle-shaped holes, found mostly at the ends or transverse sections of the grooves
 vishisht rup se, charvnak daanton kii bahari satahon par kapol gadde paae jate hai
 For all types of pits and crevices, the highly enamel-folded enamel makes it difficult to maintain oral health care on these surfaces, causing dental damage to develop in these areas is more common
 daanton kii samrodhak parat daant kii kul parat kaa 12
5% hoti he, lekin kul danta-kshayon kaa 50% se adhik bhaag inhen par paaya jaataa he
 90% of total dental caries occur in pits and crevices of children's teeth
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale ksharan kii pahchaan kar paanaa kabhi-kabhi kathin ho saktaa he
 As caries increases, enamel decay near the tooth surface begins to progressively increase in depth
