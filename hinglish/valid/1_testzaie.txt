 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan

 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted

 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr

 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state
 sarvopari, yah pratha is samay aisi sthiti par pahunch chuki thi ki yadi iskaa unmoolan na kiya gaya hota to iske kaaran ne keval rashtriya aarthik samasya par hi varan samaaj suraksha par bhi vipatti aa padati
 Therefore, as a result of the success of elections in 1946, when the Congress cabinet was formed in every province, a bill was introduced to abolish the Zamindari system according to the election pledge

 This rasa has been established in the scripture "bhakti Rasa- Pahla Rasa or Eleventh Rasa" written by Vivek Sahni
 
 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni, while explaining Rasa, has said - arthath vibhaav, anubhav, vyabhichaari bhav ke sanyog se ras kii nishpatti hoti he
 It is said in the well-known literature mirror that when the permanent sense of the heart attains a combination of affect, feeling and communicable feeling, it disappears in the form of rasa
 reetikaal ke pramukh kavi dev ne ras kii paribhaasha in shabdon main kii he : Thus there are four parts of rasa - Permanent feeling, Vibhava, Anubhav and communicative feeling
 bhav kaa arth he:-hona In the conscience of the heart, the psyche which is always present in the form of lust or sanskar and which no opponent or antagonist can suppress, is called permanent emotion
 ye maanav man main beej rup main, chirkaal tak achanchal hokar nivas karte hai
 These represent the sacrament or spirit
 ye sabhi manushyon main usee prakaar chhipe rahete hai jaise mitti main gandh avichhinn rup main samaai rahati he
 They are so capable that they merge with other emotions
 inaki sankhya 11 he - rati, haas, shok, utsaah, krodh, bhay, jugupsa, vismay, nirved, vatsaltaur ishwar vishyak prem
 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray
 The character towards which a character's feelings are awakened is the subject
 sahitya shaastra main is vishay ko alamban vibhaav athwa 'alamban' kehete hai
 The character in which the emotions are awakened is called the shelter
 sthaayee bhav ko jaagrath rakhane main sahaayak kaaran uddipan vibhaav kehalaate hai
 As an example, the enemy standing standing in front of the zeal of Veer Ras is enthusiasm
 shatru ke saath sena, yuddh ke baaje or shatru kii darpoktiyaan, garjana-tarjana, shastr sanchaalan aadi uddipan vibhaav hai
 There are two types of stimulus effects: arthath alamban kii uktiyaan or cheshthaayen That is, objects related to the environment
 prakritik drishyon kii gananaa bhi inhen ke anrtgat hoti hai
 The gestures of shelter that illuminate or convey permanent expressions like Rati, Haas, Mourning etc
 are called Anubhav
 ye cheshtaaen bhav-jagriti ke uparaant aashray main utpann hoti hai isliye inhen anubhav kehete hai, arthath jo bhaavon kaa anugaman kare vah anubhav kehalaata he

 alamban evam uddipan ke madhyam se apane-apane kaarnon dwaara utpann, bhaavon ko baahar prakashit karne vaali saamaanya lok main jo kaary cheshtaaen hoti hai, ve hi kavy naatak aadi main nibaddh anubhav kehalaati hai
 For example, filling the sighs by the Viraha-distraught hero, watching with tears, sweat, thrill, affection in the spirit of union, handling of arms when awakened, harsh speech, red eyes, etc
 will be called Anubhav
 saadhaaran anubhav : arthath ke chaar bhed hai

 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai
 The word sanchari means, to walk together, that is, to be transitive, communicable emotions are transmitted with a permanent emotion, they are capable enough that they can move in harmony with each permanent emotion
 isliye inhen vyabhichaari bhav bhi kaha jaataa he
 The number of communicable or adulterous expressions is considered 33 - Nirveda, guilt, doubt, Asuya, item, labor, laziness, lowliness, anxiety, fascination, memory, dhriti, vriada, chatliya, joy, impulse, inertia, pride, grief, sadness , Sleep, aphasma, dream, prabodh, amarsha, avhitha, raging, mati, disease, hysteria, death, tragedy and disarray
 bharatmuni ne kavy ke aavashyak tatv ke rup main ras kii pratishtha karte hue shringaar, hasya, raudra, karun, vir, adbhut, bibhats tathaa bhayanak naam se uske aath bhedon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he tathaa katipay panktiyon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii kalpana he ki unhone shant naamak nawein ras ko bhi sweekruti di he
 Navaras is the noun of these nine juices
 vibhavanubhav-sancharibhav ke sanyog se in rason kii nishpatti hoti he
 The permanence of each juice is different
 usee kii vibhavadi sanyog se paripurna honevaali nirvighn-pratiti-grahya avasthaa ras kehalaati he
 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's wrath, Karun's grief, valor's excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of beauty, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai
 Bharata has considered the origin of humor, compassion, wonderful and terrible rasa in the first eight rasas, considering Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatsa as the principal
 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished

 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati
 The K-PG boundary or K-T boundary is a thin geological layer present on Earth
 yah seemaa madhyajivi mahakalp ke chaakmay kalp naamak antim charan ke ant or nutanjeev mahakalp ke peliosin kalp naamak pratham charan kii shuruyaat kii sanketak he
 The K-PG boundary is believed to be associated with the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event in which dinosaurs around the world were killed and about 75% of the Earth's vegetation and animal species became extinct forever

 In 1980, one of his studies by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Lewis Walter Alvarez, his geologist son Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Mitchell examined flaky rocks around the world and found that they had K-PG boundary The layer had a metal concentration called Iridium
 yah dhaatu prithvi kii upree satahon main kam hi milti he
 It was found that Iridium deposits were present in the K-PG range of many rocks from 30 times to 120 times on average
 is jamaavade kaa prithvi par swayan hi paidaa hone kaa koi kaaran gyaat nahin he kyunki iridium lohe kii taraf aakarshith hone vaala tatv he isliye isaki adhikansh maatra dharti ke nirmaan ke samay hi kor main maujuud lohe se aakarshith ho ke kendra main chali gai
 But similar iridium concentrations are found in many asteroids
 vaigyanikon ne purna vishwa kii ke-piji seemaa main based hue iridium kii maatra kaa anumaan lagaate hue hisaab lagaaya ki use prithvi par laane ke liye prahaar karne vaala kshudragrah kam-se-kam 10 kimi kaa rahaa hoga or uske prahaar ne 10 nil ton tianti ke jor kaa visphot kiya hoga
 This is 20 lakh times more powerful than the explosion of the most powerful hydrogen bomb ever made by humans
 alvarez ke dhoomaketu kii takkar vaale is siddhant ke saboot is baat se bhi sahi prathit hote hai ki condrite, ulka pind or kshudragrahon main milane vaale iridium kii baari maatra jo ki lagbhag ~455 ansh prati arab he dharti kii upari paraton main milane vaale ~0
3 ansh prati arab se kahin zyada he
 The isotopic anomalies of chromium found in the k – Pg boundary layer are similar to those of asteroids and meteorites made of carbonaceous chondrites
 Shocked quartz ke kan, tektite shishe kii goliyaan jo ki takkar ko ingit karte hai bhi ke-piji seemaa main baari maatra main paae jate hai, khaskar carabian dwipon ke aasapaas
 All of this is contained and intertwined in a layer of soil that Alvarez and colleagues have considered to be debris spread by this fierce collision around the world

 Shia is a Muslim sect
 sunni sampradaay ke baad yah islam kaa doosraa sabase bada sampradaay he jo puri muslim aabaadi kaa keval 15% he
 After the death of Hazrat Muhammad in 632, the people who chose Hazrat Ali as their Imam and Khalifa in their spirit were called Shiyane Ali who are now called Shias
 lekin bahot se sunni inhen "shiya" yaa "shiyane ali" nahin balki "rafazi" naam se bulaate hai ! According to this religious ideology, Hazrat Ali, who was both a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad Saheb, was the real heir of Hazrat Muhammad Saheb and should have become the first Khalifa
 yadhyapi aisa hua nahin or unako teen or logon ke baad caliph, yani pradhan netaa, banaaya gaya
 Ali and then his descendants should have become the chief of Islam, a Shia who believes so
 sunni musalmaan maanate hai ki hazarat ali sahit pehle chaar khaliph satpathi the jabaki shiya musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki pehle teen khaliph islam ke gaiyr-vaazib pradhan the or ve hazarat ali se hi imaamon kii ginati aarambh karte hai or is ginati main caliph shabd kaa prayog nahin karte
 Sunni Muslims also consider Ali as the Khalifa and Khalifa Yajid, who killed his son Hussain, is called a misguided Muslim in many places
 is sampradaay ke anuyaayiyon kaa bahumat mukhya rup se iraan,iraq,bahrain or azarbaijan main rahete hai
 Apart from this, Syria, Kuwait, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Oman, Yemen and India also have Shia population as a major minority
 shiya islam ke vishwaas ke teen upkhand hai - barahwaree, ismaili or zadi
 In a famous hadith Munkunto Maula Fah Ja Ali Un Maula, which Muhammad Sahab had opened on his last hajj at a place called Ghadir, the Muslim community had to follow the community's dictum
 san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 According to Shia beliefs, Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan i
e
 Hashim Ali wanted to make Khalifa only
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 umr ke baad tisare khaliph osman bane
 But during his time, the Shia Rafazi rebels came from Egypt and Iraq and other places in Medina and surrounded Osman's house for 40 days and finally besieged Usman's house
 osman bin afphan ko jab shahid kiya gaya tab unki umr 79 thi, unhen sar main baar baar waar kar ke maaraa gaya unki patni unako bachaane bich aayi isse unki oongali cat gayi, baghi unke ghar main peeche kii taraf se andar aaye ,saamne ke taraf hazarat ali ke donon bete hossain ibne ali or hasan ibne ali ,rakhwali kar rahe the ! The Caliphate was now vacant again and the Islamic empire was growing
 musalamaanon ko hazarat ali ke alaava koi na dikhaa par ali khaliph banane ko na maane
 On some days the people of Shura could not fill the post of Khalifa
 ant main ali ko vivash kiya gaya to aap ne kaha ki mere khilaafat main ilaahi nizaam chalegaa
 He was appointed the fourth Khalifa
 ali apane insaaf ke liye mashhoor the ,ali ke khalipha banane par purv khalipha osman ke kaatilo kaa badla lene or unako sajaa dene kii maang uthne lagi lekin vakht or musalamaanon ke halaat dekh kar ali ne us vakht koi kadam nahin uthaaya par logo ko ye na raas aayaa to unhone osman ke kaatilo ko sajaa dilwane ke fouz ikkthi kii
 Ali said Usman's Katillo would be punished, but his purpose was something else, so there was a war called Jamal
 kuch samay baad syria ke soobedaar muavia ne bhi ali kaa virodh kiya
 Mu'awiya was a relative of the third Khalifa Usman and the demand for the punishment of Katilo of the same Usman led to a battle in Siffin, in which Mu'awiya also lost
 san 661 main kufa main ek masjid main imam ali ko dhoke se shahid kar diya gaya
 After this Mu'awiya declared himself the Caliph of Islam
 hazarat ali or saidhantik rup se mohammad satho sahab ke rishtedaaron ke samarthakon ne unke putr hasan ke prati nishtha dikhaai, lekin kuch unka saath chhod gaye
 Hasan Ibne Ali did not fight, but made a treaty with Mawiya
 asal main ali ke samay main sifphine kii ladaai main maavia khalipha bananaa chahta the par na ban sakaa
 He was the governor of Syria because of the previous caliphs, now he was preparing a large army, now he put the same question in front of Imam Hasan: either war or subjugation
 imam hasan ne adheenta sweekaar nahin kii parantu wo musalamaanon kaa khun bhi nahin bahaanaa chaahate the is kaaran wo yuddh se dur rahe
 Now even if Mavia wanted power in any way, Imam was forced to make a treaty with Hassan
 imam hasan ne apni sharto par usko sirf satta saunpi
 Some of these conditions are: is prakaar kii sharto ke dwaara wo sirf naam maatr kaa shaasha rah gaya
 His dynasty ruled until 750 CE and was called Umayyad
 shiya musalamaanon kii sabhi taharik hazrat mohammad sahab ke baad ali ke chote putr va unki 11 putron ko silsilewar santaanon ko islam kaa uttaradhikari maanate hai
 The first of these comes the name of Imam Hasan Alyssalam, you were the eldest son of Imam Ali, and you followed Khilafat at the age of 47 after Imam Ali
 aap keval 6 maah tak hi khalipha rahe jiske paashchaat aapane mavia se sandhi ke pashchaat rajnatik shashan se tyaag patr de diya magar aap apane anuniyao kaa maarg darshan imam ke sammanit pad ke antargat karte rahe jo aapke paas imam ali acco ke pashchaat aayaa tha
 According to Shia history, Mavia conspired and killed you
 aapke vasiyat ke anusaar aapke pashchaat imam hossain ne aapke pashchaat imam ke pad ko sambhala
 Great story of Karbala is related to you
 aapane jab mavia ke duraachaari putr yajid kaa samarthan karne se jab spasht rup se manaa kar diya tab aapako apane parivaar evam mitron sahit, jo kul 72 kii sankhya main the, 30,000 yaa adhik kii fouj dwaara gher kar shahid kar diya gaya
 Water was closed for 3 days before you and your family
 isi kii yaad main har saal aapke anuyaayi muharram kaa vishwa prasiddh evam pavitra tyohaar manaate he
 In this festival, religious meetings and mourning meetings etc
 are organized

 Rasul Khuda Silli Allah alaihi ala wasallam has also pointed towards the same thing: namaaz or haj-o-tawaaf ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya gaya he taaki zikr khuda muhaqqiq ho sake Shaheed Mahirab, Imam Mutqeen Hazrat Ali Alaihi Assalam falsaf-e-namaz, narrates this: kudaavand alam ne namaaz ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya he taaki insaan takbbur se paak-o-pakiza ho jaenmaz ke zariye khuda se qareeb ho jaao

 More than God, who has done righteousness and favor with us, more than this, the right to be paid and decorated for Venus
 insaani vazif or hamaari abil-o-vajadaan hamaare upar laazim qaraar detii hai ki ham us kii in nimaton kaa shukr adaa karen or un nekiyon ke shukrana main uski ibaadat karen or namaaz adaa karen

 namaaz khuda kii shukraguzari he or sahib vajadaan insaan namaaz ke vaazib hone ko druk karata he

 a Personal Navigation Assistant also known as Personal Navigation Device or Portable Navigation Device is a portable electronic product which combines a positioning capability and navigation functions
 Some PNA devices are pdas with limited features and can be unlocked
 The earliest pnas were hand-held GPS units which were capable of displaying the user's location on an electronic map
 These units included simple navigation functions such as course-to-steer and course-made-good
 This first generation of pnas were used by the US military
 According to the analyst firm Berg Insight, there were more than 150 million turn-by-turn navigation systems worldwide in mid-2009, including about 35 million factory installed and aftermarket in-dash navigation systems, over 90 million personal navigation devices and an estimated 28 million navigation-enabled mobile handsets with GPS
 The term PNA has come into widespread use with the growing popularity of automobile navigation systems
 The latest generation of PNA have sophisticated navigation functions and feature a variety of user interfaces including maps, turn-by-turn guidance and voice instructions
 To reduce total cost of ownership and time to market, most modern PNA devices such as those made by Garmin Ltd
, Mio Technology Ltd
 or tomtom International BV
 are running an off-the-shelf embedded operating system such as Windows CE or Embedded Linux on commodity hardware with OEM versions of popular PDA Navigation software packages such as tomtom Navigator, I-GO 2006, Netropa intellinav iguidance, or Destinator
 Other manufacturers like Garmin and Magellan prefer to bundle their own software developed in-house
 Because many of these devices use an embedded OS, many technically inclined users find it easy to modify pnas to run third party software and use them for things other than navigation, such as a low-cost audio-video player or PDA replacement
 Meantime, Nokia, Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other handset makers will sell 162 million GPS equipped phones in 2007, dwarfing the 20 million units Garmin and tomtom have forecast they will sell combined, according to isuppli, a leading market researcher in California
 The inclusion of Google Maps Navigation in Android devices such as Motorola Droid and Nokia's announcement of free Ovi Maps lead to many people using their smartphones instead of having a separate PNA for trip navigation

 Similar to the Richter scale, it is also a logarithmic perimeter, that is, an earthquake of one unit increase is √1000 or 31
6 times more powerful than the earthquake of the previous unit: for example, an earthquake of 5 magnitude is thirty times more powerful than an earthquake of 4 magnitude
 And an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 will be about 1000 times more powerful than a 4 one and an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 will be 31,555 times more powerful than a 4 one
