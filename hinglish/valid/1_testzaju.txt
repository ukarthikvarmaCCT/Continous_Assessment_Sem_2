 vaidyanath mandir, devgarh dwadash jyotirling main ek jyotirling kaa puranakalin mandir he jo bharatvarsh ke rajya jharkhand main atiprasiddh devgarh naamak sthaan par avasthit he
 Being a holy pilgrimage, people also call it Vaidyanath Dham

 yah jyotirling ek siddhapitha he
 It is said that all the wishes of those who come here are fulfilled
 is kaaran is ling ko "kaamana ling" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 The history of the establishment of this linga is that once Rakshasraj Ravana went to the Himalayas to perform austerities for the happiness of Shiva and started cutting his head and offering it to Shivalinga
 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon
 ravan ne lanka main jaakar us ling ko sthapit karne ke liye use le jane kii ajna maangi
 Shivji gave permission, but with the warning that if he puts it on the road, he will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling
 shivaji kaa darshan hote hi sabhi devi devataaon ne shivlinga kii vahiin usee sthaan par pratisthapana kar di or shiv-stuti karte hue waapas swarg ko chale gayi
 According to public opinion and popular belief, this vaidyanath-jyotirlinga is going to give desired results

 It is said that Ravana used to protect his kingdom Lanka from Panchshul
 chunki vaidyanath jyotirling ko lanka le jane ke liye kailash se ravan hi lekar aayaa tha par vidhaataa ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd
 yahan prativarsh mahashivaratri se 2 dinon purv baba mandir, maan parvati va lakshmi-narayan ke mandiron se panchashul utaare jate hai
