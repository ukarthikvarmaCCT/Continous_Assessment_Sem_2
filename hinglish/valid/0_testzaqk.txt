 Maurice Louré, the joint director of the French tax authority, Direction générale des impôts was the first to introduce VAT on 10 April 1954, although the concept was proposed in 1918 by German industrialist Dr
 Wilhelm von Siemens
 shuru main bade paimaane ke kaarobaaron par lakshyit, samay ke saath sabhi vyavsaayik kshetron ko shaamil karne ke liye iskaa vistaar kiya gaya
 In France, it is the most important source of finance for the country, contributing 52% of the country's revenue
 utpaadon or sevaaon ke nijee antim upabhokta, kharid par waite ko vasuul nahin sakate, lekin udyog un maal or sevaaon par jinhen ve aage kii aapurti yaa seva pradaan karne ke liye kharidte hai, jise sidhe yaa paroksh rup se antim upyogkarta ko bechaa jayega, waite ko vasuul sakate hai
 In this way, the total tax levied at each level in the economic chain of supply is a constant fraction of the value that a business adds to its products and much of the cost of tax collection is borne by the business rather than the state
 waite kaa avishkaar isliye kiya gaya kyonki bahut adhik bikri karon or shulkon ne dhokhadhadi or taskari ko protsaahit kiya
 Critics say this leads to an inconsistent tax burden on middle-class and low-income households
 mulya yojit kar, utpaadan ke har charan main yojit mulya par kar laga kar bikri kar ke sopan asar se bachaata he
 Value-added taxation is being preferred worldwide instead of the traditional sales tax
 siddhant rup main, mulya yojit kar un sabhi vanijyik gatividhiyon par lagu hote hai jisamen maal kaa utpaadan or vitaran tathaa sevaaon kaa praavdhaan shaamil hota he
 In each transaction of a business, VAT is evaluated and collected on the value added to the goods
 is avadharana ke tahat sarkaar ko prayek lenden ke sakal margin par kar diya jaataa he
 In many developing countries like India, sales tax / VAT is an important revenue source as high unemployment and low per capita income make other income sources inadequate
 haalanki, kai up-rashtriya sarkaron dwaara iskaa virodh hota he chunki isse unke dwaara ekatrit kul rajasav sangrah main kami hoti he saath hi saath swaittata kaa kuch nuksaan bhi hota he
 Sales taxes are usually levied only on final sales to consumers: because of reimbursement, VAT has the same overall economic impact on final prices
 mukhya antar, sirf atirikt lekhankan kaa he jise un logon dwaara karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aapurti shrinkhalaa ke bich main aate hai, waite kii is kami ko, utpaadan shrinkhalaa ke prayek sadsy par, unki or graahakon kii is shrinkhalaa main sthiti ko dhyaan naa dekar or unki sthiti kii jaanch karne or pramanit karne ke prayaas ko khatm kar, samaan kar ke prayog dwaara santulit kiya jaataa he
 When there is some exemption in the VAT system, if any, as with GST in New Zealand, it becomes even easier to pay VAT
 ek saamaanya aarthik vichaar yah he ki yadi bikri kar 10% se adhik ho jaataa he to log bade paimaane par karapavanchan gatividhiyon main lipt ho jate hai 
 The total VAT rate, on the other hand, may exceed 10% without extensive evasion due to innovative collection systems
 tathaapi, kyonki apane sangrah kii vishesh vyavastha ke kaaran, waite kaaphi aasaani se vishisht dhokhadhadi kaa nishaanaa ban jaati he jaise carozal frod jo rajyon ke liye kar aamadani main kami ke maamle main bahut mahangaa ho saktaa he
 The standard method for applying VAT is the principle that a business retains a percentage of the product minus the price previously paid
 yadi waite dar 10% he, to ek santare kaa ras nirmaataa prati galen keemat £5 ke 10% ko santare ke kisaan dwaara purv main bhugtan kiye gaye kar se gata kar degaa 
 In this example, the orange juice producer would have a £ 0
30 tax liability
 prayek vyavsaay ke aapurtikartaaon ke liye apane karon kaa bhugtan karne ke liye ek majboot protsaahan hota he, jisase ek khudara bikri kar kii tulana main waite dar, kam kar chori ke saath oonchi ho jaati he
 Behind this simple principle are variations in its implementation, as discussed in the next section
 sangrah kii paddati se, waite lekha aadhaarit yaa bijak aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Under the invoice method of collection, each seller imposes a VAT rate on their product and gives the buyer a special invoice indicating the amount of tax levied
 kharidaar jo apni bikri par waite ke daayre main hai, in bijkon kaa prayog waite kii apni dendaree ke prati ek credit praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 The difference between the tax shown on the invoice passed and the invoice received is then passed on to the government
 lekha aadhaarit tareeke main, aisa koi vishesh bijak prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the tax is calculated at the value added, which is measured as a difference between revenue and allowable purchases
 adhikansh deshon main aaj bijak vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ekmaatr apwaad he japan jahaan lekha paddati kaa upyog karata he
 By the time of collection, VAT can be either accrual or cash based
 nakad aadhaarit lekhankan, lekhankan kaa ek bahut hi saral rup he
 When a payment is received for the sale of an item or service, an accumulation is made and the revenue is recorded at the date of receipt of the funds - no matter when the sale was made
 check tab likhe jate hai jab bill dene ke liye dhan uplabdh ho or vyay ko check kii taarikh main darj kiya jaataa he - isaki bina parvaah kiye ki kharch kab kiya gaya
 The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank and the secondary focus is on ensuring that all bills have been paid
 rajasav ko us samay avadhi ke saath jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya, tulana karne main adhik prayaas nahin kiya jaataa, yaa kharchon ko us avadhi se milan karne main jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Accrual based accounting matches the revenue from the period when they were earned and the expenses for the period when they were incurred
 haalanki yah nakadi aadhaarit lekhankan se zyada jatil he, yah aapke vyavsaay ke bare main adhik jaankaree pradaan karata he
 The accrual basis enables you to track receivables and payables
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako unhen kamaane main kiye gaye vyay ke liye rajasav ke milan main madad karata he, aapako or adhik sarthak vittiya report detaa he
 Consider the manufacture and sale of any item, which we would call a widget in this case
 ek 10% bikri kar ke saath: Hence the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount
 khudara vikreta ne tex main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa or khudara vikritaon ko atirikt kagaji karrwai kerani hoti he taaki unke dwaara ikattha kiye gaye bikri kar ko sahi dhang se sarkaar tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 Suppliers and manufacturers have the administrative burden of supplying the right certificate and checking that their customers are not consumers
 10% waite ke saath: That is, the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount in taxation
 kaarobaar ne kar main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa
 They do not require a request for a certificate from buyers who are not end users, but they will have to do additional accounting so that they can correctly differentiate between the government, what they collected from VAT and what they spent in VAT
 Can give dhyaan den ki prayek maamle main pradutt waite, laabh yaa yojit mulya ke 10% ke baraabar he
 The advantage of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that the industry cannot hide consumption, proving that it is not a consumer
 uparokt udhaaharan main, hamane mana ki kar kii shuruuaat se pehle or baad main vijet kii utani hi sankhya main nirmaan hua or bikri hui
 This is not true in real life

 keemat main badhotaree se yaa to maang vakr baayi taraf jaataa he, yaa aapurti vakr upar kii taraf

 As a result, the quantity of goods purchased decreases and / or the price it is sold increases
 upar ke udhaaharan main aapurti or maang kaa yah badlaav shaamil nahin he, saralata ke liye or kyonki ye prabhaav har prakaar kii vastu ke liye bhinn hai
 The above example assumes that the tax is non-distortable

 Because the price for someone increases, the quantity of goods decreases
 tadnusaar, kuch log adhik dwaara badtar ho jate hai jahaan sarkaar kar kii aay se behatar ho jaati he
 That is, the supply and demand change leads to a far greater loss than the tax benefits
 ise dedwet haani ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Income lost by the economy is higher than government income; Tax is disabled
 sarkaar kii aay kii puri raashi ho saktaa he ek dedwet draig naa ho, agar kar rajasav ko laabhadaayak kharch ke liye istemaal kiya jaay yaa sakaaratmak bahyata ho - duusare shabdon main, sarkarein bas kar aay kaa upbhog karne kii bajaay kahin adhik kuch kar saktin hai
 While distortions occur, consumption taxes, such as VAT, are often considered better because they distort incentives to investment, saving and working less than most other forms of taxation - in other words, rather than producing a VAT Discourages consumption
 upar chitra main, The "value added tax" has been criticized since its burden depends on consumers of personal end products and is therefore a regressive tax, although it should be understood that all company taxes ultimately arrive as a tax on consumers
 bachaav pakshon kaa daawa he ki aay ke madhyam se karadhaan ko nikaal dena ek manamaana maanak he or mulya yojit kar vastav main ek anupatik kar he or isamen adhik aamadani vaale log adhik bhugtan karte hai usee dar par jis par ve khapat adhik karte hai
 Both measurements make VAT more regressive than making it a progressive income tax
 ek waite pranali kaa prabhavi pratigaami gun, bad bhi saktaa he kyonki maal ke vibhinn virgon par alag-alag daron se kar lagaae jate hai
 Therefore VAT is mostly a flat tax and in practice can be regressive
 ek mulya yojit kar se praapt rajasav aksar apeksha se kam hote hai kyonki ve kathin hai or unka prabandhan or sangrah karnaa mahangaa hota he
 In many countries, where collection of personal income tax and corporate profit tax has historically been weak, VAT collection has been more successful than other taxes
 waite kai kshetradhikaron main or adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he chunki vyapaar udaarikaran ke kaaran tarriff str duniya bhar main gira he or anivaary rup se waite ne khoye hue tarriff rajasav ko pratisthapit kiya he
 The distortion of cost and value-added tax is less than the high import duty of economic inefficiencies and enforcement issues, it is disputed, but by principle value-added taxes are far more effective
 kuch udyogon main waite kaa adhik parihaar paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se jahaan nakad lenden prabal hota he or ise badhaava dene ke liye waite kii aalochana kii ja sakati he
 From the government's point of view, however, VAT may be better because it can hold at least some value additions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek badhai nakadi ke liye ek grihaswami ko, jo aamtaur par ek input waite kaa waapas daawa nahin kar saktaa, sevaayen uplabdh kara saktaa he 
 Therefore the homeowner will incur lower costs and the carpenter may avoid other taxes
 sarkaar ko, tathaapi, abhi bhi kai anya input ke liye jo badhai ko bechaa gaya he waite praapt hoga or badhai in input par waite ko punah praapt karne main asamarth hoga
 While the total income will be lower than that of full compliance, it will not be less than the income under the other probable taxation system

 VAT that is levied by a business and paid by its customers is called "output VAT"
 praapt aapurtiyon par ek vyavsaay dwaara anya vyavsaayon ko diya jane vaala waite "input waite" kehalaata he, 
 Typically an industry can recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT can be declined at its taxable output
 input waite ko output waite ke vipareet sthapit karke vasula jaataa he jiske liye vyavsaay kaa sarkaar ke khate main hona aavashyaktaa he, yaa, agar vahaan ek aadhiky he, to sarkaar se ek chukauti kaa daawa karte hue
 According to the VAT Directive, some goods and services should be exempt from VAT and some other goods and services should be exempt from VAT but the option of VAT on those supplies should be subject to an EU member state

 On the other hand, the introduction of VAT would result in a revenue deficit for states and a reduction in their autonomy with greater centralization
 " chanchal kumaar sharma jor dekar kehete hai: "raajnneetik majaburiyon ne sarkaar ko waite kaa ek asangat model pesh karne ke liye prerit kiya" 'bhartiya waite pranali apurna' he, is had tak ki yah 'waite ke mul siddhanton ke khilaaf jaati he'

Is there a mathematical model or model that can give credit returns to value added tax and which can reduce the percentage of credit returns? There are no ready answers to these questions

 Blood electrolytes may be important in severe forms of meningitis; for example hypnotemia is a common bacterial meningitis due to a combination of several factors including dehydration, improper excretion of antidiuretic hormone, or additional active intravenous fluid administration
 aam taur par ek vyakti ko ek karavat main lita kar, cerebral taral ekatra karne ke liye local anaesthesia laga kar or dural sac main ek sui daal kar lumber panchar kiya jaataa he
 When this is achieved, csf's "opening pressure" is measured using a manometer

 Therefore, professional guidelines recommend that dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid be given immediately before the first dose of the first antibiotics and continue for four days
 aisa karne se neumokocal mastishk fever se peedit logo tak hi upachaar ke laabh simit rahete hai, kuch dishanirdesh suzav dete hai ki dexamethason ko tab roak diya janaa chaiye yadi mastishk fever ke liye anya kaaran pahachaane jaayen
 The possible mechanism is suppression of hyperactive inflammation
 vayaskon kii apeksha bacchon main sahaayak corticosteroid kii bhinn bhoomika he
 Although the benefits of corticosteroids appear in adults and children in high-income countries, the evidence on its use on children in low-income countries is not supported; The reason for this difference is not clear

 Her name by birth is Neelanjana Sudeshna and according to her both these are her "good names", but she is known only by her surname Jhumpa
 lahidi, america ke raashtrapati baraak obama dwaara kala or maanviyata par raashtrapati kii samiti kii sadasya niyukt kii gayi hai
 Lahiri was born in London, she is the daughter of an immigrant Bengali Indian family
 jab ve teen varsh kii thim to unka parivaar sanyukt rajya america main sthanantarit ho gaya; lahidi khud ko america maanati hai or unka kahana he, "main yahaan paidaa nahin hui lekin aisa ho bhi saktaa tha

 jab unhone kingston, road island main balwari janaa shuru kiya tab unki shikshak ne unhen unke upnaam jhumpa se bulaane kaa faisla kiya, kyonki unke asli naam ke mukaable iskaa uccharan karnaa aasaan tha
 Lahiri recalls, "I was always very embarrassed by my name
 


 aapako aisa lagata he ki aap jo hai vah bane rahakar kisi or ke liye dard kaa kaaran ban rahe hai
 "lahiri's duality on his identity is the inspiration for the duality of his novel The Namesake's protagonist Gogol due to his unusual name
 lahidi ne south kingstown hai skool se snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii or unhone 1989 main barnard college se angreji sahitya main bi

 lahidi, brukaleen neuyork main apane pati or do bacchon ke saath rahati he, jinka naam he octavio or nur 
 Lahiri's earlier short stories faced rejection from publishers for "years"
 His first short story collection, Interpreter of Maldies, was finally released in 1999
 yah kahaniyaan bhartiya yaa bhartiya pravaasiyon ke jivan main samvedansheel duvidhaon jaise vaivaahik kathinaaiyon, garbhpaat or pehali or duusari peedi ke sanyukt rajya america ke pravaasiyon ke bich asampark jaise vishyon ko sambodhit karti hai
 Lahiri later wrote, "when i first started writing, i didn't know that my subject was an indian-american experience
 jis chiz ne mujhe is shilp kii ore aakarshith kiya vah tha mere andar kii donon duniya ko ek hi panne par utaarne kii ichha, jise vaastavik jivan main karne kaa naa to mujhamen saahas he or naa hi paripakvata
" yah sangrah america aalochakon dwaara saraahaa gaya, lekin bharat main ise mili-juli samikshaayen praapt hui, jahaan vaikalpik rup se sameekshak utsahit bhi the or saath hi vikshubdh bhi the kyonki lahidi ne "bharatiyon ko ek adhik sakaaratmak bhoomika main nahin rachaa
 "interpreter of Maldies sold 600,000 copies and received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2003 main, lahidi ne apana pehla upanyaas di nemsek prakashit karaayaa
 yah kahani ganguli parivaar ke jivan ke tees varshon se bhi adhik samay main buni gayi he
 Calcutta-born parents settle in the United States as young adults, where their children, Gogol and Sonia, grow up with their parents experiencing constant generational and cultural differences

 Lahiri's second collection of short stories, Unaccompanied Earth was released on 1 April 2008
 prakashit hone par anekstomd arth ne di neuyork times kii sarvshereshth vikreta suchi par number 1 par shuruyaat kii
 neuyork times ke pustak samiksha sampadak, dwite garnor ne kaha, "yah yaad karnaa mushkil he ki aakhri baar kab koi vastav main gambhir, acchhee tarah se likhit katha - vishesh rup se kahaniyon kii kitaab ai thi - jo sidhe number 1 par pahunch gayi; yah lahidi ke nae vanijyik prabhaav kaa pradarshan he
 " lahidi kaa di new yorker patrika ke saath bhi visisth sambandh tha jisamen unki kai laghu kathaayen prakashit hui, jiname se adhikansh kaalpanik or kuch akaalpanik thi jisamen shaamil thi di laung ve home; kooking lesans, yah kahani lahidi or unki maa ke bich ke sambandh main khaane ke mahatv ke vishay main thi
 Since 2005, Lahiri Penn has become the vice president of the American Center, an organization created to foster friendship and intellectual collaboration among writers
 farvari 2010 main, paanch anya logo ke saath unhen maanavtaa or kala sambandhi samiti kaa sadsy niyukt kiya gaya
 Lahiri's writing is characterized by his "simple" language and his characters, who are often Indian immigrants living in the US, who have to reconcile the cultural values of their birthplace and the adopted home
 lahidi ke upanyaas aatmakathaatmak hote hai or yah aksar unke apane or saath hi saath unke mata pita, mitron, parichiton or bengali samudaay ke anya logon ke tajurbon par aadhaarit hota he jinase ve parichit hai
 Lahiri examines the struggles, concerns and prejudices of her characters so that the immigrant can compose the details and details of psychology and behavior
 anekstamd arth tak unhone adhiktar pehali peedi ke bhartiya america apravasiyon par or apane desh se bhinn ek desh main apane parivaar ko paalane ke liye unke sangharsh par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In their stories they grow up to make their children aware of Indian culture and traditions and to keep them connected with the Indian tradition of joint family, in which parents, their children and the family of children live under the same roof
 Even after she describes his efforts to keep her close to him
 anekstamd arth, purv kii is mul prakruti se dur he kyonki isamen lahidi ke paatr vikaas ke nae daur main kadam rakhte hai
 These stories seek the fate of the second and third generations
 jaise-jaise baad kii peediyaan america samskruti ko badhate paimaane par aatmsaat karne lagati hai or aaraam se apane mul desh se baahar apana drushtikon banane lagati hai, lahidi kii kahaniyaan un ligon ke vyaktigat aavashyaktaaon par sthanantarit ho jaati he
 They show how later generations had drifted away from the shackles of their immigrant parents, often devoted to their responsibility to their community and to other immigrants

 Mudrarakshas is a historical drama in Sanskrit composed by Visakhadatta
 isaki rachana chauthi shatabdi main hui thi
 In this, an unprecedented analysis of Chanakya's political successes based on the famous circle related to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya is found
 is kriti kii rachana purvavarti sanskrit-natya parampara se sarvatha bhinn rup main hui he- lekhak ne bhavukta, kalpana aadi ke sthaan par jivan-sangharsh ke yatharth ankan par bal diya he
 Bharatendu Harishchandra has the credit for first translating this important drama into Hindi
 yon unke baad kuch anya lekhakon ne bhi is kriti kaa anuwaad kiya, kintu jo khyaati bhaaratendu harishchandra ke anuwaad ko praapt hui, vah kisi anya ko nahin mil saki
 It presents a beautiful fusion of history and politics
 isamen nandavansh ke naash, chandragupta ke rajarohan, rakshas ke sakriy virodh, chanakya kii raajnneeti vishyak sajagata or antatah rakshas dwaara chandragupta ke prabhutv kii sweekruti kaa ullekh hua he
 In this, there is Manikanchan Yoga of elements of literature and politics, which is probably because Visakhadatta was born in Rajkula
 ve samant bateshwardutt ke pautra or maharaj pruthu ke putr the
 According to some copies of 'mudrarakshas', he was the son of Maharaja Bhaskaradatta
 is naatak ke rachana-kaal ke vishay main teevr matbhed hai, adhikansh viddhan ise chauthi-paanchavi shatee kii rachana maanate hai, kintu kuch ne ise saatvin-aathvin shatee kii kriti mana he
 Like Sanskrit, the story of Mudrarakshas has gained popularity in Hindi too, thanks to Bharatendu Harishchandra
 vishakhdutt athwa vishakhdev kaa kaal-nirnay abhi nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, he was a later playwright of Bhasa, Kalidasa, Harsha and Bhavabhuti and the play presented was supposedly composed between the sixth to the ninth century
 samant vateshwardutt ke pautra or maharaj pruthu athwa bhaskaradatt ke putr hone ke naate unka raajnneeti se pratyaksh sambandh tha, faltah ‘mudrarakshas’ kaa raajnneetipradhan naatak hona aakasmik sanyog nahin he, varan isamen lekhak kii ruchi bhi pratifalit he
 Two other works of Visakhadatta - Devi Chandragupta, and Raghavanand Natakam - are also mentioned, but the base of his fame is 'mudrarakshas'
 ‘devi chandraguptam’ kaa ullekh ramachandra-gunchandra ne ‘natyadarpan’ main, bhoj ne ‘shringarprakash’ main or abhinavgupt ne ‘naatakashastra’ kii tikaa main kiya he
 The play is based on the historical circle of Dhruvadevi and Chandragupta II, but only a fraction of it has been received
 ‘raghavanand naatakam’ kii rachana ram-charitra ko lekar kii gai hogi, kintu iske bhi ek-do sfoot chand hi praapt hue hai
 'mudrarakshas' has been composed in a completely different form from the earlier sanskrit-natyaparampara
 vaise, vishakhdutt bhartiya naatayashastra se suparichit the or isi kaaran unhen ‘mudrarakshas’ main ‘kaary’ kii ekta kaa nirvaah karne main adbhut safalataa praapt hui he, yadhyapi ghatana-kam kii vyapaktaa ko dekhte hue yah uplabdhi sandigdh ho sakati thi
 But he was not even sure to follow the norms set by the earlier writers
 isiilie unhone bhavukta, kalpana aadi ke aashray dwaara kathanak ko atirikt jivan-sangharsh main praapt hone vaali safalataa-asafalataa kaa yatharthamulak chithran kiya he
 He has provided a pure historical background to the plot, his emphasis is not on romantic elements
 abhijatyavaadee drushtikon na keval katha-sangyojan or charitra-chatrin main drushtigat hota he, apitu unki suspasht tathaa shashakt pad-rachana bhi isi pravriti kii dein he
 It is also notable in this context that just as the practice of Kalidasa's work would be incomplete in the absence of Mallinath's interpretations, Dhundiraj's commentary on 'mudrarakshas' is also famous
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kii kathavstu prakhyat he
 The basis of the naming of this drama is this event - the monster is shocked or compelled to see his posture being used against himself
 isamen chandragupta ke rajarohan ke uparant chanakya dwaara rakshas kii raajnneetik chaalon ko vifal kar dene kii katha ko saat ankon main sucharu rup main vyakt kiya gaya he
 The playwright has introduced the plans of Chanakya and Rakshasa with full political credentials
 unhone naatakagat ghatnakam ke aayojan main swaabhaaviktaa, jigyaasa or rochakata kii ore upyukt dhyaan diya he
 The play provides interesting details of what measures were taken by the then politicians for the operation of the monarchy
 chanakya ke sahaayakon ne ruchi-aruchi athwa swatantra ichha-shakti kii chintaa na karte hue apane liye nirdisht kaaryon kaa jis tatparta se nirvaah kiya, vah kaary sambandhi ekta kaa uttam udhaaharan he
 The serialization of events is an admirable quality of this drama, because nowhere in the scheme of conspiracy-repellents is violence targeted
 yadhyapi chanakya kii kutil chaalon kaa varnan hone se iskaa kathanak jatil he, kintu naatakkaar ne ise purvapar kram-samanvit rakhane main adbhut safalataa praapt kii he
 In this, theatrical use of practices, semantics, treaties and vrittis has been done
 bhartiya aacharyon ne naatak ne katha-vikaas kii paanch avasthaaen maani hai - prarambh, praytn, praptyasha, niyatapti, falaagam
 The beginning of the play should be interesting and well planned, because the success of subsequent events of the play depends on it
 ‘mudrarakshas’ main nipunak dwaara chanakya ko rakshas kii mudra dene tak kii katha ‘prarambh’ ke antargat aegi
 These 'events' can be included under the 'attempt' stage - Chanakya's attempt to make the demon and Malayketu exorcise, the false conduct of crucifixion of Shaktadasa, betraying the demon by Siddhartha, etc
 ’praptyasha’ kii yojana ke liye naatakkaar ne chandragupta or chanakya ke chhadam virodh, rakshas dwaara kusumpur par akraman kii yojana aadi ghatnaon dwaara rakshas kaa utkarsh varnit kiya he, kintu saath hi kootneetijna chanakya kii yojanaon kaa bhi varnan hua he
 The events of Chanakya's confession of the demon and Malayaketu and thwarting the demon's plans come under 'destiny'
 chathe-saatven ankon main ‘falaagam’ kii siddhi ke liye rakshas ke aatm- samarpan kii prishthbhumi prastut karte hue uske dwaara chandragupta ke amaatya-pad kii sweekruti kaa ullekh hua he
 The manner in which the narrator has described these conditions more and more cleanly is praiseworthy
 kathanak ke samyak vikaas ke liye bhartiya aacharyon ne karyavasthaon kii bhanti paanch arth-prakrutiyaan bhi nirdhaarit kii hai - beej, bindu, pataakaa, prakari, kaary
 Out of these, the main relevant story is presented under 'pataka' and 'prakari' means the inclusion of secondary relevant stories
 kintu, kathanak ke samyak vikaas ke liye praasangik kathaon or aadhikarik katha kaa santulit nirvaah aavashyak he
 In 'mudrarakshas', Chanakya's decision to join the demon in his favor is the 'seed' of the story
 jisaki abhivyakti pratham ank main chanakya kii ukti main hui haih ‘‘jab tak rakshas nahin pakadaa jaataa tab tak nandon ke maarane se kya or chandragupta ko rajya milane se hi kya ? xxrep 4

 In these translations, he has adopted the method of paraphrasing, as a result, it would be more appropriate to call it a drama
 naatak ke prastaavna, bharatvakya aadi sthalon ko unhone praayah moulik rup main prastut kiya he
 Similarly, without taking shelter from the tendency of word translation, a sufficiently independent view has been kept in characterization
 yahi kaaran he ki 'mudrarakshas' main anuwaad kii shushkta ke sthaan par moulik vichaardrushti or bhashaa-pravaah ko praayah lakshith kiya ja saktaa he
 This tendency is even more explicitly aimed at the playful passage

 In general, the ratio of the load of ocean water and the weight of dissolved substances in it is called oceanic salinity
 mahasagariya jal main upasthit lavanta ke kaaran samudr kaa jal khaaraa hota he
 ek 1 kilometre samudri jal main 4
10 karod ton lavan hota he
 is aadhaar par yadi saare jalmandal ke namak ko samtal rup se bichaaya jaae to sampurna prithvi par 150 meter moti namak kii parat ho jaaegi
 Mathematically oceanic salinity is expressed in the total amount of salts present per 1000 grams of water
 The salinity of the sea is about 35 per thousand seas, so 1000 grams of water contains about 35 grams of salt
 Earth is the main source of oceanic salinity
 The main means of collecting salts are rivers, ocean waves, winds, volcanic eruptions etc
 sagariya jal main lavan kii maatra main bhinnata pai jaati he to bhi lavenon kaa saapekshik anupaat lagbhag ek sa hi rahata he
 The lines joining places of equal salinity in oceanic regions are called symmetry lines

 In the Sargosse region of the North Atlantic Ocean, salinity is 38 per thousand
 The reason for this high salinity is that due to the cyclic flow of ocean currents, intermediate water is not able to mix with the water of other areas
 aanshik rup se ghire sagar main lavanta kaa vitaran sthanik paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he

 faras kii khadi main lavanta kii maatra 48 prati hajaar pai jaati he
 Due to lack of rain, low supply of clean water, excess of evaporation, high temperature etc
 this salinity is high

 The inner sea and the lake are completely surrounded by land
 The amount of salinity in the Dead Sea is 238 per thousand due to extremely hot and dry winds, lack of rainfall, high temperature and excess of evaporation
 In the southern part of the Caspian Sea, salinity is found to be 170 per thousand and in the northern part only 14 per thousand
 In the northern part of the Caspian Sea, the rivers Ural, Volga etc
 supply clean water
 The highest salinity in the world is 330 per thousand in Turkey's Vaughan Lake

 him ke pighale svachh jal kii aapurti hote rahane se lavanta sataha par kam rahati he
 2
 Salinity increases up to a depth of 400 meters in the middle latitudes
 Then its volume decreases with depth
 This happens because the supply of clean water on the surface is low and evaporation is high
 3
 bumadhyarekhiy kshetron main sataha par lavanta kam 1000 meter tak vruddhi tatpashchaat punah kam hoti jaati he
 The above promotions are normal
 However, different oceans are seen in different oceans
 For example, the surface salinity in the South Atlantic Ocean is 33 per thousand
 34
5 per thousand at 400 meters depth, 34
8 per thousand at 1200 meters
 But near 20 ° south latitude is 37 on the surface and 35 per thousand on the bottom
 In the equatorial part, it is 34 on the surface and 35 per thousand on the bottom
 The North Atlantic Ocean has a salinity of 35
5 at the surface and 34% at the bottom
 There is considerable variation in the distribution of salinity in partially surrounded seas

 Soon the Guru felt that his disciple was more talented and talented than him, so he gave all the knowledge that Guru had to his disciple Vinci

 Beautiful river, tree and waterfall natural scenes are seen in the background of the picture
 aisa lagata he jaise studiyon main ek vishaal khuli hui khidki ke saamne baitaakar vishay ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 In 2007, French engineer Pascal Côté announced that his ultra-high resolution scan on the picture showed that Monalisa was actually painted with eyebrows but over time these colors were gone
 unhone iske peeche atyadhik safai ko ek sambhavit vajah mana
 Based on the documents obtained from the Florence where the painting began to be made in 1503, he states that Monalisa gave birth to an infant at the end of the same year
 ek italvi va america shodhakarta dwaara florence se praapt carch ke padri dwaara shishu ke namakaran kii dharmik rasm ke dastavejon ke hawaale se is baat kii pushti kii gai he

 According to Ms
 Mike, Ishabella has a sad smile because her mother died shortly before Leonardo made the painting

 In his published book 'who is Monalisa' Insarch has drawn many similarities
 pustak main aage likhaa he ki liyanardo jo ki diu ke darbar main shahi kalakaar the, isabela ke kaaphi nikat the
 About 8 years ago, a doctor of teeth in Japan surprised everyone by saying that the secret of Monalisa's mysterious smile is the break of the two front teeth in her upper jaw and that is why her upper lip was pressed on one side
 -this is visible, that is why one of his upper lips is seen as something suppressed from one side
 yahi kaaran he ki anjaane main monaalisa va rahasyamay muskaan dikhaai detii he jab ki vastav main yah muskaraahat nahin balki apane tut chuke daanton se khaali hue sthaan ko jeebh se hothon ko thelne kaa prayaas kar rahi he jisase hoth dabaa hua na dikhe

 In an article published in the journal Art and Antics, Ms
 Lillian claimed that she was stunned to see that Leonardo and Monalisa's faces, eyes, in 1518, when she placed a self-portrait of Leonardovinchi made of red chalk and a portrait of Monalisa
 There is a wonderful similarity between cheeks, nose and hair
 computer ke madad se jab monaalisa ke chehre ke upar liyanardo ke bal, dadhi va bhavahe lagaakar dekha gaya to vah puri tarah liyanardo main parivartit ho gai
 Conversely, if Lianardo's face is removed from his beard, hair, mustache, bhava, etc
, Leonardo turns into Monalisa
 sward ji kaa kathan he ki liyanardo ne monaalisa ke rup main swayan kaa nari chithran kiya he
 He cited the homosexuality of an artist as the main reason behind it
 is baat kii prabal sambhaavna he ki vinci samalangik ho or ubhay lingi vishyon ko kalakriti main dhaalane main ruchi rakhte ho tathaa apni isi pravitti ke chalate swayan ko nari rup main chitrit kar use monaalisa naam diya
