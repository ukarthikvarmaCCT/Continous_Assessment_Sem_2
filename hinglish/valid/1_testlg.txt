 With mind, speech and deeds, he was completely immersed in Shivarchan

 vah nirantar is baat kaa praytn kiya karata tha ki us supriy kii puja-archana main vighn pahunche
 Once, Supriya was going on a boat and going somewhere

 He had full faith that my adorable Lord Shiva would definitely rid me of this disaster

 good vil hanting 1997 main bani gus vaan saint dwaara nirdeshit ek america drama film he
 In the film, along with Ben Affleck and Robin Williams, Matt Damon played the lead role of Will Hunting, a prodigal punk from South Boston who serves as a janitor at MIT

 Will Hunting is a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was a man of proficient intelligence, image-based memory, and a deep affection for mathematics
 iske baavjood, vah ek chaukeedaar ke rup main kaam karne ko chunata he or south boston ke ek jeern-sheern pados main ek aanshik rup se susajjit ghar main akele rahata he or jisamen vah apane doston chaki sulivan, billy mcbroid or morgan o'meli ke saath vakt gujaarta he

 When this was resolved quickly and anonymously, Lambyu posed a more difficult question — which took him and his colleagues two years to prove
 jab lambiyu ittaphacan vil ko board par likhte hue dekhtaa he tab vah use ek vidhvansak samaj kar vahaan se bhaga dete hai
 However, Lambu realizes that Will wrote the correct answer and they set out to find him
 is bich, vil ek karmine scorpegliya naamak dabang se badla letaa he, jo ki vil ke anusaar, varshon pehle use kindergarten main maaraa karata tha, ab vah hamale main kaarywahi karte police adhikari par hamalaa karne ke jurm main jail kii sazaa bhugatta he
 Realizing Will's vast abilities, Lambu intervenes in his place in Will's trial and puts two ways before Will: either go to jail, or study mathematics under Lambieu's personal supervision and meet a doctor
 
 vil antim vaala vikalp hi chunata he, jabaki use is baat par vishwaas nahin tha ki use chikitsa kii jarurat he
 Will contempts the first five physicians summoned by Lambu
 hataasha main, lambiyu aakhir car shaun maguwair ko bulaate hai, jo MIT main unke rummet rahe or ab ek virakt puraane mitra hai, jo vil ke pados main hi paley bade
 shaun, purv ke chikitsakon se is maamle main bhinn the ki ve vil ke khilaaf date rahete hai or antat vil kii shatrutapurna, vyangyatmak pratiraksha style ko kaabo karne main sakasham hote hai
 Despite a disastrous first meeting that ends with Will pushing and threatening Sean after Will insults his wife, Sean refuses to give up and after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally opens up with him
 looks like
 vil khaskar tab dang rah gaya jab shaun ne use bataaya ki kaise vah 1975 ke world series ke chathe khel main boston red fox kaa khel dekhne ke liye kharidi gai tikat keval isliye de detaa he taaki vah ek baar main ek ajanabi se mil sake or baat kar sake, jo aage chal kar uski patni banati he
 This encourages Will to establish a relationship with Skylar, a young Englishwoman whom he had previously met at a bar near Harvard University, where she is a final-year student and - soon to graduate
 Will go yah doctor-rogi kaa rishta, haalanki, ek tarafa nahin he
 Will challenges Sean to take a hard, objective look at his life
 shaun do varsh purv apni priy patni ke cancer se hui akaal mrityu ke haadase se nipat paane main aksham rahaa
 As time passed, Shawn began to like Will and realized that, despite his good intentions, Lambu was putting a lot of pressure on Will
 is bich, vil ko lekar lambiyu kii apekshaaon se vil ko chidh ho gai or antat vah lambiyu dwaara tay kii gai naukari ke saakshaatkaar par jane se inkaar kar detaa he
 Lambu confronts Shawn and suddenly Will arrives when they are furiously fighting over his future
 khud ko mudda banaakar unhen ladate hue dekh kar vil vichlit ho jaataa he, haalanki shaun use bataata he ki unki asli ladaai lambey samay se chali aa rahi he
 Skylar asks Will to move with her to California, where she will start a medical school at Stanford
 vil is vichaar se ghabara jaataa he or use dhakel detaa he
 Will tells his true story and that he has betrayed him
 skylar uske ateet par sahanubhuti vyakt karti he or kahati he ki vah use har haal main pyaar karti he, lekin isse ek krodh kaa aavesh paidaa hota he or vil chatravaas se tezi se baahar nikal jaataa he
 He blames the work he is doing for Lambieu by calling it "a joke"
 lambiyu, vil se sab barbaad naa kar dene kii guzarish karata he, lekin vil baahar chalaa jaataa he
 Shaun states that Will is so adept at realizing future failures in their interpersonal relationships that he either lets them fail or intentionally gives up, so that he can protect himself from the risk of emotional pain
 jab vil, shaun ke is sawaal kaa imaanadaaree bharaa jawaab dene se manaa kar detaa he ki vah apane jivan kaa kya karnaa chahta he, to khijte hue shaun, vil ko darvaaze se baahar nikal jane ko kahata he
 Will tells his best friend Chucky that he wants to be a laborer for the rest of his life
 chaki, vil ke saath krurtapurna eemaandaar ho jaataa he; vah yah jaanakar apamaanit mahasoos karata he ki vil apni kshamta barbaad karnaa chahta he
 He tells Will, "you are not indebted to yourself
 You are indebted to me
 Because tomorrow i will get up and see that i am fifty
" or main tab bhi yahi kar rahaa hounga


 tum ek jiti hui lottery tikat par baithe ho


 kyonki jo tumhaare paas he use paane ke liye main kuch bhi kar saktaa hum


 yah hamaare liye ek apmaan hoga agar tum bees saal baad bhi yaheen rahete ho
 yahaan ghoomte rahanaa kabakht tumhaare samay kii barbaadi he
 "he says that his biggest wish is that one morning he will knock on Will's door and see that he is not there
 vil ek anya chikitsakeey satr main jaataa he, jahaan vah or shaun yah saajha karte hai ki ve donon hi shaareerik bal shoshan ke shikaar the
 Shawn then asks Will to answer truthfully and tells him, "it's not your fault"
 At first Will responds negatively, saying "yes, i know" but after repeated saying, weeps and Sean comforts him
 ant main, kaaphi aatm-chintan ke baad, vil apane bheetar ke rakshas ke khilaaf khadaa hota he or apane jivan kii lagaam apane haathon main lene kaa faisla karata he
 Shortly thereafter, Sean takes a rest to travel the world and covers his office when Lambeau arrives there
 donon sulah karte hue dost ban jate hai or jam pine ke liye baahar jate hai, jahaan raste main ve shaun kii lottery tikat kharidne kii aadat ko lekar kar mithravat vivaad karte hai
 When his friends give him a renovated Chevrolet Nova on his 21st birthday, Will decides to find Skylar, ignoring his lucrative corporate and government job invitation
 us drishy ke samavarti jisamen vil chalaa jaataa he, chaki, vil ke daravaaje par dastak detaa he or jab use koi jawaab nahin miltaa to chaki muskuraataa he
 Will leaves a brief note for Sean, in which he uses a taunt of Sean himself, "if the professor asks about that work, just tell him, sorry, i have to go find a girl
 is
 " shaun majaak main hansate hue khud se kahata he ki vil ne "meri pankti chura lee"
 iske baad vil phir pashchim kii ore maas paik ke liye nikal jaataa he

 According to Damon's commentary in the DVD version of the film, the scene forced "johnny" to laugh so loud that the camera's POV could actually be seen moving up and down lightly, and Damon was also loud
 Laughs come out of his character

 Chandbardai was a heroic poet of Hindi literature and a friend of Prithviraj Chauhan
 unhone apane mitra kaa antim kshan tak saath diya
 Chandabardai was born in Lahore, he belonged to the Kaladi gotra of the caste Chandisa Rao Bhatt, later he became an honorable Sakha, royal poet and associate of Prithviraj, the well-known Hindu king of ajmer-delhi
 isse uskaa adhikansh jivan maharaja prithviraj chouhan ke saath dilli main beetaa tha
 The capital and the battlefield were with Prithviraj everywhere
 uski vidyamanata kaa kaal 13 veen sadi he
 Chandravardai's famous treatise is "prithvirajaraso"
 isaki bhashaa ko bhashaa-shastriyon ne pingal kaha he, jo rajasthan main brajabhasha kaa paryaay he
 Therefore, Chandavardai is considered the first great poet of Braj Bhasha Hindi
 'raso' kii rachana maharaj prithviraj ke yuddh-varnan ke liye hui he
 It describes their heroic wars and love affairs
 at: isamen vir or shringaar do hi ras he
 Chandabardai has composed this book like an eyewitness, but it is clear from the inscription evidence that there is an unknown poet who completes this work by describing the last moments of Chand and Prithviraj
 chandbardaai ko hindi kaa pehla kavi or unki rachana prithviraj raso ko hindi kii pehali rachana hone kaa sammaan praapt he
 Prithviraj Raso is the largest poetry book in Hindi

 ve bharat ke antim hindu samraat prithviraj chouhan tritiy ke mitra tathaa raajakavi the
 Prithviraj ruled Ajmer and Delhi from 1165 to 1192
 yahi chandbardaai kaa rachanakaal bhi tha
 His life was so mixed with the life of Prithviraj that it cannot be separated
 yuddh main, akhet main, sabha main, yatra main, sadaa maharaj ke saath rahete the or jahaan jo baaten hoti thim, sab main sammilit rahete the
 Even when Mohammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan and took him captive to Ghazni, he could not control himself and went to Ghazni
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kaid main band prithviraj ko jab andhaa kar diya gaya to unhen is avasthaa main dekh kar inkaa hriday dravit ho gaya evam inhone gori ke vadh kii yojana banaayi
 Under the said scheme, he first won the heart of Ghori and then told Ghori that Prithviraj could wield a wrenching arrow
 isse prabhavit hokar mohammad gori ne prithviraj kii is kala ko dekhne kii ichha prakat kii
 On the day of the performance Chand Baradiyi sat on the stage with Ghori
 andhe prithviraj ko maidan main laayaa gaya evam unase apni kala kaa pradarshan karne ko kaha gaya
 As Prithviraj shot an arrow over an hour, Ghori's mouth suddenly said "wow! Wow !!" The word came out just what was it again
 Chandbardiyi immediately told Prithviraj in a couplet that where Ghori was sitting and at what height
 vah doha is prakaar tha: Four bamboo twenty four yards, Angul Ashta Praman! Ta Sultan is up, Chauhan does not miss out !! is prakaar chand bardaai kii sahaayta se se prithviraj ke dwaara gori kaa vadh kar diya gaya
 Prithviraj Raso composed by him is considered to be the first authentic poetry of Hindi language

 Janakiharan is a high-quality epic composed by Mahakavi Kumaradas of Sri Lanka
 sarvapratham sinhalai bhashaa main praapt 'sannai' ke aadhaar par iske pratham 14 sargo tathaa 15wein ke kuch ansh kaa mul sanskrit rup banaakar prakashit kiya gaya he, jisamen angad dwaara ravan kii sabha main daitya tak kii katha aa jaati he
 The 10 Sargo manuscript of this epic is in Sanskrit at the Government Oriental Manuscript Library, Madras
 kintu yah lipi atyaadhik sadosh he
 There is also doubt about its authenticity and it is not known to what extent it has taken its form from Sinhalese 'sonna'
 sambhavat: is mahakavy kii rachana 25 sargo main hui thi or ram ke rajbhishek se katha kii samaapti hui thi - yah anumaan 'sanne' main udhrut sarvatya shlokon se lagaaya jaataa he
 Hence, its plot can be said to be very similar to 'bhattikavya'
 sargkram se isaki katha is prakaar he : The arrival of Ayodhya and coronation in the remaining Sergo must have been described
 antim padyon ke vivechan se gyaat hota he ki is mahakavy ke rachayita kaa naam 'kumaardaas' tha, jinhen kumarbhatt yaa kumaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 He was the king of Sinhaldwip
 inke pita kaa naam kumaarmani tha
 Kumaradas's fame was enough in India
 jalhan ne apni sookhtimuktawali main 'janakiharan' ke anek shloke uddhrut kiye hai
 Rajeshwar has praised Kumaradas's 'janakiharan' with a strong statement: kehete hai jis din pita kumaarmani yuddh main maare gaye usee din balak kumaardaas kaa janm hua tha
 Two of his matulas - Shri Megh and Agrabodhi - nurtured him
 kavi ne badi kritagyata ke saath apane un maatulon kaa samaran is kavy ke ant main kiya he
 These Kumaradas were different from Kumar Muttalsen, the son of Maudgalyayan, mentioned in the Mahantavantha Mahavansha of Sinhaldwip
 kinvadanti he ki apane kavy 'janakiharan' ke prashansak mahakavi kalidas ko kumaardaas ne saprem sinhaladweep bulaayaa
 Kalidas was tragically killed by being trapped there in the courtship of a beauty queen
 apane atithi evam mitra kii is jaghanya hatya se khinn raja kumaardaas ne bhi apane ko usee chita par jala daal
 Even today, the tomb of Kalidas exists in the south province of Lanka
 rajasekhar kii purvollikhit ukti se yahi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kumaardaas kalidas ke pashchaat hi hue honge
 Raghuvansh and Kumarasambhava also have a great influence on their composition
 yamak ke prati atishay aagrah hote hue bhi vaidarbhi reeti evam prasad gun is kavy kii apni vishistataaen hai
 Seeing the use of some specific words mentioned in Vamana Jayaditya's grammar treatise 'kashika' in the same sense, 'janakiharan', the time of Kumaradas can be placed between Vaman and Rajashekhar in the late eighth century and early ninth

 yah system bios ko prabhavit karat aatha or swatah sudhaar bhi nahin ho paata tha, kyonki iske baad computer apane aap boot tak nahin ho paata tha
 To repair this, the flash ROM chip had to be removed from the computer motherboard and reprogrammed elsewhere
 ye virus visheshtah tatkaaleen sabase adhik prachlit intel i430tx madraboard chipset, jo windos 9eks shrenee kaa samarthan karata tha; ko haani pahunchane ke uddeshy se bana tha, atah isse haani bhi sambhav thi
 The main reason for this was that this Windows family provided direct access to any program, so all program software had direct access to the virus
 aadhunik prachaalan tantra jaise linaks, mike oes eks, windos anti par aadhaarit anya tantra jaise windos 2000, windos ekspe va anya naveen sanskaran upayokta mod ko program tak sidhi pahunch nahin uplabdh karaate hai, atah is virus se purna surakshit rahete hai

K
, in which he demonstrated how physical memory can be read by malicious processors by increasing authorizations, which flash Replaces common ACPI procedures stored in memory

 avasar paakar urvashi ne arjuna se kaha, “he arjuna! aapako dekhakar meri kaam-vaasana jaagrit ho gai he, atah aap kripaya mere saath vihaar karke meri kaam-vaasana ko shant karen
 Hearing Urvashi's words, Arjun said, "oh God! Our ancestors had raised the pride of our dynasty by marrying you, so as the mother of the Puru clan, you are like our mother
 devi! main aapako pranaam karata hoon
 "urvashi's heartbreak arose from Arjuna's words and he said to Arjuna," You have spoken words like eunuchs, so i curse you that you will remain immaterial for a year
 ” itnaa kahkar urvashi vahaan se chali gai
 When Indra came to know about this incident, he said to Arjuna, "watts! The behavior you have done was worthy of you
 urvashi kaa yah shaap bhi bhagwaan kii ichha thi, yah shaap tumhaare agyatavaas ke samay kaam aayegaa
 Only at the time of your one-year exile you will remain impotent and on completion of the exile you will again receive masculinity
 ” On the other hand, when Arjun was staying in Devraj's Puri Amravati, one day Indra said to him, "O Partha! By staying here, you have mastered all the weapons and weapons and there will be hardly any other person like you in this world
 ab main tum mere shatru nivatakavach naamak daitya se yuddh karke uskaa vadh karo
 This will be Gurudakshina for you
 ” itnaa kehane ke baad indra ne arjuna ko amogh kavach pahanaakar tathaa apane divya rath main bithakar arjuna ko nivatakavach ke saath yuddh ke liye bhej diya
 Sitting in that chariot, Arjuna reached the city of Nivatakavach, which was situated in the sea
 yah dekhakar ki vah nagari indra kii puri amravati se bhi adhik manoram thi, arjuna aashcharyachakit rah gayi
 To relieve his wonder, Indra's charioteer Matali said, "O Arjuna! Earlier Devraj Indra used to reside in this city along with all the gods
 kintu brahma ji se var praapt kar nivatakavach atyant prabal ho gaya or indra par vijay praapt kar liya falswaroop devraj ko is nagari ko chhodkar amravati main janaa padaa
 After hearing the talk of Matali, Arjun made the city thunder with the sound of his conch
 shankh kii dhwani sunakar nivatakavach apane astr-shastron se susajjit hokar arjuna se yuddh karne aa gaya
 There was a fierce battle between the two maharathis and in the end Nivatakavacha was killed by Arjuna
 nivatakavach ke vadh karke waapas aane par devraj indra ne unke parakram kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karte huye kaha, “he parth! ab yahan par aapkaa kaary samaapt hua
 Your brothers are waiting for you on the Gandhamadan mountain
 chaliye main aapako ab unke paas pahunchaa don
 "thus Arjuna came to his brothers in the Gandhamadan mountain, sitting in his chariot with Devaraja Indra
 dharmraj yudhisthir ne devraj indra kaa vidhiwat pujan kiya
 Arjuna also embraced Nakula, Sahadeva and other members of the congregation after touching the feet of the sages, Brahmins, Yudhishthira and Bhimsen
 iske pashchaat devraj indra us mandali kii gandhamadan parvat par sthit kuber ke mahal main rahane kii vyavastha kar waapas apane lok chale gayi

 paristhitiki jeevigyaan kii ek shakha he jisamen jeev samudaayon kaa uske vaataavaran ke saath parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan karaten hai
 Each animal or plant lives in a certain environment
 paristhitigya is tathy kaa pataa lagaate hai ki jeev aapas main or paryaavaran ke saath kis tarah kriya karte hai or vah prithvi par jivan kii jatil sanrachana kaa pataa lagaate hai
 Ecology is also known as Environmental Biology
 is vishay main vyakti, jansankhya, samudaayon or echosystem kaa adhyayan hota he
 The term ecology, the first ecology, was used in 1866 by the German biologist Ernest Häckel in his book "general Morpology Late Organisms"
 beesvin sadi ke armbh main manushya or uske paryaavaran ke bich sambandhon par adhyayan prarambh hua or ek saath kai vishyon main is ore dhyaan diya gaya
 The result was the compilation of human ecology
 prakritik vaataavaran behad jatil he isliye shodhakarta adhikanshat: kisi ek kism ke praaniyon kii nasl yaa paudhon par shodh karte hai
 For example mankind builds on the earth and also affects vegetation
 manushya vanaspati kaa kuch bhaag seven karte hai or kuch bhaag bilkul hi anopyogi chhod dete hai
 Those plants continue to spread
 beesvin shatabdi sadi main ye gyaat hua ki manushyon kii gatividhiyon kaa prabhaav prithvi or prakruti par sarvada sakaaratmak hi nahin padataa rahaa he
 Then humans became aware of the serious impact on the environment
 nadiyon main vishakt audyogic kachare kaa nikaas unhen pradooshit kar rahaa he, usee tarah jangal kaatane se jaanwaron ke rahane kaa sthaan khatm ho rahaa he
 a variety of plant and animal species are found in each of the Earth's ecosystems, the study of which ecologists trace the history and formation of a particular ecosystem
 iske atirikt paristhitiki kaa adhyayan shahari parivesh main bhi ho saktaa he
 By the way, the study of ecology is not limited to the surface of the earth, marine life and water resources etc
 are also studied
 samudri janajivan par abhi tak adhyayan bahut kam ho paaya he, kyonki beesvin shatabdi main samudri tah ke bare main nai jaankariyon ke saath kai puraane myth toote or gaharaai main adhik dabaav or kam oxigen par rahane vaale jeevon kaa pataa chalaa tha
 There are mainly two types of components of an ecosystem - paristhitiki sajivon or unke nirjeev paryaavaran ke madhya sambandhon kaa adhyayan alag-alag staron yaa paimaanon par karti he
 From a living cell to organ, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biome and biosphere, interactions between organisms and their environment have different forms and evolution
 atah paristhitikeey adhyayan ke staron main pramukh hai: Like other ancient religions, Vedic philosophy has also believed that nature is vibrated with life
 sampoorn charachar jagat arthath prithvi, akaash, swarg, aag, vaayu, jal, vanaspati or jeev-jantu sab main daivatv kii dhara pravaahit he
 Knowledge of this approach comes from the fact that when Shakuntala of Kalidas, who grew up in an ashram in the lap of nature, started going to the city to meet her husband Dushyant, the trees and flowers, the deer fed by her, were very sad
 Happened
 yahaan tak ki lataaon ne bhi apane pile pattey jhaadkar rudan karnaa shuru kar diya
 In that era there was complete identification and direct contact between man and nature
 manushya kii aavashyaktaaen simit thim or santosh itan tha ki prakruti ke shoshan kii baat to vah sapane main bhi nahin soch saktaa tha
 Close association with nature was the heart of all religions
 samay ke saath shaharikaran or audyogikaran ke chalate manushya kaa prakruti se sampark tuutata gaya or tathakthith vikaas kii andhi daud main uski yah anubhuti samaapt ho gai ki prakruti bhi ek jivant shakti he
 The Vedic ethos refers to a holistic life in which the needs of the body, intellect, mind and soul are taken care of
 sharir kii moolbhoot aavashyaktaa he khaanaa, kapadaa, makaan or iske baad chikitsa va anya sabhi bhautik sukh-suvidhaayen
 The mind is the center of desires, which wants wishes to be fulfilled
 lekin buddhi aavashyaktaaon ko simit karne tathaa ichchhaaon ko niyantrit karne ke liye is tarah maargdarshan karti he ki prakruti ke punarchakreekaran kii prakriya va sabhy samaaj ke maheen tantu ast-vyast nahin hon
 According to a paper presented by Mr
 Gulab Kothari in Melbourne, so-called educated people are responsible for the destruction of ecology and environmental harmony

 Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, an American journalist, founder and first president of the Theosophical Society, felt that its long streaming shape made it inconvenient for general use
 He therefore suggested modifying it so that it was the size and shape of national flags
 In 1889 the modified flag was introduced to Japan by Anagarika Dharmapala and Olcott — who presented it to Emperor Meiji — and later to Burma
 At the 1952 World Fellowship of Buddhists, the flag of Buddhists was adopted as the International Buddhist Flag
 The six vertical bands of the flag represent the six colors of the aura, which originated from the Buddha's body when he attained enlightenment, as Buddhists believe
 chathe urdhwadhar band, dhvaj par, paanch anya rang ke ytaakar band kaa ek sangyojan se bana he, or abha ke spectrum main anya paanch rangon main se ek yogic kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
