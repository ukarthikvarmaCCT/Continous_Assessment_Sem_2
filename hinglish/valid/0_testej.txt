 When the mischief with a fellow high school student becomes serious, Laindon Rollins Carter of that popular but rebellious nature is warned to be expelled from school
 sajaa ke taur par use skool ke baad anivaary rup se vibhinn gatividhiyon masalan, garib bacchon ko tution padhanaa or drama club ke basantkaaleen sangeet samaaroh main bhaag lenaa tha
 While doing all this, she meets the silent, lost in books Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan, the only daughter of the church's pastor
 is ladki ko vah bahut samay se janata tha par isse shaayad hi kabhi usne baatcheet kii ho
 shaareerik rup se donon ek-duusare se bahut kareeb hone ke baavjood unke bhinn saamaajik parivesh ne unhen duniya ke do dhruvon kaa vaasi bana diya tha
 When Landon encounters some trouble remembering his lines for the play, he asks for help from Jamie
 She also agrees to help, but with the promise that he will not fall in love with her
 Laindon laughs at Jamie's strange things, but he also realizes that Jamie is the girl he will fall in love with sometime
 Landon eventually draws close to the prettiest and most popular girl in the city, because she was a different girl due to her shy nature and old-fashioned attire
 skool ke baad landan ne jaimi ke saath usee ke ghar par naatak kaa abhyaas shuru kiya
 The two become friends to some extent, meanwhile Laindon finds out that Jamie has set a wish list of what he wants to do in his life; Which includes the desire to make a tattoo and be present in two places at the same time
 ek din jaimi landan ke yahaan pahunch jaati he, jahaan vah apane kuch doston ke saath matargashti kar rahaa tha
 When Jamie asks Laindon that they can both rehearse the play in the afternoon if they want, Laindon responds by mocking him, "in your dreams
" Hearing this, his friends laugh and Laindon scoffs
 Jamie's face flares up with humiliation and embarrassment
 usee din dopaher ke samay landan jaimi ke yahaan is ummid ke saath pahunchataa he ki ab bhi vah uski madad karegi
 lekin jaimi ne darwaja tak kholane se inkaar kar diya
 ant main usne darwaja kholaa or vyangy se kaha ki ve donon "gupt mitra" ho sakate hai
 And when Laindon agreed, he slammed the door in front of him
 Laindon eventually recalls the script on its own
 naatak ke dauraan jaimi landan samet vahaan upasthit sabhi darshakon ko apni sundarataa or awaz se hakkaa bakka kar detii he
 At the end of the play, Laindon kisses Jamie, while the screenplay of the play did nothing of the sort
 landan jaimi ke kareeb aane ki koshish karata he, lekin vah baar-baar jhatak detii he
 It was only after Laindon's friends started mocking Jamie that Laindon agreed to understand
 He takes Jamie home after punching Dean and Belinda
 donon ke bich ek rishta panpane laga
 landan ne jaimi ko apane saath dinar par chalane ko kaha, lekin jawaab main usne landan ke saath date par jane se manaa kar diya
 jaimi ke saath date par jane ke liye landan is kadar bekaraar tha ki vah carch main uske pita ke paas chalaa jaataa he or jaimi ko dinar par baahar le jane kii anumati maangata he
 But his father refuses
 landan jaimi ke pita se us par bharosa karne ke liye kahata he
 Eventually they agree
 landan jaimi ko baahar dinar par le jaataa he or vahaan uske saath dance bhi karata he
 He had never done this to anyone before
 iske baad landan jaimi kii ichha suchi kii kuch chizon ko puraa karne main madad karata he
 Landon took Jamie to the state line as a memorable date
 usne bade hi josh ke saath line par jaimi ko donon pair failaane ke liye kaha to jaimi ne usase poocha ki vah yah kya kar rahaa he
 Laindon then tells him that "by doing this he is present in two places at the same time
" " yah dekh jaimi kaa cheharaa khushi se chamak uthaa
 tabhi use is baat kaa khyaal hua ki landan ne uske asambhav sapane ko sach kar diya
 ek shaam landan jaimi ko telescope ke jariye uske liye ek star khojane ke liye kahata he
 Jamie asks him why he is searching for a star
 jaimi use gale laga leti he or fusfusaate hue pehali baar kahati he "main tumse pyaar karti hum"
 One evening, Jamie finally tells Lendon that he has incurable leukemia and has stopped treatment
 pehle to landan pareshaan ho jaataa he
 Jamie tells him why he didn't tell her all this before, because she is enjoying her life and using the remaining time
 lekin phir landan mila or vah uske saath pyaar karne lagi
 jaimi ruansaa hokar kahati he "main bhagwaan se naaraaz nahin hum" or vah vahaan se chali jaati he
 Laindon goes to his cardiologist father and asks him to help Jamie
 unke pita thodaa hichakate hai, kyonki ve leukemia visheshgy nahin hai, phir bhi ve kehete hai ki ve jaimi kii jaanch karnaa chaahate hai or isse pehle ki ve kuch karen uski chikitsa ke itihaas ke bare main jaan lenaa chaahate hai
 Laindon expresses his reaction in a huff
 landan or jaimi agle din milte hai
 He hugs her and tells her that he is always with her
 jald hi, jaimi kii beemaari kii khabar fail jaati he
 Laindon's best friend Eric, who was involved in making fun of Jamie, arrives and apologizes to him, saying that he did not understand
 baad main dean or belinda bhi aakar maafi maangate hai
 By the time she falls into her father's arms, Jamie's cancer reaches a worse condition
 vah use aspataal le jate hai, jahaan unki mulaaqaat landan se hoti he
 Laindon remains seated near Jamie, until his father forcibly forces him to leave
 Jamie's father sits down and says to him "if i keep you too close, because i want to keep you alive for more days
" Jamie tells her father that she loves them very much
 or vah ro padati he
 The next day, Laindon arrives at the hospital and sees Jamie in a wheelchair going out of the ward
 vah jaimi se poochta he ki kya hua
 In response, Jamie thanks her for the help given to her by her father
 landan jaimi ke pita se poochta he ki aisa usne kyon kaha
 vah use bataate hai ki uske pita jaimi ke ilaaj ke liye nijee taur par ghar par dekhbhaal ke liye paise adaa kar rahe hai
 Laindon is stunned, so he knocks at his father's door at night
 uske pita adanr bulaate hai
 Laindon whispers and says "thank you" and his father hugs him
 is maamle main apni tamaam thakaan or bhay ke kaaran landan apane pita kii bahon rone lagata hai
 Laindon continued to fulfill many of Jamie's wishes, such as making a telescope so that he could see the comet
 Jamie's father, who had not accepted him earlier, helped him in this
 After Jamie sees the comet from that telescope, Laindon accepts the marriage proposal
 is prakriya ke jariye landan or jaimi ne prem ke swarup ke bare main bahut kuch janaa

 With Jamie's memory Laindon becomes a better person and, like Jamie, achieves his set goals
 chaar saal baad landan jaimi ke pita se jaakar miltaa he
 It is clear that Jamie helped him focus and become a good person
 For example, he completes college and enrolls in medical school, but he had no plans for life after high school before meeting Jamie
 He tells Jamie's father that he is sorry that he did not fulfill his desire to see 'any miracle' before Jamie's death
 uske pita ne jawaab main kaha, "usne dekha

" Nicholas Sparks' sister Danielle Sparks Lewis became the inspiration for a Walk to Remember, who died of cancer in 2000

 Danielle met a man who wanted to marry her, "both knowing that she is ill and that she will not live long", both the book and the film are devoted to Danielle Lewis Sparks

 Track List: film main sangeet kii suchi Although there are many similarities to the novel written by Nicholas Sparks, many changes have been made
 apni nijee website main sparks ne in fark ke peeche ke nirnay kii vyakhya kii hai
 For example, he and the producers decided that the 1990s should be set instead of the 1950s so that the story could be updated
 He feared that the film's 50s sets would fail to attract teenagers
 "for their interest," he writes, "we had to make the story more contemporary
 " adhyatan ko vishwasaneey banane ke liye landan kii dhristataaon or vyavhaar ko upanyaas kii tulana main or bura bananaa padaa
 sparks likhte hai, "1950 ke dashak main kishor ladakon ke vyavhaar ko jaraa halki "brudabi" mana jaataa tha, jabaki 1990 ke dashak main kishor ladakon ke vyavhaar ko puri 'brudabi'" samajha gaya
 Sparks and producers also changed the play in which Laindon and Jamie take part
 upanyaas main hegbert ne ek christmas naatak likhaa, jisame yah dikhaaya gaya ki ek baar usne ek pita ke rup main kitna sangharsh kiya tha
 The sub-plot showed how he managed to overcome the conflict, but could not be included in the film due to lack of time
 Sparks was concerned that those who did not read the book would raise questions about Hegbert regarding whether he was a "good father", adding that "because he is a good father and so we can raise this question more Don't want to drag too much, so we changed the issue
 upanyaas or film ek mahatvapurn antar yah he ki upanyaas ke ant main is baat kaa khulaasa nahin hua ki jaimi mar jaati he yaa nahin jabaki 1950 ke dashak main cancer se maut nishchit thi
 Sparks says that when she wrote the book she knew she would die, despite it being "jamie Sullivan fell in love" and so i liked the "solution that i had in my mind towards her sister at this point" Let him be expressed, so i kept hoping that he was alive "
 Laindon's father in the novel is a congressman, but in the film he is a cardiologist who helps Jamie with his illness
 apane karier ke kaaran, unke paas paryaapt dhan he jisase ve jaimi kii ghar par chikitsa karvaa sakate hai
 There are minor differences as well, as when Jamie gives Laindon her mother's book in the film, she says, "don't worry, it's not the Bible"
 In the novel, Jamie gives him his mother's Bible, in which his favorite passages are outlined
 upanyaas main, landan jaimi ke kehane par skool ke naatak main hissaa letaa he, jabaki film main use aisa karne ko baadhya kiya jaataa he

 However, there is no evidence that Manten took his wife with him while patients watch
 iske alaava, vah 1851 main sweekaar kiya ki vah khud ko daant paaya tha
 Everyone agrees that the story is false, although it is known that Manten first acquired the largest fossil bones from the mine in the Green Whitemans in 1820
 Because even theropod teeth were found, thus related to carnivores, he first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine, as those of a giant crocodile into a partial skeleton
 In 1821, Manten noted for the discovery of the vegetarian teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous snake was present in the strata
 haalanki, apane 1822 dakshin chadhaav ke prakaashan jeevashm main vah abhi tak daant or uski bahut adhuraa kankal ke bich ek conection kaa suzav himmat nahin tha, yah maanate hue ki uske paata do bade roopon, ek maansaahaari, anya shaakaahaari

 Although Cuvier retracted from the very next day, Lyell only reported the dismissal of Manten, who became skeptical about the issue
 1824 main Buckland megaloshoras varnit or ki monten sangrah yatra ke liye aamantrit avasar par tha
 On March 6, looking at the bones, he agreed that these were some of the giant creeping animals, though still denying that it was a herbivore
 phir bhi unka hausala badhaayaa, monten phir kuwiyar, jo 22 june 1824 par uttar diya ki vah nirdhaarit kiya tha ki ve saanp the or kaaphi sambhawatah ek vishaal herbivore hai kuch daant bheja

 The fossil remains of the early days were fragmented, which led to much speculation on Eugnodon's posture and nature, as Ignodon was initially depicted as a quadruped animal horn nose

 Definitions of famine are based on three different categories - on the basis of food supply, on the basis of food consumption and on the basis of mortality
 Some definitions of famine are: kisi aabaadi main khaadya padaarthon kii kami yaa to bhojan kii kami yaa phir bhojan ke vitaran main kathinaaiyon ke kaaran hota he; yah sthiti prakritik jalwaayu ke utaar-chadhaavon or damankaaree sarkaar yaa yuddh se sambandhit charam raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran or bhi badtar ho sakati he
 Ireland's horrific famine was proportionally one of the largest historical famines
 isaki shuruyaat 1845 main aalu kii beemaari kii vajah se hui thi or yah isliye bhi hua kyonki khaadya padaarthon ko ireland se england bheja ja rahaa tha

 The traditional explanation for the cause of famine until 1981 was as a hypothesis of decreased availability of food
 dharna yah thi ki sabhi akalon kii kendriya vajah khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami thi
 However the FAD could not explain why only a particular segment of the population such as agricultural laborers were affected by famine while others were untouched by famine
 haal hi ke kuch akalon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par ebedy kii nirnaayak bhoomika par sawaal uthaaya gaya he or yah suzav diya gaya he ki jald se jald bhukhmaree kii sthiti laane kaa kaaran banane vaali pranaaliyon main sirf khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami ke alaava bhi kai anya kaarak shaamil hai
 According to this view, famine is a consequence of rights, this proposed principle is called "failure of exchange rights" or FEE
 kisi vyakti ke paas vibhinn prakaar kii vasteen ho sakati hai jinaki adla-badali ek bazaar vyavastha main uski jarurat kii anya chizon ke badalen main kii ja sakati he
 Exchange can be done through trade or production or a combination of both
 in adhikaron ko vyapaar-aadhaarit yaa utpaadan-aadhaarit adhikaar kaha jaataa he
 According to this proposed approach, the state of famine comes due to the loss of ability of the person to exchange his rights

 Some elements make a particular area highly susceptible to famine
 inamen shaamil hai: In some cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China, in North Korea in the mid-1990s or in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, famine conditions may arise as an unintended consequence of government policies

 It is worth noting that the condition of modern famines is sometimes spoiled by misguided economic policies, political design or acts of war designed to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, political economists have seen those political situations Has investigated under which famine can be prevented
 amartya sen kehete hai ki bharat main maujuud udaaravaadi sansthaaon ke saath-saath pratispardhi chunaav or ek mukt press ne aazaadee ke baad se desh main akaal ko rokane main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai he
 Alex de Waal has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and the public that is sure to prevent famine, noting that the rarity of such political contracts in Africa and the danger that International relief agencies will weaken those contracts by removing the accountability position for famines from national governments
 akaal ke janasankhyikeey prabhaav tikshn hote hai
 Mortality rates remain concentrated between children and the elderly

 vah ghar ke sab kaaryon ko swany karti thim
 She used to grind barley and make rotis with her hands
 vah purna rup se samast kaaryon main apane pati kaa sahyog karti thim
 The plagues after the Prophet's exile on her husband played a key role in Hazrat Ali Alaihissalam's support in those plagues
 tathaa apane pati kii saahayatarth apane praano kii aahuti de di
 When Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha died, Hazrat Ali said, "today i have lost my greatest supporter

 And always used to behave lovingly

 Hazrat Prophet's disease was greatly aggravated in the last phase of his life
 fatima har samay apane pita kii seva main rahati thim
 Sitting in the bed of his bed, he kept staring at his stunning face and used to clear the sweat due to fever
 jab hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha apane pita ko is avasthaa main dekhati to rone lagati thim
 Prophet did not bear it
 unhone hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ko sanket diya ki mujh se adhik sameep ho jaao
 When Hazrat Fatimah Salamullah Alaiha came near, the Prophet said something in his ear which Hazrat Fatimah Salamullah Alaiha smiled
 is avasar par hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha kaa muskuraana aashcharya janak tha
 So you were asked what your father told you? You answered that i will not tell this secret to anyone in my father's life
 paigambar ke swargvaas ke baad aapane is rahasy ko prakat kiya
 And said that my father told me that you will meet me first of my family
 or main isi kaaran harsith hui thi
 One day Hazrat Prophet was sitting in the mosque with his friends
 usee samay ek vyakti vahaan par aayaa jiske kapade fate hue the tathaa us ke chehre se daridrata prakat thi
 Due to old age, the strength of his body was reduced
 paigambar us ke sameep gayi tathaa usase uske bare main prashn kiya usne kaha ki main ek dukhifat bhikhaari hoon
 i am hungry, give me food, i am clothless, give me clothes to wear, i am a pauper, help me financially
 paigambar ne kaha ki is samay mere paas kuch nahin he parantu chunki kisi ko achche kaary ke liye rasta bataanaa bhi acha kaary karne ke samaan he
 Therefore the Prophet told him the address of the house of Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha
 kyoki unka ghar masjid se mila hua tha atah vah shighrata se unke dwaar par aayaa va saahayata kii guhaar kii
 Hazrat Fatimah Salamullah Alaiha said that at this time i have nothing that i can give you
 parantu mere paas ek maala he tu ise bench kar apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar saktaa he
 Saying this, take the garland from your neck and give it to him
 fih maala hazarat paigambar ke chachaa shri hamaza ne hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ko uphaar swaroop di thi
 He came to the Prophet with this garland and said that Fatima had given this garland
 tathaa kaha he ki main isko bench kar apni avashyaktaaon kii purti karuun
 
 paigambar is maala ko dekh kar rone lage
 a friend of yours named Ammare Yasir was sitting near you
 unhone kaha ki mujhe anumati dijiye ki main is maala ko kharid lun paigambar ne kaha ki jo is maala ko kharidega allaah us par azaab nahin karegaa
 Ammar asked the poor, how much do you want to sell this garland? He replied that i will bench it at such a price, in which i get bread to eat clothes to wear and a dinar is left nearby so that i can go to my house
 ammaar yasir ne kaha ki main isko bhojan vastra sawari va bees dinar ke badale kharidta hoon
 He was quickly prepared
 is prakaar ammare yasir ne is maala ko kharid kar sugandhit kiya
 And gave it to his servant and said that by presenting this garland to the Prophet and i also presented the Prophet to you
 paigambar ne bhi vah maala tathaa das hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha kii bhent kar diya
 Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha took the garland and told the slave that i freed you for Allah
 das yah sunakar hansane laga
 When Hazrat Fatima asked the reason for the hags, he said that he made me laugh by this garland because it fed a hungry, clothe a clothless, gave a ride to a pedestrian, made a poor man a freedman and In the end, i went to my boss
