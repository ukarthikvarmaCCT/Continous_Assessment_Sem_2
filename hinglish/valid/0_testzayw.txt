 chaar dashakon se ‘sanchetana’ kaa sampadan, vishnu prabhakar : vyaktitv or sahitya’ a dental floss is either a sheaf of fine nylon fibers or a plastic lace that is used to remove food and teeth from the teeth
 lomak ko dhire se daanton ke bich daalaa jaataa he or daanton ke donon parshvon par, visheshkar masoodon ke najadik, kureda jaataa he
 Dental floss may be scented or scentless and waxed or waxless
 aisa hi prabhaav praapt karne ke liye upyukt ek vaikalpik aujaar he, antardantiy brush
 Levi Spier Parmley, a dentist from the New Orleans, is credited with the discovery of the first form of floss of teeth
 usne 1815 main sifarish kii ki logon ko apane daanton kii resham ke lomak se safai kerani chaiye
 Dental floss remained unavailable to the consumer until the 1882 start of the production of man-use waxless silk floss by the Codman & Shirtleft Company
 1898 main johnson and johnson karporation ko dental lomak ke liye pehla patent praapt hua
 Other early brands include Red Cross, Salter Sill Co
 And Brunswick included
 james jois ke prasiddh upanyaas ulisiis main ek paatr ko daanton ke lomak kaa prayog karte hue prastut kiya gaya he or yah saahitiyik pariklpana main iske chalan kaa praarambhik ullekh he
 Approval of the use of floss was quite low until before the Second World War
 is samay ke aas-paas docharles si bas ne nylon lomak ko viksit kiya
 Nylon floss was found to be superior to silk due to greater abrasion resistivity and flexibility
 paryaavaran ke sangrakshan kii chintaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jainaspakraman ke yogya vastuon se bane daanton ke lomak ab uplabdh hai
 Dentists and dental hygienists recommend a daily oral hygienic method of brushing and flossing teeth
 lagbhag sabhi amareeki log apane daanton ko brush karte hai
 Tooth, however, studies have shown that only 10 to 40 percent of Americans floss daily
 danta-lomak aam taur par plastic ke dispenceron main miltaa he, jinamein 10 se 50 meter tak lomak hota he
 After pulling out the desired amount, the floss is pulled against a small shielded blade into the plucking machine
 danta sota ungaliyon ke bich yojit kiya jaataa he
 The floss is transported between each tooth and below the gum line and removes food particles trapped between the teeth and the dental-bacterial scab attached to their surfaces
 upyukt rup se c ke aakaar kaa prayog karke lomak ko daant ke chaaron ore modaa jaataa he or masoodon kii rekha ke neeche rakhaa jaataa he or phir masoodon kii rekha se dur le jaaya jaataa he, jisase lomak prayek daant ko donon ore se kuredta he or daant ke saamne yaa peeche ke bhaag kii bhi safai kar saktaa he
 When the floss is slowly moved away from the bottom of the gingival line, the dentate-bacterial scab is attached to the dental surfaces above and below the gingival line
 sota kii ek saaf karne ke liye prayek anubhag daant saaf karne ke liye ek daant se pattica bacteria duusare karne ke liye sanchaaran se bachane ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Several different types of dental floss are commonly available
 sabase mahatvapurn bhinnata uski motaai main hoti he
 If the thickness of the floss is greater than the space between the teeth joints, then it will be difficult or impossible to remove the floss from between the teeth
 duusari ore, yadi lomak bahut patala hua to vah bahut kamjor hoga or tut jayega
 bhinn mukhon or ek mukh ke vibhinn bhaagon ke liye, bhinn lomak upyukt hote hai
 This is due to less space between some teeth than other teeth
 yah sambhav he ki motaa lomak daanton par se jeevanuyukt papadi nikaalane main adhik kargar hota he, kyonki daanton ke bich uskaa prayog karne ke liye paryaapt jagah hoti he
 Whenever a piece of hard food is tightly wedged between teeth, a thin floss may be required, as a thick floss may not cross that food
 daanton ke lomak ke kuch prakaaron ko lambaai main vibhajit karke patale tukdon kaa ek joda banaaya ja saktaa he, jo kaaphi najuk lekin kabhi-kabhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 This is possible because some types of floss of teeth are made of many very fine fibers, which run almost parallel rather than woven together
 aisa tab bhi upyogi siddh ho saktaa he, yadi aapkaa dental lomak bahut motaa ho, yaa kisi or kaaran se upyogi na ho or aap ke liye nayaa lomak mangana sambhav na ho, jaise jab aap videsh yatra kar rahe hon
 Special plastic sticks or floss sticks have been made to catch floss
 inhen lomak dispencer par lagaaya yaa usase nikaala ja saktaa he
 It can be awkward to use a stick without closing the finger and there may be difficulty in flossing at all angles with the finger
 par duusari ore, adhik pahunch pichley daanton ko lomak karnaa aasaan bana sakati he

 He has first given a logical rendering of jain-agam-agreed substances
 inke sabhi uplabdh granth praakrit main hai
 It has been his specialty that he has rendered Jainism in the light of his own philosophical ideology, and not only re-discourses of Jain proceeds

 He wrote independent texts to describe each subject, which is called Pahud

 He is considered to be the exponent of 'transcendental imperialism'
 jain aagmon main dravya or paryaay main bhed or abhed donon mana jaataa he
 But according to them, their distinction is practical, ultimately both are integral
 isi prakaar aatma main varna kaa sadbhaav or asadbhaav donon aagamasammat hai, parantu inke anusaar vyaavhaarik rup main to varna aatma main hai, parmaarthik rup main nahin hai
 He considered the unity of body and soul in practice, but in the determination, he considered the difference between the two
 ve dravya ko satta se abhinn maanate he
 In Vaisesika philosophy, power considers matter to be true due to the general, but they say that in this opinion, matter will become dissatisfied due to separation from power
 at: dravya satta rup hi he or yahi paramtatv he
 Power develops in the form of matter, quality and substance in the country, so everything is a matter of matter

 By considering this distinction, spiritualist philosophers honor an individualism
 jain darshan bhootvaadi he, aadhyatmavaadi nahin
 Nevertheless, he considered a distinction between behavior and determination
 jo saamanyat: dikhaai detaa he vah sarvada satya nahin hota or koi aavashyak nahin ki satya sadaa shuddh rup main gochar ho
 He considered three forms of the soul
 bahya padaarthon main aasakt, deh ko apane se abhinn samajhane vaali moodhaatma bahiraatma he
 When the body becomes aware, it is said that the soul that is moksamarga is the conscience
 dhyanabal se karmmal kaa kshay ho jane par jab aatma shuddh rup praapt kar leti he
 Then it is called God
 isi paramatma ko unhone shiv, brahma, vishnu, buddha aadi kahkar tatkaaleen darshan se apane ko parmarthat: abhinn ghoshit kiya he jo sambhavat: kisi jain acharya ne nahin kiya
 It is his specialty that distinguishes him from the other Jainacharyas and is a reflection of his syncretic tendency
 unhone aatma ko kaary-karan se bhinn maanakar sankhya ke kutasth purush kii kalpana ke saath samanvit kiya parantu aatma ko akarta nahin mana
 In his opinion, the soul is not the agent of non-committal culmination, but it is also considered to be the doer due to its consequential
 aatma gyaan aadi swagat parinaamon kaa to karta he hi
 He said that the element cannot be described with behavior and determination
 tatv pakshaatikrant he
 The creature is in pure form, not impaired
 bandha-abandh se vimukt jeev hi sahaysar or paramatma paramtatv kaha gaya he
 Practices are resolved with determination
 inkaa kahana he ki nishchaynay kaa aashray lekar yadhyapi tatv kaa gyaan hota he, tathaapi tatvagyan ho jane par nishchiyanay kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he

 There are 27 districts in this province: heparin, yakrut), jise akhandit heparin ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, ek ucch-sulphate glicosminoglaiken, vyapak rup se ek thakka-rodhi injection ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he or kisi bhi gyaat jaivik anu ghanatv se isamen sabase zyada rinatmak charge he
 It is used on various experimental and medical devices such as test tubes and kidney dialysis machines to make anti-clotting internal surfaces
 pharmaceutical grad heparin ko maance ke liye vadh kiye jane vaale jaanwaron, jaise shookreey aant yaa gozaaty fefde ke mucosal utakon se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Although used primarily in medicine for anticoagulants, its actual functional role in the body remains unclear, as antihypertensive quenching is mostly achieved by heparan sulfate proteoglycans derived from endothelial cells
 heparin aam taur par mast koshika ke sravi bijaanu ke bheetar sangrahit rahata he or sirf utak chot kii jagahon par vaskulechar main jari hota he
 It is proposed that instead of anticoagulation, the main purpose of heparin is to protect against invading bacteria and other external substances at such sites
 iske alaava, yah vyapak rup se vibhinn prajatiyon main sangrakshit he, jinamein shaamil hai kuch aksheruki jeev jinamein aisi hi samaan rakt jamaav pranali nahin he
 Native heparin is a polymer whose molecular weight ranges from 3 kda to 30 kda, although the average molecular weight of most commercial heparin constructs is between 12 kda to 15 kda
 heparin, carbohydrate ke glicosminoglaiken parivaar kaa ek sadsy he jo ek parivartansheel-sulphatekrut disekaride ikai se bana he
 The main disaccharide units that occur in heparin are shown below
 sabase aam disekaride ikai ek 2-o-sulphatekrut iduronic acid or 6-o-sulphatekrut, N-sulphatekrut glucosemine, idoa-glcns se bani hoti he
 For example, it makes up 85% of heparin from beef lungs and 75% from succulent intestinal mucosa

 glca-glcnac glca-glcns idoa-glcns -glcns idoa glcns- glcns- The three-dimensional structure of heparin is complicated by the fact that iduronic acid can exist in either of the two low-energy formations when it is placed internally inside an oligosaccharide
 gathnaatmak santulan, asann glucosemine sharkara ke salphation sthiti dwaara prabhavit hota he
 Nevertheless, the solution structure of a dodecacaride of heparin, which is formed entirely from six glcns-idoa repeating units, is determined using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling techniques
 do model kaa nirmaan kiya gaya, ek jisamen sabhi idoa, 2S0 gathan main the or doosraa jisamen ve 1C4 gathan main hai 
 lekin aisa koi saboot nahin he ki jisase yah suzav diya jaae ki in gathnon ke bich parivartan ek thos style main ghatit hote he
 These models correspond to the protein data bank code 1HPN
 upar kii chhavi main: In these models, heparin adopts a helical formation, whose rotation places clusters of sulfate groups at a regular interval of about 17 angstroms on either side of the helical axis
 heparin ek swaabhaavik rup se maujuud rahane vaala thakka-rodhi he jiskaa utpaadan basophil or mast utak dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Heparin acts as an anticoagulant, where it prevents clots and existing clots from expanding within the bloodstream
 jabaki heparin un thakkon ko nahin todta he jo pehle se ban gaye hai, yah sharir ke prakritik thakka lysis tantra ko ban chuke thakkon ko todane ke liye saamaanya rup se kaary karne kii anumati detaa he
 Heparin is commonly used for clotting for the following conditions: heparin or iske nimna aanvik bhaar ke vyutpann, rogiyon main gahan-shira ghanaastrata or phuffusiya antahshalyata ko rokane main prabhavi hai, lekin aisa koi saboot nahin he inamen se koi bhi ek mrityu ko rokane main adhik prabhavi he
 Heparin binds to the enzyme inhibitory antithrombin III and produces a conformational change that results in its activation through increased flexibility of the reactive site loop
 sakriy AT phir thrombin or rakt ke thakke main shaamil anya proteis ko niskriy kar detaa he, sabase khaskar kaarak Xa ko
 The activation rate of these proteases by AT can increase 1000-fold due to the binding of heparin
 AT, heparin bahulak main nihit ek vishisht pentasecride salphation anukram se bandhata he glcnac / ns-glca-glcns-idoa-glcns heparin-bandhan par AT main gathnaatmak parivartan, kaarak Xa ke uske nishedh main madhyasthata karata he
 For thrombin inhibition, however, thrombin must bind to the heparin polymer at a site that is close to the pentasaccharide
 heparin kaa ucch-rinatmak charge ghanatv, thrombin ke saath isaki atyant majboot vidyut-sthitik antarkriya karne main yogadan detaa he
 AT, the formation of ternary clusters between thrombin and heparin, results in inactivation of thrombin
 is kaaran se thrombin ke khilaaf heparin kii gatividhi aakaar-nirbhar he, jahaan prabhavi gathan ke liye trigut sankul ko kam se kam 18 secride ikaayiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Conversely, the factor anti-xa activity requires only the pentasaccharide binding site
 aakaar ke is antar ne nimna-aanvik bhaar vaale heparin ko prerit kiya or adhik haal main pharmaceutical thakka-rodhi ke rup main phondaparinaks ko
 Low-molecular-weight heparin and fondaparinux target anti-factor Xa activity, rather than anti-thrombin activity, where they aim to facilitate a more subtle regulation of coagulation and an improved therapeutic index
 phondaparinaks kii rasinic sanrachana bain taraf dikhaai gai he
 It is a synthetic pentasaccharide whose chemical structure is almost identical to the AT binding pentasaccharide sequence that can be found in polymeric heparin and heparan sulfate
 LMWH or phondaparinaks ke saath, osteoporosis or heparin-janit thrombocytonpinia kaa khatra kam hota he
 Monitoring of APTT is also not required and does not of course reflect the anticoagulant effect, as APTT is insensitive to changes in factor Xa
 heparan sulphate kaa ek mishran, danaperoid, dermatan sulphate or kaundroytin sulphate ko un rogiyon ke liye thakka-rodhi ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jinamein HIT viksit ho chukaa he
 Because danaperoids do not contain heparin or heparin fragments, cross-reactivity of danaperoids with heparin-borne antibodies has been reported to be less than 10%
 heparin ke prabhaav ko lab main aanshik thromboplastin samay dwaara mapa jaataa he, 
 Heparin is given intravenously because it is not absorbed by the intestine due to its high negative charge and large size
 heparin ko nason ke dwaara yaa avatvjeey tareeke se antahkshipt kiya ja saktaa he; raktagulm ke gathan kii sambhaavna kii vajah se antarpeshiy injection se parhez kiya jaataa he
 Due to the short biological half-life of approximately one hour, heparin must be given frequently or as a continuous intake
 haalanki, nimna-aanvik bhaar vaale heparin kii dainik ek khuraaq kii anumati di gai he, is prakaar iske lagaataar seven kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 If clotting is required for a longer period, heparin is often used to initiate anticoagulant therapy until the oral warfarin begins its effect
 ise pradaan karne kaa vivaran american college of chest phisician dwaara naidanik abhyaas disha nirdesh main uplabdh he: One serious side effect of heparin is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
 HIT is caused by an immune response that targets platelets an immune response, which results in platelet degradation
 isi kaaran thrombocytopenia hota he
 This condition is usually reversed upon discontinuation and can generally be avoided with the use of synthetic heparin
 thrombocytopenia kaa ek saumy rup bhi he jo heparin ke aarambhik upyog se judaa he or jo heparin ko roke bina hal ho jaataa he
 There are two non-hemorrhagic side-effects of heparin treatment
 pehla he serum aminotranspherez str, jise heparin lene vaale kareeb 80% rogiyon main suchit kiya gaya he
 This abnormality is not associated with liver disease, and it disappears after discontinuation of the drug
 anya jatilta he hikerakalemia, jo heparin lene vaale 5% se 10% rogiyon main hoti he or yah heparin-prerit aldostron dabaav kaa parinaam he
 Hyperkalemia may appear within a few days of the onset of heparin therapy

 Management includes organizing, organization-building, staffing, leadership, and controlling the organization or initiative
 sanghathan bhale hi bada ho yaa chota, laabh ke liye ho athwa gaiyr-laabh vaala, seva pradaan karata ho athwa vinirmaankarta, prabandh sabhi keliye aavashyak he
 Management is necessary so that individuals can make their best contribution towards the accomplishment of collective objectives

 Many authors have given the definition of management
 prabandh shabd ek bahuprachlit shabd he jise sabhi prakaar kii kriyaaon ke liye vyapak rup se prayukt kiya gaya he
 By the way, it is mainly used for various activities of any enterprise
 uparokt udhaaharan evam vastusthiti ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho gaya hoga ki prabandh vah kriya he jo har us sanghathan main aavashyak he jisamen log samooh ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 People do different types of tasks in the organization but they still work to achieve the same purpose
 prabandh logon ke prayatnon evam samaan uddeshy ko praapt karne main disha pradaan karata he
 In this way, the management sees that the tasks are completed and the targets are achieved, at least at the least cost and minimum cost
 atah prabandh ko paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se praapt karne ke uddeshy se kaaryon ko puraa karaane kii prakriya he
 We need to analyze this definition
 kuch shabd aise hai jinka vistaar se varnan karnaa aavashyak he
 These words are- paribhaasha main prayukt prakriya se abhipraay he praathmik kaary athwa kriyaayein jinhen prabandh kaaryon ko puraa karaane ke liye karata he
 These tasks are - planning, organization, appointment, direction and control which will be discussed further in this chapter and in the book
 prabhavi athwa kaary ko prabhavi dhang se karne kaa vastav main abhipraayah die gaye kaary ko sampann karnaa he
 Effective management is about doing the right thing, completing actions and achieving objectives
 duusare shabdon main, iskaa kaary antim parinaam praapt karnaa he
 But just completing the work is not enough, there is another aspect of it and that is efficiency ie doing the work efficiently
 kushalta kaa arth he kaary ko sahi dhang se nunatam laagat par karnaa
 There is a kind of cost-benefit analysis and the relation between input and output
 yadi kam sadhano kaa upyog kar adhik laabh praapt karte hai to ham kahenge ki kshamta main vruddhi hui he
 Efficiency will be increased if less resources are used for the same benefit or output and less cost is incurred
 aagat saadhan ve hai jo kisi kaary vishesh ko karne ke liye aavashyak dhan, maal upkaran evam maanav sansaadhan hon
 Naturally, management is related to the efficient use of these resources because they reduce costs and in the end they increase profits
 yah donon shabd alag-alag hote hue bhi ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 It is important to have both effective and efficient management
 prabhaavapurntaa evam kaushal donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 But balance between these two sides is necessary and sometimes management has to compromise efficiency
 udhaaharan ke liye prabhaavapurn hona evam kushalta kii andekhi karnaa saral he jiskaa arth he kaary ko puraa karnaa lekin unchi laagat par
 For example, suppose a company aims to produce 8,000 units in a year
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye adhikansh samay bijli na milane par prabandhak prabhavotpadak to tha lekin kshamtawan nahin tha kyonki, usee nirgat ke liye adhik aagat kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Sometimes business focuses more on the production of goods with less resources, ie reduced the cost but failed to produce the scheduled production
 parinamswaroop maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya isliye isaki maang kam ho gai tathaa iskaa sthaan pratiyogiyon ne le liya
 This is a situation of lack of efficiency but effectiveness as the goods did not reach the market
 isliye nunatam laagat par prabandhak liye lakshyon ko praapt karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he
 For this, balance has to be made in effectiveness and efficiency
 saadharantaya ucch kaary kushalta ke saath ucch prabhaavapurntaa hoti he jo ki sabhi prabandhakon kaa lakshya hota he
 But unduly emphasizing high work efficiency without effectiveness is also undesirable
 kamjor prabandhan prabhaavapurntaa evam kaarykushal dona kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 After studying some definitions, we get to know some elements which we call the basic features of management
 prabandh kuch uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kaary karata he
 Objectives are the expected results of any action
 inhen vyavsaay ke mul prayojan se praapt kiya janaa chahie
 Any organization has different objectives and management has to achieve all these objectives effectively and efficiently
 uddeshyon ko sanghathanaatmak uddeshy, saamaajik uddeshy evam vyaktigat uddeshyon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The management is responsible for determining and accomplishing the objectives for the organization
 ise sabhi kshetren ke anek prakaar ke uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa hota he tathaa sabhi hitarthiyon jaise-anshadhari, karmchaaree, graahak, sarkaar aadi ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 The main objective of any organization should be to utilize human and material resources for maximum possible benefit
 jiskaa taatpary he vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ko puraa karnaa
 These objectives are - to keep oneself alive, to earn profit and to grow
 kisi bhi vyavsaay kaa aadharbhoot uddeshy apane astitv ko banaae rakhana hota he
 Management should strive towards the survival of the organization
 iske liye sanghathan ko paryaapt dhan kamanaa chahie jisase ki laagton ko puraa kiya ja sake
 It is not enough for business to survive
 prabandh ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki sanghathan laabh kamaaye
 Profit serves as an important impetus for the continued successful operation of the enterprise
 laabh vyavsaay kii laagat evam jokhimon ko puraa karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Increasing your prospects in the long term is very important for the business
 iske liye vyavsaay kaa badhanaa bahut mahatva rakhata he
 Management should take full advantage of the potential of organization development to remain in the industry
 vyavsaay ke vikaas ko vikray aavart, karmchaariyon kii sankhya main vruddhi yaa phir utpaadon kii sankhya yaa poonji ke nivesh main vruddhi aadi ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 Creating benefits for society
 sanghathan chaahe vyavsaayik he athwa gaiyr vyavsaayik, samaaj ke ang hone ke kaaran use kuch saamaajik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 This means creating favorable economic values for different parts of society
 isamen sammilit hai- utpaadan ke paryaavaran bhinn paddati apnaanaa, samaaj ke logon se vanchit virgon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa evam karmchaariyon ke liye vidhyalay, shishugrih jaisi suvidhaayen pradaan karnaa

 sanghathan un logon se milakar banataa he jinase unka vyaktitv, prishthbhumi, anubhav evam uddeshy alag-alag hote hai
 All these become part of the organization to satisfy their diverse needs
 yah pratiyogi vetan evam anya laabh jaisi vittiya aavashyaktaaon se lekar saathiyon dwaara manyata jaisi saamaajik aavashyaktaaon evam vyaktigat badhotaree evam vikaas jaisi ucch stareey aavashyaktaaon ke rup main alag-alag hoti hai
 Management has to match individual objectives with organizational objectives to align with the organization
 prabandh ek saarvbhaumik kriya he jo kisi bhi sanghathan kaa abhinn ang he
 Now we will study some of the reasons why management has become so important- prabandh itnaa hi purana he jitani kii sabhyataa
 Although the origin of modern organization is new, but organized work has been taking place since ancient times of civilization
 vastav main sanghathan ko vishisht lakshan mana ja saktaa he jo sabhy samaaj ko asabhy samaaj se alag karata he
 The early practices of management were the rules and laws that emerged from the experience of government and commercial activities
 vyapaar evam vaanijya ke vikaas se kramshah prabandh ke siddhant evam vyavhaaron kaa vikaas hua
 The word 'prabandha' is used today in many meanings which highlight various aspects of its nature
 prabandh ke adhyayan kaa vikaas beete samay main aadhunik sanghathanon ke saath-saath hua he
 It has been based on both the experience and behavior of managers and the associated set of principles
 beete samay main iskaa ek gatisheel vishay ke rup main vikaas hua he
 Which has its own special characteristics
 lekin prabandh kii prakruti se sambandhit ek prashn kaa uttar dena aavashyak he ki prabandh vigyaan he yaa kala he yaa phir donon he? iskaa uttar dene ke liye aaie vigyaan evam kala donon kii visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen tathaa dekhen ki prabandh kahan tak inaki purti karata he
 What is art Art is the personal and efficient use of current knowledge to achieve desired results
 ise adhyayan, avlokan evam anubhav se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Now, because art is concerned with personal use of knowledge, a kind of originality and creativity is required to put into practice the fundamental principles studied
 kala ke aadharbhoot lakshan is prakaar hai- Art assumes that there is some theoretical knowledge already
 visheshgyon ne apane-apane kshetron main kuch moolbhoot siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jo ek vishesh prakaar kii kala main prayukt hota he
 For example, literature on dance, public address / speech, art or music is acceptable
 is moolbhoot gyaan kaa upyog vyakti, vyakti ke anusaar alag-alag hota he
 Art is, therefore, a very personal concept
 udhaaharan ke liye do nartak, do vaktaa, do kalakaar athwa do lekhakon kii apni kala ke pradarshan main bhinnata hogi
 All art is practical
 kala vartmaan siddhanton ko gyaan kaa rachanaatmak upyog he
 We know that music is based on seven notes
 lekin kisi sangeetkaar kii sangeet rachana vishisht athwa bhinn hoti he yah is baat par nirbhar karti he ki in suron kaa kis prakaar se sangeet srijan main prayog kiya gaya he, jo ki uski apni vyakhya hoti he
 Management is an art because, it fulfills the following characteristics- prabandhak ek krambaddh gyaan-samooh he kinhin saamaanya satya athwa saamaanya siddhanton ko spasht karata he vigyaan kii moolbhoot visheshtaayen nimna hai- Science is a hierarchical set of knowledge
 iske siddhant kaaran evam parinaam ke bich main sambandh aadhaarit hai
 For example, the occurrence of the apple falling from the tree to Earth gives rise to the principle of gravity
 vaigyanik siddhanton ko pehle avlokan ke madhyam se viksit kiya jaataa he or phir niyantrit paristhitiyon main baar-baar pareekshan kar uski jaanch kii jaati he
 Scientific theories are universal for validity and application
 uparyukt visheshtaon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai prabandh vigyaan ke rup main kuch visheshtaon ko dhaaran karata he- It is necessary to manage all types of organization processes
 aapane yah bhi avlokan kiya hoga ki sanghathanon ko unka prabandh karne ke liye kuch vishisht yogyataon evam anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You may have also noticed that on the one hand there has been an increase in the corporate form and on the other hand more emphasis is being placed on managing the business
 kya iskaa arth yah hua ki prabandh ek pesha he? is prashn kaa uttar jaanane ke liye aaie peshey kii pramukh visheshtaon kaa adhyayan karen evam dekhen ki kya prabandh inako puraa karata he
 The following are the characteristics of the profession sabhi peshey bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit gyaan ke samooh par aadhaarit hote hai jise shiksha se arjeet kiya ja saktaa he
 Admission to the profession is limited by examination or educational qualification
 udhaaharan ke liye bharat main yadi kisi ko chartered accountint bananaa he to use bhartiya chartered accountint santhaan dwaara yojit kii jane vaali ek vishesh pariksha ko paas karnaa hoga
 All professions are associated with one or the other councils, which regulate their entry, issue certificates to work and prepare and implement the Aadhaar Code
 bharat main vakaalat karne ke liye vakeelon ko baar council kaa sadsy bananaa hota he jo unke kaaryon kaa niyaman evam niyantran karata he
 All professions are bound by a code of conduct that gives direction to the behavior of their members
 udhaaharan ke liye jab doctor apane peshey main pravesh karte hai to vah apane kaary naitikta kii shapath lete hai
 The basic purpose of the profession is loyalty and commitment and the interests of its customers
 ek vakil yah sunishchit karata he ki uske muvakkil ko nyaay mili
 Management does not fully meet the principles of the profession
 vaise isamen kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai jo nimna hai- Management is a universal term used in a group of relationships in an enterprise by people connected to each other to perform certain tasks
 prayek-vyakti kaa sambandhon kii is shrunkhlaa main kisi na kisi kaary vishesh ko puraa karne kaa uttardaayitv hota he
 In order to fulfill this responsibility, he is given some rights ie decision making authority
 adhikaar evam uttardaayitv kaa yah sambandh vyaktiyon ko adhikari evam adhinsth ke rup main ek duusare ko bandhate hai
 This creates different levels in the organization
 kisi sanghathan ke adhikaar shrunkhlaa main teen str hote hai- High Level Management - These are the senior most executive officers of the organization who are called by many names
 yah saamanytah chairman, mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, mukhya prachaalan adhikari, pradhan, uppradhan aadi ke naam se jane jate hai
 High management is a team of managers of different functional levels
 unka mul kaary sanghathan ke kul uddeshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn tatwon main ekta evam vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa he
 These high level managers are responsible for the welfare and continuity of the organization
 form ke jivan ke liye ye vyavsaay ke paryaavaran evam uske prabhaav kaa vishleshan karte hai
 They formulate the goals and armaments of the new organization for their achievement
 vyavsaay ke sabhi kaaryon evam unke samaaj par prabhaav ke liye ye hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 The task of higher management is complex and stressful
 isamen lanbaa samay lagata he to sanghathan ke prati purnapatibaddhta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Middle level management- These are the link between upper managers and lower level, they are subordinate to upper managers and heads of first linear managers
 inhen saamanytah vibhaag pramukh, parichaalan prabandhak athwa sanyantr adheekshak kehete hai
 Middle level managers are responsible for the implementation of control plans and armaments developed by higher management
 iske saath-saath ye pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke sabhi kaaryon ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Their main task is to complete the plans prepared by the higher level managers
 iske liye Supervisory or Operations Manager - Foremen and supervisors come at the lower level in the authority line of the organization
 paryvekshak kaarybal ke kaaryon kaa pratyaksh rup se avlokan karte hai
 Their rights and duties are determined by schemes made by higher managers
 paryvekshan, prabandhakon kii sanghathan main mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he kyonki yah sidhe vaastavik kaary bal se samvaad karte hai evam madhya stareey prabandhakon ke dishanirdeshon ko karmchaariyon tak pahunchaate hai
 By these efforts, the quality of the product is maintained, the loss of goods is kept to a minimum and the level of safety is maintained
 kaarigari kii gunvattta, evam utpaadan kii maatr karmchaariyon ke parishram, anushaasan evam swamibhakti par nirbhar karti he
 Management is considered as the process of planning, organization, direction and control of tasks from members to the organization and the use of resources of the organization for achieving the set objectives
 yah pehle se hi yah nirdhaarit karne kaa kaary he ki kya karnaa he, kis prakaar tathaa kisko karnaa he
 This means setting objectives in advance and setting a path to achieve them efficiently and effectively
 suhasini ke sanghathan kaa uddeshy he paramparaagat bhartiya hathkargha evam hastshilp kii vastuon ko kharidkar unhen bechnaa
 He sells woven garments, decoration items, garments and household articles made from traditional Indian clothes
 suhasini inaki maatr, inke vibhinn prakaar, rang evam banaavat ke sambandh main nirnay leti he phir vibhinn aapurtikartaaon se unke kray athwa unke ghar main taiyaar karaane par sansadhano kaa aavanton karti he
 No one can prevent planning problems from occurring, but they can be anticipated and they can form contingency plans whenever they arise
 yah nirdhaarit yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye kaary saunpane, kaaryon ko samoohon main baantne, adhikaar nishchit karne evam sansadhano ke aavanton ke kaary kaa prabandhan karata he
 Once a specific plan is prepared to meet the objectives of the organization, then the organization will examine the actions and resources necessary for the implementation of the plan
 yah aavashyak kaaryon evam sansadhano kaa nirdhaaran karegaa
 It decides who will do what work, where it will be done and when
 sanghathan main aavashyak kaaryon ko prabandh ke yogya vibhaag evam kaary ikaiyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he evam sanghathan kii adhikaar shrunkhlaa main adhikaar evam vivaran dene ke sambandhon kaa nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Appropriate techniques of organization help in completion of work and promotion of operational efficiency and effectiveness completion of results
 vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon ko kaary kii prakruti ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn dhaanchon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 You will read more about this in further chapters
 saral shabdon main iskaa arth he sahi kaary ke liye uchit vyakti ko foondnaa
 An important aspect of management is to ensure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right place and time to achieve the objectives of the organization
 ise maanav sansaadhan kaary bhi kehete hai tathaa isamen karmchaariyon kii bhartee, chayan, kaary par niyukti evam prashikshan sammilit hai
 Infosys Technology, which develops software, requires system analysts and programmers, while Labmart requires a team of designers and craftspeople
 nideshan kaa kaary karmchaariyon ko netritv pradaan karnaa, prabhavit karnaa evam abhiprerit karnaa he jisase ki vah supurd kaary ko puraa kar saken
 This requires creating an environment that inspires employees to function optimally
 abhiprerana evam netritv-nirdesan ke do mul tatv hai
 Motivating employees simply means creating an environment that motivates them to work
 netritv kaa arth he dusron ko is prakaar se prabhavit karnaa, ki vah apane netaa ke icchit kaary sampann karen
 a good manager, with the help of praise and criticism, directs in such a way that employees can contribute their best
 suhasini ke dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii chaadaron ke liye silk par bhadkile rangon ke chaape viksit kiye
 Although it looked very attractive, but due to the use of silk, it was very expensive for the common man
 unke kaary kii prashansa karte hue suhasini ne unhen suzav diya ki in silk kii chaadaron ko vah deepawali, christmas jaise vishesh avasaron ke liye sahej kar rakhen tathaa unhen niyamit rup se sooti vastren par chhaapen
 Control is defined as the act of managing in which it directs the execution of organization work to achieve the goals of the organization
 niyantran kaary main nishpaadan ke str nirdhaarit kiye jate hai, vartmaan nishpaadan ko mapa jaataa he
 It is matched to predefined levels and corrective steps are taken in the event of deviation
 iske liye prabandhakon ko yah nirdhaarit karnaa hoga ki safalataa ke liye kya kaary evam utpaadan mahatvapurn hai, uskaa kaise or kahan maapan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sudharatmak kadam uthaane ke liye koun adhikrut he
 When Suhasini found that his team of designers made a bed sheet that was more expensive than the fixed price for his sale, he changed the cloth for the sheet to control costs
 prabandhak ke vibhinn kaaryon par saadharantaya uparokt kram main hi charchaa kii jaati he jiske anusaar ek prabandhak pehle yojana taiyaar karata he; phir sanghathan banaata he; tatpashchaat nirdesan karata he; or ant main niyantran karata he
 In fact the manager rarely performs these tasks one by one
 prabandhak ke kaary ek duusare se jude hai tathaa yah nishchit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he koun-sa kaary kahan samaapt hua tathaa koun-sa kaary kahan se prarambh hua
 In the process of managing an organization, a manager has to perform five tasks related to each other
 sanghathan ek aisi paddati he jo ek duusare se jude evam ek duusare par aadhaarit upapaddatiyon se bani he
 The manager has to connect these different groups to achieve the same objectives
 vibhinn vibhaagon kii gatividhiyon kii ekaatmakataa kii prakriya ko samanvay kehete hai
 Coordination is the power that binds all other functions of management to each other
 yah aisa dhaagaa he jo sanghathan ke kaary main nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye kray, utpaadan, vikray evam vitt jaise sabhi kaaryon ko piroe rakhata he
 Coordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management
 lekin yah prabandh kaa saar he kyonki yah samuhik lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kiye gaye vyaktigat prayatnon main ekta laata he
 Each managerial task is an activity that contributes to the coordination in itself
 samanvay kisi bhi sanghathan ke sabhi kaaryon main lakshith evam anternihit hai
 The process of coordinating the actions of the organization starts with planning
 ucch prabandh puure sanghathan ke liye yojana banaata he
 According to these plans organization structures are developed and employees are appointed
 yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan yojana ke anusaar hi yah sunishchit karne ke liye nirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If there is any difference between the actual actions and their achievements, it is resolved at the time of control
 samanvay kii kriya ke madhyam se prabandh kaa samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye uthaae gaye kadamon main ekta ko sunishchit karne ke liye vyaktigat evam samuhik prayatnon kii sahi vyavastha karata he, samanvay sanghathan kii vibhinn ikaayiyon ke bhinn-bhinn kaaryon evam prayatnon main ekta sthapit karata he
 It provides the required amount of effort, quantity, time and serialization that ensures the minimum attainment of planned objectives
 uparokt paribhaashaon se samanvay kii nimna visheshtaayen spasht hoti hai- Co-ordination brings togetherness in collective work - Coordination brings interests that are not related to each other or different from each other, unity in objective work activity
 yah samooh ke kaaryon ko ek kendra bindu pradaan karata he jo yah sunishchit karata he ki nishpaadan yojana evam nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar ho
 Coordination brings unity in action - The objective of coordination is to bring unity in action to achieve the same objectives
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon ko jodne kii shakti kaa kaary karata he tathaa yah sunishchit karata he ki sabhi kriyaayein sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii jaaen
 You found that the production and sales departments of Labmart have to coordinate their work so that production can be done as per the market demand
 samanvay nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he- samanvay koi ek baar kaa kaary nahin he balki ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 It starts with planning and runs till control
 suhasini thand ke samay ke liye vastren ke sambandh main june ke maheene main hi yojana bana leti he
 She then arranges for an adequate workforce
 utpaadan yojana ke anusaar hi iske liye lagaataar nigaraanee rakhti he use apane vipanan vibhaag ko samay rahete bataanaa hoga ki vah vikray pravartan evam vigyaapan ke prachaar ke liye taiyaar karen
 Coordination is a universal task - the actions of different departments depend on each other by nature, hence coordination is required at all levels of management
 yah vibhinn vibhaagon evam vibhinn staron ke kaaryon main ekta sthapit karata he
 Suhasini has to coordinate the works of the purchasing, production and sales departments in order to achieve opposition to the organization's purpose
 kray vibhaag kaa kaary kapadaa khareednaa he
 This becomes the basis for the activities of the production department and finally the sale becomes possible
 yadi kapadaa ghatiya gunvattta vaala he yaa phir utpaadan vibhaag dwaara nirdhaarit vishistataaen liye hue nahin he to isse aage kii bikri kam ho jaaegi
 If there is no coordination, there will be repetition and chaos in place of unity and integration in actions
 samanvay sabhi prabandhakon kaa uttardaayitv he- kisi bhi sanghathan main samanvay prayek prabandhak kaa kaary he ucch str ke prabandhak yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sanghathan kii nitiyon kaa kriyanvayan ho, apane adhinsthon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Middle-level managers coordinate with both upper-level managers and first-line managers
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki kaary yojanaon ke anusaar kiya jaae, prachaalan str ke prabandhak apane karmchaariyon ke kaaryon main samanvay karte hai
 Coordination is a thought-provoking task - a manager has to coordinate the actions of different people carefully and thoughtfully
 kisi vibhaag main sadsy swechha se ek duusare se sahyog karte hue kaary karte hai, samanvay is sahyog kii bhaavana ko dishanirdesh detaa he
 In the absence of coordination, cooperation will also prove fruitless and coordination without cooperation will lead to dissatisfaction among the employees
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki samanvay, prabandh kaa pruthak se ek kaary nahin he balki yah uskaa saar he
 If an organization wants to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently, it will require coordination
 maala main dhaage ke samaan hi samanvay prabandh ke sabhi kaaryon kaa abhinn ang he
 Integrating various managerial functions ensures adequate coordination among individuals and departments
 jaise samanvay kii samasya ke paidaa hone ke kaaran bade paimaane ke sanghathan main antarnihit nirantar parivartan kamjor athwa niskriy netritv evam jatiltaayen hai
 Coordinating these kinds of complexities in large organizations requires special efforts
 sanghathan kaa aakaar-bade sanghathanon main lage badi sankhya main log samanvay kii samasya ko jatil bana dete hai
 Each person is unique in itself
 tathaa apni evam sanghathan kii aavashyaktaaon ko mahasoos karata he
 Each has his / her own working habits, his / her background, proposals / ways of dealing with situations and relationships with others
 vaise ek akelaa vyakti sadaa budhimaani se kaary nahin karata he
 His behavior is neither always well understood nor fully predictable
 isliye sanghathan kii kaary kushalta ke liye yah anivaary he ki vyakti evam samooh ke uddeshyon ko samanvay dwaara ekikrut kar diya jaae
 Functional Differentiation - The functions of the organization are repeatedly divided into departments, divisions, sections etc
 samanvay kii samasya isliye paidaa hoti he kyonki adhikaar kshetren kaa drudhikaran ho jaataa he or unke bich ke avarohak or bhi adhik majboot ho jate hai
 Many times this is because the classification of tasks is not tactical or the managers do not follow a logical path, but take the path of experience
 aise maamalon main sanghathan main prabhavi dhang se kaary karne ke liye samanvay aavashyak he
 Specialization - There is a high degree of specialization in modern organizations
 vishishtikaran kaa janm aadhunik takneekon kii jatiltaaon tathaa kaaryon evam inhen karne waalon kii vividhta ke kaaran hota he
 Experts think that they are capable of testing each other on the basis of profession but other people may not have any adequate basis for such a decision
 yadi visheshgyon ko bina samanvay ek bhumandaleey prabandhak ke saamne chunauti ke kaary karne kii anumati de di jaae to parinaam kaaphi manhage honge
 That is why a composition mechanism is needed to coordinate the work of various experts engaged in the organization
 samanvay prabandh kaa saar he
 This is not something a manager may order
 balki yah to vah cheez he jise ek prabandhak niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan niyantran kaaryon ko karte hue praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Hence each task is a practice of coordination
 sanghathan evam inke prabandh main parivartan aa rahaa he
 As the boundaries of different cultures and countries are getting blurred and new technologies of communication can be considered as a global village
 antarrashtriya evam antar samskruti sambandh bhi teji se bad rahe hai
 Today's organization is a global organization that is managed in the global scenario
 saransh main kah sakate hai ki ek vaishvik prabandhak vah he jiske paas ‘hard’ evam ‘soft’ donon prakaar kaa kaushal hai
 Managers who have knowledge of analyzing, analyzing, engineering and technology are still needed today, but how teams work in individuals, how organizations work and how they can motivate people for worldwide success
 It is very important to have understanding of everyone
 udhaaharan ke liye jo prabandhak vibhinn samskritiyon main paith rakhata he vah pashchimi europe, gaiyr angreji bolne vaale desh main kaary kar saktaa he phir malaysia athwa kenya jaise vikasshil deshon main ja saktaa he or phir use neuyark, you- es- e- ke karyaalay main hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 He will be able to work effectively at these three places immediately
 vaishvik prabandhak kii bhoomika kaa vikaas usee prakaar se hua he jis prakaar se vaishvik udyog evam arthvyavastha kaa vikaas hua he
 It has transformed from a one-dimensional role to a multi-faceted role in the context of a defined occupation which requires a combination of technical skills, soft management and skills and learning and learning of different cultures
