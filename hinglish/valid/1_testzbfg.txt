 The NSA played a major role in the debate concerning the export of seed writing in the 1990s
 1996 main niryaat par pratibandh kam kar die gaye the lekin hataae nahin gaye the
 The NSA was embroiled in some minor controversies related to its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard, a standard and public basic seed-writing algorithm used by the US government and the banking community
 1970 ke dashak main IBM dwaara DES ke vikaas ke dauraan NSA ne dizin ke kuch vivaranon main badlaav kii sifarish kii thi
 It is expected that these changes have sufficiently weakened the algorithm to allow the agency to eavesdrop when needed, as well as speculation that an important tool - the so-called s-box - would include a "burglar" Changes were made for and that a reduction in the length of the original key would have enabled the NSA to discover the DES key using huge computing power
 Since then it has been observed that the S-box in DES is particularly flexible towards differential cipher analysis, a technique that was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s, but was known to the IBM, DES team

 In late 2009, the NSA reclassified the information, stating that NSA worked with IBM to strengthen algorithms against all but the rest of the coercive force attacks and replacement tables called S-boxes
 In contrast, NSA tried to persuade IBM to reduce the key length from 64 to 48 bits

 Due to concerns over the possibility of government use of wiretaps being hindered by the widespread use of strong seed writing, the NSA introduced the Escrow Concept in 1993 and offered a clipper chip, which would provide even stronger protection than DES but authorized The law will allow security officers to access encrypted data

 However, nsa's Fortezza hardware-based encryption card built for the Clipper project is still in use by the government, and eventually NSA published the design of the SKIPJACK cipher

 akushal dharm jo ki dey he prahatavya hai
 The efficient religion to be practiced is Bhavitavya
 kushal dharm jinka abhyaas karnaa he, bhavitavya he
 Meditation, Vimoksha, Marg Phaladi Dharma and especially Nirvana are personal duties is anubhuti kii prapti se chaar prakaar kii patisambhidaayen sahaayak hoti hai - dhamm-patisambhida, atth patisambhida, nirutti patisambhida or patibhaan-patisambhida 
 Knowledge of all religious practices is necessary for the realization of the essence
 isaki prapti dhamm patisambhida se hoti he
 Enters the depth of the meaning of religions

 Both religion and meaning are dependent on language

 This is possible from Niruti Patisambhida

 There are three waggas of the Patisambhidamagg, named by the magnitude
 mahavagg, majjhimvagg or chullavagg
 The second and third are also called Yuganadhavagga and Mahapanavagagga respectively
 prayek vagg ke das das vibhaag hai, jo kathaayen kehalaate hai, ve nimna prakaar hai- 1
 Mahavagga: Jnanakatha, Vittikatha, Aanapanasatikatha, Indriyakatha, Vimokkhakatha, Gatikatha, Kammakatha, Vipallasakatha, Maghakkatha and Mandapayyakatha
 2
 majjhim vagg : yuganddhakatha, sachhakatha, bojangkatha, mettakatha, viragakatha, patisambhidakatha, dhammachakkakatha, lokutarakatha balakatha or summakatha
 3
 Chullavagga: Mahapanakatha, Idthikatha, Abhisamayakatha, Vivekatha, Chariakatha, Patihariyakatha, Samasicakatha Satipatthanakatha Vipassanakatha and Matikakatha
 kathaayen krambaddh hai
 According to Atthakatha, in 30 legends, the scripture has been given the first place because the right vision is the first part of the Buddha-guided path
 gyaan se mithyaadrushti dur ho jaati he
 Therefore Vittikatha is given only after the scripture
 mithyaadrushti ke dur hone se chitt samadhisth hota he
 Satipathana has a prominent place in Samadhibhavana
 isaliye dittikatha ke baad hi anapanastiktha di gai he
 Faithful memory is reinforced by the practice of the five senses

 isaliye indriyakatha ke baad hi vimokkhakatha di gai hai
 Not all the living beings can attain salvation
 jo sugatiyon main janm lete hai, ye hi use praapt kar sakate hai
 That is why the story is given only after the democracies
 kisi jeev kii gati uske karmanusaar hoti he
 That is why the story is given only after the story
 chaar prakaar ke viparyason ke kaaran jeev karmsanchay karte hai
 Therefore, the Vipallas Katha and the Magha Katha are given after the Kammakatha
 is vagg kii antim katha mandapey katha he
 Mand means essence
 iskaa prog sarabhoot aryamarg ke liye hua he
 Similarly, serialization of other stories has also been shown
 in kathaon main varnit adhikansh vishay ek na ek sutt par ashrith hai
 In fact, the subject has been interpreted as a description of a Sutta
 in vyakhyaaon kaa bada mahatv he
 That is why later descriptions of Patisabhidamagg are mentioned in the description of those subjects
 vishuddhimaarg main to inaki bahulata he
 The style of patisambhidamagg, which is analytical, resembles the style of abhidhamma
 isaliye kuch vidwaanon ne ise abhidhamm pitak ke antargat karne kii upyuktata bataai he
 But, as mentioned above, the description of each subject is based on a rough principle
 kahin kahi dharm paryaayon kaa vishleshan abhidharm pranali kii drushti se bhi hua he
 Keeping these things in mind, we can say that this book must have been composed in the Middle Ages, after the collection of ancient sattanas and before the editing of the Abhidharmapitaka
 atthkatha main sariputt ther ko patisambhidamagg kaa rachayita bataaya gaya he
 Modern scholars are not willing to accept this
 lekin atthkatha kii manyata bhi niraadhaar nahin he
 The style of this book is similar to the style of sattantas of Sariputta Ther
 sanmaditthi, sampasadaniya sangeetipariyaay, dasuttar or mahavedall sutt iske katipay udhaaharan hai
 Yes, the principles of God and some of his other disciples are also stored in it, but only the principles of Sariputta Ther are prominent
 sambhavat: isi baat ke kaaran pracheen parampara sariputt ther ko patisambhidamagg kaa rachayita bataane ke paksh main rahi hogi

 kuch prasiddh kahaniyon ke vishay main narendra kohli dwaara rachit samiksha pustak he
 Haldwani Malli is a village in Nainital district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Haldwani tehsil of India
 shuddh vidhi kaa siddhanth vidhi-siddhantkaar hens kelson dwaara rachit ek pustak he jo sarvapratham 1934 main prakashit hui thi
 Its second edition came in 1960
 is pustak main kanoon kaa jo siddhanth pratipaadit kiya gaya he vah sambhavtah 20veen shadi kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee vidhi-siddhanth he
 According to Freedman, the main features of pure law theory are - kelson ke anusaar nishchayatmak vidhi sambandhi kathan na to naitik or raajnneetik mulya sambandhi kathan he or na hi tathy sambandhi
 It is said to be 'pure' in that it distinguishes all external elements from it in recognition of the deterministic method
 kelson ke anusaar shuddh vidhi ke siddhanth kii seemaa or sangyaan yaa anubhuti do dishaao main nishchit kii jaani chahie
 The specific science of law — called Vidhishastra — should be separated from philosophy of justice on the one hand and cognition of sociology or social reality on the other
 nyaay ko kelson ne ayuktiparak adarsh mana he kyonki yah kahana ki nyaay jaisi vastu he parantu use paribhaashit nahin karnaa swayan main antervirodh kaa dyotak he
 According to Kelsen, the theory of law cannot answer the question of which elements of justice are formed because this question is not scientifically acceptable
 yadi nyaay kaa koi vaigyanik taur par arthpurna naam detaa he to vidhimanyata ke rup main uski pahchaan aavashyak he
 According to Kelsen it is appropriate for a rule to be used as a general rule in every case in which it is expected according to its contents
 is tarah ‘‘nyaay’’ kaa taatpary shuddh antajkaran se iske prayog dwaara nishchayatmak vyavastha ko kaayam karnaa he
 Therefore, Kelsen has sought to separate the normative element from the method and maintain its purity and explain the "method that is" and not the "method that should be"
 kelson ne apni adhyayan pranali kaa lakshya vidhi ke vigyaan se raajnneetik or aadarshatmak tatwon ko alag karne tak simit nahin rakhaa
 Going a step further, he tried to make the principle of law independent of all elements other than law
 kelson ke anusaar ‘‘aalochanatmak dhang se vidhi kaa siddhanth manovigyaan, samajashaastra, nitishastra or raajnneetik siddhanth ke tatwon ke saath mishrit ho gaya he
 He stressed the identity of pure legal elements by completely separating these elements from the work of jurists and judges and restoring the purity of the method
 kelson kaa yah maananaa he ki vidhi ke saath anya vidhaon kaa apmishran samajhane yogya he kyonki in vidhaon se sambandhit saamagree kaa vidhi se gaharaa sambandh he
 He has also clarified that narrowing the scope of knowledge of the law by the principle of pure law against these genres is not aimed at denying or ignoring relations but rather without criticizing various disciplines according to the method of study The mixture has been used to remove it because it obscures or obscures the essence of the science of the method and the method's dissolution
 Depending on the nature of the content, it eliminates certain limits on it
 aniruddh prasad ne apni pustak main kelson kii nimnlikhit aalochanayen sangruhit kii he :- According to Dias, the importance of Kelsen's theory of pure method is that it reveals a refined and cultured form of theistic ideology and maintains the purity of the method by shocking the tradition of the method of mixing unnecessary with other subjects of the method prevalent in the early twentieth century
 Attempts freedman ne mana ki kelson ke shuddh vidhi ke siddhanth kaa pramukh gun uske dwaara praarambhik prasthaapana he jise samudaay kaa mul raajnneetik siddhanth mana ja saktaa he or usase praapt vidhik sambandhon kii sampoornataa ke parsparik sambandhon kaa spashtikaran he
 According to Freedman the concept of method as a progressive process is very useful
 iske dwaara ek taraf grey or american yathartwaadiyon ke parinaamon ko auchity miltaa he to duusari taraf mahadwipiya samajashastreey siddhanton dwaara duusare drushtikon se nikaale gayi parinaamon ko auchity miltaa he
 Modern political and jurisprudential approaches have accepted relativity or flexibility in the relationship between justice and administration, physical and legal personality, public law and private law, and the creative and executive functions of judges
 yahi kaaran he ki vibhinn kshetron or vibhinn drushtikonon ke vidhishastriyon- grey, homes, iharlich, duggit, jenings or barker ne kelson ke moortakaran ke siddhanth ke samaan parinaam nikaala
 The ruthlessness with which Kelsen uncovered the political ideology hidden in the legal ideologies engaged in the pursuit of absolute truth had a very healthy effect on the whole field of jurisprudence
 prakritik vidhi kii vichaardhaara, antarararashtriya vidhi kii vichaardhaara, nigamit vyaktitv kaa siddhanth, lok vidhi or nijee vidhi se sambandhit vichaar, shaayad hi koi iske prabhaav se achoota rahaa ho
 This forced him to rethink his position in all areas related to the doctrine of law
 kelson kaa dhyey aavashyak vidhik vyavastha kii sanrachana ke tatwon kaa is tarah vishleshan karnaa he ki yah vidhik vyavastha ke aupchaarik tark kii bodhgamy prastuti kaa ekmaatr madhyam prathit ho
 Needless to say, despite various criticisms, its basic principles that legal law is equivalent to standards and that legal law is a group of such rules, which have a contradictory meaning, seem to be fundamentally firm
 paton ke anusaar kelson ne vidhishastra ke kshetra main moulik or mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 Kelsen, with his critical talent, uncovered many misconceptions in the jurisprudence

 Finally, the nature of 'self-realization' and the fruit derived from its worship is considered
 pratham adhyay main gautam rishi evam garg rishi ke praputra chitra ke sanvaadon dwaara 'brahmagyaan' ke liye kiye jane vaale agnihotra tathaa uski falshruti par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 When the seeker reaches Brahmaloka after his death, he is confronted by Apsaras and Brahmaji seated on a strange wall
 vah unase baaten karata he
 This conversation is also known as 'pravink-vidya'
 garg rishi ke praputra, maharishi chitra, yajna karne kaa nishchay karke arun ke putr mahatma uddalak ko pradhan ruthvik ke rup main aamantrit karte hai, parantu muni uddalak swayan na jaakar apane putr shwethaketu ko yajna sampann karaane ke liye bhej dete hai
 Shwetketu arrives at the behest of his father and sits on a high seat
 tab chitra usase prashn karata he-'he gautamakumar! is lok main koi aisa aavarnayukt sthaan he, jahaan tum mujhe le jaakar rakh sakate ho yaa phir usamen bhi koi aisa sarvatha pruthak or vilakshan aavaran se shunya pad he, jisko jaanakar tum usee lok main mujhe pratishthit kar sakate ho?' Saying this, Shwetketu left the posture of sacrifice and asked his father - 'oh Father! How should i answer the question that Maharishi Chitra has asked me? Shwetketu repeated the question of the picture to his father
 tab uddalak rishi ne kaha-'putr! main bhi iskaa uttar nahin jaanata
 Both of us will achieve this learning only by walking into the Yajshala of Maharishi Chitra and studying it
 'tadnantar donon pita-putr prasiddh aaruni muni ke haath se samidha grahan karke jigyaasu-bhav se maharishi chitra ke paas gayi or kaha ki ve vidya-prapti hetu unke paas aaye hai
 The picture said- 'O Gautam! You are highly revered among Brahmins and possess theology; Because coming to me, you do not have even a little pride of your superiority
 main nishchay hi aapako iskaa bodh karaungaa
 Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Vipraver! The person who is going to perform the rituals of Agnihotri, they all go from this world towards Chandralok, that is, heaven, but the person who is enamored of heavenly happiness accepts Chandralok, all his virtues are destroyed and he again : Falls back to this earth, that is, he is reborn again

 On the saying of Maharishi Chitra, Gautam Muni again asked - "O God! Tell me who i am Tell me the way to cross this Bhavsagar, so that i can be free from all the buildings
 ' maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! devyan maarg se jane vaala sadhak kramash: agnilok, vayulok, suryalok, varunalok, indralok va prajapatilok aadi chah lokon main se hota hua 'brahmalok' main pravesh kar paata he

 Here, even a moment's ego and bondage of work, anger, greed etc
 destroy all the virtues of the seeker
 'isht' kii prapti main yah jalashay sabase badi baadha he, parantu jo ise paar kar letaa he, vah phir se paavan viraja nadi ke kinare pahunch jaataa he
 All his labor and old age are overcome by mere sight of Virja river
 usamen aage 'ilya' naamak vriksh aata he
 This is the city with beautiful groves, gardens, baoli, koop, lake, river and reservoir etc
 of many deities, which is surrounded by Virja river and crescent park
 ye sabhi man ko baar-baar mohane ke liye saamne aate hai, kintu jo sadhak inamen lipt na hokar aage bad jaataa he, use saamne hi brahma ji kaa ek vishaal devalayas dikhaai padataa he
 The name of this temple is 'aparajita'
 surya kii prakhar rashmiyon se yukt hone ke kaaran ise vijit karnaa atyant kathin he
 It is protected by the clouds, the yajna, the air and the sky-form Indra and Prajapati, but the one who defeats them enters Brahmaloka
 vahaan ek vishaal vaibhav-sampann sabha-mandap ke madhya 'vichkshna' naamak vedi par sarvashaktimaan pranaswaroop brahma ji ek ati sundar singhaasana par virajman dikhaai padate hai
 Apsaras named Vishwa Janani Amba and Ambavayvi are engaged in their service, who welcome the Brahmavetta seeker and ornate him and present him to Brahma Ji
 'is upanishad main ek atyant sundar roopak baandhakar devyan maarg se brahmalok tak pahunchane kaa maarg dikhaaya gaya he
 It is here that the sage says that the man traveling in the chariot sees the wheels of the chariot running, but he does not see the coincidence of the speed of the wheels from the ground
 isi prakaar brahmalok kii yatra karne vaala sadhak rath par baithkar din or raat ko to dekhtaa he, kaal kii gati ko bhi dekhtaa he, paap-punya ko bhi dekhtaa he, parantu vah unamem lipt nahin hota
 He attains 'brahma' only by staying away from them
 kaam, krodh, lobh, moh or ahankaar uske maarg ke baadhak nahin banataa
 Maharishi's picture further says - 'O Gautam! The seeker becomes a Brahmavetta and experiences Brahmagandha, Brahmaras, Brahmatej, Brahmayash and Brahmnad in all his senses
 tab brahma ji us brahmagyani se prashn karte hai-'tum koun ho?' us samay brahma ji dwaara puche gayi prashnon kaa uttar brahmagyani ko is prakaar dena chahie— In this way, after answering all the questions of Brahma Ji, Lord Brahma himself says to the seeker that the famous 'five great' waters are my place
 at: yah meraa lok bhi jal aadi tatva dwaara pradhan he
 You are my worshiper integral to me
 at: yah tumhaara bhi lok he
 'thus that seeker acquires both' Jiti 'and' Vyushti 'of Brahma
 'maharishi chitra ne is prakaar 'brahmagyaan' kaa upadesh dekar gautam rishi ko abhibhoot kiya
 Sage Gautama, along with his son Shvetketu, returned after bowing to the Maharishi picture
 is adhyay main 'prantatva' kii upasna or 'brahmavidya' ke vyaavhaarik paksh par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In addition to this, 'suryopasana' to destroy his sins, for the son's skillful desire and safety, 'chandropasana', 'for good health', Somopasana, 'for salvation,' Pramanapasana 'and the son for his whole life While giving the burden of responsibility, 'sampradan Karma' has described very clearly
 prantatva kii upasnis adhyay main 'praan' ko hi 'brahm' kaa rup mana he
 Pran is conceived as a king
 'man' uskaa doot he, 'vaani' uski rani he, 'chakshu' uski suraksha karne vaale mantri hai, 'karnendriya' sandesh grahan karne vaale dwarpal hai
 As soon as the soul arrives, the service of all senses is automatically received by the king of life
 suprasiddh mahatma shushkabhingaar 'praan' ko hi brahm kaa rup sweekaar karte hai
 Therefore, the worship of life is going to give favored attainments
 jivan main shreshthata, sukh-samruddhi, yash, tejaswita tathaa gyaan pranopasna dwaara ho saktaa he
 Suryopasanakoshitki, through his experience, has said to perform Suryopasana thrice - morning, midday and evening
 unhone kaha he ki praat:kaal yagyopavit ko savy bhav se baayen kandhe par rakhkar aachman karen
 Then fill the water vessel thrice with pure water, offer arghya to the rising sun and chant this mantra - 'vardoshi in Vrgosi papamanam
 ' is prakaar madhyahnkaal main, bhagwaan bhaskar ko samaran karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen-' udvargosi papmanan main sanvruddhi
 Similarly, in the evening, worship the sun while setting and chant this mantra - 'ॐ Vriddhogऽsī Papamanam
 ' is prakaar suryopasna karne se manushya ke din-raat ke saare paapon kaa shaman ho jaataa he, paap karm na karne kii shakti utpann ho jaati he
 In Chandropasana Avamasya, when the sun is located in the western part and the moon is situated in the moon named Sushumna, then by this method one should perform Chandropasana
 arghya dene vaale paatr main do hari durva ke ankur bhi avashya rakh len
 Then chanting this mantra while offering Arghya - 'yatte Susimam Hridayamadhi Chandramamsishritam Tenamritattasyeshane Mahan Potramyadam Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii prarthana se upaask putr shok se bachaa rahata he tathaa putr na hone kii sthiti main putr-ratna praapt kar letaa he
 Somopasana Rishi has considered Somopasana to be the reason for a healthy body
 vah som se prarthana karata he-'he stri-rupi som! tum purush-rupi surya ke prakaash se vikaas ko praapt ho
 Be helpful in getting food from all sides
 he som! tum saumy gunon se yukt ho
 By attaining the glory of the Sun, your divine juice becomes very beneficial for men
 tum is divya ras kaa seven karne vaale purushon ko pushti do or unke sabhi shatruon kaa paraabhav karaane main puri tarah se sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You can help in the attainment of immortality while achieving happiness with fiery glory and set your fame in heaven
 he som! main tumhaari hi gati kaa anugaman karte hue apni dahini bhujaa ko baar-baar ghumata hum
 'the sage calls Soma the five-faced Prajapati
 uskaa ek mukh 'brahman' he, doosraa mukh 'kshatriya' hai, teesraa mukh 'baj' pakshi he, chauthaa mukh 'agni' he
 And the fifth face you are yourself
 is prakaar som kii prarthana karne ke uparant garbhaadhan ke liye tatpar stri ke paas baithne se pehle uske hriday kaa sparsh karen or is mantra kaa paath karen—'yatte sumime hridaye hitmant: prajapathu manyehan maa tadvidwansan ten maahan pautramadhan rudam
 'this kind of prayer never leaves the seeker mourning the son
 rishi kaa sanket us mata kii ore he, jo apana doodh apni santaan ko pilaati he
 His milk has a somerset-like defensive force
 usee se balak swasth rahata he
 Mother's milk is a natural process for the child
 prakruti kaa virodh anekanek bhayanak parinaamon kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 In the context of worshiping the mortal for salvation, the sage has shown the importance of life through a beautiful metaphor
 ek samay vaani aadi samast devtaa ahankaar ke vasheebhoot hokar apni-apni mahatt siddh karne ke liye paraspar vivaad karne lage
 Everyone was exited from the body with life
 unke nikal jane se sharir kashtha kii bhaanti chetana-rahit hokar so gaya
 'vani' entered the body alone to prove his supremacy
 vaani ke pravesh karte hi sharir vaani se bolne laga, lekin vah apane sthaan se uth nahin sakaa
 After this, the 'netriadriya' deity entered the body
 tab vah vaani se bolne or netron se dekhne laga, parantu is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then the 'shrotendiya' deity entered the body
 vah sunne laga, bolne bhi laga or dekhne bhi laga
 But even this time he could not get up, he was lying idle
 tatpashchaat us sharir main 'man' ne pravesh kiya
 Through the mind he became thinking, but this time also he could not get up
 tab sabase ant main 'praan' ne us sharir main pravesh kiya
 The body got up and sat as soon as that nature entered
 isse praanon kaa mahatva sarvopari siddh ho gayaan sabhi anya indriyon ne praan main hi, moksh aadi sadhana kii shakti ko sweekaar kiya
 He learned that immortality can be attained only by life and this body can rise up and go towards heaven
 praanon ke dwaara hi, sharir kii samast chetnaayen or indriyaan kaary karti hai
 Therefore, it is due to the association of Brahman by the worship of souls
 praanon ke dwaara hi vishisht gyaan-swaroop parabrahm ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sampradaya-karma by the father This chapter mentions the process of the father's succession to his son
 rishi kaa kahana he ki apana antim samay aayaa jaanakar, pita ko apane sampoorn uttardayitvon se mukt ho janaa chahie or jo kuch bhi uske paas he, use apane putr ko saunp dena chahie
 The son should also gladly accept the obligation left by his father
 pita ko chahie ki shubhr vastra dhaaran karke apane putr ko apane paas bulaaye or usase kahe-'he putr! main tumhen apni vaak shakti, apane praan, apane netra, apane kaan, apane rasaswadan, apane samast shreshth karm, apane sukh-du:kha, apni maithunjnya shakti tathaa rati-sukh, apni gatishiltaa, apni samast icchhaaen, apni buddhi, apana yash, brahmatej ou apana shreshth swasthya tathaa ann ko pachaane kii shakti aadi sabhi sadgun pradaan karata hum yaa tumhaare bheetar pratishthit karata hoon
 'when the father says this, the son should accept him politely and look towards his left shoulder and with his hands, he will say -' Father! You can get the heaven you desire and all the pleasures there
 ' iske uparant, yadi pita nirog ho, to vah apane putr ko ghar kaa swami banaakar athwa maanakar uske saath nivas kare yaa phir sabhi kuch tyagkar va ghar chhodkar sanyas kaa jivan bitaaye
 Such a father is about to turn to the divine when the time comes
 vastav main uttaradhikaar kaa sahi niyam yahi he
 In this chapter, the sage has given a detailed description of Prana, Pragya and Indri and analyzed their mutual relations
 iske liye samvaad-style kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Here, through the interactions between Indra and Divodas Raja's son Pratardan, Prana has been described as a form of wisdom and has said that public interest is possible only with this wisdom
 ek baar devasur sangram main, devaataaon kii sahaayta ke liye raja divodas ke putr pratardan swarglok gayi the
 Pleased with his unique martial arts and valor, Indra wanted to give him a boon
 is par pratardan ne kaha-'he devraj! jis shreshth var ko aap maanav-jati ke liye param kalyanyukt maanate hon, vaisaa hi koi shreshth var aap swayan hi mujhe pradaan karen
 After listening to Pratardan, Devraj Indra said - 'rajan! There is no person in this world who asks for a bride for the happiness of others
 aap koi aisa var maangen, jo aapke apane liye ho?'is par pratardan ne koi bhi var grahan karne se inkaar kar diya
 Seeing King Pratardan's ascension of truth, Devraj Indra said - "O Rajan! You know me, my true form? This is the best boon for mankind
 'devraj ke is kathan main pratardan ne pahachaanaa ki indra ne na jane kitne pathbhrasht asuron or rishi-muniyon ko dand diya, par ahankarviheen or nishkaami hone ke kaaran indra kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua
 Then he understood that the life which is lived, while doing unarmed deeds and outright ego, is only for human welfare
 at: lok-kalyankari vyakti ke liye nirabhimani or nishkaam karmi hona param aavashyak he
 Only such a person can achieve the true nature of Indra, that is, the soul-like soul, and even the greatest of sinful acts cannot affect him
 yadi daivik pravritiyon kii raksha ke liye kisi aattaayi vyakti kaa vadh bhi karnaa pade, to uskaa bhi paap nahin lagata
 Devraj Indra preached to Pratardan and said that whoever recognizes my true nature, never feels a sin; Because, 'I myself am a form of wisdom
 ' indra aage kahata he ki us praan tathaa shreshth gyaan se yukt aatmaswaroop ke rup main prakhyat, mujh indra kii, tum aayu ou amrit-rup se upasna karo
 He makes it clear that age is life, life itself is life and life itself is immortality
 is sharir main jab tak praan he, tabhi tak aayu he
 It is through this nature that the seeker goes to another world and attains the special pleasure of amritattattva
 jo vyakti 'aayu' or 'amrit' ke rup main indra kii upasna karata he, vah is lok main purnayu ko praapt karata he or swarg ke sukhon kaa paan karata he
 The importance of life in the body is of paramount importance
 yadi praan ke rahete sharir kaa koi ang nasht ho jaye, to bhi sharir jivit rahata he, parantu praan ke na rahane par, ek kshan bhi sharir kaa jivit rahanaa asambhav he
 Prana is the person who realizes action power
 praan hi gyaan main pravriti hone kii shakti detaa he
 It has been called 'pragya-swaroop Prana' or 'atma'
 at: jivan ke utthan ke liye pragna-swaroop is praan kii hi upasna kerani chahie
 Pragya and Prana both reside together in the body and leave this body together with the soul
 pranamya parabrahm kaa yahi darshan he or yahi vigyaan he
 This worship is the main source of public welfare
 sushupt avasthaa main, jab manushya soya hua hota he, tab sabhi indriyaan or gyaan, praan main samahit ho jate hai
 But when he awakens, then all kinds of knowledge, coming out of the soul, merge into their senses and the latent senses become aware
 ise upanishad main maranasann vyakti ke udhaaharan se samajhaayaa he
 a person who is in a dying state, his whole consciousness power leaves the senses and merges into the soul
 us samay vah na to sunata he, na dekhtaa he, na bolta he, ne haath-pair hilaa paata he, na uskaa mastishk hi kaam karata he
 This is the position of a meditation practitioner
 parantu jab vah maranasann vyakti rogon se chhutkaaraa paakar pun: jivit ho uthta he athwa vah dhyansth yogi phir se sahaj jivan main laut aata he, tab unki samast indriyaan apane-apane swabhaav ke anusaar phir se sajag ho uthati hai
 Be guided by the mind
 praan hi sarvapratham 'man' ko jaagrath karata he
 He controls and controls all the senses
 man kaa sidhaa sambandh 'pragna' se he or pragna kaa praan se
 In this way Prana, Pragya and Indri are interdependent
 praantatv se hi pragna he or pragna se hi samast indriyon ko sanchaalan hota he
 When 'prana' which is released from the body, it reverses, then at that time, it reverses with all these senses
 vaani sabhi naamon kaa, naak sabhi gandhon kaa, chakshu sabhi roopon kaa, kaan sabhi dhvaniyon kaa or man sabhi dhyansth vishyon kaa parityag kar detaa he
 Therefore, life is the soul, and wisdom is the soul, who resides in this body simultaneously
 sharir kii samast indriyon kaa parichaalan inhen ke dwaara hota he
 It is through wisdom that he attains cognition according to the nature of all the senses
 pragna ke abhaav main sabhi kaa astitv naganya ho jaataa he
 Without Prana or Pragya, no form, subject or sense can be attained
 jis prakaar rath kii nemi aron ke or are rath kii naabhi ke ashrith hote hai, usee prakaar ke samast indriyaan, pragna ke dwaara hi vidyaman hai
 This wisdom or life is the blissful and immortal form of God
 yah na to achche kaam se vruddhi paata he ou na bure kaary se sankuchit hota he
 It is paradoxical
 yah samast lokon kaa adhipati he or sabakaa swami he
 This soul is our soul
 ise jaanakar hi paramatma kii upasthiti ko anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 In this chapter, based on the conversation between a Brahmin sage named Gargya and the scholar King Ajatshatru of Kashi, the various powers of the universe have been mentioned in the dialogue style and accepted the 'soul' as 'brahma'
 garg gotra main utpann balaaka rishi ke putr kaa naam gargy rishi ke naam se prasiddh tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of the four Vedas
 ushinar pradesh unka nivasasthaan tha
 He often used to travel in different regions of the country
 kabhi matsay desh main, to kabhi kuru-paanchal main rahane pahunch jate the
 Once while wandering, he reached the Dabar of King Ajatshatru, the scholar of Kashi
 vahaan ve atyant ahankaarpurn vaani main raja se bole-'he rajan! main aapako 'brahmatatv' kaa upadesh duungaa
 On saying such a sage of Gargya, Kashi King Ajatshatru said - 'O Vipravar! For your preaching, i will give you a millenium with a good quality
 mujhe to prasannataa he ki ab tak brahmavidya ke shrota or dani ke rup main mithila naresh janak kaa hi naam tha
 Today, you have come to us and enhanced our pride like Videha Rajak
 ' 'brahmatatva' kaa upadesh dete hue rishi gargy or ajatshatru ke madhya is saprkaar vaartalap hua-rishi gargy—'he rajan! is suryamandal main jo antaryami parameshwar sthit he, main brahmabuddhi se usee kii sadhana karata hum
 'ajatashatru —' o Brahman! It's not like this
 yah shwet vastradhari surya to sabhi se mahaan he
 It is the head of all, centered in the highest position
 jo manushya is viraat purush kii is prakaar se aradhana karata he, vah sabase ucch sthiti main pahunchataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! In the lunar circle, who is this transcendental great man, i worship him as Brahman
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 This is the king of Soma and this is also the soul of the food main isi prakaar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, surely becomes the soul of the grain and the money is filled with grain
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! vidyut mandal ke antargat yah jo antaryami viraat parabrahm he, main usee kaa upaask hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! It's not like this
 main is vidyut ko 'prakaash kii aatma' maanakar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, he himself becomes a 'soul' in the form of light
 'rishi gargy-' he rajan! megh mandal main garjana ke rup main vidyaman us antaryami ishwar ko main saakshaat brahm maanata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! Don't say that main shabd kii aatma samajhakar hi is shreshth tatva kii upasna karata hum
 One who worships in this way, he himself becomes the soul of the word
 'rishi gargy ne phir kaha-'he rajan! akaash mandal main pratishthit parabrahm parameshwar kii main avinashi brahm ke rup main upasna karata hum
 'ajatashatru replied -' o Vipravar! i do not want to say anything about this
 yah to purna, pravriti-rahit brahm, sabhi se vishaal he
 Of course i worship it in this form
 jo aise divya brahm kii upasna karata he, vah samast praaniyon main nirvikaar ho jaataa he
 He does not die before time
 'isi prakaar vaarta ko aage badhaate hue gargy rishi ne vayumandal main sthit viraat purush ko brahm kaha, par ajatshatru ne use indra ke shreshth aishwarya se yukt vaikuntha kaha, jahaan kunthaayen nasht ho jaati hai ou vah sadaiv aparajit rahata he
 After that the sage gave the Virat Purush in the Agni Mandala, the Virat Purush present in the hydrosphere, the Virat Purush reflected in the mirror, the sound in the resonance, the phonetic word rising behind the dynamic Virat Purush, the shadow of the bodily, in the body a Virat Purush situated in the heart, a spirit-like soul with wisdom, a Virat Purush in the right eye, Virat Purush in the left eye
 By present as indestructible Brahman, spoke to worship him
 parantu ajatshatru ne kramash: sabhi ko nakaarte hue agni ko dusron kaa prahaar sahan karne vaala 'vishasahi,' jal main sthit brahm ko namdhari jeevatma, pratibimb ko praturup, pratidhwani ko gati kaa abhavayukt, dhvanyatmak shabd ko 'pranaswaroop', sharir kii chaaya ko mrityu-rup, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko prajapati kaa swaroop, pragna se yukt aatma ko yama kaa swaroop, daahine netra main sthit purush ko naam, agni or jyoti kii aatma, baayen netra main sthit purush ko satya, vidyut or tej kaa aatma bataaya or usee rup main unki upasna karne kii baat kahi
 Hearing of Ajatashatru, the sage Garga became silent and accepted Ajatashatru as his guru, but being a Kshatriya, Ajatashatru did not accept making disciples of Brahmin Gargya
 haa, ekaant main unhen unhen brahm kaa gyaan avashya karaayaa
 They took him to a sleeping person and tried to awaken him by calling him by many names, but when he did not wake up, Ajatshatru picked him up by hitting him with a stick
 uske jaagane par ajatshatru ne rishi gargy se kaha-'he vipravar! yah vyakti is prakaar achet hokar kahaan sota tha or kis pradesh main yah tha or ab jaagane ke baad yah kahaan aa gaya he?' rishi gargy is rahasy ko nahin samaj sake, to raja ajatshatru ne pun: kaha-'rishiver! yah purush jahaan sota tha, vah sthaan praan-rupi hridayakamal he
 There is a famous pulse named 'hita'
 uske dwaara hriday kaa vistaar sampoorn naadiyon tak he, jo bal ke hajaarwein bhaag se bhi sookshm he
 In these channels, the male is situated at bedtime
 is soye hue purush ke hriday main sthit 'praan' kaa sabhi indriyon se sambhaav he
 This life is the shell of the soul
 yah pragnavan aatma isi khol main sookshm rup se usee prakaar virajman rahati he, jaise lakdi kii myaan main talwaar rahati he
 This 'soul' activates the entire 'spirituality' when a man is awake
 tab us 'sakshi-rup aatma' kaa sabhi indriyaan anumat sevak kii bhaanti anusaran karti hai
 The knower, who knows this 'soul', like Indra, by destroying all his enemy asuras or sins, attains the best rank of Triloki
 at: 'aatma' ko jaanane ke liye ahankaar kaa tyaag param aavashyak he
 Only then can he destroy his sins

 Ghyasuddin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gaazi malik yaa tululaq gaazi, gayasuddin tululaq ke naam se 8 sitambar 1320 ko dilli ke singhaasana par baitha
 It is also considered the founder of the Tughlaq dynasty
 isane kul 29 baar mongol akraman ko vifal kiya
 Before becoming Sultan, he was appointed as the powerful governor of the north-west Frontier Province during the rule of Qutbuddin Mubarak Khilji
 vah dilli sultanate kaa pehla sultan tha, jisane apane naam ke saath 'gaazi' shabd joda tha
 Gaiyasuddin's father was a Karauna Turk slave and his mother was a Hindu
 sultan ne aarthik sudhaar ke antargat apni aarthik niti kaa aadhaar sanyam, sakhti evam narmi ke madhya santulan ko banaaya
 He issued an order to take only 1 / 10 or 1 / 11 of the produce as rent
 gayasuddin ne madhyavarti zamidaaron vishesh rup se mukaddam tathaa khooton ko unke puraane adhikaar lautaa die, jisase unako vahi sthiti praapt ho gayi, jo balban ke samay main praapt thi
 Ghayasuddin returned the land of the rich

 Ghyasuddin was probably the first Sultan to get the canal constructed
 allaudin kilji kii kathor niti ke viruddh usne udaartaa kii niti apanaayi, jise barani ne 'rasmemian' athwa 'madhyapanthi niti' kaha he
 He established the Tughlaq dynasty and ruled the Sultanate of Delhi from 1320 to 1325
 mongolo ke viruddh gayasuddin kii niti kathor thi
 He harshly punished Mongol prisoners
 usne amroha kii ladaai main mongolon ko parajeet kiya
 When Ghiyasuddin moved from Multan to Delhi, the people of the Sumro clan revolted and took over Thatta
 tughlaq ne tazuddin malik ko multan kaa, khwaaja khatir ko bhakkar kaa governor niyukt kiya
 He handed over the responsibility of Sehwan to Malik Ali Sher
 1323 main, gayasuddin ne apane bete zuna khan ko kakatiya rajdhani warangal ke abhiyaan par bheja
 The ensuing siege of Warangal resulted in the end of Warangal, and the Kakatiya dynasty
 1323 main usne apane bete mohammad shah ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya or rajya ke mantriyon or raison se vyavastha ke liye ek likhit vaada yaa samjhauta kiya
 He also started the construction of the Tughlaqabad Fort

 1321 i
 main gayasuddin ne warangal par akraman kiya, kintu vahaan ke kakatiya raja pratap rudradev ko parajeet karne main vah asafal rahaa
 In 1323 AD, under the second campaign, Ghayasuddin Tughlaq sent Shahzade 'jauna Khan' to re-establish the dominion of the Sultanate in South India
 jona khaan ne warangal ke kakatiya evam madura ke pandy rajyon ko vijit kar dilli sultanate main shaamil kar liya
 Thus, it was at the time of Ghiyasuddin that the southern states were merged with the Delhi Sultanate
 in rajyon main sarvapratham warangal tha
 Ghayasuddin Tughlaq was a total imperialist
 isane allaudin kilji kii dakshin niti tyagkar dakshini rajyon ko dilli sultanate main shaamil kar liya
 When Ghiyasuddin was in Bengal, it was reported that Zona Khan had become a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya and he was predicting him to be the king
 nizamuddin auliya ko gayasuddin tululaq ne dhamkee di to, auliya ne uttar diya ki, "hunuj dilli dur ast, arthath dilli abhi bahut dur he
 Ghayasuddin Tughlaq's policy towards the Hindu people was harsh
 gayasuddin tululaq sangeet kaa ghor virdohi tha
 According to Barani, where Alauddin Khilji adopted the policy of bloodshed and tyranny to establish the rule, Ghayasuddin made it possible in four years without any harshness
 apni satta sthapit karne ke baad gayasuddin tululaq ne amiron tathaa janata ko protsaahit kiya
 Being of purely Turkish origin, he had no particular difficulty in this task
 gayasuddin ne krishi ko protsaahan dene ke liye kisaanon ke hiton kii ore dhyaan diya
 He ordered not to increase Iqta's revenue by more than 1 / 10 to 1 / 11 part in a year
 usne sinchai ke liye naharen khudvayin tathaa baag lagavaaye
 For the convenience of the public, Ghayasuddin built fort, bridges and canals during his rule
 sultanate kaal main dak vyavastha ko sudrudh karne kaa shrey gayasuddin tululaq ko hi jaataa he
 'barani' has given a detailed description of postal system

 Ghayasuddin was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 islam dharm main uski gahari aasthaa or uske siddhanton kaa vah saavdhaneepurvak paalan karata tha
 He pressured the Muslim people to follow the rules of Islam
 vah apane samrajya ke bahusnkhyakon ke dharm ke prati shatrubhav to nahin rakhata tha kintu unke prati dayavan bhi nahin tha
 While returning from the Bengal expedition when Ghayasuddin Tughlaq was returning, the palace fell as Sultan Ghayasuddin entered a palace in Afghanpur, 8 kilometers from Tuglakabad, which was buried in March 1325 AD
 ebn batuta ke anusaar gayasuddin kii hatya uske putr zuna khan dwaara rache gaye shadyantr ke madhyam se kii gai
