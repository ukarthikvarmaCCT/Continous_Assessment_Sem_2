 All these things are perishable, all these things will leave you one day or you will have to forcibly leave these things one day
 It is better to run after things, that pride and grace all grow in bad things which can be left and Be friendly to all the people who behaved in the most humble way, because all the living beings have the right to live

 The soul is fed with innumerable echoes such as knowledge, happiness, effort, faith, and it has such power that only one can attain knowledge
 The best Aava Dharma teaches us that one can attain supreme bliss with simple nature by leaving all appeasement and evil
 uttam shouch dham hame yahi sikhaata he ki shuddh man se jitna mila he usee main khoosh raho paramatma kaa hameshaa shukriya maanon or apni aatma ko shuddh banaakar hi param anand moksh ko praapt karnaa mumkin he

 paryushan parv manaane kaa mul uddeshy aatma ko shuddh banane ke liye aavashyak upakramon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hota he
 Refinement of the environment is considered desirable for this
 aatma ko paryaavaran ke prati tatasth yaa vitrag banaae bina shuddh swaroop pradaan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 From this point of view, the 'kalpasutra' or elemental formula is read and discussed and self-study is done in the association of saints and scholars
 puja, archana, aarti, samagam, tyaag, tapasya, upwas main adhik se adhik samay vyateet kiya jaataa he or dainik vyavsaayik tathaa saavdhy kriyaaon se dur rahane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 The practice of exercising restraint and discretion goes on
 mandir, upashray, sthand tathaa samavasharan parisar main adhiktam samay tak rahanaa jaruri mana jaataa he
 By the way, Paryushan is not a festival of joy and joy like Deepawali and Christmas
 phir bhi unka prabhaav puure samaaj main dikhaai detaa he
 Thousands like fasting, Bela, Tela, Eighty, Masakhaman, without eating anything, without drinking anything, thousands of people doing nirjala penance get appreciation
 bharat ke alaava britain, america, canada, australia, japan, germany va anya anek deshon main bhi paryushan parv dhoomdhaam se manaae jate hai
 But the program of forgiveness or forgiveness on Paryushan festival is such that it gives a lot of inspiration to the non-public
 ise samuhik rup se vishwa-maitri diwas ke rup main manaaya ja saktaa he
 It is celebrated at the conclusion of Paryushan
 ganesh chaturthi yaa rishi panchami ko sanvatsari parv manaaya jaataa he
 On that day, people fast and criticize their sins and vow to avoid them in the future
 iske saath hi ve churaasi lakh yoniyon main vicharan kar rahe, samast jeevon se kshamaa maangate hue yah suchit karte hai ki unka kisi se koi bair nahin he
 Indirectly they pledge that they will not interfere in the environment
 man, vachan or kaaya se jaanate yaa ajaante ve kisi bhi hinsa kii gatividhi main bhaag na to swayan lenge, na dusron ko lene ko kahenge or na lene waalon kaa anumodan karenge
 In order to assure that they have no hatred of anyone, they also declare that they have forgiven all the creatures of the world and that those creatures need not fear the apologist
 khamemi savve jeeva, savve jeeva khamantu me
 Mittime sway bhuyes vairn mamjhan kanai
 yah vaakya paramparaagat jarur he, magar vishesh aashay rakhata he
 According to this, forgiveness is more important than apologizing
 kshamaa dene se aap anya samast jeevon ko abhaydaan dete hai or unki raksha karne kaa sankalp lete hai
 Then you will follow restraint and wisdom, feel spiritual peace and have a friendly attitude towards all beings and matter
 aatma tabhi shuddh rah sakati he jab vah apane sebaahar hastkshep na kare or bahari tatv se vichlit na ho
 Forgiveness is its core

 In any area of social life, a small and relatively homogenous group on top of the controlling structures is termed elation
 iske samanarthak latin shabd ‘ilit’ kaa matlab he chunaa hua yaa sarvshereshth
 To become an elite it is essential to have the power, convenience, competence and organization and leadership capacity

 Since the group of elites is small, it is easier to act more coherently and coherently
 uske sadsy aapas main lagaataar sampark banaaye rakhte hai jisase aapasi mataiky ke aadhaar par niti-nirmaan kii prakriya main baadha nahin padati
 It is not the case that the elite always manage to save their power
 unki vifaltaa kaa dosha aam taur par raajnneetik kaushal yaa ichha-shakti ke abhaav par madha jaataa he
 The elites, who keep on keeping alive with the society and receive new ideas and do their restorations, have been living for a long time

 Initially the elitist theory was an anti-democracy concept that was formulated to justify the authority of the rulers to challenge the legitimacy of the evolving democratic governance system of Europe
 aage chal kar beesvin sadi ke madhya main is siddhant kii antardrushtiyon se loktantric siddhant ko pusht karne kii cheshtaa kii gayi
 The motive behind this was to save the liberal democracy from the mass movements under communist or fascist leadership
 loktantr main aavashyak nahin ki saare abhijan satta main hi hon
 In today's democratic systems, many groups of elites can be seen competing among themselves to hold the reins of power
 pehle se jame hue abhijan-samooh kii sadsyta grahan karne ke liye loktantr ke manch par naye abhijanon kaa aagaman hota rahata he
 Initially, the elite were selected only from the upper class, but now the leadership powers of the lower and deprived sections are also included in the category of the elite
 vah loktantr adhik safal or tikaoo samajha jaataa he jiske abhijanon kaa aakaar badhata rahata he
 On the contrary, in the democracies where the elites make barricades against increasing their size, the system continues to be threatened again and again
 abhijan siddhanth multah is pracheen vishwaas par aadhaarit he ki samaaj mutthi bhar shaskaon or bahusankhyak shasiton main banta hota he
 Plato suggested the identification of people with the requisite nature-mandated abilities to govern
 itihaas or raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa yah ek prachlit tarika he ki un abhijanon kaa adhyayan kiya jaae jinke paas samaaj ke vibhinn kshetron ke sanchaalan ke liye nirnay lene ke adhikaar rahe hai
 In the early twentieth century Italian sociologists Gaetano Mosca and Wilfredo Pareto, as well as German followers of Mosca, Robert Michaels, reacted against the development of democratic systems, claiming that the rule of the elite is a key feature of human history
 yah sutrikaran unnisvin sadi main marxvad dwaara pravartit or pusht samtamulak ke ke kilaaf tha
 These theorists agreed with Marx that the leadership of societies had been in the hands of minorities in the past, but they also said that these minority groups were not necessarily the owners of the means of production
 unke prabhutv kaa strot aarthik nahin tha, balki unki satta vividh sroton se aati thi
 It is another matter that the elite used to accumulate wealth on a large scale by taking advantage of their dominance
 moska or parato kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki bhavishya ke samaajon ke netritv kaa pattern bhi aisa hi rahane vaala he
 Although these scholars insist that their sociology is not tied to any value, their sympathy for the emerging fascism in Italy was not hidden from anyone
 parato or michels to sidhe-sidhe fasiwad ke samarthak the or udaarpanthi moska vampanth se apni naaraazgi ke kaaran fasiwad ko ek majaburi kii tarah dekhte the
 Overall, the effort of these three theorists was that the parliamentary system should be limited only to the participation of the upper and middle class
 ve mazaduron or kisaanon ke pratinidhitiv vaali sansad ko tiraskaarpurn drushti se dekhte the
 Marxist theorists and advocates of democratic pluralism challenged this elitism
 marxvaadiyon ne kaha ki yah siddhant abhijanon ke prabhutv ke buniyadi aadhaar kii shinaakht karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Whether elites are military, religious, political or cultural; The foundation of their dominance must be seen in economic class relations
 bahultavaadiyon kaa tark tha ki aadhunik, viksit or udaarpanthi samaajon main satta or prabhutv ke liye vividh hiton ke bich pratiyogita hoti he
 Therefore, a group of handful members is never able to establish all-round dominance
 nirnay kii prakriya kaa centre sirf ek hi nahin hota
 In contrast to this reality, advocates of elitism adopt a flawed method of studying power and its sources in societies that stand on the basis of liberalism
 haalaanki abhijan siddhant loktantr virdohi tha, par beesvin sadi ke madhya main joseph shumpiter ne loktantric siddhant abhijan main abhijan siddhanth kaa samavesh kiya
 He said that even in democracy, governance should remain in the hands of the elite so that the system gets effective and stable orders
 bas shart yah he ki aise abhijanon kaa chayan loktantric prakriyaaon ke madhyam se kiya gaya ho
 Schumpeter's purpose behind doing this ideological engineering was to protect liberal democracy from movements led by anti-fascist elites who support fascism or communism
 bahultavaadi siddhant ko aade haathon lete hue shumpiter ne kaha ki satta or nirnay kii bahukendriyata kaa udaarataavaadi daawa sahi nahin he
 In fact, the control of the groups competing for dominance remains in the hands of a few leaders who do not necessarily follow the wishes and needs of their group members
 isliye samoohon ke bich kii pratiyogita unke netaaon ke bich kii pratiyogita ban jaati he
 As a result, pluralistic democracy turns into elite democracy
 is vichaar ke loktantr kaa tikaaupan or vikaas niskriy nagar samaaj par nirbhar na ho kar, uske abhijanon kii sakriyata or patibaddhta kaa hi parinaam hota he
 Whether it is a democratic system or autocracy, it is difficult to completely deny the importance of the elite
 kuch vidwaanon kaa tark he ki udaarataavaadi loktantr ke vyakhyaakaar zyaada dhyaan jansamoohon ke prabhaav main liye jane faisalon par dete hai
 In this way, the role of the initiatives taken by the elites is not fully understood
 ilit-study main dilchaspee rakhane vaale samaaj-vaigyanik saamaajik jivan ke vibhinn kshetron ke netaaon kii saamaajik or shaikshik prishthbhumi kii jaanch karke yah pataa lagane kii koshish karte hai ki kin karkon ke prabhaav main unhen abhijan-samooh main shaamil kiya gaya
 If more than one elite group is active in any part of society, it is ascertained what kind of social, political, economic and ideological interrelation is between them; And whether there is a possibility of integrating them
 ilit-study kaa ek doosraa aayam abhijanon or janata ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he
 It tries to know how the communication of this kind of relationship takes place from top to bottom and bottom to top
 is sambadh kii kaamiyaan-kuubiyaan tay karti hai ki ilit ko pratisthapit karne kii ichha rakhane vaali takaton kii sthiti kya he
 It is only from this analysis that the reasons behind the peaceful or revolutionary methods for removing a particular elite were working

 rhite mills ne ‘power ilit’ kii avadharana kaa sutrikaran kiya he
 According to Mills, three types of elites rule in the United States
 ye hai audyogic, raajnneetik faujee
 Interestingly, Mills, unlike other theorists, shows how the power elite created by this trio of elites is damaging to democracy
 abhijan siddhant ne samskruti-adhyayan ke kshetra main bhi hastkshep kiya he
 Critics of the rise of the mass society assume that contemporary mass media and the popular mass culture emanating from it are fatal to the superiority of the elite culture

 aaryon ke madhyadesh main aane par jan-jatiyon ne pratirodh kiya tha
 In the two thousand years from the Vedic period to the reign of the Bundelas, many castes and dynasties have ruled this region and have influenced the original rites of these castes with their socio-cultural consciousness

 The most important belief regarding the ancient history of Budelkhand is that it was a part of Chedi district

 The main reason for this is political apathy
 na to centre sarkaar or na hi rajya sarkarein is kshetra ke vikaas ke liye gambhir hai
 Therefore, the people of this region have been demanding a separate Bundelkhand state for a long time

 Panini is the largest grammarian of the Sanskrit language
 inkaa janm tatkaaleen uttar pashchim bharat ke gandhar main hua tha
 His grammar is named Ashtadhyayi with eight chapters and about four Sahasra Sutras
 sanskrit bhashaa ko vyakaran sammat rup dene main panini kaa yogadan athulaneey mana jaataa he
 Ashtadhyayi is not just a grammar text
 isamen prakarantar se tatkaaleen bhartiya samaaj kaa puraa chitra miltaa he
 The themes of geography, social, economic, education and political life, philosophical thinking, food, food, living, etc
 were written from place to place
 panini kaa janm shalatur naamak gram main hua tha
 This village was a few miles from the confluence where the river Kabul is found in the Indus
 use ab lahur kehete hai
 According to his birthplace Panini is also called Shalaturya
 or ashtaadhi main swayan unhone is naam kaa ullekh kiya he
 Chinese travelers had come to Shalatur village when Yuvanchuan arrived from the northwest
 panini ke guru kaa naam upavarsh pita kaa naam panin or mata kaa naam dakshi tha
 When Panini grew up, he studied grammar deeply
 panini se pehle shabdavidya ke anek acharya ho chuke the
 By reading his texts and observing their mutual differences, Panini got the idea that he should organize grammar science
 pehle to panini se purv vaidic samhitaon, shakhaon, brahman, aaranyak, upanishad aadi kaa jo vistaar ho chukaa tha us vaanmay se unhone apane liye shabdasaamagree lee jiskaa unhone ashtaadhi main upyog kiya he
 They collected and studied the material of the second nirukta and grammar which was already there
 iskaa pramaan bhi ashtaadhi main he, jaisaa shakatayan, shaakalya, bharadwaj, gargy, senak, apishali, galb or sphotayan aadi aacharyon ke maton ke ullekh se gyaat hota he
 The Shaktaayan was certainly the grammarian prior to Panini, as Niruktakar Yask has written
 shakatayan kaa mat tha ki sab sangya shabd dhaatuon se banate hai
 Panini accepted this view but did not make any request in this matter and also said that there are many words which have come in the lore of the people and they can not catch the metal suffix
 teesri sabase mahatvapurn baat panini ne yah kii ki unhone swayan lok ko apni aankhon se dekha or ghumkar logon ke bahumukhi jivan kaa parichay praapt karke shabdon ko chaanaa
 In this way, he collected many thousands of words
 shabdon kaa sankalan karke unhone unako vargeekrut kiya or unki kai suchiyaan banaai
 There was a list of "metal text" which Panini has set aside from Ashtadhyayi
 usamen 1943 dhaatuen hai
 There are two types of metals in the metalwork - 1
 which were used in literature before Panini and the other which were found in people's conversation
 unki duusari suchi main vedon ke anek acharya the
 Which stage became famous in the name of which Acharya, and under what name were the students studying in it and what were the names of those verses or branches, Panini has given the conclusion of all of them by applying different suffixes; Just like a teacher was Tittiri
 unka charan taittareey kaha jaataa tha or us vidhyalay ke chaatr evam vahaan kii shakha yaa samhita bhi taittiriya kehalaati thi
 Panini's third list was regarding "gotras"
 mul saat gotra vaidic yug se hi chale aate the
 By the time of Panini, they had expanded a lot
 gotron kii kai suchiyaan shrout sutron main hai
 Like in the Bodhayan Shrout Sutra which is called Mahaparavar Kand
 kintu panini ne vaidic or loukik donon bhashaaon ke parivaar yaa kutumb ke naamon kii ek bahut badi suchi banaai jisamen aarsh gotra or loukik gotra donon the
 They are short family names or alleys called Gotravayava
 ek gotra yaa parivaar main honevaala dada, buudhe evam chachaa aadi vyaktiyon ke naam kaise rakhe jate the, iskaa borevar ullekh panini ne kiya he
 Several names of gotras in the ganas, along with the twenty-two sutras, are in the Appendix treatise called "ganapath" of Panini
 panini kii chauthi suchi bhugolic thi
 Panini's birthplace was in the northwest, the region we call Gandhara
 unani bhugol lekhakon ne likhaa he ki uttar pashchim arthath gandhar or punjab main lagbhag 500 aise gram the jinamein se prayek kii jansankhya das sahasr ke lagbhag thi
 Panini has also given the actual names of the 500 villages from which lists of geographical accounts have been made
 graamon or nagaron ke un naamon kii pahchaan tedha prashn he, kintu yadi bahut parishram kiya jaay to yah sambhav he jaise sunet or sirsa punjab ke do chote gaanv hai jinhen panini ne sunetra or shairishak kaha he
 The names of many castes of Punjab were according to the villages where the caste resided or where their ancestors came from
 is prakaar nivas or abhijan in donon se jo upnaam banate the ve purush naam main jud jate the kyonki aise naam bhi bhashaa ke ang the
 Panini stood in the central part of Punjab and made her vision to the east and west
 unhen do pahari ilaake dikhaai pade
 The Kullu Kangra on the east, called Trigart at that time, was the hilly region on the western side that extended from Takshshila, the eastern capital of Gandhara, to the western capital Pushklavati
 isi main vah pradesh tha jise ab kabyli ilaaka kehete hai or jo sindhu nad ke uttar se dakshin tak vyaapt tha or jiske uttari chor par darad or dakshini chor par soubir tha
 Panini made a detailed list of the tribes living in this region and studied the constitutions
 is pradesh ko us samay gramaniya ilaaka kehete the kyonki in kabeelon main, jaisaa aaj bhi he or us samay bhi tha, gramani shashan kii pratha thi or gramani shabd unke netaa yaa shaasha kii padavi thi
 The ruling assembly of these castes is currently called Jirga and in the era of Panini it was called "bratapugh", "sangha" or "gana"
 vastut: sab kabeelon ke shashan kaa ek prakaar na tha kintu ve sangh shashan ke vikaas kii bhinn bhinn avasthaaon main the
 Panini has told from these nouns Vrat and Poog that many of these tribes used to spend their lives by looting or looting, which is still the truth of life there
 us samay ye sab kabeeley yaa jatiyaan hindu thim or unke adhipatiyon ke naam sanskrit bhashaa ke the jaise devdattak, kabeeley kaa purvapurush yaa sansthaapak koi devdatt tha
 Now the names have changed, but it is the same as if the ancestor of the Isaakhel clan was someone named Isa
 in kabeelon ke bahut se naam panini ke ganpaath main milte hai, jaise afridi or mohamad jinhen panini ne aprit or madhumant kaha he
 a list in the geographical lists of Panini is of the districts
 pracheen kaal main apana desh janapad bhoomiyon main baitha hua tha
 In the sub-division of the Vanxu River in Central Asia, Kamboj district, Kutch district of Saurashtra in the west, Surmas district of Assam in the east and Ashmak district on the banks of Godavari in the south, the entire territory was divided between the four peaks and the people
 District development of political and social life and languages went on for thousands of years
 panini ne sahasron shabdon kii vyutpatti bataai jo ashtaadhyagi ke chauthe paanchaven adhyyon main he
 Panini collected the words of his special profession by meeting hundreds of professional people like Brahmins, Kshatriyas, soldiers, merchant farmers, rangers, carpenters, cooks, cobblers, cowherds, shepherds, shepherds, weavers, potters etc
 panini ne yah bataaya ki kis shabd main koun sa pratyay lagata he
 The letters that form the vowel and consonant forms of the alphabet are formed from them
 jaise- varsha se vaarshik, yahan mul shabd varsha he usase ik pratyay jud gaya or vaarshik arthath varsha sambandhi yah shabd ban gaya
 The episode of Tadvita in Ashtadhyayi is interesting
 kahin to panini kii sookshm chaanbin par aashcharya hota hai, jaise vyas nadi ke uttari kinare kii bongar bhoomi main jo pakke baramasi kuen banaae jate the unke naamon kaa uccharan kisi duusare swar main kiya jaataa tha or usee ke dakkhini kinare par khadar bhoomi main har saal jo kachche kuen khod liye jate the unke naamon kaa swar kuch bhinn tha
 Panini has said this in the "udta Bipasha" formula
 gaayon or belon kii to jeevanakatha hi panini ne sutron main bhar di he
 While studying the economic life, Panini also checked the coins which used to go in the markets
 jaise "shatmaan", "karshapan", "suvarna", "andh", "paad", "maashak" "trinshatk", "vinshatik" 
 Some people also sold goods from Abla Badli
 use "niman" kaha jaataa tha
 During Panini's time there was a great expansion of education and poetry
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhone bahut hi gaharaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He was thoroughly familiar with both Vedic and cosmic languages
 unheen kii saamagree se panini ne apane vyakaran kii rachana kii par usamen pradhanta loukik sanskrit kii hi rakhi
 They have called colloquial Sanskrit language
 unhone na keval granthrachana ko kintu adhyaapan kaary bhi kiya
 
 panini kaa shiksha vishyak sambandh, sambhav he, takshashila ke vishvavidhyalay se rahaa ho
 It is said that when he had collected his material, he spent some time in seclusion and composed Ashtadhyayi
 panini kaa samay kya tha, is vishay main kai mat hai
 Some call them 7th century BC, 5th century or 4th century BC
 Says patanjali ne likhaa he ki panini kii ashtaadhi kaa sambandh kisi ek veda se nahin balki sabhi vedon kii parishadon se tha 
 This was also the reason for the unanimous reputation of Panini's texts
 panini ko kisi matvishesh main pakshpaat na tha
 The word means a person or caste, in this subject he has considered both sides
 gaoo shabd ek gaay kaa bhi vaachak he or gaoo jati kaa bhi
 The two acharyas, named Vajapayan and Vyadi, urged different opinions, but Panini readily accepted both
 panini se purv ek prasiddh vyakaran indra kaa tha
 In it, the words were thought to be natural or epistemological
 usee kii parampara panini se purv bharadwaj acharya ke vyakaran main lee gai thi
 Panini considered it
 bahut si paribhaashik sangyaayen unhone usase le leen, jaise sarvnaam, avyay aadi or bahut si nai banaai, jaise ti, ghu, bha aadi
 Panini has been called Manglik Acharya
 unke hriday kii udaar vritti mangalatmak karm or fal kii icchhuk thi
 It is a witness to this that he started his Vardushan with the word "old"
 kuch vidvan kehete hai ki panini ke granth main na keval aadimangal balki madhyamangal or antmangal bhi he
 His last sutra has come hraswakaar varnasamanvay kaa mul he
 Panini is also called a well-known Acharya, that is, a friend of all and a certified Acharya
 pantajali kaa kahana he ki panini ne jo sutara ek baar likhaa use kaata nahin
 Each of their letters in grammar is considered proof
 shishy, guru, lok or veda dhatuli shabd or deshi shabd jis ore acharya ne drushti daali use hi ras se seench diya
 Even today, Panini "word: Locke Prakasate", meaning his name is universally published
 ur Their timing is uncertain and disputed
 itnaa tay he ki chhathi sadi isa purv ke baad or chauthi sadi isapurv se pehle kii avadhi main inkaa astitv rahaa hoga
 It is believed that he was born in Shalatula in Punjab, which is close to modern-day Peshawar
 inkaa jeevankaal 520-460 isa purv mana jaataa he
 The quotation of the word Yavanani is used to measure Panini's lifetime
 iskaa arth yunaan kii stri yaa yunaan kii lipi se lagaaya jaataa he
 The direct information about Yavano in Gandhara was not before Alexander's invasion
 sikandar bharat main isa purv 330 ke aasapaas aayaa tha
 But it may happen that Panini will have knowledge of the wild life through Persian sex and Panini may also be in the period of Dara I
 plutark ke anusaar sikandar jab bharat aayaa tha to yahaan pehle se kuch unani bastiyaan thim
 It is believed that Panini must have used some medium to write because the words he used were extremely clean and his analysis without writing seems unlikely
 kai log kehete he ki unhone apane shishyon kii samaran shakti kaa prayog apni lekhan pustika ke rup main kiya tha
 The script was reused in India in the 6th century BC and the first use of the Brahmi script took place in Tamil Nadu in South India, away from Gandhara in northwest India
 gandhar main 6thi sadi isa purv main farsi shashan tha or aisa sambhav he ki unhone armike varnon kaa prayog kiya hoga
 Panini's Sanskrit grammar is in four parts - patanjali ne panini ke ashtaadhi par apni tippanee likhi jise mahabhashya kaa naam diya )
 More than a century ago, the famous German Indologist Max Müller said in his Science of That - "main nirbhiktapurvak kah saktaa hoon ki angrezi yaa latin yaa greek main aisi sankalpanaayen naganya hai jinhen sanskrit dhaatuon se vyutpann shabdon se abhivyakt na kiya ja sake
 On the contrary, i believe that the number of metals desired for an explanation of the entire wealth of the English Dictionary, comprising 2,50,000 words, is less than the paneled metals within reasonable limits
 xxrep 4 
 angrezi main aisa koi vaakya nahin jiske prayek shabd kaa 800 dhaatuon se evam prayek vichaar kaa panini dwaara pradutt saamagree ke saavdhaneepurvak veshleshan ke baad avishasht 121 moulik sankalpanaaon se sambandh nikaala na ja sake
 " panini ke sutron kii style atyant sankshipt he
 He took place in the Sutra Yuga itself
 shrout sutara, dharm sutara, grihasthasutra, praatishakhya sutara bhi isi style main he kintu panini ke sutron main jo nikhaar he vah anyatra nahin he
 That's why Panini's formulas have been called Pratishtana Sutras
 panini ne varna yaa varnmaala ko 14 pratyaahaar sutron main baanta or unhen vishesh kram dekar 42 pratyaahaar sutara banaae
 This is the biggest feature of Panini so that they can fill more material in a small space
 yadi ashtaadhi ke aksharon ko gina jaay to uske 3995 sutara ek sahasr shloke ke baraabar hote hai
 Panini did more concise scriptures, such as taking possession of one or several words of the sutra, ie possession and transcendence, into further sutras so as not to repeat them
 arth karne kii kuch paribhaashaayen bhi unhone banaai
 a very peculiar tactic he derived from imperfect sources
 arthath baad kaa sutara apane se pehle ke sutara ke kaary ko ojhal kar de
 This imperfect law of Panini was his system of mechanism which is not found in any other book of the world

 Panini's work became known in Europe in the 19th century, which had a great impact on modern philology
 aarambh main frenz bop ne panini kaa adhyayan kiya
 Later many compositions of European Sanskrit scholars such as Fernandes de Sauser, Leonard Bloomfield and Roman Jacobsen were influenced
 frits stall ne yorape main bhashaa par bhartiya vichaaron ke prabhaav kii vivechna kii
 Panini and the later Indian philosopher Bhartrihari had considerable influence on many of Ferdinand de Saucer's basic ideas

 It was developed long before the explorations of Götlob Frege of the 19th century and subsequent mathematical developments

 Macromedia was an American software house with graphics and web development headquartered in San Francisco, California, and built products such as Flash and Dreamweaver
 uske pratidwandvi, adob systams, ne 3 disambar 2005 ko mecromedia kaa adhigrahan kar liya or 2010 ke anusaar mecromedia ke utpaadon kii shrinkhalaa ko niyantrit karata he
 Macromedia was born in 1992 with the merger of Autherware Inc
 4 and macromind-paracomp
 diarector, ek interactive multimedia-sanlekhan upkaran tha jise sidi rome or soochna bhandar ke nirmaan main vyapak rup se istemaal kiya jaataa tha or jisane 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak mecromedia ke pramukh utpaada ke rup main kaary kiya
 As the CD-ROM market began to decline and the popularity of the World Wide Web began to grow, Macromedia created Shockwave, a director-viewer plugin for web browsers, but decided to expand its branches to web native There is a need to expand our market by spreading media tools
 janvari 1995 main, mecromedia ne apni bauddhik sampatti ke liye eltsis kaa adhigrahan kiya; vishesh rup se, freehand kaa, ek aisa pej-leout or vector-aarekhan kaarykram jo adobi elstritor ke bahut samaan tha
 Freehand's vector-graphics rendering engine and other software components within the program would have been useful for Macromedia in developing technologies that supported its web strategy
 apni web ranneeti ko aage turant prarambh karne ke liye, mecromedia ne 1996 main do adhigrahan kiye
 First, Macromedia acquired futurewave Software, the makers of futuresplash Animator, an animation tool that futurewave Software originally developed for pen-based computing tools
 futuresplash darshak anuprayog ke chote aakaar kii vajah se, yah vishesh rup se web ke dwaara downlod kiye jane ke liye upyukt tha, jahaan adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke paas us samay, kam bandwidth conection hua karata tha
 Macromedia renamed Splash as Macromedia Flash and distributed Flash Player as a free browser plugin, emulating Netscape, to quickly make inroads on the market
 2005 tak, duniya bhar ke computaron main kisi bhi anya web media format ke mukaable jisamen shaamil tha java, quick time, real networks or windos media player, flash player zyada install tha
 As Flash matured, Macromedia's focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a web application platform, attempting to maintain the player's small footprint
 He added scripting and data access capabilities to it
 1996 main bhi, mecromedia ne yband software ko adhigrahit kiya, jo naveen backstage HTML sanlekhan-upkaran or anuprayog-sarwar ke nirmaataa the
 Macromedia developed a new HTML authoring tool called Macromedia Dreamweaver around parts of the backstage codebase and released its first version in 1997
 us samay, adhikansh peshewar web other, HTML ko text editor kaa istemaal karte hue haath se hi kuta karnaa pasand karte the kyonki ve strot par puraa niyantran chaahate the
 Dreamweaver introduced this by its "roundtrip HTML" feature, which attempted to maintain the integrity of the hand-edited source code during visual editing, enabling users to move back and forth between visual and code editing
 
 agle kuch varshon main drimavivar ko peshewar web othron ke bich vyapak rup se apanaaya jane laga, haalanki abhi bhi kai hast-kuta hi pasand karte the or microsoft frontpej shaukia or vyavsaayik upyogkartaaon ke bich main ek majboot pratiyogi bana rahaa
 Macromedia continues its journey of mergers and acquisitions: In December 1999, it acquired traffic analysis software company Andromedia Corporation
 web vikaas company alair 2001 main adhigrahit kii gayi or mecromedia ne uske portpholio main kai lokapriy sarwar or web vikaas ke utpaadon ko joda, jisamen coldfusion, jo jo CMFL langguage par aadhaarit ek web anupyog sarwar tha, jeran, jo ek java ii anuprayog sarwar tha or homesait, jo ek HTML kuta sampadak tha in sabko bhi drimavivar ke saath ekajute kar diya gaya
 In 2003, Macromedia acquired web conferencing company Presedia and continued to develop and promote their Flash-based online collaboration and presentation product offering under their brand Breeze
 baad main usee varsh, mecromedia ne sahaayak sanlekhan software company kaa adhigrahan kiya ehelp Corporation, in utpaadon main robohelp or robodemo shaamil the
 Many of Robohelp's developers went on to build Madcap software that was a competitor in the help-authoring space
 18 april 2005 ko, adob systams ne mecromedia ko ek 3
4 dollar mulya ke share swap main adhigrahit karne kii ghoshnaa kii, jise ghoshnaa se pehle trading ke antim din kiya gaya tha
 On 3 December 2005, the acquisition was completed, and shortly thereafter, Adobe integrated the company's operations, networks and customer service organizations

 The theory of structural engineering is based on empirical knowledge related to physical laws and properties of various materials / geometries
 anekon chote chote sanrachanaatmak avyavon ke yoga se jatil sanrachanaayen nirmit kii jaatin hai
 a structural engineer should not only have the knowledge of iron and steel, but also have advanced knowledge of wood, brick, stone, lime and cement and should also be proficient in mechanical and electrical engineering work, because they are safe and secure according to the principles of their structure, mechanics and physics
 Have to make from bhoomi, jal or vaayu kii prakruti kaa bhi purna gyaan civil ejeeniyar ke samaan hi hona chahie
 Structural engineering was considered a department of civil engineering till the 19th century, but as the requirements of civil society changed and increased according to the circumstances, production and use of advanced types of iron, steel etc
 started to increase, so did mechanics Has progressed

 sethunirmaan main bhi sanrachana ejineero se badi sahaayta mili he
 In the famous bridge across the Forth River in Scotland, which is built of cantilever, two arches are formed at the base of three pillars in the middle of the river, each of which is 1,710 feet in length and the bridge across the bridge, from coast to coast, 5215 Ft
 america kaa quebec pul to duniyaan bhar ke canteliver pulon main sabase bada samajha jaataa he
 Its central arch is 1,800 feet
 is pul kaa nirmaan 1918 i
 main samaapt kar, yah yatayaat ke liye chaalu kiya gaya tha
 This bridge is the best example of modern structural art

 bharat ke pulon main kalakatta kaa haavda pul or haridwar ke nikat rishikesh kaa lakshmana jhula naamak pul is kala ke achche namoonay hai
 The design of each building requires roofs and floors for dharnas, scissors, pillars and a foundation built on the ground
 inkaa sangyojan hi makaan kaa 'dhaanchaa' he
 Whether the structure is for any building, bridge or crane, etc
, it is necessary to consider while constructing them that what kind of force and how much quantity of external force will fall on their various components
 sthitiki ke siddhantanusaar un balon ke kaaran, dhaanche ke vividh avyavon par aanevaale pratibalon kii gananaa bhi badi saavdhaanee se kerani hoti he, jisase dhaanchaa sab prakaar se sudrudh or niraapad ban jaae
 Making the structure strong does not mean making its components very thick and heavy
 dhaanche kii banaavat main bal sahan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 Such a structure is made by combining several triangles
 chaturbhujon or panchabhujon se bane dhaanche main itani kshamta nahin hoti
 The triangular frame is called scissors
 ye balon ke sahane ke drushtikon se sarvatha nirdosh or avyavon kii drushti se swat: purna hoti he
 Such scissors can be made for very long legs and can also be balanced on its own
 bade paat kii chhaten banane ke liye deevaaron par saadhaaran thos prakaar ke lambey garder rakhkar hi kyon nahin kaam chalaaya jaataa? trikoawmay kainchiyan hi kyon banaai jaati hai? maamuli chote paaton kii chhaten to avashya hi uchit maap ke sade garder rakhkar banaai ja sakati hai, parantu garder bahut adhik lambey hone par baari tathaa mahange padate hai
 For large legs, triangular canes are very strong and very light and cheap
 kainchiyon ke jodon ko pinon dwaara na banaakar ribaton dwaara pakkaa jad diya jaataa he
 Some special types of forces start coming in the rebats which these rebates must be made stronger to bear
 samast chat ke pataav kaa bhaar batton ke madhyam se vibhajit hokar kainchiyon ke trikonon ke upree jodon par aakar, sab kainchiyon par baraabar bantkar or in kainchiyon ke bhaar sahit aadha-aadha bantkar diwaar ke teke par padakar antatah buniyaad par jaataa he
 Therefore, these burdens have to be estimated very carefully
 ye bojhe sadaiv ek se hi bane rahane ke kaaran achal bhaar kehalaate hai
 All vertical walls and sloping roofs are subjected to the vertical pressure caused by the side air, which is called air pressure and it comes in the count of moving load
 anek manzile makaanon kii madhyavarti chhaton par vahaan ke nivaasiyon or uthau fernichar kaa bhaar hi hota he lekin yah anya achal bhaaron kii apeksha naganya hota he
 The forces falling on different components of the structure are calculated according to the principle of force triangle or force polygons
 iske liye ejeeniyar "bau sanket" pranali kaa upyog karte hai
 This method is relatively simple
 balon kaa pariklan vishuddh ganit dwaara bhi sthitiki or trikonmiti kii sahaayta se kiya ja saktaa he
 To calculate in this way, assuming an appropriate point to be the center of the pulverizer, equate the rotating force of unknown force falling in any component of the structure
 jitne hi adhik bade paat kii chat kii kanchi athwa pul kaa kanchinuma garder anaaya jaataa he usamen utane hi adhik sankhya main chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yahi baat kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yah baat kainchiyon ke thaamon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Therefore, the scissors are divided into small triangles of appropriate size to withstand the force
 dhaanchaa par jo boj padate hai use bhaar kehete hai
 Movable and fixed loads are mentioned above
 yadi bhaar kisi thodi si jagah par kendrit he, to use kendrit bhaar or yadi puure avyavon par failaa ho, to use vibhajit bhaar kehete hai
 The load of the vehicles, trains, motors, trucks, etc
, is called the load and the load coming from one direction and immediately after the other direction is called the load with the alternating load and the impact load
 padaarthon kaa pratibal bhi hota he
 Stress, compression, shear, cramps etc
 can be stress due to the condition and tendency of the load
 pratibal ke prabhaav se jo parivartan hota he use vikruti kehete hai
 Substances have the property of elasticity, less in some and less in some and more in some
 pratyasthata kii seemaa hoti he
 Substances that exceed the limit are broken
 hook ne san 1676 main ek niyam sthapit kiya ki yadi prayek padaarth par uski pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaaya jaae, to uske kaaran padanevaala pratibal tathaa us padaarth main honevaali vikruti main ek vishesh anupaat hoga
 In 1826, Dr
 Young definitively ascertained the proportions of deformations in various substances due to stresses falling within the range of elasticity
 ise yang kaa pratyasthata mapank kehete hai
 The tensile and compression ratios are expressed by the E, shear ratios C, or the letter g and the volume ratios are expressed by the k letter: pratyaksh pratyasthata mapank Transverse elasticity modulus sampeden se padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he
 Thus, the elastic elasticity modulus tapochar tathaa yantropchaar se pratyasthata mapaankon main parivartan ho jaaya karata he
 If a solid rod is pulled, we see that it breaks thinly in the middle and if it is pulled by applying force within the range of elasticity, its lateral measurement becomes smaller as it increases in length
 
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chad ko dabaaya jaae, to uski parshvik naap bad jaati he
 Therefore, the change in the lateral measurements of a direct solid due to stretch or pressure is in proportion to the Poisson
 ise m akshar se vyakt karte hai
 a pure mismatch is in the form of a mixture of stresses, two materials and each other acting in opposite directions
 inaki kriya rekha bhi ek duusare se samakon par hoti he
 If one end of the axle is firmly tightened in the wall and the other end is applied with force, the other end will be slightly bent
 mula rekha se jitna kone, dd banaakar vah mudata he vah kone uskaa anthan kone hoga
 With the help of this angle the spasm force of axle can be removed
 ejiniyari main kaam aanevaali samagriyon kaa pareekshan atyaavashyak he
 Placing them under the same conditions as the materials used, should be tested
 pareekshan do prakaar se hota he : ek raasayanik reeti se samagriyon ke aanvik sanghathan kaa gyaan hota he or bhautik reeti se khinchakar, dabaakar, aparupan kar, panch se chhedakar, jhukaa kar tathaa modakar dekha jaataa he ki unke sahan karne kii samta kisi he
 Nowadays, a device has been made to test the material in physical way, which is called Hounsfield tensometer
 isaki kaarypaddati badi saral he or saamaanya vyakti bhi thode se prashikshan se iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 With this, knowledge of the strength of materials, load distortion, abstinence etc
 is easily achieved
 jab tak kisi padaarth par padanevaale pratibal us padaarth kii pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar rahata he, tab tak vikruti badi sookshm yaa asthaayee hoti he
 As soon as the weight is removed, that substance returns to its original state
 par yadi pratibal pratyasthata kii seemaa ke upar ho, to vikruti paryaapt ore adhik sthaayee hoti he
 The fraction weight is much higher than the limit of elasticity, but in terms of trade and utility, this weight is kept low and is called the point of defeat and it is considered as the differential weight
 pratyasthata kii seemaa sahane yogya bhaar se bhi kaaphi kam maatra main bhaar daalane kii yojana, abhiklpana ke samay kii jaati he
 Therefore, the ratio in which this practical load is less than the most bearable load, that ratio is called the Abbey Coefficient or Depressor of that substance
 ise nimnlikhit sutara se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Representatives of different substances are different in different states
 kathor ispaat kaa abhayank sthir bhaar main teen tathaa chal bhaar main paanch se aath or prayavarti chal bhaar main nau se 13 tak hota he
 The hardness of materials can easily be estimated by their stress, compression, contouring, etc
 forces
 kathorta pareekshan kii aadhunik vidhiyaan, sthitik danturata or gatyaatmak danturata ke siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Brinell's hardness-test-method based on static dentistry theory, according to which a part of the test substance is polished finely like glass, and is pressed on it with standard weights by instruments by placing a bullet of very hardened steel, standard diameter
 isse polish kii hui sataha par gol nishaan pad jaataa he
 By measuring the diameter of the mark, remove the hardness of the bullet according to the following formula: yadi goli kaa vyas d or nishaan kaa vyas d mimi
 hoti to Joe Krigra Per square mm It is written in saadharantaya goli kaa vyas 10 mimi
 or lohe tathaa ispaat ke liye 3,000 kigra
, pital aadi mulaayam dhaatuon ke liye 1,000 kriga
 or sis aadi bahut mulaayam dhaatu ke padaarthon ke liye 50 kriga
 maanak bhaar rakhaa jaataa he
 The weight is usually kept so that the diameter of the mark does not exceed 3 / 8 of the diameter of the bullet
 pareekshan kisi bhi vyas kii goli se kiya ja saktaa he, par daab or goli ke vyas kaa anupaat, p / , ek sa rahanaa chahie
 a steel bullet is used for general hardness and a diamond bullet for high hardness
 kathor padaarthon par 15 second tak or mulaayam padaarthon par 30 second tak bhaar diya jaataa he
 There is a system of finely measuring the mark
 wickers vidhi se bhi kathortank nikaala jaataa he
 In this place, Hirakni is used in the form of a square pyramid in place of bullet
 isse chaukor gaddha banataa he, jiskaa vikarn or gaharaai adhik yatharthata se naapi ja sakati he
 The hardness is extracted from it as follows: gatyamak danturata par aadhaarit anek yantra bane hai, jinamein shor ) kaa banaaya hua scale roscp sarvaadhik prasiddh he
 It consists of a cylindrical hammer of steel, weighing about 40 grains

 Similarly, the compression of various substances multiplied by the appropriate constants and the algebraic strength may also be known
 sanrachana ejiniyari ke kaamon main vividh prakaar ke bal dekhe jate hai
 They can be divided into the following six major categories: vibhinn avyav ribaton dwaara, athwa bolton dwaara, jode jate hai
 The joints made by the rebats are permanent and can be cut apart, but the joints made by bolts are temporary and can be opened in different subdivisions
