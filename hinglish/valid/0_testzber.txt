 It is true that Shri Mad Devi Bhagavat Purana is great in all the scriptures and religious texts
 iske saamne bade-bade tirth or vrath naganya hai
 On hearing this Purana, sins are destroyed by burning like a dry forest, due to which man does not have to suffer grief, grief, sorrow etc

 The Mahatmas kept these curiosities with regard to Bhagavata Purana from Sutji: maharishi parashar or devi satyavati ke sanyog se shrinarayan ke anshavatar dev vyasaji kaa janm hua

 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa

 Due to the devotion and worship of the Sun, he received a very bright gem named Swamantak
 mani kii kranti se raja swayan surya jaisaa prabhaa-mandit ho jaataa tha
 In this confusion, when the Yadavas spoke to Shri Krishna about the arrival of Lord Surya, then Antaryami Krishna, while removing the doubts of the Yadavas, said that the upcoming nobleman Maniadhari king is Satrajit, not Surya
 swamantak mani kaa gun tha ki usko dhaaran karne vaala pratidin aath kilo swarna praapt karegaa
 There was no sign of any kind of human or divine calamity in that region
 swamantak mani praapt karne kii ichha swayan krishna ne bhi kii lekin satrajit ne asweekaar kar diya

 Unhappy with this rumor, Krishna set out to find Prasenjit

 They also found signs of bear footprints there, which indicated the entrance into the cave
 isse krishna ne singh ko maarane tathaa mani ke rich ke paas hone kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Krishna himself entered the cave by telling his companions to stay outside and wait

 On Krishna's return, his father Vasudeva was distressed in his son-mourning
 usee samay maharishi naarad aa gaye

 The year 1922 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 vigyanbhikshu bharat ke darshanik the
 He is in a way the last teacher of Sankhya
 inhone hi sankhyamat main ishwarwad kaa samavesh kiya tha
 He has written commentaries on three philosophies - Samkhya Sambhakshabhashya; Yogavartik, Vigyanamritabhasya
 vigyanbhikshu puure auchity ke saath sankhyasutra par apana bhashya prastut karte hue kehete hai ki sankhya 'kalbhakshit' ho gaya tha
 They have been trying to revive this system
 lupt hue sankhya ke swarup nirmaan kii disha main agrasar hote hue ve sadaiv upanishad or puraanon ke yug ke ananthar viyukt hone vaale sankhya or vedant main saamanjasy sthapit karneke prati prayatnsheel the
 Scientists were also loyal to Vedanta
 'vignanamrita' naam se brahmasutra par unka bhashya is tathy ko pramanit karata he
 There are several reasons for accepting this, on the basis of which it can be told that Sankhya philosophy seems to be gradually disappearing in Vedanta philosophy
 yahaan tak ki vigyanbhikshu ne vedantik mithyaa pratiti suchak maaya ko sankhya kii yatharth pratithisuchak prakruti ko ek samaan pratipaadit kiye jane kaa praytn kiya tha
 This is the reason that even though many metaphysicians were overwhelmed in an attempt to mimic the result of the emergence of later Buddhist logics, no serious study of totalitarianism was presented from any point of view
 vastut: ek aise sanshodhan ke baad jisane sankhyadarshan kaa vedant kii paridhi main pahunchaa diya tha, sankhya kaa ek swatantra sampradaay ke rup main astitv samaapt ho chukaa tha
 Shankaracharya's Brahmasutra can help us enough to resolve these two opposing matraghas in relation to Sankhya philosophy
 lakshya karne kii baat he ki brahmasutra ne sankhyadarshan ke khandan par atyadhik bal diya tha kyonki brahramasutrakaar sankhya ko apana ghor pratidwandvi sweekaar karata tha or tha bhi, kyonki sankhya ke pradhanvaad athwa karanwad main jahaan ek mul-bhautik tatv ko vishwa kaa aadyakaaran bataaya gaya tha, advait vedant ke mul chetan karanwad ke nitant vipareet khadaa tha
 This was the reason that in the first four sutras of the Brahmasutra, Brahma Sutrakara immediately becomes anxious to clarify that Brahma is a conscious element in the next seven sutras as he clarifies some fundamental things regarding the nature of Brahma and Vedanta texts
 , Which should be separated from the 'head' of Sankhya philosophy, which cannot be the root of the world due to being unconscious or physical

 maharaja poras sindh-punjab sahit ek bahut bade bhu-bhaag ke swami the
 Puru did not try to find out what is the secret of the power of the Yavana army? The main force of the Yavana army was its fast cavalry and agile archers riding horses
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki puru ko apni veerta or hastisena par vishwaas tha lekin usne sikandar ko jhelum nadi paar karne se nahin roka or yahi uski bhul thi
 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river
 jab sikandar ne akraman kiya to uskaa gandhar-takshashila ke raja aambhi ne swaagat kiya or aambhi ne sikandar kii gupt rup se sahaayta kii
 Ambi King considered Porus his enemy

 Next page describes the war 


 jasuson or dhoorttake bal par sikandar ke sardaar yuddh jeetne ke prati purnatah vishwast the
 Alexander crossed the Jhelum with an army of greedy Ambi, an enemy of King Puru
 raja puru jisko swayan yavani 7 foot se upar kaa bataate hai, apni shaktishaalee gajasena ke saath yavani sena par tut pade
 Alexander and his soldiers were horrified by the terrible destruction of the Greeks by the army of Porus
 bharatiyon ke paas videshi ko maar bhagane kii har naagarik ke hath, shaktishaalee gajasena ke alaava kuch andekhee hathiyaar bhi the jaise saatphuta bhaalaa jisase ek hi sainik kai-kai shatru sainikon or ghode sahit ghudsavaar sainikon bhi maar gira saktaa tha
 In this war, Alexander's army got a fierce competition on the very first day
 sikandar kii sena ke kai vir sainik hataahat hue
 Despite being horrified by the Yandi chieftains, Alexander stood firm on his stubbornness and entered the battlefield between his special bodyguard and his internal defense
 koi bhi bhartiya senapati haathiyon par hone ke kaaran un tak koi khatra nahin ho saktaa tha, raja kii to baat bahut dur he
 King Puru's brother Amar killed Alexander's horse Bukiphilas with his spear and dropped Alexander to the ground
 aisa unani sena ne apane saare yudhkaal main kabhi hote hue nahin dekha tha
 Sikandar stood in front of the ground with Raja Puru sword
 sikandar bas palabar kaa mehmaan tha ki tabhi raja puru thithak gaya
 It was not feared, perhaps it was the Kshatra Dharma of the Arya King, however, then Alexander's bodyguards drove him away from there rapidly
 poras par uplabdh ekmaatr jaankaree unani sroton se he itihaaskaaron ne haalanki tark diya he ki unke naam or unke domen ke sthaan par aadhaarit poras ko rugaved main ullekith puru janajati ke vanshaj hone kii sambhaavna thi
 Historian Ishwari Prasad said that Porus could have been Yaduvanshi Shoreseni
 unhone tark diya ki poras ke mohara sainikon ne heracals kaa ek binar jise megasthanis ne dekha tha, jo poras ke baad bharat kii yatra par chandragupta dwaara mathura ke shorsaniyon ke saath spasht rup se pahachaane gaye the
 Megasthanis and Herakles of Arrian have been identified by some scholars as Krishna and by others as his elder brother Baldev, who was both the ancestor and patron deity of Shoresenis
 ishahari prasad or anya, unki aguwai ke baad, is nishkarsh kaa adhik samarthan is tathy main paaya gaya ki shorseniyon kaa ek hissaa krishna ke nidhan ke baad punjab or aadhunik afghanistan se mathura or dwarka ke liye pashchim kii ore palaayan kar rahaa tha or vahaan nae rajya sthapit kiye the
 It was difficult to set foot in the kingdom of Porus without crossing the Indus and Jhelum

 Maharaja Porus was the owner of a very large area including sindh-punjab

 Historians believe that Puru had faith in his valor and Hastisena but that did not stop Alexander from crossing the Jhelum River and that was his mistake
 lekin itihaaskaar yah nahin jaanate ki jhelum nadi ke is paar aane ke baad sikandar buree tarah funs gaya tha, kyonki nadi paar karne ke baad nadi main baadh aa gai thi
 When Alexander attacked, he was welcomed by Ambhi, the king of gandhara-taxila and Ambi secretly assisted Alexander
 aambhi raja poras ko apana dushman samajhataa tha
 Alexander sent a message to Porus, in which he wrote to Porus surrendering to Alexander, but Porus then did not accept Alexander's subjection
 agle panne par yuddh kaa varnan


 Alexander's nobles were fully confident of winning the war on the strength of spies and deceit
 raja puru ke shatru laalchee aambhi kii sena lekar sikandar ne jhelum paar kii
 Raja Puru whom the Yavni himself describes as above 7 feet, with his powerful Gajsena, broke on the Yavani army
 poras kii hasti sena ne unaniyon kaa jis bhayankar rup se sanhaar kiya tha usase sikandar or uske sainik aatankit ho uthe the
 Indians had the stubbornness of every citizen to kill a foreigner, powerful Gaj Sena and some unseen weapons like Satfuta spear so that a single soldier could kill many enemy soldiers and horsemen including horse
 is yuddh main pehle din hi sikandar kii sena ko jamkar takkar mili
 Many valiant soldiers of Alexander's army were casualties
 yavani saradaaron ke bhayakrant hone ke baavjood sikandar apane hath par ada rahaa or apni vishisht angrakshak evam ant: pratiraksha tukdi ko lekar wo bich yuddh kshetra main ghus gaya
 There could be no threat to any Indian commander being on elephants, the king is far away
 raja puru ke bhai amar ne sikandar ke ghode bookifilas ko apane bhaale se maar daalaa or sikandar ko jameen par gira diya
 The Greek army had never seen this happen in all its wars
 sikandar jameen pargira to saamne raja puru talwaar liye saamne khadaa tha
 Sikandar was just a moment's guest when Raja Puru shouted
 yah dar nahin tha, shaayad yah arya raja kaa kshaatr dharm tha, baharhaal tabhi sikandar ke angrakshak use teji se vahaan se bhaga le gaye
 And thus Alexander lost his only and last war
 Alexander was so damaged by Porus the Great that Alexander died in Babylon while on his way back home

 i enter this cave and find out who is carrying the gem
 itnaa kahkar ve sabhi yadavon ko gupha ke mukh par chhod kar us gupha ke bheetar chale gayi
 Going there, he saw that the bright gem playing with a bear of a bear
 shri krishna ne us mani ko vahaan se uthaa liya
 Seeing this, Jambavant became very angry and pounced to kill Shri Krishna
 jambavant or shri krishna main bhayankar yuddh hone laga
