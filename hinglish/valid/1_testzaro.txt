 The principles of management can be considered different from pure science
 prabandh ke siddhant khalis vigyaan ke siddhanton ke samaan beloch nahin hote hai
 Because they are related to human behavior, they are used according to the demands of the situation
 vyavsaay ke prabhavit karne vaale maanviya vyavhaar evam takanic kabhi sthir nahin hote hai
 They always change
 udaahranarth, soochna evam sampreshan takneekee ke abhaav main ek prabandhak ek sankuchit kshetra main faile chote kaarybal kaa paryvekshan kar saktaa he
 The advent of information and communication technology has enhanced the ability of managers to manage a vast business empire spread across the globe

 To develop an understanding of the principles of management, it will also be useful to know that this theory is not new
 prabandh ke siddhanton evam prabandh kii takneekon main antar hota he
 Technique means process and methods
 yah icchit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye vibhinn charnon kii shrunkhlaa hote hai
 Principles serve as guidance in decision making or action in using techniques
 isi prakaar se siddhanton ko mulyon se bhinn samajhnaa chahie
 Value refers to accepting or desiring something
 mulya naitiktapurna hote hai
 Principles are the basic truth or guide of behavior
 mulya samaaj main logon ke vyavhaar ke liye saamaanya niyam hote hai jinka nirmaan samaan vyavhaar ke dwaara hota he jabaki prabandh ke siddhanton kaa nirmaan kaary kii paristhitiyon main anusandhan dwaara hota he tathaa ye takneekee prakruti ke hote hai
 While practicing the principles of management, values cannot be disregarded because business has to fulfill social and moral responsibilities towards society
 prakruti kaa arth he kisi bhi cheez ke gun evam visheshtaayen
 Principles are general formal statements that apply only in certain circumstances, they are developed by the observation, testing, and personal experience of managers, their contribution in developing management as both science and art depends on how they And how effectively they can explain managerial behavior and predict it
 Not
 in siddhanton ko viksit karnaa vigyaan he to inke upyog ko kala mana ja saktaa he
 These principles give credibility to the practical aspects of teaching and academic ability to management
 prabandh ke ucch padon par pahunchnaa janm ke kaaran nahin balki aavashyak yogyataon ke kaaran hota he
 It is clear that with the development as a management profession, the importance of the principles of management has increased
 siddhant, kaary ke liye maargdarshan kaa kaary karte hai
 They explain the relation between cause and result
 prabandh karte samay, prabandh ke kaary niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nideshan evam niyantran prabandh kii kriyaayein hai
 While the principles are helpful in making decisions to managers when performing these tasks
 nimna bindu prabandh ke siddhanton kii prakruti ko sankshep main bataate hai
 The principles of management can be applied in all types of organizations
 yah sanghathan vyavsaayik evam gaiyr-vyavsaayik, chote evam bade, saarvajanik tathaa nijee, vinirmaan evam seva kshetra ke ho sakate hai
 But the extent to which they can be used will depend on the nature of the organization, business functions, scale of operations, etc
 udhaaharan ke liye, adhik utpaadakta ke liye kaary ko chote-chote bhaagon main baanta janaa chahie tathaa prayek karmchaaree ko apane kaary main dakshata ke liye prashikshit karnaa chahie
 This principle can be especially used in government offices where there are daily dispatch clerks for receiving and sending mail or deeds, data entry operators, peons, officers, etc
 for entering data into computers
 ye siddhant simit daayitv companiyon main bhi prayukt hote hai, udaahranarth utpaadan, vitt, vipanan tathaa anusandhan evam vikaas aadi
 The extent of division of work may vary by circumstance
 saamaanya maargdarshan-siddhant kaary ke liye maargdarshan kaa kaary karte hai lekin ye, sabhi prabandhkeey samasyaon kaa taiyaar, shatpratishat samaadhaan nahin hote hai
 The reason for this is that real situations are very complex and dynamic and are the result of many elements
 lekin siddhanton ke mahatva ko kam karke nahin aanka ja saktaa kyonki, chote se chota dishanirdesh bhi kisi samasya ke samaadhaan main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 For example, if a conflicting situation arises in two departments, managers may prioritize the organization's broader objectives to deal with it
 prabandh ke siddhanton kaa sabhi prabandhakon ke anubhav evam buddhi chaaturya evam shodh ke dwaara hi nirmaan hota he
 For example, everyone feels that discipline is essential for achieving any objective
 yah siddhant prabandh ke siddhanton kaa ek ang he
 On the other hand, testing can be done to check the effect of improving physical conditions to reduce heavy pressure to solve the problem of workers' fatigue
 loch-prabandh ke siddhant beloch nuskhe nahin hote jinako maananaa anivaary hi ho
 They are flexible and managers can improve them according to the demand of the situation
 aisa karne ke liye prabandhakon ko paryaapt chhot hoti he udhaaharan ke liye sabhi adhikaron kaa ek hi vyakti ke paas hona athwa unka vibhinn logon main vitaran prayek udhyam kii sthiti evam paristhitiyon par nirbhar karegaa
 By the way, each principle is a weapon which is different to fulfill different objectives and the manager has to decide in which circumstances he should use which principle
 prabandh ke siddhanton kaa lakshya maanviya vyavhaar ko prabhavit karnaa hota he
 Hence the principles of management are mainly of practical nature
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki yah siddhant vastu sthiti evam ghatana se sambhddha nahin hote hai
 The only difference is how much importance is being given to someone
 siddhant sanghathan ke uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye maanviya evam bhautik sansadhano ke bich parsparik sambandh ko bhalee-bhanti samajhane main sahaayak hote hai
 For example, while planning the factory, it will be kept in mind that the work flow for the system should match the flow of goods and human activities
 prabandh ke siddhant, kaaran evam parinaam ke bich sambandh sthapit karte hai jisase ki unhen badi sankhya main samaan paristhitiyon main upyog kiya ja sake
 It tells us what the consequences can be if one theory is used in a particular situation
 prabandh ke siddhant kam nishchit hote hai kyonki yah mukhyatah maanviya vyavhaar main prayukt hote hai
 In real life, circumstances are not always the same
 isliye kaaran evam parinaam ke bich sahi-sahi sambandh sthapit karnaa kathin hota he
 Nevertheless, management principles help managers to establish these relationships to some extent, which is why they are useful
 apaat sthiti main apeksha kii jaati he ki koi ek uttardaayitv tathaa anya uskaa anukaran karen
 But if there is a situation of different types of introductory specialties like to set up a new factory, then it would be appropriate to get more cooperation in decision making
 prabandh ke siddhanton kaa prayog anishchit hota he athwa samay vishesh kii maujuuda paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 Changes can be made in the use of principles as required
 udhaaharan ke liye karmchaariyon ko nyyochit paarishramik milanaa chahie, lekin nyyochit kya he iskaa nirdhaaran bahut se tatwon ke dwaara hoga
 These include the contribution of the employees, the paying capacity of the employer and the prevailing wage rate in the occupation we are studying
 prabandh ke siddhanton main nihit gun evam visheshtaon kaa varnan kar lene ke pashchaat aapke liye prabandhkeey nirnay lene main in siddhanton ke mahatva ko samajhnaa saral hoga
 But before that, you can read the 'objective Study' of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, a highly successful Indian businessman and Chief Executive Officer of Biocon, in the accompanying box
 aap dekhenge ki kis prakaar se vah biotechnology kshetra, jise bahut hi kam log jaanate the, ko ek atyadhik laabh kamaane vaali company main parivartit kar diya tathaa unhone vah naam kamaaya jo kisi bhi vyakti kaa swapn ho saktaa he
 The importance of management principles is due to their utility
 yah prabandh ke vyavhaar kaa upyogi sookshm gyaan detaa he evam prabandhkeey aacharan ko prabhavit karata he
 Managers can use these principles to fulfill their responsibilities and responsibilities
 aap yah to maanenge ki prayek sargarbhit cheez nihit siddhant ke dwaara shasit hoti he
 The attempt of the theorist of management has always been to search for the underlying principles and should remain so that they can be used naturally for management in repetitive situations
 prabandh ke siddhanton ke mahatva ko nimna binduon ke rup main samajhaayaa ja saktaa he- Management principles make managers useful in real world situations
 in siddhanton ko apnaane se unke prabandhkeey sthiti evam paristhitiyon ke sambandh main gyaan, yogyata evam samaj main vruddhi hogi
 With this, the manager will learn something from his past mistakes and will save time by solving problems arising repeatedly
 is prakaar prabandh ke siddhant, prabandh kshamta main vruddhi karte hai udhaaharan ke liye, ek prabandhak din pratidin ke nirnay adhinsthon ke liye chhod saktaa he tathaa swayan vishisht kaaryon ko karegaa jiske liye uski apni visheshgyata kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For this, he will follow the principle of transfer of authority
 company ko uplabdh maanviya evam bhautik donon sansaadhan simit hote hai
 They have to be used to the maximum
 inke adhiktam upyog se abhipraay he, ki sansadhano ko is prakaar se upyog kiya jaae ki unase kam se kam laagat par adhiktam laabh praapt ho sake
 With the help of principles, managers can predict the relation of cause and result in their decisions and actions
 isse galatiyon se shiksha grahan karne kii niti main hone vaali kshati se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Manipulation of managerial behavior is necessary for effective administration so that managerial rights can be conveniently utilized
 prabandh ke siddhant, prabandh main swechhachaar kii seemaa nirdhaarit karte hai jisase ki prabandhakon ke nirnay vyaktigat pansad evam pakshpaat se mukt rahen
 For example, decisions by managers in determining annual budgets for various departments are based on the principle of contribution to the objectives of the organization, rather than relying on their individual preferences
 nirnay, nirdhaarit uddeshyon ke rup main vichaarneey evam nyyochit tathyon par aadhaarit hone chahien
 It should be timely, real and worthy of measurement and evaluation
 prabandh ke siddhant vichaarpurn nirnay lene main sahaayak hone chahie
 Yes, we insist on logic and not on blind faith

 It is based on a rational assessment of the situation

 You have read that the principles of management are flexible, which can be adapted to the dynamic business environment
 udhaaharan ke liye, prabandh ke siddhant shram-vibhaajan evam vishishtikaran ko badhaava dete hai
 In modern times this principle applies to all types of businesses
 companiyaan apane mul kaary main vishistataa praapt kar rahi hai tathaa anya vyavsaayik kaaryon ko chhod rahi hai
 In this context, one can take the example of the decision of Hindustan Lever Ltd
, which has left the business of chemicals and seeds separate from its original work

 And with time, their new and contemporary meanings are coming out from the interpretation of principles
 isiilie yadi aaj koi samta kii baat karata he, to yah mazdooree ke sambandh main hi nahin hoti
 This principle also applies to the value of the customer, taking care of the environment, dealing with business associates

 prabandh ke siddhant prabandh vishay ke gyaan kaa muladhar hai
 They are used as the basis of management training, education and research
 aap avashya jaanate honge ki prabandh sansthaanon main pravesh ke purv prabandh kii pariksha lee jaati he
 Do you understand that these exams can be developed without understanding the principles of management and how they can be used in different circumstances
 yah siddhant prabandh ko ek shaastra ke rup main viksit karne kaa praarambhik aadhaar taiyaar karte hai
 Professional theories such as MB-A-BB-A- also teach these principles as part of the preparatory level curriculum
 yah siddhant bhi prabandh main vishistataa laate hai evam prabandh kii nayi takneekon ke vikaas main sahaayak hote hai
 We see that the development of technologies such as operational research, cost accounting, timely, canbons and cages has resulted from further research into these principles

 Knoll has no policy regarding source or neutrality
 nol ke kuch prishth ekaadhik lekhakon kii raay ke dastavej hai or duusare bikri ke liye utpaadon ke varnan hai
 There are some articles that explain how to write an article or explain how to use the product
 kuch log lekh ke neeche tippanee darj kar sakate hai, jaise ki raay kaa khandan yaa utpaada kaa daawa asweekaar karne ke rup main matamat bhej sakate hai
 On January 16, 2009, Google announced that Knoll's has grown to 100,000 articles and users from 197 countries visited Knol's site on an average each day

 The word knoll, as Google defines, is "a unit of knowledge" that refers to both the project and the articles related to the project
 kai visheshgyon, nol ko vikipedia ke saath google kii pratispardhaa karne ke prayaas ke rup main dekhte hai, jabaki duusare pariyojnaon main antar kii ore sanket karte hai
 According to Manbar Udi, the pages of Naul, "the first means that anyone who wants to explore this subject for the first time would definitely want to read it"
 Any contributor and the creator of Naal's new article can also create And thus different authors may also have multiple articles on the same subject
 panditon ne lagaataar saikadon punrarit pravishtiyon kii ninda kii he jo is system ke parinaam ke hi falswaroop he
 Because many articles can have the same title, readers search the subject not just by the title, but by the subject matter
 unke lekhon ko saarvajanik sampadan kii anumati dene kaa lekhak ke paas vikalp he, taaki keval unke sah-lekhak hi use hajam kar saken yaa phir puri tarah se band kar den
 Knoll has a policy of his own, describing material that is unacceptable for the project
 praasangik nagnata kii anumati ne di he, lekin ashleelata, vanijyik yaa anyathaa, varjit he
 Discrimination or violent content is also forbidden
 2008 main google ne nol ko bahes ke liye ek manch ke rup main badhaava dena shuru kiya
 Permission was granted to design content promoting businesses, products or services, but asked to abstain from articles that do not contain original content and are designed to generate revenue only through advertising

 The non-lucrative Wikimedia Foundation, which bears the Wikipedia name and the servers that host Wikipedia projects, welcomed the initiative of Google Knoll by saying that "the more free content is, the better for the world
" " jabaki vikipedia ke lekh samuhik rup se rahe hai "likhaa ek tatasth drushti kone" kii niti ke tahat likhe jate hai, granthkaarita par bal dete hue nol vyaktigat visheshgyata ko ujagar karegaa or, scuidu, habpej, Helium

 Despite the difference in the response and format of the official Wikimedia, former Wikimedia Foundation chief Florence deword has expressed concern over the potential threat posed by Knoll to Wikipedia
 nol ke beta kii shuruyaat ke baad, google ke utpaada prabandhak sidrick dupont ne is vichaar par pratikriya vyakt kii ki google kaa uddeshy hi tha nol ek "vikipedia killer" banakar aage aae, yah kehete hue unhone kaha ki, "google isliye bahut khush he ki vikipedia itnaa adhik safal rahaa he
 Anyone who tries to kill them hurts us

 dupont ne jawaab diya ki font kaa istemaal mahaj ek sanyog tha kyonki is font kaa istemaal aamtaur par kiya jaataa he
 Because of the format of Knol, some people have said that Knol will be more about Wikipedia than Wikipedia
 According to Wolfgang Hanson, a writer at dailytech, Knoll may have planned about
com originally when it was on the verge of a takeover
 Hanson reported that several sources close to the sale said that Google was planning to acquire About
com, but about
com executives received information that Google had moved away from the 'about
com model to a Wiki-style model Was planning jiskaa arth yah hota ki About

 As you see here, slowly, Google is embracing an ad-based model in which people are willing to be allowed to go, money has a big impact on them

 Nicholas G
 Carr, a fluent technology commentator, rejected Google's predictive results of manipulative manipulation, saying that through search results, Google expects Knoll's pages to grow naturally, giving Wikipedia The challenge will be faced and Google will get another area of content through which Google can behave ads

 worldcat is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories which participate in the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative
 It is built and maintained collectively by the participating libraries
 The catalog was created in 1971
 It contains more than 300 million records, representing over 2 billion physical and digital assets in more than 470 languages, janvari 2014 ke anusaar 
 It is the world's largest bibliographic database
 OCLC makes worldcat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other fee-based OCLC services 
 worldcat was founded by Fred Kilgour in 1967
 In 2003, OCLC began the "open worldcat" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of worldcat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its member libraries' collections
 In 2006, it became possible to search worldcat directly at its website
 In 2007, worldcat Identities began providing pages for 20 million "identities", predominantly authors and individuals who are the subjects of published titles
 worldcat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model
 That is, worldcat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day
 worldcat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library, but does not provide that library's call number
 It also does not indicate if the item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons 
 worldcat also does not show if a library owns multiple copies of a particular title
 As an alternative, worldcat allows participating institutions to add direct links from worldcat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status
 However, this still requires users to open multiple web pages, each pointing to a different OPAC with its own distinctive user interface design, until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library

 Inflammation is an attempt by animals to remove dangerous or harmful stimuli and initiate the process of cell or tissue regeneration
 sujan sankraman kaa paryaay nahin he
 Inflammation is a form of local reaction produced by any stimulant in the body
 kisi bhi sthaan par sujan, lalaai, taap evam pidaa tathaa akaryaksham pradaah ke mukhya lakshan hai
 All these symptoms are caused by a reaction in the inflammation
 pradaah kaa ekmaatr uddeshy uttejk vastu se sharir ko mukti dilaanaa tathaa usase hui kshati ko purna karnaa hoti he
 Inflammation can occur in any part of the body
 phode funsi, ghaav, nymonia, sujan kaa hona, zukam, aankh dukhana, kaan bahna, kshay rog aadi sab pradaah ke hi vibhinn rup hai
 Stimulating objects, living and non-living things, can be divided into two parts
 sajiv, jaise rog ke sookshm jeevanu, paraseete aadi hai tathaa nirjeev, bhautik kaaran jaise garmi, sardi, vidyut, agyaat rashmiyaan, vijaateey padaarth, chot laganaa aadi tathaa rasinic padaarth, jaise kshar, amla, kaa anekon vish aadi, pradaah ke bhinn bhinn kaarak hai
 There are two main forms of inflammatory and long-lasting
 uttejk vastu kii maatra, sharir ke upar uttejk vastu kaa prabhaav or sharir kii pratirodh shakti ke upar pradaah nirbhar karata he
 Both living and non-living substances can produce both acute and long-term inflammation
 pradaah main teen prakaar kii pratikriyaayein hoti hai : Parganas or adenocarcinoma and excretion reactions predominate in acute inflammation, and adipocyte and amniocentesis in long-term inflammation
 in sabhi pratikriyaaon main rudhir evam lasika, tathaa sanyojak or indriya utak ke vividh avyav bhaag lete hai
 The microbes of the disease enter the body and start the reaction of inflammation in the connective and sensory tissues, on the mucosa or through the blood and lymph tubes
 yadi rogaanu adhik maatra main hue, yaa unki vifailli shakti adhik hui, athwa sharir kii pratirodh shakti kam hui, to pradaah ugr rup le letaa he
 These reactions take place in the following way: First, the arteries of blood shrink for short periods of time
 isse rudhir kaa bahaav un dhamnikaaon ke andar teevr ho jaataa he, tatpashchaat ye dhamnikaaye chaudee ho jaati hai or rudhir kaa pravaah unke andar mand ho jaataa he
 This increases the proliferation of microtubules and lymphatic ducts, causing the skin or mucosa above the inflammation to become red and hot
 in sookshm keshikaon kii bhitti kii koshikaaye apni sankhya main prachurodbhavan dwaara vruddhi kar amoeba kii bhanti kaa aakaar dhaaran kar leti hai, jisase koshikaon kii bhitti khurdari ho jaati he
 In the bone marrow, multicellular white cells come out of their follicular motion at the place of inflammation
 inke saath saath rakt ke laal kan bhi pradaah sthaan par nikal aate hai
 Thus, as a guard of the body, multicolored white cells come in the first line and encounter the enemy
 ye shwet koshikaaye sharir ke paryaavaran main kisi vishesh padaarth ke sankethik prativachan dwaara uttejit sthaan par ekatrit hoti hai
 This action is called chemical simulation
 rakt kaa taral padaarth us pradaah sthaan par, visheshtya sookshm koshikaon kii bhitti par, rogaanuon ke vish dwaara utpann uttejit shakti par nirbhar karte he
 Toxins of microbes form threadlike proteins, which multiply multicolored white cells from one place to another to form various blood particles, fluids, and adipose tissue
 utakon main is sujan ke dabaav se tantrika par tanaav, padane lagata he, jisase pidaa hone lagati he
 Among the various types of cells that participate in inflammation, multicellular and monolithic leukocytes of the blood and monolithic cells of the tissue participate in bactericidal activity by swallowing microbes, weakening their power
 ugr pradaah ke prarambh main bahukhandee shwet koshikaaye hi pradhan rup se jeevanubhakshan kriya sampann karti hai
 Sinogenic germs attract more of these cells towards them, so multicellular cells attract more in these types of inflammation, so only multicellular cells are found in this type of inflammation
 rakt kaa thos tathaa taral padaarth or utak ke vividh avyav rogaanuon dwaara utpann vish kii maatra ko halakaa karke sharir ko uske aghat se bachaate hai
 Both actions - first, bacteriophage and second, the coming out of the plasma by the blood vessels - protect the body from its shock by lightening the amount of toxin produced by microbes
 donon hi kriyaayein3⁄4 pratham, jeevanubhakshan tathaa dwitiya, plasma kaa raktanalikaaon dwaara baahar aana 3⁄4 sharir ko rogaanuon se utpann kshati se mukti dilaane kii ore agrasar karti hai
 All these diverse activities are carried out by the encouragement of chemical substances and nerves
 yadi rogaanuon kii sankhya tathaa uttejk shakti adhik na hui or sharir kii pratirodh shakti prachur maatra main hui, to bahukhandee shwet koshikaaye in jeevanuon par vijay kii ghoshnaa kar unako jeevanubhakshan kriya dwaara nigalkar tahas nahas kar detii hai
 In this activity, some multicellular cells also collapse
 in dharashaayi koshikaon se ek prakaar kii protein vilaayak vastu utpann hoti he, jo mrit utakon aadi ko ghulaakar pradaah ke taral padaarth tathaa dharashaayi shwet koshikaon or rogaanuon ko lasika kii nalikaaon dwaara pradaah sthaan se dur le jaati he
 If the germs are victorious by their venom, the multicellular cells in the inflammatory site are dashed in large amounts and take the form of pus
 pradaah laal rang se parivartit hokar pilaa rang dhaaran kar letaa hai
 This is called cooked boil
 jab phode kaa upachaar aushadhiyon dwaara karte hai, tab rogaanu nasht ho jate hai or us sthaan par pradaah ke ant main rakt kii tathaa utakon kii akhandee koshikaaye ekatrit hokar, teevr gati se jeevanu-bhakshan-kriya dwaara rogaanuon ko nigalkar nasht kar detii hai
 At the same time, these monolithic cells also swallow the dashed multicellular cells that have been killed by microbes, and thus the effort to restore the place of inflammation to a healthy state remains active
 utak koshikaaye apni sankhya me prachurodbhavan dwaara vruddhi kar, sthaan par sanyojak utak kii sahaayta se naveen rachana karti hai or vah sthaan phir se swasth ho jaataa he
 If germs attack the body moderately and in small amounts repeatedly, or the body's resistance is somewhat less, then the body responds to the attack of these microbes in another way
 in rogaanuon se utpann uttejk shakti kaa prabhaav sharir par shanai: shanai: padakar deergh sthaayee pradaah kaa rup le letaa he
 The secretion activity is very small in this flow, so multicellular cells also do not take special part in it
 inke sthaan par lasikanu, plasma koshikaaye or utakon kii akhandee koshikaaye prachurodbhavan kriya dwaara sankhya main vruddhi kar pradaah sthaan par ekatrit hoti hai
 Along with these, new microscopic vessels and cells are formed at that place and that place takes the form of chronic granulation tissue
 isi ko ghaav kehete hai
 The site of damage caused by inflammation of the wound is made healthy by increasing connective tissue proliferation

 In order to kill Hume during the freedom struggle, the fighters were completely surrounded by Hume, wearing a sari and hiding his identity

 These important things about Hume have been mentioned in the historical books of Etawah, in the thousand years of Etawah and in the history of Etawah

 The special thing is that at that time the emphasis of girl education was negligible, then only two girls came forward to study
 hum ne itawa ko ek bada vyapaarik kendra banane kaa nirnay lete huye apane hi naam ke upnaam hum se humganj kii sthapana karke bazaar khulwaaya jo aaj badalte samay main homganj ke rup me bada vyapaarik kendra ban gaya he
 Hume is considered to be an English officer who not only thought about his future too much but also worked on it
 vaise to itawa kaa vajood hum ke yahan aane se pehle hi ho gaya tha lekin hum ne jo kuch diya uske koi duusari misaal dekhne ko kahin bhi nahin milti
 Despite being an English officer, this Etawah love of Hume became a cause of trouble for him
 inhone bharat main bhinn-bhinn padon par kaam kiya or 1882 main avkaash grahan kiya
 At the same time, due to the unsatisfactory actions of the British Government, amazing awareness arose in India and they began to organize themselves
 is kaary main hum sahab se bharatiyon badi prerana mili
 In the last part of 1884, the Indian National Union was formed with the efforts of Surendranath Banerjee and Vyomesh Chandra Banerjee and Hume Sahab

 During his sabbatical, he tried to get more and more Indians to the British government

 In England, Hume sahab told the British that Indians are now able to manage their own country
 unako angrejon kii bhanti sab prakaar ke adhikaar praapt hone chahie or sarkari naukariyon main bhi samanta hona aavashyak he
 They will not sit peacefully until this happens

 The people of India started getting the biggest government posts

 Every suggestion of Hume sahib and Vyomeshchandra Banerjee was considered by the English government and consulted them in every government work
 hum apane ko bhartiya hi samajhate the
 He loved Indian food more
 gita tathaa bible ko pratidin padhaa karte the
 His speeches contained Indian ideas and how the Indian public can be made happy and how the British government should treat the Indian public, he used to say all these things in his articles and speeches
 ve kehete the ki bharat main ekta tathaa sanghatan kii badi aavashyaktaa he
 Whenever Indians will adopt both these qualities, at that time the British will leave India
