 These are - bahut se udyogon main shakti ke saath hi saath ushma kii bhi maang hoti he, jo vidhayan kaary ke liye aavashyak hoti he
 Since the absolute heat of saturated steam at 300 pounds per square inch is only four percent higher than the absolute heat at 30 pounds per square inch, the generation of high pressure steam would be more advantageous thermodynamically
 nishkarshan tarabine main is bhaap ko pehle kaary karne ke liye prasaarit kiya jaataa he evam maang ke anusaar bhaap kii kuch maatra ko nimna daab par vidhayan kaary ke liye baahar nikaal liya jaataa he

 If steam supply is not continuous, the thermometer is treated
 upar bataae gaye ushmasanchayak kii kshamta bhi simit hoti he
 When the amount of low-pressure steam is greatly reduced by demand, the steam pressure from the evaporator is lowered and sent to the turbine to meet this shortfall
 is tarah ucchdaab or nimnadaab par aanevalani bhaap ke do pradaay ek hi tarabine main aate hai
 This type of turbine is called mixed pressure turbine
 is tarabine main bhaap ingine dwaara nimnadababhaap-nikaas, yaa ushmasanchayak, kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he

 muktak kavy yaa kavita kaa vah prakaar he jisamen prabandhakiyata na ho
 In this, the said matter in one verse does not have any relation or relevance to what is said in the other verse
 kabir evam rahim ke dohe; mirabai ke padya aadi sab muktak rachanaaen hai
 Most of the Muktak Kavyas were composed in the Hindi language
 muktak shabd kaa arth he ‘apane aap main sampoorn’ athwa ‘anya nirpeksh vastu’ hona
 at: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa koi purvapar sambandh nahin hota
 prayek chand apane aap main purnat: swatantra or sampoorn arth dene vaala hota he
 In the Sanskrit poetry tradition, the word Muktak was first introduced by Anandvardhan
 It cannot be assumed that no one had knowledge of this direction of poetry before
 Acharya Dandi was acquainted with the name Muktak not as a right but an undefined poem
 Defining Muktak in 'agnipuran' said that: ”muktakan shloke evaikshchamatkaaraksham: satam” That is, the only one who has the ability to perform miracles is called Muktak
 Rajashekhar has also discussed the name Muktak
 Giving importance to Rasa, Anandvardhan said in relation to Muktak: ”tatra muktakeshu rasabandhabhiniveshin: kave: tadashrayamauchityam” That is, the abhinivesh or prestige of the rasa in Muktakas is the administrator of his bond and it is justified by the poet to take shelter of the same
 hemachandracharya ne muktak shabd ke sthaan par muktkaadi shabd kaa prayog kiya
 unhone uskaa lakshan dandi kii parampara main dete hue kaha ki jo anibaddh hon, ve muktadi hai
 In the modern era, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla of Hindi considered Muktak
 According to him: muktak main prabandh ke samaan ras kii dhara nahin rahati, jisamen katha-prasang kii paristhiti main apane ko bhuulaa hua pathak magn ho jaataa he or hriday main ek sthaayee prabhaav grahan karata he
 isamen to ras ke aise chhinte padate hai, jinamein hriday-kalika thodi der ke liye khil uthati he
 yadi prabandh ek vistrut vanasthali he, to muktak ek chunaa hua guladasta he
 isi se yah samaajon ke liye adhik upyukt hota he
 isamen uttarottar drishyon dwaara sangathit purna jivan yaa uske kisi purna ang kaa pradarshan nahin hota, balki ek romantic khand-drishy is prakaar sahasaa saamne laa diya jaataa he ki pathak yaa shrota kuch kshanon ke liye mantrmugdh sa ho jaataa he
 iske liye kavi ko manoram vastuon or vyapaaron kaa ek chota stavak kalpit karke unhen atyant sankshipt or shashakt bhashaa main pradarshit karnaa padataa he
 Acharya Shukla had said that the free power of language and the power of imagination was necessary for Muktak elsewhere
 Impressed by that, Govind Trigunayat presented the following definition: meri samaj main muktak us rachana ko kehete hai jisamen prabandhatv kaa abhaav hote hue bhi kavi apni kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaaj shakti ke sahare kisi ek romantic drishy, paristhiti, ghatana yaa vastu kaa aisa chitratmak evam bhavpurn varnan prastut karata he, jisase pathakon ko prabandh jaisaa anand aane lagata he
 Actually this definition is flawed
 It is not appropriate to say enjoyment like management
 In such a situation, the following definition of Muktak is also given: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa purvapar sambandh na hote hue bhi twarit gati se saadhaaraneekaran karne kii kshamta hoti he
 In my view, the definition of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is sufficient
 Ultimately, it can be called a chosen bouquet

 In the pronunciation of resonant vowels, air also comes out of the nose
 jaise :– aan, uun, en, maan, hoon, aaen
 2

2
3 Without Chandrabindu there is often scope for confusion in meaning
 jaise :– hans : hans, angana : anganaa, swang : swaang aadi main
 Therefore, Chandrabindu must be used to clear such confusion
 kintu jahaan chandrabindu ke prayog se chapai aadi main bahut kathinaayee ho or chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu kaa prayog kisi prakaar kaa bhram utpann na kare, vahaan chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu ke prayog kii chhot rahegi
 Like: - No, I, etc
 kavita aadi ke prasang main chand kii drushti se chandrabindu kaa yathasthaan avashya prayog kiya jaae
 Similarly, in the entrances of young children, where the chandrabindu is pronounced, it should be used everywhere in thick letters
 jaise :– kahan, hansnaa, aangan, sanvaarana, main, main, nahin aadi
 2

1 If Sanskrit words are used in Visarga, if they are used in the corresponding form, then Visarga must be used
 jaise :– ‘duhkhanubhuti’ main
 If Visarga has been omitted in the form of that word, then without Visarga in that form it will work
 jaise :– ‘dukh-sukh ke saathi’
 2
7
2 It is mandatory to use the used clause at the end of corresponding words
 yatha :– atah, punah, swatah, praayah, purnatah, multah, antat, vastutah, kramshah aadi
 2

2 The words conscience, antipura, morning etc
 should be written with visarga
 2

5 tadbhav / deshi shabdon main visarg kaa prayog na kiya jaae
 It would be wrong to write six on this basis
 chah likhnaa hi thik hoga
 2

6 The words peninsweep, termination, etc
 are also not dissonant in the corresponding form
 2
7
7 visarg ko varna ke saath milakar likhaa jaae, jabaki colon chihn shabd se kuch duuri par ho
 Like: - So, this is how: - 2
8
1 ko hal chihn kaha jaae na ki halant
 The light mark under the consonant indicates that the consonant is void, ie the consonant is purely consonant
 is tarah se 'jagat' halant shabd kaha jayega kyonki yah shabd vyanjanant he, swarant nahin
 2
8
2 According to Rule 2
1
2
2 of making conjunctions, only the markings will be used in the thumbnail
 jaise : chihn, buddha, vidwaan aadi main
 2

3 When the use of corresponding words is desirable, only halant forms should be used; Especially when all words or derived words are formed from them
 yatha prak :–, vaak-, sat-, bhagwan-, saakshaat-, jagat-, tejas-, vidyut- aadi
 In the corresponding address, only Rajan, o Lord, will be accepted
 hindi style main he raja, he bhagwaan likhe jaaen
 In words in which the hallmark has been lost, do not attempt to reinstate it
 jaise - mahaan, vidwaan aadi; kyonki hindi main ab 'mahaan' se 'mahanata' or 'vidwaanon' jaise rup prachlit ho chuke hai
 2
8
4 In grammar texts, only those words which are necessary to understand the word structure or are useful in terms of meaning are given to explain consonant conjunctions
 2
8
5 hindi main hrydayngam, uddhran, sanchit aadi shabdon kaa sandhi-viched samajhane kii aavashyaktaa prathit nahin hoti
 Similarly, there is a need to explain the meaning of words like 'interview', 'jagdish', 'hexkosh' only when their treaty is cited
 hindi main inhen swatantra shabdon ke rup main grahan karnaa hi acha hoga
 2
9
1 The spelling of Sanskrit-friendly words should be taken as-is
 at: 'brahma' ko 'bramha', 'chihn' ko 'chinh', 'urin' ko 'urin' main badalanaa uchit nahin hoga
 Similarly, imprudence, sight, exhibition, excess, trespass etc
 are not acceptable inaccurate usage
 inke sthaan par kramash: gruhit, drashtavy, pradarshnee, atyadhik, anadhikaar hi likhnaa chahie
 2
9
2 The corresponding words in which a consonant consonant has disappeared in the event of a combination of three consonants is not allowed to be written
 jaise :– arddh > ardh, tatva > tatv aadi
 2
10
1 Ai, au in Hindi is used to express two types of pronunciation
 pehle prakaar kaa uccharan 'he', 'or' aadi main mul swaron kii tarah hone laga he; jabaki duusare prakaar kaa uccharan 'gavaiya', 'kauwa' aadi shabdon main sandhyaksharon ke rup main aaj bhi surakshit he
 These signs should be used to express both types of utterances
 'gavayya', 'kavva' aadi sanshodhano kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Other examples are: Bhaiya, Syed, Ready, Hawa etc
 2
10
2 dakshin ke ayyar, nayyar, ramayya aadi vyaktinaamon ko hindi uccharan ke anusaar aiyar, naiyar, ramaiya aadi na likhaa jaae, kyonki mulbhasha main iskaa uccharan bhinn he

 should be written separately
 jaise :– main ghar jane vaala hoon, jane vaale log
 2

 will be written as one word in the form of additive suffix
 2
12
3 'vaala' jab pratyay ke rup main aayega tab to 2
12
2 ke anusaar milakar likhaa jayega; anyathaa alag se
 This is the directive word in this one, this one, the first one, the good one, the red one, the tomorrow one, etc
 atah ise alag hi likhaa jaae
 Similarly, the words with long hair girl, bearded man etc
 will be written separately
 isse ham rachana ke str par antar kar sakate hai
 Such as: -gaonwala - villager village house - village house 2

1 jahaan shrutimulak ya, va kaa prayog vikalp se hota he vahaan na kiya jaae, arthath kiye : kiye, nai : nayi, hua : huwa aadi main se pehle roopon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 This rule should be applied in all forms and situations of the verb, adjective, avayya etc
 jaise :– dikhaae gaye, ram ke liye, pustak liye hue, nai dilli aadi
 2
13
2 Where 'Y' is not the grammatical change but only the basic element of the word, there is no need to make optional dictative emotional change
 jaise :– sthaayee, avyayibhav, daayitv aadi 
 The words of arabic-persian origin from Urdu which have become a part of Hindi and whose foreign sounds have been converted into Hindi sounds can be accepted in Hindi only
 jaise :– kalam, kila, daag aadi 
 But where their pure use in foreign form is desired or it is necessary to state the accent, there should be in-place nukes in their prevalent forms in Hindi
 jaise :– khaanaa : kaanaa, raaj : raaj, fan : fan aadi
 In English words, where the semicircular 'O' sound is used, if the pure form is used in Hindi, the crescent moon should be used over the quantity of 'A'

 It states that Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should not be so eloquent that many new signs have to be added to its present Devanāgarī characters
 angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran maanak angrezi uccharan ke adhik-se-adhik nikat hona chahie
 There are some popular words in Hindi that have two forms of spelling being the same
 vidvatsamaj main donon roopon kii ek-si manyata he
 Some examples are: neck / neck, heat / heat, ice / ice, absolutely / absolutely, cold / cold, pedestal / chair, conscription / recruitment, leisure / leisure, tolerance / tolerance, back / back, finally / finally, utensils / Utensils, again / again, shop / shop, sickness / disease etc
