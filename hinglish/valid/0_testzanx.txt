 The expansion of the power of the white castes on this territory led to the destruction of a large section of the population of Indian groups and the loss of their cultures in general

 Some speculate that they are descendants of the ten lost castes of Israel, and some consider them to be the offspring of the lost sailors of Alexander's army
 uske sambandh main yah dharna bhi thi ki ve kinvadantiyon main varnit "atlantis mahadweep" athwa prashanth mahaasaagar ke "mu" naamak kaalpanik dweep ke mul nivaasiyon kii santan hai
 Due to the similarity between the Mayan Indian race of Central America and the architecture of ancient Egypt, it was also speculated that Indians came to America from Egypt or Egypt influenced countries
 is sandarbh main yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki jis kaal main maaya indianon ne mandiron kaa nirmaan aarambh kiya uske kai hajaar varsh pehle hi misr kii pracheen sthapatyastylee kaa hraas ho chukaa tha
 Before ancient anthropological discoveries were made in America, there was also the possibility that the ancestors of Indians developed as an independent branch of mankind on this land, but now it can be said with certainty that mankind on American continents In the development of a branch of the Kumbh, only the preserved remains of lemurs, tarsiers and monkeys of certain castes have been found on this territory
 pracheen maanav jatiyon ke adhyeta parishrampurvak khoj karne par bhi nikatmanav vanar athwa pracheen maanav koi avshesh yahan nahin paa sake hai
 In this way, it can be said that there was no possibility of independent development of any branch of mankind and the ancestors of the oldest inhabitants of this place would have settled here after coming from some other part of the world
 visheshgyon kaa mat he ki maanav is bhaag main bering street ke maarg se asia se aayaa
 In terms of physical characteristics, Indians can be unambiguously considered a branch of the Mongoloid species of Asia
 asiyon se alaska ke maarg dwaara indianon ke jo purvaj america aae the, nishchit rup se ve aadhunik maanav athwa "homo sepiuns" ke str tak viksit ho chuke the
 They must also have brought with them many elements of their original Asian culture
 ve sambhavat: agni ke upyog se parichit the or unhone prastaryugin samskruti ke astr shastron or upkarnon kaa nirmaan or upyog bhi sikh liya tha
 From the difficult cold they encountered on this route, it can be easily inferred that they must have covered their body with some kind of garment and possibly even temporary house-building art
 Must have been familiar

 For several thousand years from Asia, human groups in different parties kept coming to America's land
 kai sau varsho tak in samoohon ko barf se dhake sthalmarg se hi aana padaa; parantu yah sambhav he ki baad main aanevaale samooh aanshik rup se naavon main bhi yatra kar sake hon
 The study of the remains of ancient Indians has confirmed the belief that the groups that came here earlier had more of the physical characteristics of the australoid-mongol species, and that later groups had predominance of elements of the Mongoloid species
 kalantar main in samoohon ke parsparik mishran se indianon main mongolaide prajati kii shareerik visheshtaayen pramukh ho gai
 These Adi Indians brought with them some elements of pre-neolithic cultures on this land
 crobar ne unki moulik samskruti kii punarrachana kaa praytn karte hue un samskruti tatwon kii suchi banaai he jo sambhavat: aadi indianon ke saath america aae the
 Stone tools, rubbish, bone and horn tools made by pressure or wear, the use of fire, the art of making traps and crates, bow and spear throwing instruments and domesticated dogs are probably the main elements of the original culture of Indians
 Can go asia se america aakar indianon ke purvaj apni mul asian shakha se ekadam alag ho gaye athwa unhone usase kisi prakaar kaa sambandh banaae rakhaa, is vishay par vidwaanon main matbhed he
 On the basis of the physical difficulties in maintaining such relations, it can be easily inferred that even if there was a relationship among these terrains, it would have been very limited in its extent and influence
 kalantar main saanskrithik vikaas kii jo dishaaen in samoohon ne apanaai ve bahm samskritiyon se prabhavit nahin hui
 These groups developed the new-age culture independently
 unhone alpaka, lamas or turki aadi nae praaniyon ko paaltu banaaya
 Also, he first started cultivating vegetation like maize, cocoa, manioc or cassava, tobacco and various types of beans
 yah aashcharya kaa vishay he ki nav-prastar-yugin maaya indianon ne aise anek samskrititatvon kaa avishkaar kar liya jo europe tathaa sansar ke anya bhaagon main tamra-kaansya-yug kii apekshaakrit viksit samskritiyon main avishkrut hue
 The metal age came late in this part, but Iztec and Maya had learned the art of melting Indian gold and silver long before using bronze

 On the basis of the similarities and differences of Indian cultures, the dancers have divided America into nine cultures

 aurangzeb ne unhen 'savai' kii oopaadhi di thi - jiskaa pratikatmak-arth yahi he ki ve apane samakalinon se 'savaya' the
 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly on the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanaah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua

e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jaisingh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'stringent calls' to him to attend
 From his father's time Delhi-emperor He wanted to call them in the south to take his military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade

 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae
 ' vidmbana haratangez he ki jis aurangzeb ne kabhi inhen 'savai' kah kar sammaan diya vahi baad main vastutah inase is kadar naaraaz or purvaagrahagrast tha ki usne ye apmanjanak ajna jari kii- "jaisingh ko masanad par asana na de kar, neeche zamin par bichhi 'sujani' par baithne ko kaha jaay!" Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704

 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When King Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to compromise with both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh

 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs

 In the end there was a treaty with At Singh

 Emperor Farrukh Sier gave the princely state of Bundi to Bhimsingh Hada king Kota and he also captured Bundi
 jaisingh ne prayaas karke badshaah se bundi waapas raja budhsingh hada ko dilvaayi
 The emperor from Delhi ordered them to climb Chudaman Jat of Bharatpur, which had caused a great disturbance in the area of agra from looting

 Despite this failure in the area of chudaman, he was respected by the emperor

 us samay unke paas 20 hajaar rajput savaar dilli main maujuud the tathaa bundi ke buddhasingh hada bhi unheen ke saath the
 But the king did not dare to take this military action
 vah saiyadon ko kisi tarah khush karne main laga rahaa
 Finally, the Sayyids asked the emperor Jaisingh to leave Delhi
 jaisingh ne badshaah ko sachet kiya ki unke jane se badshaah kii jaan ko khatra ho jayega lekin yah salaah badshaah kii samaj main nahin ai
 Jaisingh left Delhi on 13 February 1719 AD

 On April 17- 18, Syed brothers, At Singh Jodhpur and Bhimsingh Kota together killed the emperor Farrukhsiyar in Delhi
 jaisingh ne elahabaad ke soobedaar chhabila ram or nizaam se saiyadon ke viruddh bhi patr-vyavhaar kiya
 They wanted everyone to oust the Sayyids together
 inhone chhatrasaal bundela ko bhi yuddh ke liye bulaayaa
 The Sayyids sent several armies to surround them from many sides
 On 5 July, Var Abdullah Khan, along with the nominal Emperor Rafiudullah, marched on Jai Singh and reached Agra via Mathura, where rebellion against the Sayyids was taking place
 jaisingh ne bhi saiyadon se puure taur se muqabla karne kii taiyaari kar lee thi par yuddh main ravaanaa hone ke pehle unhone brahmanon ko bulaakar amer rajya daan main de diya or kesaria bana dhaaran karke ve saiyadon se ladaai ke liye ravaanaa hue
 They had reached Toda Raisingh from Amer

 Jaisingh felt disappointed
 ant main atsingh jaisingh ko apane saath jodhpur le gayi jahaan unhone apni putree kaa jaisingh se vivaah kiya
 The Syed gave Rs 20 lakh to Jaisingh, so that they could buy Amber back from the Brahmins
 us samay bhi jaisingh ko atsingh jodhpur par vishwaas nahin tha isliye ve apane vivaah main bhi jirahabakhtar pahan kar gayi the
 When the two Sayyid forces were defeated by the Nizam in the south, Hussain Ali Khan Syed, accompanied by Emperor Mohammad Shah, proceeded to suppress the Nizam with a large army

 usne dilli pahunchane par badshaah ne apane naye var mohammad amin khan ko unke dere par lene bheja
 On coming to the court, the emperor gave him a big welcome and gave many gifts
 unke mansab main 4000 savaar or badha die gaye
 On this occasion, he gave them two crores of rupees in reward / money which he humbly refused to take

 After 1735 AD, the Marathas also started taking their advice and respecting them

 inhone uskaa bada swaagat-satkar kiya
 Once again, they besieged the fort of Thun

 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice

 swayan abulafajl ke kathananusaar uskaa dhyey mahaan samrat kii smriti ko surakshit rakhana tathaa jigyaasu kaa pathpradarshan karnaa tha
 It received considerable respect in the Islamic world of the Mughal period; But the Western scholars, and through them Indians, were conscious of this invaluable fund when Gladwin first translated it partially during the time of Warren Hastings; Blockman and Jarrett then did a full translation

 The first part has the emperor's praise and the palace and court details

 In the end, the author has mentioned himself

 Its main feature is that instead of giving priority to wars, conspiracies and perennials, the ruling class has been given adequate space
 ek prakaar se yah aadhunik bharat kaa pratham gazetier he
 Its greatest importance is that a progressive and lofty approach has been established by giving Hindu society, religion and philosophy a uniquely virtuous place in opposition to bigotry and fanaticism
 abulafajl aise prakand vidvan anya kaal main bhi sambhav tha, kintu in-e-akabari jaisaa granth akbar ke kaal main hi sambhav tha, kyonki asaadhaaran vidvan or asaadhaaran samrat kaa bauddhik str par udaatt bhaawanaaon kii prerana se purna samanvay sambhav ho sakaa tha
 ain-i-akbari is mainly blamed for exaggeration in the emperor's praise, but according to Blockman's statement "

" " or yah nirvivaad he ki akbar kaaleen raajnneetik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik itihaas ke adhyayan ke liye in-e-akabari ek kosh kaa mahatv rakhata he

 Utthya became very angry and drank the whole sea
 lekin tab bhi varun use waapas nahin kiye
 Due to Utthya's wish, the lake of Varuna dried up and the sea was washed away
 desh ke suukh jane ke baad varun ne utathy ke saamne khud ko pesh kiya or bhadraa ko waapas laayaa

 First, scientist Michelson's experiments established a natural standard, the wavelength of, which is unanimously assumed that this standard is reproducible with at least as high a level of accuracy as is found in comparisons of fluid parameters
 lekin is maanak kii sarvotkrisht visheshta yah he ki yah dirghakaalik vicharan kii sambhaavna se pare he, jabaki anya sabhi prakaar ke maanakon kaa hi prayog hota he
 In any part of the earth, we can verify fluid parameters with the help of this natural standard
 yadi dravyatmak maanakon ko antarrashtriya kendriya prayogshaala main bhejkar adiprarup meter se tulana karaani hoti he, to avaagaman main use haani pahunchne kii sambhaavna rahati he, kintu prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se ham apni hi prayogshaala main yah kaary kar sakate hai
 The second is that such reforms led to the development of flat-headed standards
 aajkal aise dand bhi prapya hai jinke sire ekadam samaantar hai
 The lengths of such punishments are derived directly from optical interference rather than from the linear standard
 micelson ke vyatikaranmaapi kaa upyog is baat ko jaanane main bhi kiya gaya ki ek maanak meter main kitni prakaash kii tarangen aati he tathaa unki sankhya kya he? micelson ne 150 centegrade taap tathaa 760 mimi0 vayumandal ke dabaav par antarrashtriya meter kaa, jo paris ke paas maap or taul ke antarrashtriya santhaan main rakhaa hua he, maan cadmium kii laal taragon main, gyaat kiya

 fabri paro ke baad ke prayogon se gyaat hua ki 15° sein0 tathaa 760 millimetre dabaav par shushk hawa main ek meter main yah sankhya 15,53,164

 If Michaelsson's experiments are modified to have the effect of water vapor, it is clear that there is no difference in the value of the two
 is baat kaa pramaan he ki dravyatmak maanak gaj apane nirmaankaal se lekar aaj tak sabhavat: 0
0002 inch ghat chukaa he, lekin jahaan tak antarrashtriya adiprarup meter kaa sawaal he vah aparivartit rahaa he
 The experiments of Michelson and Fabry Para have also proved this

 All standard meters of matter are made of an alloy, which consists of 90% platinum and 10% metal called iridium
 is prakaar main metron ko aadharbhoot maanakon ke liye sabase santoshprad mana jaataa he
 In many works, where the problem of very accurate measurement arises, it is necessary that we treat such a material whose thermal expansion is nominal

 The errors in this are that its density is relatively low and it is absorbent
 hawa main sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karte samay ye maanak vaayu ke vibhinn aaytanon ko hataate hai
 Therefore, consideration of upper buoyancy effect must be taken in comparing the standards of the code
 yadi maanak kaa ghanatv kam hoga, to utplavan sanshodhan zyada hoga
 The accuracy achieved in comparison to the platinum-iridium standards is based on the fact that their density is not only very high but very close
 iske kaaran utplavan sanshodhan bahut hi kam hota he
 Buoyancy modification arises as a problem in comparison to weights whose density varies greatly, such as platinum, quartz, and brass, etc

 yoddha jatiyaan, 1857 kii kranti ke baad, british kaaleen bharat ke sainya adhikariyon banaai gayi oopaadhi thi
 He classified all the castes as "warrior" and "non-warrior" castes

 An alternative hypothesis is that most of the British trained Indian soldiers were in the revolution of 1857, as a result of which the military recruitment process was favored by those who were the masters of British rule and hence reduced the recruitment from the Bay Area in the Bengal Army
 Was gone or stopped
 ukt dharna bharat ke vaidic hindu samaaj kii chaturvarniya vyavastha me "kshatriya varna" ke rup me pehle se hi vidyaman thi jiskaa shabdic arth "yoddha jati" he
 In the process of establishing authority over India, the British rule had to face fierce opposition in many areas, while in some other areas they had easily controlled
 aise me british adhikariyon ne " yoddha jatiyon" kii talash kii jo yaa to shikari the, yaa krishak samskruti se the jinka ladaaiyaan ladane kaa itihaas rahaa tha
 Other castes were not considered "warrior castes" because of their choice of lifestyle or sedition

 British commander and scholar Lieutenant General Sir Makmun wrote in his quotations that "working in the British Army was considered unrighteous and shameful, so such a step was necessary otherwise the entire British army was defeated without taking a sword out of the sheath or without firing a single shot
" Would have happened
 " atah maatr yoddha jatiyon ke sadasyon kii hi sena main bhartee british policy ban gayi tathaa british raaj ke bhartee niamakon kaa abhinn hissaa bani rahi
 According to Jeffery Greenhut, "the interesting feature of the theory of warrior caste was that scholars and educated Indians were considered cowards and the backward and uneducated classes were defined as brave castes
 " The British considered the fighters brave and powerful but they were considered less meritorious and unworthy of the leadership of large army troops etc
 inhen rajnatik rup se adheen va adhikariyon ke prati naram rukh vaala bhi mana jaataa tha
 Due to these reasons, the principle of fighter caste was kept separate from the recruitment of military officers and the recruitment was based on social level and loyalty towards the British Raj
 strot vishisht ise dwaara rachit "chhadam-aachaar sanrachana" kii sangya dete hai jise Frederick Sleigh Roberts ne prachaarit kiya jiske baad dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay sainikon kii sankhya me baari kami ho gyi thi va british sarkaar ko gaiyr ladaaku jatiyon ki sena me bhartee ke liye baadhya hona padaa tha
 On the dissolution of this principle, Winston Churchill wrote to the Indian Commander in Chief at the time of the war that he should rely more and more on the fighting castes
 is siddhanth ke aalochakon kaa mat he ki british hukumat ke is siddhanth me vishwaas ko bal dene kaa kaaran 1857 kii kranti rahi thi
 In the revolution, Bengal Native Infantry revolted against British rule under the leadership of constable Mangal Pandey

 tab se ladaaku jati kii bhartee main in logon ko praathamikta di jane lagi va krantikariyon kaa samarthan karne vaali vidrohi ucch vargi jatiyon ki bhartee pratibandhit kii gayi
 Other authors, such as Heather Streets, argue that military officials published the image of combat troops by writing regiments of history and glorifying costumes and weapons in paintings
 An American Jewish writer, Richard Schulz, described the combatant concept as a political gain by the British government
 For this, the effort was made to "divide and rule" among Indians
 british hukumat ne bhartiya up mahadweep ke kuch jati samoohon ko "ladaaku jatiyaan" ghoshit kar diya jo ki purv main "punjab bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium 1925" ke tahat aadhikarik rup se " krishak jati" ke rup me vargeekrut thim
 The administration considered both the words synonymous when listing them
 nimna jatiyon ko ladaaku jati kii shrenee me soochivaddh kiya gaya tha: Other mass communities that were added to the warrior caste at different times - kaha jaataa he ki prachlan main na hone ke baavjood bhi pakistan ne khaskar 1965 ke bharat paak yuddh ke purv "yoddha jati siddhanth" par bharosa yah soch kar dikhaaya ki vah aasaani se bharat ko parajeet kar sakenge
 On the basis of this theory, it was also said that a Pak soldier is equal to four to ten Hindu or Indian soldiers, so the majority of the enemy army can also be won
 purvi pakistan ke bengaaliyon ne bhi sena par aarope lagaaya ki is siddhanth ke maddenjar unhe purvi pakistan kaa nivasee hone ke baavjood punjabi yaa pastunon se kamatar yoddha mana jaataa he
 According to Pakistani writer Hasan Askari Rizvi, the reason for the low recruitment of Bengalis in the Pakistani army was that the West Pakistanis could not recover from the "warrior caste doctrine"
 pakistani saini lekhak yah bhi maanate hai ki 1971 kii paraajay main aanshik rup se trutipurna "ladaaku jaati" niti bhi jimmedaar thi jiske chalate yah maan liya gaya tha ki bhartiya sena ko parajeet kar diya jaayegaa

 Pollination of alfalfa is somewhat difficult, as western bees, which are used as pollinators, are not suitable for this work; The bulb that receives the pollen of the alfalfa flower is often shaken and collides with the head of the pollen bee, which helps to transfer pollen to the bee that is seeking the bait
 lekin pashchimi madhumakhiyaan baar-baar sar par chot khaanaa pasand nahin karatin, ve is kriya ko phool ke bagal se paraag khinch kar parrast karti he
 In this way bees collect only pollen but do not collect pollination, thus they do not pollinate when they move to another flower
 As the aged bees fail to pollinate alfalfa, most pollinations are done by young bees who have not yet learned the magic of stealing from a flower without hitting a pollen-ingested egg

 Although Monsanto won technically, the lower court's ruling was supported, which meant that GM alfalfa would have to be legally free of many regulatory hurdles on a commercial scale
 And one decision that could have a wider impact on future GM cases is the belief of justice officials that GM crops can cause environmental harm through hybrid-pollination

 shri ramdev ji kaa janm bhadva sudi pancham ko vikram sanwat 1409 ko barmer jile kii shiv tehsil ke undu kashmir gaanv main somvaar ke din hua jiskaa pramaan shri ramdev ji ke shrimukh se kahe gayi pramaanon main he jisamen likhaa he samvat chaturdash saal navam chait sudi pancham aap shri mukh gaayi bhane raja ramdev chait sudi pancham ko ajmal ke ghar main aayon jo ki tuvanr vansh kii bahi bhaat par raja ajmal dwaara khud apane hatho se likhvaya gaya tha jo ki pramanit he or gokuldaas dwaara krit shri ramdev choubees pramaan main bhi pramanit he aman ghatoda The child is the happiness of the parents' life
 raja ajmal ji putr prapti ke liye daan punya karte, sadhu santon ko bhojan karaate, yajna karaate, nity hi dwarkanath kii puja karte the
 In this way, King Ajmal Ji reached Dwarka thinking of a way to kill the Bhairav demon
 jahaan ajmal ji ko bhagwaan ke saakshaat darshan hue, raja ke aakhon main aansu dekhakar bhagwaan main apane pitambar se aansu ponkar kaha, he bhaktaraj ro mat main tumhaara sara du:kha jaanata hoon
 i am very happy to see your devotion, ask what you want, i will fulfill all your wishes
 bhagwaan kii aseem krupa se prasann hokar bole he prabhu agar aap meri bhakthi se prasann hai to mujhe aapke samaan putr chaiye yane aapako mere ghar putr banakar aana padegaa or rakshas ko markar dharm kii sthapana kerani padegi
 Then Lord Dwarkanath said- o devotee! Go, i promise you that first your son will be Viram Dev, then Ajmal ji said, o God, what is small and what is great for a son, God said - second i will come to your house myself
 ajmal ji bole he prabhu aap mere ghar aaoge to hamen kya maaloom padegaa ki bhagwaan mere dhar padhaare hai, to dwarkanath ne kaha ki jis raat main ghar par aaunga us raat aapke rajya ke jitne bhi mandir he usamen apane aap ghantiyaan bajane lag jaayegi, mahal main jo bhi pani hoga vah doodh main badal jayega tathaa mukhya dwaar se janm sthaan tak kumkum ke pair najar aayenge vah meri akashwani bhi sunai degi or main avatar ke naam se prasiddh ho jaaungaa
 Shri Ramdev ji was born in the year 1409 to the King of Bhadrapad in the house of King Ajmal ji
 us samay sabhi mandiron main ghantiyaan bajane lageen, tej prakaash se sara nagar jagamagane laga
 All the water in the palace turned into milk, from the main gate of the palace to the cradle, the footsteps of Kumkum became footprints, the number kept in the palace temple rang automatically
 usee samay raja ajmal ji ko bhagwaan dwarkanath ke diye hue vachan yaad aaye or ek baar pun: dwarkanath kii jai boli
 Thus Dwarkanath incarnated the house of King Ajmal ji
 bal lila main mata ko parchaa God started his child Leela after taking birth
 ek din bhagwaan ramdev va viramdev apni mata kii god main khel rahe the, mata manade un donon baalkon kaa rup nihaar raheen thim
 The beautiful scene in the morning was adding more beauty
 udhar daasi gaay kaa doodh nikaal kar laayi tathaa mata manade ke haathon main bartan dete hue inhen baalkon ke krida kriya main ram gai
 The mother goes to the milk to offer milk to the stove
 mata jyon hi doodh ko bartan main daalkar chuulhe par chadhaati he
 On the other hand, Ramdev jokes a kiss on the cheek of Viramdev ji to show his mother a miracle
 jisase ramdev ji gir jate hai or rone lagate hai
 Hearing the cry of Ramdev ji, Mata Maenade leaves the milk on the stove and comes and sits down in the lap of Ramdev ji
 udhar doodh garm hon ke kaaran girane lagata he, mata manade jyanhi doodh girtaa dekhati he vah ramdevji ko godi se neeche utaarna chaahati he utane main hi ramdevji apana haath doodh kii ore karke apni dev shakti se us bartan ko chuulhe se neeche dhar dete hai
 Seeing this miracle, Mata Maenade and Ajmal ji and maid sitting there all hail Dwarkanath
 ek baar balak ramdev ne khilone vaale ghode kii jid karne par raja ajmal use khilone vaale ke pas lekar gayi evam khilone banane ko kaha
 King Ajmal asked to make sandalwood and velvet cloth horse
 yah sab dekhakar khilone vaala laalach main aa gaya or usne bahut sara kapada apni patni ke liye rakh liya or us main se kuch hi kapada kaam main liya
 When the boy Ramdev sat on the horse, the horse took him and went into the sky
 raja khilone vaale par gussa hue tathaa use jail main daalane ke aadesh de diye
 After some time, the boy Ramdev came back with the horse
 khilone vaale ne apni galati sweekaari tathaa bachane ke liye ramdev se guhaar kii
 Baba Ramdev forgave him by showing kindness
 abhi bhi, kapadey vaala ghoda baba ramdev kii khaas chadhaava mana jaataa he
 In Samvat 1425, Ramdev Ji Maharaj established a village, named Runicha, 12 km north of Pokaran
 log aakar runicha main basane lage
 Runicha village became very beautiful and delightful
 bhagwaan ramdev ji atithiyon kii seva main hi apana dharm samajhate the
 He always kept the blind, the lame, the lame, the lepers and the afflicted with heart
 ek samay ramdev ji ne darbar baithaaya or nijeeya dharm kaa jhandaa gaadkar unch neech, chuaa chhot ko jad se ukhadkar fankne kaa sankalp kiya tab usee darbar main ek seth bohitaraaj vahaan baitha darbar main prabhu ke gungan gaata tab bhagwaan ramdev ji apane paas bulaayaa or he seth tum pradesh jaao or maaya lekar aao
 On hearing the words of Prabhu, Bohitaraja started to panic, then Lord Ramdev said, “devotees, whenever there is a crisis on you, then i will help you in every crisis
 tab seth runicha se ravaanaa hue or pradesh pahunche or prabhu kii krupa se bahut dhan kamaaya
 In a year, Seth became the hero's biggest jeweler
 kuch samay baad seth ko apane bacchon kii yaad aayi or vah apane gaanv runicha aane kii taiyaari karne laga
 Sethji thought if i would go to Ranicha, Ramdevji would ask what brought me from the state, then Seth ji bought diamond necklace for Prabhu and ordered the servants to fill all the diamond emerald jewels in the boat, i will go to my country and Seth Sara Left with luggage
 seth ji ne sochaa ki yah haar bada keemtee he bhagwaan ramdev ji is haar kaa kya karenge, uske man main laalach aayaa or vichaar karne laga ki runicha ek chota gaanv he vahaan rahakar kya karuunga, kisi bade shahar main rahungaa or ek bada sa mahal banaaunga
 At the same time, there was a storm in the sea, the boat driver said that Seth ji storm is very terrible, the curtain of the boat has also burst
 ab naav chal nahin sakati naav to duubegi hi
 For what purpose will this Maya die for you? seth bohitaraaj bhi dhiraj kho baitha
 Many Goddesses started remembering the Gods but all was useless, none of the gods helped her, then Sethji came to notice of Shri Ramdev ji's word and started calling Seth Prabhu with a compassionate voice
 he bhagwaan mujhase koi galati huyi ho jo mujhe maaf kar dijiye
 In this way Sethji was calling Lord Shri Ramdev Ji in the river
 udhar bhagwaan shri ramdev ji runicha main apane bhai viramdev ji ke saath baithe the or unhone bohitaraaj kii pukaar suni
 Lord Ramdev ji took his arm and Bohitraj Seth took the boat that was sinking
 yah kaam itani shighrata se hua ki paas main baithe bhai viramdev ko bhi pataa tak nahin padane diya
 Ramdev ji's hands were drenched with sea water
 bohitaraaj seth ne sochaa ki naav achaanak kinare kaise lag gai
 Seth's happiness was not limited by escaping such a terrible storm
 mallaah bhi soch main pad gaya ki naav itani jaldi tufaan se kaise nikal gai, ye sab kisi devtaa kii krupa se hua he
 Seth Bohitraj said that no child can be deprived of the one who is guarded by Lord Shri Ramdev ji
 tab mallahon ne bhi shri ramdev ji ko apana isht dev mana
 On reaching the village, Seth told the whole thing to the villagers
 seth darbar main jaakar shri ramdev ji se mila or kehane laga ki main maaya dekhakar aapako bhul gaya tha mere man main laalach aa gaya tha
 Forgive me and order where i spend this illusion
 tab shri ramdev ji ne kaha ki tum runicha main ek baavdi khudva do or us baavdi kaa pani meetha hoga tathaa log ise parchaa baavdi ke naam se pukaarenge va iskaa jal ganga ke samaan pavitra hoga
 In this way, even today this pancha bawdi is built in Ramdevra
 chamatkaar hone se log gaanv-gaanv se runicha aane lage
 The clerics and the pirs also came to know about this
 bhagwaan shri ramdev ji ghar ghar jate or logon ko upadesh dete ki unch-neech, jaat-paat kuch nahin he, har jati ko baraabar adhikaar milanaa chaiye
 The Pirs thought to test Shri Ramdev ji that the elder Pir who lived in Mecca informed them that a great Pir has been born among the Hindus who lives a dead creature, eyes the blind, guests
 Doing service is considered their religion, they should be tested
 yah khabar jab makka pahaunchi to paanch pir makka se ravaanaa hue
 In a few days he reached Pir Runicha
 paanchon piron ne bhagwaan ramdev ji se poocha ki he bhai runicha yahaan se kitni dur he, tab bhagwaan ramdevji ne kaha ki yah jo gaanv saamne dikhaai de rahaa he vahi runicha he, kya main aapke runicha aane kaa kaaran puch saktaa hoon ? tab un paanchon main se ek pir bole hamen yahaan ramdev ji se milanaa he
 Then the Lord said, o Pirji, i am Ramdev, i am standing in front of you, tell me what service is worthy of me
 shri ramdev ji ke vachan sunakar paanchon pir prabhu ke saath ho liye
 Ramdevji did great service to the five peers
 prabhu paanchon piron ko lekar mahal padhaare, vahaan par gaddi, takiya or jajam bichaai gai or piraji gaddi takiyon par viraaje magar shri ramdev ji jajam par baith gaye or bole he piraji aap hamaare mehmaan hai, hamaare ghar padhaare hai aap hamaare yahaan bhojan karke hi padharna
 Hearing this, the peers said, "O Ramdev, the food-eating bowls we have forgotten in Mecca
" ham usee katore main hi bhojan karte hai doosraa bartan varjit he
 If you want to eat food, then we can get the same bowl which we have forgotten in Mecca and then we can have food, otherwise we will not eat
 tab ramdev ji ne kaha ki he pir ji agar aisa he to main aapke katore manga detaa hoon
 Saying this, Lord Ramdev ji lengthened his hand and in an instant put five bowls in front of the pirs and said, Pir ji, now recognize this bowl and have food
 jab piron ne paanchon katore makka vaale dekhe to paanchon piron ko shri ramdev ji mahanata par vishwaas hua or unke vichaaron or aacharan se bahut prabhavit hue or kehane lage ham pir hai magar aap mahaan pir hai
 From today you will know the world as Ramapir
 is tarah se piron ne bhojan kiya or shri ramdevji ko pir kii padavi mili or ramsapir, ramapir kehalaae
 In 1425, Baba Ramdev got engaged in service to his parents and here, one day Ramdev ji's mother Maanade started telling her husband Raja Ajmal ji that his prince has grown up, so get engaged to him so that we too can see daughter-in-law
 Can
 jab baba ramdev ji ne janm liya tha us samay rukmani ko vachan dekar aaye the ki main tere saath vivaah rachaaunga
 In the year 1426, Shri Ramdev was married to Naitlade, daughter of Thakur Dalji Sodha of Amar Kot
 manyata he ki bhadrapada shukla dashami ko baba ramdev ne jivit samadhi lee thi
 On Samvat 1442, Ramdev, with his hand, paid obeisance to all the elders, and after offering a letter to everyone, he worshiped Ramdev to the last with heart, heart and reverence
 ramdev ji ne samadhi main khadey hokar sab ke prati apane antim upadesh dete hue kaha ki prati maah kii shukla paksh kii dooj ko puja paath, bhajan kirthan karke parvotsav manaanaa, raatri jaagran karnaa
 Every year on the occasion of my birth anniversary and in memory of the inner Samadhi, a fair will be held at my Samadhi level
 mere samadhi pujan main bhranti va bhed bhav mat rakhana
 i will always be with my devotees
 is prakaar shri ramdev ji maharaj ne samadhi lee
