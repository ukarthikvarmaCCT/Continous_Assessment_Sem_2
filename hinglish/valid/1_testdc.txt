 ghurnakshadarshi yaa ghurndarshi ek yukti he jo kisi vastu kii koniya sthiti ko maapne ke kaam aata he
 Its mechanism is based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum
 ghurndarshi kaa prayog jahaan chumbakeey sooyee kaam nahin karti vahaan bhi nevigation main hoti he 
 They are also more microscopic than magnetic dipping due to which they are used in intercontinental ballistic missiles and radio-controlled helicopters etc

 a mechanical rotator is a balanced wheel or wheel, which is installed in the base rings in such a way that it has three independent numbers
 is pahie ko ghurnak yaa roter bhi kehete hai
 This cycle is free to revolve around an axis or axis
 is aksh ko bhrami aksh kehete hai
 This axis or axis lies in one base ring at its horizontal diameter and this ring itself can also revolve around a horizontal axis in another outer ring
 yah aksh bhrami aksh ke samakonik hota he
 The outer ring also can rotate around a vertical axis
 is prakaar is chakra yaa ghurnak kii dhuree kisi bhi icchit disha main ingit karti hui rakhi ja sakati he
 This wheel exhibits two basic rotational qualities while lying: positional precession
 ghurndarshi ko bhalee bhanti samajhane ke liye in gunon ke lakshanon ko bhi samaj lenaa nitant aavashyak he
 According to Newton's First Movement, any body wants to remain in the state it lives in and exhibits a tendency to resist any change in that state
 is pravriti ko jadtv kehete hai
 Rotating on its axis, the rotor wants to revolve in its initial plane and oppose it by setting up a pulp
 ghurndarshi ke roter kii duusari visheshta he purassaran
 In order to change the angular momentum of a body while revolving, a fault is necessary
 yadi baladhurna or koniya samveg ke aksh paraspar sampati hote hai, to us pind main ek koniya twaran utpann ho jaataa he, kintu us pind ke paribhraman kaa tal aparivartit rahata he
 Conversely, if the above two axes are mutually equilateral, there is no difference in the angular velocity of the body, but the plane of the rotation itself rotates
 is prakaar kii gati ko purassaran kehete hai
 The movements of the rotator are visible in all the rotating or rotating bodies, but in more angular momentum objects, these actions are more pronounced
 koniya samveg ke kaaran hi ghurnakshasthapi main dridhtaa tathaa jadtv ke gunon kaa samavesh hota he
 When a force is acting on a body, an angular momentum is generated around the axis of the force in that body, due to which the tendency of the body to rotate around that axis
 jitne samay tak vah balyugma kaary karata rahegaa utane samay tak us pind kaa koniya veg badhata hi jayega
 The following equation expresses the property of rotoscope- jahaan sadish τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} tathaa l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} kramshah ghurnakshadarshi par aropit balaghurna tathaa koniya samveg hai
 Scalar i is its inertial, vector ω → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ omega}}} its angular velocity, and vector α → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ alpha}}} angular acceleration
 is sameekaran se spasht he ki yadi balaghurna τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} ko ghurnan-aksh ke lambavat lagaaya jaay to iske kaaran τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau }}} tathaa l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} donon ke lambavat visthaapan utpann hoga
 This motion is called Purasaran
 purassaran kaa koniya veg ωsaanchaa:ind kaa vyanjak nimnlikhit hoga- Suppose, a heavy circle is rotating on a horizontal axis a-b
 dhuree ke donon siron par do bal f or f is prakaar kaary kar rahe hai ki unase ek balyugma kaa nirmaan hota he
 The force generated by it is g = Fl, where l is the length of the axis k-b
 iske parinamswaroop yah sampurna pranali ek anya lambik aksh ke chaaron ore purassruth hone lagegi
 If the velocity of rotation of the cycle is w and the rate of precession w ¢, then g = I
 w
 w ¢, where i is the inertial, around the nartan axis of that circle
 at: yadi chakra kaa koniya samveg i w kaaphi adhik hoga to w ¢ kaa maan bahut kam hoga
 It is clear that if a very inertial cycle is revolving very fast around an axis, then the effect of any external short-term force, G, on it will be extremely weak, ie it will be practically unaffected by disruptive external forces
 koniya samveg adhik ho is hetu kaaphi adhik vyasavaala gatipalak chakra ghurnakshasthapi main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 In addition, the angular momentum of the rotor can also be increased to a much greater extent by increasing the velocity w
 isse ghurnakshasthapi par kisi alpaayu bahya balyugma kaa prabhaav nahin pad saktaa
 Due to the above mentioned properties, rotaxis can be used to demonstrate the rotation of the earth
 prithvi apni dhuree par pashchim se purv kii disha main paribhraman karti he
 One of its cruises is completed in 24 hours
 yadi kisi ghurnakshasthapi ko prithvi tal ke kisi sthaan par is prakaar rakhaa jaay ki uskaa bhoomi aksh purv pashchim disha main kshaitij rahe, to prithvi ke paribhraman ke saath saath uskaa sampurna dhaancha bhi prithvi ke centre kii parikrama karegaa, kyonki prayek samay us dhaanche kaa tal prithvi-tal ke lambavat rahegaa
 But due to its inertia and excessive angular momentum, the land axis will remain parallel to its initial direction
 isaliye prithvi ke paribhraman ke kaaran bhramiaksh, jo prarambh main prithvital ke samaantar tha, prati kshan kuch kone banaata hua dikhalaai padegaa
 Thus the axiom of the axillary will appear to be protruding around its right angular horizontal axis

 Although small or short-term forces or thrusts do not have any visible effect on the rotary, it does not produce the exact results as it should, in principle, due to friction between the brachimaries and the balberings
 iske liye aavashyak sanshodhan kar dene se etjjanit trutiyon kaa parihaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Some of the important practical uses of rotating eyeballs are: vayuyanon ke dishaniyantran ke liye ghurndarshi anivaary upkaran ban gaya he
 The compass rotates on the plane of the rotating aircraft in front of the driver
 apni praarambhik sthiti main isaki bhramidhuri prithvi tal ke thik samaantar rahati he
 There is a hole just in front of its cycle, through which a strong gust of incoming air keeps rotating the cycle very fast
 udate samay vayuyan ko jab ghumaya jaataa he tab ghurndarshi kii bhramidhuri apni praarambhik disha main rahati he
 That is why the rotation of the aircraft is known exactly
 saamanyata vayuyanon main chumbakeey diksuchak dwaara disha kaa gyaan kiya jaataa he, kintu vayuyan ghumaate samay, athwa vaayu ke jhonkon ke karan, uski sooyee aniyamit rup se idhar udhar ghoomane lagati he or tatkaal thik thik disha gyaat nahin ho paati
 The roundabout remains largely unaffected
 isaliye yah ek prakaar se chumbakeey diksuchak ke poorak kii bhanti kaary karata he or chaalak ko uske gantavy kii thik thik disha gyaat karaane main sahaayak hota he
 a second rotator tells the driver exactly how high or low he is going
 dharti se bahut oonchaai par udanevaale vayuyan ke chaalak ko yah pataa lagaana kathin hota he ki uskaa yaan upar yaa neeche kii ore kis disha main ja rahaa he
 That is why he has to take help of this rotator
 iske bhramiaksh kii praarambhik disha urdhwadhar hoti he
 When the aircraft ascends or descends, then by tilting this axis from the vertical of the plane plane, the direction of the aircraft is accurately understood

 jeevigyaan main samamiti kisi jeev main samaan rup ke angon kii santulit upasthiti ko kehete hai, masalan manushyon main santulit vyavastha se ek bayen or usee ke jaisaa ek daayan haath hota he
 Many types of symmetry are seen in biology and historically it has been very important in biological classification
 vyasiya samamiti aise jeevon main pai jaati he jinhen agar unke kendra se nikalne vaale kisi kaalpanik samtal dwaara kaata jaye to ve kai sthanon par unke kate hue bhaagon main qareeb-qareeb samamiti dekhi ja sakati he
 For example, taramine has a test symmetry
 aise jeevon kii koi dai-bai taraf nahin hoti
 Two-dimensional symmetry is found in those organisms that, if they cut a plane from top to bottom, become two almost equal parts
 yah samamiti maanvon, kutton, ityadi main dekhi jaati he
 From the perspective of evolution, two-dimensional symmetry has been very successful for the creatures to flourish and in the present tense, two-dimensional symmetry is seen in 99% of the earth's creatures
 kuch tenophora jaise jeevon main dvivyasiya samamiti dekhi jaati he jo vyasiya or dwibhageeya samamiti kaa mail he
 In this, the organism can be divided into four parts around its center, in which the two parts of the opposite end are the same but they are different from the other two parts, which are themselves one-to-one
 kuch jeevvaigyanikon kaa mat he ki jivan ke kram-vikaas main yah vyasiya or dwibhageeya samamiti ke bich kaa padaav he, yani armbh main jeevon main vyasiya samamiti hi thi, jis se phir dvivyasiya samamiti viksit hui jo aage chalakar dwibhageeya samamiti main viksit hui
 Not all organisms have symmetry
 kuch aise bhi jeev hai jinamein asamamiti milti he
 Some degree of symmetry-like organisms also have asymmetry because there is a slight difference in their similar parts, for example, there is a slight difference between the two hands of a human being and the heart of humans is also only in the body
 Is in the left side
 lekin kuch spanj or anya jeev aise hote hai jinaki sharir-rachana main koi bhi samamiti nahin hoti
 Note that diffuse symmetry is seen in some other sponges

 This building underwent a major change in Mughal architecture, whose main part was Charbagh style gardens
 aise udyaan bharat main isse purv kabhi nahin dikhe the or iske baad anek imaaraton kaa abhinn ang banate gayi
 This tomb was completely different from the tomb Bagh e Babur in Kabul of Humayun's father Babur, built by the Mughals earlier
 babar ke saath hi samraaton ko baag main bane makbaron main dafn karne kii parampara aarambh hui thi
 This building, based on the mausoleum built in Samarkand of his ancestor Timur Lang, became the inspiration for the tombs of Mughal architecture going forward in India
 ye sthapaty apane charam par tajmahal ke saath pahunchaa
 The site was chosen for the mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna river because of its proximity to Hazrat Nizamuddin
 sant nizamuddin dilli ke prasiddh sufi sant hue hai va inhen dilli ke shaskaon dwaara kaafii mana gaya he
 His then residence was also located in the chilla-nizamuddin Auliya, in the north-east direction from the place of the tomb

 The arches are also built just above the lattice enclosure of the confluence in the main chamber, which faces west towards Mecca
 yahaan aamtaur par praveshdwaron par khude kuran ke sura 24 ke bajaay sura- an-nur kii ek rekha bani he, jiske dwaara prakaash qibala se andar pravesh karata he
 In this way, the level of the emperor gets closer to the divinity higher than his opponents and rivals
 pradhan kaksh ke chaar konon par chaar ashtakoniya kamare hai, jo mehrabadar ddeergha se jude hai
 Four other chambers are also built between the arms of the head chamber
 ye aath kamare mukhya kabr kii parikrama banaate hai, jaisi soofivaad or kai anya mughal makbaron main dikhti he; saath hi islam dharm main jananath kaa sanket bhi karte hai
 Each of these rooms is made up of 8-8 more rooms, which are part of the overall 124-room plan

 Several other monuments have been built on the way to the main western entrance to Humayun's tomb
 inamen se pramukh smarak isa khan niyazi kaa makbara he, jo mukhya makbare se bhi 20 varsh purv 1547 main bana tha
 Isa Khan Niyazi was an Afghan Nawab of the court of Sher Shah Suri, ruler of the Sur dynasty, fighting against the Mughals
 yah makbara isa khan ke jeevankaal main hi bana tha or uske baad uske puure parivaar ke liye hi kaam aayaa
 To the west of the mausoleum is a three courtyard wide red sandstone mosque
 yah athmukha makbara sur vansh ke lodhi makbare parisar sthit anya makbaron se bahut mail khaataa he
 Other monuments located outside the main boundary in this complex are prominent: the tomb of Bu Halima and its gardens
 ye makbara ab dhwans ho chukaa he or avasheshon se gyaat hota he ki ye kendra main sthit nahin tha
 This suggests that it may have been added later
 iske baad aati he arab sarai jise hamida begum ne mukhya makbare ke nirmaan main lage kaarigaron ke liye banwaaya tha
 The officer's tomb is also built in this complex, which was built for a Nawab of Akbar
 iske saath hi isaki masjid bhi bani he
 Outside the entire complex is a mausoleum called Neela Burj
 iskaa ye naam iske gumbad ke upar lagi neeli glemud tilon ke kaaran padaa he
 The tomb was built by Abdul Rahim Khankhana, son of Bairam Khan, the courtier of Akbar, for his servant Mian Faheem
 fahim miyaan inke bete firos khan ke sang hi paley bade the or uske saath hi 1625 / 26 main jahangir ke samay main hue ek mughal senapati mahabat khan ke vidroh main ladate hue kaam aaye the
 This tomb is unique in its architecture
 ye baahar se ashtakoniya he jabaki andar se vargakar he
 Its roof is particularly notable because of its different domed dome from the prevailing double dome of its time, and very beautiful painting and mosaic on the plaster inside

 At the time of Partition of India, in August 1947, the old fort and Humayun's Tomb were converted into refugee camps for refugees from India to newly established Pakistan
 baad main inhen bharat sarkaar dwaara apane niyantran main le liya gaya
 These camps lasted for about five years and caused great damage to the monuments, especially their gardens, beautiful water drains etc
 iske uparaant is dhwans ko rokane ke liye makbare ke andar ke sthaan ko eenton se dhank diya gaya, jise aane vaale varshon main bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan vibhaag ne waapas apane puraane rup main sthapit kiya
 However, by 1985 four unsuccessful attempts were made to activate the original aquatic system

 The maximum retail price in India, running an MRP system that can be charged not only for a product sold in the country, is the highest price that a manufacturer calculates
 retaillers haalanki, kam se kam ke liye utpaadon ko bechney ke liye chun sakate hai emarpy
 The price calculated by the manufacturer in those systems is only a recommendation, and is not enforceable by law because MRP differs from systems using a recommended retail price
 bharat main sabhi khudara utpaadon emarpy ke saath chihnit kiya janaa chahie
 Shops cannot charge customers more than MRP
 kuch dukaanon apni dukaanon ke liye or adhik graahakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye thodaa emarpy neeche charge kar sakate hai
 In some remote areas, tourist destinations, and in situations where a product is difficult to obtain, consumers are often illegally charged more than MRP
 april 2015 main yah yah he ki ve emarpy ke upar charge kar diya gaya tha ormaharashtra rajya sarkaar se hastkshep karne kii dhamkee di kii khoj kii thi ke baad mumbai main doodh vikritaon bahishkaar kii dhamkee de rahe the ki soochna mili thi
 In today's scenario it is generally found that the prices of consumer goods traded in the markets are arbitrarily settled by the manufacturers
 yahaan tak ki aap upabhoktaaon ko khudara vikritaon vastav main ve utpaadon ko bechney par sthaneey karon kii sahi maatra main charge kar rahe hai ki kya jaanch karne ke liye ek shahar ke bheetar, vibhinn utpaadon ke karon ke vibhinn dar he, jahaan ek bazaar main, yah bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki ehsaas kar sakate hai
 Hence the confusion regarding the price of the goods is natural as the actual production cost is very low for the consumer and manufacturers to gain big profit
 nirmaataaon manamaane dhang se mulya tay karne or upabhoktaaon ko ucch laagat par maal kharid karne ke liye majaboor kar rahe hai
 Under the Weights and Measures Rule, all packaged goods must carry some necessary information on the contents of the package, such as their weight or volume, name and address of the manufacturer, date of manufacture, and in the case of food packages, of course, Best before date and maximum retail price
 upabhokta nirmaataa dwaara maal par chhapi adhiktam keemat khatm karne ke liye charge nahin kar sakate hai taaki upabhokta vastuon adhinium, 2006 ke tahat, kuch disha nirdesh pradaan kii gai he
 These guidelines are: 1
 Consumer Goods All goods and items are brought to market for sale and are meant for consumers to use and consume; utpaadan kii laagat 2
 vastuon ke utpaadan main nirmaataa se sidhe yaa paroksh rup se kharch kii laagat kaa matlab he, 3
 Printing in Hindi and English and it is sold means the printing of the cost of production and retail price at a visible place on the product in the local language of the place, and 4
 adhiktam khudara mulya utpaada utpaada par lagaaya sabhi karon ko shaamil karegaa khudara or is tarah kii keemat main bech diya jaae, jis par is tarah kii keemat kaa matlab he
 The law makes it mandatory for manufacturers to print the cost of production and maximum retail price on the packaging of consumer goods, so that the consumer cannot be found by the agent / dealer
 upabhoktaaon ko adhiktam khudara mulya or maal kii vaastavik keemat ke bich antar pataa karne ke liye yah aavashyak he
 The maximum retail price is inclusive of all taxes and a retailer can sell for less than MRP
 emarpy adhiktam khudara ki vastu ke liye anumati di keemat nahin he or vaastavik keemat he or ek footkar bikri main acchhee tarah se uske margin emarpy main nirmit kam kar sakate hai kyonki vastav main upabhoktaaon ko hameshaa emarpy se neeche bechney vaale khudara vikritaon ke liye dikhnaa chahie
 On the other hand, while the actual price may be about 10-15 per cent lower than MRP
 kabhi kabhi mudrit emarpy bikri mulya or emarpy ke bich kaa antar 30-50 fisadi zyada ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he ki itani adhik he
 It is a crime to sell at a price higher than the marked price
 vaastavik keemat emarpy se ke bare main 10-15 fisadi kam ho saktaa he, jabaki
 Some time it has been found that consumers have to take products from the market and even without seeing the packaging of the products and the MRP written on the carton
 sthiti yah he ki dealer main kharidaar ke liye utpaadon kii keemat main bataaya or yah bhi main discount dar par dena hoga ki Sates
 When the buyer comes to the house from behind only after buying the same he / she has mentioned on the packaging and carton the price of the goods is already less than the price at which he / she has purchased after the discount Finds that
 baat or maap niyamon ke maanakon ke tahat, nirmaataaon sabhi purv pack maal par khudara bikri, sabhi karon emarpy samaveshi ke liye bane nirdisht karne ke liye he
 This is a requirement meant to ensure that consumers are not misled by agents / dealers and shoppers about the price of packaged goods
 zyada kiraaya vyapaaree mukadmaa chalaaya ja saktaa he or abhiyojan paksh ke packaged camodities badal diya he, jo keemat bhaaluu maamle main nirmaataa ke khilaaf shuru kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye ek aparaadh he
 In the above case, the dealer takes advantage of the fact that the consumer can see the packaging and cannot quote a high MRP

 Story: There was a king in our country - Nal
 unki patni kaa naam tha damyanti
 Once, on the Pratipada of Chaitra month, the old queen came to Damayanti
 usne apane gale main pilaa gaanth laga doraa band rakhaa tha
 When the queen asked him about the string, she said, "this is the thread of wealth
" iske pahanane se ghar main sukh sampati kii vriddhi hoti hai
 The queen also took a thread from her and tied it around her neck, when King Nal asked about the thread tied around the queen's neck, the queen told all the things told by the old lady
 raja kehane laga,” tumhe kis chij kii kami he jo tumne doraa bandha he
 “even after the queen refused to say so, the king broke the cord and threw it away
 raatri main raja ko swapn main ek stri boli- ” main ja rahi hoon tathaa duusari stri boli main aa rahi hoon
 "thus, this dream would come every day for this twelve days
 vah udhaas rahane laga
 When the queen asked, the king told the queen the dream
 rani ne raja se dono striyo kaa naam poochne ko kaha
 When the king asked her, the first woman said, "I am Lakshmi", and the second one called her name poor
 duusare din raja ne dekha kii uskaa sab dhan samaapt ho gaya he
 They became so poor that they could not even eat
 duhkhi man ne raja rani jangal main kand mul khaakar apane din bitaane lagen
 His five-year-old son got hungry on the way
 to rani ne raja se malin ke yahan se chacha mangekar laane ko kaha
 When the king asked for buttermilk from Malin, Malin said that buttermilk is finished
 aage chalane par raja par ek vishdhar ne kuker ko das liya
 On going further, the king brought two pheasants
 rani ne teetar bhune to teetar ud gayi
 When the king was bathing and drying the dhoti, the wind blew the dhoti
 tab rani ne apni dhoti fadkar raja ko di
 When he went ahead with hungry thirst, then on the way home of the king's friend
 mitra ne dono ko kamare main tehraaya
 If they put iron tools there, they got into the earth
 chori kaa dosha lagane ke bhay se vahaan se bhaage
 Later, the king's sister came home
 raja kii bahan ne unhe ek puraane mahal main tehraaya sone ke thaal main unhe khaanaa bheja to thaal mitti main badal gaya
 The king was ashamed
 thaal ko vahi jameen main gankar bhaag nikalen
 Walking ahead came a moneylender's house
 sahukaar ne raja ke thaharne kii vyavastha puraani haveli main kar di
 There, a hero's necklace was hung on the Khanty
 paas hi diwaar par ek mor kaa chitra bana tha
 He started swallowing the peacock necklace
 yah dekhakar ve vahaan se bhi chori ke dar se bhaage
 Now on the advice of the queen, the king started thinking of making a hut in the forest
 ve jangal main ek sookhe bageeche main jaakar tehre
 The garden became green
 baag kaa swami yah dekhakar bada prasann hua
 Swami asked him, who are you both? Raja said that we are travelers
 majaduree kii khoj main aaye hai
 Swami kept him a servant with him
 ek din baag kii swamini baithi baithi katha sun rahi thi or doraa le rahi thi
 On being asked by the queen, she told that there is a Dora of wealth, the queen also took Dora after hearing the story
 raja ne rani se poocha ye kaisaa doraa bandha hai? rani boli yah vahi doraa jise aane ek baar todkar phenk diya tha
 And we had to face so many misfortunes
 smapda devi ham par naaraaz hai
 The queen said, "if Sampada Mata is true then our days will return again
 “ That night the king had a dream
 ek stri kah rahi hai main ja rahi hoon, duusari stri main aa rahi hoon
 On the king's asking, the first woman called her name impoverished and the second called her name Lakshmi
 raja ne lakshmi se poocha ab to nahin jaaogi
 Lakshmi said, "if your wife keeps telling the story with the wealth of wealth, then i will not go
" yadi tum doraa tod doge to chali jaaongi
 The mistress of the garden used to give a necklace to a queen, making that necklace Damayanti
 rani vah haar bahut pasand aayaa
 On the queen's inquiry, he made a mistress that he has made a couple work here
 rani ne baag kii malkin se dono ke naam poochne ko kaha
 When he came home and asked for the name of both, he came to know that they are Nal Damayanti, the owner of the garden started apologizing to him, then King Nal told him that our days were going bad, there is no fault of yours
 ab dono apane rajmahal kii taraf chale
 On the way came the moneylender's house
 vah sahukaar ke yahan tehre vahaan dekha ki diwaar par bana mor naulakha haar ugal rahaa hai
 The moneylender caught the king's feet
 aage chalane par bahan ke ghar pahucha
 The king stayed in the sister's old palace
 raja ne vah jagah khodi to heere se jadt thaal niklaa
 The king gave a lot of money to his sister
 aage chal mitra ke ghar pahunchakar usee kamare main tehra
 Friend's iron tools were found there
 aage chalane par uski dhoti ek vriksh par mil gayi
 After proceeding after washing the bath, the prince who had taken the snake got found playing
 mehalo main pahuchane par rani kii sakhiyo ne mangal gaan gaakar unka swaagat kiya
 All this was the result of tying the thread of Sampada ji which changed their bad days into good days

 Theva is a unique handicraft that flourished under the patronage of the royal houses of Rajasthan during the Mughal period in the 17th century
 theva kii hastkala kala striyon ke liye sone minaakaari or paardarshee kaanch ke mail se nirmit aabhushan ke nirmaan se sambaddh he
 Many of its craftsmen-families live only in Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan
 theva-aabhushanon ke nirmaan main vibhinn rangon ke shishon ko chaandi ke maheen taron se bane frem main daal kar us par sone kii baarik kalakritiyaan ukeri jaati he, jinhen kushal or daksh haath chote-chote aujaaron kii madad se banaate hai
 This jewelery-making art is one of the few in the world because of its originality and artistry - which can quickly become extinct in the absence of international market and marketing
 "theva" naam kii utpatti is kala ke nirmaan kii do mukhya prakriyaaon 'tharana' or 'waada' se mil kar hui he
 In this art, on the first glass, a very thin work or sheet of gold is made, and a fine mesh is made on it, which is called tharana
 duusare charan main kaanch ko kasne ke liye chaandi ke baarik taar se frem banaaya jaataa he, jise "wada" kaha jaataa he
 It is then heated in a fiery fire
 falswaroop shishe par sone kii kalakriti or khubasurat dizin ubhar kar ek nayab or laajawab kriti kaa aabhushan ban jaati he
 This craft, called the Charisma of Kanchan on glass, is like a golden painting on glass, which takes birth on the foundation of painting
 is shilp kii rachana jatil, kathin tathaa shramsadhy to he hi, parantu sone par chitrankit shilp ko kaanch main samahit kar dene kaa kamaal in mutthi bhar kaarigaron ke hi bas kii baat he
 The craft depiction is engraved on a 23 carat gold leaf with a special pen called 'tankal' and expertly mounted on multicolored glass
 jab donon padaarth sona or kaanch paraspar jud kar ekmec ek jeev ho jate hai to sone main kaanch or kaanch main sona dikhalaai padataa he
 This is called Theva Kala
 kaanch kii jhagamag ko or adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa umdaa banaaye rakhane ke liye ise ek khaas prakriya se guzarana padataa he jisase ki kaanch main samahit sone kaa kaary ubhaar dene lage or dekhne vaale ke man ko chhu le
 In this way, each specimen of the craft is made of transparent glass and has an appearance like rubies, emeralds and sapphires
 is kala ko ukerne main belgium se vishesh prakaar ke kaanch istemaal hote the, par aise kaanchon kii anuplabdhta se ab alag umdaa kaanch kaa istemaal hota hai
 Initially, Theva's work was done only on the precious stones of red, blue and green, diamond, emerald, etc
 But now this work is also being done on yellow, pink and black glass gems
 pehle is kala se banaae jane vaale baks, plates, dish aadi par dharmik anukritiyaan or lokapriy lokkathaayen ukeri jaati thim, lekin ab yah kala aabhushan ke saath-saath pendents, year-ring, taai or sadiyon kii pin, kafalinks, photophreme aadi main bhi prachlit ho chali he
 Efforts are being made to popularize this art by diversifying the modern fashion into various designs
 is kala ko jaanane vaale desh main ab gine chune parivaar hi bache hai
 These families belong to the Rajsoni family living in the newly formed Pratapgarh district of Rajasthan, which has received several international, national and state level awards for this unique art

 'economic Surplus' is a very convenient and practical subject in the field of economics
 vishesh rup se, yah kalyankari arthshaastra kii shakha ke antargat aata he
 In addition to its application in achieving an efficient allocation of resources, it is integral to David Ricardo's 'economic rent theory' and Karl Marx's 'surplus value theory'
 kisi gatividhi yaa lenden se samaaj main paye gaye kul mulya ko hi 'aarthik adhishesh' kehete hai
 Not only do the people involved in this transaction get benefits, but sometimes many people get the benefit of economic surplus from the same activity
 dusre shabdon main, aarthik adhishesh 'upabhokta adhishesh' or 'utpaadak adhishesh' kaa kul jod he
 Hence, economic surplus arises only when a consumer gets something for less than he wants or a producer gets more than he wants in return for his goods
 kisi chiz ko khaaridate samay, ek upabhokta ek nirdhaarit raashi dene ke liye taiyaar rehta he, or adhikansh samay vah ek anya hi raashi detaa he
 The difference between these two is called 'consumer surplus'
 is paribhaasha ko spasht karne ke liye, ek udhaaharan prastut he
 Suppose that Anil wants to buy a book from the market, and he is ready to pay 200 rupees for this book
 bazaar pahunchne par use pataa chalata he ki us pustak kii vaastavik keemat keval 150 rupye he, or isliye vah us pustak ko khushi-khushi kharidta he
 In this example, the consumer was willing to pay Rs 200, but had to pay only Rs 150
 at: is udhaaharan main anil ko 50 rupye kii upabhokta adhishesh praapt hoti he
 a demand curve represents the willingness of all consumers in the market to spend
 kul upabhokta adhishesh maang vakr ke neeche or mulya se upar kaa kshetra he
 The effect of price on consumer surplus is very direct
 yahan do paridrishyon sambhav hai: keemat main vruddhi or keemat main ghataav
 Consumer surplus decreases when price increases, and consumer surplus increases when price decreases
 is prakaar keemat or upabhokta adhishesh ke bich ek ulataa rishta hota he
 The difference between the research given to the producer and the producer's own expenditure is called the 'producer surplus'
 nirmaataa adhishesh tabhi utapann hoti he jab utpaadak kii ummid kii keemat bazaar kii keemat se kam hota he
 To illustrate this definition, an example is presented
 maan lijie ki anil ne 150 rupee kharch karke ek pustak chapa he
 Now he wants to market that book
 bazaar pahunchne par use pataa chalata he ki us pustak kii vaastavik keemat 200 rupye he, or isliye vah us pustak ko khushi-khushi bechata he
 In this example the manufacturer's own expense is 150 rupees, but the market price is 200 rupees
 at: is udhaaharan main anil ko 50 rupye kii utpaadak adhishesh praapt hoti he
 a supply curve represents the marginal cost of each producer in making any commodity available in the market
 kul utpaadak adhishesh mulya se neeche or aapurti vakr ke upar kaa kshetra he
 Like consumer surplus, the effect of price on producer surplus is very direct
 yahan bhi do paridrishyon sambhav hai: keemat main vruddhi or keemat main ghataav
 When the price increases, the producer surplus also increases, and when the price decreases, the producer surplus also decreases
 is prakaar keemat or utpaadak adhishesh ke bich ek sidhaa rishta hota he
 Consumer Surplus = Price for Buyers - The amount paid by buyers
 nirmaataa adhishesh = utpaadakon dwaara praapt raashi - utpaadakon ke liye laagat
 Economic Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus = +
 ab, kharidaaron dwaara bhugtan raashi or vikritaon dwaara praapt raashi, donon baraabar hai
 Therefore, economic surplus = price for buyers - cost for sellers
 maang or aapurti vakr ke graph main, maang or aapurti vakron ke bich ke kshetra aarthik adhishesh kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
