 Pleased with his penance, Shankar ji asked him to ask for the bride
 is par jaydrath bolaa, “bhagwan! main yuddh main paanchon pandavon par vijay praapt karne kaa var maangata hoon

 a frequency bar is a device that allows a body to be viewed in motion while moving
 isaki kriya drushtisthaapakatv par nirbhar he
 The reflection of an object on the trunk of our eye remains from about 1 / 16 second to 1 / 10 second after the object is removed
 saadhaaran aavritidarshi main ek vrittakar patr yaa chakra hota he, jisaki baari ke sameep baraabar duriyon par ek athwa do teen vrittakar panktiyon main chhidr ban rahete hai
 Circular letter is rotated at a speed and eye near the holes Circular letter is rotated at a speed and the moving object is inspected by placing an eye near the holes
 jab chhidr vastu ke saamne aata he tabhi vastu dikhaai padati he
 If a frequency spectator is rotated at such a speed that at every frequency of the machine, the same part of the machine keeps coming in front of an opening of the rotating sheet, then due to the visibility, the moving machine will appear to us as static, but blurred in normal light
 spasht nirikshan ke liye mashin ko atyant teevr prakaash main rahanaa chahie
 If the machine should remain in light instead of uniform intense light
 yadi ekasmaan teevr prakaash ke badale mashin ko prakaash kii teevr damakon dwaara prakashit kiya jaae or yadi damakon kii aavritisankhya itani ho ki ek damak mashin par iske thik ek paribhraman par pade to mashin sthir dikhaai padegi
 By this event, any part of a machine can be photographed, inspected and the angular velocity of the machine can be determined
 kisi doltiya vastu, jaise compit swaritra kii bhi aavritisankhya nikaali ja sakati he
 The frequency bar is rotated by the electric motor mo

 The telescope rests on two holes in the frequency band
 is doordarshee or aavritidarshi ke bich vidyutswaritra swa kshaitij sthiti main rakhaa jaataa he jisamen swaritra kii donon bhujaaon main aluminyim kii ek ek pattee laga di jaati he
 One of these leaves has a hole in it that it is completely covered by the leaf of the other arm in the position of the larynx and when the arms are stretched while oscillating, the hole opens
 is bhaanti pattiyon ke bich kaa chhidr ek senkad main utani baar khulata or band hota he jitani swaritra aavritisankhya hoti he
 After this, the oscillator is oscillated by electrically driving the oscillator
 vidyut ke prabhaav se swaritra kaa dolan sthaayee bana rahata he
 The telescope holes in the telescope first become blurred, then spread out as the motor speed increases to a full circle
 gati adhik badhane par chhidr alag spasht dikhaai padate hai
 This is possible only when one hole of the frequency bar rotates in place of the adjacent second hole during oscillation of the oscillator
 yadi chakra kii gati tanik kam kar di jaati he to chhidr peeche kii ore dhire dhire ghoomte hue jaan padate hai or yadi gati tanik badhaai jaati he to chhidr aage kii dhire dhire badhate prathit hote hai
 When the holes appear to be clearly stable, the frequency number of the tuner can be determined by looking at the frequency of the spectroscope
 yadi chakra ke vrutt par sa chhidr hai or chakra ek second main m paribhraman karata he to swaritra kii aavritisankhya sa ́m hoti he
 Even if the speed of the frequency bar is exactly double or triple, quadruple, etc
, the holes appear stable in this way
 is kaaran prayog main aavritidarshi kii gati prarambh main kam rakhkar dhire dhire badhaai jaati he
 Nowadays lights in homes and on the streets are done by tubelight
 inamen prakaash ucch aavritisankhya ke prayavarti vidyudvisarjan se utpann hota he
 In such light, if the fan of the table is run or when it is closed by cutting the power, the fan blades are seen to stop, sometimes moving in the opposite direction, then stop and go straight in an increasing or decreasing move
 arthath blade ulataa sidhaa chalate or bich bich main rukate jaan padate hai
 This spectroscopic effect depends on the frequency of light of the tubelight
 yadi pankhe par ekadish dhara ke balb kaa prakaash padataa ho to hamen aisa anubhav nahin hota
 In the same way, when the carriage box is shown moving in the movie, the lighted wheel first stops and stops in the opposite direction, and then it seems to stop
 yah drishy bhi chalchitr ke parde par khandit prakaash se utpann hota he
 The reason for the spectroscopic effect becomes clear from the following experiment
 bade shwet vrittakar patr c par kaale vrutt or bindu banaae gaye hai
 On this, the light of the arc falls by the rhythm
 taal or vrittakar patr ke bich ek doosraa vrittakar patr k he, jisamen ek lanbaa chhed bana hua he
 Circular letters are rotated differently at different speeds
 Suppose a circular letter a rotates 13 times in a second, then a part of the letter f is published 13 times in a second through its hole
 yadi c ek second main keval ek hi chakkar usee disha main lagaae or chitra ke anusaar yadi pehali damak vrutt 1 par pade to is vrutt ke donon bindu ek duusare ke thik upar neeche dikhaai padenge
 As soon as the second glow reaches, circle 2 will come in place of circle 1 and the points will turn in clockwise direction
 tisare sphuran ke aate hi vrutt 3 aakar vrutt 1 ke sthaan par padegaa ore bindu adhik mude dikhaai padenge
 The circles are all the same and all come to position 1, where the light flashes
 at: vrutt sthir or unke bheetar ke bindu dakshinavart ghoomte dikhaai padenge
 Three elliptical circles have been made near the center of the letter f, in which white black cords are made in alternate order
 madhyavarti vrutt main 13 safed or 13 kaale khaane hai
 The inner circle has 12 white and 12 black cells and the outer circle has 14 such types of food
 c or k in donon patron kii aapekshik gatiyon ke aise santulan par ki paridhi ke vrutt sthir jaan paden, in teenon kendriya khaanedaar vritton main bichwala vrutt sthir, bahari dakshinavart or bhitari vamavart ghumta dikhaai padegaa
 One thing should be specially kept in mind
 yadi prakaash kii damak ek second main 13 se kam kar di jaay, to prakashit chakti c kii sataha par jhilamilaahat yaa kanpakanpi dikhaai padati he
 If the number of light flashes per second is increased enough to increase the velocity of the cycle, the tremor goes away and the surface brightness appears permanent
 aisa deeptishrabhas hamaari ankhon kii drushtivilambanaa ke kaaran hota hai, jaisaa cinema ke parde par chitron ko prati second 13 se adhik baar daalkar paatro ke naach, daud aadi, sabhi gatividhiyon ko swaabhaavik reeti main dekh pate hai
 If the number of movies is less than 13 per second, the screen starts shivering
 aajkal bolte chitron main 24 chitra prati second parde par daale jate hai, jisase kanpakanpi bilkul nahin aati
 In order to completely quiver, the light is cut once in the middle of each image, that is, 48 flashes occur at equal time intervals while playing 24 images per second

 yah varsh kii pratham grand slam tennis pratiyogita he jo australia main yojit kii jaati he
 Being in Australia, it is named Australian Open
 isaki shuruwat prayek varsh janvari maah hoti he
 The tournament began in 1905 at the Verhausman Cricket Ground
 It was named the Australasian Championships because by 1912 it was organized by both Australia and New Zealand
 The competition was only expanded to include women's tennis in 1922
 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard Rebound Ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 Around 1700 AD, there was a new twist in Hindi poetry
 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskrit sahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic texts of rasa, ornamentation etc
, the poetry of this time has been called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 There have been many poets in this period who were also Acharyas and who wrote texts giving the characteristics of various Kavyangas
 is yug main shringaar kii pradhanta rahi
 This era was the era of liberation
 mukhyatya kavitt, savaiye or dohe is yug main likhe gaye
 Poets were kings-based, so the poetry of this era was mostly courtier, as a result of which special amount of miraculous euphemism is available in it, but the poem also became alienated from ordinary people
 reetikaal ke adhikansh kavi darbari the
 Keshavdas, Pratap Singh, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Chintamani, Dev, Bhikharidas, Raghunath, Beni, Gang, Tikaram, Gwal, Chandrashekhar Bajpai, Harnam, Vice Chancellor Mishra, Nevaaz, Surti Mishra, Kavindra Udayanath, Rishinath, Ratan Kavi, Beni Bandijan , Beni Praveen, Brahmadatta, Thakur Bundelkhandi, Bodha, Guman Mishra, etc
 and many poets were kings, such as Maharaj Jaswant Singh, Bhagwant Rai Kheichi, Bhupathi, Rasnidhi, Maharaj Vishwanath, Dwijdev
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika
 kavipriya main alankaar or rasikapriya main ras kaa sodaaharan nirupan he
 Symptoms are in couplets and examples in Kavitasvaiya
 lakshan-lakshya-granthon kii yahi parampara reetikavy main viksit hui
 Ramachandrika is Keshava's anthology in which the vigorous Kalacheta of a vigilante artist emerged in place of devotion to devotion
 keshav ke kai dashak baad chintamani se lekar atharahavin sadi tak hindi main reetikavy kaa ajasr strot pravaahit hua jisamen nar-nari-jivan ke romantic pakshon or tatsambandhi saras samvednaaon kii atyant kalatmak abhivyakti vyapak rup main hui
 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love
 maatra or kavyagun donon hi drushtiyon se is samay kaa nar-nari-prem or saundarya kii maarmik vyanjana karanevaala kavyasahitya mahatvapurn he
 Veerakavya was also written at this time
 mughal shaasha aurangzeb kii kattar sampradayikta or aakraamak raajnneeti kii takaraahat se is kaal main jo vikshobh kii sthitiyaan ai unhone kuch kaviyon ko virakavy ke srijan kii bhi prerana di
 Among such poets, Bhushan is prominent, who, despite adopting the ritual style, described the valor of valor vigorously
 is samay niti, vairaygy or bhakthi se sambandhit kavy bhi likhaa gaya
 a number of notebooks were also produced
 idhar ke shodhakarya main is samay kii shringaretar rachanaayen or prabandhkavy prachur pariman main mil rahe hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider ritual poetry as absolutely one-sided and consistent
 is samay ke kavy main purvavarti kaalon kii sabhi pravritiyaan sakriy hai
 This main stream is that of Shringarakavya, which has been considered as a real demonstrator of the poetic wealth of this time
 shringaari kavy teen virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first category is of the poets whose representatives are Keshava, Chintamani, Bhikharidas, Dev, Matiram and Padmakar etc
 in kaviyon ne dohon main ras, alankaar or nayika ke lakshan dekar kavitt savaie main prem or saundarya kii kalapurna maarmik vyanjana kii he
 The classical discussion represented in Sanskrit literature has more following them
 par kuch ne thodi moulikta bhi dikhaai he, jaise bhikharidas kaa hindi chhandon kaa nirupan
 The second category is of recited poets
 in kaviyon ne lakshan nahin nirupit kiye, keval unke aadhaar par kavyrachana kii
 Bihari is the best among them, presenting his "satsai" in couplets
 vibhinn mudraonvaale atyant vyanjak saundaryachitron or prem kii bhavadashaon kaa anupam ankan inke kavy main miltaa he
 In the third category, Ghanananda, Bodha, Dwijdev Thakur, etc
 are free poets who have given expression of free love
 inaki rachanaaon main prem kii tivrata or gahanta kii atyant prabhaavshaalee vyanjana hui he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke romantic pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals increased and the Hindi poetry became narrower
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 History testifies that this era was a period of splendid development even in its defeat period
 mughal darbar ke haram main paanch-paanch hajaar rupasiyaan rahati thim
 Meena used to be a marketer, there was a free trade of sura-sundari
 dow nagendra likhte hai- "vaasana kaa sagar aise prabal veg se umad rahaa tha ki shuddhivaad samraat ke sabhi nishedh praytn usamen bah gayi
 amir-umrao garrisoned his prohibition papers in the liquor jug
 vilaas ke anya saadhan bhi prachur maatra main the
 "padmakar has outlined the outline of the then courts in one verse - ahalokikta, shringaarikta, nayikabhed or alankaar-priyata is yug kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Almost all poets have adopted Braj language
 swatantra kavita kam likhi gai, ras, alankaar vagairah kavyangon ke lakshan likhte samay udhaaharan ke rup main - visheshkar shringaar ke alambanon evam uddipano ke udhaaharan ke rup main - saras rachanaaen is yug main likhi gayi
 The Bhushan poet also gave compositions of Veer Ras
 bhav-paksh kii apeksha kala-paksh adhik samrudh rahaa
 Special attention was not given to word-power, nor to the drama of drama
 vishyon kaa sankoch ho gaya or moulikta kaa hraas hone laga
 There were many poets at this time - Keshav, Chintamani, Dev, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Ghanananda, Padmakar etc
 inamen se keshav, bihari or bhushan ko is yug kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Bihari fully developed the possibilities of the couplets
 aapako reeti-kaal kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Poets of this period can be divided into three categories - reetibaddh kavi Free poet ritisiddh kavi Scholars are also of the opinion that poets of this period have fully adhered to dignity in poetry
 ghor shringaari kavita hone par bhi kahin bhi maryaada kaa ulanghan dekhne ko nahin miltaa he

 Jurisprudence or jurisprudence is the theory of law, study and philosophy
 isamen samast vidhik siddhanth sammilit hai, jo kanoon banaate hai
 Jurisprudence scholars, also known as jurists or legal theorists, hope to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, legal reasoning, legal systems and legal institutions
 vidhi ke vigyaan ke rup main vidhishastra, vidhi ke bare main ek vishesh tarah kii khojbin he
 In the ordinary sense, all statutory principles are inherent in jurisprudence
 vidhishastra "jurisprudence" arthath Juris = vidhaan, Prudence = gyaan
 In this sense all the books of law are books of law
 is prasang main kanoon kaa ekmaatr arth hota he desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon, jo un niyamon se sarvatha pruthak he, jinhen kanoon se saadrishy rahane ke kaaran kanoon kaa naam diya jaataa he
 If we use the word science in its more and more comprehensive form in which knowledge of any subject of intellectual research is known, then we can say that jurisprudence is the science of general law of the country
 pracheenatam bhartiya vidhishastra dharamshastra ke anek paathon main maujuud hai, jaise kii bodhayan kaa dharamshastra
 The law has equal rights for providing emotional support to human beings and for the proper consumption of the amenities provided by nature
 vidhi dwaara maanviya hit main sangrakshit yah vidha hi "prakritik vidhi" kahi jaati he
 Alpine - "knowledge of divine and human things, science of fair and improper things" vidhishastra teen shakhaon main vibhakt he- The objective of statutory representation is to present the fact of the system of any proposed method, whether it is present or in the past
 vaidhanik itihaas kaa uddeshy he us aitihaasik prakriya ko upasthit karnaa jisase koi kanoon pranali viksit hui he yaa hui thi
 The purpose of the doctrine of law is to present the law - not the law which is present or was in the past, but rather the law which is appropriate to be according to the country, time, vessel
 vidhishastra ko kisi vaidhanik pranali ke vartmaan yaa bhoot se apeksha nahin he, yah iske adarshamay bhavishya se sambhddha he
 Jurisprudence theory has three parts - analytical jurisprudence, historical jurisprudence, and moral jurisprudence
 vishleshnatmak shakha main krambaddh vaidhanik siddhant ke darshanik athwa saamaanya vichaar hote hai; aitihaasik shakha main vaidhanik itihaas kaa darshanik athwa saamaanya bhaag hota he; naitik shakha main vidhannirmaan ke darshanik siddhant rahete hai
 But these three branches are inter-related
 at: inhen ek duusare se pruthak kar inpar vichaar nahin kar sakate
 See, Analytical Jurisprudence vishleshnatmak vidhishastra kaa uddeshy hota he - 'vidhaan ke moulik siddhanton kaa vishleshan'
 It is necessary to consider their historical origin, development, moral sense or belief in this context
 iske antargat nimnlikhit vishay aate hai- Originally related to the origin and development of simple principles of legislation
 jin sroton se desh kaa saadhaaran vidhaan prabhavit hota he, ve bhi isaki seemaa ke antargat he
 In other words, it is a history of the basic principles of legislation and the spirit of their method
 naitik vidhishastra, vidhaan kii vivechna naitik ganbhiry evam isaki purnataa kii drushti se karata he
 The intellectual element of the system of law or its historical development has no purpose
 vidhaan ke uddeshy evam kis seemaa tak tathaa kis rup main isaki purti hoti he, yahi iskaa vishay he
 Generally, its goal and purpose is to follow justice by the physical power of the state under a political firm
 at: naitik vidhishastra yah dekhtaa he ki nyaay ke siddhant kaa vidhaan se kahan tak sambandh he
 It is the meeting point of moral and legal philosophy
 apane saamaanya rup main nyaay, naitikta athwa naitik darshan se sambhddha he
 Justice, in its particular form, is associated with that branch of legal philosophy as the last line of law of the country, which is called moral jurisprudence
 isaki paridhi ke antargat saamaanya: nimnlikhit vishay aate hai- See, comparative jurisprudence sansar ke bhinn bhinn deshon main vidhishastra kii paribhaasha kinchit bhinn bhinn roopon main kii gai he
 Motomoti is a synonym for legislative law in Germany, which aims at scientific study

 sanathan bhartiya vidhaan main vidhishastra dharamshastra par aadhaarit he
 "dharma" is defined as the following- arthath veda, smriti, sadachaar evam suniti dharm ke udgam hai
 "religion" is the broad term
 dharmik, naitik, saamaajik evam vaidhanik drushti se yah manushya ke kartavya evam daayitv kii samshti he
 The dividing line between religious and secular feeling cannot be established, because there are so many subjects which are both religious and worldly
 bharat kaa sanathan dharm raja athwa shaasha ke aadesh par aadhaarit nahin he
 Its belief is embedded in it
 smritikaron or unke purvajon ne kaha he ki "dharm bhagwaan kii dein he
 It is the king of kings
 isse adhik shaktishaalee doosraa koi nahin
 With its help, even the powerless can take their authority from the powerful
 raja nyaay kaa nirmaataa nahin, keval iskaa paalak he
 " vidhivetta austin kinwa bentham ke siddhant ke anusaar sanathan dharm kaa adhikansh naitikta main sannivisht ho jayega, kyonki yah "dharm" kisi raja athwa saarvbhaum sattaprapt shaasha kaa aadesh nahin he
 It is true that Smriti is not a law of its own, as neither the legislature nor the state declared it
 par yah jas receptom ke siddhant par maanya tha arthath samaaj ne ise grahan kar liya tha
 Therefore, according to one belief, the origin of the law of memory is society
 iskaa ek ansh naitik aadesh he, jiskaa strot naiysargik mana gaya he evam avshesh parampara evam sadachaar he
 Recognition of the words of memory is the authority of their statutory injunction, being based on the personality and respect of the memorialists and Suniti
 kautilya ke arthshaastra ke pramanik sanskaran prakashit hone par yah vivaad uth khadaa hua ki bharat main rajanirmit vidhaan dharamshastra dwaara ghoshit vidhaan se kisi samay adhik maanya tha yaa nahin
 Kautilya has said that the legislation is based on four pillars - inamen parvarti aadhaar kramagat purv ke aadhaar se adhik shaktishaalee he kintu yah smaraneey he ki rajashilaalekh dwaara dharamshastra main kathith kisi bhi moulik aadesh athwa vyavhaar kaa ulanghan nahin hua
 Kautilya also admitted in principle that the legislative legislation is not outside the purview of theology
 dekhen, vidhik samajashaastra In the early 19th century, the French philosopher Augusta Kont named the term sociology
 samajashaastra sthool rup se samaaj kaa adhyayan he
 Legislation is also included in the study of a sociologist but is different from his point of view
 vakil, adhivaktaa yaa nirnaayak ke rup main, un niyamon ko dekhtaa he jinhen sarsaadhaaran ko anukaran karnaa chahie
 The sociologist observes what these rules are
 kuch had tak donon saath chal sakate hai, kyonki vastav main ye niyam vaanchit charitra ke dyotak hai
 But the sociologist is more keen in the actual character, not in the idea of the desired character
 vaidhanik samajashaastra ko aparaadhashastra bhi kehete hai
 It studies all of these because of the crimes, the character of the criminals, the impact of various types of punishments on criminals - especially the extent to which the punishment is reduced by crime
 isse kanoon ke sudhaar main suvidha hoti he
 According to Samand, the study of jurisprudence has its own unique interest, due to which it can be compared to a branch of serious knowledge
 vastav main anumaan or siddhanth kaa prakritik aakarshan hota he
 Forensic research influences legal, political, social, etc
 ideas, so the study of jurisprudence is important

 According to Dias, this gives the law and the right to the theory and life of life as it considers human ideas in relation to social science
 vidhik avadharanaon ke taarkik vishleshan se vidhivettaon kii taarkik paddati kaa vikaas hota he
 From this, the evil of the legalistic commercialism of the jurist can be overcome
 diase ne mana ki vidhishastra vidhi main jeevandaayee kaa vikaas kar adhyeta main pratibha nikhaar kii anuprerna detaa he
 JG Fillmore has clarified that the science of jurisprudence is so high that its knowledge makes its scholar enter life with knowledgeable concepts and impulses that can be applied to all expectations that arise in human conditions
 laski ne vidhishastra ke mahatv kaa moolyankan karte hue ise ‘vidhi kaa netra’ kaha he
 The way to solve the increasing intricacies of the law and the complexities of human relations can be found in the study of jurisprudence
 isiilie ise vidhi kaa vyakaran mana gaya he
 According to Anirudh Prasad, conscious study of the legal system must solve social problems and make sense of justice
 vartmaan jail sudhaar, kaidiyon ke saath maanviya vyavhaar kii apeksha, maanav garima ke saath jeene k adhikaar ke saath soshal ection litygeshan tathaa lok hit vaadon kaa anveshan naveen vidhishastreey drushtikon se hi upja he
 Likewise, environmental reform law, free legal aid for the poor, etc
 The interdisciplinarity of jurisprudence and other social sciences is a product of exchange of knowledge and mutual effects
 vidhishastra vidhi kii vibhinn shakhaon kii moolbhoot sankalpanaaon ke saiddhanthik aadhaaron kaa hi gyaan nahin karaata he balki unke antarsambandhon kaa bhi gyaan karaata he
 Jurisprudence does not only administer justice through the legal system, but through the discovery of new principles, ideas and other routes, it helps in establishing a just society

 In the eyes of the jurist, law is the set of influences by which decisions are rendered in courts
 kanoon kaa pratham lakshya he saamaajik dwandvon kaa niraakaran, yadhyapi sab prakaar ke dwandv is seemaa ke andar nahin aate
 According to jurist Rusco Pound, the work of law is to balance the mutual rights of the people, so that every person gets the maximum and has to sacrifice minimum for the benefit of society
 antarsahajivi aisa jeev hota he jo ek sahjivi-sambandh main kisi anya jeev ke sharir yaa koshikaon ke andar vaas karata ho
 This relationship is not necessarily mutually beneficial

 dwitaron main zyaada roshan taare ko mukhya tara bolte hai or kam roshan taare ko amukhya tara yaa "saathi tara" bolte hai
 Sometimes the same meaning of Dwitara and Dohara is derived, but there are differences between the two
 dohare taare aise do taare hote hai jo prithvi se ikaithe nazar aate hon
 This can be either because they are actually together in the Dwitara mandal or because they are sitting close to each other while sitting on the earth but they really have nothing to do with each other
