 In this, the story of the well-known Lord Rama is described, but like other Ramayana, it is a poetry book rather than a devotional book
 'ramchandra chandrika' keshavadas kii suprasiddh kriti he jo saamanytah 'ramchandrika' kehalaati he
 The poet himself has clearly mentioned the time of its creation in the book- is prakaar iskaa rachanakaal 1601 i0 he
 The version of its original text was published in litho printing by Kanhaiyalal Radhelal, Lucknow
 isaki janaki prasad krit tikaa venkateshwar press, mumbai se san 1907 i0 main or navalkishor press, lakhanu se san 1915 i0 main prakashit hui
 Lala Bhagwadin's modern-day Hindi commentary has been the most famous commentary on 'ramachandrika'
 deen ji kii tikasahit 'ramchandra chandrika' kaa purvardh sahitya sevasadan, banaras se tathaa uttarardh sahitya bhushan karyaalay, banaras se 1923 i0 main prakashit hua
 Repeats of Lalaji's commentary started being published by Ramnarayan Lal Bookseller, Prayag from 1929 AD
 iske mul paath kaa ek pramanik sanskaran acharya vishwanath prasad mishra ke sampadan main 'keshav-granthawali, bhaag-2' ke rup main hindustani academy, elahabaad se bhi prakashit ho chukaa he
 'ramachandra Chandrika' is completed in 1717 verses, including a story list in 39 light
 acharya vishwanath prasad mishra ke anusaar yadhyapi is main suprasiddh ramakatha varnit he tathaapi yah kavy kaa granth he, bhakthi kaa nahin
 Keshava being a Dixit in the 'nimbarka Sampradaya' Radha was a worshiper of Krishna, not of Rama
 yadhyapi ramchandrika ramakatha sambandhi mahakavy he phir bhi is main varnit katha valmikiy ramayana or ramcharitamanas se bhinnata rakhti he
 However, according to the poet's mention, the inspiration to create this epic got him from Adikavi Valmiki
 unhone likhaa he ki The story of the first half of this period has some resemblance to the Valmiki Ramayana, but in the latter, the poet's personal origin and system is the main one
 is kavy ke madhyam se kavi kaa paanditya pradarshit hua he
 From the point of view of dialogue-planning, ornament-planning, verses-planning, this poem presents the skill of the poet's master
 isamen kavi ne susambaddha kathatmak parampara ko tod diya he
 In fact, he has taken direct support in this book from the Sanskrit 'prasannaraghava', 'hanumannataka' etc
 'kadambari' kaa bhi spasht prabhaav he
 By taking the basis of the plays and leaving the narrative part, the names of the speakers of the dialogues have to be kept separate from the verse
 samvaad-yojana naatakeey dhang se kii gayi he, isliye drishy kavy ke rup main iskaa upyog vishesh saralata se ho saktaa he
 In spite of the primacy of devotion in this poem of Keshav, Rama is considered an avatar and preached to him at many places
 parinamswarup upadeshaatmak ansh kaaphi ho gayi hai or kavyatv ko kshati pahaunchi he
 Keshava has been considered the era writer of Reetikal and the first teacher of Hindi
 is drushti se ramchandrika main bhi acharyatv kii prabalata spasht dikhti he
 From the point of view of style, there is a tendency to present examples of different types of verses
 aisa jaan padataa he ki kavi kisi ko pingal kii paddati sikhaa rahe hon
 The language of Ramachandrika is Sanskritpradhan Braj Bhasha
 sanskrit shabdon ke atyadhik prayog tathaa alankaar ke chamatkaar ke chakkar main pad jane se rachana bojhil or clisht ho gayi he
 In this book, the performance of Pandity is more powerful than the poet's warmth
 acharya vishwanath prasad mishra ke shabdon main nihsandeh yah keshav ke mahaan panditya evam acharyatv ko purna rup se abhivyakt karti he
 Study of Ramachandra Chandrika is indisputable in order to penetrate the ancient Hindi literature
 hindi sahitya main iskaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Its bitter critics have also been emphasizing on its reading
 ramban bharat ke jammu or kashmir rajya main ek nagar or zila he
 It is situated in the great Pir Panjal ranges and is a part of the Jammu Department of the state
 banihaal isi zile main aata he or kashmir ghati main pravesh karne se pehle antim padaav he
 Even before the rail and Jawahar road tunnels were built, traffic used to travel to Kashmir from the nearby Banihal Pass
 ramban main kashmiri bhashaa kii ek upbhasha, rambani boli jaati he - haalanki isamen gahare dogri bhashaa ke prabhaav bhi dekhe jate hai
 The local population is around 70% Muslim and 30% Hindu

 Hearing Indra's words, Naradji began to say again - that vicious Kansa told one of his gatekeepers - to protect my dear sister completely from this life
 dwarpal ne kaha- aisa hi hoga
 After Kansa's departure, her younger sister went to the pond with grief on the pretext of taking water
 us talab ke kinare ek ghanghor vriksh ke neeche baithkar devaki rone lagi
 At the same time, a beautiful woman, whose name was Yashoda, came and said to Devaki in dear speech - o Kante! Why are you moaning like this? apane rone kaa kaaran mujhase bataao
 Then the distressed Devaki said to Yashoda - o sister! My elder brother Kansa, who is obsessed with low deeds
 us dusht bhrata ne mere kai putron kaa vadh kar diya
 i currently have an eighth son in my womb
 vah iskaa bhi vadh kar daalega
 There is no doubt or doubt in this matter, because my elder brother fears that he will die from my eighth son
 devaki kii baaten sunakar yashoda ne kaha- he bahan! vilaap mat karo
 i am also pregnant
 yadi mujhe kanya hui to tum apane putr ke badale us kanya ko le lenaa
 Thus your son will not be killed at the hands of Kamsa
 tadnantar kansa ne apane dwarpal se poocha- devaki kahan he? is samay vah dikhaai nahin de rahi he
 Then the gatekeeper said to Kamsa in humble words- o Maharaj! Your sister has gone to the lake to collect water
 yah sunate hi kansa krodhit ho uthaa or usne dwarpal ko usee sthaan par jane ko kaha jahaan vah gai hui he
 The gatekeeper saw Devaki near the pond
 tab usne kaha ki aap kis kaaran se yahaan ai hai
 On hearing her talk, Devaki said that there was no water in my house, which i have come to the reservoir to collect
 iske pashchaat devaki apane grih kii ore chali gai
 Kansa again told the gatekeeper that in this house you should protect my sister completely
 ab kansa ko itnaa bhay lagane laga ki grih ke bheetar daravaajon main vishaal taale band karvaa die or daravaaje ke baahar daityon or rakshason ko paharedaari ke liye niyukt kar diya
 Kansa was trying to save his life in every way
 ek samay singh raashi ke surya main akaash mandal main jaladhari meghon ne apana prabhutv sthapit kiya
 It was half past midnight on the eighth day of Krishna Paksha of Bhadau month
 us samay chandramaa bhi vrish raashi main tha, rohinee nakshatra buudhvaar ke din saubhagyayog se sanyukt chandramaa ke aadhi raat main udai hone par aadhi raat ke uttar ek ghadi jab ho jaae to shruti-smriti puranokt fal nihsandeh praapt hota he
 Narrating thus, Naradji said to Indra - Shri Krishna was born in such auspicious auspicious moment and in the same moment the doors of the prison house itself opened
 dwaar par paharaa dene vaale paharedaar rakshas sabhi murchhit ho gaye
 Devaki said to her husband Vasudev at the same moment- o Lord! You abandon sleep and take this eight son of mine to Gokul, give this son to Yashoda, the wife of Nand Gop
 us samay yamunaji purnrupase badhgrast thim, kintu jab vasudevaji balak krishna ko soup main lekar yamunaji ko paar karne ke liye utre usee kshan balak ke charnon kaa sparsh hote hi yamunaji apane purv sthir rup main aa gayi
 Somehow Vasudevji reached Gokul and upon entering Nanda's house he immediately gave him his son and took his daughter in return
 ve tatkshan vahaan se waapas aakar kansa ke bandi grih main pahunch gaye
 In the morning, when all the demons were awakened by watchman sleep, Kansa asked the gatekeeper, what happened to Devaki's womb? Find out and tell me
 dwarapalon ne maharaj kii ajna ko maanate hue karagaar main jaakar dekha to vahaan devaki kii god main ek kanya thi
 Seeing which the gatekeepers informed Kansa, but Kansa was afraid of that girl
 atah vah swayan karagaar main gaya or usne devaki kii god se kanya ko jhapat liya or use ek pathar kii chattan par patake diya kintu vah kanya vishnu kii maaya se akaash kii ore chali gai or antariksh main jaakar vidyut ke rup main parinit ho gai
 He said to Kansa, o evil one! The one who killed you has been born in Nanda's house in Gokul and your death is sure from that
 meraa naam to vaishnavi he, main sansar ke karta bhagwaan vishnu kii maaya se utpann hui hoon, itnaa kahkar vah swarg kii ore chali gai
 Kansa got angry on hearing that Akashvani
 usne nandji ke grih main putana rakshasi ko krishna kaa vadh karne ke liye bheja kintu jab vah rakshasi krishna ko stanpan karaane lagi to krishna ne uske stan se uske praanon ko khinch liya or vah rakshasi krishna-krishna kehete hue mrityu ko praapt hui
 When Kansa received the news of Pootna's death, he sent a monster named Keshi in the form of horse to slay Krishna, followed by a monster named Arishta in the form of a bull, but both of these also died at the hands of Krishna
 
 iske pashchaat kansa ne kaalyakhya naamak daitya ko kauwe ke rup main bheja, kintu vah bhi krishna ke haathon maaraa gaya
 Kansa is horrified by the trauma of the death of his powerful demons
 usne dwarapalon ko ajna di ki nand ko tatkaal mere samaksh upasthit karo
 When the gatekeeper appeared with Nanda, Kansa said to Nandji that if you want to save your life, bring flowers of Parijat
 yadi tum nahin laa paae to tumhaara vadh nishchit he
 After listening to Kansa's words, Nand said 'so will it' and went towards his house
 ghar aakar unhone sampurna vrittant apni patni yashoda ko sunaaya, jise shrikrishna bhi sun rahe the
 One day Sri Krishna was playing ball with his friends on the banks of river Yamuna and suddenly he himself threw the ball into Yamuna
 yamuna main gend phenkane kaa mukhya uddeshy yahi tha ki ve kisi prakaar parijaat pushpon ko le aaen
 So they climbed the Kadamb tree and jumped into the Yamuna
 krishna ke yamuna main kudane kaa samachar shridhar naamak gopal ne yashoda ko sunaaya
 Hearing this, Yashoda rushed to the banks of the Yamuna river and she prayed to the Yamuna river and said - o Yamuna! If i see the child, i will definitely observe Ashtami fasting with the Rohini of Bhadrapad month because mercy, charity, gentle beings, birth in Brahmin clan, Rohiniyukta Ashtami, Gangajal, Ekadashi, Gaya Shraddha and Rohini fast are all rare
 hajaaron ashwamedh yajna, sahasron rajasuya yajna, daan tirth or vrath karne se jo fal praapt hota he, vah sab krishnashtami ke vrath ko karne se praapt ho jaataa he
 Narada Rishi said this to Indra
 indra ne kaha- he muniyon main shreshth naarad! yamuna nadi main kudane ke baad us ballrupi krishna ne pataal main jaakar kya kiya? yah sampurna vrittant bhi bataaen
 Narada said- o Indra! Nagaraj's wife said to that child in Hades, what are you doing here, where have you come from and what is the purpose of coming here? nagpatni boleen- he krishna! kya tuune dyutakrida kii he, jisamen apana samast dhan haar gaya he
 If this thing is right, then go to your home with pebbles, crowns and necklaces because my lord is sleeping at this time
 yadi ve uth gaye to ve tumhaara bhakshan kar jaayenge
 Hearing Nagapatni's words, Krishna said- 'O Kante! For what purpose have i come here, i will tell you the account
 samaj lo main kaaliyanag ke mastak ko kansa ke saath dyut main haar chukaa hum or vahi lene main yahan aayaa hoon
 Nagapatni became very angry on hearing this, of the child Krishna and while raising her sleeping husband, she said - o master! This enemy has come to your house
 atah aap iskaa hanan kiijie
 Hearing the words of his mistress, Kalyanag woke up from his sleep state and started fighting with the child Krishna
 is yuddh main krishna ko moorchha aa gai, usee murchha ko dur karne ke liye unhone garud kaa samaran kiya
 Garuda came there as soon as he remembered
 shrikrishna ab garud par chadhakar kaaliyanag se yuddh karne lage or unhone kaliyanag ko yuddh main parajeet kar diya
 Now Kaliyanag knew very well that the one whom i am fighting, he is Lord Krishna, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu
 atah unhone krishna ke charnon main sashtaang pranaam kiya or parijaat se utpann bahut se pushpon ko mukut main rakhkar krishna ko bhent kiya
 When Krishna was about to walk, Kaliyanag's wife said, "O Lord! i did not know Krishna
 he janardan mantra rahit, kriya rahit, bhakthibhaav rahit meri raksha kiijie
 Oh God! Give me back my master
 tab shrikrishna ne kaha- he sarpini! daityon main jo sabase balavaan he, us kansa ke saamne main tere pati ko le jaakar chhod doongaa anyathaa tum apane grih ko chali jaao
 Now Shri Krishna came over the Yamuna dancing on the Kaliyanag's fun
 tadnantar kaaliya kii phunkaar se teenon lok compymaan ho gaye
 Now Krishna went to the city of Mathura in Kansa
 vahaan kamalpushpon ko dekhakar yamunaake madhya jalashay main vah kaaliya sarp bhi chalaa gaya
 Here Kansa was also amazed and Krishna returned to Gokul with a happy mood
 unke gokul aane par unki mata yashoda ne vibhinn prakaar ke utsav kiye
 Now Indra asked Naradji- o Mahamune! The creature of the world became very happy when the child Shri Krishna came
 aakhir shrikrishna ne kya-kya charitra kiya? vah sabhi aap mujhe bataane kii krupa karen
 Narada said to Indra - Mathura Nagar, which defeats the mind, is located in the south part of the river Yamuna
 vahaan kansa kaa mahabalshayi bhai chanur rahata tha
 Sri Krishna's wrestling was announced from that Chanur
 he indra! The wrestling between Krishna and Chanur was very surprising
 chanur kii apeksha krishna balaroop main the
 Kansa and Keshi, with the words of Bheri Shankha and Mridang, were watching this war in the middle of the public meeting in Mathura
 shrikrishna ne apane pairon ko chanur ke gale main phasaakar uskaa vadh kar diya
 After the death of Chanur, he had a fight with Keshi
 ant main keshi bhi yuddh main krishna ke dwaara maaraa gaya
 After the death of Keshi, all the creatures watching the war fought started shouting Krishna
 balak krishna dwaara chanur or keshi kaa vadh hona kansa ke liye atyant hriday vidaarak tha
 Therefore, he called the soldiers and ordered them to fight with Krishna, equipped with all weapons and weapons
 he indra! usee kshan shrikrishna ne garud, balram tathaa sudarshan chakra kaa dhyaan kiya, jiske parinamswaroop baldevaji sudarshan chakra lekar garud par arudh hokar aae
 Seeing them coming, child Krishna took the Sudarshan Chakra from him and sat on the back of Garuda himself and killed many demons and demons, how many bodies were mutilated
 is yuddh main shrikrishna or baldev ne asankhya daityon kaa vadh kiya
 Balaramji with his Ordnance Arms plow and Krishna with Sudarshan Chakra, on the Saptami of the Shukla Paksha of Magha month, annihilated a group of huge demons
 jab ant main keval duraachaari kansa hi batch gaya to krishna ne kaha- he dusht, adharmee, duraachaari ab main is mahayuddh sthal par tujhse yuddh kar tathaa tera vadh kar is sansar ko tujhse mukt karaaunga
 Saying this, Shri Krishna grabbed her hair and twisted the Kansa and slammed it to the earth, causing her death
 kansa ke marane par devataaon ne shankhaghosh va pushpavrishti kii
 The community present there was hailing Shri Krishna
 kansa kii mrityu par nand, devaki, vasudev, yashoda or is sansar ke sabhi praaniyon ne harsh parv manaaya
 After listening to this story, Indra said to Naradji- o sage, tell us the complete legislation of this Krishna Janmashtami and what virtue is achieved by doing it, what is the method of doing it? naradji ne kaha- he indra! bhadrapada maas kii krishnajanmashtami ko is vrath ko karnaa chahie
 On that day, following the rules of Brahmacharya, Shri Krishna should be established
 sarvapratham shrikrishna kii murti swarna kalash ke upar sthapit kar chandan, dhoop, pushp, kamalpushp aadi se shrikrishna pratimaa ko vastra se veshtit kar vidhipurvak archan karen

 nyaayashastra kanoon kaa siddhant or darshan he
 Jurisprudence scholars or legal philosophers expect to gain in-depth knowledge of the nature of law, legal reasoning, legal systems and legal institutions
 aadhunik nyaayashastra kii shuruyaat 18veen sadi main hui or prakritik kanoon, naagarik kanoon tathaa rashtron ke kanoon ke siddhanton par sarvapratham adhik dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya
 Ordinary or general jurisprudence can be divided into those classes by types of questions, or how to best answer these questions by finding both the principles of jurisprudence or the schools of ideology that scholars want to discuss
 kanoon kaa samakaleen darshan, jo saamaanya nyaayashastra se sambandhit hai, samasyaon kii charchaa mote taur par do virgon main karata he: The answers to these questions come from the four primary centers of ideology of general jurisprudence: kanoon ke samakaleen darshanik ronold dorkin kaa adhyayan bhi gauratlab he jinhonen nyaayashastra ke rachnawadi siddhant kii vakaalat kii he jise prakritik kanoon ke siddhanton evam saamaanya nyaayashastra ke vastunishthavaadi siddhanton ke madhya-maarg ke rup main vishesh rup se chinhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The English vocabulary is based on the Latin word jurisprudencia: juris is the genitive of juice which means "law" and prudencia means "knowledge"
 The term was first attested in English in 1628, at a time when the word "prudence" meant "knowledge or in any case a prone mind" was now obsolete

 From the early era of the Roman Empire to the middle of the third century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable sections, including the Proculians and Savinians
 The magnitude of the scientific seriousness of the studies was unprecedented according to ancient times and reached an extraordinary height of intellectual perfection

 Natural law is closely associated with morality and in historically influential versions, there are also divine ideas

 The idea of the rule of objective morality is external to the human legal system, which is the root of natural law
 kya sahi he athwa kya galat he yah kisi ke apane hitsaadhan ke centre ke anusaar alag-alag ho sakate hai
 Natural law can sometimes be identified with the adage that "an unjust law cannot be a law", but as natural law is considered the most important of modern advocates, John Finis has argued that This saying is a minor guide to the classical Thomist position
 arestu ko aksar prakritik kanoon kaa pita kaha jaataa he
 Like his philosophical ancestors, Socrates and Plates, Aristotle accepted natural justice or natural authority Aristotle's fifth volume of his book on the Nicomachian Code of Conduct
 nyaay kaa arestu kaa siddhant sunahare madhyamaarg vichaar se bandhaa hua he
 Indeed what he calls "political justice" is derived from his discussion of moral virtue as the intervening medium of virtues, as he has arranged for every other virtue
 nyaay par unke apane siddhant ke bare main lambi bahes nicomacian athiks main nihit he or yah is sawaal se shuru hota he ki nyaaypurna karm kaa madhyamaan kis prakaar kaa he
 They argue that the terminology of "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas, general justice and special justice
 jab ek vyakti ke kaary dusron se sambandhit sabhi maamalon main sarvagun sampann hon, to arestu uske nyaay ko saamaanya nyaay ke arth main sweekaar karte hai, thik usee rup main jaisaa ki nyaay kii dharna kamobesh gun ke saath sahavsthaan karti he
 "special" or "special justice", in opposition to each other, is a part of general justice or personal virtue that is related to treating others equally
 arestu nyaay kii is anadhikrut charchaa se raajnneetik nyaay ke saapeksh drushtikon kii or sankramit ho jate hai, jisase unka taatpary aadhunik nyaayashastra ke vishay ke kuch-kuch kareeb hona he
 Regarding political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly a matter of tradition
 ise ek aise vaktavy ke rup main liya ja saktaa he jo aadhunik prakritik kanoon ke saiddhantikonke drushtikon se miltaa-julata he
 But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is expressing his views on the ethics point of view, not on the system of law and hence his comments on nature here are about the early teaching of morality enacted as law and not About the law itself
 This paragraph is silent in response to this question
 sarvottam sakshya ki prakritik kanoon ke bare main arestu kii chintaadhara sahitya-shaastra se uddbhut he jahaan arestu yah ullekh karte hai ki, "vishesh" kanoonon ke alaave jinhen harek vyakti ne apane liye tay kar liya he, ek "aam" kanoon bhi he jo prakruti ke anusaar he
 However, the context of this comment suggests that Aristotle advised only that literature urges such a law from the classical point of view can be convenient, especially when the "special" law of one's city becomes unfavorable to the case
 It was not given that there was actually any such law
 In addition, Aristotle rejected the consultation of natural law, universally valid for two out of three candidates, in this article
 As a result, the tradition of Aristotle's tradition of natural law has become controversial
 sharia ko islamic kanoon kaa sangrah kaha jaataa he
 This terminology means "method" or "way", a legal framework under which most of the private issues of life are lived for them legally without the Islamic principles of justice
 fiqh islamic nyaayashastra ke liye shabdaawalee he, jo islamic nyayavidon ke faislon se bana he
 The fiqh component of Islamic studies, Fiqh elaborates on the method by which Islamic law is drawn out of primary and secondary sources
 islam kii mukhyadhara fiqh kii pahchaan karaati he, jiskaa matlab he ke peeche un usulon ko vistaar se jaananaa or samajhaana jinhen sharia se vidwaanon ne uddhrut kiye hai
 Scholars are hopeful that Fiqh and Sharia can be a prophet of peace in any issue, but this cannot be ascertained
 islamic falsafe main tark ke shuruuaati dhaanche ko qiyas kii prakriya ke jariye 7veen sadi se islamic nyaayashastra main lagu kiya gaya
 During the golden age of Islam, there used to be a logical debate among philosophers and jurists of Islam on whether the subject of kyaas was a subject of persuasive debate or an absolute judgment
 kuch islamic vidwaanon ne yah tark pesh kiya he ki kiyas kaa sandarbh daleel kii vivechna se he, jise ebn hajm ne yah daleel pesh karte nahin mana he, ki kiyas kaa rishta prarek bahes se nahin, balki nirpeksh nyaay se he, lekin ve nirpeksh nyaay ko sahi myne main evam lakshanik arthon main saadrush sahdharmee daleel maanate he
 On the other hand, Al Ghazali argued that Qiyas truly meant the analogous coherent argument, and in a figurative sense the absolute judgment sentence
 Other Islamic scholars at the time argued that the word Qiyas truly meant an absolute syllogism as well as an absolute judgment sentence

 akinas ne kanoon ke chaar prakaaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 These are eternal, natural, human, and divine laws
 The eternal law is the law of God who rules over the entire creation
 prakritik kanoon shashavat vidhi vidhaan main maanviya "sahabhaagita" he jisaki khoj yukti-tark se kii jaati he
 Natural laws are, no doubt, based on "first principles": akinas ne jeene evam prajnan karne kii ichha ko un sabhi moolbhoot maanviya mulyon ke saath ginaye he jinpar sabhi maanviya mulya aadhaarit hai
 Humanitarian law is positive law: natural laws are applied to societies by the government
 alokik kanoon vah kanoon he jo dharmagranthon main vishesh rup se vyakt hua he
 In his treatise Leviathan, Hobbes expresses his view of the proverb of natural law as, on the basis of logic or the general rule that a man is forbidden to do anything that is destructive to his life Or takes away the means to protect life; And leaving it or forgetting it was the most safe way through which he thinks
 hobbs ek sanvidaakaar tha or uskaa yah maananaa tha ki kanoon ne logon kii ankahi sahmati hasil kar lee
 unka maananaa tha ki prakruti kii avasthaa se samaaj kii sanrachana logon ko maanavjaati ke bich jo anyathaa vidyaman hai, yuddh kii sthiti se suraksha pradaan karne ke liye hui

 In post-world War II writings, Lawn L
 Fuller specifically emphasized that the law must meet certain formal requirements
 If the institutional system of social control fails to meet these requirements to an extent, Fuller argues that we are not fully willing to accept it as a system of law, either, we do not respect it Huh
 is prakaar, kanoon kii aatanrik naitikta ban jaati he jo samjik niyamon se pare nikal jaati he jinke jariye vaid kanoon banaae jate hai
 Fuller and scholar HLA Hart were collaborators at Oxford University
 fuller, jo ek prakritik adhivaktaa the tathaa heart, jo ek pratyakshvaadi the, donon ke bich is baat ko lekar asahmati thi ki kya naaji kanoon itnaa bura tha ki ise baad main or aage kanoon mana hi nahin gaya
 Artificial positivism and the principles of natural law can sometimes look more similar to each other than the above descriptions and they can accept the other "side" at certain points
 pratyakshvaadi ke rup main athwa ek prakritik kanoon ke saidhantik ke rup main ek vishisht siddhantvaadi kii pahchaan main kabhi-kabhi prabhaav or degree shaamil hote hai, tathaa siddhantkaar ke kaary par padane vaale vishesh prabhaav
 vishesh rup se, puraane prakritik adhivaktaa, jaise ki akinas evam jon lock ne vishleshnatmak or maanak nyaayashastra main koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya he
 But modern natural advocates, such as John Finis, have claimed to be positivists, while still arguing that the law is essentially a moral animal
 vishleshnatmak, athwa 'spashtikaarak' nyaayashastra kanoonee vyavastha ke pahaluon kii charchaa karte hue vichaar ke tatasth bindu evam varnanaatmak bhashaa kaa vyavhaar kar rahaa hai
 It was a philosophical development that rejected the integration of natural law, what law is and what it should have been
 David Hume, in his treatise a Treatise of Human Nature, made a well-argued argument that people invariably get interrupted by stating that the world has a particular way of saying that is why we have a particular way of taking action
 Should conclude
 But in the case of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we should do something only because the matter is something like that
 atah duniya jaisi he vaisaa hi vishleshan or spostikaran karte hue niamak prashn ko moolyankit kiye jane yogya prashnon se kathorta se alag-alag kar dekha janaa chahie
 The most important questions of analytical jurisprudence are: "what is law?"; "what is the law?"; "what is the relationship between law and power / " imperialism? "and," What is the relationship between law and morality? "legitimate positivism is the dominant theory, although it has an ever-increasing number of critics who present their own interpretations
 Use to do it
 pratyakshvaad kaa sidhaa sa arth he ki kanoon aisa kuch he jo "maan liya gaya" he: saamaajik rup se sweekrut niyamon ke anusaar kanoon vaid tareeke se banaae gaye hai
 The positivist ideology of law encompasses two broad principles: First, that law can seek justice, morality, or regulatory goals, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their legitimacy
 Provided that a law has been properly constituted in accordance with the rules recognized by the society concerned, only then it has been deemed to be a valid law without being recognized as justified by some other standard
 dwitiyatah, kuch niyat nishchit niyamon ke alaava kanoon kuch or nahin jo samaaj ko shashan tathaa shrinkhalaa pradaan karata he
 No legitimate positivist, however, argues that whatever happens, since the law is why the law should be followed
 This is seen as a completely different question

 Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept, an ardent prison reformer, advocate of the Republic, and an atheist with firmness
 kanoon evam nyaayashastra ke bare main bentham ke vichaaron ko unke prashikshu vidhyaarthee jon austin ke dwaara lokapriy banaaya gaya
 Austin was the first head of law at the new University of London from 1892
 "kanoon kya he?" kaa austin kaa upyogetavaadi uttar yah tha ki kanoon prabhusatta sampann se pratibandh kii dhamkee se samarthit aadesh he jiske anupaalan kii aagyaakaarita kii aadat logon ko lag hi jaati he
 Contemporary legitimate positivists rejected this idea long ago and criticized its over simplification, especially by HLA Hart
 hans kelsen 20veen sadi ke sarvshereshth nyayavidon main se ek maane jate hai tathaa europe evam latin america main ve kaaphi prabhaavshaalee rahen he, haalanki aam-kanoon vaale deshon main utana nahin he
 The purpose of his pure doctrine of law is to bind the law into binding rule-chains, as well as to deny himself the assessment of those rule-chains
 yahi kaaran he, "vaid raajnneeti" se "vaid vigyaan" ko alag kiya jaataa he
 The basic standard of the central ideal for a pure doctrine of law - a hypothetical standard, pre-judged by the judge whereby all the 'lower order' standards in a hierarchy are legitimized, starting with constitutional law, for their own right or obligation Have been taken for
 is tarah se, kelsen daawey ke saath yah maanate hai ki, vaid maanakon kii baadhyataa unke vishisht 'vaid' charitra ko bina kisi atimanviya strot jaise ki ishwar kii khoj-khabar liye bina hi manvikrut prakruti yaa - unke samay main jo sarvaadhik mahatvapurn tha- manvikrut rajya yaa raashtra ko samajha ja saktaa he

 a Heart was a prominent writer in the anglophone world, who argued that law should be understood as a system of social rules
 Hart rejected Kelsen's view that restrictions are essential to law and that normative social phenomena, like law, cannot be assimilated through non-normative social facts
 Hart revived analytical jurisprudence in his treatise The Concept of Law as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century
 oxford uniwarsity main nyaayashastra ke adhyaksh ke rup main, heart ne yah tark pesh kiya ki kanoon 'niyamon kii ek pranali' he
 Hart said that, rules, primary rules and secondary rules are divided
 madhyamik niyam adhinirnay ke niyam parivartan ke niyam tathaa manyata ke niyam vibhajit kiye gaye hai
 "rules of recognition" is a customary practice of officials that identifies certain actions and decisions as the source of law

 In recent years, debates on the nature of law began to become increasingly nuanced
 An important debate lies within legitimate positivism
 aisi vichaardhaara vaale skool ko kabhi exclusive legal pozitivsm kaha jaataa tha or yah is drushtikon se judaa he ki kisi maanak kii kanoonee vaidhata kabhi bhi isaki naitik shuddhta par nirbhar nahin rah sakati
 is vichaardhaara ke ek duusare skool ko samaveshi vaid pratyakshvaad kaa level lag gaya he, jiske pramukh prastaavak vil valuuchau hai, evam yah is vichaar se judaa hua he ki naitik vivechnaayen ek maanak kii kanoonee vaidhata nirdhaarit kar sakati hai, kintu yah aavashyak nahin ki yahi maamla ho
 Some philosophers have begun to claim that positivism is the principle that it does not "require contact" between law and morality; But contemporary ideologues, including Joseph Raaz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, refuted this ideology
 jaisaa ki raaj batalaate hai, yah ek aavashyak satya he ki aise avagun hai jo kanoonee pranali ke paas sambhavatya nahin ho sakate hai 
 Joseph Raaz supports the positivist view, but he criticizes the preface in Hart's weak social research "the Authority of Law
" raaj kaa tark he ki kanoon saamaajik sroton ke jariye, naitik tark ke sandarbh ke bina hi spasht rup se pahachaane jane yogya ek praadhikaran he
 Any classification of the Paraniums should be better than their authorized role, that any classification of rules beyond the authorized role should be left to sociology and not to be included in jurisprudence
 dorkin ne apni pustak loj empire main heart evam pratyakshvaadiyon par kanoon ko ek naitik mudde ke rup main nahin sweekaar karne ke virodh main akraman kiya he
 Dorkin argues that while law is an 'explanatory' concept, it becomes imperative for judges to seek the best use of it and find the most equitable solution to the legal dispute that constitutional traditions have given them
 unke matanusaar kanoon sampoorn rup se saamaajik tathyon par aadhaarit nahin he, kintu isamen sansthagat tathyon or prathaon ke liye jise ham sahjanubhuti se kanoonee sweekaar kar lete hai, ve naitik rup se auchity ke rup main antarbhukt hai
 It follows Dorkins' view that one cannot know whether society has a strong legal system, or some of its laws, as long as there is something about jurisprudence to put someone into practice in society Do not get to know the moral truths
 This is consistent with Dorkins' view - contrary to the views of legitimate realists or legitimate realists - that "no one" of a society can know what its laws are
 akhandta ke siddhant ke rup main dorkin ke kanoon ke anusaar arthvatta ke do aayam hai
 Before interpreting, the reading of the text must meet the test of appropriateness
 But of the interpretations that come true, Dworkin believes that the correct interpretation is the one used to provide political practices to the community for their betterment or to make them at their best
 kintu kai lekhakon ko is bare main andeh he ki kisi ek die gaye samudaay ke liye di gai jatil karypranaliyaan keval ek sarvottam auchity he or dusron ne yah andeh prakat kiya he ki aisa agar ho bhi to, unhen us samudaay ke kanoon ke ek ang ke rup main pariganit karnaa chahie
 Legal realism is a popular view of some Scandinavian and American writers
 lahaze main sanshaywaadee, iskaa maananaa he ki kanoon ko adaalaton kii vaastavik karypranaliyon, kanoon ke karyaalayon, police steshnon ke dwaara samajhnaa or nirdhaarit kiya janaa chahie, na ki niyamon evam saidhantik maton jo sanvidhiyon main nirdhaarit hai athwa vidwata se bhare shodh-prabandhon main nihit hai
 It has some similarities with the sociology of law
 kanoonee yatharthwaad kaa aavashyak tatv yah he ki sabhi kanoon kii rachana maanav praani ne kii he or is prakaar yah maanav ke naitik daurbalya nashvarataaon, evam aparipurnataaon ke adheen he
 It has become a common practice nowadays that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr
 is identified as the leading precursor to American legal realism
 Karl Llewellyn, another eminent in the American legal realist movement, similarly believes that the law is something other than a puppet in the hands of a judge who has the ability to format the outcome of a case based on personal biases
 kai log yah maanate hai ki scandinavian kanoonee yatharthwaad kii pramukh prerana excel hegerestorm kii kritiyaan hai
 Despite the decline in direct popularity, the influence of realists continued on the broad spectrum of today's jurisprudential school, including complex legal studies, feminist legal theory, critical anti-apartheid, law and economics, and law and society german kanoon ke prastaavit samhitakaran par german bahes ke dauraan aitihaasik nyaayashastra ubhar kar saamne aayaa
 In his book On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence, Friedrich Karl von Sewingi argues that Germany does not have a legal language that can support codification because the traditions, customs, and beliefs of the German people are tolerant
 Faith is not included
 itihaasavettaon kaa maananaa he ki kanoon kii utpatti samaaj ke saath hi hoti he
 In addition to the question "what is law?", The principles of regulatory, or evaluation of law are also associated with legal philosophy
 kanoon kaa uddeshy athwa lakshya kya he? koun se naitik athwa rajnatik siddhant kanoon ko aadhaar-shila pradaan karte hai? kanoon ke uchit kaary kya he? kin krityon ke liye dandadesh dhary hone chahie, evam kis prakaar ke dandon ko anumati pradaan kii jaani chahie? nyaay kya he? hamaare paas koun-koun se adhikaar hai? kanoon kaa anupaalan karne kaa koi karttavya bhi he kya? kanoon ke dwaara shashan kii kya keemat he? kuch bhinn vichaardhaara vaale skool or unke nimnlikhit chintak hai: Just as the principles of ethics emphasize the role of morality in character in the ethics of contemporary ethics

 Utilitarianism believes that the framework of the law should be prepared in such a way that the best results are possible for the majority of people
 Historically, utilitarian thinking about law has been associated with the great philosopher Jeremy Bentham

 Imagine that we do not know who we are - our caste, gender, meaning, prestige, class, or what are the specific characteristics for our introduction - so that we do not become biased in our own interest
 Rowls argues from this 'original position' that we will in fact choose the same political freedom for all, such as freedom of expression, right to vote, etc
 Apart from this, we will also choose a system in which there is only inequality because it creates enough incentive for the economic progress of all society, especially for the poorest of the poor
 This is Rowles' famous' principle of difference '

 There are many other regulatory approaches to the philosophy of law, including deeply critical legal studies and the laws of libertarian principles

 gas nalee yaa 'gasayukt nalee' ekprakaar kii electron nalee he jisamen vidyut kaa prachaalan multah nalika main bhari gas yaa vaashp ke dwaara hota he
 It is also called gas immersion tube
 isamen kisi kuchaalak taap-rodhi paatr ke andar koi samuchit gas bhari hoti he or uske bheetar electrodon kaa samuchit vinyas kiya gaya hota he
 Often the vessels are made of glass, but the characters of some tubes are also made of ceramic
 sainik upyog kii nalikaaon ke paatr dhaatu ke bane hote hai jinaki bhitari sataha kaanch kii parat hoti he
 The electrical properties of gas tubes depend to a large extent on the nature and pressure of the gases filled in these tubes
 in naliyon main thodi si gas daal di jaati he
 Most of the gases that are used are mercury vapor, organ, neon etc
 gasanalee main ye 1 se 30*10-3 millimetre dabaav par rahati hai
 As the voltage of the cation is increased from zero, the filler current starts to increase in these tubes like vacuum tubes
 tathaapi jab voltata gas ke ynikaran vibhav par pahunch jaati he, to muthbhed ke dwaara ynikaran ho jaataa he
 The filtered current reaches its full value and then there is no effect on increasing the fillet voltages more
 is parinaam ko chitra 9 main dikhya gaya he
 This is because the positive ions produced by the encounter completely remove the effect of the transfer charge, only when its control over the electron current ceases and the full electron current begins to flow
 jaisaa pehle hi bataaya ja chukaa he, is gas dwidhruvi kaa upyog rujukaran main kiya jaataa he, jahaan adhik shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; udhaahrant: preshi ke shaktistrot main
 These are gas bipoles in which a controlling grid is placed between the fillet and the minus sign
 is niyantrak grid kaa kaary bhi lagbhag nirvaat nalee ke gridniyantran sa hi he, parantu ek bahut badi vibhinnata donon ke niyantran main he
 If the potential of this grid is gradually increased from a negative value, it will be seen that as soon as its value reaches the point at which the current starts flowing, the current starts flowing from its lowest value to its absolute value
 
 jaise hi purna dhara pravaahit hone lagati he, niyatrank grid par dhara kaa kisi prakaar kaa prabhaav nahin rah jaataa
 After that no matter how much negative voltage is added to the grid, the flow of filler current cannot stop
 keval pattic voltata ko ynikaran vibhav ke kam karke pattic dhara ke pravaahan ko roka ja saktaa he
 The reason for this is that as the current flows, the ion ions are negative, covering the grid, and the grid potential has no effect in fluency
 is prakaar kii naliyon kaa upyog yojana tathaa 'trigar' ke roopon main kiya jaataa he jiskaa bahut hi mahatvapurn upyog aajkal ke electrunic upkarnon main kiya ja rahaa he

 1568 gregory calendar kaa ek adhivarsh he
 a historical novel is a genre of novel literature depicting the story of a particular period
 vaise to kisi bhi kalkhand vishesh kaa chithran aitihaasik upanyaas ho saktaa he
 Rangbhoomi, Boond and Samudra, False Truth and the sequel can also be historical novels, due to their authentic portrayal of their era; But there is an essential condition for being a historical novel - the narration of its narrative, its pre-familiarity with the readers
 duusari ore ham apni puraakathaon ko bhi apana pracheen itihaas hi maanate hai; kintu vidwaanon kaa ek varg videshi siddhanton ke anusaar use 'myth' athwa 'mithyaa' hi maananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he does not consider it his history
 parinamat: puranic upanyaason kii, aitihaasik upanyaason se ek pruthak shrenee ban gai he
 Even considering the mythology as its history, i would like the class of mythological novels to remain separate from historical novels
 kaaran ? Mythological novels are not only events of a particular time, they have their own value system
 ve upanishdon ke mulyon ko charitron ke madhyam se upanyaas ke rup main prastut kar rahe hai
 It is not appropriate to call novels which are based on mythological period, events and characters, but do not approve of that value system
 unamem se adhikansh to puranic mulya-vyavastha se aparichit athwa unke virdohi logon dwaara unhen dhwast karne ke liye hi likhe gaye hai
 The historical and biographical stories of Premchand and Premchand succeeded in reminding the society of its pride and bravery
 kintu unka jivan dirghakaalin nahin hua
 How many people remember Premchand's 'harisingh Nalwa' today? Their historical importance remains
 vrundavanlaal verma ke apane vaktavyon ke anusaar unke aitihaasik upanyaas likhane ke kuch saamaanya tathaa kuch vishesh kaaran hai
 He has admitted that he had come to mind by reading Sir Walter Scott's English novel that he would write the same novel, taking the glorious pages of India's history for the honor of India's honor
 is saamaanya kaaran ke saath-saath ek vishesh kaaran dete hue unhone ek ghatana kii charchaa kii he
 Varma ji was also invited on the occasion of a marriage to a Punjabi family settled in Bundelkhand
 vahaan us punjabi parivaar ke anek sage sambandhi or parichit bhi upasthit the
 Varma ji also heard the conversation between them, in which they were discussing derogatoryly about the poverty, backwardness and illiteracy of Bundelkhand; And were expressing their hatred towards the region and its inhabitants
 verma ji ne sweekaar kiya he ki yah sab unhen atyant apmanjanak laga or unhone vahiin sankalp kiya ki ve bundelkhand ke gaurav ko pratishthit karne ke liye upanyaas likhenge
 He investigated the history of his intended period according to his own ability, gathered evidence for his story; And also created some very historical romance
 yadhyapi unka kshetra keval bundelkhand tak hi simit he; kintu ham jaanate hai ki apni dharti se prem karne vaala lekhak apni samskruti se bhi prem karata he
 In fact only history and geography form culture
 unhone 'virata kii padmini' or 'garh kundar' jaise aitihaasik romance or 'jhansi kii rani' jaisaa itihaas-bojhil upanyaas bhi likhaa; kintu 'mriganayani' jaise santulit upanyaas bhi aae
 His approach is very clear
 lekhak apane samay se mukt nahin hota
 Vrindavanlal Varma has his own story
 ve apni lekhnee se ek yuddh kar rahe hai
 His writing is a struggle
 ve desh kaa sarvshereshth prastut karne kaa praytn kar rahe hai; or apane samaaj kaa manobal bhi badha rahe hai
 Acharya Chatursen Shastri also gets some similar statements regarding his writing
 'somnath' ke vishay main unhone likhaa he ki kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi ke upanyaas 'jai somnath' ko pard kar unke man main aakanksha jaagi ki ve munshi ke nahale par apana dahala maaren; or unhone apane upanyaas 'somnath' kii rachana kii
 In the role of 'vayanaraksham:' he has admitted that he has discovered some new facts, which he is hitting on the reader's face
 parinamat: nahale par dahala maarane ke ugr prayaas main 'somnath' adhik se adhik chamatkaarik tathaa romani upanyaas ho gaya he; or apane gyaan ke pradarshan tathaa apane khoje hue tathyon ko pathakon ke sammukh rakhane kii utaavali main, upanyaas vidha kii aavashyaktaaon kii purna upeksha kar ve 'vayangraksham:' or 'sona or koon' main prishthon ke prishth anaavashyak tathaa atirecopurna vivaranon se bharte chale gaye hai
 The absence of any specific statement or statement has helped him in this particular act
 ye koi aise lakshya nahin hai, jo kisi kriti ko saahitiyik mahatv dilaa saken athwa vah raashtra or samaaj kii smriti main apane liye dirghakaalin sthaan bana saken
 Chatursen Shastri, writing 'sona aur khoon', may have been swept away in history, forgetting that he was writing novels, so hundreds of pages went on writing history
 isse upanyaas tatv kii haani hoti he; kyonki upanyaas maatr itihaas nahin he
 The goal of writing 'vaishali Ki Nagarvadhu' and many other historical novels can also be to create a special kind of environment; But it cannot be denied that many people see the compulsion and pain of the woman in the 'city of Vaishali'
 vaise itihaas kaa vah yug, ek aisa kaal tha, jisamen sahityakar ko anek aakarshan dikhaai dete hai
 Many important works of Hindi literature have been born around Mahatma Buddha, Amrapali, Singh Senapati and Ajatshatru
 usamen stri kii asahaayta dekhi jaae, yaa ganatantron ke nirmaan or unke swaroop kii charchaa kii jaae, vatsalya kii katha kahi jaae, yaa phir marxvaadi darshan kaa saadrishy dhundha jaae - satya yah he ki vah parivesh kai drushtiyon se asaadhaaran rup se romani tha
 There is also a long list of historical novels by Raneya Raghav
 yahan tak ki unhone us kaal par bhi lambey upanyaas likhe hai, jiskaa pramanik itihaas uplabdh nahin he
 Hence it is called prehistoric period
 'murdon kaa tila' main unhone us yug kaa kaalpanik chitra prastut kiya he or apane anumaan se ek samskruti ke vilupt ho jane kaa kaaran bataaya he
 But the culture that is being certified today not only in Haryana but also in Gujarat, it ends up in a flood, does not agree very much
 duubataa ek kasbaa he, nagar duubataa he
 Sometimes an earthquake causes a city like Pompeii to collapse
 is prakaar ek puri samskruti jalplavan main samaapt nahin ho jaati
 Or was it just a cataclysm
 kintu jahaan kii yah charchaa he, vahaan se jal vilupt hone ke pramaan to mili hai, jalplavan ke nahin
 Nevertheless, the novels enjoy the flight of the author's historical imagination
 hajariprasad dvivedi ke saare hi upanyaas aitihaasik-puranic upanyaason kii shrenee main aate hai
 His ambient portrayal is amazing
 ve pramanik bhi hai or aakarshak bhi
 But Bhattini, the heroine of 'banabhatta's autobiography', is not a historical character; And not only many incidents of the novel, its rendition also depends on Bhattini
 at: vah upanyaas aitihaasik na rah kar aitihaasik romance ho jaataa he; kintu upanyaas kii drushti se vah durlabh kriti he
 'charuchandra Lekha' and 'punarnava' are works based on ancient literary works and famous folklore
 'anamadas kaa potha', upanishad ke paatr raikv muni ko kendriya paatr bana kar likhaa gaya he
 Hence, it is counted only in mythological novels; But clearly the author has his own rendition
 vah apane samay kii samasyaon ko sarvadeshik or saarvkalik samasyaon ke saath jod kar unke shaashvat samaadhaan ko khoj kar prastut kar rahaa he
 Amritlal Nagar has written many historical novels related to different eras and they all have their own importance
 kintu unke teen upanyaas 'ekda nemisharany' 'maanas kaa hans' tathaa 'khanjan nayan' kuch spashtikaran chaahate hai
 In the center of 'ekada Nemisharanya' is the subject of Mahabharata-writing
 vah upanyaas mahabharat katha se sambandhit nahin he, at: vah puranic upanyaas nahin he
 His only problem is that the present copy of Mahabharata was presented in which period and by whom
 vah kaal purnat: aitihaasik he
 The characters may be imaginary
 upanyaas kaa nayak 'mahabharat kaa punarlekhan' he
 'manas Ka Hans' and 'khanjan Nayan' are novels written by two great Hindi poets as heroes
 yadhyapi 'khanjan nayan' ke mahatv se mujhe koi inkaar nahin he; kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki apni kinhin jatiltaaon ke kaaran vah 'maanas kaa hans' ke samaan na to charchit hua or na hi lokapriy hi
 'manas Ka Hans' is a novel in many forms
 nayak goswami tulsidas ke samay kii drushti se yah aitihaasik upanyaas he or unke jivan, chintan, sadhana tapasya, lakshya or uplabdhi kii drushti se vah kisi puranic upanyaas se bhinn nahin lagata
 His protagonist is Puran Purush
 


 kintu puraana purush ko aaj ke ek saadhaaran purush se atyant dur or bhinn hona chahie, jabaki tulsi ek aise astitv hai, jinhen ham pratidin samaran karte hai or apane bahut nikat pate hai
 You can identify with them
 vah na indra kii amravati main janm letaa he, na kisi rishi ashram main
 Tulsi, an unfortunate child, is born at a time when there is a crisis on the country and the village
 yuddh chal rahaa he
 Transfer of power is taking place
 mata kaa dehanth ho jaataa he or pita use abhaagaa maan kar tyaag dete hai
 His childhood, depicted on the inner and outer evidences, tells that anyone who tries to support him moves away from the stage of the world
 usamen kuch bhi alokik nahin he, phir bhi ishwariya lila kaa pravesh ho hi jaataa he
 The one who has no one has a God
 tulsi kaa bhi ishwar hi he
 In fact, this is also similar to the story of the devotees in the Puranas that a person's ego is completely forgotten and if he surrenders completely to God, then God takes hold of his hand
 kishor hone tak tulsi dekh lete hai ki sansar main kitni hinsa he, kitna swaarth he
 Is hungry, is nangai
 ann ke liye stri or purush kaa sharir mandi main bikta he
 Power is tyrannical, wealth is compassionate, the centers of religion are immersed in enjoyment
 irshyaa dwesh main lipt hai
 Like every devotee, Tulsi also asks his God that if this creation belongs to him, then why is this world so hellish? kishoravastha main nariprem he; kintu tulsi adharm ke maarg se apana prem praapt karne kaa na saahas karte hai, na praytn
 There is nubility and struggle of nubility in youth
 nari purush kaa virodh
 The favor of Mayake and in-laws
 putree, patni or nari kaa manovigyaan
 


 and then the beginning of quietness
 antahin tohi tajenge paamar, jo na taje tu ab hi ten
 


 From here, basil appears to be rising above a normal male
 yah aswabhaavik nahin he
 Sensitive mind, sense of quietness and harshness of wife
 aise main do hi vikalp hai : yaa to ve kamini ke das ho jate, yaa phir kaam se mukt ho jate
 Had he been immoral, he would have been a slave to Kamini for a lifetime
 par ram kaa das kaam kaa das kaise ho jaataa ? The creation of a poet through Tulsi is depicted very authentically
 sarjak man to is prakaar unke saath ho letaa he, jaise srijan prakriya ko jaanane or samajhane ke liye, unka anuchar ho gaya ho
 Competitions of astrologers and writers
 vidwaanon kaa ek duusare ke viruddh shadyantr
 Fight for wealth and fame
 irshyaa dwesh ke bina to sahitya kaa shaayad kisi yug main astitv rahaa hi nahin he
 There are obstacles, temptations in the path of cultivation
 ve stri ke rup main bhi aate hai or dhan-sampatti ke rup main bhi
 Any seeker of any field knows that if he moves, small achievements are made in the form of obstacles to stop him
 yadi vah unamem ulajh jaataa he to aage nahin badhata
 If he turns them down then he reaches to great achievements
 tulsi apni vyaktigat sambandhon se mukt ho kar samgr samaaj ke ho jate hai
 Therefore, see and understand the suffering of the society
 tabhi to saamaajik seva ko ve ram kaa kaam bataate hai
 The hungry thirsty gives water and food to the killer
 or jati ke naam par lalkaar kar kehete hai : dhoot kaho, avadhoot kaho, rajput kaho, jolha kaho koi
 The son of Kahu, neither son nor wife, did not sleep without any caste
 yaheen se sansar or vairaygy kaa sambandh spasht hota he
 The world and brahm are coordinated
 sanyasi or samaaj kaa sambandh prakat hota he
 Many of the statements in Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi's Anamdas Ka Potha are remembered here
 ve kehete hai ki tapasya van main nahin hoti, samaaj main rah kar hoti he
 Basil also suffers the pain of society
 ve samaaj kii seva main lag jate hai
 Kamini and Kanchan's renunciation is the path to progress
 dhan or yash kii kaamana ko tyaage bina mukt nahin hua ja saktaa
 That is why Tulsi says that fame is worse than craving for wealth
 or ant main rahim khankhaanaa dwaara prastaavit akbar ke darbar kii mansabadari ko thukraa dete hai
 The principle of spirituality that there is no other virtue like serving the unhappy and 'but suffering is not unhappy'
 ise vyas ne bhi kaha he or tulsi ne bhi pahachaanaa he
 It is clear from here that what is the nature of renunciation and disinterest
 swaarth se upar uth kar, aasakti kaa tyaag kar, deh ke sambandhon se mukt ho kar ishwar kii banaai samgr sristi se prem; or use shiv maan kar uski seva hi vairaygy he
 God dependence is renunciation
 isi se antat: sadhak ko ishwar kii prapti hoti he
 In fact, the worship of the bright form of its history is the worship of its culture
 tulsi ne ramcharitamanas main samgr bhartiya samskruti kaa aasav prastut kiya tha
 And by making Tulsi a narrative hero, Amritlal Nagar has revived the struggle to bring his culture into his life and protect it even amidst the cruelty of foreign invasion and the harshness of foreign rule
 swami vivekananda ke sambandh main narendra kohli kaa prasiddh upanyaas 'todo kaara todo' kaa pehla khand 'nirmaan' 1992 i

 So 'break Kara Break' becomes a historical novel
 itihaas or hamaare apane yug kaa antaraal lagbhag samaapt ho jaataa he
 His hero has nothing to do with politics
 vah nayak puraana purush he; kintu kalakatta nagar kii saghan aabaadi main janma, palaa or badha he
 He has studied at the University of Calcutta
 vah rajkumaron ke samaan palaa he or apane pita ke mitron ke kaaran hi daridr ho jaataa he
 Walking barefoot in a hungry stomach, torn and dirty clothes, he falls round
 aise main use divya anubhuti hoti he
 Spirituality enters such a real world that the Sudarshan Purush, who had gone mad after seeing American girls, cannot get married
 use ek saadhaaran-si patni nahin mil paati
 About which Dr
 Henry John Wright wrote that his scholarship was more than the collective scholarship of all the learned professors of America, he does not get a hundred rupees job in the city of Calcutta
 vah swayan sweekaar karata he ki uskaa janm isliye nahin hua ki vah vivaah kar bachche paidaa kare or clerki yaa mastary kar unka paalan poshan kare
 He came to the world with a goal
 uske guru ne use 'maan kaa kaam' kaha tha
 Walking across India, he saw the suffering of the children of Mother India
 at: vibhinn riyasaton main gum-gum kar puraatan gyaan ko tyaage bina nutan yug ke gyaan ko usase jodne ko kaha tha
 Khetri Naresh Raja Ajitsinh's Physics Laboratory was opened over the palace
 vadodara ke gaekwad ko kaha tha ki apane yahan ke baalkon ko takneekee shiksha den or ejineering college kholen
 In America it was said, we will give you religion, you give us business
 ek sanyasi is desh ke liye shiksha niti bana rahaa tha, taaki desh se nirdhantaa or agyaan dur ho sake
 Spirituality came very close to the world
 kanya kumari main samadhi main swami vivekananda ne apane liye do maarg dekhe the - jagdamba ke darshan, samadhi kaa sukh or apane liye moksh
 The second was the service of poor and afflicted children of Mother India
 unke liye bharatmata or jagdamba main koi antar hi nahin rah gaya tha
 He went to America to wash Kalima, who was raised on the face of Mother India by ascetic foreigners, and went to America to earn money and help the helpless poor of this country; Because he knew that the rich of this country are selfish and self-centered and the poor are incapable
 yah aitihaasik upanyaas eshavasyopanishad kii us ghoshnaa ko doharaata he ki aadhyatm kii upeksha kar keval sansar kii puja kar koi desh athwa samaaj prasann nahin rah saktaa; or na hi koi desh keval aadhyatm ko apana kar sansar kii purna upeksha kar apana vikaas kar apane liye sukh arjeet kar saktaa he
 Swami Vivekananda, while visiting India as a Parivrajak, told his disciples in Alwar that foreigners have written the history of India till date
 bharat kaa itihaas avyavasthit he
 The chronology in it is not accurate and accurate
 angarezon tathaa anya videshiyon dwaara likhaa gaya itihaas hamaare manobal ko todane ke liye hi he
 He will only make us weak
 ve hamen hamaare dosha hi bataate hai
 How can foreigners, who understand our customs, customs, our religion and philosophy very little, write their real and prehistoric history? That is why many misconceptions have gone home
 ab yah hamaare liye he ki ham apana swatantra maarg khojein
 Study your ancient texts, do research; And write a history that is pure, accurate, sympathetic and stimulates the soul
 aitihaasik upanyaas kii sarthakata keval us desh or kaal ke sander or aakarshak chithran maatr main nahin he
 He associates his era with an infinite and uninterrupted period and also has a definite rendition of his own
 uske abhaav main koi kriti mahatv praapt nahin kar sakati
 Yashpal's 'divya' was written to formulate a theory
 kintu usamen itihaas nahin, maatr aitihaasik parivesh he
 There is only an artistic sense of history, like Bhagwati Charan Varma's 'chitralekha'
 ve aitihaasik upanyaas nahin hai
 The artistic illusion of history has been generated just to speak there
 jeevani purnat: aitihaasik kriti he; kintu vah upanyaas nahin he
 Rungay Raghav has written historical biographies of many characters while staying very close to the novel
 jeevani or aitihaasik upanyaas main kya antar he ? or jivaniyaan uplabdh hon to kya upanyaas usase kuch adhik de saktaa he ? Historical novels can give a lot more than biography
 yadi aisa na hota to swami vivekananda kii jivaniyaan or unke bhaashan ityadi pard kar bhi pathak ko upanyaas se hi adhik tripti kyon milti ? upanyaas jeevani se adhik aitihaasik nahin hota
 can not be done
 phir bhi pathakon main upanyaas kii maang kyon he ? For example, Swami Vivekananda does not give any authentic biography of why his family had suddenly become so poor after his father's death
 jeevani bataati he ki unki bahanen thim kintu pita ke dehanth ke pashchaat pataa hi nahin chalata ki ve kahan gayi
 The biographer is writing a biography of Swamiji, so why would he discuss the marriage of his sisters? Swami ji got the news of suicide of his sister in Almora? These and hundreds of these types of questions remain unanswered in biographies
 jeevanikar kahata he ki swamiji ne ajitsingh se vedant kii charchaa kii
 Have serious discussions with Harvilas Sharda and Shyamakrishna Varma
 kintu vah yah nahin bataata ki ve charchaayen kya thim
 He does not reveal who the Lallu brothers who accompanied him to Chicago and where they became extinct after Boston
 kul mila kar jeevani main lekhak sab sthanon par upasthit he or keval suchnaayen de rahaa he
 He also searched
 upanyaaskaar us saare parivesh ko jeevant bana detaa he
 He fits into the mind of all the characters like God
 vah sab kahin vyaapt he, par dikhaai kahin nahin detaa
 He enters Parakaya
 apane charitron ko dur se nahin dekhtaa, unke saath tadatmya karata he
 That is what happens
 bhashaa kii drushti se bhi ye saare hi upanyaas bahut samarth or sabal hai
 The words of Hazariprasad Dwivedi reveal their own meaning
 ve katha sanaate hue bhi shabd vichaar karte chalate hai
 And the way Nagarji presents the dialect according to the characters - that is amazing
 unke yahan gramin kii avadhi, nagar kii avadhi, sushikshit pandit kii avadhi or anpadh kii avadhi, hindu kii avadhi or musalmaan kii avadhi kaa bhed, apane aap hi aap kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchne lagata he
 The biggest achievement of these novels is that in them, the reader of history does not feel unconnected or far away from himself
 ihalok or aadhyatm do virdohi avadharanaayen nahin rah jaatin
 Aranyak life and civil life do not remain unfamiliar with each other
 hamaara aitihaasik upanyaas ek lambii yatra tay kar aayaa he or kuch aise nishkarshon par pahunch rahaa he, jo hamaare samaaj ke liye siddhant maatr nahin hai
 It is his daily life
 vah unako ek samgr jeevandarshan de rahaa he, jo keval ihlokikta kaa varnan karne vaale saamaajik-sansaarik upanyaas nahin de sakate
 Yes ! He also expects a little bit of wisdom from the reader
 swami vivekananda ne kaha tha ki is desh ko apni swatantraaa ke liye bhi raajnneeti kii daldal main dhansane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If we get our satvik character then our problems will be solved on our own
