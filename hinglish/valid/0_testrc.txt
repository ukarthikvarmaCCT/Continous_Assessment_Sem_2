 Among the three types of cartilage, hyaline is usually called cartilage because there is mostly hyaline cartilage in the body

 padmavati yaa padmini chittod ke raja ratnasingh kii rani thi
 The historical existence of the name of this Rajput queen is very doubtful, and its historical existence has often been accepted as imaginary by historians
 is naam kaa mukhya strot malik mohammad jaaysi krit 'padmavat' naamak mahakavy he
 All the other historical sources or texts which describe 'padmavati' or 'padmini' are all successors of 'padmavat'
 itihaas granthon main adhiktar 'padmini' naam sweekaar kiya gaya he, jabaki jaaysi ne spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam sweekaar kiya he
 It is clear from Jaisi's description that he also means 'padmini' with the highest rank of women
 jaaysi ne spasht likhaa he ki raja gandharvasen kii solah hajaar padmini raniyaan thim, jinamein sarvshereshth rani champavati thi, jo ki pataraani thi
 Padmavati was born from this Champavati's womb
 is prakaar katha ke praathmik strot main hi spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam hi sweekrut hua he
 According to Jayasi, Padmavati was the daughter of King Gandharvasen of Sinhala Island, and Raja Ratan Sen of Chittor, disguised as a yogi, went there and married her after many years of effort and brought her to Chittor
 vah adwitiya sundari thi or ratansen ke dwaara niraadrit kavi-pandit-tantric raghav chetan ke dwaara uske rup kaa varnan sunakar dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittorgarh par akraman kar diya tha
 Even after 8 months of war, Alauddin Khilji could not conquer Chittor, then returned and after a second attack, he tricked King Ratansen with deceit and asked for Padmavati as a condition of returning him
 tab padmavati kii ore se bhi chal kaa sahaara liya gaya or gora-badal kii sahaayta se anek veeron ke saath vesh badalakar palakiyon main padmavati kii sakhiyon ke rup main jaakar raja ratansen ko mukt karaayaa gaya
 But as soon as this trick was detected, Alauddin Khilji launched a strong attack, in which almost all the Rajput warriors who went to Delhi were killed
 raja ratansen chittod lautaa parantu yahan aate hi unhen kumbhalaner par akraman karnaa padaa or kumbhalaner ke shaasha devpal ke saath yuddh main devpal maaraa gaya parantu raja ratansen bhi atyadhik ghayal hokar chittod lautaa or swarg sidhaar gaya
 There again Alauddin Khilji was attacked
 rani padmavati anya solah sau striyon ke saath johar karke bhasma ho gayi tathaa kile kaa dwaar khol kar ladate hue saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 Alauddin Khilji did not find anything other than ashes
 karnal tod ne apane rajasthan ke itihaas main jaaysi ke ukt kathanak main kuch her-pher ke saath praayah usee kahani ko doharaaya he
 Colonel Todd's description has remained historically very low mainly due to writing based on the stories of the Bhatas
 unhone raja ratnasingh yaa ratansen ke badale bhimasi kaa naam diya he or vah bhi vastutah rana nahin balki rana lakhamasi ke chachaa the jo ki lakshmana singh ke bachche hone ke kaaran shashan sambhaal rahe the
 Colonel Tod reckons the beginning of Bhimsingh's rule as Laxman Singh and his patron in 1275 AD; While it is well known that Alauddin Khilji was attacked in 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod ne padmini ko sinhal dweep ke chouhan vanshi hamir shankh kii ladki batalaaya he
 Except for these changes, the rest of the story is often Padmavat, with exceptions
 14 veen or 16 veen shatabdi ke bich jain granth- nabinandan jenudhar, chitai charitra or rain sehara ne rani padmini kaa ullekh kiya he
 Tejpal Singh Dhama has proved her the princess of Sri Lanka on the basis of texts published from Jaffna in her famous research novel Agni Ki Flames
 inaki kahani jaaysi ke padmavat se thodi alag he
 There has been considerable churn among historians for the attacks of Rani Padmini, Raja Ratnasinh and Alauddin Khilji
 is sandarbh main sarvaadhik uddhrut tathaa pramanbhoot mahamahopadhyaay rhibahadur gaurishankar hirachand ojha kaa mat mana gaya he
 In the context of the story of Padmavat, Ojha ji has clearly written that "in the absence of history, people have considered Padmavat as a historical book, but in reality it is a poetic tale of today's historical novels, whose body is composed on these historical things
 That Ratansen, the king of Chittor, Padmini or Padmavati was his queen and Alauddin was the Sultan of Delhi, who fought with Ratansen and took away the fort of Chittor
 bahudhaa anya sab baaten katha ko rochak banane ke liye kalpit khadi kii gai he; kyonki ratnasingh ek baras bhi rajya karne nahin paaya, aisi dasha main yogi ban kar us kii sinhaladweep tak janaa or vahaan kii rajkumaari ko byaah laana kaise sambhav ho saktaa he
 At that time, the king of Sinhala Dweep should not be Gandharvasen, but the king Kirtinishshank Dev should be Parakramabahu or Bhuvanak Bahu
 sinhaladweep main gandharvasen naam kaa koi raja hi nahin hua
 Kumbhalner was not even inhabited by that time, so how should Devpal be considered the king of there? After fighting for Chittor for 8 years, Alauddin did not return to Delhi disappointed but after fighting for six months, he had taken Chittor, he had climbed Chittor only once, so the story of the second coming is fictitious
 " Thus, it becomes clear that finding historicity in the legend of the epic Padmavat epic is meaningless to a great extent
 kuch naam aitihaasik avashya hai, parantu ghatnaayen adhikanshtah kalpit hi hai
 Some events which are historical are also related to 1531 AD rather than 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod kaa varnan bhi kaaphi had tak anaitihaasik hi he
 In this context, Ojha ji has a clear statement that "colonel Tod has written this story especially on the basis of the Bhatas of Mewar and the Bhats have taken him from 'padmavat'
 bhaaton kii pustakon main samar singh ke peeche ratnasingh kaa naam na hone se taad ne padmini kaa sambandh bhimsingh se milaayaa or use lakhamasi ke samay kii ghatana maan lee
 According to the statements of such Bhats, Tad also wrote Lakhmsi to be the child and the king of Mewar, but Lakhmsi was neither king of Mewar nor child, but was feudatory of Sisode and had reached old age at that time, because he To pay his salt with seven sons, he was killed while fighting in the battle with Alauddin as the head of Ratnasinha's army, as in Shilale of Kumbhalgarh of Vikram Samvat 1517
 Has been told above
 isi tarah bhimasi lakhamasi kaa chachaa nahin, kintu dada tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke 'eklingamahatmaya' main paaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, even Tad's statement cannot be credible
 'padmavat', 'tarikh phirishta' or taad ke rajasthan ke lekhon kii yadi koi jad he to keval yahi ki allaudin ne chittod par chadhaai kar chah maas ke ghere ke ananthar use vijay kiya; vahaan kaa raja ratnasingh is ladaai main lakshmanasingh aadi kai saamanto sahit maaraa gaya, uski raani padmini ne kai striyon sahit johar kii agni main pranahuti di; is prakaar chittod par thode-se samay ke liye musalamaanon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 Everything else is often imagined
 " The majority of the above quoted opinion of Ojha ji has been accepted by almost all historians
 dow0 laal ne bhi apni pustak 'history of the Khaljis, main likhaa he ki kahani ke paramparaagat varnan ko taak par rakhane ke pashchaat nagn satya yah he ki sultan allaudin ne 1303 isvi main chittod par akraman kiya or aath maah ke vikat sangharsh ke pashchaat use adhikrut kar liya
 The brave Rajput warriors stayed in the field fighting the invaders and the brave Rajput women were buried in the flame of Jauhar
 jo striyaan samadhisth huin, unamem sambhawatah ratnasingh kii ek rani bhi thi, jiskaa naam padmini tha
 Apart from these facts, everything else is a literary structure and there is no historical support for it
 isi prakaar kaa mat dow0 es0 el0 nagori evam jithesh nagori kaa bhi he
 It has been considered the first school of Chittor
 kaha jaataa he ki khilji ne kile par apni vijay pataakaa fahraakar vahaan ke 30,000 nagarikon ko maut ke ghat utaara
 Many historians have rejected both Padmini's name and existence; But after enough consideration, many historians like Dr
 Ashirwadi Lal Shrivastava and Dr
 Gopinath Sharma have accepted the existence of Padmini, considering many things in the story as unnatural, as expressed in the above opinion of Ojha ji
 dow0 gopinath sharma ne likhaa he ki "hamaare vichaar se yah maananaa kii padmini kii katha parampara jaaysi ke padmavat se aarambh hoti he vah sarvatha bhram he
 The Chitaicharit, which was written many years before Jayasi, describes the Chittor invasion of Padmini and Alauddin
 hemratan ke gora-badal chaupai main; tathaa labdhoday ke padmini charitra main is katha ko swatantra rup se likhaa gaya he
 


 This story has come in the form of a pure and healthy tradition according to a Rajput system, it is not right to reject it easily
 ho saktaa he ki kai baaten paath bhed se tathaa varnan style se vibhinn rup main prachlit rahi hon, kintu unka aadhaar satya se hatakar nahin dhundha ja saktaa
 The architecture testifies that there are palaces of Padmini in Chittor and that of Padmini Tal which still reminds of that elaborate and controversial woman
 padmini ke sambandh main di gayi sabhi ghatnaayen sambhavtah satya kii kasuti par thik nahin utren, kintu padmini kii vidyamanata, akraman ke samay uski sooyeeboojh, uske dwaara johar vrath kaa netritv aadi ghatnaon kaa ek swatantra mahatv he
 " vastutah allaudin khilji ke akraman evam yuddh kaa pramukh kaaran allaudin kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha evam chittod kii sainik evam vyapaarik upyogita thi
 The trade routes of Gujarat, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces, Sindh etc
 passed through Chittor
 swaabhaavik he ki allaudin khilji jaisaa sultan aise kshetra par avashya adhikaar praapt karnaa chahta
 There is no doubt that Alauddin's main intention for the Chittor invasion was political, but when he came to know about the beauty of Padmini, the desire to take him became more intense
 siddhant sambhaavna or sankhyikee main, swatantraaa kii degree ke saath kashmir chi-varg bantan kashmir swatantra maanak saamaanya yadrichhik char ke virgon kii raashi kaa vitaran he
 This is a special case of gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, eg in hypothesis testing or in constructing confidence intervals
 jab yah he adhik saamaanya chi-varg bantan se pratishthit kiya ja rahaa he, is vitaran kabhi kabhi kendriya chi-varg bantan kaha jaataa he
 The chi-squared distribution is used in common chi squared tests for the goodness of fit of an observed distribution for the standard deviation of a population, a theoretical one for the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data, and confidence interval estimation In the normal distribution from a sample standard deviation
 kai anya sankhyikeey pareekshan bhi kheme se vicharan ke fridman ke vishleshan kii tarah, is vitaran kaa upyog karen
 Wakes up at trial, among others
 aakasmikta talikaon main chi chuktaa swatantraaa kii kasuti kaalpanik vitaran karne ke liye manaaya data ke feet kii bhalaai ke kaai-varg pareekshan nested model ke liye sambhaavna anupaat pareekshan astitv ke vishleshan main pravesh karen rank pareekshan stareekrut aakasmikta talikaon ke liye kocharan-mental pareekshan yah bhi tii-vitaran or epa vitaran tii pareekshan, vicharan ke vishleshan main istemaal kiya, or pratigaman vishleshan kii paribhaasha kaa ek ghatak he
 The primary reason that chi-square distribution is used extensively in hypothesis testing is its relationship to the normal distribution
 kai pariklpana pareekshan is tarah ke ek tii pareekshan main tii aankadon ke rup main, ek pareekshan aankada kaa upyog karen
 For these hypothesis tests, as the sample size, n, increases, the sample distribution of the test statistic approaches the normal distribution
 kyonki pareekshan aankada acimtotic saamaanya rup se vitarit kiya jaataa he, basharte namoonay kaa aakaar paryaapt badi he, pariklpana pareekshan ke liye istemaal vitaran ek saamaanya vitaran iskaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Testing hypotheses using a normal distribution is well understood and relatively easy
 saralatam chi-varg bantan ek maanak saamaanya vitaran kaa varg he
 So wherever a normal distribution can be used for a hypothesis test, a chi-square distribution can be used
 vishesh rup se, lagata he ki jed ek maanak saamaanya yadrichhik char rahaa he, matlab ke saath = 0 or vicharan = 1
 jed ~ en 
 a sample drawn at random from z is a sample from the standard normal distribution shown in the graph
 ek nai yadrichhik char atarankit prashn ek yadrichhik namoona utpann karne ke liye paribhaashit karen, jed se ek namoona lene ke liye or mulya varg
 The distribution of squared values is given by the random variable q = Z2
 {
 \ Displaystyle \ q \ \ Sim \ \ Chi _ {1} ^ {2}} \ q \ \ Sim \ \ Chi _ {1}: An example of a chi-square distribution of the distribution of random variables q ^ {2 }
 sabscript 1 ingit karata he ki is vishesh chi-varg bantan keval 1 maanak saamaanya vitaran se nirmaan kiya he
 Extrapolate a standard normal distribution class ek atirikt kaaran yah he ki chi-varg bantan vyapak rup se istemaal kiya jaataa he ki yah sambhaavna anupaat pareekshan ke varg ke ek sadsy he elarti ke kai vaanchhneeya gun hote hai
 In particular, lrts generally provide the highest power to reject null hypotheses
 haalanki, saamaanya or chi chuktaa anumaanon hi maanya acimtotic hai
 For this reason, it is preferable to use the chi squared approximation for the normal approximation or small sample size instead of the t distribution
 isi tarah, aakasmikta talikaon kaa vishleshan main, chi chuktaa sanniktan chota sa namoona aakaar ke liye kharaab ho jayega, or yah fisher sateek pareekshan kaa upyog karne ke liye behatar he
 Ramsey and Ramsey show that the exact binomial test is always more powerful than the general approximation
 is vitaran pehle 1875-6 ke akhabaaron main german sankhyikeevid fredrick robert helmerat dwaara varnit kiya gaya tha, jahaan vah ek saamaanya jansankhya kaa namoona vicharan kaa namoona vitaran abhikalan
 Thus in German this was known as the traditional Helmerut or "helmerut" distribution "
 vitaran swatantra rup se feet he, jiske liye vah apane pearson kii kaai-varg pareekshan viksit kii he, 1900 main prakashit kii bhalaai ke sandarbh main angreji ganitagya karl pimmersan dwaara phir se khoj kii gai thi, main ekatra main prakashit mulyon kii gananaa kii mej ke saath
 The name "chi squared" eventually derives from Pearson's shorthand for the exponent in a multivariate normal distribution with the Greek letter chi, writing what appears in modern notation as -1⁄2xtς-1x -1⁄2χ2
 kii "chi chuktaa vitaran" ek parivaar kaa vichaar he, lekin nahin, pearson kii vajah se he, lekin 1920 ke dashak main fisher ke kaaran aage ke vikaas ke rup main paidaa hui
 By the central limit theorem, because the chi-square distribution is the sum of k independent random variables with finite mean and variance, it conveys for a normal distribution for large k
 kai vyaavhaarik prayojanon ke liye, kashmir ke liye> 50 vitaran paryaapt ke liye antar ko nazarandaaj kiya ja karne ke liye ek saamaanya vitaran ke kareeb he
 In particular, x ~ χ2, so as k goes to infinity, the distribution of { \ displaystyle / { \ sqrt {2k}}} / { \ sqrt {2k}} tends to a standard normal distribution
 haalanki, abhisaran dhimi he ke rup main vishmata he { \ displaystyle { \ sqrt {8 / kashmir}}} { \ sqrt {8 / kashmir}} or atirikt kurtosis / kashmir he
 Ln The sample distribution converges to much faster than the normal नमूना2 sample distribution, as the logarithm removes much of the asymmetry
 chi-varg bantan ke anya kaaryon main adhik teji se ek saamaanya vitaran ke liye ekagra

 isamen up-parmaanu paimaane par jo prakaash or up-parmanviya kanon main tarang-kan dvirup dekha jaataa he, uskaa ganit aadhaar sammilit he
 Quantum mechanics also includes the mathematical basis of the deep connection of energy and matter

 is prayog ne prakaash ke tarang siddhant ke saamaanya sweekruti main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai he
 Since its inception, many uncomfortable aspects and consequences of quantum mechanics have provoked philosophical debates and interpretations

 "according to Steven Weinberg," In my opinion no explanation of quantum mechanics is a completely satisfactory interpretation
 " The Copenhagen interpretation - that of large-scale Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr - is today most widely accepted among physicists, remains the method of quantum mechanical, which took place some 75 years after its representation

 satyagrah kaa shabdic arth satya ke liye aagrah karnaa hota he
 Satyagraha, until the beginning of the dissolution of the law to protect the rights of Indians in South Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the world was familiar with the "disarm weapon" or the strategy of passive resistance
 iskaa vajah keval kaale gore ke bich bhed bhav tha 
 If the power of the opposition is more than us, then there was no meaning of armed protest, they believed in non-violence, so they were fighting this battle
 sabal pratipakshi se bachane ke liye "ni:shastr pratikaar' kii yudhniti kaa avlamban kiya jaataa tha
 In England, women had adopted this "passive resistance" route to obtain suffrage
 is prakaar pratikaar main pratipakshi par shastr se akraman karne kii baat chhodkar use duusare har prakaar se tang karnaa, chal kapat se use haani pahunchaana, athwa uske shatru se sandhi karke use nicha dikhaanaa aadi uchit samajha jaataa tha
 Gandhiji did not like this kind of maladministration
 dakshin africa main unke andolan kii kaarypaddati bilkul bhinn thi unka sara darshan hi bhinn tha at: apni yudhniti ke liye unako nae shabd kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui
 To get the right word, he organized a competition in which the late Maganlal Gandhi suggested a word "sadagraha" in which Gandhiji accepted the word "satyagraha" by making a slight change
 america ke darshanik thoro ne jis civil disobidiens kii technic kaa varnan kiya he, "satyagrah' shabd us prakriya se miltaa julata tha
 The basic meaning of "satyagraha" is to urge the truth to hold the truth and to accept non-violence with it
 anyaay kaa sarvatha virodh karte hue anyaayi ke prati vairabhav na rakhana, satyagrah kaa mul lakshan he
 We should fearlessly follow the truth, and even while dying, we should not have rage or anger towards whom Satyagraha is against
 ' "satyagraha" has no place for violence against its adversary
 ve ahimsha vaadi the 
 With patience and sympathy, the opponent should be freed from his mistake, because what appears to be true to one, may appear wrong to the other
 dhairya kaa taatpary kshtsahan se he
 Hence the meaning of this principle is, "preserving the truth not by giving pain or pain to the opponent, but by suffering himself
" ' Mahatma Gandhi had said that a verse in Satyagraha is "love"
 satyagrah madhyampadlopi samaas he
 Satyagraha is the urge by love for truth
 gandhi ji ne lard inter ke saamne satyagrah kii sankshipt vyakhya is prakaar kii thi-"yah aisa andolan he jo puri tarah sachai par kaayam he or hinsa ke upayon ke evaj main chalaaya ja rahaa
 'ahimsa is the most important element of the Satyagraha philosophy, because the only way to reach the truth and stick to it is non-violence
 or gandhi ji ke hi shabdon main "ahimsa kisi ko chot na pahunchaane kii nakaaratmak vrittimaatr nahin he, balki vah sakriy prem kii vidhayak vritti he
 ' satyagrah main swayan ksht uthaane kii baat he
 Following the truth is a matter of death
 satya or ahimsa ke pujari ke shastraagaar main "upwas' sabase shaktishaalee shastr he
 Fasting is mandatory for anyone who does not take shelter of violence in some form
 mrityu paryant ksht sahan or isliye mrityu paryat upwas bhi, satyagrahi kaa antim astr he
 'but if fasting takes the form of self-compulsion to compel others, then it is worthless: Acharya Vinoba, who is called benign, gentle, benign Satyagraha, is the last place for fasting in that role
 "satyagrah' ek pratikaarapaddati hi nahin he, ek vishisht jeevanapaddati bhi he jiske mul main ahimsa, satya, aparigrah, astey, nirbhayata, brahrichary, sarvadharm sambhaav aadi ekadash vrath hai
 Whose personal life is not pure because of these fasts, he cannot be a true Satyagrahi
 isiilie vinoba in vraton ko "satyagrah nishtha' kehete hai
 There is as much difference between "satyagraha" and "disarmament Retaliation" as between North and South Pole
 ni:shastr pratikaar kii kalpana ek nirbal ke astr ke rup main kii gai he or usamen apane uddeshy kii siddhi ke liye hinsa kaa upyog varjit nahin he, jabaki satyagrah kii kalpana param shur ke astr ke rup main kii gai he or isamen kisi bhi rup main hinsa ke prayog ke liye sthaan nahin he
 Thus Satyagraha is not a passive state
 vah prabal sakriyata kii sthiti he
 Satyagraha is non-violent retaliation, but it is not passive
 anyaayi or anyaay ke prati pratikaar kaa prashn sanathan he
 In the development of its civilization, man has mainly adopted four methods for retaliation- pehali paddati he buraai ke badale adhik buraai
 Dandaneti was born by this method, when it attempted to solve the problems of society and nation, the institution of war developed
 duusari paddati he, buraai ke badale samaan buraai arthath aparaadh kaa uchit dand diya jaae, adhi nahin
 This is an attempt to limit undue retribution
 teesri paddati he, buraai ke badale bhalaai
 It is the path of saints like Buddha, Jesus, Gandhi etc
 isamen hinsa ke badale ahimsa kaa tatv antarnihit he
 The fourth method is to ignore evil
 acharya vinoba kehete hai- "buraai kaa pratikaar mat karo balki virdohi kii samuchit chintan main sahaayta karo
 Support him in good faith
 shuddh vichaar karne, sochane samajhane, vyaktigat jivan main uskaa amal karne or dusron ko samajhane main hi hamaare lakshya kii purti honi chahie
 Helping in proper thinking of the front is the true form of Satyagraha
 ' ise hi vinoba satyagrah ko saumytar or saumyatam prakriya kehete hai
 Satyagraha is a process of love
 use kram-kram, adhikadhik nikharate janaa chahie
 Satyagraha is nothing new, family life is only spread in political life
 gandhi ji kii dein yah he ki unhone satyagrah ke vichaar kaa raajnneetik jivan main samuhik prayog kiya
 It is said
 loktantr main, jahaan sara kaam "lok' kii raay se, lokpratinidhiyon ke madhyam se chal rahaa he, satyagrah ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Vinoba says - Actually the need for collective satyagraha will not be in the system in which the decision will be by consensus, not by majority
 parantu us dasha main bhi vyaktigat satyagrah padosi ke samyak chintan main sahakaar ke liye to ho hi saktaa he
 But in a democracy, when there is full opportunity for freedom and thought, Satyagraha should not take the form of "pressure, siege or closure" of some kind
 aisa hua to satyagrah kii saumyata nasht ho jaaegi
 Satyagrahi will be disinherited from his religion
 aaj duniya ke vibhinn konon main satyagrah evam ahimsak pratikaar ke prayog nirantar chal rahe hai
 In the Second World War, thousands of anti-war moneylenders' have gone to jails instead of enlisting in the army
 batrrend rasel jaise darshanik yudhvirohi satyagrahon ke kaaran jail ke sikhchon ke peeche band hue the
 Thousands of pacifists demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons by walking 60 miles annually from Alder Maston to London
 nigro netaa martin luther king ke balidaan kii kahani satyagrah sangram kii amar gaatha ban gai he
 The story of the Satyagraha of Danilo Dolchi, Italy, does not irrigate anyone
 ye saare prayaas bhale hi satyagrah kii kasuti par khare na utarate hon, parantu ye shanti or ahimsa kii disha main ek kadam avashya hai
 Regarding how the form of Satyagraha will take place in international conflict, Acharya Vinoba says - Suppose, if the invader enters our village, then i will say that you come with love - we will go to meet them, not afraid
 parantu ve koi galat kaam karana chaahate he to ham unase kahenge, ham yah baat maan nahin sakate hai-chaahe tum hamen samaapt kar do
 This form of Satyagraha has not yet been used to solve international problems
 parantu yadi anuyug kii vibheeshikaa se maanav samskruti kii raksha ke liye, hinsa kii shakti ko apdasth karke ahimsa kii shakti ko pratishthit hona he, to satyagrah ke is maarg ke atirikt pratikaar kaa doosraa maarg nahin he
 Weapons cannot be counteracted by weapons in this nuclear age
 magar aaj kaa yug kaha se kaha pahuch gaya he wo ye sab par bilkul bhi bharosha nahin kaary he 
 In America, it is said that "if one of you slaps, then you are crucified with it" Well, it is also a matter of encouragement to Sir Sir Hinsha and our Gandhiji used to say "if one slap, the other Give cheek, they will sing themselves tamater Adarsh aham: The type of person we would like to be
 ise ahmaadarsh yaa adarshikrut aatm ̄bab bhi kaha jaataa he
 Ahamadarsha or ideal ego is the inner image of a person who wishes to be himself

 is asthaayee nivaaskaal main vibhinn kabeelon main mitrataa tathaa shatruta kii asankhya ghatnaayen ghatit hoti thim
 Therefore, whenever they passed through that place for the second time, the overview of past memories became natural
 at: un bhagnavsheshon ko dekhte hi kavi kii ankhon ke saamne pichhali ghatnaon ke chitra aa jate the or vah apni prem kii ghatnaon tathaa viyog kii avasthaaon kaa varnan swat: karne lagata tha
 In this regard, he used to present a beautiful picture of the beauty and temperament characteristics of his girlfriend
 phir maano vah apni yatra dobaaraa aarambh kar detaa tha or retili pahadiyon, tilon tathaa anya prakritik drishyon ke varnan main leen ho jaataa tha
 At the same time, he used to admire his horse or his camel gait, deed and tolerance
 uski shuturamurg, junglee bail yaa duusare pashu se upama detaa tha or apni yatra evam bhraman tathaa yuddh evam markat kaa varnan karata tha
 After that he used to describe his and the great work of the clan with great pride
 tatpashchaat yadi koi vishesh uddeshy uske samaksh hota tha to vah uskaa bhi varnan karata tha
 Thus, these are the parts of an ode which do not have any deep attachment and strong relationship
 vah vibhijh prakaar ke chote bade motiyon ke haar ke samaan hota he jisamen ke kuch moti badi sugamawa se nikaalkar duusare haaron main piroe ja sakate hai
 The major feature of this era's poem is that it is very close to reality
 kaviyon ne jo kuch varnan kiya he vah unka yatharth anubhav tathaa nirikshan he
 Therefore, in this connection, it is a legend that 'al-sher Diwanul Arab' means poetry of Arabia
 prakat he ki is kavita kaa arab ke pracheen itihaas ke nirmaan main mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 Some of the famous famous poets of that period are - imroul-qais, Zuhair, Tarafah, Labid, amr-bin-kulsoom, Antarah, Nabigha, Haris bin Hilizza and Ayesha
 uchit uttaradhikarikal tathaa umaiyyakaal 
 After the rise of Islam, for some time there was a lot of relaxation in the field of poetry, because the Arabs concentrated completely on the Islamic revolution
 unka utsaah dharm ke prachaar tathaa deshon kii vijay main lag gaya
 His enthusiasm for poetry was reflected in the promotion of religion and the conquest of countries
 kavita ke prati unki upeksha kaa ek bada kaaran yah bhi hua ki ab tak jo vastuen unako vishesh rup se prerit karanevaali thim--jaise jaateey pakshpaat, gotreey gaurav, doshaaropan evam ghrinaa, ahankaar, markat, madhpan, dyutakrida ityadi-un sabko islam ne nishiddh ghoshit kar diya tha
 From this, the subject of the short poems of the early times of Islam is different from the poems of the 'era of Jahalat'
 inamen islam ke virodhiyon kii buraai kii gai he or rasulullah kii prashansa tathaa islam kaa samarthan hua he
 Reflections of the principles and ideologies of Islam are also visible in sufficient quantity
 is kaal ke kaviyon main hassaan-bin-sabit kaa naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 After Rasulullah, the same stage of poetry remained in the proper-heir-era
 aapke chaaron uttaradhikari, vidvan evam samast mahanubhav islam dharm ke siddhanton ke prachaar tathaa jansadharan ke aacharan-sudhaar main jute rahe
 He did not pay any special attention to the poem
 phir jab san 661 i
 main umaiyya vansh kaa raaj damishq main sthapit hua to kuch aisi paristhitiyaan upasthit hui ki purana jaateey pakshpaat phir jaagrath ho gaya
 Numerous political parties rose up and became badly entangled with each other
 prayetk dal ne kavita ke shastr kaa prayog kiya or kaviyon ko apni ichhaapoorti kaa saadhan banaaya
 As a result, the poetry market once again became hot
 parantu isaki saamaanya style lagbhag vahi thi jo jahaalat ke yug kii kavitaaon kii thi
 It is so important that some sweetness and poise is seen in the language and description
 is kaal kaa prayek kavi kisi-na-kisi dal kaa samarthak tha jisaki prashansa main vah apni puri kavitvsakti arpit kar detaa tha
 At the same time, he did not put any effort in blaming the opponents
 isliye is kaal kii adhikansh kavitaaon ke varnya prashansa evam doshaaropan par aadhaarit hai
 Akhtal is counted among the first-class poets
 is yug kii ek vichitrataa farajdaq or jareer kii parsparik kavitapratidwandvita bhi he jo itani prasiddh thi ki yudhakshetra main sainik bhi inhen dinon kii kavita se sambandhit vadavivaad kiya karte the
 On the other hand there was a prevalence of Ghazaliyah Shayari especially in Arabia in which the name of umar-bin-abi Rabia is very famous
 kuch premi kavi bhi bahut prasiddh he; jaise jameel, jo busaina kaa premi tha or majanu jo laila kaa premi tha
 His poems are full of sensations and events of beauty and love and the experiences and conditions of accidental disconnection and in them there is also a sufficient amount of sensation, effect, beauty, sweetness, grace and amusement
 yah kaal prayek drushtikon se swarnyug kahalaane kaa adhikari he
 In this, every kind of advancement reached its peak
 calipha se lekar jansadharan tak sab vidya tathaa kalakaushal ko unnat banane main tan man se lage hue the
 In addition to the Baghdad capital, there were innumerable educational centers in the vast Islamic state, which were competing with each other for the advancement of learning and art skills
 is samupyukt vaataavaran ke falswaroop kavita kaa udyaan bhi lahalhane laga
 With the advancement of civilization and culture and the combination of other castes and languages, new ideologies and new words and phrases began to find place in poetry
 vichaaron main gambhirtha evam baariki or shabdon main pravaah evam maadhurya aane laga
 Various narrative styles were extracted and various methods of praise and accusations were taken out in which exaggeration was taken to the extreme
 is kshetra ke yoddhaon main abu tammam, bahuturi or muthanbbi agrani the
 Apart from this, by breaking the boundaries and restrictions, the poetry area was further expanded and various routes were drawn in it
 ek ore prem or aasakti kii ghatnaon or phakamaston ke varnan nixsancoach kiye gaye
 The poet of this direction was the poet Abunuvas
 duusari ore virakti, pavitrataa or upadesh kii dharaayen pravaahit hui
 Abul Atahiya was the first in this area
 isi prakaar abul alaa alorro ne maanavtaa ke vibhinn angon par darshanik dhang se prakaash daalaa or ibrul fariz ne aadhyatmikta ke vayumandal main udaan bhari
 The description of Arabic poetry of Spain is also particularly desired here
 vahaan musalamaanon kaa raaj lagbhag 800 varsh rahaa
 Meanwhile, Vidya and Kalakaushal made such progress there that Europe was surprised by seeing them for centuries
 yahan kii arabi kavita bhi prarambh main pracheen mohammad-purv yug kii kavita ke dhang par chali, parantu sheeghra hi sthaneey jalwaayu ne saundarya praapt hua
 It has two characteristics: one is a captivating description of natural scenery; The charming story of other loves
 iske atirikt ek vishesh baat yah he ki yahan lokbhasha main ek nai prakaar kii kavita ne praudhata praapt kar raja-rank sabakaa man har liya
 The particle of Spain was moved by its ragas
 vahaan ke prasiddh kaviyon main ibre haani or ibre jadoon vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 In this period, Arabic prose also progressed a lot
 prarambh main ibrul mukafafaa ne duusari bhashaaon kii kuch pustakon kaa arabi main anuwaad kiya jinamein kalolah va dimana bahut prasiddh hai
 Then ancient story stories were quickly compiled into books
 ek ore to katha kahaniyon par lekhanshkti kaa prayog kiya gaya or manoranjak gyaan ko chittkarshak style main prastut kiya gaya
 The name of Aliphalla is very famous in this regard, which is a collection of hundreds of different stories
 duusari ore khalifaaon, mahapurushon, kaviyon, sahityakaron or vidwaanon ke parichay, sadachaar, shishtachar, dantakthaon, kala-kaushal aadi ke varnan ekatra kiye gaye
 The famous emperor of this region was Zahiz
 inke pashchaat is kshetra main sakriy bhaag lenevaalon main ibrai kutaibah, ibre abde rabbi or abul faraj asfahani adhik prasiddh hai
 His books have a very high place in Arabic literature
 is kaal ke saahitiyik lekhon main tukant gadhy ko bhi adhik khyaati praapt hui or uskaa mahatv itnaa bad gaya ki use ucch koti ke gadhy kaa atyaavashyak ang mana jane laga
 In the end, it reached its climax in terms of progress, and the reality is that in the opinion of many litterateurs, a much higher level of literature had not yet come into existence
 maqaamaat kaa centre vidooshak nayak hota he or uski style naatakeey hoti he
 Each makamah is a literary collection in which the protagonist, by his knowledgeable narratives and literary humor and humor, defeats all his rivals completely and surprises the audience
 usamen kathavstu kuch nahin hoti, keval saahitiyik atishyokti tathaa varnanstyli kaa chamatkaar hi sab kuch hota he
 Badiuzmaan Hamdani and later Hariri shine like the moon-sun in the sky of this period of Arabic literature
 iske atirikt asankhya vidyaon evam kalaon, jaise tafasir haddees, qikah, itihaas, nirukt, mantik, darshan, jyotish, bhumiti, ganit ityadi ke kshetra main sahasron aise vidwaanon ne kaary kiya
 There is a valuable collection of knowledge in his numerous works and hundreds of books are counted in high quality knowledge and literary works
 inase aaj tak vidvan laabh uthaate or unke samudr main dubkee lagaakar bahumoolya moti nikaalte rahe hai
 Nevertheless, a large part of his store is still unknown and unseen in terms of the world, which invites the students of academia and art to explore and work diligently
 baghdad kaa rajya abbasi rajtvkaal se hi patanonmukh ho chukaa tha
 Now in this era, it was torn to pieces
 mughalon, turkon or duusari jatiyon main prabhutta vibhajit ho gai
 The impact of political revolution was also inevitable
 at: is lambey samay main gyaan evam sahitya main koi pragati nahin hui
 The poem was truly lifeless
 kavi keval shabdic krida main leen the
 Originality was not known
 pracheen vishyon tathaa vichaaron kaa pishtapeshan ho rahaa tha
 Albuciiri undoubtedly gained much fame in poetry, the basis of which is in particular the verse he wrote in honor of Rasulullah
 iske atirikt safiuddin hilli kaa naam bhi bahut vikhyath he jise is kaal kaa sabase bada kavi kaha ja saktaa he
 Undoubtedly history writing progressed progressively during this period
 is kaal ke aitihaasik kaaryon main vistrut drushtikon or yatharthpriyata ke chihn paryaapt maatra main milte hai
 Ibre Khaldun's name is most famous in this regard, which heralded a new genre in historiography
 usne apane itihaas kii bhoomika main bahut si gyaan sambandhi, raajnneetik or saamaajik samasyaon kaa bahut sundar varnan kiya he or itihaas kaa ek vistrut darshanik drushtikon upasthit kiya he
 Hence the importance of that role is more than an independent book
 baad ke europea itihaaskaar maikiyavali, viko or giban ityadi vastav main ibre khaldoon ke hi anuyaayi hai
 There are some scholars in this period who were equally proficient in many disciplines and arts
 isliye unke vyaktitv ko kisi ek kshetra main simit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Ibre Taimiyyah, Zahbi, Ibrehzar Askalani and Jalaluddin Suyuti are such scholars
 yah mandal is kaal ke prakashahin akaash main jugnu kii bhanti chamak rahaa he
 In his hundreds of works, there is a repository of all kinds of knowledge and arts
 inke atirikt ibre manjuur vyakaran, nirukt or sahitya kaa bahut bada vidvan ore anveshak hua he
 'nisanul Arab' is his magnum opus, which is counted in dictionaries and top books of literature
 yah arabi sahitya kaa punarjagarankaal he jiskaa prarambh misr par napolian ke akraman se hota he
 During this period some such causes and circumstances arose that a new wave of life in Arabic literature ran and new branches broke out in it
 pashchimi samskruti van sabhyataa, gyaan evam sahitya or vichaardhaara evam drushtikon ne arab desh ko bahut prabhavit kiya
 Schools of modern style began, invention of printing and promotion of magazines and newspapers
 gyaan sambandhi saahitiyik sansthaayen sthapit hui
 In this way the Arab caste became acquainted with new trends and attitudes
 swatantraaa, deshbhakti tathaa rashtriyata kii bhavanaayen jaagrath huir
 Political and social ideologies also changed
 falswaroop arabi sahitya main ek kranti kaa janm hua
 Kavita changed sides
 usamen jivan ke chihn drushtigochar hone lage
 In place of the literal miracle, more attention was paid to the subject
 raajnneetik kavitaayen evam rashtriya gaan likhe jane lage
 Poems in other languages were translated into Arabic
 at: urdu ke gauravanvit kavi allamaa iqbaal kii kavitaaon kaa bhi anuwaad hua
 Additionally the criteria of the poem also changed
 kuch kaviyon ne svachhand kavitaayen bhi likhin or pracheen style ke viruddh ek-ek vishay par thos kavitaaon kii rachana hui
 The names of the specific poets of this period are: Al Barudi, Hafiz Ibrahim, Shouki, Rusafi, Khalil Matran, Abushadi, Abdurrahman Sidki, Abdurrahman Badvi and Suleiman al Isa
 aadhunik yug main padya kii apeksha gadhy par adhik jor diya gaya or usamen sahitya ke anya angon kii abhivruddhi kii gai
 Maroon Nakash introduced drama in Arabic literature
 kuch samay pashchaat abdulla nadeem or najeeb-al-haddad ne is ore dhyaan diya
 Then soon dramatics made so much progress that nowadays it is counted as an important part of higher literature
 isi prakaar upanyaason or sankshipt kahaniyon ko bhi manyata praapt hui
 Earlier all kinds of historical, social, love and humor stories from the languages of Europe were adapted into Arabic
 tatpashchaat is vishay kii moulik rachanaayen bhi sahityakshetra main aane lageen jinase pracheen arabi sabhyataa ko pranavan banane or rashtriya bhaawanaaon ko jaagrath karne kaa kaam liya gaya
 The distinguished persons of this region are Abdulqadir Mazini, Muhammad Hussain Hackl, Mahmud Timur, taufiq-al-hakim, Muhammad Farid, Abu Hadid, Ehsan Abdul and Aziz Abazah
 ucch koti ke sahityakaron main al manafalooti kaa naam bahut prasiddh he
 He is the sole occupant of a distinctive style
 samaaj kii avyavasthit dashaon or jivan ke apriy katu anubhavon kaa usne jo sundar chithran kiy he vah usee kaa bhaag he
 Khalil Gibran has also presented a beautiful literature
 is kaal kaa sabase bada lekhak nihsandeh mustafa sadiq he jisaki pustak bahulakalam atyant mahatvapurn kriti he
 In the modern period, special attention was also paid to history and criticism
 pracheen gyaan sambandhi or saahitiyik poonji kaa vartmaan siddhanton ke prakaash main pareekshan karne kaa kaam shighratapurvak ho rahaa he
 Doctors Taha Hussein, al-zayyad and al-akkad, etc
 are very high-quality writers, thinkers and critics
 in logon ne islamic sabhyataa, sahitya ke itihaas, tathaa gyaan or sahitya ke anya angon se sambandhit vartmaan style ke anukaranswaroop bahut sundar kritiyaan prastut kin
 Two approaches are found directly between the writers and critics of the present period
 kuch to pracheen style ke paksh main hai
 They want to take full advantage of all the knowledge and literary wealth of the West and from modern trends and perspectives, as well as to keep their ancient principles, ethnic traditions and dignity stable and vice versa, to make some Arabic literature completely Western ideology and narrative style Want to shield ve kisi pracheen baat ko us samay tak maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai jab tak vah vartmaan vichaardharake maapdand par puri na utar jaae
 In this way Arabic literature has benefited in various ways from the rise of different thinking institutions and mutual competition and conflicts
 at: vah apane kshetra ko uttarottar vistrut karata hua shighratapurvak aage badhata ja rahaa he or pratidin mahatvapurn saamagree prastut kar rahaa he jisase uski mahima or sthaayee astitv ke lakshan parilakshith hote hai

 In this article the word compiler is used for aggregator, but keep in mind that it is not a standard term
 jis sindicated masaude ko sankalak grahan karata he vah saamanytah aresas yaa anya kisi kshamal praaroop jaise ardf yaa atom main muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 The compiler saves the time and labor spent on locating new content on websites, and in a way makes it a personal newspaper for the reader to present

 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters are the type of file identified
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable

 When the computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations where the files can be lost
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions

 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4

 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind

 aa Swami Virjanand, a Sanskrit scholar, Vedic guru and Guru of Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 inako mathura ke andhe guru ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 He was born in the Mohyal Dutt family in Kartarpur, Punjab in 1778 AD
 inkaa bachapan kaa naam - vruj laal tha
 At the age of five, he became completely blind due to smallpox
 12wein saal main maan-baap chal based or bhai-bhabhi ke sangrakshan main kuch din gujaarne ke baad ye ghar se vidyadhyayan ke liye nikal pade
 After wandering here for some time, he came to Rishikesh, known as a spiritual city, and after staying in Rishikesh for some time, with the inspiration of someone, these Haridwar started living in an ashram
 vahaan ye swami purnanand se mili
 Purnanand introduced him to Vedic grammar and Aarasha Shastras
 iske baad ve sanskrit vidwaanon ke liye prasiddh kaashi aae jahaan 10 saalon tak unhone 6 darshanon tathaa ayurvedadi granthon kaa adhyayan kiya
 This was followed by Gaya where the comparative study of the Upanishads continued
 yahan se ve kalakatta gaye jahaan apane sanskrit gyaan ke liye unhe prashansa mili
 After this he came to Alwar on invitation and here he composed the word-comprehension book
 isaki mul prati ab bhi vahaan ke sangrahalay main rakhi he
 After this he stayed in Mathura where he established the school
 isamen desh bhar se sanskrit jigyaasu aae or rajputon kii taraf se daan bhi mili
 Around this time, Swami Dayanand Saraswati ji left the family in search of the true Guru with a desire to know the truth
 bharat ke anek sthanon kaa bhraman karte hue ve san 1860 main guruvar swami virajanand ke ashram main pahunche
 Where he got new vision, inspiration and self-power
 varshon tak bhraman karne ke baad jab ve bhagwaan shrikrishna kii janmasthali mathura main guru virajanand ji kii kutiyaa par pahunche to guru virajanand ne unase poocha ki ve koun hai
 Then Swami Dayanand said, "guru, i want to know who i really am
" Satisfied with the answer to the question, Guruwar made Dayanand his disciple
 swami virajanand ucch koti ke vidwaan the, unhone veda mantron ko nai drushti se dekha tha or vedon ko ek naveen vyavastha pradaan kii thi
 He made Dayanandji practice the Vedas
 adhyayan puraa hone ke baad jab dayanand ji guru virajanand ji ko guru dakshina ke rup main thodi se laung, jo guru ji ko bahut pasand thi lekar gayi to guru ji ne aisi dakshina lene se manaa kar diya
 He told Dayanand that as Guru Dakshina, i want to end the blind faith and evil practices in the society
 guru ji ke aadesh ke anusaar swami dayanand saraswati ji ne bharat ke saamaajik, saanskrithik or rajnatik utthan main apana mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 In his memory, a memorial was built on Grand Trunk Road of Kartarpur, the foundation stone of which was laid by Shri Badrinath Arya
 14 sitambar 1971 ko dak vibhaag ne inaki smriti main ek tikat bhi jari kiya
 The contribution of the Arya Samaj in the freedom movement and the Vedic revival has been highly acclaimed and its founder Dayanand ji got it from Gyan Swami Virjanand therefore his contribution in modern India needs to be further appreciated
 darshanashastra vah gyaan he jo param satya or prakruti ke siddhanton or unke kaarnon kii vivechna karata he
 Philosophy is an approach to test reality
 darshanik chintan multah jivan kii arthvatta kii khoj kaa paryaay he
 In fact, philosophy is the science of self, that is, nature and society, and the general rules of the process of human thought and cognition
 darshanashastra saamaajik chetana ke roopon main se ek he
 Philosophy is the name of the discipline that seeks truth and knowledge
 vyapak arth main darshan, tarkpurna, vidhipurvak evam krambaddh vichaar kii kala he
 It is born according to experience and situation
 yahi kaaran he ki sansar ke bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon ne samay-samay par apane-apane anubhavon evam paristhitiyon ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jivan-darshan ko apanaaya
 The history of Indian philosophy is very old, but in the sense of philosophy, the term philosophy was first used by Pythagoras
 vishisht anushaasan or vigyaan ke rup main darshan ko plato ne viksit kiya tha
 It originated as a science in the slave-master society, which had united the gross sum of human knowledge about the objective world and itself
 yah maanav itihaas ke aarambhik sopanon main gyaan ke vikaas ke nimna str ke kaaran sarvatha swaabhaavik tha
 In the process of development of social production and accumulation of scientific knowledge, different sciences got separated from philosophy and philosophy started developing as an independent science
 jagat ke vishay main saamaanya drushtikon kaa vistaar karne tathaa saamaanya aadhaaron va niyamon kaa karne, yatharth ke vishay main chintan kii tarkbuddhiparak, tark tathaa sangyaan ke siddhant viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa se darshanashastra kaa ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main janm hua
 The fundamental question of philosophy as a separate science is the problem of contemplation with self, the relation of consciousness with ghosts
 darshan vibhinn vishyon kaa vishleshan he 
 Therefore, the philosophy of consciousness is indispensable in Indian philosophy, which is not in modern philosophy
 maanav jivan kaa charam lakshya dukhon se chhutkaaraa praapt karke chir anand kii prapti he
 The same goal of Indian philosophies is to liberate the human from ignorance from the root cause of suffering and attain salvation
 yani agyaan va paramparawaadi or roodhiwaadee vichaaron ko nasht karke satya gyaan ko praapt karnaa hi jivan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 There has been a tendency for curiosity and exploration in humans since time immemorial
 prakruti ke udbhav tathaa surya, chandra or grahon kii sthiti ke alaava paramatma ke bare main bhi jaanane kii jigyaasa maanav main rahi he
 It is the result of his relentless efforts to eradicate these curiosities that we are living in such a developed society
 parantu pracheen rishi-muniyon ko is bhautik samruddhi se na to santosh hua or na chir anand kii prapti hi hui
 Therefore, in order to attain this truth and knowledge, he started searching for knowledge through subtle and subtle means and he also got success in it
 usee satya gyaan kaa naam darshan he
 Dishtehyeneti darshanam arthath asat evam sat padaarthon kaa gyaan hi darshan he
 The term Western Philosophy is derived from Philos + Sophia
 isliye philosphy kaa shabdic arth he buddhi prem
 The Western philosopher wants to become a wise or intelligent person
 paashchaatya darshan ke itihaas se yah baat jhalak jaati he ki paashchaatya darshanik ne vishay gyaan ke aadhaar par hi budhimaan hona chaha he
 Some examples will be found to the contrary in which it is also found ideal to conduct interviews with Paramasta on the basis of conduct purification and precision of mind
 parantu yah adarsh praachya he na ki paashchaatya
 The Western philosopher insists on his knowledge and does not consider it mandatory to conduct his character according to his knowledge
 keval paashchaatya rahasywaadee or samadhivaadi vichaarak hi iske apwaad hai
 Darshan is another name to be interviewed with supreme authority in Indian philosophy
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar manushya ko param satta kaa saakshaat gyaan ho saktaa he
 In this way, the path of devotional knowledge and yoga are explained for the interview
 parantu darshanik gyaan ko vaigyanik gyaan se bhinn kaha gaya he
 In acquiring scientific knowledge, the subject of change has to be changed so that it can be subdued according to its will and then its intended use can be done
 parantu praachya darshan ke anusaar darshanik gyaan jivan sadhana he
 Such a philosophy changes the philosopher himself
 use divya drushti praapt ho jaati he
 By which he sees all beings with his macro vision
 samasamyik vichaardhaara main praachya darshan ko dharm-darshan mana jaataa he or paashchaatya darshan ko bhashaa sudhaar tathaa pratyayon kaa spashtikaran kaha jaataa he Philosophy is the interpretation of experience
 is vyakhya main jo kuch aspasht hota he, use spasht karne kaa ytn kiya jaataa he
 Our knowledge centers open outwards, we often dissolve in the external world
 kabhi kabhi hamaara dhyaan antarmukh hota he or ham ek nae lok kaa darshan karte hai
 As soon as the facts are visible, moral sense also commands
 vaastaviktaa or sambhaavna kaa bhed adarsh ke pratyay ko vyakt karata he
 Under the influence of this suffix we look upwards
 is tarah darshan ke pramukh vishay bahya jagat, chetan aatma or paramatma ban jate hai
 While considering them, we naturally consider their relationship
 pracheen kaal main rachana or rachayita kaa sambandh pramukh vishay tha, madhyakaal main aatma or paramatma kaa sambandh pramukh vishay bana or aadhunik kaal main purush or prakruti, vishayi or vishay, kaa sambandh viven kaa centre bana
 Physics, logic and policy in ancient Greece, these three were considered three parts of philosophy
 bhautikee baahar kii ore dekhati he, tark swayan chintan ko chintan kaa vishay banaata he, niti jaananaa chaahati he ki jivan ko vyavasthit karne ke liye koi nirpeksh aadesh gyaat ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The main questions in philosophy are- 1
 gyaan ke atirikt gyaata or gyey kaa bhi astitv he yaa nahin? 2
 What is the nature of final power? Is it one type, or more than one type? pracheen kaal main niti kaa pramukh lakshya ni:shreyas ke swaroop ko samajhnaa tha
 In modern times, Kant replaced the suffix of duty as the fundamental suffix
 tripti yaa prasannataa kaa moolyankan vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- 1
 gyaan kya he? 2
 Is there a possibility of knowledge or not? 3
 gyaan praapt kaise hota he? 4
 What are the limitations of human knowledge? gyanamimasaa ne aadhunik kaal main vichaarkon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 Earlier philosophy was often taken in the sense of philosophy
 darshanikon kaa lakshya samgr kii vyavastha kaa pataa lagaana tha
 Whenever it seemed that human intelligence could not go further in this investigation, then some secondary principles became the subject of discussion
 yunaan main, sucraat, plato or arestu ke baad tathaa germany main kaant or hegal ke baad aisa hua
 Realism and skepticism are such theories
 is tarah darshanik vivechan main jin vishyon par vishesh rup se vichaar hota rahaa he, ve ye hai- the main topic - gaun vishay - Thinkers have viewed these subjects from various sides according to their own interests
 kisi ne ek paksh par vishesh dhyaan diya he, kisi ne duusare paksh par
 Sub-problems are present below each problem

 Although all philosophy originated from the Vedas, yet the whole of Indian philosophy has been divided into two parts, the believer and the atheist
 jo ishwar tathaa vedokt baton jaise nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga, mimasaa or vedant par vishwaas karata he, use aastik mana jaataa he; jo nahin karata vah naastik he
 The Vedic tradition has 6 philosophies: mimasaa nyaay vaisheshik sankhya yoga veydant This philosophy gives knowledge of paravidya, which is beyond the reach of words, from different perspectives
 prayek darshan main anya darshan ho sakate hai, jaise veydant main kai mat hai

 Sappho was an ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos
 saafo kii kavita pragitak kavita thi, or use pyaar ke bare main apni kavitaayen ke liye sabase adhik janaa jaataa he
 Most of his poems are now lost, and those remaining are also found in fragmented form

 Very little is known about Sappho's life

 Sappho's poetry was well known and highly praised for much of ancient times and was considered among the nine pre-eminent poets considered prominent by prominent scholars of Hellenistic Allegandria
 aaj bhi Sappho kii kavita ko asaadhaaran mana jaataa he, or uske kaam ne anya lekhakon ko aaj tak prabhavit karnaa jari rakhaa he
 Outside of academic circles, he is perhaps best known as a symbol of desire for the same sex, especially among women
 aaj, saafo mahila samalangikta kaa pratik he; aam shabd lesbian saafo ke liye ek sanket he
 However, he was not always considered so
 shastreey athinian kamedi main Sappho ko ek anek sambandh rakhane vaali vishamalangik aurat ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha, or yah helenistic daur main jaakar huya ki pehali gwahien sangrakshit rah pai jo spasht Sappho kii homo kaamuktha kii charchaa karti hai
 However, these ancient writers do not believe that Sappho actually had sexual relations with other women, and in the late tenth century, Suda records that Sapph was "accused of defaming her
" That he had sexual relations with his "female pupils"
