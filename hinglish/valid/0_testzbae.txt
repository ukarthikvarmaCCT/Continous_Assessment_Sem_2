 chaar saal baad ve lvaav sthanantarit ho gaye or vodaka ko "smaranof" naam kii samakaleen francisi vartanee ke tahat bechnaa shuru kar diya
 The new product was a good success and by the end of 1930 it was exported to most European countries

 In the 1930s, Vladimir met a Russian man, Rudolf Kunet, who emigrated to the US in 1920
 kunet kaa parivaar kranti se pehle masco main smaranof ke liye sharaab kii aapurti kiya karata tha
 In 1933, Vladimir sold the right to start production of Smirnoff vodka in North America to Kunet
 haalanki america main vyapaar utana safal nahin rahaa jitani ki kunet ne ummid kii thi
 In 1938, Kunett failed to pay the required licenses for sale, and he approached Heublen's President John Martin, who agreed to purchase Smirnoff's rights to the value of the distilling equipment
 unke board ne sochaa ki ve pagal ho gaye the
 Sales were very slow until one day they removed the corks and replaced them with whiskey corks
 kentki main bikri kaaphi teji se bad gayi kyonki vitarakon ne smaranof kii marketing 'safed whisky, naa koi swaad, naa koi gandh' ke rup main kerani shuru kar di thi
 After the war John Martin sat in a bar with a friend and a girlfriend
 premika ke paas ek ginger bear kaa brands tha jo nahin bik rahaa tha or dost ke paas tambe ke magon kaa stock tha jise vah bhi nahin bech paa rahaa tha
 He mixed Smirnoff in a copper mug with ginger beer, added lime to it, and thus the Moscow Mule was born

 In 1990, the Berlin Wall collapsed and Helmut Cole signed a deal with Gorbachev that would have reintegrated Germany if the Soviet Army had remained in East Germany and had been paid by West Germany for three years
 Suddenly 500,000 Soviet soldiers were paid in hard currency and had almost nothing to drink
 uske baad unhone apni karency ko marlboro cigarette, levi kii genes or smaranof vodaka par kharch kar di
 The us-made type of Smirnoff vodka was particularly popular

 The Smirnoff Company also had the naming rights to the Smirnoff Music Center, a concert amphitheater in Dallas, Texas
 unhone edinburgh frinz main sthit ek pramukh samaaroh sthal smaranof anderbeli ko bhi pryojit kiya
 In the late 1990s, Smirnoff introduced a new range of products in the UK and later in the European and North America markets that quickly became popular with young people, especially within the Club scene

 Chemical elements are those pure substances made up of only one type of atoms
 yaa jo aise parmaanuon se bane hote hai jinke nabhik main samaan sankhya main proton hote hai
 All chemical substances are made up of elements
 hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, tathaa silicon aadi kuch tatv hai
 Till 2007, a total of 117 elements have been discovered or found out of which 94 elements are naturally present on the earth
 kritrim nabhikeey abhikriyaaon ke parinamswaroop ucch parmaanu kramank vaale tatv samay-samay par khoje jate rahe hai
 The literary meaning of the word element has many, but in chemistry it is used in a special sense
 panchtatv ke antargat hamaare sahitya main prithvi, jal, tejas, vaayu or akaash kii gananaa bahut puraane samay se hoti aa rahi he
 Panchagyanandriya senses the form, rasa, smell touch and words of these five panatmantras, panchavishyas or the five senses, and the gross ghosts due to which these panchatnamatras are expressed are called Panchatattva
 sankhya or vaisheshik darshanon ke aadhaar par prithvi kaa gun gandh he or tadvishyak gyanendriya nasika he, jal kaa gun ras he or tadvishyak gyanendriya rasna yaa jihva he, tejas yaa agni kaa gun rup he or tadvishyak gyanendriya chakshu he, vaayu kaa gun sparsh he or tadvvishyak gyanendriya twachaa he tathaa akaash kaa gun shabd he, jisase sambandh rakhanevaali gyanendriya karn hai
 Chinese scholars also considered the Five Elements in the olden times, as the article shoe-qing shows from 2,000 years before Christ
 samast bhautik sristi ke muladhar tatv the: prithvi, agni, jal dhaatu or kashtha
 These scholars never tried to give a clear definition of the word tattva
 arestu ne tatwon ke saath bhautik gunon ke sambandh kaa nirdesh kiya
 These qualities were: dry or humid, hot or cold and guru or little guru
 europe main 16veen shatee main rasayan ke kshetra kaa vistaar hua, maamuli dhaatuon ko swarna main parinat karnaa or aayu badhaane evam sharir ko nirog karne ke liye oshadhiyon kii khoj karnaa rasayan kaa lakshya bana
 Paracelsus considered three or four elements, whose bases were considered salts, sulfur and mercury
 ye teenon kramash: sthirataa, dahan yaa jvalan, evam dravatv yaa vashpashiltaa ke gunon se sambandh rakhte the
 Similar ideas continued to be found in France and England in the 17th century
 dow wilis ne muladhar sakriy tatv ye maane : paara yaa spirit, gandhak yaa tel or lavan tathaa inke saath niskriy tatv jal yaa kaph or mitti bhi maane
 JB Van Helmont considered water to be the main element and also considered salt, sulfur and mercury as water
 hawa ko bhi unhone tatv mana
 The most obvious idea regarding the element was put forward by Robert Boyle in 1661 AD
 usne tatv kii paribhaasha yah di ki ham tatv unhen kahengen, jo kisi yantric yaa rasinic kriya se apane se bhinn do padaarthon main vibhajit na kiye ja saken
 The stall considered four elements were acid, water, earth and phlogiston
 yah antim tatv vastuon ke jalane main sahaayak hota tha
 Chemists began preparing a list of elements, following Robert Boyle's definition
 bahut samay tak pani tatv mana jaataa rahaa
 Priestley produced oxygen gas in 1774 AD
 cavendish ne 1781 i0 main oxygen or hydrogen ke yoga se pani taiyaar karke dikhaa diya or tab pani tatv na rahakar yogicon kii shrenee main aa gaya
 Lavvaje explained the major differences between compound and element in 1789 AD
 uske samay tak tatwon kii sankhya 23 pahunch chuki thi
 In the 19th century, Sir Humphrey Davy also separated sodium, the basic element of salt, and showed calcium and potassium by separating them from compounds
 davy ke samay ke purv chlorine ke tatv hone main andeh mana jaataa tha
 People believed it to be oxymuritic acid, as it was formed by the oxidation of muriatic acid, but Dewey proved that chlorine is the element
 prakruti main kitne tatv ho sakate hai, iskaa pataa bahut dinon tak rasayanagyon ko na tha
 Therefore, many such elements were also announced in the history of the discovery of elements, which we do not consider as elements today
 20veen shatee main mojali naamak tarun vaigyanik ne parmaanu sankhya kii kalpana rakhi, jisase spasht ho gaya ki sabase halake tatv udajan se lekar prakruti main praapt sabase baari tatv uranium tak tatwon kii sankhya lagbhag 100 ho sakati he
 The discovery of radioactive elements made it clear that the element is not inseparable by Boyle's definition
 prakruti main uranium vibhakt hokar swayan duusare tatwon main parinat hota rahata he
 Experiments have also made it possible that we can divide elements and create new elements in our laboratories
 uranium ke aage 8-9 tatwon ko kritrim vidhi se banaaya bhi ja sakaa he
 The following table gives the 12 most abundant elements in our galaxy

 Medical science is the branch of science which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or mitigating disease in case of disease and increasing age
 ayurvigyaan vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa nidaan karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 India is the father of medical science
 apane praarambhik samay main ayurvigyaan kaa adhyayan jeev vigyaan kii ek shakha ke samaan hi kiya gaya tha
 Later, 'anatomy' and 'physiology' etc
 were made its basis
 ayurvigyaan kaa janm bharat main kai hajaar varsh i

 The knowledge of the actions that take place in the body revealed that their form is very chemical and these phenomena are the result of the chemical activities
 jyon-jyon khojein huin tyon-tyon sharir kii ghatnaon kaa rasinic rup saamne aata gaya
 In this way, chemistry became so important that it became a separate branch of medicine, which was named biochemistry
 iske dwaara na keval shaareerik ghatnaon kaa rup spasht hua, varan rogon kii utpatti tathaa unke pratirodh kii vidhiyaan bhi nikal ain
 At the same time, physics also helped in understanding physical phenomena very well
 yah gyaat hua ki anek ghatnaayen bhautik niyamon ke anusaar hi hoti hai
 Like biochemistry, biophysics has also become a part of medical science and it has also helped in understanding the origin of diseases and in resisting them
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon se bhi rogrodhan tathaa chikitsa main bahut sahaayta mili he
 And with the help of all these, a lot of progress has been made in the welfare of human beings, which has resulted in increased lifespan
 sharir, shaareerik ghatnaon or rog sambandhi aantarik kriyaaon kaa sookshm gyaan praapt karne main anek prakaar kii praayogic vidhiyon or yantron se, jo samay-samay par banate rahe hai, bahut sahaayta mili he
 But the result of this in-depth study is that medical science is divided into many branches and so much discovery has been made in each branch, new tools have been made and experimental methods have been known that no scholar or student can be fully familiar with them all
 
 din--prati--din chikitsak ko prayogshaalaon tathaa yantron par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he or yah nirbharta uttarottar bad rahi he
 The goal of every education is the mental development of a human being, so that it can generate the power to reason and understand and manifest and implement its emotions accordingly
 ayurvigyaan kii shiksha kaa bhi yahi uddeshy he
 For this, among all medical students, the student has to spend five years as an undergraduate
 medical collejon main vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhaar vigyaanon kaa adhyayan karke ucch madhyamik shiksha praapt karne par bharti kiya jaataa he
 After that the first two years, the student studies the basic principles called anatomy and physiology, so that he becomes aware of the natural condition of the body
 iske pashchaat teen varsh rogon ke kaaran in swaabhaavik dashaon kii vikrutiyaan kaa gyaan paane tathaa unki chikitsa kii reeti seekhney main vyateet hote hai
 Measures to prevent diseases and pharmacopoeia, which is the policy related branch of this science, he studies during this period
 in paanch varshon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat vah snaatak banataa he
 After this, he works in a department according to his interest for one year and obtains functional knowledge of that subject
 tatpashchaat vah snatakottar shikshan main diploma yaa degree lene ke liye kisi vibhaag main bharti ho saktaa he
 All medical colleges belong to one or the other university which conducts their examinations and courses and aims to generate the power of reasoning in science students and inaugurate new science mysteries
 ayurvigyaan vidyalayon ke prayek shikshak tathaa vidhyaarthee kaa bhi uddeshy yahi hona chahie ki use roganivarak nai vastuon kii khoj karke is artinashak kala kii unnati karne kii cheshtaa kerani chahie
 Not only this, the life goal of teachers should also be that they produce such investigators
 chikitsapaddati kaa centrestambh vah saamaanya chikitsak he jo janata yaa pariwaron ke ghanishtha sampark main rahata he tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par unki sahaayta karata he
 He is the friend and counselor of his patients and tries to give them philosophical solace in time
 vah rog sambandhi saadhaaran samasyaon se parichit hota he tathaa doorvarti sthanon, gaanvon ityadi, main jaakar rogiyon kii seva karata he
 Here he does not get all the tools of help which he had seen during his teaching period and which he had learned to use
 bade nagaron main ye bahut kuch uplabdh ho jate hai
 When required, he has to seek the help of a specialist or send the patient to the hospital
 aajkal is vigyaan kii kisi ek shakha kaa vishesh adhyayan karke kuch chikitsak visheshgy ho jate hai
 In this way, special treatment is available by experts in heart disease, mental diseases, astigmatism, pediatric etc
 aajkal chikitsa kaa vyay bahut bad gaya he
 Essential examinations, valuable drugs, methods of medicine and equipment are the main reasons for the diagnosis of the disease
 aadhunik ayurvigyaan ke kaaran janata kaa jeevankaal bhi bad gaya he, parantu aushadhiyon par bahut vyay hota he
 It is to be regretted that due to the present economic conditions, proper treatment has gone beyond the power of ordinary human beings
 chikitsavigyaan kii shakti ab bahut bad gai he or nirantar badhati ja rahi he
 Nowadays contraception can be done
 garbh kaa ant bhi ho saktaa he
 The mitigation of pain, keeping in unconsciousness for a long time, the successful treatment of many infectious diseases, suppression and enhancement of instincts, the change of sentiment by drugs, the effect on personality by surgery, etc
 have all become possible
 manushya kaa jeevankaal adhik ho gaya he
 New medicines are coming out day-by-day; The cause of diseases is being known; His treatment is being known
 sarkaar ke swasthya sambandhi teen pramukh kaary hai
 First, do not allow diseases to spread in public; Secondly, health promotion of the people, for which suitable food, pure water, suitable place to live and cleanliness of the city is necessary; Thirdly, to provide appropriate and good medical aid in case of disease

 They divided the citizens of India into different groups according to the sect
 unki kuch nitiyaan hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karti thim to kuch musalamaanon ke prati
 By the 20th century, Muslims began to fear the majority of Hindus and Hindus began to feel that the British government and Indian leaders were trying to give privileges to Muslims and discriminate against Hindus

 The Muslim League placed different demands at different times

 In 1935, the Legislative Assembly of Sindh Province raised the same demand
 iqbaal or moulana mohammad ali johar ne mohammad ali jinna ko is maang kaa samarthan karne ko kaha
 By this time Jinnah seemed to be in favor of hindu-muslim unity, but gradually he started accusing that Congress leaders were not paying attention to the interests of Muslims
 lahore main 1940 ke muslim lig sammelan main jinna ne saafe taur par kaha ki vah do alag-alag raashtra chaahate hai Hindu organizations such as the Hindu Mahasabha were strongly opposed to the partition of India, but believed that there were differences between Hindus and Muslims
 1937 main elahabaad main hindu mahasabha ke sammelan main ek bhaashan main vir saavarkar ne kaha tha - aaj ke din bharat ek raashtra nahin he, yahan par do raashtra hai-hindu or musalmaan
 Most of the Congress leaders were secular and against partition of India on the basis of sect
 mahatma gandhi kaa vishwaas tha ki hindu or musalmaan saath rah sakate hai or unhen saath rahanaa chaiye
 He strongly opposed partition: "my whole soul revolts against the idea that Hindus and Muslims are two opposing views and cultures

 "for many years, Gandhi and his followers tried not to leave the Congress to the Muslims, and in the process, leaders of Hindu and Muslim hot parties irritated them

 Nathuram Godse cited this work of Mahatma Gandhi as a reason for his assassination
 bahut se vidwaanon kaa mat he ki british sarkaar ne vibhaajan kii prakriya ko thik se nahin sambhala

 Critics are of the view that the short-sightedness of the early and immediate leadership of the British to transfer power early was responsible for the massacre and unrest that took place during independence

 This division of India is one of the many divisions made in the eighteenth century in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East

 This division of India by the imperial Britain is one of the four divisions it made

 He explained the reason for these divisions is that people from different communities cannot coexist

 Conan Doyle has written four novels and fifty-six short stories depicting Holmes

 Later a series of short stories and two serial novels were published till 1927
 The stories cover the period from about 1875 to 1914, with the last case being 1914

 In two stories, Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memory, while Watson Frame narrates the story
 conan doyal ne kaha ki homes kaa charitra dow joseph bel se prerit tha, jinke liye doyal ne ek lipic ke rup main edinburgh royal infrmari main kaam kiya tha
 Like Holmes, Bell was known to draw large conclusions from small observations
 maaikel harrison ne 1971 ke ek lekh elleri queens mistry magazine main tark diya he ki yah charitra, vendale sherer se prerit tha jo ek hatya ke maamle main ek "paraamarsh jasoos" the jo kathith rup se england main 1882 main akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main chaaya rahaa
 Outside of the adventures recorded by Dr
 Watson, little is known about the biography of Sherlock Holmes and not even in the original stories of Conan Doyle; Nevertheless, relevant information about his early life and detailed family form an outline of this detective's life
 kahani hiz last bo main homes kaa janm andazan 1854 ke aas-paas lagata he; aam taur par, tarikh ko 6 janvari ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Holmes says that when he was in the pre-graduation class, he first developed the permissions method
 Author Dorothy L
 Shares suggested that according to the information of the two exploits, Holmes would have been in Cambridge rather than Oxford and that "of all the colleges in Cambridge, Sydney Sussex probably offered the most benefits to someone with a Holmes-like situation and more accurate information
" In the default, we can tentatively place it there
 uske praarambhik maamle, jinhen usne ek shaukia ke taur par anjaam diya, uske vishvavidhyalay ke saathi chaatro ke madhyam se aae the
 According to Holmes, a visit to the father of one of his classmates prompted him to take up espionage as a profession and he spent six years as a consulting detective after university work, until financial difficulties led him to Watson Not forced to take it as his room mate, at which point the narration of the stories begins
 1881 se, varnan he ki 221B baker street, landan, homes kaa thikaana tha jahaan se vah apni nijee jasusi agency chalaata he
 221B seventeen steps up is a flat which in an old manuscript has been called the "upper end" of the road
 dow watasan ke aane tak, homes akele kaam karata tha, kabhi-kabhaar hi shahar ke chote tabake se agenton ko niojit karata tha, jisamen dher saare mubir or bazaaru bacchon kaa ek samooh tha jise vah baker street irregulars kahata tha
 Irregulators appear in three stories, "the Sign of the Four", "A Study in Scarlet" and "the Adventure of the Crooked Man"
 homes ke parivaar kaa thodaa hi varnan kiya gaya he
 The stories do not mention his parents and he only states that his ancestors were "rural chieftains"
 "da adventure of da greek interprator" main homes daawa karte hai ki uske mahaan-chachaa francisi kalakaar vernett the
 He has an older brother, Mycroft, a government official, who appears in three stories; He is mentioned in many other stories
 smaranshakti yukt vyakti yaa sarkaar kii nitiyon ke sabhi pahaluon ke chalate-phirte database ke rup main microft kaa prashasnic seva main ek anoothaa pad he
 It has been reported that Mycroft has far more capacity than Sherlock in terms of observation and permissions
 haalanki, usamen sherl vaali urja or junun kii kami he or jo bade aaraam se apana samay diogenus club main bitaana pasand karata he, jise "landan ke sabase zyaada gaiyr-milansaar logon kaa ek club" kaha gaya he
 It is not clear whether Holmes has other siblings
 "da adventure of da copper biches" main homes kahata he,"main kabool karata hum ki yah, vah paristhiti nahin he jisamen main apni bahan ko dekhnaa chaahunga", jisase kuch logon ko unke astitv kaa andeshaa hota he
 But in such a case, he asks a woman to warn him as his sister, so it can only be a figurative language
 homes apana adhikansh vyavsaayik samay apane achche mitra or kalkram se abhilekhan karanevaale watasan ke saath saajha karte hai, jo 1887 main apni shaadi hone se pehle or apni patni kii mrityu hone ke baad punah kuch samay ke liye homes ke saath rahata he; uskaa ghar, uski makaan malkin, shrimati hadsan sambhalati hai
 Watson has two roles in Holmes's life
 pehali, vah uske maamalon ke sanchaalan main vyaavhaarik sahaayta detaa he; vah jasoos kaa dahinaa haath he, jo khoji, jhansa dene vaala, sahyogi or doot ke vibhinn roopon main kaary karata he
 Second, he is a historian of Holmes
 Most of Holmes's stories are phenomenological narratives, written from Watson's point of view as a summary of the detective's most interesting cases
 homes ko aksar watasan ke lekhan ko sansanikhez or loklubhaavan kehete hue ullikhit kiya gaya he, yah sujhaate hue ki lekh uski kala ke shuddh gananaa "vigyaan" kii nishpaksh or sateek report pesh nahin karte
 Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is undoubtedly his most important relationship
 kai kahaniyon main, watasan ke liye homes kaa sneh- aksar uske thande, bauddhik bahya swarup ke peeche chipa hua- ujagar ho jaataa he
 "in The Adventure of the Three Garidebs, Watson is injured in a confrontation with a villain; although the bullet wound proves to be" very superficial ", Watson is elated by Holmes' response: kul milakar, homes ke taees saal sakriy rup se kaary karte rahane kaa varnan he jis dauraan watasan ne uske satraa maamalon ko lipibaddh kiya
 Holmes retires in 1903-04 to a Bee Farm in Sussex Downs where he takes the hobby of beekeeping as his primary occupation and eventually "practical Hand Book of Bee Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen "
 keval ek maamla, jo homes dwaara swayan varnit he or jisaki vah ek shaukia taur par chaan-been kar rahaa tha, jasoos kii sevanivritti ke dauraan ghatit hota he
 Holmes describes himself as "faked" in terms of habits and lifestyle
 watasan ke anusaar, homes ek sanakee he, jise saafe-safaai yaa suvyavastha ke samakaleen maanakon se koi lagaav nahin he
 In an early story, Watson describes Holmes as: jo chiz dusron ko avyavashtha-si lagati he, vah homes ko upyogi jaankariyon kaa bhandar dikhti he
 Holmes in the stories dips into his shattered web of random documents and artifacts to find exactly the specific document or anything he is looking for
 vyaktigat swatchta ke maamle main, virodhabhas swaroop, homes ko "da hound of da baskeravilles" main vyaktigat safai se ek "billi-jaisaa" pyaar karne vaala varnit kiya he
 In no way does this seem to impede the very practical pursuit of his profession, however; Holmes's first story, "A Study in Scarlet," has his hands dirty with acid stains, while Holmes later uses his own blood drops for chemical experimentation
 watasan aksar homes ke khaane kii anishchit aadaton ko chihnit karata he
 Detective is often described as starving himself during times of intense intellectual activity, as during The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, where Watson states: homes kaa itihaaskaar uske pipe upyog karne kii aadat, yaa uske cigarette or cigar, ke apekshaakrit kam prayog ko bura nahin maanata
or na hi watasan, homes dwaara ek muvakkil ke liye sach modane yaa kanoon todane kii tatparta kii ninda karata he jahaan uskaa maananaa he ki yah naitik rup se uchit he
 Holmes is depicted as a patriot, who in many stories is working on behalf of the government in matters of national security
 vah hiz last bo main counter-intelligence kaa kaary bhi karata he jo WWI kii shuruuaat main avasthit he
 As a shooting exercise, the detective has decorated the wall of his Baker Street hideout with a "VR" mark made from his pistol bullets
 homes kaa abhimaan yada-kada ghamand kaa rup le letaa he; yadhyapi auchity ke saath; vah police nirikshakon ko apane utkrisht nishkarshon se uljhaakar anand praapt karata he
 He does not aspire to fame and is generally satisfied by allowing the police to take public credit for his work
 yah aksar hi hota he ki jab watasan apni kahaniyon ko prakashit karata he, to maamle main homes kii bhoomika spasht ho jaati he
 Holmes's conduct is rendered neutral and cold
 phir bhi ek saahasik kaary ke bich, ullekhneey junun ke saath, homes chamak dikhaa saktaa he
 He has a tendency to perform and has a wide net to catch a criminal and unleash his crime, often to impress Watson or one of the Scotland Yard inspectors
 homes kabhi-kabhi nashili dawaaon kaa upyog karata he, khaas kar jab uttejk maamalon kii kami rahati he
 He is addicted to cocaine, which is pierced by the use of a special needle in a seven percent solution that he holds in a leather shell
 homes opium kaa bhi yada-kada upyog karata he, lekin ek opium adde par jane kii baat par usne ghor asweekruti vyakt kii
 All three were justified in England in the late 19th century
 homes dwaara nashili dawaaon ke prayog se koi chikitsakeey aapatti naa dikhaakar, dow watasan, victorian chikitsa kattarpanthi ko darshaate he
 Naively, he denounces his friend's habit, describing it as "the only evil" of the detective, and expressing concern about Holmes' mental health and its potential impact on excellent intelligence
 baad kii kathaon main, watasan homes ko drugs se dur karne kaa daawa karte hai
 Nevertheless, according to his medical friend, Holmes remains an addict whose habit was "not dead, but sleeping only
" " Although he initially needs Watson to share the rent of his comfortable residence at 221B Baker Street, in "the Adventure of the Dying Detective", Watson reveals, "I have no doubt when Holmes lived alone" That the house would probably have been bought at the price that Holmes pays for his room, "pointing out that he generated a good income from his behavior, though it was properly He did not know how much he charged for his services
 vah "da problem of thor brij" main yah zarur kahata he ki "meraa peshewar shulk ek nishchit str par he
 i don't change them, only when i forgive them completely 


 " yah ek aise sandarbh main kaha gaya he jab ek graahak ne usko uski fees kaa duguna dene kii peshkash kii; lekin, yah sambhav he ki dhani graahak homes ko uske maanak shulk se kaafii zyaada paarishramik pradaan karte hai: "da adventure of da final problem" main homes kahata he ki france kii sarkaar or scandenevia ke shahi nivas ne uski sevaaon ke liye use paryaapt dhan diya he jisase vah aaraam se ritair ho saktaa he, jabaki "da adventure of blike peter" main watasan ne ingit kiya he ki homes, amir or taqatvar logon kii madad se inkaar kar detaa tha yadi usko unka maamla pasand nahin aata, jabaki atyadhik vinamr graahakon ke maamalon ke liye vah puure saptaah kaa samay samarpit kar detaa tha
 In "A Case of Identity", Holmes also tells Watson that after "A Scandal in Bohemia", the King of Bohemia gave him a golden snuff box and received a magnificent ring from the Dutch royal family; In "the Adventure of the Bruce - Partington Plans", Holmes receives an emerald tie-pin from Queen Victoria
 homes ke maamalon ke anya smriti chihn hai ireni edler se praapt sone kii ginni or france ke raashtrapati kaa ek hastakshrit dhanyavad patr or huret naam ke ek hatyare ko pakadvane ke liye lejan of honor da adventure of da golden pins-nez "da adventure of da priari skool" main homes ullas ke saath apana haath malataa he" jab holdernes kaa duk raashi ko likhata he, jisase watasan ko bhi aashcharya hota he or uske baad check ko thapki detaa he, yah kah kar ki "main ek garib aadmi hum," ek ghatana jise homes kii vidambnaapurna hasya kii pravriti ke rup main kaarij kiya ja saktaa he
 Certainly, during his career, Holmes worked for both the most powerful kings and governments of Europe and various wealthy nobles and industrialists and was also approached for advice by poor moneylenders and humble teachers of the lower ranks of society
 apane kharchon ke liye homes, graahakon se paise vasuulata he or samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye prastaavit kisi bhi inaam kaa daawa kar saktaa he: vah "da adventure of da specold band" main kahata he ki miss stoner uske dwaara kiye gaye kharche ko de saktin hai or anurodh karata he ki "da red-heded lig" bank, uske dwaara maamle par kiye gaye kharche kii bharpai kare
 "da adventure of da beril coronet main chori hue ratna ko punah praapt karne main ai laagat kaa bhugtan karne ke liye homes ke paas uskaa amir banker graahak he or vah us inam par bhi daawa karata he jo us banker ne khojane vaale ke liye ghoshit kiya tha
 The only woman to influence Holmes was Irene Adler, who was always referred to by Holmes as "the woman"
 homes ko khud is shabd kaa sidhe prayog karte hue uddhrut nahin kiya gaya he- bhale hi vah anya maamalon main uskaa asli naam kai baar letaa he
 Adler is one of the few women cited in all of Holmes's stories, although she actually appears in only one story, "A Scandal in Bohemia
" ek kahani main, "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" shaadi ke liye homes kii mangani ho jaati he, lekin keval apane maamle ke liye jaankaree jutaney kii ichha se
vah raste main aane vaali bahut adhik aakarshak mahila graahakon ke prati spasht ruchi darshata he, 
 homes ne anivaary rup se "apane graahak main aage koi ruchi nahin dikhaai jab vah uski ek samasya ke centre se baahar chali gai
 "holmes found his youth, beauty and energy distinct from any romantic interest, appealing
 aise prakaran homes ke aakarshan ko darshaate hai, abhi tak edler ke maamle ke alaava, kisi gambhir yaa dirghakaalik lagaav kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Watson wrote that Holmes "hates women" but "has a bizarre way of finding favor", with Holmes saying, "I am not a fan of the feminine heart"; In fact, he finds "the intention of women 


 so cryptic 


 how can you build on such a deceptive object? Their smallest action can cost a lot
" 

 unka sabase asaadhaaran vyavhaar baalo ke ek pin par nirbhar kar saktaa he
 "however, Doyle recalled Joseph Bell saying," Holmes Babbage is just as inhuman as the calculating machine and with all the possibility of falling in love
 " Another interesting aspect of Holmes's relationship with women is that the source of the pleasure he gets from his company is the problems he brings
 sin of da four main, watasan ne homes ko "ek yantra maanav, ek gananaa mashin," ke rup main uddhrut kiya he or homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he,"yah sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ki apane faisle ko vyaktigat gunon dwaara purvaagrahagrast hone kii anumati nahin deni chahie
ek graahak mere liye maatr ek ikai he, - samasya main ek kaarak

" yah saamaanya rup se mahilaon ke saath or vishesh rup se muvakkil ke saath homes kii sambandh banane main anichhaa ko sanderbhit karata he, jaisaa ki watasan ne kaha "kabhi-kabhi tumhaare andar ek sakaaratmak amanviyata dikhti he
 At the end of "the Adventure of the Devil's Foot," Holmes says: "I have never loved Watson, but if i did, and if the woman i loved had an end, i might have been one of my willing lions Behaves like a hunter
 "in the story, investigator Dr
 Sterndale kills the man who killed his girlfriend, Brenda Tragenis, in order to exact an exact revenge that the law could not provide
 La
 "in The Adventure of the Dying Detective, Watson writes that Mrs
 Hudson likes Holmes in her own way, despite her cynical eccentricity as a tenant, due to her remarkably gentle and courteous behavior with women
" In The Sign of the Four, Watson once again quotes Holmes as saying, "I won't tell them too much
" Never trust women completely, homes kii praathmik bauddhik tahakikat vidhi he ek aparaadh ke samaadhaan kaa anumiti tark "pani kii ek boond se", vah likhata he, "ek taarkik vyakti atlantic yaa niagara kii sambhaavna kaa anumaan laga saktaa he bina ek ko dekhe yaa duusare ko sune
"homes kii kahaniyaan aksar uski "anumiti" kii sahaspurn pratibha ke pradarshan ke saath shuru hoti hai
 It is of little interest to logicians and those interested in logic to try to analyze what Holmes is doing during his permissions
 prathit hota he ki homiya anumiti, nishkarsh nikaalane se nirmit he jo praathmik rup se yaa to sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton par aadhaarit he jo satark aagamanaatmak adhyayan kaa parinaam he jaise ki vibhinn prakaar ke cigar kii raakh kaa homes kaa adhyayan athwa sarvottam vivaran se prasphutit nishkarsh he
 The form of Holmes's straight-line pragmatics is generally, "if 'p', then 'q', where 'p' is the visible proof and 'q' is what the evidence indicates
 lekin vahaan madhyavarti siddhant bhi hai, jaisaa ki nimna udhaaharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 In "A Scandal in Bohemia" Holmes permits that Watson was very wet recently and that her "maid girl was very clumsy and careless"
 When surprised, Watson asks how Holmes knows this
 Holmes answers: is maamle main, homes ne kai jude siddhanton kaa prayog kiya: By explicitly applying such principles, Holmes is able to infer that: "watasan ke juute ke kinare, kai saamanantar kataav se chhile hue hai"; se "watasan kii naukaraani foohad or laaparvaah he"; or "watasan haal hi main bahut geela rahaa he or gande mausam main baahar gaya tha
 " anumiti tark homes ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se ek ajanabi ke vyavsaay kaa khulaasa karne main sakasham banaate hai, jaise ki a study in skarlet main marine ke ek sevanivrutt sargent; da red-heded lig main ek jahaaj kaa purv badhai jo mahajan ban gaya; or ek billiard-marker or da adventure of da greek interprator main ek topakhane kaa sevanivrutt NCO
 isi tarah, nirjeev vastuon kaa adhyayan karke, homes unke maalikon ke bare main ascharyajanak vistrut nishkarsh nikaalane main sakasham he, jisamen shaamil he da sin of da four main watasan kii jeb-ghadi or saath hi saath anya kahaniyon main ek topi, ek pipe, or ek chadi
 Once he has accumulated a lot of evidence and allowed possible interpretations and to present a solution, Holmes moves to one interpretation that matches all the facts of the case
 jaisaa ki homes watasan ko bataata he, "jab tumne asambhav ko hataa diya, to jo bhi bachaa, haalanki asambhavit, avashya sach hona chahie
" Holmes demonstrates a keen interest in acting and making pseudo-vests
 kai kahaniyon main, vah saboot ikattha karne ke liye itnaa swaabhaavik chhadam vesh dhaaran karata he ki watasan bhi use nahin pakad paata, jaisaa ki "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" main, da main wyeth da twisted lip or a scandle in bohemia main
anya karnaamon main, homes apane maamle ko prabhavi banane ke liye ghayal hone kaa yaa biimaar hone kaa bahaanaa karata he, yaa shaamil logon ko doshi tehraata he, jaise "da adventure of da daaing detective" main
 Pistol Holmes and Watson carry pistols with them; Often his old service revolver in Watson's case
 haalanki, watasan keval saat maukon par in hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii charchaa karata he
 'stick Holmes as a gentleman, often walking with a stick or stick
 watasan dwaara use lakdi kii talwaar main visheshgy varnit kiya gaya he or vah do baar apni chadi kaa upyog ek hathiyaar ke rup main karata he
 In Talwar a Study in Scarlett, Watson describes Holmes as an expert in swordsmanship — though in no story Holmes has used the sword
 "gloria scot" main isaki charchaa he ki homes ne talwaar kaa abhyaas kiya he
 Whip In many stories, Holmes appears armed with a whip
 da adventure of da specold band main iskaa prayog vah ek jahrile saanp ko maarane ke liye karata he or a cese of aaidentity main usase ek thag ko maarane ke liye kareeb aata he
 Holmes, using a "whip" in "the red-headed League", drops a pistol from John Clay's hands
 mukkebaazi homes nangi ungaliyon se ek vikat ladaaku ke rup main varnit he
 In The Sign of the Four, Holmes introduces himself to a professional boxer as: kahaniyon main kai avasaron par homes, ubharate hue apane pratidwandviyon ke saath guttham-guttha ladaai main uljhe, jahaan ve anivaary rup se vijeta rahe
 "gloria scot" main yah doharaaya gaya he ki homes ek mukkebaaz ke rup main prashikshit he
 In the martial arts The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes tells Watson how he overcame Professor Moriart by using martial arts and slamming his adversary on the Raishenbach Falls
 vah kahata he ki "haalanki, mujhe kuch gyaan he, baritsu, kaa yaa kushti kii japani pranali kaa, jo kai baar mere liye bahut upyogi sabit hui he
 The name "baritsu" appears to be a reference to real-life martial arts Bartitsu
 pehali hi kahani a study in skarlet main, homes kii prishthbhumi ke bare main kuch diya gaya he
 In the first half of 1881, he was introduced as an independent student of chemistry with many diverse inquisitive interests, almost all of which appeared to him to be better at solving crimes
 An early story, "the Adventure of the" Gloria Scott "", provides more background for who influenced Holmes to become a detective: The father of a college friend gave him a brownish appreciation of his permissiveness skills
 Holmes strictly follows the scientific method and emphasizes the power of arguments and observation and permissiveness
 a study in skarlet main, homes kaa daawa he vah nahin jaanata ki prithvi surya ke chaaron ore gumti he, chunki is tarah kii jaankaree uske kaam ke liye apraasangik he
 After hearing this fact directly from Watson, he says that he will immediately try to forget her
 He states that he believes that the brain has a limited capacity to store information and therefore learning redundant will only reduce its ability to learn useful things
 Dr
 Watson later assesses Holmes' ability to is: yahaan tak ki a study in skarlet ke ant main, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki homes latin jaanata he or mul roman sukhtiyon ke anuwaad kii koi jarurat nahin padati, haalanki jasusi kaary ke liye bhashaa ke gyaan kii pratyaksh upyogita ndehpurn he
 Later stories also refute the list
 homes kii raajnneeti se sambhavit agyanta ke baavjood "a scandle in bohemia" main vah tathakthith "count won kram" kii asli pahchaan ko turant bhaanp jaataa he
 In relation to non-sensational literature, his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, even Goethe
 iske alaava, da adventure of da bruce- partington plance main watasan suchit karata he ki navambar 1895 main, "homes khud ko ek vinibandh main dubaa letaa he jo usne poliphonic motets of lasus se liya tha"- ek atyadhik gudh kshetra, jiske liye homes ko apni smriti ko jaankaree ke ek vishaal bhandar se, jiskaa kii aparaadh kii ladaai se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, avyavasthit karnaa hoga- itnaa vyapak gyaan ki uske vinibandh ko is vishay par "antim alphaz" mana jaataa he
 Later narratives refute the notion that Holmes is unwilling to know anything unless it is immediately relevant to his occupation; In the second chapter of The Valley of Fear, Holmes would rather declare that "all knowledge is useful to the detective" and at the end of The Adventure of the Lions Men he calls himself "an all-in-one of memory with bizarre conception
" The subject reader defines as "
 " Holmes is also a competent code specialist
 vah watasan ko sambodhit karata he,"main kuta lekhan ke sabhi roopon se kaaphi parichit hum or is vishay par ek tuchh vinibandh kaa main khud lekhak hum, jisamen main ek sau saath alag sankethik shabdon kaa vishleshan kar rahaa hum
" aisi hi ek yojana aavriti vishleshan ke prayog se da adventure of da daancing main main hal hoti he
 Holmes's analysis of physical evidence is both scientific and accurate
 uske tareekon main shaamil he avyakt print kaa prayog jaise pairon ke nishaan or khur print or cycle patariyaan, ek aparaadh sthal par karrwai kii pahchaan karne ke liye, aparaadhiyon ko pahchaanane ke liye tambaakoo kii raakh or cigarette ke turron kaa prayog, ek dhokhadhadi kaa pardaafash karne ke liye tip patron kii tulana, do hatyaron ko benakaab karne ke liye barood avasheshon kaa prayog ", do aparaadh sthalon se praapt goli kii tulana or yahaan tak ki ungaliyon ke nishaan kaa shuruaati prayog 
 a scandle in bohemia main homes ne manovigyaan ke gyaan kaa bhi pradarshan kiya he, jahaan usne ireni edler ko tasviir chhipaane ke sambandh main dhokhaa dene ke liye phuslaaya, jo is "aadhaar" par tikaa tha ki aag lagane kii sthiti main ek avivaahit mahila apni sabase keemtee chiz chaahegi jabaki ek shaadishuda aurat apane bachche kii taraf jhapategi
pehali kahani, a study in skarlet main, homes puraane khun ke daag kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek rasinic prakriya kii khoj kaa daawa karata he- haalanki vibhinn prakaar ke rakt kai saal baad tak pahachaane nahin jate the
 Despite the excitement of his life, Holmes retires to beekeeping Sussex Downs and writes a book on the subject, "practical Hand Book of Be Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen
 His search for relaxation in his music
 Can also be seen in love, especially in The red-headed League, where Holmes, taking leave from the case one evening, heard the violin of Pablo de Saraste Is obtained

 There are fifty-six short stories written by Conan Doyle and four novels called Law by Homian
 is kanoon ke praarambhik vidwaanon main britain ke ronaald nox or neuyork ke christopher morle shaamil hai
 As a tribute, more or less the authors have created many pop culture references from Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle, or the characters in the stories
 is tarah ke sanket ek kathanak ke vikaas kaa kaary karte hai, hisse ke bauddhik str ko badha sakate hai yaa ek chaukas darshak ke liye easter andey ke rup main vyavhaar kar sakate hai
 Some have been outspoken who presented Holmes as a character in a new setting, or a slightly more subtle hint, such as building a logical character while living in an apartment number 221B
 a well-known example of this is Gregory House's character in the House MD show, whose name and apartment number both refer to Holmes

 a third major reference is a quote, "this is easy, my dear Watson,"
 Another erroneous credit is generally given that Holmes is not explicitly described in the entire novel series, wearing a hunter hat
 " haalanki, homes ne ek kaan tak latakati yatra topi "da adventure of silver blez" main zarur pahani he
 Sidney Paget first depicted Holmes in The Hunters Hat and Inverness Cap in The Boscombe Valley Mystery and many other later stories
 homes ke prashansak 1891 se 1894 tak kii avadhi ko- "da adventure of da final problem main homes ke gaayab hone or sambhavit maut or phir "da adventure da adventure of da empti house" main punah prakat hone ke bich kaa samay- "mahaan antaraal" ke rup main ullikhit karte hai
 It is notable, however, that a later narration of a story in 1892 is described
 conan doyal ne kahaniyon kaa pehla set ek dashak ke dauraan likhaa
apane aitihaasik upanyaason ke liye or adhik samay dene kii ichha se unhone "da final problem" main homes ko maar daalaa, jo 1893 main prakashit hui

 haalanki janata kahani se prasann hui, lekin ek maranoparant homes se vah santusht nahin thi or isliye conan doyal ne do saal baad homes ko punerjeevit kiya
 Many considered Doyle's intention to bring Holmes alive, most notably writer-director Nicholas Meyer, who wrote an essay on the subject titled "the Great Man Takes a Speech" in the 1970s
 The real reason is not known
 Are, apart from the obvious: publishers offered to pay generously
 Whatever the reason, Conan Doyle continued to write Holmes stories for a quarter century
 kuch lekhakon ne antaraal ke liye anya spashtikaran die hai
 In Meyer's novel The seven-per-saint Solution, the interval is shown as a secret sabbatical when Holmes treats Sigmund Freud's cocaine addiction and presents Holmes with the pleasing suggestion that Watson Claiming that he has been killed by morirt, he will present a fictional account and say about the people, "they never wish you any good Vas will not

 Om Namo Bhagavate Mahasudarshanay Vasudevay Dhanvantaraye: Amritakalash Hastay Sarvabhaya Annihilation dhanvantari ko hindu dharm main naiyo ke vanshaj maane jate he
 He was a great physician who got the rank of Dev

 His descent into the Earth was during the churning of the sea
 sharad poornima ko chandramaa, karthik dwadashi ko kamdhenu gaay, trayodashi ko dhanvantari, chaturdashi ko kaali mata or amavasya ko bhagwati lakshmi ji kaa sagar se pradurbhaav hua tha
 That is why two days before Deepawali, Dhanteras is celebrated as the birth of Lord Dhanwantari as Dhanteras
 isi din inhone ayurveda kaa bhi pradurbhaav kiya tha
 He is called the form of Lord Vishnu who has four arms
 upar kii donon bhujaaon main shankh or chakra dhaaran kiye huye hai
 While in one of the two other arms, one has water and medicine and the other has nectar urn
 inkaa priy dhaatu pital mana jaataa he
 Therefore, there is also a tradition of buying brass utensils for Dhanteras

 It was he who discovered amritamay medicines
 inke vansh main divodas hue jinhone 'shalya chikitsa' kaa vishwa kaa pehla vidhyalay kaashi main sthapit kiya jiske pradhanacharya sushrut banaaye gaye the
 Sushruta was the only disciple of Divodas and the son of sage Vishwamitra
 unhone hi sushrut samhita likhi thi
 Sushruta was the first surgeon in the world
 deepawali ke avasar par karthik trayodashi-dhanteras ko bhagwaan dhanvantari kii puja karte hai
 It is said that Shankar took poison, Dhanvantari provided nectar and thus Kashi became a city of classics

 Prajapati read from them, then Ashwini Kumar read from him and Indra read from him

 According to Bhavprakash, Atreya chief sages obtained knowledge of Ayurveda from Indra and gave it to Agnivesh and other disciples
 iske uparant agnivesh tathaa anya shishyon ke tantron ko sankalit tathaa pratisanskrit kar charak dwara 'charak samhita' ke nirmaan kaa bhi aakhyaan he
 There is no mention of Dhanvantari anywhere in the Veda Samhita and Brahmin section
 mahabharat tathaa puraanon main vishnu ke ansh ke rup main unka ullekh praapt hota he
 They originated as eggs from the urn produced after Samudramanthan
 samudr ke nikalne ke baad unhone bhagwaan vishnu se kaha ki lok main meraa sthaan or bhaag nishchit kar den
 On this, Vishnu said that the department of Yajna has already been done in the gods, so it is no longer possible
 devon ke baad aane ke kaaran tum ishwar nahin ho
 Therefore, you will get siddhis in the next life and you will become famous in the world

 The tradition of Dhanvantari is as follows - yah vansh-parampara harivansh puraana ke aakhyaan ke anusaar he
 In Vishnupuran it is slightly different- vaidic kaal main jo mahatv or sthaan ashvini ko praapt tha vahi puranic kaal main dhanvantari ko praapt hua
 Where Ashwini had Madhukalash in her hand, Dhanvantari got the nectar Kalash, because Vishnu protects the world, so Dhanvantari, who protects from diseases, was considered a part of Vishnu
 vishavidya ke sambandh main kashyap or takshak kaa jo samvaad mahabharat main aayaa he, vaisaa hi dhanvantari or nagdevi mansa kaa brahmavaivart puraana main aayaa he
 He has been called a disciple of Garuda - bhagavan dhanvantari kii sadhana ke liye ek saadhaaran mantra he: Apart from this, he also has another mantra: prachli dhanvantari stotra is prakaar se he

 Andorra could until 1993 be considered de facto to have been under dual French and Spanish rule due to the lack of clear division of powers while it was ruled by a Spanish bishop and the French president, according to a treaty
 In 1278, the conflict between the French Count and the Catalan bishop was resolved by the signing of a pareage, which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'urgell
 The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form
 Today Andorra is a co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell, Spain as co- princes, in a duumvirate

 France has in many ways still control over the state
the executive branch consists of a Minister of State, who presides over a four-member Council of Government
 The minister of state is a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government
in 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco clarified that if there are no heirs to carry on the dynasty, the principality will remain an independent nation rather than revert to France

 Of which, most were absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, and the city of Rome with a small area close to it, ten years later in 1870
 The state has no firm population as its citizens are only granted citizenship for the duration of service in the state
 Those without dual citizenship will then get Italian citizenship

 In the eighth year of his reign, Kharavel traveled northwards to Vijay
 uttarapath main aage badhati hui uski sena ne baraabar pahadiyon main sthit gorthgiri ke durg par akraman kiya or use jitkar ve rajgrih pahunch gai
 While Kharavel was busy in these wars, the Yavanas of Bactria were also invading India
 bharat ke pashchim chakra ko apane adheen kar ve madhya desh main pahunch gaye the
 According to the article of Hathigumpha, Yavanaraja was frightened by the news of Kharavel's victories and left the idea of invading Madhya Pradesh and proceeded towards Mathura
 anek aitihaasikon ne yah pratipaadit kiya he, ki kharvel se bhaybheet hokar madhyadesh se waapas chale jane vaale is yavanraaja kaa naam dimit tha
 In the eleventh year of his reign, Kharavel invaded the south and reached the Tamil country on his Vijayatra
 vahaan par usne pithund ko jeeta or uske raja ko bhent uphaar pradaan karne ke liye vivash kiya
 The inscription of Hathigumpha mentions the confederation of the Tamil country defeated by Kharavel
 apane shasankaal ke gyarahawein varsh main kharvel ne ek baar phir uttarapath par akraman kiya or apni sena ke ghodon or haathiyon ko gangaajal snaan karaayaa
 He forced the king of Magadha to fall at his feet and brought back the Kalinga, the idol of Mahavir Swami, Pataliputra, taken from King Nand Kalinga
 is murti ke atirikt anya bhi bahut—si lut kharvel magadh se apane rajya main le gaya or uskaa upyog usne bhubaneshwar main ek vishaal mandir ke nirmaan ke liye kiya, jiskaa ullekh brahmand puraana kii urisa main praapt ek hastlikhit prati main bhi vidyaman he
 According to many historians, the king of Magadha who was forced by Kharavel to fall on his feet was debated
 unhone hathigumpha shilaalekh main is raja ke naam ko padhane kaa praytn bhi kiya he
 But not all scholars agree with this text
 shri jaiswal ne hathigumpha shilaalekh main ullikhit magadh ke raja ke naam ko bahestimit maanakar use pushyamitra shunga kaa paryaayavachi pratipaadit kiya he or yah mana he ki kalingraj kharvel ne shungavanshi pushyamitra par akraman kar use parrast kiya tha
 But many are not willing to accept the name in the historical Hathigumpha, nor to confuse it with Pushyamitra
 par isamen sandeh nahin ki hathigumpha shilaalekh ke anusaar kharvel ne uttarapath par akraman karte hue magadh kii bhi vijay kii thi or vahaan ke raja ko apane sammukh jhukne ke liye vivash kiya tha
 This story of Digvijay and the flourishing of Kharavel's power is undoubtedly of great importance

 With Pluto, a person in power is in the same way as an electric transformer, he carries eleven thousand volts of electric power in the form of big power, and gives it further as per need but when depositing it gives more Time is definitely hot, in the same way that a person powerful with Pluto, through his practices, by his teachings, by his mental and physical experiments, Is the time to collect the powers of his Tpbl in your case pitted the Gbl but the deposit and to the right of it is in a buildup of heat, called the man's ego or ego
 isi prakaar se vyakti jab apane andar us shakti ko jamaa kar letaa he, jo ek bahut bade samooh ko bhi jaruri hoti he, jaise ek adhyaaapak kaa gyaan, vaigyanik kaa shodh aadi
 Pluto also gives into the person the powers by which he generates further offspring, acquiring Pluto's superior importance of subordinate powers, the worst importance being the lowering of high thoughts and powers, such as a seeker first exerting his powers
 So it accumulates, but by giving wrong opinion to people under the influence of temptation or greed or weighing the power as money, that superior power is c Tries to rant, and within a few days is discredited by the law or by a manipulative person, that is, to bring down the high frequency, and the native of Pluto's great idea series has a sense of international upbringing

 Just as an electrical engineer puts his hand in electricity to earn money, but he has only two routes, either to get a huge amount after fixing an electrical appliance or a power line, or by taking a risk
 Taking the loss of your body, Pluto of this sense recommends to work with patience, it is advised to keep the power inside, the power of knowledge within those powers, which is the perfect learning Pluto, towards this sense, dares to eliminate the useless powers that are flourishing in mental, physical and materiality, as well as to become extremely rich, to live in a relaxed manner, to aspire to modernity , The psyche also gives Pluto of the second sense

 The Kakori incident was a historic incident of looting the treasury of the British government to buy weapons with the intention of waging a fierce war against the British Raj by the revolutionaries of the Indian independence struggle, which took place on 9 August 1925
 is train dakaiti main germany ke bane chaar mouzar pistaul kaam main laaye gayi the
 The specialty of these pistols was that they could be used as a rifle with another log made of wood behind the butt
 hindustan republican association ke keval das sadasyon ne is puri ghatana ko anjaam diya tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil had planned to loot the treasury of the English government during the meeting in Shahjahanpur in view of the need for immediate arrangement of funds to give impetus to the freedom movement being run by the revolutionaries

 Later the British government prosecuted a total of 40 revolutionaries of his party Hindustan Republican Association for waging an armed war against the emperor, looting the government treasury and killing the passersby, Rajendranath Lahiri, Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh
 The death sentence was pronounced
 is mukademen main 16 anya krantikariyon ko kam se kam 4 varsh kii sajaa se lekar adhiktam kaala pani tak kaa dand diya gaya tha
 Both the leaders of the party who reached Bengal to publish the advertisement and its constitution published by Hindustan Prajatantra Sangh were arrested in Bankura when they were going to post this advertisement

 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party even earlier, but now that requirement has increased even more

 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko atyadhik ksht hua
 After all, he made sure that he would now rob only the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India

 In addition to pistols, these revolutionaries also had four German-made mauzers, with a butt in the butt, it looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front

 Stopping at the Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as the car moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment

 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly suppressed Mauger's trager, causing the missing bullet to a passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left to run away from there
 agle din akhabaaron ke madhyam se yah khabar puure sansar main fail gayi
 The British government took this train robbery seriously and under the leadership of CID Inspector Tasadduk Hussain, tasked the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland

 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur, it was found that the chadar belonged to Banarsilal
 bismil ke saajheedaar banarsilaal se milakar police ne is dakaiti kaa sara bhed praapt kar liya
 The police also came to know from him that the people of Ram Prasad 'bismil' party from Shahjahanpur had gone out of the city on 9 August 1925 and when did they come back? When intelligence was fully confirmed that Ram Prasad 'bismil', who was the leader of Hindustan democracy union, was not in the city that day, on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was arrested along with 40 people from all over India
 Was taken is aitihaasik maamle main 40 vyaktiyon ko bharat bhar se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Their names along with the place of arrest are as follows: faraar krantikariyon main se do ko police ne baad main giraftaar kiya tha

 a separate supplemental lawsuit was filed against both of them
 kakori-kand main keval 10 log hi vaastavik rup se shaamil hue the, police kii ore se un sabhi ko bhi is cese main namjad kiya gaya
 Five of these 10 people - except Chandrashekhar Azad, Murari Sharma, Keshav Chakraborty, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi, who did not come to the hands of the police till that time, all the others were named in the government vs Ram Prasad Bismil and others
 Historical trial took place and he was sentenced from 5 years of imprisonment to execution

 The Special Magistrate Ainuddin had left no stone unturned to tarnish the image of each revolutionary and collected convincing evidence and witnesses before sending the case to the sessions court so that if there is any appeal from the accused later So do not let any of them leave without punishment
 lakhanu jail main kakori shadyantr ke sabhi abhiyukt kaid the
 The case was going on, during this time, the festival of Basant Panchami came
 sab krantikariyon ne milakar tay kiya ki kal basant panchami ke din ham sabhi sar par pili topi or haath main pilaa roomaal lekar court chalenge
 He told his leader Ram Prasad 'bismil' - "pandit ji! Write a ripping poem for tomorrow, we will all sing it together
" " agle din kavita taiyaar thi; My color de Basanti Chola xxrep 4

 After the sacrifice of Bismil, this creation became the mantra of all revolutionaries
 jitani rachana yahan di ja rahi he ve log utani hi gaate the
 The desire for goodness is now in our heart, to see how much emphasis is on the side! Let the time come and tell you, o hope, what can we tell from now, what is in our heart! It has brought us hopeful of murder, loved ones
 Today the battle is in cooch-e-qatil! o shaheed-mulko-miltat, i am reliant on you, now your courage is discussed in a non-existent journey! Now neither are the next batsmen nor the crowd of desires, only the eraser Now in Dile-'bismil! paanch faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan ko dilli or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bhagalpur se police ne us samay giraftaar kiya jab kakori-kand ke mukhya mukademe kaa faisla sunaaya ja chukaa tha
 a supplementary case of the Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge JRW Bainet and on 13 July 1927, both of them hanged Ashfaq Ulla Khan and accused Shachindranath Bakshi of life imprisonment, accusing them of conspiring against the government
 She went
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke0si0 dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendranath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' made his own defense as he was given a simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra at the government's expense, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 At this, Chief Justice Louis Shirts had to ask Bismil in English - "mr
 Ramprasad! From bhich university you have taken the degree of la?" At this, Bismil had laughed and replied to the Chief Justice - "excuse me sir! a king maker did require an Anne degree
" " The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow
 pandit jagatnarayan mullah sarkari vakil ke saath urdu ke shaayar bhi the
 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laae hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often
 " unke kehane kaa matlab spashth tha ki mulajim ve nahin, mullah ji hai jo sarkaar se tankhwaah pate hai
 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him
 saath hi yah taakid bhi kii ki ve samudr tak kii lehren apane dussahas se palatney kaa dam rakhte hai; mukademe kii baaji palatnaa koun cheez? itnaa bolne ke baad kiski himmat thi jo unke aage thahartaa
 Mulla ji was left with sweat and he thought good in cutting the trowel
 ve chupchaap pichley daravaaje se khisak liye
 Then he did not cross-examine any other day
 aise hazirajabaab the bismil! The debate on cleanliness by Bismil caused sensation in the government section
 mullah ji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se pairvi karne main anakani kii
 Therefore, the court rejected Bismil's plea for self-advocacy on 18 July 1927
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii jise dekhakar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the same Lakshmishankar Mishra was allowed to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 yah bhi adaalat or sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah kii mili bhagat se kiya gaya
 Because if Bismil were allowed to contest the entire case himself, the government would surely lose the case
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendranath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai0pi0si0 kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindranath Sanyal, expressing his remorse in writing when he was in jail, had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action, on the basis of which his life-term remained intact
 unke chote bhai bhoopendranath sanyaal va banavaari laal ne apana-apana jurm kabool karte hue court kii koi bhi sajaa bhugatne kii andertaking pehle hi de rakhi thi isaliye unhone apil nahin kii or donon ko 5-5 varsh kii sajaa ke aadesh yathaavat rahe
 Despite appeals to the Chief Court, the decorations of Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Mukundi Lal and Govindcharan Kar were increased from 10 to 10 years in life imprisonment
 sureshchandra bhattacharya va vishnusharan dublish kii sajaayen bhi 7 varsh se badhaakar 10 varsh kar di gayi
 Ramakrishna Khatri also remained sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Another accused Ram Dulare Trivedi was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment in this case
 avadh chif court kaa faisla aate hi yah khabar dawanal kii tarah samooche hindustan main fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore proposed to reduce the punishment of all the prisoners of death sentence of Kakori in Central Legislative Council to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor hua karte the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya ki in chaaro kii sajaaye-maut maaf kar di jaye parantu usne us prarthana ko asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council gave a signature memorial to the then Viceroy and Governor General, Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, going to Shimla, which was prominently displayed by Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant etc
 He had signed, but he had no effect on the Viceroy
 iske baad madan mohan malviya ke netritv main paanch vyaktiyon kaa ek pratinidhi mandal shimla jaakar vysarai se dobaaraa mila or unase yah prarthana kii ki chunki in chaaro abhiyukton ne likhit rup main sarkaar ko yah vachan de diya he ki ve bhavishya main is prakaar kii kisi bhi gatividhi main hissaa na lenge or unhone apane kiye par pashchaatap bhi prakat kiya he atah ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay par punarvichaar kiya ja saktaa he kintu vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, Barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent documents of clemency petition in Privy Council to England's famous lawyer SL Polak, but the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued that Ram Prasad 'bismil was the architect of this conspiracy
 'if he is granted a pardon, he is a very dangerous and professional criminal, then he will be bigger and more dangerous in future
 Can e
 us sthiti main bartania sarkaar ko hindustan main hukumat karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 Ultimately, the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected
