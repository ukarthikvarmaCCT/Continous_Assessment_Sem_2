 Spermicidal is a contraceptive substance that destroys sperm before insertion into the vulva, before sexual intercourse, and thus, it prevents pregnancy
 garbh nirodhak ke prayojan main, shukranunashak akele bhi istemaal kiye ja sakate he
 However, by using only spermicides, couples have higher pregnancy rates - compared to other methods
 Commonly, spermicides are used combined with other contraceptive inhibition methods - such as diaphragm, condoms, cervical cap, and sponge combined methods are more successful in reducing pregnancy rates than any method alone
 shukranunashkon asugandhit, spasht, ni-swaad, non-stenning or snehak hote hai
 The most common, active spermicidal ingredient is nonoxynol-9
 nonoxynol-9 yukt shukranunashkon kai roopon main uplabdh he - jaise jaili, film or jhaag; lekin ech

 It has been shown in the laboratory that lemon juice stabilizes the sperm - and also the "crest bitter lemon" drink
 Whereas, the authors of the Crest Bitter Lemon Drink study suggest that it may be used as an intercourse douche; But it is unlikely to be effective - because sperm, within 1

 Lactic acid preparations also show some spermicidal effects and commercial lactic acid based spermicides are available
 haalanki, 1936 ke baad, lactic acid ke garbh rokane main prabhaav par koi adhyayan prakashit prakat nahin kiya gaya he
 Thomas Moench, a former assistant medical professor, says the use of acid spermicides as research has just been abandoned
 prayogshaala ke adhyayan par aadhaarit - neem ke paudhe ke nishkarshan, neem tel shukranunashkon ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Based on animal studies, neem-derived vaginitis and creams show that they have a contraceptive effect
 lekin abhi tak, isaki, manushya main, garbhavastha rokane main nirdhaarit nahin kiya gaya he
 Spermicides are believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms
 haalaanki, nirmaataa jo condom ko shukranunashak se lubricket kiya karte he, wo condom garbhavastha ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin hote hai, kyon ki un main paryaapt shuranunaash nahin hota he
 These condoms have a short 'shelf life' in stores
 or ye mahilaon main mutr path sankramanon kii kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 The World Health Organization says that lubricated condoms with spermicides should no longer be promoted
 However, they recommend using lubricated - nonoxynol 9 on condoms other than not using condoms
 nonoxynol- 9 ke kai dushprabhav ho sakate hai
 These include itching or burning of the sexual organs and urinary tract infections in women, yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis
 These side effects are uncommon
 ek adhyayan main paaya gaya tha, ki jin mahilaon shukranunashkon kaa upyog karti hai, un main se keval 3-5 % dushprabhavon ke kaaran se unhen band karti hai
 There is also a concern that despite the use of spermicides, the risk of birth disorder is found more in children who take birth
 And those children, who were born to women who continued to use spermicide - unknowingly - even during pregnancy
 a 1990 study on spermicides concluded that "spermicidal users appear to have no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratios, and early pregnancy loss

 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods

 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he

 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc

 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev

 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna

 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart

 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus

 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power

 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake

 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope

 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light

 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya
 The Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published on 5 July 1687 with the financial help and encouragement of Edmund Healy
 is kaary main newton ne gati ke teen saarvbhaumik niyam die jinamein 200 se bhi adhik varshon tak koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He used the Latin word gravitas to that effect known as gravitation and defined the law of universal gravitation
 isi kaary main unhone vaayu main dhwani kii gati ke, boil ke niyam par aadhaarit pehle vishleshatmak pramaan ko prastut kiya
 He was criticized for Newton's concept of an invisible force that could operate over vast distances, as he merged "secret agencies" into science
 princepia ke saath, newton ko antarrashtriya khyaati mili

 unhone england kaa pramukh mudra dhallaai kaa kaary sambhaal liya, kisi tarah master lucas ke ishaaron par naachne lage Lucas's death in 1699 became Newton perhaps the best-known master of the mint, a position Newton held until his death
 These appointments were taken as an irresponsible position, but Newton took him seriously, taking his Cambridge duties in 1701 Retired and tried to improve the currency and punished the clippings and fake currency makers using their power
 1717 main taksaal ke master ke rup main "laa of queen ene" main newton ne anjaane main sone ke paksh main chaandi ke paise or sone ke sikke ke bich dwi dhatvik sambandh sthapit karte hue, pound sterling ko chaandi ke maanak se sone ke maanak main badal diya
 For this reason silver sterling coins were melted and shipped out of Britain
 newton ko 1703 main royal socity kaa adhyaksh or french acadmic des sciensej kaa ek sahyogi bana diya gaya
 While in his position in the Royal Society, Newton turned hostile to the astronomer John Flemsteed, he prematurely published Flemsteed's Historica Colestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies
 april 1705 main queen eni ne newton ko trinity college, cambridge main ek shahi yatra ke dauraan nite kii oopaadhi di
 This knight's title was not conferred upon Newton for his services as master of the mint nor for his scientific work, but for his political contributions during the parliamentary election in May 1705
 
 newton kii mrityu landan main 31 march 1727 ko hui, or unhen westminster ebbe main dafnaaya gaya tha
 His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduite, served as her hostess in social affairs at her house in Germain Street in London; He was her "very loving Uncle", which is mentioned in her letter written to her by Newton when she was recovering from smallpox
 newton, jinke koi bachche nahin the, unke antim varshon main unke rishtdaaron ne unki adhikansh sampatti par adhikaar kar liya or nirvasiyat hi unki mrityu ho gai
 After his death, a large amount of mercury was found in Newton's body, probably a result of his chemical business
 paare kii vishaaktata newton ke antim jivan main sanakeepan ko spasht kar sakati he
 French mathematician Joseph Lewis lagrange often said that Newton was the greatest genius and once said that he was "the most fortunate also because we cannot establish the world's system more than once
" Impressed by Newton's achievements, the English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous memoir: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 newton apni uplabdhiyon kaa bataane main khud sankoch karte the, farvari 1676 main unhone robert hook ko ek patr main likhaa: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants haalanki aamtaur par itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki uparokt panktiyaan, namrata ke saath kahe gaye ek kathan ke alaava – yaa bajaay –, hook par ek hamalaa thim 
 us samay prakaashikeey khojon ko lekar donon ke bich ek vivaad chal rahaa tha
 The latter interpretation is also appropriate with many other controversies over his discoveries, such as the question of who discovered the calculus, as noted above
 baad main ek itihaas main, newton ne likhaa: i do not know how i will appear to the world, but for myself i am a boy who is playing on the edge of the sea and concentrating now and then, a more smooth stone or a more beautiful Trying to find the shell, this great sea of truth has not been discovered before me

 he never made a public declaration of his personal faith — making this orthodoxy extremely radical
 unhone apane vishwaas ko itani acchhee tarah se chupaaya ki aaj bhi vidwaan unki nijee manyataon ko jaan nahin paayen hai
 "snowbelen concluded that Newton had at least one Socinian sympathizer, possibly an anti-trinity, almost certainly the Arrian
 —teen purvji rup jo aaj uniterianvaad kehalaate hai
 In an era noted for his religious intolerance, there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably, his refusal to obey holy orders, and to take the sacrament when he was about to die
 And he refused

 unhone bible ke andar chupe hue sandeshon ko khojane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 In his own lifetime, Newton wrote about religion more than natural science
 He believed in the rational world, but rejected the hylozoism inherent in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza
 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed cosmologies Was understandable and should be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine Time "writes Sipia i had an eye upon such principles, in order to be considered faith in God and man
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice
 " But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be necessary to improve the system due to the slow growth of instabilities

 The mechanical philosophy of Newton and Robert Boyle was promoted by the intellectual cleric as a viable alternative to conservatives and zealots and was accepted hesitantly by conservative campaigners and disgruntled campaigners, such as the Latitudinarians

 The attacks against pre-enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, found their foundation in Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe
 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles
 ye siddhant sabhi logon ke liye khojane hetu uplabdh hai, ye logon ko isi jivan main apane uddeshyon ko faldaayi rup se puraa karne kii anumati dete hai, agle jivan kaa intjaar nahin karte hai or unhen unki apni tarksangat shaktiyon se purna banaate hai
 Newton saw God as the chief creator, whose existence cannot be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation

 Despite this, it was very difficult to catch the most fiery criminals; However, Newton proved to be correct for this task
 By going disguised in the tavern and in jail, he gathered a lot of evidence himself

 He petitioned the Parliament to accept his plan for the minting of coins so that counterfeiting could not be committed, while at the same time forged coins appeared
 newton ne chalonor par jaalsaji kaa pareekshan kiya or sitambar 1697 main use new get jail main bhej diya
 But Chaloner had friends in high places, who helped him with his release
 newton ne duusari baar nirnaayak saboot ke saath us par parikshan kiya
 Chaloner was found guilty of high treason and was hanged and buried on 23 March 1699 at Tiburon Gallows

 According to Newton's second law, the force exerted on an object is f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec {, its momentum over time p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec { Is equal to the rate of change in
 ganitiya rup main ise nimnanusaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he Since the second law applies to an object of constant mass, the first term vanishes and by substitution using the definition of acceleration, the equation can be written as follows
 pehla or doosraa niyam arastu kii bhautikee ko todane kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jisamen aisa mana jaataa tha ki gati ko banaaye rakhane ke liye ek bal jaruri he
 They are a motive of the pace of the system in the state to change the state that only one power is needed
 newton ke sammaan main bal kii SI ikai kaa naam newton rakhaa gaya he
 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he
 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions
 ek anya udhaaharan he bandook kaa peeche kii or dhakka mahasoos karnaa, jisamen bandook ke dwaara goli ko daagne ke liye us par lagaaya gaya bal, ek baraabar or vipareet bal bandook par lagaataa he jise goli chalaane vaala mahasoos karata he
 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different
 arestu ke vipareet, newton kii bhautikee saarvatrik ho gayi he
 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
 mul vriksh kaa vanshaj trinity college, cambridge ke mukhya dwaar ke baahar uga hua dekha ja saktaa he, yah us kamare ke neeche he jisamen newton padhai ke samay rahata tha

 aap ise badhaakar vikipedia kii madad kar sakate he
 Drips irrigation or 'drip irrigation', is a special method of irrigation in which water and manure are saved
 is vidhi main pani ko paudhon kii jadon par buund-boond karke tapakaaya jaataa he
 For this purpose a network of valves, pipes, tubes and emitters have to be installed
 ise 'tapak sinchai' yaa 'buund-buund sinchai' bhi kehete hai
 Drip or droplet irrigation is an irrigation method in which water is transported to the roots of plants directly by plastic drains at short intervals
 paramparaagat satahi sinchai dwaara jal kaa uchit upyog nahin ho paata, kyonki adhiktar pani, joki paudhon ko milanaa chahie, jameen main ris kar yaa vashpikaran dwaara vyarth chalaa jaataa he
 Therefore, in order to make the right and full use of available water, an irrigation system is necessary through which water leakage is minimized and maximum water is available to the plant
 kam dabaav or niyantran ke saath sidhe fasalon kii jad main unki aavashyaktaanusaar pani dena hi tapak sinchai he
 The process of supplying fertilizer to plants through drip irrigation is called fertilization, which provides proper crop nutrition at the right time by curbing nutrient leaching and evaporation losses
 tapak sanyantra ke pramukh bhaag nimnanusaar hai- 1- header assembly 2- filters - hydrocyclone, sand or screen filters 3- Chemicals and fertilizers - venturi, fertilizer tanks 4- menline 5- Submen line 6- volve 7- Lateral line 8- emitors - online / inline / mini sprincolor / jetts Header assembly means bypass, non return valve, air release valve etc
 tapak sinchai kaa dabaav or gati niyantrit karne ke liye bypass assembly kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The drippers are likely to be closed due to soil particles, waste, algae etc
 present in the water
 is prakriya main screen filter, sand filter, sandseparator, setling tanks aadi kaa samavesh hota he
 Hydrocyclone filters should be used if there is sand or mud in the water
 pani main shaiwal, paudhon ke pattey, lakdi aadi sookshm jaivik kachra ho to sand filter dena jaruri he
 At least the screen filter should be used in the irrigation plant even if the water is completely clear
 sand filter kaa dhakkan kholkar baikwash chaalu karne ke baad filter ke andar haath se ret ko achche se todna chahie
 Allow the water coming from the filter out of the lid
 haath se ret saaf karte samay andar ke kaale rang ke filter eliments ko dhakka nahin laganaa chahie
 There is a possibility of sand going into the screen filter
 is dauraan bypass volve dwaara pani kaa pravaah nahinikle
 The sand filter should contain half of the sand
 ret kii maatr kam hone par punahnayi ret filter par ankit label tak bharna chahie
 Sand filter sands are fixed-sized pointed sand made from a specific method, rather than river-stream sand
 is ret se pani riste samay kachra ret main atak jaataa he
 This process does not occur with ordinary sand
 isaliye sand filter main kabhi bhi nadi-naale kii ret kaa istemaal na karen
 The fine waste not filtered by the sand filter gets stuck in the mesh of the screen filter
 dhire-dhire is kachare ke jamaa hone se jaali par ek parat ban jaati he
 This causes blockage in the work of counterfeiting
 jaali saaf karne se pehle donon taraf ke rabar sil nikaal kar, saaf karne ke pashchaat phir se jaali ke upar thik se feet karnaa chahie
 Otherwise water pressure can pass through the filtrate without water
 tapak sinchai dwaara rasinic khaadon kaa prayog venchuri, fertiliser tanks va fertiliser pump ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is used to transport water from the pump to the submen
 kuen kaa pani menline kii sahaayta se sabmen tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 PVC / HDPE pipes are used in the mainline
 menline kaa pani sabmen dwaara letral tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 PV-C / h-d-p-e-pipe is used for submen
 sabmen jameen ke andar kam se kam dedh se do feet kii gaharaai par rakhte hai
 The control valve at the beginning of the submen and the frush valve at the end are connected to control the pressure and flow rate speed
 pani kaa pravaah or daab niyantrit karne ke liye sabmen ke aage volve lagaaye jate hai
 It is necessary to install air release and vacuum release valves at the beginning of submen
 anyathaa pump band karne ke baad hawa ke saath mitti ke kan andar khinche jane se dripurs ke chhidr band ho sakate hai
 Submen's water is transported throughout the field by polytube
 har ek paudhe ke paas aavashyaktaanusaar politub ke upar dripper lagaaya jaataa he
 Letters are made from L-L-D-P-E-
 yah tapak sinchai kaa pramukh ang he
 The hourly flow and number of online / inline drippers is determined according to the maximum water requirement of the crop
 ubad-khabad jameen par pressure compenesetting dripurs lagane kii salaah di jaati he
 Mini sprinklers / jets: These can be mounted on top of polytubes with the help of extension tubes
 1- har din pump shuru karne ke baad, sanyantra kaa dabaav sthir hone par sand filter kii bacowashing karnaa chahie tathaa hydrocyclon aarambhik safai ke baad har 5-6 ghante yaa pani kii gunvattta ke anusaar samay-samay par filters safkarne chahie
 2- After the filter is cleaned, proper pressure should be controlled with the help of bypasswolves of the header assembly
 upyukt dabaav par chalane vaale sanyantra se pani sabhi jagah samaan maatr main miltaa he
 3- Inspect the fields and get them fixed immediately if there is any breakage or leakage
 paip muda hua yaa dabaa hua ho, to turant sidhaa karen
 4- Whether water falls properly from all drippers of drip plant, care should be taken
 5- tapak - sinchai purna hone ke baad zamin kaa geelaapan sabhi jagah ek jaisaa he yaa nahin, yah dekhnaa chahie
 6- Make sure that the drip is in place
 7- lentral / inline kaa antim chor kholkar pani ko 1-2 minute yahaan se baahar nikalne den

 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30
 It was resolved to attain full swaraj by hoisting the tricolor

 Mahadev followed Indian culture and ideas very strictly
 keshav ke maanas-patal par bade bhai mahadev ke vichaaron kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha
 But he had revolutionary ideas from childhood itself, rather than older brother

 As soon as he did his medical career, he realized his sharp leadership talent and was nominated as Vice President of the Hindu Mahasabha Bengal region
 kalkatte main padhai karte hue unka mail-milaap bengal ke krantikariyon se hua
 Since Keshav lived in Calcutta at the home of his elder brother Mahadev's friend Shyam Sundar Chakraborty, the local people used to know and address him by the name of Keshav Chakraborty
 unki asaadhaaran yogyata ko maddenjar rakhte hue unhen pehle anushilan samiti kaa saadhaaran sadsy banaaya gaya
 After that, when he stood the test of efficiency, he was also made an internal member of the committee

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Called a meeting of Hindu leaders, including Dr
 Hedgewar and Dr
 Paranjpe, in this meeting they decided to make a hindu-militia, the aim was to "protect Hindus and make Hindustan a strong Hindu nation"
 Dharamvir Dr
 Munje gave the responsibility of standing to Dr
 Keshav Baliram Hedgewar
 dosahab aise vyakti the, jinhone vyakti kii kshamtaaon ko ubhaarne ke liye naye-naye taur-tareeke viksit kiye
 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization
 is prakaar 28 / 9 / 1925 ko apane pita-tulya guru dow baalkrishna shivaram munje, unke shishy dow headgavar, shri paranjape or baapu sahib soni ne ek hindu yuvak club kii neenv daali, jiskaa naam kalantar main rashtriya swanyasevak sangh diya gaya l It is worth mentioning here that the basis of this militia was formed - Veer Savarkar's Rashtriya Philosophy book in which it was defined as Hindu - a indus-indus era, Yes India role
 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc
 Biographies were read l used to tell me to read portions of the book written by Savarkar l thode samay baad is milicia ko naam diya gaya rashtriya swanyasevak sangh- jo aar

 dow headgavar ne jis dukhad sthiti ko vyakt kiya, usamen navsarjeet rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or hindu mahasabha ke netritv ke prayaas se- hindu yuvaaon main saahas ke saath yah naaraa gunjane laga “hindusthan hinduon kaa- nahin kisi ke baap kaa” is kathan kii vivechna dow headgavar ne in shabdon main kii:- “many gentlemen do not hesitate to say how Hindusthan is only for Hindus? This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics

 In 1937, the Hindu Mahasabha was held in Karnavati

 Munje and Dr
 Hedgewar Hindu Mahasabhai and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh formed the basis of the interpretation of Hindu and Hindu nationalism propounded by Veer Savarkar, as well as the original mantra of Veer Savarkar- Untouchability
 The principle of prevention and militarization of Hindus was accepted

 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA

 The activity of the trillions of cells present in the body is determined by DNA
 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species

 These techniques can be adopted to conserve waste water through slopes, rivers and drains
 gali plag, parirekha baandh, gabian sanrachana, paristravan tanks, chack baandh / cement plag / naala band, punarbharan shaft, coop dag vail punarbharan, bhoomi jal baandh / upsatahi dike, aadi
 In rural areas, many structures can also be used to store rain-fed backwaters
 shahari kshetron main imaaraton kii chat, pakke va kachche kshretron se praapt varsha jal vyarth chalaa jaataa he
 This water can be recharged in aquifers and can be used in a beneficial manner in times of need
 varsha jal sanchayan kii pranali ko is tareeke se abhikalpit kiya janaa chahie ki yah sanchayan / ikattha karne va punarbharan pranali ke liye zyada jagah na ghere
 Some of the techniques of storing roof-derived rainwater in urban areas are as follows: recharge pit, recharge ditch, tube well and recharge well, etc
 bharat main mit jaleey kshetron, jaise rajasthan ke thar registan kshetra main log jal sanchayan se jal ekatrit kiya karte hai
 The roof-overhead water harvesting technique has been adopted here
 chhaton par varsha jal sanchayan karnaa saral evam sasti takanic he jo marusthalon main hajaaron saalon se chalaayi ja rahi he
 For the last two and a half decades, Barefoot College has been providing drinking water to over 3 crore people by collecting rainwater collected on the roofs of schools, in underground tanks, in schools and schools in fifteen-sixteen states
