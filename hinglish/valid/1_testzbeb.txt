 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him

 He was fluent in Sanskrit

 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying

 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity
 apane mahagranth satyarth prakaash main swamiji ne sabhi maton main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa khandan kiya he
 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta

 There Devendranath Thakur and Keshav Chandra Sen gave him a big welcome

 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it

 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country

 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857

 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country

 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge

 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, the British officers had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different kinds of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled

 Within a year of Padarohan, Abu Bakr ordered Khalid to mount 18,000 troops with a commander named Musanna to Iraq
 is sena ne irani shakti ko anek ladaaiyon main nasht karke babul tak, jo irani samrajya kii rajdhani madine ke nikat tha, apana aadhipaty sthapit kiya
 After this, Khalid traveled from Iraq towards Syria according to Abu Bakr and crossed the desert and joined 30,000 Arab soldiers and defeated 100,000 Bijantini forces in a place called Ajna Dain of Palestine
 kuch hi dinon baad abu bakr kaa dehanth ho gaya

 Idealism or idealism or suffixism is the consolidated ideology of ideas and beliefs according to which all things in this world are the expression of thought or consciousness
 sristi kaa saratatva jad padaarth nahin apitu mul chetana he
 Idealism presents the opposite form of inertia or materialism
 yah atmik-abhautik ke praathmik hone tathaa bhautik ke dwitiyak hone ke siddhant ko apana aadhaar banaata he, jo use desh-kaal main jagat kii parimitata or jagat kii ishwar dwaara rachana ke vishay main dharm ke jadsutron ke nikat pahunchaata he
 Idealism sees consciousness as separate from nature, which consequently makes the process of human consciousness and cognition essentially mystical and often moves towards skepticism and agnosticism
 kuch vichaarkon ke anusaar munashya or anya praaniyon main pramukh bhed yah he ki manushya pratyayon kaa prayog kar saktaa he or anya praaniyon main yah kshamta vidyaman nahin
 The dog sees two humans, but never sees 2

 The existence of scientific suffixes like number, quality, quantity, etc
 is unquestionable, but the existence of moral suffixes is a matter of dispute
 ham kehete hai- 'aaj mausam bahut acha he'
 Here we describe goodness and with it point out the lack of goodness
 isi prakaar kaa bhed karmo ke sambandh main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Moral suffix is also called ideal
 adarsh ek aisi sthiti he, jo- Some people attribute the value to human imagination
 jo vastu kisi kaaran se hamen aakarshith karti he, vah hamaari drushti main moolyawaan yaa bhadra he
 In contrast, in the idea of aflatun, only suffixes or ideals have a real existence, the existence of sight objects is only a shadow

 It is called 'disinterested'
 pracheen yunaan or bharat ke liye nickshreyas yaa sarvshereshth mulya ke swaroop kaa samajhnaa hi niti main pramukh prashn tha
 Regarding the nature of the Disinterested or Supreme Ideal, everyone agrees that it is related to consciousness, but as soon as we want to know which part of consciousness is mediocre, then differences arise
 kuch log kehete hai ki sukh kaa upbhog aisa mulya he
 Some assign this designation to knowledge, intelligence, love or Shiva Sankalpa
 kuch is vikalp main ekwad ko chhodkar anekavaad kii sharan lete hai ore kehete hai ki ek se adhik vastuen sadhymoolya hai kisi vastu ke sadhymoolya hone yaa na hone kaa nirnay karne ke liye doctor moore ne nimnlikhit suzav diya haih kalpana karo ki do vikalpon me purna samanta he, sivaay is bhed ke ki ek vishesh vastu ek viplav main vidyaman he
 Whose existence in these two viplavas seems more appropriate? The object that makes one pandemonium more suitable than the other in such a situation is moderate

 Some other assumptions related to this are also valid for idealists

 Self-interest started with selfishness, but soon selfishness took its place in its cause

 On the other hand, Kant also said that in terms of absolute order, all human beings are equal, no human being is merely a means
 mrityu kii tarah naitik jivan sabhi bhedon ko mitaa detaa he
 No human being above duty, no human being deprived of rights

 Sukhvadis like John Stuart Mill also said, it is better to have an uncultivated Socrates than a satisfied boar
 mil ne yah nahin dekha ki is sweekruti main vah apane siddhant se hatakar adarshavaad kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Socrates has a spiritual part that is not present in the boar

 In Kant's view, the major part in human nature is the 'moral sense', he realizes that the demand for duty has more authority than all the rest, the moral order is the 'absolute order'
 is sweekruti ke saath naitik swadhinata kii sweekruti bhi anivaary ho jaati he
 'you must, so you can
 ' yogyata ke abhaav main uttardaayitv kaa prashn uth hi nahin saktaa
 Here a difficult situation is presented: is the moral ideal the accomplishment of the best or to go towards it? On attaining the state which we consider to be the best, we only get the best
 jahaan kahin bhi ham pahunche, truti ore apurnataa bani rahati he
 Kant himself has said that our ultimate aim is perfection and it requires eternity for its accomplishment
 kuch vichaarak to kehete hai ki apurnataa kaa kuch ansh rahanaa hi chahie
 Sorto says in his famous book 'moral Values':' Imagine that all values have been attained
 aisa hone par niti kaa kya banegaa? aage badhane ke liye koi adarsh rahegaa hi nahin
 Success will put an end to all efforts and in this way the moral ideal achieved will end in fulfilling life

 Education has been influenced by various philosophical ideologies since time immemorial, but idealism has had the greatest effect on it
 shiksha ke kshetra main adarshavaad ko pramukhataa dene waalon main sarvapratham plato, comenius, pastalogy tathaa frobel ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 According to the idealists, education is a 'consciousness' or 'intellectual process' that develops virtues in a child and makes him a natural being from a natural being
 saanskrithik paramparaayen evam gyaan is kriya ko sampann karne kaa saadhan hai
 The 'goal of accomplishment' of this action is to provide the student an opportunity to feel self-centered and to build their character
 is prakaar adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shiksha vah chetnapurna evam bauddhik prakriya he jisamen guru ke dwaara shishy ko aatmanubhuti karaayi jaati he
 This concept of education shows that education is not a one-way process but a process running between two poles in which one is a polar learner whose basic nature is refined and the other is the polarity teacher who is the basic nature of the child
 By refinement and conversion, it makes him aware of eternal values and ideals so that he moves from a natural being to a spiritual being
 Iwartit possible
 adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar manushya-jivan kaa antim uddeshy aatma-paramatma ke charam swaroop ko jaananaa he, isi ko aatmanubhuti, adarsh vyaktitv kii prapti, ishwar kii prapti tathaa param anand kii prapti kaha jaataa he
 According to the idealists, to know the extreme nature of the soul-god, a man has to cross four steps
 pratham sopan par use apane ‘prakritik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 On the second step, he has to develop his 'social self'
 tisare sopan par use apane ‘maansik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he tathaa antim sopan par use ‘aadhyatmik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 According to the idealistic ideology, human beings are the best creation of God, to whom he has given unlimited powers
 inhen vibhinn shaktiyon evam kshamtaaon ke yoga se vyaktitv kaa nirmaan hota he
 That is why the idealist thinkers consider raising the personality or the manifestation of the various supreme powers and abilities contained in it and taking it towards a good path
 spasht he ki vyakti kaa vyaktitv mahatvapurn hota he or vyakti ke bhautik sharir kii apeksha ‘aatma’ kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 Therefore, according to idealism, the aim of human life is to realize this 'soul'
 aatmanubhuti ke liye aatm-prakaashan bhi aavashyak he
 It is necessary to develop the 'social self' for self-publishing
 saamaajik swa ke vikaas kaa arth he-manushya samaaj dwaara sweekrut niyamon kaa paalan karata he, uski pasand saamaajik sweekruti-asweekruti par nirbhar karti he
 Idealists believe that man's greatest feature is his culture, living, customs, language literature, art music and values
 ye hi use prakritik ‘swa’ se saamaajik swa kii ore agrasar karte hai, samaaj evam vaataavaran ke saath bhaleebhanti samaayojan sthapit karne ke liye vyakti ko ‘aatm prakaashan’ kaa avasar milanaa aavashyak he
 Development of 'intellectual self' is essential for self-publishing
 yah vah sthiti hoti he jab manushya kaa vyavhaar saamaajik sweekruti-asweekruti se niyantrit na hokar uski buddhi evam vivek se niyantrit hota he
 Plato is of the view that a man's intelligence and conscience are the basis of all his ideals, acts and spiritual efforts
 bina buddhi ke gyaan nahin ho saktaa, bina gyaan ke vivek nahin ho saktaa or bina vivek ke satya-asaty, shiv-ashiv evam sundar-asundar main bhed nahin kiya ja saktaa he tathaa satyam shivan sundaram kii prapti nahin kii ja sakati he
 With self-realization, we see the real truth
 adarshavaadiyon kaa vishwaas he ki jab manushya apane ‘prakritik swa’ evam ‘saamaajik swa’ se upar uthakar apane ‘bauddhik swa’ main niyantrit hone lagata he to vah dhire-dhire swatah ‘aadhyatmik swa’ ke kshetra main pravesh karne lagata he
 Plato is of the view that man's tendency is inclined towards Satya, Shiva and Sundaram
 vah sadaiv satya kii khoj main tatpar rahata he or jo kalyankari evam sundar he, use sweekaar karata he tathaa jo kalyankari evam sundar nahin he, uskaa tyaag karata he
 Idealists insist on training humans in this process
 uparyukt lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye shaniah shaniah drushtikon main parivartan laana aavashyak he
 The goal of education should be to get rid of the objectivity of this material world
 kaha bhi gaya he- That is, education is the one who provides liberation
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki aise vyaktitv kaa charam vikaas hi adarshavaadi shiksha kaa uddeshy he jisamen vyakti aatmanubhuti kar satyam, shivan tathaa sundaran kii prapti kar sake
 Realization of self realization is not a natural gift, so one should try to achieve it through constant practice and effort
 adarshavaadi vichaaron ne shiksha ke uddeshyon kaa hi nirdhaaran nahin kiya he apitu uske liye upyukt paathyakram ke swaroop ko bhi nirdhaarit kiya he
 Because achieving the objectives of education is possible only when the curriculum is also according to it
 adarshavaad vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa utkarsh athwa aatmanubhuti ke shaashvat aadarshon kii prapti tathaa saanskrithik bhautik jagat ko antim satya nahin maanata kintu satya kaa abhas to maanata hi he isi bhautik jagat main rahakar evam bhautik vaataavaran ke sahyog se hi adarshavaad charam satya ko praapt karne kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 The spiritual environment of man is more important but natural environment cannot be ignored
 vyakti sharir or man kaa sanyog hota he or isamen man adhik mahatvapurn hota he
 But idealists believe that if physical needs are not met, mental activity will also become painful
 vyakti aatmanubhuti kii ore tabhi bad saktaa he jab uskaa shaareerik vikaas ho chukaa hota he
 Therefore, knowledge of the physical world is necessary
 unani darshanik plato ke anusaar shiksha kaa charam lakshya ishwar kii prapti he
 Therefore, emphasis should be given on including the same subjects in the curriculum through which the said goal can be achieved
 is lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye sarvapratham satyam, shivan tathaa sundaran in teenon tatwon ko praapt karnaa aavashyak he
 These three spiritual values are attained by the intellectual, moral and artistic activities of man respectively
 atah plato paathyacharya main unheen vishyon evam kriyaaon ke samavesh par bal dete hai jo maanav ko uparyukt kriyaaon main dakshata pradaan kare
 He has said that language, literature, history, geography, mathematics and physical science are important for intellectual activities
 naitik kriyaaon ke liye dharm, nitishastra, tathaa aadhyatmashaastra kaa or kalatmak kriyaaon ke liye vibhinn kalaon tathaa sangeet kaa samavesh kiya tha
 Idealist thinker Horn sir looks for solid grounds in determining the character of a person under ideal society
 atah unke anusaar ve sabhi anubhav, kriyaayen tathaa jivan kii paristhitiyaan aadi jo adarsh kii purnataa kii ore hamen le jaati hai
 They should give important place in the syllabus
 unka vichaar he- In other words, he has recommended inclusion of subjects related to earning and earning
 german shikshashasthri harbart manushya kii aadhyatmik unnati ke liye charitra evam naitik vikaas par bal dete hai or uske liye paathyacharya main bhashaa, sahitya, itihaas, kala tathaa sangeet ko mukhya sthaan dete hai
 According to him, geography, mathematics and science should be given secondary place in the curriculum
 yadhyapi tii0pi0 nan mahoday ne shiksha ke vyaktivaadee uddeshy kaa prabal samarthan kiya he kintu paathyakram-nirmaan ke sambandh main ve adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke samarthak hai
 He is of the view that the duty of the school is not merely to impart a certain type of formal education but it is his duty to support the advancement of the spiritual power of his society and nation
 uske aitihaasik kram evam samskritiyon ko surakshit rakhe or uske bhavishya ko nirantar ujjwal banane kaa safal praytn karen
 Therefore, the child should be trained in school for two major activities - one is the actions which will advance the personal and social life of the child and the other are those activities which determine the initial nature of human civilization
 saranshtah yah kaha jaataa he ki adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shiksha ke paathyakram main sthirataa na hokar gatishiltaa honi chahie, jisase baalkon kii aavashyaktaanusaar unamem parivartan kiya ja sake
 From this point of view, while idealists give importance to physical education in their curriculum, on the other hand, for the knowledge of the natural environment, subjects like physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, geology, botany, biology etc
 balak ke atmik vikaas ke liye kala, sahitya nitishastra, dharm-darshan, sangeet ityadi vishyon ko adarshavaadi adhik mahatvapurn maanate he
 It is often thought that idealism determines the goals and objectives of education, not the teaching method
 parantu vaastaviktaa yah he ki adarshavaad shiksha ke uddeshyon evam aadarshon par adhik bal dete hue bhi shiksha paddati kii avhelnaa nahin karata he
 According to the idealist ideology, the teaching method should be such that the personality of the child can be developed
 kisi bhi shikshan paddati ko uttam tabhi kaha ja saktaa he jabaki vah baalkon ko apni buddhi, yogyata, ruchi, shakti, samarthy evam aavashyaktaa ko drushti main rakhte hue inhen gyaan pradaan karne main sahaayak siddh ho sake
 According to idealism, once a person has clearly defined the purpose of education, then it becomes secondary that by which methods he will achieve those objectives
 atah jab jo pravidhi shikshak athwa shikshaarthi ke liye upyukt ho, tab use angikaar kar lene main koi haani nahin
 That is why he does not hesitate to adopt the game system
 frobel ne shikshan paddati ko multah ‘aatm-prerit kriya’ mana he
 Education by sport is also a distinction of education through self-action
 khel ke vishay main frobel ne likhaa he- 'khel balak ke liye uske antarjagat evam vahya-jagat kaa darpan he
 This is a tendency to express life and passion
 ' Idealists respect ancient literature
 ve maanate hai ki hamaare pracheen sahitya main purvajon dwaara khoja hua gyaan bharaa padaa he, hamen usase laabh uthaanaa chaiye
 He favors the 'swadhyaya Vidhi' for the study of ancient literature
 parantu is vidhi kaa prayog shiksha ke ucch str par hi ho saktaa he
 Western idealist thinkers have developed many teaching methods
 aajkal ‘prashnottar-vidhi’ kii vishesh charchaa rahati he
 Idealists such as Socrates used this method 450 years before Christ
 sucraat kii shikshan – vidhi upyukt prashnon dwaara vaartalap par aadhaarit thi
 Socrates' disciple Plato also followed the Socratic method
 plato ne prashnottar vidhi ke aadhaar par samvaad vidhi kaa vikaas kiya
 Plato also wrote most of his compositions in dialogue form
 plato ke shishy arestu ‘aagaman’ evam nigaman vidhiyon par bal dete the
 In the incorporation method, 'from the general to the special' and in the arrival method 'from the special to the general'
 aadhunik adarshavaadi darshanikon main hegal ne ‘tark-vidhi’, pastalogy ne ‘abhyaas vidhi’ tathaa rene decort ne ‘saral se jatil’ kii ore chalane main apni ruchi pradarshit kii
 The idealist does not consider the 'lecture method' or study method to be unacceptable
 saakshaat anubhav shreshth he, kintu vishwa kii sabhi vastuon kaa gyaan pratyaksh anubhav dwaara praapt karnaa maanav ke liye asambhav he
 Therefore, the idealist sees no harm in benefiting from the experience of another
 isliye wahi-kahin par vyaakhyaan vidhi ko apnaane main bhi adarshavaadi nahin hichakataa he
 He also takes shelter of collective discussion and advises to take refuge in the debate method to clarify important topics
 jahaan shishuon ko ‘katha vidhi’ dwaara shiksha dene kaa adarshavaadi prastaav karata he vahiin kishoron ko ‘naatak-vidhi’ evam ‘vaartalap- vidhi’ se shiksha dene kii vakaalat karata he
 Harbart has taken shelter of 'panchapadi' to bring new knowledge to the students
 prasiddh adarshavaadi pastalaji ke anusaar shikshan 44vidhi mastishk ke vikaas ke anuhvap honi chahie or unhone apni vidhi ko ‘aanshang’ ke naam se pukaara he
 Pastology has given its method of abstract number, form and language
 prakrutivaadee shikshak ko shikshan-prakriya main naganya samajhate hai or unhen parde ke peeche hi rahane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Idealist thinkers say the opposite
 adarshavaad ke anusaar shikshak kaa sthaan shikshan prakriya main sarvopari he
 The teaching process is not mechanical
 isamen ek vyaktitv kaa duusare par prabhaav padataa he
 The child who is ultimately a person - not a body, his development is possible only through an impressive personality
 isliye shikshak kaa vyaktitv prabhaavshaalee hona chaiye
 At birth, the child has many powers latent
 shikshak kaa kaary in sushupt shaktiyon ko jaagrath karnaa he
 In Indian idealism, giving the best place to the teacher, calling him 'tridev', it has been said that - 'gururbrahma, Gururvishnu, Gurudevo Maheshwara' means Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar
 isi prakaar atharvaveda ke ‘brahmacharya sookt’ main acharya ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki ‘aacharyon mrityurvarunah, som oshadhyah-praayah
 'that is, the Guru destroys the old rites and imparts new samskaras and gives new life to the child, hence he is called the mortuary
 guru man ke kusanskaron ko dho detaa he isliye use varun kaha gaya he
 He leads the way to peace
 isliye som ke samaan tathaa kathinaayee rupi rogon se dur karne ke kaaran use aushadhi kii sangya di gayi
 Therefore, idealistic thinkers emphasize the need of a teacher for the internal or spiritual development of the child
 shiksha-vyavastha main shikshak chaatr ke jivan kaa maarg-darshak hota he
 He gives them the opportunity to develop their natural powers in the right direction by following proper guidance
 shikshak shikshan-prakriya kii dhuree he
 Without it, the teaching process will be incomplete
 adarsh evam lakshya tathaa jivan ke mulya pehle se hi vidyaman hai
 According to Plato, they already exist
 shikshak kaa yah daayitv he ki vah baalkon ke sarvonmukhi vyaktitv ke vikaas kaa prayaas kare taaki ve apane lakshyon ko saralata se praapt kar saken
 In this way, idealistic thinkers emphasize the need for a teacher to convert a child from a natural being to a social and spiritual being
 suprasiddh adarshavaadi frobel ne vidhyalay rupi upavan main balak rupi sukomal paudha ke sarvottam vikaas ke liye shikshak hvapi mali kii ati aavashyaktaa bataaya he
 According to idealism, for proper development of 'learner', representing the place of 'teacher' has written- shikshak ke atyadhik mahatv ke kaaran hi adhikansh vidwaan adarshavaadi shiksha ko ‘shikshak kendrit shiksha’ kii sangya dete hai
 In idealism, discipline is considered necessary for appropriate education
 adarshavaadi vichaarak shiksha main anushaasan ke kathor pakshpaati hai
 According to this ideology, the child should not be given complete freedom
 is sambandh main adarshavaad evam prakrutwad main bhinn mat hai
 Naturalists believe more in freedom of education
 jabaki adarshavaadi shiksha- anushaasan main
 In this regard, Thomas and Lang wrote - "the slogan of naturalists" is freedom
 jabaki adarshavatiyon kaa naaraa anushaasan he
 "idealist thinkers believe that giving complete freedom to a child is more likely to harm, less to gain
" atah balak ko simit swatantraaa hi pradaan kii jaay
 Idealism emphasizes discipline, but is not in favor of repressive discipline because the discipline established by rigorous control and established by oppressive means is often terrible
 isliye anushaasan kaa swaroop prabhavatmak hota he
 For this, idealism gives importance to the development of moral qualities
 naitik gunon ke vikaas ke liye namrata, eemaandaaree, samay kii paabandi, aagyaakaarita, satyavadita ityadi gunon kaa vikaas aavashyak he jo anushasanpurn vaataavaran main hi sambhav he
 In idealistic conception, the establishment of discipline in the child is possible only by the development of 'self-motivated interest', because the child who has his own interest, accepts the same interest
 is
 chunki anushaasan ruchi par aadhaarit hota he
 Hence, its inspiration also comes from within
 vyakti, jis kaary ko aatm vibhor hokar karegaa vahaan uchhrikhanlata, udandta athwa anushaasanheenataka koi sthaan nahin he
 Discipline will naturally be established there
 anushaasan ke sambandh main adarshavaad kii ek anya manyata yah he ki yah puraskaar athwa dand se sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The child does not do any good work in the greed of the prize
 sadgunon ke liye puraskaar kii vyavastha bhi vidhyalay main nahin honi chaiye
 There is no need to ask for any truth
 yah to maanav kartavya hi he
 It must be done
 balak koi kaary isliye karata he ki uski us kaary main vaastavik ruchi hoti he tathaa usase use vaastavik anand kii prapti bhi hoti he
 In this way the foundation of 'atmanushasan' is laid in the child and in the course of time he remains disciplined
 adarshavaadi pastalogy ke anusaar balak ke prati sahanubhuti barti jaye
 According to Froebel, control over the child should be done on the basis of knowledge of his interest and by publishing sympathy and love, because the inspiration of discipline comes from within
 is mat kii pushti main horn mahoday kaa yah kathan uchit prathit hota he ki ‘anushaasan kaa prarambh vahya rup se hota he kintu ant aatm-niyantran dwaara aantarik rup main ho
 ' kisi vastu, kriya athwa vichaar kaa moolyankan kinhi purv nishchit mandandon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 These standards can be personal as well as social, psychological as well as scientific as well as inferior and multifaceted
 jo mandand jitna adhik vastunishth hota he or jitne adhik vyaktiyon ko maanya hota he
 That is considered to be a good criterion
 yahan aisa hi prayaas kiya gaya he or adarshavaadi shiksha kaa moolyankan bhartiya samaaj kii vartmaan paristhitiyon or bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon evam aakankshaon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 If we evaluate the idealism in the context of the ideas presented by the idealists in relation to the various organs of education mentioned above, we get to know many of its merits and demerits
 shiksha ke sandarbh main adarshavaad ke prabhaav, gun athwa yogadan nimnlikhit hai- The objectives of education proposed by the idealists build the best character of children
 unhone shiksha kaa ek ullekhneey uddeshy baalkon main satyam, shivan evam sundaran aise gunon kaa vikaas mana he jo achche charitra ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Idealism has played a very important role in determining the objectives of education
 adarshavaadi vichaarkon ke anusaar balak ek shastreey praani ke rup main kuch mul pravritiyon ko lekar janm letaa he or use samaaj kaa susanskrit sadsy banane ke liye shiksha hi ek mukhya saadhan he
 Therefore, they consider the objectives of education in detail
 adarshavaad shiksha main shikshak ko sarvopari sthaan pradaan karata he
 This gives the teacher a proud place in the education world as well as is essential for the benefit of both the child and society
 adarshavaad ne ‘aatmanushasan’ evam ‘aatmaniyantran’ ke aise siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he jinka anugaman kar aaj chaatro main badhati hui anushaasanheenata evam tanaav kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 In keeping with the interests of both the individual and society, ideal and personal values have been given equal importance in idealistic education
 adarshavaad ne apni shiksha-yojana main balak ke vyaktitv kaa aadar kar shiksha prakriya ke donon dhuravon arthath shikshak evam shikshaarthi ko mahatv diya he
 Influenced by idealism, all people today emphasize the 'ideal personality' of children
 adarshavaadi shiksha aadhyatmik, dharmik tathaa naitik gunon ke vikaas par adhik bal detii he
 In addition to the above qualities in idealistic education, some defects are also found
 adarshavaad ne shiksha ke jo uddeshy nirdhaarit kiye hai ve itane adhik ‘amoort’ tathaa sookshm hai ki ek saamaanya buddhi ke vyakti ko unako samajhnaa ati kathin he
 These intangible and subtle objectives are related to the future and not to the present
 yah darshan balak evam uski prakruti kii apeksha shikshak evam adarsh ko pradhanta detaa he or is prakaar ‘bal kendrit shiksha’ ‘bal kendrit paathyakram’ tathaa ‘bal kendrit shikshan paddati’ se sambandhit aadhunik vichaaron kii upeksha ho jaati he
 Which is not at all fair for today's era
 adarshavaad paathyakram main aadhyatmik vishyon par adhik mahatv detaa he or vyaavhaarik jivan se sambandhit vishyon par adhik dhyaan nahin diya he
 Such a course may prove beneficial for ancient ideal societies, but in today's industrial age, such a course is of no importance

 ginaney kaa paaramparik tarika yah rahaa he ki kisi "ganitr" ko samucchy ke har tatva ke liye ek se lagaataar badhaate rahanaa, kisi na kisi kram main, jabaki tab tak un tattvon ko chinhit karte rahanaa taaki usee tatva se ek se adhik baar bhent na ho, jab tak koi achinhit tatva na bachein; yadi pehle vastu ke baad ganitr ek par sthapit tha, to antim vastu se bhent ke baad jo mulya aata he, vah tattvon kii vaanchit sankhya detaa hai
 Related term calculation refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element of the set
 puratathvik sakshya hai jo suzav dete hai ki insaan kam se kam 50,000 varshon se ginati kar rahaa hai
 Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as the number of group members, hunter animals, property, or debt
 ginati ke vikaas ne ganitiya sanketan, sankhyank paddatiyon or lekhan ke vikaas ko janm diya
 Calculations can be done in different types
 gananaa shabdic ho sakati he, arthath har sankhya ko jor se bolnaa taaki pragati kaa trek rakhaa ja sake
 It is often used to count objects that exist, but also to count many things over time
 gananaa milan chinhon ke rup main bhi ho sakati he, jis main prayek sankhya ke liye ek chinh ankit kiya jaataa he or phir milan ke baad sabhi chinhon ko gina jaataa hai
 This proves useful when items have to be counted repeatedly over time, such as how many times something has happened throughout the day
 milan ekadhari gananaa he ; saamaanya gananaa aadhaar 10 main hoti he
 Computers perform binary calculations with zeros and 1s

 anagram shabdon kaa ek khel he, jisamen kisi shabd yaa vaakyansh ke aksharon ko punah vyavasthit karke ek nayaa shabd yaa vaakyansh bananaa hota he or is khel main sabhi mul aksharon kaa keval ekbar upyog karne kii anumati hoti he; udaa
 orchestra = carthorse, a decimal point = I'm a dot in place
 anagram banane vaale ko anagramatist kehete hai
 The root word or phrase is known as the subject of anagram
 koi bhi shabd yaa vaakyansh jo varnon ko thik duusare kram main utpann karata he, vah anagram kehalaata he
 However, the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to create anagrams that somehow reflect or comment on the subject
 is tarah ke anagram apane vishay ke upshabd yaa viparitarthak shabd, ek parody, ek aalochana, yaa ek prashansa ho sakate hai; jaise, jorge bush = hi bagz gore ; madonna louis sicon = okeonal neude inakam yaa van kool dance muzician ; villium shakespeare = aay em a vikish spiler, roger medos-tailor = great vards yaa melody 
 The construction of an anagram involves a letter, the pattern of which is to be stored
 ek nipun anagram main, prayek varna bilkul utani hi baar upyog hona chahie jitani baar vah mul shabd yaa vaakyansh main upyog hua he; koi bhi parinaam jisamen is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya ho, use apurna anagram kaha jaataa he
 Diacritics are usually disregarded and standard spellings are used
 anagram mosis ke samay main "themuru" yaa parivartan karne ke rup main dekhe ja sakate the, iskaa matlab hota tha naam kaa chupa hua yaa rahasyamay arth khojna

 Anagrams in Latin were considered saras for many centuries
 "est vir qui adest", jise neeche samajhaayaa gaya he, yah semul johnson kii a dictionari of da english languej main udhaaharan ke rup main udadhrut kiya gaya tha
 The meaning of any historical material on the anagram must always be seen in relation to the spelling and perception of the language at that time
 In English, in particular, the spelling gradually stabilized
 Attempts were made to regulate the anagram structure, one of the most significant in English was George Puttenham's The Anagram and Pozi Transposed in The Art of English Poise
 ek saahitiyik khel ke rup main jab latin saksharon kii saamaanya sampatti thi, tab latin anagram vishisht the: do udhaaharan hai, "ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum" kaa "virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata" main parivartan or pilette ke prashan, "quid est veritas?" kaa anagramatik uttar
, arthath, "est vir qui adest" 
 inkaa mul dastavej nahin kiya gaya he
 Latin continued to influence character values
 If all the varnas were used once, it was an ongoing tradition to allow anagrams to become "perfect", but allowing this exchange
 This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the Jesuits: the change of "societas Jesu" to "vitiosa seces", or "cut of the Wicked Things"
 In the period of Elizabeth i of England, Puttenham acquired Multa regnabis ense gloria, starting with Elissabet Anglorum Regina; He cautiously explains that h is "just a note of aspiration and not a letter" and that z in Greek or Yiddish is only a SS

O! a busie murther ke rup main likhaa gaya; jisamen ek ve kii ginati you ke rup main kii gai
 In an essay entitled On the Character of a Perfect Anagram, William Drummond of Hawthorndon tried to discount the allowed rules and possible characters
 William Camden defines "anagrams" as follows: "the solvation of a name, which is actually written in its characters as its elements, and a new relation to it by artificial substitution, which is the addition, subtraction or subtraction of any character Is without change and which makes the mastery experience favorable for the nominee

 Although making an anagram is definitely an act of entertainment at first, there are some ways to use anagrams and it can be more serious, or at least quite fickle or formless
 For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to determine the implicit memory of young adults and adult peers
 17 veen sadi ke prakritik darshanikon ne apni praathamikta kii sthapana karne ke liye apni khojon ko latin anagramon main badal diya

 In names such as farce or parody, anagrams as names may be used for a clear and satirical effect
 lekhakon dwaara apanaae gaye chhadam naam kabhi kabhi unke naamon ke pakshantarit rup hote hai; is prakaar "kelvins" "alkuinas" ban jaataa he yaa "francois reblais" = "alcophribase nasiar"
 francois mairi aroet kaa naam "voltare" is swaroop main uchit bethata he or use "aroet, ai je" yani "aroet da yangar" kaa anagram banane kii anumati he
 Other examples: "arrigo Boita" = "tobio Gorio"; "edward Gore" = "ogredad Wiery", = "regira Dowdy" or = "E
G
 Dedvery"; "vladimir Nabokov" = "vivian Darkbloom", = "vivian Bloodmark", = "blavdak Vinomori" or = "dorian Vivacomb"; "bryan Waller Procter" = "berry Cornwall, singer"; "bernardo Sourz" = "fernando Pesoya, singer"; "day Grammant" = "ted Morgan"; "dave Berry" = "ray Adverb"; "declan Gun" = Glenn Duncan; Dan Abnormal = Damon Albarn; And so on
 Many of these are "imperfect anagrams", with some characters omitted for easy pronunciation
 sheershakon ke liye istemaal kiye gaye anagramon main kuch prakaar kii haazirajavaabi ke liye gunjaaish hoti he
 Examples: anagram apane aap main hi ek manoranjak kriya he, lekin vah hamen kai anya khelon, paheliyon or khel pratiyogita kaarykram kaa bhaag bhi banaate hai
 Jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States, in which characters have to be sorted out and solved

 Sometimes it is possible to "see" anagrams in words without the aid of equipment, although the more characters involved the more difficult it becomes
 anagram shabdkoshon kaa istemaal bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Computer programs called "anagram server", "anagram solver", or "anagrammer" offer several times faster ways of creating anagrams and such programs are available in large numbers on the Internet
 yah program yaa sarwar shabdon ke database kii sampurna khoj karata he or daale gaye shabd yaa vaakyansh se shabd yaa vaakyansh ke har sambhav sangyojan kii ek suchi utpann karata he

 Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games
 computer anagram solver kaa nuksaan, khaskar bahu-shabd anagram par lagu karte samay, un shabdon ke arth ke prati uski aparyaapt samaj he
 They are usually not able to filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from a large number of nonsensical word combinations
 Some newer servers, such as "jumble of Letters", are trying to improve this by using statistical techniques, with this technique attempting to combine only those words that are often seen together
 yah drushtikon keval simit safalataa pradaan karata he kyonki yah vyangypurna or vinodi sanyojanon ko pahchaanane main vifal rahata he
 Some Anagramatists point to the methods used

 Kring originally designed the series to have an ever-changing role
 However, his plan changed when he found out that the original cast was highly popular in the audience, so for the second season, he took on most of the first season's cast, along with a few additional actors who had received star ratings
 In its first season, the show went on to become the third-largest cast in American primetime television, behind Desperate Housewives and Lost, by featuring 12 main actors simultaneously
 Although the cast page of the first season of NBC listed only ten characters, Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode, was an additional member joining the original full-time cast
 In the eleventh episode of the first season, Jack Coleman was promoted from a recurring role to a twelfth full-time member

 During the first two seasons, some characters were removed to take on new characters with new stories
 Simone was the first major character to be dropped out of death at the end of season one
 DL became a guest star after the events of the first season finale, appearing only twice in season two
 Isaac Mendez was also left out of the story following his death at the hands of Xiler, who was featured in Heroes Nakamura's New York time travel campaign in season one
 Among the newly inducted characters during season two, the character Maya Herrera, played by Dania Ramirez, is a fugitive with deadly virus emissions; Adam Monroe, played by David Anders, a 400-year-old Englishman and legendary warrior Takejo Kensi with the ability to revive; Monica Dawson, a restaurant worker with the ability to mimic any physical activity, was portrayed by Dana Davis, and an anti-social behaviorist Ellie Bishop, played by Kirsten Bell, with the ability to generate electricity
 The recurring cast from season one, Zailer played by Zakari Kuinto and Ando Masahashi played by James Kyson Lee were promoted as the main characters in season two

 Heroes developed in early 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of nbc's Crossing Jordan, introduced the concept to the program
 Kring wanted to create a "big ensemble saga" that could connect with audiences
 He started thinking about how big, scary and complex the world is and he wanted to create a series focused on characters that could do something about it
 Kring realized that there were not so many big characters in a police officer or medical drama who could save the world
 He considered superheroes, ordinary people who discover extraordinary abilities while living in the real world and reality
 Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart meet some ventures such as Milo Ventimiglia, who in the first episode "introduced the common man as a character drama with increasing reality
" a reality that was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon
 Kring wanted points in the series that incorporated the characters and their world

 The episode has a different structure: after a brief recap of relevant events, each show begins with a puzzle, sometimes beginning with the scene that was introduced in the previous week's episode
 Mostly Mohinder Suresh talks about the title or event in a philosophical voice
 At a dramatic turn, the screen cuts to the graphic title, which shows that the Earth is turning into a solar eclipse, with the Belly Bead performance showing the Heroes logo and the musical pause written by Kring himself
 The title of the episode is usually shown after the title scene, which is followed by a commercial break
 After the first commercial break, the title of the episode usually appears on an earthly object within the scene
 The title is presented as a chapter, each chapter having a number, which connects it to the episode number of that part
 The list of initial names usually appears in alphabetical sequences of the preceding name
 Many characters' stories are shown throughout the episode
 Sometimes these stories are lonely incidents, while sometimes the stories of other characters come in and move forward
 At this point, Suresh provides the final voiceover and most of the episodes end with an interesting twist or suspense, which is shown just before the smash cut with the "continue to" graphic
 jab lekhan team ek episod par kaam karti he, prayek lekhak ek charitra letaa he or uske irdagird ke akele drishy likhata he

 The second season saw a WGA writer strike, meaning that only 11 of the planned 24 episodes would be produced
 This forced the producers to redesign the season by incorporating only Generations out of the three episodes planned according to the predetermined plan
 The third planned part, Exodus, which originally reflected the effects of 138 variants of the peace virus in the story, was canceled
 The fourth planned part, Villain, was replaced in the third part and moved to season three
 The closing scenes of part two of "powerless" had to be re-filmed due to the cancellation of Exodus, and all the ends had to be tied to the loose ends of Generations

" Tim Molloy of TV Guide stated that Heroes will return to their origins from the fourth part
 The fugitive is an attempt to attract new viewers and bring back viewers who left the show due to excessive characters and storylines
 Fugitives begin with Nathan Petrelli telling the president that there are people who have superhuman abilities
 The President authorizes Nathan to capture such individuals, and all the main characters, except Xylor, gather to escape the reach of Nathan's agents in an attempt to locate his biological father
 Heroes enlist the help of a mysterious colleague, Rebel, who is later revealed to be Micah Sanders

 Music from the first season is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman with music engineer Michael Perfitt and vocals by Shankar
 Each episode has an average of thirty to thirty five minutes of music
 Melvoin and Coleman were added to Heroes because of their previous work with executive producer Alan Arkush
 Tim Kring gave the pair general instructions including the emotion and direction of each character
 Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and therefore gave Wendy and Lisa the freedom and permission to experiment
 In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a "fictional" cue be used in a scene in a burning car, played by Claire Bennett
 The "fictional" cue has since become an identity mark of the show

 The theme music of Heroes in France is composed by Victoria Petrosillo
 Her song, "le Héros d'un autre" is used on television network TF1 in place of the show's original music
 The network has launched a new credit sequence to play Petrosillo's theme song

 On May 14, 2007, NBC announced that during the 2007–2008 season, the network would broadcast Heroes Origins, a sequel to the six-episode Heroes
 Each week a new character was to be introduced in the show and the audience had to choose who would be in the regular series of the next season
 The reason for airing this episode was stated to be a mid-season hiatus, due to which the ratings of Heroes faltered when they returned in the first season
 NBC President Kevin Raley told reporters on 14 May 2007, "we have something that i call a" big challenge "for the next year, which is trying to make our schedule more consistent for viewers
 We asked Tim Kring to tell us a plan and what i liked best is that not only do we have 30 hours of content for the next season but it will be a completely new suggestion that i think will show the show Will take you to the next level
 " The show was scheduled to air in April 2008 after the conclusion of the second season of Heroes, which was announced at the 2007 comic-con International
 The second season of Heroes and the first season of Heroes: Origins had a total of 30 episodes
 However, on October 31, 2007, reports by Variety and the Hollywood Reporter indicated that Origins was postponed due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America

 jab kring se 2008 ke vasant ke dauraan origins ko punah shuru karne ke bare main poocha gaya, kring ne kaha, "vastav main ab isaki koi sambhaavna nahin he kyonki heroj ke agle episod kaa dur dur tak koi pataa nahin he
 hame apni puri kshamta lagaani hogi or logon ko vaapis laana hoga
 mujhe aashaa he ki kisi bindu par yah punah shuru hoga lekin abhi sirf prasaarit ho rahe sho ke vishay main hi jaankaree uplabdh he
" On 3 April 2008, Ben Silverman confirmed the cancellation of Origins, a day after NBC announced its prime time schedule
 The co-president of NBC Entertainment and Media Universal Studios said, "we were putting a lot of pressure on our creative team 


 We wanted thirty-five of Heroes and twelve episodes of Heroes: Origins, each with a short film and backdoor pilot As it was supposed to be
 We reached far ahead and challenged our people and we decided that it would be better that we do the basic form of Heroes as far as possible

 The second season of Heroes was criticized by critics and fans for a much slower pace, less engaging storyline and lack of attention than the first season
 Milo Ventimiglia stated that "if there is a slight delay in an event, a good scene or moment or episode 


 people become impatient, so it is very important for them to strike a balance between taking and giving
