 isiilie unhone bhavukta, kalpana aadi ke aashray dwaara kathanak ko atirikt jivan-sangharsh main praapt hone vaali safalataa-asafalataa kaa yatharthamulak chithran kiya he
 He has provided a pure historical background to the plot, his emphasis is not on romantic elements
 abhijatyavaadee drushtikon na keval katha-sangyojan or charitra-chatrin main drushtigat hota he, apitu unki suspasht tathaa shashakt pad-rachana bhi isi pravriti kii dein he
 It is also notable in this context that just as the practice of Kalidasa's work would be incomplete in the absence of Mallinath's interpretations, Dhundiraj's commentary on 'mudrarakshas' is also famous
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kii kathavstu prakhyat he
 The basis of the naming of this drama is this event - the monster is shocked or compelled to see his posture being used against himself
 isamen chandragupta ke rajarohan ke uparant chanakya dwaara rakshas kii raajnneetik chaalon ko vifal kar dene kii katha ko saat ankon main sucharu rup main vyakt kiya gaya he
 The playwright has introduced the plans of Chanakya and Rakshasa with full political credentials
 unhone naatakagat ghatnakam ke aayojan main swaabhaaviktaa, jigyaasa or rochakata kii ore upyukt dhyaan diya he
 The play provides interesting details of what measures were taken by the then politicians for the operation of the monarchy
 chanakya ke sahaayakon ne ruchi-aruchi athwa swatantra ichha-shakti kii chintaa na karte hue apane liye nirdisht kaaryon kaa jis tatparta se nirvaah kiya, vah kaary sambandhi ekta kaa uttam udhaaharan he
 Seriality of events is an admirable quality of this drama, because nowhere in the scheme of conspiracy-repellents is the violence targeted
 yadhyapi chanakya kii kutil chaalon kaa varnan hone se iskaa kathanak jatil he, kintu naatakkaar ne ise purvapar kram-samanvit rakhane main adbhut safalataa praapt kii he
 In this, theatrical use of practices, semantics, treaties and vrittis has been done
 bhartiya aacharyon ne naatak ne katha-vikaas kii paanch avasthaaen maani hai - prarambh, praytn, praptyasha, niyatapti, falaagam
 The beginning of the play should be interesting and well planned, because the success of subsequent events of the play depends on it
 ‘mudrarakshas’ main nipunak dwaara chanakya ko rakshas kii mudra dene tak kii katha ‘prarambh’ ke antargat aegi
 These 'events' can be included under the 'attempt' stage - Chanakya's attempt to make the demon and Malayketu exorcise, the false conduct of crucifixion of Shaktadasa, betraying the demon by Siddhartha, etc
 ’praptyasha’ kii yojana ke liye naatakkaar ne chandragupta or chanakya ke chhadam virodh, rakshas dwaara kusumpur par akraman kii yojana aadi ghatnaon dwaara rakshas kaa utkarsh varnit kiya he, kintu saath hi kootneetijna chanakya kii yojanaon kaa bhi varnan hua he
 The events of Chanakya's confession of the demon and Malayaketu and thwarting the demon's plans come under 'destiny'
 chathe-saatven ankon main ‘falaagam’ kii siddhi ke liye rakshas ke aatm- samarpan kii prishthbhumi prastut karte hue uske dwaara chandragupta ke amaatya-pad kii sweekruti kaa ullekh hua he
 The manner in which the narrator has described these conditions more and more cleanly is praiseworthy
 kathanak ke samyak vikaas ke liye bhartiya aacharyon ne karyavasthaon kii bhanti paanch arth-prakrutiyaan bhi nirdhaarit kii hai - beej, bindu, pataakaa, prakari, kaary
 Out of these, the main relevant story is presented under 'pataka' and 'prakari' means the inclusion of secondary relevant stories
 kintu, kathanak ke samyak vikaas ke liye praasangik kathaon or aadhikarik katha kaa santulit nirvaah aavashyak he
 In 'mudrarakshas', Chanakya's decision to join the demon in his favor is the 'seed' of the story
 jisaki abhivyakti pratham ank main chanakya kii ukti main hui haih ‘‘jab tak rakshas nahin pakadaa jaataa tab tak nandon ke maarane se kya or chandragupta ko rajya milane se hi kya ? xxrep 4 
 isse uske pakadaney main ham logon ko nirudyam rahanaa acha nahin
 "chanakya etc
 to move to the ashram of Malayaketu is the beginning of Bijnayas" or seeds
 bindu’ ke antargat in ghatnaon kii gananaa kii ja sakati he- nipunak dwaara chanakya ko rakshas kii mudra dena, shakatdas se patr likhavana, chanakya dwaara chandandas ko bandi banane kii ajna dena
 In the accomplishment of the play, the poems made by Siddhartha and Bhagurayana are counted under 'pataka'
 ’prakari’ kaa aayojan ’mudrarakshas’ ke tritiy ank ke ant or chaturth ank ke prarambh main kiya gaya he-chanakya or chandragupta main mithyaa kalah or rakshas tak isaki soochna pahunchnaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 The demon surrendered by accepting the mantra of Chandragupta, 'karya' is the nominal meaning: it is known as Phalagam under stages
 bharatendu harishchandra ne ‘satya harishchandr’, ‘shri chandravali’, ‘bharat durdasha’, ‘neeladevi’ aadi moulik naatakon kii rachana ke atirikt sanskrit-naatakon ke anuwaad kii ore bhi dhyaan diya tha
 He translated 'mudrarakshas' in 1878 AD
 iske purv ve sanskrit-rachana ‘chaurpanchashika’ ke bangala-sanskaran kaa ‘vidyasundar’ sheershak se, krishna mishra ke prabodhachandroday’ ke brutiya ank kaa ‘paakhand vidmban’ sheershak se or rajasekhar krit praakrit-kriti ‘sattak’ kaa ‘karpur-manjari’ sheershak se anuwaad kar chuke the
 In these translations, he has adopted the method of paraphrasing, as a result, it would be more appropriate to call it a drama
 naatak ke prastaavna, bharatvakya aadi sthalon ko unhone praayah moulik rup main prastut kiya he
 Similarly, without taking shelter from the tendency of word translation, a sufficiently independent view has been kept in characterization
 yahi kaaran he ki 'mudrarakshas' main anuwaad kii shushkta ke sthaan par moulik vichaardrushti or bhashaa-pravaah ko praayah lakshith kiya ja saktaa he
 This tendency is even more explicitly aimed at the playful passage
 eta santori, jiskaa bair naam bhi yahi he, naraturang taramandal kaa ek tara he or prithvi se dikhne vaale taron main se 77vaan sab se roshan tara he

 One advantage of the Eta Santouri is that it is rotating very fast on its axis, which is probably slightly skewed, and a lot of liquid is blowing from its center, forming a circle around this star

 copen ke vargeekaran ke anusaar bharat main nimnlikhit chah prakaar ke jalwaayu pradesh paae jate hai: Traditionally six seasons have been considered in India, but the Indian Meteorological Department describes four seasons which we can write as comparatively to their traditional names as follows: bharat main jal sansaadhan kii uplabdhta kshetreey str par jivan-style or samskruti ke saath judi hui he
 At the same time substantial disparity exists in its distribution

 Which means - Truth
 Pravda was the head of Russia [newspaper] from 1912 to 1991, which was reintroduced by Lenin-led Bolshevik Russian Communist Party
 Pravda's republication began on 22 April 1912 in St
 Petersburg, Russia
 Pravda was originally started by the Spilka Party of Ukraine in 1905
 Leon Trotsky was later assigned the editorship of this newspaper
 To avoid censorship, it was published outside Russia and secretly brought to Russia
 This newspaper played an important role in the coup of Tsar Nicholas II in the Russian Revolution and then Communist Mensevico
 Many of Lenin's most important writings were initially published in Pravda and later published as booklets
 On 22 August 1991, after the fall of the Russian Communist Party, then President Boris Yeltsin closed Pravda and Seized all the assets of the newspaper
 Pravda's publication resumed in Lithuania in 2004, but now its form is very different from the original newspaper

 The names of Dimacritus and Kanad in ancient thinkers and the names of Newton, Rutherford, and Heisenberg in modern thinkers are of particular importance
 demacraitis ke anusaar parmaanu pariman, aakaar or sthaan main ek duusare se bhinn hai, parantu inamen gunbhed nahin
 Speed is necessary in accidental disconnection and motion can occur only at leisure
 isaliye parmaanuon ke atirikt avkaash bhi satta kaa antim ansh he
 Being cumbersome, the atoms fall down; Heavy atoms fall at high speeds and collide with light atoms below
 is tarah parmaanuon main sanyog hota he
 Newton considered the atoms to be heavy, solid, and monogamous, and accepted the properties of them
 parmaanu kii saralata chirkaal tak maanya rahi; naveen bhautikee ne ise amaanya tehraaya he
 According to Rutherford, the atom is a tiny solar system, in which many electrons are rotating around the center at high velocity
 hysenvarg kaa anirnitata kaa niyam ek or puraane vichaar ko thokar lagaataa he, is niyam ke anusaar parmaanuon ke samoohon kii dasha main niyam kaa shashan prathit hota he, parantu vyaktigat kriya main parmaanu niyam kii upeksha karte hai; inaki gati anirnit he
 Kanad saw the difference in atoms
 bhautik dravyon main gunbhed he or is bhed ke kaaran hamen rup, ras, gandh, sparsh or shabd kaa bodh hota he
 Presumably, the distinction of sensations inspired him to look for differences in atoms
 naveen vigyaan kahata he ki kuch tatwon ko chhod anya tatwon ke parmaanu akele nahin milte, apitu 2, 3, 4 ke samoohon main milte hai
 In Kanad's idea, making atoms also 'quadrangle' is a fundamental event in the universe, the rupture or destruction of this combination is the destruction

 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years

 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses

 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy

 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse

 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed

 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui

 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company

 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun
