 Some of the other instruments used in this dance are tala - a manjira, gogona - a type of flute and bamboo instruments toka - bamboo tuna, and zootuli - mud whistle
 aksar baans kii baansuriyon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 The songs sung along with the dance have been transferred for generations

 The performance itself can be lengthy, made alive by rapid changes such as rhythm, ambience, tempo and abrupt posture, and dancers and musicians are given few opportunities to show their mastery
 uttar purv bhartiya samoohon ke bich is nrity ke kai prakaar hai, udhaaharan ke liye "deori bihu nrity", "mijing bihu nrity" ityadi, haalaanki nrity kaa mul lakshya ek hi rahata he: dard or khushi donon ko mahasoos karne kii ichha vyakt karnaa
 In the middle of April, the new year begins in the local calendar with the month of Bohag, beginning with spring
 aajkal, is avadhi ke dauraan, puure assam main bihu pratiyogitaayen hoti hai
 These contests attract a huge crowd to visitors and locals alike
 bihu nrity ke alaava, bihu kunvori tathaa kai gayan pratibhaaon ko chunane ke liye pratiyogitaayen yojit kii jaati hai
 At the end of the month of Bohag, the month is concluded by organizing several Bohagi farewell events as commemorations
 mikelson-morle prayog, albert michelson or edward morle dwaara 1887 main kiya gaya prayog he
 Sometimes it is also called Michelson Morley Interferometer
 is prayog ke parinaam ne ether siddhanth ko asaty siddh kar diya
 This experiment moved away from the traditional path to the path that led the scientific society towards the 'second Scientific Revolution'
 vishisht aapekshikta ke moolbhoot pareekshan karne vaale teen prayog hai- mikelson morle prayog, evs-istewel prayog tathaa kennedy-thornadike prayog 
 In 1887, A
 A
 Michelson and E
 W
 Morley attempted to find the velocity of the Earth moving in the ether on the assumption that the velocity of the Earth had an effect on the velocity of light
 kintu micelson or morly prakaash ke veg par prithvi ke veg kaa koi bhi prabhaav gyaat karne main asafal rahe
 The failure of both these scientists is the birthplace of Einstein's relativity theory
 yah prayog baar-baar doharaaya gaya kyonki yah aapekshikta siddhant ke liye mahatvapurn tha 
 In this experiment Michaelsen used a self-made interferometer leads and the remaining 50 percent of the light is transmitted and incident directly to the third mirror c mirror
 ye dono darpan c ek-duusare ke lambavat hai
 These two rays of light are reflected from both c mirrors respectively and again incident on the b mirror and the observer can see the striations of the interference with these two rays simultaneously
 yadi b se donon c darpan samaan duuri par hon to, in dhariyon main se kendriya dhari chamakili hoti he
 Even if there is a slight difference in the distance of both the c mirrors from the b mirror, there will be a slight delay in reaching one of these two light rays and the central stripe will deviate by a small amount
 kendriya dhari ke sthaan vichlan ke maapan se in do kirnon ke sancharan ke kaal kaa antar gyaat ho saktaa he
 Although the differences from b to C1 and C1 are exactly equal, but assume that for some reason BC1 and BC2 differ in the velocity of light in the reciprocal directions, the central stripe will displace and measure the displacement of light in these two directions
 The velocities of can be found
 ether kii pariklpana ke anusaar prakaash kaa veg in do abhilamb dishaao main bhinn hona swaabhaavik tathaa aavashyak hona chahie
 The renewable space is an independent entity and is filled with ether
 yah ether sthir hota he
 When the Earth revolves around the Sun in this stable ether, an 'etherwat' will arise
 ham kalpana karenge ki 'etherwat' BC2 disha main he or uskaa veg va he
 This velocity will not only be the velocity of the Earth's orbit alone, but the velocity of the Earth's solar orbit, the velocity of the solar system, the velocity of the galaxy, etc
 will be the resultant velocity of all possible velocities
 BC2 disha main prakashakiran kaa pratham sancharan veg se or lautate samay sancharan veg se hoga, jahaan prakaash kaa veg he
 BC1 direction is normal to 'etherwat'
 micelson-morly prayog main kendriya dhari kaa visthaapan nahin hua
 It is possible that 'etherwat' will not be the same as understood in BC2 direction, but in some other direction
 is shankaa kaa bhi nirasan is prayog main hua
 In the michelson-morley experiment, the interferometer was firmly installed on a rock with a surface of 150 cm and thickness 30 cm 0
 lohe ke vrittiya haude main paara bharkar usamen yah shila rakhi gai thi or shila vyatikaranmaapi sahit paare main tair sakati thi
 There were two benefits of keeping the interferometer floating in this way: one the disturbance caused by vibrations was destroyed and the other, it was possible to completely rotate the interferometer while using it
 is prakaar vyatikaranmaapi ke ghumaate samay kisi ek kshan par BC2 disha 'etherwat' kii disha main or BC1 shdisha abhilamb hogi
 Therefore, if the interferometer is rotated while making an observation, the displacement of the central stripe will decrease or decrease respectively, or in other words the central stripe will oscillate in a specific difference
 prayog kaa adhik samvedi banane ke liye, prakaash ke pathon kii vruddhi kii gai thi, jiske liye vyatikaran ke purv darpanon se prakashakirnon kaa baar-baar paravartan kiya gaya tha
 Displacement of the central stripe did not occur even after taking necessary corrections and precautions and whatever deviation of the extremely low volume was achieved was under experimental error
 at: 'etherwat' kaa astitv pramanit nahin hua
 We can summarize the results of the series of michelson-morley experiment in such a way that the velocity of the earth moving in the ether has no effect on the velocity of light, so the velocity of the Earth cannot be determined with the help of the velocity of light 
 endoscope kaa arth he andar dekhnaa, or khaastaur par iskaa arth hota he chikitsiya kaaran se endoscope kii madad se sharir ke andar dekhnaa
 The endoscope is a device that is used to examine inside the hollow organs or perforations of the body
 anya chikitsiya chithran upkarnon ke vipareet endoscope ko sidhe hi sharir ke ang main daalaa jaataa he
 Endoscopy may also refer to the use of borescopes in technical situations in which direct line-of-sight observation is not practical
 ek endoscope nimnlikhit ghatakon se milakar bana ho saktaa he: Endoscopy may include: pehle endoscope kaa avishkaar, 1806 main philip bojini dwaara maanav sharir kii naliyon or garton kii jaanch ke liye unke dwaara prastut kiye gayi "lichatlitre " ke vikaas ke saath hua tha
 However the Vienna Medical Society disapproved of such curiosity
 1822 main maikinek island, michigan ke ek sainya shalya-chikitsak wiliam bumont dwaara pehla endoscope viksit kiya gaya
 The first major step towards improving endoscopy was the use of electric light in it
 aise shuruaati prakaash strot bahari the
 Later small bulbs became available that made it possible to obtain internal light, for example in a hysteroscope developed by Charles David in 1908
 hence chrishchiyan jacobiyas ko leparoscopy or thoracoscopy kii madad se amashay tathaa seene kii aarambhik endoscopy khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Laparoscopy was used by Heinz Cock in the 1930s to diagnose liver and gall bladder
 1937 main hope ne actopic pregnancy kaa nidaan karne main leparoscopy ke istemaal kii jaankaree di
 In 1944, Roller Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gastric distention of the stomach and was thus able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscopy
 karl stores ne ianti visheshgyon ke liye 1945 main upkaran banane shuru kiye
 His intention was to develop such a device with the help of which doctors could be able to see inside the human body
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke ant main uplabdh takanic ab bhi bahut hi saadhaaran thi
 The area under examination of the inner part of the human body was illuminated by the Miniature Electric Lamp
 is baat ke prayaas kiye gaye ki endoscopy tub ke jariye bahari strot se sharir ke andar prakaash ko paravartit kiya ja sake
 Karl Storge adopted a plan: he tried to put very bright, but cool, light through the device into the body, to get the best visibility inside the body, as well as to provide objective documentation through image transmission
 aane vaale samay ke liye maardarshak ke rup main apane 400 se adhik rogiyon or kaaryaksham namoonay ke saath karl stores ne endoscopy ke vikaas kii disha main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 However, it was Harold Hopkins who, along with his engineering talent and vision, eventually created a revolution in the field of medical optics through the work of an optical designer
 gastroscope ko pehali baar 1952 main ek japani doctor or optical ejiniyaron kii team dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 Mutsuo Sugiura, under the joint auspices of Olympus Corporation, worked with Doctor Tatsuro Yuji and his colleague Shoji Fukami to develop a device they had previously dubbed the "gastro Camera"
 isamen ek nanha-sa camera ek lacheele tip par lite balb ke saath judaa hua tha
 With this help, he was able to take pictures of stomach ulcers and detect stomach cancer in the initial stage, which were not caught by X-rays
 1950 ke dashak kii shuruaati daur main harold hopkins ne ek “fibroscope” kaa nirmaan kiya, jo chikitsa or udyog, donon hi kshetron main upyogi sabit hua
 Subsequent research and development on these fibers led to further improvement in picture quality
 aane vaale dinon main nae vikaas ke antargat shaamil hue ek shaktishaalee bahya strot se vastu ke chor tak prakaash ke pahunchane ke liye atirikt fibron kaa istemaal – jisase ucchstareey purna varnakram chamak kii prapti sambhav hui, jisaki aavashyaktaa chitra kii baarikiyon ko dekhne or rangeen photography ke liye hoti he
 This capability evolved with developments in the optical field, in which it was possible to "operate" the tip by the controls placed in the hands of the endoscopist, as well as to remotely operate the surgical instrument inside the endoscope
 Also new facilities were acquired
 yah us shalya-chikitsa kii shuruyaat thi, jise ham aaj kii-hole surgery ke naam se jaanate hai
 Fernando Elves Martins of Portugal invented the first fiber optics endoscope
 haalanki, fibroscope kii chitra gunvattta kii bhautik simaaen thim
 In modern terminology, a bundle of 50,000 fibers effectively gives a picture of only 50,000 pixels, apart from this the fiber changes due to frequent changes in usage and thus gradually reduces pixels
 antat itani kshati ho jaati he ki samooche bandal ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hopkins felt that any next optical correction would require a different method
 purv ke sakht endoscope main kaaphi kam lite transmittence tathaa kamjor image quality kii samasya thi
 There was no specific scope for imaging optics due to the need for surgical tools for surgical operations and the need for the illumination system to pass through the endoscope tube
 paaramparik pranali ke chote lens ko sahaayak ring kii jarurat thi, jo lens ke ek bade bhaag ko adhigrahit karata tha; jinhen nirmit karnaa or ek saath rakhana kaaphi kathin tha, saath hi optical rup se ve naakaam bhi the
 The sophisticated diagnosis that Hopkins presented was to fill the space between the 'little lens' with a glass rod
 ye thik-thik endoscope tub main feet ho jate the, jisase ve swa-sanrekhi ban gaye tathaa unhen ‘little lens’ ko puri tarah se vitarit karne ke liye kisi samarthan kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahi
 The rod-lens was easy to operate and use and used the maximum available diameter

 With such a small diameter high quality 'telescope' the tool and illuminance system could easily be placed inside an outer tube
 ek baar phir karl stores ne hi do vyaktiyon ke bich ke lambey rachanaatmak sahyog ke rup main pehle-pahal in nae endoscopon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Although there are certain areas of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes, hard rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are still a favorite instrument in modern times, and indeed modern key-hole surgery

 Due to the use of sedative, most hospitals instruct patients to go home with another person and instruct them not to drive the vehicle themselves and handle other machinery on that day

45 Sihman Bari Matihani is a village in Begusarai, Bihar
 inacychlopidi france main 1751 evam 1772 ke bich prakashit ek saamaanya vishwakosh tha
 Its full name was Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers
 inacychlopidi kai drushtiyon se nayaapan liye hue thi
 It was the first encyclopedia which included articles from many named yogis
 yah pehla saamaanya vishwakosh tha jisane 'yantric kalaon' par dhyaan diya tha
 But beyond all these things, the Encyclopaedia is also famous because it presented the idea of enlightenment
 denish didero ne 'insaclopidi' naamak lekh main likhaa tha ki iskaa uddeshy logon ke sochane ke tareeke main hi parivartan laa dena he
 It was his desire that all the knowledge of the world be included in the Encyclopaedia and this knowledge should be spread in the present and future generations
 isaki rachana "chambers cychlopedia" ke french anuwaad ke rup main angrej vidvan jon mills dwaara uske france avaasakaal main prarambh hui, jise usne mottphi cells kii sahaayta se san 1745 main samaapt kiya
 But he could not publish it and went back to England
 iske sampadan hetu ek-ek kar kai vidwaanon kii sevaayen praapt kii gayi or anek sangharshon ke pashchaat yah vishwakosh prakashit ho sakaa
 The Encyclopédie is the greatest literary achievement of the eighteenth century
 yah maatr sandarbh granth nahin tha; yah nirdesh bhi pradaan karata tha
 It was a strange confluence of faith and non-faith
 isane us yug ke sarvaadhik shaktisampann carch or shashan par prahaar kiya
 Perhaps there is no other encyclopedia that has so much political importance and has made a revolutionary impact on the history and literature of a country
 par in vishistataaon ke hote hue bhi yah vishwakosh ucch koti kii kriti nahin he
 It contained errors and discrepancies at site
 yah lagbhag samaan anupaat main ucch or nimna koti ke nibandhon kaa mishran tha
 There were also harsh criticisms of this encyclopedia
 didero or a’lambert ne tay kiya ki unka inacychlopidi samast gyaan kaa dastavezikaran karegaa, sabhi tarah kii kalaon or hastkaushal ko gambheer adhyayan kaa vishay maanate hue unke bare main jaankariyaan degaa, gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon ke vargeekaran or unke antar-sambandhon par vishesh dhyaan degaa or gyanoday se udbhoot vichaaron kii roshni main chintan-manan kii saamaanya vidhiyon ko sthaayee rup se badalane kaa prayaas karegaa
 Harris and Chambers had also tried to pierce the first three targets, but this fourth objective was something special
 sampadak-dway chaahate the ki madhyayugin tatvamimasaa kaarij karke indrianubhavvaad kii roshni main vaigyanik chintan kii anivaaryta sthapit kii jaae, taaki bhavishya kii peediyaan naye tarah se sochane ke liye majaboor ho jaaen
 For him the sense of sensoryism was directly meant to treat the senses as the only authentic source of all knowledge and not to claim any claim as knowledge until it proved to be the test of experience and experimentation
 paanch indriyon ke madhyam se praapt anubhav par jor dene vaale is siddhant ke mutabik gyaan kii pramaan- pushti bhi indriyajanit prekshniya anubhav se hi honi chahie thi
 The roots of sensualism were rooted in the idea that this world is only as much as it is ready to tell us about itself
 isliye is jagat kaa hamen tatasth rup se bina kisi raag-dwesh ke prekshan karnaa chahie
 Any obstacle placed in the way of obtaining observational information will distort knowledge and make it a victim of arbitrary imagination
 indrianubhavvaad ke garbh se hi prekshan, anubhav or prayog ke ve aagrah nikle jinhone aage chal kar aagamanaatmak tarkpaddati ko pramukhataa dete hue vigyaan ke darshan par amit chhap chodi
 The social, political and moral consequences of having a priori knowledge of human sensory experience were inevitable
 manushya or uske ihlokik sansar ko sabhi tarah ke chintan or samaj ke centre main aa janaa tha
 The reader of the Encyclopedia came across as inquisitive who could claim that he had the ability to examine and disseminate facts from falsehood
 yah pathak apane is mulya-nirnay ke liye kisi ucchtar praadhikaar dwaara thamaye gayi pramaan kii aavashyaktaa se inkaar karne vaala tha
 Naturally, the then social and state system representing the Raysim could not live in any kind of gaiety towards this new knowledge and the possibilities inherent in a new person based on it
 usne jaldi hi bhaanp liya ki didero or a’lambert jis gyaan-kosh kaa khand dar khand prakaashan karte ja rahe hai, vah antat rajshahi kii vaidhata ke kshay kaa khamosh auzaar sabit hoga
 As a result, within three years, the Archbishop of Paris in 1751 condemned the Encyclopédie and the following year the Royal Council of State banned its publication
 1759 main paris kii sansad ne bhi gyaan- kosh rachane kii is pariyojna kii ninda kii or ek aadesh ke zariye ve tamaam suvidhaayen waapas le lee gayin jo didero or da’almbert ko mili hui thim
 In this way, till 1766, this project of funding was stalled due to government repression
 is kosh ke lekhakon main ruso or kondore jaisi hastiyaan shaamil thim
 Ultimately, this vast encyclopedia, completed in seventeen volumes, had a decisive effect on the thinking of the leading figures of the French and American revolutions
 benjamin franklin, jon adams or thomas jeffrasan ne na keval vyaktigat rup se is kosh ko karidaa, balki apane raajnneetik-bauddhik daayaron main ise padhane kii sifaarish bhi kii
 For the next two hundred years, the basic concepts of encyclopedia kept the discourse of sociology in its hold
 isaki pratikriya bhi hui
 Some twenty years later the first edition of Encyclopलोdia Britannica was published in Scotland, which was declared as a response to Didero and A'lambart's corpus as 'heretical' and 'unnatural'
 inacychlopidi ko vidharmee isliye kaha gaya tha ki vah maanviya gyaan ke sroton kii nayi paribhaasha karne main laga hua tha or vah apramanik isliye qaraar diya gaya ki didero or a’lambert kii lekhak-mandali frans kii mashhoor bauddhik hastiyon se bani thi or sampadak-dway unke dwaara likhi gayi lambi-lambi pravishtiyon main ullakhit tathyon kii sachai sunishchit karne ke pher main nahin pade the
