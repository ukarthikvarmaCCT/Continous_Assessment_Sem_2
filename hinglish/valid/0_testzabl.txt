 When Warren Hastings asked the Nawab to pay the dues to the British East India Company, he asked his mother for a loan of 26 lakh rupees and in return he gave her a four-fold price
 iske baad purna rihaai ke evaj main 30 lakh or praapt kiye, saath hi jaagiron main aaajeevan company dwaara koi hastkshep na hone kaa vaada bhi kiya gaya
 These jagirs were later confiscated for supporting Begum in Chai Singh's rebellion, later documentary evidence of this cooperation was also found
 abhi mili pramaanon se yah prathit hota he ki warren hestings ne nawab ko apni aakshamataaon se bachaane kii puri koshish kii thi or ve beghamon ke prati bhi kaafii naram the
 At that time Awadh was considered as the granary of India, which was strategically important to control the area of fertile land between the river Ganges and Yamuna called Doab
 yah bahut hi dhanwaan rajya tha or yah maraathon, angrezon or afagaanon se apni swatantraaa banaae rakh paaya tha
 In 1732, the Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, declared Awadh to be independent
 rohilla ne bhi swatantra rohelkhand kii sthapana kii, rohillo kaa rajya san 1774 tak chalaa jab tak ki avadh ke nawab ne angrezon kii east india company kii madad se unhen haraa nahin diya
 Asaf-ud-daula's father, the third Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-daulah, had signed a treaty with the British rebel Nawab Mir Qasim against the British, due to which the British became anti-nawab Shuja-ud-daulah

 The Nawab started it as a Khairati project to generate employment during the famine of 1784
 is akaal main raison ke paas bhi paise khatm ho gaye the
 It is said that Nawab Asaf employed more than 20,000 people in this project, it was neither a mosque nor a graveyard
 nawab kii ucch varg kii izzat ke bare main khyal rakhane kii bhaavana ke bare main andaaza imambada banane se judi kahani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In the day time, the general public engaged in the project would build the buildings

 Thus his honor was upheld

 konark surya mandir bharat main urisa rajya ke puri jile ke antargat puri naamak shahar main pratishthit he
 It is one of the few sun temples of India
 san 1984 main unesco ne ise vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main manyata di he
 This temple was dedicated to Surya-deva, meaning extracts, which the locals called biranchi-narayan
 isi kaaran is kshetra ko use arq-kshetra yaa padam-kshetra kaha jaataa tha
 According to the Puranas, Lord Krishna's son Samb had developed leprosy due to his curse
 samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke sagar sangam par konark main, baarah varshon tak tapasya kii or surya dev ko prasann kiya tha
 Suryadev, who was the destroyer of all diseases, had also prevented its disease
 tadnusaar samb ne surya bhagwaan kaa ek mandir nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking a bath in the Chandrabhaga river, after his destruction, he found a statue of Suryadev
 yah murti suryadev ke sharir ke hi bhaag se, devshilpi shri vishwakarma ne banaayi thi
 Samb installed this idol in a temple in his built Mitravan, since then this place came to be considered sacred
 yah kai itihaaskaaron kaa mat he, ki konark mandir ke nirmaankarta, raja langool nrisinghdev kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran, mandir kaa nirmaan kaary khatai main pad gaya
 As a result, the unfinished structure collapsed
 lekin is mat ko aitihaasik aankadon kaa samarthan nahin miltaa he
 According to the figures of the Madal Register of Puri and some 1278 AD copper sheets, it was revealed that King Langul Narsinghdeva ruled till 1282
 kai itihaaskaar, is mat ke bhi hai, ki konark mandir kaa nirmaan 1253 se 1260 i
 ke bich hua tha
 Therefore, the incomplete construction of the temple is not logical to be the reason for its collapse
 yahan par mandir kii dhwastata ke sampoorn kaarnon kaa ullekh karnaa jatil kaary se kam nahin he
 But it is well known that much of it has now been destroyed
 jiske mukhya kaaran vaastu dosha bhi kaha jaataa he parantu muslim akramanon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 It is said that this temple was eroded in just 800 years due to its architectural defects
 jise vaastu kala va niyamon ke viruddh kaha-suna jaataa he
 For this reason, even before its time period, it collapsed despite being a unique example of Rigveda and Stone Art
 is surya-mandir ke mukhya vaastu dosha hai:-
 According to many legends, a magnetic stone is placed on the summit of the Sun Temple
 iske prabhaav se, konark ke samudr se guzarane vaale sagarpot, is ore khinche chale aate hai, jisase unhen baari kshati ho jaati he
 According to another legend, due to this stone, the magnetic direction representation devices of ships do not tell the right direction
 is kaaran apane poton ko bachaane hetu, muslim navik is pathar ko nikaal le gayi
 This stone was acting as a central stone, so that all the stones in the temple walls were in balance
 iske hatane ke kaaran, mandir kii deevaaron kaa santulan kho gaya or parinamtah ve gir padin
 But there is no historical description of this incident, nor is there any description of the existence of any such magnetic central stone
 konark mandir ke girane se sambandhi ek ati mahatvapurn siddhant, kalapahad se judaa he
 According to the history of Orissa, Kalapahad invaded here in 1508 and destroyed many Hindu temples of Orissa including Konark temple
 puri ke jagannatha mandir ke madan panji bataate hai, ki kaise kalapahaad ne urisa par hamalaa kiya
 He also demolished the statues of most Hindu temples, including the Konark temple
 haalanki konark mandir kii 20-25 feet moti deevaaron ko todna asambhav tha, usne kisi prakaar se dadhinauti ko hilaane kaa prayojan kar liya, jo ki is mandir ke girane kaa kaaran bana
 Due to the removal of Dadhinauti, the temple started to fall slowly and due to heavy stone falling from the roof, the roof of the silent hall also collapsed
 usne yahan kii adhikansh murtiyon or konark ke anya kai mandir bhi dhwast kar diye
 In 1568, the terror of Muslims in Orissa was under control
 parantu iske baad bhi hindu mandiron ko todane ke nirantar prayaas hote rahe
 At this time, the pandas of Jagannath temple of Puri removed the idol of Lord Jagannath from the shrine and hid it in a secret place
 isi prakaar, konark ke surya mandir ke pandon ne pradhan devtaa kii murti ko hataa kar, varshon tak ret main dabaa kar chipaaye rakhaa
 Later, this idol was sent to Puri and placed there in the temple of Indra, located in the courtyard of the Jagannath temple
 anya logon ke anusaar, yahaan kii puja murtiyon abhi bhi khoji jaani baaki hai
 But many people say that the idol of Surya Dev, which is kept in the National Museum of New Delhi, is the main worship idol of Konark
 phir bhi konark main, surya vandana mandir se murti ke hatane ke baad se band ho gayi
 Due to this, pilgrims stopped coming to Konark
 konark kaa pattan bhi daakuon ke hamale ke kaaran, band ho gaya
 Konark was a famous city for commercial activities similar to Surya Vandana, but due to the closure of these activities, it became completely uninhabited and was covered with a deep forest for years
 san 1626 main, khurda ke raja, nrisingh dev, suputr shri purushottam dev, suryadev kii murti ko do anya surya or chandra kii murtiyon sahit puri le gayi
 Now they meet in the courtyard of the temple of Puri
 puri ke madal panji ke itihaas se gyaat hota he, ki san 1028 main, raja nasinghdev ne konark ke sabhi mandiron ke naap-jokh kaa aadesh diya tha

 According to one legend, King Narasimha Dev i of the Ganga dynasty ordered the construction of the temple by royal proclamation, to prove the supremacy of his dynasty
 baarah sau vaastukaron or kaarigaron kii sena ne apni srujanaatmak pratibha or urja se paripurna kala se baarah varshon kii athak mehnat se iskaa nirmaan kiya
 The king had already spent money equal to the tax receipts of his kingdom for twelve years
 lekin nirmaan kii purnataa kahin dikhaayi nahin de rahi thi
 Then the king gave a strict order to complete the work by a certain date
 bisu maharana ke paryvekshan main, is vaastukaron kii team ne pehle hi apana puraa kaushal laga rakhaa tha
 Then the twelve-year-old son of Bisu Maharana, Dharma Pad came forward

 He proposed the problem suggestion of planting the last central stone of the temple
 usne yah karke sabko aashcharya main daal diya
 But soon after, the body of this remarkable genius was found on the sea shore

 Abul Muzaffar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir, commonly known as Aurangzeb or Alamgir, was the sixth Mughal ruler to rule India
 uskaa shashan 1658 se lekar 1707 main uski mrityu hone tak chalaa
 Aurangzeb ruled the Indian subcontinent for more than half a century
 wo akbar ke baad sabase zyada samay tak shashan karne vaala mogul shaasha tha
 During his lifetime he tried his best to expand the Mughal Empire in Southern India, but after his death, the Mughal Empire started shrinking
 aurangzeb ke shashan main mogul samrajya apane vistaar ke charmotkarsh par pahunchaa
 He was perhaps the wealthiest and sober person of his time, who through his conquests in South India, spread the Mughal Empire over twelve and a half million square miles and ruled over 150 million people, 1 / 4 of the world's population
 aurangzeb ne puure samrajya par fatwa-e-alamgiri lagu kiya or kuch samay ke liye gair-muslimon par atirikt kar bhi lagaaya
 He was the first Muslim ruler to apply Sharia to non-muslim people
 mogul shasankaal main unke shashan kaal main uske darbariyon main sabase zyada hindu the
 And Tegh Bahadur, the Guru of the Sikhs, along with Darashikoh, was given the death penalty in a crime of rebellion
 aurangzeb kaa janm 3 navambar 1618 ko dahod, gujarat main hua tha
 He was the sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal and the third son
 uske pita us samay gujarat ke soobedaar the
 When the rebellion by his father failed in June 1626, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were held hostage by Noor Jahan in the Lahore court of his grandfather Jahangir
 26 farvari 1628 ko jab shahjahan ko mogul samraat ghoshit kiya gaya tab aurangzeb agra kile main apane mata pita ke saath rahane ke liye waapas lautaa
 It was here that Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian
 mogul prathaon ke anusaar, shahjahan ne 1634 main shahzada aurangzeb ko dakkan kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Aurangzeb went to Kirkee whose name was changed to Aurangabad
 1637 main usne rabia durrani se shaadi kii
 Here Shahjahan started handing over the work of the Mughal court to his son Dara Shikoh
 1644 main aurangzeb kii bahan ek durghatana main jalakar mar gai
 Aurangzeb came to Agra three weeks after the incident, which caused his father Shah Jahan immense anger
 usne aurangzeb ko dakkan ke soobedaar ke ohade se barkhaast kar diya
 Aurangzeb could not come to the court for 7 months
 baad main shahjahan ne use gujarat kaa soobedaar banaaya
 Aurangzeb ruled smoothly and received the title of the same, he was made the governor of Badakhshan and Balkh region
 iske baad use multan or sindh kaa bhi governor banaaya gaya
 During this time he kept fighting with the Persians of Persia for control over Kandahar, but if he got anything other than defeat, it was his father's neglect
 1652 main use dakkan kaa soobedaar fir se banaaya gaya
 He fought against Golconda and Bijapur and at the decisive moment Shah Jahan withdrew the army
 isse aurangzeb ko bahut thes pahaunchi kyonki shahjahan aisa uske bhai daara shikoh ke kehane par kar rahaa tha
 In 1652, Shah Jahan fell ill and it seemed that Shah Jahan would die
 daara shukoh, shah suja or aurangzeb main satta sangharsh chalane laga
 Shah Suza, who had declared himself as the Governor of Bengal, had to go to the Arakan region of Burma, and in 1659 Aurangzeb, after arresting Shah Jahan at the Taj Mahal for the royal treasury, declared himself king
 daara shikoh ko rajdroh ke zurm main phaansi de di gai
 Aurangzeb never spent the royal treasury on his own
 mogul, khaaskar akbar ke baad se, gair-muslimon par udaar rahe the lekin aurangzeb unke thik ulat tha
 Aurangzeb resumed Jiziya, which Akbar had finished
 usne kashmiri brahmanon ko islam qabool karne par majaboor kiya
 The Kashmiri Brahmins sought help from Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs
 teg bahadur ne iskaa virodh kiya to aurangzeb ne unhen faansee par lataka diya
 Sikhs still remember this day in their festivals
 aurangzeb ke shashan kaal main yuddh-vidroh-daman-chadhaai ityadi kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 The number and strength of the Sikhs in the West was increasing
 dakshin main bijapur or golkunda ko antat usne haraa diya par is bich shivaji kii maratha sena ne unako naak main dam kar diya
 Shivaji was arrested by Aurangzeb, but when Shivaji and Sambhaji escaped, it became a matter of great concern for him
 aakhir shivaji maharaja ne aurangzeb ko haraaya or bharat main maratha ne puure desh main apni takat badhai shivaji kii mrityu ke baad bhi maraathon ne aurangzeb ko pareshaan kiya
 Meanwhile, the Rajputs turned against him due to the policy of converting Hindus to Islam and they revolted soon after he died in 1707
 aurangzeb ke prashasan main duusare mughal badshaah se zyada hindu niyukt the or shivaji bhi inamen shaamil the
 It is a well-known fact about Mughal history that in comparison to other kings, Aurangzeb's reign was more part of Hindu administration
 aitihaasik tathy bataate hai ki aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ke shasankaal main sena ke vibhinn padon, darbar ke duusare ahm padon or vibhinn bhugolic prashasnic ikaayiyon main hinduon kii taadaad 24 fisadi thi jo aurangzeb ke samay main 33 fisadi tak ho gai thi
 In the words of m Athar Ali, this fact is the strongest evidence against the notion that the emperor sided with the Hindu mansabdars
 aurangzeb kii sena main varisht padon par badi sankhya main rajput niyukt the
 Aurangzeb's attack against the Marathas and the Sikhs is viewed through religious spectacles but it is ignored when concluding that the Mughal army was often commanded by a Rajput commander in the war zone
 itihaaskaar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai ki ek samay khud shivaji bhi aurangzeb kii sena main manasabadaar the
 It is said that he was supposed to be the head of the Mughal Sultanate in South India but failed to realize his military prowess, Aurangzeb did not approve this appointment
 aurangzeb pavitra jivan vyateet karata tha
 In his personal life he was an ideal man
 vah un sab durgunon se sarvatra mukt tha, jo asia ke raajaaon main samanytah the
 He lived the Yeti-life
 khaane-pine, vesh-bhusha or jivan kii anya sabhi-suvidhaon main vah sanyam baratata tha
 While busy with the heavy work of administration, he used to take time to earn some money by copying the Quran and sealing the caps to meet his needs
 aurangzeb hi nahin sabhi madhyakaalin bharat ke tamaam muslim baadshahon ke bare main ek baat yah bhi kahi jaati he ki unamem se koi bhartiya nahin tha
 At one level, this is childish and meaningless because the concept of nation did not exist anywhere in 17th century India
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah baat kam se kam aurangzeb ke maamle main lagu nahin hoti
 This Mughal emperor was a staunch upper-class Hindustani
 iskaa sidhaa tark yahi he ki uskaa janm gujarat ke dahod main hua tha or uskaa paalan poshan ucchwargeey hindustani pariwaron ke bacchon kii tarah hi hua
 The Braj language and its literature were always patronized throughout the Mughal period and this tradition continued even during the rule of Aurangzeb
 colombia uniwarsity se judi itihaaskaar ellison bush bataati hai ki aurangzeb ke darbar main braj ko protsaahan dene vaala maahaul tha
 The king's son Azam Shah had a keen interest in Braj poetry
 braj sahitya ke kuch bade naamon jaise mahakavi dev ko usne sangrakshan diya tha
 Vrind, another great poet of the same language, was also employed in Aurangzeb's administration
 mughalkaal main darbar kii aadhikarik lekhan bhashaa farsi thi lekin aurangzeb kaa shashan aane se pehle hi badshaah se lekar darbariyon tak ke bich prachlit bhashaa hindi-urdu ho chuki thi
 This can also be understood from Aurangzeb's letter he wrote to his 47-year-old son Azam Shah
 badshaah ne apane bete ko ek kila bhent kiya tha or is maukey par nagaade bajwane kaa aadesh diya
 In a letter to Azam Shah, Aurangzeb has written that when he was a child, he loved the voice of the drums and often said, 'babaji dhan-dhan!' It can be said from this example that Aurangzeb's son used to talk to his father in the then prevalent Hindi
 samraat aurangzeb ne islam dharm ke mahatv ko sweekaarte hue ‘quran’ ko apane shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He prohibited kalma khudvana on coins, celebrating the festival of nauroz, cultivating hemp, singing and playing etc
 1663 i
 main sati pratha par pratibandh lagaaya
 Charged the pilgrimage tax again
 apane shashan kaal ke 11 varsh main ‘jharokha darshan’, 12wein varsh main ‘tuladaan pratha’ par pratibandh laga diya, 1668 i
 main hindu tyohaaron par pratibandh laga diya
 In 1699 AD, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples
 bade-bade nagaron main aurangzeb dwaara ‘muhatsib’ ko niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1669, Aurangzeb broke the 'vishwanath Temple' of Benares and the 'keshav Rai Mandir' of Mathura
 usne sharia ke viruddh liye jane vaale lagbhag 80 karon ko samaapt karvaa diya
 These included local taxes called ‘raidari’ and ‘pandari’ also known as ‘abwab’
 aurangzeb ‘daarul herb’ ko ‘daarul islam’ main parivartit karne ko apana mahatvapurn lakshya maanata tha
 In Aurangzeb's time, pilgrims coming to Brij were heavily taxed, Jiziya tax was re-imposed and Hindus were converted to Muslims
 us samay ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon main aurangzeb ke atyaacharon kaa ullekh he
 The Jaziya tax levied by Aurangzeb was at that time
 akbar ne jajia kar ko samaapt kar diya tha, lekin aurangzeb ke samay yah dobaaraa lagu kiya gaya
 Jaziya was different from normal taxes that non-muslims had to pay
 iske teen str the or iskaa nirdhaaran sambandhit vyakti kii aamadani se hota tha
 There were some exceptions to this tax
 garibon, berozegaron or shaareerik rup se ashakt log iske daayre main nahin aate the
 Apart from these, Brahmins and government officials who were at the top of the varna system of Hindus were also out of it
 musalamaanon ke upar lagane vaala aisa hi dharmik kar jakaat tha jo har amir musalmaan ke liye dena zaruri tha 
 Jaziya was certainly a biased tax system on the norms of modern values
 aadhunik raashtra, dharm or jati ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa bhed nahin kar sakate
 That is why when we look at the 17th century system on the scale of modern nations, it may seem very chaotic, but it was not so during Aurangzeb
 us daur main iske duusare udhaaharan bhi milte hai
 As the Marathas evicted the Mughals from a large part of the south
 unki kar vyavastha bhi takreeban isi str kii pakshpaati thi
 They used to collect zakat from Muslims and the Hindu population was out of any such tax system
 aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tudwaaye, usase kahin zyada banawaye the
 According to the famous historian Richard Eaton, demolition of temples was a rare occurrence in the Mughal period and whenever it happened it was political because of it
 iton ke mutabik vahi mandir tode gaye jinamein vidrohiyon ko sharan milti thi yaa jinaki madad se badshaah ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi jaati thi
 At that time there was no religious purpose to break the temple
 is maamle main kukhyat kaha jane vaala aurangzeb bhi sultanate ke isi niyam par chalaa
 Examples of temple demolition during his reign are very rare and there are political reasons at his root
 udhaaharan ke liye aurangzeb ne dakshin bharat main kabhi-bhi mandiron ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jabaki uske shasankaal main zyaadaatar sena yaheen tainaat thi
 He definitely attacked some temples in North India like Keshav Rai temple in Mathura but the reason was not religious
 mathura ke jaaton ne sultanate ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha isliye yah hamalaa kiya gaya
 In contrast, Aurangzeb also patronized temples for reasons
 yah uski un hinduon ko bhent thi jo badshaah ke vafaadaar the
 Historian Catherine Butler of King's College, London even says that Aurangzeb had built more temples than he broke
 catherine frank, em athar ali or jilaluddin jaise vidwaan is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki aurangzeb ne kai hindu mandiron ko anudaan diya tha jinamein banaras kaa jangam baadi math, chitrakoot kaa balaji mandir, elahabaad kaa someshwar nath mahadev mandir or guwahati kaa umanand mandir sabase jane-pahachaane naam hai
 In the period in the Mughal period, the talk of breaking the temples is so much in vogue, there is no special mention of this in the Hindus
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki us daur main aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin rahaa hoga, lekin 18veen shatabdi main jab sultanate khatm ho gai tab bhi is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin miltaa
 In the past, the issue of the demolition of Hindu temples by Mughal rulers became hot in India in the 1980s-90s
 aurangzeb ko kattarpanthi sabit karne kii koshish main ek bada tark yah bhi diya jaataa he ki usne sangeet par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin yah baat bhi sahi nahin he
 Catherine explains that music was not banned in her court even in the Sultanate
 badshaah ne jis din rajgaddi sanbhali thi, har saal us din utsav main khub naach-gaanaa hota tha
 Some Dhrupadas include the name Aurangzeb, which suggests that music was patronized during his reign
 kuch aitihaasik tathy is baat kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki vah khud sangeet kaa acha jaankaar tha
 In mirat-e-alam, Bakhtawar Khan wrote that the emperor had knowledge like musical legends
 mughal vidwaan fakirullah ne raag darpan naam ke dastavej main aurangzeb ke pasandida gayakon or vaadakon ke naam darj kiye hai
 Aurangzeb was loved by his sons Azam Shah and history tells that Shah had become an accomplished musician during his father's lifetime
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sangeet ke phalne-phoolne kii baat karte hue catherine likhti hai, ‘500 saal ke puure mughalkaal kii tulana main aurangzeb ke samay farsi main sangeet par sabase zyada tikaa likhi gayi
 However, it is true that towards the end of his life, Aurangzeb became more religious and kept away from music and music
 lekin upar hamane jin baton kaa zikr kiya he use dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki usne kabhi apni nijee ichha ko sultanate kii aadhikarik niti nahin banaaya
 In the late Aurangzeb, the Marathas had increased in strength in the south
 unhen dabaane main shahi sena ko safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 Therefore, in 1683 Aurangzeb himself went south with the army
 vah rajdhani se dur rahata hua, apane shashan−kaal ke lagbhag antim 25 varsh tak usee abhiyaan main rahaa
 After ruling for 50 years, he died in Ahmednagar in the south on 3 March 1707 AD

 jwalamukhi prithvi kii sataha par upasthit aisi daraar yaa mukh hota he jisase prithvi ke bheetar kaa garm lava, gas, raakh aadi baahar aate hai
 In fact, it is a fracture in the upper layer of the Earth through which the internal matter comes out
 jwalamukhi dwaara nicksruth in padaarthon ke jamaa ho jane se nirmit shankvakar sthalaroop ko jwalamukhi parvat kaha jaataa he
 Volcanoes are related to plate tectonics because it has been found that they are often found on the boundaries of plates because plate boundaries provide weak sites for fractures in the Earth's upper crust

 If there is no memory of any volcano ever having any event of explosive type of activity, then it is often considered dead

 Sometimes due to the accumulation of large amounts of lava, a thick layer is formed, which results in the formation of lava plains or lava plateaus

 Innocent Vijay listens to his father and it has a profound effect on his mind and heart
 kisi tarah vijay je

 Within a few days, Vijay himself becomes a well-known gangster

 aryaashtangmarg mahatma buddha kii pramukh shikshaaon main se ek he jo dukhon se mukti paane evam aatm-gyaan ke saadhan ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 All the 'routes' of the Ashtanga Marg begin with the word 'samyak'
 buddha pratikon main praayah ashtaang margon ko dharmachakr ke aath tadiyon dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Part of the category of buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he - dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha said that craving is the root cause of all sorrows
 trishna ke kaaran sansar kii vibhinn vastuon kii ore manushya pravrutt hota he; or jab vah unhen praapt nahin kar saktaa athwa jab ve praapt hokar bhi nasht ho jaati hai tab use du:kha hota he
 a creature who dies with craving, still takes birth from his inspiration and keeps grinding in the misery of the world
 at: trishna kaa sarvatha prahaan karne kaa jo maarg he vahi mukti kaa maarg he
 This is called grief-prevention-gamini pratipada
 bhagavan buddha ne is maarg ke aath ang bataae hai : The first two parts of this path are of Pragya and the last two are of Samadhi
 bich ke chaar sheel ke hai
 In this way, Sheel, Samadhi and Pragya become the input of the eight organs in these three
 sheel shuddh hone par hi aadhyatmik jivan main koi pravesh paa saktaa he
 Mumukshu meditates on the basis of pure modesty and avails samadhi and in samadhistha state, he is interviewed with truth
 ise pragna kehete hai, jiske udbuddha hote hi sadhak ko satta maatr ke anitya, anaam or du:khaswaroop kaa saakshaatkaar ho jaataa he
 Its ignorance is destroyed in the light of wisdom
 isse sansar kii sari trishnaayen chali jaati hai
 Veetrishna, he does not ego anywhere and happiness rises above the bond of sorrow
 is jivan ke ananthar, trishna ke na hone ke kaaran, uske phir janm grahan karne kaa koi hetu nahin rahata
 Thus, the sheela-samadhi-pragyawala route divided into eight limbs is called the Arya Ashtanga path

 As a result, the geographical localism associated with the subject matter is not exalted, nor is any regional language related to the subject matter
 keval vyaavhaarik saundarya or suvidha kii drushti se ek mishrit sadhukkadi style janm leti he or ek vyapak style kshetra banane lagata he
 In the individual moments, the free and fluid consciousness of the saints takes on the orthodox style in vernacular forms or emotional contexts
 is prakaar sadhukkadi ke saath anya shaileyon kaa sashastitv ho jaataa he
 Geographical localization becomes part of the aspect of the continuum in the characteristic spectrum
 ayodhya, mathura, vrundavan ke bhavatmak or divya sambandh prakat hone lagate hai
 a similar sentiment towards vernacular languages is also felt
 sthaneey bhashaa- rupon par aadhaarit style vastu kii yatra ke saath chalati he or apane swatantra style- dweep yaa upnivesh banane lagati he
 When Ramacharitra's dignities are subsumed into the divine beauty-melody, the mystical adornments emanating from Nirguna Vani begin to form their own independent existence and Radhakrishna's symbols in the royal beauty become incarnated, then in the initial conditions the melody-makeup rites Braj Bhasha style, other content also starts entering islands, other languages The paper also looks to expand
 braji kii vastu- sanrachana bhi anya vastu- kshetron par adhyaropit hone lagati he or brajabhasha style anya sthaneey bhashaaon se maitri style kshetron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 The saint-literature is written in Sadhukkari style
 is style kaa bhashaagat aadhaar paramparaagat kavy- bhashaa yaa braji kaa nahin he
 The style gained prominence on the mixed structure of Khadi Boli and Rajasthani
 2 sidhon kii bhaanti sant- sahitya main bhi duhari style milti he
 The language of the verses of sagu devotions of saint poets is Braj or the traditional poetic language, but the language of Nirgunbani is the Khadi dialect or Sadhukkari language adopted by the Nathpanthis
 3 This two-pronged style scheme continued from Namdev to successive saints
 sadhukkadi style main rajasthani, punjabi, khadi boli or purvi ke rupon kaa mishran miltaa he
 The saint's personality did not go by accepting a traditional, defined style
 khadi boli kaa sambandh pracheen style bhugol kii drushti se kuru- janapad se tha
 The language structure of the region differed somewhat from the Shaurseni Panchali style region
 pracheen rachanaaon main braji or khadi boli ke rupon kaa sashastitv bhi miltaa he
 In the nature of these two, the distinction between akāranta - ookārānta, ākaarānta - ākaaranta is prominent
 in donon kii prakruti main aakarant kauravi kaa samya punjabi se he
 Both trends are found in modern Rajasthani and Brazi
 kannauji kaa kshetra apekshaakrit shuddh aukarant style kaa kshetra he
 Geographically incorporating some forms of Punjabi and Rajasthani, the Khadi Boli style was flourishing around Delhi
 muslim kaal main is bhugolic kshetra kaa aitihaasik mahatv badha
 The language-style here received publicity and encouragement
 isi style ko santon ne apanaaya
 There was no absolute absence of the forms of Braji in this, but the basic structure should be considered as a stand-by dialect
 is style ko apnaane or lokapriy banane kaa shrey muslim lekhakon ko hi dena chahie
 Sankrantikalin saints were also directly or indirectly influenced by Muslim culture
 aarambhik nath- yogi parampara main avashya hi shuddh sadhukkadi kii parampara milti he
 The basic structure of Gorakhbani's language-style is steeply spoken and has a mixture of eastern
 rajasthani ke prabhaavon kaa bhi abhaav nahin he
 Also, Gorakhnathji also wrote the posts of Braj Bhasha
 aisa prathit hota he ki pad- kavyarup ke liye braji kaa prayog rudh hota ja rahaa tha
 Nath and saints also used this style in songs
 saidhantik charchaa yaa nirgan- vaani sadhukkadi main hoti thi
 Just as the virtuous side of the Bhakti movement was following the style of Briji, similarly the virtuous side was making Sadhukkari the medium of its propaganda
 sambhawatah sant- vyaktitv shisht yaa parinishthit bhashaa- style se parichit bhi kam tha, par kathy kii prakruti is naveen style ke grahan kaa mukhya kaaran prathit hoti he
 Social rebuttal - Mandan, Nirgun - discussion, etc
 were some such topics, which the orthodox media could not afford
 isliye ek naveen style- madhyam kii khoj hui
 It can also be speculated that the tradition of this style in Kurukshetra may have been prevalent earlier
 shauraseni- panchali kshetra kii parinishthit style ke saamne iskaa mahatva nahin tha
 Ancient literature of this tradition is also not available
 madhyakaal ke nath- santon evam muslim kaviyon ne is style kaa punarutthan kiya
 Grierson has placed Gujarati under the interwoven branch of the Indian Aryan languages, while being geographically excluded, this type of classification of Gujarati is an acknowledgment of the cultural influence and connection between the two regions

 Krishna along with all the Yadavas settled in Dwaravati
 aabhiron kaa gatimarg bhi madhyadesh main gujarat kii ore prathit hota he
 There was such a suspicion as Ahabir

 Mathura also became a center of Jainism and the relationship between Gujarat and Braj continued
 jain dharm kii bhashaa- vidhi bhi shauraseni se prabhavit thi
 Jain proceeds and later literature is inspired by Krishna talks
 vaishnav dharm ke udai ke samay bhi braj or gujarat kaa sambandh ghanishtha bana rahaa
 This has been and continues to be the most prominent influence-area of the Vallabh sect
 gujarat kii samskruti or braj kii samskruti main hi samya or ghanishtha sambandh nahin rahaa, ubhay kshetreey bhashaa or sahitya bhi ek- duusare ke bahut sameep aa gaye
 The early works of Gujarat have a clear shadow of Shaurseni Apabhramsa
 narsi, keshavadas aadi kaviyon kii bhashaa par brajabhasha kaa prabhaav bhi he or unhone braji main sfoot kavy rachana bhi kii he
 The language of Hemachandra's examples of Shaurseni should be considered as the precursor of Brajbhasha
 4 Many poets of Gujarat wrote poetry in Braj Bhasha or Briji mixed language
 bhalan, keshavadas tathaa arava aadi kaviyon kaa naam is sambandh main ullekhneey he
 In one of Brahmadev's works, a verse of Brajbhasha comes out
 lakshmidas ne sfoot padon kii rachana brajabhasha main kii
 The name of Krishnadas is also important in this list
 narsi mehta kii bhashaa par paramparaagat pashchimi apbhransh kaa prabhaav he, jo use brajabhasha ke sameep le aati he
 He also composed posts in Brajbhasha
 ashtachhaapi kavi krishnadas bhi gujarat ke hi the
 After them, there is a long tradition of Brajbhasha poets in Gujarat
 jo beesvin shatee tak chali aati he
 The poets of Braj Bhasha were also included in the courts of Gujarat
 is prakaar brajabhasha gujarati kaviyon ke liye nij- style hi ban gai thi
 The tradition of mentioning Malwa and Gujarat together is also found in the folklore of Braj
 anek geeton main sagaru tau dhundhyu maluwo or sabu dhundhi gujarat jaisi panktiyaan aati hai
 The general public of Braj was also aware of the mutual relationship between Gujarat, Malwa and Braj
 munj kaa sambandh malwa se tha
 The couplet associated with Munj and Mrinalwati's love is composed in Madhya Pradesh itself
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki ye dohe madhyadesh yaa braj main lok- prachlit the
 Munj's nephew was Bhojraj
 unke saraswati kanthabharan main jo apbhransh rachanaayen sankalit hai, un par bhi braj kii bhashaa- prakruti kaa prabhaav he
 Some lines are very close to Braj Bhasha
 brajabhasha ke liye "gwaliori' kaa prayog bhi hua he
 Jayakirti mentions an ancient prevalent couplet regarding the use of "guleri" in the commentary on "krishna Rukmini's Bell" 5
 braj- desh kii ek seemaa kaa ek chor gwalior mana gaya he
 Gwaliori language and Braj Bhasha are synonymous with each other from this point of view
 lallulaal ne gwalior ko saras kaha he
 Possibly: Gwaliori was developed in the area comprising Braj Bundeli
 prachinkaal main hi, is kshetra ne bahut se kaviyon ko janm diya
 Hariharanivasa Dwivedi has considered the birth of Brajbhasha style in Gwalior
 unka mat is prakaar he -- 11 veen se 15 veen tak jo hindi bundelkhand main viksit hui vahi 16 veen, 17veen, 18 veen shatabdi main kaviyon dwaara apanaai gai
 If one excludes the quarrel whether the Brajbhasha style was born in Gwalior or around Mathura, it can easily be concluded that the boundaries of the Brajbhasha style were wide
 gwalior or mathura donon kii sthiti isi style kshetra main thi
 Gwalior has always been considered in Brajkshetra
 dow grearsan ne uttar- pashchimi gwalior ko brajakshetra main rakhaa he or yahan kii bhashaa parinishthit braji maani he
 This style falls in the Shaurseni tradition
 isamen andeh nahin ki braji or bundeli kii sanrachana praayah samaan he
 The literary genre remained exactly the same for both regions
 braj or bundelkhand kaa saanskrithik sambandh bhi sadaa rahaa he
 One name of Braj Bhasha was also Gwaliori
 aisa prathit hota he ki gwalior- kshetra brajabhasha ke sangeet shasreey prayog kaa kshetra tha
 The Dhrupada promoted by Mansingh Tomar was probably composed in this region
 maanakutuhal main "sudesh' naam aayaa he
 Commenting on this, Hariharanivas Dwivedi has written - Suades means from Gwalior, which is the state center of Agra
 gwalior kshetra kaa vaishishty brajabhasha kii sangeet style ko janm dene main he
 By the way, many Brajbhasha poets like Keshav, Bihari also gave birth to Bundelkhand
 sindh kaa naam aate hi tulsidas athwa goswami lalji kaa naam samaran ho aata he
 He accepted the discipleship of Goswami Vitthalnathji in 1626 AD
 antat gusaniji ne use apana "laal' hi mana or goswami pad se bhi vibhooshit kiya
 He was given the task, preaching Vaishnavism in Sindh and Punjab
 sindh- tat par deraagajikhan ko inhone apana sadhana- sthal banaaya
 The propagation of Vaishnavism started in Brajbhasha from this center
 lalji brajabhasha ke marmajna the
 The sons of Goswami Lal also composed poetry in Braj Bhasha and other authors of Braj literature are also found in the tradition of this throne
 gadhy kii bhi rachana hui
 Commentaries also took place in Braj Bhasha
 guru- prashasti kii kavy- rachana bhi hui
 Thus contemporary writers of Lalji made substantial progress of Brajbhasha literature in Sindh
 aage bhi yah parampara chalati rahi
 In Punjab, the first poet of Brajbhasha is considered to be the doer of Gyanaratna, Saidas 6
 guru nanak ne bhi brajabhasha main kavita kii
 Further, many Gurus composed poetry in Braj Bhasha
 gurugovind singh kaa brajabhasha- krititv mahatvapurn he hi
 Brajbhasha had a respectable shelter in the Guru courts
 rajdarbaron main bhi brajabhasha ke kavi rahete the 8
 Sikhs have a special place in these poets
 sikh santon ne dharmik prachaar ke liye bhi kabhi- kabhi brajabhasha ko chunaa 9
 Thus Punjab, which can be considered a region of mixed style of Khadi Boli, Punjabi, Haryanvi, continued to add to the development of the style of Brajbhasha
 pehle sanket kiya ja chukaa he ki bengal main brajabhasha ke kuch kavi hue
 Bengal was under the influence of universal Shaurseni
 balki yon kahana chahie ki purvi apbhransh pashchim bharat se hi purv main ai
 Magadhi was not affected by this
 avah jab ek saahitiyik style ke rup main panpi, to iskaa prayog maithil kokil vidyapati ne kirtilata main kiya
 It has a mixture of forms of Mithila and Braj
 bengal ke sahajia- sahitya kii rachana bhi mukhyatah isi main hui he
 The infatuation of the regional forms of Bengali is shimmering
 bengal ke vaishnav kaviyon ko sant- sidhon kii bhashaa kii parampara praapt thi
 "brajbuli" is a distinct style emanating from the Vaishnava surroundings
 yah bhi boliyon ke mishran par aadhaarit he
 mathura-vrindavan became the biggest pilgrimage for Vaishnava parishioners in the Muslim era
 dakshin ke acharya bhi idhar aae or chaitanya mahaprabhu bhi
 The name of the language of the Vaishnava monk community is Brajbuli
 iske vikaas main mukhya rup se braji or maithili kaa yogadan tha
 Secondarily, other languages were also giving yoga
 vidyapati ke radhakrishna prem sambandhi geeton ne bengal main vaishnav- navajagaran ko ras- snaat kar diya
 The Kavavrindas of Bengal began to adopt the Brajbuli style of Maithili, Bengali and Brajbhasha
 isi bhashaa main govinddas, gyaandas aadi kaviyon kaa sahitya miltaa he
 Maithili also erupted from Shankardev's throat in the mixed Brazi Assam
 bengal or utkal ke sankirtanon kii bhi yahi bhashaa bani
 This was the language of ras-kirtan in particular
 sankirthan praayah padon main miltaa he
 Brajbulli is actually verse style 10
 bengal main brajabuji ke anek padakarta hue
 In terms of content, Radhakrishna, Radha and chaitanya-brajbuli post-literature is associated with the commendation
 kuch padon main krishna, gop, gopi sandarbh bhi he
 In this way, like Brajasandarbha, Braj style, Padma method, they have merged into Brajbuli style
 assam main shankardev ne bhi brajabuli style ko hi apanaaya
 Brijbuli literature was also composed in his disciple-tradition
 idhar urisa main bhi brajabuli sahitya kii rachana hui
 The time of Rai Ramananda is also before Chaitanya
 brajabhasha style kaa prasar maharashtra tak dikhalaai padataa he
 The oldest forms are found in Namdev's compositions
 namdev kii bhashaa ko dow shivaprasad singh ne gurugranth sahab main sankalit padon kii bhashaa ko purnatah braj mana he
 At one place, their language is also called mixed
 sant namdev kii hindi padaavalee ke sampadakon kaa abhimath is prakaar he- gurugranth vaale pad hi namdev kii hindi rachana kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte hai
 Hundreds of other posts have also been obtained whose language is moderate and safe
 in sabhi rachanaaon ko dekhakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki namdev kii bhashaa multah braj he or us par punjabi, rajasthani, rekhta or marathi kaa prabhaav he
 Thus hundreds of Hindi posts written by Namdev are received, whose composition is of Briji and influence of other languages
 namdev ne hi nahin, maharashtra kshetra ke anya santon ne bhi hindi main pad rache
 Hindi works of Dyaneshwar, Eknath, Tukaram, Ramdas Prabhriti devotees and saints are also found
 inaki hindi rachanaaon kii bhashaa, braj or dakkhini hindi he 11
 The basic structure of the speech of the above mentioned saints seems to be that of Briji, but the tradition of Sadhukkari was also popular here, which is responsible for Khadi Boli or Punjabi influences
 dakhni kshetra ke sameep hone ke kaaran bhi rekhta yaa dakhni kaa prabhaav mana ja saktaa he
 The mixture of Marathi forms is a sign of local influence
 bhav vihmaval lakshanon main braj bhashaa kii style apana lee jaati he
 Even during the Muslim period, the poets of Brajbhasha lived in the court of Shahaji and Shivaji
 shahji ke darbar main rahane vaale kaviyon kii soochiyon di gai hai
 Among these poets were poets from outside Maharashtra
 braji style ke kaviyon kaa bhi yahan sammaan tha
 This tradition also continued in Shivaji's court
 kavi bhushan to brajabhasha ke prasiddh kavi the hi
 Jairam Pindye was a scholar of twelve languages
 baarah bhashaaon main ek brajabhasha bhi hogi, aisa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Jairam and Bhushan may also have had a mutual acquaintance relationship
 inhone hindi main bhi shivaji kii katha likhi, jo ab aprapya he
 Radha Madhav Vilas Champu composed by Jairam has some posts in Brajbhasha
 kuch padya is prakaar hai- Singers reply to the country with great pleasure naam ek ko laalamani, dusro he ghansham
 It is a matter of surprise that this jantra is decorated chitrachana ke daari meh, chitrachana ke daari
 In this verse, Brajbhasha style is present
 brajabhasha style ke dohon kaa prachaar to bahut vyapak tha
 These are the couplets of the same style
 dakshin main khadiboli style kaa hi dakhni naam se prasar hua

 Dependent litterateurs of these Muslim states have referred to the Guleri poem with great reverence
 tulsidas ke samakaleen mullah vajahi ne sabaras main gualeri ke teen dohe uddhrut kiye hai
 By the way, the language of Sabaras is Hindi
 yah khadiboli ke sameep he
 But it must be said that Braj-style or the prevalent couplets of Braj have been used by Vajahi in the same way as Abdurrahman has done in his love story
 aisi rachanaaen bhi hai, jinamein khadiboli style ke saath braji-style kaa mishran hua he
 For example, Afzal's work "bikat kahani-barhamasa" can be taken
 uski bhashaa ke sambandh main dow masood hossain khan ne likhaa he - "afjal kaa sambandh panipat se tha jo haryani ke pradesh main vidyaman he
 'since the Braj-language had by this time acquired a high literary status and Afzal had a full experience of the atmosphere of Brajbhasha in Mathura, it was imperative to have that influence in his language
 afjal ne bikat kahani baramasi main saahitiyik bhashaa kaa prayog kiya, is kaaran uskaa brajabhasha se prabhavit hona anivaary tha
 There is a great tendency of Brazi in its language
 saath hi deergh swaron vaale brajabhasha- prakruti ke haansi, paati aadi shabd milte hai
 Hey, you, you are there
 jaise sarvnaam rup brajabhasha ke samaan hai
 Neither the plural suffix of Brajbhasha is used
 pagan, suun, kun, kaha, kaulon, kahuun avyay bhi brajabhasha prakruti ke hai
 In short, it can be said that the Deccan region was an area of development of the Khadi Boli style
 praayah gadhy rachanaaon main hariyani boli kaa prayog miltaa he, ekaadh padya rachana main braj bhashaa style kaa mishran avashya he
 Brajbhasha style couplets are found in the prose written between the love stories
 dakshin main anya kshetron main bhi brajabhasha ke chhutput kaviyon kaa astitv miltaa he
 An example of the style of Brajbhasha is found in Kalyani's Chalukya Naresh Bhuloka Mall Someswara's book Manasollas

 Maharaja Rama Varma of Kerala used to compose poetry in Braj Bhasha under the name swati-tirunal
 inke padon main sabase adhik sankhya krishna sambandhi padon kii he
 From this it appears that the Brajbhasha style had a close association with Krishnavarta
 saath hi in padon kaa sandarbh bhi sangeet he
 The above discussion makes it clear that the Brajbhasha-style block-subdivisions were scattered all over India
 kahin inaki sthiti saghan thi or kahin viral
 The expansion of genre clauses is only the geographical culmination of diverse relationships in the basic language
 ye sambandh bhashaagat, yaa saanskrithik ho sakate hai
 Style clauses based on linguistic relationships will be called dense, and subdivisions based on other cultural relationships are sparse

 This is based on the list of 100 richest people in the world as on 11 February 2008, the value of total wealth of each person
 The total net worth is an estimate measured in United States dollars, based on the closing stock prices of the stock exchanges on which each person's company is listed, and exchange rates on February 11, 2008
 Stock prices are defined as shares of ownership in a corporation, and exchange rates are defined as how much one currency is worth in terms of another
 This list only represents each person's valuation on a single day due to daily fluctuations among exchange rates and stock valuations
 The list does not include heads of state whose wealth is tied to their position 
 The following list is the ranking of the world's richest billionaires on February 11 2008, and does not reflect changes since that date
 The top three countries with the most billionaires are: United States with over 400, Russia with 87, and India and Germany with 56 each
 Notable-mentions lists those people who have been claimed by credible sources to possess fortunes to the tunes of multi-millions and billions but claims which have not directly been endorsed by Forbes
 These claims are well-referenced and credible
 This list is necessary because it is appropriate neither for Wikipedia nor for others to depend on a single-source to estimate the richest people in the world
 Former State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin claimed that President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, "is the biggest oligarch in Russia" and that Russian businessmen Gennady Timchenko, Mikhail Kovalchuk, Yuriy Kovalchuk, and Roman Abramovich are "looking after Putin's business interests and swallowing up a vast share of the nation's financial flows "
 Such claims have been supported later by Russian political insider Stanislav Belkovsky
 Economist Anders Åslund, author of "russia's Capitalist Revolution", described this story in his Moscow Times article: When asked at a press conference on February 14, 2008 if these allegations were true, Putin was quoted as saying the following in response: "this is true
 i am the richest person not only in Europe, but also in the world
 i collect emotions
 And i am rich in that respect that the people of Russia have twice entrusted me with leadership of such a great country as Russia
 i consider this to be my biggest fortune
 As for the rumors concerning my financial wealth, i have seen some pieces of paper regarding this
 This is plain chatter

 sharir main hone vaali vibhinn chayapachay kriyaaon main kuch vyarth or hanikaarak anu bhi ban jate hai
 The number of electrons in these molecules is less than that of protons, which makes them very active and unstable
 inhen ham “mukt kan” kehete hai or ye mauka milte hi hamaare swasth anuon se electron chura lete hai, is kriya ko oxidation kehete hai
 By losing electrons, our healthy molecules also behave like free radicals
 or apane antahkaran main baithe protons kii electron-pipaasa shant karne hetu apana mukhya kaam chhod kar electrons kaa jugad karne nikal padate hai
 In this way, a series of continuous electron stealing starts, which accelerates our aging, wrinkles in the skin and we are exposed to various diseases like hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's, cancer
 They fall prey to the beginning
 mukt kan hamaare bahya vaataavaran or bhojan dwaara bhi sharir main pravesh kar jate hai
 To protect from free radicals, our body contains many molecules such as vitamin-e, vitamin-c, beta-carotene, fermenters, etc
, which contain many extra electrons and which neutralize free radicals by donating electrons to them
 Give
 inhen ham “prati-oxikaarak” yaa antioxident kehete hai
 We get anti-oxidants from a good diet consisting of fruits, vegetables and many anti-oxidants are constantly being made in our body

 koshikaon ke jirnoddhar tathaa nai koshikaon ke nirmaan kaary bhi saath saath chalata rahata he, jo jitna sucharu or snigdhata se hota rahegaa ham utana hi yuva va swasth bane rahenge
 Muco-polysaccharides prioritize the maintenance of damaged cells, especially of the heart and blood vessels
 P4D1 ek gluco-protein he
 It acts as a counter-oxidant
 iske teen mukhya kaary hai
 Chlorophyll is the most important element of wheat sorghum
 yah chloroplast naamak vishesh prakaar ke koshon main hota he
 Chloroplasts produce nutrients with the help of sun rays
 yahi kaaran he ki vaigyanik dow barshar chlorophyl ko “sankendrit suryashakti” kehete hai
 Although all green vegetation contains chlorophyll, but the chlorophyll of wheat sorghum is excellent, because in addition to chlorophyll, it contains 100 other nutritious elements
 sabhi jaanate hai ki maanav rakt main haemoglobin hota he
 This hemoglobin contains a red colored liquid called heme
 hime or chlorophyl kii rasinic sanrachana main bahut samanta hoti he
 Both have almost the same number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen and their configuration
 hime or chlorophyl kii sanrachana main keval ek hi antar he, chlorophyl ke kendra sthaan main megnesium hota he, jabaki haemoglobin ke kendra sthaan main louha hota he
 Our blood is mildly alkaline and its hydrogen molecule coefficient ph is 7
4
 jware kaa ras bhi halkaa kshareey he or uskaa ph bhi 7
4 he
 Therefore, sorghum juice is quickly absorbed into the blood and is used in the body
 gehun ke jware se maanav ko sampurna poshan mil jaataa he
 Carefully selected nutrition of 23 kg of tar is obtained from the juice of 1 kg of wheat sorghum
 sirf jware kaa ras pikar maanav puraa jivan bitaa saktaa he
 In 100 grams of fresh juice, 90-100 mg chlorophyll is obtained
 chlorophyl se hamen megnesium praapt hota he
 Each of our cells contains a small amount of magnesium
 parantu yah sharir ke liye he bahut mahatvapurn
 There is about 50 grams of magnesium in the entire body

 Disturbances in calcium-magnesium balance can weaken the nervous system
 magnesium sharir ke bheetar lagbhag teen sau anjimes kii sakriyata ke liye aavashyak he
 a clear correlation has been established between low magnesium levels and hypertension and diabetes
 vyaayaam evam shaareerik mehnat karne vaale logon ko magnesium sampurkon kii aavashyaktaa he
 Magnesium deficiency causes many problems in women, such as weakening of the leg muscles, clenching of the feet, stomach upset, decreased concentration, increased menopausal problems, increased premenstrual tension, etc
 chlorophyl hamen teen prakaar se laabh detaa he
 1- Cancer How does wheat sorghum show effect on cancer ??? oxigen ko anusandhankarta cancer koshikaon ko nestnabut karne vaali 7
62x39 mi
me
 kelibar kii wo goli maanate hai, jo gehun ke jware rupi e
ke
 47 bandook se nikal kar cancer koshikaon ko chun-chun kar maarthi he
 First of all, it contains plenty of chlorophyll, which drenches the body with oxygen
 chlorophyl sharir main haemoglobin kaa nirmaan karata he, matlab cancer koshikaon ko zyada oxigen milti he or oxigen kii upasthiti main cancer kaa dam ghutane kagta he
 Wheat sorghum contains vitamin B-17 or both lettrial and selenium
 ye donon hi shaktishaalee cancerrodhi he
 Chlorophyll and selenium strengthen the body's defense system
 gehun kaa jwara bhi rakt ke samaan halkaa kshareey dravya he
 Cancer thrives in acidic medium
 gehun kaa jwara main vita-12 ko mila kar 13 vitamin, kai khanij jaise selenium or 20 amino acids hote he
 It also contains antioxidant fermenter superoxide dismutase and another 30 enzymes
 es o di sabase khatarnaak free-radical reective oxigen spisij ko hydrogen paroxide or oxigen ke anu main badal detaa he
 In 1938, the great researcher Dr
 Paul Gerhard Caesar, M
D
 Had reported that the actual cause of cancer is the destruction of cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme that contributes to respiratory function
 saral shabdon main jab koshika main oxigen uplabdh na ho yaa saamaanya shwasan kriya baadhit ho jaye tabhi cancer janm letaa he
 The tides contain a hormone abscisic acid which we do not find elsewhere
 dow livingston whealer ke anusaar ebsisik acid koreonic gonedotropin hormone ko niskriy karata he or ve e bi e ko cancer upachaar kaa mahatvapurn poorak tatv maanati thi
 Dr
 Livingston had discovered that cancer cells produce hormones similar to chorionic goitre dotropin
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya tha ki gehun ke jware ko kaatane ke 4 ghante baad usamen e bi e kii maatra 40 guna zyada hoti he
 Therefore, according to their opinion, the juice of sorghum should be drunk a little immediately and the remaining after 4 hours
