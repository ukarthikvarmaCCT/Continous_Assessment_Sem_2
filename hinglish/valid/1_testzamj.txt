 sambhavat: isi ant: prerana ke kaaran maharishi kanad ne 'vaisheshik darshan' kaa aavirbhaav kiya
 Maharishi Kanad has designated physical quantities as matter, virtue, action, general, special and collective
 yahan 'dravya' ke antargat thos, drav, urja, gas, plasma, samay evam mukhyatya sadish lambaai ke sandarbh main dik, 'aatma' or 'man' sammilit hai
 In the Prakrit context, Vaisesika philosophy rightly states that the first four of the above mentioned substances are the direct factors of creation, and the sky, space and time are eternal and omnipresent
 vaisheshik darshan 'aatma' or 'man' ko kramash: indriya gyaan or anubhav kaa kaarak maanata he, arthath 'aatma' prekshak he or 'man' anubhav praapt karne kaa uskaa upkaran
 For this, even though being excluded from the limits of the physical quantities of the material world, the inclusion of 'soul' and 'mind' in physical quantities by Vaisesika philosophy seems justified, because these elements are absolutely necessary for observation and experience
 tathaapi aadhunik bhautikee ke anusaar 'aatma' or 'man' ke vyatirikt, prastut prabandh main 'prithvi' se 'dik' paryant vaisheshikon ke pratham saat dravyon kii vivechna karte hue bhautikee main ullikhit unke pratirupon ke saath tulanaatmak agyayan kiya jaayegaa
 According to physics, 'matter' can be considered as equivalent to physical zodiac, while according to the Vaishika, matter consists of 'ghost' and semiotic related quantities, where 'ghost' is acceptable by physical senses
 samprati bhautik raashi ko adholikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kar sakate hai-bhoot vishisht gyaan ko bhautik padaarth kehete hai
 That is, this ghost can be limited to specific knowledge related to it, or in amphibian form
 pun: bhoot ko saakshaatkaar ;, saakshaatkaar ke saanyogic sambandh or yahan tak ki indriyon se sampoorn rup se asambaddh jaanane yogya gyaan se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 In the above definition, 'specific knowledge' means - its basis, its coincidence with concomitant factor and its relation to other than base
 is hetu thos, drav, urja, gas or plasma 'bhoot' hai athwa bhinn-bhinn avasthaaon ke padaarth hai, kyonki ye bahirindriyon jaise naak, rasna, aankh, twachaa or kaan ke dwaara pratyaksh grahya hai
 Or it can be said that the special quality of material absorbed by the senses is physical material
 ye bhautik padaarth dik or kaal ke saath saanyogic sambandh rakhte hai
 The 'virtue' karma has an experience to be experienced with the ordinary, the special, the collective
 aatma or man ko, jo bhoot padaarthon ke saath saanyogic sambandh rakhte hai, ko bhautik raashi main nivisht kiya jaay athwa pruthak rup se aadhi-bhautik raashiyon ke rup main ullikhit kiya jaay isse bhautik raashiyon se sambaddh vaisheshik darshan kii vichaardhaara par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Kanad has divided physical quantities into six classes or 6 basic abstract amounts
