 Professional mountaineer Yuichiro Mura succeeded in reaching this peak of 8,850 meters
 lekin khaas baat yah he ki mura bhi usee raste se is chotii par pahunche, jis raste se lagbhag 50 saal pehle 'sar' edmund hillari ne pehali baar is chotii par fatah hasil kii thi
 Before Mura, Tomiyasu Isikawa of Japan became the oldest climber of 65 years to reach this peak
 mura ne unke record ko umr ke maamle main tod diya he
 Mura was accompanied by his son and a team of Sherpa guides

 a British mountaineering expert has claimed that 'sir' Edmund Hillary was not the first to reach Mount Everest
 balki unase teen dashak pehle hi ek british parvatarohi george malori ne yah uplabdhi hasil kar lee thi
 Graham Hoyland researched the story he heard in childhood for three decades
 kahani ke anusaar malori ne sabase pehle everest ke liye teen parvatarohan abhiyaanon main bhaag liya
 He was believed to have missed the summit
 jabaki vaastaviktaa yah he ki ve everest par pahunchne main safal ho gaye the or unka nidhan chotii se waapas lautate samay hua tha
 Malouri and his co-climber Andrew Irvine went missing in the hills in the northeast in 1924 in the final stages of their attempt to reach the world's highest peak

 Malauri's body was not discovered for 75 years

 Indeed, Dr

 Food is stored in Bakhari or Annagar
 prachinkaal main mitti ke bartanon main ann bhandaarit kiya jaataa tha
 Some farmers used to make Annagar by reinforcing raw soil with straw, which was called 'dehri'

 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea
 apni bhinn bhugolic or mausami paristhitiyon ke kaaran alag mahadwipon main band jalsambharon kii sankhya bhi bhinn he
 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia

 The twenty-third effigy, named Dharmavati, thus narrated the story- Once King Vikramaditya was sitting in the court and was talking to the courtiers
 baatcheet ke kram main darbariyon main is baat par bahes chhid gai ki manushya janm se bada hota he yaa karm se
 The debate was not coming to an end, because the court had two factions
 ek kahata tha ki manushya janm se bada hota he kyonki manushya kaa janm uske purvajanmon kaa fal hota he
 Good rites are hereditary in man just as the king's son becomes king
 uskaa vyavhaar bhi raajaaon kii tarah rahata he
 Some courtiers believed that karma is the primary
 achche kul main janme vyakti bhi durvyasano ke aadi ho jate hai or maryaada ke viruddh karmon main leen hokar patan kii ore chale jate hai
 Due to their misdeeds and misdeeds, they do not get any social status and get reproach everywhere

 Nobody was ready to change his opinion
 vikram chupchaap unki bahes kaa mazaa le rahe the
 When their debate went much further, the king ordered them to remain calm and said that they would do so by direct example
 unhone aadesh diya ki jangal se ek singh kaa baccha pakadakar laayaa jaae
 Immediately some hunters went to the forest and brought a lion's newborn cub
 unhone ek gaderiye ko bulaayaa or us navjaat shaavak ko bakrii ke bacchon ke saath-saath paalane ko kaha
 The shepherd did not understand, but he obeyed the king's order and took the master
 shaavak kii parvarish bakrii ke bacchon ke saath hone lagi
 He too started drinking goat's milk to satisfy hunger, when the goat's children grew old, they started grazing grass and leaves
 shaavak bhi pattiyaan bade chaav se khaataa
 He continued to drink milk when he was a little older, but he could not eat even if he wanted grass and leaves
 ek din jab vikram ne use shaavak kaa haal bataane ke liye bulaayaa to usne unhen bataaya ki sher kaa baccha ekadam bakriyon kii tarah vyavhaar karata he
 He pleaded with the king to allow him to feed meat to the cub, as the cub no longer likes grass and leaves
 vikram ne saafe manaa kar diya or kaha ki sirf doodh par uskaa paalan poshan kiya jaae
 The shepherd got into a confusion
 uski samaj main nahin aayaa ki maharaj ek mansabhakshi praani ko shaakaahaari banane par kyon tule hai
 He returned home
 shaavak jo ki ab jawan hone laga tha sara din bakriyon ke saath rahata or doodh peetaa
 Sometimes it would eat grass-leaves even when feeling very hungry
 anya bakriyon kii tarah jab shaam main use darbe kii taraf haanka jaataa to chupchaap sar jhukaae bad jaataa tathaa band hone par koi pratirodh nahin karata
 One day when he was grazing with other goats, a lion locked in the cage was brought
 singh ko dekhte hi sari bakriyaan darkar bhaagane lageen to vah bhi unke saath dum dabaakar bhaag gaya
 The king then asked the shepherds to keep him freely
 bhukh lagane par usne khargosh kaa shikaar kiya or apni bhukh mitaai
 After living independently for a few days, he killed small animals and started eating
 lekin gaderiye ke kehane par pinjre main shantipurvak band ho jaataa
 After a few days, he continued to be ferocious like goats
 ek din jab phir se usee sher ko jab uske saamne laayaa gaya to vah darkar nahin bhaaga
 When he heard the roar of a lion, he roared with full voice
 raja apane darbariyon ke saath sab kuch gaur se dekh rahe the
 He told the courtiers that the basic trends in humans are born like a lion's child
 avasar paakar ve pravritiyaan swat: ujagar ho jaati hai jaise ki is shaavak ke saath hua
 While living with the goats, his lion-like tendency was hidden, but on wandering freely, it was automatically revealed
 use yah sab kisi ne nahin sikhaaya
 But man should be respected according to karma
 sabhi sahamat ho gaye, magar ek mantri raja kii baton se sahamat nahin hua
 He believed that Vikram was born due to being born in Rajkula, otherwise he would not be a king even after doing deeds for seven births
 raja muskaraakar rah gaye
 Time kept on passing by
 ek din unke darbar main ek navik sundar phool lekar upasthit hua
 The flower was truly unique and people saw such a beautiful red flower for the first time
 raja phool ke udgam sthal kaa pataa lagane bhej diya
 They both grew in a boat in the direction from which the flowers had come
 nadi kii dhara kahin atyadhik sankri or teevr ho jaati thi, kahin chattaanon ke upar se bahati thi
 It was a very difficult route

 The rubbing of the chains on a large tree caused many deep wounds on his body
 un ghaavon se rakt chu rahaa tha jo nadi main girte hi raktavarna pushpon main badal jaataa tha
 At some distance, some sadhus were engrossed in austerities
 jab ve kuch or phool lekar darbar main waapas laute to mantri ne raja ko sab kuch bataaya
 Vikram then explained to him that the yogi who was hanging on the opposite side, considered him king and other saints were his courtiers
 purvajanm kaa yah karm unhen raja yaa darbari banaata he
 Now the minister understood the king's point
 usne maan liya ki purvajanm ke karm ke fal ke rup main hi kisi ko rajgaddi milti he

 iske liye chunaav main bhaag liya gaya
 The Swaraj Party had much success in the elections of 1923
 swaraj party ne 145 sthanon main se 45 sthaan jite
 The party was in the Central Legislature

 14-15 agast 1947 kii madhya raatri ko us sabha ne desh kaa shashan chalaane kii purna shaktiyaan grahan kar leen
 The Constituent Assembly gained full legislative power through Section 8 of the Act
 kintu saath hi yah anubhav kiya gaya ki samvidhan sabha ke samvidhan-nirmaan ke kaary tathaa vidhanmandal ke rup main iske saadhaaran kaary main bhed banaae rakhana jaruri hoga
 The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly as a separate body was held on 17 November 1947

 On 14 November 1948, BR Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee, presented the draft of the constitution
 prastaav ke paksh main bahumat tha
 The Constitution of the Republic of Independent India came into force on 26 January 1950
 iske kaaran aadhunik sansthagat dhaanche or uski anya sab shakha-prashakhaon sahit purna sansadeey pranali sthapit ho gai
 The Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India
 vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par pehle aam chunaavon ke baad nae samvidhan ke upbandhon ke anusaar sansad kaa gathan hone tak isi prakaar kaary karti rahi
 The first general elections under the new constitution were held in the year 1951–52
 pehali chuni hui sansad jiske do sadan the, rajyasabha or loksabhaa may, 1952 main bani; duusari lok sabha may 1957 main bani; teesri april 1962 main; chauthi march 1967 main; paanchavi maach 1971 main; 6 march 1977 main; saatvin janvari 1980 main; 8 janvari 1985 main; naveen disambar 1989 main, dasvin june 1991 or gyarahavin 1996 main bani
 The Rajya Sabha, formed for the first time in 1952, is a continuous, permanent house
 jiskaa kabhi vighatan nahin hota
 One-third of its members retire every two years
 bhartiya loktantr main sansad janata kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha he
 It is through this that the sovereignty of the common people gets expression
 sansad hi is baat kaa pramaan he ki hamaari raajnneetik vyavastha main janata sabase upar he, janamat sarvopari he
 The word 'parliamentary' itself means such a democratic political system where the supreme power is vested in that body of people's representatives, which is called 'parliament'
 bharat ke samvidhan ke adheen sangheey vidhanmandal ko ‘sansad’ kaha jaataa he
 It is the axis which is the foundation of the governance of the country
 bhartiya sansad raashtrapati or do sadanon—rajyasabha or loksabhaa—se milakar banati he
 Although the President of India is a part of the Parliament, yet he neither sits in either of the two houses nor participates in its discussions
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke donon sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 a Bill passed by both the Houses can become law only if the President gives his approval to it
 itnaa hi nahin, jab sansad ke donon sadanon kaa adhiveshan na chal rahaa ho or raashtrapati ko mahasoos ho ki in paristhitiyon main turant kaarywahi jaruri he to vah adhyadesh jari kar saktaa he
 The power and effect of this ordinance is the same as the law passed by Parliament
 loksabhaa ke liye prayek aam chunaav ke pashchaat adhiveshan ke shuru main or har saal ke pehle adhiveshan ke prarambh main raashtrapati ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke saamne abhibhaashan karata he
 He informs the Parliament of the reasons for calling the meeting of the Houses
 iske alaava vah sansad ke kisi ek sadan athwa ek saath donon ke samaksh abhibhaashan kar saktaa he
 For this he can expect the presence of members
 use sansad main us samay lambit kisi vidheyak ke sambandh main sandesh yaa koi anya sandesh kisi bhi sadan ko bhejne kaa adhikaar he
 The House to which a message has been sent in this way quickly considers the subject written in that message as convenient
 kuch prakaar ke vidheyak raashtrapati kii sifarish praapt karne ke baad hi pesh kiye ja sakate hai athwa un par aage koi kaarywahi kii ja sakati he
 As its name suggests, the Rajya Sabha is the Council of States
 yah apratyaksh reeti se logon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The member of the Rajya Sabha is elected by the elected legislators of the state legislatures
 prayek rajya ke pratinidhiyon kii sankhya zyaadaatar uski jansankhya par nirbhar karti he
 Thus, Chhattisgarh has 5 members in Rajya Sabha, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members in Rajya Sabha
 manipur, mizoram, sikkim, tripura aadi chote rajyon ke keval ek ek sadsy hai
 The Rajya Sabha can have up to 250 members
 inamen raashtrapati dwaara manonith 12 sadsy tathaa 238 rajyon or sangh-rajya kshetron dwaara chune sadsy hote hai
 The Rajya Sabha currently has 245 members
 rajyasabha ke prayek sadsy kii karyavadhi chah varsh he
 The Vice President is elected by the members of both houses of Parliament
 vah rajyasabha kaa paden sabhapati hota he
 The members of the Rajya Sabha elect one of their own for the post of Deputy Chairman
 lok sabha ke sadasyon kaa chunaav janata dwaara sidhe vot daalkar kiya jaataa he
 Every Indian citizen of the age of 18 years and above will be entitled to vote
 lok sabha ke adhiktam 530 sadsy rajyon se chunaav kshetron kii pratyaksh reeti se chune jaaenge
 a maximum of 20 members will represent the Union Territories
 iske atirikt, raashtrapati angl-bhartiya samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye do se andhik sadsy manonith kar saktaa he
 Thus the maximum number of members of the House is 552, it is envisaged in the Constitution
 lok sabha main anusuchit jatiyon tathaa anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye jansankhya-anupaat ke aadhaar par sthaan arakshit he
 Initially this reservation was for ten years
 naveenatam sanshodhan ke antargat ab yah pachaas varsh ke liye arthath san 2000 tak ke liye hai
 The term of the house in India is five years
 paanch varshon kii avadhi samaapt ho jane par sadan khud bhang ho jaataa he
 In some circumstances, Parliament can be dissolved before the full term ends
 apatkaal kii sthati main sansad lok sabha kii karyavadhi badha sakati he
 It cannot exceed one year at a time
 sansad ke donon sadanon ko, kuch maamalon ko chhodkar sabhi kshetron main samaan shaktiyaan evam darja praapt he
 Before any non-financial bill is enacted, it is required to be passed by each of the two houses
 raashtrapati par mahabhiyog chalaane, uparashtrapati ko hataane, samvidhan main sanshodhan karne or ucchtam nyaayalay evam ucch nyaayalayon ke nyaayadhishon ko hataane jaise mahatvapurn maamalon main rajyasabha ko lok sabha ke samaan shaktiyaan praapt he
 It is mandatory to place the President's Ordinances, Proclamation of Emergency and Proclamation of the failure of the constitutional system in a State and the failure of the Constitutional system in a State before both the Houses of Parliament
 kisi dhan vidheyak or samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko chhodkar anya kisi bhi vidheyak par donon sadanon ke bich asahmati ko donon sadanon dwaara sanyukt baithak main dur kiya jaataa he
 Matters are decided by majority in this meeting
 donon sadanon kii aisi baithak kaa peethasin adhikari loksabhaa kaa adhyaksh hota he
 In India, both the Prime Minister and the Minister can be a member of either of the houses
 kisi aise vyakti ko bhi pradhanmantri yaa mantri niyukt kiya ja saktaa he jo sansad ke kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy na ho, parantu use chah maas ke pashchaat pad chhodana padataa he, yadi is bich, vah donon main se kisi sadan ke liye nirvaachit na ho jaae
 The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha
 ant: uske liye yah jaruri he ki lok sabha kaa vishwaas khote hi pad-tyaag kar den
 Parliamentary rule should mean rule by Parliament
 kintu sansad swayan shashan nahin karti or na hi kar sakati he
 In a way it can be said about the Council of Ministers that it is the great executive committee of Parliament
 jise mul nikaay kii ore se shashan karne kaa uttardaayitv saunpa jaataa he
 The function of Parliament is to legislate, advise, criticize and express the grievances of the people
 karypalika kaa kaary shashan karnaa he, yadhyapi vah sansad kii ore se hi shashan karti he
 In a large and heavily populated country like India, conducting elections is a huge task
 sansad ke donon sadanon- loksabhaa or rajyasabha- ke liye chunaav berokatoke or nishpaksh hon, iske liye ek swatantra chunaav ayog banaaya gaya he
 General elections to the Lok Sabha are held when the term is over or dissolved
 bharat kaa prayek naagarik jo 18 varsh kaa yaa usase adhik ho matdaan kaa adhikari he
 The minimum age for contesting Lok Sabha elections is 25 years and for Rajya Sabha 30 years
 rajyasabha ke sadsy rajyon ke logon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They are elected by the elected members of the state legislative assembly
 rajyasabha main sthaan bharne ke liye raashtrapati, chunaav ayog dwaara sujhai gai taarikh ko, adhisuchana jari karata he
 Such notification is not issued more than three months before the date on which the retiring members expire
 chunaav adhikari, chunaav ayog ke anumodan se matdaan kaa sthaan nirdhaarit or adhishuchet karata he
 For the election of the new Lok Sabha, the President, by notification published in the Gazette, asks all the parliamentary constituencies to elect members on the date suggested by the Election Commission
 adhisuchana jari kiye jane ke pashchaat chunaav ayog namakan patr daayar karne, unki chaanbin karne, unhen waapas lene or matdaan ke liye tithiyaan nirdhaarit karata he
 Due to direct election to the Lok Sabha, the territory of India is divided into suitable territorial constituencies
 prayek sansadeey nirvachan kshetra se ek sadsy ko chunaa jaataa he
 If a member of one House is also elected to the other House, then his / her position in the first House is vacated from the date when he / she is elected to the other House
 isi prakaar, yadi vah kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke sadsy ke rup main bhi chun liya jaataa he to, yadi vah rajya vidhanmandal main apane sthaan se, rajya ke rajptr main ghoshnaa ke prakaashan se 14 dinon ke bheetar, tyaagptr nahin de detaa to, sansad kaa sadsy nahin rahata
 If a member does not attend a meeting of the House for a period of 60 days without the permission of the House, then that House can declare its place vacant
 iske alaava, kisi sadsy ko sadan main apana sthaan rikt karnaa padataa he yadi If a member is disqualified on the basis of change in terms of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, his membership may be terminated
 sansad ke yaa kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke kisi sadan ke liye hue kisi chunaav ko chunauti ucch-nyaayalay main di ja sakati he
 The petition can be moved during the election due to adopting a corrupt process
 yadi siddh ho jaae to ucch nyaayalay ko yah shakti praapt he ki vah safal ummidavaar kaa chunaav shunya ghoshit kar de
 The affected party has the right to appeal against the order of the High Court to the Supreme Court
 lok sabha prayek aam chunaav ke baad chunaav ayog dwaara adhisuchana jari kiye jane par gathit hoti he
 The first sitting of the Lok Sabha begins with the oath method
 iske nav nirvaachit sadsy ‘bharat ke samvidhan ke prati shraddha or nishtha rakhane ke liye', 'bharat kii prabhutaa or akhandta akshunn rakhane ke liye’ or ‘sansad sadsy ke kartavyon kaa shraddhapurvak nirvahan karne ke liye’ shapath lete hai
 The President invites each House of Parliament from time to time for a meeting
 prayek adhiveshan kii antim tithi ke baad raashtrapati ko chah maas ke bheetar aagaamee adhiveshan ke liye sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karnaa hota he
 Although the power to invite the Houses to the meeting is vested in the President, in practice the initiative to propose to this effect is taken by the Government
 saamanytah prativarsh sansad ke teen satr yaa adhiveshan hote hai
 Such as budget session, monsoon session and winter session
 kintu, rajyasabha ke maamle main, bajet ke adhiveshan ko do adhiveshnon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 There are three to four weeks off between these two sessions
 is prakaar rajyasabha ke ek varsh main chaar adhiveshan hote hai
 Presidential address nav nirvaachit sadasyon kii shapath ke baad adhyaksh kaa chunaav hota he
 Thereafter, the President addresses both Houses of Parliament simultaneously in the Central Hall of Parliament House
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan bahut mahatvapurn avasar hota he
 The address contains details of such policies and programs that are proposed to be implemented in the coming year
 saath hi, pehle varsh kii uski gatividhiyon or safaltaaon kii samiksha bhi di jaati he
 That address since the details of the policy of the government are prepared by the inter-government
 abhibhaashan par charchaa bahut vyapak rup se hoti he
 Amendments to the motion of thanks may also discuss matters which are not specifically mentioned in the address
 lok sabha sadan ke do sadasyon ko adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh ke rup main chunati he
 There is some tradition that the vice president is elected from among the members of the opposition
 praayah yah koshish rahati he ki adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh tathaa rajyasabha main sabhapati or upasabhapati kaa yah kaam he ki ve apane sadan kii kaarywahi ko vyavasthit dhang se niyamon ke anusaar chalaaen
 Parliamentary work can be divided into two main heads
 sarkari kaary or gaiyr-sarkari kaary
 Government work can then be divided into two categories, gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke kaary, arthath vidheyakon or sankalpon par prayek shuukravaar ke din yaa kisi aise din jo adhyaksh nirdhaarit kare dhai ghante tak charchaa kii jaati he
 The time is generally recommended by the Business Advisory Committee for various works to be done in the House
 praaia: har saptaah ek baithak hoti he
 Printed copies of the proceedings of both the Houses of Parliament are usually made available within one month after the meeting
 kaarywahi ko tepe ricard kiya jaataa he
 Session-wise printed sections of the debate are available in Hindi and English
 sarkaar apni prayek bhul chook ke liye sansad ke prati or sansad ke dwaara logon ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he
 Members of the House exercise this right, inter alia, through parliamentary questions
 sansad sadasyon ko lok mahatv ke maamalon par sarkaar ke mantriyon se jaankaree praapt karne ke liye poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 Getting information is the parliamentary right of every non-official member
 sansad sadsy ke liye logon ke pratinidhi ke rup main yah aavashyak hota he ki use apni jimmedaariyon ke paalan ke liye sarkaar ke kriyakalapon ke bare main jaankaree ho
 The basic purpose of asking questions is to get information and know the facts on a matter of public importance
 donon sadanon main prayek baithak ke prarambh main ek ghante tak prashn kiye jate hai
 And their answers are given
 ise ‘prashnkaal’ kaha jaataa he
 In addition, ministers are also tested by asking investigative and supplementary questions to see how much they understand the functioning of their departments
 prashnkaal sansad kii kaarywahiyon kaa sabase adhik dilachasp ang he
 No other work for the newspapers for the people and for the members themselves generates as much interest as the question hour produces
 is kaal ke dauraan sadan kaa vaataavaran anishchit hota he
 Sometimes a whirlwind of tension arises, sometimes it starts saying
 kabhi kabhi kisi prashn par hone vaale katu tark-vitark se uttejnaa paidaa hoti he
 Such a situation is overcome by the reaction and humor of the members or ministers
 yahi kaaran he ki prashnkaal ke dauraan na keval sadan kaksh balki darshak evam press gailariyaan bhi sadaa lagbhag bhari rahati hai
 Some questions are given an oral answer
 inhen tarankit prashn kaha jaataa he
 Unstarred questions are given written answers
 yah baat nishchit rup se kahi ja sakati he ki sadsy prashn poochne ke adhikaar kaa prayog karne main baari ruchi dikhaate rahe hai
 Since the process of questions is relatively simple and easy
 at: yah sansadeey prakriya ke anya upayon kii tulana main sansad sadasyon main adhikadhik priy hoti ja rahi he
 In both the houses of Parliament, the time immediately after the Question Hour is commonly known as 'zero Hour' or Zero Hour
 yah ek se adhik arthon main shoonyakaal hota he
 The noon time at 12 o'clock is neither the pre-noon time nor the post-midday time
 ‘shoonyakaal’ 12 baje prarambh hone ke kaaran is naam se janaa jaataa he ise ‘aavar’ bhi kaha gaya kyonki pehle ‘shoonyakaal’ puure ghante tak chalata tha, arthath 1 baje din main sadan kaa din ke bhojan ke liye avkaash hone tak
 No one can say what matter arises during this period or what kind of attack should be made on the government
 niyamon main ‘shoonyakaal’ kaa kahin bhi koi ullekh nahin he
 At the end of the Question Hour, the members stand to raise such matters, which they feel that action cannot be delayed
 haalaanki is prakaar maamle uthaane ke liye niyamon main koi upbandh nahin he
 It seems that the idea behind this practice has been that such rules which are a hindrance for the members in raising matters of national importance or serious grievances of the people in the House immediately, are meaningless
 niyamon kii drushti se tathakthith ‘shoonyakaal’ ek aniyamitata he
 Since matters are taken up without permission or without prior notice, it wastes valuable time of the House
 isse sadan ke vidhaayi, vittiya or anya niyamit kaary kaa atikaraman hota he
 Now, on the basis of the information already given to some of the matters raised in the Zero Hour, with the permission of the Speaker, a list has also been started
 sansad ke donon sadanon ke niyamon main lok mahatv ke maamle bina deree ke or kai prakaar se uthaane kii vyavastha he
 The various processes available to each member are as follows: iske dwaara lok sabha ke niyamit kaam-kaaj ko rokkar tatkaal mahatvuparn maamle par charchaa karai ja sakati he
 Through this, any member can bring the attention of the government to the matter of immediate importance
 mantri ko us maamle main bayaan dena hota he
 Each member who calls attention has the right to ask a question
 inke dwaara tatkaal mahatv ke prashnon par ek ghante kii charchaa kii ja sakati he
 However, there is no voting on it
 hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhi kis tarah aise maamle uthaane kaa prayaas karte hai jinka niyamon evam viniyamon kii vyakhya se koi sambandh nahin hota
 But these cases are provoking him and the people of his constituency at that time
 jo maamle vyavastha ke prashn nahin hote yaa jo prashnon, alp-soochna prashnon, dhyanakarshan prastaavon aadi se sambandhit niyamon ke adheen nahin uthaae ja sakate, ve iske adheen uthaae jate hai
 The House makes a number of decisions on various matters of public importance and expresses its opinion
 koi bhi sadsy ek prastaav ke rup main koi suzav sadan ke samaksh rakh saktaa he
 In which his opinion or wish has been given
 yadi sadan use sweekaar kar letaa he to vah samooche sadan kii raay yaa ichha ban jaati he
 In the end, the 'proposal' is broadly brought before the House to know the decision of the House
 prastaav vastav main sansadeey kaarywahi kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Any matter of public importance can be the subject of a motion
 prastaav bhinn bhinn sadasyon dwaara bhinn bhinn prayojanon se pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 The proposals can be moved by ministers and also by non-government members
 gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara pesh kiye jane vaale prastaavon kaa uddeshy saamanytah kisi maamle par sarkaar kii raay yaa vichaar jaananaa hota he
 The resolution is also a procedural measure, it is available to members and ministers to raise a discussion in the House on a matter of common interest
 saamaanya rup ke prastaavon ke samaan sankalp, raay yaa sifarish kii ghoshnaa ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Or in any other form as the Speaker may deem appropriate
 mantriparishad tab tak padasin rahati he jab tak use lok sabha kaa vishwaas praapt ho
 The government has to resign constitutionally as soon as the Lok Sabha expresses distrust in the Council of Ministers
 niyamon main is aashay kaa ek prastaav pesh karne kaa upbandh he jise ‘avishvaas prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to consider a motion of no confidence
 ninda prastaav avishvaas ke prastaav se bhinn hota he
 The motion of no-confidence does not mention the reasons on which it is based
 parantu ninda prastaav main aise kaarnon yaa aaropon kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The proposal is intended to condemn the government for certain policies and actions
 ninda prastaav mantriparishad ke viruddh yaa kisi ek mantri ke viruddh yaa kuch mantriyon ke viruddh pesh kiya jaataa he
 It expresses regret, indignation or surprise by the House over the failure of any minister or ministers
 sarkaar ko shashan, suraksha or jan kalyaan ke bahut se kaam karne hote hai
 All this requires a lot of resources
 ye aaen kahan se? sarkaar janata se kar vasuulati he
 It also takes loans when needed
 kyonki ham sansadeey vyavastha main rahete hai, sarkaar ke liye yah jaruri he ki koi bhi kar lagane yaa koi bhi kharchaa karne se pehle vah sansad kii manjuuri le
 In order to get this approval, every year the government presents a budget i
e
 the full year income and expenditure accounts in Parliament
 rail bajet or saamaanya bajet alag alag pesh kiye jate hai
 The general budget is usually brought on the last working day of February
 rail bajet usase kuch din pehle aa jaataa he
 The financial year begins at the first April of each year at this time
 bajet main is aashay kaa prastaav hota he ki aane vaale saal ke dauraan kis mad par kitna dhan kharch kiya janaa he
 How much money will come from it or from where it will be raised
 bajet ke aagaamee varsh ke liye anudaan die jate hai
 The government gets an opportunity to explain and explain its financial and economic policies and programs
 saath hi, sansad ko un par vichaar karne or unki aalochana karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa he
 In the process of passing the budget, serious and full discussion takes place in both houses of Parliament
 yah bajet pesh kiye jane ke kuch din baad hoti he
 The discussion begins with a general debate
 yah sansad ke donon sadanon main teen yaa chaar din tak chalati he
 The practice is that at this stage the members consider only the general aspects of the government's fiscal and economic policies
 kar lagane tathaa kharch ke byore main nahin jate
 Thus, the General Debate gives each House an opportunity to express its views
 sarkaar ko bhi abhas ho jaataa he ki kisi prastaav vishesh ke prati baad kii avasthaaon main kya pratikriya hogi
 It is to be noted that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with the budget other than general discussion
 maangon par matdaan keval lok sabha main hota he
 The second stage is to discuss and vote on the demands for grants
 saamanytah prayek mantralay ke liye prastaavit anudaanon ke liye alag maange rakhi jaati hai
 These 'demands' are related to the expenditure part of the budget
 inkaa swaroop karypalika dwaara lok sabha ke liye kiye gaye nivedan kaa he ki maangi gai raashi ko kharch karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 Discussion on demands is interesting
 charchaa ke dauraan mantralay kii nitiyon or kriyakalapon kii baariki se chaanbin kii jaati he
 Members may do so by presenting supporting proposals for the original proposal for demands for grants
 in sahaayak prastaavon ko sansadeey bhashaa main ‘katautee prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The process of passing the budget, from the presentation of the budget, goes on to discuss it and accept the demands for grants and till the passing of appropriations and finance bills, usually after the commencement of the current financial year
 jab tak sansad, maangen sweekrut nahin kar leti tab tak ke liye yah aavashyak he ki desh kaa prashasan chalaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas paryaapt dhan uplabdh ho
 Therefore, special provision has been made for 'vote on Account'
 jiske dwaara loksabhaa ko shakti di gai he ki vah bajet kii prakriya puri hone tak kisi vittiya varsh ke ek bhaag ke liye peshgi anudaan de sakati he
 Legislation is considered to be the primary function of Parliament
 iske liye pahal adhikanshtah karypalika dwaara kii jaati he
 The government makes legislative proposals
 us par charchaa tathaa vaad vivaad ke pashchaat sansad us par anumodan kii apni muhar lagaati he
 All legal proposals are introduced in Parliament in the form of a Bill
 vidheyak vidhaayi prastaav kaa masauda hota he
 The Bill can be introduced in any one House of Parliament by the Government or by a non-official member
 is prakaar mote taur par, vidheyak do prakaar ke hote hai: sarkari vidheyak or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke vidheyak
 Most bills taking the form of legislation are government bills
 vaise to gaiyr sarkari sadasyon ke bahut kam vidheyak vidhi kaa rup lete hai
 Nevertheless, it is brought to their notice by the government and people that there is a need to amend the existing law or make any necessary legislation
 vidheyak kaa masauda us vishay se sambandhit sarkaar ke mantralay main vidhi mantralay kii sahaayta se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 After approval of the Cabinet, it is brought before the Parliament
 sambandhit mantri dwaara use sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Only in case of money bill it is prohibited that it cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 adhinium kaa rup lene se purv vidheyak ko sansad main vibhinn avasthaaon se guzarana padataa he
 Each Bill has three promises in each House
 arthath pehla vaachan, doosraa vaachan or teesraa vaachan
 The introduction of the Bill is the first reading of the Bill
 pratha ke anusaar is avasthaa main charchaa nahin kii jaati he
 The second reading of the Bill is the most elaborate and important stage because it is examined in detail and closely
 jab vidheyak ke sabhi khando par or anusoochiyon par, yadi koi hon, sadan vichaar kar unhen sweekrut kar letaa he
 The minister can then propose that the bill be passed
 yah teesraa vaachan kehalaata he
 After it is passed in the House in which the Bill is introduced, it is sent to another House for concurrence
 vahaan vidheyak phir in teenon avasthaaon main se gujarata he
 An extraordinary situation arises when there is a deadlock due to disagreement between the two on a bill
 jiskaa samaadhaan donon sadanon kii sanyukt baithak main hota he
 When a bill is passed separately or jointly by both the Houses, it is sent to the President

 "galaksi" shabd kaa mul unani bhashaa kaa "gaala" shabd he, jiskaa arth bhi doodh hota he

 There are very few astronomers who do both because different fields require different proficiency, but most professional astronomers find themselves on one of the two sides
 khagoliki brahmad main avasthit akashiya pindon kaa prakaash, udbhav, sanrachana or unke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan khagoliki kaa vishay he
 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system
 sthaneey nakshatra pranali akaash ganga ke antargat prati second 200 mile kii gati se chal rahi he or sampurna akaash ganga duurastha bahya jyortimalaon ke antargat prati second 100 mile kii gati se vibhinn dishaao main gum rahi he
 The Moon is a satellite of the Earth on which human steps have reached
 is brahmad main sabase vismayakari drishy he- akaash ganga kaa drishy
 Every person can see them with naked eyes in the open sky of night

 But just before dawn, it flows from northeast to west and south
 dekhne main akaash ganga ke taare paraspar sambhddha se lagate hai, par yah drushti bhram he
 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana
 Apart from this, it is not possible to express the vastness, generality of the universe in other words

 Nowadays, two eminent scientists of our country, Dr
 S
 Chandrasekhar and Dr
 Jayant Vishnu Narlikar are also involved in solving the mysteries of the universe
 bahut pehle koparnicus, tiko brahe or mukhyat: capler ne khagol vidya main mahatvaparnu kaary kiya tha
 The three laws that Kepler has proposed in relation to the motion of planets remain the cornerstone of astrophysics
 khagol vidya main newton kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn rahaa he
 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 Oxytocin, also known as alpha-hypophymin, is biochemically credited with being first sequenced and synthesized in 1953 by Vincent du Vignaud et al
 oxitosin mahila prajnan main apni bhoomikaaon ke liye sarvshereshth rup se janaa jaataa he: 1) yah prasav kaal ke dauraan garbhashay greeva or yoni ke failaav or 2) stnegar kii uttejnaa ke baad prachur maatra main sravit hota he, jisase kramash: prasav or stanpan sahaj hota he
 Recent studies have begun to investigate the role of oxytocin in a variety of behaviors including orgasm, social recognition, pairing, anxiety, trust, love, and maternal behaviors
 oxitosin kii paridhiy kriyaayein hoti hai or isaki mastishk main bhi kriyaayein hoti hai
 Oxytocin actions are mediated by specific, high affinity receptors
 oxitosin abhigraahak ek G-protein-yugmit abhigraahak hota he jiske liye Mg2+ or kalestrol kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It belongs to the rhodopsin-type group of G-protein-coupled receptors
 oxitosin ke paridhiy kaary mukhya rup se piyush granthi se hone vaale srav ko darshaate hai
 It is also important to note that more studies have been done to test sexual arousal in women than men
 striyaan purushon kii tulana main adhik lambey samay tak kamonmad kaa anubhav karti hai or unamem spasht rup se nirdhaarit chakron jaise ki masik dharm, stanpan, rajonivritti or garbhavastha ke saath ek adhik jatil prajnan sambandhi ant:sravi pranali hoti he
 This allows more opportunities to measure and test hormones related to sexual stimulation
 oxitosin santosh kii bhaawanaaon, chintaa main kami, saathi ke prati shanti or suraksha kii bhaawanaaon ko taaja karata he
 To reach full orgasm, it is necessary that brain regions are associated with behavioral control, fear and anxiety become dysfunctional; Which allows individuals to forget fear and anxiety during sexual stimulation
 kai adhyayanon ne pehle hi saamaajik bandhan ke saath oxitosin ke sahasambandh, vishwaas main vruddhi or bhay main kami ko darshaya he
 One study confirmed that there was a positive correlation between oxytocin plasma levels and an anxiolytic scale measuring adult courtship attachment
 yah suzav detaa he ki vyavahaaravaadi niyantran, bhay or chintaa se jude hue mastishk pradeshon ke avarodhan ke liye oxitosin mahatvapurn ho saktaa he, is prakaar kamonmad utpann hone detaa he
 Oxytocin emitted from the pituitary gland cannot re-enter the brain due to blood – brain barrier

 Oxytocin receptors are expressed by neurons in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, including the amygdala, anterior and medial subacute, membranes, nuclear positions, and brainstem
 kritrim oxitosin vyavsaayik naam pitosin or sintosinon tathaa saamaanya naam oxitosin se trademark yukt aushadhi ke rup main beche jate hai
 Oxytocin is destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract and should therefore be used by injection or as a nasal spray
 oxitosin kaa rakt main apane teen minuton kaa aadha jivan kaal hota he
 Due to intravenous oxytocin, it does not enter the brain in significant amounts - it is removed from the brain by the blood-brain conductor
 naak main phuhaar ke dwaara adhik maatra main oxitosin ke CNS pravesh kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 Oxytocin nasal sprays have been used to speed up breastfeeding, but the efficacy of this approach is questionable

 Some have suggested that the confidence-inducing properties of oxytocin may help those who suffer from social concerns and mood disorders, while others have noted the potential for misuse with trust tricks and military applications
 It is noted for
 nirdhaarit khuraaq ke rup main upyog karne par oxitosin apekshaakrit rup se surakshit hota he
 Possible side effects include: saanchaa:proteinoyksitoysina peptid OXT jin se ek niskriy purvagami protein ke rup main sanshleshit hota he
 This foregoing protein also contains the oxytocin carrier protein neophyzine
 niskriy purvagami protein anzimon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se uttarottar chote tukdon main jalaapantit hota he
 The final hydrolysis that secretes active oxytocin nonapeptide is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase
 PAM anzime pranali kii kriyavidhi escorbett par nirbhar hoti he jo ek aavashyak vitamin tatv hota he
 Coincidentally, it was discovered that sodium ascorbate itself increased the production of oxytocin from ovarian tissue in a variety of concentrations in a dose-dependent manner
 saamaan prakaar ke kai utak, jahaan PAM paaya jaataa he ve vitamin si kii ucch sandratha kaa sanchay karne ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 In the hypothalamus, oxytocin is formed in the macrocellular neural secretory cells of the epiglottis and the parasympathetic nucleus and is stored in the herring bodies of the neural margin in the posterior pituitary
 phir yah piyushika granthi ke prishth khand se rakt main sravit hota he
 These neurons have bifurcations that stimulate oxytocin receptors in nuclear conditions
 oxitosin ke paridhiy hormone sambandhi or vyavahaaravaadi mastishk prabhaav ke bare main yah suzav diya gaya he kii ve in samparshvon se aam taur par hone vaale sraavon ke madhyam se samanvit hote hai
 Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the parasympathetic nucleus that migrate to other parts of the brain and spinal cord
 prajatiyon ke aadhaar par, oxitosin-abhigraahak ko abhivyakt karne vaali koshikaayen ant kshetra main sthit hote hai, jisamen pramastishkakhand or anty rekha ke kendrak-shayya bhi hote hai
 In the pituitary gland, oxytocin is loaded into a large, dense-core vesicle, where it is bound to the neophyzine by the method shown in the diagram; Neophysin is the larger peptide fraction of the larger precursor protein molecule from which oxytocin is obtained by digestive cleavage
 tantrika sravi shira ke siron se oxitosin ke srav ko hypothalemus main oxitosin koshikaon ke vidyut gatividhi ke dwaara viniyamit kiya jaataa he
 These cells produce action potentials that are transmitted from the nerve to the ends of the vein; These ends consist of a large number of oxytocin-bearing vesicles, which are secreted by cellular extravasation when the veins are depolarized
 mastishk ke baahar, oxitosin dhaaran karne vaali koshikaon kii pahchaan vibhinn utakon main kii gai hai jinamein pit-pind, ladikh kii interaaleey koshikaayen, retina, aadhivrikk majja, placenta, thimus or agnyashay shaamil hai
 Substantial findings of this exquisitely "neurohypophysical" hormone outside the central nervous system raise many questions related to its potential importance in these various tissues
 oxitosin jugalee karne vaale pashuon or nar vaanron sahit vibhinn prajatiyon ke pit-pindon dwaara sanshleshit hote hai
 Along with estrogen, it is involved in the endometrial synthesis of prostaglandin F2α to produce the renal cleavage
 kuch prajatiyon main ladikh koshikaon ko nae sire se vrushan sambandhi oxitosin de novo kaa nirmaan karne ke liye jaev sanshleshit yantra dhaaran karte hue bhi dikhaaya gaya he, chuhon main or gini ke siiron main jinhen apane aahaaron main vitamin si ke bahirzaat strot kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids
 anukram he cys – tyr – ile – glu – asp – cys – pro – leu – gly 
 Cysteine residues form a sulfur bridge
 oxitosin kaa aanvik dravyaman 1007 dalton hota he
 One international unit of oxytocin is equivalent to 2 micrograms of pure peptide
 oxitosin kaa jaivik rup se sakriya rup, jise aam taur par RIA or / yaa HPLC takneekon ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, octapeptid "oxitosin dicelphide" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, lekin oxitosin oxitosin kahe jane vaale ek ksheen dithaol nonapeptid ke rup main bhi paaya jaataa he
 It has been theorized that open-chain oxytocin can also act as an independent scavenger; Oxytocin can then be oxidized back to oxytocin via the redox potential of dehydroascorbate ascorbate
 oxitosin kii sanrachana vaisoprasin ke saamaan hoti he, isamen ek sulfur sethu vaala ek nonapeptid bhi hota he jiskaa anukram oxitosin se 2 amino amla se bhinn hota he
 a table showing the sequences of members of the potent family of vasopressin / oxytocin and the species expressing them is available in the vasopressin article
 1953 main oxitosin or vaisoprasin ko vincent du vignaod ke dwaara pruthak or sanshleshit kiya gaya, jis kaary ke liye unhen 1955 main rasayan vigyaan main nobel puraskaar praapt hua
 Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary gland of humans to function remotely
 haalanki, oxitosin neurons anya peptidon kaa nirmaan karte hai, jisamen udhaaharan ke liye, corticotropin-sravit karne vaale hormone or doynorphine shaamil hai, jo sthaneey rup se kaary karte hai
 Neurons with large cells that make oxytocin are adjacent to neurons with macro cells that make vasopressin and are similar in many respects
 manushyon main oxitosin abhigraahak kaa anek yugmavikalpi hota he, jo unki prabhavakaarita main bhinn hota he
 Individuals are homozygous for the "G" allele, when compared to the carriers of the "A" allele, they exhibit empathy, low response to stress, as well as operating autism and poor parental skills
 lagbhag sabhi kasheruki jantuon main ek oxitosin ke sadrush nonapeptid hormone hota he jo prajnan sambandhi kaaryon kii sahaayta karata he or ek vaisoprasin-sadrush nonapeptid hormone hota he jo jal ke niyantran main shaamil hota he

 Kavindra is said to have played a special role in making them religiously liberal
 shahjahan ne apane shasankaal main hinduon par yatrakar lagaaya tha
 Kavindra became a representative of Varanasi pandits and representatives of the Hindu public, forcing them to do forced forcibly committing pilgrimage, and Shahjahan became very sad when he described the atrocities on Hindus by Muslim authorities
 And under his influence, not only did he issue the royal decree and stop traveling, but Kavindra was given the 'sarvavidyanidhan' sub

 The story of Savitri and Satyavan is first found in the Vanaparva of the Mahabharata
 jab yudhisthir markandeya rishi se poochhte hai ki kya kabhi koi or stri thi jisane draupadi jitna bhakthi pradarshit kii? Savitri was the only daughter of the famous philosopher Rajarshi Ashwapati
 apane var kii khoj main jate samay usne nirvasit or vanavaasi raja dyumtsen ke putr satyavan ko patirup main sweekaar kar liya
 When Devarshi Narada told him that Satyavan's age was only one year left, Savitri said with great firmness that whatever had to happen had already happened
 mata-pita ne bhi bahut samajhaayaa, parantu sati apane dharm se nahin digi! Savitri gets married to Satyavan
 satyavan bade dharmatma, mata-pita ke bhakt evam susheel the
 Savitri left the palace and came to the hut of the forest
 aate hi usne saare vastrabhupanon ko tyagkar saas-sasur or pati jaise valkal ke vastra pahante the vaise hi pahan liye or apana sara samay apane andhe saas-sasur kii seva main bitaane lagi
 The day of Satyavan's death drew near
 satyavan aginhotra ke liye jangal main lakdiyaan kaatane jaaya karte the
 Today is the day of the great journey of Satyavan
 savitri chintit ho rahi he
 Satyavan picked up the ax and proceeded to cut wood towards the forest
 savitri ne bhi saath chalane ke liye atyant aagrah kiya
 After getting Satyavan's approval and taking permission from her mother-in-law, Savitri also went to the forest with her husband
 satyawan lakdiyaan kaatane vrikshapar chadhe, parantu turant hi unhen chakkar aane laga or ve kulhadi phenkakar neeche utar aaye
 Keeping her husband's head in her lap, Savitri started airing them from her area

 He forcefully pulled the man from the body of Satyavan, equal to the thumb tied in a hanging cord
 savitri ne atyant vyakul hokar aart swar main poocha- he dev! aap koun hai or mere in hridaydhan ko kahan le ja rahe hai? us purush ne uttar diya- he tapaswini! tum pativrata ho, at: main tumhen bataata hoon ki main yama hoon or aaj tumhaare pati satyavan kii aayu ksheen ho gayi he, at: main use baandhakar le ja rahaa hoon

 Savitri also started following Yama
 yama ne bahut manaa kiya
 Savitri said- i should go where my husband goes

 Yama kept refusing again and again, but Savitri followed back and forth
 uski is drudh nishtha or pativratadharm se prasann hokar yama ne ek-ek karke vararoop main savitri ke andhe saas-sasur ko ankhen deen, khoyaa hua rajya diya, uske pita ko sau putr diye or savitri ko laut jane ko kaha
 But Yamraj was taking Savitri's life, how would she return? Yamraj again said that whatever you ask except Satyavan, Savitri said - If you are happy, then give me hundred sons from Satyavan
 yama ne bina hi soche prasann man se tathastu kah diya
 Committed Yamraj proceeded
 savitri ne kaha- mere pati ko aap liye ja rahe hai or mujhe sau putron kaa var diye ja rahe hai
 How is this possible? i do not wish anyone happiness, heaven and Lakshmi without a husband
 bina pati main jina bhi nahin chaahati
 Committed Yamraj freed Satyavan's subtle body and returned it to Savitri and gave Satyavan a new age of four hundred years

 According to this belief, in May 1956, the fulfillment of 2500 years from Nirvana was accepted

 This fact was given to Parinirvana in BC

 Sixth century BC It would not be appropriate to say that world history is awakening

 The first half of the sixth century has been called the era of "shodash Mahajanapadas"

 The vast Indus civilization preceding the Aryans had disappeared, but the process of assimilation of its residual traditions into the Arya Samaj was still in progress
 vaidic yug main arya evam aryetar saanskrithik paramparaon kaa paraspar samanvay bhartiya itihaas kii nirnaayak ghatnaon main he
 While this process led to the development of Chaturvarnya and change from Aryabhasa, on the other hand important new trends were born in the spiritual field
 buddha kaa yug gahan vichaarmanthan kaa yug tha jab ki naanaa brahman or shraman apane vibhinn maton kaa pratipaadan karte the or buddha kii khoj evam upadesh kaa sambandh in prachlit vichaardhaaraon se sthapit karne kaa ytn itihaaskaar ke liye swaabhaavik he
 According to one view, the development of the ideology which is available in the Upanishads should be seen in Buddhism
 kintu yah smaraneey he ki us yug main "brahman" or "shraman" kaa parthxy rnivivaad tha, yahan tak ki patanjali ne "yeshan c virodh: shashvatik: is panineey sutara kii vyakhya ke prasang main "ahinakulam" ke samaan "brahman shramnam" kaa udhaaharan diya he
 Therefore, according to the aforesaid view, the origin of Buddhism has to be considered under Brahmin ideology but Shramanabahi, which is Pramanavirudh, or Shramana ideology itself, will have to be considered as the core attached to Vedic Brahmin ideology, which is at least now the non-sense of Jainism
 Being unquestionable is unacceptable
 ek swatantra kshatriya parampara kii udbhaavna asiddh he
 It is true that many Kshatriya rulers participate in the philosophical discussion in the Upanishads, in the Gita, and in the Buddhist and Jain proceeds, but their views are different and they can be interred with the Vedic religion or the Shramana religion
 at: aisa prathit hota he ki yadhyapi mahashraman bhagwaan buddha ko mulat: shraman samudaay evam parampara ke antargat maananaa chahie tathaapi yah sweekaar karne main koi dosha nahin he ki kuch dishaao main unke pratipaadan or upanishdon main pravritisamya se un par vaidic prabhaav suchit hota he
 Vedic religion was originally trend-oriented, Shramana sect was self-centered
 nivritti kaa praadhanya sansarwaad ke abhyupagam par ashrith tha
 In parallel, worldism was unknown in ancient Vaidak religion
 upanishdon main gyancharchaa ke saath kuch sthalon par sansarwaad abhasith he
 For this reason, it has often been proposed that the origin of divergent streams should be considered from these places of the Upanishads
 arthath sankhya or yoga, jain or buddha dharm sabhi kaa mul utsa upanishdon main hi kahin na kahin khojna chahie
 Behind this belief is the belief that pre-buddha or representative thinking is stored in Upanishads
 vastut: is prakaar kii aitihaasik paristhitiyon main anuplabdhi se abhaav siddh nahin hota at: aise "argumentm eks cylentio" ko hetvabhaas hi maananaa chahie
 On the other hand, Jains and Buddhists all declare their own freedom, instead of accepting their Vedic teachings
 puratatvikon ne yah siddh kar diya he ki arya vaidic parampara ke purv or atirikt ek sabhyataa kii parampara i
pus
 tritiy or dwitiya sahastrabdiyon main bharat main vidit thi atev vibhinn shraman paramparaon kaa avaidic athwa aryetareey mul ab asambhav nahin lagata
 Due to this possibility, the non-sense of origin of these traditions is an emergency, and the proof of its neutrality rests with the defendant
 jahaan tak upanishdon main uplabdh "sansarwaad" athwa "sankhya" aadi ke mul kaa prashn he, yah sambhav he ki swayan upanishdon par dharantar kaa prabhaav kalpaneey he
 As a result, where earlier the Vedic origins of Buddhism were generally unanimous, now this view has to be called questionable in the context of archaeological and historical discovery
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki buddha dharm par vaidic prabhaav sandigdh he
 In fact, even though Lord Buddha's meditation took place in Shramana background in destiny and enlightenment, his metaphorical presentation or descent can be understood only by the intellect of the erstwhile Shramana Abhyapagams
 vaidic chintan main jagat ke mul tatv kii khoj teen mukhya dishaao main kii gai
 On the one hand, the man was considered the creator of the world
 duusari or jal, vaayu aadi tattvon main se kisi ek ko jagat kaa mul upadan kaha gaya
 In this direction, the material element was also conceived as Sat or Asat
 teesri disha main jaagtik parivartanon kii niyamvatta dekhakar krit or dharm kii udbhaavna kii gai
 Considering the nature of man, body, senses, speech, soul, mind and knowledge respectively were considered to be the hallmarks of his original form
 antat: yah nishchit kiya gaya ki purush athwa aatma gyanaswaroop he, ek sat hi jagat kaa upadan or brahm padvachya he or aatma evam brahm gyaan evam sat paraspar abhinn hai
 This is the principle of Aupanishadic Atma Dvaita or Brahmadvaita
 kuch sthalon par aatma yaa brahm ko anirvachaneey evam sat or asat ke pare bhi kaha gaya he
 The doctrine of religion practiced in the Upanishads became spontaneously synthesized with the prevailing karmism because karma-fruit-niyam could be said to be the most serious regulator of human life and creation
 is siddhant kaa vishad or vistrut pratipaadan un naanaa shraman sampradaayon main dekha ja saktaa tha jinke maton kaa ullekh pracheen buddha or jain aagmon main praapt hota he
 According to Didhinikaya's well-known Samanjafal Sutanta, Purna Kashyap, Prakudha Katyayan, Ajit Keshambali, Sanjay Beldiputra, Goshal and Nirgrantha were the famous Shramana Parivaraja Ganacharya contemporary to the known Buddha
 anyatra kaalwad, swabhaavvaad niyatwaad, agyanavaad, akriyavaad, kriyavaad, shashwatvaad uchchhedwad aadi drushtiyon kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 Most thinkers considered the organism's birth-to-birth conversion to be regressive and systematic by karma-fruit-niyam, but there was a vast and complex difference of opinion regarding the living, karma and means of salvation
 brahman or shraman vichaarkon dwaara pratipaadit parmarth or vyavhaar sambandhi in dharanaon or pravritiyon ke parivesh main hi bhagwaan buddha ne dharmachakr kaa pravartan kiya
 Authentic content about the life of Buddha is sparse
 is prasang main uplabdh adhikansh vrittant evam kathanak parivarti evam bhaktipradhan rachanaayen hai
 Among the oldest material, few details of the Buddha's visitation, enlightenment, dharmachakra propagation and Mahaparinirvana are available at some places in Pali Tripitaka
 yah smaraneey he ki didhanikaay ke mahapadansuttant se siddh hota he ki isi avasthaa main bauddhagan kaa aagrah bhagwaan buddha ke jeevancharit ke vistrut aitihaasik sangrah main na hokar usamen ek "dharmata" athwa sab budhon ke liye ek anivaary or niyat kram ko pradarshit kar sakane main tha
 For this reason, the historical memory in the biographical literature of Gautama Buddha was covered with imaginations inspired by the ideal of Buddhism in the same way as Aranyapath in Chaturmasya
 buddha kii jeevani ke aadhunik vivaran praaia: pali kii nidankatha athwa sanskrit ke mahavastu, lalitvistar evam ashwaghosh krit buddhacharit par aadhaarit hote hai
 But the historicity of these details can be accepted only as far as ancient support is available for them

 There was a lot of controversy over what the original teachings of Lord Buddha were
 swayan baudhon main kalantar main naanaa sampradaayon kaa janm or vikaas hua or ve sabhi apane ko buddha se anupranit maanate hai
 Buddhavakha is also not equally preserved in different sects
 or phir jitna unke naam se sangrakshit he, vibhinn bhashaaon or sampradaayon main, hinayan or mahayan main, un sab ko buddhaprokt koi bhi itihaaskaar nahin maan saktaa
 Clearly, many changes and additions have to be accepted in the collection and preservation of the buddha, and there is no more reasonable alternative to historical criticism than to consider its finished form the result of a long-term development

 It would not be inappropriate to imagine that Lord Buddha pointed out the simple, practical and poignant manner towards serious spiritual truth and that the collection, interpretation, definition, classification, etc
 of these symbolic expressions developed many communal principles

 pratham arya satya kii mimasaa karte hue baudhon ne trividhdu:khata kaa pratipaadan kiya he - du:kha du:khata jo samvednaatmak sthool du:kha he, parinaam du:khata jo ki sukh ke anyathaabhaav se vyakt hoti he, evam sanskaradu:khata jo sanskaron kii sanchalanaatmakataa he
 Because of this sanskaradukta khata, "sarvan Saddam" does not cause adultery anywhere
 du:kha ke sookshm evam virat rup kaa samyagbodh aadhyatmik samvedansheeltaa ke viksit hone par hi sambhav hota he
 According to Buddhists, when the grief is being interviewed, there is an illusion of Aryatva leaving the state of separation
 dwitiya arya satya prathithyasamutpaada hi he
 There are many ancient and new interpretations of Pratyasamutpada
 kuch vyakhyakaaron ne prathithyasamutpaada kaa mam kaary-kaaran-bhav kaa bodh evam uskaa aadhyatmik kshetra main prayog bataaya he
 avidya-sanskar-vigyan-naam-roop-conspiracy-sparsh-vedana, Trishna, Upadana, Bhava, Jati, Jara, Meran, the tradition of these remedies or causes is a reflection of reality
 ek anya vyakhya ke anusaar prathithyasamutpaada shaashvat or uchchhed sadrush paraspar viruddh anton kaa varjan karanevaali madhyam pratipad he
 The meaning of this medium pattern is on the one hand the nature of the world and on the other hand, all things are said to be non-observable or innocuous
 spasht hi, in or anya anek vyakhyaaon main ek mul avishlisht bhav kaa vividh vikaas dekha jaataa he
 The third Arya truth is sadism
 yahan par yah prashn swaabhaavik he ki kya nirvana kaa ek abhaavmaatr he? kuch sautraantikon ko chhodkar anya buddha sampradaayon main nirvana ko bhav rup nahin sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Stylishists consider nirvana as sentiment, Vaibhashika dharmasabhav form, yogacharana and form, and the secondary quadratic uninterrupted void form
 itnaa nihsandeh he ki nirvana main du:kha, klesh karm or avidya kaa abhaav he
 Nirvana is the ultimate calm and ultimate meaning, uncoordinated, formless and indescribable
 aadhyatmik sadhana main jaise jaise chitt shuddh, prabhaswar or shant hota jaataa he vaise vaise hi vah nirvana ke abhimukh hota he
 It does not seem possible to establish the predecessors or child relationships of the last stage or goal of Chittasanti with this means
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye anek upayon kaa avishkaar kiya gaya tha, tathaa vaibhashikon ke dwaara "prapti" or "aprapti" naam ke vishisht dharmon kii kalpana
 In fact, there is no other way than the ashram of indeterminacy in the last stage
 praaia: nirvana kii bhavabhavata kaa prashn sabhipraay hota he
 Among Buddhist sects other than the Pudgalists, the utter disdain of the power of soul or creature is considered to be the intention of Buddha
 praaia: is prakaar kaa atmatatv tathaa nairatmyavad buddha drushti kii visheshta bataai jaati he
 In Buddhist philosophy, the infinite impact of five wings is accepted in place of the soul
 paanch skandh hai - rup, vigyaan, vednaa, sangya evam sanskaar
 The previous relation of the winged child is subject to the suffix or the suffix
 anubhav ke ghatak in anek or anitya tatwon main koi bhi aisa sthir or samaan tatv nahin he jise aatma mana ja sake
 In such a situation, without karta and bhakta, the power of karma and enjoyment has to be accepted
 athwa yah kahana chahie ki karm or bhoga main hi kartrutv or bhoktrutv ko pratibhasith yaa adhyast maananaa hoga
 In this philosophy, only samskara or lust were considered sufficient to explain memory and reflection
 is prakaar ke nairatmya ke sweekaar karne par nirvana anubhav ke abhaav ke atirikt or ho hi kya saktaa he? sankhya, yoga or vedant main chittanirodh hone par aatma swaroop pratishthit hoti he, arthath agyaan kii nivritti hone par aatm gyaan kii prapti hoti he
 In Jain philosophy, a person achieves his transcendental form and power when he attains sermonism
 prashn yah he ki anaatmavaadi buddha darshan main agyaan athwa chitt kii nivritti par kya shesh rahata he? nirvana praapt kise hota he? iskaa ek uttar yah he ki sarvam du:kham ko maan lene par nishsheshtha ko hi shreyasi maananaa chahie, yadhyapi isse asantusht hokar vatsiputreey yogachaar sampradaayon main "pudgal" athwa "aalay vigyaan" ke naam se ek aatmavat tatv kii kalpana kii gai
 Nagarjuna says "atmaatyapi Deshitamprajnapitamnatmtyapi"
 buddhairatma na chanatma kashchidityapi deshitam
 "here is an indication of the fact that in ancient Buddhist Agam, self-righteous utterances are not all monogamous
 is uktibhed par sookshmata se vichaar kar kuch aadhunik vidwaanon ne yah mat pratipaadit kiya he ki swayan buddha ne swayan anatm tatwon kaa anaatmatv banaaya tha na ki aatma kaa anstitv
 He did not say that there is any soul
 unhone keval yah kaha ki rup, vigyaan, aadi skandh aatma nahin he
 That is, Buddha's self-abnegation is actually like egoism
 aatmaa kaa skandhon se abhipret abhaav anyonybhav he na ki aatma kaa sarvatra atyantabhaav
 That is why Buddha did not prohibit the soul even when asked explicitly in the Samyutanikayaya, nor did he tell Tathagata's eternal absence of death
 yah smaraneey he ki aatma ke anant or aparichhinn hone ke kaaran unhone uske astitv kaa bhi khyaapan nahin kiya kyonki saadhaaran anubhav main "asti" or "naasti" pad parichhinn gochar main hi sarthak hote hai
 From this point of view, the Buddha's serious intent on the soul and nirvana should be regarded as an irresistible secondary competition beyond the eternal and ablative
 yahi unke arya maun se puri tarah samanjas ho saktaa he
 The fourth Aryasatya or Nirodhagamini antidote is often inseparable from the Arya octagonal route
 ashtangik maarg ke ang hai - samyak drushti, 
sankalp, 
vaak, 
karma, 
aajeev, 
yaayam, 
smriti or 
samadhi
 In fact, this is a special collection of Ashtak Bodhpakshik religions
 praaia: 37 bodhipakshik dharm ullekith hai
 Subsequently, Sheela, Samadhi and Pragya, these three contain spiritual resources
 buddhaghosh ne "visuddhimaggo" main isi kram kaa aashray liya he
 It is worth remembering that the order from which grief arises, is the opposite of the order in which it is automatically ruled out
 du:kha kii karanparampara he avidya: - klesh-karm jisamen uttarottar sthool he
 In the tradition of grieving retirement, karma is first explained by modesty, then tribulation by samadhi or emotion and then disqualification of ignorance through wisdom or interview
 yah avadhey he ki shilabhyas ke purv hi samyagdrushti aavashyak he
 Combination is self-evident, but a guide of means
 sheel or samadhi donon hi sanyam ke rup hai - sthool or sookshm, pehle se karm kaa parishkar hota he, duusare se cleshon kaa tanukaran
 Success in modesty makes samadhi easy, success in samadhi gives perfection to modesty
 samadhi main purnataa hone par samyagdrushti kaa sthaan pragna le leti he
 According to Patisambhidamagg, Sheel is consciousness, Sheel is consciousness, Sheel is beauty, Sheel is immaterial
 upaskon ke liye paanch-sheel updisht hai, anupasanpann shramanero ke liye dashashil vihit he, upasanpann bhikshu ke liye pratmoksha sanvar aadi prajaapt hai
 In Panchsheel, non-violence, astheya, truth, avarichar and madhyanupasevan are stored
 yah smaraneey he ki panchasheel panch viratiyon ke rup main abhihit hai, yatha pranatipaat se virati, adattaadaan se virati ityadi
 a more detailed description of the worshiper religion is available in the Sigalovada Sutta etc
 pravrajya praapt karne par bhikshu shramner kehalaata tha or use ek upaadhyaay evam acharya ke nishray main rahanaa padataa tha
 For him, 10 forms or taboos are stored in piety - from mortal, theft, abstinence, lie, alcohol and intoxicating objects, from food, music, dancing, singing and spectacle, garlands, smells, insults and adornment From, with high beds and precious beds and gold and silver
 pindpaat, chiver, shaynasana, glan pratyay bhejjya bhikshu ke chaar nishray kehalaate hai
 These allow for additional benefits respectively indicating progress in nomadism and the prosperity of the association
 bhikshu jivan or sanghathan ke niyam vinayapitak main sangruhit hai
 Their development is also permissible
 praarambhik avasthaa main bhikshuon ke ekant jivan par atyadhik jor tha
 Residential life flourished behind
 chaaturdish sangh praaia: teen yojan se andhik seemaa ke anek sthaneey sangharaamon main vibhakt tha jinamein ganatantr kii pranali se kaarynirvaah hota tha
 In the assembled monk group, akmatya, vivahika, shalakagrahana, or majority was reached on the decision
 bhikshu uposth ke liye pratipaksh ekatra hote the or us avasar par pratmoksha kaa paath kiya jaataa tha
 There are eight divisions of Pratimoksha - Parajic, Confederacy, Aniyat, Natural Paatyantik, Paatyantik Redirectable, Shiksha and Adhikaran Shamath
 inke antargat niyamon kii sankhya sab sampradaayon main samaan nahin he
 But this numeracy is mainly in the calculation of Shaikya religions
 shesh virgon main sankhya praaia: samaan he or pracheen "diyatthasickhapadasat" ke ullekh se samanjas he
 After each class lesson it was asked three times "are you guys clean of these defects?" Criminal monks used to order their default and proper atonement or punishment was arranged on them
 varshavas ke apane niyam the or unke ananthar pravarna naam kaa parv hota tha
 According to Buddhist tradition, the first association was held in the Rajgriha at the end of Parinirvana, and on this occasion, Vinaya and Dharma were collected
 is sangeeti kii aitihaasikta par itihaaskaaron main prachur vivaad rahaa he kintu is vishay kii khoj kii vartmaan avasthaa ko is sangeeti kii aitihaasikta anukool kahana hoga, tathaapi yah sandigdh rahata he ki is avasar par koun koun se sandarbh sangruhit hue
 The second musical Parinirvan took place after a hundred years in Vaishali, while according to the Mahavansa, the king of Magadha was Kalashoka
 is samay saddharm avanti se vaishali or mathura se kaushambi tak failaa hua tha
 The musical was to decide the 10 things promoted by the monks of Vaishali
 ye 10 vastuen is prakaar thim - shrungi-lavan-kalp, dwi angul-kalp, gramatarkalp, awaas-kalp, anumat-kalp, acheern-kalp, amanthit-kalp, jalogipan-kalp, adashak-kalp, jaatarup-rajat-kalp
 These Kalpas considered the Vajjiputak monks to be canonical and despised the opposition of Ayushmanishya
 isapar yash ke praytn se vaishali main 700 purvi or pashchimi bhikshuon kii sangeeti hui jisamen dason vastuon ko vinayaviruddh tehraaya gaya
 According to Deepavans, the Vajiputakas did not accept this decision and made another "mahasangiti" without static arhants, although it is worth remembering that such a description is not available in any pleas
 kadachit duusari sangeeti ke ananthar kisi samay mahasaanghikon kaa vikaas evam sanghabhed kaa pradurbhaav maananaa chahie
 The emergence of 18 different Buddhist sects is described in the interval from the second Sangita to Ashoka
 in sampradaayon ke aavirbhaav kaa kram sampradayik paramparaon main bhinn bhinn rup se diya gaya he
 According to Deepavans, for example, the first Mahasanadhi was separated
 unase kalantar main ekabboharik or gokulik, gokulikon se panjattivaadee, bahulik or chetivaadee
 On the other hand Mahinasakas and Vajjiputak came out of the Theravada
 vajjiputtakon se dhammuttariy, bhaddayatik, channagarik, evam sanmetiya, tathaa mahinsaskon se dhammaguttik, evam sabbatthivaadee, sabbatthivaadiyon se kassapik, unase sankantik or sankantikon se suttvaadi
 This description is from the point of view of the Theravists
 duusari ore sarvastivaadiyon kii drushti vasumitra ke samachabhedoparchanchakr main sangruhit he
 According to this, the Mahasanadhi divided into three branches
 ekavyaavhaarik, lokottaravaadi evam kaukkulik
 After that, he was born with multi-millionaires and intellectuals, and by the end of the second century of Buddha, Chaityashala, Upshail and Uttarshail branches emerged from him
 duusari ore sthaviravaadi sarvastivaadee athwa hetuvaadi, tathaa mulsthaviravaadi nikaayon main vibhakt hue
 The original stabilizer is called the havat
 peeche sarvastivaadiyon se vatsiputreey, mahishas, kaashyapiya, evam sautraantikon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 In the Vatsiputriyas, religious, bhadrayaniya, samatya, and syllabic bodies were born, and the Dharmagupta emerged from the Mahasikas
 in or anya soochiyon ko dekhne se itnaa nishchit hota hi he ki kuch pramukh naikayik dharaayen duusari buddhabd shatee main prakat huin
 According to the Mahasanadhikas, Buddha and Bodhisattvas are born outright
 buddha kaa swabhaav or sab dharm lokottar hai
 Their Lokvat seeming behavior is just democratization
 unki rupakaay, aayu or prabhaav amit hai
 His body is made of anastrava religions
 ve shaashvat samadhi main sthit rahete hai or unke shabd keval prathit hote hai
 The Mahasanadhik Prakriti Bhasvara considered Chitta to be an uncultured religion
 tripitak ke atirikt unamem sanyukt pitak or dharanipitak bhi vidit the
 It is generally accepted that the Mahasanadhara stream took a special part in the emergence of Mahayana
 mahasaandhikon kaa aagrah ek ore buddha or bodhisattva kii aloukikta par tha, duusari ore arhaton kii parihaaniyata par
 The name of one of his branches was extraterrestrial and his major book "mahavastu" was the well-known Mahasanadhikari, Vatsiputriya, Sarvastivist and Stabilist, these four major bodies
 yuvan chwang ne inke vihaar bamiyaan main paae the or taranath ne unki paal yug main satta suchit kii he
 There was a special development of the generals in Andhra Pradesh
 amravati or nagarjunikond ke abhilekhon main unke "chaityak", "purvastyleey", "aparsaileey" aadi nikaayon ke naam milte hai
 Buddhaghosha has also called these signs of Mahasanghikas "blind" or blind
 vatsiputreeyon kii kai shakhaon ke naam mathura or aparaant ke abhilekhon main uplabdh hote hai
 Yuvan Chwang saw his viharas mainly in the west and the description of Etsig supports this
 inaki sarvaadhik prasiddh shakha sammitiyon kii thi
 The main principle of the Vatsiputriyas was Pudgalism
 unka kahana tha ki pudgal na skandhon se bhinn he na abhinn
 The famous Bharatha Sutra of Agam had special respect in this sect
 kathavstu main sarvapratham pudgalvaad kaa khandan miltaa he or yah vichaarpurvak pratipaadit kiya gaya he ki yah pratham pudgalakatha nihsandeh kathavatthu ke pracheenatam anshon main he
 According to tradition, Kathavatthu was composed by Moggaliputta Tissa on the occasion of the Third Buddhist Association of Ashoka
 sinhalai parampara apane ko mul or pramanik sthaviravaad kii parampara maanati he jise ashok ke prayatnon ne sinhal tak pahunchaakar pratishthit kiya
 According to this tradition, Ashoka in his time organized a musical in Pataliputra in the prominence of Moggaliputta Tiss in which the establishment of Stabilism and other opposing views was disputed, seeing the condition of the Sangh
 sangh se un bhikshuon kaa bhi nishkasana hua jinaki drushti evam sheet ashuddh the
 Thus, with Ashoka's efforts, the Sangh was again purified and integrated
 parampara ke anusaar ashok ne dharmprachaar ke liye naanaa vihaar, evam stupa banawaye
 At the same time, under the leadership of Moggaliputta, the Sangh sent special persons to propagate religion in many directions
 kashmir gandhar ke liye majzantik bheje gaye, mahishamandal ke liye mahadev, vanavaasi ke liye rakkhit, aparaant ke liye yonak dhammarkkhit, maharath ke liye mahadhammarkkhit, yawanon main maharakkhit, himavatpradesh main majjhim, kaashyapagotra, muldev, sahadev or dundubhissar, suvannbhoomi main son or uttar, tamraparni main mahendra, "iththiy", uttiy, sambal or bhaddasaal
 It is noteworthy that the names of "satpurusha Maudgaliputra", Hamvat Dundubhisvara, Satpurusha Madhyam, and "sarvahamavatacharya Kashyapagotra" are available in the inscriptions from the stupas of Sanchi and Sonari, which supports this literary tradition
 duusari ore ashok ke apane abhilekhon main tritiy sangeeti kaa spasht ullekh praapt nahin hota
 It is also not easy to consider the religion of which Ashoka constantly promotes as Buddhism
 ashok kaa dharm apatat: sab dharmon kaa saar hi prathit hota he
 For this reason, the statement received by historians that a local religion of Magadha became a world religion due to the efforts of Ashoka, seems unsuitable
 buddha dharm kaa prasar mulat: swayan sangh ke prayatnon kaa parinaam tha, yadhyapi is prakriya main ekaadhik mahaan shaskaon ne uchit yogadan diya
 Pali Tripitaka Sinhala with King Vattagamani in the first century BC
 Written in parampara ke anusaar mahendra apane saath attakathaayen bhi laae the or ye bhi isi samay likhi gai
 These were available in the Sinhalese language for many centuries and based on them, Buddhaghosa wrote his famous Pali Attakatha
 sthaviravaadi abhidharm or aacharyon ke anusaar satya dharmaatmak he
 Religion is different and different
 prayek apane prativishisht swabhaav ko dhaaran karata he or hetu pratyay se dhaarit hota he
 According to Acharya Aniruddha, Rupa, Chitta, Chaitta and Nirvana are the main types of the four religions
 chaitt dharmon main vednaa, sangya evam sanskaar sangruhit hai
 Thus, this division is only a sophisticated form of ancient Pancha wing and non-cultured
 sanskaar skandh kaa vishesh vistaar kiya gaya
 Unskilled, skilled and un-educated of Chitta, this trinity was the fundamental division
 lobh, dwesh or moh akushal mul hai
 The efficient mind is quadrant - Kamavachar Rupavachar Arupavachar and Lokottara
 avyaakrit chitt dwividh he vipaak or kriya
 There is a total description of 89 types of images in Dhammasani
 patthanppakaran main dharmon kaa kaary-kaaran-bhav kii drushti se abhisambandh aalochit kiya gaya he or 24 prakaar ke pachchayon kaa vivaran diya gaya he
 If this analysis is important from the point of view of epistemology and knowledge, then from the point of view of psychology, the analysis of Vithichitta etc
 reveals a unique seriousness and subtlety
 is prakaar ke vishleshan main chitt kii prakriyaaon kaa niyat avastaakram pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Just as Ashoka and the third musical are important parts of the history of Stabilism, similarly Kanishka and the fourth musical are important in the history of Sarvastivism
 ashok or milind ke tulya hi kanishka kaa naam buddha itihaas main jajvalyamaan he
 The fourth musical was presided over by the Surprise Mahavihara of Purushpur established by Kanishka
 sangeeti kaa sthaan kashmir kaa kundalavan bihar athwa jalandhar kaa kuvan bataaya gaya he
 In this music, 500 arhats with lateral faces and 500 bodhisattvas with vasumitra are said to be part
 kintu bodhisatvon kaa is prasang main ullekh adhik vishwasya nahin prathit hota
 Against the third music, this association states the acceptance of the authenticity of all the Ashtadash bodies
 sangeeti kaa sabase mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary "abhidharm maha vibhaasha" kii rachana thi
 Two distinctions of Sarvastivists are famous - Vaibhashika and Sautrantika
 vibhaasha ke anuyaayi vaibhashik kehalaate the
 Dharmatrat, Ghokshaka, Vasumitra and Buddhadev were called Vaibhashikas
 inamen ghoshak tusharajaateey the
 It is mentioned that Vaibhashik whose center was in Gandhar
 sarvastvaad kaa manthan kar acharya vasubandhu ne apana jagatprasiddh "abhidharmkosh" rachaa
 The period determination of Vasubandhu has been the subject of much controversy
 do vasubandhuon kii satta ko ab siddh maananaa chahie kintu yah siddh nahin he ki inamen ek mahayani acharya vijyaptimaatraasiddhi kaa rachayita tha or doosraa kosh kaa
 It seems valid to place the main Vasubandhu in the fifth century
 sarvastivaadiyon kaa mukhya siddhant tha "sarvamasti"
 According to the Vaibhashikas, it meant the acceptance of the triennial power of all religions
 arthath ateet or anaagat dharmon ke astitv kaa abhyupagam
 Emergency: This vote is similar to the theory of consequentialism and fluidity of statistics
 kintu vaibhashik sanskrit lakshanon ke sweekaar se shaashvat prasang kaa nivaaran karte the
 There are four Sanskrit features - product, condition, expenditure, and prevention or imperfection
 ya apatat: viruddh hone par bhi vastut: sahakaari hai
 a number of opinions were introduced to establish the distinction between the triadvikvya dravya satta, in which Vasubandhu has called Shobhan of Vasumitra's infertility
 vaibhashikon ke viruddh sautraatikon kaa kahana tha ki "sarv" shabd se "dwadashaytan" samajhnaa chahie
 Vaibhashik Sanskrit religions counted rupas, chitta, chitta and chittaviprayukta rites
 inke atirikt ve teen asanskrit dharm sweekaar karte the, akaash, pratisankhyanirodh, apratisankhyanirodh
 By analyzing the work-cause-expressions of all these religions, four suffixes, six for and five fruits were determined
 yashomitra ne sautraantikon ke namarth par kaha he "ye sutarapramanika na tu shastrapramanikaste sautraantika:
 "yuvan-chwang has described Kumarabhland as the originator of the Sautrantik sect
 kumaralabdh takshashilavasi the or ashwaghosh, nagarjun evam aryadev ke samakaleen prasiddh hai
 a subtle review of Sautrantikas proved to be very helpful in the development of Indian philosophy
 vaibhashikon ke dwaara sweekrut panchdharmon main sautrantik asanskrit ko niropamaatr evam chittaviprayukt ko prajeeptimaatr maanate the
 The form is permissible by their opinion
 is prakaar chitt or chaitt hi nishchit or pramukh tatv ho jate hai
 He considered the power of a subtle and monotonous psychology
 is prakaar sautraantikon ke siddhanton ne vigyaanavaad evam buddha nyaay, donon kaa hi maarg prashast kiya
 Hinayana and Mahayana, their naming and distinction are thus the imagination of Mahayana
 hinayan ko shravakyaan bhi kaha gaya he, mahayan ko ekayaan agryan, bodhisattvayan evam buddhayan bhi
 Yaanbhed has originated in Mahayasutras and elaborated in Mahayana-scriptures
 nagarjun ke anusaar buddha ne apni vaastavik deshna adhikari bodhisatvon ko di thi, unki prakat deshna nune adhikariyon ke liye arhadvishyak thi
 Thus the basis of discrimination was right discrimination and goal discrimination
 mahayan ke siddhant-paksh main buddhatv, shoonyata evam chittamaatrata pradhan hai, saadhan paksh main bodhisattvacharya jisamen parmitaayen or bhumiyaan mahatvapurn hai
 Hinayani's goal is only to attain qualification for herself
 mahayani kaa lakshya sab praaniyon ke uddhaar ke liye buddhatv kii prapti he
 This is the aiming importance of Mahayana and the ability of its favorable provision is the highest authority of Mahayana
 pudgalashoonyata ke bodh se kleshawaran kaa kshay ho jaataa he or is prakaar arhatv praapt hota he
 But omission of wisdom from this instrument does not lead to omniscience or enlightenment
 buddhatv ke liye sarvapratham ashesh praaniyon ke kalyaan ke liye bodhiprapti kaa sankalp aavashyak he
 The means of permeation are done in the different lands of this Bodhichitta providence
 ant main dharmashoonyata ke bodh se buddhatv kii prapti hoti he
 There are three main stages of the Bodhisattva in Mahayana, the first of which is the dual nature, the Gotrambhoomi and the Adhimuktikarya
 gotra vastav main ek prakaar kaa swabhaav evam aadhyatmik pravriti he jiskaa purvakarm ke prabhaav se nirmaan hota he
 This is also the root of "authority"
 duusari avasthaa bodhisattva bhoomiyon kii he 
 Due to the origin of Mahayana, there is no consensus about historical order and country period
 mahayaniyon ne apni drushti kii pramanikta evam mul sanlagnta ke paksh main anek yuktiyaan di hai
 He says that the characteristic of the real Buddha Deshna, which is available in humility and sutra and is opposed to righteousness, is in Mahayana itself
 yahan ve "vinay" or "sutara" se mahayanik aagam ko hi lete the
 Opponents of this view - and these include most modern historians - do not consider Mahayanic proceeds to be Buddhist because their achievement occurs much later than the Buddha era
 kintu sookshm pariksha se yah dikhalaayaa ja saktaa he ki kuch pradhan mahayanik siddhant beej rup se pracheen aagmon main bhi sanketit hai
 And then in understanding the meaning of the Buddha-text, religion cannot be neglected and must say in favor of Mahayana that it has revealed its essential origin by showing Buddha's own life and resources as ideal for all
 saidhantik vistaar or abhidhaan kii drushti se vastav main buddha deshna ko purnat: "hinayan" athwa "mahayan" kah sakna kathin he
 Of course, "hinayana" developed first, but some of its ancient sects had such principles and tendencies which gradually developed and resulted in Mahayana
 inamen mahasaanghik or sarvastivaadee sampradaay ullekhya hai
 The famous utterance of Ashtasahastrika concerning the place of origin of Mahayana points to the Andhra center of the Mahasanghikas
 i
 shatabdi ke madhya tak pragnaparmita kaa chini anuwaad, evam praaia: us samay tak usapar nagarjun kaa vishaal pragnaparmitashastra nibaddh ho chuke the
 This spread and so much classical development to the Far East probably originated in Mahayana
 Informs in the first century
 mahayan-sutara-raashi kitni vishaal he iskaa anumaan isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki mahavyutpatti main 105 sutron ke naam die gaye hai, shikshasmucchy main praaia: 100 sutaragranthon se uddhran praapt hote hai, najiyon ke chini tripitak main saat virgon main vibhakt 541 mahayanasutron kaa ullekh he
 Most of the Mahayana literature is lost in its original form, however modern discovery has published many important sources
 isamen ashtsahastrika pragnaparmita, saddharmpundaric, lalitvistar, lankavatar, suvarnaprabhas, gandavyuuh, samadhiraj, sukhavativyuh, carrandavyuuh, aadi vishesh rup se ullekhya hai
 The Ashtasahastrika is probably the oldest among them and represents Mahayana emptiness
 saddharmpundaric main buddha kaa aishwarya, upaykaushal se yaan-bhed evam buddha-bhakthi kaa pratipaadan miltaa he
 Lankavatar is particularly important from the point of view of yoga
 mahayan kaa shastreey rup evam prachaar sarvaadhik rini acharya nagarjun kaa he
 There are many historical disputes about him, but it is certain that he was a Dakshinatya and a contemporary of a famous king who was probably from the second century AD
 unke anek prasiddh granthon main madhyamik karikas murdhanya hai
 In this, emptiness is said to be integral to Pratyasamutpad and Madhyam Pratistha
 dharmon kii paratantraa or paraapekshata hi unki nisswabhavata kaa dyotan karti he
 It is inherently neither weight nor form
 shoonyavad parmarth kii nirviklpata or anirvachaneeyata suchit karata he
 This vote can be established only by prohibition of one vote
 nagarjun iskaa vistaarsh: pratipaadan karte hai ki kisi bhi vastu kii satyata sweekaar karne par aprihaary rup se virodh prasakt hota he
 This logic system is called contextualization or contextualization
 nagarjun ke ananthar shoonyavad ke pramukh pratipaadakon main aryadev, bhavvivek, buddhapalit evam chandrakirti ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Yoga and scientificism are often considered synonymous
 yah kahana adhik sahi hoga ki mahayan sutron main evam maitreyanath evam asang kii kritiyon main yogachaar ek aadhyatmik darshan ke rup main prakat hota he
 In the philosophical representations of Vasubandhu and the later Acharyas, it should be considered as a proper subject of the faith of Scientism
 yogachaar ke mul sutron main sandhinirmonchan, lankavatar evam ghanvyuuh ullekhya hai
 Among them, the world has been considered as the master in the dream science stream
 inamen pehle saat pravritivigyaan he jinka aalayavigyaan se tarang or sagar sa sambandh he kyonki aalay main pravriti ke beej evam sanskaar sannihit rahete hai
 Maitreyanath is now accepted as a historical legend
 taranath or budon ke anusaar asang ne maitrey se paanch shaastra praapt kiye - abhismayalankar, sutralankar, madhyantvibhang, dharmadharmatavibhang evam mahayanottaratantr
 In the first two of these famous texts, there is a detailed description of the method and stages of yoga in the form of the Bodhisattvacharya
 asang purushpur ke ek brahman parivaar main utpann hue the or vasubandhu ke agraj the
 The most famous of his texts is Yogacharabhumishastra kaha jaataa he ki asang ke prayatnon se vasubandhu ne mahayan sweekaar kiya
 Vasubandhu's time is fixed only in the fifth century by the calculation of Parmarth and Yuwan Chung and being a contemporary of Vikramaditya and Baladitya
 vasubandhu ne vigyaanavaad ko shuddh tarkbhumi main upanit kiya
 Dinnag further elaborated this judgmentalism and gave order to Buddhist justice
 nyaayadarshan ke aacharyon se shastrarth ke prasang main buddha nyaay kii apurv pragati hui tathaa vah dharmakirti kii kritiyon main apane sarvocch shikhar ko praapt hua
 Dharmakirti has been called the "indian thorn"
 jahaan ek ore buddha nyaay evam nyaayanusaari darshan kaa vikaas ho rahaa tha, vahaan duusari ore baudhon main tantra shaastra kii pragati bhi nishchit prakaash main ai
 According to Buddhist Tantric tradition, Tathagata introduced the third Dharma Chakra for Vajrayana at Dhanyakataka
 dhanykatak ke ullekh se suchit hota he ki bajrayaan kaa mul bhi mahasaandhikon main hi khojna chahie
 In this context, their form and metaphorical opinion, the acceptance of Dharanipitaka, and the acceptance of the Mithrascharya signified by the Vetalakas are characteristic
 asang kii kritiyon main paraavriti evam abhisandhi ke siddhant spashtat: tantric prathit hote hai
 The earliest available system is Manjushrimalakalpa and Guhyasamaj
 taranath ke anusaar 300 varsh tak gupt rahakar tantric parampara prakaash main ai or dharmakirti ke pashchaat, vishesh rup se paal yug main, uskaa adhikadhik prachaar hua
 According to the Adyavajra, Mahayana has two principalities - Paramitanya and Mantrayaya
 inamen mantranay kii vyakhya yogachaar or madhyamik sthiti se hoti he
 Mantralaya is the soul of Buddhist Tantra or Vajrayana
 vajrayan main pragna evam upaay kii yuganddh satta ko hi parmarth maanate hai
 These wisdom and measures are also called Vajra and Padma
 prakarantar se yahi tathagat kaa swaroop he or kaary vaakchitt vajradhar kaha gaya he jinase panchaskandhon ke adhishthata paanch "dhyani" buddha nissruth hote hai
 Together with these Buddhas, their "powers" and Bodhisattvas combine to form "clans" whose arrangement creates a "tathagata mandala"
 bodhichitt ke utpaadan ke ananthar mandal main advaitabhaavna se shakti sahcharit upasna hi tantric upasna he
 The accounts of Fahian, Sung Yun, Yuwan-chwang, Etshing Whee-chu and I-kung have reported a gradual decline of Buddhism in Central Asia and India, corroborated by other literary and archaeological evidence
 saksheeya he ki anek buddha sutron main saddharm kii avadhi 500 athwa 1000 athwa 1500 varsh bataai gai he
 The decline in Kapilvastu Shravasti, Gaya and Vaishali was the goal in the Gupta era itself
 gandhar or uddian main hunon ke kaaran saddharm kii kshati hui prathit hoti he
 Yuwan Chwang saw Buddhism endangered in the eastern southpaw
 i-tsing ne apane samay main keval chaar sampradaayon ko bharat main prachaarit paaya-mahasaanghik, sthavir, mulsarvastivaadee evam sammatiya
 Hinayani and Mahamani were mixed in the viharas
 sindh main buddha dharm arab shashan ke yug main kramash: ksheen or lupt hua
 The eighth century of Buddhism is known in Gandhara and Udayan by the influence of Vajrayana and Mantrayana, but by the time of Alberuni, that light was lost by Turkish influence
 kashmir main uskaa lop vahaan bhi islam ke prabhutv kii sthapana se hi maananaa chahie
 The omission of Buddhism in western and central India appears to be due to state neglect and spread of Brahmin and Jain religions
 madhyapradesh main guptkaal se hi kramik hraas dekha ja saktaa he jiskaa kaaran rajkeey poshan kaa abhaav hi prathit hota he
 In Magadha and East Country, Buddhism and its education centers Nalanda, Vikramashila, Odantpuri reached the pinnacle of their fame under the umbrella of Param Saugat Pal Naresh
 is pradesh main saddharm kaa hraas turki vijay ke kaaran hua
 It is clear that the main reason for the decline of Buddhism was its inability to make itself an essential part of cosmic social life
 is kaaran aisa prathit hota he ki rajkeey upeksha athwa virodh se viharon ke sankatagrast hone par upaskon main saddharm anayas lupt hone lagata tha
 It is worth remembering that according to Udayanacharya, there was no such sect that even by saying Samvatra one does not accept the ritual of Vedic actions
 upaskon ke liye buddha dharm keval sheel athwa aisi bhakthi ke rup main tha jise brahman dharm se mulat: pruthak kar sakna janata ke liye utana hi kathin tha jitna shoonyata evam nairatmya ke siddhanton ko samaj sakna
 Perhaps the religion of modesty, wisdom and samadhi should be more suitable for the present-day ritualists and intellectuals than before
