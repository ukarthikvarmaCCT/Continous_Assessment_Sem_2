 asthisushirta yaa osteoporosis haddi kaa ek rog he jisase fracture kaa khatara bad jaataa he
 In osteoporosis, bone mineral density is reduced, bone micro-structures are disintegrated, and the amount and variety of non-stored proteins in bone is altered
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne mahilaon main osteoporosis ko DXA ke maapan anusaar adhiktam asthi pind se neeche asthi khanij ghanatv 2
5 maanak vichlan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he; shabd "osteoporosis kii sthapana" main najuk fracture kii upasthiti bhi shaamil he
 Osteoporosis is most common in post-menopausal women, when it is called post-menopausal osteoporosis, but it can also develop in men and can be caused by specific hormonal disorders and other chronic illnesses in anyone or drugs, especially glucocorticoids
 Can result when the disease is steroid or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporos Number called

 Exercises to stretch walking muscles, tissue-sensory-correction exercises, in fall prevention advice; Balance therapy may be included
 vyaayaam, apane upachayi prabhaav ke saath, osteoporosis ko usee samay band yaa ulat saktaa he
 In all cases of osteoporosis, the underlying system is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation

 asthishoshak koshikaon dwaara asthi kaa avasorana hota he, jiske baad nai asthi asthikorak koshikaon dwaara jamaa kii jaati he
 The three major mechanisms by which bone weakness develops are insufficient head bone mass, excessive bone absorption, and insufficient formation of new bone during regeneration
 At the core of delicate bone tissue development is the interaction of these three mechanisms
 Hormonal factors specifically determine the rate of bone absorption; Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption and, at the same time, reduces the deposition of new bone, usually in weight-bearing bones
 is prakriya ko dabaane ke liye apekshit estrogen kii maatra, aam taur par garbhashay or stan granthi ko uttejit karne ke liye apekshit maatra se kam he
 The estrogen receptor of the α-form seems to be very important in the regulation of bone manipulation

 RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors
 Wnt sanketan maarg kii bhoomika ko sweekruti mili he, par acchhee tarah se kam samajha gaya he
 Local production of eicosanoids and interleukin is thought to be involved in controlling bone manipulation and may be the over or under-production factor of these mediators at the core of the development of osteoporosis
 bandhakmay asthi, lambii asthiyon or kasheruk ke chor par sthit spanjanuma asthi he
 The vulvascular bone is the rigid outer shell of the bones and the middle of the long bones
 kyonki asthikorak or asthishoshak, haddiyon kii sataha par nivas karte hai, bandhakmay asthi zyaada sakriy he or asthi ke her-pher or punarpratirupan ke adheen he
 Not only is bone density low, but bone micro-structures are disrupted
 bandhakmay asthi kamazor conticaayen bhang ho jaati hai or kamazor haddiyon se pratisthapit hoti hai
 Common osteoporotic fracture sites, such as the wrist, hip and spinal cord, have a relatively high ratio of vulvar bone to ligamentous bone

 Osteoporosis has no specific symptoms of its own; The main consequence of this is the increased risk of fractures
 osteoporotic fracture un sthitiyon main hote hai, jahaan aam taur par swasth logon kii haddi nahin tuutati he; atah unhen najuk asthi-bhang mana jaataa hai
 Typical delicate fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip, and wrist

 dawa kaa prayog saidhantik rup se parivartaneey he, haalanki kai maamalon main osteoporosis ke jokhim ko badhaane vaali dawaaon kaa upyog aprihaary he
 The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age and female gender; Estrogen deficiency after menopause correlates with a rapid decrease in bone mineral density, whereas a decrease in testosterone levels in men has a comparable effect
 haalanki osteoporosis sabhi jaateey samoohon ke logon main paaya jaataa he, europea yaa asian mul ke log osteoporosis ke prati pehle se hi pravrutt hai
 People who have a family history of fractures or osteoporosis are at greater risk; The heritability of fractures and low bone mineral density is relatively high, with an expansion ranging from 25 to 80 percent
 osteoporosis ke vikaas se jude kam se kam 30 jin maujuud hai
 People who have already had a fracture are twice as likely to have a fracture again than someone who is same or gay

 Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi sarvaadhik prachlit vidhi he
 In addition to detecting abnormal BMD, a diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigation into potentially variable underlying causes; This can be done with blood tests and X-rays

 In 2002, the US Prevention Services Task Force recommended that all women 65 years of age or older should be tested by densityimeter
 The task force recommends testing only women aged between 60 and 64, who are at greater risk

 Many drugs are used to treat osteoporosis on the basis of gender
 jivan-style main parivartan bhi upachaar kaa ek pahalu he
 Bisphosphonate is the main medicinal remedy for treatment
 baharhaal, 1990 ke dashak main terriparatide or stronsium rinlate jaisi nai dawaaen prakat huin
 In the case of confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate drugs have been the first in the treatment-preference order of women

 a 2007 manufacturer-supported study reported that in patients with low-impact hip fractures, the annual transfusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid increased the risk of any fracture by 35%, the risk of vertebral fracture from 3
8% to 1
7%
 And reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures from 10

 Oral bisphosphonates are relatively poorly absorbed and therefore should be taken on an empty stomach, where no food or drink is taken for the next 30 minutes
 It is associated with inflammation of the esophagus and is therefore sometimes tolerated; a weekly or monthly dose reduces the likelihood of esophagitis and is now standardized
 haalanki zolandronet jaise antahshira nuskhon ke saath aantrayik khuraaq maukhik sahishnutaa kii samasyaon kaa parihaar hota he, lekin ye kaarak jabade kaa asthigalan naamak ek durlabh lekin apriy mukh-rog main pradhan rup se antargrast hai
 For this reason, oral bisphosphonate therapy should probably be preferred and now doctors recommend that any curative dental work be done before treatment
 haal hi main, terriparatide ko osteoporosis ke prati prabhavi hona paaya gaya he
 It acts as a parathyroid hormone and stimulates osteoblasts and thus increases their activity
 yah zyaadaatar haddiyon kii kamazori se pusht rogiyon ke liye, visheshtah kam BMD yaa kai fracture ke jokhim kaarak vaale yaa jo maukhik biophasphonet bardaasht nahin kar sakate, istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is given as a daily injection with the use of an injection device such as a pen
 kuch deshon main, terriparatide ko upachaar ke liye tabhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, yadi biophasphonet asafal ho jate hai yaa nishiddh hai
 Patients or young patients with prior radiation therapy or Paget's disease should avoid this medicine
 maukhik stronsium rinlate ek vaikalpik maukhik ilaaj he, jo dawaaon ke ek aise varg se sambandhit he, jise uske nirmaataa ne 'dohari karrwai haddi agent" naam diya he
 It has proved its ability in the prevention of vertebral fractures in particular
 prayogshaala prayogon main note kiya gaya ki stronsium rinlate asthikorkon ke prasar ko badhaava, saath hi asthibhanjakon ke prasar ko pratibandhit karata he
 Strontium renalate is taken as an oral suspension of 2g daily and is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis to prevent vertebral and hip fractures
 bisphosphonet kii tulana main stronsium rinlate ko anushanbee prabhaav laabh hasil he, kyonki yah kisi tarah kaa upree GI anushanbee prabhaav nahin paidaa karata, jo ki haddiyon kii kamajori main dawa hataa liye jane kaa sabase aam kaaran he
 Studies have noted a slight increase in the risk of venous thrombosis, the cause of which has not been determined
 isse pataa chalata he ki yah alag kaarnon se ghanaastrata ke jokhim se grast rogiyon main kam upyukt ho saktaa he
 The leaching of strontium in place of calcium in the bone matrix indicates a substantial and mismatched increase in bone mineral density measured at DXA, making it difficult to interpret the addition of bone density by this method for patients treated with strontium
 ek sudhaar elgoritham taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Although strontium renalate is effective, its use has not yet been approved in the United States
 tathaapi, america main kai nami vitamin nirmaataaon se stronsium citrate uplabdh he
 Most researchers believe that strontium, regardless of its use, is safe and effective
 rinlate prakaar france ke sarvier company dwaara avishkrut keval ek saadhan he, taaki ve stronsium ke apane sanskaran ko patent kar saken
 Strontium, whatever its form, must be soluble in water and ionized in abdominal acid
 Strontium is then protein-bound to be carried by the intestinal tract into the bloodstream
 sodium alendronet jaisi aushadhiyon ke vipareet, stronsium asthi punahchaalan ko baadhit nahin karata or, vastav main, majboot haddiyon kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Studies have shown that alendronate may also be a factor of bone loss after five years, while strontium continues to form bone from application during life
 stronsium ko aahaar yaa calcium yukt vyanjanon ke saath nahin lenaa chahie, kyonki udagrahan ke dauraan calcium kii pratispardhaa stronsium ke saath hoti he
 Nevertheless, it is important to take calcium, magnesium, and vitamin d in therapeutic amounts daily, but not while taking strontium
 Strongium should be taken empty stomach at night
 osteoporosis kii rokthaam ke liye estrogen pratisthaapan upachaar ek acha ilaaj he, lekin is samay, jab tak ki uske istemaal ke liye anya sanket uplabdh naa hon, uski sifaarish nahin kii jaati he
 There is uncertainty and controversy regarding the recommendation of estrogen in the first decade after menopause in women

 SERM is a class of drugs that act in a selective manner on estrogen receptors throughout the body
 aam taur par, asthi khanij ghanatv ko tribikular asthi main asthikorak or asthishoshak gatividhi ke bich ek santulan dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Estrogen has a major role in the regulation of bone formation – absorption balance, as it promotes osteoblast activity
 reloxyphine jaise kuch SERM, asthishoshkon dwaara haddi avasorana ko dhimaa karte hue asthiyon par prabhaav daalate hai
 SERM has been shown to be effective in clinical trials
 asthi vikaas, asthi rog-nidaan or asthi kii shakti banaae rakhane ke liye calcium kii aavashyaktaa he or yah haddiyon kii kamazori ke ilaaj kaa ek pahalu he
 Calcium recommendations in food vary by country and age; For those who are at greater risk of osteoporosis, the recommended dose by US health agencies is 1200 mg per day
 aahaar kaa seven badhaane ke liye calcium poorak istemaal kiye ja sakate hai or puure din kai choti kuraaken lene ke madhyam se avasorana anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 The role of calcium in preventing and treating osteoporosis is unclear - some populations with very low calcium levels also have extremely low bone fracture rates and bone mass in others with high rates of calcium ingested through milk and milk products - The rate of dissolution is high
 osteoporosis ke vikaas main kai anya karkon ke bich khaane main calcium ko ek kaarak banaate hue, protein, namak or vitamin d kaa seven, vyaayaam or surya ke prakaash se sampark jaise anya sabhi kaarak, asthi khanij ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 In 2007, a WHO report stated that eating calcium along with acidic adulteration with diet affected bone weakness
 
 a mid-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving calcium and calcium and vitamin d supported the use of high levels of calcium and vitamin D, although the results varied depending on the criteria used to assess bone health
 a mid-analysis with another study supported significantly better outcomes for patients with best adherence to the treatment protocol
 iske vipareet, calcium purakon main unnat ucch lepoprotein kii saghanta kii pichhali report ke baavjood, kii dar main sambhavit vruddhi pai gai
 If confirmed, this indicates that calcium supplementation in women at low risk of fracture may cause more harm than good

 On average, it is much less dense than the Earth - because stones and other heavy materials are in greater percentage on Earth, while Arun has more gas
 isiilie prithvi se tiresth guna bada akar rakhane ke baad bhi yah prithvi se keval saadhe chaudaa guna baari he
 Although Arun can also be seen with the eye without binoculars, it is so far away and appears to have such a medium of illumination that the ancient scholars never gave it the status of a planet and considered it a distant flickering star

 In 1845, Urbann Le Verrier began his independent research on the orbit of Uranus
 On 23 September 1846 Johann Gottfried Galle discovered a new planet, later renamed Neptune, close to the position predicted by Le Verriere

 Yet Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles
 iske liye uttaradaayi antarnihit tantra agyaat he
 The reason for Uranus' unusual axle tilt is also not known with certainty, but as usual speculation is that during the solar system formation, an Earth-sized tributary collided with Uranus and caused this asymmetric orientation
 At the time of Voyager 2's passing in 1986, the south pole of Uranus was almost directly towards the Sun
 grah ke ghurnan kii disha ke maujuud hone ke baavjood, "dakshin" ke rup main pahchaan ke liye iskaa dhruv haal ke antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh dwaara samarthit paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he

 The standard model of the Uranus structure is that the planet is composed of three layers: a rocky core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and an outer gaseous rind
 The core is relatively small with an Earth mass of 0
55 and a radius less than the 20% radius of Uranus, the mantle incorporates a large amount of planets with 13
4 Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere is comparatively unrealistic with a weight of 0
5 Earth mass
 And extend at a 20% radius of the last edge of Uranus

 is taral padaarth ke paas ek ucch vidyut chaalakata he, jise kabhi kabhi ek taral-ammonia sagar kehalaata he
 Most structures of Uranus and Neptune are very different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with gases dominating ice, so their distinct classification as ice demons is upheld

 For example, convection can take place in a group of structurally dissimilar layers, which can impede upward heat transport, making it possible that dual diffusive convection may be a limiting factor

 Voyager's observations showed that Uranus' magnetic field is distinct for two reasons, one because it does not originate from the geometric center of the planet and another because it is tilted at 59 ° from the rotational axis
 vastav main yah chumbakeey dwidhruv grah ke centre se dakshin ghurni dhruv kii ore grahiy vyas ke adhiktam ek tihaai jitna khisak gaya he

 Look So Pao or Wiziwig Computation refers to any system in which editors and producers look at the screen while creating, exactly what the reading or viewers see later on the screen or printed
 "dekho so paao" software bananaa aksar mushkil hota he, lekin agar yah uplapdh ho to computaron par saamagree banane vaale apana kaam adhik gati se or kam galatiyon ke saath kar pate hai
 For example, a word processor named wordstar was very popular in the first half of the 1980s
 isamen agar likhaai ke kisi hisse ko gadha kara jaataa to screen par vah likhi halaki likhaai se abhinn lagati thi
 Only the symbol of "^ B" used to come before the thick letter
 yah sirf chhapane par pataa lagata tha kii likhi ke rangarup main galatiyaan hui hai ke nahin
 Microsoft Word, by contrast, is based on a "look at sleep" system
 agar kisi likhi ko gadha kiya jaataa he to vah lekhak ko bhi screen par gadha hi nazar aayega
 Where wordstar had a common writer's mistakes in the look and feel of printing and correcting them over and over again, this is not a complete mess in Microsoft Word
 jo screen par dikhataa he, lekh ko baad main padhane vaale ko vaisaa hi dikhegaa or chhapane par thik vaisaa hi chhapega
 "look So Pao" is called "what you see is what you got" in English, which is short for "wysiwyg" pronounced wiziwig

 It is believed that many of the modern-day Tajik, Pashtun and Yagnobi people are descendants of these Sogdai people

 The people of Sogda were considered freedom-loving and militant and their nation was situated between the Hakhamani kingdom of Iran and the Shakas

 Scientific terminology was derived from Greek
 15veen shatee se hi jo khojein aarambh hui unke madhyam se portugaliyon kaa sampark africa, asia or america ke nivaasiyon se hua
 As a result, many new words were introduced in Portuguese
 laathini kii tulana main portugali kii mukhya visheshtaayen nimna hai : The syntactic phonology in Portuguese is worth noting: the pronunciation of 'S' in the syllable is often the same as the 'sh' of 'ship', but when followed by more words, it is pronounced as Z, as in as
 Z; Being pronounced in the east of the vowel and preceding the Ghosh Varna, its pronunciation is similar to the Pleasure K, but beyond the Aghosha Varna remains S
 'OS Pis' kaa uccharan 'us pass' hota he - kyonki pa adhosh he, 'as artes' kaa uccharan 'az arthess' hota he kyonki 'artes' ke prarambh main swar he
 'OS dentes' is pronounced 'oz dentes' because 'the' is Ghosh
 navalathini anya bhashaaon kii saamaanya visheshtaon ke atirikt portugali main ek visheshta milti he jo anya kisi bhashaa main nahin milti
 In addition to the original nonverbal verb form, another descriptive or syntactic verb form is found in Portuguese, which is often associated with a certain phrase
 'i una vergonha noo sabermoe escrever' - yah lajja kii baat he ki ham likh nahin sakate
 In nematic verbs there is also a future form which is similar to the common form of a proper verb

 The name of the city was changed to "lutyens Delhi", inaugurated on 10 February 1931 by the then Governor of India, Lord Irwin
 Edwin Lutyens considered British imperialism as the base and created the central administrative areas of the city
 jald hi lutiuns ne anya sthanon ke nirmaanon par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the construction of Delhi, George Swinton as chairman and John A

 Bangladesh's freedom struggle took place in 1971, it is also called 'freedom struggle' 
 yah yuddh varsh 1971 main 25 march se 16 disambar tak chalaa tha
 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan through this bloody war
 16 disambar san 1971 ko bangladesh bana tha
 This historic victory of India over Pakistan is celebrated as Victory Day

 India forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to kneel
 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted

 As a result, there was a direct war between India and Pakistan

 With this, a new country emerged in South Asia

 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii
 His party also won a majority in Parliament but instead of making him Prime Minister, he was put in jail

 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee

 Before becoming Bangladesh, the Pakistani military in East Pakistan violated human rights with the help of local leaders and religious extremists
 25 march 1971 ko shuru hue oparation search lite se lekar puure bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan purvi pakistan main jamkar hinsa hui

 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date
