 The minimum estimates are typically based on the number of estimates where there is evidence that the weapons were hit by at least one missile, but the manner in which the al-hussein missiles broke down in flight, often making it difficult to tell Which pieces are weapons and there were some radar tracks that could actually be stored that could be analyzed later

 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium

 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system

 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke sansthaanon kii dhire-dhire bad rahi he bhartiyakaran ke chehre main, adhinium upyog ke liye nirnay or british niyukt vysarai ke haathon main suraksha upayon kii vaastavik prashasan or prantiy governron jo bharat ke liye rajya sachiv ke niyantran ke adheen tha
 'the vast powers and responsibilities that the Governor General must discipline according to his discretion or his personal decision, it is clear that he is expected to be like Superman
 uske paas vinamrata, saahas or kadi mehnat ke liye ek anant kshamta ke saath sampann hona chahie "hamane is bill main kai suraksha upayon ko daalaa he" sar robert horn ne kaha 


 "lekin ve saare suraksha upaay ek hi vyakti ke bare main vichaar karti he or vah he visarai he
 He is the lynch-pin of the entire system
 


 agar vysarai vifal hota he, kuch bhi aapke sthapit pranali ko bachaa nahin saktaa
 "this speech reflects the vision of the staunch Torridge who was frightened one day by the possibility of the Viceroy being appointed by the Labor Government
 adhinium ko thik se padhane se se pataa chalata he ki british sarkaar ne ise apane liye taiyaar kiya he, jab bhi unhen mahasoos hoga tab ve kisi bhi samay kanoonee upkaran ke saath is par puraa niyantran le sakate the
 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government 


 has presented a glimpse of responsible government
 lekin vaastaviktaa kaa abhaav he, maamle ke anusaar raksha or videshi maamalon main jaruri shaktiyon kii kami he, rajyapal general ko aavashyak taur mantri gatividhi ke liye seemaa pradaan kii gai he or bhartiya rajyon ke pratinidhitiv ke upaay ko nakaaratmak pradaan kiya gaya he or yahaan tak ki loktantric niyantran kii shuruyaat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level
 i am on a climax

 If you look at this constitution, it would seem that all the powers are vested in the Governor General and the Governor
 lekin yahaan puri shakti raja main nihit nahin he? raja ke naam par sab kuch kiya jaataa he, lekin kya raja usamen kabhi hastkshep karata he? ek baar satta vidhayika ke haathon main aa jaati he, rajyapal yaa governor general kabhi hastkshep nahin karte hai

 It requires a fairly elaborate provision for the Viceroy to intervene if, in his appeal-disqualified view, any Indian law or act demands, or indeed, discrimination against, British subjects resident in Britain, British registered companies and, in particular, British Shipping interests

 sapru ne kaha ki unhen adhinium ko teji se lagu karnaa chahie or sangheey yojana usamen sannihit he
 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect
 linlithgo kaaphi budhimaan, behad mehnatee, eemaandaar, gambhir or is adhinium ko safal banane ke liye drudh sankalp tha, haalanki vah bhi niras, aavegahin, vidhi sammat tha or apane tatkaal cirkil ke baahar logon ke saath "sharton ko lagu karnaa" bahut mushkil mahasoos kiya

 In the US, Canada and the UK, it has been raised against the construction of nuclear power stations, airports, garbage collection centers and captives
 "nimbi" kaa puraa rup he "note in maae bakeyard" yani "mere ghar ke peeche nahin"
 For example, if there is a proposal to set up a garbage collection center near any locality that is expected to stink in that locality, then the residents of that locality can picket against the mark
 aise nishaanon ko "nimbi" kii shrenee kaa nishaan kaha jaataa he or yah netaaon ko sanket hota he ke "agar itnaa hi badhiya vikaskaarya he to apane ghar ke paas banaao, hamaare mohalle main nahin"
 Semiconductors are those materials whose electrical conductivity is less than conductors but greater than conductors
 silicon, jarmenium, cadmium sulphide, gallium arsenid ityadi ardhchaalak padaarthon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 In semiconductors, there is a 'band gap' between the conduction band and the valence band, which varies from 0 to 6 electron-volts
 
 Most semiconductors used to make electronic devices are elements of group IV of the periodic table, compounds of groups III and V, antimonide), or compounds of groups II and VI
 ardhchaalak padaarth ekal crystal ke rup main ho sakate hai yaa bahucristali powder ke rup main ho sakate hai
 At present, organic semiconductors have also been made, which are often multicomponent aromatic compounds
 aadhunik yug main prayukt tarah-tarah kii yuktiyon ke mul main ye ardhchaalak padaarth hi hai
 They were first made with diodes and then transistors
 isi kaa haath pakadakar electranik yug kii yatra shuru hui
 He has played a huge role in electrical and electronics
 vigyaan kii jis shakha main ardhchalkon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use thos avasthaa bhautikee kehete hai
 The electrical conductivity of semiconductors increases with increasing temperature, which is the opposite of conductors
 ardhchalkon main bahut se anya upyogi gun bhi dekhne ko milte hai, jaise kisi ek disha main duusare disha kii apeksha aasaani se dhara pravaah 
 In addition, the conductivity of semiconductors can be reduced or increased by adding a controlled amount of impurities
 in ashuddhiyon ko milaane kii prakriya ko 'dopan' kehete hai
 Electronic devices are made by doping
 inaki chaalakata ko baahar se lagaae gaye vidyut kshetra yaa prakaash ke dwaara bhi parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 Even their electrical conductivity can be changed by stretching or pressing
 apane inhen gunon ke kaaran ye ardhchaalak prakaash evam anya vidyut sanketon ko aavardhit karne vaali yuktiyaan banane, vidyut sanketon se niyantrit switch banane, tathaa urja parivartak ke rup main kaam karte hai
 Quantum physics is used to understand the properties of semiconductors
 ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan main silicon kaa sabase adhik prayog hota he
 Its main properties as compared to other materials are low cost of raw materials, ease of manufacture and wide temperature operating range
 vartmaan main ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke nirmaan ke liye pehle silicon ko kam se kam 300mm kii chaudai ke baul ke nirmaan se kiya jaataa he, taaki is se itani hi chaudi vefer ban sake
 The use of germanium was widespread at first, but silicon has taken its place due to its extreme hypersensitivity
 aaj jarmenium or silicon ke kudhatu kaa prayog akasar ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan me hota he; ai bi em ese yuktiyon kaa pramukh utpaadak he
 The use of gallium arsenide is also widespread in the manufacture of ultra-efficient devices, but this material does not form wide boules, which makes it expensive to make semiconductor devices from gallium arsenide compared to silicon
 anya padaarth jinka prayog yaa to kam vyapak he, yaa un par anusandhan ho rahaa he: How is a semiconductor 2-way! bhai nirmal singh khalsa ek prakhyat gurbani gayak raagi hai

 Salinity is the amount of salt or salt in water

 In general, the ratio of the load of ocean water and the weight of dissolved substances in it is called oceanic salinity
 mahasagariya jal main upasthit lavanta ke kaaran samudr kaa jal khaaraa hota he
 ek 1 kilometre samudri jal main 4
10 karod ton lavan hota he
 is aadhaar par yadi saare jalmandal ke namak ko samtal rup se bichaaya jaae to sampurna prithvi par 150 meter moti namak kii parat ho jaaegi
 Mathematically oceanic salinity is expressed in the total amount of salts present per 1000 grams of water
 The salinity of the sea is about 35 per thousand seas, so 1000 grams of water contains about 35 grams of salt
 Earth is the main source of oceanic salinity
 The main means of collecting salts are rivers, ocean waves, winds, volcanic eruptions etc
 sagariya jal main lavan kii maatra main bhinnata pai jaati he to bhi lavenon kaa saapekshik anupaat lagbhag ek sa hi rahata he
 The lines joining places of equal salinity in oceanic regions are called symmetry lines

 In the Sargosse region of the North Atlantic Ocean, salinity is 38 per thousand
 The reason for this high salinity is that due to the cyclic flow of ocean currents, intermediate water is not able to mix with the water of other areas

 faras kii khadi main lavanta kii maatra 48 prati hajaar pai jaati he
 Due to lack of rain, low supply of clean water, excess of evaporation, high temperature etc
 this salinity is high

 The inner sea and the lake are completely surrounded by land
 The amount of salinity in the Dead Sea is 238 per thousand due to extremely hot and dry winds, lack of rainfall, high temperature and excess of evaporation
 In the southern part of the Caspian Sea, salinity is found to be 170 per thousand and in the northern part only 14 per thousand
 In the northern part of the Caspian Sea, the rivers Ural, Volga etc
 supply clean water
 The highest salinity in the world is 330 per thousand in Turkey's Vaughan Lake

 Salinity increases up to a depth of 400 meters in the middle latitudes
 Then its volume decreases with depth
 This happens because the supply of clean water on the surface is low and evaporation is high

 The above promotions are normal
 However, different oceans are seen in different oceans
 For example, the surface salinity in the South Atlantic Ocean is 33 per thousand
 34
5 per thousand at 400 meters depth, 34
8 per thousand at 1200 meters
 But near 20 ° south latitude is 37 on the surface and 35 per thousand on the bottom
 In the equatorial part, it is 34 on the surface and 35 per thousand on the bottom
 The North Atlantic Ocean has a salinity of 35
5 at the surface and 34% at the bottom
 There is considerable variation in the distribution of salinity in partially surrounded seas

 The Joker is a fictional character, appearing as the main villain in Christopher Nolan's 2008 superhero film The Dark Knight
 disi comics ke isi naam ke ek charitra par aadhaarit joker kaa abhinay australian abhinayta hith lager ne kiya tha
 The Joker is a psychopathic mass murderer with a sensitive sense of humor, and is known for his efforts to undermine the efforts of Batman, James Gordon, and Harvey Dent to free Gautham City from crime
 yah charitra avyavashtha, araajaktaa or junun ityadi vishyon kaa pratik he; puri film ke dauraan vah aparaadh ke madhyam se saamaajik vyavastha ko uthal-puthal karte rahane kii ichha vyakt karata he, or bitman ke saath apane sangharsh se hi khud ko paribhaashit karata he
 Ledger's interpretation of the character is particularly influenced by the graphic novels Batman: The Killing Jock and Archam Asylum: a Serious House on Serious Earth
 film main charitra ne apana paaramparik rang pallate pahana he, jabaki uske chehre par joker kaa mechap he, or chehre par glassgo smil ke nishaan hai
 Ledger's selection as Joker was initially considered controversial, and he was not an expected choice for the role
 joker ko lager kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan mana jaataa he; or unhone khud ise apane sabase sukhad paatr ke rup main mana he
 His performance became an overnight sensation when the film was released in July 2008, six months after Ledger's death due to an accidental overdose, and received universal acclaim as well as several posthumous awards
 , One of which also had an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor
 joker paanch nakaabposh sahyogiyon ke saath ek bheed bhare bank ko luutane jaataa he
 While robbing the bank, he murders each other by four out of five people, and then kills the last person himself and leaves with all the money
 baad main vah kuch mukhya gundon, sal maroni, chechan or gambol kii apane accountint lou ke saath chal rahi ek video conference main hastkshep karke bitman ko lut ke aadhe hisse ke liye maarane kii peshkash karata he
 Gambol refuses this offer and places a reward on the death of the "joker"
 haalanki baad main, joker gambol ko martha he, or uske giroh kaa sargana ban jaataa he
 After learning that Batman has caught Lau, Maroni and Chechen accept the Joker's offer
 joker saarvajanik ghoshnaa kar detaa he ki "log tab tak lagaataar maare jaaenge jab tak ki bitman apni asli pahchaan nahin dikhaa detaa", or gotham ke police ayukta gilian bi lob or nyaayadhish jenet surilo kii hatya karkipani dhamkee ko satya sabit karwaata he
 When Gotham's district attorney, Harvey Dent, identifies himself as Batman, attempting to get the Joker out of his hideout, the Joker attempts to kidnap him, and is arrested
 dent ke achaanak gaayab hone par bitman usase poochtacha karata he
 The Joker also reveals that Dent's girlfriend Rachel Dawes has also gone missing, and then informs Batman of the different locations of the two, telling him that the bomb will explode simultaneously in both places, and that Batman is either of them Only one can save
 joker yahaan bhi bitman se chaalaaki karata he, or bitman ko dent kaa pataa bataa detaa he, jiskaa cheharaa visphot main kharaab ho jaataa he, jabaki rahel kii duusari jagah par maut ho jaati he
 The Joker then escapes the police station with Lau
 joker lau or chechan ko maar detaa he, or sabhi paison ko jalaakar chechan ke giroh kaa bhi sargana jaataa he
 Subsequently, to prevent Coleman Reese, the M&A law accountant of Wayne Enterprises, from revealing Batman's true identity on TV, he declares that if Reese is not killed within 60 minutes, he will bomb the hospital 
 isse puure nagar main aatank fail jaataa he, or is dauraan joker dent se milane ke liye ek nurse ke rup main chhipakar gotham general aspataal main ghus jaataa he, or rahel kii maut ke liye jimmedaar logon par badla lene ke liye dent ko prerit karata he
 He then blows up that hospital, and takes the hostages in a bus and takes them with him
 vah do jahaazon par visphotak lagaakar unamem nagarikon or aparaadhiyon ko alag-alag kaid karata he, or unhen bataata he ki yaa to un main se koi ek duusare jahaaj ko uda de, nahin to vah donon jahaajon ko nasht kar sabko maar degaa
 Ultimately, the men on both ships choose not to fly each other
 bitman baad main joker ko pakad letaa he, or tab joker usase kahata he ki un donon main se koi bhi ek-duusare ko marane nahin de saktaa he, kyonki uskaa maananaa he ki un donon kaa astitv hi ek duusare se hameshaa ladate rahane par aadhaarit he
 The Joker also tells Batman that he has won the "battle for the soul of Gotham", as the city dwellers will lose hope once they see Dent's killer's "second face"
 joker iske baad hinsak rup se hansata he, jab use hiraasat main le jaaya ja rahaa hota he
 Batman finally foils the Joker's plan by taking Dent's crimes to his head
 ek shuruaati abhinayta ke rup main, hith lager ne khud ko jo bhoomika nibhaai thi, usase khud ko gambhirtha se sanlagn nahin kiya tha
 This changed, however, at the age of 22 he started watching some of his films
 yah samajhate hue ki ve filmein thim, vah vastav main khud ko dekhnaa nahin chahta tha, isane unhen apane peshewar vikalpon ke prati or adhik satark or aadarneey bana diya
 The 2005 fantasy film The Brothers Grimm marked a turning point for the actor as director Terry Gilliam gave Ledger opportunities to create characters they had not previously been given
 gilium ne lager ko us film ke liye ek joker adhinium daalane main madad kii, abhinayta ne baad main joker ke rup main unke pradarshan ke prabhaav ke rup main ek anubhav ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 Director Christopher Nolan had met Ledger over the years for various roles
 bitman shuruyaat main bitman ke hisse ke liye baithak karte samay lager ne samajhaayaa ki unhen aisi film par kaam karne main koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 The actor reflected on his problems with portraying superheroes; “I just feel stupid and stupid
 main ise khinch nahin sakaa or aise log bhi hai jo puri tarah se kar sakate hai, lekin main khud ko gambhirtha se nahin le sakaa
 "although Batman was later influenced by Begins, Ledger sought the Joker's part from Nolan
 lager ke drudh sankalp se prabhavit, nolan ne unhen bhaag main daal diya
 “heath was ready to do just that, he was ready to do something big
 " casting diarector jon papsida ne casting pasand par parilakshith kiya or kaha ki film nirmaataaon ko pataa tha ki unhen bhaag khilne ke liye kisi ko saahsee kii jarurat he
 Heath Ledger was cast before there was a script
 hith lager ne joker ko "manovigyaan, samuhik hatya, shunya sahanubhuti ke saath schizophrenik joker" ke rup main varnit kiya
 Highlighting the opportunity for freshness, the actor aimed for a new and different interpretation of the character, different from previous film incarnations
 lager or christopher nolan donon ne film main joker kii upasthiti par najar rakhane ke bare main bataaya, charitra ke liye koun sa sandarbh bindu hone ke liye aam sandarbh bindu saajha karnaa
 Based on philosophical notions of anarchy and anarchy, he looked at art by Francis Bacon for visual reference and talked about Malcolm mcdowell's performance as Alex in Stanley Kubrick's film a Clockwork Orange, and Alex of the same name
 In the novel by Anthony Burgess

 In an interview with MTV, Ledger said that he considered the experience of seeing the Joker as the funniest, "and probably will ever be"
 charitra ke paaramparik rang pallate pahane hue, joker ko ek patali taai or hari qamar main pahana jaataa he, jo bangnee overkot se upar he, stylist vikalp jo new romanticwaad ke yug main sunate hai
 Her shoes have an upward tilt at the toe, reminiscent of the toe shoes
 unhen kisi bhi tarah kii pahchaan nahin he or unke asli naam yaa prishthbhumi ke bare main koi spasht jaankaree nahin he; jab unhen gotham city police dwaara giraftaar kiya jaataa he, to unhen apane jeb main keval chaaku or lint milte hai
 Joker's hair is hard, inefficient and dyed green
 uskaa cheharaa safed joker mechap kii ek pataakhe or chalane vaali parat main dhakaa hua he, uski ankhen mote taur par kaale rang main uthi hui hai
 Under a sloppy reddish brown makeup is painted on a Glasgow smile, which extends from mouth to cheek
 film aalochak peter trevers ne joker ke bare main likhaa tha, "narak se taaja baalo ke pile rang ke bal or pile daant"
 The manner of the character has a quality of unpredictability
 unki awaz aksar pich main badal jaati he, taaki vah ucch baatcheet ko maarane ke liye apni baatcheet bolta he, uske baad neeche do octonv landing karne main sakasham tatkaal kam aawaaj hoti he
 Nolan admits this unpredictability to be part of the character's drab physical movements, stating that Ledger's performance is "always a surprise"
 joker kii shaareerik upasthiti ke bare main, jeff bouchar ne los angeles times ke liye likhaa tha ki charitra apni jeebh ke saath chehre ke nishaan kii jaanch karata he or "kandhe ke saath chalata he or uski thodi baahar or neeche, ek hina kii tarah chalata he"

 According to "jupiter Agam": "hindu" shabd "sindhu" se bana mana jaataa he

 hindu shabd us samay dharm ke bajaay rashtriyata ke rup main prayukt hota tha
 Since at that time there were only people who believed in Vedic religion in India, but no other religion had emerged till then, so the word "hindu" was used for all Indians

 According to Hinduism, all beings in the world have a soul
 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta
 lekin zyaadaatar hindu swayan ko kisi bhi sampradaay main vargeekrut nahin karte hai
 In ancient times and medieval times, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava used to fight among themselves
 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih
 punarjanmani vishwaasah sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he

 The culture or religion which has not originated and developed on the land of India, how can that religion or culture be Indian
 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc
 ye sabhi devtaa puraanon main ullikhit hai or unki kul sankhya 33 koti bataayi jaati he

 in sabake alaava hindu dharm main gaay ko bhi mata ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God
 devataaon ke guru brihaspati maane gaye hai
 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith
 There is a great devotion among our countrymen towards pilgrimages
 isliye shankaracharya ne in pitho kii sthapana karke deshavaasiyon ko puure bharat ke darshan karne kaa sahaj avasar de diya
 These four shrines are called Char Dham
 logon kii manyata he ki jo in chaaron dham kii yatra kar letaa he, uskaa jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God 
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities
 garbhagrih main ishtdev kii murti pratishthit hoti he
 The temples are the best symbols of ancient and medieval Indian art
 kai mandiron main har saal lakhon tirthayatri aate hai

 The very latest era started before the Great Depression, which continues till today
 is yug main prithvi kaa bahut bada bhaag him se dhakaa tha, lekin iske antim sahasron varshon main adhikansh him pigal gaya or bahut-si himchaadaren lupt ho gai hai, jis se aaj dhruv pradeshon ke atirikt keval kuch hi bhaagon main himastar dikhaai detaa he
 Geologists have found that in the Pleistocene era, many parts of the temperate and tropical regions were snowed
 inhen in bhaagon main himandon kii upasthiti ke pramaan mili hai
 At these places, debris of spherical clay and glaciers are seen
 saath hi himaneey pradeshon ke amit chihn jaise himani ke maarg kii chattaanon kaa chikna hona, unpar bahut si kharochon ke nishaan pade rahanaa, shilaon par dhaariyaan hona aadi vidyaman hai
 The valleys of the glacial territories are of the shape of the English letter 'U' and the compositions of snow-clad rock and iceberg are seen in them
 aniyat golashm arthath anaath shilakhand kii upasthiti bhi himaneey pradeshon kii pahchaan he
 These are the rocks that have no relation with the rocks of that region, they come on a long journey with the glaciers and remain there when the snow melts, ie, the glaciers are lost
 uparyukt pramaanon ke aadhaar par bhu-vigyaniyon ne yah tathy sthapit kiya he ki plastocinyug main europe, america, antarctic or himalay kaa lagbhag 205 lakh varg kilometre kshetra himchaadaron se dhakaa tha
 Snow flowed in four directions in North America, mainly from the three snowstorms, Labrodor, Keewatin and Kourdilarion, covering an area of about 102 million square kilometers

 prayadwipiya bharat main bhi himandyug ke pramaan mili hai, par yah pratyaksh na hokar paroksh hai
 Flora and fossils of cold climate have been found in the Nilgiri Mountains, Annamalai and Shivarai Mountains
 parasnath kii pahadiyon tathaa aravali parvat main vanaspatiyon ke avshesh mili hai jo ab himalay parvat main ugti hai
 This indirect evidence indicates that the climate of these parts at that time was different from today's climate
 atyantnutan yug main himaniyaan kai baar badi or ghati
 In Europe, four ice ages of this era and four intimaalas have been established

 The origins of the primitive man are first estimated between Gunj and Mindal Himalayas
 vishwa ke anya bhaagon, jaise america aadi main bhi, in chaaron himakalon kii sthapana kii pushti hui he
 In India too, there have been signs of four snowflakes equivalent to Europe
 shimla kshetra main faili peenjoresthar kii chattaane gunj himyug ke samakaleen hai
 Upper Conglammarite - stone rocks are equivalent to the Mindal ice age

 About 35 crores years ago, large parts of Africa, India, Australia and South America were snowed in the Carbon Age
 anumaanath: carboniyug main him kaa vistaar plystocin yug kii apeksha kahin adhik tha
 Other images of the existence of the spherical clay and glaciers have also been found in the rocks of the Cambrian Neolan in Canada, South Africa and India
 kinhin kinhin kshetron main madhyajivi mahakalp tathaa nutanjivi mahakalp se bhi himastar ke pramaan uplabdh hai
 Low temperature and sufficient snowfall are necessary for the creation of glaciers
 himakshetron main himpat kii maatra adhik hoti he or greeshm ritu kaa taap us him ko pighalaane main asamarthan rahata he, at: prati varsh him ekatra hota rahata he
 In this way, Himani is formed due to continuous snow accumulation
 upyukt vaataavaran milane par himanion kaa aakaar badhata jaataa he or yah brihad rup dhaaran kar leti hai or prithvi kaa ek bada bhaag barf se dhank jaataa he
 Climate change, change in the state of the water bodies, diminishing effect of the sun's softness, the migration of poles from their place, the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the root cause of glaciation
 yah prithvi kii nimnlikhit gatiyon par nirbhar he - ghurnaksh kaa ayan, prithvi ke aksh kii paribhramandisha kaa kaksha par vicharan, bhukaksha kaa ayan
