 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 a transformer or transformer is an electrical machine with no moving or rotating components
 vidyut upkarnon main sambhavtah transafarmar sarvaadhik vyapak rup se prayukt vidyut sashitr he
 It transfers electrical energy from one electric circuit to another circuit by means of conductors connected by electric induction
 transfarmar keval prayavarti dhara yaa vibhavaantar ke saath kaary kar saktaa he, ekadish ke saath nahin
 Transformers can be one-phase, three-phase or multi-phase
 yah sabhi vidyut mashiinon main sarvaadhik daksh mashin he
 In the modern era, the transformer has become an integral part of the electrical and electronic industries
 kisi transafarmar main ek, do yaa adhik vinding ho sakati hai
 The number of primary and secondary winding turns of two winding transformers and their potentials has the following relation: is sutara se spasht he ki primary voltata ke diye hue maan ke liye primary evam secondari vinding ke pheron kii sankhya kaa uchit chayan karke ham dwitiyak vinding main icchit vibhavaantar praapt kar sakate hai
 When the voltage of the secondary winding is greater than the voltage of the primary winding, such transformer is called the high transformer
 iske vipareet jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se kam hota he to aise parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 The main use of transformer is to convert electric power to high voltage or low voltage
 aisa karne se vidyut urja ke upyog main suvidha or dakshata aati he
 It is important to note that the ideal transformer does not generate energy or power, nor does it change power, nor does it change frequency
 parinamitra prayukt vidyut ke kshetra main Probably the most widely used vaidyut sashitr he
 All the credit for the predominance of the alternating current in the industries as compared to the direct current is only to the resultant
 yah aisa saadhitra he jo nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara ko ucch voltata kii nimna dhara main or ucch voltata kii nimnadhara ko nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara main parinamit karata he
 This result is accomplished with minimal loss of energy and without the aid of any moving part in the appliance
 100 volt kii 10,000 wat vidyutakti ke parinman ke liye 100 ampiore dhara aavashyak hoti he
 But only one ampere current at a voltage of 10,000 is sufficient
 at: duusari sthiti main pehali kii apeksha bahut hi kam vyasavaala or is kaaran sasta chaalak aavashyak hota he
 The conductivity of the transformer is based on a unique finding by Michael Faraday, according to which the induced conductor force in the circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux across the region bounded by the circuit
 saralatam rup main parinamitra main do alag alag kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinka chumbakeey paripath ek hi hota he
 The coil of the transformer is identified according to the direction of flow of power
 praathmik kundali ko prayavarti vidyudurja ke strot se jodate hai or dwitiyak ko lod se
 Energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil by electromagnetic induction
 adarsh parinamitra ke kriyasanchalan kii visheshtaayen hai : In practice, this ideal situation is unpredictable
 parinamitra kii praathmik kundali se judi sambharan voltata chumbakeey flux utpann karti he, jo parinamitra ke patlit crode se sambhddha hoti he
 The alternating voltage Ep connected to the primary coil of the transformer is expressed as the density Bm of the highest magnetic flux, the area a of the transverse section of the lattice core, the frequency f of the alternating current of the alternating current, and the number of naps in the primary coil
 : praathmik kundali main pravaahit dhara dwaara utpann prayavarti chumbakeey flux dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton ko bhi sambhddha karata he
 The difference between primary and secondary coils is only the number of wraps, so the effective value of the induced voltage in the secondary coil is prakaar praathmik or dwitiyak voltata kaa nimnlikhit anupaat praapt hota he: The number of wraps in the primary coil N1 is kept less than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2 when the voltage of the primary coil is required to increase
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai or praathmik kundali kii voltata yadi dwitiyak kii voltata se adhik he to praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sankhya N1 dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se badi hogi
 This type of transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 saamanyat: parinamitra kaa swaroop nimnlikhit baton se nirdhaarit hota he: The efficiency of a simple power transformer is very high at normal load, ranging from 90 percent in small units to 98 percent in large transformers
 saamaanya: pratishat main vyakt parinamitra kii dakshata ko is prakaar abhivyakt kar sakate hai : There is a difference in the instantaneous efficiency of the transformers and the efficiency throughout the day
 parinamitra ke niyantran kaa arth hota he nivesh voltata ke sthir rahane par purna lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata or bina lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata kaa sambandh
 When expressed as a percentage, control can be defined as: chote parinamitron ke liye niyantran 2 se 5 pratishat or bado ke liye lagbhag 1 pratishat ke kram kaa hota he
 The transformer mainly consists of two parts: 1) kor - jo kisi chumbakeey padaarth kii banaayi jaati he
 2) Winding - which is made of copper, aluminum or any other conductor wires or bus bar
 iske atirikt kuchaalak aadi bhi prayog kiye jate hai jo vinding ke pheron ko aapas main yaa kor se chhune se rokte hai
 Transformer oil is used in high voltage transformers which prevent sparks from exceeding breakdown strength and heat by cooling the core and coil
 parinamitra ko thanda rakhane ke liye tel ke alaava evam kai anya shitakon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he jaise pani evam gas aadi

 One day Raju saves the life of a rich textile mill owner while going for a job interview
 vah use apane kaarkaane main naukari pradaan karte hai, jo unki mahatvakankshi beti sheethal dwaara sanchalit he
 Raju works as a mechanic in the mill and asks Sheetal several times for proper treatment of the workers
 vah union netaa ke rup main bhi chunaa jaataa he, jo sheethal ko pasand nahin aata
 Raju meets Kajal, who works in the textile mill itself
 ve pyaar main padate hai
 a competitive textile mill owner tries to eliminate Suryadev Sheetal
 raju use dhakka dekar bachaata he
 Although he saves her, Sheetal angrily slaps her in front of all the workers
 baad main, raju sheethal ke cabin main jaataa he or use paanch baar thappad martha he
 To get revenge, Sheetal proposes to marry her
 jab raju usase inkaar kar detaa he to vah uski maa ko vivaah se sahamat hone ke liye majaboor karti he
 Raju accepts his mother's wishes and decides to renounce his love for Kajal
 raju apni maa ke aadesh par sheethal ke ghar main rahanaa shuru kar detaa he, haalanki vah mil main maikenic ke rup main apana kaam jari rakhata he
 Gradually Raju starts liking Sheetal and starts loving her
 jab suryadev ke kuch gunde phir use maarane kii koshish karte hai to vah phir se use bachaata he
 However, tension ensues between Raju and Sheetal when she drives Kajal out of jealousy as Sheetal often sees Kajal going to Raju's house

 Paper is a thin material on which it is written or printed
 kaagaj mukhya rup se likhane or chapai ke liye prayukt hota he
 It is also used for packaging goods
 maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas main kaagaj kaa bahut bada yogadan he
 The paper is made by pressing the wet fibers and then drying it
 ye tantu praaia: celulose kii lugdi hote hai jo lakdi, ghaas, bans, yaa chithdon se banaaye jate hai
 Plants contain a carbohydrate called cellulose
 paudhon kii koshikaon kii bhitti celulos kii hi bani hotin he
 Hence, cellulose is the main substance of the scaffold of plants
 celulos ke reshon ko paraspar jutakar ekasam patali chaddar ke rup main jo vastu banaai jaati he use kaagaj kehete hai
 Any plant or material that has a good amount of cellulose can be suitable for making paper
 rui lagbhag shuddh celulos he, kintu kaagaj banane main iskaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa kyonki yah mahangi hoti he or mukhya rup se kapadaa banane ke kaam main aati he
 Cellulose fibers have the properties of being able to form a mutually covered sheet, hence paper can only be made from this
 resham or oon ke reshon main is prakaar paraspar jutane kaa gun na hone ke kaaran ye kaagaj banane ke kaam main nahin aa sakate
 The more pure cellulose is, the more clean and beautiful the paper becomes
 kapadon ke chithde tathaa kaagaj kii raddi main lagbhag shatpratishat celulos hota he, at: inase kaagaj saralata se or acha banataa he
 Historians speculate that the first paper was made in China from rags made of cloth
 paudhon main celulos ke saath anya kai padaarth mili rahete hai, jinamein lignin or pectin paryaapt maatra main tathaa khanij lavan, vasa or rang padaarth sookshm matraaon main rahete hai
 a good paper cannot be made from cellulose until these substances are obtained separately by extracting sufficient fraction of the cellulose
 lignin kaa nikaalnaa vishesh aavashyak hota he
 If sufficient amounts of lignin are present in cellulose, the cellulose fibers are difficult to obtain
 aarambh main jab tak celulos ko paudhon se shuddh rup main praapt karne kii koi acchhee vidhi gyaat nahin ho saki thi, kaagaj mukhya rup se fate sooti kapadon se hi banaaya jaataa tha
 Although the paper is very simple and of excellent quality due to rags and paper scrap, it is not possible to get such a quantity that the entire requirement of paper can be met with the paper made from them
 aajkal kaagaj banane ke liye nimnlikhit vastuon kaa upyog mukhya rup se hota he : chithde, kaagaj kii raddi, baans, vibhinn pedo kii lakdi, jaise spruce or chid, tathaa vividh ghaasein jaise sabai or asparto
 Bamboo and Sabai grass are mainly used in paper making in India

 untisvin putali maanavati ne is prakaar katha sunai- raja vikramaditya vesh badalakar raat main ghumaa karte the
 One day, wandering reached the banks of the river
 chandani raat main nadi kaa jal chamakta hua bada hi pyaara drishy prastut kar rahaa tha
 Vikram was standing quietly on the river bank when he heard a loud sound of "bachao-bachao"
 ve aawaaj kii disha main daude to unhen nadi kii vegavati dhara se jujhate hue do aadmi dikhaai pade
 Looking closely, they came to know that a young man and a young woman were trying to swim to shore, but the currents of the river carried them away
 vikram ne badi furti se nadi main chalaang laga di or donon ko pakadakar kinare le aae
 Youth was spilling from the girl's limbs
 vah atyant rupasi thi
 Apsaras would also be ashamed after seeing her appearance
 koi tapasvi bhi use paas paakar apni tapasya chhod detaa or grihasth banakar uske saath jivan guzaarane kii kaamana karata
 Both were grateful and were looking at their life-saver
 yuvak ne bataaya ki ve apane parivaar ke saath nauka se kahi ja rahe the
 They could not see the vortex in the middle of the river and their boat got stuck in the vortex
 bhavar se nikalne kii un logon ne lakh koshish kii, par safal nahin ho sake
 All the members of his family got trapped in that vortex, but both of them managed to swim here somehow
 raja ne unka parichay poocha to yuvak ne bataaya ki donon bhai-bahan he or saarang desh ke rahane vaale hai
 Vikram said that he will be sent safely to his country
 uske baad unhone unhen apane saath chalane ko kaha or apane mahal kii ore chal pade
 When they reached near the palace, the priests recognized Vikram and bowed
 yuvak-yuvati ko tab jaakar maaloom hua ki unhen apane praanon kii parvaah kiye bina bachaane vaala aadmi swayan maharajaadhiraj the
 Now he started looking at Maharaj with more than grateful eyes
 mahal pahunchakar unhone naukar-chaakaron ko bulaayaa tathaa sari suvidhaon ke saath unke thaharne kaa intjaam karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Now both of them were filled with more respect for Maharaj
 vah yuvak apni bahan ke vivaah ke liye kaaphi chintit rahata tha
 His sister was more beautiful than princesses, so he wanted him to marry a king
 magar uski aarthik haalat acchhee nahin thi or vah apane iraade main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 When King Vikramaditya happened to meet him by chance, he thought why not offer Vikram marriage to his sister
 yah vichaar aate hi usne apni bahan ko thik se taiyaar hone ko kahi tathaa use saath lekar rajmahal unase milane chal padaa
 When her sister came out carefully, her look was worth seeing
 uske rup par devtaa bhi mohit ho jate manushya kii to koi baat hi nahin
 When he came to the palace, Vikram asked him how he was going and said that proper arrangements have been made for his departure
 usne raja kii kritagyata jaahir karte hue kaha ki unhone jo upkaar us par kiye use aaajeevan vah nahin bhuulegaa
 He then asks Vikram to accept a small gift
 raja ne muskuraakar apni anumati de di
 Seeing the king happy, he thought that they had become fascinated by his sister
 uskaa hausala bad gaya
 He said that he wants to give his sister a gift
 vikram ne kaha ki uskaa uphaar unhen sweekaar he
 Now he was confident that Vikram would make his sister queen
 tabhi raja ne kaha ki aaj se tumhaari bahan raja vikramaditya kii bahan ke rup main jaani jaaegi tathaa uskaa vivaah vah koi yogya var dhundkar puure dhooma-dham se karenge
 He stared at Vikram
 use sapane main bhi nahin bhaan tha ki uski bahan kii sundarata ko andekha kar vikram use bahan ke rup main sweekaar karenge
 Can any glorious king remain so high above lust
 chodi der baad usne sanyat hokar kaha ki udaygiri kaa rajkumaar udayan uski bahan kii sundarata par mohit he tathaa usase vivaah kii ichha bhi vyakt kar chukaa he
 The king summoned a Pandit and sent a lot of money as a gift, taking the proposal of marriage to Udayagiri State
 pandit usee shaam laut gaya or uske chehre par hawaiyaan ud rahi thim
 When asked, he told that some bandits surrounded him and looted everything
 sunakar raja stabdh rah gaye
 He wondered how the robber robbers became active despite such good governance
 is baar unhone pandit ko kuch ashwaraiyon ke saath dhan lekar bheja
 That same night, Vikram changed his clothes to find those bandits
 ve us nirjan sthaan par pahunche jahaan pandit ko lut liya gaya tha
 On one side they saw four men sitting
 raja samaj gaye ki ve lutere hai
 Vikram was considered an undercover
 raja ne unase bhaybheet nahin hone ko kaha or apane aapako bhi unki tarah ek chor hi bataaya
 To this, he said that he is not a thief but a respected person and has reached here in search of solitude to discuss a particular issue
 raja ne unase bahaanaa na banane ke liye kaha or unhen apane dal main shaamil kar lene ko kaha
 The thieves then revealed that there were four different ingredients in each of them
 ek chori kaa shubh muhoort nikaalata tha, doosraa parinde-jaanwaron kii zabaan samajhataa tha, teesraa adrishy hone kii kala jaanata tha tathaa chauthaa bhayanak se bhayanak yatnaa paakar bhi uf tak nahin karata tha
 Vikram said to win his trust- "I can see the hidden wealth anywhere
 " jab unhone yah visheshta suni to vikram ko apni toli main shaamil kar liya
 He then planned to steal a part of his own palace
 us jagah par shahi khazaane kaa kuch maal chipa tha
 When they brought the thieves there, the four thieves were very happy
 unhone khushi-khushi sara maal jholii main daalaa or baahar nikalne lage
 The watchful guards caught them
 subah main jab raja ke darbar main bandi banaakar unhen pesh kiya gaya to ve dar se pattey kii tarah kaanpane lage
 He saw his fifth companion ascending to the throne
 ve gumsum khadey rajdand kii pratiksha karne lage
 But Vikram did not punish him
 unhen abhaydaan dekar unhone unase aparaadh na karne kaa vachan liya or apni khoobiyon kaa istemaal logon kii bhalaai ke liye karne kaa aadesh diya
 All four accepted the greatness of their king and decided to live like good men
 raja ne unhen sena main behaal kar liya
 Udayan also accepted the proposal of marriage of Raja Vikram's sister-in-law to his sister
 shubh muhoort main vikram ne usee dhooma-dham se uski shaadi udayan ke saath kar di jis tarah kisi rajkumaari kii hoti he

 It is worth noting that oxidation or reduction do not occur alone but together, and that is why it is called 'redox reaction'
 Consider the Galvanic cell shown in the image to the right: it is constructed with a piece of zinc submerged in a solution of zinc sulfate and a piece of copper submerged in a solution of copper sulfate 
 The overall reaction is: At the Zn anode, oxidation takes place
 This is represented in the following oxidation half-reaction: At the Cu cathode, reduction takes place 
 This is represented in the following reduction half-reaction : Bismarck Brown y is an organic compound

 Public interest litigation, in Indian law, provides for litigation to protect the public interest
 anya saamaanya adalati yachikaaon se alag, isamen yah aavashyak nahin kii peedit paksh swayan adaalat main jaae
 It can be filed in favor of any citizen or victims by the court itself
 jahia ke abtak ke maamalon ne bahut vyapak kshetron, karagaar or bandi, sashastr sena, balshram, bandhua mazdooree, shahari vikaas, paryaavaran or sansaadhan, graahak maamle, shiksha, raajnneeti or chunaav, lokaneeti or javabdehi, maanavadhikaar or swayan nyaaypalika ko prabhavit kiya he
 Judicial activism and Jahiya have expanded in parallel to a large extent and the public interest litigation has been generally welcomed and supported by the middle class
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki janhit yachika bhartiya samvidhan yaa kisi kanoon main paribhaashit nahin he
 It is derived from the constitutional interpretation of the Supreme Court, has no international equivalent and is seen as a distinct Indian property
 is prakaar kii yachikaaon kaa vichaar america main janma
 There it is called 'social Action Petition'
 yah nyaaypalika kaa avishkaar tathaa nyaayadhish nirmit vidhi he
 Public interest litigation was started by PN Bhagwati in India

 They work on public interest sentiment

 They are aimed at getting quicker and cheaper justice to a common man and getting the executive legislature to do their constitutional work
 ye 'samooh hit' main kaam aati he naa ki vyakti hit main
 If they are misused then the petitioner can be fined
 inako swikaarna yaa naa swikaarna nyaayalay par nirbhar karata he
 For acceptance of public interest petitions, the Supreme Court has made certain rules - iske laabh 1
 This petition increases consciousness about the rights of the people and the role of the judiciary, it broadens the field of fundamental rights, in which the person gets many new rights
 2
 yah karypalika vidhayika ko unke sanvaidhanik kartavya karne ke liye baadhit karti he, saath hi yah bhrashtachar mukt prashasan kii sunishichatata karti he Criticisms 1
 ye saamaanya nyaayik sanchaalan main baadha daalati he 2
 Their tendency to misuse is on iske chalate supreme court ne khud kuch bandhan inke prayog par lagaaye he Public interest litigation is different from regular judicial proceedings
 haalaanki yah samakaleen bhartiya kanoon vyavastha kaa mahatvapurn ang he, armbh main bhartiya kanoon vyavastha main ise yah sthaan praapt nahin tha
 It did not start suddenly, but developed slowly due to several political and judicial reasons
 kaha ja saktaa he ki 70 ke dashak se shuruyaat hokar 80 ke dashak main isaki avadharana pakki ho gayi thi
 In AK Gopalan and Madras State Cases, the Supreme Court interpreted Section 21 of the Constitution literally and ruled that the 'legal process' as explained in the section refers only to a process which is written in a legislation and passed by the legislature
 Have gone arthath, agar bhartiya sansad aisa kanoon banaati he jo kisi vyakti ko uske jeene ke adhikaar se atarksangat tareeke se vanchit karata ho, to vah maanya hoga
 The Court also held that the legal process of Section 21 does not involve natural justice or reasonableness
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi mana ki amareeki samvidhan ke ulat bhartiya samvidhan main nyaayalay vidhayika se har drushtikon main sarvocch nahin he or vidhayika apane kshetra main sarvocch he
 This decision was also severely criticized but the decision remained for more than 25 years
 ye ucchtam nyaayalay ke aarambhik varsh the jab iskaa rukh saavdhaneebhra or vidhayika samarthak tha
 This era is, in every way, the present day environment, when the concept of judicial review has been established and the court is seen as an institution that provides relief to citizens and also makes policy-making which the state has to abide by
 Was different from
 baad ke faislon main, nyaayalayon kii sarvocchata sthapit hui or is bich vidhayika or nyaaypalika ke bich matbhed or sangharsh bhi hua
 In Golak Nath and Punjab State Case, a Bench of 11 judges held by a 6-5 majority that Parliament cannot pass a constitutional amendment that violates fundamental rights
 keshavanand bharti or kerala rajya cese main ucchtam nyaayalay ne golak nath nirnay ko radd karte hue yah doorgaami siddant diya ki sansad ko yah adhikaar nahin he ki vah samvidhan kii moulik sanrachana ko badalane vaala sanshodhan kare or yah bhi mana ki nyaayik samiksha moulik sanrachana kaa bhaag he
 The ADM Jabalpur and others of the Supreme Court and the Shivakant Shukla case, in whose judgment the civil liberties took place during the Emergency, also contributed to the decision of the Court to give the executive freedom to influence civil liberties and the right to live
 is believed
 is faisle ne adaalat ke naagarik swatantraaa ke sangrakshak hone kii bhoomika par prashnchihn laga diya
 After the Emergency there was a qualitative change in the attitude of the court and after this one can see the development of Jahiya to some extent as a reaction to this criticism
 menka gandhi or bhartiya sangh cese main nyaayalay ne e ke gopaalan cese ke nirnay ko palatakar jivan or vyaktigat swatantraaa ke adhikaron ko vistaarit kiya
 Jahia's first major trial was in 1979 in the Hussainara Khatoon and Bihar State case relating to the inhumane conditions of prisoners and prisoners under consideration
 yah ek adhivaktaa dwaara di indian express akhbaar main chape ek khabar, jisamen bihar ke jelon main band hajaaron vichaaradhin kaidiyon kaa haal varnit tha, ke aadhaar par daayar kiya gaya tha
 As a result of the trial more than 40,000 prisoners were released
 twarit nyaay ko ek moulik adhikaar mana gaya, jo un kaidiyon ko nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This theory was also accepted in later cases
 em si mehta or bhartiya sangh or anya - is lambey chale cese main adaalat ne aadesh diya ki dilli master plan ke tahat or dilli main pradooshan kam karne ke liye dilli ke rihaayshi ilaakon se kareeb 1 xxrep 5 0 audyogic ikaiyon ko dilli se baahar sthanantarit kiya jaae
 This decision led to industrial unrest and social instability in the National Capital Region at the end of the year 1999 and it was also criticized that the interests of common laborers were being ignored by the court for the environment
 is jahia ne kareeb 20 lakh logon ko prabhavit kiya tha jo un ikaiyon main sevarat the
 In another related judgment, the Supreme Court ordered in October 2001 that all public buses of Delhi be run only by CNG fuel in a phased manner
 kyonki yah mana gaya ki si en ji deazal kii apeksha kam pradooshnakaari he
 However, later it was also found that diesel with very low sulfur may also be a better or better option
 anna drmuk ke saansad pi ji narayanan dwaara madras ucch nyaayalay main daayar jahia, jisamen nyaayalay se sangh sarkaar ko janhit main san tivi privet limited ke diarect tu home seva ke aavedan ko asweekrut karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha, ko nyaayalay ne sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 There has always been a possibility of abuse of Jahiya
 or kai maamalon kii aalochana bhi hui he
 In a case of the Supreme Court itself, the observation is "if it is not controlled properly and its misuse is not prevented, it can become a weapon of propaganda, retaliation, personal or political selfishness by unscrupulous hands
 "bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke ji balakrishnan ne 8 oktober 2008 ko singapore lau academy main diye gayi apane bhaashan main jahia kii anivaaryta duhraate hue yah bhi mana ki jahia dwaara nyaayalay manamaane tareeke se vidhayika ke nitigat faislon main dakhal de saktaa he or aise aadesh de saktaa he jinka kriyanvayan karypalika ke liye kathin ho or jisase sarkaar ke angon ke bich ke shakti santulan kii avhelnaa ho
 He also believed that Jahia has given birth to meaningless cases, which have nothing to do with public justice
 nyaayalay main mukademon kii sankhya badhaakar isane nyaayalay ke mukhya kaam ko prabhavit kiya he or mana ki jajon ke apane adhikaron se aage badhane kii sthiti main koi jaanch prakriya bhi nahin he

 According to Oppenheim's statement, the succession of a state occurs when a state with international approval takes over the position of one or more of such states due to a change in the state of a state
 rajya ke uttaradhikaar kaa vishay un do rajyon ke adhikaron or dayitvon ke hastantaran se sambandh rakhata he, jinamein ek hota he tirohit yaa vilupt rajya or doosraa hota he uttaradhikari rajya 
 The rights and responsibilities of the first or extinct state go to the second state
 rajya kaa uttaradhikaar do prakaar kaa hota he- Full succession occurs when a state that has received international approval due to defeat or voluntary merger is assimilated by another such internationally accepted state
 udhaahranswaroop, san 1936 main italy dwaara abisinia kaa samamelan yaa swaadhikaran, athwa san 1958 main misr or syria kaa vilyan
 Partial succession occurs at that time- jab kisi rajya kaa koi pradesh vidroh karke pruthak ho jaataa he or swayan ek antarrashtriya sweekrutipraapat rajya ban jaataa he, jaise san 1776 main sanyukt rajya america kaa apane pitrurajya britain se pruthak ho janaa; athwa- When a state by surrender establishes its authority over a territory of another state, such as the surrender of California to the United States in 1847; Or- jab purna samprabhutaprapt koi rajya, apni swatantraaa kaa kuch ansh khokar, kisi sangh rajya main sammilit ho jaataa he, athwa kisi adhik shaktishaalee satta ke aadhipaty athwa sangrakshan main aa jaataa he, athwa jab koi apurna samprabhutaprapt rajya purna samprabhutaprapt rajya kaa swaroop praapt kar letaa he, jaise san 1938 main chackeslovakia kaa vikhandit hona
 The question has not yet been decided as to whether a state becomes a successor by taking over the rights and obligations of the lost state when it takes over another state
 kuch lekhak is prashn par vichaar karte karte isn antim sire par ja pahonchte hai ki adhikaron or dayitvon kaa uttaradhikaar kabhi hota hi nahin
 Some others are of the view that some rights and obligations fall on the successor state
 parantu aisi baat kisi bhi lekhak ne maanya nahin ki he ki lupt rajya ke sabhi adhikaar or daayitv uttaradhikari rajya par aa hi jate hai
 From the method prevailing in various states, it is evident that generally these things do not come in succession

 The rights and obligations that the successor state derives from treaties by treaties depend on the type of treaty

 These are individual treaties and, by nature, they are believed to exist before the treaty states
 parantu yah prashn abhi vivaadaaspad he ki rajya dwaara kii gai vaanijya sandhiyaan, videshi aparaadhiyon ke pratyrpan sambandhi sandhiyaan athwa isi prakaar kii sandhiyaan vaid rahati hai athwa nahin

 There is no general principle in international legislation that the successor state is also the heir to the constitutional obligations of the departed state

 This can only happen if a special treaty has been made in this regard
 saamanyat: anubandhan athwa abhyarpan kii sandhiyon main is baat kaa ullekh rahata he ki uttaradhikari rajya vilupt rajya ke saarvajanik rin kaa dendar rahegaa athwa nahin
 Individual lenders of the extinct state have no right to intervene so that they can personally claim their debts over the successor state
 unka apana rajya vilyankaree rajya par is baat ke liye dabaav daal saktaa he ki vah rajya kaa rin chukaane ke antarrashtriya daayitv ko vahan kare
 The successor state is not obliged to pay the unpaid Tawan or damages in respect of the damage inflicted to the Tirohit state
 parantu yadi ukt rajya ke vilyan ke purv usne kshatipurti kaa aisa koi daayitv sweekaar kiya he or uske falswaroop yadi koi rin liya gaya he to uttaradhikari rajya kaa yah kartavya he ki vah use chukaaye
 Similarly, the indemnification of contractual dispensation cannot also be recovered from the successor state but if such compensation has already been decided from the prenuptial state, the merging state should pay it
