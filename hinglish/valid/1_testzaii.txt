 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption

 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August

 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge

 The time limit for investigation was kept at seven years

 Wherever the administration takes him, his fast will be there, "we will sit on a hunger strike in jail, taken there and if left again, we will come back to JP Park

 Therefore, the second fight for independence has started
 desh ke sabhi logon ne mere bhai, meri bahan, yuva - yuvatiyon ne yah jo mashaal jalaai he, is mashaal ko kabhi bujhane nahin dena
 The torch will continue to burn even if Anna Hazare remains

 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is

 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
 sansad kii kaarywai kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekhakar evam netaaon ke bayaan or chehre dekhakar janata anna ke saath rahane ke nirnay par atal thi
 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue 
 asli anshan puri ladaai jeetne ke baad tuutegaa
 i will roam across the country till the fight is over
 unhen vishwaas he ki unke madhyam se saamne laae gaye janata ke muddon se sansad inkaaranheen karegi
 But if the parliament refused, then the mass parliament would have to be ready
 aaj yah baat sabit ho gai he ki jan sansad, dilli kii sansad se badi he
 Whatever the Parliament wants, the Parliament of Delhi has to accept it
 hamen baba sahib ambedkar ke banaae samvidhan ke tahat is desh main parivartan laana he
 Today it has been proved that change can be brought
 ham bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This is just the beginning

 It is the question of the farmers, the question of the workers

 It is a question of education of poor children
 hamen chunaav sudhaar bhi karne hai
 The entire system has to be changed
 hamaara asli anshan is puure badlaav ke baad hi tuutegaa
 Today such a big movement took place in the country, but completely non-violent
 duniya ke saamne aap sabhi ne misaal rakhi he ki andolan kaise karnaa chahie
 This has been the most important thing in this movement
 22 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, raksha mantri e

 chidambaram se charchaa ke baad sarkaar ne pranav mukherjee ko vaartakar niyukt kiya or anna ko patr likhakar is sarkari pahal kii jaankaree di
 After this, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Anna's aide Arvind Kejriwal and Akhil Gogoi met at the residence of Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 iske baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has been appointed for this

 The government expressed concern over Anna's health and said that talks would be held again on Wednesday morning
 anna dal ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar or hamaare bich teen muddon par asahmati he
 The government has sought time till Wednesday morning to consider them
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anna se anshan todane kii bhi apil kii he
 But in the conversation that took place today, nothing came out that we should ask Annaji to break the fast
 vaarta main sarkaar kuch muddon par sahamat ho gai thi
 But many subjects had not yet been agreed
 iske saath hi anna ke sahyogi kuch sharton par sarkaar kii manjuuri bhi chaahate the
 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers
 iske turant baad congress kor group kii baithak bhi hui
 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he
 i don't know why it changed in the government's attitude in one day and night
 mangalvaar ko wo hamaari baaten sun rahe the, aaj wo apni baaten suna rahe the
 Yesterday, he was respecting our words
 kal or aaj main din-raat kaa fark aayaa he
 " is gatirodh ke pashchaat 25 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vilasarav deshmukh ko patr dekar anna ke paas bheja
 Anna assured to quit the fast after three things were approved
 27 agast ko sansad kii kaaryava ke saath hi anna ke sahyogiyon se bhi lagaataar barta chal rahi thi
 But the government was not making its stand clear
 antat shaam tak in vaartaon kaa parinaam anna kii teen maangon par sansad ke samarthan ke prastaav ke rup main aayaa
 Vilas Rao Deshmukh again came to Ramlila Maidan with a letter from the Prime Minister to inform about it
 jiske pashchaat anna ne 28 agast ko anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast
 unka rakt chaap kaaphi kam ho gaya tha
 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August
 rajdhani dilli, mumbai, kolkata, patna, ranchi, lakhanu, bengaluru, shimla, jaipur, raipur, gandhinagar sahit puure desh main diwaali jaisaa maahaul ban gaya
 In Delhi, Anna Hazare's supporters reached India Gate waving the tricolor and shouting slogans to express their happiness
 log deshbhakti ke geeton par jhuumate najar aae
 Several individuals got out of the cars and joined the procession

 patna ke saath hi rajya ke darbhanga, purniya, saharsa, mujffarpur, bhagalpur sahit kai jilon main is janata kii jeet kaa jasn manaaya gaya
 It was really only a moral victory
 itihaas jarur bana tha kintu kaagajon par kisi thos cheez kaa nikalakar aana abhi baaki tha
 Yes, it definitely made way for him
 anna ke teen sharton ke samarthan kaa prastaav sansad ne sthai samiti ko bhej diya tha jise maananaa uske liye kanoonee rup se baadhya nahin tha
 Further, the Standing Committee was empowered to analyze all these suggestions and also decide how practical they were
 sansad ne sarkaar ke us mul tark ko saidhantik rup se kaayam rakhaa tha ki kaanoon banane main sansad kii bhoomika sarvopari he or us par sawaal nahin uthaae ja sakate
 After a day-long debate in Parliament, DMK, Bahujan Samaj Party, Marxist Communist Party, Communist Party of India, Samajwadi Party and Biju Janata Dal had made it clear that Parliament should not play a role in the appointment of Lokayukta as it would give autonomy to the states
 Will be affected inamen se kuch dalon ne aise kisi qadam ke virodh karne kii manshaa bhi saafe kar di thi
 The Congress accepted to bring the lower bureaucracy under the Lokpal, but also said that a fundamental change in the legal and institutional structure is yet to be done
 saansadon ne jan lokapal bill kii sansad ke andar saansad ke vyavhaar ko lokapal ke kaary kshetra main laane kii dhara kaa dalgat bhaavana se upar uthakar ek swar main virodh kiya tha
 Many parties also opposed bringing the judiciary under its purview
 kuch dalon ne iske badale rashtriya nyaayik ayog banaae jane kii vakaalat kii or kuch ne majboot javabdehi vidheyak laane par jor diya tha
 The government did not give any promise on the issue of including the Prime Minister
 bhaajapa samet kai dalon ne kuch aihtiyaat ke saath pradhanmantri ko bhi isamen shaamil kiye jane kaa jarur samarthan kiya
 The final decision on how to bring two more important demands, the cbi's anti-corruption unit under the Lokpal and the dismissal of corrupt bureaucrats, was also left to the standing committee
 is janandolan ne raajnneetik dalon ke chehron par pade lokahitaishi nakaab ko hataakar swaarthee sattakankshi or janvirohi charitra ko spasht kar diya
 Along with the opposition parties, the most perverted face of it was the Indian National Congress, the ruling party at the center
 uske vakil mantriyon kapil sibbal, pi chidambaram aadi ne swayan ko shaasha evam anna hajaare kii team ko gulam maanakar tughluqi aadesh or bayaan jari kiye
 On 14 August, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari personally attacked Anna Hazare and said that Anna is corrupt
 iske liye unhone congress sarkaar dwaara gathit nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat kaa sandarbh diya tha, jisamen anna ko doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 He did not say that after the report of Justice Sawant, Sukhtankar Commission had investigated the issue and discharged Anna

 Manmohan Singh warned foreign powers to be behind this movement in Parliament
 ambika soni ne ise saaf karte hue america kaa naam ujagar kiya
 All the leaders repeatedly called for the supremacy of the Parliament and tried to make the efforts of the people chaotic
 ve yah bhul gaye ki bhartiya samvidhan kii prastaavna ham bharat ke log se shuru hoti he jo bharat ko samprabhu, loktantric, samaajawaadee or dharmanirpeksh banaaengen
 The benevolent and gregarious people of the government and those sitting in the government, left no stone unturned to suppress and break this movement, directly and indirectly
 gayi
 The personality and gratitude of Anna Hazare, the leader of the movement for taking the form of the national movement of the campaign against corruption, included the right and timely decisions of a skilled team
 arvind kejariwal, kiran vedi, prashanth bhushan aadi samarth logon kii team ne is andolan ko nirantar sahi raste par rakhaa or uske pathbhrasht hone kii gunjaaish samaapt kar di
 Yes, if anyone comes to our support, he is welcome

 Hyperbolic functions may also be deduced from trigonometric functions with complex arguments: where i is the imaginary unit with the property that i 2 = − 1
 { \ displaystyle i^{2}=-1
} The complex forms in the definitions above derive from Euler's formula

 It is because of its specialty that these reconnaissance aircraft are used extensively
 in vimaanon ko drone vimaan bhi kaha jaataa he

 DRDO Nishant is an unmanned aircraft developed by the Aeronautical Development Establishment of India, a branch of DRDO, for the Indian Armed Forces
 hindu devvaad par vaidic, puranic, tantric or lokdharm kaa prabhaav he
 In Vedic religion one can imagine the tangible form of the deities
 vaidic manyata ke anusaar devtaa ke rup main mulshakti sristi ke vividh upaadaanon main samprukt rahati he
 The same consciousness is in all the ingredients
 yahi chetana yaa agni anek sfurlingon kii tarah ek hi paramatma kii vibhutiyaan hai
 
 vaidic devataaon kaa vargeekaran teen kotiyon main kiya gaya he - prithvisthaneey, antarikshasthaneey or dyusthaneey
 Agni, Vayu and Surya represent these three categories respectively
 inhen tridevon ke aadhaar par pehle 33 or baad ko 33 koti devataaon kii pariklpana kii gai he
 33 There is a big difference in the name and form of the gods from the texts
 ‘shatapath brahman’ main 33 devataaon kii suchi apekshaakrit bhinn he jinamein 8 vasuon, 11 rudron, 12 adityon ke sivaa akaash or prithvi ginaae gaye hai
 The imagination of more than 33 deities is also very oriental
 rugveda ke do mantron main 3339 devataaon kaa ullekh he
 Thus although Vedic Devism was originally based on monotheism, it was later differentiated by special qualitative nouns in such a way that they gradually assumed independent characterization
 unka swaroop charitra main shuddh prakritik upadanatmak na rahakar dhire dhire lok aasthaa, manyata or parampara kaa aadhaar lekar maanvi athwa atimanvi ho gaya
 In the post-vedic period, mythological Tantric literature and religion and folk religion had such an influence on Vedic Devism that the Vedic gods, after leaving their form and virtues in the later period, were established in a different form in Lokmanas itself
 parvarti kaal main bahut se vaidic devtaa gaun pad ko praapt hue tathaa nae devswaroopon kii kalpanaayen bhi hui
 With this situation, the nature and importance of Indian Devism became more widespread
 hindu dharm main koi bhi upaask apni ruchi ke anusaar apane devtaa ke chunaav ke liye swatantra tha
 However, it was also stated in the scriptures that the deity can be worshiped according to work and purpose
 is prakaar nripon ke devtaa vishnu or indra, brahmanon ke devtaa agni, surya, brahma, shiv nirdhaarit kiye gaye he
 According to another arrangement, Vishnu of gods, Rudra Brahmins, Moon or Soma Yakshas and Gandharvas, Saraswati Vidyadharas, Hari Sadhya Sampradayas, Parvati Kinnaras, Brahma and Mahadev Rishis, Surya, Vishnu and Uma Manu, Brahma Brahmacharis K, Ambika Vaikhanasans, Shiva Yatis, Ganapati or Ganesha are the special deities of Kushmands or Ganas
 kintu samaanya grihasthon ke liye is prakaar kaa bhedbhaav nahin lakshith he
 All gods are worshiped for him
 hindu devpariwaar kaa udbhav brahma se mana jaataa he
 Brahma is the first in the trinity
 bhartiya dharna ke anusaar brahma hi strashta hai or ve hi prajapati hai
 He is one and his wish that i become enough is the reason for the prosperity of the world
 mandu upanishad main brahma ko devataaon main pratham, vishwa kaa karta or sangrakshak kaha gaya he
 The introduction of Brahma in Vedic literature as the doer is given by various names, such as Vishwakarmana, Brahmasvati, Hiranyagarbha, Prajapati, Brahma and Brahma
 puraanon main in naamon ke atirikt dhaataa, vidhaataa, pitamah aadi bhi prachlit hue
 The importance of Brahma in mythological literature is secondary to Vedic literature
 upasna kii drushti se jo mahatta vishnu, shiv, yahan tak kii ganpati or surya ko praapt he, vah bhi brahma ko nahin mila, kintu vaidic devataaon main prajapati ke rup main brahma sarvamaanya hai or is rup main ve akaash or prithvi ko sthapit karne vaale tathaa antariksh main vyaapt rahete hai
 They keep the whole world and all beings in their arms
 is prakaar rugveda main brahma kaa amoort rup hi atharv maanya he
 His imagination in human form is also very ancient
 atharv or bajasaneyi samhita main bhi ve sarvopari devtaa ke rup main sweekaar kiye gaye hai
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, he is said to be the father of the gods and elsewhere in the same scripture that Brahma existed in the beginning of the universe
 maitrayani samhita main prajapati ke apni putree ushas par aasakt hone kii katha milti he jo parvarti sahitya main vistrut rup se duharai gai he
 The belief of Brahma in the latter society declined due to moral attitude towards this story
 brahma kaa swabhaav bhi unki lokapriyata main baadhak hua
 He did not become popular as Vishnu and Shiva as a cult deity and could not be a special character of devotion due to the special advocacy of tapas and yajna
 saath hin vishnu or shiv kaa virodh karanevaale asur or devon par bhi ve sahaj hi anukanpa karte the atev donon hi sampradaywaalon ne inaki upeksha kii he
 Brahma gradually becomes so insignificant in Hindu mythology that as Madhu Katabha's story shows, he is unable to protect himself and expects Vishnu's grace
 vaishnav or shaiva donon hi sampradaywale apane aradhy dev vishnu or shiv ko brahma kaa aradhy dev maanate hai
 This type of approach had an impact on the Indian religion that neither a religious sect could stand in India on the basis of that deity, nor separate idols of Brahma were established in abundance as a worshiper
 brahma ke mandir bahut hi kam milte hai
 According to the Shastravadhana, Brahma should be worshiped only by Vedic Brahmins as a worshiper
 puraanon tathaa shilpashastron ke anusaar brahma chaturmukh hai
 There is a law to display Akshamala, Shruva, Book and Kamandalu in their four hands
 granthbhed se brahma ke aayudhbhed bhi hai
 According to the era, they have been called Kamalasana in Kali, Viranchi in Dwapar, Pitamah in Treta and Brahma in Satyuga
 inaki savitri or saraswati do shaktiyaan hai
 The form of Savitri has been determined according to Vidhan Brahma
 brahma ke asht pratihaaron ko satya, dharm, priyodbhav, yajna vijay, yajyabhadrak, bhav or vibhav ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to mythological beliefs, the 'will' of Vishnu is dominant in the state of creation
 sristi kaa paripaalan vishnu apni shakti lakshmi ke sahyog se karte hai
 Vishnu is the symbol of 'desire', Lakshmi of 'bhuti' and 'kriya'
 is prakaar ichha, ‘bhuti’ or ‘kriya’ se shadgunon kii utpatti heti hai
 Shadguna are knowledge, opulence, power, strength, semen and tejas
 ye hi sristi ke upadan hai
 Two of these two qualities make three tangible forms which are famous in the name of Sankarshan, Pradyumna and Anirudha in the world
 vasudev main sabhi gun hai
 Chaturvishti Vishnu was conceived in the Gupta era on the basis of Adi Vasudeva
 inke naam kramash: vasudev, keshav, narayan, madhav, purushottam, adhokshaj, sankarshan, govind, vishnu, madhusudan, achyut, upendra, pradhyumna, trivikram, narsingh, janardan, vaaman, shridhar, aniruddh, hrushikesh, padmanabh, damodar, hari or krishna hai
 The incarnation of Vishnu has special influence on Indian religion and faith
 avatharavaad kii bhaavana vaidic he
 The 'shatapath' and 'aitareya' Brahmins discuss the Matsya, Koorm and Varaha incarnations of Vishnu
 granthbhed se vishnu ke avtaron or unkekram aadi main bada antar he kintu saamanyatya avtaron kii sankhya das maani jaati he
 Discussing Dashavatara from the point of view of sculpture, Shilpastras have instructed Matsya and Koram to be made as an art form
 narsingh kaa mukh singh kii tarah or bhayankar daanton tathaa bhunhon se yukt bananaa chahie
 Varah is Varahmukh and his armaments are mace and lotus
 narsingh ke bhi yah aayudh hai
 Earth is located on the tooth of Varah

 Vishnu also has some distinctive forms

 The temple of Deogarh has a large beautiful statue of the Vishnu, the reservoir
 jalshaayi bishnu ko suptadarshit kiya jaataa he
 They are shown lying on the right side and holding flowers in the left hand

 The Vaikuntha octagon, the infinite Dwadshagon, the trilokya Mohan, the Shodashbhuj and the Vishwmukh are the winged arms
 vaikunth, trailoky mohan or anant or vishwamukh ke chaar mukh kramash: nar, narsingh, strimukh or varahamukh hote hai
 Kapilanan is sometimes made in place of Varaha Anan in the statue of Trilokya Mohan
 vishnu kaa vaahan garud he or unke asht pratihaaron ke naam chand, prachand, jai, vijay, dhaataa, vidhaataa, bhadra or samudr hai
 From the point of view of sculpture, there is a great similarity between the original form of Vishnu and Surya
 kintu panchdevon main inkaa vishnu se pruthak sthaan he
 From the Vedic period, the importance of the Sun was accepted in Hinduism
 i0 pus0 pratham shatee se suryopasna ke prati nishtha sampradayik rup le baithi
 Even in the Gupta era, the public interest in the worship of the sun continued to grow
 madhyakaal main, visheshkar bengal main surya kaa vishnu ke samaan hi mahatv mana gaya
 In Buddhism and Jainism, the worship of Sun became widespread
 bhaja buddha gupha main tathaa anant kii jain gupha main surya kii pracheen murtiyan ankit hai
 There are many differences in the nature of the Sun in terms of iconography
 kamalasana murtiyan praaia: dvibhuj hoti hai, jinamein shwet camel hota he tathaa ve saptashwarath me pradarshit kii jaati hai
 There is a special description of the idol of the Puranas Udichyveshi Surya, in which Surya bears a long coat and boots like the Iranian gods
 aisi udichyaveshi suryapratimaaen ratharudh bhi pradarshit hoti hai
 This form of Surya became particularly popular in Mathura art

 Shiva has a special place in Tridev
 vaidic rudra kaa puranic shiv se pratyaksh mail to nahin baithta kintu iske aadhaar par shivopasana vedottar bhi nahin maani ja sakati
 Dhyanayogi and Pashupati Shiva have been enumerated in the Indus civilization
 shiv sanhaar ke pratik hai, kintu sampraadayik bhavukta kii atirekta main inhen sristi kii sthiti or sthayitv kaa bhi kaaran samajha jaataa he

 From the point of view of idolatry, the form of the goddesses is usually the same as their god or they accept the armament, posture and symbol of their deity

 Worship of Lakshmi and Saraswati is more prevalent among Vaishnavites

 Two forms of Lakshmi are described in Shree and Vaishnavi Shilpasastra
 vaishnavi ke rup main ve chaturbhuj hai or apane haathon main vishnu ke aayudh shankh, dhvaj gada or padam dhaaran karti hai
