 In ancient times, animals did not have jaws

 Meteorology or meteorology is a science covering many disciplines which studies the atmosphere
 mausam vigyaan main mausam kii prakriya evam mausam kaa purvanumaan adhyayan ke kendrabindu hote hai
 The history of meteorology is thousands of years old, but there was no significant progress till the 18th century
 unnisvin shatee main vibhinn deshon main mausam ke aakadon ke prekshan se isamen gati aayi
 In the second half of the twentieth century, there was a revolution in this area by the use of computers to forecast the weather
 mausam vigyaan ke adhyayan main prithvi ke vayumandal ke kuch charon kaa prekshan bahut mahatv rakhata he; ye char hai - taap, hawa kaa daab, jal vaashp yaa ardrata aadi
 The value of these variables and their rate of change determine the weather to a great extent
 rituvigyaan vayumandal kaa vigyaan he
 In modern meteorology, physical phenomena occurring in the atmosphere and their associated sub-shells and water-solids are studied
 rituvigyaan ke vishay kaa varnan, jahaan tak uskaa sambandh nichle vayumandal kii mausami ghatnaon se hai, adhiktam suvidhapurvak nimnlikhit chaar bhaagon main kiya ja saktaa he: Mechanical meteorology, which is concerned with the observations and observations by which the weather conditions of the atmosphere are reported
 bhautik tathaa gatik rituvigyaan jisamen prekshit ritu sambandhi ghatnaon kaa gunatmak tathaa parimanik vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Concise meteorology, which is primarily concerned with the study of concise observational observations by concatenation maps for weather forecasts
 jalwaayu-tatv jisamen sansar ke sab bhaagon ke aartav prekshanon kaa sankhyikeey adhyayan hota he or uske dwaara un prasamaanya tathaa madhyamaan paristhitiyon kaa thik-thik pataa lagaaya jaataa he jiske dwaara jalwaayu kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 In the weather observations, which give knowledge of the state of the atmosphere, the following things are seen: vaayu kaa taap tapamapi dwaara napa jaataa he
 This thermometer is kept unaffected by solar radiation
 vaayu kii ardrata gyaat karne ke liye geele tapamapi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 On this thermometer bulb, a single fold of wet muslin cloth is wrapped
 ardrata kii maatra sookhe tharmametre tathaa geele tharmametre ke pathyankon se nikaali jaati he
 It is measured by an aerodynamic and it reflects the weight of air on the earth
 pawan kii disha tathaa veg kaa prekshan kiya jaataa he
 The direction is taken from where the wind comes and is marked in 16 or 32 points of the compass
 veg pawan-vegamapi dwaara mapa jaataa he or mile prati ghanta yaa kilometre prati ghanta yaa meter prati second main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Humidity leads to knowledge of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and, as stated earlier, it is measured by dry and wet thermometers
 isamen vayumandaleey sanghanan ke sab prakaar ke drav evam thos utpaadan sanmilit hai
 The quantity of clouds and their types, fog and rain, snow, hail, etc
 are observed
 prayek prakaar kaa badal akaash ke jitne bhaag main vyaapt ho utane ko puure akaash ke dashanshon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Condensation particles that are large enough to fall on the earth in the form of rain
 us kshaitij duuri ko kehete hai jahaan tak kii badi or spasht vastuen dikhaai de sakati hon
 Relates to vertical visibility and is measured by the height of the cloud
 pracheen kaal se hi manushya ritu tathaa jalwaayu kii anek ghatnaon se prabhavit hota rahaa he
 The oldest texts of aerodynamics are Aristotle's 'meteorologica' and the wind and weather works of his disciples
 aristotle ke pashchaat agle do hajaar varsho main rituvigyaan kii adhik pragati nahin hui
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, mainly rules of mechanization and gas were established
 isi kaal main tapamapi kaa avishkaar san 1607 main galiliyon gelili ne kiya or avenzelista toriceli ne san 1643 main vaayu dabmapi yantra kaa avishkaar kiya
 After these inventions, the Law of Vials was invented in 1659

 The foundation of modern meteorology became established when Anthony Lavosie gained knowledge of the true nature of the atmosphere in 1783 and John Doulton in 1800 highlighted the changes in the atmosphere and the relation of air diffusion and atmospheric condensation
 19veen shatabdi main vikaas adhiktar sankshipt rituvigyaan ke kshetra main hua
 Many countries established meteorological institutions and opened seasonal observatories
 is kaal main ritu purvanumaan kii disha main bhi paryaapt vikaas hua
 In the first half of the 20th century, due to the increase in observations of wind velocity and direction, etc
 up to a height of 20 kilometers, the information received by the meteorologists was more advanced in meteorology
 upree vaayu ke aise prekshanon se rituvigyaan kii anek samasyaon ko samajhane main bahut adhik sahaayta mili
 During the First World War period, more and quicker observations of atmospheric conditions were required, for which arrangements were made to take up meteorological instruments by aircraft

 In the Second World War period, the demand for weather information mainly for the use of high-flying airplanes increased and the radar method was developed for the knowledge of the velocity and direction of air, etc
 at different heights, to meet this demand
 nichle vayumandal kii sukhi vaayu main anek gaison kaa mishran hota he jinamein mukhyat: nitrogen 78 pratishat, oxijan 21 pratishat, aragan 0
93 pratishat or carbon diaksaide 0

 In addition to these gases, there are other gases, such as hydrogen and ozone
 pawanon dwaara nichle vayumandal ke lagaataar mishran se tathaa urdhwadhar sanvahan se sukhi hawa kaa mishran itnaa aparivarti rahata he ki kam se kam 20 kilometre kii oonchaai tak to sukhi hawa kaa anubhaar 28

276 3 gram prati ghan sein
 hota he, jab vaayu daab 1,000 milibaar ho or taap 0° centegrade ho
 The presence of ozone in the atmosphere was confirmed by Fowler and Strutt with a spectroscope
 dobson ke prekshanon se bhi yah baat siddh ho gai he tathaa yah gyaan bhi praapt hua he ki ozone bhootal se lagbhag 30 se 40 kilometre kii oonchaai par ek simit str main pai jaati he
 The presence of ozone at these elevations is somewhat important for seasonal conditions
 dobson kii khoj se pataa laga he ki 10 kilometre oonchaai par kii vayudab main or ozone kii maatra main ghanishtha sambandh he
 In the atmosphere, only water vapor is the element whose physical state changes under normal atmospheric conditions
 at: vayumandal main jalawaashp kii pratishat aaytan maatra bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 Increasing the occurrence of water vapor in the atmosphere is extremely important for meteorology
 jal kaa vashpikaran tathaa sanghanan isliye mahatvapurn he ki na keval inase ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko jal kaa parivahan hota he, varan isliye bhi ki jal ke vashpikaran ke liye gupt ushma ke avasorana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It finally reappears and is used to heat the air when condensation of water vapor occurs again in condensation and snow
 yadhyapi nitrogen gas ammonia, nitric amla tathaa nitreton kaa mukhya avyav he or ye padaarth barood aadi main bahut mahatv rakhte hai, tathaapi vayumandal main yah gas bilkul niskriy rahati he
 This only attenuates oxygen gas, the more important component of the atmosphere, which is about one fifth of the atmosphere
 kisi bhi sthaan kii vayudab vahaan ke upar kii vaayu ke bhaar se utpann hoti he, isliye do vibhinn unchaaiyon kii vayudabon kaa antar in donon unchaaiyon ke bich kii hawa ke ekank anuprastha kaat ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 If this pressure difference is not exactly balanced by the weight of the middle air, then that air level receives acceleration upwards or downwards
 jis paristhiti main daab kaa antar or vaayu kaa bhaar santulit ho, athwa yon kahie ki gurutvajanit twaran ke atirikt koi anya urdhwadhar twaran vidyaman na ho, vah dravasthaitik santulan kii paristhiti kehalaati he
 This situation shows the rate of pressure change at any level with height
 yadi do dabastaron ke bich kaa daab antar ho or donon staron ke bich urdhwadhar duuri ho, ghanatv ho or gurutvajanit twaran ho, to This equation is called the hydrostatic equation
 gurutvajanit twaran vibhinn akshansh tathaa oonchaai ke kaaran thodaa sa hi ghatata badhata he, kintu daab, taap tathaa nami ke kaaran vaayu kaa ghanatv adhik maatra main ghatata badhata he
 Therefore, the vertical pressure in the atmosphere is highly variable

 First equation: doosraa sameekaran: Where Or converted to English units: Where oonchaai maapne kii pramanik vidhi yah he ki upar die hue sutara dwaara daab tathaa taap maapkar oonchaai kaa antar praapt kiya jaae or yadi yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa ho to ardrata kii maatra ko bhi kaam main laayaa jaae
 The authentic altimeter is based on this formula
 din ke samay surya se garmi milane or raat main vikiran dwaara prithvi ke thandi hone se vaayu ke taap main dainik parivartan utpann hota he
 The minimum temperature is slightly before sunrise and the maximum temperature is in the third hour
 vaayu ke taap kaa yah dainik parivartan bhootal ke upar se mukt vayumandal main shighrata se ghatata he
 The daily range of heat has not been found to exceed 2 ° or 3 ° c in most parts of the earth at altitudes of more than 5,000 feet and in desert regions at 10,000 feet
 bhootal tathaa vayumandal ko garmi lagbhag purnataya surivikiran se hi milti he
 Heat is very less than other celestial bodies

 This solar insolation energy is about 1
94 grams per square square centimeter per minute before entering the atmosphere at a moderate distance between the Earth and the Sun; The restriction here is that the rays of the sun fall on that square centimeter
 is maatra ko saura niyatank kehete hai
 Irregular curves found in the value of solar constant are less than one percent; These can be caused by observations
 in aniyamit ucchavachanon ke atirikt ek vaastavik or bada ucchavachan bhi paaya gaya he jo gyaarah varshiya surya-kalank-chakra main lagbhag pratishat tak kaa dirghakaalik ucchavachan or bhi ho saktaa he
 But all these reliefs are so small that in relation to atmospheric thermal equilibrium, it can be assumed that solar energy on Earth is 1
94 grams per square centimeter per minute
 anumaan kiya gaya he ki saura urja kaa 43 pratishat bhaag paravartit tathaa prakirnit tathaa prakirnan karne kii sammilit shakti ko albedo kehete hai
 This is 43 percent
 shesh 57 pratishat urja, jo prabhavakaari aatapan he, bhootal tathaa vayumandal ko ausatan 57 ushma ikaiyaan pradaan karata he
 Out of these 57 heat units, only a small part of the atmosphere is absorbed by the atmosphere, mainly by water vapor in the lower levels and by ozone in the upper stratosphere to a lesser extent
 vayumandal main vaashpan tathaa sanghanan kaa kaaran he vaayu kii jalawaashp grahan karne kii shakti main kami beshi, arthath ardra vaayu kaa garam yaa sheethal hona
 Generally, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is less than the saturated volume, especially near the ground floor where the effective insolubility of the atmosphere is maximum
 vaayu main nami kaa adhik bhaag, jo vayumandal main jalawashpachakr ko chalaata rahata he, vaashpan se praapt hota he
 As the water evaporates, it continues to diffuse into the atmosphere
 vayumandal main vaashpan dwaara honevaali mausami kriyaayein apekshaakrit mahatvapurn nahin hotin
 The evolution of visible steam is also a seasonal activity by evaporation
 garam jal kii sataha se shighratapurvak vaashpan hone ke kaaran bahut thandi athwa apekshaakrit thandi ardra vaayu ekadam ati santrupt ho jaati he
 This results in instant condensation of moisture in the form of visible steam, causing a dense fog in the stagnant air
 sanghanan kisi khuli sataha par us samay hota he jab us sataha kaa taap aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank ke taap se kam hota he
 Examples of this type of condensation are found in hot climates
 jaise, yadhyapi vaayu kii aapekshik ardrata sau pratishat se paryaapt kam rahane par bhi barf ke pani se bhare gilaas ke baahar vaayu kaa vaashp sanghanit ho jaataa he usee prakaar svachh prashanth raatri main os kaa sanghanan un bhootalsthit vastuon par ho jaataa he jo apni ooshmaa ke vikiran ke kaaran aasapaas kii vaayu ke osank se nimna taap tak thandi ho jaati hai, paala un satahon par jamata he jo hinma se bhi adhik thandi ho jaati hai, chaahe mukt vaayu kaa taap himank se kaaphi unchaa kii kyon na ho
 When condensation takes place in the form of small short bursts within the atmosphere, the question arises as to how this process begins
 prayog se siddh hua he ki purnat: ashuddhiheen vaayu main sanghanan jalbindu ke rup main nahin hota, chaahe usamen vashpadaab santrupti daab se das guni hi kyon na ho
 It seems that some kind of particles are not required to start condensation of water vapor which is not present in pure air
 is prakaar ke kan ko sanghanan nabhik kehete hai
 Tests have revealed that tiny particles of hydrophobic substances in the air, such as sea salt particles, act as condensation nuclei
 jin sthanon main kaarkaanon kaa dhuaan vayumandal ko dooshit kar detaa he, vahaan dhuen ke gandhak, phosforus aadi padaartho ke oxide ke nanhen kan sanghanan nabhik ban jate hai
 Generally, the fog and clouds of the lower troposphere contain tiny tobodies, ranging from hundred to ten thousand per cubic centimeter
 badalon main vashabindu athwa duusare varshanakan kis prakaar nirmit hote hai, yah vishay abhi sanshayyukt he
 Perhaps they are formed by combining many small clouds
 sangyojan vaayu kii dhaaraon ke milane or vaayu ke math uthne se hota hoga
 The accepted theory about intense precipitation with large dots is that these dots are formed when glaciers reach the upper parts of clouds where extreme cold water prevails

 Originally the normal circulation of the atmosphere arises due to the horizontal temperature between the Mediterranean and the polar countries
 ek prakaar ke vayumandal kaa saamaanya sanchaar vayumandal kii halchal kaa tathaa uski kriyaaon kaa ek vyapak vihangam chitra he
 If long-term daily seasonal maps are tested, it is known that there are two types of flow forms in them: alpajivi shighragami pratichakravaat tathaa avdaab 
 After this type of whirlpool starts from one day to one month it ends and then becomes completely invisible with maps
 ye gaun sanchaar naam se prasiddh hai
 Long-lived and slowly moving whirlpools
 ye bhi pratichakravarti athwa chakravaati prakaar ke hote hai, parantu deergh kaal tak lagbhag nishchal rahete hai
 These are called primary communication
 chitra 1 or 2 main janvari or july ke maheenon main prithvi par ausat samudrastareey dabrekhaayen di gai hai
 It is clear that the two images in the two pictures are similar in some respects
 donon maheenon main prithvi ke samast bumadhyarekhiy pradesh main ek apekshaakrit alp, kintu atyant ekasmaan, daab kaa akhand katibandh he
 In the January month it is somewhat north of the tropical equator, but in July month it is either exactly on that line or slightly south
 yah alp-daab-katibandh prashanth tathaa ushn mausam kaa katibandh he jo samudr par doldrum ke naam se prasiddh he
 We can call this entire tropics equatorial tropics

 This wide tropics is called the subtropical overgrowth which is a permanent form of normal communication in both hemispheres
 uposhnavalayik adhidaab katibandh ke dakshin main vayudab dakshin kii ore baraabar girti jaati he or antarctic mahadweep ke upar nunatam ho jaati he
 The following three primary pressure zones are introduced in the Northern Hemisphere: bumadhyarekhiy alpadaab katimbdh, jo donon golardhon main samaan rup se vidyaman rahata he
 The subtropical overpressure is completely different in this hemisphere
 janvari maas main yah samudron par lagbhag 25°-35° uttar main rahata he
 But in high latitudes above the continents, it is related to systems of high pressure
 ye dabpranaliyaan lakshan main ekadam bhinn hoti hai or isliye uposhnavalayik adhi-daab-katibandh ko samudron tak hi simit samajhnaa uchit he
 The sub-dipole tropic tropics are clearly visible on the map of January month
 is katibandh main do bade alpadaab kshetra iceland tathaa alusian dwipon par hai, jo krmanusaar uttartam atlantic mahaasaagar par tathaa uttartam pacific mahaasaagar par vistrut hai
 In between these two areas there is an area of relatively high pressure on the pole
 greeshm ritu main ye alpadaab bahut ksheen hote hai
 The Alushian region then disappears
 dhruvon par vayudab apekshaakrit adhik rahati he
 The discrepancy in the integrity of the subtropical overgrowth and subipolar torsion is due to new and unknown elements that are lacking in the Southern Hemisphere
 gaun sanchaar chaahe pratichakravaati hon yaa chakravaati, unka lakshan yah he ki ek yaa adhik samadab rekhaayen adhidaab kendron yaa alpadaab kendron ko chaaron ore se gherkar band kar detii hai
 Thus the overload area and the low pressure area are the local areas of excess or decrease of the weight of the atmosphere in order
 gaun sanchaar do prakaar ke hote hai : pratyaksht: ushmiya or gatik athwa pranodith 
 Thermal overgrowth and under pressure are usually caused by the cooling or heating of a particular part of the lower atmosphere
 gatik adhidaab tathaa alpadaab donon hi saamaanya sanchaar kii vayudharaon kii parsparik yantric kriyaaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Evidently thermal secondary communications include the flow and thermodynamic effects
 monsoon shabd ritusuchak arabi shabd se niklaa he or aarambh main arab samudr ke un pawanon ke liye iskaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa tha jo lagbhag chah maheene uttar-purv se or chah maheene dakshin-pashchim se chalati hai
 Now this word has also been applied to some other winds which are long and regular in different directions of the year from adverse directions
 in pawanon ke chalane kaa praathmik kaaran thal tathaa samudri kshetron ke tapon kaa ritujanit antar he
 They resemble the wind land and the hydropower, but they have a duration of one year instead of one day and they run on very wide areas rather than limited areas
 monsoon ko hindi main pawas kehete hai
 Meteorological changes of heat near the equator are generally too small for the growth of the pavement
 unche akshanshon main, jahaan pachhuva pawan chalata he or dhruviya pradeshon main, thal or samudr ke taap kii vibhinnata se bane vataghat prithvivyapee pavansancharon ko keval thodaa sa hi badalane main samarth hote hai
 In such a situation, the regions most favorable for the development of the monsoon are in the middle latitudes near the incubation
 sthal kii ore chalanevaale pawanon main vidyaman ardrata kii maatra kaa tathaa sthal kii ruparekha kaa pawasvarsha par atyant prabhaav padataa he
 Due to the above-mentioned consistency of various events, the maximum growth of the monsoon is on East and South Asia, and in many parts of these regions, the south-west summer moving monsoon is an important part of the climate
 pawasparisthiti uttar austrailia main, pashchimi, dakshini tathaa purvi africa ke bhaagon main or uttari africa tathaa chile ke bhaagon main bhi utpann hoti he, parantu bahut kam maatra main
 In India, the footfall comes suddenly and dramatically
 isaki utpatti dakshin bhartiya vyapaarik pawanon se hoti he
 In the beginning of the month of June, they begin to walk across the equator and turn towards the country of India mainly at longitude 80 ° east and about longitude 5 ° north
 june maas ke madhya main bharat ke pashchimi kinare par pahunchakar pawas dakshin pradesh ko paar kar letaa he or phir bharatvarsh, burma tathaa bengal kii khadi ke sab bhaagon main pahunch jaataa he
 Apart from the southern parts of South Pradesh, where these winds do not reach due to the cover of the hills of the Western Ghats, all parts of India receive heavy rainfall during the monsoon period
 yah varsha lagbhag purnataya sanvahneey hoti he
 For its progress, the conversion of vapor into water is controlled mainly by the heating of the surface and its height
 bhumital kii uthaan kaa prabhaav pashchimi ghaaton main, khaasi kii pahadiyon main, arakaan kii chotiyon main tathaa himalay parvat par bhalee bhanti dikhaai padataa he
 There is excessive rainfall in these parts
 kabhi kabhi gangaghati kii droni main bahut der tak vistrut varsha hoti rahati he
 This continuous rainfall is often due to the shallow avalanches that run at a slow speed in the west direction towards the main footfall
 bhartiya pawas kii shakti bahut ghatati badhati rahati he
 When the monsoon is intense, the rainfall in most parts of India is much higher than the average and the rainfall is less when the monsoon is light
 pawas kaa uttar kii ore badhanaa himalay pahaad ke kaaran simit ho jaataa he, parantu pawas kaa pravaah burma, thailand, indochin tathaa dakshin china main bahut pravichhinn rahata he
 The high hills situated near the axis of this peninsula are covered with dense convection clouds and there is frequent rainfall

 Therefore, much attention has been paid to the development of statistical long-term weather forecast in this country and statistical methods are being used in relation to the short-term changes of the Indian monsoon

 Used to live with Hindiba
 ek din hidimb ne apni bahan hindiba se van main bhojan kii talash karne ke liye bheja parantu vahaan hindiba ne paanchon pandavon sahit unki mata kunti ko dekha
 This demon fell in love with Bhima on seeing this, so he did not kill them all, which Hidimb felt very bad

 He had a son named Ghatotkacha

 In that forest was inhabited by a terrible asura named Hidimb
 maanvon kaa gandh milane par usne pandavon ko pakad laane ke liye apni bahan hidimba ko bheja taaki vah unhen apana aahaar bana kar apni kshudha purti kar sake
 On reaching there, Hidimba saw Bhimsen guarding him and became enamored of him by seeing his handsome Mukharvind and his body
 usne apni rakshasi maaya se ek apurv laavanmayi sundari kaa rup bana liya or bhimsen ke paas ja pahaunchi
 Bhimsen asked him, "O beautiful! Who are you and why are you wandering alone in this terrible forest at night?" In response to Bhima's question, Hidimba said, "O Narashrestha! i am a demon named Hidimba
 mere bhai ne mujhe aap logon ko pakad kar laane ke liye bheja he kintu meraa hriday aap par aasakt ho gaya he tathaa main aapako apane pati ke rup main praapt karnaa chaahati hoon
 My brother Hidimb is very wicked and cruel, but i have enough strength to save you from his clutches and reach a safe place
 " Seeing the delay in returning his sister here, Hidimb reached the place where Hidimba was talking to Bhimsen
 hidimba ko bhimsen ke saath premalap karte dekhakar vah krodhit ho uthaa or hidimba ko dand dene ke liye uski ore jhapata
 Seeing this, Bhima stopped him and said, "O evil demon! You do not feel ashamed to raise your hand on a woman? If you are so brave and mighty then fight me
 " itnaa kah kar bhimsen taal thonk kar uske saath mall yuddh karne lage
 Kunti and other Pandavas also got sleep
 vahaan par bhim ko ek rakshas ke saath yuddh karte tathaa ek rupavati kanya ko khadi dekh kar kunti ne poocha, "putree! tum koun ho?" hidimba ne sari baaten unhen bataa di
 Arjuna lifted his bow to kill Hidimba, but Bhima refused to release the arrow, "anuj! Don't leave the arrow, it is my prey and will die at my own hands
" " itnaa kah kar bhim ne hidimb ko donon haathon se pakad kar uthaa liya or use hawa main anek baar ghuma kar itani tivrata ke saath bhoomi par pataka ki uske praan-pakheru ud gayi
 When Hidimba died, they began preparing for departure from there, upon which Hidimba fell at Kunti's feet and prayed, "O mother! i have accepted your son Bhima as her husband
 aap log mujhe krupa karke sweekaar kar lijiye
 If you do not accept me, then i will give up my life at this moment
 " hidimba ke hriday main bhim ke prati prabal prem kii bhaavana dekh kar yudhisthir bole, "hidimbe! main tumhen apane bhai ko saunpta hoon kintu yah keval din main tumhaare saath rahaa karegaa or raatri ko ham logon ke saath rahaa karegaa
 "hidimba agreed to this and started living happily with Bhimsen

" " itnaa kah kar hidimba vahaan se chali gai
 Ghatotkacha bowed with reverence at the feet of the Pandavas and Mother Kunti and said, "now tell me my worthy service
 ? uski baat sun kar kunti boli, "tu mere vansh kaa sabase bada pautra he
 Your service will definitely be taken when the time comes
 " is par ghatotkach ne kaha, "aap log jab bhi mujhe samaran karenge, main aap logon kii seva main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, Ghatotkacha went towards the present Uttarakhand

 The Holocaust was a thought-provoking and planned attempt to eliminate the entire Jewish people from the root
 1933 main adolf hitler germany kii satta main aayaa or usne ek naslvaadi samrajya kii sthapana kii, jisamen yahudiyon ko sab-human qaraar diya gaya or unhen insaani nasl kaa hissaa nahin mana gaya
 In 1939, after Germany incited World War, Hitler began to implement his final solution to eradicate the Jews
 uske sainik yahudiyon ko kuch khaas ilaakon main thunsane lage
 Special camps were set up to get them working, to gather and kill them at one place, the most notorious being Auschwitz
 yahudiyon ko in shiviron main laayaa jaataa or vahaan band kamaron main jahrili gas chhodkar unhen maar daalaa jaataa
 Those who are not considered capable of working would be put to death, while most of the remaining Jews died of hunger and disease
 yuddh ke baad saamne aae dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki hitler kaa makasad duniya se ek-ek yahudee ko khatm kar dena tha
 During the six years of the war, the Nazis killed about six million Jews, including 1
5 million children
 yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke apane makasad ko hitler ne itane prabhavi dhang se anjaam diya ki duniya kii ek tihaai yahudee aabaadi khatm ho gai
 This massacre was unique in terms of number, management and execution

 is sawaal ke kai jawaab pesh kiye jate rahe hai : dharmik, aitihaasik, darshanik, manovaigyanik or marxvaadi

 aitihaasik jawaab kuch is tarah he- 1930 ke dashak main german jansankhya ke ek bade hisse ne ek aise samaaj main rahane kii rajamandi jataai, jo nafrat, jaateey shreshthata kii avadharana or hinsa par aadhaarit thi
 The central belief of the system they were tied to was that the Jewish people represent everything that is against the Germans and therefore the Jews should be exterminated
 yah dharna duniya ko dekhne ke ek nasli nazariye se bhi judi thi, jo germanon ko master res kaa hissaa maanati thi or yahudiyon ko vinaashkari bhautik gunon vaale anti res kaa
 When the geographical elimination of the Jews could not be possible, then they took the most radical route, which was the final solution
 itihaas main is tarah kii or bhi ghatnaayen milti hai, lekin holocost kii kuch baaten use vilakshan banaati hai
 Apart from Nazi Germany, many governments have resorted to camp systems and technology, and Jews have been murdered for much of history
 lekin do mukhya vajahon se holocost ko sabase alag kaha ja saktaa he
 1
 Apart from their policies towards other groups, the Nazis undertook to kill every Jew
 iske liye unhone umr, ling, aasthaa yaa kaam kii parvaah nahin kii
 He especially used a modern bureaucracy to accomplish this objective
 2
