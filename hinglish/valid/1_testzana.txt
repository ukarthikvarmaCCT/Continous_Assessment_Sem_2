DNAM Arjan Singh, ADM Bhaskar Soman bhartiya daawa Pakistani claim pakistani daawa' Indian claim 1965 kaa bharat-paak yuddh un muthbhedon kaa naam he jo donon deshon ke bich april 1965 se sitambar 1965 ke bich hui thi
 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi
 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar
 paanch maheene tak chalane vaale is yuddh main donon pakshon ke hajaaron log maare gayi
 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent
 is ladaai kaa adhikansh hissaa donon pakshon kii thal sena ne ladaa
 Before the Kargil War, there was never such a large military gathering in Kashmir
 yuddh main paidal or bakhtarband tukadiyon ne vayusena kii madad se anek abhiyaanon main hissaa liya
 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war
 bharat or pakistan ke 1947 main hue batwaare ke samay se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich kai muddo par tanatani chal rahi thi haalanki jammu or kashmir kaa mudda isame sabase bada tha par anya seemaa vivaad bhi the iname sabase pramukh kuccha kaa ran, jo ki ek banjar ilaaka he, ke batwaare par tha
 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch
 shuru main iname keval seemaa suraksha bal hi shaamil the par baad main dono deshon kii sena bhi yuddh main shaamil ho gayi 1 june 1965 main british pradhanmantri herold wilson ne dono paksho ke bich ladaai rukvaa kar is vivaad ko hal karne ke liye ek nishpaksh madhyasth nyaayalay kii sthapana kar di
 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa 3500 varg kilometre par tha
 
 kuccha ke ran main mili safalataa se utsahit pakistan ke rajanetaaon khaskar tatkaaleen videshmantri zulfikar ali bhutto ne rashtrpati or senadhyaksh general ayub khan par dabaav daalaa ki ve kashmir par hamale kaa aadesh de
 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time
 iske alaava bhutto or unke vichaar se sahamat anya generalo yahya khan or tikka khan kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki kashmir kii janata bharat se aaazaad hokar pakistan se vilay kii icchhuk he or sainiko ko ghuspaithiyon ke vesh main bhejne par unke samarthan main vidroh kar degi
 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed

 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly
 bhartiya atirikt tukadiya laane main safal ho gayi or bharat ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main 8 kilometre andar ghus kar haji pir darre par kabja kar liya
 With this occupation Pakistan came into being
 abhiyaan jibraltar ke ghuspaithiye sanikon kaa rasta bharatiyon ke kabje main aa gaya tha or abhiyaan vifal ho gaya
 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be
 ek din kii deree ke baavjood bharat ke pashchimi kaman ke sena pramukh yah jaanate the ki pakistan bahut behatar sthiti main he or usko rokane ke liye unhone yah prastaav tatkaaleen senadhyaksh general choudhary ko diya ki punjab seemaa main ek nayaa morcha khol kar lahore par hamalaa kar diya jaay
 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran
 icchhogil nahar bharat or pakistan kii vaastavik seemaa thi
 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away
 bharat ne pratinkraman main barki gaanv ke sameep nahar ko paar karne main safalataa arjeet kar lee
 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision
 ve turant hi seemaa paar karke icchhogil nahar pahuch gayi pakistani sena ne puliyaaon par raksha daste tainaat kar diye jin pulo ko bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha unako uda diya gaya pakistan ke is kadam se bhartiya sena kaa aage badhnaa ruk gaya
 The 3 Jats, a unit of the Jat Regiment, crossed the canal and captured Dograi and Batapore
 usee din pakistani sena ne bakhtarband ikai or vayusena kii madad se bhartiya sena kii 15ve khand par bada pratiakraman kiya haalaaki isse 3 jat ko maamuli nuksaan hi hua lekin 15ve khand ko peeche hatana padaa or uske rasad or hathiyaaro ke vahno ko kaaphi kshati pahuchi
 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill
 5 maratha kii madad ke liye bheje gayi 3 gurkha or 954 baari topakhana kaa dasta pakistani vaayu sena ke baari hamale ke kaaran pahuch nahin paaya or rasad le kar barmer se aa rahi tren bhi garda road rail adde ke paas hamale kaa shikaar ho gayi 10 sitambar ko munaabao par pakistan kaa kabja ho gaya
 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries
 bharat ke 1 bakhtarband khand jise bhartiya sena kii shaan kaha jaataa tha ne sialkot kii disha main hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat
 isse utsahit hokar pakistan kii sena ne bharatiyon par pratiakraman kar diya or bhartiya seemaa main aage ghus aayi
 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar
 unke anusaar amritsar ke baad jalandhar or phir raashtrapati ayub khan kii taraf se aaye bayaan ke anusaar dilli aglaa lakshya hota
 The Pakistani Army moved ahead of Khemkaran as India's fourth mountain division, 7 Mountain Brigade, 62 Mountain Brigade, Deccan Horse, equipped with Sherman tanks, stood for battle with their other division

 He lost 97 of his tanks, including 72 Patton tanks; In addition 32 tanks were captured in moving condition

 According to Air Commander Sajjad Haider, who led Pakistan's No

 Pakistan sources have denied claims of losing only one squadron of the Pakistan Air Force, stating that Pakistan had sought additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China within 10 days of the initial war

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded

 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena July 30 is the 211th day of the year according to the Gregory calendar

 Lobotomy was not considered by many psychiatrists to be any more painful than therapies such as insulin or cardiovascular shock; These procedures, conceived for the treatment of patients with severe mental illnesses, helped create the intellectual environment and medical and social frameworks, and a revolutionary and irreversible surgical procedure such as lobotomy became feasible and even a necessity
 
 In addition, Joel Braslow argues that from malarial therapies to further encephalitis, this organ progressively "takes central place as a source of disease and a treatment site", as well as somatic psychiatry, "inner brain parts" Came closer to "
 According to Roy Porter, these are often violent and four-tear psychiatric treatments, disambar 1888 main shalyakriya ke kam anubhav vaale ek manochiktsak gotlib burkhart ne manahshalyachikitsa ke kshetra main pehla praytn kiya tha jab unhone switzraland main ek nijee manorog chikitsaalay main 26 se 51 ke bich kii aayu ke, do mahila va chaar purush, chah rogiyon kii shalyakriya kii thi
 Their diagnoses varied, one with chronic mania, one with primary dementia and four with original paranoid patients, and, according to Burkhardt's case-note, they had severe psychiatric symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations, paranoid hallucinations, aggression, excitement, and Violence
 He performed surgery on the frontal, temporal and cerebellar segments of these patients
 The results were not very encouraging, as one patient died after experiencing epileptic seizures five days after surgery, one improved but he later committed suicide, the other two showed no change and the last two Became more "sad"

 The theoretical basis of Burkhart's action was three propositions
 pehla tha ki maansik beemaari kaa ek shaareerik aadhaar tha or vikrut man vikrut mastishkon ke pratibimb maatr the
 Next, is the federalist view of the neural function that envisioned the functioning of the nervous system according to the following dichotomous division of labor: an investment system, a combination system that processed information) and an output system
 Burkhart's ultimate belief was that the brain was modular, which meant that each mental standard or mental faculty could be associated with a specific place in the brain
 is tarah ke drushtikon ke anusaar, burkhart yah maanate the ki mastishk ke vishisht kshetra main ghaav vyavhaar ko vishisht tareeke se prabhavit kar sakate the
 In other words, they thought that by cutting off the combinatorial system or the second associative state of the brain's circulatory system, disturbing symptoms could be reduced without understanding with the nervous system's input or output systems

 isliye, unhone 1891 main likhaa: If arousal and impulsive behavior are due to the fact that abnormal stimuli in quality, quantity, and intensity arise on the sensory surface and act on the inductive surfaces, then correction can be achieved by creating a barrier between the two surfaces

 Writing in 1983, Kreplin sharply criticized Burkhart's efforts, stating that "he suggested that restless patients could be silenced by scratching the cortex of the brain
" " jabaki italvi tantrika manorog vigyaan ke professor gusape sepili ne 1891 main tippanee kii ki mastishk ke pramapiya hone kaa burkhart kaa drushtikon “adhiktar ke is drushtikon se, ki manoveekshipti pramastishkeey valkut kaa vyapak nidaan he, mail nahin khaataa or man ko ek ekaatmak ikai maanane kii avadharana ke viruddh he”

 In 1891, the British psychiatrist William Ireland, commenting on his monograph, presented a brief compilation of his position: dow burkhart ko is drushtikon par drudh vishwaas he ki man kai sankayon se mil kar bana he, jinke mastishk main apane-apane nishchit sthaan hai

 But Ireland was skeptical that an English psychiatrist would follow the "adventurous" path adopted by Burkhardt

 He later switched to technology using a surgical instrument called the lobotomy, which cut the brain tissue with a rotational inflexible wire loop
 Moniz and Lima performed surgeries of twenty patients between November 1935 and February 1936 and published their findings the same year

 Moniz believed that the brain would functionally adapt to this type of injury
 An important advantage of this approach was that, in contrast to the position adopted by Burkhardt, it was unverified by knowledge and technology of the time, as his thesis was not refuted in the absence of a known connection between macro-brain impairment and mental illness

 The device returned to normal and was sent two centimeters further into the brain before placing it on the 28 degree axis on both sides, cutting the white fibrous material connecting the cerebral cortex to the thalamus to cut outward and then inward

 After this he prayed to the child's mother to give this child to us
 ye sunakar krishna kii maan itnaa dar gai ki vah bachche ko ghar ke andar le kar chali gai
 He categorically refused to deliver the child
 jab krishna bada hua to uske saath ascharyajanak ghatnaayen hone lagi
 When Krishna b
 a
 i used to study even then a similar incident happened once
 It was night time
 krishna ne zamin pe bistar lagaaya hua tha
 The winter days were on and the weather was very cold
 krishna razaai odhe so rahaa tha, un dinon bijli to hua nahin karti thi
 So the room was completely dark
 tabhi uski razaai main ek saanp ghus gaya
 The snake climbed from his leg and went through the stomach to his neck
 But he could not bear the speed of his face
 vah uski gardan se dusre kandhe par hote hue waapas pair kii taraf jane laga
 At the same time, the child Krishna lost sleep
 usko laga kii ye kya chiz uske sharir par chal rahi he
 He picked it up and took it in his hand
 jab usne dekha kii ye to saanp he to usne saanp ko uthaakar khidki se baahar phenk diya
 The child Krishna was a brilliant student, he received his early education from Ambah
 par un dinon ambah main koi hai skool nahin tha
 So he had to come to Gwalior to study high school
 He passed the High School examination in 1944 from Gwalior
 hai skool karne ke baad uske baad uske mata pita kii ichha thi kii vah naukari kar le
 unke chachere bhai sanskrit ke praadhyaapak the, ek baar wo ambah aaye to krishna ko bhi apane saath ahmedabad le gaye
 Krishna Govind reluctantly went to work there
 par kismat ko to kuch or hi manzur tha
 He spent only one night in Ahmedabad
 vahi raat unki jindagi kii yaadgaar raat ban gai
 The bed they were given to sleep in was bedbug
 puri raat khatmal unhen katate rahe
 Now it can only be said that the poisonous creature like snake could not bear their speed, then how did the despised bedbugs bite them? Somehow he spent that night and left for home as soon as dawn
 naukari karne kaa vichaar unhone tyaag diya
 He returned home from Ahmedabad via train via Agra
 uske baad unhone ucch shiksha praapt karne kii sochi
 After coming home, Krishna was married
 unki patni shrimati revati devi saakshaat lakshmi or saraswati kaa rup thi
 He encouraged Krishna for higher education
 krishna aage kii padhai karne ke liye gwalior aa gaye
 While living in Gwalior, he completed his MA in Hindi
 uske baad b
ed
 kiya
 Money was needed to study higher education
 parantu unke paas itane zyada paise nahin the ki padhai ke kharche puure ho saken
 He returned home in 1951 after completing his studies
 un dinon ambah main shiksha ke haalat bahut karaab the
 There was no school there
 krishna ne vahaan skool shuru karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 unhone vahaan par ek hai skool kii sthapana kii
 In 1952, the first batch of this school passed the High School examination
 krishna padhai main to meghavi the hi, uname prabandhan kii bhi acchhee kshamta thi
 All the students of the first batch of his school passed with good numbers
 is skool ke menager shri ramanivas sharma the
 Krishna's relationship with Sharma was very good
 parantu kismat main to kuch or hi likhaa tha
 Legislative assembly elections were to be held in 1957
 ramanivas sharma ne bhi chunaav kaa tikat bharaa tha
 But Krishna and Ramnivas had different views about politics
 isliye krishna ne ramanivas ke badale dusre ummidavaar shukla ko samarthan diya
 Krishna also participated in Shukla's election campaign
 Ramnivas did not like this
 He gave a 'show cause' notice to Krishna as the manager of the school
 krishna ne kaha kii vot dena tathaa kisi ko saport karnaa vyaktigat maamla he
 And as a school manager, Ramnivas has no right to ask this
 inhi matbhedon ke chalate krishna ne san 1958 main skool se tyaagptr de diya
 But it turned out well
 is ghatana ne unke shiksha abhiyaan ko or bhi zyada tej kar diya
 He started the work of educating more and more children by opening more schools, he opened two new schools in Dharamgarh, District Morena
 After this, two new schools were also opened in Bhind district
 The number of their schools was increasing
 prabandhan main maahir krishna ke skool lagaataar tarakkee kiye ja rahe the
 The meritorious children of his school would go ahead and enroll in the big school
 He also opened a school in Pandri
 is tarah se das saal biit gaye
 Krishna's schools were constantly being promoted
 skool kaa parinaam hameshaa hi acha rahata tha
 Ramnivas had been watching his progress for a long time
 ek din ramanivas ne unhen milane ke liye bulaayaa
 When Krishna went to meet him, Ramnivas proposed to make him headmaster of his school
 krishna ko to sirf bacchon kii shiksha se hi matlab tha
 The management of that school was not good in those days
 bacchon ko bhi acchhee shiksha nahin di ja rahi thi
 So he accepted the offer
 lekin unhone shart rakhi kii wo aavedan nahin karenge
 He will accept this post only if he is appointed as Principal by consensus
 ramanivas tathaa skool trust ke anya sadasyon ne yah baat sweekaar kar lee
 In this way Krishna became the principal
 ek din krishna bazaar main kapade kii dukaan par baithe the
 Just then, Master Madhav Singh appeared to be going along very fast
 unhone poocha kii kya baat he? itani tej kahan bhaage ja rahe ho? madhav singh ne bataaya kii unke guru swami shri shivom tirth ji maharaj aae hue hai
 They were going to meet him
 krishna ne kaha kii hamen bhi unase milwa do
 Ram Niwas also took them along with you
 donon guruuji ke paas pahunche
 Krishna knew that Swamiji is a very perfect teacher of the Shaktipat tradition
 swamiji ke paas pahunchakar krishna ek kone main baith gaye
 Swamiji was reading something while sitting on a bed
 log vahaan aate, swamiji ke pair chhukar baith jate
 swamiji se thodi se baat karte or phir chale jate
 Krishna sat there for a long time
 jab sab chale gaye to swamiji phir padhne lage
 After a long time, Swamiji saw Krishna sitting there
 He asked why are you sitting here
 krishna ne kaha kii mujhe bhi "aapkaa anugrah chahie"
 swamiji swamiji thodi der tak krishna ko dhyaan se dekhte rahe
 Then said that talk to Madhav Singh
 It seems normal to see this incident, but no one knew what was hidden in the womb of this incident
 is saamaanya se ghatana ne anek logo kaa jivan badal kar rakh diya
 Krishna went to Madhav Singh and said that Swamiji has asked you to talk to him
 madhav singh samaj gaye ki swamiji ne diksha ke liye kaha he
 Madhav Singh made all the arrangements
 or san is tarah 1973 main krishna kii shaktipaat parampara main diksha ho gai
 After this, Krishna continued to run his school for 15 years and also used the means in the manner prescribed by Swamiji
 san 1986 main 63 varsh kii aayu main krishna seva nivruth ho gaye
 His Guru Swami Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj used to reside in the Yoga Sri Peeth Ashram situated in the holy land of Rishikesh
 krishna unase milane rishikesh aae
 Swamiji told him that you are a skilled manager
 main kuch samay ke liye devas ja rahaa hoon atah tum ashram kii kaary vyavastha sanbhal lo
 krishna ne swamiji ke aadesh kaa paalan kar ashram kii vyavastha dekhni shuru kar di
 After a while, Krishna started remembering the house
 vah swamiji ke aane kaa intjaar karne lage taaki unase ajna lekar ghar ja saken
 parantu swamiji do varshon tak nahin aae
 After two years, when Swamiji returned in 1988, he ordered Krishna to renounce the desire of home and take sannyasa
 Guru's command was paramount for Krishna
 unhone tunrat hi apni ghar jane kii ichha kaa tyaag karke sanyas le liya
 On June 13, 1988, on the occasion of Ganga Dussehra, the process of renunciation of Krishna was completed
 yah din ek mahaan parivartan kaa din tha
 According to Hindu tradition, the name changes after renunciation
 so, krishna kaa naam badal kar ab swami govindanand tirth maharaj ho gaya
 For Swami Govindananda Tirtha Maharaj, this was not just a change of name
 unki soch, kriya kalap sab kuch badal gaya
 Now, most of his time was spent doing resources and maintaining the ashram
 sanyas ke samay hi swami shivom tirth ji maharaj ne unhen mantra diksha pradaan karne kii shakti bhi de di thi
 In 1992, he also got permission from Maharaj Ji to give Shaktipat initiation
 tab se aaj tak swamiji rishikesh sthit yoga shri peeth ashram main virajman hai
 Swamiji changed his life by giving initiation of Shaktipat to many disciples
 virendra upaadhyaay ne ek pustak likhi kii he - "shri govindamratbhajan bhagirathi"
 yah pustak swamiji ko samarpit he
 The author of the book says that he has completed this book only with the blessings of Swamiji
