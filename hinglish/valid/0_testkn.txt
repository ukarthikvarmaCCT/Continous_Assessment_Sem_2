 Only after exorcising the Greeks, there was a question of removing the remaining parts from the British
 desh unke saath tha, iske atirikt britain ab ladane ke liye bilkul taiyaar nahin tha
 For this reason this problem was also solved
 kamaal ne desh ko prajatantra ghoshit kiya or swayan pratham raashtrapati bane
 Now the state was almost dead, but there was constant opposition from the Mullahs
 isapar kamaal ne sarkari akhabaaron main islam ke viruddh prachaar shuru kiya
 Now the religious leaders have issued fatwa against them and started saying that Kamal has propagated modern dance in the country by taking women out of the curtains in Angora, in which men dance with women, it should end
 har masjid se yah aawaaj uthaayi gayi
 Then Kamal ended the Khilafat system in March 1924 and introduced a bill in Parliament declaring Turkey as a secular nation
 adhikansh sansad sadasyon ne iskaa virodh kiya, par kamaal ne unhen kasake dhamkaaya
 His threat was strongly affected and the bill was passed
 par bheetar-bheetar mullaon ke vidroh kii aag baraab sulagati rahi
 Many of Kamal's former friends were reunited with the mullahs
 in logon ne videshi poonjipatiyon se dhan bhi liya tha
 Kamal arrested his main leaders and hanged him one day
 kamaal ne dekha ki keval phaansi par chadhaane se kaam nahin chalegaa, desh ko aadhunik rup se shikshit karnaa he tathaa puraane reeti rivaajon ko hi nahin, pahanaave aadi ko bhi samaapt karnaa he
 Kamal made his first attack on the Turkish cap
 is par vidroh hue, par kamaal ne sena bhej di
 After this, they removed Islamic laws and replaced them with a new code which included all the good things of Switzerland, Germany and Italy
 bahu-vivaah gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Along with this, husbands were told not to treat their wives like drums and to treat them equally
 prayek vyakti ko vot kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Bribes were prohibited in services and severe bribes were given to bribes
 striyon ke pahanaave se pardaa uthaa diya gaya or purush puraane dhang ke pariched chhodkar suut pahanane lage
 An even greater improvement was that the Roman script was replaced by the Arabic script
 kamaal swayan sadakon par jaakar roman varna-maala main turki bhashaa padhaate rahe
 As a result, the whole of Turkey became united and the feeling of isolation ended
 iske saath hi kamaal ne turki sena ko atyant aadhunik dhang se sangathit kiya
 Thus the Ottoman caste became the modern caste due to Kamal Pasha
 san 1938 ke navambar maas kii 10 taarikh ko mustafaa kamaal ataturk kii mrityu hui tab tak aadhunik turki ke nirmaataa ke rup main unka naam sansar main suraj kii tarah chamak chukaa tha
 Although Kamal Pasha had four love affairs with four women in his life, but he married only Latifi Ussaki
 yadhyapi usase kamaal ko koi santaan nahin hui or vah nissantan hi mar gayi
 After Bibi's death, Mustafa Kamal Pasha never married
 jivan ke ekaakipan ko dur karne ke liye usne teraa anaath bacchon ko god liya or unki behatar dhang se parvarish kii

 pracheen sanskrit granthon main 'uttari bharat' ko aryaavart kaha gaya he
 In the Rigveda, the abode of the Aryans is designated as "saptasindhu" region
 rugveda ke nadisukt main aryanivas main pravaahit honevaali nadiyon kaa ekatra varnan he jisamen mukhya ye hai - kubha, crugu, gomti, sindhu, parushni, shutudri, vitasta, saraswati, yamuna tathaa ganga
 This description can be considered as the director of the boundary of the abode of Vedic Aryans
 brahman granthon main kuru paanchal desh arya samskruti kaa centre mana gaya he jahaan anek yajyayagon ke vidhaan se yah bhubhag "prajapati kii naabhi" kaha jaataa tha
 The Shatapatha Brahmin says that the language of Kuru Panchal is the best and authentic
 upanishdkaal main aryasabhyataa kii pragati kaashi tathaa videh janapadon tak faili
 As a result, the vast tract of land from Punjab to Mithila was considered to be the holy abode of the Aryans in the Upanishads
 dharmasutron main aryaavart kii seemaa ne vishay main bada matbhed he
 This famous range of Aryavarta has been set in the Vashisthadharmasutra that it is east of Adarsh, west of Kalk forest, Pariyatra and north of Vindhya and south of Himalayas
 anya do maton kaa bhi yahaan ullekh he ki aryaavart ganga or yamuna ke bich kaa bhubhag he or usamen krishna mrug nirbaadh sancharan karata he
 Boudhayan, Patanjali and Manu have also accepted the Vashisthakta opinion as authentic
 manu kii drushti main aryaavart madhyadesh se bilkul miltaa he or uske bheetar "brahmavart" naamak ek chota, parantu pavithratam bhubhag he, jo saraswati or drushadwati nadiyon dwaara simit he or yahaan kaa paramparaagat aachaar sadachaar mana jaataa he
 Aryavarta had this authentic boundary and the countries outside it were considered to be the country of Mlechcha, where it was necessary to perform Ishthi or rites in addition to pilgrimage
 boudhayandharmasutra main avanti, ang, magadh, suraashtra, dakshinapath, upaavri, sindhu-sauveer aadi desh mlechh deshon main ginaae gaye hai
 But the culture and civilization of the Aryans spread to other countries due to the religious zeal of the Brahmins, who do not believe the part of Aryavarta would be an act of truth
 medhatithi kaa is vishay main mat bada hi yuktipurna prathit hota he
 He says that "" The country in which the virtuous Kshatriya king conquers the Mlechchas and honors the Chaturvarnya and arranges the Mlchchas like the Chandalas of Aryavarta, that country is also a suitable place for Yajna, because the earth is not automatically polluted, but unholy Is corrupted only by the connection of ""
 aise vijit mlecchon deshon ko bhi medhatithi aryaavart ke antargat maanane ke pakshpaati hai
 This demand for progress of culture cannot be turned down

 chithran or murtikla main to yah aadhuniktam style or takanic hai
 Chiriko, pulses, moro, arp, breton, masan etc
 are prominent among its campaigners and artists
 kala main is sristi kaa darshanik nirupan 1924 main andre breton ne apni atiyathartwaadee ghoshnaa main kiya
 Surrealism is the latest genre of art, in addition to social realism, and here, influenced by the progress of psychology, has become popular
 atiyatharthwaad kaa siddhant iske pravartakon dwaara is prakaar abhivyakt huah atiyatharth yatharth se, drishy-shravy-jagat se pare hai
 This is the absolute reality that lies in the subconscious; In the dormant, sleepy, dreamy state, as the imaginative, unimaginable, unexpected sensations, spontaneously impulses climb the screen of the mind
 jo vishay athwa drishy saadharantah tarktah paraspar asambaddha lagate hai vastav main unamem alakshith sambandh he jise maatr atiyatharthwaad prakashit kar saktaa he
 Surrealists pledge that the origin of all our actions is subconscious difference
 vahi hamaare kaaryon ko gati or disha bhi detaa he or us udgam se prasphutit hone vaale manobhaavon ko drushtigamy, sthool, rassikt akruti di ja sakati he
 The symbols and values of surrealism are completely different from the dimensions of everyday life, the realizations
 atiyathartwaadiyon kii abhiruchi alokik, adbhut, akalpit or asangat sthitiyon kii abhivyakti main he
 It is not that that subconscious has not existed before in literature or art
 pariyon kii kahaniyaan, asaadhaaran kii kalpana, jaise elice in da vanderland athwa sindbaad kii kahaniyaan, bacchon athwa ardhvikshipt vyaktiyon ke chitrankan sahitya or kala donon kshetron main atiyatharthwaad kii ikaiyaan prastut karte hai
 Surrealists establish that we can enter the world of real ultimate reality by penetrating the earthly visible world, transcending its factual reality
 ankan ko akritiyon ke pratinidhaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin, use jivan ke gahan tatwon ko samajhnaa or samajhaana he, jivan ke prati maanav pratikriyaaon kaa akalan karnaa he or ye tathy nihsandeh drishy jagat ke pare ke hai
 It is unfair to consider marking as a means of entertainment or enjoyment
 sthool netron kii seemayen or pratyaksh kii riktata to ghanvaadee kala ne hi pramanit kar di thi, isse aavashyaktaa prathit hui drushti se ateet paroksh se saakshaatkaar kii, jo avchetan he, yuktisangat yatharth ke pare kaa ayuktiyukt atiyatharth
 Thus Surrealism highlights the gaps in the psyche, the sublime sublimes of subconsciousness
 ghanavaad se bhi ek pag aage dadawad gaya or dadawad se bhi aage atiyatharthwaad
 Surrealism has its roots in the land of Dadaism
 swayan dadawad ne kriyaatmak kalpana kii bhoomi chhod nirbandh avchetan kii aradhana kii thi, ab uske uttarvarti atiyatharthwaad ne avchetan or drishy jagat ko paraspar sarvatha swatantra or pruthak mana
 There is no relation to his idea of human consciousness and earthly reality or physical experience
 unhone atmadhyayan, jivan ke param tathy kii khoj or drishy se bhinn ek antarjagat kii pahchaan ko apana lakshya banaaya
 He said that on a conflict that is intended to be broadly targeted within the celestial completeness, virtually favorable facts, such as life and death, past and future, truth and fantasy have to be collected
 atiyathartwaadee ghoshnaakar andre breton ne likhaah meraa vishwaas he ki bhavishya main donon paraspar virdohi lagane vaali swapn or satya kii sthitiyaan param yatharth, atiyatharth main lay ho jaayengi
 In the progress of illustration, Surrealism trumped the traditional style of art
 uske akalan or abhipraayon ne, chitradarshon ne sarvatha nayaa mode liya, parvarti se antarvarti kii ore
 He considered the dreamy conditions of the subconscious, even to the wistful state, as a free form of pure wisdom
 saadharantah atiyatharthwaad ke do bhed kiye jate hai: swapnabhivyakti or aavegankan
 Among them is Salvador Dali, a distinguished artist of the first genre, and Joan Meiro of the second
 donon spain ke hai
 Surrealist worshipers of the subconscious should not be considered as too shallow in terms of raga and line in the field of assessment
 yah sahi he ki abhipraay athwa ankit vishay ke sambandh main atiyatharthwaad apratyaashit kaa akalan karata he, par jahaan tak ankan kii takanic kii baat he uske aayam-parinaam sarvatha sanyat, spasht or shramsiddh hote hai
 The paintings of Dali then compete with the art of Dutch paintings in this direction
 apratyaashit yatharth kaa udhaaharan aise chitra se diya ja saktaa he jiskaa sara vaataavaran to chikitsaalay ke shalyakaksh kaa ho par aaparishan kii mej par, jahaan marij ke hone kii aashaa kii ja sakati he, vahaan vastutah chitrit hoti he silaai kii mashin

 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya
 In 1361 AD, Feroze attacked Nagarkot
 yahan ke jambabaniyon se ladati hui sultan kii sena lagbhag 6 maheene tak ran ke registan main fasi rahi, kaalaantar main jambabaniyon ne sultan kii adheenta ko sweekaar kar liya or vaarshik kar dene ke liye sahamat ho gayi
 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye

 The foundation of Jaunpur city was laid by Firoz in memory of his cousin 'fakhruddin Jauna'
 uske shashan kaal main khijrabad evam meerut se ashok ke do stambhalekhon ko laakar dilli main sthapit kiya gaya
 Under his welfare works, Firoz set up an employment office and a new department called diwan-e-khairat to help Muslim orphans, widows and girls
 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center
 daason ko nakad vetan yaa bhukhand die gayi
 Slaves were also given handcraft training
 sainya vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne sainikon punah jaagir ke rup main vetan dena prarambh kar diya
 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check
 khums kaa 4 / 5 bhaag phir se sainikon ko dene ke aadesh die gayi
 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin
 'valaile-firozshahi' ayurveda se sambandhit granth tha
 He invented the water clock
 firoz kaal main khan-i-jahaan telgani ke makbara kii tulana jerusalem main nirmit umr ke maszid se kii jaati he
 Sultan Firoz Tughlaq built Kotla Feroz Shah Durg in Delhi
 apane bhai jona khaan kii smriti main jonpur naamak shahar basaaya
 Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq himself encouraged bribery in the administration
 afif ke anusaar-sultan ne ek ghudsavaar ko apane khazaane se ek taka diya, taaki vah rishwat dekar arj main apane ghode ko paas karvaa saken
 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 Henry Elliot and Elphinstone have called Firuz Tughlaq "akbar of the Sultanate era"
 firozshah tululaq kii safaltaaon kaa shrey uske pradhanmantri 'khan-e-jahaan makabool' kaa diya jaataa he
 Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq died in September 1388 AD

 Ozone depletion or ozone depletion describes two distinct but related observations; Since the 1970s, there has been a slow but steady decrease in the total amount of ozone in the Earth's stratosphere by about four percent per decade; and there is a greater but seasonal decrease in the ozone of the stratosphere over the Earth's polar regions during the same period is

 The ozone molecule absorbs UV light between 310 and 200 nm, causing the ozone to split into an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule
 ab oxigen parmaanu oxigen anu ke saath sanyojit hokar fir se ozon anu banaata he
 This is a continuous process that ends when an oxygen atom "recombines" with an ozone molecule to form two O2 molecules
 o + O3 → 2 O2 The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination

 All of these have both natural and synthetic sources; at the present time, the majority of OH and NO
 It has a natural origin in the stratosphere, but human activity has resulted in dramatically higher increases in oxygen chlorine and bromine

 Schwah deletion is a response in which it is necessary to discard the sound of shwa contained in the consonants of their scripts for correct pronunciation in Hindi, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Maithili and many other modern indo-aryan languages
 yah vilopan karnaa un bhashaaon ke maatrubhaashiyon ke dwaara samajhe jane ke liye or bolne vaale kaa lahaza sahi prathit hone ke liye bahut zaruri he
 Without this autopsy, the reader either seems unambiguously non-lingual or may have difficulty understanding it
 shwa vilopan computer dwaara likhit samagri ko padhane main or bhashaaon ko seekhney waalon ke liye chunauti hoti he kyonki in bhashaaon kii lipiyaan aksar yah spasht nahin karti ki shwa kahan rakhana chahie or kahan tyaagna chahie
 The Devanagari script is used to write modern Hindi, in which the sound of 'A' is added if there is no halant formally at the end of each consonant
 lekin hindi ke sahi uccharan ke liye hindi kaa 'shwa vilopan niyam' kahata he ki shabdon ke ant main or kuch or paristhitiyon main aksar yah shwa hataa diya jaataa he
 It is sometimes written as: 'a -> ø | Vowel consonant _vision vowel '
 iskaa arth he ki agar lipi ke anusaar kisi swar ke uparant aane vaale vyanjan ke baad shwa aata he or uske baad ek vyanjan aata he jiske peeche bhi ek swar laga ho, to us bich ke shwa ko tyaag diya jaataa he
 For example, if you look at the word 'dragon', it is 'A + j + a + g + a + r + A' but at the end of the word 'A' and between 'A + J' and 'G + A'
 a 'both are removed, due to which the correct Hindi pronunciation of the word' Ajgar 'is' Azgar'
 aksar yah baat angreji main lipyaantaran karne main spasht ho jaati he
 If we look at the city of Patna, according to the script it is 'p + a + t + a + n + a', which will be written 'patanā' in English
 lekin shwa vilopan niyam bich kaa shwa hataa detaa he, isliye vastav main sahi uccharan 'p+a+t+n+aa' he, yani 'pat
nā'
 Similarly 'uttar Pradesh' should be 'uttara pradesha' if it is seen as per formal script, but due to Schwah elimination it becomes 'uttar pradesh'
 dhyaan dijiye ki shwa vilopan ke kaaran kuch aksharon ke guton kaa uccharan unki shabd main paristhiti ke anusaar badal jaataa he
 The pronunciation of 'saral' is 'S + a + o + a + L', in which the ending is deleted
 lekin 'sarala' main niyamanusaar bich ke 'r' kaa 'a' hataa diya jaataa he, yani 's+a+r+l' 
 Similarly, in 'spinach' and 'palanquin', the middle 'L' is placed first but removed from the second word
 usee tarah 'dil kii dhadkane' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadkane' he, yani 'd' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 But in 'dil Dhadak Laga' the correct pronunciation of 'dhadakne' is 'dhadakne', ie this time the breath of 'D' was kept but the body of 'A' was removed
 hindi ke maatrubhaashi in shabdon ko bina soche aaraam se sahi uccharit karte hai, lekin gair-matibhashiyon or computaron ke liye yah kathinaayee paidaa karte hai
 Often their wrong pronunciation makes their speech 'strange' and 'hard to understand for the hearer'
