 But the king still wanted to avoid war, so he went to meet the Northern Superintendent with his 1500 armed men
 veeraa verma raja ko bhi upasthit hone kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 Pazhassi Raja's main demand was that his rule over Kottayam be accepted, but his uncle was not ready to accept this demand

 As the negotiations broke down, the commissioners announced a threat in Kottayam that those in Kottayam who were in the king's service did not leave the king and return to their homes, declaring them enemies and seizing their property
 But this declaration had no effect on Kottayam and strengthened resistance against british-kurumbranad rule there

 The king then visited Karkanakotta in 1796 to meet the Commandant of Mysore and also in 1797 met the old enemy Tipu in Mysore, who deployed his 6000 men to Karkankotta to help the king deal with the situation of war
 Gave and also supplied ammunition to the rebels

 In early 1797, the Nair warriors rose up all over Kottayam and British posts were laid siege
 samarthak dal puure kottayam main sakriy ho uthe or sainik sahaayta or aapurti dalon ko pareshaan kiya jane laga
 The same situation was also in Wayanad, where the British soldiers would have to face the Kurichia archers as soon as they came out of their safe accommodation
 Due to these raids, the British suffered heavy losses in terms of soldiers, ammunition and stores
 puure yuddh main yah ghatana sabase mahatvapurn rahi
 In 1797, Colonel Dow and his army marched into Wayanad
 uski yojana thi ki periya ghati ko avaruddh jaay or jab vaapasi kaa rasta band ho jaay tab kannoth main badi vidrohi sena ko kuchal diya jaay
 a military squad under Lieutenant Meali was sent to Peria to help Dow, but on the way the Nairs and Kurichias inflicted heavy losses on them and 105 British men were killed
 so, periya jane ke bajaay ve apane mul aadhaar ko laut gayi
 Dow's troops faced a huge supply shortage and Dow again pleaded for assistance
 The supply assistance was then sent again under Major Anderson of the Bombay Regiment
 lekin anderson ke mappila maargdarshakon ne aakhri samay par uskaa saath chhod diya
 The delay in Anderson's visit proved fatal to the British
 dov ko khabar mili ki tipu ne raja kii sahaayta ke liye apane sipaahiyon ko bheja he, kyonki tipu kaa maananaa tha ki vynad main angrejon kaa pravesh seringapatom sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 Dow decided that he would go to Talassery to consult the authorities and plan to deal with Raja and Tipu together in Wayanad
 He marched with a small group, but was attacked by the Raja's men with the help of the Mysorean soldiers on the way, but the Dow escaped unscathed

 But he did not know that the king, who knew the real situation of the British, laid a trap for him - he ordered his army to hide in the camouflage enclosures built on both sides of the valley
 jaise hi puri british sena ne sankeern ghati main pravesh kiya, chhipe hue sainikon ne us par hamalaa bol diya
 The plan was implemented correctly and after that a large number of British forces were killed

 Most of the enemies were killed and all their guns, ammunition, luggage and cattle were looted along with their flags

 Around this time, the commissioners decided to seek the advice of a Tamil Brahmin minister from Zamorin, and this was where the Pazhassi king's eventual downfall began
 unhone sthaneey gaddaaron kii ek aniyamit sena banaakar pazhassi raja ko pareshaan karne kaa faisla kiya
 The leader of this army was the infamous Kolkar, who can be called the Malabar version of the Turkish Bashi-bazuk, who was notorious for the brazenness of the British and the brutal atrocities on the resisters and the public

 In the wake of this British catastrophe, the Bombay Government sent a government committee of top officials such as commander-in-chief General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan
 They decided to establish peace because they were restless that a guerrilla war could go on long in the mountains and wooded areas and befriended the king Tipu or the French
 unhone raja kurumbranad ko kottayam prashasan se bedagal karne kaa bhifaisla kiya
 The kings of Chirakkal and Parappanad mediated between the king and the British and in 1797 a treaty was reached between Pazhassi and the British

 Peace was established after four years of hostility and war
 tipu ke patan ke baad, vynad angrejon ke haath aa gaya
 The British sent forces from Mysore to occupy Wayanad and planned to merge it with Canara or Coimbatore
 lekin jaisaa ki vynad kottayam raja kaa ek paaramparik adhikaar tha or 1793 se pazhassi kaa is kshetra par niyantran rahaa tha, isiilie pazhassi ne ise desh ke pracheen praant par kabja jamaane kii karrwai ke rup main thik hi dekha

 The British government in Madras appointed Major General Arthur as the British Army Commandant for Mysore, Canara and Malabar
 usne malabar tat or mysore se vynad main ek do aiami chaal kii yojana banaai or or uske liye taiyaari shuru kii
 The king was watching the tricks of the Major General; The general asked for help and got the road constructed in Wayanad and made checkpoints in the rebel country
 In response, the king also recruited many people, making Wellesley so afraid that he even wanted to kidnap the family of the rebels to investigate the king's recruitment drive
 raja ko pataa chalaa ki ek sainya mishan ke liye welsli deccan ko gaya he; tab raja ne sochaa ki major general kii anupasthiti main teji se apni karrwai karne kaa yah sunaharaa mauqaa he

 By the monsoon of the 1800s, the rebels who controlled rural areas of Kottayam became a threat to the British outposts in Kottayam
 kottayam main baagiyon ke gadhon par phir se kabja karne ke liye welsli ne karnal sartorius ke adheen ek sena bheji
 lekin malabar main paryaapt sainik nahin hone kii vajah se yah yojana lagu nahin kii ja saki
 Wellesley advised to block all communications from Wayanad to starve the king without supplies
 lekin sainikon kii kami se yah yojana bhi kagaz par dhari rah gayi
 At the time, Wellesley decided to take a two-sided action against the king on behalf of the Malabar coast and Mysore, an Ernad Mappila leader Athan Gurikkal and his supporters agreed to join the king
 1801 tak, puure kottayam or vynad main 10,000 se adhik kii british sena ikatthi hui or unhone vynad tathaa malabar ko jodne vaale sabhi raaston ko avaruddh kar diya
 Seeing such a large number, the rebels saw only being sensible in going underground for some time
 The king also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in southern Wayanad and southern Malabar
 raja jangalon main bhatakate rahe, lekin phir bhi unhone koi samjhaute se inkaar kar diya, yah angrejo ke liye hairaani kii baat thi, kyoki raja jaan chuke the ki puri swatantraaa ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 The king also had six close associates and 25 armed soldiers with him in this nomadic life

 But the British were looking for him, but could not succeed in catching him
 uske baad raja ne kottayam sthit apane gupt thikaanon kaa daura kiya or phir kadathanad or kurumbranad ke jangalon main chale gaye
 The British were enraged that wherever they went, they would secretly get the support of noblemen; Then the British decided to punish those who helped the rebel king
 aatank failaane ke bhaag ke rup main peruvayal nambiar ko giraftaar karke faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The British also threatened that the rebels who did not surrender within six weeks would be given cruel punishment and their property would be confiscated
 But forgiveness of surrendered rebels was also announced
 lekin ye dhamkiyaan or laalach kisi kaam nahin aaye or raja tab bhi mukt rahe
 But some of his prominent supporters were arrested, including the very famous Kannoth Nambiar
 kannoth nambiar or unke bete ko bhi faansee par lataka diya gaya or unki sampatti jabt kar lee gayi
 After the assassination of Kannoth Nambiar, cremation peace prevailed in northern Malabar, the peace before the storm
 colector major mcclod ne sochaa ki yuddh samaapt ho chukaa he or vah apane shoshan kaarykram main jute gaya
 He immediately announced complete disarmament in Malabar and threatened that anyone with arms would be given the death penalty
 He also doubled the tax rate and ordered a revaluation of the tax throughout Malabar within just forty days
 jab malabar vidroh kii kagaar par tha or aam janata ke paas sangharsh ke alaava or koi rasta nahin bachaa, tab 1803 main ye sabhi 'sudhaar' kaarykram munh ke bal gir pade
 mcclod ne sudharatmak upaay ke jariye shant karne kaa prayaas kiya, usne sabhi 'sudhaaron' ko radd kar diya or puraani pranali ko phir se sthapit kiya
 But by then it was too late, because the king's people had prepared for the rebellion
 panamaaram kile par kabja pehali badi ghatana thi
 Edachenakungan Nair planned the expedition and was helped by 150 Kurichia archers under Talakkal Chandu
 kile main captain dikenson ke adheen 70 sainik the or vahaan se kuch mile kii duuri par pulinjali main major drumond ke maatahat 360 sainikon kii ek badi fuj thi
 Had the Major come under the captain's help at the right time, the Kurichia army would have been defeated on the strength of guns and numbers
 But Kungan and Chandu decide to take the risk
 do senapatiyon ke netritv main hue is achaanak hamale main puri sena maar daali gayi, jabaki is ore ke sirf 5 log maare gayi or 10 ghayal hue
 dikenson bhi maaraa gaya
 The rebels received 112 guns, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees
 unhone puure kile ko nasht kar diya
 Wellesley was very angry at this rebellion and he sent 500 soldiers to retaliate
 But by then, the victory of the rebels woke up the entire Wayanad and Kottayam
 The hero of Panamaram's success, Edachena Kungan, went to Pulpalli shrine and called upon the people to join the king's war, 3000 people volunteered as a result
 He was posted at Valliyurkav and Adappally of the Manthavadi and under Kungan's brother 100 of them in the Periya Valley and 25 in the Kottiyur Valley
 baagi chaukiyon ko dindimal se valliurkav tak ke raaston main sthapit kiya gaya
 The rebel army had mostly archers and swordsmen, but some also had guns
 adachena kungan nambiar ne mysore se mananthavadi kii ore bad rahe ek british sena kii tukdi par ek hamale kaa netritv kiya
 The attacks started after the army entered Wayanad and reached a river between the Manthavadi and Bhavulli
 There, their path was blocked by a moat created by the rebel army on the opposite side of the river
 lekin vidrohiyon kii badakismati kii vajah se ek sahaayta tukdi ke aa jane se british sena ne vidrohiyon kii gheraabandi ko tod diya or anek logon ko bandi bana liya gaya
 All these prisoners were disarmed and they were killed after marching on a road
 iske alaava, sabhi dishaao se vynad main british sahaayta pahunch gayi
 But the British could not find the rebels anywhere
 vidrohi ab kottayam main jamaa ho gayi the
 In 1802, he raided a supply convoy near Kottiyur
 The people of Kottayam were in complete frustration with the British
 unki pareshaani ko badhaate hue, 1803 main, ek vidrohi sena kurumbranad* or payyormala* main tainaat kii gayi or logon ko vidrohiyon se sahanubhuti thi
 Kungan proceeded towards Pazhassi to destroy the British outpost, but had to retreat due to the killing of many soldiers
 But the rebellion spread in Chirakkal where teams of armed supporters started operations and these parties often openly fought the British
 1803 ke ant tak raja kii sena kannur or talasseri tak fail gayi
 In March 1803, a rebel army reached Calicut and captured the sub-jail and killed all the guards there and confiscated their weapons and ammunition
 unhone kaidiyon ko bhi mukt kiya, jinamein se kai vidrohi sena main shaamil ho gaye
 This was too much for mcleod, so he resigned immediately after the incident
 1803 main, pazhassi raja ke saath teen saal ke anirnit yuddh ke baad welsli europe chalaa gaya, baad main wellington kaa duk bana or waterlu main nepolian kaa vijeta bhi bana
 In 1804, a large British force arrived and 1200 Kolkars were also ready for action
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah ki ek dhoort thomas harvey baber ko up-colector niyukt kiya gaya tha
 This crushed Pazhassi's rebellion forever
 yah sachmuch hairaani kii baat he ki jo kaam welsli jaisaa sainya praveen nahin kar paaya, use baber ne kar diya, jo ki mahaj ek 'civil sarvent' tha
 He had a personal goal to avenge the death of his wife Helen Somerville's first husband and his friend Donald Cameron; Cameron was killed by Pazhassi Raja on January 9, 1797, in the Periya Valley
 baber bombai sthit english or mani pariwaron, jo uske sasurali rishtedaar the or vyapaariyon ke prabhaavshaalee samooh ke hiton kii raksha ke liye civil sarvent bana tha
 It is notable that Baber's son Henry Phere Baber married George Harris, granddaughter of the first feudatory of Srirangapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan
 1804 main, kalyaat nambiar or adhikanshtah purvi chirkkal ke jangalon main raja ke logon ke netritv main ek bade vidroh ko angrajon dwaara kuchal diya gaya
 If there had been a big and long-running rebel war in Chirakkal, the king would have benefited a lot
 haalanki chirkkal main raja ke bahut saare samarthak the, isliye vidroh kii vifaltaa ke baad baagiyon ne chhapamar yuddh main samay ganvaane ke bajaay khulaa yuddh shuru kiya
 Another reason for the failure of the rebellion was the treacherous Kolkar also served his white money lords
 to ek baar phir vidrohi sena vynad kii ore peeche laut gayi
 The British followed them with great vigor, with 2000 soldiers and 1000 kolkars
 raja ke liye 3000 pagoda, adachena kungan ke liye 1000 pagoda ke inaam kaa elaan hua or raja ke das sahyogiyon ke liye bhi inaam ghoshit kiye gayi
 But the revolutionaries, mostly Kurumbas, attacked at Churikunji in Wayanad
 haalanki unhen peeche hatana padaa, lekin unhone apane dushman tabah kar diya tha
 That year, a team of Kolkar almost caught Raja, but he survived a timely warning by a Kurumba guard
 lekin monsoon or vynad kii krur jalwaayu ne jald hi raja kii sahaayta kii
 As of October, only 170 out of 1300 kolkars remained ill
 raja or adachena kungan ne pulapalli tirth main kurichia or kurumba kii ek badi sena sangathit kii or unhen kurichiyaat tak tainaat kar diya
 Apart from this, Kungan's attempt to include the Nair nobles of Wayanad in the king's war effort was successful
 pichley kuch varshon se angrejon ko 1797 main periya ke paimaane kaa nuksaan nahin hua tha, lekin angrejon ke liye maamla itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 Even Kottayam once again became explosive and Raja, the leader of the revolutionaries, was still free
 lekin yaad rakhana chahie ki puri kranti ek vyakti par aadhaarit thi, jaisaa ki ek baar welsli ne kaha tha ki "humlog 1000 logon se nahin lard rahe hai

 The British themselves admitted that they did not really get more informants because the locals were devoted to the king, but a few of those informants proved disastrous for the revolution; One of them Chetty finds out where the king's camp is and informs Baber, who has deployed 100 kolkars and 50 soldiers

 By 1805, the British had to employ 15,000 soldiers to fight the small army of the king

 arabi: علي ابن أبي طالب Ali Ibne Abi Talib was born on 17 March under the Kaaba, a pilgrimage site for 600 Muslims
 ve paigambar mohammad ke chachazad bhai or damaad the or unka charchit naam hazarat ali he
 They are known as the Khalifa of Muslims
 unhone 656 se 661 tak rashidoon kilaafat ke chauthe caliph ke rup main shashan kiya, or shiya islam ke anusaar ve632 to 661 tak pehle imam the
 Apart from this, he is also considered the first Muslim scientist
 unhone vaigyanik jaankariyon ko bahut hi rochak dhang se aam aadmi tak pahunchaaya tha
 Born to Abu Talib and Fatima bin Assad, Ali is the only person born in the holy sanctuary of the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest place in Islam, according to many classical Islamic
 strot, vishesh rup se shiya vaale
 Ali was the first male to accept Islam, and according to some authors was the first Muslim
 ali ne mohammad ko shuruaati umr se sangrakshit kiya or navjaat muslim samudaay dwaara ladi lagbhag sabhi ladaai main hissaa liya
 After moving to Medina, she married Muhammad's daughter Fatima
 khalif uthman ebn afaan kii hatya ke baad, 656 main mohammad ke saathi ne unhen khalipha niyukt kiya tha
 Ali's reign led to civil wars and in 661, he was attacked and murdered by the Kharijites while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, two days later martyred
 raajnneetik or aadhyatmik rup se shiya or sunni donon ke liye ali mahatvapurn he
 Many biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, who was a ruler because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah
 jabaki sunise ali ko rashidun khalif ke chauthe or final par vichaar karte hai, shiya musalamaanon ne ali ko gadir khum main ghatnaon kii vyakhya ke kaaran mohammad ke baad pehali imam ke rup main mana
 Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and other Shia are members of the Imam) are the rightful heirs to Muhammad
 yah asahmati thi ki umah ko shiya or sunni shakhaon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha
 Ali's father, Abu Talib, was the patron of the Kaaba of Banu Hashim, an important branch of the powerful Qureshi tribe and was a sheikh
 vah mohammad kaa chachaa bhi tha, or abdul mutalib ke baad mohammad uthaaya tha
 Ali's mother Fatimah bin Assad also belonged to Banu Hashim, from which Ali Ibahim was a descendant of Ibrahim's son
 kai strot, khaskar shii, yah pramanit karte hai ki ali makka shahar main kaaba ke andar paidaa hua tha, jahaan vah teen dinon tak apni maa ke saath rahaa
 While visiting Kaaba his mother felt the onset of his labor pains and entered where his son was born
 kuch shiya sroton main ali kii maa ke pravesh ke chamatkaari vivaran kaaba main hai
 Ali's birth in the Kaaba is believed to be a unique event proving his "high spiritual station" among Shias, while among various Sunni scholars it is considered a great, if not unique, distinction
 ek parampara ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jise ali ne dekha tha kyonki usne apane haathon main navjaat shishu ko liya tha
 Muhammad named him Ali, meaning "great"

 According to some hadiths, a verse about Ali about his sacrifice was revealed on the night of the Hijra, stating, "and among men is he who sells his nafs in exchange for Allah's pleasure
 " Ali escaped the plot, but risked his life again by living in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore all the goods and properties entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping to their owners

 Ali compiled a complete version of the Quran, Musaf, six months after Muhammad's death
 madina ke anya logon ko dikhaane ke liye wolum puraa ho gaya tha or oont dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The order of this mushaf differed from that which was later gathered during the Uthmanic era
 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar

 'ali was one of the electoral council to elect a third caliph appointed by Omar

 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai

 more friendly with them and securing their confidence and sympathy
 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership

 Although many people at this time were counted as political Shiites, some of them believed in Ali's religious leadership
 misr ke governor kii niyukti ke baad malik al-ashtar ko bheje gaye patr main unki nitiyon or shashan ke vichaar prakat hue hai
 This directive, which has historically been seen as the ideal constitution for Islamic rule with the Constitution of Medina, at that time included a detailed account of the duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main sections of society
 ali ne malik al-ashtar ko unke nirdeshon main likhaa tha: Since most of Ali's people were nomads and farmers, he was concerned with agriculture

 Ali died on 29 January 661, two days later
 al-hasan ne kus ko puraa kiya or ali kii maut par ebn mulajam ko samaan sajaa di
 After Ali's death, the Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to their eldest son, Hassan, without controversy, as Ali had on several occasions declared that the people of the House of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community
 is samay, muvayah ne levent or misr donon ko rakhaa or muslim samrajya main sabase badi takat ke commander ke rup main, khud ko khalipha ghoshit kar diya or hasan ke khalipha kii seat par apni sena ko iraq main ghumaya

 In this way Mu'awiyah captured the Islamic Caliphate and tuned it into a secular empire

 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation

 The Tuvalu Monarchy is the constitutional monarchy of Tuvalu
 tuvaalu ke ekadhidaruk ko tuvaalu or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952
 anya rashtramandal deshon ke saamaan hi tuvaalu kii raajnneetik vyavastha westminster pranali par aadhaarit he, jisamen rashtrapramukh kaa pad nammaatr hota he, or vaastavik prashasnic shaktiyaan shashanpramukh par nihit hote hai
 Tuvalu is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of Tuvalu is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers of the governor-general of Tuvalu as his representative
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " tuvaalu kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " tuvaalu ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical backdrop of the monarchy in Tuvalu dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha
 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 tuvaalu kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai
 In terms of studies, Western philosophy can be divided into three parts - 1
 pracheen darshan 2
 Medieval Philosophy 3
 aadhunik darshan In ancient philosophy man's intelligence was empowered to think on every subject
 madhyakaal main isiyat kii ore se is adhikaar ko lalakaara gaya
 The main function of medieval philosophy was to investigate claims of faith and wisdom
 vishwaas kaa daawa tha ki satya kaa mahatvapurn bhaag daivi avishkaar he, vah buddhi kii samaj main aae yaa na aae ise to maananaa hi hoga
 Initially, Christian thinkers accepted beliefs of faith and wisdom as integral
 iske baad darshan ko dharm kii apeksha gaun pad diya or buddhi ko vishwaas kii daasi banaaya; ant main buddhi ne apane adhikaar par bal diya or vishwaas tathaa buddhi ke kshetra pruthak ho gaye
 William Durands said that there are two types of truth - the same principle can be true from one point of view and false from the other
 madhyakaal kaa darshan pramukh rup main vidwanmandal kaa darshan he
 It began in the eighth century; It flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries; The 13th century was its puberty period, in the 14th and 15th centuries, internal conflicts and some external causes ended it
 jo vichaarvishay teevr matbhed kaa kaaran ban gaye unamem darshanik drushtikon ke yatharthwaad or namawaad kaa sangharsh pramukh tha
 In personal situation we see many human beings, in addition to this, the suffix of human is also our idea
 is pratyay kii sthiti satta main kya he? yatharthwaad ke anusaar yah pratyay vishesh manushyon se alag astitv rakhata he; vishesh manushya to isaki apurna nakalen yaa iske udhaaharan maatr hai
 According to nomenclature, the real power belongs to particular human beings, "man" is just a name, which we give to every one of a few individuals based on some similarities
 vastav main yah yatharthwaad or abhasavad kaa jhagada tha
 Consistent with this was the difference of rationalism and empiricism
 jo log saamaanya ko maanate hi na the, unke liye sara gyaan indriyadutt gyaan tha
 This philosophical dogma led to the distinction of many principles in religion
 vivaad ke pramukh vishay ye the- Anselm is considered the founder of scholarly theory
 darshan ke itihaas main us yukti kaa vishesh sthaan he, jo insalm ne ishwar ke astitv ke paksh main di
 Kant did not accept this tactic, but said that the other tips given are variations of Anselm's device
 madhyakaal ke darshan main tamas equinas or dans scots ke naam vishesh mahatv ke hai
 He was the chief spokesperson of both sides in the intense controversy of realism and nomism
 tamas equinas kii dharna thi ki gyaan ke kuch kshetra vishwaas ke hi vishay hai; isapar bhi indriyadutt gyaan un mul niyamon kii sahaayta se, jo prayek kii sakriy buddhi main vidyaman hai, vishwa or paramatma ke swaroop ke vishay main kuch bataa saktaa he
 Duns Scotus thought that all knowledge was confined to particulars; The existence of common suffixes is nominal
 dans scots ke yogya shishy okhm ne namawaad ke prasar main safal ytn kiya
 Scholasticism became so entangled in logic that it lost its connection with religion
 dharmik vritti ke logon ko "sanshodhan" ne apni ore khinch liya
 The segregation of religion and philosophy opened the way to modern philosophy
 aadhunik kaal main manushya kii buddhi ne phir swadhin vivechan kaa kaam utsukata ke saath aarambh kar diya
 In the view of some, Bacon pointed it out, but the majority considers Decart as its founder
 darshanikon ke safal or vifal vivaad ne decort ko prerana di ki ho sake to darshan main ganit kii nischitata pravisht kare
 Spinoza and Leibniz had the same feeling after that
 england main vichaarak manovigyaan kii ore jhuke ore unhone maanav buddhi ko anusandhan kaa vishay banaaya
 Empiricism found first-class thinkers such as Locke, Workley, and Hume
 mahadwipiya vichaarkon kaa vivekwaad or england kaa anubhavvaad do vipareet dishaao main jahaan tak ja sakate the, ja pahunche
 Now Germany became the center of philosophical debate
 kaant ne vivekwaad or anubhavvaad ko aalochanawad main samanvit karne kaa ytn kiya
 Hagel and Schapenhaver promoted suffragism
 is aadhunik darshan kii teen pramukh shakhaayen ye hai- Apart from this, special issues were also considered
 decort ne samayik andeh se aarambh kiya
 Immediately he finds that this doubt cannot be a matter of doubt
 uskaa pehla sandigdh bodh yah tha- With more thought, he came to the conclusion that the existence of divine and material world is also the result of bizarre and clear thinking and therefore unambiguous facts
 sari satta do prakaar kii he - purush or prakruti
 These two are matter - completely different from each other
 purush kaa gun chetana he, prakruti kaa gun vistaar yaa failaav he
 The distinction between these two is the culmination of distinction
 barooth spinoja ne kaha ki dravya ke pratyay main ananthata nihit he
 Infinity can be only one, overall is the only substance
 anant ke anant gun hai, parantu manushya keval do gunon, chintan or vistaar, ke vishay main jaan saktaa he
 The various shapes of contemplation are called souls or creatures; Expansion shapes are physical substances
 in donon main kaaran-kaary kaa sambandh nahin, keval samanantarata he
 The only reason is the whole or God; Humans are subject to inevitability
 anivaaryta kii sweekruti hi swadhinata he
 Understanding the impulses, doing them under the rule of pleasure and love is the goal of man, this is called God love
 libniz ne kaha ki dravya ek nahin, parantu ek prakaar ke hai
 He did not have a clear contact of the net point with any other point
 aarambh main hi paramatma ne unamem aisa saamanjasy utpann kar diya ki prayek kaa aatmbodh use bataa detaa he ki dusron kii atmaaon main kya ho rahaa he
 Watches made by an accomplished watchmaker do not affect each other, but all show the same time
 decort ne dwaitvaad ko, spinoja ne advaitvaad kaa or libniz ne aadhyatmik anekavaad ko apanaaya
 John Locke started his famous book "essay on Human Wisdom" with a rejection of spontaneous, unexplained suffixes
 usne kaha ki manushya kaa man aarambh main ek kori takhti sa hota he, anubhav usapar anek prakaar ke vichaar ankit karata he
 Some of these thoughts are in the form of sensations, some are the result of contemplation of the mind
 dravya kaa pratyaksh duusare prakaar kaa vichaar he
 The mind finds some properties combined and imagines the basis of their combination, such a basis is considered as substance
 bhautik dravya main kuch gun vidyaman hote hai, kuch, bhram main usamen sthit samaj liye jate hai
 Shape, magnitude, solidity, speed are qualities of the first type; The form, the color, the juice, the smell, the words are not outside us, but are inside us
 These are called the predominant and secondary qualities respectively
 bahya dravya kaa jo pratyay ham banaate hai, vah spasht nahin hota
 They do not know how different properties are combined, nor do they know how particular properties of a group of properties flow out
 george barkale ne kaha ki pradhan gun bhi apradhan gunon kii tarah maansik roopaantar hi hai
 Except for both types of qualities, the remaining astral thoughts remain and such thoughts do not exist
 is tarah barkale ne abhautikwaad kaa samarthan kiya
 All power is with the warnings and their thoughts
 hamaara bodh, adhik maatra main, hampar thopa jaataa he; aankh kholane par main nishchay nahin karata ki mujhe kya dikhaai degaa
 The reason for this realization is the action of God
 yah kriya nishchit niyamon ke anusaar hoti he; in niyamon kaa hi praakrit niyam kaa naam diya jaataa he
 All power is made up of the warnings and their states of consciousness
 anubhavvaad main ek pag uthaanaa baaki tha, vah david hum ne uthaaya
 Hume said that the realization that experience gives us, they are all separate from each other, but there is no connection between them
 jin gunon ko ham ek saath dekhte rahe hai, unke samooh ko ek padaarth samaj lete hai
 This is the position of the knower, that too is a group of conscious states
 hum ne dravya ke pratyay ko bhav or kalpana kii rachana bataaya or abhasavad kaa samarthan kiya
 The foundation of science is on the causal-work relationship, Hume, like other relations, described the relationship as fictitious and turned empiricism into skepticism
 anubhavvaad ne is dharna ke saath aarambh kiya tha ki hamaara sara gyaan baahar se praapt hota he, hum ne kaha ki anubhavvaad main nishchit gyaan kii sambhaavna hi nahin
 Emanuel Kant tried to mix the different streams of rationalism and empiricism and shed them on a riverbed
 usne kaha ki gyaan kii kachi saamagree baahar se praapt hoti he, man ise anivaary akruti detaa he
 Kant's suffixism was not anachronistic, he believed that the contribution of the mind to the creation of knowledge is an essential part
 samvedan baahar se praapt hote hai, parantu inhen desh or kaal ke saanchon se guzarana hota he or tab ye sanyukt haakar vastu-gyaan banate hai
 Country and time are mental figures
 pratyayon kii samanta or asamanta ke aadhaar par jo nirnay banate hai, unke banane main man unhen gun, pariman, sambandh or aakaar ke sutron main bandhta he
 Kant's first objective was to protect science from the invasion of Hyam
 kuch samay ke liye usne hum ke kaaranta ke siddhant ko sweekaar kiya
 It was the criticism of this that made his goal
 kaaran-kaary-sambandh kaa astitv to asandigdh he: prashn yah he ki iskaa aadhaar kya he
 Kant agrees with Hume in the idea that it does not have its source in external events
 vah kahata he ki buddhi ise un ghatnaon par apni ore se lagu karti he or nire bahutv kii vyavastha main badal detii he
 Not only to receive knowledge, it is a creation - the work of the mind is its fundamental symbol
 "vishuddh buddhi" abhaason kii duniya se pare nahin ja sakati; jab jane kaa ytn karti he to virodhon main ulajh jaati he
 The knowledge of indirect, as it may be, is the result of practical intelligence
 manushya anivaary rup se naitik praani he
 Kartta requires the ability to perform independent work for duty
 hamaara lakshya purna siddhi he
 Eternity is required for the accomplishment of this infinite goal
 shubh or ashubh kaa fal avashya milanaa chahie, yah naitik bhaavana kii maang he
 For this, there should be a ruler of sufficient power
 vyaavhaarik buddhi swadhinata, amartv or aastikwaad ko manyata detii he
 Kant had said that the search for intelligence is limited in the world of perception, it should not be thoughtless in relation to the absolute
 uske peeche aanewaalon ne uskaa paraamarsh nahin mana or nirpeksh ko hi apane vivechan kaa vishay banaaya
 Hegel stated that the fundamental power is the "mind"
 vikaas main jo kram bahya jagat main hota he, vahi chintan main hota he - tark or tatvagyan ek prakaar ke hi adhyayan hai
 Ja is something prudent is truth, what is true is prudential
 vikaas kaa moulik tathy "virodh" he
 Every situation in the world has its opposition
 is virodh ke prakat hone ke baad, donon sthitiyon main samanvay hota he
 Since mind is the basis of this change, motion in general is progress
 chintan main prayek dharna pratidharana ko janm detii he or phir donon kaa samanvay ho jaataa he
 It appears from a high level in this coherence that both perception and perception were true, albeit partially true
 darshanik vivechan main is kram ke kai udhaaharan milte hai
 Rationalism was a belief, it gave rise to the notion of empiricism
 kaant ne apane aalochanavaad main donon kaa samanvay kiya or bataaya ki donon pakshon main aanshik satya he
 Each coordination creates a new perception and gives rise to a new conception
 yah kram lagaataar jari rahata he
 In relation to politics, Hegel forgot this broad rule and said that the nation had achieved its final shape in the administration 
 parantu yahan vaktaa darshanik hegel nahin, apitu swadeshbhimani hegel tha
 Shappenhaver also made the pursuit of the elemental his goal
 hegel kii tarah usne bhi man ko aisa tatv mana, parantu vivek yaa buddhi ke sthaan main usne sankalp ko yah gaurav kaa pad diya- mere yaa apane sankalp ko nahin, apitu vyapak sankalp ko
 In the root world, this resolution is expressed in various forms of Prakrit Shakti, such as attraction, heat, light, electricity, etc
 vanaspati or pashu-pakshiyon ke jivan main ye vyavasthapika shakti ke rup main vyakt hota he or manushya main atmachetana kaa rup grahan karata he
 Man wants to produce happiness by nature, but in the situation in which he is lying, his efforts fail
 jivan kaa sangharsh hi aparimit du:kha ko paidaa kar detaa he
 It is not proper for a human being to lead an ascetic life except on every kind of desire or aspiration and meditate on the vast destitution of things
 hegel ne vivek ko multatv mana; use ashaavadi hona hi tha
 Shapenhaver, who believed in the core of blind resolve, was the greatest abusive of modern times
 19veen shatee ke madhya kaal ke baad jo vivechan hua, vah praaia: vishesh vishyon ke sabandh main hua
 The subject presented here is being discussed symbolically

 fredrick nitshe - naitik mulyon kaa pratimulyankan 2
 Herbert Spencer and Bergson - Evolutionism 3
 peers or wiliam james- vyavahaarwad nietzsche-schopenhauer said that the rule of blind resolve is widespread in the world
 nitshe ne kaha ki manushya ke liye sarvocch aakanksha 'shakti kii aakanksha' he
 The warrior believes in war; Let every battle be fought with courage, making its purpose good
 swadhin purush kii niti daason kii niti se bahut bhinn he
 Christianity has propagated the slave policy by treating humility, compassion, sympathy, equality as virtue
 naitik mulyon kaa phir se moolyankan hona chahie
 The work of strong people and castes is to move forward; The obstacle that comes in the way, you have to stumble and overcome it
 nirbalon kaa bhala bhi isi main he ki balavaanon ko adhik balavaan banane main sahaayta den
 What is more fortunate for a goat to become a part of a lion's body? harbart spencer or bergsaan - herbert spencer ne prakritik vikaswad kaa prasar kiya
 The redistribution of nature and motion is continuous, life is expressed on one floor and after that consciousness is manifested at the appropriate time
 bergsaan ne kaha ki gati to keval sthanparivartan he, isamen jivan utpann karne kii kshamta nahin
 The speed of nature consists of frequency, not novelty, and novelty is the major symbol of life
 prakruti to jivan kii raakh he, jivan-satta kaa mul tatv he
 Bergsan combines life and consciousness, sometimes it seems to be integral
 bergsaan ne apni pramukh pustak ko "utpaadak vikaas" kaa naam diya
 It is known by this name that his approach is different from that of natural evolution
 jivan nirantar pravaah he
 The work of the intellect is the breaking of objects to facilitate behavior; It cannot see life in its true form
 antajryoti jeevanapravaah ko saakshaat dekhati he
 Kant had said that wisdom cannot go beyond the world of perception
 bergasaan ne is duniya ke sabandh main bhi uske kshetra ko simit kar diya
 William James - American thinkers made the 'nature of truth' a major topic of discussion
 charles peers ne "vyavahaarwad" kii nivan rakhin; james ne is neenv par bhawan khadaa kiya
 Two solutions to "truth" were well-known - conformism and non-resistance
 james ke matanusaar jo vishwaas jivanavyavahaar main sahaayak siddh ho, ve satya he, jo baadhak hon, ve asaty hai
 Like conduct, truth and utility are also the same in knowledge
 anurupatavaad ke anusaar satya gyaan main gyaata ke vichaar or vaastavik sthiti main samanta haati he
 Our knowledge cannot go beyond our thoughts according to non-opposition; The rest of the knowledge which cannot be thought beyond our thoughts; The idea that can be combined with the rest of knowledge is true
 vyavahaarwad ke anusaar jo vichaar safal kriya main parinat ho saktaa he, vah satya he
 March 27 is the 86th day of the year according to the Gregory calendar
 saal me abhi or 279 din baaki he
 World Theater Day is celebrated on 27 March
 1898- sar saiyad ahamed khan, mohammadan anglo-oriental college ke sansathapak Pratappur is a village in Aliganj block of Katra Etah district
 jivan beemaa ek likhit qaraar he jo kisi vyakti evam bimapradaata ke bich main kiya jaataa he
 In this agreement, the insurer promises to give the insured a pre-approved amount in case of death or any accident
 is vaade ke badale main bimaadhari vyakti ko ek nirdhaarit raashi kisi nirdhaarit samyaanterval par kisi nirdhaarit avadhi tak dete rahane ke liye sahamat hota he
 In life insurance the payment of the policy is fixed and the occurrence of the insured is also targeted, but the time of its occurrence is not fixed
 isliye jivan beemaa ko 'jivan aashwaasan' kehete hai
 The subject of life insurance is human
 bharat main palsi dharak ke hiton ki raksha karne hetu,evam beemaa udyog kaa krambaddh viniman, sanvardhan tathaa sambadhit va aakasmik maamalon par kaary karne hetu beemaa viniamak or vikaas praadhikaran kaa sanghathan kiya gaya he

 Homosexuality refers to a person being sexually and romantically attracted to people of the same sex
 ve purush, jo anya purushon ke prati aakarshith hote he unhen "purush samalingi" yaa ge or jo mahila kisi anya mahila ke prati aakarshith hoti he use bhi ge kaha ja saktaa he lekin use aamtaur par "mahila samalingi" yaa lasbian kaha jaataa he
 People who are attracted to both women and men are called bisexual
 kul milakar samalangik, ubhaylangik or lingaparivartit logo ko milakar el ji bi tii samudaay banataa he
 It is hard to say how many people are gay
 samalangikta kaa astitv sabhi samskritiyon or deshon main paaya gaya he, yadhyapi kuch deshon kii sarkarein is baat kaa khandan karti he
 Although it can be said that the term homosexuality is used for people who are romantically attracted to people of the same sex, there are other definitions
 yadi koi samalangikta ko is arth main letaa he ki yah shabd keval un logo ke liye prayukt hota he jo samaan ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, tab is paribhaasha ke anusaar kahin adhik log samalangik honge bajaay ki yadi koi samalangikta kaa arth keval yah samajhataa ho jisamen do samanlingi logon ke aapasi yon-sambandh he
 Typically, the term is used for all people who are attracted to the same sex, even for those who do not yet have homosexual sex
 baharhaal, samalangikta kaa sabase dikhaai dene vaala rup vaastavik sambandh he
 Most evidence of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from paintings depicting two men in intimate relationships or sexual acts
 kuch log homophil or φιλεῖν ) shabd kaa bhi upyog karte hai
 This word is usually a "polite" word
 yah aamtaur par un logon ke liye prayukt hota he jo keval apane ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, par jinke samalangik sambandh nahin he yaa wo samarth nahin hai
 Many words are used for homosexuals
 inamen se kuch kaa upyog samalangikon ko apamaanit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, the LGBT community sometimes uses these words to describe themselves
 yah in shabdon ko kam kshtakaari banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some of the terms used for gay men are gay and queer
 samalangik mahilaon ke liye prayukt hone vaale kuch shabd hai lasbian or dike
 The term lasbian is mostly used
 dike kam upyog main aane vaala shabd he, jo kabhi-kabhi un lasbiyanon ke liye prayukt hota he, jo adhik purushon jaisi hoti hai 
 When gay people keep their sexual orientation a secret, they are said to be "in the closet"
 "khulaa" yaa "kothri se baahar" ek kathboli shabd he, jiskaa arth he ki koi samalangik vyakti apni langik prarthamikta ko lekar khulaa hua he
 This means that the person does not hide the fact of his homosexuality
 kuch samalangik log isliye apni langikta ko chhipate he ki ve sochate hai ki pataa lagane par na jane kya hoga yaa ve aise kshetra main rahete hai jo samalangikon ke liye surakshit nahin he
 Sometimes people who are "open" also say they are 'proud'
 "khulaa" yani ki ve apni langik prarthamikta ko nahin chipa rahe hai
 "proud" means that they are not ashamed of it
 "garv hona" yaa "garv karnaa", kaa algebiti samudaay main vishesh arth he
 This means that they are happy and celebrating their homosexuality
 iskaa arth "garv hona" hona nahin he, jaise unhonen koi aisa kaam kiya ho, lekin iskaa arth lajjit hone ke viparit he
 Many cities have "pride parades"
 pehle ye virodh pradarshan hua karte the, lekin aaj, inhen aamtaur par utsav manaane ke liye yojit kiya jaataa he or ye adhikanshtah june ke maheene main 1969 ke neuyork shahar main bhadke 'stonewal dangon' kii smriti main yojit hoti hai
 These riots occurred as a result of police harassing people when they were gay
 'stonewal' yaa 'stonewal dange' kabhi-kabhi algebiti adhikaar andolan kaa prarambh bhi maane jate hai
 The reasons for being gay and bisexual are disputed
 bahut se dharmon main samalangikta yaa ubhaylangikta ko paap mana jaataa he
 In some religions homosexuality or bisexuality is seen as choices that depend on a person's own choice
 parantu, bahut se aadhunik vaigyanikon dwaara darshaya gaya he ki samalangikta vikalp nahin he
 The factors of homosexuality are not yet clear, but the effects and environment of genetics and prenatal hormones are sometimes considered its factors
 vaigyanikon ne yah bhi darshaya he ki samalangikta keval manushyon main hi nahin balki bahut si pashu prajatiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Homosexuality has also been found in many animals such as penguins, chimpanzees, and dolphins, some even as humans for a lifetime
 bahut se vaigyanik or chikitsak is baat par sahamat hai ki samalangik vyavhaar ko badla nahin ja saktaa he
 Homosexuals were treated by doctors assuming that it was a mental disease
 yadhyapi, ab bahut se deshon main samalangikta ko chikitsakon dwaara maansik rog kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 There are some religious communities, which are in the treatment of homosexuality
 ise 'riperrative chikitsa' kaha jaataa he
 In this type of therapy, many homosexuals have tried to make themselves heterosexual and they claim that they have changed, but many people do not believe that this is possible
 riperrative chikitsa kii bahut se chikitsa or manorog vigyaan samoohon dwaara ninda kii gai he, jaise america manovaigyanik sangh, america manorog sangh, royal manochikitsak mahavidhyalay, rashtriya saamaajik kaaryakarta sangh, royal nursing mahavidhyalay or america bal chikitsa academy
 These scientific and educated groups agree that sexual orientation or sexual orientation cannot be changed
 yah is baat par bhi sahamat hai ki riperrative chikitsa kaa samalangikon par aahatkaari prabhaav ho saktaa he
 Many people consider it unfortunate that without discussing the factors of heterosexuality, the factors of homosexuality and bisexuality are being discussed
 yadhyapi yah samajhnaa saral he ki vishamalangikta ke astitv kaa kya kaaran he, lekin yah is baat par prakaash nahin daalata ki samalangik logon ke mastishk kaa vikaas kis prakaar hota he
 Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality are all reasons, and some believe that discussing only homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people with these types of sexual preferences

 bahut se deshon main samalangik apane jodidar se vaidhanik rup se vivaah nahin kar sakate
 However, they can have the same relationship as heterosexuals
 samalangik praayah ek duusare ko 'jodidar' yaa 'jivan-saathi' kehete he, bajaae ki 'pati' yaa 'patni' kehane ke
 They may have a 'commitment ceremony' rather than a matrimonial ceremony
 kuch samalangikon kaa vivaah samaaroh hota he, yadhyapi sarkaar dwaara ise manyata nahin di jaati yaa sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa
 They call their partner husband or wife, without worrying about the law
 par unke liye vivaah keval naam ke liye nahin he
 Married people have many benefits
 kisi deshaanusaar ye laabh bahut prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise - kam kar bhugtan, apane pati / patni kaa beemaa paanaa, sampatti kaa uttaradhikari hona, saamaajik suraksha laabh, bachche paidaa karnaa yaa god lenaa, apane pati / patni ke desh pravasgaman, apane biimaar pati / patni ke liye kisi vikalp kaa chunaav karnaa, yaa apane biimaar pati / patni ko aspataal milane janaa
 There are currently 25 countries where homosexuals are allowed to marry or in some states / parts where homosexuals are allowed to marry
 ye hai- netherland, norge, belgium, spain, dakshin africa, taiwan, brazil, argentina, kolombia, frans, ireland, island, portugal, denmark, america, germany, malta, newzealand, united kingdom, mexico, sweden, luxmberg, urugway, finland or canada
 The Netherlands was the first country to be recognized in 2001

 Sometimes these are called 'gay marriage' or 'gay marriage'
 bharat ke kai hisson main bhi samalangik rishte or vivaah kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 Probably the first gay marriage in Chhattisgarh was composed by Tanuja Chauhan and Jaya Verma, nurses of the district hospital in Surguja
 ise desh main samarohpurvak samalangik vivaah kaa pehla maamla bataaya jaataa he
 Both married Vedic customs on 27 March 2001
 chhattisgarh ke hi durg zile main to doctor nira rajak or nurse anjani nishad ne samalangik vivaah ke liye jila prashasan ko aavedan bhi diya lekin zila prashasan ne is aavedan ko thukraa kar apana pallaa jhaad liya
 However, it did not make any difference to their lives

 In September 2018, the Supreme Court of India declared the use of this section unconstitutional for acts in which two adults mutually consent to homosexual conduct
 arthath bharat main paraspar sahmati se do vayaskon ke bich samalangik sambandh ab aparaadh nahin rahaa
 This decision also applies to the State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 141 of the Constitution of India and the Delhi Agreement 1952, as Section 377 of the IPC and the Ranbir Penal Code is cross materia and the judicial accent has been extended to Jammu and Kashmir
 vivaah ke bajaae kuch deshon yaa rajyon main samalangikon ke liye 'naagarik sangyojan' yaa 'gharelu bhagidaari' kaa praavdhaan he
 Some, but not all, benefits and benefits related to marriage are available under these provisions
 naagarik sangyojan yaa gharelu bhagidaari jaise praavdhaanon ko algebiti samudaay dwaara 'duusare darje' ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Gay couples do have some advantages in this, but they aim that these types of couples are not as important or legitimate as heterosexual couples
 kuch log to inaki tulana "alag lekin samaan" niyamon se bhi karte hai jinka upyog america main logon ko nasleey rup se pruthak karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 They believe that separate rules can never be the same and that homosexuals should be rejected as second class citizens
 samalangik yonkriya yaa ge sex use kehete hai jab samaan ling ke logon ke bich yon sambandh hon, chaahe ve do yaa do se adhik purush hon yaa mahilaayein
 Many religions consider homosexual sex as a sin, including Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity
 yadhyapi in dharmon ke kuch sampradaayon main, mukhyatah isiyat or yahudiyat main ab samalangikta ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In modern times homosexuality is accepted in "western" countries
 adhikansh pashchimi deshon main samalangiko ko hinsa or bhedbhaav se bachaane ke liye kanoon bane hue hai
 Although in many countries homosexuals are not protected from discrimination
 ek samalangik vyakti ko keval isliye naukari se nikaala ja saktaa he kyonki vah samalangik he, bhale hi vah kitna acha karmchaaree kyon naa ho
 Homosexuals may also be deprived of renting a house or eating in a restaurant due to their sexual orientation
 in deshon main samalangik hinsa or bhedbhaav kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 For example, Islamic law is used in some places to put homosexuals in prison and even to inflict capital punishment
 kuch samoohon kaa maananaa he ki 1979 ke baad se iran main lagbhag 4,000 samalangikon ko unki langik prarthamikta ke aadhaar par phaansi di ja chuki he
 In 2005, two teenage boys were hanged after fourteen months of captivity and torture
 united kingdom main samalangikta aparaadh hua karata tha
 The famous Irish writer named Oscar Wilde was taken captive by this and, as a result, his reputation as a comedian and playwright suffered a major setback
 ellen turing naam ke vyakti ko, jisane dwitiya vishwa yuddh main germanon dwaara prayukt kiye gaye anigma code ko tod kar mitra rashtron kii sahaayta kii thi, par is aparaadh kaa doshi tehraaya gaya or antat uski samalangikta ke upachaar ke prabhaav ke kaaran usne aatmahatya kar lee
 Today, gays are safe in the United Kingdom
 vayaskon ke bich yon sambandh aparaadh nahin he
 Gay men and women may not marry, but they may have a "civil partnership" under which certain rights and benefits related to marriage are granted
 samalangik purush sena main bhartee ho sakate hai
 So although many things have changed in the United Kingdom, homosexuals still do not have full and equal rights
 adhikansh duniya main, samalangikon ko abhi bhi utane adhikaar or swatantraaa nahin he, jitne ki vishamalangikon ko
 India has also become safe for gay people from 6 / 9 / 2018
 yahaan pehle ise 158 saalo se gaiyr kanoonee rup main mana jaataa tha
