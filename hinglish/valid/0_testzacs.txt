 kiran bedi ne kaha ki pranab mukherjee buudhvaar ko baithak shuru hote hi gusse main dikhe or wo kah rahe the ki jo aapako karnaa karte raho
 Regarding Anna's fast, the government said that it is his problem ie civil society and Anna Hazare

 Along with the proceedings of Parliament on 27 August, there was a continuous talk with Anna's colleagues
 magar sarkaar apana rukh spasht nahin kar rahi thi

 jisaki soochna dene ke liye phir se vilaas raav deshmukh pradhanmantri kaa patr lekar ramlila maidan aae
 After which Anna announced to postpone the fast on 28 August

 yah vastav main keval naitik jeet thi
 History was definitely made, but something concrete was yet to come out on paper
 haan isane uske liye rasta jarur bana diya tha
 Parliament's proposal to support Anna's three terms was sent to the Standing Committee which Parliament was not legally bound to believe
 aage sthaayee samiti ko i sabhi sujhaavon kaa vishleshan karne or yah bhi tay karne kaa adhikaar tha ki ve kitne vyaavhaarik hai
 Parliament had in principle upheld the basic logic of the government that the role of Parliament is paramount in framing the law and cannot be questioned
 sansad main din bhar chali bahes ke baad diemke, bahujan samaaj party, marxvaadi communist party, bhartiya communist party, samaajawaadee party or biju janata dal ne yah saafe kar diya tha ki lokayukta kii niyukti main sansad kii bhoomika nahin honi chahie kyonki isse rajyon kii swaittata prabhavit hogi
 Some of these parties had also cleared their intention to oppose any such move
 nichali naukarshahi ko bhi lokapal ke antargat laane ko congress ne sweekaar to kar liya lekin yah bhi kaha ki iske liye kanoonee or sansthagat dhaanche main moolbhoot parivartan abhi kiya janaa he

 Some parties advocated the creation of a National Judicial Commission instead and some insisted on a strong accountability bill
 pradhanmantri ko bhi isamen shaamil kiye jane ke mudde par bhi sarkaar ne koi vachan nahin diya
 Several parties, including the BJP, certainly supported the Prime Minister's inclusion in it with some precaution

 This mass movement made clear the selfish, anti-people and anti-people character by removing the anti-social mask on the faces of political parties
 vipakshi dalon ke saath hi isamen sabase vikrut cheharaa centre ke sattadhari dal bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa najar aayaa
 His lawyer ministers Kapil Sibal, p Chidambaram etc
, issued the Tughlaqi orders and statements as a slave to the ruler and Anna Hazare's team
 14 agast ko congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne anna hazaare par vyaktigat rup se akshep lagaate hue kaha ki anna bhrasht hai
 For this, he had referred to Justice Sawant's report constituted by the Congress government, in which Anna was convicted
 unhone yah nahin bataaya tha ki nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat ke baad is mudde par sukhtankar ayog ne jaanch kii thi or anna ko aropamukt kar diya tha
 The movement also reduced the stature of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Congress General Secretaries Rahul Gandhi, Ambika Soni etc
 as well as Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani, Sitaram Yechury etc
 manmohan singh ne sansad main is andolan ke peeche videshi shaktiyon kaa haath hone kii chetavanee di

 In all animals the contraction of the heart muscle begins by chemical impulse
 jis veg par hriday gati in aavegon kii chaal ko niyantrit karti he
 The cells that maintain the rhythm of these impulses are called pacemakers and they directly control heart rate
 ek yantric divaais jise kritrim pesamekar kehete hai, jiskaa prayog maanav main or kabhi kabhi anya pashuon main aavegon ke kritrim utpaadan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jab sharir kii aantarik sanvaahan prakriya kshatigrast ho jaati he
 Only 1% of the cardiomyocyte in the myocardium has the ability to produce electrical impulses
 dil kaa ek vishesh bhaag, jise sinotroial node kehete hai, aatrial sancharan kshamta ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 a group of synothelial node cells is positioned on the right atrium wall, near the entrance of the superior vena cava
 yah koshikaayen sanshodhit cardiomeosite hai
 They have poorly developed contractile fibers, but have relatively weak contractures
 ese node main koshikaayen anayas hi nidhruvanit ho jaati hai, jiske parinamswaroop prati minute main lagbhag 100 baar sankuchan kaa kaary karti he
 The basic rate of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is constantly modified by arterial fibers, so the average heart rate of an adult human at rest is 70 beats per minute
 kyonki sinotroial node hriday kii baaki vaidyut gatividhi ke liye jimmedaar hota he, kabhi kabhi ise praathmik pesamekar kehete hai
 If the SA node does not work, then further, the group of cells moves down the heart to become the pacemaker of the heart, which is called ectopic pacemaker
 yah koshikaayen etriovanticular node kii rachana karti hai, jo aatrial septom ke bheetar, baayin aatrial or dahine nilay ke bich kaa sthaan hota he
 Normally the cells of an AV node discharge 40–60 beats per minute, which is called secondary pacemaker
 iske neeche hriday kii vidyut pranali kaa sanchaalan uskaa bandal karata he
 When SA and AV Nodes do not work both to the left and right of this bundle, but the filaments will also produce spontaneous performance at a rate of 30–40 beats per minute
 The reason is that the SA node controls the entire heart so that its action potentials are often released from the heart muscle cells, producing contractions
 ese node dwaara utpann sambhavit karrwai neeche hriday chaalan pranali se gujarata he or anya koshikaon ke aane se pehle use sahaj karrwai kii kshamta utpann karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 This is the electrical activity of the heart
 There is a normal electrical conduction system within the heart
 ek pesamekar kaksh main ek kaary kshamta kii peedi ke teen mukhya charan hai
 Because the stages correspond to the contraction of heart muscle cells, their naming system is the same
 jiske kaaran kuch bhram paidaa ho sakate hai
 There is no first or second phase, only zero third and fourth stage
 pesamekar kii koshikaon ke talbaddh pravaah se mahatvapurn yah he ki mansapeshiyon or neuron ke vipareet yah koshikaayen swayan ke dwaara dhire dhire nidhruvit hoti hai
 As in other cells, the rest of the pacemaker cell functionality is caused by the continuous outflow or "leakage" of potassium ions through the ion channel proteins of the membrane surrounding the surrounding cells
 antar yah he ki samay ke saath-saath yah potacium pargamyata ghat jaati he or aanshik rup se iske kaaran nidhruvan kii kriya dhimi ho jaati he
 At the same time, there is a slow inward flow of sodium known as the phoney current, as well as an inward flow of calcium
 sab kuch koshikaon ko or adhik sakaaratmak banane ke liye kaary karata he
 It continues at a relatively slow rate until the depolarization limit potential is reached
 seemaa 40mv or 50mv ke bich main rahata he
 After reaching the limit, cells enter stage 0
 haalanki phani karent dwaara adhik teji se nidhruvan kii vajah se, upar potacium kii pargamyata main kami aati he, akshatantu kii tulana main pesamekar koshikaon kii shirorekha dhimi ho jaati he
 SA and AV The node does not accelerate like neurons such as sodium channels and the action of copulation is mainly due to a slow flood of calcium ions
 
 voltage-samvedansheel calcium channelon dwaara calcium khuli hui koshikaon main daali jaati hai jabatak vah seemaa tak nahin pahunch jaatin
 Calcium channels become rapidly inactive soon after opening
 sodium pargamyata main bhi kami aa jaati he
 Potassium permeability increases and potassium efflux slowly repolarizes cells

 Arphy is betrayed in love by his girlfriend and kills him
 chandan bhi ab tak apni jindagi main pyaar main asafal rahaa he jabaki gulshan un ladakiyon ko prabhavit kar letaa he jinhen chandan pasand karata he
 Chandan and Gulshan come to Prague in connection with their work where he meets a Kazakh girl, Alina
 chandan ko elina se pyaar ho jaataa he or vah usase apane pyaar kaa izhaar karata he, elina bhi chandan se pyaar karne lagati he
 One day, Chandan sees Elina and Gulshan together
 iske baad vah niraash ho jaataa he or elina se dur rahanaa shuru kar detaa he
 Chandan considers himself responsible for the death of his special friend Arfee, who dies in an accident
 gulshan use samajhaata he ki arfi ke saath uski baatcheet uski kori kalpana he, arfi kii maut ho chuki he
 Arfi keeps warning Chandan to avoid love
 film tab ek naatakeey mode leti he jab chandan gusse main aakar gulshan ko maar detaa he
 In Prague, things related to the past of Chandan and Gulshan emerge

 Some literary works that were composed in the 9th century are still preserved
 kannada sahitya ko mukhyatah teen saahitiyik kaalon main baanta jaataa he- pracheen kaal, madhyakaal tathaa aadhunik kaal 
 a special feature of Kannada literature is that the three sects Jain, Veerashaiva and Vaishnava composed literature in it, showing three clear streams in the medieval period

 Thus, the purpose of creating two texts was to propagate the elements of another Jainism and on the other hand to attract people to their religion by presenting a copy of popular Sanskrit epics in Kannada
 ye jain kavi sanskrit, praakrit tathaa apbhransh bhashaaon ke vidvan the, sahityashastra ke marmajna the or pratibhasampann kavi bhi
 These poets, with the necessary changes, made the mythological narratives compatible with their religion, but maintained their interestingness by not destroying their originality
 jain kaviyon kii rachanaaon se kannada bhashaa or sahitya kaa bada upkaar hua
 During this period, there was a special promotion of Champu poetry
 is samay ke dharmik kaavyon main adbhoot tathaa shant or loukik kaavyon main vir tathaa raudra rason kii vishesh rup se abhivyanjana hui
 In addition to the above two types of poetry, texts were written on various topics like verses, rasa, ornament, grammar, dictionary, astrology, vaidyak etc
 is prakaar is yug main kannada sahitya kii sarvatomukhi unnati hui
 There were three famous poets of this era - Pampa, Ponn and Ranna who are famous as "rannatrayi"
 mahakavi pump athwa aadi pump ne do kavy rache–"adipurana" or "vikramarjunvijay" athwa "panpabharat"
 The Adipuran depicts the biography of the first Tirthankara Vrishabhanatha based on the Jinasenacharized Sanskrit Purana and the "vikramarajunvijay" depicts the plot of the Mahabharata
 ye donon champookavy hai
 The pumps are considered to be the original poets of Kannada
 inkaa samay san 941 ke lagbhag mana jaataa he
 Ponn was a contemporary of Pampa
 unhone teen granth rache the–"shantipurana", "jinaksharmala" tathaa "bhuvanakaramabhyuday"
 The last book is not available
 rann kii mukhya rachanaayen do hai– "ajitpurana" tathaa "saahas bhimavijay" athwa "gadayuddh"
 The hero of Gadayudh is Bhima
 gadayuddh main viraras kii anuthi vyanjana hui he
 With this poetry, Ranna's fame has become immovable
 pump yug ke anya kaviyon main choundary, nagvarm, durgasingh, chandraraj, nagachandra, nagvarm aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Chaundarai's "chaundarayuparan" is a beautiful specimen of ancient Kannada prose
 nagvarm pratham ke do granth praapt hue hai– "karnataka kandabari" tathaa "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" is the Kannada model of Kadambari of Baan
 yah champu style main he
 Prof
 Mughali is of the opinion that Kannada has the best of the translated texts in the Carnatic Kadambari of Nagavarma - Chandraraj and Sridharacharya are contemporary poets of Nagavarma
 chandraraj kaa kaamshaastra par likhaa hua "madanatilak" naamak granth or shridharacharya kaa "jatakatilak" naamak jyotish granth, donon uttam kritiyaan hai
 It was during this period that Durgasingh, who was a poet of the Bhagavata sect, introduced the Sanskrit "panchatantra"
 11veen or 12veen shatabdiyon ke bich ek anya prasiddh kavi hue, jinka naam nagachandra tha
 As he composed the Ramayana after getting inspiration from Pamparabharata, he got another name "abhinav Pampa"
 nagachandra ne bhi purvavarti jain kaviyon kii bhanti do kavy rache–"mallinathpurana" tathaa "ramchandracharitpurana" athwa "panparamayana"
 Pamparamayan is the oldest of the available Ramakatha poems of Kannada
 panpyug main mahakaviyon kaa aavirbhaav hua or unhone apni mahaan kritiyon se kannada ko samrudh banaaya
 Although large artistic adult poems were produced in this period, literature was not in contact with the lives of ordinary people of the society
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki is samay ke kavi raajaaon ke aashray main rahete the or ve jo kuch likhte the, yaa to apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yash gane ke liye likhte the yaa darbar ke anya panditon ke bich vaahvahee lutane ke liye athwa apane dharm kaa prachaar karne ke liye
 As a result, the colloquial language was not considered suitable for the literature surgeon
 sarvatra sanskrit kaa prabhaav padaa
 The adult poems composed in the Champu style were limited to the pundits, not the object of the general public
 12 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh se 15veen shatabdi tak kaa kaal basav yug kehalaata he
 The second name of this era is "revolution"
 is samay karnataka main dharmik, saamaajik yaa raajnneetik, aisa koi kshetra nahin tha jo kranti se achoota rah sakaa ho
 The revolutionaries of this revolution were Basava, Basavan or Basaveshwara, hence the name of this era was Basava era
 is kaal main sanskritnishtha kannada ke sthaan par bolchaal kii kannada sahitya ke nirmaan ke liye uparyukt samajhi gai or sanskrit kii kavyastylee ke badale deshi chhandon ko vishesh protsaahan diya gaya
 In the last centuries, the Jain fraternities had all rights in the literary field
 is yug main bhinn-bhinn mataavalambiyon ne sahitya ke nirmaan main yoga diya
 Devotion became a strong driving force in the growth of literature
 12veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main basaweshwar kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He created a great upheaval in the religious and social life of Karnataka by the re-organization of the Veerashaivism
 basav tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne apane mat ke prachaar ke liye bolchaal kii kannada ko madhyam banaaya
 The Veerashaiva devotees recounted their experiences in devotion, knowledge, quietness, virtue and policy in the style of niradambara, which became popular in the name of prabandh literature
 in virshaiv bhakton athwa shivasharanon ke vachan ek prakaar ke gadhygit hai
 Shiva Sharan did not create literature for literature
 unka mukhya uddeshy apane vichaaron kaa prachaar karnaa hi tha
 He had simplicity in his thoughts, truth and a sense of genuine curiosity
 isliye unki vaani main saahitiyik saushthav apane aap aa gaya
 The words of these Shiva Sharanas did the same thing in Karnataka that Kabir and his followers did in North India
 basav ne bhakthi kaa upadesh diya or is bhakthi kii sadhana main vaidic karmkand, murtipuja, jati panti kaa bhedbhaav, avatharavaad, andhashraddha aadi ko baadhak tehraaya
 He sought to make the path of spiritual means universal by building a casteless, colorless, classless society
 basav ke samakaleen virshaiv bhakton main allamprabhu, akkamahadevi, chenn-bansav tathaa siddharam pramukh hai
 In addition to these utterances Shiva Sharan, there were many such poets who presented poetic texts of devotional form using native verses
 12veen or 13veen shatabdiyon ke bich teen shreshth kavi hue harihar, raghavank or padmaras
 Names of Chandra, Bandhuvarma, Jann, Mallikarjuna, Keshiraj, Rattakavi and Kumudendu Muni are notable among the Jain poets of this period
 13veen shatabdi main karnataka kii dharmik sthiti main phir se uthal puthal hui
 On the one hand, Karnataka was influenced by the Srivaishnava sect founded by Ramanujacharya and on the other hand there was a new wave of devotion to Madhvacharya's dualism
 in donon vaishnav sampradaayon dwaara chalaai gai bhaktidhaara se kannada sahitya main nutan shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 As a result, the narratives of mythological epics were represented in Kannada in a purely original form
 is avadhi main rudrabhatt naamak ek vaishnav kavi hue jinka "jagannathavijay" kannada kaa sarvapratham vaishnav prabandh kavy mana jaataa he
 It is written in the Champu style and its narrative is related to Krishna
 15veen shatabdi se 19veen shtabdi ke ant tak kaa kaal kumarvyas yug kehalaata he
 During this period, the emperors of Vijayanagar and the kings of Mysore shared a special hand in the growth of Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm kii pratishtha badi jisaki pratikriya kannada sahitya main bhi dikhaai padi
 Bhakti propagated by Vaishnava religion appeared as a driving force in literature
 sahitya janata ke ati nikat sampark main aayaa
 The best poet of this period is Narnapp who became famous due to his popularity with the designation of "kumaravayas"
 kumarvyas bhagwat sampradaay ke pramukh kavi the
 There are differences among scholars regarding the birth date, birthplace of Narnapp or Kumaravyas and their creation
 pro mughali ke anusaar 14veen or 15veen shatabdiyon ke bich kumarvyas jivit the
 Kumaravyas is said to have written two poems called "kannada Bharat" or "gadugin Bharat" and "airavat"
 lekin airavat ke unki kriti hone main andeh prakat kiya gaya he
 "kannada India" depicts the story of the first ten festivals of the diffused Mahabharata
 yadhyapi pump ne apane "panpabharat" dwaara mahabharat kii sari katha kaa kannada praturup prastut kiya tha to bhi vah kumarvyas ke kannadabharat kii tarah lokapriy nahin ho sakaa
 There are two reasons for this - one is that there was a tendency towards pandityapradarshan in Pamparabharata and secondly that Jainism was also colored in it
 kumarvyas ke kannadabharat ke uparaant mahabharat, ramayana or bhagwat ke kathankon ke aadhaar par bahut se uttam kavy shatpadi style main prastut kiye gaye
 Following the path shown by Kumaravayas, a poet named Narhari or Kumaravalmiki composed "torveramayana" in Kannada based on Valmiki Ramayana
 yah bhi bhaktipradhan prabandh kavy hai, jo pracheen kannada kii ek saras kalakriti he
 Among the Bhagwat matavalambi poets, the names of Timman Kavi, Chatu Vitthalnath, Lakshmish and Nagaras are notable
 kumarvyas se prerana paakar timmann kavi ne mahabharat ke antim aath parvo kii katha kaa nirupan "krishnaraj bharat" naamak apane kavy main kiya
 The Kannada padyanuvad of the overall Bhagavata was first presented by a Bhagavata poet named Chatu Vitathalnath
 lagbhag isi kaal main ek atyant pratibhasampann kavi hue jinka naam lakshmish tha
 His written "jaminibharata" is a unique poem in which some interesting episodes of the Mahabharata are described as beautiful and touching
 lokapriyata kii drushti se karnataka main kumarvyas ke bharat ke baad jaiminibharat kaa sthaan he
 The poet named Nagarasa presented the Kannada verse of Bhagavad Gita called "vasudevakathamrutasara"
 jis prakaar is avadhi main kumarvyas, kumaravalmiki, lakshmish jaise bhagwat sampradaay ke kaviyon ne bharat, ramayana, bhagwat aadi mahakavyon se kathavstu lekar kannada main bhaktipradhan prabandh kaavyon kaa pranayan kiya, usee prakaar madhvamtavlambee bhakton ne bolchaal kii kannada main geet, bhajan, kirthan rachakar bhakthi kaa sandesh karnataka ke ghar-ghar pahunchaaya
 The tradition of these devotees began in the 13th century by Narharitirtha
 is samay in bhakton kii ek badi mandali jute gai thi jo pradhanthya do bhaagon main vibhajit thi
 One party was named "vyasakuta" and the other was "daskut"
 in donon main antar yahi tha ki ve bhakt vyasakut ke kehalaate the jo adhikansh brahman the or jo apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti ke liye sanskrit ko hi upyukt samajhate the, evam ve bhakt daskut ke maane jate the jinamein sabhi jatiyon ke log sammilit the or jo kannada ke madhyam se bhajan, kirthan rachate the
 There was no difference between the devotees of "vyasakuta" and "daskut" in the elements of the sect
 in donon dalon ke bhakt karnataka main haridas ke naam se prasiddh hai
 These Haridas filled the stock of Kannada literature by creating thousands of verses in the subjects of devotion, knowledge, virtue, policy, love, public behavior, etc
, but in grammatical Kannada
 haridaason kii parampara 18veen shatee tak chalati he
 The songs of Haridas have had a deep and wide impact on the Kannada people
 in haridaason main purandardaas, kanakadas, jagannathdas aadi pramukh hai
 Some 17th century Vaishnava poets created excellent poems in the 17th century, under the shelter of King Chikdevaraya of Mysore
 in kaviyon main thirumalarya, chikupadhyaay, singrarya, honnamma, helvan katte giriammaa, mahalingrang kavi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 At the same time, for the first time, the influence of the Sri Vaisnava sect was directly visible in Kannada literature
 chikadevaraay "binnap" tathaa "gitagopal" naamak apni rachanaaon main thirumalarya ne shrivaishnav sampradaay ke saath-saath aikantik bhakthi kaa nirupan kiya he
 "hadivadeyadharma" is a beautiful poem of Honnamma in which Satidharma is described in Pranjal language
 mahalingrang kavi ke likhe "anubhavamrutt" main shankar ke advait siddhant kaa saar saras kannada main prastut kiya gaya he
 Chikdevaraya himself was a good poet
 is yug main virshaiv mataavlambee bhakton evam kaviyon ne bhi naanaa prakaar ke granth rachakar kannada kii seva kii
 Some of these centuries are written in style
 vachan style ke atirikt kuch gadhy granth bhi likhe gaye or saangtya, tripadi, vrutt, champu, geet aadi chhandon kaa vishesh prayog kiya gaya
 But the number of pledges in this long period are numbered
 charitkavy prastut karanevaale virshaiv kaviyon main chamras, viroopaksh pandit or shadakshardev agraganya the
 Among the poems written by Chamaras, "prabhulingalele" is the best character
 "prabhulingalile" main allam prabhu ke jeevanavrutt kaa vistaar kiya gaya he
 Among the Veerashaiva poets, Chamaras are named after Harihara with respect for those who composed the best poetry of poetry
 viroopaksh pandit kaa likhaa hua chennabasav puraana bhi uttam prabandh kavy he, jisamen prasiddh virshaiv bhakt chennabasav kii kahani kahi gai he
 Harihara's "basavarajaragale" and Chamaras's "prabhulingalele" have not been able to do as well as "chennabasavapurana", as the beautiful syncretism of poetry and poetry is done
 pump yug main jain kaviyon ne apane shreshth prabandh kaavyon ke dwaara kannada main champustyli ko atyant lokapriy banaaya
 But later this style became less used
 kumarvyas yug main phir se yah style apanaai gai
 The poet who adopted it was not Veerashaiva but Jain
 17veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main shadakshardev naamak ek pratibhasampann virshaiv kavi ne champustyli main teen prabandh kavy rache jinke naam "rajasekharvilas", "shabarshankarvilas", tathaa "vrishabhendravijay" hai
 "rajashekharvilas" and "shabarshankarvilas", narrate stories related to Shivlila
 "vrishabhendravijay" kii kathavstu basav kaa jeevanavrutt he
 This era saw the incarnation of a great Veerashaiva saint
 unka asli naam kya tha, iskaa kuch pataa nahin laga he
 His literary surname was "omniscient"
 inhone "tripadi" naamak chand main apni amrit vaani sunai he
 Each stanza ends with the word "omniscient" and has an independent meaning like the couplets of Hindi
 is avadhi main jain dharm kaa prabhaav lupt ho chalaa tha
 Nevertheless, some Jain poetic poets served Kannada with their power
 jain kaviyon ne prachlit deshi kavyaneleyon main kavyrachana kii
 Among such poets, the names of Bhaskar, Terakanambi, Bommaras, Shishyamayana, Trithayamangaras, Salva Kavi and Ratnakarvarni are notable
 inamen ratnakarvarni sarvshereshth hai, jinaki kritiyon main "bharteshvaibhav" mukhya he
 The description of the bright characters of Bharat and Bahubali, the son of the first Tirthankar Adidev, is the story of "bharateshvaibhav"
 pant, harihar, kumarvyas jaise kannada ke mahakaviyon kii shrenee main ratnakarvarni kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he
 There were some good poets in the last of this era ie in the 19th century
 devchand naamak jain kavi ne "ramakathavatar" likhakar jain ramayana parampara ko aage badhaayaa
 Kempunarayana and Basavappa Shastri among the court poets of King Mummudi Krishnaraja Odier of Mysore created a conducive atmosphere for the production of drama literature in Kannada by presenting translations of some plays in Sanskrit and English
 kalidas ke shakuntal aadi naatakon kaa basavapp shastri ne itani safalataa se anuwaad kiya ki ve "abhinav kalidas" ke naam se prasiddh hue
 Kempunarayan wrote a historical novel titled "mudramanjush"
 nandavansh kii kahani isaki kathavstu he jisapar mudrarakshas kaa prabhaav lakshith hota he
 This is the first novel of Kannada
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main muddan naamak ek safal kavi hue jinhone teen saras kavy likhe : "adbhut ramayana", "rampattabhishek" or "ramashwamedh"
 "awesome Ramayana" and "ramashvamedha" are both prose texts
 inke gadhy kii yah visheshta he ki pracheen kannada kii praudhata evam madhurata ke saath-saath aadhunik kannada kii saralata kaa parichay miltaa he
 The late 19th century is very important in the history of Indian life
 chunki is samay samaan paristhitiyon tathaa prabhaavon se sara bhartiya jivan mathit tathaa andolit hua tha, at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik kannada sahitya kii gatividhi kii kahani anya pradeshik bhashaaon ke sahitya kii kahani se kuch bhinn nahin hai
 Modern Kannada literature can be divided into four main parts which are as follows: aadhunik kannada kaa pratham utthan gadhy ke saath prarambh hota he jiske nirmaan main isai mishnariyon kii seva ullekhneey he
 In 1809, the Reverend William Carey is said to have presented a translation of the Bible
 lagbhag 1831 main balneri tathaa mangalore main mishnariyon dwaara mudranalay sthapit kiye gaye jinke kaaran kannada granthon kii chapai main sahaayta mili
 Kannada Bible, published in 1823, is the first prose book of modern Kannada
 taduparant isai padariyon ne apane dharm ke prachaar ke hetu kannada main patrapatrikas prakashit karai jinamein "sabhaptr", "satyadipike", tathaa "karnataka" mukhya hai
 In the last three decades of the 19th century important work was done for the promotion of Kannada language and literature
 idhar dakshin karnataka main karnataka ke raajaaon ke protsaahan ke falswaroop karnataka main praachya pustkaalay tathaa udhar dharwar main karnataka vidyavardhak sangh kii sthapana hui
 The work of collecting, editing and publishing ancient inscriptions and manuscripts started on behalf of these two institutions

 narsinhachaar ne anathak praytn karke "di epigraphia karnatika" kaa baarah bhaagon main prakaashan karaayaa
 Rice edited an ancient grammatical treatise called "shantanushasan" of Bhattakunk and in his preface the outline of the history of Kannada literature was presented for the first time in English
 mangalore ke basel mishan ke tatwadhan main reverend eff
 kittal naamak ek german padri ne 18 varsh nirantar parishram karke kannada panditon ke sahyog se "kannada angreji brihatkosh" prakashit karaayaa, saath hi kannada ke pracheen granthon kaa sangrah evam sampadan kaary prarambh kiya
 In the same period text books were published by the University of Madras at Fort St
 College for the purpose of teaching Kannada
 is prakaar yadhyapi kannada bhashaa tathaa sahitya ke punaruddhar ke liye stuty udyog hua, to bhi skool kalejon main shiksha kaa madhyam angreji hone ke kaaran kannada ke prati janata main jaisaa aadar hona chahie tha vaisaa nahin utpann hua
 The period from 1900 to 1921 AD is a period of more definite and varied achievements
 pehali baar or
 narhinsaachaar ne san 1907 main kannada sahitya kaa ek brihat itihaas "karnataka kavicharite" teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya jisamen ek sahasr varsho ke kannada ke samast kaviyon tathaa unki kritiyon kaa pramanik itivrutt prastut ho gaya
 Although it cannot be said that poets and poetry have been evaluated in this history on the basis of modern criticism method, yet it is certain that a definite cornerstone by the "carnatic Kavichritte" for the study, teaching and research work of Kannada literature
 Was submitted san 1915 main i

 rice ne angreji main history ov canaries litarechar likhakar paashchaatya drushtikon se kannada saahatya ke adhyayan kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Thus in the first rise, Rice's publication of "the Epigraphia Carnatica" began the historical study of literature from a modern perspective and the creation of the "carnatic Poetry of Narcissism" set a definite backdrop for the critical study of the lives and works of Kannada writers
 Hui

 In the shelter of these two institutions, a new environment was presented for the promotion of Kannada language and literature

 At the same time, Khasi circles of poets were established in various parts of Karnataka, expressing the love of the earth and the full spirit of nationalism
 pragatha, visapika, geetikavy, sonet geet or bhajan, varnanaatmak kavita, khandakavy, virakavy, romance, darshanik kavita, gadhygit or swaagatbhaashan–ye or anya kavyavibhag utkrisht anand or ucch prerana se viksit hue
 Kuvenpu and Ambikatanayadatta can be called the best among the poets of this group in terms of depth, generality and magnitude of works

 Primarily Bendre has composed the song
 "gari", "sakhigit", "nadalile", "arul marul" unke geetsangrahon main mukhya hai
 The progressive movement which originated in 1930 had a profound impact on the literature of this time
 kavita ke kshetra main bhi nai shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 New verses and new compositions were established
 aadhunik kannada sahitya main choti kahani sabase adhik lokapriy he
 Maasti Venkatesh Iyengar is considered the father of modern Kannada story literature
 unki kahaniyon main darshaniktaa, deshbhakti, aitihaasikta, gramin jivan ke chitra, manovaigyanik vishleshan, paariwarik chithran aadi tatwon kaa bada hi sundar samavesh hua he
 From the point of view of the object and craft of the story, the development of Kannada story clearly shows this time

 Just as the original forms of Hindi drama literature and theater are found in the form of Ramlila, Krishnalila, Rasdhari mandalis, the original form of drama and theater of Kannada is found in the form of "yakshagana", "bayalat", "tammadale"
 yakshagan ke liye likhe gaye naatak praaia: padya main paae jate hai
 Singararya's "mitravinda Govind", written in 1680 under the ancient literature of Kannada, is considered the first drama of Kannada

 bahu majjarbud yaa multiple miloma plasma cells kaa cancer he
 Plasma cells are found in the bone marrow or bonmero and are the main soldiers of our defense system
 yah ek kaarkaana he jahaan khun main pai jane vaali sabhi koshikaayen taiyaar hoti hai
 The disease was defined in 1848
 rakshaatantr main kai tarah kii koshikaayen hoti hai jo saath mil kar sankraman yaa kisi bahari akraman kaa muqabla karti hai
 Lymphocytes are prominent among these
 ye mukhyatah do tarah kii hoti hai tii-cells or bi-cells
 When a bacterium invades the body, B-cells mature and form plasma cells
 ye plasma cells apni sataha par antibodies banaate hai, jo jeevanu se yuddh kar unka safaya karte hai
 Lymphocytes are found in many parts of the body such as the lymph node, the bonmero, the intestines, and the blood
 lekin plasma cells amuman bonmero main hi paae jate hai
 When plasma cells are cancerous, they uncontrollably begin to divide rapidly and take the form of a lump known as plasmacytoma
 yadi ek hi ganth banati he to ise isolated yaa solitary plasmacitama kehete hai, lekin yadi ek se adhik ganthe banati hai to ise multiple miloma kehete hai
 These lumps are mainly formed in the bone marrow
 multiple miloma main teji se badhate plasma cells bonmero main fail jate hai or duusari koshikaon ko badhane ke liye paryaapt jagah nahin mil paati he
 As a result, the population of other cells starts decreasing
 miloma ke pramukh lakshan creb nemonic dwaara yaad rakhe ja sakate hai

 There are two types of cells that work together to keep bones healthy and strong
 jahaan osteoblast koshikaayen naye asthi-utak banaati hai, vahiin osteoclast koshikaayen puraane asti-utak ko galane kaa kaam karti hai
 Myeloma cells secrete the osteoclast activating factor, which results in osteoclasts rapidly melting the bone

 Due to weak bones, their calcium also starts to melt and the calcium level in the blood increases
 asaamaanya or cancergrast plasma cells sankraman se ladane laayak antibodies banane main asamarth hote hai
 Therefore, they fail completely to protect the body
 miloma cells ek hi plasma cell kii anek carbon copies kii tarah hote hai or ye ek hi tarah kii monochlonal antibodies yaa m protein banaate hai
 This is a characteristic pathology of myeloma
 is protein ko peraprotein yaa m spike bhi kehete hai
 When the amount of this protein starts increasing in the bone marrow, the patient has many problems
 immunoglabulines protein chens 2 lambii or 2 choti se bane hote hai
 Sometimes kidneys excrete this m protein in urine
 peshaab main nikalne vaale is protein ko lite chen yaa bench jones protein kehete hai
 These can cause kidney damage

 The name of Hazrat Mahal was Muhammadi Khanum, and he was born in Faizabad, Awadh
 vah peshey se ek tawaayph thi or apane mata-pita dwaara beche jane ke baad kvaccin ke rup main shahi haram main le liya gaya tha

 jaisaa ki is naam se lag saktaa he, paryaavaran prabandhan kaa taatpary paryaavaran ke prabandhan se nahin he, balki aadhunik maanav samaaj ke paryaavaran ke saath sampark tathaa usapar padane vaale prabhaav ke prabandhan se he
 The three major issues affecting managers are politics, programs and resources
 paryaavaran prabandhan kii aavashyaktaa ko kai drushtikonon se dekha ja saktaa he
 a common idea and motivation behind environmental management is the concept of carrying capacity
 aasaan bhashaa main kahen to vahan kshamta kaa taatpary kisi vishesh paryaavarniya tantra dwaara apane bheetar jeevon kii adhiktam sankhya ko dhaaran karne kii kshamta se he
 Although many cultures historically had an understanding of the concept of carrying capacity, its origins lie in Malthusian theory
 atah, paryaavaran prabandhan kaa arth keval paryaavaran kii khatir uske sangrakshan se nahin, balki sampoorn maanav jati kii khatir paryaavaran ke sangrakshan se he
 This element of appropriate exploitation, that is, the best use of natural resources, can be seen in the eu's Water Guidelines
 paryaavaran prabandhan main jaev-bhautik vaataavaran ke sabhi ghatak shaamil hote hai, jivit tathaa mrit donon
 The reason for this is the mutually interconnected relationship between all living species and their habitats
 paryaavaran main maanav paryaavaran ke aapasi sambandh bhi shaamil hai, jaise ki saamaajik, saanskrithik or aarthik parivesh kaa jaev-bhautik vaataavaran ke saath sambandh
 Like all management functions, it also requires effective management, standards and systems
 paryaavaran prabandhan ke maanak yaa pranali yaa protocol, kisi upyukt maandand dwaara maape gaye paryaavarniya prabhaav ko kam karne kii cheshtaa karte hai
 The ISO 14001 standard is the most commonly used standard for environmental risk management and is closely associated with the European eco-management and Audit Scheme
 ek saamaanya auditing maanak ke rup main iesao 19011 maanak main ise gunvattta prabandhan ke saath jodne ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 Other environmental management systems are based on the ISO 14001 standard and many systems extend this in different ways: kuch anya ranneetiyaan bhi maujuud hai jo parformens audit tathaa purna cost acounting kaa istemaal karne vaali top-down management "pranaaliyon" ko viksit karne kii bajaay bhed karne ke saadhaaran tareekon par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, Ecological Intelligent Design divides products into consumable, service products or durable or non-toxic products that should not be bought by anyone, or many times customers do not even know they are buying them
 Huh
 aise avikrey utpaadon ko bazaar se baahar rakhkar kisi "pranali" kaa istemaal kiye bina hi behatar paryaavaran prabandhan ko praapt kar liya jaataa he
 Recent successes have led to the notion of "integrated management"
 isamen ek vyapak drushtikon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he or antahvishay moolyankan ke mahatv ko kam kiya jaataa he
