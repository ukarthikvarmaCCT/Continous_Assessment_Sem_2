 Blast furnaces are considered to be different from bloomery in that the purpose of a blast furnace is to produce molten metal that can be extracted from the furnace through the tap, while the purpose of blumery is to keep it from melting so that the carbon does not dissolve in the iron
 Go Blumery also artificially blows air using a blower, but the term "blast furnace" is generally reserved for furnaces where iron is refined from the ore

 The hot blast temperature can range from 900 ° c to 1300 ° C, depending on the design and condition of the stove
 unke taapmaana sahane kii kshamta 2000 degree celsius se 2300 degree celsius tak ho sakati he
 Oil, alkatara, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can be added to the furnace at the tier level to release the additional energy required to increase productivity
 pighale hue lohe kaa utpaadan karne vaali mukhya rasinic pratikriya is prakaar he: This reaction can be divided into multiple phases of which the preheated blast air flowing into the furnace as the first phase reacts with carbon in the form of coke resulting in the production of carbon mono oxide and heat: garm carbon mono oxide louh ayask ko kam karne vaala kaarak he or yah aayran oxide ke saath pratikriya karke pighale hue lohe or carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan karata he
 Iron is converted into several phases depending on the temperature of different parts of the furnace
 bhatti ke sabase upree bhaag main jahaan taapmaana aam taur par 200 degree celsius or 700 degree celsius ke bich hota he, aayran oxide ko aayran aayran oxide, fe3o4 main badal diya jaataa he
 At a temperature of about 850 ° C, the iron is converted to iron oxide in a bit more like below: taji bhojya saamagree ke rup main bhatti se hokar guzarane vaali hawa main maujuud nitrogen, garm carbon dioxide or apratikriya vaali carbon monooxide pratikriya kshetra main pravesh karti he
 When these gases move downstream, the unfavorable-current gases heat the feed charge as well as convert limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: jab aayran oxide 1200 degree celsius tak ke ucchtar taapmaana vaale kshetra main pravesh karti he to yah aage chalakar louh dhaatu main parinat ho jaataa he: The carbon dioxide produced in this process converts to carbon mono oxide again with the help of coke
 bhatti ke gasiy vaataavaran ko niyantrit karne vaali mukhya pratikriya ko baudward pratikriya kaha jaataa he: The process of limestone decomposition in the central areas of the furnace proceeds according to the following reaction: apghaton dwaara nirmit calcium oxide lohe main maujuud vibhinn amleey ashuddhiyon ke saath pratikriya karke ek faiyalitic dhaatumal kaa nirmaan karti he jo anivaary rup se calcium silicket, casio3 he: The "pig iron" manufactured by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of about 4 to 5 percent, making it very brittle and used for limited and immediate commercial purposes
 kuch pig aayran kaa istemaal cast aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Most pig iron manufactured by blast furnaces undergo an additional process to reduce carbon content and to manufacture various level steel used for tools and construction materials

 All of them guided the Council with a deep commitment to the philosophy and work of the Council
 parishad inase nirdesh paakar, inke gyaan or buddhi se atyadhik labhanvit hui
 The Council basically performs its functions through its Inquiry Committees, and adjudicates the complaints received from Brex against the press for violations of journalistic rules or by the authorities for interfering in the freedom of the press
 parishad main shikaayat darj karne kii niyat prakriya he
 It is compulsory for a complainant to write to the editor of the defendant newspaper and to direct their attention to the offense of violation of journalistic policy or against public interest
 shikaayat kiye gayi maamle kii parishad ko kataran bhejne ke atirikt shikayatakarta ke liye yah ghona karnaa aavashyak he ki unhone apni sampurna jaankaree tathaa vishwaas ke anusaar parishad ke samaksh sampurna tathy prastut kar diye hai tathaa shikaayat main kathith kisi viy main kisi nyaayalay main koi maamla lambit nahin he or vah ki yadi parishad ke sammukh jaanch lambit hone ke dauraan shikaayat main kathith koi maamla nyaayalay kii kisi kaarywahi kaa viy ban jaataa he to ve tatkaal isaki soochna parishad ko denge
 The reason for this declaration is that in view of Section 14, 3, of the Act, the Council cannot take action in any matter which is sub judice
 yadi adhyaksh mahoday ko aisa lagata he ki jaanch ke paryaapt aadhaar nahin he, to shikaayat khaarij kar, parishad ko isaki report kar sakate hai, anyathaa samachaarpatr ke sampadak athwa sambaddh patrkaar se kaaran bataane ke liye kaha jaataa he ki unke viruddh kaarywahi na kii jaye
 On receipt of a written statement and other relevant material from the editor or journalist, the Secretariat of the Council places the matter before the Inquiry Committee
 jaanch samiti vistaar se shikaayat kii jaanch or pareekshan karti he
 If required, it asks for other details or documents from both parties
 partiyon ko vyaktigat rup se upasthit hone athwa kanoonee peshewar sahit apane praadhikrut pratinidhiyon ke madhyam se jaanch samiti ke sammukh sakshya dene kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 On the basis of the available facts and affidavits or oral evidence given to the Inquiry Committee, the Committee prepares its achievements and recommendations and puts it before the Council which may accept or reject them
 jahaan parishad santut hoti he ki ek samachar patr athwa samachar agency ne patrakarita niti ke staron athwa janaruchi kaa ulanghan kiya he athwa ek sampadak athwa shramjivi patrkaar ne vyavsaayik kadachaar kiya he, to parishad jaisi sthiti ho, samachapatr, samachar agency, sampadak athwa patrkaar kii parininda, bhartsana kar sakati he athwa unhen chetavanee de sakati he athwa unke aacharan kaa anumodan kar sakati he
 In the complaints lodged by the press against the authorities, the Council is empowered to make such comments as it deems fit in relation to the conduct of any authority, including the government
 parishad ke nirnay antim hote he or kisi vidhi nyaayalay main unpar aapatti nahin kii ja sakati
 Thus, the council has a lot of moral authority
 yadhyapi iske paas kanoonee rup se dene ke liye dandatmak adhikaar nahin he
 The Inquiry Regulations formulated by the Council give the Speaker the authority to take original action or issue notice to any party in relation to any matter falling within the purview of the Press Council Act
 saamaanya jaanch ke liye shikayatakarta dwaara parishad ke sammukh ek shikaayat darj kerani hoti he, iske alaava mul kaarywahi ke liye kaaphi had tak vahi prakriya hoti he jaisaaki saamaanya jaanch main hoti he
 To carry out its functions or to conduct an inquiry under the Act, the Council exercises certain powers vested in the Civil Court to investigate a case under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in relation to the following matters
 logon ko samman karne or upasthiti hetu dabaav daalane tathaa shapath dekar unka pareekshan karne hetu
 For the need to search and inspect documents
 shapathpatron par sakshya kii prapti hetu
 To demand any government record or copies of it from any court or office
 gavaahon athwa dastavejon ke pareekshan hetu kamishan jari karnaa or Any other matter, as specified
 parishad apana kaary karne ke liye partiyon se sahyog kii aashaa karti he
 In at least two cases, where the Council noticed that the parties were totally uncooperative or obstinate, the Council, under section 15 of the Act to compel them to appear before it and or to compel them to give records etc

 ek samachaarpatr, jise parishad dwaara teen baar parinindit kiya gaya tha, ke maamle main kuch avadhi hetu dak kii riyayati daron athwa akhabaari kaagaj ke vitaran, vigyapanon, manyata ke rup main kuch suvidhaayen or riyaayaten na dene par sambaddh praadhikariyon se sifarish karne kaa parishad ko adhikaar diye jane ke liye, parishad ne 1980 main adhinium main sanshodhan kaa prastaav kiya tha
 Approval of the Council's recommendation was made mandatory by the authorities
 iske atirikt parishad kaa vichaar tha ki, samachaarpatron ke maamalon ke samaan press parishad adhinium 1978 kii dhara 15 ke antargat, sarkaar sahit kisi praadhikaran ke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue apane kinhin nirnyon athwa reporto main, aisi tippaniyan, jaisi vah uchit samajhe, karne ke parishad ke adhikaar main aise praadhikariyon ko chetavanee dene, unki bhartsana karne athwa unhen parinindit karne ke adhikaar bhi shaamil hona chahie or yah ki, is sambandh main parishad kii tippanyon ko sansad ke donon sadanon or athwa sambaddh rajya ke vidhaan ke sammukh rakhaa janaa chahie
 In 1987, the Council reconsidered the matter and after detailed deliberations decided to withdraw the motion for punitive rights as it was reconsidered in the present circumstances to curb the freedom of the press by the authorities
 Could be misused
 tabhi se, baar-baar, suzav sandarbh parishad ko diye gayi hai ki chookkarta samachaarpatron / patrakaron ko dand dene ke liye parishad ke paas dandatmak adhikaar hone chahie
 In response to this, the Council has consistently thought that the moral rights given to it under the existing scheme of the Act are sufficient
 oktober 1992 main nai dilli main press paridon ke antarratreey sammelan main apane udghaatan bhaashan main soochna or prasaaran kendriya mantri dwaara yah suzav doharaaya gaya, parantu parishad nen nimnilikhit kaarnon se ise sarv sammati se asweekaar kar diya - If the Council were empowered to punish / impose a penalty, it would be similar to the right to punish, which would only apply if complaints were made by the press against the government and its authorities
 sarthak dand dene kaa adhikaar kai maamalon ko uthaata he jinamein k, pramaan kaa daayitv, kha, pramaan kaa str, ga, kanoonee pratinidhitiv kaa adhikaar or laagat or gha, samiksha or athwa apil uplabdh hogi athwa nahin, shaamil hai
 All or any of these cases may have an effect against the basic premise that press communications provide a democratic, effective, and inexpensive facility for the hearing of complaints and that the resulting imperative will be that press offices result in formality, cost And access will become courts of known problems and exercising judicial authority and delay equally The basic purpose of the Press Council will fail
 disambar 1992 main, parishad ko kendriya sarkaar se ek patr praapt hua jisamen is viy par parishad ke vichaar maange gayi ki kya yah sunishchat karne ke liye ki, sampradayik lekhon ke sambandh main morganirdeshon ke ulanghan hetu press parishad dwaara parinindit samachaarpatron / patrikaon ko sarkaar se milane vaale protsaahan jaise vigyaapan aadi se vanchit rakhaa ja saktaa he, koi prakriya nirdit kii ja sakati he or kya press parishad yah suzav dene kii sthiti main hogi ki jab yah ek samachaarpatr / patrika ko morganirdeshon ke ulanghan kaa doshi tehraati he tab kya kaarywahi kii jaani chahie
 The Council, in its meeting of June 93, considered the matter in light of the stand taken by it in the past against giving punitive powers to the Council
 maamle par gaharaai se vichaar karne par, parishad ne anubhav kiya ki is samay parishad dwaara jis naitik adhikaar kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, vah kaaphi prabhavi he or press ko aatm niyaman kaa maarg dikhaane main dandatmak adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 However, the Council decided that if a newspaper is circulated twice for any kind of immoral writing in three years, then copies of such decisions are sent to the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India and the Chief Secretary to the concerned State Government, for information and such action, They should be sent as they deem fit in their discretion and the circumstances of the case
 parishad ne nirnay kiya ki teen varshon kii avadhi ko duusari baar parininda kii taarikh se ulte ginate hue purvavarti teen varshon ke rup main liya jaayegaa
 Newspapers in accordance with the higher expenditure levels for the assistance and guidance of news workers to the Council by Section 13 2A of the Press Council Act, 1978; Instructions have been given to make a code of conduct for news agencies and journalists
 aisi samhita bananaa ek sakriy kaary he jise samay or ghatnaon ke saath kadam se kadam milaanaa hoga
 The creation indicates that the Code should be prepared by the Press Council through its decisions on the basis of matters
 parishad dwaara janaruchi or patrakarita niti ke ulanghan shirk ke antargat bhartiya vidhi santhaan ke saath milakar pehle var 1984 main apane nirnyon / morganirdeshon ke jariye vyapak siddhaton kaa sangrah taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 This compilation of principles has been chosen from the decisions or awards of the Council or the guidelines issued by it or by it or by its chairman
 var 1986 main, sarkaar or iske praadhikariyon ke viruddh shikayaton athwa maamalon, joki doorgaati or mahatvapurn prakruti ke the or jisamen sarkaar sahit kisi praadhikari ke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue tippaniyan shaamil thim, main nirnyon or siddhanton se sambaddh press kii swatantraaa kaa ulanghan sheershak ke antargat sankalan kaa doosraa bhaag prakashit kiya gaya
 Since the year 1986, there has been a continuous increase in the establishment of complaints and their disposal by the Press Council, including the quick process of Code creation
 1992 main parishad ne patrakarita niti nirdeshika prastut kii jisamen parishad dwaara jari morganirdeshon or nirnyon se chhantakar liye gayi patrakarita niti siddhant hai
 Since the Council has since made several very important decisions concerning the rights and obligations of the press, a 162-page, detailed and comprehensive second edition of the Guidelines has been issued
 isamen niztaa ke adhikaar kii sankalpana bhi di gai he or is sambandh main tathaa maghadirshan hetu ucch vyavsaayik staro ke anuroop samachar patronkiye jane vaale morganirdesh bhi vinirdit kiye gayi he
 Defamation law has also been supported in some aspects of it to guide the press, public servants and popular figures
 parishad ne nagarpalika samiti ke saarvajanik padaadhikariyon kii kathith manahani ke sambandh main mahatvapurn adhinirnay diya ki press athwa media ke viruddh nuksaan hetu kaarywahi kaa upachaar, sarkari padaadhikariyon ko unki sarkari duty ke nirvaah se sambaddh unke kaaryon or aacharan ke sambandh main saadharantaya uplabdh nahin he, chaahe prakaashan aise tathyon or vaktavyon par aadhaarit ho joki satya na ho, jab tak ki padaadhikari yah sthapit na kare ki prakaashan, satya kaa aadar or parvaah na karte hue, kiya gaya tha
 In such a case, it would be sufficient for a member of the defense media or the press to prove that they acted after proper verification of facts, it is not necessary for them to prove that what they have written is true
 parantu jahaan yah siddh hota he ki prakaashan durbhaavna athwa vyakt vair se pravrutt or jhootha he, vahaan bachaav paksh ke liye koi bachaav nahin hoga or nuksaan hetu uttaradaayi hoga
 However, in a case which is not related to the discharge of their duties, a public official gets the same protection as any other citizen
 haalaanki nyaayapalika, sansad or rajya vidhanmandal is niyam kaa apwaad hai kyonki purvavarti isaki avamaanama hetu dand ke adhikaar se surakshit he or uttarvarti samvidhan ke anuchhed 105 or 194 ke antargat vishedhikaron se surakshit he
 The Council has further stated that this does not mean that the Official Secrets Act, 1923 or any similar enactment or provision which has the legal power, cannot control the press or the media
 yah bhi diya gaya he ki aisa koi kanoon nahin he joki press / media par purv niyantran rakhane athwa varjit rakhane kaa rajya athwa iske adhikariyon ko adhikaar detaa ho
 In relation to the public official's claim of privacy, the Council has specified that if the public official's privacy and his personal conduct, habits, personal functions and characteristics of character, which conflict or relate to the proper discharge of his official duty, If there is a conflict between the right to know and to know, then the predecessor should bow to the latter
 haalaanki, vyaktigat niztaa ke maamalon main, joki unki shaskeey dyati ke nirvaah se sambaddh nahin he, saarvajanik padaadhikari ko vahi suraksha milti he joki kisi anya naagarik ko milti he
 This guideline suggests a path of safety and responsibility overall through legal, ethical and ethical problems that everyday newspaper owners, journalists, editors oppose
 morganirdeshika akatya siddhanton kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen vyapak saamaanya siddhant hai, joki prayek maamle kii paristhiti ko dekhte hue samuchit vivek or anukulan ke saath lagu kiye jate he, to ve vyavsaayik eemaandaaree ke maarg sahit patrakaron ko unke vyavsaay ke sanchaalan ko aatm-sanyamit karne main unki sahaayta karenge
 By no means is it exhausting, nor is it strictly intended to impede the free work of the press
 patrakarita ke staron or press kii swatantraaa donon ke bare main vibhinn vishyon par apane nirnay ke silsile main parishad dwaara viksit kiye gayi kuch brihd siddhanton ko sankshipt rup main nimnanusaar diya gaya he
 Abusive and provocative attacks should not be carried out on sects and individuals
 afvaahon par aadhaarit sampradayik ghatnaon par koi bhi samachar patrakarita niti kaa ulanghan hoga
 Similarly, it would not be correct to report malformed making significant omissions
 jahaan shantipurna or kanoonee tareeke se kisi sampradaay kii sahi shikaayat ko dur karne ke iraade se is ore dhyanakrit karnaa press kaa vaid kaary he, vahiin shikayaton kii khoj / athwa inhen badha chadhaakar nahin dena chahie vishe sp se un shikayaton ko, jinamein sampradayik vaimnasy badhaane kii kshamta ho
 It will be highly beneficial in creating a healthy and peaceful environment if sensational provocative and dangerous headlines are dropped and acts of violence or vandalism are reported in such a way that people's trust in the law and order of the state is not reduced and with it -with this, it has the effect of discouraging and condemning such works
 ek sampradaay ko badnaam karnaa gambhir maamla he or ise ratr-virdohi gatividhi bataanaa ninda hoga or yah patrakarita asangati ke samaan he
 There is no inconsistency in publishing historical facts to warn the present generation against repeating past mistakes even if these mistakes are not of interest to a particular sect
 dharmik sampradaayon ke bare main vaktavy dene main koi aapatti nahin he yadi ye sanyamit bhashaa main diye jate hai or galat athwa badha-chadhaakar nahin diye jate hai
 Some of the principles developed by the Council through its decisions regarding the improper use of journalism are vishwaas main lekar darshaya gaya athwa vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya koi maamla, strot kii sahmati liye bina prakashit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 If the editor feels that the publication is in the public interest, then he should clarify in the appropriate footnote that the relevant statement or discussion was being published even though it was unofficially given
 ek vigyaapan jisamen kuch bhi gaiyr-kanoonee athwa avaidh ho athwa joki sadruchi athwa patrakarita niti athwa auchity ke vipareet ho, prakashit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Due care should be taken to maintain accuracy in relation to citations by newspapers
 jahaan ek samachaarpatr par patrakarita niti ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he, yah tark ki usne prakaashan band kar diya he, sampadak kaa bachaav nahin hoga kyonki unka aacharan hi shikaayat kaa viy he
 The meaning of interest also varies according to the context
 patrkaar ke liye iskaa arth he ki jise shaleenta athwa auchity ke aadhaar par unhen prakashit nahin karnaa chahie
 Where there is a tendency to incite sexual feelings in a case, its publication in the magazine will be undesirable for the public, young or old
 janaruchi ko baataavaran, paristhiti ke saath samasamyik samaaj main vidyaman ruchi kii dharanaon ke saath parkhaa janaa chahie
 The basic test of obscenity is whether the case is so vulgar that it can spoil or confuse the character
 anya pareekshan yah he ki kya prayukt bhashaa or drishy kaa chitrankan ganda, ashleel, aruchikar athwa kaamuk samajha ja saktaa he
 Whether a story is obscene or not will depend on factors such as the literary or cultural nature of the magazine and the level of social justice
 ek patrika athwa samachaarpatr ke viengat maamle kii pikchar kaa is prashn se sambandh hota he ki kya prakashit kiya gaya maamla janaruchi ke staron se kam he athwa nahin
 One of the test factors of whether a picture is less than public interest will be the nature or purpose of the magazine - whether it is related to art, painting, drug research, or sexual improvisation
 press parishad ne mudran media main ashleel vigyapanon ke badhate hue udaahranon par chintaa vyakt kii
 It was against censorship but before publication, preventive measures for checking any obscene material were supported
 chunki aise adhiktar vigyaapan, vigyaapan agenciyon ke jariye diye jate hai, parishad ne yah mahasoos kiya ki yah kaary kathin nahin hoga yadi ye agenciyaan aise vigyapanon, joki ek ausatan naagarik dwaara parivaar main dekhte hue aapattijanak samajha jaye, ko taiyaar or jari karte samay adhik saavdhaanee or samay baraten
 He felt that the Association of Advertising Agencies of India would be able to play a very important and positive role in the matter as a patron organization of all these advertising agencies and demanded their cooperation in not giving advertisements which would in due time bring the socio cultural values of the country There is a possibility of damage
 parishad ne samachaarpatron se bhi apil kii ki yen vigyaapan daataaon se pratyakshtaya athwa vigyaapan agenciyon se praapt hone vaale vigyapanon kii saavdhaneepurvak jaanch karen or ashleel tathaa aapattijanak samajhe jane vaale vigyapanon ko asweekaar karke aatm sanyam baraten
 He also reiterated the following guidelines made by himself against the objected publication
 samachaarpatron ko aise vigyaapan nahin dene chahie joki ashleel hon athwa mahila ko nagnavastha main darshaate hue purushon kii kaamuktha ko uttejit kare jaise ki vah swayan bikri kii vastu ho
 Whether a photograph is obscene or not should be tested in relation to the three tests, namely 1, kya yah ashleel or aashaaleen he, 2, is it only a piece of pornographic writing, 3, kya is prakaashan kaa uddeshy kevalmaatr aise logon main, jinke bich ise parichaalit karne kaa iraadaa he, tathaa kishoron kii yon bhaawanaaon ko uttejit karke paisa kamanaa he
 In other words, is it a harmful exploitation for commercial gain
 anya sambaddh vichaar yogya viy yah he ki ky tasviir patrika ke vishaygat maamle se sambaddh he
 That is to say, whether its publication art, painting, medicine, research or sexual reform fulfills the pre-contemplation of any social or public purpose
 mul siddhant joki is viy par vibhinn adhinirnyon se nikalataa he, patron ke prakaashan main sampadak ke swanirnay kaa samarthan karata he
 However, they are expected to correct the wrong statement or report on a matter of public nature
 jaanane ke saarvajanik adhikaar ke aadhaar par aam pathak vaid adhikaar kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 In addition, any person who has been made a reference in the publication, can automatically claim the right of reply in the columns of the newspaper
 yadi parishad ko yah adhikaar nahin he ki vah ek samachaarpatr ko pratyuttar prakashit karne ke liye baadhya kare, yah samachaarpatr ko iske viruddh jaanch padtaal kaa vivaran prakashit karne ke nirdesh de sakati he
 Verification of news is necessary before publication, especially when the report contains derogatory or written defamatory surpluses or it can cause communal tension, nor can the circumstances justify the publication of rumors as another class of people
 Can
 jab bhi kisi jhuthe athwa vikrut prakaashan par sampadak kaa dhyanakrit kiya jaataa he, to unhen aavashyak sanshodhan karne chahie
 Under the second exception of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, respecting a person or his character in the conduct of public works of a public servant, as far as his character appears in that conduct, nothing else, goodwill It is not defamatory to express opinions in tadnusaar parishad kii raay he ki janajivan par uchit tippaneeyon / ko anuchit nahin kaha ja saktaa parantu yadi koi tathyaatmak vaktavy diye jate hai, to ve satya or sahi hone chahie
 If there is a defamatory element attached, then there will be no goodwill defense in any kind of civil proceedings for damages
 bhartiya press parishad ne lokapriy vyaktiyon ke niztaa ke adhikaar or saarvajanik hit tathaa saarvajanik mahatv kii soochna tak pahunchne ke press ke adhikaar ke madhya santulan praapt karne ke liye morganirdesh banaaye hai
 The heated debate at the national and international level and the Conference of the World Union of Press Councils in Delhi in April 1998 emphasized that there is a need to reconcile the three competing constitutional values in this regard, namely: k, ek vyakti kaa niztaa kaa adhikaar, B, freedom of press and ga, janhit main lokapriy vyaktiyon ke bare main jaanane kaa logon kaa adhikaar
 The council has prepared a report on this matter and has made guidelines as follows - niztaa kaa adhikaar anullaghanneey maanavadhikaar he
 However the degree of privacy varies from position to person and from person to person
 saarvajanik vyakti joki janata ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaary karte hai, privet vyakti ke samaan niztaa kii vahi degree paane kii aashaa nahin kar sakate
 Their work and conduct is in public interest
 janhit, janata kii ruchi se alag rakhaa ja rahaa he, yadi privet bhi kiye jaayen, tab bhi press ke madhyam se logon kii jaankaree main laaye jaayen
 Accordingly, it is the duty of the press to ensure that information about such actions and conduct of public interest is obtained in the right manner, to be properly verified and subsequently given accurate reports
 laagon kii nigaah se dur kiye kaaryon ke bare main soochna praapt karne ke liye, press se nigaraanee vaale tareeke kii aashaa nahin kii jaati he
 While it is expected that the public will not be harassed, the popular public is also expected to bring more openness in their functioning and press duty to inform the public about the actions of their representatives
 Help the press to complete k samachaarpatr athwa ve log, joki sampadakeey ke rup main isse jude hue hai athwa management main he, par samachaarpatr main abhivyakt kii gayi raay ke liye un par dabaav daalane athwa unhen bhayadohit karne ke iraade se hamalaa press kii swatantraaa main ghor hastkshep he

 The council has issued guidelines and recommended policy framework on various matters related to press and people
 iske atirikt jahaan kahin bhi gambhir sthiti paidaa hui jisamen press se sanyam or saavdhaanee ke saath kaary karne kii aashaa kii gai vahaan parishad ke adhyaksh, vaktavyon ke madhyam se press kaa maargdarshan karte rahe hai
 Whenever well-planned major attacks were carried out, they also reacted sharply through such statements
 1969 main, parishad ne sampradayik sambandhon se sambaddh maamalon par reporting or tippaniyan karne main niyamon or staron ko nirdit karte hue 10-sutri morganirdesh jari kiye
 Without elaborating, it was listed and clarified in the guidelines that what would be objectionable against journalistic justification and policy, therefore, should be avoided
 sanlagnak bi, kha, Looking at the events of Ayodhya again in 1990, the Council issued another 12-point guidelines in light of the new experience, repeating the 1969 guidelines
 parishad ne kaha ki isamen rekhaankit siddhant prashikshan kii avasthaa se lekar media ke prayek str par antarnivit kiye jane chahie
 These principles Annex B-2 specified both the press and the state to do some work and not do anything
 parishad ne pichley varshon main ratrpati, pradhanmantri aadi ke videshi daure par unke saath jane ke liye patrakaron ke chayan, vigyapanon akhabaari kagaz, manyata ke niyamon jaise kuch viyon ke bare main niti ruparekha kaa nirmaan kiya he
 As discussed earlier, the Council, after the decision taken at its meeting in October 1982, gave two compilations of its awards, outlining the awards at the end of the same set of cases, giving principles in violation of journalistic policy and freedom of the press
 Published on the violation

 in adhinirnyon ke adhyayan se yah pataa chalata he ki parishad, na keval press thi swatantraaa kaa sangrakshan karne balki yah sunishchat karne kii, patrakarita kaa str banaae rakhaa jaye or usamen sudhaar karne jaise apane lakshyon ko praapt karne ke prayaason main bhi nirvivaad rup se sapal rahi he
 While the press, after the intervention of the council, the authorities have been seen, generally, not to put undue pressure on the press, the press personnel have also restrained themselves from the kind of journalism that is expected of them, to the level Could reduce it
 parishad kaa naitik prabhaav vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The huge increase in the number of complaints from 80 in 1979 to 1075 in 1997, the need, importance and functioning of the council-like organization to control newspapers is a sufficient proof of the confidence expressed by both media personnel and the public in the functioning
 niyamit shikayaton par jaanch ke atirikt parishad ne kai baar vishe jaanch adhiktar mul kaarywahi kii he, parantu kabhi-kabhi press se sambaddh ghatnaon or maamalon kii shikayaton kii jaanch bhi kii he
 After a complaint by Mr
 Gautam Das, the editor of Daily Desher Katha, a Bengali newspaper from Garatla, Tripura, that the Congress Council workers continued to carry out violent attacks on their newspaper sellers and employees, the Press Council formed a special committee to properly investigate the site
 is
 samiti ne agartala kaa daura kiya or shikayatakarta tathaa tripura sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ko suna
 As a result, the Tripura government assured that they would take all necessary steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents and provide full security to Deshar Katha
 1990 main ayodhya kii ghatnaon par tathaa 1992 main anya par vishe jaanch kii gai
 Their reports were made public in 1991 and 1993 respectively
 pratham jaanch main, parishad ne chaar uttar pradesh dainik jaagran, aaj, swatantra bharat or swatantra chetana ko aisi reporte, jinhone patrakarita niti niyamon kaa ghor ulanghan kiya, prakashit karne kaa do paaya
 The Council censured these newspapers for violating the rules
 parishad ne uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara sthiti se nipatane main kai trutiyon or press ke prati iske vyavhaar ko lekar isaki aalochana bhi kii
 Jagran challenged this decision of the Council before the Allahabad High Court, which is pending
 inhone praadhikariyon dwaara paristhiti kii maang se adhik dandatmak or nivarak kaarywahi kaa aashray lene par chintaa vyakt kii or avidhyman press aapattijanak maamalon adhinium 1951 ke upbandhon ke aahvaan or press evam pustak pujikaran adhinium 1867 ke upbandho ke durupyog par shok prakat kiya
 Reports of several attacks on journalists / press media photographers / cameraman who were covering the events of Ayodhya and its surroundings on 6-12-92 in Ayodhya on 6-12-1992
 She came
 chunki yah atyadhik mahatv or chintaa kaa maamla tha, parishad ke adhyaksh mahoday kii adhyakshata main maamle kii jaanch hetu vishesh jaanch samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Earlier, the Speaker had already issued an appeal urging restraint and control on behalf of the press, presenting comments on communal relations and reporting incidents
 iske saath-saath, unhone patrakaron par us samay, jab ve apane vyavsaayik karttavya kaa nirvaah karte hue ghatnaon ko cover karne kii koshish kar rahe hon, hamalon kii ghatnaon par chintaa vyakt kii
 He also appealed to the authorities to ensure that the press is allowed to work freely and boldly for the dissemination of information on matters of public importance
 vishesh samiti ne dinaank 14-12-92 ke aadesh ke jariye ayodhya, faijabad, lakhanu or dilli kii apni baithkon main maukhik or likhit sakshya ekatrit kiye dinaank 7-1-93 ko purna parishad ke sammukh apni report di
 The report accepted by the Council was issued on 8-1-1993

 He suggested a series of criteria to effectively answer various perspectives of the situation

 In the report on the increasing incidence of pressures / impediments and attacks on journalists in the path of independent functioning of the press in Bihar, which the Council accepted on 31 March 1993, the press and authorities were advised to establish their relations more healthy
 aids and di media par report main media dwaara kuch kaary karne or kuch na karne nirdit kiye gayi or unhen paraamarsh diya gaya ki chhitput samachar se aids avashya hi prachaar kaa lakshya hona chahie
 At the same time, the press must keep in mind that the public interest which can justify the publication of a case under the protection of personal privacy should be a legitimate interest and not an inquisitive or perverse curiosity
 june 1993 kii ek anya report jiskaa shirk pan red snord kalam or talwaar tha, main raksha se sambaddh soochna main adhik khulepan ke ravaiye kaa samarthan kiya gaya
 The latest report of the Council on threats to the media from militant organizations in Jammu and Kashmir recommended immediate dissemination of information at the government level to counter militant propaganda
 report ne media karmiyon ko, joki swatantra ruukh apnaane par ugravadiyon se dhamkiyon kaa saamana karte hai, ko sansthaneey or kshetreey suraksha pradaan karne hetu sarkaar ko bhi paraamarsh diya he
 In the year 1994, the Council formulated a uniform advertising policy for implementation across India
 yah vigyaapan hetu praadhikariyon dwaara namika main darj karne ke liye samachaarpatron ke anumodan ke liye kasuti pradaan karti he
 The idea of the Press Council of India, after considering the question of the desirability or otherwise of publication of the achievements of pre-poll surveys and the purpose to be fulfilled by them, is to allow newspapers to use their platform for manipulation and distortions in elections
 Should not be given and should not allow its own exploitation by the partisan parties
 atah pre parishad kaa paraamarsh he ki hamaare jaise adarsh loktantr main chunaav prakriya kii sangeen sthiti ko dekhte hue samachaarpatron ko sajag rahanaa chahie ki unke bahumoolya manch kaa chunaav ke herpher or vikrumiyon ke liye istemaal na kiya jaye
 Today it is necessary to emphasize this because the alleged pre-poll surveys such as the use of wrong methods as well as the complicated and incisive propaganda on ethnic, religious and moral grounds to confuse and mislead the interested voters and groups The demand for printing media is increasing
 jahaan kai maamalon main sampradayik or rajdrohatmak prachaar kaa pataa lagaana kathin nahin hoga vahiin matdaan purv surveykshan kaa pakshpaati upyog, kabhi-kabhi jaanboojhkar kiya gaya, ko prakat karnaa utana aasaan nahin he
 Therefore, the Press Council suggests that whenever newspapers publish pre-poll surveys, those organizations that have conducted such surveys, individuals and organizations that have conducted the survey, the size-type of the selected sample for the test results
 The method of selection and indicating the possible scope of error in the test result should be given to them in the preamble clearly

 2, iske atirikt matdaan kii tarikhon ke davadol hone par media ko pehle hi ho chuke pasch-matdaan surveykshan dete hue dekha jaataa he
 There is a possibility of influencing the voters where polling is yet to begin
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki chunaav prakriya ko vishuddh rakhaa gaya he or matadaataaon ke mastik ko bahya karkon dwaara prabhavit nahin kiya gaya he, yah aavashyak he ki media antim matdaan tak pasch matdaan surveykshan prakashit na kare
 3, therefore, the Press Council requests the press to follow the following guidelines regarding post-voting
 antim matdaan samaapt hone tak koi bhi samachaarpatr, pasch matdaan surveykshan, chaahe ve kitne bhi sahi hon, prakashit nahin karegaa
 D, Construction of guidelines for financial journalists by Press Council of India bhartiya press parishad ne reportron / vittiya patrakaron / samachaarpatr pratithaanon ko paraamarsh diya he ki ve nakad athwa kisi bhi prakaar ke uphaar / anudaan / riyaayaten / suvidhaayen aadi, jinamein vittiya maamalon par swatantra or nipaksh reporting ke saath samjhauta karne kii sambhaavna ho, na len
 2, the Council observed in its report that financial journalists greatly affect the readers' minds, so it is their responsibility to balance the states, future, financial transactions of a company and give objective views
 inhone avlokan kiya ki kuch companiyon ke samachaarpatron / patrikaon main atyadhik samachar diye jate he kyonki unhone us mudran media ko vigyaapan jari kiye hai
 Sometimes adverse reports are published of companies that do not advertise to newspapers or magazines
 punah jab kisi bhi kaaran se media kisi company / management se khush na ho, to company ke nakaaratmak pahaluon ko ujagar kiya jaataa he, jabaki iske viparaat, kinhi nakaaratmak pahaluon ko prakaash main nahin laayaa jaataa
 Some companies are also known for receiving positive reports from some financial journalists in support of companies, giving them gifts, loans, rebates, primary shares etc
 is ke saath-saath aise galat kaaryon ke virudv janamat banane athwa niveshkon kii shiksha ke liye koi saadhan nahin he
 3, The Council, concerned about malpractices in the regular sector, after detailed discussions with representative financial institutions and journalists, recommended the following guidelines for financial journalists to observe
 1, vittiya patrakaron ko uphaar, rin daure, chhot, praathmik share aadi joki unki pojishan se samjhauta karte hon, athwa samjhaute kii sambhaavna ho, ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chahie

 3, jab ek company kii vyavastha kaa daura karne ke liye daure pryojit kiye jate hai, report ke lekhak, jinhone daure kaa laabh uthaaya he, ko yah avashya ullekh karnaa chahie ki sambaddh company dwaara daura pryojit kiya gaya tha or yah ki inhone yathasthiti aatithy bhi kiya
 4
 Without verifying the facts from the company, no case related to the company should be published and the source of such report should also be shown
 5
 ek report, jisane kisi ghotaale kaa pardaafash kiya he athwa kisi hitkar pariyojna ko badhaava dene ke liye report prakashit kii he, ko protsaahit or puraskrit kiya janaa chahie
 6
 a journalist who has financial interest in shareholdings, stock holdings, etc
 in a company should not report on that company
 7

 The Central Government sent a recommendation in February 1995 to the Press Council for its views on the possible role of visual and printing media in the progress of women

 The efforts of the media should be made without highlighting the positive achievements of women in moral ethics and should be investigated while combating the vulgarity and indecency of teaching towards modernity
 bhartiya press parishad ko, mahilaon kii avmaananaa ke aaropo par laayi jane vaali shikayaton par vichaar karne ko apni ore se praathamikta di jaani chahie or anya morganirdesh aadi banane chahie
 It was emphasized that such a policy document would become profitable only through the association of all sections of the society

 The Council considered deeply the provisions of the Press and Book Registration Bill, 1988 and ruled that it was out of the details of its objectives
 inhone vishay se sambandh duusare pres ayog kii siforeeshon ko samuchit rup se lagu nahin kiya
 Although some of the provisions were of a positive nature, some others were full of mischief which resulted in the threat to freedom of the press

 The government later withdrew the bill
 isi prakaar, parishad ne jammu kashmir visheshadhikaar bill, 1984 kaa mul pareekshan kiya

 koraasaan ke mahmud gazani ke darbar main prastut is kitaab ko firdausi ne 30 saal kii mehnat ke baad san 1010 main taiyaar kiya tha
 It mainly consists of couplets, which are divided into two main parts - mythical and historical, matching the Sasani rulers
 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity

 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed

 According to the authors of the triangle, Christopher Columbus was the first to present some amazing documents about the triangle, which he and his crew saw, "the amazing lights dancing on the horizon", and another location in their log book But he wrote, there were flames in the sky and at another place in his log book he also wrote about the absurd direction of the compass in the area

 The first article published in newspapers that mentioned the legends of the triangle was Jones on September 16, 1950, via The Associated Press

 "this was the first article to link supernatural events to Flight 19, but in February 1954, another author, Vincent Gaddis, linked Flight 19 to the mysterious disappearance of events in Argosi magazine, and gave it a new interesting name" The Deadly Bermuda Trengle
 " , Based on this article, he wrote a comprehensive book Invisible Horizons the following year

 The trend has been challenged by Lawrence David Kusche, a research library president at Arizona State University and author of Bermuda Trungle Mystery: Salvaged

 He cited cases in which appropriate information was not reported, such as the disappearance of sailor Donald Crowhurst on a world voyage, despite clear evidence of which Berlitz has presented as a mystery

 Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the events that exacerbated the mysterious influence of the triangle were events that actually took place outside it
 uskaa shodh ascharyajanak tareeke se saral tha: usne us avadhi ke samachar patron main mausam kii khabaron jaisi chijen dekhi jinka in kahanio main kabhi bhi ullekh nahin tha
 Kusche reached a conclusion
 kusche ne nishkarsh diya ki : Marine insurance company Lloyd's of London determined that the triangle was no more dangerous than any other area of the sea and did not charge an unusual charge rate for passing through the region

 Science does not have to answer the questions related to the triangle because those questions are not valid at first sight
 tribhuj me pot or vimaan isi tarah vyavhaar karte hai jaisaa ki ve duniya me anya jagah par karte hai" Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Teves and Barry Singer, have noted how these mysteries and paranormals are very popular and profitable

 Finally, if it is assumed that the land extends beyond the triangle, such as in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, or Bermuda itself, then there is no evidence of the disappearance of any land-based vehicles or individuals

 An explanation of the disappearance has focused on the presence of vast areas of methane hydrates on the continental plane in one interpretation

 They can be divided into two categories, the action of war and piracy is the record of enemy files for many losses, while many drowning incidents have been linked to enemy raids or submarines during world wars and various orders
 It has been written in log books, many other incidents which came under this category suspiciously, have not been proved; It is suspected that the USS Cyclops in 1918 and the loss of twin boats Protus and Nerus in World War II were also associated with the submarines, but there is no link in German documents
