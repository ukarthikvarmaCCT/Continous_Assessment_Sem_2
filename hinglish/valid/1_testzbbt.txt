 European scholars have also considered skill in art important

 Question Astrology is the art of astrology through which you can know the achievement of your mind
 koi ghatana ghatit hogi yaa nahin, yah jaanane ke liye prashn lagn dekha jaataa he
 Question: In astrology, it is said about the Ascendant Lagna, that the parts of the Ascended Sign in Lagna have special significance
 prashn jyotish main prayek bhav, prayek raashi apana vishesh arth rakhti he
 In this mode of astrology, the ascendant in the lagna is the questioner himself
 saptam bhav us vishay vastu ke vishay kaa bodh karaata he jiske bare me prashn kiya jaataa he
 To know which question is related to the planet, which looks at the planet ascendant in full view, it can be a question related to that planet or a planet which is strong in the horoscope and can have a question related to that planet
 prashn kundalee main prashn kaa samay bahut myne rakhata he, isliye prashn kaa samay kaise nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he ise ahm vishay mana jaataa he
 Regarding the question time scheduling, the question of the horoscope is that when the question arises in the mind of the questioner, it is the right time for the question
 jaise- prashnkarta ne phone kiya or us samay jyotishi ne jo samay prashnkarta ko diya, in dono me vah samay liya jaayegaa jis samay jyotishi ne phone suna, vahi prashn kundalee kaa samay he
 Question horoscope has become even more used in today's time
 kai prashno kaa jawaab janm kundalee se dekhnaa mushkil hota he, jabaki prashn kundli se unhe aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 The question can be known from the horoscope whether such a wish will be fulfilled or not
 prashn kundalee se un prashno kaa bhi jawaab paaya ja saktaa he jiskaa jawaab haa yaa naa main diya ja saktaa he jaise amuk maamle main jeet hogi yaa haar, biimaar vyakti swasth hoga yaa nahin, ghar se gaya vyakti waapas lautega yaa nahin
itnaa hi nahin prashn kundalee se yah bhi gyaat kiya ja saktaa he ki khoyaa saamaan milegaa athwa nahin
 In astrology, the classification of zodiac signs here suggests that the Shirshodaya zodiac signifies the success of the question, and the zodiacal zodiac signs indicate the failure of the question, in general questions the presence of an auspicious planet in the lagna is considered good and sitting of an inauspicious planet is inauspicious
 If you see annexed auspicious planets, then you can call the question a step towards success
 isi prakaar divabali raashi shubh prashn ki ore ishaara karti he jabaki ratribili raashi ashubh vishay se sambandhit prashn ko darshaati he
 To confirm your question, the sum of the question can also be seen in the horoscope as the rising of the zodiac in the lagna indicates that the situation is about to change and the fixed zodiac signifies that what remains will remain the same, ie travel In the question of, the ascendant will travel if there is a variable amount in the lagna and not in the fixed amount, and if there is bipolarity, the parts of the lagna are taken into account, from 00 to 150 will be equal to the constant amount As the variable will be equal to the amount
 The success of the question also depends on the fact that the higher the relationship of Lagna, Lagna, Bhava, Bhavesh, the sooner the achievement will be
 The question is the desire of the mind, whether the questioner's desire is on the side of the questioner or not, it is seen from the questioning, as in the question of travel, the questioner wants the journey and it also comes in the question chart only then it is said that the person will travel, not otherwise
 yahaan vichaarneey tathy yah he ki agar lagn evam saptam bhav donon hi main ashubh grah baithe hon to anshon se fal ko dekha jaataa he
 The fact is that if the inauspicious planets are sitting in both the ascendant and the seventh house then the fruit is seen from the parts
 bhaavo ki sankhya kundalee me 12 he
 In the horoscope, every emotion is constant and all have their own importance
 prashn kundalee main kis bhav se kya dekhnaa he yah prashn par nirbhar karata he
 In the Kundali, Kamesh is the one in which the question has been asked, eg, Kamesh is the lord of the seventh house in the marriage question
 isi prakaar santaan ke prashn me panchmesh kaaryesh he
 The relationship between Bhavesh and Kamesh is seen for the success of the question in the question chart
 in dono me jitna drushti sambandh ho, ye dono ansho me jitne nikat ho utana hi acha mana jaataa he
 If both of these make connections with Lagna, Lagna, Chandra and Guru then the answer will be positive, otherwise not

 The descendants of Malik Muhammad Jayasi were disciples of the Ashrafi dynasty and were called Malik
 firoz shah tughlaq ke anusaar baarah hajaar sena ke risaldaar ko malik kaha jaataa tha
 Jayasi mentions Sheikh Burhan and Syed Ashraf as his gurus
 jaaysi kaa janm san 1500 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 He was from a place called Jais in Uttar Pradesh
 unke naam main jaaysi shabd kaa prayog, unke upnaam kii bhaanti, kiya jaataa he
 This also indicates that he was a resident of Jais Nagar
 is sambandh main unka swayan bhi kahana he- This shows that the ancient name of that city was Udayan, where they had come for ten days like one reached, that is, they had started or taken birth in their mortal life and then they got a lot of happiness when they got restless
 
 jaais naam kaa ek nagar uttar pradesh ke raibareli jile main aaj bhi vartmaan he, jiskaa ek purana naam udyannagar 'udyanagar yaa ujjalik nagar' batalaaya jaataa he tathaa uske kanchana khurd naamak muhalle main malik mohammad jaaysi kaa janm-sthaan hona bhi kaha jaataa he
 Some people believe that no definite mention of his fixed date of birth or birth-year is found under any available composition of Jayasi
 ek sthal par ve kehete hai, On the basis of this, it can only be estimated that he may have been born sometime between 800 h and 900 H, accordingly sometime between 1397 AD and 1494 AD and after attaining the age of thirty years, he started the work of poetry
 Would have done padmavat kaa rachanakaal unhone 947 hi0 arthath 1540 i0 batalaaya he
 On the basis of the last part of Padmavat, it can also be said that by the time of writing it, he had grown old
 unke pita kaa naam malik raaje ashraf bataaya jaataa he or kaha jaataa he ki ve maamuli zameendaar the or kheti karte the
 It is also famous to maintain livelihood by cultivating jayasi itself
 jaaysi ne apni kuch rachanaaon main apni guru-parampara kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He says, Syed Ashraf, who was a dear saint, became a performer of the bright cult for me and he made my heart clean by lighting a lamp of love
 
 Jayasi was the common man and Kane
 ek manyata anusaar ve janm se aise hi the kintu adhiktar logon kaa mat he ki sheetala rog ke kaaran unka sharir vikrut ho gaya tha
 Jayasi himself has mentioned his existence as a poet - a gunman Muhammad Guni
 ab unki dahini yaa bain koun si aankh phooti thi, is bare main unheen ke is dohe ko sandarbh liya ja saktaa he: Muhammed left Disza, one Saravanan one eye
 iske anusaar yah bhi pratiti hoti he ki unhen baayein kaan se bhi unhen kam sunai padataa tha
 a story is heard in Jais that once Jaisi went to Sher Shah's court, he laughed seeing them
 tab inhone shant bhav se poocha - mohika hasasi, ki kohrhi? yani tu mujh par hansaa yaa us kumhaar par? tab shershah ne lajjit ho kar kshamaa maangi
 According to another belief, he did not go to Sher Shah's court, rather Sher Shah came to him after hearing his name
 sthaneey manyatanusaar jaaysi ke putr durghatana main makaan ke neeche dab kar maare gaye jiske falswaroop jaaysi sansar se virakt ho gaye or kuch dinon main ghar chhod kar yahaan vahaan fakir kii bhaanti ghoomane lage
 King Ramsingh of Amethi considered him very much
 apane antim dinon main jaaysi amethi se kuch dur ek ghaney jangal main rahaa karte the
 People say that when the last time came near, they told the king of Amethi that i would die by the arrow of a hunter, on which the king refused to hunt in the surrounding forests
 jis jangal main jaaysi rahete the, usamen ek shikari ko ek bada baagh dikhaai padaa
 He fired at him fearfully
 paas ja kar dekha to baagh ke sthaan par jaaysi mare pade the
 Jayasi sometimes used to take this form of yoga
 kaaji nasruddin hossain jaaysi ne, jinhen avadh ke nawab shujauddula se sanad mili thi, malik mohammad kaa mrityukaal rajjab 949 hijri bataaya he
 According to this, his death proves to be less than 49 years old, but what Jayasi has described in old age in the epilogue of 'padmavat' seems to be automatic
 jaaysi kii kabr amethi ke raja ke vartmaan mahal se lagbhag teen-chathai mile ke lagbhag he
 This present fort is built long after Jayasi's death
 amethi ke raajaaon kaa purana kila jaaysi kii kabr se dedh kos kii duuri par tha
 Therefore, the belief is prevalent that the king of Amethi had a son with the blessings of Jayasi and he built his grave near his fort, is baseless
 is baat ke bhi pramaan milte hai ki amethi naresh inke sangrakshak the
 According to another belief, he died in 1558
 unki 21 rachanaaon ke ullekh milte hai jisamen padmavat, akharavat, aakiri kalam, kaharanama, chitrarekha aadi pramukh hai
 But the basis of his fame is the Padmavat Granth
 isamen padmini kii prem-katha kaa rochak varnan hua he
 Ratnasen's first wife Nagmati has a unique account of disconnection
 isaki bhashaa avadhi he or isaki rachana-style par adikaal ke jain kaviyon kii doha chaupai paddati kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has ranked Jayasi as a prominent poet in the count of medieval poets
 sivakumar mishra ke anusaar shukla ji kii drushti jab jaaysi kii kavi pratibha kii ore gai or unhone jaaysi granthawali kaa sampadan karte hue unhen pratham shrenee ke kavi ke rup main pahachaanaa, uske pehle jaaysi ko is rup main nahin dekha or saraahaa gaya tha
 According to this, it seems natural that the poetic genius of Jaisi seems to be at the level of the medieval veteran poet Goswami Tulsidas
 isi kaaran se unhen tulsi ke samaksh jaaysi se bada kavi nahin dikhaa
 According to Shukla ji, the area of jaisi is narrower than that of Tulsi, but Premvedana is highly esoteric

 But in some people it is not right
 ahale islam ke paas, masjid, vah imaarat matlab he sansar namaaz party adaa kii jaati he
 If the prayer in the mosque is also on Friday, then it is called Jama Masjid
 masjid shabd quran main bhi aayaa he jaise masjid haraam ke zikr main beshumaar aayaat main yah shabd istemaal hua he
 In the view of some scholars, all mosques are actually parables of the Masjid, though later very splendid and different Alanoa style hi constructions were born which led to a different Islamic architecture
 duniya bhar main kul mila kar bharat akelaa gaiyr islamic mulk he jahaan sabase zyaada teen lakh masjiden hai
 There is no such mosque in any country of the world or even in Islamic countries
 sabase pehali masjid kaaba tha
 Masjid Haram was built around the Kaaba
 ek parampara ke anusaar kaaba vah jagah he jahaan sabase pehle hazarat aadam alaihissalam or hazarat hawwa alaihissalam ne zamin par namaaj padhi thi

 yahi jagah masjid al–haram kahalaai
 According to many traditions, it is here that Hazrat Mohammad and the first prayer were first prayed

 The third mosque was Masjid Nabvi ', whose foundation was also laid by Hazrat Muhammad sa Tools and Slim after Hijrat in Medina and participated in the construction itself
 masjide nabavi musalamaanon kaa dharmik, saamaajik or raajnneetik centre tha

 It has been built not only in Muslim countries but also in European countries

 Mosques often serve as a center for Quranic teaching
 kai masjidon main madrason bhi kaayam hai jo dharmik shiksha kaa daayitv karata diya jaataa he
 Mosques are the center of Muslims whose purpose is not only religious but the social, educational and political center of Muslims has been mosques

 Many mosques in villages in eastern countries also have common madrasas
 kuch masjidon ke islamic kendra hai jahaan dini va daniyavi shiksha ke saath shodh centre sthapit hai
 The political character of mosques has also historically continued from the beginning
 masjide nabavi keval namaaz ke liye nahin rahi balki isamen videshon se aane vaale ophod se hazarat mohammad sa upkaran or slim ke daur main mulaakaat hoti raheen
 Various ghazoats and Saraya plan debates were brought up
 sadiyon tak masjidon main krantikari andolanon ne janm liya kyonki vah musalamaanon ke sampark kaa ek mahatvapurn strot rahi hai
 Even in modern times one cannot ignore the political role of mosques which is a clear example of Lal Masjid Islamabad
 sarkarein bhi masjidon or masjidon ke jimme daran apane uddeshyon ke liye istemaal karti rahi hai
 The early mosques were very simple and included simple storied buildings with no towers or dome required
 islam main masjid ke liye keval sthaan vishesh hoti he magar iske vaastushilp par kadagan nahin
 Initially the mosque was constructed from the roof of pillars and addresses of the stems of Nabvi dates
 kaaba pattharon se bani ek chaukor imaarat thi jiske aasapaas khule parisar main puja hoti thi
 But over time, Muslims went to study resources and built mosques according to their needs and the culture of the region
 masjidon main mahange kaam or buland minar or gumbad baad main bananaa shuru hue
 The reason for the tower was that the mosque was visible from a distance, the azan di sound came on it and there was a glimpse of the culture and art of the area
 gumbad se masjid vaktaa ke bhaashan or prarthana kii awaz ek gunj or saundarya ke saath puri masjid main faili thi
 Since Islam does not encourage photographs of living things, the Quran import was used in various beautiful ways and various jewelery designs were also done for the mosque
 samay, aavashyaktaa or samskruti kii jhalak ke kaaran masjid main kai chijen lagbhag aavashyak ho gayi jaise minar, gumbad, masjid main ek angan, vuzu ke fawaare, namaaz ke liye haal aadi
 Apart from this, there are often madrasas, research centers or regular universities with mosques, hamlets, book boxes, mbs and some mosques
 minar masjid ke mukhya pahchaan he jo masjid dur se nazar aa saktaa he
 Azan was mainly mounted on the minaret so that the voice used to go far but now the azaan is done from within the mosque as the voice can be carried far away from the lavad speaker
 masjid minar kii oonchai par kadagan nahin
 It can be very small and very high
 europe main choti masjidon main to minar hi nahin hote kyonki ve aksar ek yaa do kamare hote hai
 The longest tower is believed to be the Mosque of Hasan Review, Kasabalanka, Morocco which is 210 meters high
 shuru main masjid ke minar nahin the or ve bahut saral thi lekin jald hi minar masjid kaa lagbhag hissaa ban gaye
 Muslims have accused that the minarets were built by looking at the minarets of the ketas, but this is not true as the minarets were already built in the Arab construction, especially the minarets with various defense forts were built to look far
 masjidon main menaron kii ek se lekar chah tak hoti he
 Four minarets are often found in mosques
 turki kii kai masjidon main chah minar hai
 There are a total of nine minarets in Masjidul Haram which have been constructed at various times
 masjide nabavi ke das minar hai jinamein se chah 99 meter oonche hai
 4 The minarets of the State Mosque Lahore, Pakistan are 53
8 meters long

 The minaret at Masjid Alhazar, Tarim, Yemen is 53 meters in length

 The types of menars differ in different countries
 pakistan, bharat or iran main minar aamtaur gol hote hai or kaaphi motaai hai
 In Turkey, almost the towers are round but of lesser thickness
 shaam or misr main kai minar choras hote hai
 Hush aspect towers are also found in Egypt
 lekin in sabhi uparokt deshon main anya prakaar ke minar bhi milte hai
 Red, Feroz or other posts and nigars are also made on the menars, which increases their beauty
 iran or iraq main kuch minar sunahari rang ke bane hue hai jinke upree hisse main asli sone se malsamajh nivesh kii gai he
 The domes are compulsory almost part of present-day mosques
 gumbad kaa mukhya uddeshy keval saundarya nahin balki isse vaktaa masjid kii awaz puri masjid main goonjati he
 Apart from this, the dome mosques have now been identified
 hazarat mohammad sallallahu alaihi va or upkaran or slim kaa rauza mubarak masjide nabavi main he jo hari gumbad bahut prasiddh he
 The most prominent is the pictures of Rauza Mubarak
 philistin main haram ghodsi alasharif sthit kab alsakarah bhi andolan swatantraaa philistin kii pahchaan he
 It is probably the oldest established dome of Muslims
 kuch log use masjid aqasaa samajhate hai jo galat he
 Mosques are very beautiful domes built in Iran
 jaise masjid imam, isiahaan kaa gumbad yaa masjid agenciyaan shaad, mashhad kaa gumbad
 upmahadweep paak or bhartiya gumbad bhi sakasham did hai
 The arrival of Arabs in Sindh led to the construction of several mosques with simple but large domes but later Mughal emperors built large mosques such as the state mosque Lahore, the white domes of Pakistan are very beautiful and large
 maru nirmaan gai babari masjid ke gumbad bhi bahut bade the jo hindu aatankwaadiyon ne shahid kar diya
 Built in modern times, Masjid Obi's dome in Karachi, Pakistan is the largest of the dome mosques that is 72 meters in diameter and constructed without a pillar
 1557 i
 main nirmaan hone vaali salimya masjid adarna, turki kaa gumbad 27
2 meter vyas kaa he or yah bhi duniya ke bade ganabadon main shumaar hota he
 This dome, though old, is so strong that even the 1915 AD Bulgarian cannon bombardment did not break and only damaged the inner layer
 duniya main bade ganabadon main masjid sultan salahuddin azeez, malaysia kaa gumbad bhi shaamil he jo 170 feet vyas kaa he
 Remember that the domes are not only in mosques but can also be seen in America, universities and some testing centers
 ganabadon ke aantarik hisson par badi sundar nakaashi bhi hoti he or aksar quran aayaat bhi likhi jaati hai
 Some gunpots have mirrors that allow light to enter
 gumbad ke aantarik nakaashi adhikansh gahare nile, firozabad yaa laal rang main kii jaati he kyonki yah rang oonche ganabadon main gumbad ke neeche khadey logon ko bakhubi nazar aa sakate hai
 Ancient mosques have large courtyards such as Masjid Haram and Masjid Nabvi's courtyards are very large which have expanded over time
 in sahanon main nihsandeh lakhon log namaaz pard sakate hai
 The courtyard of the State Mosque of Lahore is also very large in which close to one lakh people can offer Namaz at a time
 namaaz ke alaava puraane jamaane kii masjidon main hoje zarur hote the jo vuzu ke liye hote the
 Some ponds were made in which rain water used to wash away
 iskaa ek udhaaharan taunus kii pracheen masjid jama alcaroan aalakabar he
 Another example is the Jama Masjid, Isfahan, Iran
 sultan masjid burujardi, iran kaa angan bhi bahut bada he jiske teen aasapaas main imaaraten hai
 The courtyard of BBC Khanam, the mosque built by Amir Timor in Samarkand, is also included in the list of large tolerances
 jamiya aalazehar or misr hi ek masjid haakim ke angan bahut bade hai
 Purpose This list is too long
 sabhi sahanon main hoje hai or kuch main fawaare bhi lage hue hai
 Some mosques such as the mosque are also hamams of Paris
 masjid main namaaz ke liye aamtaur par ek bada cameraa yaa haul vishesh he, jisamen bahut upkaran nahin hota magar sundar or aaramdaayak kaaleen bichhe hai taaki adhik se adhik main aasaani se namaaz adaa kar saken
 It also usually contains arches and mimber
 mehrab vah jagah he main imam namaaz party karwaata he or mimber par vaktaa bhaashan dete hai
 Mimbers were usually made of wood
 sabase purana lakdi kaa mimber vyapak alcaroan aalakabar, taunus main jiskaa sambandh pehali sadi hijri he
 Nowadays, apart from wood, mimbers are made from cement and concrete with marbled
 masjidon main centre bada cameraa jo namaaz ke liye vishisht hota he, aamtaur par beshumaar stambhon se las hota he kyonki bahut bade kamare kii chat ko sahaara dene ke liye stambhon kii jarurat padati he
 But the purpose of the pillars is not only to support the roof but it also enhances the beauty of the mosque
 kuch masjidon jaise masjid kartabah apane stambhon ke kaaran prasiddh ho jaati hai
 In the construction of the pillars, Muslims have given great births of wisdom
 kuch masjidon jaise jama alcaroan aalakabar main chaar sau se adhik stambh hai
 There are some pillars of Masjid Nabvi which are old and identify where the mosque Nabvi was in Hazrat Muhammad's Tools and Slim's time in Mubarak
 kuch stambh nae hai
 The columns of Masjid Nabvi and Masjidul Haram are also numerous
 namaaz ke haal kaa saamaanya drishy dekha jaae to kai stambhon or sundar mehrab or mimber saath puure kamare main kaaleen bichhe nazar aaenge jo aamtaur gahare laal yaa safed rang ke hote hai
 Recently, hatches appear in different corners
 iske alaava deevaaron ke saath vibhinn almaaryon main quran or anya dharmik pustaken padi hongi
 Some chairs also appear in modern mosques and some ancient big mosques, but there are people who cannot sit on the ground due to old or other problems
 musalmaan allaah se atoot prem karata he, is ko prakat karne kii jagah masjid he
 For centuries, mosques have been the hallmark of Quran imports and other sculptures
 kyonki islam jivit vastuon kii tasviren banane ke liye protsaahit nahin karata isliye masjidon kii araish anya maapdand istemaal kiye gaye
