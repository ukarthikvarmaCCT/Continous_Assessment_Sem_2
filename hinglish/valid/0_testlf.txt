 ph scale is not a fixed scale; It is concerned with a set of standard solutions whose ph is assessed by international contracts
 ph kii avadharana ko sabase pehle 1909 main carlsburg laboretry ke danish rasayanashastri, soren pedar luritz sorensen ne prastut kiya tha
 It is still unknown what the exact definition of p is
 kuch sandarbhon se pataa chalata he ki p, "power" kaa pratik he or anya ise german shabd "potenz" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai or abhi bhi anya ise "potential" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 Jens Norby published a paper in 2000 in which he argued that p is a constant and a symbol of "negative logarithm"; Which is also used in other works
 H, hydrogen kaa pratik he
 Sorensen suggested a "PH" signal for convenience that symbolized the "power of Hydrogen" using the co-logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, p
 yadhyapi is paribhaasha kaa adhikraman kar diya gaya he
 If an electrode is calibrated with a solution of known hydrogen ion concentrations, p can be measured
 shuddh jal ko tatasth mana jaataa he
 25 ° c But the ph of pure water is around 7
0
 7 se kam ph vaale solution ko amleey kaha jaataa he or 7 se adhik ph vaale solution ko ksharkeey yaa kshareey kaha jaataa he
 Measurement of ph has great importance in medicine, biology, chemistry, food science, environmental science, oceanography and many other applications
 ph ko ek jaleey solution main hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke dashamalav laghuganak ke ghataav ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Due to its logarithmic nature characteristic, ph is a dimensionless quantity
 jahaan a H, hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi he
 The reason for this definition is that a h is a property of a single ion that can only be measured experimentally with the help of an ion-selective electrode that reacts with the activity of a hydrogen ion according to the Nernst equation
 ph ko saadharantah ek sanyukt glass electrode kii sahaayta se mapa jaataa he jo hydrogen ke aayan kii gatividhi ke prati samvedansheel ek electrode or ek calomel electrode yaa ek silver chloride electrode jaise kisi riference electrode ke bich ke potential antar yaa electromotive bal, E, ko maapta he
 The combined glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation: jahaan E, ek mapa gaya potential he or e 0, maanak electrode potential arthath maanak avasthaa kaa electrode potential he jisamen gatividhi bhi ek he
 r is the gas constant; t is the Kelvin temperature; f is a Faraday constant and n is an example of the number of electrons transferred
 electrode potential, E, hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke laghuganak kaa samaanupati hota he
 This definition is completely impractical in itself because the activity, concentrations, and activity coefficients of hydrogen ions are the product
 hydrogen aayan ke ekal-aayan kii gatividhi kaa gunank, ek aisi quantity he jise prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 To get rid of this difficulty, the electrode is calibrated in relation to the solution of known activity
 ph kii sankriyaatmak paribhaasha ko aadhikarik rup main international standard ISO 31-8 ne nimna rup main paribhaashit kiya he: solution x ke liye, galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e x ko mapa jaataa he | Concentrated Solution of kcl || Solution x | H2 | Pt and then the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, ES, is also measured which is different from the above by substituting solution X, ph of unknown ph by solution s of known standard ph
 tab X, kaa ph hota he The difference between the ph of the solution x and the ph of the standard solution depends only on the difference between the two measured potentials
 is prakaar, ph ko ek potential se praapt kiya jaataa he jise ek electrode ke saath mapa jaataa he jo ek yaa ek se adhik ph maanakon ke vipareet anshakit hota he; ek ph meter setting ko is prakaar se samyojit kiya jaataa he ki maanak ke solution kii meter kaa pathan, ph maan ke baraabar hota he
 The ph values of a range of standard solutions S, along with further detailed information, are indicated in the IUPAC recommendation
 maanak solution ko praayah maanak bafer solution ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from the normality of Nernst's law in real electrodes
 dhyaan den ki chunki taapmaana, paribhaashit karne vaale samikarnon main paaya jaataa he, isliye solution kaa ph, taapmaana-aadhaarit hota he
 Special procedures are required to measure very low ph values, such as some very acidic mine waters

 Supersides are a class of azoleic acids for which the function of Hammett acidity, h 0, has been developed
 yah sorensen kii mul paribhaasha thi jise ph ke paksh main adhikramit kiya gaya
 However, it is possible to directly measure the concentrations of hydrogen ions if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations
 ise karne kaa ek tarika, jo bade scale par prayukt hota rahaa he, yah he ki becoground electrolite ke ek apekshaakrit ucch sandratha kii upasthiti main strong kshar ke gyaat sandratha ke solution ke saath ek strong acid ke gyaat sandratha ke solution kaa anumaapan karnaa he
 Since the concentrations of acid and alkali are known, it is easy to calculate the concentrations of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with the concentrations
 Calibration is usually done using gran plots
 anshankan, ek slop factor, f or maanak electrode potential, e 0 ke liye ek maan utpann karata he taaki nernst sameekaran ko form Experimental measurements of e can be used to obtain hydrogen ion concentrations
 slop factor saamanytah ek se thodaa kam hota he
 a slope factor of less than 0
95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly
 becoground electrolite kii upasthiti yah sunishchit karata he ki anumaapan ke dauraan hydrogen aayan gatividhi gunank prabhavi dhang se sthir hota he
 Since it is constant, its value can be established by defining the standard state in a solution containing a background electrolyte
 is prakaar, is prakriya ke prayog ke parinamswaroop gatividhi ko sandratha ke sankhyatmak maan ke baraabar kiya jaataa he
 The difference between p and ph is very small
 yah kaha gaya he ki ph = p + 0

 durbhagyavash, donon prakaar ke maapan ke liye "ph" sangya kaa prayog karnaa bahut aam baat he
 poh is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of alkalinity or hydroxide ions, OH−
 poh ko swatantra rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he balki ise ph se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Concentrations of hydroxide ions in water, dwaara hydrogen yanon kii sandratha se sambandhit hota he jahaan KW, jal ke swa-ynikaran kaa sthiraank he
 The following co-logarithm is taken to, kamare ke taapmaana par poh ≈ 14 − ph
 haalanki mitti kii kshariyata ke maapan jaisi anya paristhitiyon main yah sambandh puri tarah se maanya nahin he
 Pure water has a ph of about 7; The exact value depends on the temperature
 jab ek acid kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se kam hoga or jab ek ksharak yaa kshar kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se adhik hoga
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par hydrochloric acid jaise kisi strong amla ke solution kaa ph, 0 hota he
 The ph of a strong alkali solution, such as sodium hydroxide, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 14
 is prakaar, maape gaye ph ke maan adhiktar 0 se 14 ke antargat hi hoga
 chunki ph, ek laghuganakeey scale he isliye ek ph ikai kaa antar, hydrogen aayan sandratha main das guna antar ke baraabar hota he
 As the glass electrode reacts to the activity, the electrode must be calibrated in a medium that is similar to the medium being investigated
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi samudri jal ke ek namoonay ke ph ko maapna chahta he to electrode ko ek aise solution main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jisaki rasinic sanrachana samudri jal ke sadrush ho, jiskaa vistrut varnan neeche diya gaya he
 An approximate measurement of ph can be achieved by using a ph indicator
 ek ph indicater ek aisa sabstens he jo ek vishesh ph maan ke aas-paas ke rang ko badal detaa he
 It is a week acid or week base and the color change occurs either in the acid dissociation constant around 1 ph unit or in the pk a value, either side of either
 udhaaharan ke liye, swaabhaavik rup se parivartit hone vaala litmus, acidic solution main laal or alkaline solution main nila ho jaataa he
 Universal indicators consist of a mixture of indicators in such a way that there is a continuous color change from about ph 2 to ph 10
 universal indicater patr, saamaanya patr he jisamen universal indicater shaamil hota he
 The solution which has a ph of 7 is called neutral i
e
 it is neither acidic nor basic
 Water is subject to a self-ionization process
 pruthakkaran sthiraank, k w kaa maan lagbhag 10−14 hota he isliye namak ke neutral solution main hydrogen aayan sandratha or hydroxide aayan sandratha donon lagbhag 10−7 mol dm−3 hote hai
 The ph of pure water decreases as the temperature increases
 udhaaharan ke liye, 50 °C par shuddh jal kaa ph, 6
55 hota he
 Note, however, that water exposed to air is slightly acidic
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jal, hawa se carbon dioxide ko avashoshit kar letaa he jo baad main dhire-dhire carbonic acid main badal jaataa he jo hydrogen aayan ko mukt karke pruthak kar detaa he: In the case of a strong acid, complete dissociation occurs so ph is generally equal to the logarithm subtraction of the acid concentration
 udhaaharan ke liye, hydrochloric acid ke ek 0
01 molr solution kaa ph, −log hota he arthath ph = 2
 The ph of a solution of one week acid can be calculated through the ICE table

 The philological status of Rajasthani language is in those languages like Rihari and Pahari, which cannot be considered as divisions of Hindi, but its alliance with the cultural and literary history of Hindi has become so strong that in Rajasthani language the independent power of Rajasthani language is not there

 Grierson has considered Rajasthani's five dialects- pashchimi rajasthani, North eastern rajasthani, madhyapurvi rajasthani, Southeast Rajasthani, dakshini rajasthani 
 Grierson considers Bhili and Khandeshi as independent language classes, but Dr
 Chaturjya would like to place them under the "rajasthani class", which seems more expedient

 Following are the common features of Rajasthani language: rajasthani main "na", "d" or "l" teen vishisht dhvaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The original Sanskrit "a" sound is seen in the Rajasthani tadbhavya words in many places as "I" and "I" as "U" - "minak", Haran, k "mar"
 mebari or maalavi main "c, chha, ja, jha" kaa uccharan bhili or marathi kii tarah kramash: "ts, sa, dj, za" kii tarah paaya jaat he
 Sanskrit Hindi padadi "sa-sound" is safe in eastern Rajasthani, but in mewadi-malvi-marwadi, Aghosha becomes "hath"

 In western Rajasthani, the causative prefix is "ro-ra-ri", but in eastern Rajasthani they are "ko-ka-ki" like Hindi

 In Rajasthani, there are two forms of "relative to the ideal" and "non-ideal", in the form of superior male

 Three types of future forms are found in Rajasthani: -javago, Jasi, Javallo
 inamen dwitiya rup sanskrit ke bhavishyatkalik tisaint roopon kaa vikaas hai-"jasi", jasyun 
 Another inflectional feature of Rajasthani is the use of the suffix "-er" for the antecedent verb: - "oo-read-r roti khasi"

 Despite facing criticism from critics, Cayenne was successful and generated substantial profits for the company which was sufficient to fund the company's investment and upgrade of the existing model range, as well as the Panamera project fund

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity
 kahin par 24 volt kii jarurat ho to 12 volt vaali do badariyon ko shreneekram main jodakar 24 volt praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components
 It depends

 30 janvari 1948 kii shaam ko jab ve sandhyakalin prarthana ke liye ja rahe the tabhi nathuram godse naam ke vyakti ne pehle unke pair chhue or phir saamne se un par bareta pistaul se teen goliyaan daag deen
 At that time Gandhi was surrounded by his followers
 is mukademe main nathuram godse sahit aath logon ko hatya kii sajeesh main aaropee banaaya gaya tha
 Out of these eight persons, three accused Shankar Kistaiya, Digambar Badge, Veer Savarkar, Digambar Badge were acquitted for becoming a government witness
 shankar kistaiya ko ucch nyaayalay main apil karne par maaf kar diya gaya
 Due to no evidence found against Veer Savarkar, the court acquitted him of the crime
 baad main saavarkar ke nidhan par bharat sarkaar ne unke sammaan main ek dak tikat jari kiya
 And in the end, three of the five accused - Gopal Godse, Madanlal Pahwa and Vishnu Ramakrishna Karkare - were sentenced to life imprisonment and two - Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were hanged
 birla bhawan main shaam paanch baje prarthana hoti thi lekin gandhiji sardaar patel ke saath meeting main vyast the
 Then he remembered that it was late for prayer
 30 janvari 1948 kii shaam jab baapu abha or manu ke kandhon par haath rakhkar manch kii taraf bade ki unke saamne nathuram godse aa gaya
 He folded his hands and said - "hello Bapu!" Manu walking with Gandhi said - "brother! Get out of front, let Bapu go
" baapu ko pehle hi der ho chuki he
 "but Godse smacked Manu and fired three bullets one after the other at Gandhi's chest with a small barreta pistol hidden in his hands
 do goli baapu ke sharir se hoti hui nikal gayin jabaki ek goli unke sharir main hi fasi rah gayi
 78-year-old Mahatma Gandhi was killed
 birla house main gandhi ke sharir ko dhankkar rakhaa gaya tha
 But when his youngest son Devdas Gandhi arrived there, he removed the cloth from Bapu's body so that the world could see the violence with the priest of peace and non-violence
 nyaayalay main nathuram godse dwaara diye gayi bayaan ke anusaar jis pistaul se gandhi ji ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya vah usne dilli main ek sharnaarthi se kharidi thi
 a total of eight persons, including the main accused Nathuram Godse, were tried in the case of killing Gandhi
 un sabake naam is prakaar hai: Gandhi was attacked 10 days ago during a prayer meeting at Birla Bhavan
 madanlaal paahwa naam ke ek punjabi sharnaarthi ne gandhi ko nishaanaa banaakar bam phenkaa tha lekin us vakt gandhi bal-bal batch gayi
 The bomb exploded on the front wall and broke the wall
 gandhi ne kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki koi unhen jaan se maarna chahta he
 Gandhi started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi in which he was asked to immediately end communal violence and pay Rs 50 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jaayegaa tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaayegi
 Seeing the insistence of Gandhi, the government paid this amount but Hindu organizations felt that Gandhiji was doing tricks to make Muslims happy
 bam blast kii is ghatana ko gandhi ke is faisle se jodakar dekha gaya
 Nathuram had tried to kill Bapu thrice earlier, but failing he went back to Bombay with his friend Narayan Apte
 in donon ne dattatraya parchure or gangadhar dandavate ke saath milakar bareta naamak pistal kharidi
 Together, they both returned to Delhi on 29 January 1948 and stayed in Retiring Room Number 6 of Delhi Station
 desh ko aaazaad hue abhi mahaj paanch maheene hi beete the ki media main pandit nehru or sardaar patel ke bich matbhedon kii khabar aane lagi thi
 Gandhi was very sad to hear such news coming out and he wanted to answer it
 vah to yahan tak chaahate the ki ve swayan sardaar patel ko istipha dene ko kah den taaki nehru hi sarkaar kaa puraa kaamkaaj dekhen
 But this could not happen
 unhone 30 janvari 1948 ko patel ko baatcheet ke liye chaar baje shaam ko bulaayaa or prarthana khatm hone ke baad is masale par baatcheet karne ko kaha
 But destiny did not approve of it
 patel apni beti maniben ke saath tay samay par ganndhi ke paas pahunch gayi the
 After going to the meeting after meeting with Patel, Gandhi fell victim to Godse's bullets
 gandhi kaha karte the ki unki jindagi ishwar ke haath main he or yadi unhen maranaa hua to koi bachaa nahin saktaa he
 He once said- "those who want security instead of freedom have no right to live
" " haalanki birla bhawan ke get par ek paharedaar jarur rahata tha
 The then Home Minister Sardar Patel had ordered the deployment of a head constable and four constables at Birla House as a precautionary measure
 gandhi kii prarthana ke vakt birla bhawan main sade kapadon main police tainaat rahati thi jo har sandigdh vyakti par najar rakhti thi
 However, the police thought that as a precaution, it would be better if the people who come to attend the prayer meeting are searched and allowed to enter the premises of Birla Bhavan
 lekin gandhi ji ko police kaa yah idia pasand nahin aayaa
 An officer of the DIG level of police also talked to Gandhi about this and said that his life may be in danger but Gandhi did not agree
 baapu kii hatya ke baad nandalaal mehta dwaara darz exiaar ke mutabiq unke mukh se niklaa antim shabd 'he ram' tha
 But V
 Kalyanam, who worked as a freedom fighter and private secretary of Gandhi, claims that this is not true
 us ghatana ke vaqt gandhi ke thik peeche khadey kalyanm ne kaha ki goli lagane ke baad gandhi ke munh se ek bhi shabd nikalne kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 Although Gandhi often used to say that when he dies, the name of Ram will be on his lips
 yadi vah biimaar hote yaa bistar par pade hote to unke munh se jarur 'ram' nikalataa
 The commission set up to investigate the assassination of Gandhi did not even bother to interrogate the people closest to the father on that day
 phir bhi yah duniya bhar main mashhoor ho gaya ki gandhi ke munh se nikle aakhri shabd 'he ram' the
 But it could never be proved
 is baat kii bhi koi jaankaree nahin milti ki goli lagane ke baavjood unhen aspataal le jane ke bajaay birla house main hi waapas kyon le jaaya gaya? It is also believed that a family friend of Mahatma Gandhi kept his ashes in a secret place for about 62 years which was flown into the sea of durban on 30 January 2010
 duniya ko parmaanu kshamta se rou-ba-rou karaane ke baad isaki vidhvansak shakti ke durupyog kii ashanka se pareshaan albert oinstin ahimsa ke pujari mahatma gandhi se milane ko betaab the
 But his wish could not be fulfilled

 Einstein wrote in the letter- "you have proved by your work that non-violence can be achieved even with people who do not reject the path of violence
" main ummid karata hoon ki aapkaa udhaaharan desh kii simaaon main bandhaa nahin rahegaa balki anterrashtriya str par sthapit hoga
 i hope that one day i will be able to meet you
 " Einstein has written about Bapu that the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi are amazing in political history
 unhone desh ko daastaa se mukt karaane ke liye sangharsh kaa aisa nayaa maarg chunaa jo maanviya or anokhaa he

 Artism is known as the antonym of utilitarianism in the field of literature and art
 is siddhant kaa pratipaadan victor kuje ne 1818 main kiya
 According to it, the purpose of art is not to achieve any moral or religious purpose, but to seek its own perfection
 kala soundaryanubhuti kaa vaahak he isaliye ise upyogita kii kasuti par nahin parkhaa janaa chaiye
 Adherence to the rules of society, policy, religion, philosophy etc
 are a hindrance to the free and spontaneous expression of art
 kalavaadiyon ke anusaar kalakaar lokottar praani, kala lokatit vastu tathaa kalajanya anand alokik aswadyukt evam samajanirpeksh hota he
 Conversely, utilitarian art is considered not only as a powerful means of changing the attitudes of the society towards the desired direction, but also considers it as the best medium of principle propagation
 upyogetavaadiyon ne kalavaadiyon par sankeern evam vyaktinishth hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he, ve viviya ghode par arudh hai
 The Artists accused Utilitarians of being a subservient to gross socialism and said, they had promised to give us heaven, but have given Rugnalaya
 vichaarkon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo kalawaad ke vyaktipaksh or upyogetavaad ke samajapaksh ke samanvay ko hitkar maanata he
 The ostensible power of the artistic approach is constantly found in Europe in some form or the other from Plato and Aristotle to the present day
 plato ne apane granth 'republic' main kaviyon or kalakaaron ko rashtrabahishkrut kar dene kii vyavastha di he; kaaran, unki drushti main kalpanasheel kalakaaron evam kaviyon kaa aseem prabhaav naitik evam saamaajik drushti se avaanchhneeya tha
 Even though Aristotle has not openly refuted the moral and social beliefs of his mentor Plato, as well as the moral elements and didacticism in art have not disproved them, Aristotle, according to the famous philosopher Butcher, was the first to initiate ethics
 Isolated and told that refined bliss is the ultimate goal of poetry or art
 rome ke prasiddh vichaarak sisaron ne shaleenta tathaa udaattata ko kala kaa pramukh pratipaadya nirdhaarit kiya he
 Longinus in his work 'periapsus' not only considered art as distinct and superior to education and entertainment, but also distinguished it on the higher plane of communication and advised its independent evaluation
 longinus ke anusaar kavy tathaa kala kaa mukhya tatv udaatt he or bhaavana kaa udaattikaran hi unka pradhan parinaam hota he jiskaa vyakti se bhi or samaaj se bhi sidhaa sambandh rahata he
 Therefore, Longinus is certainly centrist in his statement and rendering
 dionisis tathaa demetrius prabhruti anya anek roman vichaarkon ne kavy tathaa kala ke shailipaksh par hi vishesh jor diya he
 Pallavan of classical or classical art of Europe was mostly under the protection of Christianity or 'church'
 at: saatvin se 15veen shatee isvi ke bich rome ko centre maanakar jis baijantiya kala kaa vikaas misr se rus tak hua, vah carch ashrith hone ke kaaran naitik-dharmik-mulya-samanvit thi, at: uskaa soddeshy tathaa upadeshaatmak hona jaruri tha or isiilie usamen kalapaksh gaun hi rahaa
 Even then it is not that there was no relaxation of imagination and feelings in the art of the said period
 iske vipareet dharmik drushtisampann kalakaar bina kisi bahari niyantran athwa baadhyataa ke ucch koti kii kala kaa srijan karte the
 Tolstoy was strongly opposed to the artistic ideology
 unke mat se dharm ke prati vishwaas kaa abhaav hi kalavaadi vichaaron ko janm detaa he or kala kaa saadhy na anand he, na hi saundarya
 He was adamant about morality and like Gandhiji his outlook was reformist
 sudhaarwad prakarantar se upyogetavaad hi he
 Therefore, for Tolstoy, art was definitely a secondary instrument
 italy ke mahan kavi aaligyari dante ne kala ke kshetra main pun: udaatt gunon evam bhavy style kii pratishtha kii
 Dante's influence lasted only a few days
 pashchaat shastreey drushti dhire-dhire romani drushtikon se aachhadit hone lagi
 As a result, there was a huge change in the artistic values at this time
 17veen shatabdi ko kala kii drushti se kaaphi mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he
 Neoliberalism emerged in France during this period
 lekin yah bhi madhyakaalin chintan ke naveen sanskaran se adhik nahin tha
 Medieval moral values began to disintegrate in Europe after Renaissance, which not only created an atmosphere of instability between traditionalist and independent ideas, but also led to a mutual conflict
 iskaa kaaran is samay kisi sudrudh darshan kaa abhaav tha
 In 1866 AD, in the enforcement of almost diverse literary and artistic promises, in France, the French country, 'l'art Por l'art', came out with a formula whose English translation is 'art for Art's Sec' and in Hindi with the phrase 'art for Art' Is known
 yaheen se kalavaadi vichaardhaara kaa pratyaksh aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 American painter James Abbott mcneil Hwisler, who lived in France and England for a lifetime, became a strong supporter of artism
 hua yah ki 1877 i
 main grosvener chitrakala pradarshnee main angreji ke prakhyat samalochak ruskin ne hvisler ke chitron kii tikhi aalochana kii or kaha, hvisler apane chitron ke madhyam se darshakon ke chehron par rangabhari pyaaliyaan undel detaa he
 Ruskni's statement triggered a court trial in which Hwisler eventually received a fathering as compensation
 iske baad bhi kala ke uddeshy ko lekar ruskin or hvisler ke bich vadavivaad chalata rahaa
 Ruskin considered art to be completely independent and self-contained apart from morality
 isi se prerit hokar hvisler ne apni puri shakti se 'kala kala ke liye' mat kaa pravartan kiya jo atvaad kii seemaa tak ja pahunchaa
 Bradley, Clive Bell, Roger Fai, and George Innes, etc
, were strong advocates of the critical critical ideology
 breadle ne to apane granth 'poetry for poetries sek' main spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki naitikta kavita kaa maatr bahya paksh he
 Therefore, it is absolutely irrational to consider it essential for the superiority of the poem
 clive bel ne aadhunik chitrakala ke sandarbh main rupatatv ko pramukh mana or 1914 i
 main 'siganifikent farm' kaa siddhant prastut kiya jiskaa punaradha roger faai ne 1920 i main kiya
 Artism gained a clear philosophical foundation from the expression of Croche
 kaant kii sthapana 'saundarya kaa koi bahya astitv nahin he' ko aadhaar banaakar kroche ne apane 'laa spirito' naamak granth main saundaryabodh ke liye 'ant: pragna' kii satta kaa pratipaadan kiya or bataaya ki saundaryasrishti tathaa saundaryanubhuti donon hi sookshm maansik vyapaar hai
 At the same time there is elemental unity between varna and manifestation
 at: kalapaksh or vastupaksh ko vicchhinn karke dekhnaa bhraamak he
 According to Croche, art is basically a spiritual activity, so in its view, art has no other purpose or purpose except expression
 itnaa hi nahin, kroche ne kala ko naitik kinwa shaikshanik simaaon se mukt bhi mana he
 In a way, utilizing Croche's theory in a way denies utilitarian recognition, but the said principle applies only to the intangible trade of art, not to the tangible
 kroche kaa kala siddhant tatvat: samajavirohi nahin he kyonki moort hone par vah bhi kala ko samajanirpeksh nahin maanata
 The artistic vision was also strengthened by the 'dreamism' of Freud

richards ne apni pustak 'principles ov litereri critisine' main kalavaadi drushti kaa khandan saidhantik aadhaar par karte hue preshniyata ko kavyprakriya main vishesh mahatv pradaan kiya tathaa kaha ki kavy kii satta shesh jagat se bhinn nahin he or na hi kavy kii anubhuti shesh jagat kii anubhuti se bhinn he
 Thus Richards re-established utilitarianism in the field of art
 marxvad ke udai ke saath kalavaadi manyataon kaa teji se vighatan hua
 Marx adopted a utilitarian approach to art in his economics and said that art is for the public, mainly for soldiers and workers
 stallin ne rus main or maao ne china main kala tathaa sahitya ko raajnneeti ke prachaar kaa pramukh saadhan mana evam usapar rajshakti kaa ankush laga diya
 In his circular titled 'problems of Art and Literature', Mao expressed his faith in the above mentioned installations of Marx
 marxvaadi samalochak codwell ne bhi kalavaadi vichaardhaara ko vishuddh burjua drushti se utpann kutsit vritti kaa parinaam bataaya he
 In the Marxist camp, Trotsky is the only person who considers the interference of political party in the field of art unfair
 'litarechar and revolution' naamak apane granth main usne spasht kaha he, kala ke kshetra main party ko aadesh dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It is fine that the duties of the party are also to protect and assist the art, but leadership can be done only indirectly in that area

 In Indian literature also, there have been many such sects related to ornamentation, rituals, curvatures etc
, in whose view Kalapaka was more important
 hindi ke aadhunik sahitya main premchand, dinakar aadi upyogetavaadi the to prasad ne anandavaadi drushti apanaai jo kalawaad ke adhik nikat he

 the view of critics is purely utilitarian

 Organic nutrients include carbohydrates, fats, proteins and vitamins
 acarbonic rasinic yogicon, jaise khanij lavan, pani or oxigen ko bhi poshak tatv mana ja saktaa hai
 An organism needs to take a nutrient from an external source when its body is unable to synthesize sufficient amount of it in its body

 Story: There was a king in our country - Nal
 unki patni kaa naam tha damyanti
 Once, on the Pratipada of Chaitra month, the old queen came to Damayanti
 usne apane gale main pilaa gaanth laga doraa band rakhaa tha
 When the queen asked him about the string, she said, "this is the thread of wealth
" iske pahanane se ghar main sukh sampati kii vriddhi hoti hai
 The queen also took a thread from her and tied it around her neck, when King Nal asked about the thread tied around the queen's neck, the queen told all the things told by the old lady
 raja kehane laga,” tumhe kis chij kii kami he jo tumne doraa bandha he
 “even after the queen refused to say so, the king broke the cord and threw it away
 raatri main raja ko swapn main ek stri boli- ” main ja rahi hoon tathaa duusari stri boli main aa rahi hoon
 "thus, this dream would come every day for this twelve days
 vah udhaas rahane laga
 When the queen asked, the king told the queen the dream
 rani ne raja se dono striyo kaa naam poochne ko kaha
 When the king asked her, the first woman said, "I am Lakshmi", and the second one called her name poor
 duusare din raja ne dekha kii uskaa sab dhan samaapt ho gaya he
 They became so poor that they could not even eat
 duhkhi man ne raja rani jangal main kand mul khaakar apane din bitaane lagen
 His five-year-old son got hungry on the way
 to rani ne raja se malin ke yahan se chacha mangekar laane ko kaha
 When the king asked for buttermilk from Malin, Malin said that buttermilk is finished
 aage chalane par raja par ek vishdhar ne kuker ko das liya
 On going further, the king brought two pheasants
 rani ne teetar bhune to teetar ud gayi
 When the king was bathing and drying the dhoti, the wind blew the dhoti
 tab rani ne apni dhoti fadkar raja ko di
 When he went ahead with hungry thirst, then on the way home of the king's friend
 mitra ne dono ko kamare main tehraaya
 If they put iron tools there, they got into the earth
 chori kaa dosha lagane ke bhay se vahaan se bhaage
 Later, the king's sister came home
 raja kii bahan ne unhe ek puraane mahal main tehraaya sone ke thaal main unhe khaanaa bheja to thaal mitti main badal gaya
 The king was ashamed
 thaal ko vahi jameen main gankar bhaag nikalen
 Walking ahead came a moneylender's house
 sahukaar ne raja ke thaharne kii vyavastha puraani haveli main kar di
 There, a hero's necklace was hung on the Khanty
 paas hi diwaar par ek mor kaa chitra bana tha
 He started swallowing the peacock necklace
 yah dekhakar ve vahaan se bhi chori ke dar se bhaage
 Now on the advice of the queen, the king started thinking of making a hut in the forest
 ve jangal main ek sookhe bageeche main jaakar tehre
 The garden became green
 baag kaa swami yah dekhakar bada prasann hua
 Swami asked him, who are you both? Raja said that we are travelers
 majaduree kii khoj main aaye hai
 Swami kept him a servant with him
 ek din baag kii swamini baithi baithi katha sun rahi thi or doraa le rahi thi
 On being asked by the queen, she told that there is a Dora of wealth, the queen also took Dora after hearing the story
 raja ne rani se poocha ye kaisaa doraa bandha hai? rani boli yah vahi doraa jise aane ek baar todkar phenk diya tha
 And we had to face so many misfortunes
 smapda devi ham par naaraaz hai
 The queen said, "if Sampada Mata is true then our days will return again
 “ That night the king had a dream
 ek stri kah rahi hai main ja rahi hoon, duusari stri main aa rahi hoon
 On the king's asking, the first woman called her name impoverished and the second called her name Lakshmi
 raja ne lakshmi se poocha ab to nahin jaaogi
 Lakshmi said, "if your wife keeps telling the story with the wealth of wealth, then i will not go
" yadi tum doraa tod doge to chali jaaongi
 The mistress of the garden used to give a necklace to a queen, making that necklace Damayanti
 rani vah haar bahut pasand aayaa
 On the queen's inquiry, he made a mistress that he has made a couple work here
 rani ne baag kii malkin se dono ke naam poochne ko kaha
 When he came home and asked for the name of both, he came to know that they are Nal Damayanti, the owner of the garden started apologizing to him, then King Nal told him that our days were going bad, there is no fault of yours
 ab dono apane rajmahal kii taraf chale
 On the way came the moneylender's house
 vah sahukaar ke yahan tehre vahaan dekha ki diwaar par bana mor naulakha haar ugal rahaa hai
 The moneylender caught the king's feet
 aage chalane par bahan ke ghar pahucha
 The king stayed in the sister's old palace
 raja ne vah jagah khodi to heere se jadt thaal niklaa
 The king gave a lot of money to his sister
 aage chal mitra ke ghar pahunchakar usee kamare main tehra
 Friend's iron tools were found there
 aage chalane par uski dhoti ek vriksh par mil gayi
 After proceeding after washing the bath, the prince who had taken the snake got found playing
 mehalo main pahuchane par rani kii sakhiyo ne mangal gaan gaakar unka swaagat kiya
 All this was the result of tying the thread of Sampada ji which changed their bad days into good days

 Samuel Johnson) was an English poet, essayist, critic
 inhen praayah 'dow johnson' kaha jaataa he
 Dr
 Alexander particularly influenced the literary activity of England after Alexander Pope in the 18th century
 unhone na to prachur maatra main hi likhaa or na nibandhon evam katipay aalochanatmak rachanaaon ke atirikt kavita, naatak yaa anya kshetron main kiye gaye unke sahitya prayaason kaa aaj koi vishesh mahatv hi he, phir bhi unke gambhir vyaktitv kaa prabhaav us samay ke adhikansh chote bade lekhakon par padaa
 Dr

 jivan kii praarambhik avasthaa se hi unhen visham paristhitiyon se sangharsh karnaa padaa
 Darishya's wife was always hovering over the family
 lichafield ke grammer skool main praarambhik shiksha praapt karne ke baad inhone aavaford ke pembrok kalege main pravesh kiya
 But he was able to stay there for only 14 months and had to leave the college without a degree
 san 1731 i

 In 1735 AD, he married a widow named Mrs

 Eventually, he left for London in 1737 and adopted literature as a means of living
 dow johnson kii pratham rachana, jisane logon kaa dhyaan inaki ore aakarshith kiya, 'landan' sheershak kavita thi
 The Pope also praised him
 san 1744 main inhone apane mitra richard saveej kii jeevani likhi
 On the suggestion of certain publishers, he took up the task of creating a dictionary of English language
 prakaashan main sahaayta milane kii aashaa se inhone shabdkosh kii yojana lard chesterfield ke paas bheji lekin jaise protsaahan kii apeksha thi, vah mila nahin
 After seven years of hard work, when the dictionary was published, Lord Chesterfield wrote two figurative letters in relation to it in a magazine called 'world'
 dow johnson ne is thothi prashansa se chidhkar unhen jo uttar diya vah na keval unke vyaktitv kii garima evam unke aatmasanman ke bhav kaa parichaayak he, varan bhavukta ke kshanon main unki bhashastyli kitni saral, ojasvi evam pravaahamay ho sakati thi, iskaa bhi pramaan prastut karata he
