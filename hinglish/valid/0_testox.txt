 286 years ago, his role in realizing the dream of Amber Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of a well-organized and modern city like Jaipur was most decisive and important
 ganit, shilpashaastra, jyotish or sanskrit aadi vishyon main unki asaadhaaran gati thi
 Vidyadhar was a gaud-brahmin of Bengal descent, whose ten Vedic Brahmin ancestors came to Jaipur at the time of bringing the rock of Kuldevi Durga Shiladevi of Amer-state from Khulna-sub-region of Jessore (now Bangladesh)

 Dr
 Aseem Kumar Rai, a renowned scholar and researcher of Jaipur history, has written on the basis of a horoscope obtained from the Pothikhana of city-palace, Jaipur, - 'vidyadhar was born in Bengal as Vaishakh Shukla Dashami, Vikram Samvat in 1750, Gyanendra Chakraborty in Amer Santosh Ram was born in the house of the famous
 unki mrityu phalgun sudi navami samvath 1807 ko jaipur main hui
 According to the research of Dr
 Aseem Kumar Rai, the earliest mention of Vidyadhar's name in the old papers of the Jaipur Durbar was available in Samvat 1775, when he was working on the post of 'naib-daroga' in Amar's 'mahkama-hisab'

 Sawai Jaisingh sat on the throne of Amber in 1699–1700 AD after the death of his father Maharaja Vishnusinh in the battle in Kabul - six years after the birth of Vidyadhar - who was unusual for one of his often anonymous accounting clerks
 Not only was talent recognized and respected; Rather, in 1729, he was promoted and given the important post of 'desh Diwan' of the Amer state
 san 1743 main savai jaisingh ke dehavsaan ke baad bhi vidyadhar shashan main rahe or samay-samay par sammanit or puraskrit hote rahe
 Vidyadhar's name as a city planner and head-architect of Jaipur is not an introduction

 Jaisingh first named it after his name, 'sawai Jayanagar', which was later abbreviated to 'sawai Jaipur' and eventually became more popular in common parlance as 'jaipur'

 Vidyadhar's city planning today is a standard-example in many universities in India and abroad, dividing the city according to Vastu Shastra in different blocks on the basis of right-angled routes, developing specialized hot-markets, and constructing many constructions to enhance its beauty

 Korotskaya has expressed in detail about the specific architecture of Vidyadhar and Jaipur in the city of India in his famous book

 "kavishiromani Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri published his famous poetry-book jaipur-vaibhavam in 1947 in 476 pages, then the immortal architecture of Vidyadhar - the city beauty, scenic places, temples, routes, respected citizens, festivals and festivals of Jaipur etc
 Had focused on san 1727 main jaigarh puraa hone par inhen 'siropav' sammaan mila, 1734 main chandramahal banavaane par punah siropav or san 1735 main jhotwada ke paas 'darbhavati nadi' / 'drayavati' se nahar banavaa kar uskaa pani jaipur shahar main laane par ek bada rajasamman 'siropav' mila
 About this, Yadunath Sarkar wrote on page 196 of his book 'history of Jaipur' - "as is evident from the Jaipur State papers, Vidyadhar's honor and rank as an architect was certainly high in jaipur-sarkar
 san 1729 isvi main unhen 'desh-dewan' pad par padonnat kiya gaya, san 1734 main 'saat-manzil ke rajmahal ko sheeghra puraa karwaane' or varsh 1735 main 'drayavati' nadi kaa pani jaipur main laane' ke uplakshya main ke liye rajya se sammanit kiya gaya
 This is also confirmed by the Jaipur inscriptions - he also received many honors and awards, including the evidence of an elephant being presented to him on 23 February 1751

 According to the information of Surajbaksha, a descendant of Vidyadhar, "meghnath Bhattacharya, the younger brother of Mahamahopadhyay Harprasad Shastri, had published a very important commentary on his ancestor Vidyadhar in 'sahitya-parishad-patrika' in 1904 AD

 Who discovered the law of gravity and the principle of motion
 ve ek mahaan ganitagya, bhautik vaigyanik, jyotish evam darshanik the
 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he
 In this work, Newton described three laws of universal gravitation and motion that dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries
 newton ne darshaya ki prithvi par vastuon kii gati or akashiya pindon kii gati kaa niyantran prakritik niyamon ke samaan samucchy ke dwaara hota he, ise darshane ke liye unhone grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon tathaa apane gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke bich nirantarata sthapit kii, is prakaar se surya kendriyata or vaigyanik kranti ke aadhunikeekaran ke bare main pichley andeh ko dur kiya
 In mechanics, Newton established the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum
 prakaashiki main, unhone pehla vyavhaarik paravarti doordarshee banaaya or is aadhaar par rang kaa siddhant viksit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko kai rangon main apaghatit kar detaa he jo drishy spectrum banaate hai
 He gave the rule of cooling and studied the speed of sound

 He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem and developed the so-called "newton's method" for the approximation of zeros of a function and contributed to the study of power series

 Newton was found to be more effective in this survey

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe
ye niyuktiyaan daayitvaheen pad ke rup main lee gayin thim, lekin newton ne unhen gambhirtha se liya, 1701 main apane cambridge ke kartavyon se sevanivruth ho gaye or mudra main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas kiya tathaa kataranon tathaa nakli mudra banane waalon ko apni shakti kaa prayog karke sajaa di
 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences
 royal sosayadi main apane pad par rahete hue, newton ne royal khagolvid jon flemustid ko shatru bana liya, unhone flemustid kii historica cholestis britanika ko samay se pehle hi prakashit karvaa diya, jise newton ne apane adhyayan main kaam main liya tha
 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by his relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha
 Mercury poisoning may explain the eccentricities in Newton's last life
 french ganitagya joseph louis lagrange aksar kehete the ki newton mahanatam pratibhashali tha or ek baar unhone kaha ki vah "sabase zyada bhaagyashaalee bhi tha kyonki ham duniya kii pranali ko ek se zyada baar sthapit nahin kar sakate
" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he
 Newton's memorial can be seen at Westminster Abbey, just north of the entrance to the choir opposite the choir screen
 ise murtikar maaikel rigbrake ne safed or dhoosar sangemarmar main banaaya he, jiskaa dizin vaastukar wiliam kaint dwaara banaaya gaya he
 In this memorial, Newton's figure rests on a stone tomb, his right elbow resting on several of his great books, and his left hand pointing to a catalog containing a mathematical design
 unke upar ek pyramid he or ek khagoleey globe raashi chakra ke sanketon tathaa 1680 ke dhoomaketu kaa rasta dikhaa rahaa he
 a relief panel is describing the putty, using instruments such as telescopes and prisms
 aadhaar par die gaye latin shilaalekh kaa anuwaad he: Here buried the knight, Isaac Newton, who was almost divine with brains, has his own bizarre mathematical principles, he described the shapes and paths of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides in the sea, the light Told the inequalities in the rays and described everything that no other scholar had imagined before, describing the properties of colors

 " westfol 1994 pi 245 Historian Stephen D
 Snowblen says of Newton that "isaac Newton was a heretic
 lekin 


 unhone apane nijee vishwaas kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa kabhi nahin kii- jisase is roodhiwaadee ko behad kattarpanthi jo samajha gaya
 He hid his faith so well that even today scholars are unable to know his personal beliefs
 " snobelen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki newton kam se kam ek soshinian sahanubhuti rakhte the,, sambhavatya arian ore lagbhag nishchit rup se ek trinity virdohi the
 —three Purva forms that are today called Unitarianism
 unki dharmik ashishnutaa ke liye vikhyath ek yug main, newton ke kattarpanthi vichaaron ke bare main kuch saarvajanik abhivyaktiyaan hai, sabase khaas he, pavitra adeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye unke dwaara inkaar kiya janaa, ore jab ve marane vaale the tab unhen pavitra sanskaar lene ke liye kaha gaya ore unhone inkaar kar diya
 In an approach disputed by Snowbelein, TC Fijnmeyer argued that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity, not the Western view of Roman Catholicism, Britishism, and most Protestants
 unke apane din main un par ek rosicrusian hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Although the universal laws of motion and gravity became Newton's best-known inventions, he was warned against using them as a machine for viewing the universe, similar to the Great Clock
 unhone kaha, "gurutv grahon kii gati kaa varnan karata he lekin yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kisne grahon ko is gati main sthapit kiya
 God controls everything and knows what is and what can be done
 " His scientific fame is notable, as well as his early church pastors and study of the Bible
 newton ne shabdic aalochana par likhaa, sabase vishesh he
 An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruption of Scripture unhone 3 april i
 33 ko yishu messiah kaa krusaropan bhi kiya, jo ek paaramparik rup se sweekrut tarikh ke saath sahamat he
 They tried unsuccessfully to find hidden messages within the Bible
 unke apane jeevankaal main, newton ne prakritik vigyaan se adhik dharm ke bare main likhaa
vah tarkyukt vishwavyaapee duniya main vishwaas karte the, lekin unhone libanij or baruch spinoja main nihit hilosoism ko asweekaar kar diya
is prakaar, aadeshit or gatisheel rup se suchit brahmand ko samajha ja saktaa tha or ise ek sakriy kaaran ke dwaara samajha janaa chahie
unke patrachaar main, newton ne daawa kiya ki princepia main likhte samay "maine ek najar aise siddhanton par rakhi, taaki devtaa main vishwaas rakhte hue manushya par vichaar kiya ja sake
" unhone duniya kii pranali main dizin kaa pramaan dekha: grahiy pranali main aisi adbhut ekarupata ko pasand ke prabhaav kii anumati di jaani chahie
 " lekin newton ne jor diya ki asthayitv kii dhimi vruddhi ke kaaran daivi hastkshep ant main pranali ke sudhaar ke liye aavashyak hoga
 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move
 It seems that he did not have enough foresight to make it a perpetual motion
" " Newton's position was strictly defended through a famous correspondence by his follower Samuel Clarke
 newton or robert boyal ke yantric darshan ko buddhijivi kalamaghasit dwaara rudhiwaadiyon or utsaahiyon ke liye ek vyavhaarya vikalp ke rup main padonnat kiya gaya or ise roodhiwaadee prachaarkon tathaa asantusht prachaarkon jaise letitudinerian ke dwaara hichkichaakar sweekaar kiya gaya
 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"
 purv-atmagyaan ke khilaaf kiye gaye hamale "jaadui soch," or isaiyat ke rahasyamayi tatv, ko brahmand ke bare main boyal kii yantric avadharana se neenv mili

 newton ne ek hastkshep bhagwaan dwaara niyantrit duniya ko ek aisi duniya main badal daalaa jo tarksangat or saarvbhaumik siddhanton ke saath bhagwaan ke dwaara kalatmak rup se banaayin gayi he
 These principles are available for all people to discover, they allow people to fulfill their objectives fruitfully in this life, do not wait for the next life and make them full of their own rational powers
 newton ne bhagwaan ko mukhya nirmaataa ke rup main dekha, jiske astitv ko sabhi nirmaanon kii bhavyata ke chehre main nakaara nahin ja saktaa he
 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone
 is sambandh main, is par nirmit saamaajik sanranchanaaon or itihaas ke adhyay tyaage ja sakate the
 It was Newton's conception of the universe based on natural and spiritually understandable rules that served as a seed for enlightenment ideology
 loke or waltair ne aantarik adhikaron kii vakaalat karte hue prakritik niyamon kii avadharana ko rajanithik pranali par lagu kiya; physiocrate or adam smith ne aatm-ruchi or manovigyaan kii prakritik avadharana ko aarthik pranali par lagu kiya tathaa samajashastriyon ne pragati ke prakritik namoonon main itihaas ko feet karne kii koshish ke liye tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii aalochana kii
 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature
 shahi taksaal ke prabandhak ke rup main, newton ne anumaan lagaaya ki dubaara dhalaai kiye jane vaale sikkon main 20% jaali the
 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence
 is ke baavjood, sabase jwalanth aparaadhiyon ko pakadana bahut mushkil tha; yadhyapi, newton is kaary ke liye sahi sabit hue
 bhesh badal kar sharabakhaane or jail main jaakar unhone khud bahut se saboot ikatthe kiye
 English law still had ancient and formidable customs of power, to separate all branches of government and establish all obstacles to prosecution
 newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison
 lekin chalonor ke ucch sthanon par mitra the, jinhone use uski rihaai ke liye madad kii
 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence
 chaloner ko ucch rajdroh kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or use 23 march 1699 ko tiburn gelos main faansee de kar dafna diya gaya
 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 It flows from Pakistan
 dakshin-pashchim tibet main samudr tal se 4,600 meter kii oonchai par iskaa udgam maansarovar ke nikat rakshas taal se he, jahaan iskaa sthaneey naam logachen khambaav he
 Before entering Himachal Pradesh from the point of origin it turns west and flows near the slope of Mount Kailash
 yahan se yah nadi gahare khaddon se hokar bahati he or parvat shreniyon kii kramik oonchai sutluj ghati main chabutaron main parivartit ho jaati he
 The river enters Nangal in Punjab, making its way through the mountains of Himachal Pradesh
 nangal se kuch kilometre upar himachal pradesh ke bhakhda main sutluj par baandh banaaya gaya he
 a huge reservoir has been constructed behind the dam, which is called Govind Sagar Reservoir
 bhakhda nangal pariyojna se panbizli kaa utpaadan hota he, jisaki aapurti punjab or aasapaas ke rajyon ko kii jaati he
 After entering Punjab, the river flows between the Shivalik hills in Ropar district in the southeast
 ropar main hi yah pahaad se maidan main utarati he, yahan se yah pashchim kii ore teji se mudakar punjab ke madhya main bahati he, jahaan yah best doaab or malwa ko vibhajit karti he
 At Harike, the Beas River joins the Sutlej, from where it turns southwest and sets the boundary line between India and Pakistan
 iske baad yah bharat ko chhodkar kuch duuri ke liye pakistan main fazilka ke pashchim main bahati he
 Towards the west near Bahawalpur, it meets the Chenab river

 It has been called Shutudri in Rigved's Nadisookta
 vaidic kaal main saraswati nadi 'shutudri' main hi milti thi
 Its later name in later literature is 'shatadru or Shatadru'
 valmiki ramayana main keky se ayodhya aate samay bharat dwaara shatadru ke paar karne kaa varnan he
 Shatadru is also mentioned in the Mahabharata along with other rivers of Punjab
 shrimadbhagwat main iskaa chandrabhaga tathaa marudavridha aadi ke saath ullekh he-'sushoma shatadrushchandrabhagamarudavridha vitasta'
 In the Vishnu Purana, Shatadru is said to have been omitted from the Mount of Himwan - 'shatadruchandra Bhagadadya Himvatpadnirgataha'
 vastav main sutluj kaa strot ravananad naamak jhil he jo maansarovar ke pashchim main he
 The present-day Sutlej meets 'bias'

 ke pehle sutluj, bias main nahin milti thi
 This year, the routes of both Bias and Sutlej changed and they came close together
 ' shatadru vaidic shutudri kaa roopaantar he tathaa iskaa arth shat dhaaraon vaali nadi kiya ja saktaa he
 Which indicates the existence of many of its tributaries
 greek lekhakon ne satluj ko hejidras kaha he
 But the mention of this river is very less in his texts
 kyonki alakshendra kii senaayen beas nadi se hi waapas chali gai thi or unhen beas ke purv main sthit desh kii jaankaree bahut thodi ho saki thi
 Sutlej has also contributed to the prosperity of Punjab

 The Canal of Nagal Dam, Sirhind and Best Doab Canal, which originate from Ropar, tributaries like Sirhind, Rajasthan Canal and Bikaner Canal, which originate from Hussainiwala, all receive water from Sutlej
 beas nadi In this article, subtests of major trigonometric identities are given
 Referring to the diagram at the right, the six trigonometric functions of θ are: The following identities are trivial algebraic consequences of these definitions and the division identity
they rely on multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator of fractions by a variable
 Ie, Or Two angles whose sum is π / 2 radians are complementary
 In the diagram, the angles at vertices a and b are complementary, so we can exchange a and b, and change θ to π / 2 - θ, receiving: Identity 1: Proof 1: Refer to the triangle diagram above
 Note that a 2 + b 2 = h 2 { \ displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=h^{2}} by Pythagorean theorem
 The following two results follow from this and the ratio identities
 To obtain the first, divide both sides of sin 2 ⁡ + cos 2 ⁡ = 1 { \ displaystyle \ sin ^ {2} + \ cos ^ {2} = 1} by cos 2 ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ cos ^ {2} }; for the second, divide by sin 2 ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ sin ^ {2}}
 Similarly Proof 2: Differentiating the left-hand side of the identity yields: Integrating this shows that the original identity is equal to a constant, and this constant can be found by plugging in any arbitrary value of x
 Identity 2: The following accounts for all three reciprocal functions
 Proof 1: Refer to the triangle diagram above
 Note that a 2 + b 2 = h 2 { \ displaystyle a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = h ^ {2}} by Pythagorean theorem
 Substituting with appropriate functions - Rearranging gives: Draw a horizontal line ; mark an origin O
 Draw a line from o at an angle α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } above the horizontal line and a second line at an angle β { \ displaystyle \ beta } above that; the angle between the second line and the x-axis is α + β { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta } 
 Place p on the line defined by α + β { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta} at a unit distance from the origin
 Let PQ be a line perpendicular to line defined by angle α { \ displaystyle \ alpha }, drawn from point q on this line to point P
 ∴ { \ displaystyle \ therefore } OQP is a right angle
 Let QA be a perpendicular from point a on the x-axis to q and PB be a perpendicular from point b on the x-axis to P
 ∴ { \ displaystyle \ therefore} OAQ and OBP are right angles
 Draw QR parallel to the x-axis
 Now angle RPQ = α { \ displaystyle RPQ = \ alpha} By substituting − β { \ displaystyle - \ beta } for β { \ displaystyle \ beta } and using Symmetry, we also get: Another simple "proof" can be given using Euler's formula known from complex analysis: Euler's formula is: Although it is more precise to say that Euler's formula entails the trigonometric identities, it follows that for angles α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } and β { \ displaystyle \ beta } we have: Also using the following properties of exponential functions: Evaluating the product: Equating real and imaginary parts: Using the figure above, By substituting - β { \ displaystyle - \ beta} for β { \ displaystyle \ beta} and using Symmetry, we also get: Also, using the complementary angle formulae, From the sine and cosine formulae, we get Dividing both numerator and denominator by cos ⁡ α cos ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ cos \ alpha \ cos \ beta }, we get Subtracting β { \ displaystyle \ beta} from α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, using tan ⁡ = - tan ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ tan = - \ tan \ beta}, Similarly from the sine and cosine formulae, we get Then by dividing both numerator and denominator by sin ⁡ α sin ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ sin \ alpha \ sin \ beta}, we get Or, using cot ⁡ θ = 1 tan ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cot \ theta ={ \ frac {1}{ \ tan \ theta }}} , Using cot ⁡ = - cot ⁡ β { \ displaystyle \ cot = - \ cot \ beta}, From the angle sum identities, we get and The Pythagorean identities give the two alternative forms for the latter of these: The angle sum identities also give It can also be proved using Euler's formula Squaring both sides yields But replacing the angle with its doubled version, which achieves the same result in the left side of the equation, yields It follows that Expanding the square and simplifying on the left hand side of the equation gives Because the imaginary and real parts have to be the same, we are left with the original identities and also The two identities giving the alternative forms for cos 2θ lead to the following equations: The sign of the square root needs to be chosen properly—note that if π is added to θ, the quantities inside the square roots are unchanged, but the left-hand-sides of the equations change sign
 Therefore the correct sign to use depends on the value of θ
 For the tan function, the equation is: Then multiplying the numerator and denominator inside the square root by and using Pythagorean identities leads to: Also, if the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by, the result is: This also gives: Similar manipulations for the cot function give: If ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi }, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } are the angles of a triangle, i
e
 ψ + θ + φ = π = { \ displaystyle \ psi + \ theta + \ phi = \ pi =} half circle, Proof: If ψ + θ + φ = π 2 = { \ displaystyle \ psi + \ theta + \ phi ={ \ tfrac { \ pi }{2}}=} quarter circle, Proof: Replace each of ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi }, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta }, and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } with their complementary angles, so cotangents turn into tangents and vice-versa
 Given so the result follows from the triple tangent identity
 First, start with the sum-angle identities: By adding these together, Similarly, by subtracting the two sum-angle identities, Let α + β = θ { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta = \ theta } and α − β = φ { \ displaystyle \ alpha - \ beta = \ phi } , Substitute θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} Therefore, Similarly for cosine, start with the sum-angle identities: Again, by adding and substracting Substitute θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} as before, The figure at the right shows a sector of a circle with radius 1
 The sector is θ / of the whole circle, so its area is θ / 2
 The area of triangle OAD is AB / 2, or sinθ / 2
 The area of triangle OCD is CD / 2, or tanθ / 2
 Since triangle OAD lies completely inside the sector, which in turn lies completely inside triangle OCD, we have This geometric argument applies if 0π / 2, then θ> 1
 But sinθ≤1, so sinθ <θ
 So we have For negative values of θ we have, by symmetry of the sine function Hence Proof: From the previous inequalities, we have, for small angles Therefore, Consider the right-hand inequality
 Since Multply through by cos ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cos \ theta} Combining with the left-hand inequality: Taking cos ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cos \ theta} to the limit as θ → 0 { \ displaystyle \ theta \ to 0} Therefore, Proof: The limits of those three quantities are 1, 0, and 1 / 2, so the resultant limit is zero
 Proof: As in the preceding proof, The limits of those three quantities are 1, 1, and 1 / 2, so the resultant limit is 1 / 2
 All these functions follow from the Pythagorean trigonometric identity
 We can prove for instance the function Proof: We start from Then we divide this equation by cos 2 ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle \ cos ^ {2} \ theta} Then use the substitution θ = arctan ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ theta = \ arctan}, also use the Pythagorean trigonometric identity: Then we use the identity tan ⁡ ≡ x { \ displaystyle \ tan \ equiv x} pokiri 2006 ek hit telegu film he jiskaa nirdesan, lekhan or nirmaan puri jagannadh ne kiya he

 But this is not an easy task

 It is actually run with the target group in mind
 faujee abhiyaan ki tarah ek suvyavasthit ranneeti apanaai jaati he
 Whether the attention of the people goes to any other letter or article or image or not, but when someone is afraid of his life etc
, he definitely pays attention to it
 is prakaar ke vigyaapan abhiyaan main log kisi tarah kaa bhay yaa dar dikhaa kar apni vigyaapan yojana ko purna karte hai
 a similar advertisement was reported in 2007 in Boston by bomb scare
 jisamen boston ke 10 shaharon main ek tarah kaa elidi roshni vaala upkaran jisamen vigyaapan hetu uski chhavi bani hui thi
 He was planted
 jise kisi aam naagarik ne bam samaj kar police ko phone kar diya or sabhi samachar vaale bhi is ghatana ko apane akhbaar yaa anya madhyam main dene hetu aa gaye
 Giving something for free with any item is only part of a type of advertisement
 isamen koi bhi is tarah kaa koi saamaan de detaa he
 So that anyone wants to buy that stuff
 jaise kii kisi ek vastu ko kharidne par aap jeet sakate hai ek karod kaa inaam aadi
 This makes anyone think that he will buy this item for a low price and if it happens, he will get a reward
 is kaaran kai baar log aavashyaktaa se adhik bhi kharid lete hai yaa kai baar anaavashyak vastu bhi kharid lete hai
 There is a need for some other thing in any area
 iskaa laabh vigyaapan abhiyaan main uthaaya jaataa he
 For example, if someone wants to sell his goods, he will see what people are going after
 vah us vastu ko swayan adhik sankhya main kharid legaa
 Which is also known as Jama Khori
 uske baad vah kisi vigyaapan main kah degaa kii yadi aapako is vastu ko khareednaa he to hamaare paas aayen
 Some such examples are more in food items
 kyonki koi bhi khaane ke saamaan ko hameshaa ke liye nahin rakh saktaa he
 Everyone needs it daily
 is kaaran kai company pyaaj, tamaato aadi jiskaa upyog log sabji khaanaa banane main karte hi hai
 He buys it himself and puts it somewhere
 iske baad jab vah vastu bazaar main kam ho jaati he to uske daam bad jate hai
 After this, the company sells it when it expires or its price rises
 lekin kabhi kabhi jamaa khori kaa pataa na lag jaye is kaaran vah use apane kisi vastu ke saath ek kilo muft aadi bol kar bechati he
 Because of which anyone feels that if such an expensive item is being available for free, then why not take it
 lekin iske peeche anya vastu main lagane vaale paise kii koi bhi nahin sochataa he

 In Italy, the 'leaning Tower of Pisa' is considered a marvelous piece of architecture
 Ever since its construction, the tower has been continuously tilting downwards and due to this tilt, it has also been famous all over the world
 Because of this, there was a danger that it would fall one day
 pichley das saal se ek vishesh pariyojna chal rahi thi jiskaa maqasad lining tower of pisa ko sthayitv dena tha
 Under this, 70 tons of soil was dug from the ground from the north of the tower so that it could be erected directly
 When this work was finished, the tower started to appear to be standing upright
 After seven years, now the tower is 48 cm straight
 Engineers say that for the first time this tower is now absolutely stable
 When the construction of Vastu Shilpa was going on in the 20th century, the workers felt that it was leaning on one side
 The workers tried to fix it but even after it was fully ready, the tower was still slightly bent
 Later on the foundation of the tower and inside the tower mounted a hi-tech camera
 It has been shown that the leaning of the Leaning Tower of Pisa has stopped
 Officials monitoring this program say that the tower should be stable for at least two hundred years
 Thousands of people from all over the world come to Pisa to see the tower
 a few years ago, the tower was closed because of the danger of falling It was done
 11 saal tak band rahane ke baad disambar 2001 main ise phir khol diya gaya tha
 The leaning tower of Pisa started to be built in the year 1173 but it took 200 years to complete this tower

 Diversified England developed Bhadra in such a way that it took the form of a separate structure called 'gelili'

 'bajirao Mastani' is an Indian historical romance film directed and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film maratha samrajya ke peshwa bajirao or uski duusari patni mastaani ke bare main bataati he
 Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have both played the lead characters, Priyanka Chopra plays Bajirao's first wife and Tanvi Azmi plays Bajirao's mother
 bajirao mastaani 18 disambar 2015 ko release hui he
 Bajirao Mastani film starts with the making of new Peshwa, Bajirao is chosen for this, after which people of all empires celebrate in this happiness
 phir achaanak bundelkhand se mastaani sahaayta ke liye aati he or bajirao ke sainikon se ladakar sidhe bajirao se milti he or unako manaakar bundelkhand le jaati he vahaan wo vahaan par pratidwindeeyon se donon milakar yuddh karte he or vahaan par vijay praapt karte hai
 After this, Bajirao celebrates Holi in Bundelkhand, meanwhile, Bajirao and Mastani fall in love
 duusare din bajirao waapas pune chale jate hai
 Meanwhile, while leaving, Bajirao gives his dagger to Mastani, due to which he gets married to a dagger in Bundelkhand, under this tradition Mastani goes to Pune
 vahaan par wo bajirao kii mata radhabai se milti he
 Radhabai does not want Mastani, because of this she starts hating
 iske baad chimaji appa shanivarwara dikhaate he tathaa isamen adbhut aainamahal bhi dikhaate hai
 When Mastani asks Radha Bai to accept the relationship, she gives it to Ghungroo and says that since now your relationship has been done, from now on you will dance in the festival
 phir satara se chhatrapati sahu kaa bulaava aata he tab bajirao vahaan jate he phir radhabai ek nai chaal chalati he or mastaani ko ghunghru dekar bhej detii he lekin mastaani vahaan pahunchakar ghunghru chhatrapati sahu ke saamne ghunghru rakh detii he is kaaran pant pratinidhi mehafil kaa apmaan maanate he lekin jab chhatrapati sahu ko pataa chalata he ki wo raja chhatrasaal kii beti he to wo inhen waapas jane ke liye kha dete he or bolte he ki tumhen kya chahie tab mastaani bolti he ki maine bajirao se ishq kiya he bajirao chahie
 After this Mastani waits for Bajirao when a storm comes and Bajirao comes there and marries Mastani
 isi bich kashibai ko bhi pataa chal jaataa he or wo bhi naaraaz ho jaati he
 Then Kashibai and Mastani have sons and are named
 kashibai ke putr kaa naam raghunatha rakhte he jabaki mastaani ke putr kaa naam samsher bahadur naam rakh dete hai
 Meanwhile, a fight ensues between Bajirao and Chimaji Appa
 bajirao sabhi se kahata he ki wo saptami ke din mastaani ko shanivarwara laaenge parantu krishnabhat or radhabai ye nahin karne ko kehete hai
 The film is based on Rau, an excellent historical novel by well-known Marathi novelist Nagnath Inamdar
 yah upanyaas marathi hi nahin balki sampurna bhartiya bhashaaon ke saphaltam aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he
 In this, excellent prolificity has been introduced while protecting both history and historiography
 is upanyaas main swaabhaavik rup se bharpoor naatakeeyata vidyaman he or padhate hue aisa lagata he jaise koi uttam dharawahik dekh rahe hon
 Its descriptive scenes are also engraved on the psyche like movie scenes
 aise upanyaas par aadhaarit hone se film main anek visheshtaayen swaabhaavik rup se aa gayi hai
 This story has shone even further by a proven director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film main paathya rachana se kuch antar aa janaa to swaabhaavik hi rahata he kyonki donon ke madhyam bhinn hote hai, parantu is film main kuch antar jaanboojhkar filmi latakon-jhatkon ke rup main laaye gayi hai, jisase itihaas-bodh ko dhakka pahunchaa he
 In the early scenes, the scene appointing Bajirao as Peshwa is also very good and appropriate, and despite being outside the novel, it is completely consistent with the historicity and sense of history; But the scene in which Kashibai's old friend, whose husband Peshwa is killed due to Bajirao and therefore curses her husband by leaving her ashes there, has made a clear distinction
 upanyaas main kashibai kii kushal gruhinee ke rup main garimamayi upasthiti he, jabaki film main kashibai ko chanchal kishori kii taraf uchhalte dikhalaakar itihaas bodh ko khandit kar diya gaya he
 The filmmaker has also forgotten that the son of Kashibai, who is filming like this, is getting young and he was the main doer of that festival
 yahan kashibai peshwa kii patni na lag kar filmi heroin 'priyanka chopra' hi lagati he
 The carrying of Bajirao by army with the help of Chhatrasal has also become absolutely historic
 dekhne main bahut rochak he, lekin mastaani ke dwaara aisa na to hua tha, na ho saktaa tha
 Even leaving aside such minor scenes, the filmmaker has made two unforgivable mistakes - Srimanta Bajirao Peshwa and Kashibai have been caught at different times
 us yug main or peshwa parivaar main kashibai jaisi stri, jo ek tarah se rani hi thi, yadi naachati hoti to nartkiyon ko vishesh rup se rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hoti
 The special thing in that too is that at the time when Kashibai is danced with Mastani in the film, the pain in her foot was increased even more in those days
 mastaani se kashibai kii bhent bhi bilkul bhinn tareeke kii or filmi latakon-jhatkon vaali ho gayi he
 Therefore, for the sake of creative enjoyment with historicity, the above novel has to be read, but the film has done the task of taking the extraordinary love story and great life of Mahan Bajirao Peshwa and Mastani to people outside of Maharashtra as well, for this film The filmmaker definitely deserves thanks
