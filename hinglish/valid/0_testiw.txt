 The design has not only been developed with the intention of evoking feelings of fear and apprehension in the player, but has also tried to make the game environment scary in which the player is less likely to see the attacking enemies

 Swan and Campbell call a conference meeting with Melkom Betruger as the first part of the investigation into complaints and incidents about the facility, while the Marine operates as ordered by Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly
 keli marine ko delta leb ke ek vaigyanik ko khojane ke nirdesh detaa he jo gaayab ho gaya he
 The Marine finds the scientist at a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is desperately trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiment
 haalanki, jab vah sthiti ke bare main marine ko spasht karne kii koshish karata he, ek or tele portesan pareekshan kiya jaataa he or niyantran kho diya jaataa he, jis bindu par puraa mangal base aprakritik jhatkon se hill rahaa he, base ke adhikansh karmchaaree zombis main badal jate hai, kyonki nark ke bal teleporter ke portal ke madhyam se akraman karte hai
 Now to stop the attack of the base's changed zombies and the Hell's Demons attack, the Marine returns to Mars City, where Kelly orders the Marines from the remote to form links with the other Marines, saying that at the main communications facility Calls to get a transmission card to call
 jaise jaise marine base main hokar aage badhati he, use pataa chalata he ki swaan or campbell zindaa hai, ve bhi sanchaar suvidha kii ore ja rahe hai taaki mangal kii sthiti ke anusaar kisi sandesh ko bhejne se roka ja sake
 Marine squads are attacked by daemons, killed, and although the marines obtain transmission cards, it is too late to prevent devices from being destroyed by the Campbells in the communications facility
 Kelly, however, instructs the Marines to have a backup system, ordering the Marines to either obey Kelly's orders or use Swan's reasoning for keeping Mars separate
 Accept Assuming not understand the true nature of, till the invasion, so there's no threat to Earth
 sancharan bheja gaya he yaa nahin is aadhaar par, marine ko keli yaa swaan ke dwaara delta leb jane ke liye kaha jaataa he

 According to a scientist found alive in the Marine Lab, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by ancient civilization to protect against the forces of Hell
 vaigyanik yah bhi bataata he ki akraman tab shuru hua jab betrugar ne game kii shuruyaat main portal main sol kyub liya or ise nark main jamaa kar diya
 The Marine captures Betruger through the lab, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after Betruger is trapped in a trap
 portal marine ko sidhe nark main le jaataa he, jahaan vah sol kyub ke liye damens kii badi sankhya ke madhyam se ladata he or apane demonic abhibhavak ko haraa detaa he
 The Marine is then able to resume teleportation equipment left by research expeditions in Hell and return to Delta Lab
 betrugar, haalanki, marine ko bataata he ki yadhyapi mukhya euasi teleporter nasht ho chukaa he, nark mangal par ek nark kaa dwaar khol rahaa he, jo kai million damens ko mangal par laane main sakasham he
 Subsequently, in Delta Labs, the Marine encounters an injured swan
 swaan marine ko suchit karata he ki keli puure samay se nark ke saath kaam kar rahaa he or use damens ke dwaara roopantarit kar diya gaya he
 After telling the Marine that Campbell is behind Kelly, Swann gives the Marine his PDA, which informs him of the position of Hell's Gate below the surface of Mars and assures him that he alone can find a way out of the base
 Will try haalanki, jab marine base ke kendriya computer processing sector main campbell ke saath pakad main aa jaataa he, campbell buree tarah se ghayal ho jaataa he or marane se pehle keval itnaa hi kah paata he ki keli campbell kaa bienji 9000 hathiyaar le ja chukaa he
 After this, Kelly Damon's voice taunts the Marine
 ant main marine se kendriya computer kor main keli kaa saamana ho jaataa he, jo keli ko ek siburnetic maanav bataata he jise tanks jaise aadhaar par grapht kiya gaya he
 The Marine succeeds in killing Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 under the surface of the Marine and into the depths before heading to Site 3, the same archaeological dig where the Soul Cube was

 They find the Marine alive, but they find out that Swan is dead

 is yojana se yah baat saamne ai ki duum kii rimeking par idi software main vivaad bad rahaa he
 Two owners of id software, Kevin Cloud and Adrian Kermake, were always opposed to remaking Doom, believing that id is often returning to similar formulas and properties

 ID Software began development of Doom 3 in late 2000, just after its completion Quake III: Team Arena
 In 2001, it was presented to the public at the Macworld Conference & Expo in Tokyo and later performed at E3 2002, where a 15-minute game demo was shown

 Early in the development of Doom 3 ', Trent Ranger of the band Nine Inch Nails, a fan of Doom Games, composed the music and sound effects for Doom 3
 haalanki, "samay, dhan or bure prabandhan ke kaaran", trent reconar ke kisi bhi dhwani prabhaav yaa sangeet ko antim utpaada nahin banaaya gaya
 Finally, former Nine Inch Nails drummer, Chris Vrenna, composed and performed the game's theme song

 2002 ke ant main, atiai technologys ke do karmchaariyon ne duum 3 ke ek dawalpment sanskaran ko internet par li kar diya
 a year later, a new trailer was released on E3 2003, and shortly thereafter, the id Software's website was updated for the upcoming project of Doom 3, although it was also announced that Doom 3 was in the 2003 holiday season Will not be ready for jon keramek ke anusaar, vikaas main ummid se zyada samay laga; mul rup se, game ko 2003 kii christmas par release karne kii yojana banaayi gayi thi

 a week before the game's release, it became known that an agreement had been reached by ID Software and Creative Labs to incorporate EAX audio technology into Doom 3, heavily influenced by a software patent from another company
 is patent main aisi takanic ke saath deal kiya gaya tha jo chaaya pradarshit karne ke liye thim or inhen keramek kaa reverse kaha jaataa tha, jinka vikaas swatantra rup se jon keramek or creative leb ke programmers donon ke dwaara kiya gaya
 ID Software was to be placed under legal obligation to use the technology in the completed game, so to end the issue, ID Software agreed to license Creative Lab Technologies in exchange for compensation
 jon keramek ke anusaar, ai di software main pramukh graphics ingine develper, duum 3 kii takanic ko teen praathmik visheshtaon ke dwaara samarthan praapt hua: ekikrut prakaash or chhayakaran, jatil anemeshan or aisi patakatha jo puri tarah se dynamik par-picksal prakaash or stencil chaaya ke saath vaastaviktaa ko darshaati he or jeeyuai kii sataha jisamen game ke liye atirikt antarkriyasheeltaa shaamil he
 The advanced key to the ID Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is integrated lighting and shading

 To increase interactivity with the game world, ID Software has designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers

 This allows the in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, operating the security door code, activating the machinery, unlocking the weapon locker or toggling the light, according to Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patric Duffy Wrote more than 500,000 lines of script code and created more than 25,000 image files to create graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3
 Other important features of the game engine are general mapping and highlighting of the text in a specular form, real handling of object physics, dynamic, realistic sound tracks and multi-channel sound
 The Doom 3 on the x Box supports 480p wide screen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5
1 surround sound
 3 april 2005 ko, ai di software ne windos par duum 3 ke liye ek vistaar release kiya
 The expansion, called Resurrection of Evil, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that is also a partner of ID Software in many other projects, such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and x Box Conversion of Doom
 Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on 24 May 2005 and an x box version was released on 5 October 2005
 is vistaar kii visheshta thi ek baarah staron kaa ekal khiladi abhiyaan, jise mul kahani rekha ke do varsh baad set kiya gaya or teen nae hathiyaar bhi isamen shaamil the, jinamein se ek game main bhautikee kii disha main he

 The reception of Evil was not as positive as that of Doom 3, but it nonetheless received favorable reviews from industry critics
 Best Graphics Doom 3 was a complex and commercial success for ID Software; By early 2007, more than 3
5 million copies of Doom 3 had been sold, making it the most successful ID software project to date

 Doom 3 'graphics and presentation quality were highly praised; Game Spot described the game's environment as "suitably lively, densely atmospheric, and surprisingly expensive", while PC Gamer UK described the graphics and non-player characters' modeling and animation as too "fluid"
 ijien ke den adams ne note kiya ki game kii pregentation main game kaa bahut ucch anupaat shaamil he, unhone kaha ki "vaataavaran ke bina, duum 3 ek saadhaaran shooter he, jo '90 ke dashak' ke saamaan he
 "in addition, many reviewers have praised id software for making the game so good at low graphics levels
 kai samikshakon ne game ke parisar or setting kii bhi prashansa kii he; game spot ke greg kasvin ne varnit kiya "jo ahsaas duum 3 main he, vah puri tarah se vaastavik duniya main he" jabaki ijien ne note kiya ki "euaisi base main bhi bahut hi yathartwaadee bhaavana he, jo vaastaviktaa kaa ahsaas karaati he
 Notably, Eurogamer stated that the game's opening sequence "fits on excellent ideas" defining the half-life of Valve Software
 kai samikshakon ne kaha ki duum 3 "ran and gan" game style ke saamaan he jo apane purvavartiyon ke saath safal tha or is avyav ke liye game kii vaikalpik rup se prashansa or aalochana kii gayi
 Over time, there were several complex reviews of synchronization in the game
 iske alaava, game kii kritrim hoshiyaari ko vishesh rup se chunauteepurn nahin mana gaya, gamespot main note kiya gaya ki "shatru usee prakaar ke anumaanit pratirupon kaa anusaran karata he jise pichley duum games se yaad kiya ja saktaa he" jabaki gamespai ne kaha ki jis tarah se shatru khiladi par hamalaa karte hai, vah "vicitra" he; samikshakon ke anusaar khiladi yah mahasoos karte hai ki ek hathiyaar ko uthaane se kai prakaar ke zombis andhere main chupe hue kakshon se bahar nikal aate hai
 In addition, many reviewers said that the game's way of conveying the story is "ineffective", complicating it for a player character's lack of recognition
 ant main, game ke multiplayer main navinikaran kii kami he, kyonki isaki khiladi seemaa kam he or game ke mods kii sankhya bhi kam he, yah tathy vishesh rup se ai di software ke influential quek III arina ke vipareet sahi he
 The x Box version of Doom 3 received the same level of support, scoring 88 percent on Metacritic and 87

 sabase pehle usne qandahar par kabza kiya
 Here Shah Ismail suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the Turks
 is yuddh ke baad shah ismail tathaa babar, donon ne barudi hathiyaaron kii sainya mahatta samajhate hue iskaa upyog apni sena main aarambh kiya
 After this he attacked Ibrahim Lodi
 panipat main ladi gai is ladaai ko panipat kaa pratham yuddh ke naam se jaanate hai
 This war was fought on 21 April 1526 according to Baburnama
 isamen babar kii sena ibrahim lodi kii sena ke saamne bahut choti thi
 But in the absence of organization in the army, Ibrahim Lodi lost this war to Babur
 iske baad dilli kii satta par babar kaa adhikaar ho gaya or usne san 1526 main mughalavansh kii neenv daali
 The Rajputs had become quite organized and powerful under the leadership of Rana Sanga
 rajputon ne ek bada-sa kshetra swatantra kar liya tha or ve dilli kii satta par kaabiz hona chaahate the
 Babur's army was not even half of the Rajputs
 17 march 1527 main khanvaa kii ladaai rajputon tathaa babar kii sena ke bich ladi gai
 The victory of the Rajputs seemed certain
 par yuddh ke dauraan tomaron ne rana sanga kaa saath chhod diya or babar se ja mili
 After this, Rana Sanga got out of the war by his companions in an injured state and a simple victory seemed to come out of his hands
 iske ek saal ke baad kisi mantri dwaara zehar khilaane kaaran rana sanga kii 30 janvari 1528 ko maut ho gai or babar kaa sabase bada dar uske maathe se tal gaya
 After this Babur became the undisputed officer of the throne of Delhi
 aane vaale dinon main mughal vansh ne bharat kii satta par 300 saalon tak raaj kiya
 After Babur laid the foundation of the Mughal dynasty, the Mughals left an indelible mark on the culture of India
 khanvaa kaa yuddh 17 march 1527 main mewar ke shaasha rana sanga or babar ke madhya hua tha
 In this, Ibrahim Lodi's brother Mehmood Lodi sided with Rana, in which Rana Sanga was defeated and Babur was conquered
 yahi se babar ne bharat main rahane kaa nishchay kiya is yuddh main hin pratham baar babar ne dharm yuddh jehad kaa naaraa diya isi yuddh ke baad babar ne gaji arthath dani kii oopaadhi lee thi
 
 kaha jaataa he ki apane putr humayu ke biimaar padane par usne allaah se humayun ko swasthy karne tathaa uski beemaari khud ko diye jane kii prarthana kii thi
 After this Babur's health deteriorated and he eventually died in 1530 at the age of 48
 uski ichha thi ki use kabul main dafanaaya jaae par pehle use agra main dafanaaya gaya
 After about nine years Humayu fulfilled his wish and buried him in Kabul

 varanasi kshetra ke vistaar ke anek puranic uddhran uplabdh hai
 According to the pilgrimage discussion and other ancient texts given in Karyakalpataru: uparokt uddharanon se gyaat hota he ki pracheen varanasi kaa vistaar kaaphi dur tak tha
 The fort of Rajghat west of Varuna where ancient Varanasi is no doubt inhabited is a mile long and 400 yards wide
 ganga nadi uske dakshin-purv mukh kii raksha karti he or varuna nadi uttar or uttar-purv mukhon kii raksha ek chhichhli khai ke rup main karti he, pashchim kii ore ek khaali naala he jisamen se hokar kisi samay varuna nadi bahati thi
 Given this natural means of defense, perhaps in ancient times this place was chosen for the city of Varanasi
 san 1857 i
 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke samay angrejon ne bhi nagar raksha ke liye varuna ke peeche oonchi jameen par kachi mitti kii deevaaren uthaakar kilebandi kii thi
 The limit of Varanasi in the Puranas is much more than the length and breadth of Rajghat
 un varnanon se lagata he ki vahaan keval nagar kii seemaa hi nahin varnit he, balki puure kshetra ko sammilit kar liya gaya he
 The remains of ancient settlements are found far to the far side of Varuna
 atah sambhav he ki puraanon main mili varnan ve sab bhaag bhi aa gayi hon
 If we consider this area to be connected to the city, then the length and breadth of the city described in the Puranas is almost right
 gautam buddha ke janm purv mahajanapad yug main varanasi kaashi janapad kii rajdhani thi
 But it is difficult to estimate accurately about the expansion of ancient Kashi district
 jaatakon main kaashi kaa vistaar 300 yojan diya gaya he
 In the north of Kashi district was Kosal district, Magadha district in the east and Vatsa in the west
 itihaasavetta dow oltekar ke matanusaar kaashi janapad kaa vistaar uttar-pashchim kii ore 250 mile tak tha, kyonki iskaa purv kaa padosi janapad magadh or uttar-pashchim kaa padosi janapad uttar paanchal tha
 According to the Jataka, the boundaries of Kashi and Kosal were mixed
 kaashi kii dakshin seemaa kaa sahi varnan uplabdh nahin he, shaayad isaliye ki vah vindhyas shrinkhalaa tak gai hui thi va aage koi aabaadi nahin thi
 On the basis of the natives, the expansion of Kashi must have been extending from present Ballia to Kanpur
 yahaan shri rahul sankrutyaayan kehete hai, ki aadhunik banaras kamishnari hi pracheen kaashi janapad rahaa tha
 It is possible that some part of modern Gorakhpur Commissionerate has been included in Kashi district
 vartmaan varanasi se pracheen varanasi nishchay hi bahut bhinn rahaa hoga
 In the parts of densely populated areas of today's Banaras district, forests were spread in those parts till the Gahadwal era
 pracheen shahar main asankhya talabon or pushkariniyon kaa bhi bhi varnan aata he, jinamein bahut si to 19veen shatabdi tak batch gayi thim, kintu ab lagbhag sabhi nasht praaia: ho gayi he
 The sewers, which once cut the land of Varanasi, have also been washed away
 brahmanal kabhi chowk tak pahunchati thi, vahaan shahar kii ghani aabaadi he or naalon ke to ab keval naam hi batch gaye hai
 It is known from the natives that dense forests were spread around Benares
 kaashi janapad ke jin graamon ityadi kaa varnan aata he, unamem adhiktar aadhunik banaras tehsil ke athwa jonpur ke the jo pracheen kaashi janapad kaa ang tha
 The ancient Mrigdava and Isipattan, whose present name is Sarnath, is in the Banaras tehsil and Machhikhand and Keetagiri are in Jaunpur
 sambhavat: chandauli tehsil madhyakaal main basii ho, kintu kam-se-kam is tehsil main abhi tak guptkaal yaa uske pehle ke bhagnavshesh nahin mili hai par gahadwal yug main chandauli tehsil puri tarah se bas chuki thi
 The former native princely state of Ramnagar is also included in Banaras district - 25 0 80 'and 25 0 35' north latitude and 78 0 56 'and 79 0 52' east longitudinal stretches on both sides of the Ganges
 sampurna banaras jila ganga kii ghati main sthit he or iske bhu-garbhik staron se mitti ke sivaa or kuch nahin nikalataa, kyonki vindhyachal kii pahadiyaan mirzapur jile tak simit hai
 Depth of soil in the district is not known, but digging deep wells gives loam up to 35 feet, followed by 27 feet of frozen soil and red sand with water springs below it
 prakritik banaavat ke aadhaar par banaras ko do bhaagon main vageekrut kar sakate hai: These two parts are divided by the high-low agreements of the Ganges
 in karaaron kii bhinnata jameen prakruti or nadi ke bahaav par bhi avlambit hai
 The two parts of Banaras differ from each other mainly in ground floor and slope
 jile ke pashchimi bhaag main banaras tehsil or gangapore tathaa bhadohi sammilit hai or ye purv kii chandauli tehsil se upekshaakrit ooncha hai
 The ground surface in the Banaras tehsil is eastward and southeastward
 jal sroton kaa bahaav ganga kii ore ko he isi liye jile kaa pashchimi bhaag nicha-ooncha pathaar he
 Where the roads of Jaunpur and Azamgarh cross Banaras from the north, their height is 238 and 250 feet respectively
 banaras kii oonchai samudri sataha se 252 foot he or yah ganga kii sabase kam oonchai 197 foot he
 In the northeast ie Pargana Jalhupur, this surface gradually comes across the sand across the river and remains 238 feet
 sataha kii is oonchai-nichaai ke kaaran jile ke pashchimi bhaag kii samtal jameen utkrisht he
 This moor near the water dividers is called Sabai, after which it becomes a moor ie sand
 jile kii nichali jameen matiyaar kehalaati he or usamen jhiilon or talabon kii sinchai se dhan kii acchhee paidaavaar hoti he
 The above description of the natural structure of the Banaras tehsil makes the reason for making this place its center when the Aryans arrive
 acchhee jameen, pani kii sulabhta tathaa aayaat-niryaat ke saadhan iske mukhya kaaran the
 The highway of ancient age also went from Varanasi to Ghazipur towards Bihar as there were dense forests on the present Grand Trunk route
 ganga paar ke kshetron main vartmaan chandauli tehsil main jameen nichi hone se barsaati pani choti nadiyon main baadh laakar kaaphi nuksaan pahunchataa he or pani ke bahaav kaa thik rasta na hone se sinchai main kathinaayee aati thi
 Due to the low land here, there has been more outbreak of malaria
 atharv veda kii papplad shakha main varanasi main based anaryon se aprasann hokar sookhtkaal kaashi janapad par takma kaa dhaava karne ko kahata he
 Possibly in ancient times, people were very much afraid of Takma ie Malaria and their fear was also natural because before the invention of Quinine, Malaria was a heavy death killer

 Reiki is a spiritual action developed in 1926 by Mikao Usui
 japan ke mount kuramaa main teen saptaah tak upwas karne or dhyaan lagane ke baad usui ne "urja ganvaae bina upachaar karne" kii kshamta praapt karne kaa daawa kiya
 a part of this action, the treatment done by tenohira or palm, is used as a complementary and alternative treatment ie complementary and alternative medicine
 tenohira ek aisi takanic he jisamen chikitsak yah maanate hai ve hatheliyon ke madhyam se "upachaar karne vaali urja" ko hatheliyon se bhejte hai
 There is no scientific evidence of the existence of ki or the process of its execution, and a procedural review of randomized clinical trials conducted in 2008 did not support the effect of Reiki or its recommendation for use during treatment under any circumstances
 saanchaa:energy therapy "mysterious atmosphere, spiritual power" Reiki जापानी 気 is a Japanese word quoted from the Chinese language Lingki 靈氣, according to some chinese-english dictionaries it means: "spiritual influence and atmosphere"; "1 intelligence; the power to understand अलौ supernatural power or strength present in fairy tales; miraculous power or strength ";" 1 spiritual influence 2 cleverness, cunning "
 yah japani yogic do bhinn ekal shabdon,re 霊 "bhoot, paramatma, aatma; alokik, ishwariya, vivy sharir" or kii 気 "gas, vaayu; shwaas; urja; takat; vaataavaran; mood; iraadaa; bhaavana; dhyaan" yahaan jiskaa arth qi "aadhyatmik urja; mahatvapurn urja; jivan shakti; jivan kii urja" se he" se milakar bana he
 Some equivalent translations of Reiki from the japanese-english dictionary are: "experience of mystery", "mystical environment", and "a virtual environment; Presence of any soul
 " The English word Reiki or Reiki is a transliteration of the original word of the Japanese language
 reki shabd kaa upyog vyakaran kii drushti se sangya ,kriya yaa visheshan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Some Western writers translate Reiki lightly, calling it worldly life energy
 is tukka se anuwaad aanshik rup se galat ho jaataa he: kii kaa arth to "jivan urja" he -lekin re kaa arth "sansaarik" nahin he
 In 1922, Mikao Usui produced Reiki by performing 21 days of meditation on Mount Kurama, during which he meditated, fasted and prayed
 usui kaa kahana tha ki rahasy kaa rahasyodghatan karke jise ham reki kehete hai uske liye usne dusron par lagu karne or unhen anukool banane ke liye aavashyak gyaan or aadhyatmik shakti praapt kar lee thi
 In April 1922, Usui moved to Tokyo and established Usui Reiki Rioho Gakkai there
 usui samraat miji kii saahitiyik kritiyon ko ek prashansak tha or apni reki pranali ko viksit karne kii prakriya main usne samraat kii kuch saahitiyik kritiyon ko nitiyukt siddhanton ke rup main dhaal liya, jo aage chalakar reki ke siddhant kehalaae
 Many teachers and practitioners of Reiki aim to follow these five principles, the translation of one of them is as follows: usui ne 2000 se adhik shishyon ko reki kaa upyog karnaa sikhaaya
 Sixteen of those pupils continued their training until they reached the Shinpiden level, the level equivalent to the third degree, or postgraduate level, of Western countries
 usui kaa dehavsaan san 1926 main hua
 After Usui's demise, a former Usui disciple named Chujiro Hayashi left Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakai to form his own separate organization
 hayashi ne shaareerik upachaar par jor dekar or reki takneekon ke ek adhik code banaae hue or saral samooh kaa upyog karke reki ke paathon ko saral bana diya
 Hayashi started and trained Hawayo Takata, who practiced Reiki practice and traveled the United States heavily, teaching the first two levels
 takaata ne reki ke dwaara upachaar karne or use sikhaane ke liye shulk lene kii mahatta par bal diya
 In 1976, Takata began teaching the Shinpiden stage and named this level the Reiki Master for the first time
 usne master prashikshan ke liye $1 xxrep 4 0 kaa mulya bhi nirdhaarit kiya
 Takata died in 1980
 tab tak vah 22 reki mastaron ko prashikshit kar chuki thi
 Much of what Reiki was taught outside of Japan goes to his work
 aaj, kai reki pranaliyaan maujuud hai, lekin pramukh pranaliyaan kii sankhya keval 2 he, jinhen kramash:paramparaagat japani reki or pashchimi reki ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The term traditional Japanese Reiki is generally used only to describe a particular system that was formed from the teachings of Usui and did not spread outside of Japan
 lagbhag 1990 ke dashak main, kuch pashchimi shikshak reki kii is vishesh pranali kii khoj karne ke liye japan kii yatra par gaye, haalanki unhen vahaan kuch nahin mila
 So they started to establish Reiki schools and teach Reiki to the Japanese
 aisa hone ke turant baad, japani jo reki kriya kaa abhyaas kar rahe the or jinhone is baat ko ek raaj banaakar rakhaa hua tha, duniya ke saamne aae or unhone apane gyaan kaa prasar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Since then, many traditional Japanese Reiki systems have come into existence, with some of the major systems listed below
 usui reki rioho gakai shikshakon ke us samaaj kaa naam he jinhone apane swayan ke usui kii sthapana kii
 This style has survived to modern times only because of Ushida as Ushida was the man who, at the time of his death, made Usui the successor of the president of the Sangh
 yah samaaj kai varshon tak ek raaj bana rahaa tha or vartmaan main, masaki kondoh naamak shikshak gakai ke adhyaksh hai
 Many of his teachings are still a mystery, though little by little nowadays, members of this association are sharing their knowledge with the rest of the world, one of these members being Master Hiroshi Doi
 in sabake baavjood, yah samaaj aaj bhi ek aisa band samaaj bana hua he jahaan tak pahunch paanaa mushkil he
 The name Rido Reiki Gakai is given to a system created by the masters of Gakai and led by Fuminori Aoki
 fuminori aoki ne gakai kii shiksha main apni baaten jodin, haalanki shikshan main antar bahut kam he
 In this system, the symbol Koriki inspired by Fuminori Aoki was assimilated
 comio reki kaai kaa naam us pranali ko diya gaya jisane japani paramparaagat reki ke ek skool kaa naam le rakhaa he or jo hyaakuten inaamoto sensei dwaara sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It differs from other systems in that it did not originate from Gakai, but from the Hayashi dynasty by Chiyoko Yagamuchi, who remained in Japan
 iske antargat adhik gyaan or vishisht kaushal shaamil he or saath hi usui ke moulik chihn zui-un, fukuyu, honja-ze-shonen or dai-ko-myo shaamil hai
 Currently, Hyakuten Inamoto Sensei is considered the successor of Mikao Usui as his spiritual development level is quite high
 jikyden reki kaa naam us pranali ko diya gaya jo comio reki kaai se milti julati he or jiskaa vikaas sushri yamaguchi ke putr taadaao yamaguchi dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Western Reiki, or Occidental Reiki, is a system developed by Ms
 Hawayo Takata
 is pranali kaa prasar hawaii se california tak hua or phir iskaa prasar baaki pashchimi deshon main hua
 As a result of the Second World War, Mrs
 Takata decided to make amendments to the system in such a way that the system would be more simple and reliable to understand according to the mentality of Western countries
 jaisaa paramparaagat japani reki ke saath hua tha, shrimati takaata kii style se bhi kai vibhinn pranaliyaan astitv main ain, unamem se pramukh pranaliyaan neeche soochibaddh hai Reiki Usui Shiki is the name given to the western system of Ryoho Reiki, which means "usui's system of natural healing," and is a system that has sincerely attempted to maintain the fundamental actions of Hawayo Takata
 yah shrimati takaata dwaara sthapit ek mul pranali he or aaj bhi iskaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, jaise reki elliance ke saath he, jiskaa netritv shrimati takaata kii potee philis lee furumoto kar rahi he
 The levels are present in this system as in most of the western systems of Reiki, the number of these levels in this system is three, their names are first degree, second degree and master respectively
 is pranali main chaar moulik pratikon kaa upyog kiya he haalanki ye pratik takaata sanskaran ke hai, inke naam hai cho-ku re, se-hi-kaai, hon-sha-ze-sho-nen or dai-ku-myo usui
 Tibetan Reiki is the name given to that system, William L
 Was developed by an American gentleman named Rand
 yah takaata kii shikshaaon par aadhaarit ek or pranali he, haalanki is pranali main or bhi adhik pratik maujuud hai or rand ne is pranali main maansik arthath aadhyatmik surgery ke darshan ko joda- or aisa kisi pranali main hua ho, yah pehali baar hua tha
 The name is quoted from two Tibetan symbols in the system itself and some Buddhist teachings, however, instead of the three levels of Reiki Usui Shiki Ryoho, it has four levels, called / first degree, second degree, third degree and master respectively
 is pranali main kul saat pratik maujuud hai 
 Everything else in it is the same as in Western Reiki, although it has the following additional symbols; Tibetan dai-ko-myo, Raku, Fire Snake, Dragon of Fire and Tumo
 iske alaava, aise swatantra shikshak or chote sanghathan bhi hai jinhone reki ke prasar kii jaisi aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii, vaisaa hi uskaa prasar kiya or is tarah se takaata kii pranali jari he, ye shikshak aaj bhi un bandishon se azaad hai jinase reki se sambandhit bade sanghathan bandhe rahete hai
 For some years there was a dispute in some schools of Reiki about its successor, this dispute was because each of them said that they are the real descendants of Reiki and the claims of the rest are fabricated, although in most places it is believed Is that the worldwide action of Reiki cannot be the legacy of any one school
 jendai reki ho naam us pranali ko diya gaya he jo uparyukt donon pranaaliyon kaa mishran he
 Since Hiroshi Doi was already well versed in many healing skills and was the first pupil trained by Ms
 Meiko Mitsui, a master of "sharpness techniques", she established the system
 use usui reki rioho gakai kii sadsyta san 1993 main pradaan kii gai thi
 This system describes the traditional Japanese Reiki and Western systems as complementary to each other, but it is still basically a Western Reiki, as Doi Sensei does not have the aptitude of a traditional Japanese master
 paaramparik japani reki or oxidental reki main siddhantat: antar maujuud hai, udhaaharan ke liye reki kriya ke dauraan haathon kii mudra; pashchimi reki main hayashi sensei or sushri takaata ke haathon kii mudra ek vishesh sthaan rakhti he, paramparaagat japani reki main sampurna upachaaron ko lagu karne ke liye haathon kii in mudraon kaa koi astitv nahin he
 Instead, the treatment session in traditional Japanese Reiki begins with Reiki-ho, an innate skill under which "it is known where to place the hands
" " iske alaava paramparaagat japani reki main sharir ke nishchit kshetron main halki maalish, thapakiyaan or halke mukke maare jate hai, iske saath hi haathon kii mudraon ko keval kathin rogon kaa upachaar karne ke liye hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Conversely, the grip of traditional Japanese Reiki allows for the phasing of energy, personal development, and spiritual changes as improvements in light, gasho attention, and respiratory techniques are concerned
 duusari ore, reki kii pashchimi paramparaayen rogon ke upachaar par adhik jor detii hai
 In addition, on the one hand, while in the Western style, pupils climb up the staircase by completing courses and starting on the other hand, on the other hand in traditional Japanese Reiki, this staircase of progress is progressively and slowly climbed and so on
 The Reiki Master decides which would be the appropriate time to get the next adjustment
 vartmaan main, pashchimi reki ke kuch shikshakon ne jaankaree or pratikon se apane swayan kii pranaliyaan viksit kar lee hai or pratik kaa upyog karne ke saath-saath haath kii un mudraon kaa upyog kiya he jinka prashikshan reki main athwa kaary ke rup main diya jaataa he
 Some of the western systems have been established only in the last few years and are not descended from the systems of Mikao Usui
 in pranaaliyon main karunaa reki, sechim yaa SKHM, reki satori, renbo reki, saltic reki, kundalini reki, karunaa kaai, nauveen kaai kii reki, bioreki, shambala reki, tera maai reki or tibeti-tantric reki shaamil hai
 Interestingly, most of the above mentioned systems claim to use better energy than Reiki Usui and use more powerful symbols
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhni bahut zaruri he ki reki kii pranaaliyon ko viksit karne vaale sabhi mastaron ke bich, keval mikaao usui hi ek aisa gyaat naam he jiske bare main mana jaataa he ki wo satori sthiti tak pahunchaa tha
 He created a free system about ego, spiritual growth, and healing, a simple system with an array of extremely useful tools as well as a philosophy based on love and respect
 reki kii uparyukt sabhi pranaaliyon main se sarvadhikaar vyapak or vishwa str par manyata paane vaali paanch pranaliyaan nimnlikhit hai; usui reki rioho gakai, tibeti reki, karunaa reki, reki sechim-sekhem or comyo reki or in anya pranaaliyon main se vyapak rup se manyata praapt anya teen kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Karuna reiki karunaa ek sanskrit shabd he jiskaa upyog hindu, tibeti buddha or zan buddha dharmon main kiya gaya he or iskaa arth kisi bhi prakaar kaa dayaa-sahanubhootiyukt kaary he
 The system was established in the United States by Catherine Milner and is today known as "tera Mai"
 is pranali kaa spain se parichay san 1995 main antonio moraaga ne karavaaya tha, usne bharat main shodh karne ke baad, anya pratikon or takneekon ko isamen shaamil kiya or is tarah se karunaa-prakruti 
 is pranali main prakruti-karunaa reki pratik maujuud hai jinhen vibhinn samayon par vibhinn reki mastaron ke liye charanbaddh kiya gaya he
 His system has phased out the initials and has been developed by Antonio Moraga and includes the unique value of 21 new symbols of power, which can be combined with the Usui system and the japani-tibetan tantric
 prakruti urja ke bhaag pratik swami prem anand dwaara die gaye the, jinhone badale main unhen pratikon ko master kirum ko saunpa, jisane unhen antonio moraaga ko saunp diya
 The symbols of compassion-nature, in addition to mystical healing due to their intense energy, include love and friendship, increased self-esteem, restoring emotional balance, renouncing karma, increasing awareness and purity, harmonizing the chakras
 , Providing clarity about our existence and creating peace and ultimate peace, such as qualities
 tibeti-tantric reki tibeto-tantric Reiki, also known as Tibetan Reiki, is a system that consists of 11 symbols of power
 shikshaaon ke anusaar in pratikon kaa upyog kiye jane par un rogon kaa nidaan kiya ja saktaa he jo karmon ke kaaran hue hai
 Some of these claims have been claimed to diagnose cancer and AIDS, and also claim to reestablish conformity between different parts and levels of consciousness
 inamen se chaar pratikon ko "tibeti pratik" kaa naam diya gaya he or anya saat pratikon ko "tantric pratik" kaha gaya he
 According to the teachings, these symbols came from the teachings of a secret successor of the Shakyamuni Buddha named Padmasambhava, who introduced Tibet to Buddhism
 pratikon or tibeti tantric kaa uddeshy sadhak ko mahatvapurn shakti pradaan karnaa or uski kundalini shakti jaagrit karnaa he
 These symbols also work on chakras
 reki sekhem-sechim Reiki sekhem-sechim is quoted from the Egyptian Sekhem, meaning "the power of powers"
 isaki sthapana patric zigler dwaara hui thi
 SKHM represents the method in which Patrick today refers to his work with energy
 san 1979 main, patric zigler kaa shiyops ke pyramidon main SKHM kii twarit urja main pravesh hua or iske baad usne shaikh mohammad osman brahani ke saath shiksha grahan kii
 In 1984, Ziegler was assigned to Christian Garber, who was Marat, a 2500-year-old spirit, as well as Master Sechim, who handed over the information, allowing Zielger Sechim to debut in Reiki
 san jilgar ne san 1984 main tom siman ko sechim reki sikhaai, jiskaa aaj khaskar is pranali ke vistaar main mukhya yogadan he
 In 1985, Phoenix Summerfield created seven additional symbols and began training Sechim
 san 1985 se lekar san 1987 ke bich samarfild australia main sechim kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar chukaa tha, oushr yah pranali vishwa main failati chali gai
 In 1995, Schumaker became Reiki's master and gained his first stage as Shechim
 san 1996 main shumekar ek shechim master ban gaya or usne sechim reki kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar diya
 After being given a surprise start in 1997, Schumaker began to provide another side of Sekhem and created sekhem-sechim Reiki
 shumekar or marsha burack aise hi prashikshanon ke sadsy hai or ant main
 Reiki teachings claim that an unbroken, public "life force" is the existence of spiritual energy, which can be used to effect healing
 is par vishchaas karne vaale kehete hai ki reki master dwaara karai jane vaali samaayojan prakriya ke madhyam se is urja tak koi bhi pahunch saktaa he
 The claims made for such energy have no theoretical or biophysical basis
 reki ke anugaamiyon ne iskaa varnan ek aisi pavitra chikitsa ke rup main kiya he jisamen shaareerik, maansik, bhaavnaatmak or aadhyatmik staron par upachaar hota he
 It is believed that whenever a physician's hands are placed on or near a potential recipient, which can be worn, the energy will be transmitted through his or her hands
 kuch shikshaaon main chikitsak kii manshaa yaa is prakriya main uski upasthiti kii mahatta par jor diya gaya he, jabaki baaki anya yah daawa karti hai ki reki praptakarta ke ghaav se urja nikaal lee jaati he taaki prakritik upachaar kii prakriyaayein sakriy athwa gatiman ho saken
 Along with all this it is also believed that energy is "intelligent", so it is not necessary to identify disease
 yah kaha jaataa he ki prashikshan ke duusare str main, ek anya shuruuaat ke saath chikitsak ko is prakaar se taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki vah dur se reki upachaaron kaa nishpaadan kar sake
 It has been said that this method involves the use of special symbols to create a temporary connection between the physician and the recipient, despite the location differences, and to send Reiki energy
 aisi takneekein bhi sikhaai jaati hai jinase reki ko samay ke ek nishchit bindu par, yaa bhoot main athwa bhavishya main bheja ja sake
 In a full body Reiki treatment, the practitioner often asks the recipient to lie down on a massage table and rest
 upachaar ke dauraan amuman deele, aaramdaayak kapade pahane jate hai
 The doctor may take a few moments to get his brain to a calm and meditative position and prepare himself mentally for treatment, and this is often done without any unnecessary conversation
 upachaar chikitsak dwaara apane haathon ko praptakarta par vibhinn mudraon main rakhane se aage badhata he
 However, physicians may use a touchless technique in which the hands are placed a few centimeters away from the recipient's body for some or all of the locations
 agle sthaan par haathon ko le jane se pehle use 3 se lekar 5 minute tak sthir rakhaa jaataa he
 In totality, the hand positions are usually the head, front part of the torso and back, often to the knees and feet
 lagbhag 12 se lekar 20 sthanon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jiske saath puraa upachaar 45 se lekar 90 minute tak chalata he
 Some physicians use a fixed set of hand positions
 anya yah jaanane ke liye ki kahaan upachaar kii aavashyaktaa he apane antargyaan kaa upyog karte hai, kabhi-kabhi aise kshetron kaa pataa karne ke liye praptakarta kaa scan karke upachaar kii shuruyaat kii jaati he
 Due to the method of using your intuition, the treatment of different locations may take very little or too long
 yah suchit kiya gaya he ki praptakarta sparsharahit vidhi ke upyog ke baavjood aksar us sthaan par tapish yaa gudagudi mahasoos karata he, jahaan upachaar kiya ja rahaa hota he
 These effects are most often felt immediately after treatment, feeling like recovering with a state of complete rest, although this can also lead to emotional release
 jaisaa ki reki upachaar ko uttejnavardhak prakritik upachaar prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he, at: isamen vishisht swasthya samasyaon kaa turant ilaaj hota hua aamtaur par dekhne main nahin aata he
 If a chronic disease is being treated, a series of three or more treatments are recommended for which there are breaks of 1 to 7 days between these treatments
 acha swasthya banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se nirantar rup se chalane vaale niyamit upachaaron kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The interval between such treatments is especially between 1 and 4 weeks, this interval is not only in the circumstances when the treatment itself is taking place and when daily activity is normal
 vishesh kshetra ke reki upachaaron main chikitsak dwaara apane haathon ko sharir ke vishisht kshetra yaa uske nazadik rakhana shaamil he
 Fresh wounds are often treated in a similar way, and the hands are placed in place of the wound
 aise upachaaron kii avadhiyaan bilkul alag-alag hoti hai, haalanki 20 minute kii avadhi aam ho sakati he
 Some physicians use treatments in these specialized fields for certain diseases and some publications have tabulated appropriate locations on hand
 haalanki, anya chikitsak sabhi puraane rogon ke liye sampurna sharir kaa upachaar karne ko praathamikta dete hai, iskaa aadhaar ye he ki iskaa prabhaav adhik pavitra he
 Another way is to treat specific areas after treating the whole body
 japan se baahar reki ke prashikshan ko saamanyat: teen staron, yaa digriyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first degree of the Reiki course teaches basic principles and procedures
 chaar "attunements" shikshak ne chaatr ko di hai iske antargat shishyon ko praptakarta ke sharir par haathon ko rakhane ke un sthanon ke bare main sikhaaya jaataa he jinhen sampurna sharir upachaar kii prakriya kaa sarvottam sahaayak samajha jaataa he
 After completing the first degree, its partner can treat himself and others through Reiki
 paramparaagat rup se is paathyakram kii avadhi chaar satron kii hoti he, jinhen aksar lagaataar 2,3 yaa 4 dinon tak prastut kiya jaataa he
 In the second degree course of Reiki, pupils are taught to use the three symbols that are believed to increase strength and increase the distance by which the effect can be emphasized
 shishy ko ek or samaayojan diya jaataa he, jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki isse shishy ke zarie reki ke sanchaar kii kshamta main or vruddhi ho jaati he or saath hi pratikon kaa upyog karne main bhi vah sakasham ho jaataa he
 After crossing the second level, the pupil can still do his work without being physically present near the recipient
 teesri degree yaa "master prashikshan" ke madhyam se chaatr ek reki master ban jaataa he
 One or more adjustments are made and the pupil learns about a next master-level symbol called the mayo
 master prashikshan purna karne ke baad nayaa reki master anya logon ko reki se samyojit kar saktaa he or reki kii teen digriyon ko sikhaa saktaa he
 The duration of the master training can be anything from a day to a year or more, depending on the school of Reiki and the philosophy of the Reiki master who is training
 prashikshan vidhiyon, gatiyon or laagton main bahut bhinnata hai
 Neither Reiki has any official organization nor does any rule of action exist
 reki paathyakram ko internet par bhi liya ja saktaa he, haalanki paramparawaadi maanate hai ki prabhaav paane ke liye samaayojan vyaktigat rup se kiya janaa chahie, kyonki reki samaayojan karne vaale master / shikshak ke liye samaayojanyogy vyakti ke urja kshetra ko sparsh karne main samarth hona aavashyak hota he
 Some conservatives believe that not every method that teaches Reiki "quickly" can leave that much impact, because there is no alternative to the experience and the patient master of this art
 reki ke vaigyanik adhyayan is tathy se jatil ho jaat he ki ek placebo-niyantrit adhyayan karne ke liye, placebo ko aisa bananaa aavashyak he jisase vah har tarah se upachaar kii tarah dikhe
 The largest research conducted in 2008 has failed to show Reiki as an effective treatment in all circumstances
 is vyavasthit samiksha ne is pramaan aadhaar kaa moolyankan kiya or nau adhyayan aise paae jo unke chayan mandandon par khare utre
 Keeping in view the difficulty of the blinded physicians, a modified Jad score of lawful quality was used
 jo adhyayan yadrichhik nahin the, unhen adhyayan se baahar rakhaa gaya tha, kyonki is tarah ke adhyayanon main jaanboojhkar yaa anjaane main purvaagrah hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, jisase parinaamon kaa vishleshan karnaa naammumkin ho jaataa he
 Overall, the perceived quality of the evidence base was desired, as high-level studies also completely failed to control the placebo effects, and most studies included "inadequate design and small-scale reporting for small-sample studies
" Errors "were found
 aisi trutiyon se bhare pareekshanon main atishayyukt upachaar prabhaav dikhne kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, at: yah sanket dene ke liye pramaan aparyaapt hai ki reki prayek doctorl sthiti ke liye ek swayannirbhar yaa sahaayak upachaar ke rup main prabhavakaari he athwa isamen sambhavit placebo prabhaavon se pare bhi koi laabh maujuud hai
 Concerns about safety in Reiki are similar to those of other unproven alternative medicines
 chikitsa ke doctoron or sambhddha swasthyakarmiyon kaa maananaa he ki rogi gambhir paristhitiyon main apramanit vaikalpik aushadhiyon ke paksh main aadhikarik pramanit upachaaron se dur rah sakate hai
 Reiki practitioners can encourage their clients to visit a medical doctor in critical situations, saying that Reiki can be used as a traditional complementary therapy
 naidanik pareekshanon main reki ke upyog se kisi bhi prakaar ke mahatvapurn pratikul prabhaav kii soochna nahin mili he
 The National Council Against Health Fraud, which operates against counterfeiting in the name of health, has suggested that each of Reiki's clinical effects may have been due to the suggestion, and to name Reiki a "feel-good" treatment, Recipients themselves do not expect any significant treatment effect
 chunki reki ko sikhaane ke kai vibhinn tareeke hai, at: vibhinn samoohon, shikshakon or chikitsakon ke bich vivaadon ke ubhare hue bindu maujuud hai
 Disputes exist on topics such as the nature of Reiki energy, fees charged for courses and treatments, training methods, symbol secrecy and adjustment methods
 havaayo takaata kii mrityu ke baad se lekar 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak iske liye paraspar virdohi daawey kiye jate rahe ki reki ke "grandmaster" kaa pad kisne banaaya
 However, when it was found that Takata had composed the word himself, the dispute ended to a large extent

 The conclusion of the order stated "since Reiki healing is neither compatible with Christian teachings nor has any scientific evidence available, Catholic institutions such as Catholic health service facilities and sole centers, or individuals representing the church such as Catholics It is not appropriate for priests to promote or support the Reiki treatment

 unhone haath se gaadi kaa dwaar pakadana tha jo chhot gaya tathaa dwaar unke sar se ja takaraayaa
 isse unhen thodaa ksht hua
 Di Bunt laughingly said, "I love Helen dearly, but she sometimes gets a little chaotic at work

 Due to the lack of black thick clouds, Di Baunt had to shoot a lot of light in the light
 For this, he asked the Industrial Light Magic to increase the digital light replacement images from 150 to more than 300
 The time for principal photography was short as Helen had to go for a season shoot of Paul Reger's serial 'mad About You'
 parantu riger apni shooting peeche hataane ke liye maan gayi jab unako pataa chalaa ki trewister kii shooting ko or vakt lagegaa
 di baunt ne kai camere prayog kiye jisase 3 lakh feet kachi film role kii jagah lagbhag 13 lakh feet prayog kerani padi
 Di Baunt says that the Twister film cost about $ 70 million, of which around $ 2–30 million for the director
 It is believed that the budget went up to $ 10 million from Joe's childhood days to re-shoot scenes and overtime

 There were also orchestral tracks that were later removed from the CD of the film, such as the 'intro to Human Beagles' track playing at the time when Joe's team leaves the hailstorm to watch the hailstorm
 Other parts that were cut off were the longer format of Going Green, which rings on the arrival of Jonas and a shorter track when the first tornado appears
 Oddly, there were many musical parts that were not in the film but in the audio CD
