 kaha jaataa he ki rishi vishwamitra kii ajna se isi sthaan par ram ne ahilya kaa uddhaar kiya tha
 According to Dr
 Ram Prakash Sharma "there is no doubt that Ahilya-nagari or Gautam Ashram was in Mithila
 bhojpur main ram ne tadka -badh kiya tha
 There, Sanuja Rama protected the yajna of sage Vishwamitra by suppressing the evil demons with his power
 mithila rajya main pravesh kar pehle ram ne ahilya kaa uddhaar kiya, or tatpashchaat vahaan se praha uttar disha main chalakar ve rishi vishwamitra ke saath videh nagari janakapur pahunche
 According to the story described in the Ramayana, Rama and Lakshmana went out to see the forest groves of Mithilapuri, along with sage Vishwamitra, then they saw a deserted place in a park
 ram bole, "bhagwan! yah sthaan dekhne main to ashram jaisaa dikhaai detaa he kintu kya kaaran he ki yahan koi rishi yaa muni dikhaai nahin dete?" vishwamitra ji ne bataaya, yah sthaan kabhi maharishi gautam kaa ashram tha
 He used to do austerities by staying here with his wife
 ek din jab gautam rishi ashram ke baahar gayi huye the to unki anupasthiti main indra ne gautam rishi ke vesh main aakar ahilya se pranay yachana kii
 Even though Ahilya recognized Indra, he gave his approval, considering that i am so beautiful that Devraj Indra himself is pleading with me
 jab indra apane lok laut rahe the tabhi apane ashram ko waapas aate huye gautam rishi kii drushti indra par padi jo unheen kaa vesh dhaaran kiye huye tha
 He understood everything and cursed Indra
 iske baad unhone apni patni ko shaap diya ki re duraachaarini! tu hajaaron varshon tak keval hawa pikar ksht uthaati hui yahan raakh main padi rahe
 When Rama enters this forest, only then will you be saved by his grace
 tabhi tu apana purv sharir dhaaran karke mere paas aa sakegi
 Saying this, Gautam Rishi left this ashram and went to the Himalayas and started doing penance
 isaliye vishwamitra ji ne kaha "he ram! ab tum ashram ke andar jaakar ahilya kaa uddhaar karo
 "both brothers entered the ashram after listening to Vishwamitra
 vahaan tapasya main nirat ahilya kahin dikhaai nahin de rahi thi, keval uskaa tej sampoorn vaataavaran main vyaapt ho rahaa tha
 When Ahalya's vision fell upon Rama, she received her holy vision and once again started to appear as a beautiful woman

 In finance, a portfolio is an appropriate combination or collection of investments made by an institution or individual
 portpholio rakhana, nivesh va jokhim ko simit karne kii ranneeti kaa ek bhaag he, jise vivadhikaran bhi kehete hai
 By owning multiple assets, certain types of risks can be mitigated
 portpholio kii sampatti main nimna ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, bank khaataa; stock, band, vikalp, adhikaar patr, swarna pramanikaran, achal sampatti, bhavi anubandh, utpaadan ikaiyaan yaa anya koi vastu jisase apane mulya ko barkaraar rakhane kii apeksha kii ja sakati he
 a financial institution would ideally conduct its own investment analysis to create an investment portfolio, whereas a private individual may have the facility of a financial advisor or financial institution facilitating portfolio management

 portpholio ke nirmaan ke liye kai ranneetiyaan viksit kii gayi hai
 Some of the financial models used in the process of pricing, stock selection and portfolio management include: portpholio munaafe kii gananaa ke liye kai alag alag vidhiyaan hai
 a traditional method uses quarterly or monthly value-weighted profits
 ek nishchit avadhi jaise, masik yaa tremasik, ke liye nikaale gaye mulya bhaarit munaafe main yah maan liya jaataa he ki is avadhi ke dauraan munaafe kii dar sthir rahegi
 chunki portpholio munaafe main pratidin utaar-chadhaav hote hai, atah mulya bhaarit munafa, ek portpholio se hone vaale vaastavik munaafe ke sambandh main sirf ek lagbhag anumaan hi de saktaa he
 These errors are caused by capital inflows during the measurement period
 truti kaa aakaar teen charon par nirbhar karegaa: puunji pravaah kaa aakaar, maapan avadhi ke dauraan puunji pravaah kaa samay or portpholio kii asthirataa
 Another purely method of measuring portfolio profits is the use of the correct time-weighted method
 iske kaaran puunji pravaah ghatit hone vaali prayek tarikh ko portpholio kaa punarmoolyankan or iske baad rojaanaa ke munaafon kaa sanyuktaikaran aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Performance attribution describes the active performance of a portfolio
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vishesh portpholio ko es and pi 500 suchakank ke tadnusaar mandandit kiya ja saktaa he
 If the minimum standardized profit during some period was 5 percent and the portfolio's profit was 8 percent, this would require an explanation of the active profit of 3 percent
 yah 3 pratishat kaa sakriy munafa, portpholio ke munaafe ke us ghatak ko prastut karata he joki nivesh prabandhak dwaara arjeet kiya gaya tha
 There are different models for performance attribution to suit different investment processes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek saadhaaran pratidarsh "bottm ap" shabdaawalee main sakriy stock ko, maatr stock chunaav ke parinaam ke rup main vyakt karata he
 On the other hand, sectional planting explains the active profits of both the segment betting and the stock selection within each segment
 kul milakar pradarshan ropan ke liye bhinn udahaaran khand pratidarshon ke prayog par aadhaarit hai, jaise phama-french trikhandia pratidarsh

 After India's independence in 1947, freedom fighters active in Portuguese provinces and Indians residing in other places brought up the idea of liberation of Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli
 bharat ke swatantra hone se pehle se hi mahatma gandhi kii bhi yahi vichaardhaara thi or unhone ye pushti bhi kii - "goa ko maujuud mukt rajya ke kanoonon ke virodh main ek alag ikai ke rup main rahane kii anumati nahin di ja sakati he
 When India attained republicanism on 26 January 1950, the French government decided to vacate its territorial possessions on the east coast of India but the Portuguese government still kept its roots in India
 falswaroop goa, daadaraa, nagar haveli tathaa anya kshetron main swatantraaa aandolan or gaharaa ho gaya

 lekin portugali sarkaar ne naa hi sirf goa kii mukti ke bare main baat karne se manaa kar diya balki unhone pehle se hi lagu damankaaree upayon ko parikshetron main tej kar diya
 In 1953 another attempt was made to reach agreement with the Portuguese government - this time they were also assured that the cultural identity of the enclaves would be preserved even after their transfer and the laws and customs would also be kept unchanged
 phir bhi ve pehle kii tarah apane hath par kaayam bane rahe or yahaan tak ki bharat dwaara kii gai pahal kaa jawaab dene se bhi inkaar kar gaye
 Consequently the Indian Embassy in Lisbon was closed in June 1953

 Artism is known as the antonym of utilitarianism in the field of literature and art
 is siddhant kaa pratipaadan victor kuje ne 1818 main kiya
 According to it, the purpose of art is not to achieve any moral or religious purpose, but to seek its own perfection
 kala soundaryanubhuti kaa vaahak he isaliye ise upyogita kii kasuti par nahin parkhaa janaa chaiye
 Adherence to the rules of society, policy, religion, philosophy etc
 are a hindrance to the free and spontaneous expression of art
 kalavaadiyon ke anusaar kalakaar lokottar praani, kala lokatit vastu tathaa kalajanya anand alokik aswadyukt evam samajanirpeksh hota he
 Conversely, utilitarian art is considered not only as a powerful means of changing the attitudes of the society towards the desired direction, but also considers it as the best medium of principle propagation
 upyogetavaadiyon ne kalavaadiyon par sankeern evam vyaktinishth hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he, ve viviya ghode par arudh hai
 The Artists accused Utilitarians of being a subservient to gross socialism and said, they had promised to give us heaven, but have given Rugnalaya
 vichaarkon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo kalawaad ke vyaktipaksh or upyogetavaad ke samajapaksh ke samanvay ko hitkar maanata he
 The ostensible power of the artistic approach is constantly found in Europe in some form or the other from Plato and Aristotle to the present day
 plato ne apane granth 'republic' main kaviyon or kalakaaron ko rashtrabahishkrut kar dene kii vyavastha di he; kaaran, unki drushti main kalpanasheel kalakaaron evam kaviyon kaa aseem prabhaav naitik evam saamaajik drushti se avaanchhneeya tha
 Even though Aristotle has not openly refuted the moral and social beliefs of his mentor Plato, as well as the moral elements and didacticism in art have not disproved them, Aristotle, according to the famous philosopher Butcher, was the first to initiate ethics
 Isolated and told that refined bliss is the ultimate goal of poetry or art
 rome ke prasiddh vichaarak sisaron ne shaleenta tathaa udaattata ko kala kaa pramukh pratipaadya nirdhaarit kiya he
 Longinus in his work 'periapsus' not only considered art as distinct and superior to education and entertainment, but also distinguished it on the higher plane of communication and advised its independent evaluation
 longinus ke anusaar kavy tathaa kala kaa mukhya tatv udaatt he or bhaavana kaa udaattikaran hi unka pradhan parinaam hota he jiskaa vyakti se bhi or samaaj se bhi sidhaa sambandh rahata he
 Therefore, Longinus is certainly centrist in his statement and rendering
 dionisis tathaa demetrius prabhruti anya anek roman vichaarkon ne kavy tathaa kala ke shailipaksh par hi vishesh jor diya he
 Pallavan of classical or classical art of Europe was mostly under the protection of Christianity or 'church'
 at: saatvin se 15veen shatee isvi ke bich rome ko centre maanakar jis baijantiya kala kaa vikaas misr se rus tak hua, vah carch ashrith hone ke kaaran naitik-dharmik-mulya-samanvit thi, at: uskaa soddeshy tathaa upadeshaatmak hona jaruri tha or isiilie usamen kalapaksh gaun hi rahaa
 Even then it is not that there was no relaxation of imagination and feelings in the art of the said period
 iske vipareet dharmik drushtisampann kalakaar bina kisi bahari niyantran athwa baadhyataa ke ucch koti kii kala kaa srijan karte the
 Tolstoy was strongly opposed to the artistic ideology
 unke mat se dharm ke prati vishwaas kaa abhaav hi kalavaadi vichaaron ko janm detaa he or kala kaa saadhy na anand he, na hi saundarya
 He was adamant about morality and like Gandhiji his outlook was reformist
 sudhaarwad prakarantar se upyogetavaad hi he
 Therefore, for Tolstoy, art was definitely a secondary instrument

 Dante's influence lasted only a few days
 pashchaat shastreey drushti dhire-dhire romani drushtikon se aachhadit hone lagi
 As a result, there was a huge change in the artistic values at this time
 17veen shatabdi ko kala kii drushti se kaaphi mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he
 Neoliberalism emerged in France during this period
 lekin yah bhi madhyakaalin chintan ke naveen sanskaran se adhik nahin tha
 Medieval moral values began to disintegrate in Europe after Renaissance, which not only created an atmosphere of instability between traditionalist and independent ideas, but also led to a mutual conflict
 iskaa kaaran is samay kisi sudrudh darshan kaa abhaav tha
 In 1866 AD, in the enforcement of almost diverse literary and artistic promises, in France, the French country, 'l'art Por l'art', came out with a formula whose English translation is 'art for Art's Sec' and in Hindi with the phrase 'art for Art' Is known
 yaheen se kalavaadi vichaardhaara kaa pratyaksh aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 American painter James Abbott mcneil Hwisler, who lived in France and England for a lifetime, became a strong supporter of artism
 hua yah ki 1877 i
 main grosvener chitrakala pradarshnee main angreji ke prakhyat samalochak ruskin ne hvisler ke chitron kii tikhi aalochana kii or kaha, hvisler apane chitron ke madhyam se darshakon ke chehron par rangabhari pyaaliyaan undel detaa he
 Ruskni's statement triggered a court trial in which Hwisler eventually received a fathering as compensation
 iske baad bhi kala ke uddeshy ko lekar ruskin or hvisler ke bich vadavivaad chalata rahaa
 Ruskin considered art to be completely independent and self-contained apart from morality
 isi se prerit hokar hvisler ne apni puri shakti se 'kala kala ke liye' mat kaa pravartan kiya jo atvaad kii seemaa tak ja pahunchaa
 Bradley, Clive Bell, Roger Fai, and George Innes, etc
, were strong advocates of the critical critical ideology
 breadle ne to apane granth 'poetry for poetries sek' main spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki naitikta kavita kaa maatr bahya paksh he
 Therefore, it is absolutely irrational to consider it essential for the superiority of the poem
 clive bel ne aadhunik chitrakala ke sandarbh main rupatatv ko pramukh mana or 1914 i
 main 'siganifikent farm' kaa siddhant prastut kiya jiskaa punaradha roger faai ne 1920 i main kiya
 Artism gained a clear philosophical foundation from the expression of Croche
 kaant kii sthapana 'saundarya kaa koi bahya astitv nahin he' ko aadhaar banaakar kroche ne apane 'laa spirito' naamak granth main saundaryabodh ke liye 'ant: pragna' kii satta kaa pratipaadan kiya or bataaya ki saundaryasrishti tathaa saundaryanubhuti donon hi sookshm maansik vyapaar hai
 At the same time there is elemental unity between varna and manifestation
 at: kalapaksh or vastupaksh ko vicchhinn karke dekhnaa bhraamak he
 According to Croche, art is basically a spiritual activity, so in its view, art has no other purpose or purpose except expression
 itnaa hi nahin, kroche ne kala ko naitik kinwa shaikshanik simaaon se mukt bhi mana he
 In a way, utilizing Croche's theory in a way denies utilitarian recognition, but the said principle applies only to the intangible trade of art, not to the tangible
 kroche kaa kala siddhant tatvat: samajavirohi nahin he kyonki moort hone par vah bhi kala ko samajanirpeksh nahin maanata
 The artistic vision was also strengthened by the 'dreamism' of Freud

 Thus Richards re-established utilitarianism in the field of art
 marxvad ke udai ke saath kalavaadi manyataon kaa teji se vighatan hua
 Marx adopted a utilitarian approach to art in his economics and said that art is for the public, mainly for soldiers and workers
 stallin ne rus main or maao ne china main kala tathaa sahitya ko raajnneeti ke prachaar kaa pramukh saadhan mana evam usapar rajshakti kaa ankush laga diya
 In his circular titled 'problems of Art and Literature', Mao expressed his faith in the above mentioned installations of Marx
 marxvaadi samalochak codwell ne bhi kalavaadi vichaardhaara ko vishuddh burjua drushti se utpann kutsit vritti kaa parinaam bataaya he
 In the Marxist camp, Trotsky is the only person who considers the interference of political party in the field of art unfair
 'litarechar and revolution' naamak apane granth main usne spasht kaha he, kala ke kshetra main party ko aadesh dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It is fine that the duties of the party are also to protect and assist the art, but leadership can be done only indirectly in that area

 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896

 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved

 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political

 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 aaruni se udayan ke rajya ko waapas lene ke liye unke mantri yaugandharayan or rumnavan prayatnsheel ho gayi
 But Aruni could not be defeated without the help of another state
 vaasavadatta ke pita pradyot udayan se naaraaz the or yaugandharayan ko unase kisi prakaar kii ummid nahin thi
 Yoongandharayana finds out through astrologers that the king whom magadha-naresh's sister Padmavati will marry will become Chakravarti emperor
 yaugandharayan ne sochaa ki yadi kisi prakaar se padmavati kaa vivaah udayan se ho jaye to udayan ko avashya hi unka vatsa rajya aaruni se waapas mil jaayegaa saath hi ve chakravarti samraat bhi ban jaayenge
 Yoongandharayan told Vasavadatta about his plan to get Maharaj Udayan married with Padmavati
 pati kii mangalakamna chaahane vaali vaasavadatta is vivaah ke liye raji ho gayi
 But Yoongandharayana knew well that Udayan loved his wife Vasavadatta infinitely and would never agree to his second marriage
 atev unhone vaasavadatta or ek anya mantri rumnavan ke saath milakar ek yojana banaai
 According to the plan, Udayan was sent along with the royal family and confidant colleagues to the forest for hunting, where they all started living in the camp
 ek din, jab udayan mrugaya ke liye gaye hue the, shivi main aag laga di gai
 On Udayan's return, Rumwan told him that Vasavadatta was trapped in the fire in the camp and that Yoondandharayana entered the place where both of them died
 udayan is samachar se atyant duhkhi hue kintu rumnvan tathaa anya amaatyon ne anekon prakaar se santvanaa dekar unhen sambhaala
 Here, Yogandharayan, taking Vasavadatta as a Parivrajak, reached Magadha Rajputri Padmavati and placed the disguised Vasavadatta as a heritage near Padmavati
 avantika padmavati kii vishesh anugrah paatr ban gayi
 He praised Maharaj Udyan and attracted Padmavati towards him
 udayan doosraa vivaah nahin karnaa chaahate the kintu rumnavan ne unhen samajha-buja kar padmavati se vivaah ke liye raji kar liya
 Thus Udayan was married to Padmavati
 vivaah ke pashchaat magadh-naresh kii sahaayta se udayan ne aaruni par akraman kar diya or use parrast kar apana rajya waapas le liya
 In the end, in a very dramatic way Yugandharayana and Vasavadatta revealed themselves
 yaugandharayan ne apni dhristataa evam dussahas ke liye kshamaa nivedan kiya
 In one scene of this play, Udayan rests in the sea
 ve swapn main ‘ha vaasavadatta’, ‘ha vaasavadatta’ pukaarte rahete hai usee samay avantika vahaan pahunch jaati hai
 They leave their hanging hands on the bed, but at the same time Udayan sleep opens
 ve nishchay nahin kar pate ki unhone vastav main vaasavadatta ko dekha he athwa swapn main
 Due to this incident, the play was named 'swapnavasavadatta'

 america ke swatantraaa yuddh ne europea upniveshwaad ke itihaas main ek nayaa mode laa diya
 He devised a method for the future independence of the states of Africa, Asia and Latin America
 is prakaar america ke yuddh kaa parinaam keval itnaa hi nahin hua ki 13 upnivesh matrudesh britain se alag ho gaye balki ve upnivesh ek tarah se nae raajnneetik vichaaron tathaa sansthaaon kii prayogshaala ban gaye
 First conquered by challenging the 16th-17th century European colonialism and commercialism
 america upniveshon kaa england ke aadhipaty se mukti ke liye sangharsh, itihaas ke anya sangharshon se bhinn tha
 This struggle was neither the result of dissatisfaction caused by poverty nor the people were suffering from feudal system
 america upniveshon ne apni svachhndatha or vyavhaar main swatantraaa banaae rakhane ke liye england sarkaar kii kathor aupniveshik niti ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 America's freedom struggle is an important event in world history
 england evam spain ke madhya 1588 i
 main bheeshan nausainik yuddh hua jisamen spain kii paraajay hui or isi ke saath british nausainik shreshthata kii sthapana hui or england ne america main apni aupniveshik bastiyaan basaai
 By 1775 AD, 13 British colonies had been settled in America
 in america upniveshon ko bhugolic drushti se teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- These colonies were 90% English and 10% Dutch, German, French, Portuguese etc
 is tarah america upnivesh pashchimi duniya tathaa nai duniya donon kaa hissaa tha
 In fact, part of the Western world came because the people who came here came from different regions of Europe such as Britain, Germany, France, Ireland etc
 and were also part of the New World because the religious, social environment and surroundings were different from there
 ek prakaar se yahaan mishrit samskruti kaa janm hua kyonki bhinn-bhinn kshetron se aae logon ke apane reeti-rivaaj, dharmik vishwaas, shashan-sanghathan, rahan-sahan aadi ke bhinn-bhinn saadhan the
 Despite these differences, there was unity among them and this unity was born due to common problems and as a result of efforts to solve it
 itnaa hi nahin balki pashchim se logon kaa teji se aagaman bhi hua or is ki vajah se loktantric samaaj ke nirmaan kii bhaavana kaa bhi prasar hua
 America's freedom struggle was primarily a conflict of economic interests between Great Britain and its colonies, but in many ways it was also a rebellion against the social and political system whose usefulness in America was never ending
 duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki america kranti ek hi saath aarthik, raajnneetik, saamaajik evam dharmik anek shaktiyon kaa parinaam thi
 The immigrants who immigrated to the United States were far more independent lovers than the citizens of England
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yahaan kaa samaaj europe kii tulana main kahin adhik samtawadi tha
 The special feature of American society was feudalism and the absence of unbreakable class boundaries
 america samaaj main ucchvarg ke paas raajnneetik evam aarthik shakti british samaaj kii tulana main atyant kam thi
 In fact, most of the peasants in the US had land whereas in Britain there were more number of marginal tenants and landless agricultural laborers
 nae mahadweep par pair rakhane ke saath hi apravasi british kanoon evam samvidhan ke anusaar kaary karne lage the
 They had their own political institutions
 is prakaar america upniveshon main aarambh se hi swashaasan kii vyavastha vidyaman thi jo samay ke saath viksit hoti gai
 The British government used to appoint governors to govern colonial rule and to provide aid there was an executive committee whose members were nominated by the British crown
 iske atirikt shashan kaary main sahaayta dene ke liye ek vidhayak sadan / essembali hoti thi jisamen janata ke dwaara nirvaachit pratinidhi hote the
 This legislative house was empowered to impose taxes, fix the salaries of officers, enact laws
 kintu kanoonon ko sweekaar karnaa athwa radd karne kaa purna adhikaar governor ko tha
 This system created discontent among the people of the colonies
 england ne aarambh main hi upniveshon kii svachhndatha va swashaasan par ankush lagane kaa praytn nahin kiya kyonki england main 17veen sadi ke aarambh se lekar “raktahin kranti” tak ke lagbhag 85 varshon ke bich rajtantr evam sansad ke bich nirantar sangharsh chal rahaa tha
 Then when the government tried to collect them strictly by levying various taxes, discontent arose in the colonies and this dissatisfaction turned into a revolution
 uttari america main quebec se lekar mississippi ghati tak francisi upnivesh faile hue the
 Britain and France had interests in the region
 faltah 1756-63 ke bich donon ke madhya saptavarshiya yuddh hua or isamen england vijayi rahaa tathaa canada sthit francisi upniveshon par angrejon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 As a result of this war, the French threat from the north ended in America
 atah upniveshvayi kii england par nirbharta samaapt ho gai
 Now he got an opportunity to revolt against Britain
 doosraa prabhaav yah rahaa ki england ne uttari america main mississippi nadi se lekar algaani parvatamala tak ve vyapak kshetra ko apane niyantran main le liya
 As a result, the residents of the American colony now wanted to expand their boundaries towards the western and the natives living in this area wanted to drive away the Red Indians
 faltah vahaan sangharsh hua
 So the Government of England secured the territories of Florida, Mississippi, etc
 for the Red Indians by a royal proclamation in 1763
 isse upniveshavaasiyon kaa pashchimi kii ore prasar ruuk gaya or ve england kii sarkaar ko apana shatru samajhane lage
 In addition, during the Seven Year War, England had to spend a large amount of money, causing England to face economic problems
 angrej raajnneetigyon kaa maananaa tha ki england ne upniveshon kii raksha hetu dhan kharch kiya he isliye upniveshon ko england ko or adhik kar dene chahie
 This is the reason that the already applicable shipping laws, commercial laws, sugar act etc
 were strictly enforced
 parantu upniveshvasi us sthiti ke bhugtan ke liye taiyaar na the
 Thus the Seven Year War played a major role in the herald of the American freedom struggle
 england dwaara upniveshon kaa aarthik shoshan, upniveshon or matrudesh ke bich asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran tha
 According to the prevailing commercialist theory, England wanted to control the trade of the colonies and monopolize their markets
 “upnivesh england ko laabh pahuchane ke liye hai” is siddhanth par upniveshon kii vyavastha aadhaarit thi
 England enacted laws keeping in mind its benefits- nausanchaalan kanoon : 1651 i
 ke praavdhaan ke anusaar upniveshon main vyapaar keval england, ireland yaa upniveshon ke jahaajon ke madhyam se hi ho saktaa tha
 It was then arranged that all the raw materials needed for England should not be exported from the colonies to other places without bringing them to the ports of England
 isse england ke pot nirnaat udyog ko to laabh hua hi england ke vyapaariyon ko bhi mila 1663 ke kanoon ke tahat kaha gaya ki europe se america upniveshon main niryaat kiya jane vaala maal pehle england ke bandargahon par laayaa jayega
 This law benefited the merchants of England and the owners of merchant beds at the expense of the American consumer
 ye kanoon upniveshavaasiyon ke liye anyaaypurna the
 Business Act: England enacted a law that goods produced in America such as rice, iron, wood, tobacco etc
 could only be exported to England
 in niyamon se upniveshon main kaaphi rosh failaa
 Because the French and Dutch merchants were willing to pay them more than the English for these goods
 audyogic adhinium : england ne kanoon banaaya ki jis audyogic maal ko england main taiyaar kiya jaataa tha vahi maal uske america upnivesh taiyaar nahin kar sake
 Thus the export of woolen goods from the colonies by the law of 1689 and the hats by the law of 1732 AD was stopped
 uparokt kanoon yadhyapi upniveshon ke liye hanikaarak the phir bhi upniveshon ne inkaa virodh nahin kiya kyonki inako sakhti se lagu nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Further, when these were strictly enforced during the reign of George III, the colonies opposed them
 america main jivan ke sthayitv ke saath hi shiksha or patrakarita kaa vikaas hua jisane bauddhik chetana ke vikaas main apana yogadan diya
 Many American intellectual thinkers such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Wilson, John Adams, Tomas Penn, James Otis, Samuel Adams etc
 justified the colonies' resistance to the homeland
 inke vichaar jon lock, montescue jaise chintakon se prabhavit the
 But these views were expressed so strongly that it bolstered the American people's demand for self-government
 britain ne america upnivesh main kai prakaar ke kar-kanoon lagu kar sthaneey karon ko badhaane kaa praytn kiya
 This also led to a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the colony
 yahaan ek sanvaidhanik mudda bhi uth khadaa hua
 The British believed that the British Parliament was the supreme power and could pass any kind of law in the case of its American colony
 jabaki america upniveshon kaa maananaa tha ki un par kar lagane kaa adhikaar keval upniveshon kii essembliyon main nihit he na ki british parliament main kyonki usamen pratinidhitiv nahin he
 Lord North's tea policy, in 1773 AD, the British Prime Minister Lord North enacted a law that the company could sell tea directly to the United States in order to rescue the East India Company from financial crisis
 ab pehle kii bhaanti company ke jahaajon ko england ke bandargahon par aane or chungi dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 The goal of this move was to save the company from losses and make tea available to the American people
 parantu america upnivesh ke log company ke is ekadhikaar se aprasann the kyonki upnivesh bastiyon kii sahmati ke bina hi aisa niyam banaaya gaya tha
 Therefore, this tea policy was strongly opposed in the colony and it was said that England wanted to retain its right to levy external tax through "cheap tea"
 atah puure desh main chaay yojana ke viruddh andolan shuru ho gaya
 On 16 December 73, under the leadership of Samuel Adams, the East India Company's ship at Boston port was dumped into the sea of loaded tea boxes
 america itihaas main is ghatana ko boston tii party kaha jaataa he
 The incident posed a stiff challenge before the British Parliament
 atah british sarkaar ne america upniveshavaasiyon ko sajaa dene ke liye kathor evam damankaaree kanoon banaae
 The port of Boston was closed
 mesachusets kii sarkaar ko punargathit kiya gaya or governor kii shakti ko badha diya gaya tathaa sainikon ko nagar main rahane kaa niyam banaaya gaya or hatya sambandhi mukademen america nyaayalayon se england tathaa anya upniveshon main sthanantarit kar die gaye
 Britain was considered an invincible nation
 america upniveshon ke haathon uski haar ascharyajanak thi
 It is true that Americans had no existence before English
 phir bhi america kii vijay hui
 The role of "nature, France and George Washington" was important, with many reasons behind it
 aadhunik maanav kii pragati main america kii kranti ko ek mahatvapurn mode mana ja saktaa he
 As a result of this revolution, in the new world not only a new nation was born but a new era was heralded in terms of mankind
 pro
 green kaa kathan he ki “america ke swatantraaa yuddh kaa mahatv england ke liye chaahe kuch bhi kyon na ho parantu vishwa itihaas main yah ek mahatvapurn ghatana he
 "this revolution also had an impact on other countries including America, England
 1
 george tritiy ke vyaktigat shashan kaa ant : england main george tritiy evam pradhanmantri lord north donon kii ninda hone lagi
 Both of them were held responsible for the chaos of England
 chunki george tritiy sansad ko apni kathputli maanata tha, atah sansad kii shakti main vruddhi kii maang uthi
 The revolution struck a monarchy based on the divine right of the king and passed a resolution restricting the king's authority in the House of Commons and Lord North had to resign as prime minister
 isse george tritiy ke vyaktigat shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 Further new Prime Minister Pitt Jr
 reestablished the power of the cabinet
 is tarah england main vaidhanik vikaas kaa maarg prashast hua
 2
 Establishment of new colonies by England: The independence of 13 American colonies hurt England's colonial empire
 apni khoi pratishtha ko punah praapt karne evam vyapaarik hiton ko surakshit karne hetu nae kshetron main upniveshikaran kaa prayaas kiya or isi sandarbh main austrailia tathaa newjiland main british upnivesh kii sthapana hui
 3
 Changes in the colonial policy of England: With the withdrawal of the American colony, the British government realized that if the remaining colonies were to be kept under their control then they should leave the policy of colonial exploitation and the rights of the people of the colonies and Demands have to be respected
 is parivartit niti ke aadhaar par hi 19veen evam 20veen shatabdi main british sarkaar ne “british kamanvelth of neshns” arthath british raashtra mandal kii sthapana kii
 4
 The abandonment of the commercialist principle by England: After the colonies were taken away, many people believed that this would give a tremendous blow to the trade commerce of England
 parantu kuch varshon baad england or sanyukt rajya america main pehle se bhi adhik vyapaar hone laga to adhikansh deshon kaa “vaanijya siddhanth” se vishwaas uth gaya
 England itself abandoned this policy and adopted a policy of free trade
 vastutah francisi kranti ke mukhya siddhanth swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav kaa mul america sangharsh main dekha ja saktaa he
 The American Revolution had its impact on Ireland and, in part, India
 us samay ireland ke log bhi england ke log bhi england ke viruddh apni swatantraaa ke liye lard rahe the
 The American Revolution gave him freedom
 america naaraa pratinidhitiv nahin to kar nahi ireland main atyadhik lokapriy hua falswaroop 1782 i
 main british sarkaar ne ireland kii sansad ko vidhi nirmaan kaa adhikaar de diya
 The American Revolution adversely affected India
 america swatantraaa sangram ke kaal main france ke yuddh main pravesh hone se bharat main bhi angl-francisi yuddh kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 By taking advantage of this, the British made the path of expansion of their empire accessible by damaging the power of the French
 ek duusare tareeke se bhi america kranti kaa prabhaav bharat par dekha ja saktaa he
 In fact, one of the reasons for the American Revolution was that the British did not interfere effectively in the rule of the American colonies
 faltah america upniveshavaasiyon main swatantry chetana evam swashaasan kii paddati kaa vikaas ho gaya
 Discontent arose when the British intervened there
 atah britain ne is sthiti se sikh lekar bhartiya upnivesh ke aantarik maamalon main aarambhik charan se sakriy hastkshep jari rakhaa or vahaan ke nivaasiyon kii swatantraaa ko simit rakhaa
 The British intervened in the internal affairs of India through subsidiary treaties and merger policy and Indian classes were kept separate by adopting a policy of divide and rule
 is tarah america sthitiyon se sikh lete hue bharat main un sthitiyaan ko utpann kiya gaya jisase log bante rahe or aupniveshak samrajya par british samrajya kii pakad bani rahe
 In this way, we can say that the American Independence War deprived Britain of an empire but strengthened the foundations of each other's empire
 america swatantraaa sangram ko do charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he- pratham charan 1762-72 kaa kaal, krantikari andolan kaa kaal rahaa or is kaal main aupniveshik shoshan ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai gai tathaa british samrajya ke andar hi aantarik sudhaaron par bal diya gaya
 But when this attempt failed, then the second phase begins after 1772, which was the phase of freedom struggle
 is charan main america netaaon ne keval kar lagane ke adhikaar ko hi chunauti nahin di balki yah ghoshit kiya ki british samrajya khud hi ek mukhya samasya he or usase mukti hi ekmaatr rasta he
 Thus the process of American freedom struggle started with the revolution and culminated in the freedom struggle
 ise kranti isliye kaha jaataa he ki sampoorn aadhunik vishwa itihaas ke sandarbh main raajnneetik, saamaajik or vaicharik pahaluon par amul-chul parivartan laayaa gaya
 The American middle class was extremely liberal, progressive and aware
 is varg ne upniveshi shaskaon ke visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 Leaders like Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, James Otis represented the middle class
 vaicharik aadhaar par ladi gai is kranti main madhyavargeey mudde pramukhataa liye hue the
 Such as no representation, no tax, franchise demand, demand for independence, etc
 swatantraaa ke ghoshnaa patr par hastakshar karne waalon main madhyavarg hi pramukh tha
 In the American Revolution there was also a put of class struggle in which on one side was the elite ruling class of England, in support of which there were American rich and oligarchs who were afraid of the arrival of democracy and its reactions
 duusari taraf america ke karigar, shilpi, shramik, madhya varg ke log the jo america swatantraaa sangram ke pakshdhar the
 The revolution took a progressive form, the expression of which can be seen in its system of governance and constitution
 jisamen ganatantrwaad, samvidhanwaad, dharmanirpekshata, loktantric mulyon kii sthapana par bal diya gaya tha
 The revolution hit colonial principles and encouraged the creation of an independent nation
 america kranti main striyon ne bhi bad-chadh kar bhaag liya
 Worked as an undercover, collaborated with weapons manufacturing
 kranti main mahilaon kii bhagidaari dekh cornwalis ne kaha bhi- yadi ham log uttari america ke sabhi purushon ko khatm bhi kar de to bhi auraton ko jeetne ke liye hamen kaaphi ladanaa padegaa

 jab ooshmiya urja kii baat karte hai tab kisi yukti ko di gayi ooshmiya urja yaa us yukti dwaara khapat kii gayi kul urja q i n { \ displaystyle Q_{in}} uskaa input hota he jabaki vaanchit output, us yukti dwaara kiya gaya yantric kaary w o u t { \ displaystyle W_{out}}, yaa q o u t { \ displaystyle Q_{out}}, yaa donon hote hai
 We know that energy is not available in the same way, it has some financial value, so the general definition of thermal efficiency is as follows- ooshmaagatiki ke pratham niyam ke anusaar, output urja kabhi bhi input urja se adhik nahin ho sakati
 Therefore saamaanya rup se kisi upkaran main urja kii khapat kaa anupaat uske dwaara utpaadit bal kii tulana main kitna he isko is tarah se samajha ja saktaa he ki kisi antardahan ingine main eendhan jalataa he to usase na keval jenerator chal kar bijli banati he balki is prakriya main ingine chalaane ke liye indhan ko jalaayaa jaataa he jisase ingine chalen ke saath jo garmi paidaa hoti he vah bhi uske ek utpaada ke rup main utpann hoti he, yah garmi jitani adhik hogi utana hi bijli banane kii kshamta ko kam karegi
 In this way, the production of energy cannot be greater than the fuel burned in any way
 yadi ise anupaat main vyakt kiya jaye to tapiya-kshamta 0%se 100% ke bich rahegi, kintu anek prakaar kii aakshamtao, jaise- gharshan, taap-haani aadi ke kaaran yah kshamta 100% nahin hoti
 Petrol-engines, for example, operate at 25% efficiency, while large coal-fired power stations produce up to 40% capacity, and large diesel engines are capable of generating up to 51
7% maximum
