 Acharya Dwivedi opened a door in Hindi literature through which Narendra Kohli made a reputation for an entire era
 This is the brightest page in the history of Hindi literature and it is Shri Acharya Dwivedi who is the chief Vaitalik of this new prabhat who influenced young Narendra Kohli

 By removing the darkness of ages, he removed the story of Lord Rama from the sentimental sentiments of the devotees and put him on the ground of modern reality
 Not only the literary and reading class was overwhelmed
 kis prakaar ek upekshit or nirvasit rajkumaar apane aatmbal se shoshit, peedit evam trast janata main nae praan phunk detaa he, 'abhyuday' main yah dekhnaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin tha
 When the Ramakatha, which has become age-old, has changed in a new genre according to the interest and culture of the modern reader, it does not remain mindless to see that the author has maintained the dignity of Ramakatha and the life-values of Ramayana in it
 Have done aashcharya nahin ki tatkaaleen sabhi diggaj sahityakaron se yuva narendra kohli ko bharpoor aashirwad bhi mila or badai bhi
 murdhanya aalochak or sahityakar acharya hajariprasad dvivedi, amritlal nagar, yashpal, jainendrakumar ityadi praayah sabhi sheershasth rachanakaaron ne narendra kohli kii khule shabdon main khule dil se bharpoor taareef kari
 jainendra jaise us samay ke prasiddhtam rachanakaaron ne bhi yuva kohli ko padhaa or jin shabdon main apni pratikraya vyakt kii usne hindi sahitya main kisi vishisht pratibha ke aagaman kii spasht ghoshnaa kar di
 i do not know what to expect from a novel and what its craft is
 prathit hota he ki aapaki rachana upanyaas ke dharm se oonche uthakar kuch shaastra kii kaksha tak bad jaati he
 i am grateful to you for this and congratulate you heartily
 -jainendra Kumar maine aapmen vah pratibha dekhi he jo aapako hindi ke agrani sahityakaron main laa detii he
 You have presented some part of the original story of Ram Katha with great skill

 Bhagavaticharan Verma, aapane ram katha, jise anek itihaaskaar maatr puranic aakhyaan yaa myth hi maanate hai, ko yathashakti yathartwaadee tarksangat vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya he

 Yashpal ramakatha ko aapane ekadam nayi drushti se dekha he
 In 'opportunity', you have portrayed Ram's character from a new human point of view
 isamen sita kaa jo charitra aapane chitrit kiya he, vah bahut hi aakarshak he
 Sita was never portrayed as such a sharp-headed
 saath hi sumitra kaa charitra aapane bahut tejasvi nari ke rup main ukera he
 i am happy that without changing the original events of the Ramayana story as much as possible, you have given a fascinating interpretation of it

 The major events of Balakanda and the prudent re-narration of the characters of Rama and Vishwamitra, rational interpretation of Yugapurusha / Yugavatar form of Rama are special achievements of the novel
 dow nagendra Curiously, he turned a few pages of 'diksha' and then the book intrigued him that he spent the entire evening both days after reading it

 If you have kept this 'tempo' from the beginning to the end, it will be a huge task
 In this, the background stories of Sita and Ahalya's images have become very powerful

 the flow is good
 kai bimb achche ubhare, saath saath nibal bhi hai, par hota yah chalata he ki ek acchhee jhaanki jhalak jaati he or upanyaas phir se jor pakad jaataa he
 In this way, Ravani will be considered as the first
 Congratulations on this success

 The praise is that you have not allowed the traditional dignity of Ramkatha to be distorted

 Narendra Kohli has his own special place in Hindi literature
 vigat tees-pantis varshon main unhone jo likhaa he vah nayaa hone ke saath-saath mithkeey drushti se ek nai jameen todane jaisaa he
 


 Kohli has also shown his fundamental talent in the fields of satire, drama, review and story
 maanviya samvednaa kaa parkhi narendra kohli vartmaan yug kaa pratibhashali varisht sahityakar he
 "dr
 Vijayendra Graduate", vastutah narendra kohli ne apni ramakatha ko na to sampradayik drushti se dekha he na hi punarutthanavaadee drushti se
 maanavtaavaadi, vistaaravaadi ektantr kii nirankushta kaa virodh karne vaali yah drushti pragatisheel maanavtawaad kii samarthak he
 The dream of protecting humanity and establishing a just and equitable exploited society is neither communal nor revivalist in any sense
 - Dr
 Kavita Surabhi narendra kohli kaa avdaan maatraatmak pariman main bhi paryaapt adhik he
 His epic novel series comprising nineteen novels 'mahasamar', 'break, Kara Break', 'abhyudaya' are more than their predecessors both in terms of quality and quantity
 unke anya upanyaas bhi vibhinn virgon main shreshth kritiyon main gine ja sakate hai
 Social novels include 'suffering with Sorrow', 'pardoning GG', 'preity-katha'; 'atmaadan', based on the life of Rajyavardhan and Harshvardhan in historical novels; 'abhigyan', based on the life of krishna-sudama in philosophical novels; In mythological-modernist novels, 'vasudev' places him in a higher position than all the predecessors and contemporary writers of Hindi
 iske atirikt vrihad vyang sahitya, naatak or kahaniyon ke saath saath narendra kohli ne gambhir evam utkrisht niabandh, yatra vivaran evam maarmik aalochanaayen bhi likhi hai
 In short, his contribution can be seen in every genre of prose, and he is often superior to all other writers in his particular genre
 unke krititv kaa aadha bhi kisi anya sahityakar ko yug-pravartak sahityakar ghoshit karne ke liye paryaapt he
 Narendra Kohli has made those stories his medium which are world famous for their expansion and diversity: Ram Katha and Mahabharata Katha
 'yannabhaarte - tannabhaarte' ko charitaarth karte hue unke mahopanyas 'mahasamar' maatr main varnit paatro, ghatnaon, manobhaavon aadi kii sankhya evam vaividhya dekhen to vah bhi paryaapt tehregaa
 varnan kala, charitra-chithran, manojgat kaa varnan ityadi dekhen bhi kohli premchand se na sirf aage nikal jate he, varan samvedansheeltaa evam gaharaai bhi unamem adhik he
 The feature of Narendra Kohli that makes him distinct from these two predecessors is the best practice of nineteen classic works continuously for thirty-five years after each
 iske atirikt vrihad vyang-sahitya, saamaajik upanyaas, aitihaasik upanyaas, manovaigyanik upanyaas bhi hai; safal naatak hai, vaicharik niabandh, aalochanatmak niabandh, samikshatmak evam vishleshnatmak prabandh, abhibhaashan, lekh, sansmaran, rekhachitron kaa aisa khazaana he
 

 He has given Hindi literature so much in every genre of prose that all his contributions seem to be insignificant
 upanyaas, kahani, vyang, naatak, niabandh, aalochana, sansmaran ityadi gadhy kii sabhi pramukh evam gaun vidhaon main narendra kohli ne apni vidagdhta kaa parichay diya he
 The reason for the wonderful hold on the novel mode is that Narendra Kohli's extensive expertise in many subjects, he understands human psychology deeply and by capturing the basic elements of different characters, he can effectively and reliably respond to his innate response in different situations
 Can present
 ausat evam asaadhaaran, sabhi prakaar ke paatro ko ve apni sahaj samvednaa evam bhedak vishleshak shakti se na sirf pakad lete he, varan unke saath tadatmya sthapit kar lete hai
 a comprehensive depiction of political equations, counter-attacks, balance of power, etc
 is found in his compositions
 bhashaa, style, shilp evam kathanak ke str par narendra kohli ne anek nae evam safal prayog kiye hai
 He has invented a new genre of epic novels by elevating novels to the level of ancient epics
 narendra kohli kii siddhahastata kaa uttam udhaaharan he unke mahoupanyaas 'mahasamar' ke vistrut failaav se 'saath saha gaya dukh' tak kaa atisankshipt drishypatal
 saikadon paatro evam hajaaron ghatnaon se samrudh 'mahasamar' ke aath khandon ke chaar hazaar prishthon ke vistaar main kahin bhi na bikharaav he, na charitra kii visangatiyaan, na drushti or darshan kaa bhed
 pandraa varshon ke lambe samay main likhe gaye is mahakavyatmak upanyaas main lekhak kii vishleshnatmak drushti kitni spasht he, yah unke granth "jahaan he dharm, vahiin he jai" ko dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he jo mahabharat kii arthprakruti par aadhaarit he
 In this book, he has considered the characters and events mentioned in 'mahasamar', has put the problems in front and tried to find a solution to them
 mahabharat ko samajhane main prayasshil is mahoupanyaaskaar kaa yah udhyam dekhte hi banataa he jisamen unki vichaar-prakriya ke rekhankan main hi ek puraa granth taiyaar ho jaataa he
 For the students and critics of literature, this book is not only important in understanding the literature-making-process of Narendra Kohli but it is absolutely necessary
 is granth main narendra kohli ne vibhinn charitron ke bare main nayi evam spasht sthapanaayen di hai
 Without being impressed and terrorized by the image engraved in his psyche, a logical analysis of events, Kohliji has analyzed the original character of Krishna, Yudhishthira, Kunti, Draupadi, Bhishma, Drona etc
 sufficiently different from the orthodox images
 duusare dhruv par unka doosraa upanyaas "saath saha gaya dukh" he jo maatr do paatro ko lekar buna gaya he
 Despite being an early novel written by him, it is a very strong and mature work of Hindi literature
 'saath saha gaya dukh' narendra kohli kii us saahitiyik shakti ko udghaatit karata he
 Telling 'sidhi Baat' directly and so clearly that it gets into the mind of the reader, make him laugh and cry
 Narendra Kohli is unique in this art
 'saath saha gaya dukh' narendra kohli ke samvedansheel paksh ko udghaatit karata he
 The utterance by Mahadevi for 'prasad' fits him perfectly: "


 it is proved that the strings of his life-style were so tight that even the lightest chimes would resonate in him
 " "I was surprised to see how a simple flat domestic or family novel of just two and a half characters has become so moving and engaging
 anlankrita jivan-bhashaa main saadagi kaa saundarya gholkar kis kala se ise itani saghan samvedniyata se purna banaaya gaya he
 " kohliji kaa pratham upanyaas tha 'punararambh'
 is vyaktiparak-saamaajik upanyaas main teen pidiyon ke varnan ke lakshya ko lekar chale upanyaaskaar ne unke madhyam se swatantraaa-prapti ke sankramanakalin samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke logon kii maansikta evam jivan-sangharsh kii unki paristhitiyon ko chitrit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Then came 'terror'
 It is a depiction of the depressed state of the rotting current society, its inability to fight atrocities, impotence of the ideology of the intellectuals and failure of the culmination of the karma of the higher ideology which fills the mind with depression
 narendra kohli kii ek badi uplabdhi he "vartmaan samasyaon ko kaal-pravaah ke manjhdhaar se nikaal kar maanav-samaaj kii shaashvat samasyaon ke rup main unpar sarthak chintan"
 upanyaas main darshan, aadhyatm evam niti kaa pathneey evam manograhi samavesh unhen samakaleen evam purvavarti sabhi sahityakaron se ucchtar dharaatal par khada kar detaa he
 Thus he started writing from the age of six, but his works started being published from the 1960s onwards
 samakaleen lekhakon se wo bhinn is prakaar hai ki unhone jaani maani kahaniyon ko bilkul moulik tareeke se likhaa
 Below is a list of his major mass novels based on historical stories

 In the works of Ramkatha series titled 'deeksha', 'opportunity', 'struggle Towards' and 'yudh', the story of the millennial tradition of godliness and devotion in the masses was broken by the narrator, the religion and the divine cultural land connected with it is

 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 jab koi vyakti nai gaadi kharid kar chalata he tab uski yahi dekhne kii ichha rahati he vah gaadi adhik se adhik kitni raftaar pakadati he
 But doing so is not free from danger
 aarambhik pratham 1000 kimi kii yatra main use 30 kimi prati ghanta se adhik chalaanaa hi nahin chahie
 Although, after manufacturing in factories, the engine of each motor vehicle is properly tested by sitting and running on the right, but it is short-lived
 at: gaadi main lagane ke baad bhi aarambh main kuch samay tak use dhire chalaane se uske sab bering or purje ravaan ho jate hai
 Failure to do so may, at times, cause the engine's cylinders, bearings, and power dispatching equipment to become too hot to cause water and shock to deteriorate, making it impossible to repair
 is samay unamem khub tel bhi diya janaa chahie
 The only disadvantage of giving too much oil to the cylinders is that it burns off the surplus oil and freezes the carbon in the cylinders, which needs to be cleaned only after the first 1,000 km journey
 phir baad main 4,000 kimi kii yatra ke baad saaf karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The above precautions should be taken for the safety of the vehicle
 safal motor driver banane ke liye uske niyantrak upkarnon kaa upyog or bazaar kii bheed bhaad main se, bina takaraae gaadi chalaanaa hi kaaphi nahin hota
 The first qualification can be obtained in one and a half hours only
 ek daksh driver k yahi pahchaan he ki vah sab prakaar ke margo par ausat ucchtam raftaar se, apni or janata kii suraksha kaa purnataya dhyaan rakhte hue gaadi ko chalaate hue use is prakaar se sanbhaale ki usamen ghisaai, tut foot or petrol aadi kaa kharchaa nunatam ho
 This quality is attained only through continuous practice
 driver ko apni gaadi kii chaudaai kaa sahi gyaan hona aavashyak he jisase vah gaadi ko bina kisi cheez se takaraae nunatam sthaan main se nikaal kar le ja sake
 He should have the ability to correctly estimate the speed of his car and other vehicles
 gaadi ko chaalu karte samay niyantrak upkarnon kaa sanchaalan is prakaar karnaa chahie ki unki kriya purnataya vyavasthit ho
 The driver's eyes should extend approximately 100 m on the road ahead and his hand should, if necessary, fall to the correct controller device without diverting sight
 nae driver kii nigahen aage ke raste par lagbhag 100 me kii duuri tak faili rahani chahie or aavashyaktaa padane par uskaa haath, bina maarg se drushti hataae, sahi niyantrak upkaran par padana chahie
 Accidents often happen with new drivers because they take their sight off to catch the equipment
 yah yogyata kai sau kimi kii yatra kar chukne ke baad hi praapt hoti he
 The drivers must also have an accurate knowledge of the condition of the foot-operated equipment
 praaia: gaadi ko ek dam rokane kii ichha se pairchaalit brake dabaane ke prayaas main nausikhiyon kaa pair bhul se phisal kar twaritra falak par padataa he, jisase baari durghatana ho jaati he
 Many drivers tend to use the brake brakes more often in place of congestion, but they should also use side-mounted brakes
 kai baar aath das foot kii duuri main hi gaadi rokani padati he
 In such a situation, if the driver remains fumbling on the hand brake, then the accident is sure to happen
 driver ke liye rajmargeey niyamon kaa jaananaa bhi aavashyak he
 It should be remembered that the left side of the road is guaranteed for vehicles coming from the right side and the right side of the road
 apni hi disha main aage chalanevaale vaahanon kaa abhilanghan karne ke liye unhen apni bain taraf chhodkar unki dahni taraf se nikal janaa chahie
 The driver should stop the motor at the behest of a horse, or the driver of a bullock cart, or a policeman; it is possible that the horse, or the bull, is not under the control of the driver; Or unable to walk
 chauraahon par khadey sipaahiyon ke sanketon kaa tatkshan paalan karnaa chahie
 Also, the drivers should tell the policemen in a gesture that they themselves want to go to the place
 apane aas paas chalanevaale anya driveron ko bhi bataa den ki ve rukna chaahate hai athwa kidar ko mudana chaahate hai
 For the control of traffic at the intersections of modern highways, not even the soldiers are deployed, automatic electrical signals are also installed, so they should be understood and work accordingly
 bhinn kaarkaanon kii bani gadiyon kii rachana main bhinnata rahane ke kaaran unako chaalu karne kii vidhi main bhi kuch bhinnata hoti he
 Many trains, especially in the autumn, cause difficulty while starting, so their control devices should be properly adjusted beforehand
 udhaahrant:, gaadi main svapravartak yantra laga ho athwa na laga ho, prayek gaadi ke uparodhi or jwalak liver ko pehle se hi sahi samanjit kar rakhana chahie
 If the vehicle has a variable flame device, which can cause the spark of electricity to be dropped in advance or delayed, then it should be suspended for some time while starting the vehicle
 yadi chinagaari pehle se chhod di jaaygi, to sampidit gas samay se pehle hi jal uthegi jisase ingine kii gajen-pin aadi par bahut jor padegaa
 On starting, the gear box lever should be kept in neutral position and the arm brake of the arm is tied
 phir petrol ko kholkar jwalak switch laga deni chaahe, jisase ki uskaa bhi paripath puraa ho jaae
 If necessary, the carburettor should be patted lightly, so that petrol is filled in its cell
 ab yadi svapravartak yantra laga ho, to use chaalu kar dena chahie, anyathaa keval haath se ghumaane kaa hi prabandh ho, to pehle uske handls ko puure do chakkar ghumana chahie, jisase ek silinder main te petrol kii gas sampidit hokar bhar jaae, jo jwalan ke liye taiyaari hogi or duusare silinder main chushan kriya hogi
 Then when the handle is down, then it should be turned upwards with a jerk, thus the engine will start running after ignition
 khaali ingine ke kuch minute tak chalane ke bad, jab uske prayek bhaag main garmi aa jaae tabhi usapar gaadi ke preshan yantra kaa bojha daalana chahie
 If there is also a water conductor shutter with radiator, then it should also be closed for a couple of minutes in winter, so that the jacket water gets a bit of heat
 uparyukt kriyaaon dwaara jab ingine bhalee bhanti chalane lage tab klach ke falak ko do chaar second tak dabaakar gaad ke preshan yantra ko nimna gear main lagaana chahie
 At this time the side brake should remain on and put one foot on the accelerator panel and attach the clutch slowly 
 phir ingine ke twara pakadte hi brake ko chudaa dena chahie
 Thus the vehicle will start moving at a slow speed
 kai aadhunik gadiyon main uske chaalu hone ke turant baad hi doosraa gear laga diya jaataa he
 To switch from the lower gear to another gear, the clutch panel should be pressed only slightly, but not completely
 is samay twaritra falak ko aaazaad chhod dena chahie, gear liver ko ek kshan ke liye tatasth sthiti main rakhkar use unchi sthiti main sarkaar dena chahie
 After this the clutch should be attached slowly
 phir twaritra falak ko dabaa dena chahie, jisase ingine pehle jitne hi chakkar lagane lage
 All the above procedures should be repeated while allowing the vehicle to run at a higher speed for a higher gear
 isamen antar keval yahi hoga ki gear liver ko tatasth sthiti main kuch adhik kshanon tak rakhana hota he
 The duration of the above neutrality varies for each vehicle while changing the gear to a higher or lower position
 ek baar jab gaadi unche gear par lag di jaae tab uski raftaar main kamibeshi uparodhi dwaara kii jaati he
 The gear of the vehicle should always be changed by pressing the entire clutch
 If you change the gear without pressing the entire clutch, there is a possibility of gear box deteriorating quickly
 jaisaa pehle bataaya gaya he ki yadi driver, apni nigaah maarg par gaadi se lagbhag 100 meter aage tak failaae rakhe, to saamne se aanewaalon se bachane, bhopu bajaane, mode par ghoomane, yaa chadhaai par chadhane ke liye gear badalane athwa chaal ko dhimi karne aadi ke liye kaaphi samay mil jaataa he or gaadi ko donon brake lagaakar jatke se rokane kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 If the vehicle is desired to stay somewhere, first stop the resistor and remove the foot from the accelerator pane, but the clutch should be kept in place
 is prakaar gaadi kii sahaj gati ke kaaran jab ingine shaktirahit hokar khaali chalegaa to vah ek prakaar ke brake kaa kaam karegaa, jisase gaadi swat: hi dhimi padati jaaegi
 Then in the end, the clutch should also be freed and the arm or leg brake should be applied as soon as possible
 gaadi ke thaharte hi gear liver ko tatasth kar dena chahie or haath brake band dena chaahe
 If the car has to be mounted on a shield, the front or rear wheel on the left side should be stuck with a curb stone, thus the car will not roll and the brake will not have to be stressed too much
 gaadi ko tehraane ke sambandh main do baaten yaad rakhni chahie: Drivers often make the mistake of trying to change gear after a long time when the train starts to slow down while climbing
 vaise to aadhunik gadiyon kii kriyaatmakataa main kaaphi lacheelaapan hota he or choti tathaa halaki chadhaaiyaan to ve vaise hi ucch gear par anayas paar kar sakati he, lekin ucch gear par adhik unchi chadhaai chadhane se ingine or shakti preshan yantron par anuchit jor padataa he
 The only way is that as soon as the climb is about to begin, put the dispatching machine on the required low gear, so that the train will accumulate some more power in itself and it will work on the climb
 sadak kii modon par aage kaa rasta nahin dikhaai dene ke karan vahaan khatre kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Therefore, the best way is that the speed of the train should be gradually reduced to 100 or 150 m in advance of any fast turn or normal turn, so that the car can be stopped easily if needed and Do not put too much emphasis on steering while rotating
 yahan par gaadi ko sadak ke madhya se jaraa sa baayein kar liya jaae, kyonki madhya ke nikat se, raste ke kone se aage kaa bhaag kuch adhik duuri tak dekha ja saktaa he
 In this way, when the steering wheel turns slowly, the car automatically turns to the right on the left
 bheed bhaad main gaadi chalaate samay bahut hi saavdhaanee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is not always possible to get a proper idea of what the people around us want to do
 at: aise sthalon main dhimi raftaar se chalanaa or hameshaa chaukanna rahanaa tathaa bhompu aadi spasht bajaanaa chahie
 Do not try to get ahead by moving between two vehicles moving forward
 dhime chalanevaale vaahanon kaa abhilanghan keval usee samay karnaa chahie jab saamne se koi doosraa vaahan na aa rahaa ho

 hernia sivan, hernia ko thik karne kii shalya prakriya he
 The hernia is the bulge in the internal organs or tissues, which protrudes through an abnormal opening in the muscular wall
 hernia pet, qamar or purv main kii gai surgery kii site par utpann ho saktaa he
 There is an operation in which the hernia sac is removed without any correction of the inguinal canal, which is described as a "herniotomy"
 jab herniotomi ko gas se jhaal lagaana swayan utpaadak yaa vividh saamagree vaale pasch vankshan nalika kii diwaar ke prabalit sudhaar ke saath sanyukt kiya jaataa he, tab ise hernia sivan ke vipareet hernioplasty kaha jaataa he, jisamen prabalikaran ke liye kisi swany utpaadak yaa vividh saamagree kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 In the US, hernia suture or hernioplasty is often performed by an ongoing, or "daily," surgical procedure

 About 700,000 people are treated per year in the United States

 a practical technique for correction of hernia was first described by Bassini in 1880; Bassini's technique was "tension" correction, in which the edges of the defect were sewn back together without further reinforcement or reinforcement

 Although stress improvements due to high hernia recurrence rates, the L6B period of recovery, and post-surgical pain are no longer considered standard of care, only a few stress improvements are used; These include the Sholdais and Cooper Ligament / mcvay reforms

 Almost all of the improvements made today are "stress free", including the installation of synthetic grating to strengthen the inguinal area; Some popular techniques include Liechtenstein correction, plugs and patches, and the proline hernia system
 is shalya kriya ko "hernioplasty' kaha jaataa he
 The grating used is made exclusively of polypropylene or polyester, although some companies have launched teflon grating or partially absorbent grating market

 In recent years, laparoscopic correction of inguinal hernia has emerged as an option, as in other fields of surgery
 "god" sudhaar bhi tanaav se mukt hai, haalanki iske virodh main yaa isapar dosha ke peeche purv- peritoneal sthaan main mesh ko rakhaa gaya he
 Advantages of lap over free method include faster repetition time and post-surgical pain score

 Lap is generally more expensive, as it requires more surgical room time rather than free correction, but requires shorter periods of hospitalization
 jatiltaaon ke tulanaatmak jokhim, yaa saarvajanik tanaav mukt sudhaaron kii tulana main punrariti kii tulanaatmak dar ko lekar nishchit rup se koi aam raay nahin he
 However, most non-accidental abdominal surgery methods are moving towards laparoscopic, as smaller incisions lead to less blood flow, less infection, faster recovery of disease, reduced hospitalization time and reduced pain
 leproscopy sudhaar kii ek vishesh vidhi totli extraperitoneal he
 The tep correction has fewer complications and takes less time in post-surgical analgesia than the Lichtenstein correction for recurrent inguinal hernia

 They concluded that recurrence rates are similar, but new studies have questioned this
 unhone paaya ki adhik tej rog nivritti ke parinamswaroop leproscopy sudhaar or pehle kuch dinon kam dard hota he
 They found that lap correction had a lower risk of infection from the wound after surgery, less blood flow and less swelling
 ve bhi kam puraane dard he, jo kai varshon tak sthaayee rahete hai or 30 main se ek rogi hi isse gambhir rup se peedit ho saktaa he
 a recent US study found that recurrence within two years of surgery after lap correction is 10%, compared to 4% in free surgery
 haalanki, in donon parinaamon ko antarrashtriya maanakon dwaara kam aanka gaya he or sujhaayaa gaya he ki sarjan anubhavheen the, visheshkar god sudhaar ke sambandh main
 Recurrence or early recovery is much less frequent than stress correction in grating improvement
 jhanjhari sudhaar jatiltaaon main sankraman, jhanjhari pravaas aasanjan gathan, antah-udaraavaran ango main ksharan or jeern dard shaamil hai - jo ki sambhawatah tantrikaon, naadiyon, yaa shuukravaahikaaon kii jaalsaaji ke kaaran hota he
 Complications of this type, usually presented in the form of an abscess, fistula, or small bowel obstruction, tend to heal over weeks to years with initial correction

 Sankhya is also one of the six types of Indian philosophy which was very popular and famous in ancient times
 yah advait veydant se sarvatha vipareet manyataayen rakhane vaala darshan he
 The original person who founded it is called Kapil
 'sankhya' kaa shabdic arth he - 'sankhya sambandhi' yaa vishleshan
 Its most prominent belief is that the creation is made up of the nature man, here nature is the root and the male conscious
 yoga shastron ke urja strot, shakton ke shiv-shakti ke siddhant iske samaanaantar dikhte hai
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti festival
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 One of the reasons for its popularity has been that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by repudiating the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale sat, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat kii vishmata kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada buddhigamya prathit hota he
 By not considering any temporal problem as the law of God, the reason for deteriorating the synergy of these forms and not making effort of the creatures
 yani, sankhya darshan kii sabase badi mahanata yah he ki isamen sristi kii utpatti bhagwaan ke dwaara nahin maani gayi he balki ise ek vikasaatmak prakriya ke rup main samajha gaya he or mana gaya he ki sristi anek anek avasthaaon se hokar guzarane ke baad apane vartmaan swaroop ko praapt hui he
 Kapilacharya is considered by many to be an atheist but this notion has been denied in texts like Bhagavad Gita and Satyarthraprakash
 sankhya-darshan kaa mukhya aadhaar satkaryawad he
 According to this theory, work cannot originate without reason
 faltah, is jagat kii utpatti shunya se nahin kisi mul satta se he
 This theory is contrary to Buddhist nihilism
 kaary, apni utpatti ke purna kaaran main vidyaman rahata he
 Work is the essence of its cause
 kaary tathaa kaaran vastutah samaan prakriya ke vyakt-avyakt rup hai
 Matrimonialism has two distinctions - consequentialism and discourse
 parinamwad se taatpary he ki kaaran vaastavik rup main kaary main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Like in sesame oil, milk is converted into curd
 vivartvaad ke anusaar parivartan vaastavik na hokar abhas maatr hota he

 sankhya darshan prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti Parva
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, Sankhya philosophy became very popular at some time
 isaki lokapriyata ke or chaahe jo bhi kaaran hon par ek to yah avashya rahaa prathit hota he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the illusions of the world on the basis of the elements of different religions, Rajas and Tamas elements, seems to be very just and wise
 "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti "sankhya" shabd ke aage anu pratyay jodne se hoti he or sankhya shabd kii vyutpatti saarchaksh dhaatu khyan darshain pratyay taap he, jiske anusaar iskaa arth samyak khyaati, sadhu darshan athwa satya gyaan he
 This due fame of the Sankhyacharyas, this true knowledge of them, lies in the separation of the male form of the Chitta element from the person's form and the dual aspect of the person
 upar-upar se prapanch main sanaa hua dikhaai padane par bhi purush vastut: usase achoota rahata he
 In spite of being seen as indulgent or indulged in it, one remains virtually unattached or uninterested - this greatest philosophical discovery of the Sankhyakaris is treated in his own words by the names Satvapurushanyakhyati, Vivek Khyati, Prakritik Vigyan, etc
 isi vivek gyaan se maanav jivan ke param purusharth yaa lakshya kii siddhi maanate hai
 Thus "number" is an abbreviation to reveal the true form of the greatest philosophical discovery of the word numerology, being the first lecturer, his ideology was named as "samkhya" in very ancient times
 gananarthak "sankhya" shabd se bhi "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti maani jaati he
 In the Mahabharata, both these types of expressions have been revealed in a verse about Sankhya
 vah is prakaar he- sankhyan prakurvate chaiv prakrutin c prachakshate
 Tattvānti Ch Chatuvinsdān Ten Samkhya: Prakritita:
 iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki jo sankhya arthath prakruti or purush ke vivek gyaan kaa upadesh karte hai, jo prakruti kaa prabhaav pratipaadan karte hai tathaa jo tatwon kii sankhya choubees nirdhaarit karte hai, ve sankhya kahe jate hai
 Some people are of the opinion that the secondary goal of the word "number" in the form of knowledge is considered to be the attainment of Kaivalya or salvation, the ultimate goal of life from the wisdom of nature and man, hence the attainment of that knowledge is the main and For this reason, the whole force of Samkhya is on him
 sankhya choubees tatv maanata he, yah to ek saamaanya tathy kaa kathan maatr he, at: gaun he
 Udayveer Shastri in his treatise entitled "history of Samkhya Darshan" quotes the interpretation of Sridhar Swami on Bhagavata 3-25-1 in being propounded by Kapila of the Samkhya Shastra - the interpreter explaining the last verse clearly It is written - Element number numerator: Sankhya-promoter Ityarth:
 isse nishchit ho jaataa he ki yahi kapil sankhya kaa prarvatak yaa praneta he
 Scribe of Sridhar Swami: On the word, Shastri ji has written in the footnote given below - Some interpreters of the medieval period have interpreted the word "sankhya" in the term "sankhya" as calculative
 vastut: iskaa arth tatv gyaan he
 But considering it deeply, it is not as common or secondary as it seems to be an emergency
 aisa prathit hota he ki bahut pracheen kaal main darshanik vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main jab tatwon kii sankhya nishchit nahin ho pai thi, tab sankhya ne sarvapratham is drishyman bhautik jagat kii sookshm mimasaa kaa prayaas kiya tha jiske falswaroop uske mul main vartmaan tatwon kii sankhya saamanyat: choubees nirdhaarit kii thi
 In these also the first element which he named "prakriti" or "pradhan" was proved to be the origin of the remaining twenty three
 chit purush ke saannnidhya se isi ek tatv "prakruti" ko kramash: taees avaantar tatwon main parinat hokar samast jad jagat ko utpann karti hui mana tha
 Thus behind the determination of element number, there seems to be a huge intellectual practice of statistics
 aakhir sookshm buddhi ke dwaara deergh kaal tak bina chintan or vishleshan kiye tatwon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran kaise sambhav hua hoga? From the above discussion, it is decided that the "sankhya" name of Sankhya philosophy is indicative of its rational argument with both types
 sankhyon kaa achit prakruti tathaa chit purush, donon hi moolbhoot tatwon ko aagam yaa shruti pramaan se siddh maanate hue bhi mukhyat: anumaan pramaan ke aadhaar par siddh karnaa bhi isi baat kaa parichaayak he
 It is clear from the view of both the Samkhya discourse formulas and the numeric texts available these days that it is proved by the inference based on both the fundamental elements of Samkhya - nature and power of man
 purush kii anekta main bhi yuktiyaan hi di gai hai
 Satirism has also been established on the basis of arguments
 
 Thus the Sravana scripture, which is the foundation of wisdom knowledge, is logic-oriented
 manan, anukaal tarkon dwaara shastrokt tathyon tathaa siddhanton kaa chintan he hi
 Thus, the number or wisdom due to which the Sankhya philosophy got its "sankhya" name has a special relationship with logic and intellectualism
 is buddhivaad ke kaaran avaantar kaal main sankhya darshan ke kuch siddhant vaidic sampradaay se bahut kuch swatantra rup se viksit hue jiske kaaran baadaraayan vyas tathaa shankaracharya aadi aacharyon ne iskaa khandan karte hue avaidic sampradaay, tak kah daalaa
 This sect does not appear to be non-vedic in its origin and in its latter form is also not completely vedic
 prasiddh bhashyakaar vigyanbhikshu ne bhi sankhya ko aagam yaa shruti kaa sat tarkon dwaara kiya jane vaala manan hi mana he
 He has said the same thing in his Sankhya discourse-sutra-annotation of the commentary - "vedic scripture", which removes all the campaign of male-related Vedic word, to free it and free the man from all kinds of cosmic forms
 It is said that the narrator Narayanavatar Bhagwan Kapil was born to preach the Sad tips required for contemplating the meaning of those Vedas
 vigyaan bhikshu ke purv pravachanon se spasht he ki ve sankhya shaastra ko vedanusaari maanate hai
 He is clear that he supports the meaning of the Vedic verses "ekvidiyyah", etc
 through Sad tips and arguments, rendering and deliberating it makes it understandable
 vigyanbhikshu ne vastut: lok main prachlit purv parampara kaa hi anusaran karte hue apana purvokt mat prakat kiya he
 Since the very ancient times, in the Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Smriti and Puranas, not only is there a mention of the Sankhya as a high knowledge, but there is also a detailed description of its principles
 gita main bhi sankhya darshan ke trigunatmak siddhant ko badi sundar reeti se apanaaya gaya he
 "trigunatmika Prakriti is the continual resultant
 uske teenon gun hi sadaa kuch na kuch parinaam utpann karte rahete hai, purush akarta he" -sankhya kaa yah siddhant gita ke nishkaam karmyog kaa aavashyak ang ban gaya he 
 Similarly elsewhere, many theories of Samkhya philosophy are visible in the ancient Sanskrit Vadmay, complementing the principles of other philosophies
 in sab baton se aisa prathit hota he ki yah darshan apane mul main vaidic hi rahaa he, avaidic nahin, kyonki yadi satya isse vipareet hota to vedapraan is desh main sankhya ke itane adhik prachaar-prasar ke liye uparyukt kshetra na miltaa
 Vedanta commentator Shankaracharya, who refuted it as Vedah due to the so-called Vedas against the principles of Atheism, Prakriti dualism, consequentialism, etc
, also had to write in the commentary of Brahmasutra 2
1
3 that "even after having many spiritual memories, the Sankhya Yoga memories only Attempt was made in disposal
 kyonki ye donon lok main param purusharth ke saadhan rup main prasiddh hai, shisht mahapurushon dwaara gruhit hai tathaa "tatkaarann sankhya yogabhishanna gyatva devam muchyate sarvapashai: yaa ityadi shrot lingon se yukt hai
 "it is also clear from the evidence of the commentator himself that even during the time of his predecessor Sutrakara, many elegant men considered Sankhya philosophy as Vedic philosophy and followed it as a means of ultimate effort
 in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par sankhya darshan ko mulat: vaidic hi maananaa samichin he
 Yes, in its later development it must have gone against the Vedas in some fundamental principles like the latter is nirvishvara against the Sankhya Vedic tradition, its nature independently creates the entire world
 parantu is darshan kaa mul pracheenatam chhandogya evam vrihadaaranyak upanishdon main praapt hota he
 Its antiquity is evident from this
 is darshan ke do hi moulik granth aaj uplabdh hai- pehla chah adhyyon vaala "sankhya-pravachan-sutara" or doosraa sattar karikaon vaala "sankhyakarika"
 Apart from these two, there is also a very small sutra script which is famous as "tattva Samas"
 shesh samast sankhya vadmay inhen teenon kii tikaa or upatika maatr he
 Among them, Kapil is considered to be from the Upadesha tradition of Sankhya Sutras
 kai kaarnon se uplabdh sankhya-pravachan-sutron ko vidwaan log kapilkrit nahin maanate
 It is definitely certain that even considering these sources as Kapilopotip, many of its sites will have to be projected on the strength of the inter-target of the sources themselves
 sankhyakarikas, ishwarkrishna dwaara rachit hai, jinka samay bahumat se i
 tritiy shatabdi kaa madhya mana jaataa he
 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 kapil ke shishy asuri kaa koi granth nahin bataaya jaataa, parantu inke prathit shishy acharya panchasikh ke naam se anek sutron ke vyasakrut yogabhashya aadi pracheen granthon main uddhrut hone se spasht prathit hota he ki inke dwaara rachit koi sutaragranth ati pracheen kaal main prasiddh tha
 By the opinion of many scholars, this famous book was Shashistantra
 udaiveer shastri ke mat se vartmaan kaal main uplabdh shadadhyaai sankhya-pravachan-sutara hi shashthi padaarthon kaa nirupan karne ke kaaran "shashthitantr" ke naam se bhi gyaat tha
 By his opinion, probably Panch Shikhacharya of Kapil Muni had written an explanation on it and that too was called Shashtantra in the name of the original text
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se "shashthi tantra" prasiddh sankhyacharya varshganya kaa likhaa hua he
 Today there is no special knowledge about many other ancient figures like Jagishdhya, Deval, Asit etc
 yon sangam yaa hast maithun ke samay jab purush ke shishn main yon uttejnaa hoti he or yon-uttejnaa ke charam bindu par shishn se veery nikalataa he, ise hi veerypat yaa veeryaskhalan kehete hai
 At the time of ejaculation, the man gets Charamanand
 skhalan shuru hone kii umr kya he? saamanytah 10 se 15 varsh kii aayu main baccha pratham baar hast maithun karata he
 The quantity of semen in ejaculation is from 5ml to 20ml
 shighrapatan se nijaat paane ke upaay The Matsya period or 'devoni Kalpa' is the geological period that extends from the beginning of the Silurian era of the Puranic Mahakalpa to the beginning of the Carboni Kalpa
 is kalp kaa naam england ke devon pradesh ke naam par padaa he jahaan sabase pehle is kaal ke shailon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 Fisheries developed in this era in particular and based on this, this era is also called 'matsya Yuga'
 england ke devon pradesh main paae gaye jeevashmon ke aadhaar par wiliam lowerdell ne san 1837 main yah bataaya ki ve nikshep jinamein ye jeevashm paae jate hai or jo pehle silyurian yug ke antargat maane jate the, silyurian yug ke nikshepon se kuch naveen hai
 On this basis, in 1840, Marchiran and Sejvik named the devony system
 dhire-dhire sansar ke anya sthanon main bhi is pranali ke nikshep mili or ab sansar ke str-shail-shaastra main divoni kalp kaa sthaan peliosoik kalp main silyurian ke upar or carbonipheras ke neeche rakhaa gaya he
 Two types of deposits are found in this system
 ek samudri nikshep, jo dakshini pashchimi ireland or england ke cornwall evam devon pradeshon se lekar belgium, madhya germany, dakshin finland evam rus main sthit hai; duusare mahadwipiya nikshep, jo uttar main ireland, wales, manamath, scotland, scadinavia, spitaswarg or uttari finland main milte hai or 'old red sandstone' ke naam se vikhyath hai
 In North America also, under this system, two deposits are located in the north and south
 austrailia mahadweep main divoni kalp teen bhaagon main vibhajit he : pehla bhaag aagney udgaar kaa yug tha, jisamen anek aagney shilaayein baniin
 In the second period coral limestone is found, which is a marine deposit
 teesri avadhi main mishrit nikshep bane, jinamein kuch aagney tathaa kuch samudri bhi the
 The evolution of the Divoni kalpa in India is believed to be after the Silurian Limestone Group
 bhartiya divoni ke antargat spity ghati main sthit 4,000 foot mote safed quartzite aate hai, jo quartzite ke naam se vikhyath hai
 This rock group has a special place in Indian science of rock
 iskaa kaaran unamem kisi prakaar ke jeevashm kaa nahin paaya janaa he
 It is very important that from that time onwards, the development of organism was fully established, yet there is no fossil in this thick fold
 jeevashm ke na hone se in quartziton kaa kalprakaran ke anusaar thik thik vargeekaran nahin ho saktaa
 But the fact that the rock formations under quartzite have an organism called Pentamerous oblongus is so true that these rocks are from the post-silurian era
 isi prakaar inke upar paae janevaale shailon main carbonipheras yug ke jeev milte hai
 Hence, it is proved that these quartzites are divonized
 spity ghati ke atirikt divoni kalp ke nikshep kashmir, kumayun, chitral aadi sthanon main bhi milte hai
 There are no deposits of this system in India other than the Himalayan region
 divoni kalp ko 'parvaton ke nirmaan kaa yug' bhi kehete hai, kyonki is samay sansar bhar main anek parvaton kaa nirmaan hua
 The main ones are the Caledonian Mountains in Western Europe and the Acadian Mountains of North America
 scotland, norway, sweden, belgium aadi sabhi sthanon main callidonian sanchalan ke falswaroop parvaton kaa nirmaan hua
 The sea stretches in Divoni Kalpa were in Central, North America, Central Atlantic, Europe, Himalayan regions, South China, Japan, North and South of the United States, Northwest and South Eastern regions of Australia and South Sea
 prithvi kaa shesh bhaag sookhaa tha
 Divoni kalpa are extremely important for life development
