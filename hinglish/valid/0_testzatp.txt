 a class of sulfonamide drugs on the basis of which many drugs are made
 isamen para-amino-benzene salphonamide kaa mul-rachana-sutara vidyaman he
 Paraamino benzene sulfonamide is also known as sulfonyl amide, and in this compound, many compounds can be obtained by substituting the hydrogen atoms of sulfonamide radicals with different compounds, which are collectively called sulfonamide

85 Devdahna is a village located in Handia block of Allahabad district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
 prithvi upree sataha par mote, madhyam or baarik carbonic tathaa acarbonic mishrit kanon ko mrudaa kehete hai
 The rock is usually found when the soil is removed from the top surface
 kabhi kabhi thodi gaharaai par hi chattan mil jaati he
 'soil Science' is a major branch of physical geography in which scientific study of soil formation, its characteristics and its distribution on the ground is done
 pruthvi kii upree sataha ke kanon ko hi soil kaha jaataa he Soil brought by the banks of rivers and by the flow of water, which is called 'cachar soil', does not get rock by digging
 vahaan neeche ke str main jal kaa strot miltaa he
 All soils originate from rock
 jahaan prakruti ne mitti main adhik her-pher nahin kiya or jalwaayu kaa prabhaav adhik nahin padaa, vahaan yah sambhav he ki ham neeche kii chattaanon se upar kii mitti kaa sambandh krambaddh rup se sthapit kar saken
 Although the top surface soil has a different look to the rock below, both have a chemical relationship and if the soil has not been brought from another site by natural action, ie, by water, or by blowing air
 , Then this relationship can be fully established
 chattan ke upar ek str aisa bhi paaya ja saktaa he jo chattan se hi bana he or abhi prakritik kriyaaon dwaara purnat: mitti ke rup main nahin aayaa he, sirf chattan ke mote-mote tukade ho gaye hai, jo na to mitti kahe ja sakate hai or na chattan
 The texture of soil is found in their upper surface
 isi str kii mitti main hamen neeche kii chattan ke rasinic or bhautik gunon kaa sanchay mil saktaa he
 If the rock is crystalline, it is likely 100 percent confirmed
 neeche kii chattan ke atyant nikatavarti, parshv bhaag main chattan ke samaan rasinic or bhautik gun praapt ho sakate hai
 As the distance increases upward, the outline of the rock will also change
 ant main ham vah mitti pate hai, jo krishi ke liye atyant anukool siddh hui he or jisapar aadi kaal se krishi hoti aa rahi he tathaa manushya fasal paidaa karata rahaa he
 Some of the soil is formed from the rocks of other places due to natural reasons
 aise sthanon main yah sambhaavna nahin he ki upar kii mitti kaa bhautik tathaa rasinic sambandh neeche ke sanchay se sthapit kiya jaay, par yah nishchit he ki mitti kii utpatti chattaanon se hui he
 Organic matter is also found in the soil of the fields, along with the minerals of rocks, by the decay of tree plants
 sookshmdarshi dwaara tathaa rasinic vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki chattaanon kii chhijan kriya prakruti main paae janevaale rasinic dravyon ke prabhaav se dhire-dhire hoti he
 The chemical components of the rocks change and the outline of the soil appears to be quite different
 yadi chattan kaa chhijna hi mitti ke banane main ek pradhan kriya hoti to ham aaj kheton kii mitti ko paudhon ke penpaane ke liye anukool nahin pate
 The soil cannot be compared to a finely rocked PC
 yadhyapi chattaanon ke khanij mitti ke upree bhaag main bahut paae jate hai or unke tukade bhi bade pariman main vartmaan rahete hai, phir bhi mitti main jeev-jantu kriyaayein hoti rahati hai, jo krishi ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hui hai
 Due to the effect of fauna and the substances related to them, such as decayed plant material and rotten fauna, small particles of rocks obtained in the bud state are reacted and the color of the soil changes
 yah rup chattaanon ke sirf kanon kaa nahin rahata, mitti kaa ek naveen pranali kii bhusha se susajjit ho jaati he
 If we examine a piece of soil with a microscope and then by examining the particles of these rocks with the same instrument, we will find the difference between the two
 yah antar un acarbonic padaarthon ke sammishran se hota he jo jeev-jantu or paudhon se praapt hote hai
 The action that helps in the formation of soil due to the conversion of rocks into small particles by natural action is called weathering
 yah kriya mahatvapurn he or iske kaaran hi ham prithvi par mitti ko krishi ke anukool pate hai
 In this activity, water, oxygen in the air, carbon dioxide, bacteria and other acidic chemical substances are very helpful
 yah maani hui baat he ki jis mitti par prakritik kriyaayein hoti he, jal kaa prapaat tathaa vaayu or suryakiran kaa sansarg hota rahata he, vah kuch varsho main aisa rup dhaaran kar leti he jisase uske neeche kii bhinn rup rang or gunwali mittiyon ke bahut se sanstar ho jate hai
 If we dig a pit 10 or 12 feet deep on the top surface of the soil and observe the soil surface, we will regularly find many different colored, composed soil from one level to another
 vaigyanikon ne iske teen hi pradhan str maane hai or ve kin-kin kaarnon se or kin-kin paristhitiyon main paae jate hai, iskaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The water passes through the top layer of soil and carries many chemical substances to the bottom layer and there, along with the soil, changes the color form of soil by many chemical reactions
 is tarah upar se dravya aakar neeche ke sanstar main jamaa ho jate hai
 One of them is the upper bed, from which the matter is dissolved by water and goes downward, or deposited in the lower level by precipitation
 is upree sanstar ko ham sanstar kehete hai
 The second is the stratum, in which matter comes and accumulates by the action described above, it is called strata
 teesraa sanstar uske neeche he, jisamen upar kii mitti banati he, ise sanstar kehete he
 In other words, this bed is also called ancestral bed
 yah naam isaliye sarthak he ki isi sanstar se upar vaali mitti kii utpati hui he
 The rock and large debris made of it are found in this bed
 har ek sanstar main bhinn-bhinn sanstar sammilit rahete hai
 It is a very difficult problem to show the ordered relation of the strata
 is samasya ko pehle rus ke vaigyanikon ne hal kiya tha
 The most difficult problem appears when some portion of the top layer of soil is cut by erosion
 kabhi-kabhi to sampurna sanstar kaa kataav ho jaataa he or sanstar rah jaataa he
 The science in which research is conducted on the internal relationship of these beds is called soil science
 is vigyaan se mitti ke vargeekaran main adhik sahaayta milti he
 It is modern science and its progress is progressing
 ab yah praaia: siddh ho gaya he ki mitti kii upree sataha ke bhautik or rasinic gunon ko jaan lene se hi krishi ko laabh nahin ho saktaa
 In order to know the growing of plants and to advise the farmers, it is necessary to know the physical and chemical properties of the various soil layers and their interrelation
 mitti main vibhinn prakaar ke kan rahete hai
 The average amount of particles which are less in them, are required to make the soil fertile
 inke kaaran mitti kii mridukan rachana kii utpati hoti he
 By this composition, the action of water absorption in the soil is increased and various other types of foods for plants are also absorbed
 mitti ke bhautik gun mitti kii sanrachana, jalwaayu mitti main sthit ooshmaa evam khanij padaartho par nirbhar hai
 Clay particles are of different size types, some are big, some are small and some are very subtle
 bade aakaar ke kan chote-chote pattharon ke tukade hote hai
 As natural activity takes place on them, the larger pieces become smaller and eventually become the size of sand, silt, clay or loam soil
 mitti ke bade aakaar ke kan adhikansh balui mitti main paae jate hai or chote aakaar ke kan matiyaar mitti main milte hai
 By mixing of these two size particles, different types of soils are formed and they also have different physical properties
 mitti main sthit bhautik gunon kaa krishi vigyaan se atyant gaharaa sambandh he
 Some physical properties of soil, such as relative gravity, particle structure, particle size, soil solubility and cohesion, color, weight, particle size, particle size, etc
 are of importance, the relative gravity of soil is of two types, one virtual and the other absolute
 abhaasi aapekshik gurutv mitti ke bhitari bhaag main jal tathaa vaayu ke samavesh se praapt hota he, arthath yah mitti ke bhitari sthit khanij se mishrit jal or vaayu kaa gurutv he
 Therefore the amount of this gravity is less than absolute relative gravity
 kisi gyaat aaytan vaali shushk mitti ke bhaar or usee aaytanwale jal ke bhaar kaa yah anupaat he
 It ranges from 1
40 to 1
68
 chikani mitti or silt ke kan bahut chote or halke hote hai, isaliye ve ek duusare ke saath saghan nahin ho pate
 The weight of such soil is less
 matiyaar, domat tathaa silt mitti kaa bhaar jaanane ke liye use shushk bana diya jaataa he, kyonki bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mitti main nami bhinn prakaar kii hoti he
 Absolute relative gravity is related to those parts of soil which are mineral elements
 is kaaran iskaa maan adhik hota he
 Absolute relative gravity is between 1
4 and 2

 mitti ke kan samooh banaate hai
 Different groups produce different types of soil
 ye kan ek duusare ke saath bhinn-bhinn prakaar se mili hue hai or inkaa parsparik sambandh drudh tathaa vyavasthit hota he

 mitti kii urvartaa kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar he
 Plants require air and water, and air and water remain in the soil depending on the configuration of the particles
 ye kan samooh hai- Can occur
 kanon ke aakaar kaa prabhaav mitti ke anya bhautik gunon par bhi padataa he
 Partial holes of soil with larger size particles are larger
 aisi mitti main jal badi tivrata se neeche bah jaataa he, jisase nami kaa sadaa abhaav rahata he
 Such soil has the property of being heated and cooled quickly and such soil is weak
 chote chote kanwali mittiyon main visheshat: chikani mitti main, vipareet gun hote hai
 Water mixed with soil carbonic padaarthon kii upasthiti se bhi mitti main sughatyata aati hai
 Small particles increase solubility
 atberg ne sughatyata kii chaar avasthaaen batalaai hai, jo jal kii maatra par nirbhar karti hai
 Stretch is produced by the electric force on different particles of soil from each other, which is called cohesion
 sansanjan or sughatyata kaa paraspar sambandh he
 When one is more, the other becomes more
 mittiyon ke rang bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Some soils are white, some red, some brown, some black and some ash-colored
 kahin kahin pili mitt bhi pai jaati he
 Due to the presence of different liquids, these colors are added to the soil
 mitti ke rang par bhi jalwaayu kaa prabhaav padataa he
 Soils where the rainfall is high are colored
 ushn pradeshon main louhayukt mitti pai jaati he, jiskaa rang bhura tathaa pilaa hota he
 This color is obtained by the oxidation of iron
 kaali mitti kaa rang carbonic padaarth tathaa humas ke rahane ke kaaran kaala hota he
 Such soil is found in places with high rainfall
 mitti kaa adhikansh bhaag khanij padaarthon dwaara bana hua he
 Relative gravity gives weight knowledge
 carbonic padaarth tathaa jeevashm adhik hone se mitti halki ho jaati he
 Some space is left between the particles of soil
 in jagahon ko kanantarik chhidr kehete hai
 It depends on the configuration of the particles
 isse kanantarik pratishat chhidron ke aaytan kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he, par chhidron ke aakaar or rup kaa pataa nahin lagata
 In soil soils, the transverse holes are small, whereas in sandy soils they are large
 isse matiyaar mitti jal adhik sokhti he or balui mitti kam sokhti he
 The first type of soil is capillary and the second type is inelastic
 kanantarik chhidr ke kaaran mitti jalaavasoshana kshamta aati he
 The composition of the soil depends on the composition of the particles
 kan vidyutakti se bandhakar samooh banaate hai
 Bonding in groups makes the bond stronger
 samoohon ke baandhane main louh or carbonic padaartho kaa vishesh haath rahata he
 Mixing of small particles gives the formation of a softening configuration
 isse pani kaa tehraav adhik hota he or jutai bhi adhik sugamawa se hoti he
 Particles have been measured and classified
 maap se mitti ke gunon or urvartaa kaa bahut kuch pataa lagata he
 This classification is international: in kanon kii maap stokes naamak vaigyanik ke nirdhaarit sameekaran se praapt hoti he
 Water is very important in soil
 yah jal chaar prakaar kaa hota he: As long as the water is sufficient, the root of the plant keeps on doing its work
 dhire-dhire pani jab kam ho jaataa he tab aisi avasthaa aa jaati he ki paudhe kii jade pani kaa avasorana karne main asamarth ho jaati he or paudhe sookhne lagate hai
 In such a situation, the water in the soil is very less and a large amount of power is required to transmit it from the soil
 aisi avasthaa main jo jal mitti main he, use mlannigunank kehete he
 Its usefulness is high, because it gives the amount of soil colloid content
 iske atirikt isse niskriy jal kii maatra kaa bhi gyaan hota he
 The maximum amount of water that the soil absorbs at any one temperature in the saturated atmosphere is known as the hygroscopic coefficient or hygroscopic potential
 ardratagrahi gunank kaa gyaan nimnlikhit prakaar se praapt kiya jaataa he
 There are granular holes in the soil

 This area was ruled by Gujjars as "gujarat" till 1857, due to the fierce revolts and uprisings by Gurjaro and Raghado in the revolution of 1857, the British used to reduce the influence of Gurjars after the suppression of 1857 revolution
 In all government documents and records, the name "saharanpur-gurjarrat" was banned and orders were issued to enter only the name 'saharanpur'
 yah 1813 i0 main langaura rajya ke raja ramadayal singh panvar kii mrityu ke baad british east india company ke adheen aa gaya
 The British established a camp in Roorkee village with the aim of weakening the ever increasing power of Gurjaro in the ganges-yamuna Doab and at the same time bringing the Ruhelas under their control

 sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he

 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service

 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 germany main vurtsburg vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke praadhyaapak wilhelm conrad rantjan ne 1895 main eksre kaa avishkaar kiya
 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the x-ray code-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form
 eksre ke katipay gun tarangon ke hai tathaa katipay gun kanon ke bhi hai
 First we will consider the wavelet properties
 praarambhik prayogon ke falon se yah spasht tha ki eksre or prakaash ke gunon main samya he
 X-rays and rays of light propagate in simple lines
 prakaash ke samaan eksre kii tivrata bhi duuri ke varg kii pratilomanupati hoti he
 The action occurring on the photo plate and the properties of ionization done in the gas are also similar
 1905 i
 main max ne prayog dwaara yah pramanit kiya ki eksre kaa veg prakaash kaa veg ke samaan–arthath 3×10° sein

prati senkad–he
 X-rays are unaffected in electrical and magnetic fields
 in sab gunon se yah spasht tha ki eksre aaweshit kan nahin, prakaash ke samaan vidyucchumbakeey prakruti ke hai
 The distinction can only be in wavelengths
 haaga, windt, walter, pole, somarfeld ityadi vaigyanikon ke prayogon se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa tha ki eksre kaa tarangadairghy 1×10-8 se
me
 ke nikat he
 But the first conclusive results came from experiments with Lave, Friederisch and Kniping, and the wavelength of X-rays was proved
 is prayog ke pashchaat eksre kii tarangaprakruti suspasht karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parinaamon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke tathaa uske sambandh main anya parimaanon ke praayogic fal praapt karne ke anek praytn hue
 As the x-ray wavelength is much less than the wavelength of light, there are many difficulties in using experiments for x-rays, by which the wavelength of light can be easily measured
 kintu vartmaan kaal main prakashako ke prayogon ke samaan eksre kaa vyatikaran, vivartan, dhruvan ityadi gun suspasht karne ke prayog safal hue hai or eksre ke tarangadairghy utani hi yarthathata se gyaat hue hai jitani se prakaashiya tarangon ke gyaat hue the
 Some of the experiments by which the x-ray waveform is proved are given below- eksre se manibh sanrachana jaanane main vishesh sahaayta milti he 
 Apart from medical uses, X-rays are also used in many ways
 eksre ke vishisht gunon ke kaaran unka upyog vistrut rup se vigyaan kii anek shakhaon tathaa vibhinn udyogon main hota aa rahaa he
 X-rays are used a lot in industries, especially in the construction and control of the properties of manufactured materials
 nirmit padaartho kii antasya trutiyaan eksre photographon dwaara saralata se gyaat kii ja sakati hai
 Aircraft and instruments of the same type of equipment have to withstand extremely high velocity and extreme physical conditions; In the manufacture of such instruments, every element must be innocent and accurate
 aise prayek avyav kii pariksha eksre se kii jaati he or sadosh avyavon kaa tyaag kiya jaataa he
 Metals absorb x-rays, so soft x-rays are unsuitable for examination of the metals' interfaces
 vishaal aakaar ke dhatviya padaartho ke liye atyucch vibhav ke eksre kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 X-rays are very useful in metallurgy and metallurgy
 dhaatu bhi manibhiya hote hai, kintu inke manibh sookshm hote hai or ve yathechh prakaar se sthapit rahete hai, at: dhaatuon kii lave-pratimaa main saamanyat: sankendre vartual rahete hai
 Each circle is of equal intensity, but due to the increase in the size of particles due to some physical activity, the points in these circles also come
 at: eksre vyabhang dwaara iskaa thik thik pataa chal jaataa he ki dhatviya manibhon ke kan kis prakaar ke hai or unka aakaar aadi kaisaa he
 This knowledge has great importance in metallurgy
 dhaatu ke padaarth banane ke samay ushma ke kaaran unamem antarvikruti aa jaati he
 Folding of a metal also causes it to become insoluble
 aisi vikrutiyon kaa vishleshan eksre se ho saktaa he
 Thus X-rays are of particular use in obtaining flawless metals with specific properties
 eksre ke anya upyogon main eksre sookshmdarshi ullekhneey he
 The wavelengths of X-rays are smaller than the wavelengths of light, so X-ray microscopes should be more effective than light microscopes
 1948 main eksre ko kendrit karne ke karkapetric ke praytn anshat: safal hue
 Efforts to magnify the image in this manner and other ways have now crossed the experimental stage and many types of X-ray microscopes manufactured by many manufacturers are accessible

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european
 hind europea parivaar kii kai shakhaayen hai
 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued
 adhiktar bhashavidon ke anusaar "aadim-hind-europea" bhashaa ke punarnirmit shabd yahi ishaara karte hai ki pracheen arya janmasthan ek vishaal, shitoshna ghaas kaa charaagaah tha
 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc
