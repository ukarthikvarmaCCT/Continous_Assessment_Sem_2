 This action can be expressed, for example, by the following equation: Magnesium turnings placed on a flask
 Covered with THF and a small piece of iodine added
 a solution of alkyl bromide was added while heating
 After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated for a while
 Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed
 a small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask
 The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to 0 ° c before the addition of carbonyl compound
 The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out
 a solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent
 The solution was warmed to room temperature
 The reaction was complete

 But Raman knew that unless the wavelengths of Raman-lines and their relative intensity were measured, neither the effect could be satisfactorily explained nor recognized in the scientific world
 iske liye unhone ek quartj spectrograph kaa upyog kiya, jiske parimanatmak parinaam march 31, 1928 ke indian jarnal of physics main prakashit hue
 This is a wonderful effect, only a decade after its discovery the internal structure of 2000 chemical compounds was determined

 1987 se bharat main yah din rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Raman effect can be appropriately interpreted only on the basis of quantum theory, where a monochromatic light beam is seen as the flow of particles containing energy

 Then gradually physicists started losing interest in this new technique

 Also the presence of their relative magnitude could be estimated by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines
 yah ek vyapak takanic thi or iskaa upyog dravon ke atirikt gaison or thoson ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after World War II, due to the developments in sensitive detectors and electronics, scientists began to find infrared spectrometry simpler than Raman spectrometry and the trend towards applications of Raman effect decreased somewhat
 kintu lesar kii khoj ke baad 1960 se raman prabhaav phir se vaigyanik anveshakon main lokapriy ho gaya
 The most difficult problem in detecting the Raman effect was that the Raman lines were very weak, so a very strong light source was required for their detection
 lesar ne na keval aisa atyant teevr prakaash strot pradaan kiya varan prakirnit prakaash main aise nae prabhaav pravartit kiye jinhone raman spectrummiti main nae aayam jod die
 As a result, many variations of Raman spectroscopy developed

 Many different Raman spectrum techniques have been developed with the integration of these concepts
 furier roopantaran takneekon or dota prabandhan ke liye computaron kaa anuprayog jud jane ke baad 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh se vyavsaayik raman spectrummapi uplabdh ho gaye or ab koi bhi kshetra raman prabhaav ke anuprayogon se achoota nahin rahaa he
 The Raman effect provides the most effective technique wherever a particle-specific particle can be identified and quickly extracted without damaging the sample
 abhinav raman spectrummiti ke kuch anuprayog neeche die gaye hai : The applications of Raman effect have been increasing with time and this shows the importance of the legacy of Raman effect in the 21st century

 In mid-september 1958, Bank of America launched its leading bankamericard credit card program in Fresno, California, with an initial mailing of 60,000 unsolicited credit cards
 mul vichaar bioefe ke in-house product deveopment think tanks, customer services research group or iske leader joseph pi
 williams ke dimag kii upaj thi jinhone 1956 main bioefe ke varisht adhikariyon ko apni yojana par kaam karne ke liye raji kiya jo vishwa kaa pehla safal credit card "drop" bana, yaa jab avaanchit credit cardon ko badi sankhya main ek badi aabaadi ko bhejne kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Williams' achievement was in the successful implementation of all-purpose credit cards, not just in pursuing his plan
 By the mid-1950s typical middle-class Americans had already maintained those revolving deposit accounts with many different merchants that were clearly incompetent and inconvenient because it required many cards to be kept with them each month
 Many different bills were required to be paid
 ek ekikrut vittiya saadhan kii jarurat america vittiya seva udyog ke liye pehle se hi spasht rup se dikhne lagi thi, lekin koi bhi yah pataa nahin kar paaya ki isko kaise karnaa he
 Charge cards such as the Diners Club were already in place and "by the mid-1950s at least a dozen attempts were made to create credit cards for all purposes
" " haalanki in shuruaati prayaason ko chote bainkon dwaara anjaam diya gaya tha jinke paas inhen prabhavi banane ke liye sansadhano kii kami thi
 Williams and his team carefully studied these failures and believed that they could avoid repeating the mistakes of those banks; He also studied the operations of existing revolving cards at Sears and Mobil Oil to find out the reasons for their failure
 fresno kaa chayan isaki 250,000 kii aabaadi, is aabaadi main bioefe ke market share or project ke asafal ho jane kii sthiti main jan sampark ke nuksaan ko niyantrit karne se sambandhit isolation ke kaaran kiya gaya
 The 1958 trial was easily successful at first, but then boiled over at BOFA confirming rumors that another bank was going to start its own drop in bofa's home market, San Francisco
 march 1959 tak san francisco or secramento main drops kii shuruyaat ho gayi thi; bioefe los angeles main cardon ko drop kar rahi thi; oktober tak puure rajya ko 20 lakh se adhik credit cardon se bhar diya gaya tha or banamericard ko 20,000 vyapaariyon dwaara sweekaar kiya jane laga tha
 However, the program was fraught with problems as Williams' own belief in the basic honesty of the bank's customers was much more honest and credible and he resigned in December 1959
 4% ke aasapaas kii ummid ke vipareet 22% khate doshapurn paae gaye the or police vibhaag ne rajya bhar main credit card sambandhi dhokhadhadi kii anekon bilkul nai aapraadhik ghatnaon kaa saamana kiya tha
 Both politicians and journalists joined the uproar against Bank of America and its newly fashioned credit cards, especially when it was reported that the cardholder's agreement made customers liable to pay all fees, even those Those who were caught in it due to fraud
 bioefe ko banamericard kii shuruyaat karne se aadhikarik taur par 8
8 million dollar kaa nuksaan hua tha lekin jab vigyaapan or karmchaariyon kii puri laagat ko isamen shaamil kiya gaya to bank kaa vaastavik nuksaan sambhawatah lagbhag 20 million dollar kaa tha
 However, after evacuating Williams and his supporters, the BOFA management found that bankamericard could be saved
 unhone williams ke jane ke baad clin ap ke liye "bade paimaane par prayaas" shuru kiya, samuchit vittiya niyantran ko lagu kiya, apane dwaara failaai gayi gadabadi par maafee maangate hue rajya bhar main tees lakh pariwaron ke liye ek khulaa patr prakashit kiya or aakhirkaar nae vittiya saadhan ko prabhavi banane main sakasham rahe
 The original purpose of BOFA was to introduce the bankamericard product throughout California, but in 1965 BOFA began signing licensing agreements with a group of banks outside California
 agle 11 varshon main vibhinn bainkon ko bank of america se card system kaa license praapt hua, is prakaar puure sanyukt rajya america main banamericard system kaa samarthan karne vaale bainkon kaa ek network taiyaar ho gaya
 The "drops" of unsolicited credit cards due to the BOFA and its licensees and rivals continued unabated, until they were outlawed by the severe financial chaos they spread in the 1970s, but before 100 million among the American public
 Credit cards were distributed
 1960 ke dashak ke uttararddh ke dauraan bioefe ne kai anya deshon main bhi banamericard program kaa license diya tha jinhone sthaneey brands naamon ke saath card jari karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 for example: 1970 main bank of america ne banamericard kaarykram kaa niyantran karnaa chhod diya
 kai banamericard jarikarta bainkon ne is kaarykram kaa niyantran apane haathon main le liya jisase banamericard ink
 kaa gathan hua
 It was decided that it would be an independent non-stock corporation that would take over the management, promotion and development of the bankamericard system in the United States, although Bank of America itself would continue to issue and support international licenses
 By 1972, licenses had been granted in 15 countries
 1974 main antarrashtriya banamericard kaarykram kaa prabandhan karne ke kram main ek bahurashtriya sadsy nigam, ibieensio kii sthapana kii gayi thi
 In 1976 the directors of IBANCO determined that it would be in the best interests of the corporation to bring together various international networks with the same name internationally in the same network; Although there is still a reluctance in many countries to issue a card associated with Bank of America, the association was completely nominal in nature
 isi kaaran se 1975 main banamericard, charjex, barklacard, carte blue or anya sabhi licency nae naam "visa" ke tahat ekajute ho gaye, jisamen vishisht nile, safed or, sunahare dhvaj ko banaae rakhaa gaya

 Altogether 168 member languages of this family have been counted in the Anthologue Language List
 bharat main khaasi or munda bhashaayen is parivaar main aati hai
 Agnayya means related to Agnidisha or situated in Agnidisha
 at: aagney bhashapariwaar se taatpary aise bhashapariwaar se he jisaki bhashaayen mukhya rup se purv evam dakshin ke madhya boli jaati hai
 The famous name of this family is "austroasiatic"
 petter shmit ne "austronesian" athwa "malay--palination" parivaar ko austro--aciatic parivaar se jodakar ek brihat bhashapariwaar kii kalpana kii jise unhone austric parivaar kaa naam diya
 In terms of area, the Austric family is the most elaborate language family in the world
 pashchim main madagascar se lekar purv main purvi dweepasmooh tak tathaa uttar pashchim main punjab ke uttari bhaag se lekar dakshin purv main newzealand tak is bhashapariwaar kaa failaav he
 Thus the main two classes of the Austric family are- austronesian, austro-aciatic
 The languages of the Austronesian or malay-poli- nician class are spread over the islands of the Pacific Ocean
 in bhashaaon ke bhi kai samooh hai, : indonesian, malanesian, mecronesian evam polisian
 In the discussion of the Austronesian class, some of the native languages of Newgini and Australia are also mentioned because some characteristics in these languages are of the Austronesian class

 is shakha kii mukhya upbhashaayen hai : santhali, mundaari, kanavari, khadiya, ho evam shawar
 Munda languages have substantial influence on Indian languages
 manakhmer shakha kii bhashaayen, vartmaan samay main mukhya rup se syam, burma or bharat main boli jaati hai
 There are two main languages of this branch - Maan and Khmer

 "khasi" or "khasia", spoken on the Khasi hills of Assam state of India, belongs to this branch
 nicobar kii "nicobari" evam burma ke wanon main boli janevaali "palong" aadi bhashaaon kaa sambandh bhi is shakha se he
 Anami is the language of the Anonymous Territory which is mainly spoken in the eastern grocery parts of India
 yah ek prakaar se mishrit bhashaa he, jisamen kuch visheshtaayen manakhmer shakha kii evam kuch visheshtaayen chini bhashaa kii hai
 Therefore some people count it in Chinese family rather than in this family

 yah digar baat thi ki us samay tak dilli kii sultanate behad kamjor ho gai thi or mughal badshaah nammaatr kaa samraat rah gaya tha
 Zafar had to pay a heavy price for playing an important role in India's first freedom struggle
 unke putron or prapautron ko british adhikariyon ne saream goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Moreover, he was taken captive to Rangoon, where he died as a prisoner on November 7, 1862
 unhen rangoon main shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafnaaya gaya
 His burial site is now known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah
 aaj bhi koi deshpremi vyakti jab tatkaaleen burma kii yatra karata he to vah jafar kii majaar par jaakar unhen shradhanjali dena nahin bhuulataa
 How much respect people had for him can be gauged from the fact that in many places in India, roads have been named after him, while in Lahore city of Pakistan, a road was named after him

 Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge in Humayun's tomb, but Major Hadas captured him along with his son Mirza Mughal and Khizar Sultan and grandson Abu Bakr
 angrejon ne julm kii sabhi hadein paar kar deen
 When Bahadur Shah Zafar was hungry, the British served him in front of the plate and brought his sons heads
 unhone angrejon ko jawaab diya ki hindustan ke bete desh ke liye sir qurbaan kar apane baap ke paas isi andaaj main aayaa karte hai
 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British
 unke dwaara urdu main likhi gai panktiyaan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai- xxrep 4 , Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
,,, His Urdu poems continued to flourish in Rangoon outside the country

 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London

 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi

 The study of thermodynamics involves a new feeling, that is the feeling of heat
 yadi kisi pind ke gundharm is baat par nirbhar na rahen ki vah kitna garam athwa thanda he to uskaa puraa parichay paane ke liye uske aaytan athwa uske ghanatv ke gyaan kii hi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For example, if we take a fluid, it is believed in mechanics that by increasing the pressure on it, its volume will decrease
 daab kaa maan nishchit karte hi aaytan kaa maan bhi nishchit ho jaataa he
 In this way, one of these two variables is independent and the other is dependent or parent
 parantu pratyaksh anubhav se ham jaanate hai ki aaytan yadi sthir ho to bhi garam yaa thanda karke daab ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, both pressure and volume are independent variables
 aage chalakar aavashyaktaanusaar ham anya char raashiyon kaa bhi samavesh karenge
 And before proceeding further, we shall imagine walls that separate different liquids from each other
 ye deevaaren itani sookshm hongi ki in dravon kii parsparik antarkriya ko nishchit karne ke atirikt un dravon ke gundharm ke upar unka anya koi prabhaav nahin hoga
 The fluid will not pass from one side of these walls to the other
 ham yah bhi kalpana karenge ki ye deevaaren do tarah kii hai
 a wall from which we cannot make any change in the fluid without removing those walls or any part of them and we can make changes in those liquids by electric or magnetic forces because these forces can exert their influence even from a distance
 aisi deevaaron ko ham "sthiroshm" deevaaren kahenge
 The second type of walls will be called "thermodynamic" walls
 ye deevaaren aisi hongi ki samyavastha main inke dwaara alag kiye gaye dravon kii daab tathaa aaytan ke maan swecch nahin honge, arthath yadi ek drav kii daab evam aaytan or duusare drav kii daab nishchit kar di jaae to duusare drav kaa aaytan bhi nishchit ho jayega
 In this case, the pressure and volume of the first fluid will be a relation between P1 and V1 and the pressure and volume of the second fluid P2 and V2, which we can reveal by the following equation: yah sameekaran un dravon ke tapiya sambandh kaa dyotak he
 The use of the wall is only that the substance cannot move from one side to the other
 anubhav dwaara ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki yadi ek drav ke saath anya dravon kii tapiya samyavastha ho to swayan in dravon main aapas main tapiya samyavastha hogi
 This is called the zero principle of thermodynamics
 yadi tapiya samyavasthawale teen dravon ke dabaav tathaa aaytan kramash:, , tathaa hon to inamen sameekaran kii bhanti nimnlikhit sameekaran honge : But according to the zero principle of thermodynamics, these equations are only two independent in these equations, ie satisfying the first two equations is inevitable as well
 yah tabhi sambhav he jab in samikarnon kaa rup is prakaar ho : Any one of these fluids can be used as a thermometer and the value of the function of that fluid can be used as experimental heat
 yadi pehle drav ko tapamapi mana jaae tathaa uske falan kaa maan t ho to duusare drav ke liye hamen jo sameekaran milegaa arthath f2 = t vah duusare drav kaa dashasamikaran kaha jayega
 As such, any property of the fluid can be used for a thermometer, but the relation between p and v is used, the easier it is to measure heat
 ham jaanate hai ki samtapiya avasthaa main alp dabavaali gas kii daab evam aaytan kaa gunanfal achar hota he
 Hence pv = R0 can be used to measure heat and this relationship is also used
 parantu yadi achar ho to kaa vargamul athwa kaa varg bhi achar hoga
 But they are not used
 pv = R0 kaa upyog karne main kya laabh he yah aage chalakar prakat hoga
 Mathematical arrivals are a method of presenting mathematical subsets that are often used

 Although the word 'arrival' has come in its name, the right thing is that this method is an incorporation method and not the arrival method
 is vidhi kaa sabase pehla ullekh san 1575 main francesco mourolico dwaara hua miltaa he
 Using mathematical arithmetic it can be shown that the following statement is true for all natural values of P, n
 : sarvapratham yah dikhaaen ki yah kathan n = 0 ke liye satya he
 p will mean the following statement- spashtatah yah kathan satya he kyonki iskaa daayan paksh or baanyaan paksh dono hi shunya hai atah n = 0 ke liye kathan satya he satya he
 ) : ab dikhaaen ki yadi p satya maan liya jaay to siddh kar sakate hai ki p bhi satya he
 It can be shown as follows: mana, That is, p is true
 baanyaa paksh ko nimnlikhit prakaar se likhiye- Now, according to algebra: isse pradarshit hua ki vastav main p bhi satya he
 Thus mathematical arrival proved that the above statement is true for all values of p n

 The name Kurukshetra signifies 'kurukshetra'
 mukhya ullekh : kurukshetra yuddh The region of Kurukshetra has been a region of early Aryans settling in India and is associated with the mythology of the Mahabharata
 iskaa varnan bhagavadgita ke pehle shloke main miltaa he
 Therefore, this region has been called Dharma Kshetra
 thanesar nagar raja harsh kii rajdhani tha, san 1011 i
 main ise mahmud gazanvi ne tahas-nahas kar diya
 Initially Kurukshetra was called the sacrificial altar of Brahma, it was later called Samantpanchak, while Parshuram, in retaliation for his father's murder, made five kundas from the blood of the Kshatriyas, which, with the blessings of the fathers, were transformed into five sacred reservoirs in the course of time
 Are done aage chalakar yah bhoomi kurukshetra ke naam se prasiddh hui jab ki sanvaran ke putr raja kuru ne sone ke hal se saat kos kii bhoomi jot daali
 Kurukshetra was the center of Vedic culture in the Brahmin period and yagyas must have been performed there with expansion
 isi se ise dharmakshetra kaha gaya or devon ko devkirti isi se praapt hui ki unhone dharm kaa paalan kiya tha or kurukshetra main satron kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 It is mentioned in some Brahmin texts that there was a Kauravya king named Bahlik Pratipatiya
 taittiriya brahman main aayaa he ki kuru-paanchal shishir-kaal main purv kii ore gayi, pashchim main ve greeshm ritu main gayi jo sabase buree ritu he
 The mention of Aitareya Brahmin is very important
 saraswati ne kavash muni kii raksha kii thi or jahaan vah daudti hui gayi use parisarak kaha gaya
 At another place the Aitareya Brahmin has come to say that in his era 'nyagrodha' in Kurukshetra was called 'nyubj'
 aitarey brahman ne kuruon evam panchalon ke deshon kaa ullekh vash-ushinron ke deshon ke saath kiya he
 In the Taittiriya Aranyaka, there is a saga that the Devas did a session and for that Kurukshetra was in the form of an altar
 us vedi ke dakshin ore khandav tha, uttari bhaag turghn tha, prishth bhaag pareen tha or maru utkar tha
 This shows that Khandav, Turghna and Parin were the boundaries of Kurukshetra and Maru district was some distance away from Kurukshetra

 It is known that although Vanaparva mentions certain pilgrimages on the Saraswati coast and Kurukshetra in the 83rd chapter, they do not match with the pilgrimages mentioned in the Brahmins and the Shrutasutras, only in the case of 'vinashan' and 'sarak'
 Can go isse yah prakat hota he ki vanaparv kaa saraswati evam kurukshetra se sambandhit ullekh shrautasutron ke ullekh se kai shatabdiyon ke pashchaat kaa he
 Naradiya Purana has given the names of about 100 pilgrimages of Kurukshetra

 The mythological significance of Kurukshetra is considered to be high
 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 iske atirikt anek puraanon, smritiyon or maharishi vedavyas rachit mahabharat main iskaa vistrut varnan kiya gaya hai
 The special fact is that the mythological boundary of Kurukshetra has been reckoned to be 48 kos which includes the area of kaithal, Karnal, Panipat and Jind in addition to Kurukshetra
 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 Apart from this, it has been detailed in many Puranas, Smriti and Mahabharata composed Maharishi Veda Vyasa
 vishesh tathy yah he ki kurukshetra kii puranic seemaa 48 kos kii maani gai he
 It has come in the forest festival that all the people of Kurukshetra are freed from sin and that too who always says - 'I will go to Kurukshetra and stay there
 ' is vishwa main isse badhkar koi anya punit sthal nahin he
 Even the mites of dust here give the ultimate rank to the sinner
 ' yahan tak ki ganga kii bhi tulana kurukshetra se kii gayi he
 The Naradaiya Purana states that the planets, constellations and stars fear falling down from time to time, but those who die in Kurukshetra do not fall on the earth again, that is, they do not take birth again
 kurukshetra ambala se 25 mile purv main he
 It is a very sacred place

 In the Rigveda, the son of Trusadasu, Kurushravan is mentioned

 In the Atharvaveda there is a discussion of a Kauravya husband, who talks to his wife
 brahman-granthon ke kaal main kurukshetra ati prasiddh tirth-sthal kaha gaya he
 a saga mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana shows that the Devas performed a yajna at Kurukshetra in which they had previously deprived both Ashvins of the yagya-bhaga
 maitrayani samhita evam taittiriya brahman kaa kathan he ki devon ne kurukshetra main satr kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 The implicit feeling in these utterances is that in the Brahmin period, the Vedic people gave great importance to the sacrifice of Yajna, as it is mentioned in the Rigveda - 'yajnayya Yajnamayajanta Devastani Dharmani Prathamanyasana
 ' The region which was repeatedly plowed by Kuru was named Kurukshetra
 kehete hai ki jab kuru bahut manoyog se is kshetra kii jutai kar rahe the tab indra ne unase jaakar is parishram kaa kaaran poocha
 Kuru said- 'whoever is killed here will go to the virtuous world
 ' indra unka parihaas karte hue swarglok chale gayi
 This happened many times
 indra ne devataaon ko bhi bataaya
 The gods said to Indra - 'if possible, make Kuru friendly to you, otherwise if people go to heaven without sacrificing our part there, then our part will be destroyed
 ' tab indra ne pun: kuru ke paas jaakar kaha-'nareshwar, tum vyarth hi ksht kar rahe ho
 If any animal, bird or human being killed here by staying foodless or fighting it will be part of heaven
 ' kuru ne yah baat maan lee
 This place is called samanta-panchak or Prajapati's Uttaravadi

 The popular meaning of telecommunications has always included electrical signals and nowadays people have excluded postal or any other crude method of telecommunications from its meaning
 isliye, bhartiya doorsanchaar ke itihaas ko telegraph kii shuruuaat ke saath prarambh kiya ja saktaa he
 The postal and telecommunications sectors in India had a slow and uneasy beginning
 1850 main, pehali praayogic bijli taar line diamond harbar or kolkata ke bich shuru kii gai thi
 In 1851, it was opened to the British East India Company

 He continued to work towards the development of telecom throughout this period
 1854 main ek alag vibhaag kholaa gaya, jab telegraph suvidhaon ko janata ke liye kholaa gaya tha
 In 1880, two telephone companies The Oriental Telephone Company Limited and Anglo Indian Telephone Company Limited approached the Government of India to establish a telephone exchange in India
 is anumati ko is aadhaar par asweekrut kar diya gaya ki telephone kii sthapana karnaa sarkaar kaa ekadhikaar tha or sarkaar khud yah kaam shuru karegi
 In 1881, the government, against its earlier decision, granted a license to the Oriental Telephone Company Limited of England to open telephone exchanges in Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad, establishing in 1881 the first formal telephone service in the country
 28 janvari 1882, bharat ke telephone ke itihaas main red letters de he
 On this day, Major E

 The Central Telephone Exchange had 93 customers

 In the British era, while all major cities and towns in the country were connected by telephone, in 1948 the total number of telephones was only around 80,000

 Although some innovative steps were being taken from time to time, such as for example the Telex service in Mumbai in 1953 and the first route between Delhi and Kanpur and Lucknow and Kanpur between 1960, Sam Pitroda started in the eighties
 a wave of change began
 ve taaja hawa kaa jhonka lekar aaye
 The real scenario of change was seen with the announcement of the National Telecom Policy in 1994
 1975 main, doorsanchaar vibhaag ko pi and tii se alag kar diya gaya tha
 The Department of Telecommunications was responsible for all telecom services in the country until 1985, when Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited was separated from the Department of Telecommunications and given the responsibility of running the services of Delhi and Mumbai
 1990 ke dashak main sarkaar dwaara doorsanchaar kshetra ko udaarikaran- nijeekaran- vaishvikaran niti ke tahat nijee nivesh ke liye khol diya gaya
 Therefore, it became necessary to separate the policy branch of the government from its executive branch
 bharat sarkaar ne 1 oktober 2000 ko doorsanchaar vibhaag ke parichaalan hisse ko nigam ke adheen kar use bharat sanchaar nigam limited kaa naam diya
 Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Tata Indicom, Hutch, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea, etc
 successfully entered the high-potential Indian telecom market
 bharat sarkaar kai guton dwaara bani thi, jinaki vichaardhaaraein alag-alag thim
 Some of them wanted to keep the market open for foreign players, while others wanted the government to regulate the infrastructure and limit the participation of foreign players
 Due to this political background it was very difficult to bring liberalization in telecom

 Liberalization began in 1981 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed a merger contract with the state-run telecommunications company with Alcatel CIT of France in an effort to lay 5,000,000 lines every year
 lekin raajnneetik virodh ke kaaran jald hi is niti ko tyaagna padaa

 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, during this period, under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi, many public sector organizations such as the Department of Telecommunications, VSNL and MTNL were established
 is kaarykaal main kai takneekee vikaas hue phir bhi videshi khilaadiyon ko doorsanchaar vyapaar main bhaag lene kii anumati nahin thi
 Telephone demand continued to grow
 isi avadhi ke dauraan aisa hua ki 1994 main pien raav ke netritv main sarkaar ne rashtriya doorsanchaar niti lagu kii, jisamen nimnlikhit kshetron: swaamitv, seva or doorsanchaar ke buniyadi dhaanche ke viniman main parivartan laayaa gaya
 He was also successful in establishing joint ventures between state-owned telecom companies and international players
 But still the facility of full ownership was confined to the government owned organizations only

 For cellular service, two service providers were allowed per circle and each provider was given a 15-year license

 After 1995, the government created TRAI, which reduced government interference in setting tariffs and formulating policies
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Political powers changed in 1999 and the new government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more supportive of new reforms, which introduced better liberalization policies

 The proposal to increase the share of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by anti-political parties and leftist thinkers
 gharelu vyapaar samooh chaahate the ki sarkaar viesanel kaa nijeekaran kar de
 Finally in April 2002, the government reduced its stake in VSNL from 53% to 26% and decided to invite it to private enterprises for sale

 It was a gateway for many foreign investors to join the Indian telecom market

 yah siddh satya he ki yadi mata shikshit na hogi to desh kii santaano kaa kadaapi kalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 Education plays a particularly important role as a basis for women's development towards adult life
 shiksha anya adhikaron ko surakshit karne ke liye ladakiyon or mahilaon ko sakasham karne main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Women continue to face difficulties due to not being able to say many problems to men

 In 1849 and the name of that university was Bethune College
 san 1986 main rashtriya shiksha niti ko punargathan dene ko sarkaar ne faisla kiya
 The government thought it necessary to give education to women for the progress of the state, for democracy and to improve the condition of women
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad san 1947 main vishvavidhyalay shiksha ayog ko banaaya gaya
 The Commission recommended that the quality of education in women be improved

 Education of girls and women is an important step in overcoming poverty

 In that case, the entire burden of the family rests on the women of the families
 mahilaon kii aisi zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye unhe shikshit kiya janaa chahie
 They can enter various fields
 mahilaayein shikshakon, doctoron, vakeelon or prashaasak ke rup main kaam kar rahi hai
 Educated women can become good mothers
 mahilaon kii shiksha se dahej samasya, berojgaare kii samasya, aadi saamaajik shanti se jude maamalon ko aasaani se hal kiya ja saktaa he
 This utterance is famous in Sanskrit- 'nasti vidyasam chakshurnasti matri samoguru:'
 This means that this world does not have the same field of learning and does not have the same guru as mother
 ’ yah baat puri tarah sach he
 The first and most impact on the child's development is that of his mother
 mata hi apane bachche ko paath padhaati he
 This initial knowledge of the child becomes a permanent basis of life, like the indelible streak on the stone
 lekin aaj puure bharatvarsh main itane asaamaajik tatv ubhar aae hai, jinhone maa-bahanon kaa rishta khatm kar diya he or jo bhoga-vilaas kii jindagi jeena adhik upyogi samajhane lage hai
 This is the reason why mothers and sisters from towns to cities are insecure
 asuraksha ke kaaran hi balaatkaar or samuhik balaatkaar jaisi anek ghatnaon ke jaal main fasakar mahilaon kaa jivan nark ban chukaa he
 In fact, it is said that the education of women is no less important than the education of any man
 samaaj kii nai ruparekha taiyaar karne main mahilaon kii shiksha purushon se sau guna adhik upyogi he
 Therefore, the government should strive for women's education
 tabhi atyaachaar jaisi ghatnaon par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 Being financially self-reliant after receiving education does not mean that a woman should become educated and take a front in front of her, considering the male as her rival
 balki vah aarthik kshetra main bhi purush ke baraabar samanta kaa adhikaar praapt karke uske saath maitrapurna sambandh ke samikarn banane main sakasham bane
 Just as the body requires food, education is necessary for mental development
 agar nari hi shikshit nahin hogi to vah na to safal gruhinee ban sakegi or na kushal mata
 The reason for the rise of child crime in the society is not the mental development of the child
 agar ek maan hi ashikshit hogi to vah apane bacchon kaa sahi maargdarshan karke unka maansik vikaas kaise kar paaegi or ek swasth samaaj kaa nirmaan evam vikaas sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, it can be said that in the future only educated women can come out of the darkness of despair and exploitation and show the right path to the family
 iskaa ek rup shiksha main striyon ko purushon kii hi tarah shaamil karne se sambandhit he
 In another way it refers to the special education system made for women
 bharat main madhya or punarjagran kaal ke dauraan striyon ko purushon se alag tarah kii shiksha dene kii dharna viksit hui thi

 In sociology, social facts refer to the values, cultural standards, and social structures that transform the individual and impose social restrictions on them
 imil durkhim ne nimna chaar pramukh pustak likhih In these books mentioned above, Durkheim has systematically presented his ideas
 durkhim dwaara pratipaadit saamaajik tathy kii avadharana unki pustak ‘rules of sosiological methds’ main vistaar se kii he
 Durkheim's idea of social fact is completely different from the individualist views of Herbt Spencer
 unka mat tha ki jitani bhi saamaajik kriyaayein hai, uskaa vishleshan saamaajik sandarbh ke adheen hi kiya janaa chahie, arthath saamaajik kriyaaon ko samajhane kaa aadhaar samaaj he
 Therefore, the sociology studies that are done on the basis of the person or psychology, they always consider it unscientific
 samajashaastra kii paribhaasha dete hue unhone samajashaastra ko ‘‘saamaajik tathyon kaa adhyayan bataaya he
 "he said that just as all subjects choose their study subjects, similarly sociologists also have to study social fact specifically
 durkhim ne saamaajik tathy kaa vishleshan vistaar se kiya he
 He said that social fact is the main field of sociological study
 ve saamaajik tathy ko ek aisa tathy maanate hai, jo vastunishth hota he, or iskaa nirikshan ham sabhi vastu ke rup main kar sakate hai
 Therefore, social fact is seen as an object, a thing, a physical substance, and just as a physical substance is studied in physics, social studies study social fact
 durkhim ke dwaara saamaajik tathyon kaa jo vishleshan kiya gaya he, uske aadhaar par ‘soshal factos’ kii nimna visheshtaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa haih Durkheim, while mentioning the characteristics of the social element in the 'social Facts', said that the social fact remains outside the human being while outside the human being, it affects his thoughts
 chunki saamaajik tathy manushya ke baahar rahata he isliye ise samajhnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Although social fact remains outside man, but it affects the person
 iske prabhaav tathaa mahatv ko sabhi apane andar mahasoos kar sakate hai
 For example, the approval of society, there is a kind of pressure on man to control his behavior
 jiske kaaran vyakti apane vyavhaar ko niyantrit karata he
 The nature of social facts is universal, that is, it affects the conscious state of all persons equally
 is rup main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaajik tathy, saamaaj ke sabhi vyaktiyon ko prabhavit karte hai, isliye yah manushya ke samuhik jivan main samaan rup se apana prabhaav banaakar rahata he
 For example, it can be said that when we talk about religion, then we accept that religious belief and worship according to it is a part of the collective life of all people
 arthath yah kaha ja saktaa he ki tathyon ke do swaroop hote hai - ek swaroop vah he jo vyakti tak hi simit rahata he or doosraa swaroop uskaa saamaajik swaroop he jo uske kaary karne kii paddati, sochane kii paddati ko vyaktigat rup se bhi prabhavit karata he
 Along with this there is a second social form of fact, due to which the whole society is affected by it rather than the person
 jahaan tak durkhim dwaara die gaye saamaajik tathy kii avadharana kaa prashn he, durkhim ne saamaajik tathy ke saamaajik swaroop kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 In his description of suicide, he has described in detail that although suicide is linked to a person's personal thinking, when it takes the form of personal thinking social thinking, then it also has a collective form, due to which Society is also affected
 isliye unhone aatmahatya ko ek saamaajik tathy ke rup main samajashastreey adhyayan kiye jane par bal diya
 When social fact is called objective, it means that how this fact can be studied without prejudice
 aatmahatya ke adhyayan main unhone yah paaya kii aatmahatya ke bare main pehle se hi kuch manovaigyanik vishleshan prastut kiye gaye the
 He believed that suicide should be analyzed neither on a biological basis nor on a psychological basis
 unhone in donon siddhanton kaa khandan karte hue yah bataaya ki aatmahatya kii vaardaaton kaa ek samajashastreey adhyayan kiya janaa chahie, or isliye unhone purvanirdhaarit sonch kii aalochana karte hue aatmahatya kaa ek nae sonch ke tahat samajashastreey vishleshan prastut kiya
 They found that the chances of committing suicide increases when a person begins to feel isolated with society
 dharm main aasthaa rakhane vaale vyakti main aatmahatya karne kii sambhaavna apekshaakrit kam hoti he
 Similarly, he believed that unmarried person tended to commit suicide more than married person
 is prakaar durkhim ne aatmahatya ko ek saamaajik tathy maanakar uske saamaajik sandarbh main vishleshan karne par zyada mahatv diya
 Apart from this, he saw social fact as an independent entity, describing the characteristic of social fact
 unhone saamaajik tathy ko sui jeniris kaha he
 Sui generis means to maintain an independent existence of social fact
 saamaajik tatv ko unhone ek vastu mana he
 That is, social fact is as tangible as an object or thing
 inhen kisi or tatv kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti isliye yah swatantra hote hai
 Thus it becomes clear that the concept of social fact propounded by Durkheim is a scientific concept by which he has tried to establish the basis of social analysis of facts in sociology on scientific criterion
 jis prakaar kaa vishleshan durkhim ne prastut kiya he vah vastav main agast cont dwaara die gaye pratyakshvaad ke siddhant ko hi pusht karata he

 tulykaalik motor yaa sincronas motor prayavarti dhara se chalane vaali vidyut motor he
 Its name is equivalent to a synchronous motor or synchronous motor because the rotational speed of its rotor is exactly the same as the rotational magnetic field speed in the stator
 is motor kaa upyog praayah kisi lod ko ghumaane main nahin kiya jaataa balki shakti gunank ko sudhaarney main kiya jaataa he
 In special situations it is also used in running loads
 sincronas chaal, Where: tulykaalik motor ke mukhya bhaag hai- stater or roter
