06 Hussainpur Shahjahanpur is a village in Atrauli, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 bhashavigyaan main, sanket prakriyaaon, yaa abhivyanjana or sampreshan, lakshan or pratik kaa adhyayan sanketavigyaan kehalaata he
 It is generally divided into the following three branches: sanketikta ko aksar mahatvapurn maanavshastreey ayaamon sahit dekha jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, ambarto iko kaa prastaav he ki prayek saanskrithik ghatana kaa adhyayan sampreshan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 However, some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of science
 ve prakritik vigyaan se sambandhit kshetron kii bhi jaanch karte hai-jaise ki kis prakaar jeev duniya main apane lakshanik karm sthiti ke bare main bhavishyakathan kar sakate hai or uske anukool ban sakate hai 
 saamanytah, lakshanik siddhant sanketon yaa sanket pranaaliyon ko apane adhyayan ke uddeshy ke rup main lete hai: jivit praaniyon main soochna kaa sampreshan jeev-lakshaniki yaa praani-lakshaniki main aavruth kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is the branch of semiotics that deals with the formal characteristics of signs and symbols
 darasal, vaakya-vigyaan "un niyamon se sambandhit he jo yah shasit kare ki kis prakaar vaakyansh or vaakya banane ke liye shabdon ko joda jaae
" charles morris kehete hai ki arthvigyaan sanketon kaa apane nirdesh or vastuon ke saath ve jo sambandh nirupit kar sakate hai yaa karte hai, ke sambandh se judaa he; or upyogetavaad lakshanikta ke jaiviny pahaluon ke saath sambandh rakhata he, arthath sanketon kii kriya main ghatit hone vaale sabhi manovaigyanik, jaivik yaa saamaajik ghatnaayen
 The term, written in English as semeiotics, was first used by Henry Stubbs in the definitive sense of denoting the branch of medical science related to the presentation of signs
 jon loke ne en esse cansarning human anderstanding ke pustak 4, adhyay 21 main semeiotike or semeiotics shabdon kaa prayog kiya
 In it, he explains how science can be divided into three parts: uske baad loke is teesri shrenee ke swabhaav ke bare main, use Σημειωτικη naam dete hue or nimna shabdon main "sanketon ke siddhant" ke rup main samajhaate hue vistrut karte hai: In the nineteenth century, Charles Sanders Pierce defined what he called a "semiotic" which is "the semi-essential, or formal principle of signs", the essence of which is "


 what must be the characters of all signs used by the intellect Are able to learn by experience "and which follows philosophical logic according to the signs and signs process
 charles morris ne "semiotic" shabd kaa upyog karne main piers kaa anusaran kiya or use maanav sampreshan se pashuon ke seekhney or sanketon ke upyog tak vistrut kiya
 However, Ferdinand de Laussure, looking at a very important area within symptomology, found it related to social science: lakshanshasthri sanketon or sanket pranaaliyon ko unke sanchaar tareeqe ke anusaar vargeekrut karte hai 
 sarthakata kii yah prakriya shabd banane ke liye maanvon dwaara prayukt kuta ke upyog par nirbhar karata he jo vyaktigat swar yaa akshar, apane angavinyas yaa bhaawanaaon se darshane ke liye shaareerik kriyaayein, yaa saamaanya rup se pahane jane vaale vastra ho sakate hai
 To create a word for reference to an object, the community must accept a common meaning in its language
 But that word will only be able to transmit the grammatical structure of the language and the meaning within the code
 The codes also represent the values of culture and are capable of adding new shades of meaning to every aspect of life
 lakshan-vigyaan or sampreshan adhyayan ke bich sambandh ko spasht karne ke liye, sampreshan ko strot se praptakarta ke bich data antaran kii prakriya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Therefore, communication thinkers build models to elucidate the biology, psychology, and mechanics involved on the basis of code, medium, and context
 donon vishay yah bhi maanate hai ki takneekee prakriya ko is tathy se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki praptakarta ko data kaa kutanuwaad karnaa padataa he arthath data ko mukhya ke rup main pahachaanate hue uskaa arth nikaalane main sakasham rahanaa padataa he
 This means that there is essentially an interplay between semiotics and communication
 vastav main, kai avadharanaen saajha kii jaati hai, haalanki prayek kshetra main jor alag hota he
 Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics, Marcel Danesi suggests that symptomatologists have had priorities, studies of importance before and communication later
 jin-jequis natiez dwaara ativaadee drushti pesh kii gai, jinhone ek sangeet-shastrajna ke rup main apane lakshanikta ke anuprayog ke liye sampreshan ke saidhantik adhyayan ko apraasangik mana
 Semiotics differs from linguistics in the sense that it generalizes the definition of a sign so that signs can be incorporated into any medium or sensory system
 Thus it increases the prevalence of sign systems and sign relations and gives the definition of language its most elaborate rhetorical or semiotic meaning
 sanketon kii aavashyak visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke taur par shabd "semiotic" ke liye piers kii paribhaasha main use maanav vikaas ke kram main vishwa kii bhashaaon dwaara hasil aakasmik visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke rup main bhashaa vigyaan se alag karne kaa prabhaav shaamil he
 Perhaps it is more difficult to distinguish between semiotics and philosophy of language
 ek myne main, vishyon ke antar kii apeksha yah vastutah paramparaon ke bich kaa antar adhik he
 Various authors have named themselves "philosophers of language" or "semioticians"
 yah antar vishleshnatmak or mahadwipiya darshan ke algaav se mail nahin khaataa he
 Looking closely, some differences can be found with respect to subjects
 bhashaa kaa darshan, prakritik bhashaaon yaa saamaanya taur par bhashaaon par adhik dhyaan detaa he, jabaki lakshanikta kaa sambandh gaiyr bhashaai mahatv se adhik gaharaa he
 Philosophy of language also has a strong relationship with linguistics, while semiotics is close to certain humanities and cultural anthropology
 Semiosis yaa semeiosis aisi prakriya he jo sanketon ke madhyam se duniya ke bare main kisi bhi jeev kii ashanka se arth grahan karte hai
 The importance and significance of signs has been recognized throughout the history of philosophy and psychology
 plato or arestu donon ne sanketon or duniya ke rishton ke bich ke sambandh kaa pataa lagaaya or augustin ne paramparaagat pranali ke antargat sanket ke swabhaav par vichaar kiya
 These theories had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, especially through educational philosophy
 More recently, Umberto Eco has argued in his Semiotics and Philosophy of Language that semiotic theory is rooted in the works of most, possibly all leading thinkers
 is kshetra ke praarambhik vichaarkon main shaamil hai charles dablyoo
 morris
 maiks blike, bartrand rasel ke kaary ko praarambhik maanate hai
 Applications of semiotics include: lakshanikta keval dhire-dhire khud ko ek sammanneey vishay ke rup main sthapit kar rahi he
 In some countries, its role is limited to literary criticism and visual and audio medium only, but this narrow focus can extend to a broad general study of social and political forces on how active status can be shaped within modern culture
 
 vartmaan jansanchaar ke yug main sanchaar madhyamon ke chayan or sanchaar ranneetiyon kii dizine main praudyogiki niyatatvvaad ke mudde nae mahatv grahan karte hai
 The use of metaphorical methods to reveal various levels of meaning and sometimes hidden purposes has led some to give a hellish look to the elements of the subject as Marxists, Nashists etc
 anusandhan kaa prakaashan samarpit patrikaon main hua he jaise ki juri lotman dwaara santhaapit or tartu uniwarsity press dwaara prakashit sin system studies ; thomas e
sebiok dwaara santhaapit or mouton de gruitor dwaara prakashit semiotica ; zeitsharift far semiotic ; european jarnal of semiotics ; varsas or anya; american jarnal of semiotics or anya vishyon kii patrikaon main sweekrut lekh, visheshkar darshan or saanskrithik aalochana ke prati unmukh patrikaayen
 Semiotics has produced several subfields, including but not limited to: sachitr lakshanikta kala ke itihaas or siddhant ke saath antarang rup se judi he
 However, it has moved ahead of both in at least one fundamental way
 jahaan kala ke itihaas ne uske drishy vishleshan ko chitron kii kam sankhya tak simit rakhaa he, jo "kalatmak rachana" ke rup main arhata rakhte hai, sachitr lakshanikta ne aam taur par chitron ke lakshanon par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 This traditional history and theory of art — and at the same time, diverging from other major streams of semiotic analysis — allows for a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics
 ghatana-kriya vishleshan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan, sanrachanaatmak or sangyanatmak bhashaa-vigyaan tathaa drishyaatmak maanav-shaastra / samaaj-shaastra se kuch prabhaav grahan kiye gaye hai
 Diet has been a favorite traditional subject to illustrate semiotic theory, as it is highly accessible and can be easily linked to the life of the average person
 lakshanikta sanket prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan he, jab vah vyaktigat rup se yaa samoohon main sanchalit hota he or kis prakaar ye sanket prakriyaayein arth ko parichaalit karne or saath hi samajhane main antardrushti pradaan karti hai
 Diet is called symbolic because it changes its meaning when prepared
 ek junglee jaanavar dwaara laash se khaae gaye aahaar kii tulana kisi saanskrithik pakwaan kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye rasoighar main maanvon dwaara taiyaar aahaar se kiye jane par spashtatah arth badal jaataa he
 Food can also be called a symbol of some social gestures
 "agar khaadya padaarth ko ek sanket-paddati ke rup main vyavahrut kiya jaataa he, to jo sandesh vah kutabaddh karata he vah abhivyakt saamaajik sambandhon ke pattern main paaya jayega
 sandesh padanukram kii vibhinn shrenee, samavesh or bahishkaran, simaaen or simaaon ke paar len-dein ke bare main he"
 The diet is symbolic without regard to how it is prepared
 chaahe bhojan ko kisi achche dining restaraan main puri parishuddhta ke saath taiyaar kiya gaya he, yaa kooday ke dher se uthaaya gaya he, todaa, niglaa, yaa junglee jaanavar dwaara khaaya gaya he, tab bhi hameshaa hi is aadhaar par arth nikaala ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht aahaar ko kaise taiyaar kiya gaya or kis sandarbh main use parosa gaya
 Current research has found that, as branches develop and become more international, their symbols become more symbolic and less iconic
 kisi sanket kii pratishtha or pratikatmakataa saanskrithik paripati par nirbhar karti he or us aadhaar par ek duusare ke saath sambandhit hai
 If cultural practice has a strong influence on the sign, the sign acquires more symbolic value

 yah sukhoi esayu-26 ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya tha or ise apane purvavarti ke adhikansh dizin or takneekee suvidhaon viraasat main mili he
 The Sukhoi Su-29 is made up of 60% of the aircraft structure due to the widespread use of composite materials, increasing the empty weight of the single-seat Sukhoi SU-26 by only 50 kg
 sukhoi esayu-29 praarambhik payalat airobetics shiksha, udaan prashikshan, or airobetic pratiyogitaaon or air sho main payalton kii bhagidaari ke saath-saath sainya or naagarik payalton ke udaan kaushal ko banaae rakhane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Data from Jane All the World Aircraft 1993-94, Sukhoi saamaanya lakshan Display utak sanvardhan vah kriya he jisase vividh shaareerik utak athwa koshikaaye kisi bahya madhyam main upyukt paristhitiyon ke vidyaman rahane par poshit kii ja sakati hai
 It is well known that different types of cells in the body have the power to grow according to different stimuli and produce other cells similar to their own
 yah bhi gyaat he ki jeevon main ek aantarik paristhiti bhi hoti he
 Which is more important than external conditions in controlling the functioning of living tissue
 utak-sanvardhan-pravidhi kaa vikaas is moulik uddeshy se hua ki koshikaon ke kaaryakari gunon ke adhyayan kii cheshtaa kii jaae or yah pataa lagaaya jaae ki ye koshikaaye apni bahya paristhitiyon se kis prakaar prabhavit hoti hai or unpar swayan kya prabhaav daalati hai
 For this it was necessary that the cells should be isolated and kept alive in an artificial medium so that the whole organism would not be affected by them
 yadhyapi utak sanvardhan main safalataa paane kii cheshtaa 1885 i
 main kii gai thi, tathaapi safalataa 1906 i
 main mili, jab harrison ne ek saral pravidhi nikaali jisase kritrim madhyam main aropit utak ugta or viksit hota rahata tha
 Since then the method became more and more accurate and advanced
 poshak madhyam kii sanrachana bhi adhik uparyukt hoti hui he
 Now it is possible to grow cells and tissues from almost every part of the body and they can be kept alive for astonishing times
 kaach main poshit kii ja sakanevaali koshikaaye anek hai, jaise dharichhad koshikaaye, tantughat, asthi tathaa upasthi, tantrika, peshi or lasikaparv kii koshikaaye, pleeha, prajan granthiyaan, garbhkala, garbhkmal, rakt, asthimajja ityadi
 In addition to the study of the functional and structural properties of cells, tissue-culture-methods have proved useful in almost all areas of experimental biology and medicine, especially cell elements, physics, embryonic elements, cytokines, cytology, naturalization
 And in the study of tumors and viruses
 is pravidhi se nimnlikhit vishyon ke adhyayan main sahaayat mili he : rudhir kaa bananaa, kaarykaran tathaa rogon kii utpatti; koshika ke bheetar honevaali prakinviya tathaa upapachayee rasinic pratikriyaayein; ang-sanchaalan-kriya, koshika vibhaajan tathaa bhedakaran ; koshika kii atisookshm rachanaayen, jaise vimedabh jaal tathaa kanalsutra ; koshika par vikiran, taap, bhautik athwa rasinic aghat athwa jeevanuon ke akraman; unase utpann padaartho kii kriya ke kaaran honevaali kshati; arbudwali tathaa saadhaaran koshikaon kaa antar or saadhaaran koshikaon se arbudwali koshikaon kaa bananaa
 There are many types of procedures used for tissue culture; Such as those in which hanging point bottles, shallow baskets or other special utensils are used
 sanvardhan ke liye prayukt madhyam vividh prakaar ke hai, jaise raktplavika, lasi, lasika, sharirkriya ke liye upyukt lavan ghol 
 When choosing a medium for tissue culture, a subtle knowledge of the abnormal environment of the organism's cell is essential
 iske atirikt iskaa bhi nirnay kar lenaa aavashyak he ki prayek jati kii koshika ke liye paryaavaran main kya-kya baaten aavashyak hai
 In order to establish the above environment it is also absolutely necessary that no other type of bacteria reach the medium because the medium in which cells are grown is also very good for other bacteria to grow, whether those bacteria are pathogenic or not
 
 in jeevanuon kii vruddhi avashya hi sanvardhaneey koshikaon ko maar daalegi
 Recently, bacterial hostility similar to sulfonamides and penicillin has been of great help in suppressing this type of infection
 madhyam main ugte hue utakon main upapachayee parivartan hote rahete hai or yadi upaapachay se utpann padaarth madhyam main ekatra hote rahenge to koshikaon ke liye ve ghaatak ho sakate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to change the medium even before the quantity of waste is reached
 utak-sanvardhan ke vishay main upar keval thodi si baaten di ja saki hai
 It is important to note that tissue culture is only a helpful method in understanding some biological functions
 na to ise moolyarahit maanakar isaki upeksha kii ja sakati he or na ise jeevaprakriyaaon ko samajhane ke liye jaadu kii chadi mana ja saktaa hai

 praani kii paribhaasha kai prakaar se kii gai he
 Some people call an animal such that it does not produce carbohydrates, proteins and fats, but depends on them for living
 in padaarthon ko praani bahya strot se hi praapt karata he
 The plants that make them are organisms of plants, which create them from substances derived from inorganic sources
 ye donon hi paribhaashaayen sab praaniyon par lagu nahin hotin
 There are some fungi and bacteria of plant species, which get their food from external sources
 kuch aise praani bhi hai, jo starch kaa srijan swayan karte hai
 Therefore, it becomes difficult in some cases to differentiate between animals and plants
 yahi kaaran he ki pranivigyaan or padpavigyaan kaa adhyayan ek samay vigyaan kii ek hi shakha main saath saath kiya jaataa tha or uskaa naam jaiviki yaa jeev vigyaan diya gaya he
 But today these two branches have become so developed that it is not possible to study them together
 at: aajkal pranivigyaan evam padpavigyaan kaa adhyayan alag alag hi kiya jaataa he
 The study of zoology is of great importance to humans
 manushyake chaaron ore alag-alag prakaar ke jantu rahete hai
 He sees them and he gets equal work from them
 kuch jantu manushya ke liye bade upyogi siddh hue hai
 Many animals are the food of humans

 Some animals provide wool from which precious woolen cloth is prepared hote hai
 Silk, honey, lacquer, etc

 kuch jantu manushya ke sabhi hai or ye manushya ko ksht pahunchaate, fasal nasht karte, pidaa dete or kabhi kabhi maar bhi daalate hai
 Therefore, the study of zoology is important for us
 bauddhik vikaas ke kaaran manushya anya praaniyon se bhinn hota he, par shaareerik banaavat or shaareerik pranali main anya kuch praaniyon se badi samanta rakhata he
 The senses and functioning of some of these creatures are very similar to the senses and functioning of humans

 Many other writers in Greece and Rome have written books on natural science, which mention animals
 baad main lagbhag hajaar varsh tak pranivigyaan bhula diya gaya tha
 In the 16th century, the attention of this science was again attracted
 us samay chikitsa vidyalayon ke adhyapakon kaa dhyaan is ore vishesh rup se gaya or ve iske adhyayan main pravrutt hue
 Special progress of this science took place in the 17th and 18th centuries
 sookshmdarshi ke avishkaar ke baad iskaa adhyayan bahut vyapak ho gaya
 Modern zoology often laid its foundation at this time and special attention was paid to the naming and morphology of animals
 linius ne "di system ov nechar" naamak pustak main pehle pahal jantuon ke namakaran kaa varnan kiya he
 By that time, the number of known animals had become very large and their classification became necessary
 pranivigyaan kaa vistaar aaj bahut bad gaya he
 It has become necessary to divide it into several branches for proper study

 We are confronted by powerful forces telling us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us They are shocked that action organizations, sit-ins, civil disobedience and protests are becoming our everyday tools, just as strikes, demonstrations and union organization became yours to insure that bargaining power genuinely existed on both sides of the table Our needs are identical to labor's needs: decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures That is why the labor-hater and labor-baiter is virtually always a twin-headed creature spewing anti-negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth

 larens stern angreji-yri upanyaaskaar tha
 After studying at Cambridge, Stern spent his life as a pastor
 is peshey main uski koi vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He turned to literature too late
 1760 main 'di life and opinions ov tristram shaidi, jait' naamak do khandon main usne ek kaalpanik nayak tristram kaa aadhaar banaakar upanyaas prakashit kiye
 This earned him fame
 vah apana girjaghar chhodkar bhaag gaya, yadhyapi vah uski nammaatr seva karata rahaa
 He continued to write more volumes of the same novel which were completed in 1767
 is upanyaas main tisare khand tak nayak kaa janm nahin hota
 In it, he has spent his power in a detailed description of the environment
 uske agle varsh 1768 main yani apni mrityu keshav usne 'e centemental jarney thru france and itaili' prakashit kiya
 After the famous recovery, he himself did this migration, which is given in a novel form in this book
 iske saath hi usne kai dharmik pravachan bhi likhe, jo prakashit hue
 Stern's literary features are his highly personal style
 usamen asangati, jaan boojhkar vishyantar, anishchit paatr, anirdisht ghatnaayen aadi vichitrataaen hoti he
 Discrepancy is the basic tone of its composition
 vah apane upanyaas main bhi koi kathanak lekar nahin chalaa he
 Everything goes on like this
 vicitra sanakee kism ke paatr ek ke baad ek chale aate hai
 There is no concatenation or preposition in them
 uski bhavukta bhi jaan bujhakar badi chadhi, atiranjit lagati he
 This sentimentality is a symptom of Saturn's rebellion in protest against the eighteenth-century intellectualism
 stern ne bahut kuch rabele naamak francisi lekhak ke anukaran main yah style apanaai he
 Rabelle has more immunity and rebellion against conservative ethics, not as much in Stern

 But no one else could get the same style again
 stern kaa sthaan angreji sahitya main, upanyaskaar ke naate yaa pravaas varnanakaar ke naate koi bahut bada nahin he
 But Stern was very successful in giving a new direction in English prose, a new direction
 baad ke patrakaron ne uski technic ko apanaaya
 Stern's storytelling was amazing; Neither did he make anything very interesting
 bhashaa par prabhutv, vaktrutamayi vagmita ke saath-saath apane parivesh kaa bahut sookshm avlokan stern kii apni kshamtaayen or visheshtaayen hai
