 It is the peak of Mughal architecture

 The Mughals built the magnificent mausoleums, including the tomb of Humayun, Akbar's father, in Delhi, and the tomb of Akbar, Sikandra, located near Agra
 yah donon hi apane aap main bejod hai
 Under Jahangir the Hindu features vanished from the style; his great mosque at Lahore is in the Persian style, covered with enamelled tiles
 At Agra, the tomb of itmad-ud-daula completed in 1628, built entirely of white marble and covered wholly by pietra dura mosaic, is one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation anywhere to be found
 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for the agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India
 The most splendid of the Mogul tombs, and the most renowned building in India, is the Taj Mahal at Agra, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah jahan
the Moti Masjid in the Agra Fortand The Jama Masjid at Delhi are an imposing building, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts
 In his works Shah Jahan presents himself as the most magnificent builder of Indian sovereigns
 He also built the mausoleum and sections of the huge Lahore Fort that include the impressive Moti Masjid, Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha pavilion which are all enclosed in the fort
 He also built a mosque after himself in Thatta called Shahjahan Mosque
 Another mosque was built during his tenture in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor
 The Taj Mahal, the "teardrop on eternity", was completed in 1648 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to his 14th child
 The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire
 The Taj Mahal is completely symmetric other than the sarcophagus of Shah Jahan, which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor
 This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red sandstone, to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure
 The Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Shalimar Garden in Lahore, Pakistan, are two sites which are on the world heritage list of UNESCO
 One can see the architectural similarities and the love for water that the Mughals expressed in many of their buildings
 The Taj is considered to be one of the most beautiful monuments of love and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, when it comes to tourism
 In Aurangzeb's reign squared stone and marble gave way to brick or rubble with stucco ornament
 Srirangapatna and Lucknow have examples of later indo-muslim architecture
 He also added his mark to the Lahore Fort and built one the largest mosques in the city, called Badshahi Mosque
 He also built one of the thirteen gates, and it was later named after him, Alamgir

 This Jyotirlinga is a Siddhapeeth
 kaha jaataa he ki yahan par aane waalon kii sari manokamanaayen purna hoti hai
 For this reason this penis is also called "kamna Ling"
 is ling kii sthapana kaa itihaas yah he ki ek baar rakshasraj ravan ne himalay par jaakar shivaji kii prasannataa ke liye ghor tapasya kii or apane sir kaat-katkar shivlinga par chadhaane shuru kar diye
 After offering nine heads one by one, even the tenth head was to be cut off that Shiva appeared pleased
 unhone uske dason sir jyon-ke-tyon kar diye or usase vardaan maangane ko kaha
 Ravana went to Lanka and asked for the order to take him to establish that gender
 shivaji ne anumati to de di, par is chetavanee ke saath di ki yadi maarg main ise prithvi par rakh degaa to vah vahiin achal ho jayega
 Ultimately the same thing happened
 ravan shivlinga lekar chalaa par maarg main ek chitabhumi aane par use laghushanka nivritti kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Ravana took that gender to a Ahir and went to retirement
 idhar us ahir se use bahut adhik baari anubhav kar bhoomi par rakh diya
 What was then, Ravana could not uproot him even after returning full force and disappointed, went to Lanka by thumbing his thumb on the idol
 idhar brahma, vishnu aadi devataaon ne aakar us shivlinga kii puja kii
 As soon as Lord Shiva appeared, all the Gods and Goddess Shivalinga replaced him there and went back to heaven, praising Shiva

 Trishul is seen on the top of all Shiva temples of the world, but Shiva, Parvati, lakshmi-narayan and all other temples in the Vaidyanathdham complex have Panchshul on the top
 kaha jaataa he ki ravan panchashul se hi apane rajya lanka kii suraksha karata tha
 Since Vaidyanath had brought Ravana from Kailash to take Jyotirlinga to Lanka, but the creator had some other approval
 jyotirling le jane kii shartt yah thi ki bich main ise kahin nahin rakhana he magar dev yoga se ravan ko laghushanka kaa teevr veg asahansheel ho gaya or vah jyotirling ko bhagwaan ke badale hue charvaahe ke rup ko dekar laghushanka karne laga
