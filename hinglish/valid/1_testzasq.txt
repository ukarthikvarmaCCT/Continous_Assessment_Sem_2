 The compound meaning of the word astrology is lore related to planets and constellations
 is shabd se yadhyapi ganit jyotish kaa bhi bodh hota he, tathaapi saadhaaran log jyotish vidya se falit vidya kaa arth hi lete hai
 The colors of planets and stars have different types of colors, so the rays emanating from them also have different effects

 In this way, there is a difference of about 23 degrees between the Western calculation system and the Indian calculation system

 The scholars of Falit believe that this does not make any difference in the result, because scholars of different countries have studied the effects of planets and stars with their own calculation system for this learning

 Is derived from astrology or astrology, ie "study")
 It is the set of systems, practices and opinions through which the personality, matters related to man's life and other worldly subjects are understood and interpreted based on the comparative position of celestial bodies and other related details and organized information in this context
 Is done
 jyotish jaananevaale kojyotishi yaa ek bhavishyavaktaa kaha jaataa he
 'third millennium BC 
 From its earliest recorded writings to date, many practices and applications based on the principles of astrology have been executed
 samskruti, shuruuaati khagol vigyaan or anya vidyaon ko aakaar dene main isane mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Astrology and astronomy were often considered indistinguishable before the modern era
 bhavishya ke bare main jaananaa or divine gyaan kii prapti, khagoleey avlokan ke praathmik prerakon main se ek hai
 Since the end of the Renaissance to the end of the 18th century, astronomy began to slowly disintegrate
 faltah, khagol vigyaan ne khagoleey vastuon ke vaigyanik adhyayan or ek aise siddhant ke rup main apni ek pahchaan banaai jiskaa uski jyotishiya samaj se kuch lenaa dena nahin tha
 Astrologers believe that the movement and position of celestial bodies either directly affect the Earth or is somehow related to human scale or events experienced by humans
 aadhunik jyotishiyon dwaara jyotish ko ek pratikatmak bhashaa, ek kala ke rup main yaa bhavishyakathan, ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, jabaki bahut se vaigyanikon ne ise ek chhadam vigyaan yaa andhvishwaas kaa naam diya he
 Despite the difference in definitions, a general notion of astrology is that celestial bodies can help in understanding the events of the past and the present and the prophecy from their hierarchy
 ek matdaan main, 31% amirikiyon ne jyotish par apana vishwaas prakat kiya or ek anya adhyayan ke anusaar, 39% ne use vaigyanik mana he
 On the basis of astrology, the Shubhashubh fruit is specifically told about the position of the Grahanakshatras
 iske liye hamen sutron se ganit dwaara grah tathaa taron kii sthiti gyaat kerani padati he, athwa panchangon, yaa navik panchagon, se use gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The position of planets and constellations is variable every moment, so the impact of planets and constellations also have different types of events on every moment
 vaastavik grahasthiti gyaat karne ke liye ganit jyotish hi hamaara sahaayak he
 This results in a scientific basis for astrology
 kundali vah chakra he, jiske dwaara kisi isht kaal main raashichakr kii sthiti kaa gyaan hota he
 The zodiac is associated with the revolution cycle, whose position is not the same in different countries due to the difference in latitudes
 atev raashichakr kii sthiti jaanane ke liye sthaneey samay tathaa apane sthaan main honevaale raashiyon ke udai kii sthiti kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Our watches refer to the time of a certain post-sun sun
 isse saraniyon kii, jo panchagon main di rahati hai, sahaayta se hamen sthaneey spashtkaal gyaat karnaa hota he
 Local clarification is called ishtakal
 ishtkaal main jo raashi purv kshitij main hoti he use lagn kehete hai
 The lagna is known by the knowledge of the immediate clear sun and by the knowledge of the rise of local zodiac signs
 is prakaar raashichakr kii sthiti gyaat ho jaati he
 Lagna is also taken up in the Indian system
 paashchaatya pranali main lagn sayan liya jaataa he
 In addition, they also know the zodiacal meridians
 bhartiya pranali main lagn jis raashi main hota he use upar kii ore likhakar shesh raashiyon ko vamavart se likh dete hai
 The lagna is imagined as the first house and then the zodiac as the second house etc
 1 The number of expressions is known by the position in their horoscope
 raashiyon kaa ankon dwaara tathaa grahon ko unke aadyaksharon se vyakt kar dete hai
 The zodiac of this type is called horoscope
 bhartiya paddati main jo saat grah maane jate hai, ve hai surya, chandra, mangal aadi
 Apart from this, there are also two Tamo planets, which are called Rahu and Ketu
 rahu ko sadaa krantivrutt tathaa chandrakaksha ke arohpaat par tathaa ketu kaa avarohpaat par sthit maanate hai
 According to the sentiment, or with which the lord is situated, their fruit changes
 swabhaavat: tamograh hone ke kaaran inkaa fal ashubh hota he
 In Western system Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces have the following signs respectively
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The following signs for the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Guru, Saturn, Varuni, Varuna, and Yama respectively: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 And are used for the sun and the moon
 bhaavon kii sthiti ankon se vyakt kii jaati he
 By writing a clear lagna as the prepoint, from there, we write expressions in three parts equal to the quadrant
 grah jin raashiyon main ho un raashiyon main likh dete hai
 This is how a horoscope is called, which in English is called a horoscope
 europe main, bhartiya saat grahon ke atirikt, vaaruni, varun tathaa yama ke prabhaav kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai
 One has to study the nature of zodiac signs to know the fruit
 kundali ke vibhinn bhaavon se hamaare jivan se sambandh rakhanevaali vibhinn baton kaa pataa chalata he, jaise pratham bhav se sharir sambandhi, duusare bhav se dhan sambandhi aadi
 The lord of whatever zodiac sign is the lord of that house
 ek grah rashichkr par vibhinn prakaar se kirane phenkata he
 Therefore, the sight of the planet in the horoscope is also considered more or less complete
 grah jis grah sthaan par atyadhik prabhaav rakhata he use ucch tathaa usase saatven bhav ko uskaa neech kehete hai
 The planets are sometimes not visible to us from the Sun; Then they are called established
 isi prakaar vibhinn sthitiyon main grahon ke prabhaav ke anusaar unhen bal, yuva tathaa vruddh kehete he
 Other planets of the planets are friends or enemies due to their similarity or opposition to nature
 atev falit ke liye grahon ke balaabal ko janaa jaataa he
 The planet which is young, situated in its place or high and has a Yut or vision from its friends, has a lot of influence
 isi prakaar vah bhav jo apane swami se yut athwa drusht ho or jisamen shubh grah hon, purna fal detaa he
 In this way, the strength of planets, their position and other planets are also considered
 iske saath paristhitiyon tathaa manushya kii dasha kaa bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 For all these reasons, it is very difficult to tell the result
 jo log ganit jyotish ke gyaan ke bina fal bataate hai, ve thik nahin bataa sakate
 Since most astrologers are found to be like this, some people are beginning to doubt the scientificness of this science
 hamaare jivan ke upar sabase adhik surya tathaa chandramaa kaa prabhaav padataa he, atev paashchaatya deshon main suryasthit raashi tathaa chandrasthit raashi ko vishesh mahatv dete hai
 The Sun is reflective of the stable tendencies of the heart and the Moon's perceptual movements
 atev bharat main chandrakundali ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Even in Western countries, people are promoting this ideology
 chunki surya athwa chandra ek raashi main bahut samay tak rahete hai, at: inaki kundaliyon se vibhinn vyaktiyon par honevaale prabhaav kaa thik adhyayan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The apparent lagna changes quickly, so the ascendant is considered to be the actual horoscope of the person
 sookshm fal ke liye hora, dreshkan, navansh kundaliyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The time and duration of giving special results of planets is also fixed
 chandranakshetra kaa vyateet tathaa sampurna bhogyakaal gyaat hone se grahadasha gyaat ho jaati he
 The planets exert their auspicious effects especially in their condition
 kisi grah kii dasha main anya grah bhi apana prabhaav dikhalaate hai
 This is called the inlet of those planets
 isi prakaar grahon kii antar, pratyantar dashaayen bhi hoti he
 From the mutual positions of the planets, a yoga is formed which has special fruit
 vah fal kis samay praapt hoga, iskaa nirnay grahon kii dasha se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Vinshottari Mahadasha is mainly used in the Indian system
 iske anusaar prayek manushya kii aayu 120 varsh kii maanakar grahon kaa prabhaav bataaya jaataa he
 There are many branches of astrology
 paashchaatya jyotish main inaki sankhya chah he: In Indian astrology, only the Jataka and Samhita are the two main branches
 paashchaatya jyotish kii, tathaa shakhaon kaa jataka main tathaa shesh teen kaa samhita jyotish main antarbhaav ho jaataa he
 Rahu and Ketu are not real houses, they have been observed as Shadow
 grahon ki aapasi mitrataa-shatruta is prakaar he
 If 360 ° is divided by 12, then a sum is 30 °
 yadi 360° ko 27 se vibhajit kiya jaae to ek nakshatra 13°20' kaa hota he, arthath ek raashi me sava-do nakshatra hote he
 Since ancient times, deep belief in astrology was prevalent, which is also contained in the essence of Hermetic Maxim's words "as above, as below"
 tiko brahe ne jyotish par apane adhyayan main ek samaan saransh diya he: "saspisiando despisiyo", upar dekhakar bhi main niche dekhtaa hoon"
 haalanki, yah siddhant jiske anusaar swarg main ghatit ghatnaon kaa pratibimb prithvi par bhi awalokit hota he, duniya bhar main bahut si jyotish paramparaon kaa hissaa he, pashchim main aitihaasik rup se jyotish ke peeche kaam karne vaali kriyavali par jyotishiyon ke bich bahes hoti ai he
 There is also a dispute on whether the celestial bodies are just signs or are they foreshadowing events, or whether they actually conduct real events with some kind of power or mechanism
 bhale hi khagoleey yantriki or sthaliy gatiki ke bich sambandh sabase pehle isaac newton ke gurutvkarshan ke saarvbhaumik siddhant kii khoj se saamne aayaa, lekin khagoleey pindon kaa gurutvkarshan hi unke jyotish prabhaav ko janm detaa he yah baat kisi vaigyanik anusandhan dwaara nahin kahi gai, na hi kisi jyotish ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 Most astrological traditions are based on the relative position and motion of real or approximate celestial bodies, or on the astronomical patterns taken or included in an event at a time and place
 ye mukhyatah hai - jyotish grah, boune grah, kshudragrah, taaren, chandra aasandhi, arabi bhaag or kaalpanik grah 
 is prakaar kii ullekhneey abhaasi sthiti ko ushnkaribandheey yaa taramandal, ek ore se baarah chinhon ke raashichakr or duusari ore se sthaneey kshitij -avarohi aksh) or madhya-akashiya - imam koeli aksh ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This latter structure is uniquely divided into twelve astrological houses
 iske alaava, ye jyotish ke vibhinn pahalu jyamitiya / koniya or vibhinn khagoleey pindon or konon ke bich sambandh sthapit karata he
 Astrology's claim to predict future trends and events is based on two main methods, in Western astrology: astrological transit and astrological transits
 Astrological transit is interpreted based on the motion of the planets because of space and horoscope
 Their speed is important when passing through
 jyotish pragaman main janm kundali tay padyatiyon ke anusaar samay me aage kii ore babbti he
 Vedic astrology focuses on planetary periods to reach conclusions, while transit is used in important events related to time
 adhikansh pashchimi jyotishiyon ne bhi ghatnaon kaa purvanumaan lagaana chhod diya he, uske badale ve saamaanya pravritiyon or ghatnaon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 In comparison, Vedic astrology predicts both trends and events
 sanshaivadiyon ke anusaar pashchimi jyotishiyon kaa ye tarika pramaan yogya anumaan lagane se bachaata he or unhen mahatvapurn se swecchit or asambandhit ghatnaon kaa abhipraay apane suvidhanusaar bataane kaa samarthy detaa he
 In the past, astrology often relied on close observation of celestial bodies and their movement
 aadhunik jyotishi, khagolavidon ke dovara die hue aankaden jo kii ek khagoleey sarini affemerids ke rup main hote hai, jo khagoleey pindon kii samay ke saath badalati raashi chakra sthiti ko darshaati he
 Astrologers have many great traditions, some of which are characterized by the transmission of astrological principles and cultures, and other traditions evolved in isolation and their astrological principles are different, although they are also derived from the same astronomical source
 The reasons are some common features
 aadhunik jyotishiyon dwaara jin mukhya paramparaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, wo hai: Vedic and Western astrology are of the same lineage as the horoscope system of astrology, meditation in both traditions is the creation of an astrological table or horoscope, presentation of astronomical elements and knowledge of the position of the sun, moon and planets for information about an event
 However, Vedic astrology uses the nakshatra zodiac to combine the signs of the zodiac with the original nakshatras, while western astrology uses Hnktibndhiy amount using cycles
 vishuon ke purv nirnay ke kaaran, sadiyon baad, pashchimi jyotish ke baarah raashi chinhon kaa unke moulik nakshatron kii tarah akaash ke samaan bhaag se sambandh nahin rahaa
pravhav kii drushti se, pashchimi jyotish main chinhon or nakshatron ke bich sambandh tut gaya he, jabaki vaidic jyotish main abhi bhi iskaa sarvocch mahatv he
 Other differences between the two civilizations include the use of 27 nakshatras or lunar buildings that have been in use in India since the Vedic period and the system of planetary periods known as dasha
 chini jyotish main ek purnataya vibhin parampara kaa vikaas hua he
 In this, unlike the western and Indian astrology, the sky is divided by the celestial equator in place of the twelve zodiac signs
 chineeyon ne ek aisi pranali viksit kii jisamen har chinh din ke baarah 'dohare ghanton ' or saal ke baarah mahino se sambaddh mana jaataa tha
 Each sign of the zodiac governs different years and combines with the five element system of Chinese cosmology to give a 60 year cycle
 yahan yah shabd, chini jyotish suvidha ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, lekin korea, japan, vietnam, thailand or anya asian deshon main thik isi parampara ke sanskaran vidyaman hai
 In modern times, these traditions have come into greater contact with each other, noting that Indian and Chinese astrology are being promoted in the West, while Western astrology is still confined in Asia
 pashchimi duniya main jyotish vigyaan main aadhunik samay main kaafii vividhta ai he
 New movements have appeared that have rejected traditional astrology, focusing on different perspectives, such as overemphasizing the midpoints, or more psychological approaches
 Some recent Western developments: apane lambey itihaas ke dauraan, jyotish vigyaan ne kai kshetron main shoharat praapt kii or parivartan ke saath-saath isamen vikaas bhi hua
 There are many astrological traditions that have historical significance, but today they are of little use
 jyotishiyon kii unamem abhi bhi ruchi barkaraar he or ve use ek mahatvapurn sansaadhan ke rup main dekhte hai
 Historically important traditions of astrology include: pashchimi, chini or bhartiya jyotish ke itihaas kii charchaa itihaas ke mukhya lekhon main kii gai he
 Many Sufi or Gupta traditions have been associated with astrology
 kuch maamalon main, jaise kabbala main, jyotish ke apane paaramparik tatwon ko pratibhaagiyon dwaara ikkatha karke antarbhoot kiya jaataa he
 In other cases, such as in Agama Prophecy, many astrologers incorporate traditions into their work of astrology
 gupt paramparaayen main nimna- likhit chizein shaamil hai, lekin gupt paramparaayen itane tak hi simit nahin hai: According to history, alchemy in the Western world was particularly coherent and blended with the traditional babylonian-greek style of astrology; In many ways, they complement each other in finding occult or occult knowledge
 jyotish ne rasayan vidya kii chaar santhaapit tatwon kii avadharana kaa prachinkaal se lekar vartmaan samay tak upyog kiya he
 Traditionally, each of the seven planets of the solar system has its own dominion zone or dominion and occupies a fixed metal
 raashi chakra, nakshatron kaa ek gheraa yaa samooh he jiske madhyam se surya, chandramaa or grah akaash main pargaman karte hai
 Astrologers paid attention to these constellations and gave them some specific importance
 Over time, he created a system of twelve zodiac signs based on the characteristics of the twelve constellations
 Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces)
 The Western and Vedic zodiac signs have the same origin in the tradition of Kundalini astrology, so the two are similar to each other in many ways
 duusari ore china main, raashi chakra kaa alag tareeke se vikaas hua tha
 Although the Chinese also have a twelve-sign system, the Chinese zodiac refers to the pure almanac cycle, with no equivalent constellation associated with the Western and Indian zodiacs
 pashchimi jyotishiyon ke ek bade hisse ne akaash ko 30 ansh ke baarah baraabar khandon main baatane vaale ushnkaribandheey raashi chakra ko apane kaam kaa aadhaar banaaya jisaki shuruyaat mesh ke pehle bindu se hoti he, jahaan akashiya bumadhya rekha or krantivrutt, uttari golarddh ke valay vishuv par milte hai
 Due to the precession of the gods, the way the Earth rotates in space changes slowly, in this system the zodiac sign has no relation to the constellation with the same name, but rather they live in alignment of months and seasons
 vaidic jyotish kii parampara kaa paalan karne vaale or alp sankhya main yani kuch pashchimi jyotishi samaan nakshatra raashi chakra upyog karte hai
 This zodiac uses the same evenly divided revolution but remains roughly in line with the position of the constellations under consideration with the same name as the zodiac signs
 nakshatra raashi chakra ushnkaribandheey raashi chakra se ayanamsa kahi jane vaali duuri se baraabar duuri se alag he, jo kii vishuon ke jhukaav ke saath-saath aage badhata he
 In addition, some constellations use constellations of real, unequal zodiacs in their work
 jyotish gharon or grahon evam chinhon ke liye banaaai gayi shilp ke namoonay ko prardashit karne vaali The horoscope astrological system developed in the Mediterranean region, and particularly in the area around Hellenistic Egypt, in the second or early first century
 This tradition is related to the two-dimensional diagram of heaven or horoscope at a specific moment in time
 yah chitra vishesh niyamon or disha nirdeshon ke aadhaar par khagoleey pindon ke sanrekhan main chhipe arthon ko samajhane ke liye prayog main laaye jate hai
 a horoscope is usually calculated at the time of the birth of an individual or at the beginning of an enterprise or event, because the celestial alignment at that time is considered to be the determinant of the nature of the subjects we want to know about
 jyotish ke is rup kaa ek vishisht lakshan jo ise dusron se alag karata he wo he - pariksha ke vishisht kshan, jise anyathaa padhaan ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 But in front of the backdrop of the eclipse, calculating the increasing degree of the eastern horizon
 Horoscope of horoscopes is the most influential form of astrology spread across the world, especially in Africa, India, Europe and the Middle East and in the Indian, Middle and Modern West
 Many of the main practices of horoscope, including astrology, originate from Hellenistic traditions
 kundalini jyotish kaa kendra or uski shakhaaen, kundali yaa jyotish ke lekhachitr kii gananaa he
 This two-dimensional drawing representation shows the virtual position of celestial bodies in heaven, with the position on earth, at a given time and place
 kundali bhi baarah vibhinn khagoleey grihon main vibhajit hai jo jivan ke vibhinn kshetron kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 The calculations in the horoscope involve mathematics and simple geometry based on the apparent position of the heavenly bodies and the astronomical table of time
 pracheen helenistic jyotish main aaroh kundali ke pehle akashiya grih ko parilakshith karata tha
 In Greek, the word horoscopos was used for mounts, which led to the term horoscope
 In modern times, the term refers to astrological accounts
 kundali jyotish kii paramparaon ko chaar shakhaon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jo kii vishisht vishyon yaa uddeshyon kii ore nirdisht hai
 Often, these branches use a set of unique techniques or different experiments of the fundamentals of the system for a different area
 jyotish ke kai anya up-samucchyon or prayogon kaa armbh chaar moulik shakhaon se hua he
 Trace Riches Huares from Duck d Berry jyotish ke jo siddhant baad main asia, europeor madhya purv main viksit hue unka varnan pracheen babil main bhi he or khagoleey chinhon kii unki pranali duusari sahasrabdi isa purv ke madhya main sankalit kii gai
 Later this system of astronomical signs spread directly or indirectly from Babylon to India, the Middle East and Egypt, where it merged with the pre-existing indigenous forms of astrology
 babil kii jyotish misr main armbh main chauthi shatabbdi ke madhya isa purv main ai thi or duusari or pehali shatabbdi ke shuruyaat main ailekjendria kii vijay ke baad, yah babil jyotish, mistra sabhyataa ke dakshini jyotish se mishrit ho gai or kundali jyotish kaa nirmaan kiya
 The origin of this new form of astrology is believed to be of Alexandria Egypt, soon it spread to Europe, Middle East and India in the ancient world
 khagol vigyaan or jyotish ke bich antar jagah jagah par alag he, ve dridhtaa se pracheen bharat, pracheen babil or madhyakaalin europe se judi hui he, lekin helenistic duniya se ek had tak alag he
 The first semantic difference between astrology and astronomy was given in the 11th century by the Persian astronomer abu-rehan-al-biruni
 dekhen)

 adhdhayan jyotish anumaan or kaaryakari tareeke se nikaale gaye parinamo ke bich sankhyikeey mahatv se sambandh sthapit karne main baar baar asafal rahe hai

 Another argument given by astrologers is that most studies of astrology do not reflect the nature of astrology practice and the scientific method does not apply to astrology

 Some astrologers, on the other hand, believe that astrology is subject to scientific method if sufficient sophisticated analytical methods are used, and to support their view, they also undertake many pioneering studies in this field
 As a result, many astrologers have Advised to continue the study of astrology based on statistical verification

 superman riterns 2006 kii ek america superhiro film he, jiske nirmaataa or nirdeshak bryan singer hai
 The film, based on the DC Comics character Superman, is a homage-sequel to the 1978 series of Superman and 1980's Superman II, though it ignores the events that followed in the films Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace

 hindi shabdhsagar hindi bhashaa ke liye banaaya gaya ek brihat shabd-sangrah tathaa pratham maanak kosh he
 'hindi Shabdasagar' was built by the Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Kashi
 iskaa pratham prakaashan 1922-1929 ke bich hua
 This scientific and methodical dictionary was originally composed in four sections
 iske pradhan sampadak shyamsundar das the tathaa baalkrishna bhatta, lala bhagavanadin, amir singh evam jaganmohan verma sahasampadak the
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Acharya Ramchandra Varma also contributed best in this great work
 isamen lagbhag ek lakh shabd the
 Later, between 1965–1976, its revised edition was published in 11 volumes
 dow shyamsundar das ke netritv main or acharya ramchandra shakl jaise marmajna aalochak or hidi sahityavijna ke sahaayakatv main tathaa baalkrishna bhatta shri amir sih, shri jaganmohan verma shri bhagavanadin or shri ramchandra varm ke sampadakatv main anek vidwaanon, kaaryakartaaon ke sahyog se sampadit or nirmit yah kosh ek mahaan prayaas tha
 In the editing of this Mahakosh with the consideration of means and circumstances, the masters of the assembly and the activists of the dictionary got great success
 isaki kuch uplabdhiyaan he jo stuty or abhinandaneey hai
 It can also be said that this Mahakosh was the staple and base of all the small and large shells of the Hidi, which became interchangeable with the Hindi word
 hindi koshkala ke labdhpratishth sampadak shri ramchandra verma ke is prashansaneey kaary kaa upjivy bhi mukhyatah hindi shabdhsagar hi he
 Its original form is mostly calculated from the words in the form of elemental
 hindi ke anya koshon main bhi adhikansh saamagree isi kosh se lee gai he
 Like most of the earlier Hindi dictionaries, the Hindi word ocean was not created by one person but was created by many suddis penetrating language and literature
 shabdasankalan ke liye keval puraane koshon kaa hi aadhaar na lekar granthon or vyavhaaryukt bhashaa or boliyon ke praayah samast uplabdh saamaanya or vishesh shabdon ke sangrah kaa usame prayaas hua
 Often attempting to see the original source of each word, along with trying to direct various linguistic sources

 a very mature appropriation of grammatical system and systematic instruction of words and meanings is seen in the Hindi dictionary
 paryaay-nirdesan par jahaan ek ore sanskrit koshon kaa vyapak prabhaav he or praayah adhikadhik yogic pado kaa ullekh bhi sanskrit vyakaran par adhiktah aadhaarit he vahaan duusari ore hindi kii prakruti or prayog-parampara kaa akalan or sankalan bhi bade ytn or manoyog ke saath kiya gaya he
 Interpretation of the meanings from the idiom and proverbs of Hindi idioms and proverbs or the use of rituals is also sufficiently mature in this
 shabdhsagar main arthnirdhaaran main vyaakhyaatmak paddati apanaai gai he
 But at the same time most synonyms have also been placed under the key words
 is kaaran kabhi kabhi aisa bhi lagata he ki yah kosh aadhunik dhang kaa paryaayavachi or nanarthak kosh ek saath ban gaya he
 Under the explanatory method, many types of introduction and description of the person, subject, object, etc
, mythological, historical, classical and traditional, are given in place
 is kaaran yah kosh vishwakosh, gyaanakosh, charitkosh or paribhaashik kosh ke parivesh kaa bhi yatra-tatra sparsh karata dekhai detaa he
 Some deficiencies can also be counted in this
 shabdon ke samast arthon kii prayogpushti or pramanikta ke nimit sarvatra udhaaharan nahin hai
 Wherever they are, nominal texts are often specified
 unek prasangsthal or sanskaran kaa ullekh nahin he
 Self-made examples of colloquialism have also been employed at many sites
 sab milakar isamen shabdasangrah or arthvivruti donon kii paridhi ko yathasambhav vyapak or vistrut banaaya gaya he
 In this area, the importance of this dictionary has increased greatly due to the combination of vocabulary stored with various professions and class life
 bait al-hikma yaa to baghdad main ek pramukh abbasia saarvajanik academy or bauddhik centre yaa islamic swarna yug ke dauraan abbasi khilaafat se sambandhit ek badi nijee pustkaalay ko sanderbhit karata he
 The House of Wisdom is called an active and famous center on its functions and existence as a formal academy
 abbasia kilaafat ke patan ke baad bhautik sakshya kii kami or saahitiyik kii pushti par nirbharta ke kaaran jatil samasya ko jhujhata bhi rahaa
 This House was established as a Hikmat house during the late 8th century Khalifa Harun al Rashid and later became a public academy in the reign of Al Mamun or rare in both Arabic and Persian by ar-mansur a private collection was created to store books and poetry collections
 bhale hi, abbasid yug ke dauraan hone vaale pramukh anuwaad andolan ke hisse ke rup main astitv main thi, greek or arabi se farsi granthon or vaigyanik kitabon kaa anuwaad karte hue, apana astitv qaayam kar liya tha
 But it is unlikely that Bait al-hikma is the first house to be built, the center of such work being the major establishment of the proposed translation of the House, a major translation effort in Cairo and Damascus
 is anuwaad andolan ne islamic duniya main hone vaale mul shodh ke ek bade saude ke liye gati pradaan kii, jisamen "buksahelf thisis" ke virodh main farsi, bhartiya or greek sroton ke granthon tak pahunch thi, jo islamic vidwaanon ke yogadan ko kam kar detaa he greek granthon ke anuwaad or sangrakshan ke liye yah sadan kaa yogadan tha
 Because of the city's status as the capital of the khilafat-e-abbasia, the establishment of the House of Knowledge was made possible in Baghdad by the continuous influx of Persian, Arab, and other scholars from the Islamic world
 yah 8 veen or 13 veen sadi ke bich baghdad main adhyayan karne vaale badi sankhya main vidwaanon dwaara pramanit he, jaise al-jahiz, al-kindi or al-gajali jaise mahamahim ne apana yogadan pradaan kiya
 Despite the existence of a formal academy, the vibrant academic community in Baghdad produced a large proportion of notable works
 jin kshetron main vidwaan house ke saath jude vidwaanon ne yogadan diya, lekin darshan, ganit, chikitsa, khagol vigyaan or prakaashiki tak hi simit nahin he
 The library's initial name, Khazat al-hima, derives from its function as a place for the preservation of rare books and poetry, the primary function of the House to wit until its destruction
 gyaan kaa sadan or isaki saamagree baghdad kii gheraabandi main nasht ho gai thi, jo buddhi ke sadan ke puratathvik sakshya ke raste main bahut kam thi, jaise ki iske bare main adhiktar gyaan yug ke samakaleen vidwaanon ke kaaryon se liya gaya he jaise al-tabari or ebn al-nadeem 
 During the fourth to 7th century, scholarly work in the Greek and Syriac languages was either taken from the Neolithic period, or was commissioned
 shastreey gyaan ke seekhney or sancharan ke kendron main skool of nisibis or baad main skool of edsa, or jundishpur ke prasiddh aspataal or chikitsa academy shaamil the; pustakaalayon main alexandria pustkaalay or constantinopel kii imperial librari shaamil thi; or marv, selonika, nishapur or kittephone centre shaamil the
 Through the Umayyad era founded by Khalifa Muawiya I, he began collecting a collection of books in Damascus
 uske baad unhone ek pustkaalay banaaya jise "bet al-hikma" ke naam se sanderbhit kiya tha
 Books written in Greek, Latin and Persian were also collected by Muslim scholars at that time in the fields of Vaidya, Alchemy, Physics, Mathematics, Astrology and other subjects
 ullekhneey rup se, umayyad ne china se kagaz banane kii takanic ko bhi viniyamit kiya or apane shashan ke tahat kai pracheen bauddhik kendron main shaamil kiya
 And employed both Christian and Persian scholars for translation works in Arabic, and governed to develop new knowledge
 ye moulik tatv the jo arab duniya main chaatravrutti ke vikaas main sidhe yogadan dete the
 In 750, the Abbasid dynasty replaced the Umayyad as the ruling dynasty of the Islamic Empire, and in 762, the Caliph al-mansur built Baghdad and made it his capital instead of Damascus
 baghdad ke sthaan or vishwavyaapee aabaadi ne ek sthir vanijyik or bauddhik centre ke liye ek adarsh sthaan banaaya
 The Abbasid dynasty had a strong Persian bent, and adopted many practices from the Sasanian Empire - among them, in addition to translating foreign works, the texts were now translated into Arabic
 is uddeshy ke liye, al-mansoor ne ek mahal pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, jise sasainian imperial librari ke baad banaaya gaya, or vahaan kaam kar rahe bauddhikon ko aarthik or raajnneetik samarthan pradaan kiya gaya
 He also invited scholarly delegations from India and other places to share his knowledge of mathematics and astronomy with the young Abbasid court
 abbasid samrajya main, unani, chini, sanskrit, farsi or siriek se arabi main kai videshi kaaryon kaa anuwaad kiya gaya tha
 The translation movement gained great momentum during the reign of the Caliph al-rashid, who, like his predecessor, was personally interested in scholarship and poetry
 mul rup se sambandhit granth mukhya rup se dawa, ganit or khagol vigyaan; lekin, anya vishyon, vishesh rup se darshan, jald hi paalan kiya
 al-rashid's library, the direct predecessor of the House of Wisdom, was also known as Bayt al-himma, or as the historian al-quifti called it Khazanat Qutb al-hikma
 caliph al-mamoon ke praayojan ke tahat, saamaanya rup se budhimaani or chaatravrutti ke aarthik samarthan main kaaphi vruddhi hui thi
 In addition, the Abbasid society itself was also capable of understanding and appreciating the value of knowledge, and support from merchants and the military
 vidwaanon or anuvaadakon ko jivanadhar or pravriti ko zindaa rakhane kaa bhi moqa is academy dene kaa pratik ban gaaya
 Wisdom was so valuable that books and ancient texts were sometimes preferred as war spoils rather than other riches
 darasal, tolmi ke almaguest ko abbasids or bijantin samrajya ke bich yuddh ke baad shanti ke liye ek shart ke rup main daawa kiya gaya tha
 The intelligent gathering was more than an academic center removed from the wider society
 iske visheshgyon ne baghdad main kai kaaryon kii seva kii
 The scholars of Bayt al-himma usually double as engineers and architects in major construction projects
 unhone sateek aadhikarik calendar banaae or saarvajanik naukar the
 He was also often a physician and consultant
 al-mamun vyaktigat rup se house of visdem ke dainik jivan main shaamil the, niyamit rup se apane vidwaanon kaa daura karte the or unki gatividhiyon ke bare main poochhate the
 He will also participate in and mediate academic debates

 Kalam is leading a philosophical debate al-mamun from his Persian teacher, Jafar

 In addition, he would often organize groups of saints from Bayt al-hima in major research projects to meet his intellectual needs
 udhaaharan ke liye, unhone duniya ke maanchitran ko chaalu kiya, almaguest se data kii pushti or prithvi ke vaastavik aakaar kii katautee 
 He also promoted Egyptology and participated in the excavation of the Pyramids of Giza

 Science is his legacy and he is known as the first person to fund 'big science'
 apane purvavartiyon ke baad, al-mamun videshi bhoomi se granthon ko ikattha karne ke liye vidwaan ke sadan se vidwaanon ke abhiyaan bhej denge
 In fact, one of the directors of the House was sent to Constantinople with this purpose
 is samay ke dauraan, ek farsi kavi or jyotishi saahal ebn haaron, bet al-himama ke mukhya pustkaalay the
 Hunain ibn Ishaq was an Arab Nestorian Christian physician and scientist, the most productive translator producing 116 works for the Arabs

 al-ma'mun established the House of Wisdom, charging Hunain ibn Ishaq, who then became the most celebrated translator of Greek texts
 "anuvaadakon ke shaikh" ke rup main unhen khalif dwaara anuwaad kaaryon ke prabharee rakhaa gaya tha
 Hunain ibn Ishaq translated the entire collection of Greek medical books, including famous pieces by Galen and Hippocrates
 sabian thabit ebn kurra ne apollonius, archimedes, euclid or tolmi dwaara bhi mahaan kaaryon kaa anuwaad kiya
 The translations of this era were better than before, as the new Abbasid scientific tradition required better and better translations, and the incorporation of new ideas to translate ancient works was emphasized many times
 nauveen shatabdi ke duusare chamahi tak al-mamun kii bet al-hima duniya kii kitabon kaa sabase bada bhandar tha or madhya yug main bauddhik gatividhi ke sabase bade kendron main se ek ban gaya tha, sabase shandaar arab or farsi dimag
 The House of Knowledge eventually acquired a reputation as a center of learning, although the universities as we know it did not exist yet - knowledge was passed directly from teacher to student, without any institutionalization
 makkabs jald hi 9veen shatabdi se shahar main viksit hona shuru kar diya, or 11 veen shatabdi main, nizaam al -mulak ne iraq main ucch shiksha ke pehle sansthaanon main se ek baghdad ke al-nizamiya kii sthapana kii
 The House of Knowledge progressed under al-mammoon's successor, al-mutasim and his son al-wathiq
 lekin al-mutavakkil ke shasankaal main kaaphi giravat ai 
 Although al-mamoon, al-mutasim and al-wathiq followed the sect of Mutazili, which supported mind-pervasiveness and scientific inquiry, al-mutawakkil supported a more literal interpretation of the Quran and also the hadith
 caliph ko vigyaan main ruchi nahin thi or unani darshan ke prasar ko islamic ke rup main failaate hue, tarkwaad se dur chale gaye
 On February 13, the Mongols entered the city, carrying out the Caliphate and the entire city for a whole week

 He also researched and studied alchemy, which was later used to structure modern chemistry
 iske alaava, isse judaa hua khagoleey vedhashalaayein or anya pramukh prayogtmak prayaas bhi the
 Institutionalized by al-ma'mun, the academy encouraged the transcription of Greek philosophical and scientific endeavors
 iske atirikt, unhone mahatvapurn granthon kii pandulipiyon ko aayaat kiya jo ki bijantium se pustkaalay tak islamic deshon tak pahunch yogya nahin the
 The House of Wisdom was much more than a library, and a considerable amount of original scientific and philosophical work was produced by scholars and intellectuals concerned with it
 isane muslim vidwaanon ko pichley vidwaanon se di gai khagoleey jaankaree kii pushti karne kii anumati di
 The translation movement began in the wisdom of this House and lasted for more than two centuries
 saadhe saadhe saalon se, mukhya rup se madhya purvi oriental siriek isai vidwaanon ne sabhi vaigyanik or darshanik unani granthon kaa anuwaad house of visdem main arabi bhashaa main kiya
 The translation movement in the House of Wisdom was inaugurated with a translation of Aristotle's themes
 al-mamun ke samay tak, anuvadak unani jyotishiya granthon se aage chale gaye the, or greek kaam pehle se hi unke tisare anuwaad main the
 Translators include translations: Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta
 is andolan ke dauraan kai mahatvapurn granthon kaa anuwaad kiya gaya tha jisamen aushadhiy dawaaon kii rachana, is mishran par ek pustak or saral dawaaon ke gun, or dysordis dwaara chikitsa maamalon par ek pustak shaamil he
 These plus many more translations helped with advances in medicine, agriculture, finance and engineering
 iske alaava, nai khojon ne pracheen lekhakon ke kaam ko sanshodhit yaa sanshodhit sanshodhit anuwaad or tippanee ko prerit kiya
 In many cases the name and terminology were changed; a prime example of this is the title of Ptolemy's Almagest, an Arabic modification of the original name of the work: Megale Syntaxis
 unke pehle ke kaaryon or unke bare main unki tippaniyon ke anuwaad ke alaava, bet al-hikma main vidwaanon ne mahatvapurn mul shodh prastut kiya
 For example, the notable mathematician al-khwarizmi worked in the house of a scholar of al-mamun and is noted for his contribution to the development of algebra
 mohammad ebn musa al-khwarijmi kaa janm 780 ke aasapaas hua tha or 850 ke aasapaas mrityu ho gai thi
 He was known as a mathematician and an astronomer in the house of intelligence
 vah apni pustak kitaab al-jabar ke liye bhi jane jate hai jisamen unhone kai elgoridam viksit kiye hai
 The use of the term "algebra" for mathematics and the etymology of the term "algorithm" can be traced back to al-khwarizmi - the actual concept of an algorithm before Euclid's time
 shabd 'bijganit' al-khwarijmi ke naam ke latin sanskaran se liya gaya he jo 'elgoridamas' he
 He was instrumental in introducing Arabs into Hindu numerals and algebra, hence he is known as the 'father of algebra'
 
 iske atirikt, al-khwarijmi ne tolemi ke jyamitiya model par estrolbe, sandial or vistaar se likhaa
 al-khwarizmi is also known as the first geographer of Islam with an earth portrait of his famous figure
 prithvi kii tasviir main, unhone us samay duniya ke saikadon shaharon ke nirdeshaank kii vyavastha kii or duniya ke ek nae maanchitr ko aakarshith karne ke nirdesh die
 George Sarton, the most famous historian of science, is known for his introduction to science known for his book, the period between 800 and 850, called 'al-khwarizmi'
 
 Furthermore, this mathematician is responsible for the introduction of the Hindu decimal system in the Arab world, and through them in Europe
 al-kindi dwaara kriptnalisis main bhi mahatvapurn safaltaaen thim
 In al-khwarizmi's early career, he proposed ideas towards Hindu astronomical tables called Sindindas
 natijatan, khalif al-mamun ne al-khwarijmi ko samikarnon ke vigyaan par kaam karne kii maang kii
 Abu Yusuf Yakub ibn Ishaq al-kindi was also another historical figure who worked in the House of Saud
 unhone kriptnalisis kaa adhyayan kiya lekin vah ek mahaan ganitagya bhi the
 al-kindi is most famous for being the first to introduce Aristotle's philosophy to Arabic people
 unhone aristotl ke darshan ko islamic dharamshastra ke saath joda jisane darshanikon or dharmavidon ke liye 400 varshon se bahes karne ke liye bauddhik manch banaaya
 a fellow expert on Aristotle was an East African dynasty named Abu Uthman al-zahith, who was born around 776 in Basra, but spent most of his life in Baghdad
 al-mamun ne al-jahith ko apane bacchon ke liye ek nijee shikshak ke rup main niyukt kiya, lekin unhen 'goglade-oid' kii vajah se al-jahith ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 He has a wide, wide-eyed eye that makes him scary to look at
 al-jahith kuch muslim vidwaanon main se ek the jo jeevigyaan ke saath baari rup se shaamil the
 He wrote book books, and it talks about the friendly way around animals that is similar to the history of Aristotle's history
 apni pustak main, al-jahith ne tark diya ki kute, lomadee or bhediye jaise jaanwaron ko ek aam purvajon se utarana chahie kyonki unhone samaan pairon, fer, poonch, aadi jaise samaan visheshtaon or visheshtaon ko saajha kiya tha
 Musa ibn Shakir was an astrologer, and a friend of al-mamun, son of the Caliph Harun al-rashid
 unke beton ko samuhik rup se banu musa ke rup main janaa jaataa he, unhone ganit or jyotish ke vyapak gyaan ke saath bhi yogadan diya
 When his father died, al-ma'mun became his guardian
 813 or 833 ke bich, teen bhai vigyaan, ejineering or sangrakshan main unke kaaryon main safal rahe
 Abu Jafar, Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Shakir, Abu al-qasim, Ahmad ibn Musa ibn Shakir and al-isan ibn Musa ibn Shakir are widely known for their Book of Ingenious Devices, which describes about a hundred devices

 The rule of the market is that if a commodity is bought in large quantities, then it has to pay a low price
 That is, due to being joint, any item has to be bought in a relatively high quantity, so it is cheaper to buy a large quantity
 Due to different things, many items have to be bought separately, while being joint, work is done with less items
 For example, a family has three single families
 They will have to buy three houses, three cars or three scooters, three televisions, and three fridges, etc
 each item separately
 But if they live together, they will have to buy a small amount of money to save money
 Like a car, a scooter can work in place of three scooters, a big fridge and an a 
C can be replaced in place of three scooters
 Similarly, with three houses but one complete Or a large bungalow can be equipped

 At the time of a disaster, if a family member is seriously ill, it can be easily overcome with the support of the whole family

 The ongoing liberation struggle between the influential Bengali people established in East Pakistan and the multi-caste Pakistanis settled in the four provinces of Pakistan sparked the indo-pakistani War

 At the same time religious and ethnic disputes also arose between Bengalis and multi-ethnic Pakistanis, as Bengalis were very different from those influential West Pakistanis
 :24–25 In the general elections held in 1970, the Awami League of East Pakistan got 167 seats out of the 169 seats in the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly resulting in an almost absolute majority in the 313-seat National Assembly, while West Pakistan's vote-bank Conservative Pakistan Muslim League And the Samajwadi Pakistan was divided into the People's Party, and the then-communist Awami National Party

 : 295 Major General Rao Farman Ali wrote in his daily diary: "we will make the green land of East Pakistan bleed

 On 27 March 1971, the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave full support of her government for the liberation struggle of East Pakistan and said that it is better to give refuge to millions of refugees in India than to fight against Pakistan and end this struggle

 The attitude of the Pakistani media was also becoming increasingly war-loving and militaristic against East Pakistan and India
 haalanki kuch pakistani media vidwaanon kii bhashaa in purv kii gatividhiyon kii riopirt dete hue, mili-juli bhi dikhaai detii thi
 By the end of September 1971, an organized publicity campaign had started, possibly with the support of the internal components of the Government of Pakistan, which resulted in stickers carrying messages like Crush India etc
 being put on the back of vehicles
 ye abhiyaan rawalpindi, islamabad evam lahore se armbh hote hue sheeghra hi puure pashchimi pakistan main failataa chalaa gaya

 By the end of April 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had discussed with Indian Army Chief Sam Manekshaw about India's readiness to wage war with Pakistan

 In fact, Indira Gandhi was aware of the consequences of the hasty military action, but she also wanted to know the thoughts of her army, so that she could answer to many of her cabinet colleagues, and also pacify the mass community which India Were very important to support the decision to exercise restraint at that time

 In response to this, India started to build large-scale Indian army troops along its western borders, but they waited peacefully till December, so that after the monsoon rains, the land would dry up and help the expedition and snow in the Himalayan passes

 These pre-emptive attacks, also called Operation Genghis Khan, were inspired by Operation Focus's victory in Israel's arab-israeli six-day War, but a large number of Israeli fighters on Arab Air Force bases in that 1967 war
 Airplanes were dispatched, while Pakistan sent less than 50 aircraft
 :82 In the same evening, in a message to the nation, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said that these air strikes are a declaration of war on India from Pakistan and on the same night, the Indian Air Force also took the first counter-action
 agle din hi in javaabi hamalon ko vrahat str ke hawaii akraman main badal diya gaya
 With this, the indo-pak war of 1971 officially started and Indira Gandhi ordered the troops to march towards the border and started attacking Pakistan on a full scale

 : 333 The main objective of this campaign of India was to take control of Dhaka on the eastern front and to prevent Pakistan from entering the Indian land on the western front
 There was no Indian intention of conducting any major offensive into Pakistan to dismember it into different states
 Unlike the previous 1965 war, this time Pakistan was not ready for a naval encounter with India
