 In topographical science, there is a point on the top which is higher than all the other points around it
 ganitiya rup se shikhar unnayan kaa sthaneey adhiktam he
 In topographical terms, "peak", "top", "peak", "altitude" and "meridians" are synonyms
 ] First, the purely scientific theory was propounded by the famous English scientist Newton
 isamen yah mana gaya tha ki pradipt vastu main se prakaash atyant sookshm evam tivrgami kanikaon ke rup main nikalataa he
 These corpuscles are not of ordinary substance, because they do not carry any weight at all
 vibhinn rangon ke prakaash kii kanikaon main bhed keval unke vistaar kaa hota he : laal prakaash kii kanikas badi hoti hai or bangnee kii choti
 Through this hypothesis, the transmission of energy by light, movement in zero light, simple line movement etc
 are clearly understood, because these phenomena are well-established kinetic rules of Newton itself
 in kanikaon ko purnat: pratyaasthi maan lene se unheen niyamon se paravartan ke mukhya niyam kii bhi saral vyakhya ho jaati he, kintu ek padaarth se duusare main pravesh karte samay prakashakirnon ke mudane kii vyakhya ke liye yah pariklpana banani padi ki donon padaartho ke parthakytal ke nikatavarti pradesh main or uski abhilamb disha main kanika par kuch bal lagata he
 When this force is the attraction force, then the normal component of the corpuscle increases and the beam turns towards the normal, as when moving from air to water and when the retorting force is applied, the beam turns in the opposite direction, ie from water On the way to air
 isi se apvartan kaa niyam aapatan kone kii jya / apvartan kone kii jya = apvartanaank bhi pramanit ho jaataa he
 The reason for reflection can also be understood as excessive seduction
 yah bhi spasht he ki is siddhant ke anusaar vaayu kii apeksha jal main prakaash kaa veg adhik hona chahie
 But there was one thing that was not understood by this theory
 pratyaksh anubhav ke anusaar jab bhi prakaash do padaartho ke parthakytal par padataa he, to uskaa ansh to paravartit ho jaataa he or kuch dwitiya padaarth main pravesh kar jaataa he
 For this epileptic reflection and refraction, it is necessary that some light corpus may be exerted by force and some are attracted
 yah kaise sambhav ho saktaa he ? is aapatti ko dur karne ke liye newton ne yah pariklpana banaai ki prakaashakanikaon ek prakaar kaa daura aata he, jisase kabhi vah aakrisht ho jaati he or kabhi parakrisht
 Why these seizures come, a strange fantasy was also formed from the relation that air is another medium which helps in the movement of light, which is filled in every substance like air, water, water etc
 parthakytal par prakashanika kii takkar se jo tarangen utpann hoti hai unheen ke kaaran ye daure aate hai
 Boskovich and Beau explain the reason for this, that the magnet has two poles, similar to a magnet
 ek par archeshan bal lagata he to duusare par pratikarshan
 Therefore, the same force is applied on the corpus as the pole is ahead at that time
 kintu vyatikaran tathaa dhruvan kii ghatnaon kii vyakhya is siddhant ke dwaara sambhav nahin hui
 And when the velocity of light in solid materials was measured by experiment, then contrary to this theory, it came out less in water than air; This variation was fatal to this theory

 The pulley is a circular column, from which the power of the machine is carried from one place to another
 yadi kisi kharad ko ingine se chalaanaa he, to ingine kii ghirani or kharad kii ghirani par patta chadhaakar ingine kii shakti se kharad ko chalaate hai
 The speed of the machines can be reduced or increased by the diameter of the pulley
 mashiinon kii shakti ko bina kisi haani ke to daantonvale chakron se hi ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par le jaaya ja saktaa he, parantu jahaan in sthanon main duuri adhik ho vahaan in chakron kaa upyog nahin ho saktaa
 In these places the pulleys are used
 inpar chamade ke patton yaa rasson ko chadhaakar ek ghirani se duusari ghirani ko shakti di jaati he
 The pulley only changes the direction of the force, not the magnitude of the force
 
 If another machine is being run from the engine, the engine puller will be called the pulley and the pulley of the pulley of the machine
 ghiraniyaan praaia: dhalwaan lohe kii hoti hai, jinamein bich kaa bhaag ghirani ke haal se baajuon dwaara judaa hota he
 They range from four to six in number
 ghirani ke bichwaale bhaag ke chhed main dhuree ko daalkar kas diya jaataa he
 The measurement of each part of the pulley is such that it can bear every force that falls on it
 ghirani ke haal kii chaudaai patte kii chaudaai se kuch hi zyada rakhi jaati he
 There will be two types of force on it, one due to the stretch of the strap and the other due to its rotation
 yah dekha gaya he ki ek varg inch pariched ke haal kii ghirani kii gati 100 foot prati second se adhik honi chahie
 Therefore the cast iron ring is not run faster than this speed
 jahaan adhik gati kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vahaan kachche or dhalwaan lohe ko milakar ghirani banaai jaati he
 It should be noted that the high-speed pulleys are not molded, but different parts of it are separated and connected by screws
 is prakaar kii ghirani kaa bhaar bhi praaia: adhik nahin hota or na uske tuutane kaa itnaa dar rahata he
 It is also taken care in making a pulley that its center of attraction is right in the middle
 yadi aisa na hua to dhuree ke ghoomte hi usamen thartharaahat paidaa hogi or dhuree ko tolan kharaab ho jaayga
 Therefore, the weight of the pulley is mounted on its axis and its weight is checked
 isko jaanchne ke liye dhuree ko donon kinaaron se aadhaaron par rakh diya jaataa he
 If the axle stops at every place and does not rotate, its weight will be fine and if it rotates to another side, it will show that the pulley is heavier from one side
 ghirani jis ore baari hoti he uske duusari ore utana hi vajan baandhakar iskaa tolan thik kar liya jaataa he
 Different types of pulleys are given below: yah ghirani alag alag vyas kii do yaa usase zyada ghiraniyon ko milakar banaai jaati he
 The padhni is molded into a single part
 inkaa upyog usee sthaan par hota he jahaan chalaane or chalanevaali donon ghiraniyaan hon or chalanevaali mashin kii gati ko badalane kii bhi aavashyaktaa ho
 These pulleys are arranged in such a way that the small pulley of one pulley is in front of the big pulley of the other
 isse patte ko ek pad se duusare pad par badalane se patte kii lambaai main koi antar nahin aata, isaliye patte ko ghirani par chadhaane se pehle uski lambaai donon ghiraniyon ke vyaason kaa lekar nikaal lee jaati he
 The strap which is mounted on the pulley also changes the direction of the moving machine
 isse liye yadi patte ke donon baaju samaantar hai, to chalanevaali ghirani ke ghoomane kii disha vahi hogi jo chalaanevaali ghirani kii he
 If this direction is to be changed, then the leash arms are mounted on each other to the pulley
 yah ghirani praaia: chote aakaar kii hoti he or patte kaa tanaav thik banaae rakhane ke kaam aati he
 a spindle on its axis is left on the leash and due to the force of the skand, it holds the pulley strap
 chalate chalate yadi patte kaa tanaav kam ho jaae, to skanda ke dabaav ke kaaran savaar ghirani patte par or dab jaati he, jisase tanaav main kami nahin ho paati
 That is why the riding pulley is installed on almost every lease
 ye donon ghiraniyaan paas paas chalaanevaali dhuriyaan par lagaai jaati hai or in donon kaa vyas baraabar hota he
 The first pulley is tightened on the spindle and is used to run the machines
 duusari dhili ghirani na to dhuree ke ghoomane se gumti he or na iske ghoomane se dhuree gumti he
 Applying a loose pulley only means that the axle rotates when the strap is brought from the pulley pulley, but the gripper stops
 isaliye jo mashin is dhuree se chalaai ja rahi ho, vah bina dhuree ke roke hue roki ja sakati he
 When this machine has to be run again, the leash is brought on a static pulley
 in ghiraniyon kaa aakaar v kii shakl kaa hota he or ye vahaan kaam aati hai jahaan rasson ko shakti le jane ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 In some places the power is so much that it cannot be carried with leather straps
 isaliye kai kai rasson ko milakar is prakaar kii ghiraniyon par chadha diya jaataa he
 These ropes are also made of yarn and also of iron wire
 doosraa laabh in rasson se yah hota he ki chalate samay ye ghiraniyon par utana nahin phisalte jitna chamade kaa patta phisalata he
 It does not cause loss of power
 yadi chalane or chalaanevaali dhuriyaan samaantar nahin he, to patta ghiraniyon par se phisal jayega
 To prevent this, the road pulley is used
 is ghirani ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki chalaanevaali ghirani or maarg ghirani kii dhuriyaan ek samtal main hon or maarg ghirani tathaa chalanevaali ghirani kii dhuree ek samtal main ho
 This will not remove the leash mounted on the pulleys

 According to the belief of many historians and local people, Jammu was founded by King Jambulochan in the 14th century BC
 i named it Jambupura which later deteriorated to Jammu
 raay jambulochan raja bahulochan kaa chota bhai tha
 In Bahulochan, Bahu Fort was built on the banks of river Tavi and Jambulochan settled the city of Jambupura
 raja ek baar akhet karte hue tavi nadi ke tat par ek sthaan par pahunchaa jahaan usne dekha ki ek sher va bakrii ek saath ek hi ghat par pani pi rahe hai
 Both animals went their own way after drinking water
 raja aashcharyachakit rah gaya or akhet kaa vichaar chhodkar apane saathiyon ke paas pahunchaa va sari katha vistaar se bataayi
 Everyone said that this place will be full of peace and harmony where lion and goat are drinking water together
 tab usne aadesh diya ki is sthaan par ek kile kaa nirmaan kiya jaye va uske nikat hi shahar basaaya jaye
 The name of the city was called Jambupura or Jambunagar and later became Jammu
 aaj bhi yahaan bahu kaa kila ek aitihaasik evam darshneey sthal he
 The name of the city is also mentioned in the Mahabharata

 Here the Deva dynasty ruled from 840 AD to 1860 AD
 tab nagar anya bhartiya nagaron se alag-thalag pad gaya or unase pichad gaya tha
 After that the Dogra rulers came and the city of Jammu regained its lost aura and pride
 unhone yahaan bade bade mandiron va tirthon kaa nirmaan kiya va puraane sthanon kaa jirnoddhar karavaaya, saath hi kai shaikshik santhaan bhi banawaaye
 The city progressed a lot during that period
 dogra shasakon se jammu kaa shashan 19veen shatabdi main maharaja ranjit singh ji ke niyantran main aayaa or is prakaar jammu sikh samrajya kaa bhaag bana
 Maharaja Ranjit Singh appointed Gulab Singh as the ruler of Jammu
 kintu ye shashan adhik samay nahin chal paaya or maharaja ranjit singh ke dehant ke baad hi sikh samrajya kamjor pad gaya or maharaja dalip singh ke shashan ke baad hi british sena ke adhikaar main aa gaya or dalip singh ko company ke aadeshaanusaar england le jaaya gaya
 But at that time the British Raj did not have enough resources to fight in the mountains due to the right to control many parts of Punjab
 atah unhone maharaja gulab singh ko sutluj nadi ke uttari kshetra kaa sabase shaktimaan shaasha maanate hue jammu or kashmir kaa shaasha maan liya
 But in return he took 75 lakh cash from Maharaj
 yah nagad bhugtan maharaja ke sikh samrajya ke purv jagirdaar rahe hone ke kaaran vaid mana gaya or is sandhi ke dayittvon main bhi aata tha
 Thus Maharaja Gulab Singh is revered as the founder of Jammu and Kashmir

 The method to design some amusing oblique equilateral faces is: draw an even hexagon on an office or hard paper and draw a similar hexagon on each of its arms
 in saat shadbhujon se ghire hue kshetra kii parisima main 18 bhujaayen hai
 Cut them with a sharp knife or blade and separate the area
 phir is kshetra se bichwala shadbhuj bhi kaat kar alag kar den
 Now cut five of the common circles of each pair of hexes halfway away from within and wrinkle in the remaining half
 chhathi ubhaynishth kor ko puraa kaat den
 Now if these cut-off corpses are stacked on top of each other, then there will be an equilateral circular hole in the middle
 yadi aise sire ke do shadbhujon ko duusare sire ke do shadbhujon par sampati kar diya jaay to vargakar chhidr milegaa
 If the three vertices of the end are coincided, the equilateral triangular holes will be found
 teen salangn shadbhujon kii mukt koron ko sataakar chipka dene se bhi sambahu tribhujaakar chhidr milegaa
 If a truncated hexagon is placed at one end of a ring with a triangular ring, such an oblique rhombus will be found
 jiske chaaron shirshon par se 4 chote samaan samachatushfalak kaat die gaye hai
 By placing two rings with square holes in such a way that the facing part of the square hole coincides, it forms an oblique octave that is found by cutting the same square column from the vertices of the same octave
 panchabhujaakar chhidravale 12 valyon ko is prakaar rakhane par ki shadbhuj hote jaae, vah tiryakchhin samavinshatifalak banataa he jiske shirshon se sampanchabhujakaarawale soochistambh kaat liye gaye hai
 Leaves can be filled in the same way as bricks by attaching oblique octaves
 is dasha main shadbhuj ek aise samaspanj arthath kutil bahufalak ke falak ho jate hai jiske prayek sheersh par chaar shadbhuj he
 Similarly, a crooked plank formed by oblique quadrilaterals has six vertices on each head, in addition to these two, there is another kind of crooked plank with six squares on each vertex
 yah bahufalak he jiske prayek sheersh par chahevarg rahete hai
 This polyhedron can be formed from cubes that do not have two opposite faces
 is bahufalak kii ghari ho sakati he
 Like the five platonic solids of these three crooked polyfields, the planar equilateral and the angle are the same
 ganitiya pratirupon kaa prayojan saadhyon kii upapatti dena nahin hota, kavel unhen samajhane main sahaayta dena or khoj kii nai dishaaen sujhana hota he
 That is why they do not have to be as accurate as the graphs and calculations

 The study of conic mathematics, which is done by most analytical methods, becomes simple and comprehensible by the use of models
 is praturup main keval ek lamb vrittadhar shanku ke vibhinn kaat dikhaae jate hai
 If the cut is parallel to the plane base, the cut is a circle, if the plane is slightly inclined to the base, that is, the axis makes an angle larger than the half-angle, then the cut is ellipsoid, if the plane is parallel to a parent line, the cut is the parabola and If the plane makes a smaller angle than the half-angle from the axis, the cut is a branch of the hyperbola
 yadi shanku ke bheetar do gole or in golon ko sparsh karata hua ek samtal bana den to in golon ke ubhay sparshi ke baraabar ek taar dwaara yah tathy saralata se sthapit kiya ja saktaa he ki samtal se golon ke sparshabindu us dirghavruth kii nabhiyaan hai jo shanku kii kaat se miltaa he
 Problems related to the ring ring, cylinder, and their entrainment can be easily cited with the help of wood models
 samamit thos or parikramaj prishth kharad par taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Those that are not symmetrical relative to the surface axis can also be constructed in a proper lathe with a chuck running at a focal speed

 The patterns generated by straight lines, that is, the linear pages, can be easily constructed, as the parents can be represented by successive torsion points
 udhaahrant: do samaan vrittiya mandalkon main paas paas samdurastha chhed karen or unhen ek hi aksh par is prakaar kasen ki ek sthir rahe or doosraa aksh par ghumaya ja sake
 Now thread the threads through the holes corresponding to the circles
 upar ke chhidr se dorak bandhaa rahe or neechavaale sire par bhaar badhaan rahe, jisase dorak sidhaa rahe
 When the fork hangs freely from the circles, the cylinder is formed from the door

 The Maharana's army forced the Mughal army to retreat and the Mughal army started fleeing
 deever kaa yuddh In the history of Rajasthan, the war of Diwar is considered to be an important war in 1582, because in this war the lost kingdoms of Rana Pratap were recovered, after this a long struggle between Rana Pratap and the Mughals took place as a war, due to which Colonel James Todd called this war the "marathon of Mewar"
 safalataa or avsaan 
 From 1579 to 1585 revolts were started in the Mughal occupied territories of the former Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat and Maharana was also winning strongholds one after the other, so as a result Akbar was averse to suppress that rebellion and from the Mewar Mughals
