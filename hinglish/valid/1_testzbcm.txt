 The people who observe this Papankusha Ekadashi fast on the Shukla Paksha of Ashwin month, get to Harilok at the end of time and get rid of all sins
 sona, til, bhoomi, gau, ann, jal, chhatari tathaa juuti daan karne se manushya yamraj ko nahin dekhtaa
 a man who spends days of life without performing any kind of virtuous deed is like a lifeless breathing, like a blacksmith's furnace

 Such human beings do not have to see the door of Yama and remain longevity, noble and disease-free through longevity in the world

 But it was Arthur Cox who brought Newcastle back into the first division with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, Terry mcdermott and former England captain Kevin Keegan, who were the base of the team
 Newcastle had been at the peak for a long time, including managers such as Jack Charlton, Willie mcfaul and Jim Smith, and players such as Paul Geskoign before the team's performance collapsed in 1989

 The Newcastle team struggled at the wrong end of the second division; Sir John Hall was doing everything except to take control of the club and to save Newcastle from reaching the third tier for the first time in its history, they needed a small spell
 apane hi kshetra main portsmouth or bahya kshetron main licester city ke viruddh donon lig game ke final charan main jeetne se unka bachanaa sunishchit ho gaya, licester se unki jeet antim kshan main kiye gaye gol se hui thi, haalanki jais baad main spasht ho gaya, yadi newcastle licester se parajeet ho jaataa to bhi vah batch jaataa

 keni delgish unke uttaradhikari ke rup main aaye or lig main doosraa sthaan paane main club kaa netritv kiya, unhone kigan dwaara banaaye gayi team main koi parivartan nahin kiya
 However, his fortunes were soon reversed due to the injuries suffered by the players and the market transfer of the 1997–98 season, as well as new players who were not able to match the players who were contracted

 Delgish left at the beginning of the 1998–99 season and after that, Rude Gullit took over the reins of the team
 After contracting the players, the club once again reached the final of the FA Cup but failed to win

 Even after a good end to the 2005–06 season, Roeder's fortunes were overturned in the 2006–07 season, due to the event that he relied on youth academy players to compete in the Premier League and Europe
 Having done so and to this day is seen as the worst loss of senior players in the history of the club, he left the club on 6 May 2007 by mutual consent

 cricket ke khel main kshetrarakshan vah kala yaa vidha he jahaan kshetrarakshak ballebaaj dwaara maari gayi gend ko ran bachaane ke liye roktaa he, ballebaaj ko out karne ke liye use hawa main kaich karata he athtava ballebaaj ko ran out karne kaa prayaas karata he
 'the fielder can stop the ball from any part of his body
 parantu yadi vah jaanboojh kar topi yaa anya kisi vastu kaa prayog gend rokane ke liye kare to virdohi team ko 5 ran penlti ke rup main dene padate hai
 The only condition is that the batsman has tried to play the ball with the bat and not to let it go
 Most of the fielding rules are defined in Section 41 of the Cricket Laws
 test cricket ke shuru main kshetrarakshan par adhik dhyaan nahin diya jaataa tha, isaliye adhiktar kshetrarakshak saadhaaran hua karte the
 With the advent of one-day cricket, this art improved a lot as run saving became very important
 ek uttam kshetrarakshak team ek din main 30 ran tak bachaa sakati he
 One of the 11 fielders on the team is a wicket-keeper and a bowler, and the other 9 can defend anywhere
 koun se sthaan bhare honge koun se rikt ye captain par nirbhar karata he
 The captain can change the guarding location at any time by consulting his colleagues
 keval gend phenke jane kii prakriya ke dauraan yah nishedh he
 There are a number of fielders assigned to cricket, some of which are commonly used while others are rarely used
 parantu yah koi pathar kii lakeer nahin he tathaa inke itar bhi anya sthaan hote hai
 Most of the fielders have been designated batsmen as centers
 udhaaharan ke liye cover, mid wicket tathaa leg jaise shabd rakshak se ballebaaj kii disha or kone ko bayaan karte hai
 Also, their predicate words like long, silly, deep and short tell the distance of the guard from the batsman
 becoward tathaa farverd shabdon kaa prayog kar rakshan sthanon ko or behatar prakaar se niyat kiya jaataa he
 In the picture, the defense stages of common use have been identified, the direction to its left is called leg side or on side and to the right of off side
 For left-handed batsman, this arrangement does the exact opposite
 kuch rakshan sthaan ugr rakshan ke liye jane jate hai, jaise ki slip 
 slip kaa dhyey ballebaaj ke balle ke kone se nikle ’age’ ko lapaknaa hota he
 Other extreme protection places are fly slip, street, leg lane, leg slip and short and silly places
 In addition, the bat pad is the protection stage where the ball falls within one meter from the bat and then the pad and the guard standing there catches it
 ye sabhi avasthaayen ran rokane kii nahin balki out karne kaa dhyey rakhti hai
 Other key fielding locations include: iske atirikt zaruri he ki gendbaaj gend phenkate huye pich par naa aaye
 aam taur par gendbaaj sili mid of yaa sili mid on tak aa jate hai
 Apart from this, commentators have also been heard using other words, such as a little wide from normal street, or a little deep from mid-off, it should come a little short, etc
 kshetrarakshak ko kahin bhi khadaa kiya ja saktaa he, jab tak vah nimna niyamon k paalan kare
 gend phenke jane ke samay: If any of these rules are violated, the umpire can declare no bol
 gendbaaj ke haath se striker tak gend pahunchane tak koi khilaadi hilanaa nahin chaiye, anyathaa ded bal diya jaataa he
 Only the players standing near the batsman can move the leg only
 haa seemaa par khadey khilaadi gend phenke jate samay pich kii ore aa sakate hai, parantu seemaa kii ore janaa nishedh he
 Apart from the wicket-keeper and bowler, where the other 9 guards will be stationed, it is a very important strategic decision for the captain
 ek captain ke liye atyant zaruri he ki vah akraman va raksha donon ke bich sateek talmail bana sake
 aakraamak kshetrarakshan main rakshak ballebaaj ke nikat khadey kiye jate hai taaki adhik kaich pakade ja saken
 udhaaharan ke liye slip va short leg aakraamak kshetrarakshan sthaan hai
 In defensive policy, the defenders try to save runs by standing at the far boundary
 kai paristhitiyaan kshetrarakshan ko prabhavit karti hai, jaise match kii sthiti, gendbaaj kaa kaushal, ballebaaj nayaa he yaa jam chukaa he, gend kii sthiti, pich kii haalat, roshni va khel samaapt hone main baaki samay
 Some General Principles: 9 khiladiyon ko kahaan kshetrarakshan karana he yah captain ke liye ek mahatvapurn nirnay hota he
 This number cannot be the same on both sides
 camentry main jab ’5-4 field ’ kaha jaataa he to uskaa arth hota he 5 kshetrarakshak of kii taraf or 4 leg kii ore
 Usually more fielders are kept towards the off as most bowlers bowl at the off stump and get more shots there
 prachur akraman kii avasthaa main 3 se 4 slip va 2 gali tak ho sakate hai
 That is, 6 guards out of 9 on the off
 Together live on mid on, mid wicket and fine leg, ie 7-2 field
 Both the defenders on the leg side are mostly empty as the bowling is centered on the off stump and most shots also go the same way
 yah akraman sanrachana ballebaaj ko leg kii ore khaali sthano par shaat maarane ko baadhya karti he jisase uske out hone kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai
 As the match progresses, the structure can then be 5-4 or 6-4
 tathaa rakshak slip va gali tyaag kar sudur seemaa par ja sakate hai
 On the other hand, leg spinners mostly work from 4-5 structures as their attack is centered on the leg stump
 iske dwaara vah leg disha main kaich, taangon ke peeche se out karne va stump out kaa prayaas karte hai
 On some special occasions the 2-7 structure is used
 sabhi gendbaaj leg stump par gend rakhte hai tathaa ran banane ke liye ballebaaj ko khatra uthaanaa padataa he
 Come out of the leg stump and play the shot but the stumps are seen all over
 reverse sweep yaa pul tathaa haath badal kar khelnaa bhi kaaphi khatarnaak hota he
 In contrast, the 7-2 structure is mounted on the off-stump
 ballebaaj yaa to gend jane detaa he yaa leg disha main shaat khilne ke prayaas main khatra mol le letaa he
 In another offensive structure, bouncers are thrown at the border towards the leg
 hook yaa pul karne ke prayaas main ballebaaj kaich de baithta he
 For slow ball, defenders are put forward 10-15 meters so that leg glasses and sweep shots can be stopped
 wicket keeper ko chhodkar kshetrarakshan karne vaale paksh kaa koi anya sadsy dastaane yaa eksternal leg guard nahin pahan saktaa
 haalanki kshetrarakshak apane kapadon ke bheetar shin protector, groin protector or chest protector pahan sakate hai

 champoo shravy kavy kaa ek bhed he, arthath gadhy-padya ke mishrit kavy ko champoo kehete hai
 The prose and poetry mixed poetry is called "champu"
 kavy kii is vidha kaa ullekh sahityashastra ke pracheen aacharyon- bhamah, dandi, vaaman aadi ne nahin kiya he
 Thus, the use of prose Padmayya style is also found in Vedic literature, Buddhist Jataka, Jatakamala etc
 in very ancient literature
 champookavy parampara kaa prarambh hamen atharv veda se praapt hota he
 Prakrit Kavya, named Champu, was not composed before the tenth century
 trivikram bhatta dwaara rachit 'nalchampu', jo dasvin sadi ke prarambh kii rachana he, champoo kaa prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Apart from this, the Yashashtilak composed by Somdev Suri, Bhojraj's Champu Ramayana, the poet Karnapuri's Anandavrindavan, Gopal Champu, Neelkanth Champu and Champu are examples of India from tenth to seventeenth century
 yah kavy rup adhik lokapriy na ho sakaa or na hi kavyashastra main uski vishesh manyata hui
 Yashodhara in Hindi is called champu-kavya, because both prose-verse has been used in it
 gadhy or padya ke is mishran kaa uchit vibhaajan yah prathit hota he ki bhavatmak vishyon kaa varnan padya ke dwaara tathaa varnanaatmak vishyon kaa vivaran gadhy ke dwaara prastut kiya jaay
 But Champurichayas have given importance to their free will and personal interest in the combination of both, by not paying special attention to this psychological feature

 The compositions of prose-verse are available in Krishna Yajurvedic codes
 pali jaatakon main bhi gadhy main kathanak tathaa padya main mul sutratmak sanketon kii uplabdhi avashya hoti he
 But being devoid of poetry, we cannot consider them as "champu" in any way

 Champu seems to have been an enlarged form of prose poetry and that is why this poetic form emerged around the eternal ninth century of the golden age of prose poetry
 champu kavy kaa pratham nidarshan trivikram bhatta kaa nalchampu he jisamen champu kaa vaishishty sphutatya udbhasith hota he
 The trivikram composed this dainty champu while staying in the shelter of Indraj, the son of King Jagatuga and Lakshmi, the grandson of King Krishna of the south

 champu ke antim teen uchhravaason main jaindharm ke siddhaton kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kar kavi ne in siddhanton kaa paryaapt prachaar prastaar kiya he
 The description of the various religious, economic and social subjects of that era in the book is indicative of the comprehensive and multi-faceted worship of somprabhasuri
many talented poets have demonstrated their talent by reciting the charitas of ram tathaa krishna ke charit kaa avlamban kar anek pratibhashali kaviyon ne apni pratibha kaa ruchir pradarshan kiya he
 Among such champu poems, Bhojraj's Ramayana Champu, Anantabhatta's "bharat Champu", Shesh Krishna's "parijataharan Champu" are quite famous
 bhojraj ne ramayana champu kii rachana kiskindha cond tak hi kii thi, jisaki purti lakshmana bhatta ne "yukand" kii tathaa venkatraj ne "uttar cond" kii rachana kar kii thi
 Like Jain poets, Chaitanya Mataavalambi Vaishnava poets adopted this fine poetry medium with great success to spread their principles
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii lalaam lilaon kaa prasang aisa hi sundar avasar he jab in kaviyon ne apni aloksaamanya pratibha kaa prasad apane champu kaavyon ke dwaara bhakt pathakon ke saamne prastut kiya
 Anandavrindavan Champu of Poet Karnapur, and Gopalchampu of Jeeva Goswami are extremely successful poets in terms of Saras poetry
 inamen se pratham kavy krishna kii balalilaon kaa vistrut tathaa vishad varnan karata he, dwitiya kavy krishna ke samgr charit kaa maarmik vivaran he
 Eminent author Mitra Mishra of "veeramitrodaya", "anandakand Champu" adds an interesting series to Krishnaprakum champs
 dakshin bharat main bhi champukavyon kii lokapriyata kam na thi
 Neelkanth Dixit's "neelkanthvijay Champu" is about Samudramanthan
 shri vaishnav venkatadhvari ke "vishvagunadarsh champu" kii rachana anya champuon se is baat main vishisht he ki isamen bharat ke naanaa tirtho, dharmo tathaa shastragyon main dosha tathaa gunon kaa udghaatan badi maarmikata se ek saath kiya gaya he
 This is a particularly popular poem
 vanishwar vidyalankar kaa "chitrachampu" bengal ke ek vishisht pandit kavi kii rachana he jisamen bhakthi dwaara bhagwatprapti kaa sanket rupakastyle main ek saras aakhyaan ke madhya se kiya gaya he 
 Thus, despite being a popular medium for many centuries for the manifestation of sentiments in Sanskrit literature, Champu poetry could not be stagnant in North Indian language literature
 drawidi bhashaa ke sahitya main samanyat:, kerali tathaa andhra sahitya main visheshat:, champu kavy aaj bhi lokapriy he jiske pranyan kii ore kavijanon kaa dhyaan purnat: aakrisht he

 Buddhism was founded by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BCE
 buddha kaa janm 563 isa purv main lumbini, nepal or mahaparinirvana 483 isa purv kushinagar, bharat main hua tha
 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent
 buddha dharm main chaar pramukh sampradaay hai: hinayan, therwaad, mahayan, vajrayan or navyan, parantu buddha dharm ek hi he evam sabhi buddha sampradaay buddha ke siddhanth hi maanate he
 Buddhism is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, nearly 2 billion people in the world are followers of Buddhism
 kintu, america ke pu research ke anusaar, vishwa main lagbhag 54 karod log buddha dharm ke anuyaayi he, jo duniya kii aabaadi kaa 7% hissaa he
 Pew Research has reported a very small number of Buddhists from China, Japan and Vietnam, although these countries are the top three countries with the highest Buddhist population
 duniya ke 200 se adhik deshon main buddha anuyaayi hai
 But Buddhism is a 'major religion' religion in a total of 18 countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tibet, Laos, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and North Korea
 bharat, nepal, america, australia, indonesia, rus, bruneii, malaysia aadi deshon main bhi lakhon or karodon buddha anuyaayi hai
 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful deeds 5
 Samyuk Jeevika: Any Do not even do business directly or indirectly 6
 6
 Effort: Try to improve yourself 7
 Right memory: Try to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Self Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom
 siddharth gautam ab buddhatv paakar akaash jaise anant gyani ho chuke the
 Where does the Pipal tree under which he sits, go to the Bodhi tree i

 Millions of Buddhist followers and people interested in Buddhism reach here every year
 buddha anuyaayion ke yahaan har saal aane kaa sabase bada kaaran yah he ki bhagwaan buddha ne apana pratham upadesh yaheen diya tha
 Centuries ago, he started the dharma-chakra-praman from this place

 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc
 kushinagar buddha anuyaayion kaa bahut bada pavitra tirth sthal he
 Lord Buddha attained Mahaparinirvana in Kushinagar itself

 He was cremated near Rambhar Stupa
 uttar pradesh ke jila gorakhpur se 55 kilometre dur kushinagar buddha anuyaayion ke alaava paryaton premiyon ke liye bhi khaas aakarshan kaa centre he
 At the age of 80, a large number of people came to meet Buddha before he left his body
 mana jaataa he ki 120 varshiya brahman subhadr ne buddha ke vachanon se prabhavit hokar sangh se judye kii ichha jataai
 Subhadra is believed to have been the last monk whom the Buddha initiated
