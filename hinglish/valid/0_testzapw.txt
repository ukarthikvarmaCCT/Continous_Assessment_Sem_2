 rumba do bilkul alag-alag arthon ke saath nrity ke liye prayukt hone vaala shabd he
 First of all it means the African-style Cuban event, which is associated with the rumba style of african-cuban music
 is tarah ke rumba kii kai sheliyaan hai jiname guaguanko style sabase aam he
 Secondly, it refers to one of the ballroom dances which are performed in social dances and international competitions
 is arth main, rumba nrity paanch pratispardhaatmak antarrashtriya latin nrityon: paso doble, samba, chaa-chaa-chaa tathaa jive main sabase dhimaa he
 This ballroom rumba dance was also performed in Cuba on a rhythm that he called bolero-son; International style was born as a result of dance studies in Cuba before the time of the revolution
 taal evam nrity ke maamle main, africa-cubai rumba nrity bollroom rumba se puri tarah alag he
 See Guaguanco
 salsa or mambo kii tarah bollroom rumba kii mudraaen or sangeet son se utpann hue he
 The first Cuban musical to succeed internationally was Peanut Vendor; It was incorrectly described as rumba on the label, perhaps because it was thought that it would not be easy to understand the word son in English
 The label was successful and a frenzy towards rumba developed through the 1930s
 is tarah ke rumba ko america or europe main 1930 ke dashak main nrity kaladderghaaon main pesh kiya gaya tha or isaki visheshta parivartansheel taal thi jo ki kabhi-kabhi aadhunik bollroom rumba kii taal se doguni thi
 The modern international style of rumba dance stems from a study by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre, who was an associate of Doris Lavelle
 piyare, jo us samay landan main the, ne 1947, 1951 or 1957 main cuba kii yatra yah jaanane ke liye kii ki us samay cubai log kaise or koun sa nrity karte the
 The International Ballroom Rumba with 120 Rhythm per minute is a slow dance similar to the bolero-son dance of the older generation of Cubans in terms of both music and dance
 yah samajhnaa aasaan he ki kis prakaar galat hote hue bhi sandarbh tathaa vipanan main aasaani ke liye rumba ek behatar naam he; yahi kaaran he jisaki vajah se cubai mul ke sampurna lokapriy sangeet ke liye baad main salsa shabd kaa prayog hone laga
 All Cuban social dances involve standing on the feet and moving the hips, though salsa, which is a fast dance, rarely pays attention to the fact that it is more pronounced in the slow-motion ballroom rumba
 saamaanya shabdon main, mudraaen sankshipt he or bina kisi utaar va chadhaav ke nrity kiya jaataa he
 This style is authentic as the free use of arms in many postures
 is nrity kii mul mudraaen hawana main kranti ke samay se pehle kiye jane vaale nrity se utpann hui hai or iske baad se hi inkaa vikaas hua he
 Competition postures are often complex and for this reason dance dances are different from social dances
 nrity shikshan sanghathanon ke paathyakram or maanak granthon se adhik jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati he
 Sometimes in the United States, a version of this dance is also performed, in which the original shape of the legs postures resembles a box
 is sanskaran ko aam taur par pratiyogitaaon main antarrashtriya style dwaara sthaan diya gaya he, lekin phir bhi saamaajik rup se is par nrity kiya ja saktaa he

 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris
 academi ne vrittant par vishwaas na karte hue ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye ek ayog niyukt kiya jiske prativedan main fadar basile ke vrittant ko bhramaatmak bataate hue yah mantavya prakat kiya gaya ki bijli gir jane se pind kaa prishth kuch is prakaar kaanch sadrush ho gaya tha jisase basile ko yah bhram hua ki yah pind prithvi kaa ansh nahin hai
 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical
 inamen se pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa aashmik ang mukhyat: aulivin khanij se bana hota he jiske sfat praaia: vrittakar hote hai or jo louh-nikal dhaatuon ke ek tantra main samaavrutt rahete hai
 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum
 loha 
 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon

 Helium in 52 tatwon main se keval aath prachur maatra main paae jate hai, jinamein haalon sabase pramukh he
 The other seven are sequentially Oxygen, Silicon, Manganese, Sulfur, Aluminum, Nickel and Calcium
 inke atirikt 20 anya tatv paryaapt maatra main paae jate hai tathaa unki upasthiti kaa pataa saadhaaran rasinic vishleshan dwaara 1926 se purv hi lag chukaa tha
 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet
 aashmik ulkapindon main saadharantaya piroxin or aulivin kii prachurtaa evam felsapaar kaa abhaav hota he, jisase unka sanghathan bhumandal kii atibhasmik shailon ke sadrush hota he
 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 ° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin

 The National Conference, which was the largest popular organization in Kashmir and its president was Sheikh Abdullah, also appealed to India for defense
 pehle algaavvaadi sanghathan ne kashmiri panditon se centre sarkaar ke khilaaf vidroh karne ke liye kaha tha, lekin jab panditon ne aisa karne se inkaar diya to unka sanhaar kiya jane laga
 On 4 January 1990, 1
5 lakh Hindus migrated from Kashmir seeing this scene of Kashmir

 Different proteins in this region move at different speeds according to their sizes, while their electric charge is kept the same by a surfactant called sodium lauryl sulfate
 kuch vyavsaayik western blott pareekshan kiton main selulose acitate kii pattee par pehle se echivi protein hote hai
 Once the proteins are well isolated, they are transferred onto a membrane and the test is performed like an ELISA - the individual's diluted serum is applied to the membrane and serum antibodies may bind to some HIV proteins

 There are no universal criteria for the interpretation of Western blot tests - the number of virus bands required for this may vary
 yadi virus bandon kaa pataa na chale, to pareekshan nakaaratmak hota he
 The result is positive if at least one virus band is present for GAG, POL and ENV gene-producing groups
 western blott kii vyakhya ke liye teen-jin-utpaada vaali pahunch ko jan swasthya yaa chikitsakeey kaamkaaj main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Tests in which the number of virus bands is less than the requirement are considered indeterminate - a person with uncertain results should be re-tested, as subsequent tests may be more conclusive

 The ELISA test alone cannot be used to diagnose HIV, even though the test does not indicate a high likelihood of the presence of antibodies to HIV-1
 united stats main aise elisa pareekshanon ko western blott se pushti ke bina pasitive report nahin mana jaataa he
 ELISA antibody tests were developed to give a high degree of confidence that donated blood is not infected with HIV
 isaliye yah nirnay karnaa sambhav nahin he ki sakaaratmak elisa pareekshan ke kaaran raktaadhan ke liye asweekrut rakt vastav main echivi se sankramit he
 Sometimes the donor is tested again after several months to receive a negative ELISA antibody test
 yahi vajah he ki pasitive echivi pareekshan ke parinaam ko report karne ke pehle hameshaa pushtikaarak western blott kiya jaataa he
 Rare false positive results due to factors unrelated to HIV infection are more common with ELISA testing than with Western blot
 mithyaa pasitive haal main hue teevr sankramanon or allergiyon jaise rogon se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 Several false-positive tests in the fall of 1991 were initially attributed to influenza vaccines used during that flu season, but later investigations linked this cross-reactivity to several relatively nonspecific test kits

 When the ELISA test is combined with Western blot, the rate of false positives becomes extremely low and diagnostic accuracy is greatly increased
 aadhunik echivi pareekshan atyant sateek hota he
 The evidence for the risks and benefits related to HIV screening was studied in July 2005 by the US Preventive Services Task Force
 lekhakon ne nishkarsh nikaala ki: 


 the use of repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay remains the standard method for diagnosing HIV-1 infection
 a large study of HIV testing in 752 US laboratories reported a sensitivity of 99
7% and specificity of 98
5% for enzyme immunoassay, and studies in US blood donors reported specificities of 99
8% and greater than 99
99%
 With confirmatory Western blot, the chance of a false-positive identification in a low-prevalence setting is about 1 in 250 000
 saste anzime immunoesse jaanch pareekshanon ke liye yahaan di gai vishistataa dar yah sanket detii he ki 1000 sakaaratmak echivi pareekshan parinaamon main se lagbhag 15 mithyaa sakaaratmak honge
 Confirmation of test results may reduce the probability of false positives to eventually 1 in 250,000 trials
 isi tarah samvedansheeltaa kii dar yah sanket detii he ki 1000 nakaaratmak echivi nateezon main se 3 vastav main mithyaa nakaaratmak parinaam honge
 But given the rates of HIV incidence at most testing centers in the United States, the negative predictive value of these tests is extremely high, meaning that any negative result would be true more than 9997 times out of 10,000 tests
 in pareekshanon ke bahut ucch bhavishyavaanee mulya ke kaaran hi sidisi yah sifarish karti he ki nakaaratmak pareekshan parinaam ko is baat kaa nirnaayak saboot mana jaay ki vah vyakti echivi se sankramit nahin he
 Actual numbers may vary according to the population tested
 aisa isaliye he kyonki kisi bhi medical pareekshan kii vyakhya prarambh main vishwaas ke darje yaa rog ke hone yaa na hone kii sambhaavna par nirbhar karti he
 Normally the prior probability is estimated using the information of the occurrence of the disease at the place of test or in the population

 It is necessary to remember that the accuracy of current methods of HIV testing in the United States has been confirmed by numerous studies and reported a false-positive rate of 0
0004 to 0
0007 and a false-negative rate of 0
003 in the general public

 This test is not currently used in the US and EU to test blood donation, as it was intended to reduce the risk of false negative results in the window period
 neucleic acid pareekshan is kaary ke liye adhik upyogi he or eneti pareekshan karne par pi24 antigen pareekshan aajkal nahin kiya jaataa he
 The p24 antigen test is not useful for general screening because it has very low specificity and this test is used only in a short period of time before antibodies are formed against the p24 protein in the body after infection
