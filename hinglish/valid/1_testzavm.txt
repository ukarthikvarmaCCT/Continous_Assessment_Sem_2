 vatsal tathaa bhakthi inke sthaayee bhav hai
 Bhakti Rasa is considered to be the 11th Rasa
 This rasa has been established in the scripture "bhakti Rasa- Pahla Rasa or Eleventh Rasa" written by Vivek Sahni
 
 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni, while explaining Rasa, has said - arthath vibhaav, anubhav, vyabhichaari bhav ke sanyog se ras kii nishpatti hoti he
 It is said in the well-known literature mirror that when the permanent sense of the heart attains a combination of affect, feeling and communicable feeling, it disappears in the form of rasa
 reetikaal ke pramukh kavi dev ne ras kii paribhaasha in shabdon main kii he : Thus there are four parts of rasa - Permanent feeling, Vibhava, Anubhav and communicative feeling
 bhav kaa arth he:-hona In the conscience of the heart, the psyche which is always present in the form of lust or sanskar and which no opponent or antagonist can suppress, is called permanent emotion
 ye maanav man main beej rup main, chirkaal tak achanchal hokar nivas karte hai
 These represent the sacrament or spirit
 ye sabhi manushyon main usee prakaar chhipe rahete hai jaise mitti main gandh avichhinn rup main samaai rahati he
 They are so capable that they merge with other emotions
 inaki sankhya 11 he - rati, haas, shok, utsaah, krodh, bhay, jugupsa, vismay, nirved, vatsaltaur ishwar vishyak prem
 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray
 The character towards which a character's feelings are awakened is the subject
 sahitya shaastra main is vishay ko alamban vibhaav athwa 'alamban' kehete hai
 The character in which the emotions are awakened is called the shelter
 sthaayee bhav ko jaagrath rakhane main sahaayak kaaran uddipan vibhaav kehalaate hai
 As an example, the enemy standing standing in front of the zeal of Veer Ras is enthusiasm
 shatru ke saath sena, yuddh ke baaje or shatru kii darpoktiyaan, garjana-tarjana, shastr sanchaalan aadi uddipan vibhaav hai
 There are two types of stimulus effects: arthath alamban kii uktiyaan or cheshthaayen That is, objects related to the environment
 prakritik drishyon kii gananaa bhi inhen ke anrtgat hoti hai
 The gestures of shelter that illuminate or convey permanent expressions like Rati, Haas, Mourning etc
 are called Anubhav
 ye cheshtaaen bhav-jagriti ke uparaant aashray main utpann hoti hai isliye inhen anubhav kehete hai, arthath jo bhaavon kaa anugaman kare vah anubhav kehalaata he
 Anubhav has two distinctions - the intended and the unwilling
 alamban evam uddipan ke madhyam se apane-apane kaarnon dwaara utpann, bhaavon ko baahar prakashit karne vaali saamaanya lok main jo kaary cheshtaaen hoti hai, ve hi kavy naatak aadi main nibaddh anubhav kehalaati hai
 For example, filling the sighs by the Viraha-distraught hero, watching with tears, sweat, thrill, affection in the spirit of union, handling of arms when awakened, harsh speech, red eyes, etc
 will be called Anubhav
 saadhaaran anubhav : arthath ke chaar bhed hai

 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai
 The word sanchari means, to walk together, that is, to be transitive, communicable emotions are transmitted with a permanent emotion, they are capable enough that they can move in harmony with each permanent emotion
 isliye inhen vyabhichaari bhav bhi kaha jaataa he
 The number of communicable or adulterous expressions is considered 33 - Nirveda, guilt, doubt, Asuya, item, labor, laziness, lowliness, anxiety, fascination, memory, dhriti, vriada, chatliya, joy, impulse, inertia, pride, grief, sadness , Sleep, aphasma, dream, prabodh, amarsha, avhitha, raging, mati, disease, hysteria, death, tragedy and disarray
 bharatmuni ne kavy ke aavashyak tatv ke rup main ras kii pratishtha karte hue shringaar, hasya, raudra, karun, vir, adbhut, bibhats tathaa bhayanak naam se uske aath bhedon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he tathaa katipay panktiyon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii kalpana he ki unhone shant naamak nawein ras ko bhi sweekruti di he
 Navaras is the noun of these nine juices
 vibhavanubhav-sancharibhav ke sanyog se in rason kii nishpatti hoti he
 The permanence of each juice is different
 usee kii vibhavadi sanyog se paripurna honevaali nirvighn-pratiti-grahya avasthaa ras kehalaati he
 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's wrath, Karun's grief, valor's excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of beauty, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai
 Bharata has considered the origin of humor, compassion, wonderful and terrible rasa in the first eight rasas, considering Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatsa as the principal
 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati

 For example, the word 'asura' in Sanskrit was called 'ahur' there
 afghanistan ke baad sindhu nadi ke is paar hindustan ke puure ilaake ko pracheen farsi sahitya main bhi 'hind', 'hindush' ke naamon se pukaara gaya he tathaa yahan kii kisi bhi vastu, bhashaa, vichaar ko 'adjective' ke rup main 'hindik' kaha gaya he jiskaa matlab he 'hind kaa'
 This 'hindu' word from Arabic became 'indike', 'indika' in Greek, 'india' in Latin and 'india' in English
 arabi evam farsi sahitya main bharat main boli jane vaali bhashaaon ke liye 'zabaan-e-hindi', pad kaa upyog hua he
 After coming to India, arabic-persian speakers used 'zaban-e-hindi', 'hindi Juban' or 'hindi' to mean the language spoken around delhi-agra
 bharat ke gaiyr-muslim log to is kshetra main bole jane vaale bhashaa-rup ko 'bhakha' naam se pukaraate the, 'hindi' naam se nahin
 Linguists consider Hindi blog and Urdu as one language
 hindi devanagari lipi main likhi jaati he or shabdaawalee ke str par adhikanshat: sanskrit ke shabdon kaa prayog karti he

 It is classified under the Hindu Aryan sub-branch of the indo-iranian branch
 hind-arya bhashaayen wo bhashaayen hai jo sanskrit se utpann hui hai
 Languages like Urdu, Kashmiri, Bengali, Oriya, Punjabi, Romani, Marathi, Nepali are also indo-aryan languages
 hindi bhashaa kaa itihaas lagbhag ek hajaar varsh purana mana gaya he
 Knowledge of the Hindi language and literature acknowledges the emergence of Hindi from the last stage of apabhramsa 'avahath'
 chandradhar sharma guleri ne isi avahatth ko 'puraani hindi' naam diya
 The end of apostrophe and the time of birth of modern Indian languages can be transcendental 
 hindi kaa swaroop shauraseni or ardhamagadhi apbhranshon se viksit hua he
 Its independent power began to be introduced around 1000 AD, when the illiterate languages were being used in literary contexts
 yahi bhashaayen baad main viksit hokar aadhunik bhartiya arya bhashaaon ke rup main abhihit huin
 Whatever the form of apabhramsa was - it developed in modern dialects
 apbhransh ke sambandh main ‘deshi’ shabd kii bhi bahudhaa charchaa kii jaati he
 In fact, 'deshi' implies both the native word and the native language
 prashn yah ki deshiy shabd kis bhashaa ke the ? bharat muni ne naatyashaastra main un shabdon ko ‘deshi’ kaha he ‘jo sanskrit ke tatsam evam sadbhav roopon se bhinn he
 These 'native' words were popular words of the public language, which had also come into nature by nature
 janabhasha vyakaran ke niyamon kaa anusaran nahin karti, parantu vyakaran ko janabhasha kii pravritiyon kaa vishleshan karnaa padataa he, praakrit-vyakaranon ne sanskrit ke dhaanche par vyakaran likhe or sanskrit ko hi praakrit aadi kii prakruti mana
 Therefore, the words which could not get hold of their rules, they were given native nouns
 swatantraaa prapti ke baad se hindi or devanagari ke maanakeekaran kii disha main nimnlikhit kshetron main prayaas huye hai :- According to linguists, there are four major forms or styles of Hindi: hindi or urdu donon ko milakar hindustani bhashaa kaha jaataa he
 Hindustani is the spoken language of standardized Hindi and standardized Urdu

 Some of them have written very high-quality literature
 aisi boliyon main brajabhasha or avadhi pramukh hai
 These dialects are the diversity of Hindi and also its power
 ve hindi kii jadon ko gaharaa banaati hai
 There are dialects of Hindi and dialects of those dialects which not only contain a great tradition, history and civilization but also their creation against the freedom struggle, mass struggle, present-day marketism, and the world is conscious
 hindi kii boliyon main pramukh hai- avadhi, brajabhasha, kannauji, bundeli, bagheli, bhojpuri, haryaanavi, rajasthani, chhattisgadhi, maalavi, jharkhandi, kumaunni, magahi aadi
 But there are two main differences of Hindi - Western Hindi and Eastern Hindi
 hindi shabdaawalee main mukhyatah do varg hai- The Hindi in which the words of Arabic, Persian and English are almost completely removed and the corresponding words are used, is called "pure Hindi" or "standardized Hindi"
 devanagari lipi main hindi kii dhvaniyaan is prakaar hai : These voices have been given for modern Hindi
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Like GHG
 ye dhvaniyaan mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se liye gayi shabdon ke mul uccharan main hotin hai
 Their source is not Sanskrit
 devanagari lipi main ye sabase kareebi devanagari varna ke neeche bindu lagaakar likhe jate hai kintu hindi kii maanak vartanee main videshi shabdon ko bina nukte ke hi unke desikrut rup main likhane kii anushansha kii gayi he
 That is why people are now finding the practice of nukta in Hindi unnecessary and it is believed that nukte should be used only when the Arabic / Urdu / Persian people want to write their language in Devanagari
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai

 There are also many forms of the verb, which are replaced by suffixes and auxiliary verbs

 ek baar raja parakshit akhet hetu van main gayi
 He was distraught with thirst due to running after the wild animals and wandering around in search of the reservoir, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi
 vahaan par shamik rishi netra band kiye huye tathaa shantbhaav se ekasana par baithe huye brahmadhyaan main leen the
 King Parikshit asked for water from him but due to meditation, Shamik Rishi did not answer anything
 sir par swarna mukut par nivas karte huye kaliyug ke prabhaav se raja parakshit ko prathit hua ki yah rishi dhyansth hone kaa dhong kar ke meraa apmaan kar rahaa he
 He was very angry at the sage
 unhone apane apmaan kaa badla lene ke uddeshy se paas hi pade huye ek mrit sarp ko apane dhanush kii nonk se uthaa kar rishi ke gale main daal diya or apane nagar waapas aa gayi
 In Dari Nag sage throat, Nripe committed many sins
 honhaar ho kar huto, rungi dinhon shaap
 Shamik Rishi was absorbed in meditation and could not know what the king had done to him, but when his son Ringi Rishi came to know about this, he got very angry on King Parikshit
 rungi rishi ne sochaa ki yadi yah raja jivit rahegaa to isi prakaar brahmanon kaa apmaan karata rahegaa
 Thinking this way, that Rishikumar cursed King Parikshit by taking water from the mantle in his Anjuli and inviting him to the mantras that the Takshak snake will bite you on the seventh day from today
 kuch samay baad shamik rishi ke samadhi tuutane par unke putr rungi rishi ne unhen raja parakshit ke kukrity or apane shraap ke vishay main bataaya
 Hearing about the curse, the sage Shamik felt very sad and said - "oh fool! You have committed gross sin
 jaraa si galati ke liye tuune us bhagavatbhakt raja ko ghor shraap de daalaa
 The king has not deliberately done this act of putting a dead snake in my throat, at that time he was under the influence of Kali Yuga
 uske rajya main praja sukhi he or ham log nirbhiktapurvak jap, tap, yagyadi karte rahete hai
 Now, if the king is no longer, rebellion, racism will spread in the people and there will be an empire of unrighteousness
 yah raja shraap dene yogya nahin tha par tuune use shraap de kar ghor aparaadh kiya he
 Lest the king himself curse you, but i know that he is supremely knowledgeable and will never do so
 " Sage Shamik felt very sorry for his son's crime
 rajgrih main pahunch kar jab raja parakshit ne apana mukut utaara to kaliyug kaa prabhaav samaapt ho gaya or gyaan kii punah utpatti hui
 They started thinking that i had committed a terrible sin
 nirparaadh brahman ke kanth main mare huye sarp ko daal kar maine bahut bada kukrity kiya he
 In this way they were repenting that a disciple sent by sage Shamik came and told them that Rishikumar cursed you that from today on the seventh day Takshak Serpent will bite you
 raja parakshit ne shishy ko prasantaapurvak asana diya or bole - "rishikumar ne shraap dekar mujh par bahut bada upkaar kiya he
 i also wish that a sinner like me should be punished for my sin
 aap rishikumar ko meraa yah sandesh pahunchaa dijiye ki main unke is krupa ke liye unka atyant abhaari hoon
 "after paying proper respect to that disciple and apologizing, King Parikshit left
 raja parakshit ne apane jivan ke shesh saat din ko gyaan prapti or bhagavatbhakti main vyateet karne kaa sankalp kar liya
 The coronation of his able son Janamejaya was done and, leaving all the royal robes and wearing only rip-cloth, sat on the banks of the Ganges
 apni samast aasaktiyon ko tyaag kar bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra kii bhakthi main swayan ko leen kar liya
 Hearing about this sacrifice and fast, Atri, Vashistha, Chyavan, Arishtanemi, Shardwan, Parashar, Angira, Bhrigu, Parashurama, Vishvamitra, Indramad, Utthya, Medhatithi, Deval, Maitreya, Pippalad, Gautama, Bharadwaja, Kandav, Kandav Agastya, Narada, Ved Vyas, etc
 The sages, Maharishi and Devarshi, along with their disciples, read their darshan
 raja parakshit ne un sabhi kaa yathochit samyaanukool satkar karke unhen asana diya, unke charnon kii vandana kii or kaha - "yah meraa param saubhaahgya he ki aap jais devtaa tulya rishiyon ke darshan praapt huye
 i have committed a crime against the supremely brilliant Brahmin by falling under the power of power, yet you have bothered to come here to see me, this is the greatness of you
 meri ichha he ki main apane jivan ke shesh saat dinon kaa sadupyog gyaan prapti or bhagavatbhakti main karuun
 Therefore, i request you all to tell me the easy way on which i can reach God by walking
 " Hearing the words of King Parikshit, everyone was very happy and decided to fulfill his wish as appropriate
 usee samay vahaan par vyas rishi ke putr, janm mrityu se rahit paramgyani shri shukdev ji padhaare
 King Parikshit along with all the sages stood up in his honor and bowed to him
 uske baad ardhya, paadya tathaa maala aadi se surya ke samaan prakaashmaan shri shukdev ji kii puja kii or baithne ke liye ucchasana pradaan kiya
 After his sitting, other sages also sat on their respective seats
 sabhi ke asana grahan karne ke pashchaat raja parakshit ne madhur vaani main kaha - "he brahmroop yogeshwar! he mahabhag! bhagwaan narayan ke sammukh aane se jis prakaar daitya bhaag jate hai usee prakaar aapke padhaarney se mahaan paap bhi avilamb bhaag khadey hote hai
 Darshan of Yogeshwar like you is very rare, but you yourself appeared at the time of my death and appeared to my sinner and freed me from all my sins
 aap yogiyon ke bhi guru hai, aapane param siddhi praapt kii he
 So please tell me what is the duty for a dead animal? He should listen to which story, which god should he chant, ritual, remembrance and bhajan and what things should be discarded? samast rishiyon ne raja parakshit ke in prashnon ke poochne ke liye sadhuwaad diya or unke prashnon ke uttar dene ke liye mahayogi shri shukdev ji se aagrah kiya
 The knowledgeable scholar of all religions, Shri Shukdev ji, who has attained Brahmanism from the Paramhansa Vrat by abandoning the Maya of this world since the time of umbilical perforation, agreed to answer his questions
 mahayogeshwar shri shukdev ji bole - "he raja parakshit! ek raja hone ke naate tum apane kalyaan ke saath hi saath sabhi ke kalyaan kii chintaa rahati he isiliye tumne yah ati uttam prashn kiya he
 This will definitely benefit your welfare as well as others
 manushya janm lene ke pashchaat sansar ke mayajaal main fas jaataa he or use manushya yoni kaa vaastavik laabh praapt nahin ho paata
 Her day work is spent in business and night sleep and in female context
 agyani manushya stri, putr, sharir, dhan, sampatti sambandhiyon aadi ko apana sab kuch samaj baithta he
 The idiot is mad like a madman and is afraid of his death in his fascination, but in the end, dies away
 manushya ko mrityu ke aane par bhaybheet tathaa vyakul nahin hona chaiye
 At that time, one should remove all attachment by taking disinterest from his knowledge
 apni indriyon ko vash main karke unhen sansaarik vishay vaasanaon se hataakar chanchal man ko deepak kii lau ke samaan sthir kar lenaa chaiye
 In the middle of all this process, you should keep on chanting continuously so that the mind does not wander here and there
 is prakaar dhyaan karte karte man bhagwat prem ke anand se bhar jaataa he
 Then the mind does not move away from there
 yadi mudh man rajogun or tamogun ke kaaran sthir na rahe to sadhak ko vyakul na ho kar dhire dhire dhairya ke saath use apane vash main karne kaa upaay karnaa chaiye
 With the same yoga perception, the yogi gets visions of God in his heart and attains devotion
 " King Parikshit asked - "O mahabhaga! What is the notion that quickly removes the ignorant filth and how is that perception done?" unke is prashn ke uttar main shri shukdev ji ne kaha - "he parakshit! yoga kii sadhana karne vaale sadhak ko sabase pehle apnesharir ko vash main karne ke liye yathochit asana main baithna chaiye
 After that, to control the power of action, a means of pranayama should be done
 saath hi saath vishay evam kaamanaayon ko tyaag kar indriyon ko apane niyantran main karnaa chaiye
 Then, using knowledge, the mind should be encapsulated from around it in such a way that the tortoise covers its head and legs
 itnaa karne ke pashchaat bhagwaan ke viraat rup kaa dhyaan karnaa chaiye
 He should understand that the five cosmos, ego and nature, such as water, air, fire, sky, path, etc
 These whole cosmic universe covered by these seven positions are the body of God, he is wearing them all

 Both of these processes of producing X-rays are very inefficient, their output capacity is only around one percent and, therefore, the electric power that can be entered as input, to produce a usable current of X-rays a high percentage of k is released as waste heat

 To make an image of an X-ray of human or animal bones, short X-rays flutter illuminate the body or part and a radiographic film is placed behind it
 upasthit koi bhi asthiyaan prakaash vidyut prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re ke adhikansh photon ko avashoshit kar leti hai
 This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues
 bvfget X-rays are detected based on various methods
 sabase adhik aam taur par jane jane vaale tareeke - photographic plate, casette main photographic film or durlabh prithvi screen hai
 They are all classified as "image receptors" regardless of the elements involved in the image
 digital computer ke aagaman or digital imaging ke avishkaar se pehle adhikansh radiographic chitra utpann karne ke liye photographic platon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 These paintings were produced entirely on glass plates
 photographic filmon ne bade paimaane par in platon kii jagah le lee or chikitsiya chitron ko utpann karne ke liye eks-re prayogshaalaon main iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography is being used in place of photographic film in medical and dental applications, although film technology is still widely used in industrial radiography processes
 Photographic plates are mostly a matter of history, and the "intensifying screen" that replaces them is also becoming dull in history
 dhaatu chaandi ek gaiyr navikarniya sansaadhan he
 It is thus profitable that it is now being replaced by digital and computerized technology
 jahaan photographic filmon ke liye geeli prasanskaran suvidhaon kii jarurat padati thi, vahiin in nai praudyogikiyon ke liye yah sab jaruri nahin he
 Digital storage of images using these new technologies also saves storage space
 chunki photographic plate, eks-re ke prati samvedansheel hote hai, atah ve chitra ko record karne kaa ek saadhan pradaan karte hai, lekin unhen bahut zyada eks-re anaavaran kii bhi jarurat padati he, isliye intencyfoing screen ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 They provide a much lower volume to the patient, as the screen receives X-rays and increases its intensity, so that it can be recorded on film placed next to the intensifying screen
 rogi ke jis ang se eks-re ko pravaahit karnaa he, use eks-re strot or image receptor ke bich rakhaa jaataa he jisase sharir ke keval usee vishesh ang kii aatanrik sanrachana kii chaaya utpann ho sake
 These X-rays are partially blocked by dense tissue such as bone and pass through soft tissues very easily
 jin-jin kshetron se hokar ye eks-re guzarati hai, ve kshetra develop karne par gaharaa rang dhaaran kar lete hai, jisase asthiyaan aas-paas ke utakon kii tulana main thodi halke rang kii dikhaai padati hai
 Unlike compounds containing barium or iodine, which are radiopaque, can be ingested into the gastrointestinal tract or inserted into arteries or veins to expose these vessels
 in vipareet yogicon main ucch parmanvik sankhyayukta tatv hote hai jo anivaary rup se eks-re ko avaruddha kar dete hai or isliye ek baar khokhale ang yaa vahini ko or adhik aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 In the search for a non-toxic contrast material, several types of high atomic number elements were evaluated
 udaahranarth, hamaare purvajon ne pehali baar jis nirupan kaa prayog kiya, vah chaak tha or iskaa prayog ek shav kii nalikaaon par kiya gaya tha
 Unfortunately, some selected elements proved to be harmful - for example, thorium was used as a means of representation - which in some cases became toxic
 Modern formulations have improved, and while there is no way to determine who has sensitivity to the formulation, the incidence of "allergic reactions" is very low
 ek uttarottar badhata hua aam tarika photostimulated luminecense ) kaa istemaal he jisaki shuruyaat 1980 ke dashak main fuji ne kii thi
 Photostimulable phosphor plates are used in modern hospitals instead of photographic plates
 plate par eks-re pravaahit karne ke baad, fosfar padaarth ke utsahit electron tab tak crystal jaalak ke "rang kendron" main "fanse" rahete hai jab tak plate kii sataha se guzarane vaale leisure beam dwaara unhen uttejit nahin kar diya jaataa
 leisure uttejnaa ke dauraan mukt prakaash ko ek photomultiplir tub dwaara ikaitha kar liya jaataa he or parinami sanket ko computer praudyogiki dwaara ek digital image main parivartit kar diya jaataa he, jo is prakriya ko iskaa aam naam, computerikrut radiography, pradaan karata he 
 piespi plate ko phir se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, or unhen istemaal karne ke liye maujuuda eks-re upkaran main koi sanshodhan karne kii zarurat nahin hoti
 Initially, the most common detection methods were based on ionization of gases, such as in the Geiger – Müller counter: a sealed volume, typically a cylinder, with a gas, cylindrical cathode in a mica, polymer or thin metallic window, and a wire is anode; High voltage is passed between the cathode and the anode
 jab ek eks-re photon silinder main pravesh karti he, to yah gaiyr kaa ynikaran karti he or yanon va electronon kaa nirmaan karti he
 In this process, electrons move rapidly towards the anode, leading to further ionization along their trajectory
 tounsand avelinch ke naam se jane jaani vaali is prakriya kaa pataa ek aakasmik dhara ke rup main lagaaya jaataa he jise ek "ginati" yaa "ghatana" kaha jaataa he
 To obtain energy spectral information, a diffractible crystal can first be used to separate the different photons
 is vidhi ko wavelength dispersive eks-re spectroscopy kaha jaataa he
 Position-sensitive detectors with diffuse elements are often used
 swaabhaavik rup se urja kaa samaadhaan karne vaale anya pahchaan upkarnon, jaise - purvacharchit samaanupatik counter, kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In either case, the use of appropriate pulse-processing devices allows the creation of digital spectra for later analysis
