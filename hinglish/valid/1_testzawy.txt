 According to tradition and tradition, some people have considered Madhya Pradesh and Kajangal and the region between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas or the Aryavarta as the Aryabhoomi of Aryans

 mentioned in the Rigveda
 bahut se europea vidvan or unke anuyaayi bhartiya vidvan ab bhi bhartiya aaryon ko baahar se aayaa hua maanate hai
 Now the theory of Aryans coming from outside India has been proved wrong
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan karke angrez or europea log bharatiyon main yah bhaavana bharna chaahate the ki bhartiya log pehle se hi gulam hai
 Apart from this, the British wanted to divide it between North Indians and South Indians

 According to Arvind Ghosh, the Aryans used to protect friends and destroy enemies, but they did not have attachment in it
 ve sarvatra, sab praaniyon main, sab vastuon main, karmon main or fal main ishwar ko dekh kar isht-anisht shatru-mitra sukh-dukh tathaa siddhi-asiddhi main sambhaav rakhte the

 The friend's help and defeat of the enemy were his efforts but he did not hate the enemy and also did not tolerate the friend's injustice
 arya log to kartavya ke anurodh se swajanon kaa sanhaar bhi karte the or vipakshiyon ki praan raksha ke liye yuddh bhi karte the
 He was the one to remove sin and accumulate virtue, but did not take pride in virtue and did not cry when he became impure in sin, but purified the body and became aware of self-promotion
 arya log karm ki siddhi ke liye vipul prayaas karte the or hajaaron baar vifal hone par bhi virat nahin hote the evam asiddhi main dukhi hona unke liye adharm tha
 The principle of Aryan invasion has been continuously changing since its rest days

 At this time, an English captain named Brunton educated Yusuf Khan, making him a well-versed figure in many languages

 Under Major Stringer Lawrence, Yusuf Khan was trained in the European method of warfare and his natural talent in military strategy and tactics blossomed to full potential

 Thomas Arthur was later to describe to Lally the role of Nellore Subedar's soldier in these words: "they were like flies, not soon defeated by one part, they came from another
 " By 1760, Yusuf Khan had reached the 'sarva Vijay' military commandant for the entirety of his career
 
 His greatest supporter during this period was the English Governor George Pigot in Madras

 Going back to 1734, when Madurai Nayaka King Vijaya Ranga Chokkanath Nayaka died in 1731, he was led by his widow, Queen Meenakshi, who acted as the queen-regent on behalf of a young boy who was adopted as the heir to her dead husband

 a few years later Chanda Sahib violated the agreement with the queen and took control of Madurai, arresting the helpless queen Meenakshi at the rock-fort at Trichy

 After the death of Chanda Sahib at the end of the Carnatic War, the Madurai Empire came under Mohammed Ali control, which in turn gave the tax collection rights of the entire Madura Empire to the British, who borrowed huge sums of money from them

 The British considered polygamy as a rival power and regarded them as their tyrannical enemies, allowing their hostility to be fully expressed in their accounts
 rajasav ke liye utsuk east india company ne jis tareeke se poligars logon se kar ekatra kiye, us tareeke or paimaane kaa virodh kiya
 The issue of taxation, more specifically, to collect it, traditional rulers or terrible new collectors from abroad, was at the root of the latter rebellion

 In 1755 the Nawab and the British had legitimate reasons to crush these rebellious polygars, sending a large army south under Colonel Heron and Arcot Nawabs brother Mahfuz Khan, with Yusuf Khan as bodyguard
 mahfuj khan or karnal heron ne kai gaanvon ko jala diya or kai mandiron ko dharashayi kar diya, phir hindu mandiron se kai durlabh murtiyon ko pighalane, kai shaharon ko tod diya or lut liya
 This cruel Yusuf Khan, who lodged a complaint with the British

 During this time the French surrounded the British fort at Madras under Thomas Arthur Lally

 In 1756, March Yusuf Khan was sent to Madurai to collect taxes and restore order

 At this time Yusuf Khan arrived with 400 soldiers to take control of Madurai, showing his talent in defeating the large army of Barkadathulla, with Barkaduthulla escaping from the Sivaganga land and the Fakir out of the city

 Yusuf Khan immediately restored the land back to the temple, and by the spring of 1795 he began by teaching Kallan a good lesson
 apane jangal ke madhyam se margon ko katate hue, unhone bina kisi dayaa ke unhen goli maar di, jaise ve bhaag gaye, yaa narsanhaar karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko kaidi bana liya gaya
 He went on to command the rest of the country, and soon surrounded all of Polygar's various methods and made himself extremely powerful
 iske alaava unhone haidar ali dwaara kshatigrast tanks, jhiilon or kilon kaa punarnirmaan kiya, kanoon or vyavastha behaal kar diya
 So far they have increased revenue to the Nawab and the British treasury
 is samay ke dauraan yusuf khan ne puri thevar ke saath ladaai kii, jo nerkatttesewal kaa ek poligar tha, jo madurai ke dakshin-pashchim main ek chota sa shahar tha
 Puli Thevar revolted against the Nawab and the British
 yusuf khan ne travnakor raja or puli thevar ke bich gathbandhan tod diya, jo travnakor ke raja ko arkot nawab ke saath gathbandhan samjhaute main pravesh karne ke liye vishwaas dilaate the
 Yusuf Khan captured the forts of some Puli Thevars, which had previously been unsuccessfully tried by the British and Nawab forces under Mohammad Ali
 1760 main, netkattansewal yaa puli thevar yuddh ke liye yuddh par, yusuf khan ko puli thevar ke haathon apmanjanak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It has been historically recorded through local legends and folk songs which say that Yusuf Khan and his forces were literally driven away from Netakattanseval and chased all the way to the outskirts of Madurai by Puli Thevar and his forces
 it was done
 lekin baad main 1761 main, jab british east india company ke adhik unnat sainya hathiyaar ke saath lagbhag das hajaar majboot paidal sena ko puli thevar ke keval do hajaar majboot paidal sena ke khilaaf niojit kiya gaya tha, jo keval kaansya yug ke hathiyaar jaise lans or talwaar se las the, puli thevar ko pakadaa gaya tha lekin keval ek krur ladaai ke baad
 Puli Thevar's army though small in size and less advanced in terms of weapons caused severe casualties on the Nawab and Company forces
 kabja karne par, puli thevar ko shankarkovil ko bheja gaya jahaan unhen faansee ke liye yojana banaai gai thi
 However, Puli Thevar later escaped from Sankarakovil and is believed to have vanished upon escaping with further information about him
 
 Also during this time the Dutch captured the town of Alvartirungari, to which Yusuf Khan retaliated by chasing them back to their ships anchored in Tuticorin
 yusuf khan kii shandaar jeet kii report ab arcot nawab ko irshyaa or alarm se bhar gai he ki vah use chhod saktaa he

 To make matters worse, the Nawab's brother Mahfaz Khan started planning to poison Yusuf Khan with the whole-hearted support of the Nawab
 1761 main, or phir 1762 main, unhone tinveli or madura ko prati varsh saat lakh se chaar saal ke liye patte par dene kii peshkash kii
 His offer was refused, and whether he was angry at it, or whether he considered himself powerful enough to humiliate his master, he soon threw off his allegiance and in his ambition to be the lord of Madurai The soldiers started gathering

 The Nawab in turn sent the British to Captain

 The Arcot Nawab and the British soon acted by gathering a huge army
 shuruyaat ke liye unhone yusuf khan ke khilaaf travnakor raja ko uksaaya 
 In the ensuing war, the Travancore kings were defeated and the British flag was sliced and burned in their domain, and the French joined hands and hoisted the French flag at Madura Fort
 jab madras main ab governor saundar ne khan sahib ko ek baithak ke liye bulaayaa, to unhone east india company ke krodh ko ujagar karne se inkaar kar diya
 So far, Shah of Delhi and Nizam Ali of Hyderabad, Arcot Nawab officials declared Yusuf Khan as the rightful legal governor of the Madurai and Tirunelveli regions
 jabaki arket nawab british ke saath yusuf khan ko pakadaney or maarane kaa kaaran dhundne ke liye narak the
 After turning the tables against most of them, Yusuf Khan had to hide enemies around him everywhere

 Now Tanjore, Travancore, Pudukkottai, Ramnad, Sivaganga Empire joined with the British and Arcot Nawab to attack Yusuf Khan, who by this time had declared independent rulers of Madurai and Tirunelveli
 1763 main madurai kii pehali gheraabandi main, angreji aparyaapt balon kii vajah se koi rasta nahin bana sakaa or sena monsoon kaa hawala dete hue tiruchi se peeche hat gai

 Sentenced to death
 1764 main phir se british sainikon ne madurai kile se ghira, is baar kile ko aapurti kaat diya
 So Yusuf Khan and his forces went inside the fort for several days without food and water but with great energy and skill, renewed and strengthened the En Fort at great expense, and with the loss of replica 120 Europeans killed the main attack And were injured
 us samay ke ant main unke khilaaf choti vaastavik pragati kii gai thi, sivaay iske ki jagah ab kathor rup se avaruddh ho gai thi
 Meanwhile, Arcot Nawab consulted Sivaganga General Thandavaraira Pillai, along with Major Charles Campbell, plotting a treacherous plot to bribe Yusuf Khan's Dewan Srinivasa Rao, the French mercenary captain and captain of Khan's doctor Baba Sahib
 ek subah, jab yusuf khan kile ke andar apni prarthanaaon kii peshkash kar rahaa tha, marchnd, shrinivas raav or baba sahib chupchaap chale gaye or yusuf khan ko jameen par pin kiya or apni pagadi kaa upyog karke use baandh liya
 Hearing this excitement, a young girl named Mudali, close to Yusuf Khan, raised the alarm
 vah jaldi pakadaa gaya or cat gaya
 As news of the coup reached Yusuf Khan's wife, she arrived at the scene with a small section of soldiers
 lekin ve acchhee tarah se sashastr french or anya europea bhaade ke khilaaf asahaay the, girane vaale shaasha ke chaaron ore guard khadey the
 Under cover of darkness and a deep veil of secrecy, Marchand drove Yusuf Khan out of the fort and handed him over to Major Charles Campbell, who commanded the British amid a siege

 The next day, on the evening of 15 October 1764, on the madurai-dindigul road near the army camp at Samutipuram, Yusuf Khan was hanged as a rebel by Mohammad Ali Khan Waljah, the Nawab of Argot
 yah jagah madura ke pashchim main lagbhag do mile kii duuri par he, jise dabedaar chandai kaha jaataa he, or uske sharir ko jagah par dafnaaya gaya tha
 What motive forced the three main conspirators, who were close confidants of Yusuf Khan, to betray him? It is said that Yusuf Khan once threw Marchand with a whip and so he was waiting for a suitable time for revenge
 yah bhi sambhav he ki kile ke andar logon or sainikon ke atyadhik dukh ne yusuf khan ke chikitsak dewan shrinivas raav or baba sahib ko majaboor kar diya ho taaki ve yusuf khan ko angreji main saunp saken, unhen gheraabandi uthaao or logon ko apni teevr pidaa or pidaa se chhutkaaraa dilaaein
 He would have imagined that Yusuf Khan would be sentenced to brief imprisonment and / or fine as a confinement and later released

 The short story is that the first two attempts on the gallows after snatching the rope failed and only the third attempt was successful

 Srinivasa Rao must have felt that the little boy had a better chance of living there as the people were kindly disposed towards Yusuf Khan; He once saved Alwarthirungari a few years before the Dutch invasion
 masa kii aakhri ichha ke anusaar, or gopneeyata banaae rakhane ke liye, shrinivas raav ne ladke maathuranaigam naam diya or use isai dharm main laayaa

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel

 basal gangliya rishadhari jeevon ke mastishk main sthit vibhinn mul ke nabhikon kaa ek samooh he jo ek sanyukt kaaryaatmak ikai ke rup main kaary sampadan karte hai
 They are located in the base region of the anterior part of the brain and are strongly connected to the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and other areas of the brain
 basal gangliya vibhinn kaaryon se jude hote hai, jiname svaichhik gatishiltaa niyantran, dainik aacharan athwa "aadaton" se sambandhit prakriyaatmak shikshan, aankh kii halchal, sangyanatmak evam bhavuk kaary shaamil hai
 Currently popular theories consider the basal ganglia primarily responsible for action selection, that is, deciding which of the various possible behaviors to take place at a time
 prayogtmak adhyayan darshaate hai ki basal gangliya kai gatisheel tantron par nirodhatmak prabhaav daalate hai or is nirodhi prabhaav ke hatate hi gatisheel tantra sakriy ho jaataa he
 The "change of behavior" in the basal ganglia is influenced by signals transmitted from several parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex that plays an important role in executive function
 basal gangliya ke mukhya ghatak hai- striatum jise neostriatum bhi kehete hai or jo codet evam putamin se bana hota he, globas palids yaa palidam jo globas palids eksterna yaa globas palids interna se bana hota he, substanshia nigra jo substanshia nigra pars compecta evam substanshia nigra pars reticulata se milakar bana hota he or sabathalemic nabhik 
 striatum, jo sabase bada ghatak he, kai mastishk kshetron se input praapt karata he lekin keval basal gangliya ke anya ghatakon ko hi output bhejtaa he
 The pallidum receives the most important input from the striatum and sends several regions related to inhibitory output dynamics, including the portion of the thalamus that elevates the dynamics-related regions of the cortex
 reticulata jo substenshia nigra kaa ek bhaag he, vah palidam kii hi tarah kaary karata he, evam compecta naamak doosraa hissaa striatum ko neuro transmeter dopamin strot kaa input pradaan karata he
 The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cortex and transports part of the pallidum
 in kshetron main se prayek main ek aantarik sanrachanaatmak or neuro-rasinic sanghathan hota he
 The basal ganglia play a central role in various neural states, including many mobility disorders
 sabase ullekhneey hai, parkingsanse rog, jisame substenshia nigra par compecta main melanin pigmented dopamin utpaadak koshikaon kaa patan hota he or hantingtons vikaar jisame multah striatum kshatigrast hoti hai
 Some behavioral control disorders also include dysfunctional states of the basal ganglia, such as, in Torret's syndrome, belismus, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Wilson's disease
 The neuro pathology mechanisms related to Parkinson's disorder and Huntington's disorder apart from Wilson's disease and Hemi bellismus disorder have not been properly understood or are still in the developing theoretical state
 basal gangliya main ek haath-pairon ki tarah dikhaai dene vaala kshetra hota he jiske avyavon ko alag - alag naam die gaye hai- nabhik ekambence, ventral palidam or ventral tegmental kshetra 
 afferents nabhik ekambence ko usee tarah dopamin pradaan karte hai jis tarah substanshia nigra dorcel striatum ko dopamin pradaan karti he
 Since there is a lot of evidence indicating that it has a central role in rare studies, the dopaminergic projection of VTA → NA has attracted a large number of attention
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai atyadhik nashe vaali davaayen jinamein cocaine, amphitamins evam nicotine sammilit hai, inke bare main samajha jaataa he ki ve vitie → ene dopamin sanket ki prabhavakaarita ko badhaakar kaary sampadan karti he
 There is also evidence that VTA → NA dopaminergic projection in insanity is effective upon over-stimulation

 The said primary cavities are formed during the normal development of the neural tube in the human embryo and initially consist of a rostral to caudal orientation - the procensipheles, mesencephals, and robensipheles
 Later, during the development of the nervous system, each section is converted into smaller components
 nimna talika is vikasaatmak vargeekaran ko darshaati he or basal gangliya main pai jane vaali sharir sanrachana tak anugaman karti he
 : basal gangliya tellencifelone kaa ek buniyadi avyav he
 In contrast, the layer of cortics lining the surface of the forebrain, while the basal ganglia, a distinctly visible group of gray matter, is located near the confluence of the thalamus at the depth of the brain
 mastishk ke adhikansh bhaagon kii tarah, basal gangliya main bhi baayein or daayen paksh hote hai jo ki ek duusare ki abhaasi chhaviyon ke rup main hote he
 From the anatomical point of view, anatomists have divided the basal ganglia into four distinct structures and this division depends on how well the said structures are rostral: two of them ie the striatum and the pallidum are relatively large, the other Two, ie the substencia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are small structures in shape
 dayee ore ke udhaaharan main, maanav mastishk ke do kapaal anubhag maanchitr main basal gangliya ke avyavon kii sthiti darshaayi jaati he
 As a note, it is clarified that, as seen in the above map, the subthalamic nucleus and the substencia are located very posterior to the nigra brain
 striatum basal gangliya kaa sabase bada avyav he
 Stripes are seen when the structure of the striatum is cut in certain directions, many of which appear to be the origin of small and large nerve fibers, hence the term "striatum" is used
 purv ke sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne maanav mastishk kaa pareekshan kar samajha tha ki striatum do bhinn-bhinn padaarthon se bana he jinhen aantarik capsule naamak shwet padaarth ke vistaar se pruthak kiya gaya he
 He named these two substances as cadet and putamen
 Modern anatomy scientists concluded by microscopic and neurochemical studies that it is reasonable to consider these substances as two separate parts of the same structure i
e
 the striatum, just as a river separates a city into two
 
 codet evam putamin ki bich kai kaaryaatmak antaron ki pahchaan kii gai he, kintu inhen un tathyon kaa parinaam samajha gaya jinke tahat striatum ke har ek kshetra anivaary rup se pramastishk cortex ke vishisht bhaagon se jude hue paae gaye hai
 The striatum's internal organization is exceptionally complex
 isamen bahutansh neurons "madhyam kantedaar neurons", kism ke hai
 They are gabaergic cells whose cell bodies are small and dendrites are covered with dense dendritic thorns that receive synaptic input from the cortex and thalamus
 neuro rasayan evam jodne ke tareeke ke aadhaar par madhyam kantedaar neurons ko kai tareekon se upaprakaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The next most multi-numbered type, with large, smooth dendrites, are cholinergic intraurons
 anya or bhi kai prakaar ke aantarik neurons hai, jo neural aabaadi ke chote bhaag hai
 Several studies have shown that there have usually been topographic relationships between the cortex and the striatum, that is, each part of the cortex sends strong input to some part of the striatum, followed by others
 sthalakriti kii prakruti ko samajhnaa mushkil he, lekin, shaayad kuch hisse main kyonki striatum kaa sanghathan teen ayaamon main yojit kiya gaya he jabaki cortex, ek starit sanrachana ke rup main, do main yojit he
 This dimensional discrepancy leads to large amounts of deformation and separation when mapping one structure to another
 dilachasp he ki, vahi sthalakriti sambandh thilemus striatal ke liye lagu hote he
 Pallidum is a large structure called globus pallidus that is located with a small abdominal planar expansion, called the ventral pallidum
 globas palids ekal tantrika padaarth ke rup main prathit hota he, lekin kaaryaatmak bhinnata ke chalate do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, un hisson ko aantarik bahya khand kaha jaataa he, evam sankshipt main jipiai or jipei bhi kehete hai
 Both segments originally contain gabaergic neurons, which show inhibitory effects on their targets
 ukt do khand alag-alag tantrika paripathon main bhaag lete hai
 The input to the outer segment or GPE is predominantly from the striatum and is projected onto the subthalamus nucleus
 aantarik khand, yaa jipiai, ko do pathon ke madhyam cestrtum dwaara sanket praapt hote hai, jinhen "pratyaksh" or "apratyaksh" path kaha jaataa he
 Pallidal neurons function using a "non-inhibitory" principle
 ukt neurons input ke abhaav main sthir ucch dar se prakshepit hote hai or striatum dwaara sanket ke chalate ve "tehraav" kii sthiti main aa jate hai
 Since the pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the total effect of the input received to the pallidum is reflected in the controlled inhibition exhibited by the pallidal cells on the targets
 sabstantia nigra basal gangliya ke ek missenciphelic grey padaarth kaa bhaag he jo esaenar or esensi main vibhajit he
 Often the SNR works in harmony with the GPI and the SNR - GPI complex performs the anti-function of the thalamus
 sabstantia nigra pars compecta neuro transmeter dopamin kaa nirmaan karata he jo ki striatal path kaa santulan banane main kaaphi mahatvapurn hota he
 The circuit below explains the role and circuit of the components of the basal ganglia
 sabathalemic nabhik, basal gangliya kaa ek diencefelic grey padaarth he, evam yah gangliya kaa ekmaatr hissaa he jo vastav main "uttejk" glutamic amla transmeter banaata he
 The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNR-GPI complex and is also a part of the "indirect pathway"
 basal gangliya ke jatil paripath ko samajhane ke liye, hamen sarvapratham paripath ke mahatvapurn bhagidaaron ko jaananaa aavashyak he
 The basal ganglia are in direct contact with the thalamus and cortex
 isiilie, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit paripath main cortex, thilemus or basal gangliya, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit teen mukhya bhagidaar hote hai
 The human brain is responsible for the cortex, the highest state of power, and conscious perception of the world
 tantrika tantra dwaara pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se kiye gaye sabhi kaary cortex se sambandhit hai
 Many different areas of the cortex perform different functions
 pre-central gaeres cortex kaa aisa hi ek bhaag he jise "motor cortex" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Specific neurons of the motor cortex region of the cortex extend their axons to the striatum portion of the basal ganglia
 ukt cortics ke neurons neurotransmeter glutamet chhodte hai, jo uttejk prakruti kaa hota he
 After being excited by glutamate, cells located in the striatum project in two different directions to form two major pathways - the "direct" and "indirect" circuits
 pratyaksh paripath main cortex dwaara ek baar uttejit hone par, striatum kii koshikaayen nirodhi neurons naamak neuro transmeter nirmit karti hai) esaenar -jipiai complex koshikaon, par prakshepit karti he
 snrs and gpis are intended to exert inhibitory effects on the thalamus while being continuously in contact with the thalamus, creating the GABA
 esaenar -jipiai ke nirodhatmak prabhaav ke chalate antim nishkarsh swarup thilemus par nirodhatmak prabhaav kaa lop hota he
 It is interesting to note that the thalamus itself projecting on the cortex continuously stimulates the cortex by glutamate
 isiilie, pratyaksh paripath ke chalate thilemus ko anumati praapt hoti he ki vah cortex ko uttejit kare
 uttejit hone ke baad cortex yah "uttejnaa" sandesh motor paripath ko parshv cortico spinal tract ke madhyam se mansapeshiyon tak pahunchaata he, jiske falswaroop ati gatij vyavhaar najar aata he
 The following diagram shows the "direct" route: cortex - -> striatum - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> At the opposite end there is an indirect circuit that starts from the neurons of the striatum
 striatum main sthit neurons ke samooh cortex dwaara prerit hote hi ab nirodhi eksans globas palids eksterna ki koshikaon ko nirodhi sanket prasaarit karte hai
 gpes show persistent anticonvulsant effects to the subthalamic nucleus
 nirodhak dwaara nirodhi prabhaav ke chalate estn vastav main uttejit ho jate hai
 As a result, stns also spontaneously stimulate the complex SNR-GPI, where the main function of the SNR-GPI complex is to have an antagonistic effect on the thalamus
 iske falswaroop antat thilemus kaa vaastavik nirodh hokar thilemus dwaara cortex ko utejit karne kii kriya main kami hona, hota he
 As a result, the cortex contributes to the hypercritical position or loss of movement, by stimulating the muscles through the lateral cortico spinal tract
 sankshep main, pratyaksh or apratyaksh paripath kaary sampadan main paraspar virdohi hote hai

 This paradox is diagnosed by the implementation of the substra nigra pars compacta that produce dopamine
 dopamine se basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 1 receptors uttejit ho "pratyaksh" path ko madad karte hai, jabaki basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 2 receptors par dopamine se nirodhi prabhaav utpann hota he evam vastav main "apratyaksh path" ko madad karata he
 In this way, the body creates a balanced position by keeping pace between motion and its absence

 The naming of the basal ganglia and its components has always been problematic

 The term "basal" stems from the fact that most of its elements are located in the basal part of the forebrain
 gangliya shabd mithyaa naam he: aadhunik upyog main maatr paridhiy tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko hi "gangliya" se sambodhit kiya jaataa jabaki kendriya tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko "nabhik" kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, the basal ganglia are sometimes also known as the "basal nucleus"
 terminologia anatomica, jo ki sharir sanrachana namakaran ke liye antarrashtriya praadhikrut sanstha he, ne "nabhik beselis" naam sujhaayaa he jo ki saamanytah upyog main nahin liya jaataa
 The International Basal Ganglia Society informally believes that the basal ganglia are made up of the striatum, pallidum, substensia nigra and subthalamic nucleus
 percheron aadi ne 1991 main or parent and parent ne 2005 main thilemus ke madhya bhaag ko basal gangliya ke ek bhaag ke rup main sammilit kiya, jabaki mena-segovia aadi ne 2004 main pedunculopontine complex ko bhi sammilit kiya
 In addition, the names given to different nuclei of the basal ganglia vary
 vishesh rup se, aadi maanav ke globas palids ke andruni khand ko mushakon main antopeduncular nabhik kaha jaataa he
 Etc
 The outer segment of "striatum" and "globus pallidus" in humans are called "palaeostriatum augmentatum" and "palaeostriatum primitivum", respectively, in birds

 One of the most studied works of basal ganglia is the role of basal ganglia in eye movements
 a wide network of brain regions affects the movement / movement of the eyes, which is centered in an area called the superior cauliculus of the middle brain
 essi ek starit sanrachana he jiske str drishy sthal ke do aiami nakshe banaate hai
 a "bump" of neural activity at depths of SC levels dictates movement of the eye at some point observed
 biji kii ore se essi ko ek majboot nirodhatmak prakshepan praapt hota he joki substenshia nigra pars reticulata se nikalataa hota he
 Neurons located in the SNR usually project at a high rate, but they "stop" as soon as the eye movements begin and leave the SC with an inhibitory effect

 chunki bahut adhik codet koshika kam dar par prakshepit hoti he, yah kriya adhikansh rup main prakshepan ke dar main badhottaree ke rup main pradarshit hoti he
 Stimulation in the caudate nucleus initiates movement of the eye, demonstrating an antagonistic effect on SNR directly via gabaergic projections

 Macro cells can be considered cells where the base station antenna is installed on a pillar or building whose height is higher than the average roof

 The coverage inside the building is also supported by GSM and can be achieved by using an in-door picocell base station or through an inverter repeater with an internal antenna supplied by an energy breaker, so that the radio signal from the external antenna is distributed separately inside the building
 To be delivered to the system
 These are usually expanded when there is a need for excessive call capacity indoors; For example at large shops or airports
 However, this is not a pre-requisite, as internal coverage is provided by the entry of radio signals from a nearby cell within the building

 GSM networks operate in many different frequency extension ranges
 Most 2G GSM networks operate on the 900 mhz or 1800 mhz band
 kuch amareeki desh 850 mhz or 1900 mhz kaa prayog karte hai, kyonki 900 or 1800 mhz fricvency band pehle hi abantit kiye gaye the

 The GSM-900 uses 890–915 mhz to transmit base station information from the mobile station and 935–960 mhz for other directions, providing 125 RF channels at intervals of 200 khz
 45 mhz kaa duplex antaraal prayukt hota he
 In some countries the GSM-900 band has been expanded to cover a greater frequency zone

 GSM ne 5
6 tathaa 13 kbit / s ke bich dhwani ko sankuchit karne ke liye kai prakaar ke dhwani kodak kaa istemaal kiya he
 Originally two codecs, namely half-rate and full-rate, have been named based on the type of data channel allocated to them
 inamen ek aisi pranali kaa prayog hua he, jo rekhiy purvakathaneey koding par aadhaarit hoti he
 In addition to being effective towards bitrates, these codecs have made it much easier to identify the more important parts of the sound, making it easier for the air interface layer to preserve and prioritize these signals
 GSM ko 1997 main purna dar channel kaa upyog karne vaale vardhit purna dar kodak, ek 12
2 kbit / s kodak, main viksit kiya gaya
 Finally, with the development of UMTS the EFR was revamped as a variable-rate codec, called amr-narrowband, which is high-quality and robust to interference when used on full-rate channels, as well as, when It is used on a half-rate channel in good radio conditions, so it is less robust but of relatively high quality

 One of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card
 SIM ek alag kiya ja sakane vaala smart card he, jisamen upyogkarta kii sadsyta-jaankaree or phone book hota he
 This allows the user to store their information even after changing the handset
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkarta oparator badalane ke liye bina apana handset badale, keval SIM badal kar aisa kar saktaa he
 Some operators interrupt this action by allowing a single SIM in a phone or only by a SIM given by them; This practice is called SIM locking and in some countries it is illegal
 australia, uttari america or europe main kai oparator un mobile ko lock kar dete hai, jinhen ve bechate hai
 This is done because mobile phone prices are generally discounted at the time of subscription and operators want to avoid any concession on their competitors' mobiles

 GSM ko madhyam str kii suraksha ke saath dizine kiya gaya tha
 The system was designed to ensure the user's identity using a pre-shared key and challenge-response
 upyogkarta or base stesan ke bich ke samvaad ko kutabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 The development of UMTS promotes an alternative USIM, which uses a longer identification key to provide greater security, as well as authenticate the user and network - while GSM only authenticates the user in front of the network
 The security model therefore offers privacy and authentication, but with limited authorization capabilities and without disclaimers
 GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security
 A5 / 1 or A5 / 2 stream bijlekh kaa prayog hawa ke upar aawaaj kii gopneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye hota he
 A5 / 1 was developed earlier and is a strong cypher used in Europe and America; A5 / 2 is a bit weak and is used in other countries

 Polaris defines a true northern azimuth only once every nakshatra day, a whole time it is just a guess and the table or rule of thumb must be corrected
 The best approximation point was made using the major use of the Ursa Major constellation as a torrent
 agrani dhar ko phase ghadi or polaris kii azimuth ke vibhinn akshanshon ke sandarbh main sanderbhit kiya
 Due to the precession of the equinoxes, Polaris will not always be a pole star
 In the next tens of thousands of years, deviations of the axis of rotation of the Earth will send it to other regions of the sky, so that it will complete a circle in 25800 years
 Other stars in this cycle have served as pole stars in the past and will do so even further, such as 1500 BC
