 Pop music or pop music is generally understood as a market suited to youth and commercially recorded music; It consists of relatively short and simple songs, and new tunes are introduced in a new way using innovative techniques
 pop music main lokapriy sangeet ke adhikansh roopon ke prabhaav ko dekha ja saktaa he, lekin ek style ke taur par ye vishesh rup se rock and role or rock style ke baad ke roopon se sambandhit he
 Hatch and Millward defined pop music as "a music that is distinct from popular, jazz and folk music
" " haalanki pop music ko aksar singles charts kii ore adhik jhukaa hua mana jaataa rahaa he, chart sangeet main keval pop music hi nahin balki hameshaa se hi shastreey, jaiz, rock or nae gaanon sahit vibhinn sroton ke gane bhi samahit hote rahe hai jabaki ek style ke taur par pop music kii upasthiti tathaa vikaas aamtaur par alag se hi hota rahaa he
 "pop music" can therefore be described as a different genre of music with a youth market at the center and often seen as a gentle alternative to rock and roll
 "pop music" shabd ko pehali baar 1926 main "lokapriy apil" vaale ek sangeet ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya tha
 According to Hatch and Millward, there are a number of events in the recording history of the 1920s, including country, blues and hillbilly music that are seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry
 grove music online ke anusaar "pop music" shabd kii "utpatti 1950 ke dashak ke madhya main rock and role or usase prabhavit hone vaali yuvaaon kii nai sangeet style ke ek varnan ke rup main hui thi
 

 "
 While the Oxford Dictionary of Music has written about pop music, it was previously thought of as concerts affecting a large audience
 haalanki 1950 ke dashak ke aakhir se pop ko ek khaas prakaar ke gaiyr-shastreey sangeet ke rup main janaa jane laga, aamtaur par betals, da rolling stones, aabba aadi jaise kalakaaron dwaara gaaye gaye gaanon ke rup main
" grove music online ne yah bhi likhaa he ki "1960 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main shabdic taur par pop music shabd kii tulana england ke beet sangeet se kii jaati thi, jabaki america main isko 'rock and role'ke samaan samajha jaataa tha 
"chambers dictionari main "pop art" shabd ke samakaleen istemaal kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 According to Grove Music Online, "the term pop music appears to have originated from the words pop art and pop culture and refers to a completely new and often American, media-culture related product
" lagbhag 1967 ke baad se rock sangeet kii bajaay is shabd kaa adhikadhik upyog kiya jane laga; is vibhaajan se donon hi shabdon ko saamaanya mahatv milane laga
 jahaan rock lokapriy sangeet kii pramanikta or vistaar kii sambhaavnaaon kii aakanksha karne laga, vahiin pop zyada vyapaarik, sulabh or samayik tha
 According to Simon Frith, pop music is designed not as an art, but as an enterprise, which is designed to attract everyone and it neither comes from any particular place nor does it come from any particular place Identification of choice made
 "it has no other significant ambitions except earnings and commercial success
 

 or sangitamay arth main yah multah roodhiwaadee he"
 pop music ko kaaphi unnat tareeke se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 

 Pop music is not music composed by itself, rather it is music composed and composed by professionals "
 apane puure vikaas ke dauraan pop music lokapriy sangeet kii anya adhikansh shaileyon se prabhavit hota rahaa he
 The style of early pop music has been influenced by emotional ballet, the melody used in it is derived from Christian stories and soul music, the use of musical instruments from jazz, country and rock music, orchestralizing classical music, rhythm dance music From, support from electronic music, musical rhythms from hip-hop and more recently rap have assumed words from the genre
 isamen naveen takneekon kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 In the 1940s, the microphone of advanced design made the song style more intimate, and then ten or twenty years later, cheap and durable 45 rpm for singles records revolutionized the way pop music expanded and made pop music ' a record / radio / filmstar system
 Another major technological change during the 1950s was the presence of large-scale television, where pop artists began to appear in the public eye by airing programs
 In the 1960s, the introduction of cheap and small transistor radios gave the youth a chance to listen to pop music outside the home as well
 Multi-track recording from the 1960s and digital sampling from the 1980s were also used as a way to create and expand pop music
 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main amtivi jaise sangeet tivi channelon ke aane se pop music kaa prachaar sambhav hua
 These channels greatly promoted very well known artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince
 pop music par america or british sangeet udyog kaa hi prabhaav rahaa he, inhi kaa asar rahaa he ki pop music ek antarrashtriya monoculture kii tarah ban gaya, lekin zyaadaatar kshetron or deshon main pop music kii apni style he, kai baar sthaneey visheshtaon ke saath bhi use pesh kiya jaataa he
 Some of these trends have also played an important role in the development of this genre
 grove music online ke mutabik "pashchim se praapt pop style duniya bhar main faili, jisase vaishvik vyapaarik sangeet samskruti main ek samanta bani, chaahe wo sthaneey shaileyon ke saath mil gaye hon yaa phir kuch hatakar alag pahchaan banaai ho

 The expansion of Western-style pop music came to be broadly defined as a general process of Americanization, homogenisation, modernization, functional piracy, cultural colonialism and / or globalization
 sangeet-shastri pop music style kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh karte hai ve nimna hai : The main medium of pop music is lyrics, often two to two-and-a-half and three to three-and-a-half minutes long, which usually have uniform and engaging rhythms, a mainstream style, and a common traditional structure
 is style ke saamaanya prakaaron kii baat karen to unamem vars-kores form or therty-tu-baar form shaamil he, jahaan madhur sur or aakarshith karne vaale huks ke saath hi aisa kores bhi hota he jo gane kii lay or taal ke saath chal sake

 Relational Theory Introduction to Specific Relativity vishisht aapekshikta siddhant athwa aapekshikta kaa vishisht siddhant gatisheel vastuon main vaidyutsthitiki par apane shodh-patr main albert oinstin ne 1905 main prastaavit jadtviya nirdesh tantra main maapan kaa ek bhautik siddhant diya
 Galileo Galilei had recognized that all similar motions are relativistic and that nothing here is absolute and nothing is even at rest, which is now called Galileo's relative theory
 oinstin ne is siddhant ko vistaarit kiya, jiske anusaar prakaash kaa veg nirpeksh va niyat he, yah ek aisi ghatana he jo mikelson-morle ke prayog main haal hi main drushtigochar hui thi
 He also gave an epiphany that all these physical laws, all the laws of mechanics and electrodynamics, whatever they are, remain the same
 is siddhant ke parinaamon kii sankhya vrahat he jo praayogic rup se prekshit ho chuke hai, jaise- samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan or samakshanikta
 This theory has changed the concept of nocturnal time interval and has given rise to new concept like nocturnal time period
 is siddhant ne krantikari dravyaman-urja sambandh E=mc2 diya, jahaan c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he, yah sutara is siddhant ke do abhigruhiton sahit anya bhautik niyamon kaa sayukt rup se vyutpan he
 The predictions of relativity theory simply refer to the result of notable physics, especially when the velocity of an observable object is negligible compared to the velocity of light
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar prakaash kaa veg c kisi pariklpana kaa veg maatr nahin he jaise vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa veg balki samshti va samay ke ekikaran kaa dik-kaal ke rup main karne ke liye ek moolbhoot lakshan he
 One consequence of this theory is that any object or particle whose break mass is not zero cannot be accelerated to the velocity of light under any circumstances
 is siddhant ko vishisht kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki yah siddhant keval jadtviya nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hota he
 a few years later, a comprehensive theory of general relativity was given, which works on broad coordinates and also helps in understanding gravity
 —albert oinstin : aatmakathaatmak tippaniyan Einstein made two basic propositions that seem to be the most correct, ignoring the absolute validity of the laws of the then mechanics and electrodynamics
 yah prastaav prakaash ke veg par nirbhar or bhautik niyamo va jadtviya nirdesh tantra se swatantra the
 He mentioned these identities in his first presentation in 1905
 vishisht aapekshikta kii vyutpatti na keval uparokt do abhigruhiton par he balki samshti kii samdaishikata va samarupata, chad maapan kii swatantraaa or apane ateet ke itihaas se ghadiyaan sahit vibhinn nihit pariklpanaaon par nirbhar karti he
 According to Einstein's original presentation on specific relativity in 1905, various postulates derived by different variable derivation methods have been given
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar koi bhi nirdesh tantra nirpeksh nahin hoti
 The stationary instruction system on Earth is not an inertial direction system because it also rotates with the rotation speed of the Earth
 ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra ke saapeksh niyat veg se gatisheel nirdesh tantra bhi jadtviya hota he
 Hence the hypothesis of absolute inertial reference system is unfounded
 mana nirdesh tantra s main dik-kaal nirdeshaank hai or nirdesh tantra S′ main nirdeshaank hai
 Then according to Lorenz transformation these coordinates can be determined by the following relations: jahaan Lorenz is the multiplier and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and the velocity of the reference system s ′ is parallel to the v x-axis
 y or z nirdeshaank prabhavit nahin hai; keval x or t nirdeshaankon kaa sthaanantaran hota he
 There is nothing special in the x-axis, the transfer can also apply to the y or z axes, or in any direction that is parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion
 ek raashi jo lorenj roopantaran main nishchar rahati he lorenj nishchar kehalaati he
 On writing Lorenz transform and its inverse in different coordinates, where one is the coordinates of one event and the other is coordinates of the event and then their intervals are defined as follows: atah ham likh sakate hai Results of specific relativities can be derived from Lorenz equations
 ye roopantaran or vishisht aapekshikta bhi, newtoneey parinaamon se bhinn parinaam dete hai jab saapeksh veg kaa maan prakaash ke veg kii koti kaa ho
 The velocity of light is much higher than any man-made conferences, which some effects were achieved by specific relativity
 samakshanikta, samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan jaise udhaaharan praayogic rup se siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 Two different phenomena that are similar in one inertial reference system may be not analogous to the observer located in the other inertial reference system
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran kii pratham sameekaran Here it is clear that those instructions are symmetric in system S, not necessarily the other directive system in s ′
 yadi ye ghatnaayen nirdesh tantra s main samasthani hai, tab wo duusare nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hongi
 The time between any two events from one observer to another observer is not fixed, but depends on the speed of the observer
 mana kii ek ghadi nirdesh tantra s main viramavastha main he
 Two different tick-ticks of this clock can be represented by Δx = 0
 in donon tik ke madhya samay kaa maapan donon tantron main kiya jaataa he, iske liye pratham sameekaran nimna prakaar praapt hua : This shows that the time difference between the two ticks was higher in the instruction system in which the clock was in motion than in the instruction clock
 samay vistaaran kii sahaayta se ham kai bhautik pariklpanaaon ko samaj sakate hai jaise prithvi ke vayumandal main brahmand kirnon se janit muono kii kshay dar
 The measurement of the dimensions of an object by one observer may be different from the measurement observed by another observer
 isi prakaar, mana rekhak viramavastha main nirdesh tantra s main x-aksh kii taraf sanrekhit he
 In this system, the length of the linear is written as Δx
 rekhak kii lambaai kaa maapan S' nirdesh tantra main karne par jisamen ghadi gatisheel he jahaan chad ke chhoron par x′ kaa maapan S' tantra main samakshanik kiya jaataa he
 In other words, this measurement was done in Δt ′ = 0, which can be coupled by the fourth equation to establish the following relation in lengths Δx and Δx ′: isse spasht hota he ki nirdesh tantra jisamen chad gatisheel thi main chad kii lambaai kaa maan iske swayan ke viraam nirdesh tantra se kam he
 They are not simply added for the connection of velocities
 yadi nirdesh tantra s main prekshak ke anusaar koi vastu x aksh kii ore veg u se gatisheel he, to nirdesh tantra S′ jo nirdesh tantra s ke saapeksh x-aksh kii or v veg se gati kar rahi he main sthit prekshak dwaara prekshit gatisheel vastu kaa veg u' he jahaan : Other instructions observed in the system: yahan dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vastuen jo nirdesh tantra s main prakaash ke veg se gatisheel hai tab vah vastu nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi prakaash ke vag se gatisheel hogi
 If the values of u and v are very low relative to the velocity of light, we get spontaneous galactic conversions of velocities
 saamaanya udahaaran jo diya jaataa he vah yah he ki ek train purv disha kii or patariyon ke saapeksh v veg se gati kar rahi he
 a child who is sitting inside a train threw a ball eastwards and with a velocity u relative to the train
 chirsmmat bhautikee main, patariyon par viramavastha main par sthit prekshak gend kaa veg kaa maan purv disha main u = u′ + v prekshit karegaa, jabaki vishisht aapekshikta yah satya nahin he; balki gend kaa veg purv disha main duusari sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : u = / 
 Again, there is nothing special for x or east direction
 ye sutara kisi bhi disha main lagu hogen jiske liye hamen saapeksh veg v ke paraspar samaantar va lambavat gatiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Einstein's law of combining velocities was found to be correct in the Fitzau experiment, which measured the velocity of light relative to a moving fluid parallel to the velocity of light
 lekin aaj tak kisi bhi prayog ne asamaantar gati ke vyapak rup ke liye sutara kaa parikshan nahin kiya
 Thomas precursor, also known as Thomas Rotation, is a relative refinement applied to the rotation of particles
 kisi vastu kaa abhivinyas vibhinn prekshkon ke liye bhinn ho saktaa he
 Unlike other relative effects, this effect is also meaningful at very low velocities, as can be seen in the movement of moving particles
 jaise-jaise kisi vastu kii chaal prekshak ke drushtikon se prakaas ke veg ke samakaksh pahunchati he, to iske aapekshik dravyaman bhi badhata he jisase iskaa twarit hona or adhik kathin ho jaataa he, yah sab prekshak ke nirdesh tantra se prathit hota he
 In the break state, the energy value of an object is mc2 where m is the mass of the object
 urja sarankshan ke niyam se kisi bhi kriya main dravyaman main kami kriya ke pashchaat isaki gatij urja main vruddhi ke tulya honi chahie
 Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking its kinetic energy into it
 iske alaava uparokt ke sandarbh - lorenj roopantaran ko vyutpann karte hai or vishisht aapekshikta kii vyakhya - tulyata ke liye swa anubhavik tark dete hue ainstin ne bhi kam se kam chaar paper likhe
 The mass-energy equivalent is a consequence of specific relativity

 An object located in the resting state is an energy mass quadrature: its time component is energy and the other three macro components are zero
 x-aksh disha main alp veg v ke saath lorenj roopantaran ke saath nirdesh tantra badalane par urja-samveg chatursadish hoga
 The value of momentum will be the same as the value obtained by dividing the product of energy and velocity by c2
 jaise kisi vastu kaa newtoneey dravyaman, jo nimna vegon ke liye samveg va veg ke anupaat ke saamaan hota he, e / c2 ke baraabar hoga
 Energy and momentum are the net property of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to conclude that they will be automatically obtained in quadrangular form from two fundamental identities of specific relativity, because they do not tell about matter or radiation, but rather about the macro and time
 Explains about atah isaki vyutpati ke liye adhik bhautik gyaan kii aavashyaktaa he
 For this, Einstein used the additional principle according to which the mechanics at low velocities yield perfect results, so at low velocities only the energy scalar and three-momentum vector are there
 isse aage unhone pariklpana di ki prakash kii urja or aavruti samaan dopler visthaapan ghatak se roopantarit hoga, jise usne maxwell samikarnon dwaara pehle hi satya siddh kar diya tha ainstin dwaara 1905 main prakashit pratham paper kaa vishay "kya kisi pind kaa jadtv us urja par nirbhar karata he? " tha
 Although Einstein's argument in the paper is accepted by physicists as true almost universally without any proof, and many authors have suggested for the last few years that this is false
 anya lekhakon ke anusaar yah kathan kaaphi anirnaayak tha kyonki yah kuch antarnihit manyataon par aadhaarit tha
 Einstein admitted that his 1907 article on specific relativism disputed its derivatives
 vahaan unhone mahasoos kiya ki anumaanit urja-dravyaman tark ke liye maxwell samikarnon par bharosa karnaa samasyatmak he
 His paper published in 1905 argued that massless particles could be emitted, but according to the Maxwell equations, it undoubtedly made direct that emission of light could be achieved only as a result of work
 vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke utsarjan ke liye, kisi aaweshit kan kii halchal hi prayaapt he or yah nishchit hi kaary he, atah yah urja kaa utsarjan he
 Since the speed of light is not possible, it can be concluded that humans cannot travel more than 40 light years away from the earth if the passenger is active from 20 to 60 years of age
 yah bhi saralata se sochaa ja saktaa he ki yatri kuch hi soramandalon tak pahunch paane main sakasham ho saktaa he jo prithvi se 20-40 prakaash varshon kii duuri par sthit hai
 But this is an incorrect result
 kyonki samay-vistaaran kii pariklpana ke anusaar payalat ke sakriya 40 varsh ke dauraan kaalpanik antarikshayan saikadon prakashavarsh yatra kar saktaa he
 If it is possible to build an spacecraft whose acceleration is 1g, then in less than a year, the speed of light will be observed at about the same speed of light from Earth
 samay vistaaran kii vajah se prithvi par sthit nirdesh tantra se prekshit uskaa jivan vistaar badhegaa, lekin uske saath yatra kar rahi ghadi main yah parivartan nahin hoga
 During his journey, the person on earth will experience more time than the traveler
 yatri dwaara prekshit 5 varsh bhraman yatra prithvi ke 61⁄2 varsh ke tulya hogi or 6 prakashavarsh duri tay karegaa
 If he returns to earth after a 20-year tour, he has spent 335 years on Earth and has traveled 331 light years
 1 g twaran ke saath 40 varsh kii yatra prithvi ke 58,000 varshon ke tulya hogi or 55,000 prakashavarsh duuri tay hogi
 a 40-year journey with 1
1 acceleration would be equivalent to 148,000 years of Earth and travel 140,000 light years
 isi vistaaran kaaran se ek muon jo prakaash ke veg c ke lagbhag saamaan veg se gatisheel hota he c×viraam arddh-aayu duuri se bahut aage bhi prekshit hota he
 In Figure 2, the interval AB is 'time-congruent'; Just as there is a directive mechanism in which two events a and b occur at the same point in the society, only when they occur at different times can be separated
 yadi is nirdesh tantra main ghatana A, ghatana B, se pehle ghatit hoti he to sabhi nirdesh tantron main ghatana A, b se pehle hi ghatit hogi
 It is possible for matter to move from one place to another, so a relationship is established here
 chitra main antaraal AC samshti-samroop arthath yahan ek nirdesh tantra aisa he jisamen ghatana a or c ek hi samay par ghatit hoti hai keval samshti alag-alag hota he
 Here, one can also find the instruction mechanisms in which a occurs before C, and the direction mechanisms in which c occurs before A
 yadi yah kaaran-or-prabhaav sambandh ke liye sambhav hota ki kuch ghatnaayen a or c ke bich ghatit ho jaayen tab kaaranta kaa virodhabhash iskaa parinaam hoga
 For example, if a was the cause and c is the effect, then there are some directive mechanisms in which the effect occurred before the cause
 yadhyapi yah apane aap main virodhabhash nahin he, isse pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he ki prakaash ke bhi veg se tej gati se swayan ke nirdesh tantra ke bhoot main bhej ja saktaa he
 The causal contradiction can be constructed by sending a signal if and only if no signal was previously found
 isliye, yadi kaaranta ko parirakshit kiya jaae, tab vishisht aapekshikta ke parinamswaroop nirvaat main koi soochna athwa padaarth prakaash ke veg se tej gati nahin kar saktaa
 However, some objects move faster than the velocity of light, such as: Places where the rays of light strike the lower part of the cloud due to the lightning flashes, so that the beam can travel at a speed greater than the velocity of light when It turns quickly
 kaaranta ko dhyaan main rakhe bina yahan or bhi bahut prabal kaaran hai prakaash ke veg se teevr gati vishisht aapekshikta dwaara nisheddh he
 For example, if a fixed force is applied to an object for an infinite time, f = dp / dt is easily impeded by the integration of the following expression without limitation, but only because p = m γ v { \ 
 The displaystyle p = m \ gamma v \ ,} leads to infinity, as v { \ displaystyle \ , v}, proceeds to c

 This behavior is actually observed in particle accelerators, where each charged particle is accelerated by an electromagnetic force
 gunter nimtz or petrissaa ekcle dwaara pratipaadit saidhantik or praayogic surangan adhyayan ne galat daawa kiya kii vishesh paristhitiyon main signal prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se chal saktaa he
 It is measured that the fiber digitizing signal speeds up to 5 times the velocity of c and the information that the electrons carry at zero time oscillation electrons and that the ionization of the atom from the photon and even then the electron imposes zero time in the tuning
 nimtz or ekcle ke anusaar, is ati-pradeepan prakriya main keval ainstin kaaranta or vishisht aapekshikta lekin pracheen kaaranta nahin, kaa ulanghan hota he : ati-pratideept sanchaar kisi bhi tarah kii samay yatra kaa parinaam nahin hota
 According to various scientists, not only are the interpretations of Nimtz incorrect but the experiment is actually a general experimental verification of the specific relativity principle
 vishisht aapekshikta main 4-vimiya minkovesaki samshti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he; - yah dik-kaal kaa udahaaran he
 Minkowski's time period appears to be very similar to the standard three-dimensional Euclidean macro, but it undergoes a radical change over time
 trivim samshti main avakal rekha alpaansh ds nimna prakaar se paribhaashit hota he Where dx = are the minor minor divisions in the three-dimensional macro
 minkovasaki jyamiti main, samay se vyutpan nirdeshaank x0 adhi-vimaa hoti he atah doorik avakal nimna he Where dx = quadrilateral is the differential minority in the time period
 yah ek gahari saidhantik antardrushti kaa sujhavit karata he: vishesh aapekshikta dik-kaal main saamaanya ghurnan samamiti ke tulya he, jo eucalidian samshti main ghurnan samamiti ke anuroop
 Like the Euclidean society, Euclidean distance is also used, so the time period uses Minkowski's distance
 mul rup se vishisht aapekshikta ko "dik-kaal interval kii nishcharata" ke rup main dekha jaataa he jab ise "kisi jadtviya nirdesh tantra" main dekha jaataa he
 All equations and effects of specific relativity can be derived from Minkowski's time-rotation rotation symmetry
 uparokt "ds" kaa vaastavik rup doorik par or x0 nirdeshaank ke chunaav par nirbhar karata he
 To make the time coordinates similar to the macro coordinates, it is used as imaginary: x0 = ict
 misanar, thorne or whealer ke anusaar, antat vishisht va saamaanya aapekshikta donon kii gahari samaj minkosaki doorik ke adhyayan se praapt hoti he or abhedya eucalidian doorik samay nirdeshaank ict ke sthaan par x0 = ct lete hai
 Some authors use x0 = t where the multiplier of c is included elsewhere; For example, macro coordinates are divided by c, or multiples of c ± 2 are used in a distant surface
 yahan vibhinn prathaon ko praakrit ikai se pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he jahaan c=1
 In this, the units of both time and macro are equivalent and the multiplier of c does not appear anywhere
 yadi ham samashti vimaa ko ek kam kar den, jisase ki bhautikee ko trivim main nirupit kar saken Then there will be a zero change in the direction of the duality cone, as the equation yaa Which is the equation of the circle with radius c dt
 jab ham teen dik-vimaaon main isaki vruddhi karte hai, tab yah raashi chaturvimaa shanku main drushtaant hoti he : Therefore yah ashakt dwait-shanku, samshti main ek bindu ko ek-vimaa ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 When we study the stars and say "the light incident from this star that i am seeing now is so many years old", we see this point as a Vima: a null is geodesic
 ham is ghatana ko duuri d = x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 { \ displaystyle d={ \ sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2 xxrep 4 } par sthit va d / c samay purv ghatit ho chuki thi
 For this reason the null duality cone is also known as the 'light cone'
 shanku main -"t" kshetra kaa matlab bindu se soochna praapt kar rahaa he or shanku ke +"t" kshetra main bindu soochna bhej rahaa he
 Minkowski can illustrate the geometry of the macro by using Minkowski diagrams, which are also useful in understanding various experimental ideas in specific relativity
 vishisht aapekshikta kii samikarnon ko vyakt parivarti rup main likhaa ja saktaa he
 In the time period of an event, the situation is given by the reflex quadrature whose components are: ham x0 = ct paribhaashit karte hai taaki samay nirdeshaank kii vimaa bhi duuri ke samaan ho jaisaa ki anya dik-vimayein hai; atah dik va kaal samaan rup se sambandhit hai shirshank pratiparivarti suchakank ke liye upyog kiye hai naa ki unki ghaat ke liye or padank parivarti suchakank hai jo shunya se teen tak kii paraas main hai jaise ki adish kshetra φ kii chaturpravanta ko likhaa jaataa he : In inertial instruction systems, the coordinate transforms are given by the Lorenz transformation Λ
 gati kii vishesh avasthaa ke liye jab yah x-aksh kii disha main ho : Which is the magnification matrix between the x and ct coordinates, where μ 'is the pointer to the rows and ν is the column and yah kisi bhi disha main veg ke liye vyapkikrut kiya ja saktaa he or aage ghurnan ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, adhik jaankaree ke liye lorenj roopantaran sambandhi vishay dekhen
 The conversion of quadrature from one inertial instruction system to another is given by Lorenz transformation: yahan par μ' or ν' par 0 se 3 tak ke liye joda jaataa he
 The following are inverse transforms: jahaan λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _{ \ mu '}{}^{ u }}, λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^{ \ mu '}{}_{ u }} kii vyutkram matrix kehalaati he
 In the case of Lorenz transformation, the above is taken in the direction of the x-axis: adhik vyapak rup main, adhiktar bhautik raashiyon ko pradeesh ke ghatakon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, conversion from one instruction system to another, it is possible to follow comprehensive display conversion rules
 yahan λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _{ \ chi '}{}^{ \ psi } \ ,}, λ χ ′ ψ { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^{ \ chi '}{}_{ \ psi }} kii vyutkram matrix he
 All the entries are modified as per the rules

 When the value of longitude dx2 is negative tab maanak samay kaa avkalaj he, jabaki dx2 dhanatmak he, maanak duri kaa avkalaj he
 The primary value of physical equations in adjective form lies in the Pioncare group, so we do not have to do specific and difficult calculations to calculate this effect
 pradeesh ke rup main parichit anya bhautik rashiyaan bhi roopantaran niyamon kaa paalan karti hai
 The quadrature vector Uμ is given by the following equation iske pashchaat ham kan ke ek nirdesh tantra se duusare nirdesh tantra main chaturvegon ke roopantaran se sambandhit saral vaakya main vegon ke sangyojan par vichaar karte hai
 Uμ also has a definitive form: atah sabhi chaturveg sadish kaa parimaan c hota he
 This equation proves that the concept of permanent instruction in relativity disproves the hypothesis: because we are always in the forefront at least
 chaturtvaran sadish nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : Subsequently, the above equation is calculated with respect to τ atah aapekshikta main, twaran chatursadish or veg chatursadish lamb koniya hote hai
 Emotion and energy are included in the covariant 4-vector: jahaan m nishchar dravyaman he
 The derivative value of the quadrangular vector derives the momentum – energy relation: yah nishchar kya he ham siddh kar sakate hai jiske liye hamen yah siddh karnaa hoga ki yah ek adish he, yah is par nirbhar nahin karata ki ham kis nirdesh tantra main gananaa kar rahe hai or nirdesh tantra ke roopantaran se hamen kul samveg shunaya praapt hota he
 It is clear here that the permanent mass is free and inert
 sthir dravyaman kii gananaa gatisheel kanon va nikaayon ke liye bhi kii jaati he, iske liye inkaa roopantaran us nirdesh tantra main kiya jaataa he jisamen inkaa samveg shunaya ho
 Static energy is related to mass and this well-known relation equation is mentioned above: yahan dhyaan rahe nikaay kaa dravyaman unke dravyaman kendra nirdesh tantra main kalit kiya jaataa he jo is nirdesh tantra main isaki kul urja dwaara diya jaataa he
 This should not be the same as the sum of the private body masses measured in other reference systems

 Where, it is necessary to have the stereoscopic forces defined above
 durbhagyavash, chaturvim main aisa koi pradeesh nahin he jo trivim bal sadish ke ghatakon ko apane ghatakon main samahit karata ho
 If the velocity of the particle is not c, then it is possible to transform the stereoscopic forces from the particle's concomitant direction system to the observer direction
 isse 4-sadish kaa nirmaan hota he jise chaturbal kaha jaataa he
 This is the rate of change in the energy momentum quadrature defined above relative to the above standard time
 chaturbal kaa covariant sanskaran: Where τ is called standard time

 In broad terms, though, the components of the quadratic are not the same as the components of the stereoscopic force because the stereoscopic forces are defined as the rate of change in momentum relative to the directive time which is dp / dt rather the standard force is the quadratic force
 Is defined as the rate of change in dp / dτ

 He was the originator of elementalism which is known as dualism
 dwaitvaad, veydant kii teen pramukh darshanon main ek he
 Madhvacharya is considered the third incarnation of Vayu
 madhwacharya kai arthon main apane samay ke agradoot the, ve kai baar prachlit ritiyon ke viruddh chale gayi hai
 He presented the dvaita philosophy
 inhone dwait darshan ke brahmasutra par bhashya likhaa or apane vedant ke vyaakhyaan kii taarkik pushti ke liye ek swatantra granth 'anuvyaakhyaan' bhi likhaa
 Commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, the treatise on the Mahabharathataparyanryanay and the Shrimad Bhagwatpuran are his other treatises, explaining the meaning of the Mahabharata
 rugveda ke pehle chalis sookhton par bhi ek tikaa likhi or anek swatantra prakarnon main apane mat kaa pratipaadan kiya
 It seems that they are more dependent on the Puranas than the departed to support their views
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga He was born in 1238 AD in a village named Pajak near Udupi Shivalli in Dakshina Kannada district
 alpavastha main hi ye veda or vedangon ke achche gyaata hue or sanyas liya
 He took retirement in worship, meditation, study and scripture
 shankar mat ke anuyaayi achyutapreksh naamak acharya se inhone vidya grahan kii or guru ke saath shastrarth kar inhone apana ek alag mat banaaya jise "dwait darshan" kehete hai
 According to him, Vishnu is the divine
 ramanuj kii tarah inhone shri vishnu ke ayudhon, shankh, chakra, gada or padam ke chinhon se apane angon ko anlakrit karne kii pratha kaa samarthan kiya
 He made his followers in different parts of the country
 udupi main krishna ke mandir kaa sthaapan kiya, jo unke saare anuyaayiyon ke liye tirthasthan ban gaya
 The social reforms to stop animal sacrifice in yagyas are due to them
 79 varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa dehavsaan hua
 Traditional descriptions of Madhvacharya's biography and works are found in the texts Narayan Panditacharya, Sumadhvavijaya and Manimanjari
 parantu ye granth acharya ke prati lekhak ke shraddhalu hone ke kaaran atiranjana, chamatkaar or avishwasaneey ghatnaon se purna hai
 Therefore, on the basis of these, no precise details can be presented regarding Madhavacharya's life
 shri madhwacharya ne prasthaantrayee granthon se apane dwaitvaad siddhant kaa vikaas kiya
 It is also called 'sadvaishnav', because it is different from Sri Ramanujacharya's Sri Vaishnavism
 shri madhwacharya ne `'panch bhed' kaa adhyayan kiya jo `atyant bhed darshanam ́ bhi kaha jaataa he
 He has five characteristics: `atyant bhed darshanam ́ kaa vargeekaran padaarth rup main is prakaar bhi kiya gaya he : An independent is one who is completely independent
 jo bhagwaan yaa sanathan satya he
 But Jeevatma and Jagat are dependent on God
 isaliye bhagwaan unka niyantran karte hai
 God is independent
 isliye unka vargeekaran asambhav he
 Dependent elements are divided into positive and negative forms
 sakaaratmak ko bhi chetan or achetan main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Before defining the unconscious element, Madhvacharya talks about the independent and dependent who are eternally free from the world
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar `vishnu` swatantra hai jo viveki or sansar ke niyanta hai
 Her Shakti is Lakshmi who is eternally free
 kai vyuhon evam avtaron ke roopon main ham vishnu ko paa sakate hai 
 Similarly, the very dependent Lakshmi is also the power of Vishnu and can take many forms only for the physical body
 vah dukh-dard se pare hai
 His sons are Brahma and Vayu
 `prakruti ́ shabd pra = pare + kriti = sristi kaa sangam he
 Madhvacharya considered creation and Brahma separate
 unke anusaar vishnu bhautik sansar ke kaaran karta hai
 God empowers nature by Lakshmi and transforms her into a visible world
 prakruti bhautik vastu, sharir evam angon kaa bhautik kaaran he
 Three powers emerge from the three aspects of nature: Lakshmi, Bhu and Durga
 avidya bhi prakruti kaa hi ek rup he jo paramatma ko jeevatma se chhipaati he
 Madhvacharya ji believes that the earth made of nature is not Maya, but is a separate truth from God
 yah doodh main chhipi dahi ke samaan parivartan nahin he, na hi paramatma kaa rup he
 Therefore, it is special dualism
 madhwacharya ji ne ramanujacharya kaa atmaaon kaa vargeekaran ko sweekaar kiya
 like :-- madhwacharya ne inke saath or do varg joda jo moksh ke yogya he or jo moksh ke yogya nahin he : According to this classification, the individual soul has a separate existence
 is prakaar ek aatma duusari aatma se bhinn hoti hai
 Its spirit is many
 jeevatma paramatma evam prakruti se bhinn hone se paramatma ke nirdesh par ashrith he
 God inspires them based on their past lives
 pichley karmo ke anusaar jeevatma ksht jhelte hai, jisase unki aatma pavitra ho jaati he or jivan-maran se mukt hokar anand kaa anubhav karti hai jo aatma kii sahajata he
 The soul is different in enjoyment
 lekin unamem koi vaimnasy nahin hota or ve pavitra hokar parabrahm ko praapt kar lete hai
 But she cannot be equal to God
 ve paramatma kii seva ke laayak ho jaati hai
 On the path of devotion, the soul attains salvation by the grace of God

 lahore prastaavna,, san 1940 main akhil bhartiya muslim lig dwaara prastaavit ek aadhikarik rajnatik sankalpana thi jise muslim lig ke 22 se 24 march 1940 main chale teen divasiy lahore satr ke dauraan paarit kiya gaya tha
 The proposal called for "independent princely states" for Muslims, allegedly in the northwestern eastern regions of British India, and to make the provinces included in the said units autonomous and sovereign
 tatpashchaat, yah sankalpana "bharat ke musalamaanon" ke liye pakistan naamak main ek alag swatantra swytt mulk banane kii maang karne main parivartit ho gaya
 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions constantly being promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims
 a sensitive political environment had also promoted the proposal of Pakistan is prastaav kii peshi ke upalaksh main prativarsh 23 march ko pakistan main yom-e-pakistan ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The historic resolution was passed at the end of the three-day annual meeting of the All India Muslim League at Minto Park, Lahore on 23 March, on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and After seven years, it was successful in getting its demand passed
 upmahadweep main british raaj dwaara satta janata ko saunpane kii prakriya ke pehle charan main 1936 / 1937 main pehle aam chunaav hue the unamem muslim lig ko buree tarah se haar uthaani padi thi or uske is daawey ko gambhir nicha pahunchi thi ki vah upmahadweep ke musalamaanon ke ekmaatr pratinidhi sabha he
 Therefore, the morale of the Muslim League leadership and workers was shattered and there was a strange sense of helplessness on them
 congress ko madras, you pi, si pi, bihar or urisa main spasht bahumat hasil hui thi, seemaa or bombay main usne duusare dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha or sindh or assam main jahaan muslim haaavee the congress ko kaaphi safalataa mili thi
 In Punjab, however, the head of Inam Hussain's uninusset Party and in Bengal Maulvi Kripa Haq's Praja Krishak Party won
 garaz bharat ke 11 praanton main se kisi ek rajya main bhi muslim lig ko satta praapt na ho sakaa
 In these circumstances, the Muslim League, it seemed, is diverging from the political stream of the subcontinent
 is dauraan congress ne jo pehali baar satta ke nashe main kuch zyada hi sir shaar thi, aise upaay kiye jinase musalamaanon ke dilon main bhay or khataron ne janm lenaa shuru kar diya
 As the Congress declared Hindi as the national language, the Gao decay was banned and the Congress tricolor was given the status of the national flag
 is maamle main muslim lig kii satta khone ke saath apane netritv main yah bhaavana paidaa ho rahaa tha ki muslim lig satta se is aadhaar par vanchit kar di gai he ki vah apane aap ko musalamaanon kii pratinidhi sabha kehalaati he
 This was the starting point for the awareness of the spirit of two separate nations led by the Muslim League
 isi dauraan dwitiya vishwa yuddh samarthan ke badale satta kii bharpoor hastantaran ke masale par british raaj or congress ke bich charchaa bhadkaa or congress satta se alag ho gai to muslim lig ke liye kuch daravaaje khulte dikhaai die
 And in this background, this 3-day meeting of All India Muslim League in Lahore started on 22 March
 baithak se 4 din pehle lahore main allamaa purvi ke deen party ne pabandi todate hue ek sainya parade kii thi jise rokane ke liye police ne golibari kii
 Around 35 Deen were killed

 Incidentally, in view of the seriousness, Muhammad Ali Jinnah addressed the inaugural session in which he said for the first time that the problem in India is not communal, but Ben International means it is a problem of two countries
 unhone kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon main antar itnaa bada or spasht he ki ek kendriya sarkaar ke tahat unka gathbandhan khataron se bharpoor hoga
 He said that there is only one way in this matter that i have different afflictions
 duusare din inhen padon par 23 march ko is samay ke bengal ke mukhyamantri maulavee krupa haq ne sankalp lahore diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is tab tak koi sanvaidhanik yojana na to vyavhaarya hoga or na musalamaanon ko hoga jab tak ek duusare se mili hue bhugolic ikaayiyon alag gaanaa kshetron main parisemen na ho
 The resolution said that in these areas where Muslims have a numerical majority, such as the Northwest and Northeast regions of India, they should be set free by combining them with units that have high autonomy and sovereignty
 maulavee inaam ul dwaara kii peshkash kii is sankalp kaa samarthan upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan, punjab moulana jafar ali khan, seemaa se sardaar aurangzeb sindh se sir abdulla haaron or baluchistan se kaaji isa ne kii
 The resolution was passed in the closing session on 23 March
 april san 1941 main madras main muslim lig ke sammelan main sankalp lahore ko party ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya or isi ke aadhaar par pakistan andolan shuru hui
 But even then these areas were not clearly identified, including the demand for separate Muslim states
 pehali baar pakistan kii maang ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan 7 april san 1946 dilli ke teen divasiy sammelan main kii gai jisamen kendriya or prantiy vidhansabhaon ke muslim legi sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At this conference, a resolution was passed to present the demand of the Muslim League to the delegation of the Cabinet Mission coming from Britain, which was drafted by two members of the Executive of the Muslim League, Chaudhary Riksalam and Hassan Isfahani
 is karaadaad main spasht rup se pakistan main shaamil kiye jane vaale kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Bengal and Assam in the northeast and Punjab, Seema, Sindh and Balochistan in the northwest
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is sankalp main kashmir kaa koi zikr nahin tha haalanki uttar pashchim main muslim bahul kshetra tha or punjab se judaa hua tha
 It is very important that the two states were completely omitted from the Delhi Convention in this resolution, which was very clear in the resolution Lahore, instead it was demanded as the only state of Pakistan
 shaayad bahut kam logon ko yah pataa he ki sankalp lahore kaa mul masauda us jamaane ke punjab ke uninst mukhyamantri sar sikandar hayaat khan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The Uniunsat party was integrated into the Muslim League at that time and the head Sikandar Hayat Khan was the President of the Punjab Muslim League
 sir sikandar hayaat khan ne sankalp ke mul masaude main upmahadweep main ek kendriya sarkaar ke aadhaar par lagbhag condereshan prastaavit thi lekin jab masauda muslim lig subject cameti main vichaar kiya gaya to kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna ne khud is masaude main ekmaatr centre sarkaar kaa ullekh moulik kaat diya
 The head Sikandar Hayat Khan was strongly angry on this and stated clearly in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 11 March 1941 that his vision of Pakistan was mainly different from the principles of Jinnah Saheb
 unka kahana tha ki vah bharat main ek ore hindu raaj or duusari ore muslim raaj ke aadhaar par vitaran ke sakht khilaaf hai or vah aisi bakaul unke vinaashkari vitaran kaa datakar muqabla karenge
 But this did not happen
 sir sikandar hayaat khan duusare varsh san 1942 main 50 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya yun punjab main mohammad ali jinna teevr virodh ke uthte hue hisar se mukti mil gai
 In the Delhi session of 1946, the resolution of Pakistan was presented by Sankalp Hussain Shaheed Sohrawardy and it was praised by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyakalsam
 sankalp lahore pesh karne vaale maulavee krupa haq is sammelan main shariq nahin hue kyonki unhen sun 1941 main muslim lig sekharaj kar diya gaya tha
 At the Delhi conference, Abu Alhashm, the leader of Bengal, strongly opposed this resolution and argued that this resolution is quite different from the Lahore resolution which is part of the constitution of the Muslim League - he said that the resolution was clearly in Lahore in two states There was no option to amend this basic resolution of the Muslim League to the Delhi Convention
 abavaalhashm ke anusaar kaayade ajam ne isi sammelan main or baad main bombay main ek baithak main yah samajhaayaa tha ki is samay ke baad upmahadweep main do alag samvidhan vidhansabhaon ke gathan kii baat ho rahi he to dilli kanvension sankalp main ek rajya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 But when the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan sets the constitution, it will be the final arbiter of this problem and it will have full authority to decide the formation of two separate states
 lekin pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ne na to kaayade ajam jivan main or na jab san 1956 main desh kaa pehla samvidhan paarit ho rahaa tha upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do swatantra or swytt rajyon ke sthapana par vichaar kiya
 After 25 years of political upheaval and conflict and the destruction of the Bangladesh war in Sun 1971, but two different afflictions of Muslims emerged in the subcontinent, whose resolution is still safe in the case of Lahore

 About 600 years before Christ, Thalis, a resident of Greece, was aware that some objects attract light objects after rubbing
 iskaa ullekh thiafrastus ne 321 i

 This attraction power was studied by William Gilbert in the 16th century and he called it 'electric'
 aadhunik shabd 'electron' kaa upyeg unani bhashaa main ambar ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term 'electricity' was used in 1650 by Walter Charlton

 In 1729, Stephen Gray stated that this attraction power can be transmitted from one part of an object to another
 aisi vastuon ko desagulirs ne 'chaalak' kaha
 All types of metals fall into this category

 san 1737 main duphe ne bataaya ki sajaateey aavesh ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai tathaa vijaateey aakarshith karte hai
 In 1745, Clyst in Cummin, Massenbrook in Lyden, and William Watson in London said that electricity can also be stored, their experiments and ideas gave rise to the famous accumulator Leiden Jar
 lagbhag isi samay vidyut ko paryaapt maatra main praapt karne ke praytn bhi jari the tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke vidyut yantron kaa avishkaar hua
 Willie Watson thought that electricity is a type of elastic fluid that exists in every object
 aveshvihin vastuon main yah saadhaaran maatra main hoti he at: iskaa nirikshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Watson's fluid theory, electricity moves from one object to another
 amareeki vaigyanik tathaa raajnneetijna benjamin franklin ne is siddhant kaa samarthan kar, vistaar kiya
 Franklin said that electricity can neither be generated nor destroyed
 franklin ne liden jaar kaa adhyayan kar uski kriya ko samajhane kii cheshtaa kii
 But Franklin's most famous and important experiment was that, in which he proved that the properties of electricity and ordinary electricity are similar at the time of cloud to cloud
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidyut ke kan ek duusare par bal daalate hai
 After Franklin, Epinus took these ideas and gave the impression that the force of two objects decreases by increasing the distance between them
 is siddhant kaa vistaar jajef pristli tathaa henry cavendish ne kiya
 Coulom then discovered that the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and the product of the charge
 vidyut kaa yah mul niyam ab bhi 'kulom kaa balanium' kaha jaataa he
 In 1837, Michael Faraday studied the effect of the medium on the electric force between any two charged objects and found that if the medium is any more insulated in place of air then the electric force decreases, this property of anti-electromagnetism
 Said to be 'uniquely eclectic
' unhone apane barf ke baratanwale prasiddh prayog dwaara darshaya ki yadi kisi aaweshit chaalak kaa ek baratan main laayaa jaae, to baratan ke andar kii ore vijaateey aavesh prerit hota he tathaa baahar kii ore sajaateey awesh
 Faraday made an in-depth study of the electrodynamics and introduced the idea of electric force lines to explain their various effects and called the empty space between charged objects a 'zone'

 In the last years of the eighteenth century, many experiments and theories regarding the movement of charges were coming to light
 san 1780 main italy ke ljugi gailawani ne mechak ke upar vidyut pravaah ke kai prayog kiye
 In 1800, Volta found electrical effects in two dissimilar metals soaked with dilute acid or salt solution and obtained electric current from them
 is vidyut pravaah ko kai guna karne ke liye unhone aisi kai asmaan dhaatuon ke jodon ko lekar ek punj banaaya jise voltiy punj kehete hai
 According to these experiments by Volta, a 'voltaic Cell' was created to achieve electrification
 usee varsh england main niklson tathaa karlile ne is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ki yadi pani main vidyut dhara pravaahit kii jaae to pani ke hydrogen tathaa oxigen main apghaton ko jaataa he
 Such decomposition is called electronegative decomposition
 crukashaik ne pataa lagaaya ki vilyan ke dhaatulavan bhi isi prakaar apaghatit kiye ja sakate hai
 After this Faraday regularly studied this action and established 'faraday's rules'
 in niyamon athwa inase sambandhit prayogon ke aadhaar par vidyut dhara utpaadan karanevaale vibhinn prakaar ke cell tathaa sanchayakon kii rachana kii gai he
 In 1820 Hans Christian Arstad discovered that a current with a current in a wire also has a magnetic field related to it

 Geomorphology is studied in geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archeology and geotechnical engineering and this broad base of interest generates a wide variety of research styles and interests under the subject

 Degradation is caused by erosion and extensive waste, creating sediment that is transported and deposited to other locations within the landscape or away from the coast
 uttarottar chote paimaane par, isi tarah kii avadharana lagu hoti he, jahaan ikai bhu-akritiyaan yogashil or ghataav prakriyaaon ke santulan ke jawaab main viksit hoti hai
 Modern geomorphology is the study of the divergence of the flow of material on the surface of a planet and is therefore closely associated with sedimentology, which can similarly be seen as the convergence of that flow

 An early popular geomorphic model was the geographic cycle or erosion cycle developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899
 yah chakra ekarupathavaad ke siddhanton se prerit tha jise sarvapratham james haton ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In relation to valley-like shapes, uniformism characterized this cycle in a sequence in which a river cuts a valley as deep as possible, but then the erosion of the side basins eventually recovers the area and reduces elevation Gives, after which regeneration can resume that cycle

 Davis's ideas have largely been surpassed today, mainly because of his lack of predictive ability and qualitative nature, but he remains an extremely important figure in the history of the subject
 1920 ke dashak main, walter penk ne davis ke model kaa ek vaikalpik model viksit kiya, yah maanate hue ki sthalakriti vikaas ko utthan or anaachhadan kii satat prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke rup main behatar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, naa ki davis ke ekal utthan ke baad hone vaale kshay ke rup main
 However, due to his untimely death at a relatively young age, the controversy with Davis and the lack of an English translation of his works did not gain widespread recognition for many years
 in lekhakon ne prithvi kii sataha ke vikaas ke adhyayan ko, pehle kii tulana main adhik saamanyakrit, vishwa str par praasangik aadhaar dene kaa prayaas kiya
 In the early 19th century, authors - particularly in Europe - attributed the local climate to landforms, and specifically to glaciation and periglacial processes

 While Pank and Davis and their followers were writing and studying primarily in Western Europe, another, largely segregated school of geomorphology developed in the United States in the mid-20th century

 Modern researchers try to derive quantitative "theories" that govern the Earth's surface processes, but equally, they recognize the specificity of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate

 At the same time, the use of more accurate physical measurement techniques, including piercing GPS, remotely sensed digital terrain models, and laser scanning techniques have allowed their quantification and study of these processes
 iske baad computer simulation or modelling kaa upyog tab yah samajhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kaise ye prakriyaayein ek saath or samyavadhi main kaam karti hai
 Most processes that are geologically relevant can be considered either erosive, translational, or a combination of the two
 Deposition processes are mostly considered within the field of sedimentology, but are often understood as part of geomorphology as well
 apkshay, prithvi kii saamagree kaa vayumandaleey yaa sataha ke nazadiiki agenton se sampark ke kaaran hone vaala rasinic or bhautik vighatan he

 Other more serious geomorphic processes may include periglacial processes, salt-mediated action, or extraterrestrial effects
 nadiyaan or dharaaen, keval pani kii hi vaahak nahin hai balki talachat kii bhi hai
 Water, when flowing over the surface, is able to use sediments and carry them downstream, either as bottom load or suspended load, or as dissolved load
 talachat parivahan kii dar, swayan talachat kii uplabdhta or nadi ke nirvahan par nirbhar karti he
 Rivers are also capable of eroding new rocks and creating new sediments, by their bottom and coupling with the surrounding mountain slopes
 In this way, rivers are thought to be responsible for establishing the base level for large-scale landscapes in non-glacial environments
 vibhinn bhudrishy tatwon ke sampark main nadiyaan mahatvapurn sutara hai
 When rivers flow through topographies, they generally become larger in size and merge with other rivers

 Eolian processes are related to the movement of air and, more specifically, to the ability of Hava to shape the Earth's surface
 Winds can erode, transport, and deposit things, and these winds are more effective in areas where vegetation is sparse and there is an adequate supply of sediment
 haalanki pani or brihat pravaah, adhikansh vaataavaran main hawa kii tulana main adhik chizon kaa istemaal karata he, vaiudh prakriyaayein shushk vaataavaran main mahatvapurn hai, registan
 Soils, regoliths and boulders move under the influence of gravity, crawling, rolling, flowing, falling
 aisi brihad tuutan sthaliy or dhalaanon par hoti he or inhen prithvi, mangal shukr, titan or iapets par dekha gaya he
 Processes running on mountain slopes can change the topology of the slope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes

 On Earth, biological processes such as digging or tree throws can play an important role in determining the rates of some sloping processes
 himandi, jo ki bhugolic rup se simit he, bhudrishy parivartan ke prabhavi kaarak hai
 The gradual movement of snow down the valley causes friction and uprooting of the rock below

 The debris transported by the glacier after it is finished is called Moren
 himand kataav, you aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke liye jimmedaar he, jo ki nadi dwaara banaai gai ve aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke vipareet he
 The way glaciers process contact with other landscape elements, especially with slopes and river processes, is an important aspect of plio-pleistocene landscape development and its sediments are found in many high mountain environments
 jo vaataavaran apekshaakrit haal hi main himachhadit hue hai magar ab nahin hai, ve un bhudrushyon ke mukaable jo kabhi himachhadit nahin hue, ab bhi ucch bhudrishy parivartan dar ko dikhaa sakate hai
 Non-glacial geomorphic processes that have also been adapted by earlier glaciation are called paraglacial processes

 Long-term plate tectonic dynamics induce orogenic tropics, massive mountain ranges with a million-year lifespan, which are the focus of high-rate processes of river and hill slopes, and thus produce long-term depressions
 gahari papadi gatishiltaa kii visheshtaayen, jaise ki plums or nimna sthalmandal kaa gaiyr-paratbandi ko bhi mana jaataa he ki dirghakaalin avadhi main dharti kii sthalakriti ke bade paimaane par vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he

 shakti or shaktimaan kii aam vyutpatti, arthath bhagwaan main stri or purush siddhant kaa arth he ki shakti or shaktimaan ek hi hai
 Every deity has his own companion, ‘ardhangini’ or Shakti, and without that Shakti he is sometimes considered to be without the inevitable Shakti

 There are many detailed references to Radha in Brahma Vaivarta and Padma Purana
 gaudeey vaishnav, jaisaa ki naam se pataa chalata he, aamtaur par bengal ke kshetra ko darshata he

 Baru Chandidas is a poet who is notable as a historical figure of early Central Bengal; The period of his poem Srikrishnakirtan is still unanswered, although it is one of the most important early evidences of the depiction of the popular narrative of "lord Krishna's love for Gopika Radha" in Kriti Bengali literature and religion

 In this Bengali tradition of Chaitanya Vaishnavism, the spiritual position and worship of Radha is believed to have been established by Krishnadasa in his Chaitanya Charitamrita where he demonstrates the principle which prevailed among the Chaitanyaists of Vrindavana after Mahavassan in 1533 of Chaitanya
 
 yah mana jaataa he ki krishna ne, yah anubhav karne ke liye ki radha ke rup main krishna ko prem karne kii kya anubhuti hoti he, chaitanya mahaprabhu ke rup main avatar liya
 And what Radha does in Krishna's longing is the pronunciation of his name
 a god established by Gopal Bhatt Goswami himself is called Radha Ramana, it is not surprising that Radha Ramana is not only seen as Krishna But also in the form of radha-krishna
 And the worship in his temple, which is located in the center of Vrindavan, is a continuous daily activity, which involves a number of scheduled tasks throughout the day, aimed at being theoretically and remotely close to Radha and Krishna
 And aspiring for the possibility of joining
 nimbark sampradaay bal krishna kii puja karata he, chaahe akele yaa unki sahachari radha ke saath, jaisaa ki rudra sampradaay karata he or iskaa aarmabhik kaal he kam se kam barahavin shatabdi

 It should be noted that Nimbarka saves Radha from the presumed unethical implication of this literature and gives her the dignity she did not find elsewhere
 nimbark dwaara sthapit nimbark sampradaay, chaar vaastavik vaishnav paramparaon main se ek he
 The lack of evidence on account of the destruction of Mathura and Vrindavan in the 13th and 14th centuries means that the exact date and origins of this tradition are shrouded in mystery and need to be investigated

 In his Vedanta Kamadhenu Dasashloki, it is clearly stated: - ange tu vaame vrishabhanujam muda virajmanam anurupasaubhagam

 parampita parameshwar ke sharir kaa baayan hissaa shrimati radha hai, jo harsh ke saath baithi hai or swayan parameshwar jaisi hi sundar hai; jinaki seva main hazaron gopiyaan hai: ham us sarvocch devi kaa dhyaan karte hai, jo sabhi ichchhaaon kii poorti karne vaali hai
 The subject was adopted by Jayadeva Goswami and other poets of the time who saw the inherent beauty and bliss that produced this philosophy
 is sampradaay main radha kaa mahatv, shri krishna ke mahatv se kam nahin he
 In this community of Nimbarka, both are jointly the object of worship
 vedant-parijaat-saurabh naam ke tahat nimbark, brahm sutara ke pehle tippaneekaron main se bhi ek hai
 Acharyas of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in the 13th and 14th centuries wrote more literary works on this divine pair
 jayadev ke munh-bole bade bhai, swami shri shribhatta ne jayadev kii tarah sangitamay prastuti kii dhrupad style ke liye yugal shatak kii rachana kii, lekin jayadev ke vipareet, jinhone apni rachana sanskrit main likhi thi, swami shribhatta kii rachanaaen vraj bhashaa main hai, jo hindi kaa ek sthaneey rup he jise vraj ke sabhi nivaasiyon dwaara samajha jaataa tha
 In fact, the Acharyas of this tradition wrote in Vraj language and due to the low prevalence of this language in modern times, very little research has been done, although these Acharyas took place many rotten before the six Goswamis of Vrindavan
 kisi bhi maamle main, nimbark sampradaay main puja kii ekmaatr vastu sanyukt divya dampatti radha krishna hai
 According to the Mahavani written by 15th century Jagadguru Swami Shri Harivyas Devacharya radhamakrishnaswarupam vai, krishnam radhaswarupinum; kalatmanam nikunjasthan gururupam sadaa bhaje main nirantar radha kaa gungan karata hum jo koi or nahin balki krishna hai or shri krishna, radha hi hai, jinke yoga ko kaambij dwaara darshaya gaya he or jo sadaa nikunj golok vrindavan main nivas karte hai
 The contribution of Nimbarka Sampradaya to the philosophy of Radha Krishna cannot be denied, because this philosophy and theology started from this
 swaminarayan sampradaay main radha krishna dev kaa sthaan vishesh he kyonki swaminarayan ne radha krishna ko khud shikshapatri main sandarbhit kiya jise unhone likhaa tha
 In addition, he himself ordered the construction of temples in which Radha Krishna is installed as the deity
 swaminarayan ne "bataaya ki krishna kai roopon main prakat hote hai
 When he is with Radha, he is considered the supreme god under the name radha-krishna; lakshmi-narayan is known along with Rukmini

 The temple on the left side of the hall has statues of Radha Krishna
 is parampara ke darshan ke anusaar krishna kii kai mahila saathi thim, gopiyaan, lekin unamem se radha ko sarvotkrisht bhakt mana jaataa tha

 is siddhant ke anusaar sampradaay ne golok ko ek sarvocch swarg yaa nivas ke rup main alag rakhaa he, kyonki mana jaataa he ki vahaan krishna apni gopiyon ke saath anand lete hai, jo swaminarayan sampradaay ke anusaar ve gualine hai jinke saath krishna naache the; unke saath krishna kaa sambandh bhagwaan or bhakt ke pratidaan sambandh kaa pratik he
 Even before Chaitanya, the founder of Pushtimarga, Vallabhacharya worshiped Radha, where, according to some sects, devotees are identified as Radha's friends who are privileged to make intimate arrangements for Radhakrishna
 is parampara ke ek pramukh kavi, dhruvadas jinhen radha vallabhi bhi kaha jaataa he, ve mukhyatah radha or krishna ke nijee sambandhon ke saath jude hone ke liye ullekhneey the
 In his poem Chaurasi verse and in the comments of his followers, the emphasis is on the unique benefits of constant contemplation of Anant Leela
 apane vaishnav sah-dharmiyon ke saath radhavallabhi, bhagwat puraana ke prati apaar shraddha rakhte hai, lekin kuch antarangta jo radha or gopiyon ke saath rishton kii paridhi ke baahar he vah is sampradaay ke darshan main shaamil nahin he
 The sweetness of the relationship is emphasized, or the juice

 Vrindavan and Mathura are considered to be centers of worship of radha-krishna
 vrindavan ke sabase mahatvapurn mandir hai Sri Radha Ras Bihari Ashta Sakhi Temple In Vrindavan, the "leela place" of Lord Krishna, it is a temple where it is necessary for devotees of Krishna who complete the 84 Kosh Vraj Parikrama Yatra

 The discussion of these Ashta Sakhis is described in the Veda Puranas and the ancient texts of Srimad Bhagavata
 is mandir ko kaha jaataa he - shri radha raas bihari asht sakhi mandir or yah bhagwaan krishna or radharani kii divya raas lila kaa sthaan he
 It is located near the Sri Banke Bihari Temple
 kinvadanti he ki shri radha raas bihari asht sakhi mandir, mathura, vrundavan main un do sthanon main se ek he jahaan bhagwaan krishna apni preyasi radha or unki sakhiyon ke saath raas lila main shaamil hote hai
 On these nights, devotees are reported to have heard the sound of the pilings, which were playing with a divine tune
 madan-mohan, govinddev, radha-raman, radha-gokulanand, radha-damodar, baanki-bihari, radhavallabh, jugal kishor, radha-gopinath, radha shyamsundar or krishna-balram mandir jahaan radha or krishna kii puja unki murti roopon main kii jaati he
 There are many traditions that have spread the worship of radha-krishna in many other countries, whether it is related to migration or the didactic activities of the sages
 One such prominent pundit, Prabhupada himself opened several centers where he became a Brahmin from Mlechha
 Students were taught to worship the idol of radha-krishna and to be "devoted to the service of God"
 shri radhika krishnashtak ek bhajan he
 It is said that the reciter can find Krishna through Radha by chanting it

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
 avyakt sankramanon se peedit logon ko baad main jivan main sakriy tibi rog ke viksit hone se bachaav ke liye bhi upachaar diya jaataa he

 The evidence in support of this case is weak when compared to this practice and people taking the medicines on their own independently
 lekin upachaar ke mahatv ko, logon ko yaad dilaane ke tareeke prabhavi dikhaai dete hai
 In 2010, a suggested six-month treatment of newly started pulmonary tuberculosis used a combination of antibiotics like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isonizid in the subsequent four months

 inamen ek he ahura majadaa kii aatma, 'spenta manu'
 The second is the evil spirit 'anghara Menu'
 is dusht aatma ke naash hetu hi ahura majadaa ne apni saat kritiyon yatha akaash, jal, prithvi, vanaspati, pashu, maanav evam agni se is bhautik vishwa kaa srijan kiya
 They knew that due to their destructive nature and ignorance, the Anghara menu would attack this world and would enter into chaos, untruth, sorrow, cruelty, sickness and death
 manushya, jo ki ahura majadaa kii sarvshereshth kriti he, kii is sangharsh main kendriya bhoomika he
 He has to voluntarily take on the evil spirit in this struggle
 is yuddh main uske astr honge achchhai, satya, shakti, bhakthi, adarsh evam amartv
 By following these principles, humans will eventually end all the evil in the world
 kuch adhik vaigyanik kasuti par dharm ko parakhane vaale 'spenta manu' kii vyakhya alag tarah se karte hai
 According to it, the 'spenta menu' is not a soul, but an incremental, progressive mind or mindset
 arthath yah ahura majadaa kaa ek gun he, vah gun jo brahmand kaa nirmaan evam sanvardhan karata he
 God created the spenta menu so that a happy world could be created
 pragatisheel maansikta hi prithvi par manushyon ko do virgon main baantati he
 The virtuous, who promote the world and the vicious, who stop its progress
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki prayek vyakti ishwar tulya bane, jeevandaayee urja ko apanaae tathaa nirmaan, sanvardhan evam pragati kaa vaahak bane
 According to the teachings of Prophet Zarathustra, the world is a moral system
 is vyavastha ko swayan ko kaayam hi nahin rakhana he, balki apana vikaas tathaa sanvardhan bhi karnaa he
 Inertia is not allowed in Zarathosti religion
 vikaas kii prakriya main buree takatein baadha pahunchaati hai, parantu manushya ko isse vichlit nahin hona he
 He has to keep moving in the direction of development always while maintaining the path of virtue
 jivan ke prayek kshan kaa ek nishchit uddeshy he
 It is not something that starts spontaneously and ends spontaneously
 sab kuch ishwar kii yojana ke anusaar hota he
 Supreme goodness should be the aim of our life
 manushya ko achchhai se, achchhai dwaara, achchhai ke liye jeena he
 'humat', 'huqt' and 'huvarshat' are the pillars of the Zarthosti way of life
 jarathosti dharm main mathvaad, brahmacharya, vrath-upwas, aatm daman aadi kii manaahi he
 It is believed that they weaken humans and reduce their strength to fight against evil
 nirashavad va avsaad ko to paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 Zarathustra wants humans to enjoy this world fully and be happy
 vah jo bhi kare, bas ek baat kaa khyaal avashya rakhe or vah yah ki sadachaar ke maarg se kabhi vichlit na ho
 a life endowed with material comforts is not forbidden, but it has also been said that you give more than what you take from the society
 kisi kaa haq markar yaa shoshan karke kuch paanaa duraachaar he
 Those who are less rich than us should always help
 jarathosti dharm main daihik mrityu ko buraai kii asthaayee jeet mana gaya he
 After this, the soul of the deceased will be judged
 yadi vah sadaachari hui to anand va prakaash main vaas paaegi or yadi duraachaari hui to andhkaar va nairashya kii gaharaaiyon main jaaegi, lekin duraachaari aatma kii yah sthiti bhi asthaayee he
 After all, Zoroastrian religion considers the ultimate aim of the world to be the victory of good, not the punishment of evil
 atah yah manyata he ki antat kai muktidaata aakar buraai par achchhai kii jeet puri karenge
 Then Ahura Mazda will be well-supported as Aseem Prakash
 phir atmaaon kaa antim faisla hoga
 After this the physical body will be resurrected and reunited with its own soul
 samay kaa astitv samaapt ho jayega or ahura majadaa kii saat kritiyaan shaashvat dhanyata main ek saath aa milengi or aanandamay, anshwar astitv ko praapt karengi

 aalochana yaa samalochna kisi vastu / vishay kii, uske lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, uske gun-dosha evam upyuktatta kaa vivechan karne wali saahitiyik vidha he
 The beginning of Hindi criticism is considered to be from the Bharatendu era of the late 19th century
 'samalochna' kaa shabdic arth he - 'acchhee tarah dekhnaa'
 The word 'criticism' is made of 'luch' metal
 'luch' kaa arth he 'dekhnaa'
 The words review and criticism also have the same meaning
 angreji ke 'critisism' shabd ke samanaarthi rup main 'aalochana' kaa vyavhaar hota he
 The word criticism is also used for 'commentary-interpretation' and 'poetry-theory' as practiced in Sanskrit, but Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is clear that modern criticism is something independent of Sanskrit's poetry-theory
 aalochana kaa kaary he kisi sahityak rachana kii acchhee tarah pariksha karke uske rup, ganu or arthvyastha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has given the definition of criticism in these words: arthath aalochana kaa kartavya sahityak kriti kii vishleshan parak vyakhya he
 Criticism analyzes those elements of the synthesis of literature from the life and spirit of life
 sahitya main jahaan raagatatv pradhan he vahaan aalochana main buddhi tatv
 Criticism also assesses historical, social, political conditions and pupils and discusses their impact on literature
 vyaktigat ruchi ke aadhaar par kisi kriti kii ninda yaa prashansa karnaa aalochana kaa dharm nahin he
 Methodism and system are important in criticism for the interpretation and analysis of work
 aalochana karte samay aalochak apane vyaktigat raag-dwesh, ruchi-aruchi se tabhi batch saktaa he jab paddati kaa anusaran kare, vah tabhi vastunishth hokar sahitya ke prati nyaay kar saktaa he
 From this point of view, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered the best critic in Hindi
 aalochana karte samay jin manyataon or paddatiyon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he, unke anusaar aalochana ke prakaar viksit ho jate hai
 Four types of review are generally accepted: - saiddhanthik aalochana main sahitya ke siddhanton par vichaar hota he
 In it, ancient classical poetry - Rasa, Alankar etc
 and modern beliefs and rules of literature are mainly disseminated
 saiddhanthik aalochana main vichaar kaa bindu yah he ki sahitya kaa maandand shastreey he yaa aitihaasik
 The classical form of a norm is static and unchangeable, but considering the criteria as a historical category, their form is variable and developmental
 donon prakaar kii saiddhanthik aalochanaayen uplabdh hai
 But now the importance of the same theoretical criticism which assumes development in the historical process of elements and rules of literature
 nishchit siddhanton keadhar par jab sahitya ke ganu-dosha, shreshth-nikrusht kaa nirnay kar diya jaataa he tab use nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai
 It is also considered a type of moral criticism
 iskaa mukhya swabhaav nyaayadhish kii tarah sahityak kritiyon par nirnay dena he
 Such criticism often uses the principle mechanically
 isliye nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa mahatva kam ho jaataa he
 Although creating a sense of value or superior literature and inferior literature is one of the main religions of criticism, but it is not possible by mechanical use of principles
 'hindi sahitya kosh' main nirnayaatmak aalochana ke vishay main bataaya gaya he: Thus judgment in criticism is not the point of dispute as much as the method adopted for decision
 jasai, ramachandra shukla kii aalochana main mulya nirnay he, lekin uskaa tarika srujanaatmak he, yantric nahin
 Judicial criticism lacks flexibility in both value and method
 is aalochana main kavy kaa jo prabhaav aalochak keman par padataa he use vah sajile pad-vinyas main vyast kar detaa he
 Personal interest is main in this
 prabhavabhivyajunk samalochna koi thaȥk-ǒthakaane kii vastu nahin he
 Neither is its value in the field of knowledge nor in the field of emotion
