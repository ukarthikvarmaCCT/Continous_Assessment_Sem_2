 Similarly, Jafar al-sadiq did not consider water, fire and air as elements
 hawa ko bhi tatwon kaa mishran mana or bataaya ki inamen se har tatv saans ke liye zaruri he
 Imam Sadiq in medical science said that all the elements found in the soil are also in the human body
 inamen chaar tatv adhik maatra main, aath kam maatra main or aath anya sookshm maatra main hote hai
 On the martyrdom of all Ahleelasam is presented freshness; Imam Jafar Sadiq's chief is Taruf aaj ham baat karte hai ek aise vaigyanik, chintak or philasfer kii, Born on 20 April 700 on Arab land, the name of that scientist was Jafar Al Sadiq

 Whereas according to Sufi branch these are Vali
 Other branches of Islam also do not deny their importance

 He denied Aristotle's theory of the four basic elements and said that i am surprised that Aristotle said that there are only four elements in the world, soil, water, fire and air
 Soil is not an element itself, but it has many elements
 Similarly, Jafar al-sadiq did not consider water, fire and air as elements
 Air is also considered a mixture of elements and told that each of these elements is necessary for breath
 Imam Sadiq in medical science said that all the elements found in the soil are also in the human body
 Among these, four elements are more in quantity, eight in lesser quantity and eight other in micro quantity
 Modern medical science confirms this
 unhone ek shishy ko bataaya, "jo pathar tum saamne gatiheen dekh rahe ho, uske andar bahut tej gatiyaan ho rahi hai
" uske baad kaha, "yah pathar bahut pehle drav avasthaa main tha
 aaj bhi agar is pathar ko bahut adhik garm kiya jaae to yah drav avasthaa main aa jaayegaa
" The basic principle of optics is that when light changes from an object to the eye, that object is visible
 It is mentioned by Imam Sadiq
 Once told in his lecture that powerful light can move even heavy objects
 This statement was confirmed after the invention of laser rays
 Their other miraculous principle is that every material has an opposite substance also present in the universe
 This was a glimpse of today's matter-antimatter Theory
 a Theory Imam told that the earth revolves around its axis
 Which was confirmed in the twentieth century
 Also, he also said that there is nothing stable in the universe
 Everything is in motion brahmand ke bare main ek rochak theory unhone bataai ki brahmand hameshaa ek jaisi avasthaa main nahin hota

 According to some references, the number of disciples of the Imam was more than four thousand
 People from far and wide used to come to him to gain knowledge
 Among his prominent disciples are Father of Chemistry Jabir Ibne Hayyan, Imam Abu Hanifa, who is named as the Hanafi branch of Islam, and the owner Ibn Anas, the promoter of the Maliki branch

 Their fear was also a reason behind this
 In the popularity of the Imam, he always felt his throne
 For all these reasons, the Arabic ruler Mansoor killed them by poisoning them in 765

 Karmabhoomi is Premchand's political novel which was first published in 1932
 aaj kai prakashkon dwaara iske kai sanskaran nikal chuke hai
 In this novel various political problems are presented through some families
 ye parivaar yadhyapi apni paariwarik samasyaon se jujh rahe hai tathaapi tatkaaleen raajnneetik aandolan main bhaag le rahe hai
 The plot of the novel deals with Kashi and the villages around it
 aandolan donon hi jagah hota he or donon kaa uddeshy kranti he
 But this revolution is influenced by Gandhiji's Satyagraha
 gandhiji kaa kahana tha ki jelon ko itnaa bhar dena chahie ki unamem jagah na rahe or is prakaar shanti or ahimsa se angrej sarkaar parajeet ho jaae
 This is the main problem of this novel
 upanyaas ke sabhi paatr jelon main thus die jate hai
 In this way, depicting the broad side of Premchand's revolution, we connect all the political and social problems in the plot
 nirdhanon ke makaan kii samasya, achhutoddhar kii samasya, achhuton ke mandir main pravesh kii samasya, bhartiya naariyon kii maryaada or satitv kii raksha kii samasya, british samrajya ke daman chakra se utpann samasyaayen, bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt dharmik pakhand kii samasya punarjagran or naveen chetana ke samaaj main sancharan kii samasya, raashtra ke liye aandolan karne waalon kii paariwarik samasyaayen aadi is upanyaas main bade yathartwaadee tareeke se vyakt hui hai
 Amarkant, the protagonist of 'karmabhoomi', is depicted as an unstable Gandhian
 amarkant tatkaaleen madhyamvarg kaa pratinidhi he, jisaki mul-pravriti sthiti ke prati samjhautavaadi he, uski raajnneetik drushti evam charitrik dridhtaa avishwasaneey he
 The spirit of mass community influenced by Gandhism, collective satyagraha, creative program of villages has been depicted with full faith
 inke sabhi charitron dwaara lekhak ne rashtriya chetana, adarsh paariwarik vyavastha aadi main gandhi darshan spasht kiya he
 Premchand's writing skills lie in the fact that he has depicted these problems with a sense of satiety that while reading the novel, the then National Satyagraha movement becomes alive before the eyes of the reader
 chaatro tathaa ghatnaon kii bahulata ke baavjood upanyaas na kahin bojhil hota he na kahin neeras
 Premchand keeps the doors of every character and event in his hand, so do not let looseness come anywhere

 On this, he had to become angry with Akbar
 akbar ne unpar ek karod kaa juramaana thonk diya or pravinrai ko jabaran bulavaa mangaaya
 Pravinaray appeared in the court and recited his poem and finally narrated Shah's attack, requesting: isapar akbar bada prasann hua or usne pravinrai ko orcha main hi rahane kii anumati de di
 No poems composed by Praveenraya were seen, but there are many verses made by him which reveal his poetic art-skills

 pashchimi pakistan, ek ikai vyavastha ke tahat, tatkaaleen pakistan kii pashchimi ikai thi, jo ab, vartmaan pakistan he
 The establishment of Pakistan was a direct result of the Pakistan movement, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 san 1947 main bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium ke paarit hone ke saath hi, bharat vibhaajan ke baad pakistan kii sthapana hui thi
 Under this division, Muslim dominated areas in the eastern and western ends of British India were included in Pakistan
 saath hi isi vibhaajan ke tahat, british-bharat ke punjab evam bengal praanton ko bhi vibhajit kar diya gaya or purvi bengal or pashchimi punjab ko pakistan main sammilit kar diya gaya
 The territory of Pakistan consisted of five provinces of British-ruled India: East Bengal, Western Punjab, Baluchistan, Sindh and north-west Frontier Province
 saath hi kuch riyasaton ne bhi pakistani sandh main shaamil hone kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya tha
 After partition, lakhs of people had migrated across this line in the name of religion
 tatpashchaat, kyonki us desh main koi bhi samvidhan nahin tha, isiilie pakistan ko 1935 ke bharat sarkaar adhinium ke antargat shasit kiya ja rahaatha
 An important reason for not being able to make a constitution was also that the political leadership of both the parts were not able to come to a position of coordination on many important topics related to the constitution
 vibhaajan va pakistan kii sthapana ke pashchaat, aisi sthiti main, vyavasthapika ko pakistan ke do pruthak bhaagon ko, jo kareeb hajaar mile kii bhartiya bhoomi se alag-thalag the, ko ek hi jagah se, prashasit karne main khaasi asuvidha kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 In addition, the western part itself was divided into four provinces, tribal areas and various princely states, while the eastern part was a province
 iske alaava, purvi bhaag main pashchimi bhaag ke mukaable, vyavastha, naukarshahi va sainya suraksha kii ati nishparyapti thi
 And, the western part was comparatively more developed and had a large army and sufficient bureaucracy and administration
 atah purvi bhaag, jo pashchim ke hi tulanaatmak jansankhya rakhata tha, ke liye vikaas va sampannataa kaa rasta kathin evam pashchim ke mukaable asamya tha
 In such a situation, apart from language and cultural issues in the mind of the eastern side, there were serious questions about the sharing of powers and facilities and the issue of strategic and economic equality
 is bhugolic sthiti se upji prashasnic va asamanta kii kathinaayee, va aarthik noummidi ke samaadhaan ke liye ek vishesh prantiy vyavastha kaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya, jise "ek ikai vyavastha" kaha gaya, jiske tahat donon hison main keval ek hi praant hoga, atah donon ko baraabar kii raajnneetik shakti praapt hogi
 Also, other development policies were also included in this plan
 pradhanmantri choudhary mohammad ali ne 14 oktob 1955 ko, 30 sitambar 1955 me pakistan kii rashtriya sabha main paarit, pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton ko mila dene ke adhinium ko karyanvit kar, van unit system ko lagu kar diya
 Earlier, it was officially announced on 22 November 1954 by Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra
 is sab ke atirikt, is vyavastha kaa ek or pahalu tha: kai raajnneetigyon kaa yah bhi prayaas tha kii pakistan ke vibhinn kshetreey paramparaon va samskritiyo ko khatm kar ke pakistan ko ek rashtriya samskruti ke taraf le jaaya jaye
 Therefore, from the end of various regional provinces, it would have been convenient to make the whole country a cultural unit
 atah is niti ko prantiy va kshetreey samskritiyon ko khatm kar, ek rashtriya samskruti ko badhaava dene ke liye bhi laayaa gaya tha
 a unit system or one-unit system, was a completely changed administrative system of Pakistan, under which the two different pieces of erstwhile Pakistani land were planned to be governed as "one administrative unit"
 is tarah kii prashasnic niti ko apnaane kaa mukhya kaaran, sarkaar dwaara, pakistani adhirajya ke do vibhakt evam pruthak bhugolic aanchalon kii ek hi kendriya vyavastha ke antargat shashan main aane vaali ghor prashasnic asuvidhaayen, evam bhugolic kathinaayeeyaan bataai gai thi
 Therefore, as a solution to this geographical and administrative subject, the government formulated a policy to establish these two geographical parts as two administrative units of Pakistan within a federation framework
 iske tahat, tatkaaleen mumalikaat-e-pakistan ke, purvi bhaag main maujuud sthiti ke anusaar hi, pashchimi bhaag ke paanchon praanton va unki prantiy sarkaron ko bhang kar, ek praant, pashchimi pakistan gathit kiya gaya, vahiin purvi bhaag ko purvi pakistan kah kar gathit kiya gaya
 Thus, Pakistan became a state divided into just two provinces under a unit scheme
 van unit yojana kii ghoshnaa pradhanmantri mohammad ali bogra ke shasankaal ke dauraan 22 november 1954 ko kii gai, or 14 oktober 1955 ko desh ke pashchimi bhaag ke sabhi praanton ko ekikrut kar, pashchimi pakistan praant gathit kiya gaya, jisamen, sabhi praanton ke alaava tatkaaleen, rajshahiyon or kabaili ilaake bhi shaamil the
 The province had 12 divisions, and its capital was Lahore
 duusari ore purvi bengal ke praant ko purvi pakistan kaa naam diya gaya, jisaki rajdhani dhaka thi
 The federal capital was shifted from Karachi to Rawalpindi in the year 1959, where the army headquarters was, and remained here until the completion of the new capital, Islamabad, while the federal legislature was established in Dhaka
 is niti kaa uddeshy bazaahir prashasnic sudhaar laana tha lekin kai lihaaj se yah bahut vinaashkari kadam tha
 Many states in western Pakistan joined Pakistan at the time of partition on the assurance that their autonomy would be maintained, but the decision to create a forest unit ended all local states
 is sambandh main bahawalpur, khiripor or kalaat ke rajya visheshkar ullekhneey hai
 Cases more serious this time 1958 AD
 ke takhtapalat ke baad mukhyamantri kaa pad samaapt kar diya gaya or raashtrapati ne pashchimi pakistan ke vikalp apane paas rakh liye
 Political experts also understand that the objective of uniting all the provinces of West Pakistan was to break the thrust of the linguistic and political unit of East Pakistan
 antat ek july 1970 ko raashtrapati yahya khan ne ek ikai kaa safaya karte hue pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton behaal kar diya

 jilam utak ke do prakaar ke tatwon arthath jilam vahikaaon or vahinicaon se hokar hi jal evam khanijon ko paudhon kii jadon se uski pattiyon tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Xylem vessels are a long tube consisting of dead cells attached at the ends
 ye ek nirjeev nalee hoti he, jo paudhe kii jadon se hoti hui prayek tane or pattee tak jaati he
 The ends of the cells are broken, so that an open tube is formed
 jilam vahikaaon mencytoplasm yaa nabhik nahin hota or vahikaaon kii deevaaren celulos yaa lignin se bani hoti hai
 In addition to the circulation of water and minerals, the xylem vessels strengthen the stem and keep it upward
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki lignin bahut sakht or majboot hota he
 Wood is made up of xylem vessels containing lignin
 jilam vahikaaon kii koshika bhitti main gadde hote hai, jahaan lignin jamaa nahin ho paata
 Either xylem vessels or both xylem vessels and ducts circulate water in flowering plants
 bina pushp vaale paudhon main vahinikaaye hi ek maatr aise utak hote hai, jo jal kaa parisancharan karte he
 The ducts are dead cells, and its walls are lignin-free and have no open ends
 ye lambii, patali or tantu ke aakaar vaali koshikaayen hoti hai
 Pits are found in these, through which water is circulated from one vessel to another
 sabhi paudhon main vahinikaaye paayi jaati hai
 == Before understanding the circulation process of water and minerals in a plant, it is necessary to know the meaning of the following important words == paudhe ke jad kii koshikaon kii bahari parat ko bahyatvacha kehete hai
 The thickness of the epidermis is equal to that of a cell
 kisi paudhe ke sanvahan utakon ke aasapaas upasthit koshikaon kii parat antahtvachakhalaati he
 It is the innermost layer of the cortex
 yah jad main bahyatvachaor antahtvachaa ke bich main paaya jane vaala hissaa hota he
 Herb / root xylem: This is the xylem tissue present in the roots, which is present in the center of the root
 bahyatvacha, root cortex or antahtvachaa jadon ke rome or root jilam ke bich sthit hote hai
 Therefore, the water absorbed from the soil by the root follicles first passes through the epidermis, root cortex and dermis and then finally reaches the root xylem
 iske alaava, mitti main khanij bhi paye jate hai
 Plants take these minerals from the soil as inorganic, such as nitrate and phosphate
 mitti se milane vaale khanij jal main ghulkar jaleey ghol banaate hai
 So when water is carried from the roots to the leaves, the minerals also dissolve in the water and they also reach the leaves with water
 jadon ke rome mitti se khanij ghule jal ko avashoshit kar lete hai
 The root follicles are in direct contact with the layer of water present between the soil particles
 khanij yukt jal jadon ke rome main jaataa he or paraasaran kii prakriya ke madhyam se koshikaon se hota hua bahyatvacha, rute cortex or antahtvachaa or root jilam main pahunchataa he
 The xylem vessels of the root of the plant are attached to the xylem vessels of the stem
 isliye jad kii jilam vahikaaon se jal tane kii jilam vahikaaon main jaataa he or phir paudhe ke danthal se hote hue paudhe kii pattiyon tak pahunchataa he
 Plants use only one to two percent water in photosynthesis, the rest of the water is added to the air in the form of water vapor
 jilam vahikaaye jal avashoshitakarti hampaudhe ke sheersh par dabaav kam rahata he, jabaki paudhe ke nichle hisse main dabaav adhik hota he
 Transpiration is due to the lower pressure at the top of the plant
 chunki paudhe ke sheersh par dabaav kam hota he, isliye jal jilam vahikaaon se paudhe kii pattiyon main sancharit hota he
 Evaporation from the leaves of the plant is called 'evaporation'
 paudhe kii pattiyon par chote–chote chhidr hote hai, jinhen ‘stomata’ kehete hai
 It is through this that water vapor forms and goes into the air
 yah jilam vahikaaon ke sheersh kaa dabaav kam kar detaa he or pani usamen sancharit hota he
 Transport of food and other substances In the process of light analysis, the food prepared in the leaves of a plant is transported to its other parts like stems, roots, branches, etc
 ye bhojan ek prakaar kii nalee ke jariye paudhon ke alag–alag hisson main pahunchataa he, ye nalee ‘floem’ kehalaati he
 The transfer of food from the leaves of the plant to other parts of the plant is called ‘transfer’
 pattiyon dwaara banaaya jane vaala bhojan saral sharkara ke rup main hota he
 Phloem is present in all parts of the plant
 floem main chaalani nalikaay paayi jaati hanfloem ek lambii nalee hoti he
 Many living cells connect to each other at the ends to form them
 floem kii jivit koshikaayen ‘chaalani nalikaay’ kehalaati hai
 In phloem, sieve strips are found on the last wall of cells, in which small holes are made
 inhen chhidron se hokar floem nalika ke sahare bhojan sancharit hota he
 The sieve ducts contain cytoplasm, but no nucleus
 prayek chaalani nalika koshika ke saath ek or koshika paayi jaati he, jisamen cendrak or kai anya koshikang upasthit hote hai
 The cell wall of the sieve tubes contains cellulose, but lignin is not found
 ==paudhon main bhojan ke parisancharan kiprakriya==atipi se mili urja kaa prayog kar paudhon kii pattiyon main bana bhojan floem utak kii chaalani nalikaaon main pravesh karata he
 After that, the process of osmosis enters the water containing sugars
 isse floem utak main dabaav badhata he
 The high pressure in phloem tissue serves to deliver food to all other low pressure parts of the plant
 is prakaar floem utak ke madhyam se paudhe ke sabhi hisson main bhojan pahunchaaya jaataa he

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga Ashok Sundari She is a Hindu Devakanya, described as the daughter of Lord Shiva and Parvati
 vah aam taur par mukhya shastron main shiv ke putree ke rup main varnit nahin hai, unki katha padmapurana main ankit he
 To overcome the loneliness of Mata Parvati, Ashok Sundari was composed by a tree called Kalpavriksha
 a+shok arthath sukh, mata parvati ko sukhi karne hetu hi unka nirmaan hua tha or vah atyant sundar thim isi kaaran inhen sundari kaha gaya
 The story of the birth of Ashok Sundari is told in the Padma Purana, which is the unit of characterization of a king named Nahusha
 ek baar mata parvati dwaara vishwa main sabase sundar udyaan laane ke aagrah se bhagwaan shiv parvati ko nandanvan le gayi, vahaan mata ko kalpavriksha se lagaav ho gaya or unhone us vriksh ko le liya
 Kalpavriksha is the wish fulfilling tree, Parvati asked that tree to remove her loneliness to get a girl, then Ashok Sundari was born by Kalpavriksha
 mata parvati nen us kanya ko vardaan diya ki uskaa vivaah devraj indra jitne shaktishaalee yuvak se hoga
 Once Ashok Sundari was visiting Nandanvan with her maids, then there was a demon named Hund who was fascinated by the beauty of Ashok Sundari and proposed marriage, then the girl told about her predecessor marriage in future
 
 rakshas nen kaha ki vah nahush ko maar daalega tab ashok sundari ne rakshas ko shraap diya ki uski mrityu nahush ke haathon hogi
 The demon kidnapped Nahusha from whom Nahusha was saved by a maid of Hund
 maharishi vashishtha ke ashram main nahush bada hua tathaa aage jaakar usne hund kaa vadh kiya
 Later Nahush and Ashok Sundari were married and she became the mother of brave sons like Yayati and hundred girls
 indra ke abhaav main nahush ko hi aasthaayee rup se indra banaaya gaya, uske ghamand ke kaaran use shraap mila tathaa isise uskaa patan hua
 Later Indra regained his throne

 hindi computary, bhashaa computary kaa ek prabhag he jo hindi bhashaa se sambandhit sakal kaaryon ko sanganak, mobile yaa anya digital yuktiyon par kar paane se sambandhit he
 It mainly deals with software tools and techniques that facilitate the use of Hindi in various ways on computers
 yadhyapi yah shabd bhashik rup se sahi nahin tha, sahi shabd devanagari computary / computing ho saktaa tha, parantu baad main uparokt vishay ke liye yahi shabd prachlit ho gaya
 Computers and internet have brought information revolution in the world in the last years
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa sanganak se dur rahakar logon se judi nahin rah sakati
 In the early period of computer development, very little attention was paid towards the use of computers in other languages of the world, except English, due to which the common people got the misconception that computer could not work in any language other than English
 
 kintu unicode ke padaarpan ke baad sthiti bahut teji se badal gayi
 At this time, Sajal, blog, bill, chat, search, simple mobile message and other Hindi content are available in Hindi
 is samay antarjaal par hindi main sanganan ke sansadhano kii bhi bharmaar he or nit naye bhashaa-computing ke saftware aate ja rahe hai
 There is a need to create awareness among people by giving information about them so that more and more people develop their own, Hindi and entire Hindi society using Hindi on computers
 computer ko purna rup se hindi main banane ke liye 2005 main microsoft ne vindos XP ke liye lip kaa nirmaan kiya jisase kii computer ko purna rup se hindi main banaaya ja sake
 In 2007, Microsoft also produced Leap for Windows Vista and in 2011 for Windows 7
 lip ko downlod karne ke liye yahaan par jaae- Also, some Linux has a Hindi interface
 aaj ke yug main ve hi bhashaayen batch paayengi jo sanganak or antarjaal se judi hongi; jinamein vividh kshetron kaa gyaan aanaline uplabdh hoga
 For this, different types of software are required which facilitate writing, searching, saving, changing its form etc
 isi liye hindi computary ke saftwaron kaa bahut hi mahatv he
 Pandavas are the main characters of Mahabharata
 pandav paanch bhai the - yudhisthir, bhimsen, arjuna, nakul tathaa sahadev
 The Pandava's father's name was Pandu
 ve bade hi pratapi kuruvanshi raja the! pandu kii do patniyaan thim - kunti tathaa maadri
 Yudhishthira was the mother of Bhima and Arjuna and was the son of Nakula and Sahadeva Madri
 ek baar raja pandu apni donon patniyon - kunti tathaa maadri - ke saath akhet ke liye van main gayi
 There, he saw a mating pair of deer
 pandu ne tatkaal apane baan se us mrug ko ghayal kar diya
 The dying deer cursed Pandu, "rajan! There will be no cruel man like you in this world
 tuune mujhe maithun ke samay baan maaraa he atah jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga teri mrityu ho jaayegi
 " is shaap se pandu atyant duhkhi huye or apni raniyon se bole, "he deviyon! ab main apni samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag kar ke is van main hi rahoonga tum log hastinapur laut jaao" unke vachanon ko sun kar donon raniyon ne duhkhi hokar kaha, "nath! ham aapke bina ek kshan bhi jivit nahin rah saktin
 Please also please keep us with you in the forest
 " pandu ne unke anurodh ko sweekaar kar ke unhen van main apane saath rahane kii anumati de di
 During this time, King Pandu saw sages and sages on Amavasya going to see Brahma
 unhone un rishi-muniyon se swayan ko saath le jane kaa aagrah kiya
 On his request, the sages and sages said, "rajan! No childless person can be entitled to go to Brahmaloka, so we are unable to take you with us
" " After listening to the sages and monks, Pandu said to his wife, "O Kunti, it is getting worse for me to be born because a childless person cannot get rid of father-debt, sage-loan, god-loan and man-loan
 Can you help me get a son? " Kunti said, "O Aryaputra! Durvasa Rishi has given me such a mantra by which i can get any thing desired by invoking any god
 aap ajna karen main kis devtaa ko bulaauun
 "at this, Pandu ordered to invite religion
 dharm ne kunti ko putr pradaan kiya jiskaa naam yudhisthir rakhaa gaya
 Later, Pandu ordered Kunti to invite Vayudev and Indradev twice
 vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna kii utpatti hui
 After this, by the command of Pandu, Kunti initiated the mantra to Madri
 maadri ne ashwanikumaron ko aamantrit kiya or nakul tathaa sahadev kaa janm hua
 One day King Pandu was touring along the Madri on the banks of Sarita in the forest
 vaataavaran atyant ramnik tha or sheethal-mand-sugandhit vaayu chal rahi thi
 Suddenly Madri's dress flew away with the wind
 isse pandu kaa man chanchal ho uthaa or ve maithun me pravruth huye hi the ki shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons

 parinamitra, kaary kii drushti se, kor kii drushti se evam aakaar-prakaar kii drushti se kai prakaar ke hote hai kintu abhikalpan ke aadhaar par inhen teen shreniyon main baant sakate hai- Crowded Transformer - Its core is a continuous magnetic path
 crode ke vibhinn khandon main praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyaan sthit hoti hai
 Sometimes the primary and secondary components are on different sides of a rectangular core
 kavachavaale parinamitra - ye croadwale parinamitron se bhinn hote hai
 In these, the coils are located in the central part of a substance and the magnetic circuit is completed in two or more paths
 shakti parinamitra, crode or kavach donon prakaar ke banate hai
 Open core transformers - The primary and secondary coils are spirally and concentrically located on a straight core
 ye chote aakaar ke taiyaar kiye jate hai
 They are used in some telephony equipment
 ve transformar shakti transformar kehalaate hai jinka mukhya uddeshy vidyut shakti ko praathmik vinding se dwitiyak vinding main hastaantarit karnaa hota he
 Although all transformers have some or the same electrical power transferred from primary to secondary coils, but the amount of power transferred in power transformers is relatively high
 shakti transformar voltata ko kam yaa adhik bhi karte hai
 Apart from this, it also provides separation in primary and secondary
 shakti transformar ke kuch udhaaharan hai- These transformers are used to measure current, voltages or power and to close the circuit if their values exceed the specified value
 pulse tramsformar vah transformar he jise ytaakar vidyut palson ko transmit karne ke dhyey se vishesh rup se dizin kiya jaataa he
 The rise time and fall time of these pulses are less and the amplitude is almost fixed
 acha pulse transformar vah he jo aisi palon ko kam se kam parivartan ke saath dwitiyak vinding main de sake
 That is, the rise and fall time of the pulse received in the secondary winding should be reduced and 'droop' should not come in the amplitude
 isamen prayavarti dhara kaa parinman ek hi kundali se sampann hota he
 Hence, its name is Swarnamitra
 iskaa kaary sancharan vibhavamaapi ke samaan he
 The primary voltage used is given the opportunity to develop throughout the coil
 nivesh or nirgat main ek terminal ubhaynishth hota he
 The output voltage is changed by sliding a contact point along the coil
 isse nivesh voltata kii shunya se lekar anek guni samyojya, prayavarti voltata praapt kii ja sakati he
 It is widely used in laboratories and industries
 ye parinamitra sthir voltata pradaan karte hai, bhale hi nivesh voltata kaa vicharan vistrut simaaon ke bich hota rahe
 This self-control is caused by a manifold coil in both primary and secondary circuits
 dwitiyak kundaliyon main se ek ko uske aarpaar sandharitra jodakar anunaadi banaaya jaataa he
 This part of the secondary and the residual part of the secondary coil have a 180-degree shift in voltage
 at: samast dwitiyak kundalan ke aar paar parinami voltata sthir rahati he
 In addition, high magnetic flux density helps in automatic compensation
 jab praathmik voltata 95 se 135 volt main badalati he tab dwitiyak voltata keval pratishat hi badalati he
 Changing load values does not change this range
 vyapaarik sthir-voltata-parinamitra uplabdh hai or proyshaalaon tathaa udyogon main vyapak rup se upyog main aate hai
 These maintain the distance between the primary and secondary with a useful device
 isse sthir dhara utpann hoti he, jo nivesh voltata ke parivartanon se prabhavit nahin hoti
 Power transformers act at constant frequency and cannot be used in case of change of frequency
 sanchaar ejiniyari main aise parinamitron kaa upyog hota he, jo jatil or parivarti swarupawali dhara se sambharan hone par, aavritiyon kii vistrut simaaon main dakshatapurvak kaary kar saken
 It has many uses in radio-telephony, radio telegraphy, radio-receiver and many electronic circuits
