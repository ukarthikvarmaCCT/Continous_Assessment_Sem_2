 It is said that Ravana used to protect his kingdom Lanka from Panchshul
 chunki vaidyanath jyotirling ko lanka le jane ke liye kailash se ravan hi lekar aayaa tha par vidhaataa ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd

 India is vast and very diverse in terms of area and population, in such a situation it was natural for India to adopt federal governance and this is done by the Indian Constitution
 samvidhan ke pratham anuchhed main kaha gaya he ki ’’bharat, rajyon kaa ek sangh hoga
 "but the constitution-makers were eager to keep away the weaknesses of the Indian Union system even after adopting the federal rule and because of this the federal rule of India has adopted some traits of unitary rule
" vastav main, bhartiya samvidhan main sangheey-shashan ke lakshan pramukh rup se or ekaatmak shashan ke lakshan gaun rup se vidyaman hai
 Four characteristics of federal governance can be said in the Indian Union system: bhartiya samvidhan main sanghatmak shashan ke ye sabhi pramukh lakshan vidyaman hai
 India being a very large and diverse country, it was considered appropriate by the Constitution-makers to establish federal rule in India, but the Constitution-makers were also aware of the fact of Indian history that whenever central power in India was weakened
 Then, the unity of India was disbanded and had to be subjugated

 In most elections in the two-party system, one party gets an absolute majority and soon forms a new government; The "hung parliament" is an exception to this structure and may be considered irregular or undesirable

 For many generations in the United Kingdom before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed; Traditionally only the Tories and Whigs, or from the mid-nineteenth century, the Conservative and Liberal parties succeeded in electing their members in Parliament in large numbers

 The possibility of change arose after the Act of Union reached the Parliament after 1800 with many Irish parliamentarians, although initially they followed traditional sides

 However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish self-government, resulting in a general election again in 1886 in which the Conservatives ruled with the support of the Liberal Unionist Party opposing Swaraj, occupying most of the seats

 According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart wilks-heig, the common usage of the term "hung parliament" in the UK began only after the mid-1970s and was first used in the press in 1974 by journalist Simon Hogart in The Guardian

 Ever since the two-party system was strengthened in 1910, there have been only two hung parliaments, in 1940 and 2010
 In the 1940 federal election, outgoing Prime Minister Robert Menzais received the support of two independent independents and remained in power, but during the parliamentary term, independent members lent their support to Labor and John Curtin rose to power

 Other states and territories primarily have a two-party system, but at times hung parliaments are held, in which the key to power is held by independent mps and representatives of smaller parties

 Psychology is an educational and applied discipline that conducts a systematic and scientific study of the mental processes, experiences and behaviors of the expressed and latent types of animals
 duusare shabdon main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki manovigyaan ek aisa vigyaan he jo krambaddh rup se prekshniya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he tathaa praani ke bheetar ke maansik evam daihik prakriyaaon jaise - chintan, bhav aadi tathaa vaataavaran kii ghatnaon ke saath unka sambandh jodakar adhyayan karata he
 In this perspective, psychology has been called the science of studying behavioral and mental processes
 'vyavhaar' main maanav vyavhaar tathaa pashu vyavhaar donon hi sammilit hote hai
 Under mental processes comes sensing, attention, observation, learning, memory, thinking etc
 manovigyaan anubhav kaa vigyaan he, iskaa uddeshy chetnavastha kii prakriya ke tattvon kaa vishleshan, unke paraspar sambandhon kaa swaroop tathaa unhen nirdhaarit karanevaale niyamon kaa pataa lagaana he
 Definitions of psychology: - prak-vaigyanik kaal main manovigyaan, darshanashastra kaa ek shakha tha
 When Wilhelm Wunt opened the first laboratory of psychology in 1879, psychology was able to break out of the clutches of philosophy to become an independent science
 manovigyaan par vaigyanik pravriti ke saath-saath darshanashastra kaa bhi bahut adhik prabhaav padaa he
 In fact the scientific tradition started later
 pehle to prayog yaa paryvekshan ke sthaan par vichaarvinimay tathaa chintan samasyaon ko sulajhane kii sarvamaanya vidhiyaan thim
 The names of some of the scholars who have put psychological problems into philosophy
 decort ne manushya tathaa pashuon main bhed karte hue bataaya ki manushyon main aatma hoti he jabaki pashu keval mashin kii bhanti kaam karte hai
 Due to the soul, man has willpower
 pituitary granthi par sharir tathaa aatma paraspar ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai
 According to Decart, there are some ideas of human beings that can be called inborn
 unka anubhav se koi sambandh nahin hota
 According to Leibniz, the whole substance is made up of the "monad" unit
 unhone chetnavastha ko vibhinn matraaon main vibhajit karke lagbhag do sau varsh baad aanevaale frid ke vichaaron ke liye ek buniyaad taiyaar kii
 Locke speculated that to understand the nature of man, it is necessary to know the source of ideas
 unhone vichaaron ke paraspar sambandh vishyak siddhant pratipaadit karte hue bataaya ki vichaar ek tatv kii tarah hote hai or mastishk unka vishleshan karata he
 He said that the primary qualities in each object are inherent in the object itself
 gaun gun vastu main nihit nahin hote varan vastu vishesh ke dwaara unka bodh avashya hota he
 Berkeley said that the realization of reality is not in the form of matter but in the form of suffix
 unhone duuri kii samvednaake vishay main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha ki abhibinduta dhundhalepan tathaa swat: samaayojan kii sahaayta se hamen duuri kii samvednaa hoti he
 Locke's statement about the relationship between the brain and matter was that the brain perceives through matter
 hum ne mukhya rup se "vichaar" tathaa "anumaan" main bhed karte hue kaha ki vichaaron kii tulana main anumaan adhik uttejnapurna tathaa prabhaavshaalee hote hai
 The ideas can be considered a copy of the conjecture
 hum ne kaary-kaaran-siddhant ke vishay main apane vichaar spasht karte hue aadhunik manovigyaan ko vaigyanik paddati ke nikat pahunchaane main ullekhneey sahaayta pradaan kii
 Hartley can be named among the somatic psychological philosophers
 unke anusaar snaayu-tantuon main hue kampan ke aadhaar par samvednaa hoti he
 In the background of this idea were the facts propounded by Newton stating that the sensation continues even after the stimulant is removed
 hartle ne saahchary vishyak niyam bataate hue saannnidhya ke siddhant par adhik jor diya
 After Hartley, there was no notable work in the field of associativeism for nearly 70 years
 is bich scotland main read ne vastuon ke pratyakshikaran kaa varnan karte hue bataaya ki pratyakshikaran tathaa samvednaa main bhed karnaa aavashyak he
 The properties of a particular object are sensed while that of the whole object is perceptible
 samvednaa keval kisi vastu ke gunon tak hi simit rahati he, kintu pratyakshikaran dwaara hamen us puri vastu kaa gyaan hota he
 Meanwhile, in France, Condillac laid the foundations of empiricism and La Matrie the trends of materialism
 kandilank kaa kahana tha ki samvedan hi sampurna gyaan kaa "mul strot" he
 He did not consider the ideas or experiences stated by Locke to be absolutely necessary
 laa metry ne kaha ki vichaar kii utpatti mastishk tathaa snaayumandal ke paraspar prabhaav ke falswaroop hoti he
 Like Deckart, he also considered a human being like a machine
 unka kahana tha ki sharir tathaa mastishk kii bhanti aatma bhi nashvan he
 Laying the foundation of motivators in modern psychology, La Matri stated that happiness is the ultimate goal of life
 james mil tathaa baad main unke putr jaan stuart mil ne maansik rasayani kaa vikaas kiya
 Both these scholars formalized the tendency of associativeism and laid the appropriate background for Wunt
 ben ke bare main yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Kant adopted the method of subjectivism in the solution of problems that supported the birthright in the principle of the articulation of the external world
 harbart ne manovigyaan ko ek swaroop pradaan karne main mahatvapunr yogadan kiya
 According to him, psychology is an elemental, quantitative and analytical science based on empiricism
 unhone manovigyaan ko tathvik ke sthaan par bhautik aadhaar pradaan kiya or lotse ne isi disha main ore aage pragati kii
 The scientific study of psychological problems had already begun after their formal appearance
 san 1834 main webar ne spershendriya sambandhi apane prayogtmak shodhakarya ko ek pustak rup main prakashit kiya
 In 1831, Fekner himself had published a very important article on the subject of measurement of direct current
 kuch varshon baad san 1847 main helmo ne urja sarankshan par apana vaigyanik lekh logon ke saamne rakhaa
 After this, in 1856 AD, 1860 and 1866, he published a book called "optic" in three parts
 san 1851 i tathaa san 1860 i main feknar ne bhi manovaigyanik drushti se do mahatvapurn granth ne german bhashaa main "eliments aav psycofizix" naamak pustak prakashit kii, jisamen ki unhone manovaigyanik samasyaon ko vaigyanik paddati ke parivesh main adhyayan karne kii teen vishesh pranaaliyon kaa vidhiwat varnan kiya : madhya truti vidhi, nunatam parivartan vidhi tathaa sthir uttejk bhed vidhi
 Even today, many important research is done in psychological laboratories on the basis of these systems
 vaigyanik manovigyaan main feknar ke baad do anya mahatvapurn naam he : helmolts tathaa wilhem vunt 
 Helmolts, by many experiments, gave important rules concerning the astrological
 is sandarbh main unhone pratyakshikaran par anusandhan kaary dwaara manovigyaan kaa vaigyanik astitv upar uthaaya
 Wunt's name is particularly notable in psychology
 unhone san 1879 i main lipzig vishvavidhyalay main manovigyaan kii pratham prayogshaala sthapit kii
 Defined the formal form of psychology
 lipazig kii prayogshaala main vunt tathaa unke sahyogiyon ne manovigyaan kii vibhinn samasyaon par ullekhneey prayog kiye, jisamen samay-abhikriya vishyak prayog vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hai
 The names of herring scholar Herring, physics scholar Macha and GE Mueller are also notable
 hering ghatana-kriya-vigyaan ke pramukh pravartakon main se the or is pravriti kaa manovigyaan par prabhaav daalane kaa kaaphi shrey unhen diya ja saktaa he
 Mech did highly impressive experimental research on the articulation of physical cruises
 unhone saath hi saath aadhunik pratyakshvaad kii buniyaad bhi daali
 GE Muller was indeed a student of philosophy and history, but as a result of his correspondence with Fekner, his attention turned to psychological problems
 unhone smriti tathaa drushtindriya ke kshetra main manodaihiki vidhiyon dwaara anusandhan kaary kiya
 In this context, he also discovered the "jast rule", that if there are two associates of the same power, then by repeating, the old association will become stronger than the new one
 vyavhaar vishyak niyamon kii khoj hi manovigyaan kaa mukhya dhyey tha
 Various approaches were presented at the theoretical level
 manovigyaan ke kshetra main san 1912 i ke aasapaas sanrachnawad, kriyavaad, vyavahaarwad, gestaltwad tathaa manovishleshan aadi mukhya mukhya shakhaon kaa vikaas hua
 The promoters of all these promises were unanimous that the scientific study of human behavior is the aim of psychology
 unamem paraspar matbhed kaa vishay tha ki is uddeshy ko praapt karne kaa sabase acha dhang koun sa he
 The followers of Structureism were of the opinion that to explain behavior, it is necessary to understand the anatomical structures through which behavior is possible
 kriyavaad ke maananevaalon kaa kahana tha ki shaareerik sanrachana ke sthaan par prekshan yogya tathaa drishyman vyavhaar par adhik jor hona chahie
 On this basis, Watson later established pragmatism
 gestaltwaadiyon ne pratyakshikaran ko vyavahaaravishayak samasyaon kaa mul aadhaar mana
 In practice, they were of the opinion that the tendency to get a well organized system was predominant
 frid ne manovishleshanvaad kii sthapana dwaara yah bataane kaa prayaas kiya ki hamaare vyavhaar ke adhikansh kaaran achetan prakriyaaon dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai
 All of these "promises" in modern psychology now remain of historical importance
 inke sthaan par manovigyaan main adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye vibhinn shakhaon kaa vibhaajan ho gaya he
 In experimental psychology, mainly the same problems were studied by psychological method which philosophers first solved by thinking or deliberation
 arthath samvednaa tathaa pratyakshikaran
 Later, learning processes were also studied under it
 prayogtmak manovigyaan, aadhunik manovigyaan kii pracheenatam shakha he
 Animals can be kept in more controlled conditions than humans, as well as the anatomy of animals is not as complex as humans
 pashuon par prayog karke vyavhaar sambandhi niyamon kaa gyaan sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Around 1912, Thorndike developed comparative or animal psychology by experimenting on animals
 kintu pashuon par praapt kiye gaye parinaam kahan tak manushyon ke vishay main lagu ho sakate hai, yah jaanane ke liye vikasaatmak kram kaa gyaan bhi aavashyak tha
 Apart from this, the rules of behavior can be rendered in the same condition when there is complete and proper knowledge of the development of humans or animals
 is sandarbh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vikasaatmak manovigyaan kaa janm hua
 Soon after 1912, social psychology was established as a result of macdougall's efforts, although its foundation was laid long ago by social scientist Herbert Spencer
 dhire-dhire gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon par manovigyaan kaa prabhaav anubhav kiya jane laga
 It was hoped that psychology could be useful in solving problems in other disciplines
 saath hi saath, adhyayan kii janevaali samasyaon ke vibhinn paksh saamne aae
 As a result, new branches of psychology developed
 inamen se kuch ne abhi haal main hi janm liya he, jinamein prerak manovigyaan, sattatmak manovigyaan, ganitiya manovigyaan vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 There are both basic and applied branches of psychology
 isaki mahatvapurn shakhaaen saamaajik evam paryaavaran manovigyaan, sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar / manovigyaan, clinical manovigyaan, maargdarshan evam paraamarsh, audyogic manovigyaan, vikasaatmak, aapraadhik, praayogic paraamarsh, pashu manovigyaan aadi he
 Despite being different, these branches are interrelated
 naidanik manovigyaan - neuroticism, psiconurosis, psychosis jaisi clinical samasyaon evam shizophrenia, histyria, obsesive-compalsive vikaar jaisi samasyaon ke kaaran clinical manovaigyanik kii aavashyaktaa din-pratidin bad rahi he
 The major task of such a psychologist is to detect diseases and use diagnostic and various therapeutic techniques
 vikaas manovigyaan main jivan bhar ghatit honevaale manovaigyanik sangyanatmak tathaa saamaajik ghatnakram shaamil hai
 It studies behavior during infancy, childhood and adolescence or changes from adult to old age
 pehle ise bal manovigyaan bhi kehete the
 Criminal psychology is a challenging field where work is done in relation to the behavior of criminals
 aparaadh shaastra, manovigyaan aapraadhik vigyaan kii shakha he, jo aparaadh tathaa sambandhit tathyon kii tahakikat se judi he
 Animal psychology is a wonderful branch
 manovigyaan kii pramukh shakhaayen hai - The most important category to understand the field of psychology correctly is the category that shows what psychologists want? Psychologists can be divided into three categories based on the work done: is tarah se manovigyaniyon kaa teen pramukh kaaryakshetra he—shikshan, shodh tathaa upyog 
 The following is a description of the main facts related to these three areas
 shikshan tathaa shodh manovigyaan kaa ek pramukh kaary kshetra he
 From this perspective, psychologists show their interest in the following branches under this field- bal manovigyaan kaa praarambhik sambandh maatr bal vikaas ke adhyayan se tha parantu haal ke varshon main vikasaatmak manovigyaan main kishoravastha, vayaskavastha tathaa vriddhavastha ke adhyayan par bhi bal daalaa gaya he
 This is why it is called 'life span developmental psychology'
 vikasaatmak manovigyaan main manovigyaan maanav ke lagbhag prayek kshetra jaise—buddhi, peshiy vikaas, saanvegic vikaas, saamaajik vikaas, khel, bhashaa vikaas kaa adhyayan vikasaatmak drushtikon se karte hai
 It also studies the effects of certain factors like heredity, maturity, family environment, socio-economic difference on behavior development
 kul manovigyaniyon kaa 5% manovaigyanik vikasaatmak manovigyaan ke kshetra main karyrat hai
 Human experimental psychology is an area where all the behaviors of humans are studied on which it is possible to experiment
 saiddhanthik rup se aise to maanav vyavhaar ke kisi bhi pahalu par prayog kiya ja saktaa he parantu manovigyaani usee pahalu par prayog karne kii koshish karte hai jise pruthak kiya ja sake tathaa jiske adhyayan kii prakriya saral ho
 In this way, experimental studies of behaviors like vision, hearing, thinking, learning, etc
 have been done much more
 maanav prayogtmak manovigyaan main un manovaigyanikon ne bhi kaaphi abhiruchi dikhalaayaa he jinhen prayogtmak manovigyaan kaa sansthaapak kaha jaataa he
 Among these, the names of William Wunt, Titchener and Watson etc
 are more famous
 manovigyaan kaa yah kshetra maanav prayogtmak vigyaan ke samaan he
 The only difference is that here the experiment is done on animals such as mice, cats, dogs, monkeys, forest animals etc
 pashu prayogtmak manovigyaan main adhiktar shodh seekhney kii prakriya tathaa vyavhaar ke jaivik pahaluon ke adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 In the field of animal experimental psychology, the names of Skinner, Guthrie, Pavlava, Tallman etc
 are taken prominently
 sachai yah he ki seekhney ke aadhunik sidghant tathaa maanav vyavhaar ke jaivik pahalu ke bare main ham aaj jo kuch bhi jaanate hai, uskaa aadhaar pashu prayogtmak manovigyaan hi he
 This psychology tries to understand the behavior of animals
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki yadi manovigyaan kaa mukhya sambandh maanav vyavhaar ke adhyayan se he to pashuon ke vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan karnaa koi adhik tarksangat baat nahin dikhataa
 But psychologists have some compulsions due to which they show interest in the behavior of animals
 jaise pashu vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kam kharchila hota he
 Then there are some experiments which are not possible to do on human beings from moral point of view and the shortening of life span of animals is the main reason
 maanav evam pashu prayogtmak manovigyaan ke kshetra main kuch manovigyaniyon kii sankhya kaa kareeb 14% manovigyaani karyrat he
 The field of psychologists in somatic psychology is to study the somatic determinants of animal behavior and their effects
 is tarah ke daihik manovigyaan kii ek aisi shakha he jo jaivik vigyaan se kaaphi judaa hua he
 It is also called psychoanalysis
 aajkal mastishkeey kaary tathaa vyavhaar ke sambandhon ke adhyayan main manovaigyanikon kii ruchi adhik ho gayi he
 This has given rise to a new interdisciplinary feature known as 'neurology'
 isi tarah ke daihik manovigyaan hormones kaa vyavhaar par padane vaale prabhaavon ke adhyayan main bhi abhiruchi rakhte hai
 Nowadays, different types of drugs and their effects on behavior are also being studied in the physiological psychology
 isse bhi ek nayi vishistataa kaa janm hua he jise manodermacology kaha jaataa he tathaa jisamen vibhinn aushadhon ke vyavhaaraatmak prabhaav se lekar tantreey tathaa chayapachay prakriyaaon main hone vaale aanvik shodh tak kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc

 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization
 is prakaar 28 / 9 / 1925 ko apane pita-tulya guru dow baalkrishna shivaram munje, unke shishy dow headgavar, shri paranjape or baapu sahib soni ne ek hindu yuvak club kii neenv daali, jiskaa naam kalantar main rashtriya swanyasevak sangh diya gaya l It is worth mentioning here that the basis of this militia was formed - Veer Savarkar's Rashtriya Philosophy book in which it was defined as Hindu - a indus-indus era, Yes India role
 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc
 Biographies were read l used to tell me to read portions of the book written by Savarkar l thode samay baad is milicia ko naam diya gaya rashtriya swanyasevak sangh- jo aar

 dow headgavar ne jis dukhad sthiti ko vyakt kiya, usamen navsarjeet rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or hindu mahasabha ke netritv ke prayaas se- hindu yuvaaon main saahas ke saath yah naaraa gunjane laga “hindusthan hinduon kaa- nahin kisi ke baap kaa” is kathan kii vivechna dow headgavar ne in shabdon main kii:- “many gentlemen do not hesitate to say how Hindusthan is only for Hindus? This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics
