 pandav, garasain tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Sati was the daughter of Daksha Prajapati and the consort of Lord Shiva
 inaki utpatti tathaa ant kii katha vibhinn puraanon main vibhinn roopon main uplabdh hoti he
 Due to the predominance of Lord Shiva in the Shaiva Puranas, Shiva is said to be the ultimate element and power as his follower
 isi ke samanaantar shakt puraanon main shakti kii pradhanta hone ke kaaran shakti ko paramashkti tathaa bhagwaan shiv ko unka anugami bataaya gaya he
 The Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana has a relatively neutral description
 isamen daksh kii swymbhuv manu kii putree prasuti ke garbh se 16 kanyaon ke janm kii baat kahi gayi he
 14 girls have been mentioned in Devipuran and sixty girls of Daksha have been mentioned in Shivpuran out of which 27 were married to Moon
 in kanyaon main ek sati bhi thi
 According to Shiv Puran, Brahma ji was worried about Lord Shiva's marriage, then he praised Lord Vishnu and Vishnu ji was pleased and told Brahma ji that if Lord Shiva is to get married then worship Goddess Shiva
 unhone bataaya ki daksh se kahie ki vah bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karen or unhen prasann karke apni putree hone kaa vardaan maange
 If Goddess Shiva is pleased then all the work will be successful
 unke kathananusaar brahma ji ne daksh se bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karne ko kaha or prajapati daksh ne devi shiva kii ghor tapasya kii
 Pleased with his penance, Shiva gave him a boon that i will be born as your daughter
 main to sabhi janmon main bhagwaan shiv kii daasi hoon; atah main swayan bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke unhen prasann karuungi or unki patni banungi
 At the same time, he also told Daksha that when your respect will be reduced to me, then at the same time i will abandon my body, get absorbed in my form or wear another body
 prayek sarg yaa kalp ke liye daksh ko unhone yah vardaan de diya
 Accordingly, Bhagwati Shiva takes birth as the daughter of Daksha in the name of Sati and pleases Lord Shiva by performing intense penance and is married to Lord Shiva
 iske baad kii katha shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main varnit katha ke kaaphi had tak anuroop hi he
 In Prayag, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of the Prajapati, all the gods stand and honor him, but Lord Shiva is also sitting with Brahma
 loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan maanane ke kaaran daksh unke khadey na hokar apane prati aadar prakat na karne ke kaaran apana apmaan mahasoos karata he or isi kaaran unhone bhagwaan shiv ke prati anek katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue unhen yajna bhaag se vanchit hone kaa shaap de diya
 After this, Manomalinya was born in Daksha and Lord Shiva
 tatpashchaat apni rajdhani kankhal main daksh ke dwaara ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya gaya jisamen unhone na to bhagwaan shiv ko aamantrit kiya or na hi apni putree sati ko
 Sati saw Rohini going with the moon by plane and after Sakhi came to know that they were going to take part in her father Daksha's Virat Yajna, Sati's mind was also disturbed to go there
 bhagwaan shiv ke samajhane ke baavjood sati kii vyakulata bani rahi or bhagwaan shiv ne apane ganon ke saath unhen vahaan jane kii ajna de di
 But not seeing the sacrifice of Lord Shiva going there, Sati objected and Sati consumed her body with Yogagni because of the utmost disrespectful things being said by Daksha to her and her husband Lord Shiva
 shivganon ke dwaara utpaat machaaye jane par bhrigu rishi ne dakshinagni main aahuti di or usase utpann rubhu naamak devataaon ne shivganon ko bhaga diya
 Very upset with this news, Lord Shiva produced Veerabhadra with his hair and Veerabhadra went with Gana and destroyed Daksha Yagya; Punished Shiva's adversary gods and sages as appropriate and cut Daksha's head and burnt it in the Havan Kund
 tatpashchaat devataaon sahit brahma ji ke dwaara stuti kiye jane se prasann bhagwaan shiv ne punah yajna main hui kshatiyon kii purti kii tathaa daksh kaa sir jal jane ke kaaran bakre kaa sir judwa kar unhen bhi jivit kar diya
 Then the yagna was completed by his grace
 shakt mat main shakti kii sarvapradhanta hone ke kaaran brahma, vishnu evam shiv teenon ko shakti kii krupa se hi utpann mana gaya he
 It is described in the Devi Purana that Purna Prakriti Jagadambika created three Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and appointed them in the works of creation
 unhone hi brahama ko srujankarta, vishnu ko paalankarta tathaa apni icchaanusaar shiv ko sanhaarkarta hone kaa aadesh diya
 Before obeying the order, these three started doing penance to get those divine power as their wife
 jagdambika dwaara pareekshan main asafal hone ke kaaran brahma evam vishnu ko purna prakruti ansh rup main patni banakar praapt hui tathaa bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya se param prasann hokar jagdambika ne swayan janm lekar unki patni banane kaa aashwaasan diya
 Accordingly, on being inspired by Brahma ji, Daksha meditated on the same Purna Prakriti Jagadambika and pleased with his austerity, Jagadambika gave his boon to be born as his daughter and also told that when the virtue of Daksha diminishes that power After destroying the world, she will return to her abode
 ukt vardaan ke anuroop purna prakruti ne sati ke naam se daksh kii putree rup main janm grahan kiya or uske vivaah yogya hone par daksh ne uske vivaah kaa vichaar kiya
 Daksha did not understand the influence of Lord Shiva with his cosmic intelligence and considered his disguise immortal and did not consider him worthy of Sati
 atah unhone vichaar kar bhagwaan shiv se shunya swayamvar sabha kaa aayojan kiya or sati se aagrah kiya ki ve apni pasand ke anusaar var chun le
 Seeing Lord Shiva not present, Sati put the Varmala on the Earth by saying 'shivaay Namah' and Maheshwar Shiva himself attended and received that Varmala and returned to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 daksh bahut dukhi hue
 With Sati choosing her husband as her husband against her will, Daksha's mind was filled with anger towards them both
 isiilie baad main apni rajdhani main yojit viraat yajna main daksh ne shiv evam sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya
 Yet Sati stubbornly refused to go to the yagna of her father and showed him his terrible form by being extremely angry when repeated by Shiva
 isse bhayakrant hokar shivaji ke bhaagane kaa varnan hua he or unhen rokane ke liye jagdambika ne 10 rup dhaaran kiya
 Then on Shiva's asking, he introduced his ten forms
 phir shiv ji dwaara kshamaa yachana karne ke pashchaat purna prakruti muskura kar apane pita daksh ke yajna main jane ko utsuk hui tab shiv ji ne apane gamon ko kah kar bahusankhyak singhon se jute rath mangvakar us par asin karwaakar bhagwati ko sasamman daksh ke ghar bheja
 The rest of the story is often in line with the predetermined story with certain differences, but in this tale, the enraged Sati Chasati gets interrupted by ordering Leela and the talk does not end when that Chasati is consumed, but Shiva is pleased with the yagna of perfection
 After giving the hint, the corpse of Chasanti is safely and resplendently reunited in the Yajshala of Daksha and then by Goddess Shakti in the east
 Despite being told as Ishywani Cosmic Men like Shiva mourning and wandering like neurotic holding zombies head of Sati
 isse trast devataaon ko traan dilaane tathaa paristhiti ko sanbhaalane hetu bhagwaan vishnu sudarshan chakra se sati kii laash ko kramshah khand-khand kar katate jate hai
 In this way, due to the falling of various parts of Sati and ornaments at different places, those places became full of the glory of Shaktipeeth
 is prakaar 51 shaktipeethon kaa nirmaan ho gaya
 When Sati's body was no longer there, when Lord Shiva worriedly asked the gods, the gods told him everything
 is par nirishwaas chhodte hue bhagavan shiv ne bhagwaan vishnu ko treta yug main suryvansh main avatar lekar isi prakaar patni se viyukt hone kaa shaap de diya or phir swayan 51 shaktipeethon main sarvapradhan 'kamrup' main jaakar bhagwati kii aradhana kii or us purna prakruti ke dwaara agali baar himalay ke ghar main parvati ke rup main purnavatar lekar punah unki patni banane kaa var praapt hua
 Thus, in the next birth, Sati became the daughter of Himalayas in the form of Parvati and Lord Shiva again got her wife

 Newton's contemporary German scholar Haigenz, in 1678, proposed the 'wave theory of light'
 iske anusaar samast sansar main ek atyant halakaa or rahasyamay padaarth ether bharaa hua he : taron ke bich ke vishaal shunyakash main bhi or thos dravya ke andar tathaa parmaanuon ke abhyantar main bhi
 Light is the very short elongated waves in this god sea
 laal prakaash kii tarangen sabase lambii hoti hai or bangnee kii sabase choti
 This led to the interpretation of mutation and mutation easily, because these events are just waveforms
 dhruvan kii ghatnaon se yah bhi pragat ho gaya ki tarangen anudairdhya nahin, varan anuprastha hai
 Hygrange's wavelets are also well understood by the hypothesis of reflection and reflection and the sum of both
 kintu ab do kathinaaiyaan rah gayi

 duusare yah samaj main nahi aayaa ki ether kii ragad ke kaaran aganit varsho se teevr veg se ghoomte hue grahon or upgrahon kii gati main kinchinmaatr bhi kami kyon nahin hoti
 Even more difficult than this was that no one had the courage and strength to oppose a great scientist like Newton
 at: praaia: do shatabdi tak kanikasiddhant hi kaa samrajya akshunn rahaa
 In 1807, Young made the use of interpolation very clearly
 iske baad fenal ne tarangon dwaara hi saral rekha gaman kii bhi bahut acchhee vyakhya kar di
 In 1850, Fuco also proved by direct measurement that light-dense mediums are less than air in more dense mediums such as water
 yah baat kanikasiddhant ke pratikul tathaa tarang ke anukool hone ke kaaran tarangasidhant sarvamaanya ho gaya
 After this, the observations of many new and surprising events were also proved true by observation through this theory
 ab prashn yah rahaa ki ether kis prakaar kaa padaarth he
 It is known that in any elastic fluid jahaan If the wave is longitudinal then v = / p) 1 / 2 - yadi tarang anuprastha he to v = 1 / 2 -- No material in the world is known whose values of elasticity and density are such that its wave velocity is 3 x 108 m
 Possible per second
 at: prakaash tarang kaa madhyam dravya nahin ho saktaa
 It is a singular substance and due to the transverseness of these waves, it is also undisputed that ether is a solid substance like a solid or jelly, because the transverse wave cannot move due to lack of solidity in the fluids and gases
 iske atirikt prakaash kii kisi bhi prakaar kaa anudairdhya tarangon kaa hamen pataa nahin laga he
 Hence, the velocity of such waves is probably infinite, that is, according to the equation, k = of ether is infinite and ether is incompressible
 phir bhi is thos or asampidya padaarth ke dwaara grahon ke veg par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Calvin solved this difficulty by finding that both the ethereal p and the strongly n are extremely low, but their ratio is such that according to the equation the wave velocity is 3 x 108 m
 Per second
 vibhinn paardarshak padaartho main prakaash ke vibhinn vegon ke vishay main nimnlikhit teen siddhant banaae gaye the : Frennel's Theory: The substitution of ether in all liquids is equal to K, but its density p is different
 maikula kaa siddhant : sab dravyon main ether kaa ghanatv baraabar rahata he, kintu pratyasthata main fark hota he
 Calivan's theory: The velocity of the longitudinal wave was assumed to be 0 in the space of infinity
 falat: sameekaran k + 4 / 3n = 0, arthath k = - 4 / 3n
 iskaa arth yah he ki ether kaa k rinatmak he
 It is not incompressible, but is contractile
 uskaa aaytan kam karne ke liye usapar dabaav badhanaa nahin padataa varan ghatana padataa he
 But not one of these three principles met the test of observation

 nagvanshi We have seen that Sudas was associated with the Bharata caste, which in the long run, he was called a caste! The name of both Divodas and his son Sudas has a "slave" at the end indicating that they belonged to the Das or Nag dynasty! For each Nago, the slave name became the name of their species! The description of Naga dynasty is full of Vedas and Puranas! There is a long history of how the word Shiva became associated with the Nago! People of the Bharata dynasty used to worship Shiva, because of wearing the Shiva lingam, they started to be called Nag, Bharasiva! The people of the same Bharashiv dynasty were trained all over the name! While explaining the meaning of the word Bharsiva, Dr
 Kashiprasad Jaiswal says that the Vindhyachal region has good evidence of proving Bharhut, Bharadewal, Nagod and Nagdeya Bharo to be Bharashiv! Mirzapur, Allahabad and its adjoining areas have been the states of Bharo! In this way the entire Sanskrit name is Bharasiva! This era is called Kushan-yuga! When there were rulers of Rae Bareli, they were ambitious to establish the kingdom
 Bharshiva was not a caste name but his title! Bharshiva was a symbol of unity of Vindashakti! Starting from the first half of the third century, there was a kingdom of Nagvanshis over North India and Central India
 Initially, the Naga dynasty was here in Mathura and Gwalior, but gradually it gradually expanded to Vidarbha, Bundelkhand
 It is believed that all the people were mainly talking in two groups! One is Shivbhar and the other is Rajbhar
 The work of Shibbharo was not separate from Rajasata whereas the work of Rajbhar was to establish governance by running the rule! Choose Rajbhar Pravarsen as their leader! After eating the smell of holy water of Ganga, both of them united and later called "bharashib"! Desperate ruins, mounds and temple stupas of Bharshibo, his worker's past is still alive! The worship of shiva-parvati is a strong example of his temple! The word Kalgana, which originated from the Bharshiva Naga dynasty, is represented from the third or fourth century! Bhavnag is considered to be the strongest ruler of the Bharshiva dynasty! The word Bhar is made up of the Bharata caste! Saying this sentence in such a way that the whole word is made from Bharashiva Nago! There is no historical difference! Dr
 Kashi Prasad Jaiswal has added a period of 115 AD in Indian history called the Bharshiva period and in this way a new chapter has been added in history! kolar bhartiya rajya karnataka kaa ek jila he

 The modern Gujarat state is named after the Gurjar caste
 gujarat shabd kii utpatti gurjaratra shabd se hui hai jiskaa arth hai- vah joki gurjaron ke niyantran main hai
 Before Gujarat, this region was known as Lat, Saurashtra and Kathiawad
 bharuch ke gurjaron kaa kalkram nimnavat hai The Gurjara caste first established a state in the southern part of modern Gujarat at the end of the sixth century
 hen sang ne is rajya kaa naam bharuch bataaya hai
 Regarding the Gurjars of Bhadoch, we get from nine erstwhile copper plates obtained from southern Gujarat
 in tamrapatro main unhone khud ko gurjar nripati vansh kaa hona bataaya hai
 The center of this state was the modern Bhadoch district, situated between the Narmada and the Mahi River, although during its height the state extended to the Kheda district in the north and the Tapti River in the south
 gauri shankar ojha ke anusaar is rajya main bharuch jila, surat jile ke orpad ‘chorasi’ or bardoli talukke, aas-paas ke badoda ke ilaake, reva kantha or sachin ke ilaake hone chahie| is rajya kii rajdhani nandipuri thi| bharuch kii purvi darvaaze ke do mile uttar main nandipuri naamak kila hai, jisaki pahchaan da
 buhalar ne tamrapatro main ankit nandipuri ke rup main kii hai
 Some historians consider Nador to be Nandipuri, located in the Kathe of the Narmada, 36 miles from Bhadoch
 us samay bharat ke pashchimi tat par bharuch sabase pramukh bandargah or vyapaarik kendra tha
 Trade from Arab and European states was done from the port of Bhadoche
 yah pataa nahin chal paaya hai ki bharuch ke gurjar kis gotra ke the
 Probably at the beginning, they were feudatories of the Gurjara kings of Bhinmal
 yah bhi sambhav hai ki ve bhinmaal ke chap vansheey gurjaron kii shakha ho
 Like the Gurjars of Bhinmal, the Gurjars of Bhadoch were also worshipers of Surya
 bharat main hun samrajya ke patan ke turant baad aadhunik rajasthan main ek gurjar rajya ke astitv main hone ke pramaan milte hai
 , Bhinmal was the capital of this Gujjar state
 In the then texts, Rajasthan has been called Gurjar Desh at that time
 hen sang ne bhi apane granth “si you kii” main gurjar “kyuu-chi-lo” rajya ko pashchimi bharat kaa doosraa sabase bada rajya bataaya hai
 According to the book Brahmasphutta Siddhanta, the book of Brahmagupta, the eminent mathematician of ancient India, in 628 AD, a king named Sri Chap dynasty named Vyaghramukh was ruling at Bhinmal
 gurjar desh se dakshin-purv main bharuch kii taraf gurjaron ke vistaar kaa ek kaaran sabhawatah videshi vyapaar maarg par kabza karnaa tha| Later, the Gujjars of Bhadoch probably fell under the Maitraka dynasty of Vallabhi
 Historians like Lord Ji Lal Indra etc
 have also considered the Maitraka dynasty as the hun-gurjar group
 bhagwaan ji laal indra ke anusaar bhinmaal se gurjar malwa hote hue bharuch aaye vah ek shakha ko chhodte hue gujarat pahunche zahaan unhone maitra vansh ke netritv main vallabhi rajya kii sthapana kii
 'maitrak' is an Indian adaptation of the Iranian-origin word mihr / 'mihir', which means - Surya
 The word Mihir is closely related to the history of the hun-gurjar group
 hun ‘varah’ or ‘mihir’ ke upaask the
 'mihir' is also another name for Hunas
 ‘mihir’ hun or gurjaron kii oopaadhi bhi hai
 Both the Hun emperor 'gul' and the Gurjar emperor 'bhoja' had the title 'mihir' and are known as Mihir Gul and Mihir Bhoja
 mihir ajmer ke gurjaron kii aaj bhi ek oopaadhi hai
 There is strong evidence that Bhadoch's Gurjars and Vallabhi's Maitrako had integral connections
 vallabhi ke maitrako ne bharuch ke gurjaron or bet-dwarka, div, patan-somnath aadi ke chawdo kii sahayata se samundari videshi vyapaar par niyantran sthapit kiya| After the Maitrako of Vallabhi, the Gurjars of Bhadoch were also feudatories of the Chalukyas of Vatapi
 bharuch ke gurjar vansh kaa sabase pratapi raja dadda II tha
 The copper letters issued by him reveal that he was a worshiper of Surya
 uske ek tamrapatr se yah bhi gyaat hota hai ki usne uttar bharat ke swami harshavardhan dwaara parajeet vallabhi ke raja kii raksha kii thi| vaatapi ke tatkaaleen chalukya shaasha pulkeshi II ne bhi ehole abhilekh main harshavardhan ko narmada ke kachaaro main parajeet karne kaa daawa kiya hai
 V
A
 Smith considers the Chalukyo of Vatapi to be Gurjars
 hornale ne inhen hun mul kaa gurjar bataaya hai
 Hence it seems that Harshavardhana's war was fought by a confederation of three dynasties of the hun-gurjar group, in which he was successful in the Vallabhi region, but in the battle fought on the banks of the Narmada, he was defeated by Dadda II and Pulakeshi II
 done
 dadda II ke baad is vansh ke shaasha brahman samskruti ke prabhaav main aa gaye| jis kaaran se apni kabeelai pahchaan gurjar ke sthaan par kshatriya varna kii pahchaan par jor dene lage tathaa surya puja ke sthaan par ab unhone shaiva dharm ko apana liya
 Dadda III was the first Shaiva of this family
 dadda III ne manu smriti kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa apane rajya main varnashram dharm ko kadai se lagu kiya
 a copperplate issued by Jai Bhat III, the last ruler of this dynasty, is derived from Navsari, according to which he has described the famous Karna of India as his primal ancestor
 sambhawatah mul rup se surya ‘mihir’ ke upaask gurjar bhartiya samaaj main apana rutaba badhaane ke liye mithkeey nayak surya-putr karn se apane ko jodne lage| After 734 AD, we do not know anything about the Gurjars of Bhadoch
 is vansh ke shashan kaa ant kaa kaaran arab akraman yaa phir dakshin main rashtrakuto kaa udai hai
 The inclusion of the Gurjara element in the population of modern Gujarat cannot be ruled out during the rule of the Gurjars of Bhadoche
 kintu abhi tak aadhunik gujarat ke kisi bhi hisse kaa naam gujarat nahin padaa tha| December 22 is the 356th day of the year according to the Gregory calendar

 yah hindu dharm ke chah vedangon main se ek he - iskaa arth: vyakhya, vyutpatti sambandhi vyakhya
 It mainly discusses the old etymology of the words in the Vedas

 Along with this, there is also a compilation of difficult and less used Vedic words
 paramparaagat rup se sanskrit ke pracheen vaiyaakaran yask ko iskaa janak mana jaataa he

 itane pracheen kaal main shabdashastra par aisa gudh vichaar or kahin nahin dekha jaataa
 There were many views on the terminology, it is known from Yasuk's Nirukta
 kuch logon kaa mat tha ki sabhi shabd dhatumulak hai or dhaatu kriyaapad maatr hai jinamein pratyay aadi lagaakar bhinn shabd banate hain
 Opponents of this opinion said that some words are formed from metallic verbs, but not all, because if 'ash' is considered as Ash, then every moving or moving substance will be called Ashwa
 yask ne isi virdohi mat kaa khandan kiya he
 Yask Muni has said in reply that when a substance gets its name from a verb, then the person who performs the same action and the substance is not given that name
 duusare paksh kaa ek or virodh yah tha ki yadi naam isi prakaar die gaye he to kisi padaarth main jitne-jitne gun hon utane hi uskaa naam bhi hone chahie

 Nirukta describes the origin of words, that is, due to which feeling the horse is called horse
