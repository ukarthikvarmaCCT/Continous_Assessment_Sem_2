 The First anglo-burmese War was the first of the three wars between the British rulers and the Burmese Empire in the 19th century

 The Burmese were also forced to pay the compensation amount of 1 million pounds sterling and sign a trade treaty
 yah sabase lambaa tathaa british bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase mahangaa yuddh tha
 15 thousand European and Indian soldiers were killed in this war, with the number of casualties of the Burmese army and civilians unknown
 is abhiyaan kii laagat british shaskaon ko 5 million pound sterling se 13 million pound sterling tak padi thi,, jiske falswaroop 1833 main brirish bharat ko gambhir aarthik sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 For Burma it was the beginning of the end of its independence
 teesraa burmi samrajya, jisase ek sankshipt kshan ke liye british bharat bhayakrant tha, aapng ho chukaa tha or ab vah british bharat ke purvi seemaant pradesh ke liye kisi bhi prakaar se khatra nahin tha
 By paying a compensation amount of one million pounds, which was also a huge amount for Europe at that time, the Burmese would automatically be financially destroyed for many years to come
 The British rulers waged two more wars against the much weakened Burma and by 1885 took over the entire country
 duhsadhay pradesh hone ke kaaran is kshetra main abhiyaan kaa prachaar varsh ke shuru or ant ke kuch maheenon tak hi simit tha, visheshtah garmiyon main barsaat ke mausam ke dauraan
 Towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century the Burmese began to adopt an expansionist policy towards their neighbors, which eventually led to their conflict with British India
 1784 main burma ne arakaan par akraman karke usapar jeet hasil kar lee, jiske falswaroop burma kii seemaa british bharat kii seemaa tak aa pahunchi
 burmi logo dwaara kiya gaya arakan kaa vidhwans or iske dwaara apane desh main pariyojnaon ke liye arakaan se dasrupi shramikon kii maang ke kaaran isaki seemaa ke bhartiya chor par badi sankhya main vidrohiyon or sharnaarthiyon tathaa nirvasiton ke samudaayon kaa janm hua
 For example, in 1798 the local leader Naga Than Day and 10,000 Arakanese left their homes as a group and fled impatiently to India
 sharnaarthiyon ke kaaran, jise burma apni sampatti manaata tha or vidrohi samajhataa tha, burmi kingdom ne seemaa par bhartiya kshetra main chapa maarna shuru kar diya
 Starting in 1817, in northeastern India, the Burmese invaded Assam
 1822 tak, burmi sena purna prabhaav ke saath assam par niyantran kar chuki thi or sharnaarthiyon va vidrohiyon kii vahi samasya jo arakaan ke saath hui thi, ab punah assam ke saath ho rahi thi
 In 1819 the Burmese launched an expedition of demolition in Manipur, with the rulers of Manipur pretending not to attend the coronation of their king Bagyidau
 desh ko vyapak str par lutaa gaya or yahaan ke logon ko das shramikon ke rup main burma le jaaya gaya
 The invasion of Manipur later manifested as an attack on the nearby neighboring state of Cachar, whose ruler fled to the British province to seek assistance
 1823 main burma ne anya seemaant rajyon ko bhi dhamkee di
 British rulers had been trying to negotiate peace or stability agreements with Burma in their eastern frontiers for the last 30 years
 bharat ke governor general, sar jon shore ne 1795 main captain micel cemes ko ek lakshya ke saath amarpura bheja, is samay raja bodavpaya amarpura par shashan kar rahe the, jo konbong rajvansh ke sansthaapak, alongpaaya ke putr the, alongpaaya ne hi tisare burmi samrajya kii pratishtha kii thi
 By the autumn of 1823, the Governor General of Bengal, Lord Amherst, had issues with the East India Company's right of suzerainty over the island of Shaupri along the Arakan route
 burma ne akraman karke ise punah adhikaar main le liya, kyonki vah ise raja awa ke adhipaty main aane vaala burmi praant samajhate the
 On 23 September 1823, an armed force from Burma attacked the British rulers at Shaupri, an island on the side of Chittagong, during which they wounded and killed 6 guards
 do burmi senaayen, ek manipur se or ek assam se, kachaar ke andar bhi pravesh kar gayi, jo ab janvari 1824 se british shaskaon kii suraksha main tha
 The Burmese were repeatedly targeting and threatening Kachar
 iskaa vishesh mahatv yahi tha ki yah us pramukh praant ko niyantrit karata tha, jise bengal par akraman ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa tha
 a formal declaration of war against Burma was made on 5 March 1824
 17 may ko, burma kii sena ne chatgaanv par akraman kar diya or police tathaa sipoy kii ek mishrit tukdi ko raamu sthit apni niyukti se bhaga kar le gaye, lekin isaki safalataa ko aage barqaraar nahin rakh sake
 However, the British ruler of India had decided to carry this war to the enemy's country; An army led by Commodore Charles Grant and major-general Sir Archibald Campbell entered the Rangoon River and on 10 May 1824 also anchored at a location away from the city of Rangoon
 shuruuaati pratirodh ke baad rangoon ne samarpan kar diya or sainya dalon ko utaar liya gaya
 The place was completely evacuated by the residents there and food supplies etc
 were either transported to safe places outside the city by the Burmese army
 28 may ko, campbell ne kuch nikatavarti chaukiyon par hamale ke aadesh de die or antat vah sabhi goli daagne vaali pravar shakti dwaara adhikrut kar liye gaye
 On 10 June, another attack was made on the far-flung captive camps in the village of Chemmendine
 inamen se kuch to nadi ke yuddh poton se praapt topakhane dwaara nasht kar die gaye or antat bandook kii goliyon or top ke golon ke falswaroop burmi sena peeche hat gayi
 It soon became clear that this campaign was started with very inadequate knowledge and adequate management in relation to the country
 aatmadaman karrwai, joki burmi logon kii rakshaatmak pranali kaa ek hissaa tha, kathor dridhtaa ke saath kii jane lagi or isse sheeghra hi akramanakariyon ko atyant kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 sainikon kaa swasthya girane laga or unka kram bhi gambhir rup se girane laga
 The king of Ava sent new troops and goods to his army at the front to assist, and in early June an invasion of the British border was made, but it proved unsuccessful
 8 june ko british shaskaon ne nayaa akraman shuru kar diya
 As a result, the Burmese were recalled, and the fortified fortress ravaged by their cannons was gradually abandoned
 agast kii samaapti tak tharravaddi ke rajkumaar dwaara kiye gaye ek akraman ko chhodkar, burmi logon ne july or agast maheenon ke bich british shaskaon or sainikon ke saath koi chhedchhad nahin kii
 This interval was planned by Campbell to pacify the Burmese in Tawoy and the entire coastal region of Mergui and Tenasserim
 yah ek mahatvapurn vijay thi, kyonki desh rugnataa se ubar rahaa tha or bimaaron ko swasthya-laabh centre pahunchaa rahaa tha, bimaaron kii sankhya ab british sena main itani adhik ho chuki thi ki mushkil se lagbhag 3,000 sainik yuddh ke liye yogya rah gaye the
 Around this time, an army was sent against the ancient Portuguese fort and the cerium factory at the mouth of the Pegu River, which was captured; In October, the province of Martaban was defeated under the British rulers
 oktober ke ant tak varsha kaa mausam samaapt ho gaya or apni senaaon kii vyakulata se saavdhaan hokar awa ke nyaayalay ne un sevanivrutt sanakon ke dal ko waapas bula liya, jo arakaan main prasiddh netaa maha bandula ke netritv main niyukt kiye gaye the
 By the end of November, an army of 30,000 troops besieged the British troops at Rangoon and Kemmindine as a result of a mandatory march to protect their country, in which Campbell had only 5,000 qualified troops to defend
 vishaal sena ke saath burmi logon ne kemmendeine par bina kisi safalataa ke baar-baar akraman kiya or 7 disambar 1824 ko bandula campbell dwaara kiye gaye ek javaabi hamale main haar gaya
 The fugitives hid in a safe area near the river, where it was encroached again; Here too, he was attacked by the British army on 15 December and fled from the field completely confused
 campbell ab prom tak badhane kaa nirnay le chukaa tha; jo irravaddi nadi se lagbhag 100 mile oonchai par sthit tha
 He advanced on 13 February 1825 with his army in two parts, one army rising from the ground and the other starting from the flotilla under the leadership of General Willoughby Cotton, this army was sent for the purpose of conquering Danubu
 bhoomarg se bad rahi sena kii kaman sambhalate hue vah 11 march tak aage badhata rahaa, tabhi use yah bodh hua ki danubu par uske dwaara kiya gaya hamalaa vifal ho jaayegaa
 phir vah peeche hat gaya or 27 march ko coton kii sena ke saath sammilit ho gaya, vah 2 april ko bina kisi pratirodh ke danubu main atikaraman karke ghus gaya, ab tak bandula ek bam ke dwaara maaraa ja chukaa tha
 The British general entered prom on 25 April 1825 and stayed there until the rainy season
 17 sitambar 1825 ko ek maah ke yudhviram kaa nirnay liya gaya
 During the summer, General Joseph Wanton Morrison conquered the Arakan province; On the north side, the Burmese were expelled from Assam; And the British army had some success in the Cachar region, although their progress was further hampered due to dense forests
 3 navambar 1825 ko yudhviram kii samay seemaa samaapt ho gayi or lagbhag 9,000 sainikon ke saath awa kii sena teen bhaagon main prom sthit british sena kii or bad nikali, jise 3,000 europea or 2,000 sthaneey sainikon ne haraa diya
 However, even after several actions in which the Burmese were invaders and partially successful, the British were still victorious; On 1 December, Campbell attacked his army troops and successfully drove them out of all their bases, leaving them scattered in all directions
 irravaddi ke maarg par par sthit barmiyon ne malun main aakar sharan lee, jahaan unhone 10,000 yaa 12,000 sainikon ke saath sakhti se surakshit oonchi imaaraton or ek durjey bandi shivi par kabza kar liya
 On 26 December, he sent a flag for a ceasefire in the British camp
 The negotiations started, he was offered peace on the following terms: is sandhi par aupchaarik sahmati ho gayi thi or british shaskaon dwaara niyukt adhikariyon dwaara is par hastakshar kar die gaye
 However, ratification was not received from the king and it was suspected that the Burmese probably did not intend to sign it, but were preparing to continue the war
 tadnusaar, campbell ne 19 janvari 1826 ko malun main burmi sena par hamalaa kar diya
 Here again peace was offered by some Burmese people, but it was considered deceit and the remaining Burmese army took the final step in the security of the capital in the ancient city of Bagan
 He was attacked and defeated on 9 February
 jab akramanakari sena bas itani duuri par rah gayi ki vah paidal chalate hue 4 dinon main awa tak pahunch sakati thi, tab vahaan ke raja ne is sandhi ko sweekaar karne kaa nirnay le liya
 Dr
 Price, an American missionary who was jailed along with other Europeans at the start of the war, was sent to the British camp with a ratified treaty, freed prisoner and an installment of 2
5 million rupees has been provided
 is prakaar yuddh samaapti par pahunch gaya or british sena dakshin kii ore bad gayi
 The British Army remained in the same provinces where the Burmese surrendered in areas such as Rangoon, which had been authorized as guarantees for several years under the Treaty of Economic Conditions

 Other examples with its chemical names are polyethylene, teflan, poly vinyl chloride, the major polymers
 kritrim yaa synthetic polimar maanav nirmit hote hai
 These can be produced in factories
 plastic, pipon, botalon, baltiyon aadi ke nirmaan main prayukt hone vaali polithin synthetic polimar he
 Synthetic polymer is also a plastic cover mounted on electrical cables, cables
 fibre, sitacovar, majboot pipe evam botalon ke nirmaan main prayukt hone vaali propylain bhi synthetic polimar he
 Valve seals, filter cloths, gas kits etc
 are made from Teflon

 According to Holland scientists, a fluid called a dope in the spider forms a protein-rich polymer as soon as it comes out of its body
 polimar shabd kaa pratham prayog jones berjeeliyas ne 1833 main kiya tha
 In 1907 Leo Backland created the first synthetic polymer, by the process of phenol and formaldehyde
 unhone ise bakelite naam diya
 In 1922 Hermann Stoddinger was awarded the Nobel Prize for formulating the new theory of polymer
 isse pehle yah mana jaataa tha ki ye chote anuon kaa cluster he, jinhen colides kehete the, jiskaa anvik bhaar gyaat nahin tha
 But this theory states that polymers are bound by covalent bonds in a chain
 polimar shabd poli or meros se milakar bana he
 Polymers formed from monomer units of the same type are called homopolymers
 jaise polistyrine kaa ekmaatr monomer styrine hi he
 Polymers formed from different types of monomer units are called copolymers
 jaise ithyle-vinil-acitate bhinn prakaar ke monomaron se banataa he
 On the basis of physical and chemical properties, they can be divided into two classes: bahulak padaarthon ke namakaran kii kai paddatiyaan hai
 Polymers used in many common usage items are called by their common nicknames
 ye naam kisi vyakti yaa aitihaasik ghatana vishesh par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, bajaay koi maanak tareeke ke
 The American Chemical Society and IUPAC have described their naming methods, which are very similar, but not identical
 bhinn namakaran paddatiyon ke bich antar ko neeche dikhaaya gaya he: In both standardized methods, attempts have been made to denote the names of monomers forming them in polymer names, rather than repeating sub-unit names
 udhaahrantah saadhaaran alkin, ithin se banane vaale bahulak ko polithine yaa poli-ithaylin kehete hai, jabaki iske dwibandh swaroop naam ke in ansh kaa astitv khatm ho chukaa he, yani dwibandh hat chukaa he
 Picture: Ethene polymerization hindi
png polimar ke adhyayan ko bahulak vigyaan yaa polimar takanic kehete hai
 Its courses are available in many colleges and universities
 bahut se bahulak biodegradable nahin hote, jaise polithine
 That is why its use is becoming prohibited
 iske liye bahut se vikalp khoje ja rahe hai
 As such corn corn polymer has also been extracted
 yah purnataya biodigradable hoga jiske kaaran isse banane vaala polithine jameen main gaad die jane ke sirf das din main compost main badal jaataa he or kooday ke dher main rahane par bhi yah polithine 90 din kii avadhi main compost ban jaataa he
 Also, there is no big difference in the price of corn polymer from the price of polyethylene
 nakli noton kii samasya se nipatane ke liye pehali baar polimar note australia main pesh kiye gaye the
 Apart from Australia, polymer notes are also in circulation in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Bermuda, Brunei and Vietnam

 Such notes will not melt in water, nor is there a fear of turning and breaking
 carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa paramparaagat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly, polymers can also be used in various experiments

 Some modern contact lenses use pressure to reshape the cornea
 yah prakriya tab tak chalati he, jab tak aspashtataa nahin jaati
 The cornea is like a camera lens so that the light falls on the retina, after which the image is formed, which is transmitted to the appropriate part of the brain in the form of visual-arterial electrical signal
 cornea kharaab hone par retina par chitra nahin banataa or vyakti andhaa ho jaataa he
 Many times corneas also worsen due to eye infections, injuries or vitamin a deficiency

 The operation of the cornea was first developed in Italy
 iske baad use america main bhi apanaaya gaya or baad main vishwa bhar main apanaaya gaya he
 In this operation, one tooth of the patient and some bone near it was cut out and a hole was made to place the cylindrical lens in it
 lens sahit daant ko pehle rogi ke gaalon yaa kandhon kii twachaa ke neeche do maheenon ke liye pratiropit kiya jaataa he, taaki ve acchhee tarah aapas main jud jaaen
 Later they are removed and transplanted into the eye
 iske liye aankh vaale gadde ko pehle acchhee tarah taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 a hole is made in the mucous layer of the eye, so that the lens remains slightly out and can absorb the surrounding light
 haal ke varshon main ek nayaa vikalp intrastromal corneal ring ko plastic se vishisht rup se is tarah banaaya jaataa he ki ye cornea ke andar baithaaya ja sake
 Their designs are made in such a way that they return the lost shape to the cornea again and improve vision

 Raju is a gullible spear orphan who fills his stomach by singing songs
 ek din use zakhmi haalat main ek daakuon ke giroh kaa sardaar miltaa he jisaki jaan raju bachaa letaa he
 That gang of bandits then arrives and Raka Raju, the right-hand man of the Sardar, considers him a policeman and along with the Sardar, orders him to take him along with him to his base
 hosh aane par sardaar raaka ko bataata he ki raju ne hi uski jaan bachaai thi
 Raju falls in love with Sardar's girl Kammo but Rama is also eyeing Kammo
 kammo raju ko samajhaati he ki darasal wo log achche hai kyonki amir log garibon ko lootakar apni tijoriyaan bharte hai or wo log amiron ko lut kar garibon main paisa waapas kar dete hai
 Bhole Raju likes this and he stays with the gang
 ek din vah giroh kisi gaanv ke sahuukaar kii ladki kii shaadi main dhaava bol detaa he or lut paat ke saath saath raaka nav vivaahit dampati ko bhi maar detaa he
 This thing has a deep impact on Raju and he goes to the police superintendent and tells that the robber is now going to rob the Rajgarh village
 jab police suparintendent usase kahata he ki vah raaka or uske saare saathiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar degaa to bholaa raju samajhataa he ki police bhi utani hi zaalim he jitne ye daaku
 He escapes and intercepts the gang of dacoits going to Rajgarh and informs them about the police arrangements

 But he falls prey to police bullets

 Raju confesses in front of everyone that he had informed the police about the robber's plan to rob the Rajgarh and asks Raka why he did not send himself to anyone else to take stock
 raaka use martha he to vah daakuon ke adde ko chhodane kaa faisalaa kar letaa he lekin kammo ke aagrah par nahin jaataa he
 Raka and Sardar also arrive there and Kammo tells them that she has accepted Raju as her husband by eating the scent of power
 raaka agbabula ho jaataa he or sardaar se raju ko goli maarane ko kahata he
 When the Sardar turns his back on this, he shoots the Sardar himself and tries to forcefully marry Kammo and make up his mind to offer Raju's sacrifice on the wedding day
 kammo raaka se batch kar bhauji, jo ki ek robdar daaku kii patni he, ke paas jaati he jo use or raju ko bhaag nikalne main madad karti he
 The two flee to the police superintendent and the police superintendent kamo imprisons them to clean up the bandits
 raju waapas daakuon ke adde par aakar daakuon ke bivi bacchon se aagrah karata he ki ve daakuon se hathiyaar daalane kii zid karen
 The robber agrees to lay down arms for his wife's children
 akelaa pad gaya raaka bhi unke saath police ke paas jane ko nikal padataa he
 The robber leaves his base and goes towards the police and on the other hand Kammo comes under the pressure of the police to take the police towards the whereabouts of the bandits
 ek jagah donon dalon kaa takaraav hota he or raaka ke uksaane par daaku phir se hathiyaar uthaakar police se loha lene kaa man bana lete hai
 That is when Raju stands between the two parties with the bandits' wives and asks the bandits to lay down their arms again
 raaka samet is baar sabhi daaku apane hathiyaar daalkar apane or apane parivaar ko police ke supurd kar dete hai
 Raju requests the police superintendent that he should not be hanged
 police suparintendent sabko aashwaasan detaa he ki daakuon ko apane kiye kii sazaa to zarur milegi magar maut kii sazaa nahin

 The project life cycle revolves around all the activities of the project, while the system development life cycle focuses on meeting the product requirements
 system deveopment life saaikal kaary pranali kaa aisa prakaar he, jiskaa soochna system ko banane kii prakriya ko paribhaashit karne main prayog hota he, jivan chakra ke har str ko duharaakar soochna system ko ek bahut sankalpit, sanrachana or menthodical tareeke se viksit karne ke liye vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The traditional development systems life cycle began in the 1960s in the era of large-scale business groups to develop large-scale functional business systems
 soochna systams gatividhiyaan heavi data pracesing or nambar cranching routines ke aas-paas chakkar lagaati hai
 Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method was based in SDLC in the 1980s
 SSADM soochna systams ke vishleshan or dijin kaa ek system drushtikon, sarkari vanijyik karyaalay ke liye nirmit, ek UK sarkari karyaalay sarkaar main praudyogiki ke istemaal ke saath sambhddha hui
 Traditional life cycles entered into system development since the 1980s, increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks that attempted to break out of some of the inherent shortcomings of traditional SDLC
 system deveopment life saaikal mahatvapurn charnon kaa anusaran karti hai jo vikasakarta ke liye aavashyak he jaise ki yojana banane, vishleshan, dijin or karyanvayan or neeche ke bhaag main samajhaayaa gaya hai
 Many systems exist in the development life cycle
 sabase purana model, jise mulat: "da systams vikaas jivan chakra" mana jaataa tha waterfol model he, charnon kaa ek anukram jisamen har charan kaa nirgam agle charan ke liye aagat ho jaataa he
 These steps usually follow the same basic steps but many different waterfall operations give different names to the steps and there is a difference between 4 and 7 in the number of steps
 koi bhi system deveopment life saaikal model bilkul sahi nahin hota he lekin qadamon ko gunvatttashil or vibhinn charnon main baanta ja saktaa he
 To generate a high level of future project and to set the goal of the project
 kabhi-kabhi nidhi praapt karne ke prayaas main ucch prabandhan ko pariyojna pesh karne ke liye vyavhaaryata adhyayan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Projects are usually evaluated in three areas of feasibility: economic, work related and technology related
 In addition, it is also used in the context of putting the project on track and evaluating the progress of the MIS team
 MIS un charnon kaa poorak bhi he
 This phase is also called the analysis phase
 system vishleshan kaa uddeshy system ko fiks karne ke prayaas main samasya kahaan he ko tay karnaa he
 This step involves breaking the system into various parts and drawing diagrams for the analysis of the situation
 pariyojna kaa uddeshy kaa vishleshan vibhajit kaary jisko nirmaan karne ke zarurat he or upyogkarta ko shaamil rakhane kaa prayaas jisase ki nishchit aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kiya ja sake
 Necessary Gathering sometimes requires individual / team of customer as well as service providers to achieve detailed and correct requirements
 system dijin main kaaryon or parichaalanon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya jaataa he jisamen patal abhinyas, vyapaar ke niyam, prakriya aarekh or duusare dastauez-pralekhan shaamil hai
 The issuance of this step will describe the new system as a criterion or a subsystem
 dijin charan main aavashyaktaaon ko apane praarambhik aagat ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These requirements are identified in the accepted required document
 har zarurat ke liye, ek yaa zyada dijin avyavon kaa set saakshaatkaar, kaaryshaalaayein or / yaa adarsh prayaason ke parinaam main pesh kii jaayegi
 dijin avyav vaanchit software visheshtaon kaa vistaar se varnan karti he or saadharantah kaaryaatmak padanukram aarekh, patal abhinyas aarekh, vyavsaay niyamon kii sarini, vyapaar prakriya aarekh, siudocode or ek purna satta-sambadh purna data shabdkosh ke saath shaamil hai
 These design components are determined to describe the software with sufficient detail in which skilled programmers can perform software development with minimal additional investment
 modular or upsistems programing code is charan ke dauraan puri kii jaati he
 Unit tests and modulus tests are performed by developers in this level
 yah charan agle charan ke saath antarmishrit he jisamen mukhya pariyojna ke samakalan ke pehle vyaktigat modul ko pareekshan kii zarurat padegi
 Software testing involves testing code at different levels
 ikai, system or upyogkarta sweekruti pareekshanon ko kai baar kiya jaataa hai
 This is a gray area because many ideas exist in it that if an iteration occurs, what are the test steps and how much
 aamtaur par punrariti waterfol model kaa bhaag nahin he lekin kuch is charan main ghatit hote hai
 The spread of the system includes changes before the end of the system or the end of the system, and the release of service
 system kaa rakh-rakhaav SDLC kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he sanghathan main mukhya karmchaaree parivartan jagahon ke rup main naye parivartan karyanvit kii jaayegi; jisko system aadhuniki kaarnon kii zarurat hogi
 The system development life cycle phase serves as a programmatic guide to project activity and works with the project theme and provides a flexible yet favorable way to run projects by deep matching the project theme
 SDLC charan ke har ek uddeshy ko is vibhaag main mukhya pradeyon, diye gayi kaaryon kii vyakhya or prabhavi prabandhan ke liye sambadhit niyantrit uddeshyon ke saransh ke saath paribhaashit kiya gaya hai
 Creating and operating control objectives during every SDLC phase along with implementing projects is very critical for the project manager
 vaanchit yaa prastaavit parinaam kaa spasht kathan pradaan karne main niyantran uddeshy madad karti he or sampurna SDLC prakriya ke antagart prayog hona chahie
 Control objects can be grouped into core classes and as shown in the figure, it is associated with SDLC phases
 kisi bhi shuruuaati SDLC ke prabandhan or niyantran ke liye har pariyojna ko kuch degree work avrodh strecchar kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aavashyak kaaryon kii suchi or pakadaney kii zarurat hogi
 WBS and all programmatic content must be placed in the "project Descriptions" section of the project notebook
 WBS swaroop ko adhikanshtah pariyojna prabandhak ko saunp diya jaataa he jo ise is dhang se sthapit karata he ki pariyojna kaary kii sabase acchhee vyakhya ho jaati he
 There are some key areas that must be described in the WBS as part of the SDLC policy
 The following diagram describes the main areas that will be employed in WBS in the manner created by the project manager
 kaary avrodh sanrachana ke upree vibhaag ko mukhya charnon or pariyojna ke mile ke pathar ko sankshipt vyavhaar main pahchaanana chahie
 In addition, the Upper Department should provide an overview of the entire subject and the time frame of the project and the initial project description for project approval will be part of the effort
 WBS kaa madhya vibhaag WBS kaary vikaas ke guide ke rup main saat system deveopment life saaikal par aadhaarit hai
 The WBS element must be composed of miltons and must be "function" and a fixed duration as opposed to "activity"
 prayek kaary main ek ausat darje kaa nirgam jaruri ho 
 ek WBS kaary ek yaa adhik kriyakalapon par ashrith ho saktaa he or usko duusare kaaryon ke saath ghanisht sahyog kii zarurat pad sakati he chaahe vah aantarik yaa bahya pariyojna ho
 Any part of the project that needs support from the contractors must have a written statement of work to cover the above tasks from the SDLC stages
 SOW kaa vikaas SDLC ke kisi vishesh charan ke dauraan nahin hota lekin SDLC prakriya se kaary ko shaamil karne ke liye viksit hota he jo bahya sansadhano jaise thekedaaron dwaara yojit ho saktaa hai
 Baselines are an important part of the system development life cycle
 ye besalines SDLC ke chaar se paanch charnon ke baad nirmit hote hai or model ke punrariti prakruti ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 SDLC main har besalines ko ek milastone mana gaya he
 In the modern computing world, some people will use a strict waterfall model for their system development life cycle because many modern functionalities have removed this thinking
 kuch log tark dete hai ki SDLC ab azeil computing jaise model par lagu nahin hota lekin yah abhi bhi praudyogiki halkon main vyapak rup se istemaal hota he
 SDLC practice benefits from traditional models of software development that benefit themselves more in a structured environment
 SDLC karypranali kaa prayog nuksaandaayak us vakt he jab parivartaneey vikaas kii zarurat hoti he yaa jahaan pandhari ko niyamit rup se avlokan kii zarurat he ki software kaisaa dijin hua he
 Rather than looking at SDLC from the point of view of strengths or weaknesses, it is much more important to take the best practices from the SDLC model and apply it to whatever is above mentioned for the software designed
 SDLC kaa ek vaikalpik teevr anuprayog vikaas he, jo prototiping, sanyukt anuprayog vikaas or CASE tuls ke karyanvayan ko jodatii he
 The benefits of RAD are speed, low development costs and active user contribution to the development process
 isliye waterfol model sabase purana vaastavik SDLC model he isliye sabase prabhavi model he aisa sirf isliye nahin maananaa chahie
 At one time the model was mainly beneficial to the world of automated activities assigned to clerks and accountants
 jo kuch bhi ho, praudyogiki vikaas kii duniya maang kar rahi he ki system ke paas prabhavi kaaryakshmata he jo help desk taknishian / prashaasak yaa soochna praudyogiki visheshgyon / vishleshkon kii sahaayta karegaa

 It started to flourish here in the 18th century
 is vajah se yah dach kii ek 'beti-bhashaa' ke nazar se dekha ja saktaa he jisko pehle "kep kii dach" yaa "kichan dach" kaha jaataa tha
 The word is derived from the Dutch word "african-holland" which means "african Dutch"
 dakshin africa main basane vaale dach logon ke vaarison or dach logon ke ghulaam ke vaarison kii maatrubhaasha aam taur par africans he
 One of the reasons for the proliferation of African is also its public uplift that it is generally in newspapers, radio programs, TV
 It is used on Adi and from the first translations completed in 1933, considerable translations of the Bible have been published in this language

 Sirpur Lakshman Temple Geeta Tandon is an Indian stuntswoman, she became famous from season 5 of Khatron Ke Khiladi
 tandon ek punjabi parivaar main mumbai main paidaa hui thi
 She was born in a very harsh environment
 bahut hi kam umr main unhone apane mata-pita ko kho diya tha
 He was married at the age of 15 and gave birth to 2 children
 tandon ne apni metric kii shiksha puri kii por ek nartki ke rup main apana kariyar shuru kiya

 Piaget is a major figure in the field of developmental psychology
 anek paandityapurna avadharanaon ke liye ham piyaaje ke rini hai jinamein aaj bhi tike rahane kii kshamta or aakarshan he, jaise samaayojan / aatmsatkaran, anukulan vastu sthayitv, aatmakenndrikaran, sangrakshan, tathaa parikaalpanik-nigamit soch 
 We are also indebted to Piaget, along with William James and John Dui, for their current vision of being active, creative thinkers of children
 bacchon kaa nirikshan karne kii piyaaje main vilakshan pratibha thi
 Her careful observations showed us sensible ways of discovering how children interact and interact with their world
 piyaaje ne hamen sangyanatmak vikaas main kuch khaas chijen khojna sikhaaya, jaise purvasankriyaatmak soch se moort sankriyaatmak soch main hone vaala badlaav
 He also showed us how children need to make their plans relevant to their experiences, cognitive structures as well as their own plans
 piyaaje ne yah bhi dikhalaayaa ki yadi parivesh kii sanrachana aisi ho jisamen ek str se duusare str tak dhire-dhire badhane kii suvidha ho to, sangyanatmak vikaas hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 We are also indebted to him for the prevailing belief that concepts do not suddenly appear in their full form, but rather develop through a series of small partial achievements that result in a more complete understanding
 shiksha par piyaaje kaa bahut prabhaav padaa he, vishesh rup se praarambhik or madhya bachapan ke dauraan shiksha par
 The three principles derived from his epistemology still have a wide impact on the training of teachers and the methods adopted within the classroom
 piyaaje kaa anusaran karne vaali kaksha main bacchon ko parivesh ke saath swatah sfoort / sahaj rup se kriya karte hue chizon ko khud se khojane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Rather than literally presenting pre-prepared knowledge, teachers facilitate a variety of activities that encourage discovery - such as art, puzzles, table games, various costumes, things to make, books, measurements
 Tools, music, instruments and more
 piyaaje vaali kaksha vikaas kii gati ko badhaane kii koshish nahin karti
 Piaget believed that appropriate learning experiences of children develop from their immediate thinking
 shikshak bacchon ko dhyanpurvak dekhte hai, unki baaten sunate hai, or unhen aise anubhav sulabh karaate hai, jinamein ve nai khoji gai yojanaon kaa abhyaas kar saken or jo unke sansar ko dekhne ke galat tareekon ko chunauti de saken
 But teachers do not impose any new skills on children until they show interest in and preparation for them, because by doing this they accept the sources of adults in a superficial manner, but that does not lead to true understanding
 piyaaje kaa siddhant yah maanakar chalata he ki sabhi bachche vikaas ke samaan anukram se guzarate hai, lekin unki gati / raftaar alag-alag hoti he
 Therefore, teachers should plan activities for individual students and for small groups, not for the whole class simultaneously
 iske atirikt shikshak shaikshanik pragati kaa moolyankan karte samay har bachche kii tulana usee kii pichhali sthiti se karte hai
 They are less interested in how children perform relative to any standard levels or the average performance of children of the same age
 piyaaje kaa siddhanth chunautiyon se mukt nahin rah paaya
 Questions have been raised on these areas: bachche naitik muddon ke bare main kis tarah sochate hai; iske bare main pyaaje ne ruchi jaagrit kii thi
 He observes and interviews children between the ages of four and twelve years in greater depth
 piyaaje ne bacchon ko kanche khelte hue dekha taaki ve yah jaan saken ki bacchon ne khel ke niyam par kis tarah se vichaar kiya
 He also talked to children about moral issues
 piyaaje ne paaya ki jab bachche naitikta ke bare main sochate hai, to ve do alag-alag avasthaaon se hokar guzarate he
 Since young children are at the level of morality with external authority, they make the decision of right or wrong about one's behavior by looking at the consequences of that behavior, not based on the object of the behavior
 jaise ki unke ke liye jaanboojh kar tode gaye ek cap kii tulana main haadase main 12 cap tuutane kii ghatana zyada buree he
 As children begin to move to an independent state, the purpose / intention of the person doing some work starts to become a necessary point of their moral thinking
 bahari satta ke adhar par naitik chintan karne vaale bachche yah bhi maanate hai ki niyam na badalane vaali cheez he or yah niyam kisi shaktishaalee satta ke dwaara banaae gaye hai
 The onion suggested to the young children to make new rules for the game of marbles, then the younger children refused
 duusari taraf bade bacchon ne parivartan ko sweekaara or pahachaanaa ki niyam sirf hamaari suvidha ke liye banaae gaye hai, jinhen badla ja saktaa he
 Children who think ethically on the basis of external authority also believe in the notion of 'instant justice'
 yani ki agar ek niyam todaa jaataa he to sajaa bhi milani chahie
 Young children believe that if something is broken or broken, then this work automatically gets associated with punishment
 isiilie chote bachche jab bhi koi galat kaam karte hai tab chintaa se apane aasapaas dekhne lagate hai, yah sochakar ki unhen sajaa to milegi
 The principle of instant justice also says that if something unfortunate had happened to someone, that person must have done something earlier, which resulted in it
 bade bachche jo naitikta kii swatantrata rakhane lagate he, yah pahachaanate he ki sajaa tabhi milti he jab kisi ne kuch galat hote dekh liya ho or uske baad bhi jaruri nahin ki sajaa mili hi
 How do such changes bring about moral reasoning? Piaget believes that as children get older, their thinking about social issues gets deeper
 pyaaje kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik samaj saathiyon ke saath aapasi len-dein se aati he
 Those who have the same power and position, there is a compromise between the plans and arguments are made for not agreeing and finally everything goes well
 abhibhavak or bachche ke rishton main jahaan abhibhavak ke paas shakti hoti he lekin bacchon ke paas nahin, vahaan naitik tark kii samaj ko viksit karne kii sambhaavna kam rahati he kyonki adhiktar niyam aadeshaatmak tareeke se die jate hai
 The Super Mario Kart game is a racing video game and was first created by Nintendo in 1992 and launched inside the market
 yah super mario cart siries kaa sabase pehla game tha or isko sabase pehle japan or uttar america ke andar san 1992 ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Shortly thereafter, it was also released inside Europe

 vidyutdarshi kaa prayog vidyut aavesh ke sansuchan or maapan main hota he
 The electroscope is the oldest electrical device
 san 1787 ke pehle kai prakaar ke vidyutdarshi bane jo mukhyat: aaweshit pith gut kaa ke pratikarshan kaa upyog karte the
 It was only in 1787 that Abraham Bennett made a gold-sheet electroscope, which is used to this day
 ek atyant patala swarnpatr pital kii chapati chadi se lataka rahata he
 There is a round disc in the upper part of this brass rod
 yah swarnpatr vaala chad ek dhaatu ke baks main amber dwaara vidyut rodhi karke laga rahata he
 This box is attached to the earth and there is a window through which the gold sheet can be inspected
 yadi chakti ko kisi aaweshit vastu se chhu diya jaae to chad or swarnpatr donon hi aaweshit ho jate hai
 The gold sheet moves away from the rod due to mutual repulsion
 swarnpatr kaa vikshep awesh kii maatra kaa samaanupati hota he
 The gold sheet deflection can be measured on a scale
 vikshep ke vishuddh gyaan ke liye sookshmdarshi kaa prayog karte hai
 Some electrospheres have two gold letters on the underside of the brass rod
 aavesh tathaa vibhav nimnlikhit sutara se sambandhit hai - The amount of charge can be measured by the deflection of the gold sheet and the capacitance of the electrode is fixed
 at: vibhav kaa bhi maapan ho saktaa he
 Ordinary gold sheet electrodes have very little capacity; For this reason, it is sensitive to the potential
 uski sugrahikta badhaane ke liye keval ek patr or saath main ek sandharitra kaa bhi prayog karte hai
 Such electroscopes are called condenser electroscopes
 radio activata ke avishkaar ke baad yah pataa chalaa ki kuch vastuon se aisi kirane nikalati hai jo kisi aaweshit pindon ko niraveshit karti hai
 If a charged electrode is placed near a radioactivity element, it will start discharging and the gold sheet deflection will begin to decrease
 vikshep ghatane kii dar radioective kirnon kii shakti kii samaanupati hogi
 Due to this, the use of electroscopes has started to be very much and now many improved types of electroscopes have started being made

 The Constitution of the Republic of Independent India came into force on 26 January 1950
 iske kaaran aadhunik sansthagat dhaanche or uski anya sab shakha-prashakhaon sahit purna sansadeey pranali sthapit ho gai
 The Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India
 vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par pehle aam chunaavon ke baad nae samvidhan ke upbandhon ke anusaar sansad kaa gathan hone tak isi prakaar kaary karti rahi
 The first general elections under the new constitution were held in the year 1951–52
 pehali chuni hui sansad jiske do sadan the, rajyasabha or loksabhaa may, 1952 main bani; duusari lok sabha may 1957 main bani; teesri april 1962 main; chauthi march 1967 main; paanchavi maach 1971 main; 6 march 1977 main; saatvin janvari 1980 main; 8 janvari 1985 main; naveen disambar 1989 main, dasvin june 1991 or gyarahavin 1996 main bani
 The Rajya Sabha, formed for the first time in 1952, is a continuous, permanent house
 jiskaa kabhi vighatan nahin hota
 One-third of its members retire every two years
 bhartiya loktantr main sansad janata kii sarvocch pratinidhi sanstha he
 It is through this that the sovereignty of the common people gets expression
 sansad hi is baat kaa pramaan he ki hamaari raajnneetik vyavastha main janata sabase upar he, janamat sarvopari he
 The word 'parliamentary' itself means such a democratic political system where the supreme power is vested in that body of people's representatives, which is called 'parliament'
 bharat ke samvidhan ke adheen sangheey vidhanmandal ko ‘sansad’ kaha jaataa he
 It is the axis which is the foundation of the governance of the country
 bhartiya sansad raashtrapati or do sadanon—rajyasabha or loksabhaa—se milakar banati he
 Although the President of India is a part of the Parliament, yet he neither sits in either of the two houses nor participates in its discussions
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke donon sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 a Bill passed by both the Houses can become law only if the President gives his approval to it
 itnaa hi nahin, jab sansad ke donon sadanon kaa adhiveshan na chal rahaa ho or raashtrapati ko mahasoos ho ki in paristhitiyon main turant kaarywahi jaruri he to vah adhyadesh jari kar saktaa he
 The power and effect of this ordinance is the same as the law passed by Parliament
 loksabhaa ke liye prayek aam chunaav ke pashchaat adhiveshan ke shuru main or har saal ke pehle adhiveshan ke prarambh main raashtrapati ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke saamne abhibhaashan karata he
 He informs the Parliament of the reasons for calling the meeting of the Houses
 iske alaava vah sansad ke kisi ek sadan athwa ek saath donon ke samaksh abhibhaashan kar saktaa he
 For this he can expect the presence of members
 use sansad main us samay lambit kisi vidheyak ke sambandh main sandesh yaa koi anya sandesh kisi bhi sadan ko bhejne kaa adhikaar he
 The House to which a message has been sent in this way quickly considers the subject written in that message as convenient
 kuch prakaar ke vidheyak raashtrapati kii sifarish praapt karne ke baad hi pesh kiye ja sakate hai athwa un par aage koi kaarywahi kii ja sakati he
 As its name suggests, the Rajya Sabha is the Council of States
 yah apratyaksh reeti se logon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 The member of the Rajya Sabha is elected by the elected legislators of the state legislatures
 prayek rajya ke pratinidhiyon kii sankhya zyaadaatar uski jansankhya par nirbhar karti he
 Thus, Chhattisgarh has 5 members in Rajya Sabha, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members in Rajya Sabha
 manipur, mizoram, sikkim, tripura aadi chote rajyon ke keval ek ek sadsy hai
 The Rajya Sabha can have up to 250 members
 inamen raashtrapati dwaara manonith 12 sadsy tathaa 238 rajyon or sangh-rajya kshetron dwaara chune sadsy hote hai
 The Rajya Sabha currently has 245 members
 rajyasabha ke prayek sadsy kii karyavadhi chah varsh he
 The Vice President is elected by the members of both houses of Parliament
 vah rajyasabha kaa paden sabhapati hota he
 The members of the Rajya Sabha elect one of their own for the post of Deputy Chairman
 lok sabha ke sadasyon kaa chunaav janata dwaara sidhe vot daalkar kiya jaataa he
 Every Indian citizen of the age of 18 years and above will be entitled to vote
 lok sabha ke adhiktam 530 sadsy rajyon se chunaav kshetron kii pratyaksh reeti se chune jaaenge
 a maximum of 20 members will represent the Union Territories
 iske atirikt, raashtrapati angl-bhartiya samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye do se andhik sadsy manonith kar saktaa he
 Thus the maximum number of members of the House is 552, it is envisaged in the Constitution
 lok sabha main anusuchit jatiyon tathaa anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye jansankhya-anupaat ke aadhaar par sthaan arakshit he
 Initially this reservation was for ten years
 naveenatam sanshodhan ke antargat ab yah pachaas varsh ke liye arthath san 2000 tak ke liye hai
 The term of the house in India is five years
 paanch varshon kii avadhi samaapt ho jane par sadan khud bhang ho jaataa he
 In some circumstances, Parliament can be dissolved before the full term ends
 apatkaal kii sthati main sansad lok sabha kii karyavadhi badha sakati he
 It cannot exceed one year at a time
 sansad ke donon sadanon ko, kuch maamalon ko chhodkar sabhi kshetron main samaan shaktiyaan evam darja praapt he
 Before any non-financial bill is enacted, it is required to be passed by each of the two houses
 raashtrapati par mahabhiyog chalaane, uparashtrapati ko hataane, samvidhan main sanshodhan karne or ucchtam nyaayalay evam ucch nyaayalayon ke nyaayadhishon ko hataane jaise mahatvapurn maamalon main rajyasabha ko lok sabha ke samaan shaktiyaan praapt he
 It is mandatory to place the President's Ordinances, Proclamation of Emergency and Proclamation of the failure of the constitutional system in a State and the failure of the Constitutional system in a State before both the Houses of Parliament
 kisi dhan vidheyak or samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko chhodkar anya kisi bhi vidheyak par donon sadanon ke bich asahmati ko donon sadanon dwaara sanyukt baithak main dur kiya jaataa he
 Matters are decided by majority in this meeting
 donon sadanon kii aisi baithak kaa peethasin adhikari loksabhaa kaa adhyaksh hota he
 In India, both the Prime Minister and the Minister can be a member of either of the houses
 kisi aise vyakti ko bhi pradhanmantri yaa mantri niyukt kiya ja saktaa he jo sansad ke kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy na ho, parantu use chah maas ke pashchaat pad chhodana padataa he, yadi is bich, vah donon main se kisi sadan ke liye nirvaachit na ho jaae
 The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha
 ant: uske liye yah jaruri he ki lok sabha kaa vishwaas khote hi pad-tyaag kar den
 Parliamentary rule should mean rule by Parliament
 kintu sansad swayan shashan nahin karti or na hi kar sakati he
 In a way it can be said about the Council of Ministers that it is the great executive committee of Parliament
 jise mul nikaay kii ore se shashan karne kaa uttardaayitv saunpa jaataa he
 The function of Parliament is to legislate, advise, criticize and express the grievances of the people
 karypalika kaa kaary shashan karnaa he, yadhyapi vah sansad kii ore se hi shashan karti he
 In a large and heavily populated country like India, conducting elections is a huge task
 sansad ke donon sadanon- loksabhaa or rajyasabha- ke liye chunaav berokatoke or nishpaksh hon, iske liye ek swatantra chunaav ayog banaaya gaya he
 General elections to the Lok Sabha are held when the term is over or dissolved
 bharat kaa prayek naagarik jo 18 varsh kaa yaa usase adhik ho matdaan kaa adhikari he
 The minimum age for contesting Lok Sabha elections is 25 years and for Rajya Sabha 30 years
 rajyasabha ke sadsy rajyon ke logon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They are elected by the elected members of the state legislative assembly
 rajyasabha main sthaan bharne ke liye raashtrapati, chunaav ayog dwaara sujhai gai taarikh ko, adhisuchana jari karata he
 Such notification is not issued more than three months before the date on which the retiring members expire
 chunaav adhikari, chunaav ayog ke anumodan se matdaan kaa sthaan nirdhaarit or adhishuchet karata he
 For the election of the new Lok Sabha, the President, by notification published in the Gazette, asks all the parliamentary constituencies to elect members on the date suggested by the Election Commission
 adhisuchana jari kiye jane ke pashchaat chunaav ayog namakan patr daayar karne, unki chaanbin karne, unhen waapas lene or matdaan ke liye tithiyaan nirdhaarit karata he
 Due to direct election to the Lok Sabha, the territory of India is divided into suitable territorial constituencies
 prayek sansadeey nirvachan kshetra se ek sadsy ko chunaa jaataa he
 If a member of one House is also elected to the other House, then his / her position in the first House is vacated from the date when he / she is elected to the other House
 isi prakaar, yadi vah kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke sadsy ke rup main bhi chun liya jaataa he to, yadi vah rajya vidhanmandal main apane sthaan se, rajya ke rajptr main ghoshnaa ke prakaashan se 14 dinon ke bheetar, tyaagptr nahin de detaa to, sansad kaa sadsy nahin rahata
 If a member does not attend a meeting of the House for a period of 60 days without the permission of the House, then that House can declare its place vacant
 iske alaava, kisi sadsy ko sadan main apana sthaan rikt karnaa padataa he yadi If a member is disqualified on the basis of change in terms of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, his membership may be terminated
 sansad ke yaa kisi rajya vidhanmandal ke kisi sadan ke liye hue kisi chunaav ko chunauti ucch-nyaayalay main di ja sakati he
 The petition can be moved during the election due to adopting a corrupt process
 yadi siddh ho jaae to ucch nyaayalay ko yah shakti praapt he ki vah safal ummidavaar kaa chunaav shunya ghoshit kar de
 The affected party has the right to appeal against the order of the High Court to the Supreme Court
 lok sabha prayek aam chunaav ke baad chunaav ayog dwaara adhisuchana jari kiye jane par gathit hoti he
 The first sitting of the Lok Sabha begins with the oath method
 iske nav nirvaachit sadsy ‘bharat ke samvidhan ke prati shraddha or nishtha rakhane ke liye', 'bharat kii prabhutaa or akhandta akshunn rakhane ke liye’ or ‘sansad sadsy ke kartavyon kaa shraddhapurvak nirvahan karne ke liye’ shapath lete hai
 The President invites each House of Parliament from time to time for a meeting
 prayek adhiveshan kii antim tithi ke baad raashtrapati ko chah maas ke bheetar aagaamee adhiveshan ke liye sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karnaa hota he
 Although the power to invite the Houses to the meeting is vested in the President, in practice the initiative to propose to this effect is taken by the Government
 saamanytah prativarsh sansad ke teen satr yaa adhiveshan hote hai
 Such as budget session, monsoon session and winter session
 kintu, rajyasabha ke maamle main, bajet ke adhiveshan ko do adhiveshnon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 There are three to four weeks off between these two sessions
 is prakaar rajyasabha ke ek varsh main chaar adhiveshan hote hai
 Presidential address nav nirvaachit sadasyon kii shapath ke baad adhyaksh kaa chunaav hota he
 Thereafter, the President addresses both Houses of Parliament simultaneously in the Central Hall of Parliament House
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan bahut mahatvapurn avasar hota he
 The address contains details of such policies and programs that are proposed to be implemented in the coming year
 saath hi, pehle varsh kii uski gatividhiyon or safaltaaon kii samiksha bhi di jaati he
 That address since the details of the policy of the government are prepared by the inter-government
 abhibhaashan par charchaa bahut vyapak rup se hoti he
 Amendments to the motion of thanks may also discuss matters which are not specifically mentioned in the address
 lok sabha sadan ke do sadasyon ko adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh ke rup main chunati he
 There is some tradition that the vice president is elected from among the members of the opposition
 praayah yah koshish rahati he ki adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh tathaa rajyasabha main sabhapati or upasabhapati kaa yah kaam he ki ve apane sadan kii kaarywahi ko vyavasthit dhang se niyamon ke anusaar chalaaen
 Parliamentary work can be divided into two main heads
 sarkari kaary or gaiyr-sarkari kaary
 Government work can then be divided into two categories, gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke kaary, arthath vidheyakon or sankalpon par prayek shuukravaar ke din yaa kisi aise din jo adhyaksh nirdhaarit kare dhai ghante tak charchaa kii jaati he
 The time is generally recommended by the Business Advisory Committee for various works to be done in the House
 praaia: har saptaah ek baithak hoti he
 Printed copies of the proceedings of both the Houses of Parliament are usually made available within one month after the meeting
 kaarywahi ko tepe ricard kiya jaataa he
 Session-wise printed sections of the debate are available in Hindi and English
 sarkaar apni prayek bhul chook ke liye sansad ke prati or sansad ke dwaara logon ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he
 Members of the House exercise this right, inter alia, through parliamentary questions
 sansad sadasyon ko lok mahatv ke maamalon par sarkaar ke mantriyon se jaankaree praapt karne ke liye poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 Getting information is the parliamentary right of every non-official member
 sansad sadsy ke liye logon ke pratinidhi ke rup main yah aavashyak hota he ki use apni jimmedaariyon ke paalan ke liye sarkaar ke kriyakalapon ke bare main jaankaree ho
 The basic purpose of asking questions is to get information and know the facts on a matter of public importance
 donon sadanon main prayek baithak ke prarambh main ek ghante tak prashn kiye jate hai
 And their answers are given
 ise ‘prashnkaal’ kaha jaataa he
 In addition, ministers are also tested by asking investigative and supplementary questions to see how much they understand the functioning of their departments
 prashnkaal sansad kii kaarywahiyon kaa sabase adhik dilachasp ang he
 No other work for the newspapers for the people and for the members themselves generates as much interest as the question hour produces
 is kaal ke dauraan sadan kaa vaataavaran anishchit hota he
 Sometimes a whirlwind of tension arises, sometimes it starts saying
 kabhi kabhi kisi prashn par hone vaale katu tark-vitark se uttejnaa paidaa hoti he
 Such a situation is overcome by the reaction and humor of the members or ministers
 yahi kaaran he ki prashnkaal ke dauraan na keval sadan kaksh balki darshak evam press gailariyaan bhi sadaa lagbhag bhari rahati hai
 Some questions are given an oral answer
 inhen tarankit prashn kaha jaataa he
 Unstarred questions are given written answers
 yah baat nishchit rup se kahi ja sakati he ki sadsy prashn poochne ke adhikaar kaa prayog karne main baari ruchi dikhaate rahe hai
 Since the process of questions is relatively simple and easy
 at: yah sansadeey prakriya ke anya upayon kii tulana main sansad sadasyon main adhikadhik priy hoti ja rahi he
 In both the houses of Parliament, the time immediately after the Question Hour is commonly known as 'zero Hour' or Zero Hour
 yah ek se adhik arthon main shoonyakaal hota he
 The noon time at 12 o'clock is neither the pre-noon time nor the post-midday time
 ‘shoonyakaal’ 12 baje prarambh hone ke kaaran is naam se janaa jaataa he ise ‘aavar’ bhi kaha gaya kyonki pehle ‘shoonyakaal’ puure ghante tak chalata tha, arthath 1 baje din main sadan kaa din ke bhojan ke liye avkaash hone tak
 No one can say what matter arises during this period or what kind of attack should be made on the government
 niyamon main ‘shoonyakaal’ kaa kahin bhi koi ullekh nahin he
 At the end of the Question Hour, the members stand to raise such matters, which they feel that action cannot be delayed
 haalaanki is prakaar maamle uthaane ke liye niyamon main koi upbandh nahin he
 It seems that the idea behind this practice has been that such rules which are a hindrance for the members in raising matters of national importance or serious grievances of the people in the House immediately, are meaningless
 niyamon kii drushti se tathakthith ‘shoonyakaal’ ek aniyamitata he
 Since matters are taken up without permission or without prior notice, it wastes valuable time of the House
 isse sadan ke vidhaayi, vittiya or anya niyamit kaary kaa atikaraman hota he
 Now, on the basis of the information already given to some of the matters raised in the Zero Hour, with the permission of the Speaker, a list has also been started
 sansad ke donon sadanon ke niyamon main lok mahatv ke maamle bina deree ke or kai prakaar se uthaane kii vyavastha he
 The various processes available to each member are as follows: iske dwaara lok sabha ke niyamit kaam-kaaj ko rokkar tatkaal mahatvuparn maamle par charchaa karai ja sakati he
 Through this, any member can bring the attention of the government to the matter of immediate importance
 mantri ko us maamle main bayaan dena hota he
 Each member who calls attention has the right to ask a question
 inke dwaara tatkaal mahatv ke prashnon par ek ghante kii charchaa kii ja sakati he
 However, there is no voting on it
 hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhi kis tarah aise maamle uthaane kaa prayaas karte hai jinka niyamon evam viniyamon kii vyakhya se koi sambandh nahin hota
 But these cases are provoking him and the people of his constituency at that time
 jo maamle vyavastha ke prashn nahin hote yaa jo prashnon, alp-soochna prashnon, dhyanakarshan prastaavon aadi se sambandhit niyamon ke adheen nahin uthaae ja sakate, ve iske adheen uthaae jate hai
 The House makes a number of decisions on various matters of public importance and expresses its opinion
 koi bhi sadsy ek prastaav ke rup main koi suzav sadan ke samaksh rakh saktaa he
 In which his opinion or wish has been given
 yadi sadan use sweekaar kar letaa he to vah samooche sadan kii raay yaa ichha ban jaati he
 In the end, the 'proposal' is broadly brought before the House to know the decision of the House
 prastaav vastav main sansadeey kaarywahi kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Any matter of public importance can be the subject of a motion
 prastaav bhinn bhinn sadasyon dwaara bhinn bhinn prayojanon se pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 The proposals can be moved by ministers and also by non-government members
 gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara pesh kiye jane vaale prastaavon kaa uddeshy saamanytah kisi maamle par sarkaar kii raay yaa vichaar jaananaa hota he
 The resolution is also a procedural measure, it is available to members and ministers to raise a discussion in the House on a matter of common interest
 saamaanya rup ke prastaavon ke samaan sankalp, raay yaa sifarish kii ghoshnaa ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Or in any other form as the Speaker may deem appropriate
 mantriparishad tab tak padasin rahati he jab tak use lok sabha kaa vishwaas praapt ho
 The government has to resign constitutionally as soon as the Lok Sabha expresses distrust in the Council of Ministers
 niyamon main is aashay kaa ek prastaav pesh karne kaa upbandh he jise ‘avishvaas prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The Rajya Sabha does not have the power to consider a motion of no confidence
 ninda prastaav avishvaas ke prastaav se bhinn hota he
 The motion of no-confidence does not mention the reasons on which it is based
 parantu ninda prastaav main aise kaarnon yaa aaropon kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The proposal is intended to condemn the government for certain policies and actions
 ninda prastaav mantriparishad ke viruddh yaa kisi ek mantri ke viruddh yaa kuch mantriyon ke viruddh pesh kiya jaataa he
 It expresses regret, indignation or surprise by the House over the failure of any minister or ministers
 sarkaar ko shashan, suraksha or jan kalyaan ke bahut se kaam karne hote hai
 All this requires a lot of resources
 ye aaen kahan se? sarkaar janata se kar vasuulati he
 It also takes loans when needed
 kyonki ham sansadeey vyavastha main rahete hai, sarkaar ke liye yah jaruri he ki koi bhi kar lagane yaa koi bhi kharchaa karne se pehle vah sansad kii manjuuri le
 In order to get this approval, every year the government presents a budget i
e
 the full year income and expenditure accounts in Parliament
 rail bajet or saamaanya bajet alag alag pesh kiye jate hai
 The general budget is usually brought on the last working day of February
 rail bajet usase kuch din pehle aa jaataa he
 The financial year begins at the first April of each year at this time
 bajet main is aashay kaa prastaav hota he ki aane vaale saal ke dauraan kis mad par kitna dhan kharch kiya janaa he
 How much money will come from it or from where it will be raised
 bajet ke aagaamee varsh ke liye anudaan die jate hai
 The government gets an opportunity to explain and explain its financial and economic policies and programs
 saath hi, sansad ko un par vichaar karne or unki aalochana karne kaa bhi avasar miltaa he
 In the process of passing the budget, serious and full discussion takes place in both houses of Parliament
 yah bajet pesh kiye jane ke kuch din baad hoti he
 The discussion begins with a general debate
 yah sansad ke donon sadanon main teen yaa chaar din tak chalati he
 The practice is that at this stage the members consider only the general aspects of the government's fiscal and economic policies
 kar lagane tathaa kharch ke byore main nahin jate
 Thus, the General Debate gives each House an opportunity to express its views
 sarkaar ko bhi abhas ho jaataa he ki kisi prastaav vishesh ke prati baad kii avasthaaon main kya pratikriya hogi
 It is to be noted that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with the budget other than general discussion
 maangon par matdaan keval lok sabha main hota he
 The second stage is to discuss and vote on the demands for grants
 saamanytah prayek mantralay ke liye prastaavit anudaanon ke liye alag maange rakhi jaati hai
 These 'demands' are related to the expenditure part of the budget
 inkaa swaroop karypalika dwaara lok sabha ke liye kiye gaye nivedan kaa he ki maangi gai raashi ko kharch karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 Discussion on demands is interesting
 charchaa ke dauraan mantralay kii nitiyon or kriyakalapon kii baariki se chaanbin kii jaati he
 Members may do so by presenting supporting proposals for the original proposal for demands for grants
 in sahaayak prastaavon ko sansadeey bhashaa main ‘katautee prastaav’ kaha jaataa he
 The process of passing the budget, from the presentation of the budget, goes on to discuss it and accept the demands for grants and till the passing of appropriations and finance bills, usually after the commencement of the current financial year
 jab tak sansad, maangen sweekrut nahin kar leti tab tak ke liye yah aavashyak he ki desh kaa prashasan chalaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas paryaapt dhan uplabdh ho
 Therefore, special provision has been made for 'vote on Account'
 jiske dwaara loksabhaa ko shakti di gai he ki vah bajet kii prakriya puri hone tak kisi vittiya varsh ke ek bhaag ke liye peshgi anudaan de sakati he
 Legislation is considered to be the primary function of Parliament
 iske liye pahal adhikanshtah karypalika dwaara kii jaati he
 The government makes legislative proposals
 us par charchaa tathaa vaad vivaad ke pashchaat sansad us par anumodan kii apni muhar lagaati he
 All legal proposals are introduced in Parliament in the form of a Bill
 vidheyak vidhaayi prastaav kaa masauda hota he
 The Bill can be introduced in any one House of Parliament by the Government or by a non-official member
