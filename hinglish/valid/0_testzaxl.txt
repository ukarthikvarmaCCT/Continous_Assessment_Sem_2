 It is usually necessary to cut several times for infection to occur
 These flies live around the rivers, that is why this disease has got its name
 When these worms produce larvae after entering a person's body, they are able to enter the skin in this way
 By doing this, they also infect the next black fly that bites the person
 There are a variety of means for diagnosis, including: keeping skin biopsies in a normal saline and monitoring the exit of the larvae, examining the eyes for the presence of larvae, and the presence of adult worms in bumps under the skin

 kisi adhik garm pind se kisi adhik thande pind main ooshmaa ke pargaman ko ooshmaa antaran kehete hai
 When the temperature of an object is different from that of its surroundings or other object, the transmission of heat energy, also known as the flow of heat or exchange of heat, takes place in such a way that the object and its surroundings take heat-equilibrium
 ; This means that both have the same temperature
 ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam yaa clogiyas ke kathan ke anusaar ooshmaa kaa sanchaar hameshaa adhik garm vastu se adhik thandi vastu kii ore hota he
 Wherever there are variations of temperature in nearby objects, heat communication between them can never be stopped; It can only be reduced
 padaarth ke kanon main sighe sampark se ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko sanchaalan kehete hai
 The transmission of energy may occur primarily by suppressive combustion such as in liquids or by osmosis as in metals or by phonon vibrations as in insulators
 anya shabdon main, jab aasapaas ke parmaanu ek duusare ke prati kampan karte hai, yaa electron ek parmaanu se duusare main jate hai tab ooshmaa kaa sanchaar sanchaalan dwaara hota he
 Conduction is more common in solids, where a mesh of relatively stable spatial relationships between atoms helps in the transmission of energy between them by vibration
 aisi sthiti main jahaan drav kaa pravaah bilkul bhi na ho rahaa ho, taap sanchaalan, drav main kanon ke paraasaran se sidhe anuroop hota he
 This type of heat osmosis differs from nodular osmosis occurring in solids in behavior, whereas codis osmosis is mostly confined to liquids
 dhaatuen saamanytah taap urja kii sarvottam sanchaalak hoti hai
 This is due to the way the metals are chemically bonded; Metallic bonds contain freely moving electrons that can rapidly transmit heat energy to a metal
 jaise-jaise ghanatv ghatata he, sanchaalan bhi ghatata he
 Therefore, fluids are less conductors
 aisa gas main parmaanuon ke bich adhik duuri hone se hota he: parmaanuon ke bich kam takaraav hone kaa matlab he, kam sanchaalan

 The reflectivity and conductivity of all bodies depend on both wavelengths
 planks lau of blike-body radiation ke anusaar taapmaana tivrata kii seemaa tak vidyutchumbakeey vikiran ke tarangadairdhya ke vitaran ko nishchit karata he
 The reflectivity for any body depends on the distribution of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation coming in and therefore the temperature of the source of radiation
 pravaahakta tarangadairghy ke vitaran par or isaliye pind ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he
 For example, fresh ice, which is highly reflective for visible light, looks white due to reflecting sunlight with peak energy wavelength of about 0
5 micrometer

 taap kshamta c ki paribhaasha se sambandh c = dq / dt praapt hota he
 Analyzing this equation in terms of time gives the following identity: dq / dt = C
 This expression can be used in place of dq / dt in the first equation given at the beginning of this section above
 tab, yadi t samay par aise kisi pind kaa taapmaana t he or pind ke parivesh ke vaataavaran kaa taapmaana Tenv he: so: r = ha / c pranali kaa ek sakaaratmak constent vishisht gun he jo 1 / time kii ikai main hona chaiye or isaliye kabhi-kabhi vishisht samay constent t0 ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 is tarah taap pranaaliyon main, t0 = c / ha 
 Thus the above equation can be usefully written in this way: seemaa kii dashaon ke samavesh or visthaapan ke adarsh tareekon dwaara is sameekaran kaa hal yah he: Here, t t is the time temperature in t and zero time, t = 0 or t is the initial temperature
 "agar" The Newtonian solution is then written as: upyogh udaa

 yah prithvi par sabase lambii nadiyon kii suchi he
 It includes river systems of more than 1,000 kilometers
 nadi kii lambaai kii gananaa karnaa bahut kathin ho saktaa he
 It consists of several factors, such as the source, the identity or definition of the estuary and the scale of the measure of the river length between the source and the estuary, which determine the exact meaning of "river length"
 natijatan, kai nadiyon kii lambaai kaa maapan keval sanniktan he
 In particular, there remained a long disagreement over whether the world's longest river is the Amazon or the Nile
 The Nile has traditionally been considered tall, but studies by Brazil and Peru in recent years suggest that when measuring the length of the Amazon River and the para estuary next to it and the longest tidal canal it was measured Was found to be long
 nadi kii adhiktam lambaai nirdhaarit karne ke liye nadi kaa "vaastavik strot" uski us sahaayak nadi ke strot ko mana jaataa he jo muhane se sabase dur sthit ho
 The name of this tributary can be the main river itself
 udhaaharan ke liye, mississippi nadi ke strot ko aam rup se itaska jhil ko mana jaataa he, lekin mississippi tantra kaa sabase duurastha strot jeffrasan nadi he, yah mizori nadi kii ek sahaayak he jo phir mississippi kii ek sahaayak he
 When the length of the Mississippi is measured from this mouth to the farthest source, it is called mississippi-missouri-jefferson
 iske alaava, kabhi-kabhi yah bataanaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki nadi vastav main kahaan se shuru hui he, vishesh rup se ve nadiyaan jinka nirmaan alpakaalik dhaaraon, daldal, yaa parivarti jhiilon dwaara hua he
 In this article, length refers to the length of the longest continuous river channel in a given river system, regardless of name
 ek nadi ke muhane ko nirdhaarit karnaa tab kathin ho jaataa he jab nadi kaa muhaana vishaal hota he jo dhire-dhire chaudaa hote hue sagar main khulata he; udhaaharan ke liye river plate or saint laurence nadi
 kuch nadiyaan jaise okavango, hambolt, or kern kaa koi muhaana nahin he; iske bajaay ye nadiyaan pani kii alp maatra ke saath chalati hai or ant main vashpikrut ho jaati hai, yaa jaleey chattani paraton main chali jaati hai, athwa krishi ke liye mode lee jaati hai
 The exact location of the end of these rivers varies according to the season
 un nadiyon ke udgam ko nirdhaarit karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he jo vibhinn kheton se aane vaale jal strot ke khai main jamaav se gathit hoti hai jinamein sirf barish ke baad jal aata he
 Similarly, in rivers starting in the Chalk region, such as the Chiltern in South England, the length of the upper flow that is dry varies depending on the water level and this level varies according to the season: see Winter
 udgam or muhane ke bich ek nadi kii lambaai maanchitr paimaane ke muddon ke kaaran nirdhaarit karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Small-scale maps generally generalize compared to maps of larger scales, or "smooth" the lines
 aam taur par adarsh rup main sweekrut lambaai maapan un maanchitron par aadhaarit hone chahie jo nadi kii chaudaai dikhaane laayak paryaapt bade hon or jis maarg kaa maapan hoga vah vahi maarg hoga jise ek naav nadi ke bichon-bich apnayegi
 Even when detailed maps are available, length measurement is not always obvious
 ek nadi kii kai shakhaaen yaa anabranch ho sakati hai
 The length may depend on whether the central part of the river is being measured or its banks are being measured
 ek jhil ke madhyam se lambaai ko kaise mapa jaae yah aspasht ho saktaa he
 Seasonal and annual changes can change rivers and lakes
 anya kaarak jo nadi kii lambaai ko badal sakate hai unamem shaamil hai kataav chakra or baadh, baandh, tat bandha or channleekaran
 iske alaava, ghumaav kii lambaai samay ke saath prakritik yaa kritrim katautiyon ke kaaran parivartit ho sakati he, jab ek nayaa channel bhoomi ke sankare kshetra se hote hue nadi ke ek vishaal mode ko paar karata he
 For example, 18 erosion between 1766 and 1885 reduced the length of the Mississippi River by 218 miles from Cairo, Illinois to Orleans, Louisiana
 ye baaten ek nadi kii lambaai ke sateek maapan ko naammumkin nahin to mushkil to banaati hi hai
 Variations in accuracy and precision also make length comparisons between different rivers difficult with the risk of uncertainty
 nimna talika main die gaye data kaa upyog karte samay upar ullikhit charchaa kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 For most rivers, various sources provide conflicting information on the length of a river system

 Although now steam-powered trains and other machines have faded, almost half of the world's electric power is still being generated with the help of steam turbines
 bhaap ingine banane ke ytn kaa sabase pracheen ullekh alexandria ke hero ke lekhon main miltaa he
 Hero was a member of the famous Alexandrian sect schwör bei koran which included masters of erstwhile sciences such as Ptolemy, Euclid, Eratosthenes
 hero ne apane lekh main ek aisi yukti kaa varnan kiya he jisamen ek band baks main vaayu garm kii jaati thi or ek nalee ke maarg se neeche pani bhare bartan kii ore failati thi
 The water of the vessel used to flow into the second tube and it became a fake shower
 phir iske baad is sambandh main kahin koi vivaran nahin miltaa he
 In 1606 AD, some 2,000 years from Hero, Marquesave della Porta, founder of Napoleon's Academy and then a pioneer of science in Europe, used steam instead of air in Hero's sprinkling experiment
 unhone yah bhi sujhaayaa ki kisi bartan ko pani se bharne ke liye yadi use ek nalee dwaara pani se kisi talab se sambandhit kar diya jaay or tab us bartan main bhaap bharkar phir use upar se pani ke dwaara thanda kiya jaay to bheetar kii bhaap sanghanit hokar nirvaat utpann karegi or uski jagah talab se pani bartan main bhar jayega
 In 1698, this suggestion of Marquesve della Porta was used by Thomas Savory in a water dispenser
 is prakaar severy pehla vyakti tha jisane vyavsaayik upyog kaa ek bhaap ingine banaaya, jiskaa upyog khadaanon main se pani ulichane or kuon main se pani nikaalane main hua

 The important work of James Watt is to give the best form of steam engine, which increased the power of human beings ten times and made a huge change in the commercial field
 james wat glassgo main ek chatur vaigyanik yantrarachayita the or 1763 main glassgo vishvavidhyalay ke bhautikee ke professor se unhen ek newkamen ingine kii marammat kaa odash mila jo kabhi thik na chalata tha
 By repairing it, Watts noticed that the fuel wasted badly
 vichaarsheel swabhaav ke wat ne isse shreshth mashin banane kaa vichaar prarambh kar diya
 In this way, he made many discoveries and instruments, from which the steam engine got its present form and became a powerful instrument in the progress of industry and civilization
 bhaap ingine ke nimnlikhit mukhya prakaar hai : In a single-engine engine, the steam acts on one side of the piston and in the two-way engine the steam works on both sides of the piston
 yadi in donon prakaar ke injanon main anya sabhi avasthaaen samaan hon, to dvikriya ingine dwaara praapt shakti duusare prakaar ke ingine dwaara praapt shakti kii dooni hoti he
 This is the reason that an action engine is rarely used these days
 silinder kii dhuree ke urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij hone ke anusaar ingine urdhwadhar yaa kshaitij kaha jaataa he
 The horizontal engine occupies more space than the vertical engine
 urdhwadhar prakaar ke ingine main gharshan aadi kam hota he, jiske kaaran yah kshaitij ingine kii tulana main adhik din tak chal saktaa he
 The speed of a steam engine is in fact its crank shaft rotation per minute
 chaar foot piston stroke evam 80 parikraman prati mintewale ingine main ausat piston chaal 640 foot prati minute hogi
 This engine will be called the low speed engine
 saadhaarant: 100 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se kam chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko nimna chaal ingine kehete hai evam 250 parikraman prati minute kii chaal se adhik chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko ucch chaal ingine kehete hai
 An engine running between 100 and 250 revolutions per minute is called a "medium speed engine"
 ucch chaal ingine kii sabase bada gun yah he ki samaan shakti ke liye yah bahut hi chote aakaar kaa hota he
 Steam is also less expensive due to the high speed, as heat transfer between steam and cylinder takes a very short time in this type of engine
 asanghnan ingine vah bhaap ingine he jisase bhaap kaa nikaas sidhe vayumandal main hota he evam iske liye silinder main bhaap kii daab vayumandal kii daab se kabhi kam nahin honi chahie
 After working steam in the condensing engine, it enters the condenser and converts it into water at atmospheric pressure there
 sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karne se bhaap adhik kaary kar paati he
 In simple engines, each cylinder receives steam directly from the boiler and exhales directly into the atmosphere or condenser
 sanyoji ingine main bhaap ek silinder main, jise ucch daab silinder kehete hai, kuch had tak prasaarit hoti he or uske baad usase kuch bade silinder main, jise nimna daab silinder kehete hai, pravesh karti he evam yahan prasar kii kriya purna hoti he
 Often the low pressure cylinder exits the condenser
 prasar teen yaa chaar silinder main bhi ho saktaa he evam in injanon ko triprasar ingine yaa chatushprasar ingine kehete hai
 The heat engine has the maximum efficiency / T1 with T1 and T2 being the maximum and minimum temperatures in the heat engine cycle
 isse pataa chalata he ki ingine kii dakshata in donon tapon par nirbhar karti he
 The efficiency of the steam engine will increase as the value of it increases and the value of it decreases
 ke mulya ko badhaane ke liye byler se nikal kar ingine main aanevaali bhaap kii daab ko badhanaa hoga, kyonki bhaap kii daab jitani hi adhik hogi kaa mulya utana hi badhegaa
 There is another way to increase
 vah he bhaap ko atitapit karnaa
 The superheat of steam is increased by treating the superheat in the boiler
 ke maan ko kam karne ke liye sanghnitr kaa vyavhaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The condenser is converted into steam water by cold water
 at: achche sanghnitr main kaa maan thande jal ke taap ke baraabar ho saktaa he
 This suggests that the engine will be more efficient by having more pressure in the steam engine and the work done by the superheated steam and converting the steam to water at a temperature equal to the temperature of the cold water obtainable in the condenser
 boyler se bhaap ucch daab par bhapapeti main pravesh karti he
 As soon as the piston reaches the end of the stroke, at the same time the valve moves, in which the steam opens and the steam enters the cylinder
 bhaap kii daab dwaara dhakka die jane se piston aage badhata he
 This is called front stroke
 piston kii chaal dwaara crank, crank shaft evam utkendrak chalate hai
 The entrance of the fender opens the door a bit more
 silinder main bhaap tab tak pravesh karti rahati he jab tak dwaar ekadam band nahin ho jaataa
 At this time, there is a breakup and after this the steam is not stored in the cylinder
 silinder main ai hui bhaap ab prasaarit hoti he evam is prasar main bhaap kaa aaytan bad jaataa he evam daab kam ho jaati he
 Steam works at similar times
 agr stroke ke ant main valve bhapadwar ko nikaas kii ore khol detaa he, jisase bhaap nirmukt hoti he
 The pressure of the ejected steam becomes equal to the back pressure
 nirmochan hone ke kuch kshan ke baad piston peeche kii ore lautataa he evam ise prayaavartan stroke kehete hai
 The piston exhausts the remaining steam in the cylinder while returning to this stroke
 jab piston is stroke ke ant par pahunchataa he, valve nikaas dwaar ko band kar detaa he, jisase bhaap kaa pravaah band ho jaataa he
 There is some steam left between the cylinder top and the piston, which is not released
 phir chakra kii punrariti hoti he
 In this two-way engine, the action of the same chakra is on the other side of the cylinder
 rankin chakra ek saidhantik chakra he, jiske anusaar bhaap ingine kaary karata he
 The main function of the speed regulator is to regulate the speed of the engine
 bhaap ingine ke gati-niamak in do tareekon main se ek hi sahaayta se paribhraman kii gati sthir rakh paata he: The speed regulator, which regulates engine speed by increasing or decreasing the pressure of steam according to the demand of power, is called a barrier regulator
 gatiniamak ek avrodh valve ko chalaata he, jo mukhya bhaap nalee main rakhaa hota he
 In this type of gait regulator, the main motile condyle is the motile regulator
 valve santulit prakaar kaa hota he, arthath bhaapadaab dwaara parinami bal shunya hota he
 When the engine speed increases, the speed of the revolutions of the accelerating condensates also increases, which increases the centrifugal force
 bal kii yah vruddhi unhen gurutvkarshnabal evam niyantran kamaani ke viruddh baahar chalane kaa baadhya karti he
 This causes the valve to close in part
 valve dwaara avrodh hone par piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main kami ho jaati he, jiske kaaran utpann shakti bhi kam ho jaati he
 And as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and as the engine speed decreases, the valve spring rises and the pressure of the steam acting on the piston increases, which in turn increases the speed to normal speed
 But it comes
 avrodh gati-niamak dwaara niyamit bhaap ingine main prayog ke baad yadi ingine main prati ghante vyavahrut bhaap kii taul ko ashwashakti ke saath aankaa jaae, to ek saral rekha praapt hogi
