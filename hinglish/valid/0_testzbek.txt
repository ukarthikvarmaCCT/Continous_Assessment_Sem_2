 a typical rescuer can be a commercial farmer
 gehun or anya fasalon ke bazaar mulya satat ghatate-badhate rahete hai, kyonki unki maang or aapurti main badlaav hota rahata he, jo yada-kada kisi ek disha main sanchalit hote hai
 Based on current prices and forecast levels at the time of harvesting, the farmer may consider which season it is good to sow wheat, but forecast prices are only forecasts
 ek baar kisaan jab gehun bota he, to vah puure fasal ugane vaale mausam bhar ke liye uske prati patibaddh ho jaataa he
 If the actual price of wheat increases greatly between sowing and reaping the crop, the farmer may make money unexpectedly, but if the actual price drops at the time of harvesting, it can be ruined
 yadi kisaan fasal bone ke samay, fasal kii maatra ke baraabar gehun ke kai bhavi sanvidaayen bechata he, to us samay bade prabhaavshaalee dhang se vah gehun ke mulya ko avaruddh kar detaa he- sanvida ek samjhauta he, jiske mutabik bhavi kisi ek nishchit dinaank ko, ek nishchit mulya par, ek nishchit maatra main gehun dene kaa iqaraar hota he
 He has hedged against the risk of wheat prices; Now he does not care at all whether the current price rises or falls, because according to the contract he has been guaranteed a certain price
 ab use yah chintaa bhi nahin kerani he ki kahin kataai ke samay mulya main kami ke kaaran use barbaadi kaa saamana na karnaa pade, lekin iske saath-saath vah kataai ke vaqt mulya main vruddhi hone ke kaaran adhik munaafaa kamaane kaa mauqaa bhi gavaan detaa he
 a stock trader believes that due to the new and efficient method of production of equipment by Company A, the prices of the company's shares will increase next month
 He intends to earn profits from his projected price increase by purchasing the shares of Company A
 lekin company k kaafii asthir upkaran udyog kaa hissaa he
 If the trader buys shares only on the belief that the value of Company A's stock is undervalued, then the deal is speculative

 If the trader manages to make a slow sale of an asset whose price has a mathematically defined relationship with the share prices of Company A, the deal is essentially risk-free
 lekin is maamle main jokhim kam to ho jaataa he, par bilkul khatm nahin hota he
 The trader's portfolio on the first day is: 1000 long shares of company a at the rate of $ 1 per share 500 short shares of company b at the rate of $ 2 per share
 On the second day, a favorable news about the appliance industry is published and the price of the appliance share increases
 company k, majboot company hone ke kaaran, 10% upar jaataa he, jabaki company kha keval 5% upar jaataa he
 1000 long shares of company a at the rate of $ 1

 The example of the above share is an "excellent" example of hedge, which is known as the "pair deal" in the industry, due to the trading in pairs of related securities

 Many hedges do not include attractive financial instruments or derivatives such as sell-offs
 swaabhaavik bachaav ek nivesh he jo nakadi pravaah, yani aay or vyay ke milan dwaara avaanchhneeya jokhim ko kam kar detaa he
 For example, an exporter from the United States is at risk of a US dollar price change and chooses to start a production facility in that market to match the expected income from sales against its cost combination
 ek or udhaaharan ek aisi company kaa he, jo kisi anya desh main ek sahaayak company kholti he or apane parichaalanon ke vitt-poshan ke liye sthaneey mudra main udhaar leti he, haalanki uske swadesh se sthaneey byaaj dar adhik mahangaa ho saktaa he: sthaneey mudra main apekshit aay se rin bhugtan kaa mail karaate hue, mul company ne apane videshi mudra jokhim ko kam kiya he
 Similarly, an oil producer can expect to receive its income in US dollars, but compensates for costs in a different currency; If it is favorable, then it would be necessary to implement a natural hedge, for example, to pay bonuses to employees in US dollars

 For exporters, for the following risk categories, importers have a fall in their accounting currency against the price, also known as volatile risk
 bhavi sanvida or vaayada sanvida bazaar kii pratikul gatividhiyon ke jokhim ke prati bachaav-vyavastha kaa saadhan he
 Originally they evolved from the common market in the nineteenth century, but in the last fifty years a huge world market of products has evolved to protect against the risk of financial markets
 rin jokhim, ek aisa jokhim he ki baadhyataadhari dwaara dey paise kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jayega

 a financial investor can be a hedge fund who decides to invest in a company, say in Brazil, but does not necessarily invest in Brazilian currency
 a hedge fund can distinguish debt risk from the risk of real Brazilian currency by "hedging" currency risk
 vastav main, iskaa matlab he ki nivesh prabhavi rup se brazil main america dollars nivesh he
 Hedging allows the investor to transfer his currency risk to someone else who wants to take a position in that currency
 anya prakaar kii ghatnaon ke prati beemaa ke samaan hi, bachaav nidhi dwaara anya niveshak ko mudra nivesh ke liye bhugtan karnaa padataa he
 Similar to other types of financial products, hedging allows economic activity, which is otherwise not possible
 Increased investment in this way will increase economic efficiency

 To protect your stock against systematic market risk, you make short futures when buying equity
 yaa jab kam stock ho, deergh vaayade karte hai
 There are several ways to hedge and one of them is a neutral trend in the market
 In this method, an equivalent dollar amount in marketable stock is taken in futures
 1 xxrep 4 0 GBP mulya ke vodaphone khariden or bhavi FTSE ke kam 1 xxrep 4 0 mulya khariden
 Another method of protection is beta neutral
 Beta is the historical relationship between a stock and an index
 yadi vodaphone kaa beta 2 he, tab vodaphone ke 1 xxrep 4 0 GBP deergh sthiti main aap bhavi FTSE saude main 2 xxrep 4 0 GBP ke baraabar alp sthiti sahit bachaav karenge 
 If you primarily do futures, you defend your futures against artificial futures
 is maamle main kritrim, ek kritrim bhavi sauda he, jisamen maang or vikray sthiti shaamil he
 Long synthetic futures mean long demand and short sell at the same closing price
 isliye yadi aap apane saude main deergh vaayade karte hai to kritrim alp vaayadon dwaara or iske vipareet, bachaav kar sakate hai
 a contract for difference is a two-way hedge or exchange contract, which allows the seller and buyer to determine the value of the volatile commodity

 If the manufacturer and the retailer agree to a fixed price of $ 50 per mwh for 1 mwh over a trading period, and if the actual group price is $ 70, the manufacturer gets $ 70 from the group, but he gets a $ 20 discount to the retailer Has to be given
 iske vipareet, yadi sahamat sanvidatmak tay qeemat se samooh mulya kam ho, to khudara vyapaaree dwaara nirmaataa ko antar chukaaya jayega
 In fact, the group's volatility is nullified and the parties pay and receive $ 50 per mwh
 haalanki, jo pakshakaar antar chukaata he vah "bina paise ke" he, kyonki bina bachaav-vyavastha ke unhen samooh mulya kaa laabh praapt hota

 in yudhon ko sammilit rup se nepolian ke yuddh kaha jaataa he
 He fought some sixty wars from 1803 to 1815, out of which he was defeated in seven
 in yudhon ke falswaroop europea senaaon main krantikari parivartan hue
 Traditionally, these wars are kept in the series of revolutionary wars that began at the time of the French Revolution in 1972
 armbh main france kii shakti badi teji se badi or napolian ne europe kaa adhikansh bhaag apane adhikaar main kar liya
 After the invasion of Russia in 1812, France suffered a rapid collapse
 europe main anya deshon par nepolian ke aadhipaty sthapit karne ke prayaason ko nishphal karne ke liye europe ke mukhya rajyon ne 1805 i
 main nepolian or france ke viruddh tritiy gut bana liya
 It was led by England
 is gut main england, austria, rus, sweden aadi desh the jabaki austria ke virdohi dakshin germany ke rajyon ne is gut ke viruddh nepolian kaa saath diya
 In May 1803, a mutual war broke out between France and England
 nepolian ne italy ke pidmand rajya ko france main sammilit kar liya, holland ko apane adhikaar main karke vahaan ke entvarp bandargah ko jal sena ke liye vistrut karnaa prarambh kar diya
 His actions were against the interests of England, so on 18 May 1803, England declared war against France
 21 oktober 1805 ko france or spain kii sanyukt jal sena or nelson ke netritv vaali angrej jalsena ke madhya trafalgaar ke sameep samudr main bhayankar yuddh hua
 This is called the War of Trufflegar
 yadhyapi is yuddh main nelson veergati ko praapt hua, par england kii jalsena ne france or spain kii sanyukt jal sena ko trafalgaar ke yuddh main parrast kar diya
 This defeat of France ended the fear of Napoleon invading England from the sea side
 nepolian ne mek ke senapatitv main austria kii sena par akraman kar use 20 oktober 1805 ke ulm ke yuddh main parrast kar diya
 After this victory, the Nepalese captured Vienna
 austria kaa shaasha francis dwitiya vienna chhodkar purv kii ore chalaa gaya
 Napoleon defeated the combined armies of Russia and Austria in the Battle of Austerlitz in October 1805
 yah vijay nepolian kii mahatvapurn vijayon main se thi
 Russia withdrew its forces after this defeat and Austria entered into a treaty of press class with Napoleon on 26 December 1805
 nepolian ke viruddh jo teesraa gut nirmit hua tha usamen ab england or rus hi shesh bache the, baaki sadsy desh nepolian ke haathon parrast ho chuke the
 As a result Napoleon advanced towards Russia and on 8 January 1807 a fierce battle took place between the two armies at a place called Ilo
 14 june 1807 ko freedland ke yuddh main nepolian ne rus ko parrast kar diya
 After this defeat, Emperor Jar Alexander of Russia met Napoleon in a royal boat across the Nemen River
 is avasar par nepolian ne apane aakarshak prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv or madhur shishtachar se jaar ko prasann kar liya
 Finally, the Treaty of Tilsit was signed between the representatives of France, Russia and the administration in the city of Tilsit
 is sandhi main saarvajanik or gupt sharten thim, jo nimnlikhit hai- Public Terms: gupt sharten: Folk literature is a book composed by Dr
 Satyendra, a scholarly writer of folk literature

 The induction coil is a device to obtain high voltage from a low voltage source
 isamen ek crode par lipati do kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinhen praathmik or dwitiyak kehete hai
 The primary coil has much shorter wraps than the secondary
 yah kundali switch dwaara ek bydaree se yojit hoti he
 This switch is of contact and break type, with a spring
 kamaani ke siraper naram lohe kaa ek sansparshak hota he
 The head of the contactor is made of platinum metal, so that the contact does not occur even if the arch is formed repeatedly
 saamaanya rup main yah sansparshak duusare sthir sansparshak se sansparsh karata he or is prakaar praathmik kundali kaa paripath puraa ho jaataa he or usamen dhara pravaahit hoti he
 a field is generated by the current flowing through it
 dwitiyak kundali bhi isi kshetra main sthit he or is prakaar uske prabhaav main he
 When the area of the primary coil increases significantly, the soft iron contactors of the switch are attracted to the core coil
 crode bhi narm lohe ke bana hota he
 Due to the contact's pull to the core, its contact is broken by a static contact; And thus the circuit of the primary coil current is not complete
 aisa hone se usamen pravaahit hone se usamen pravaahit honevaali dhara bhi ruk jaati he
 Actually the current does not become absolutely zero, but due to the inductance of the horoscope, there is a delay of some time in it
 dhara dwaara utpann chumbakeey kshetra kaa bhi isi prakaar nipaat ho jaataa he
 But when this happens, the soft iron contactor is also thrown back to its old position as the core's charm is gone
 isse vah phir sthir sansparshak se sansparsh karne lagata he
 In this way, the circuit of the primary coil current is completed again and the current from the battery starts flowing again
 yah kriya baar baar hoti rahati he
 As a result, the circuit of the primary coil current is repeatedly formed and broken
 is kaaran uski dhara dwaara utpann kshetra bhi aavarti rup main badhata ghatata rahata he
 In this way, the afferent also cuts the wrap of the second coil in a recurring form and has a VIVA in it
 Is generated
 chunki ye prerit voltata, donon kudeliyon kii lapet sankhya ke anupaat main hoti he; at: praathmik voltata kam hone par bhi ati ucch voltata kaa preran ho jaataa he
 It is to be noted that this action occurs due to the decrease and increase of current; And although a steady current of steady value is obtained from the battery, it can still be rotated continuously through the disconnection switch
 praathmik evam dwitiyak kundaliyaan ek hi crode par, abonite athwa or kisi vidyudrodhi nalika par lapeti hoti he, parantu unamem koi, yojan nahin hota, yaa to ve inemil kiye taron se lapeti hoti he, jiske kaaran ek duusare se vidyudrodhi rahati hai; athwa praathmik ke upar ek vidyudrodhi nalee lagaakar dwitiyak ko lapet diya jaataa he
 Repeated formation and breakdown of the circuit produces an arc between the two contacts
 isse sansparshakon ke kshat hone ke alaava aag kaa bhi bhay rahata he
 a capacitor is used in the circuit to avoid arcs, as shown in the figure
 preran dwaara dwitiyak kundali main ucch voltata hone par taatpary yah nahin ki usamen shakti kii vruddhi ho jaati he
 In fact the value of the current decreases in the same proportion
 is prakaar yadi praathmik kundali main 12 volt par 1 ampear dhara lee ja rahi ho, to dwitiyak kundali main 1200 volt par keval ampear dhara hi hogi
 In fact, the value of current in the secondary is very small
 preran kundali ke siddhant par hi gadiyon main prajvalan kundali hoti he
 In that too, a voltage of 6 or 12 volts from a battery is obtained from several thousand volts in the secondary coil, which is necessary for ignition of petrol through the spark plug

 atyadhik sampark ke saath kiye gaye ghor faul yaa jo gend ko khilne kaa ek prayaas nahin hota he, unhen anasportsmanalike faul kaha jaataa he or aam taur par nishkasana kaa kaaran banataa he
 If a team, in a given period, exceeds a certain number of fouls - four in NBA and international games - the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all previous fouls for that period
 , Where the number is determined by league
 america ke college khelon main agar ek team aadhe samay main 7 faul se zyada karti he, to virdohi team ko van-and-van free thro pradaan kiya jaataa he 
 agar ek team aadhe samay main 10 se adhik faul karti he, to virdohi team ko aadhe ke liye sabhi pichley faul par do free thro pradaan kiye jate hai
 In an international game, a player who fouls five, or in an NBA game, fouls six, is not allowed to participate in the remaining games and is called "fouled out"
 ek team dwaara ek nirdhaarit sankhya main faul karne ke baad, use "in da penalty" kaha jaataa he
 On scoreboards, it is usually displayed by an indicator light that reads "BONUS" or "PENALTY", with a bright directional arrow, indicating that the team is free if the opposing team fouls
 Throw will be received
 ek khilaadi ke liye, jo ek shot kaa prayaas na karte hue faul ho jaataa he, pradaan kiye gaye free thro kii sankhya, kiye gaye foulon kii sankhya ke saath badhati jaati he
 Initially, a shoot is given, but after a certain number of extra fouls, the opposing team can get a shot and if the first shot is made then a second shot, called "one-and-one" Is, or two shots can be found
 agar ek team van-and-van ke maamle main pehla shot nahin kar paati he, to virdohi team gend ke adhikaar ko punahprapt kar sakati he or khelnaa jari rakh sakati he
 If a team misses the first shot in a two-shot case, the opposing team must wait for the second shot to be completed before attempting to regain possession of the ball and continue the game
 agar ek khilaadi, shot karne ke prayaas main faul ho jaataa he or shot asafal rahata he, to khilaadi ko prayaas kiye gaye shot kii maatra ke baraabar free thro pradaan kiya jaataa he
 If a player fouls for a regular two-point shot, two shots are scored
 ek khilaadi thri-point shot ke prayaas main faul ho jaataa he, to teen shot praapt karata he
 If a player fouls in a shot attempt and the shot is successful, the player is usually awarded an extra free throw for one point
 ek niyamit shot ke saath sangyojan main yah "thri-point-play" yaa "four-point-play" kehalaata he, jisaki vajah he faul ke samay bani tokari or atirikt free thro 
 Although the rules do not specify any positions, they have evolved as part of basketball
 basketbaal ke vikaas ke pratham paanch dashakon ke dauraan, ek guard, do forward or do centre yaa do guard, do forward or ek centre kaa prayog kiya gaya
 From the 1980s onwards, more specific positions developed, namely: uparokt vivaran lacheele hai
 On some occasions, teams choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one forward or center with a third guard
 sabase adhik adla-badali kiya jane vaala posishan he point guard or shooting guard, khaskar yadi donon khilaadiyon ke paas acha netritv or gend ko sanbhaalane kaa kaushal he
 There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense
 In zone defense, players who remain in the defense position guard the opponent who is in their zone
 main-tu-main difence main prayek difence khilaadi ek vishisht pratidwandvi ko guard karata he or use karrwai karne se rokane kii koshish karata he
 There is more variety in offensive games, which usually include planned passes and movement of players without the ball
 The rapid movement of the ball is called by an aggressive player to gain an advantageous position
 ek aakraamak khilaadi kaa apane saathi ko pratidwandvi dwaara guard karne se rokane kaa sahi prayaas, jisamen vah difender ke raste main aise khadaa ho jaataa he ki uskaa saathi uske bagal se cat karata he, screen yaa pick kehalaata he
 The two games are combined in pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then "rolls" away from the pick towards the basket
 screen or cat aakraamak khel main bahut mahatvapurn hai; inase twarit paas or timwork ko badhaava miltaa he, jo safal tokari kaa maarg prashast karata he
 Teams almost always have multiple offensive games planned to ensure that their plans remain unknown
 In court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which game will take place
 basketbaal ke ucch str par, rakshaatmak or aakraamak sanrachana or posishnon par bal diya gaya he; or yahi sab hai, jin par ek coach aam taur par charchaa karne ke liye time-out kaa anurodh karata he
 Shooting is an attempt to earn points by throwing the ball across the basket
 yadhyapi, khilaadiyon or sthitiyon ke saath tareeqe bhinn ho sakate hai, tathaapi sabase aam takanic nimna rup main rekhaankit kii gai he: The player stands with the legs spread equal to shoulder width, facing the basket, bending the knees slightly and keeping the back straight
 khilaadi gend ko pramukh haath kii ungaliyon par sir se thodaa upar rakhata he, jabaki duusare haath se gend ko bagal se sahaara detaa he
 To aim the ball, the player's elbow must be standing in a straight line, keeping the forearm in the direction of the basket
 The ball is thrown while extending the bent knees and straightening the shooting arm; The ball moves with the tips of the fingers, while the wrist completes the full downward movement
 shooting haath ko, puri tarah se failaate hue gend phenkane ke pashchaat ek pal ke liye sthir rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki kalai puri tarah se mudi hoti he or ungliyaan neeche kii ore ishaara karti hai, ise folo thru ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise sahi dhang se karne se shot kii sateekta badhati he
 Generally, the non-shooting hand is used only to give direction to the shot, not to force it
 aksar khilaadi rim par gend ke prabhaav ko dhimaa karne ke liye, us par ek sthir bahospin daalane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat debatable, but coaches generally recommend a proper arc
 khilaadi sidhe tokari main shot maar sakate hai yaa bechboard kaa upyog karte hue gend ko tokari main pun:preshit kar sakate hai
 The two most common shots using the method described above are the set shot and the jump shot
 The set shot is performed from a standing position, with both feet on the ground and is generally used for free throws
 jamp shot hawa main uchhalte hue kiya jaataa he, jab gend ko chalaang kii sheersh oonchai se phenkaa jaataa he
 This gives more emphasis and expansion and at the same time, allows the player to rise higher than the defender
 pair ke zamin par waapas aane se pehle, gend ko phenkane main vifaltaa yatra-ulanghan maani jaati he
 Another common shot is layup
 This shot requires the player to move toward the basket and "take" the ball "inside" the basket and generally move off the backboard
 Most enjoyable and usually the highest-percentile for the crowd
 The exact shot is the slam sting, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball down, straight through the circle
 ek or shot jo aam hota ja rahaa he vah he "sarkas shot"
 sarkas shot ek nimna-pratishat shot he, jise shooter dwaara hawa main asantulit rahete hue, neeche aakar tathaa / yaa tokari se dur munh pher kar, jatke se uchhaalate hue yaa ghere main shoot kiya jaataa he
 a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is called an air ball
 vishesh rup se ek karaab shot, yaa jo sirf bechboard ko hit karata he, use mazaaq ke taur par brick kaha jaataa he
 The purpose of rebounding is to successfully acquire the basketball right after a free throw or field goal is missed, as it flips through the circle or backboard
 yah khel main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaataa he, chunki adhikansh qabje, ek team ke shot chook jane ke baad samaapt ho jate hai
 There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebound, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and the possession does not change, and defensive rebound, in which the defense team retakes the free ball
 adhikansh ribound rakshaatmak hote hai, chunki jo team difence main hoti he, vah chook jane vaale shot ko pun:praapt karne kii behatar sthiti main hoti he
 The method of transporting the ball between players is called a pass
 adhikansh paas dete samay, shakti-vardhan ke liye ek qadam aage badhaaya jaataa he or sateekta sunishchit karne ke liye haathon ko aage badhaate hai
 a major pass is the Chest Pass
 gend, paas karne vaale ke seene se sidhe resiver ke seene par jaati he
 In a proper chest pass, the thumbs flare outward to increase velocity and the defense does not get a chance to react
 paas kaa ek anya prakaar he bouns paas 
 isamen paas dene vaala, gend ko apane seene se resiver ke seene tak laharaa kar bouns karte hue do tihaai duuri tak le jaataa he
 The ball falls on the court and moves towards the receiver
 chest paas kii tulana main bouns paas ko puraa hone main zyaada vaqt lagata he, lekin virdohi team ke liye bich main rokna mushkil bhi hota he 
 is prakaar, khilaadi bheed bhare mauqon par yaa ek difender ko paas karne ke liye, aksar bouns paas kaa upyog karte hai
 Overhead passes are used to pass the ball over a defender
 gend, pasar ke sir ke upar se chodi jaati he
 The outlet pass is made when a team gets a defensive rebound
 ribound ke baad aglaa paas outlet paas hota he
 The important aspect of any good pass is that it is difficult to stop
 achche pasar kaaphi sateekta ke saath gend ko paas karte hai or unhen thik se pataa hota he ki unke prayek saathi ko gend kahaan praapt karnaa pasand he
 a special way of doing this is to pass the ball without seeing the receiving partner
 This is called no look pass
 passing kii ek anya unnat style he bihaind da back paas, jisamen iske naam ke anuroop, pasar dwaara peeche kii ore team ke ek saathi ko gend phenkna shaamil he
 Although some players can make such passes effectively, many coaches do not encourage a no-look or behind the back pass, believing it is difficult to control and more likely to lead to turnovers or violations
 gend ko ek haath se lagaataar oochhaalane kii karrwai ko dribling kehete hai or ek khilaadi ke liye gend ke saath qadam badhaane ke liye, yah ek apeksha he
 To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with fingers instead of hitting it with the palm; This ensures greater control
 jab dribling karte hue ek pratidwandvi ke saamne se guzarate hai to dribler ko apane haathon ko pratidwandvi se adhiktam duuri par rakhte hue drible karnaa chahie, jisase rakshaatmak khilaadi ke liye gend ko paanaa or adhik mushkil ho jaae
 isliye yah ek khilaadi ke liye mahatvapurn he ki vah samarth rup se donon haathon se drible karne main sakasham ho
 Good dribblers bounce the ball less to the ground, reducing the distance the ball travels from hand to ground, making it more difficult for the defender to "steal" the ball
 achche gend sanchaalak badi tivrata se apni peeth ke peeche se, apane pairon ke bich main drible karte hai or achaanak disha badal lete hai, jisase ek abujh dribling paddati banati he jiske khilaaf difend karnaa adhik kathin ho jaataa he
 This is called crossover, which is the most effective way to overtake the defender while dribbling
 ek kushal khilaadi, gend kii sthiti kii khabar rakhane ke liye, drible gati yaa paridhiy drushti ke upyog dwaara, gend ko bina dekhe drible kar saktaa he
 When there is no need to focus on the ball, a player may see teammates or opportunities to score points, as well as avoiding the risk of someone else stealing the ball from him
 jab kisi shot ke prayaas ke baad, ek difender gend chhukar shot ko badalane main safal hota he, to ek block nishpadit hota he
 In almost all versions of the game, it is illegal to touch the ball when the ball is way below its radius; This is known as goaltending
 bechboard ko chhu lene ke baad ek shot ko block karnaa bhi avaidh he, yaa jab gend kaa koi bhi bhaag rim se pratyaksh rup se upar he
 To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach higher than the height from which the shot is missed
 Thus, height may be as an advantage in blocking
 khilaadi jo lambey hai or aam taur par power forward yaa centre posishan par khelte hai, ve guard posishan par khilne vaale kam lambey khilaadiyon kii tulana main adhik block darj karaate hai
 However, with good time-management and sufficiently high vertical jumps, shorter players can also be effective shot blockers
 peshewar str par, adhikansh purush khilaadi 6 feet 3 inch se upar hai or adhikansh mahilaayein 5 feet 7 inch se upar
 gards, jinke liye shaareerik samanvay or gend sanchaalan kaa kaushal mahatvapurn he, aam taur par sabase chote qad ke khilaadi hote hai
 Almost all forwards in the men's pro league are 6 feet 6 inches or longer
 adhikansh centre 6 feet 10 inch se adhik lambey hai
 According to the survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches and the average weight is about 222 pounds
 The players, who are the tallest in the NBA to date, are - Manit Bol and Gheorg Muresan, both were 7 feet 7 inches tall
 vartmaan main sabase lanbaa NBA khilaadi yaao ming he, jo 7 feet 6 inch ooncha he
 The smallest player to play in the NBA to date is Mugsy Bogus, whose length is 5 feet 3 inches
 Other smaller players flourished at the Pro level
 Anthony "spud" Webb was only 5 feet 7 inches tall, but his vertical The jump was 42-inches, giving him significant height at the time of the jump
 NBA main varsh 2006-07 ke sizan ke dauraan sabase chota khilaadi arl boykins he, jisaki oonchai 5 fit 5 inch he
 While younger players are often not good at defense against shooting, they make their way through the crowded areas of the court with great speed and their ability to steal the ball with miniature is their strength
 basketbaal ke bhinn rup, basketbaal ke khel par aadhaarit gatividhiyaan hai, jisamen basketbaal ke aam kaushal or upkaran kaa upyog hota he
 Some variations have only superficial rule-changes, while other forms are different games in which different effects of basketball can be seen
 anya bhinn roopon main bacchon ke khel, pratiyogitaayen yaa gatividhiyaan shaamil hai, jinka uddeshy khilaadiyon ke kaushal ko sudrudh karnaa he
 Apart from the main basketball games, there are many different forms of basketball, including - wheelchair basketball, water basketball, beach basketball, slamball, streetball and unicycle basketball
 An early version of basketball was six-on-six basketball, which played until the late 1950s
 yahaan tak ki ek danki basketbaal bhi he, jo gadhe par khelaa jaataa he, lekin vah sanskaran pashu-adhikaar samoohon ke hamale ke antargat aa gaya
 Games, which use basketball skills and equipment, include - the popular version of the half-court game, which is played in an informal setting without referee or strict rules
 shaayad sabase aam bhinn rup haaf court khel he
 Only one basket is used and the ball is necessarily "cleared" - passed or dribbled off the half-court or three-point line - each time there is a change from one team to another on the right of the ball
 haaf court khel main, kam hridayavahini kshamta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki khilaadiyon ko puure court main aage-peeche bhaagane kii jarurat nahin hoti
haaf court khel main court par prayukt khilaadiyon kii sankhya bhi adhik he, ek mahatvapurn laabh, jab kai khilaadi khelnaa chaahate hon
 There are other basketball games like dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke viklang diggajon dwaara rachit wheelchair basketbaal, shaareerik rup se viklang logon ke liye vishesh rup se dizine kii gai wheelchair par khelaa jaataa he
 The governing body of wheelchair basketball in the world is the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation
 water basketbaal, ek swimming pool main khelaa jaataa he or isamen basketbaal or water polo ke niyamon ko mila diya gaya he
 This modified version of basketball played on beaches was invented by Philip Bryant
 bich basketbaal ek vrittakar court main gol par bina bechboard ke, bina out-of-bounds niyam ke khelaa jaataa he, jahaan gend ko paas yaa 21⁄2 qadam dwaara chalaaya jaataa he, chunki ek naram sataha par dribling lagbhag asambhav he
 Beach basketball has become a very popular and widely played competitive sport
 pandrah vaarshik vishwa championships kaa aayojan kiya ja chukaa he
 Sting hoops are a variant of the game of basketball, played on basketball hoops with a relatively low height rim
 isaki utpatti tab hui, jab slam dank kii lokapriyata badi or ise nichi rim ke saath or parivartit goltending niyamon ke prayog se, dank ke or behatar mauqe banane ke liye viksit kiya gaya
 Slamball is full-contact basketball including trampolines
 net ke aar-paar gend ko khel kar ank arjeet kiye jate hai, jaisaa ki basketbaal main, haalanki ank arjan ke niyamon ko sanshodhit kiya gaya he
 The main difference from parent sport is the court; There are four trampolines on the ground below the padded basketball rim and backboard, prompting players to greater heights for slam dunks
 chaar khilaadi vaale tiimon ke sadasyon ko, niyam bhi kuch shaareerik sampark kii anumati dete hai
 Streetball is a less formal version of basketball, played on playgrounds and gymnasiums around the world
 aksar court kaa keval aadha hissaa prayukt hota he, anyathaa khel ke niyam basketbaal ke bilkul samaan hi hai
 The number of participants in a game or in a run can range from one defender and one individual offense to two full teams with five players
 duniya bhar main streetbal ek bahut lokapriy khel he or sanyukt rajya america ke kuch shaharon ne streetbal kaarykram yojit kiye hai, jaise midnit basketbaal
 kai shahar apane saptahanth lambey streetbal toornament bhi yojit karte hai
 Unicycle basketball is played on a normal basketball court with the same rules as a regulation basketball experiment, for example a player must dribble while riding
 aise kai niyam hai jo unicicle basketbaal ke liye vishisht rup se hai jaise ki gend ko in-bounding karte vaqt ek khilaadi kaa kam se kam ek paanv pedal par hona chahie
unicicle basketbaal aam taur par 24" yaa choti unicicle ke upyog se khelaa jaataa he, tathaa court or khilaadiyon ke paanv ke agle bhaag, donon ko sangrakshit rakhane ke liye plastic pedal kaa upyog kiya jaataa he

 basketbaal ke aise saamaajik roopon main shaamil hai: Fantasy basketball was inspired by fantasy baseball
 mul rup se haath se aankadon par nazar rakhte hue khelaa jaataa he, yah 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan internet ke aagaman ke baad lokapriy hua

 mahavir ne apane bhikshuon ko upadesh dete hue kaha he ki unhen bolte-chaalate, uthte-baithte, sote or khate-pite sadaa ytnsheel rahanaa chahie
 Attachment is a violence in the works of rituals, so conquering the disorders, suppressing the senses and narrowing all your instincts is called true non-violence in Jainism

 ye panch parameshthi hai
 Just as Kaal is divided in Manvantar kalpa etc
 in Hindus, similarly Kaal in Jain is of two types - Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 avasarpini kaal main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan,aayu,bal ityadi ghatata he jabaki utsarpini main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan or aayu, bal ityadi badhata he in donon kaa kaalmaan das krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he arthath ek samaychakra bees krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he
 Each Tirthankara, 12 Chakravarti, 9 Baldev, 9 Narayana and 9 Pratinarayana are born in each Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 inhen tristh shlakapurush kaha jaataa he

 ye hi dwadashang jain dharm ke mul granth maane jate he
 How ancient Jainism is, cannot be said exactly
 jain grantho ke anusaar jain dharm anadikaal se he
 Mahavir Swami or Vardhaman attained nirvana 527 years before Christ

 The Jains have divided their texts into Agam, Purana etc
 pro jecobi aadi ke aadhunik anveshanon ke anusaar yah siddh kiya gaya he kii jain dharm buddha dharm se pehle kaa he
 The antiquity of Jainism is also found from the inscriptions of Udayagiri, Junagadh etc
 hindu granth, skanda puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| In Indian astrology, the style of the Greeks propagated three hundred years behind the Vikram Samvat
 par jainon ke mul granth angon main yavan jyotish kaa kuch bhi abhas nahin he
 Just as the Ved Samhita of the Brahmins has a five-year age and constellations are counted from the Kritika, similarly the Jana texts are also in the scriptures
 isse unki pracheenta siddh hoti he
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many sages and acharyas in this tradition, the main of which are- tirthankar mahavir ke samay tak avichhin rahi jain parampara isa kii teesri sadi main do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gayi : digambar or shwetambar
 Muni Pramanasagar ji has written in detail on this division of Jains in his work 'jainism and Philosophy' that Acharya Bhadrabahu knew on the strength of his knowledge that a severe famine of 12 years is going to happen in North India, so he gave all the sadhus Instructed that to avoid this terrible famine, one should travel to South India
 acharya bhadrabahu ke saath hajaaron jain muni dakshin kii ore vartmaan ke tamilnadu or karnataka kii ore prasthaan kar gaye or apni sadhana main lage rahe
 But some Jain monks stayed in North India itself
 akaal ke kaaran yahan ruke hue saadhuon kaa nirvaah aagmanuroop nahin ho paa rahaa tha isliye unhone apni kai kriyaayein shithil kar leen, jaise kati vastra dhaaran karnaa, 7 gharon se bhiksha grahan karnaa, 14 upkaran saath main rakhana aadi
 After 12 years, the sadhus who returned from the south saw all this and they explained to the sadhus residing here that you once again adopted the tradition of Tirthankara Mahavir, but the sadhus did not agree and then Digambara and Shvetambara became two sects in Jainism
 digambar sadhu vastra nahin pahante he, nagn rahete hai or sadhviyaan shwet vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In Digambar Matha, the idols of the Tirthakaras are made completely naked and they are not adorned
 digambar samudaay teen bhaagon vibhakt hai
 Shwetambars and Sadhvis and Saints wear white robes, idols of Tirthakaras are made and decorated with metal eyes, coils on the idol
 shwetambar bhi do bhaag me vibhakt he: Sthanavasi also has two parts: - digambar aacharyon dwaara samast jain aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he - Elementary Sutra - Granth accepted by all Jains pramukh jain granth hai :- Kalpasutra jain dharm ke pramukh tyohaar is prakaar hai

 The problem with sulfur is that it dissolves the molten cast iron, which causes less moving defects
 sulfur mangneej ke prabhaav ke pratikaarake liye louh sulphide ke bajaay mangneej sulphide milaayaa jaataa he
 Manganese sulfides are lighter than molten lava, so they float out of the melt and clinker

 With small amounts of silicon and rapid cooling, the carbon in white cast iron, precipitated from the molten material via solid cementite in the phase of metallic stabilization metastable, fe3c, precipitated out, instead of as graphite
 Composite substances that melt as relatively large particles are precipitated, usually, in another eutectic mixture, where there is another phase
 These eutectic carbides are so large that they can be reached by providing stiffness to precipitation
