 One-digit plays are called Ekanki
 angreji ke "van act play" shabd ke liye hindi main "ekanki naatak" or "ekanki" donon hi shabdon kaa samaan rup se vyavhaar hota he
 Acacia in the West became extremely popular and popular in the 20th century, especially after the First World War
 hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon main uskaa vyapak prachlan is shatabdi ke chauthe dashak main hua
 This does not mean that Ekanki literature is a completely insignificant genre
 purv or pashchim donon ke natya sahitya main uske nikatavarti rup milte hai
 Many of the distinctions of metaphors and epithets based on the character, chivalry, chronology, rasa, etc
 of the hero in Sanskrit Natyasastra have been described by Dr
 Keith as Ekanki Nataka

 pashchim ke natyasahitya main aadhunik ekanki kaa sabase praarambhik or aviksit kintu nikatavarti rup "interlude' he
 Hilarious passages are also added to overcome the boredom born of the moral preaching of virtue and moral educative English morality plays practiced in the 15th and 16th centuries
 aise hi khand interlude kahe jate the
 These became independent of morality plays respectively and eventually culminated in the satirical-humor-oriented short plays of the three characters
 "kartin reiser' yaa patonnayak kaha janevaala ekanki, jisaki tulana sanskrit naatakon ke arthopakshepak yaa prekshank se kii ja sakati he, pashchim main aadhunik ekankiyon kaa nikatatam purvavarti tha
 Due to the elite socials coming to the theater after eating food late at night, the ordinary socialists who came on time had great inconvenience
 rangashaalaon ke maalikon ne is bich saadhaaran saamaajikon ko manoranjan main vyast rakhane ke liye dwipatriya prahasanpurn samvaad prastut karnaa shuru kiya
 This type of independent dialogue was called the "curtain Razor"
 isamen kathanak evam jivan ke yatharth or naatakeey dwandv kaa abhaav rahata tha
 Subsequently, "curtain Razor" was replaced by well-planned short plays with realistic plot and dramatic duality
 inke vikaas kaa aglaa kadam aadhunik ekanki tha
 Ekanki became so popular that in order to protect big plays, the commercial theater houses started removing it from them
 lekin usamen prayog or vikaas kii sambhaavnaaon ko dekhakar pashchim ke kai deshon main avyavsaayik or prayogtmak rangamanchi andolanon ne use apana liya
 London, Paris, Berlin, Dublin, Chicago, New York etc
 carried forward this new form of drama and its theater
 iske atirikt ekanki naatak ko pashchim ke anek mahan yaa sammanit lekhakon kaa bal mila
 Such authors include Chekhov, Gorky and Ekrinov of Russia, Giraudo, Sartre and Enail of France, Taller and Brecht of Germany, Pirandelli of Italy and Oscar Wilde, Galsverdi, j
m

, are notable
 rangamanchi andolanon or in lekhakon ke sammilit evam adamya prayogtmak saahas or utsaah ke falswaroop aadhunik ekanki sarvatha nai, swatantra or suspasht vidha ke rup main pratishthit hua
 The general characteristics of Ekanki plays can be studied on the basis of their works
 sataha par hi bade naatakon or ekankiyon kaa akaargat antar spasht ho jaataa he
 Ekanki plays can usually be played in 20 to 30 minutes, while three, four or five-digit plays take several hours to perform
 lekin bade naatakon or ekankiyon kaa aadharbhoot antar aakaaratmak na hokar rachanaatmak he
 In the three to five-digit plays of the West, two or more storylines were intertwined
 is prakaar unamem ek pradhan kathanak or ek yaa kai upakthanak hote the
 Sanskrit plays also had such subtitles
 aise naatakon main sthaan yaa drishy, kaal or ghatnakram main anwarat parivartan swaabhaavik tha
 But it is not possible in Ekanki
 ekanki kisi ek naatakeey ghatana yaa maansik sthiti par aadhaarit hota he or prabhaav kii ekaagratha uskaa mukhya lakshya he
 Therefore, compilation of place, time and event in Ekanki is considered to be mandatory
 kahani or geet kii tarah ekanki kii kala ghanatv yaa ekaagratha or mitvyayta kii kala he, jisamen kam se kam upkarnon ke sahare zyada se zyada prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he
 Ekanki's storyline perspective is very narrow, there is only one main event, one main character, one climax
 lambey bhaashanon or vistrut vyakhyaaon kii jagah usamen samvadalaghav hota he
 The qualitative distinction between big drama and Ekanki is clear from this, that Ekanki cannot be created by cutting the body of big drama, just like pulling the body of Ekanki and creating a big drama
 sanskrit naatyashaastra ke anusaar bade naatak ke kathanak ke vikaas kii paanch sthitiyaan maani gai hai : aarambh, praytn, praptyasha, niyatapti or falaagam
 The Natyashastra of the West also mentions many similar situations: ascension, climax, descent, and end, from the beginning or role, ambush retraction or duality of characters and events to the climax of the plot
 pashchim ke naatakashastra main dwandv par bahut jor diya gaya he
 In fact, drama is an art of duality; In the larger drama, instead of the gradual development of characters and events in the narrative, the plot of the lives of some characters is revealed by leading the plot to its climax
 ekanki main is charmotkarsh kii dhuree keval ek dwandv hota he
 The development of duality can be quite slow in the plot of a big drama, with all events taking place in theaters, or just before the event that drastically brings the duel to its climax
 aksar yahi charmotkarsh ekanki kaa ant hota he
 In addition to the realistic and psychological depiction of life's problems, this feature of the composition distinguishes modern Ekanki from its adjacent forms in Sanskrit and Western theatrical literature
 aksar abhinay ke liye kahaniyon ke roopaantar se yah bhram paidaa hota he ki ekanki kahani kaa abhinaeya rup he
 But despite the basic similarity of density and austerity in composition, there is a distinct distinction between story and unity
 rangamanch kii vastu hone ke kaaran ekanki main abhinay or cathopakathan kaa mahatv sabase zyada he
 It is through these that Akanki creates the characterization, plot and contract of its duality, atmosphere and events
 kahani kii tarah ekanki varnan kaa aashray nahin le saktaa
 But a pose of acting can be more impressive than a longer narration of the story
 isliye rangamanch ekanki kii seemaa or shakti donon he
 Many successful storytellers are left unsuccessful because of its lack of recognition
 isi prakaar kisi vishay par rochak sambhaashan yaa cathopakathan ko ekanki samajhnaa bhramamaatr he
 In the absence of the reality of life, the story or the story, the duality of the characters, compilation, etc
, the speech remains only speech, it cannot be called Ekanki
 ekanki kii adbhut sambhaavnaaon ke kaaran aadhunik kaal main uskaa vikaas anek dishaao main hua he
 Radio metaphors, music and poetry, and monologues or welcome plays are some of the important achievements of these new directions
 radio ke madhyam se in sabake kshetra main nirantar prayog ho rahe hai
 In the absence of theater, always actors and actresses, their acting and postures, the radio metaphor has to use words and their sound and pictorial power more and more
 moort upkarnon kaa abhaav radio roopak ke liye sarvatha baadha hi nahin, kyonki shabd or dhwani ko unke moort aadhaaron se pruthak kar naatakkaar shrotaaon ke dhyaan ko charitron ke aantarik dwandvon par kendrit kar saktaa he
 The radio metaphor is barely 50 years old
 praarambhik avasthaa main isamen kisi kahani ko anek vyaktiyon ke swaron main prastut kiya jaataa tha or rangamanch kaa bhram utpann karne ke liye paatro kii akritiyon, veshbhusha, saaj sajja, ruchiyon ityadi ke vistrut varnan se yatharth vaataavaran ke nirmaan kaa praytn kiya jaataa tha
 In the western countries like USA, Germany, England etc
, the experiments of radio acuity developed and developed its form
 radio ke liye kai prasiddh amareeki or angrej kaviyon ne kavyarupak likhe
 Notable among them are mcleish, Stephen Vincent Bayne, Karl, Sandberg, Tyrom Githrui, Louie mcneice, Sackville West, Patrick Dickinson, Dealon Thomas, etc
 in prayogon se prerana grahan kar hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke ekankikaron ne bhi radio roopak, geetinaty or kavyarupak prastut kiye hai
 But they still have many errors
 hindi sahitya ke itihaaskaar ekanki kaa prarambh bhaaratenduyug se maanate hai
 The second phase of Prasad's "A Sip", the third from Bhubaneswar Prasad's "caravan" and the fourth phase has been started with Dr
 Ramkumar Varma's "silky Tie" compilation
 kintu ukt kalvibhaajan main un ekankikaron ko sammilit nahin kiya gaya he, jinhone 1955 i
 ke aasapaas likhnaa prarambh kiya he or aaj bhi likh rahe hai
 Therefore, the brief history of Hindi Ekanki is as follows: bhaaratendukaal main do prakaar ke ekanki likhe gaye
 First, translated or shaded singular and second, primordial acacia
 pehali koti main bhaaratendu kaa bagalaa ke "bharatmata' kaa anuwaad "bharat janani'; radhacharan goswami dwaara banglaa ke "bharter yavan' kaa anuwaad "bharatvarsh main yavan log', kaanchanacharya krit "dhananjay vijay' kaa chhayavisht roopak, ayodhysihan upaadhyaay kaa "pradhyumnvijay vyayog' aadi hai
 In the second category, India-centric "vishasvishmaushadham", "premjogini", Gitarupaka "niladevi" and "satipratap"; Radhacharan Goswami's "tanpanadhan Gosai Ke Arpan", "sati Chandrawali", "amarsingh Rathore", and "sridama"; Kishori Lal Goswami's "chaupat Chapat '; Radhakrishnadas's" Dukh Khinibala "; Ambikadatta Vyas composed "kali Yuga and Ghee" and "mind Ki Umang"; Srisharan's "balavivaha"; Balakrishna Bhatt's "kaliraj Ki Sabha", "rail's Khel Khel" and "child Marriage"; Pratapnarayan Mishra's "kalikautuk"; Devkinandan Tripathi's work "jai Narasimha Ki"; Kashinath Khatri's "rajkumaris of the Indus Country", "queen of Gunnaur" and "lajbo's Dream"; Lala Srinivasadas's "prahlad Charit"; Badrinarayan Premaghan's "prayag Ramagaman"; aitihaasik aakhyaan tathaa samajasudhar ke prasang hi uparyukt ekankiyon ke vishay hai
 These can be said to be the initial form of modern unity
 kala kaa viksit rup inamen nahin miltaa; sheliyaan paraspar kuch bhinn hai par parampara ek hi he
 The above figures are more than the actors
 lekhakon kaa jhukaav jivan kii sthulata kaa varnan karne kii ore he; vrittiyon kii sookshm vivritti inamen nahin milti
 There are some, but not all, uses of introduction, preamble, sutradhar, nandi, mangalacharan, multiple visual planning, Bharatavakya etc
 aakaar sarvatra lambey hai, ank bhi drishy or drishy bhi garbhaak jaise ho gaye hai
 There is a lack of subsistence of compilations, the multiplicity and development of loose dialogues and the excess of configurationless planets
 inamen se kuch prahasan ke rup main likhe gaye hai, par unamem nirmal hasya na hokar vyangy kii maatra hi adhik he
 They lack the essential quality function required for a unit
 ekanki ke duusare yug main jaishankar prasad kaa "ek ghunt' likhaa gaya jisapar sanskrit kaa bhi prabhaav he or banglaa ke madhyam se aae paashchaatya ekanki shilp kaa bhi
 Prasad ji meanwhile also wrote "kalyani Parinay", but he is still unpublished
 saath hi, ise unke "chadrangupt' naatak kaa ek bhaag bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Some of the plays of French playwright Mollier were also translated into Hindi during this period
 "ek ghunt' main ekanki ke kamobesh lagbhag sabhi aadhunik lakshan mil jate hai
 The marriage problem has been discussed and resolved in an emotional style
 parantu "ek ghunt' ek hi rah gaya; anya lekhakon ko yah ekanki lekhan kii ore pravrutt na kar sakaa
 The third phase of Ekanki begins with Bhuvanesvaprasad's "caravan 'collection which has six Ekankis
 1938 i main "hans' kaa ekanki ank prakashit hua
 The then representative Ekanki was presented
 isi bich satyendra kaa "kunal', prithvinath sharma kaa "duvidha', ramkumar verma kaa "prithviraj kii ankhen'; suryasharan pari kaa "belavan yaa pratigyaapurti' aadi prakashit hue
 Uday Shankar Bhatt, Seth Govinddas Prabhriti Ekankar also trended towards Ekanki writing during this period and many of his powerful figures came to light
 is yug main prakhyat or utpaada donon prakaar ke kathankon ko lekar ekanki likhe gaye
 Vivahadi social and communist political problems have emerged prominently in them
 pracheen vichaardhaara kii vakaalat joardaar shabdon main kii gai he, parantu iske saath naveen ko apnaane kaa aagrah bhi spasht dikhaai padataa he
 With the influence of Western thought and style, Ekanki made a substantial change in its appearance and its technique brought about a certain degree of stability
 dekha jaae, to yah kaal ekanki vidha kaa parimarjan kaal tha
 Writers put their hands to this time with good use
 san 1935 i
 se radio prasaranon ke antargat ekankiyon ko bhi sthaan diya jane laga tha, at: radio ekanki athwa dhvaninataka bhi kaaphi sankhya main likhe jane lage
 By the time of reaching the fourth stage, the form of Ekanki, the craft etc
 are completely stabilized, their authentic form comes out
 isse pehle to vah apana sahi rup talashne main laga tha
 This era originated from Dr
 Ramkumar Varma's "silky Tie" collection, it has already been told
 iske atirikt verma ji ke "actress', "rajani kii raat', "ek tole opium kii keemat', "pariksha', "nahin kaa rahasy', "kahan se kahan', "charumitra', "das minute' aadi ekanki prasiddh hai

 Meropi Gaunt was the daughter of Marvolo and sister of Moffin
 harry kaa meropi ke vishay main pehla prabhaav aaj tak ke sabase zyada haari hui insaan ke rup main padaa

 uskaa maananaa tha ki uske mata -pita kii magaluon se nikatataa isolt ke liye sahi nahin he
 The ferocious and fanatical Garmlath used black magic to isolate Islott from the Magaloo, not allowing him to use a stick, not even entering Hogwarts, as he himself did
 12 saal uske saath rahane ke baad islot ne garmaleith kii chadi chura lee tathaa vah america upnivesh ke ore bhaag gayi or masachusets main rahane lagi

 He could attract everyone with his look
 aisa anumaan he ki uske manushya rup se daitya banane kaa kaaran apni amar hone kii chahat main aatma ko vibhajit karke horcrax bananaa tha
 Voldemort's eyes in the film are blue and the pupil rounded
 rolling ne voldemort kaa "saikadon varshon kaa dushtatam jaadugar" ke rup main varnan kiya he
 He described her as "highly psychotic, lacking the human response to other people's suffering"
 saath hi use apni kushi ke kaaran dusron, visheshkar magaluon, ke katl karne vaala dikhaaya he
 There was a lack of consciousness in him, he did not regret his actions but he did not even understand the importance of his extra humanity
 use na to manushya ke saath saahchary yaa mitrataa sthapit karnaa pasand nahin tha or na hi use kisi se pyaar yaa lagaav tha
 He considered himself superior and considered everyone inferior in front of him
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah " vastav main avishwasaneey dhang se takat kaa bhookha, naslvaadi" tha
 If he looked in the mirror mirror, he would see himself as "omnipotent and indestructible" as he wanted
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah vah apni maan va jaaduugarani meropi gont dwaara ek magalu va uske pita tom riddle par prem kaadhe ke falswaroop utpann hua tha, jo ek asafal pyaar kaa parinaam tha
 His mother dies due to the effects of decoction and the father leaving his mother, but if his mother had lived and loved him, everything would have changed
 vah aakarshan jiske kaaran tom riddle ke rup main janme balak kaa voldemort main parivartan hua vah bahut aavashyak he kyonki yahi vah sankalpana dikhaata he jiske kaaran is paatr kaa janm hua
 Like almost all the villains, Voldemort's eagerness causes his downfall
 vah mrityu se atyadhik bhay tha, jise usne sharmnaak tathaa ghrunit insaani kamajori bataayi he
 He had many signs of being egoistic
 apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne voldemort ne yah mana he ki usne harry ke mata-pita par hamale kii badi keemat chukaai he, or phir usne yah avlokan kiya ki isamen kya galat hua or ant main vah ye dosha swayan par letaa he
 Rolling has written that his polymorphism would have been his last journey
 rolling ne voldemort or harry main antar bataate hue kaha he ki harry ne mrityu ko sweekaar kar liya tha is kaaran se vah ant main uski tulana main adhik taqatvar hokar ubhara
 Rolling throughout the series describes Voldemort as a highly powerful, intelligent and ruthless evil sorcerer
 vah dusro kaa dimag achche se pard saktaa tha or swayan ke dimag main ghusane se dusro ko roak bhi saktaa tha
 Apart from Dumbledore, he was the only known magician who used to be silent
 voldemort ek maatr jaadugar dambldor se darataa tha
 In the last book, Voldemort was shown flying without any support, anyone who read or saw this was taken aback
 apane purvaj gonton kii tarah vah bhi sarpon se sarpbhasha main baat kar saktaa tha
 He got this skill from his ancestor Salazar Slytherin
 gont parivaar swayan kii baatcheet main bhi is bhashaa kaa prayog karte the
 This extraordinary trait may have been genetically ingested in it, as this tradition was followed in the Gaunt family to maintain purity of blood
 jab voldemort navjaat harry kii hatya kaa prayaas karata he tab uski aatma ke hisse ke saath sarpbhasha main bolne kii kala harry main bhi chali jaati he

 chathe bhaag main puraani kahani dekhne ke dauraan voldemort ne dambaldor ke saamne ek naukari ke saakshaatkaar ke dauraan daawa kiya ki usne "jaadu kii simaayen pehle se adhik badha di hai"
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort sambhavtah hoguarts kaa sabase budhimaan vidhyaarthee he
 But despite Voldemort's unique talent and skill, he was unfit to withstand such powerful magic as love; No powers worked at this time
 puure shrunkhlaa main uski yah sabase badi jaadui ayogyata dikhaai gayi he
 Voldemort initially begins to doubt his magical powers, but after regaining his body and strength he confesses to his life-worshipers that he had ignored the power of Lily Potter's love that saved Harry's life
 
 rolling ne apni website par khulaasa kiya he kii voldemort kii chadi ek sadahrith vriksh se bani thi jiskaa ras jaharila tha jo kii mrityu kaa pratik tha
 It was thoughtfully designed with an axis similar to Harry's wand, made of an evergreen pruned bush
 ise unhone isliye chunaa tha kyonki sadabahaar kaatedaar jhaadi shatru se badla lenaa kaa pratik maani jaati he
 Rolling establishes in the book that Voldemort was magically associated with him through a scar made on Harry's forehead
 jab usne harry ko mrityu shraap diya or uskaa ulta asar usee par ho gaya, tab yah nishaan harry ke maathe par ban gaya tha
 In the book and films it is shown that Harry's mark was indicative of Voldemort's presence
 yah tab adhik dard karata tha jab anishtdev uske nikat hota tha yaa vah nirdayee yaa bahut khush hone vaala bhav darshata tha
 According to Rolling, at the time of the attack on the newborn Harry, Voldemort gave Harry a magical window of his mind as a forehead mark that no other magician does
 bahut se log voldemort ke paatr kaa kuch raajnneetigyon se tulana karne lage
 Rolling posited that Voldemort was "a type" of Adolf Hitler
 rolling ne voldemort kii tulana soviet sangh ke taanashaah joseph stallin se bhi kii he
 Harry Potter and Azkaban incarcerated director Alfonso Kuoran compared Voldemort to former US President George Walker Bush and former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein because they both had selfish interests and starved of power

 Egypt remained a highly complex and stable culture for a millennium

 After the pharaoh, Egypt came under the influence of Greekism, then for a short time under the influence of Christianity and finally under the influence of Islamic culture
 misri shashan vyavastha purnat: dharmatantric thi
 The Egyptian King was believed to be the representative of Suryadev Ray himself
 mrityu ke baad unki puja unke piramid ke saamne bane mandir main hoti thi
 This belief became so strong that in the fourth century BC Alexander also had to satisfy the Egyptian people by declaring himself as the son of emon-re
 unke prajajan unka naam tak lene se jhijakte the, isaliye inhen praaia: 'acha devtaa' athwa 'per o' kaha jaataa tha

 Egypt was divided into about 40 provinces for official convenience
 ye vastav main ve pracheen rajya the jinako ekikrut karke pratham vansh ke pehle do rajya---uttari or dakshini--sthapit kiye gaye the
 But now they were ruled by governors appointed by the pharaohs in place of independent kings
 madhya rajya yug main prantiy governron tathaa saamanton kii shakti vishesh rup se badi or samrajya yug main samraat kii
 Egyptian society was divided into five classes: royalty, feudal, priest, middle class and serfs and slaves
 bhoomi siddhantat: pherao ke haath main thi
 In practice, he mostly divided it into priests, descendants of old kings and feudatories
 unki badi-badi jaagiron main das or surf kaam karte the
 The middle class consisted of clerks, traders, artisans and independent peasants
 pracheen rajya yug main sabase adhik pratishtha rajpariwaar, saamanto or pujaariyon kii thi
 The middle class gained importance with the feudal lords in the Middle Kingdom era and the military class in the imperial era
 varg vyavastha ascharyajanak rup se lacheelee thi
 Every person could take any profession
 keval rajpariwaar ke sadsy is adhikaar se vanchit the
 Surfs also often rose to high positions
 lekin ucch or nimna varg ke logon ke rahan sahan main baari antar tha
 The rich lived in huge airy buildings and in small huts of poor dirty neighborhoods

 Accordingly, each person could have only one wife and the child's family property was inherited

 But rich men had many concubines

 Women had a very prestigious place in society

 Agrarianism was the basis of the economic life of the Egyptians

 Farming in Egypt was relatively easy

 There was a great demand for the best quality linen fabrics
 mixriyon ke in udyog dhandhon ko jhaanki unke relif chitron main surakshit he
 Egyptians were polytheists since time immemorial
 unhone apane devataaon kii kalpana praaia: manushyon athwa pashupakshiyon athwa milijule rup main kii
 Most of their gods were divine forms of natural powers
 surya, chandra tathaa nil nadi ko hi nahin varan jharanon, parvaton, pashupakshiyon, latakunjon, vrikshon or vividh vanaspatiyon tak ko ve daivi shakti se abhihit maanate the
 He imagined the sky as a divine cow named Noot or a divine cow named Hathor
 memphis kaa pramukh devtaa ta: kisi prakritik shakti kaa daivikaran na hokar kalaon or kalakaaron kaa sangrakshak tha
 The Sun was worshiped in various names and forms in almost all places in Egypt
 uttari misr main uski puja kaa mukhya kendra on naam kaa sthaan tha
 Here he was called Ray and was conceived as an old man walking westward
 thibij main uskaa naam emon tha
 Its main center in southern Egypt was a place called Edfu
 vahaan uski upasna baj pakshi ke rup main horus naam se hoti thi
 When the United States was founded, these various forms of the Sun began to be considered integral and its joint name eman-re became popular
 uskaa pratik 'pakshayukt surchachakr' misr kaa rajchihn tha
 According to the belief of the Egyptians, he first ruled as the pharaohs
 suryadev ke akashagami ho jane par prithvi par uske pratinidhi pheraon rajya karne lage
 Of these, the first place is given to Osiris
 yadhyapi kahin-kahin usko surya kaa putr bhi kaha gaya he, tathaapi vah mulat: nil nadi, prithvi kii urvar shakti tathaa haritima kaa daivikaran prathit hota he
 As a king he proved to be extremely benevolent and just
 shasankarya main use apni bahin or patni isis se bahut sahaayta mili
 His evil brother Seth murdered him with deceit
 baad main isis ne horus naamak putr ko janm diya
 He raised him secretly in the estuarine region
 yuvavastha praapt karne ke baad horus ne ghor sangharsh karke set ko parajeet kiya or apane pita ke apmaan or vadh kaa pratishodh liya
 The importance of Osiris increased greatly in the Middle Kingdom era and it was believed that every mritma attends the court of Osiris in the hereafter
 vahaan ausiris apane 42 adheen nyaayadhishon kii sahaayta se uske karmo kii jaanch karata he
 Those mortals who were successful in this investigation were sent to Yarulok to consume the heavenly pleasures and whose mortal life was full of misdeeds, they were tortured severely
 samrajya yug main pujari varg atyant dhani or sattadhari ho gaya
 This broke the close relationship that was established between religion and virtue in the Middle Kingdom era
 ab swayan dharm ke sangrakshak bhoga-vilaas kaa jivan vyateet karne lage
 The devadasis appointed to entertain the 'gods' used to really entertain them
 ab unhone mritkon ko paralok kaa bhay dikhaakar yah daawa karnaa shuru kiya ki agar ve chahen to apane jaadu ke jor se paapishthon ko bhi swarg dilaa sakate hai
 Not only this, they used to sell such confessional certificates openly
 in praaanpatron kii tulana madhyakaalin europe main isai padariyon dwaara beche janevaale papamochak praaanpatron se kii ja sakati he
 This was the state of Egyptian religion when Amenhotep IV became the Adhishwar of Egypt in 1375 CE
 usne prarambh se hi pujari varg main faile bhrashtachar or raajnneeti par unke avaanchhneeya prabhaav kaa virodh kiya or aton naamak ek naye devtaa kii upasna ko lokapriy banane kaa prayaas kiya
 In his praise, he also named his name Akhnatan
 aton mulat: suryadev re kaa hi naam tha
 But Akhnaton described him as not only the Egyptian, but the only deity of the whole world
 kyonki aton niraakaar tha, isaliye akhnaton ne uski murtiyan nahin banavaain
 But the general public was able to glorify his glory, so he considered the 'suryachakra' as his symbol
 aton kii upasna main na bahut adhik chadhaave kii aavashyaktaa thi, na jatil karmkand, tantramantra or pujaariyon kii bheed kii
 It was enough to just accept Aten's gratitude by heart and offer some letters, flowers and fruits as a symbol of reverence while praising him
 uske paralokwaad main narak kii kalpana nahin milti kyonki vah yah soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki dayaalu pita aton kisi ko naarkeey peedaayen de saktaa he
 Akhnaton initially behaved with tolerance towards other deities, but on the fierce opposition from the priests, he closed the temples of other deities
 unke pujaariyon ko nikaal diya, apni praja ko keval aton kii puja karne kaa aadesh diya or saarvajanik smarakon par likhe hue sab devataaon ke naam mitwa die
 But Akhnaton's thoughts and actions were not compatible with his time
 isaliye uski mrityu ke saath uskaa dharm bhi samaapt ho gaya
 After that, his son-in-law Tutenkhatan re-established the old religion, returned the rights of the priests and changed his name to Tutenkhamen
 misr kii pracheen lipi chitrakshar lipi kahi jaati he
 'hieroglyph' is a Greek word
 iskaa arth he 'pavitra chihn'
 In total there were about 2000 drawings in this script
 inamen kuch chitron main manushya kii vibhinn akritiyaan aadi he
 These signs are of three types: emotional, phonetic and indicative
 chitraksharon ko banaate samay vastuon ke yatharth rup ko ankit karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa tha, isaliye ise likhane main bahut samay lagata tha
 To overcome this difficulty, the Egyptians developed a type of fast or cursive script during the reign of the first dynasty
 mixriyon ne pracheen rajya yug main 24 aksharon kii ek varnmaala kaa avishkaar karne main bhi safalataa praapt kii thi
 He used the alphabet as an auxiliary to emotional and voice images, not as an independent medium
 aathvin shtabdi i0 pus0 ke lagbhag mixriyon ne 'hiretic lipi' se bhi shighratar likhi janevaali lipi kaa avishkaar kiya jise 'dimatik' kaha jaataa he
 It can be called a type of shorthand script
 misr main pracheen rajya kaal se hi pepirus likhane kaa saamaanya saadhan tha
 Parchments and pieces of pottery were also used for writing
 un par chitrakshar narkul kii lekhnee se bhi banaae jate the or brush se bhi
 The Egyptian literature practice was practical
 unki adhikansh kritiyaan aisi hai jo kisi na kisi vyaavhaarik uddeshy kii purti karne ke liye likhi gai thim
 That is why he was never able to compose epics, plays and even literary figures
 unke jin aakhyaanon kii charchaa kii gai he, ve sab samrajya yug ke ant tak keval janakathaon ke rup main prachlit the
 They were never written as separate literary works
 piramid yug kii vishisht dharmik rachanaayen piramid texts hai
 These include chants, prayers and prayers etc
 used in the rituals of the deceased, which were engraved on the reefs of the pyramids of the dead pharaohs to make the parochial life free
 inase hi kalantar main 'coffin texts' tathaa 'book ov di ded' kaa vikaas hua
 The rest of the literature is also practical
 udaahranarth imhotep, kegamne tathaa ta:hotep ityadi mantriyon ne apane anubhavajanit gyaan ko lekhabaddh kiya
 These works are called 'ethics'
 madhya rajyayugin rachanaaon main 'mukhar krishak kaa aavedan', 'ipuver kii bhavishyavaanee' 'emenmhet kaa upadesh' tathaa 'veenavadak kaa gaan' pramukh hai tathaa samrajyayugin kritiyon main akhnaton ke stotra
 Egyptians were interested in only those areas of science which were required in practical life
 jigyaasa ke simit hone ke baavjood unhone kuch kshetron main ascharyajanak safalataa praapt kii
 For example, he had made a map of the sky by estimating the position of planets and constellations quite accurately
 saura panchang kaa avishkaar unki mahatvapurn safalataa thi
 The main rules of mathematics were invented long ago for addition, subtraction and division to meet business and administration requirements
 lekin guna se ve ant tak aparichit rahe
 They used to do its work jointly

 He came to solve the primary problems of algebra and geometry, but experienced difficulty in finding the area of an odd quadrilateral
 vrutt, ardhgola or silinder kaa kshetrafal nikaalane main kaaphi safalataa praapt kar lee thi
 He was exceptionally skilled in planning the buildings
 unke karigar stambhon or mehraton ke prayog se parichit the
 He had also made substantial progress in medicine
 mixriyon ke liye kala unke rashtriya jivan ko abhivyakt karne kaa madhyam thi
 The best evidence of this is his pyramid
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki misri nareshon ne inhen rajya kii aarthik vyavastha bigadane par janata ko rojgaar dene ke liye banwaaya tha
 But it seems impossible
 jis samay ye piramid banaae gaye the misr samrudh desh tha, isaliye inkaa nirmaan aarthik sanghathan ke daurbalya kaa kaaran mana ja saktaa he, parinaam nahin
 In fact, the Egyptians created the pyramids to express the impermanence and pride of their kingdom and its symbols
 agar pheraon amar the to unki mrit deh kii suraksha or uske nivas ke hetu unki mahatta ke anuroop vishaal or sthaayee samaadhiyon kaa nirmaan aavashyak tha
 According to Herodotus, the 'giant pyramid' of Gijeh was built by one lakh persons in twenty years
 yah teraa acre bhoomi main bana he or 480 foot unchaa tathaa 755 foot lanbaa hai
 It has 23 stone blocks of two and a half tons
 ye itani chaturata se jode gaye hai ki kahin kahin to jod kii chaudaai ek inch ke hajaarwein bhaag se kam he
 Egyptian architecture was exhibited in the construction of temples in the imperial era
 piremidon ke samaan ye mandir bhi praaia: kathortam pashaan se banaae gaye he or atyant vishaal he
 The temple of Kanark is probably the largest building in the world
 yah 1300 foot lanbaa he
 Its intermediate chamber is 170 feet long and 338 feet wide
 isaki chat chah panktiyon main banaae gaye 136 stambhon par tiki he jinamein madhyavarti baarah stambh 79 foot unche hai or unamem se prayek ke sheershabhag par sau vyakti khadey ho sakate hai
 The temple of Abu Simbel built in Egyptian Nubia is actually a cave temple
 yah 175 foot lanbaa or 90 foot unchaa he
 The roof of its intermediate chamber is based on 8 pillars 20 feet high with 17 feet high sculptures of Osiris
 laxor kaa mandir amenhotep tritiy ne banwaaya tha
 But he could not complete it
 vaastukala ke samaan vishalata, sudridhtaa or roodhiwaadita bhi misri murtikla kii visheshtaayen thim
 The idols of the kings were mostly made from hard stone in huge size and without any emotion
 unhen praaia: kursi par pair lataka kar merudand ko sidhaa kiye or haathon ko jaanghon par rakhe baithne kii mudra main athwa haath latakaae bayen pair aage badhaakar chalane kii mudra main dikhaaya gaya he
 The statues of Thatmos III and Remesis II seem to touch the sky
 khefe ke piramid ke saamne sthit vishaal 'sphiks' naamak murti sambhavat: vishwa kii vishaltam murti he
 Its body is of a lion and the head is of a khafre
 in sabase bhinn hai akhnaton ke kaal main bani kuch murtiyan jinamein swayan akhnaton or uski rani nafrotiti kii murtiyan vishesh ullekhneey hai
 Its creator artists were free from the shackles of old traditions
 aisi kuch murtiyan saamaanya janon kii bhi mili hai
 Among them, the wooden statue of an overseer of the ancient kingdom, safe in the Cairo Museum, whose head is only residual, is very famous
 yah 'shaikh kii murti' naam se vikhyath he
 The 'clerical statue' of the Lubre Museum also appears to be very life-threatening
 misr main mandiron or mastabaaon main relif chitra banane vaale kalakaaron kii bhi bahut maang thi
 While making such sculptures, the width of the marked object was easily shown, but there was difficulty in showing thickness or roundness
 isaliye unke relif chitron main kaaphi aswabhaaviktaa aa gai he
 But despite this flaw, the Egyptian relief paintings are visible and throw light on the ancient Egyptian civilization and customs
 misr kii chitrakala ke adhikansh namoonay nasht ho chuke he, lekin jo shesh hai, dharmik or raajnneetik roodhiyon se aprabhavit lagate hai
 In Egypt, it seems, the development took place much later even after the painting was born in the Pyramid era
 isaliye yah kala dharm kii paridhi se baahar rah gai
 The best of the available specimens of Egyptian painting are of Akhnatan times
 chitrakala ke atirikt samrajyayugin misri anya anek lalit kalao main bhi daksh ho chuke the
 Valuable wood, leather and gold-made furniture tools left from Tutankhamen's tomb excavated in 1922, about 3300 years ago, ebony and carved boxes, golden chariots adorned with gold and precious stones, gold-crowned throne, beautiful stones of white stone and brocade
 Beautiful royal robes of, are available

 The International Financial Reporting Standard is the standard, formulation and framework adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board
 IFRS ke gathan ke kai maanak antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak ke puraane naam se jane jate hai
 International accounting standards were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the International Accounting Standards Committee
 1 april 2001 ko nai IASB ne IASC se antarrashtriya lekhankan maanak sthapit karne kaa uttardaayitv grahan kiya
 The new board adopted the existing IAS and sics during its first meeting
 The IASB continued the process of developing its standards under the new standards IFRS
 IFRS ko "aadarshon par aadhaarit" maanakon kaa samooh-bandha mana jaataa he jisamen vistaarit niyamon evam unke upachaaron ke liye vishesh aadesh sthapit kiye gaye hai
 The International Financial Reporting Standards include: vittiya vivaranon kii upkram evam upasthapana ke liye ek ruparekha bhi he jo IFRS main antarbhukt uddeshyon kii vyakhya karti he
 IAS 8 Article 11 "anuchhed 10 main ullikhit nirnay karne main, prabandhan ko nimnlikhit sroton ke sandarbh main prayojyata paranimn kram main vichaar karnaa hoga: Requirements and guidance of standards and representations to deal with common and related issues; And paribhaashaayen, manyata ke maandand or mapankan kii avadharanaenjo ruparekha main aastiyon, deytaon, aay or vyay ke liye hai
 "' vittiya vivaranon ke upkram evam upasthapana kii ruparekha IFRS ke moolbhoot siddhanton kaa vivaran prastut karti he
 The IASB states that: lenden main vishesh rup se lagu hone vaale maanak athwa pratipaadan kii anupasthiti main prabandhan ko lekha niti ke vikaas evam vyavhaar ke nirnay kaa prayog avashya karnaa chahie jisase ki praasangik or vishwasaneey soochna pratifalit hoti he
 In making such a decision, IAS 8
11 management also needs to take into account the definitions, recognition criteria and the concepts of measuring assets, liabilities, income and expenditure in the framework
 ruparekha ke mahatva ke utthapan ko IAS ke 8wein anuchhed ke sanshodhan main 2003 main joda gaya tha
 The framework itself is the foundation of accounting standards
 ruparekha ke anusaar vittiya vivaranon kaa uddeshy kisi ikai kii vittiya sthiti, uske nishpaadan evam vittiya parivartanaa ke bare main suchit karnaa he jo vyapak str par upyogkartaaon ko aarthik nirnay lene main tathaa ikai ke shairdharakon evam aam janata ko maujuuda vittiya sthiti kii jaankaree dene main upyogi he
 The underlying assumptions applied in IFRS are as follows: ruparekha main varnit vittiya vivaranon kii gunatmak visheshtaayen hai: The financial position of an enterprise is first presented in its balance sheet
 tulan patr ke tatva athwa ve tatva jo vittiya sthiti ko aankate hai ve nimna hai: 1
 Asset: Asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise, which is a byproduct of past events and which the enterprise expects for future economic benefits
 2
 deyta : deyta udhyam kii vigat ghatnaon se ubharne vaali vartmaan baadhyataa he, jiskaa niptaan udhyam se bahirgamit hone vaale sansadhano kaa parinaam he, jaise ki, aastiyon kaa
 3
 Equity: The residual interest after deducting all the liabilities from the assets of an enterprise is called equity
 equity ko maalik kii equity bhi kehete hai
 The financial performance of an enterprise is first shown in the income statement or profit and loss account
 aay ke vivaran ke tatva athwa jo aay vittiya nishpaadan ko maapte hai ve nimna prakaar se hai: 4
 Revenue: During the period of accounting, equity increases due to increase in investment or assets resulting in increase in economic profit or decrease in liabilities
 haalanki, isamen equity ke pratibhaagiyon, jaise ki, maalik, bhagidaar or share dharakon ke anshdaan shaamil nahin he
 5
 Expenditure: Loss of economic benefits or outgo in depreciation or liabilities in assets in the form of outflows during the period of accounting resulting in loss of equity
 vittiya vivaran main kisi mad kii pahchaan tab hoti he jab: Article 99
 Measurement is the process of determining the monetary amount on which the elements of financial statements are identified and carried forward to the balance sheet and income statement
 isse maapan ke vishesh aadhaar kaa chayan hota he
 Article 100
 In financial statements several types of measurement bases are employed in varying levels and in varying combinations
 unamem nimnlikhit shaamil hai: Historical cost
 Assets are recorded at the time of their acquisition at the fair value of the amount paid in cash or cash equivalent or the consideration paid to acquire them
 vyavsaay kii saamaanya disha main, deytaon ko baadhyataa ke vinimay kii prapti par abhilikhit kiya jaataa he athwa kuch paristhitiyon main, nakad raashi yaa nakad ke samatuly bhugtan kii apeksha deyta kii bharpai ke liye kii jaati he
 current cost
 Cash amount or cash equivalents to be repaid if an equal or equivalent asset has been acquired, then the assets are carried forward
 nakad yaa nakad baraabar raashi kii deytaon ko aage le jaaya jaataa he jisaki aavashyaktaa vartmaan main baadhyataa ke niptaan main hogi
 Value receivable
 Such assets are carried forward which can be found by selling cash or cash equivalents in systematic settlement
 niptaan ke mulya par deytaon ko aage badha diya jaataa he; jo ki bina batte kii nakad raashi yaa nakad ke samatuly bhugtan kii apeksha rakhti hai taaki vyavsaay kii saamaanya gati main deytaon ko chukaaya ja sake
 Current price
 Assets are carried forward at the discounted value of the arrival of future net worth in which the item is expected to be born in the normal pace of business
 deytaon ko vartmaan battagat mulya par bhavishya ke nival nakad bahirvah par aage le jaaya jaataa he jisaki apekshit aavashyaktaa vyapaar kii saamaanya gati main deytaon ke niptaan ke liye hoti he
 Article 101
 The basis of measurement most commonly adopted by units in financial statements is historical value
 yah saadharantaya anya maapan aadhaaron ke saath sanyukt he
 For example, goods are carried forward at a lower cost and net realizable value
 vipanan yogya pratibhutiyon ko bazaar mulya par or pension kii deytaon ko unke vartmaan mulya par aage le jaaya jaataa he
 Additionally, some units are unable to dispose of them with the historical cost accounting method due to the impact of changing prices of non-monetary assets; Therefore they use the current cost basis
 anuchhed 102
 puunji kii avadharana adhiktar ikaayiyon ke dwaara unke vittiya vivaranon main apanaai gai he
 Under the financial concept of capital, such as the amount invested or the purchasing power invested, capital is synonymous with the net asset or equity of the entity
 puunji kii vastuparak avadharana, jaise ki sanchaalan kshamta ke antargat, ikaayiyon ke pratidin utpaada ke aadhaar par puunji ikai kii utpaadak kshamta ke rup main maani jaati he
 Article 103
 The appropriate concept of capital should be selected by an entity based on the needs of the financial statements of the users
 Thus, the financial concept of capital should be adopted only when the users' financial statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or purchasing power of invested capital
 Nevertheless, if users' main concern is with the operational efficiency of the unit, then the objective concept of capital should be used
 The chosen concept points towards the goal of reaching the determination of profit, while some difficulties of measurement may arise in operationalizing the concept
 anuchhed 104
 anuchhed 102 main puunji kii avadharana puunji ke rakh-rakhaav ke liye nimnlikhit avadharanaon ko janm detii he
 Maintenance of financial capital
 Under this concept profit is earned only when the financial amount of net assets at the beginning of the period increases at the end of the period, excluding disbursements made to owners or contributions received from them in that period
 vittiya puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kaa maapan yaa to maatra kii maudrik ikaayiyon yaa nirantar kray shakti kii ikaayiyon se kiya ja saktaa he
 Maintenance of Objective Capital Under this concept profit accrues only when the unit's physical production capacity or the need for resources or funds at the end of the period to achieve that capacity, except for any distribution to the owners or contribution from them, At the beginning of the period, the material output exceeds the capacity
 anuchhed 105
 puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana kaa sarokaar keval is baat se he ki koi ikai kis prakaar puunji ko paribhaashit karti he jis kaaran iske rakh-rakhaav kii jarurat padati he
 It forms the link between the concept of capital and the concepts of profit because it refers to the issue by which profit is measured
 yah kisi ikai kii puunji par pratifal tathaa isaki puunji kii vaapasi ke bich antar spasht karne ke liye pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Maintenance of capital can be considered as profit only in the event of arrival of excessive amount of assets and hence is considered as return on capital
 atah laabh vah avshisht raashi he jo kharchon ke baad bhi batch jaati he use aay se gata diya jaataa he
 If the expenditure exceeds the income then the residual amount is considered a loss
 anuchhed 106
 vastugat puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana ko maujuuda laagat ke aadhaar par maapan ko apnaane kii aavashyaktaa he
 However, the concept of maintenance of financial capital does not require the use of any special measurement
 is avadharana ke antargat chayan kaa aadhaar vittiya puunji ke prakaar par nirbhar he jiske rakh-rakhaav kii talash ikai ko rahati he
 Article 107
 The main difference between the two concepts of maintenance of capital is the treatment of the effect of changes in the values of assets and liabilities of the unit
 aam shabdon main, ek ikai ne apni puunji kaa rakh-rakhaav kiya he agar iske paas avadhi ke ant main utani hi puunji he jitani kii avadhi ke aarambh main thi
 Any amount in excess of the requirement for the maintenance of capital at the beginning of the period is a profit
 anuchhed 108
 vittiya puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana ke antargat jisamen puunji ko naam maatr kii maudrik ikai ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, laabh us avadhi main naam maatr kii mudra puunji kii vruddhi kaa nirupan karata he
 Thus, the increase in the value of assets over the entire period has traditionally been considered to be holding benefits, which is the principle
 haalanki, ho saktaa he vinimay ke lenden main jab tak aastiyon kaa niptaan nahin ho jaataa tab tak is rup main na pahachaanaa ja sake
 jab vittiya puunji ke rakh-rakhaav kii avadharana ikai kii achal kray shakti ke rup main paribhaashit kii jaati he, laabh us avadhi main niveshit kray shakti main vruddhi kaa nirupan karata he
 Thus, the same fraction of the increase in the prices of assets that generally surpass the rise in prices is considered a gain
 baaki bachi hui vruddhi ko puunji ke rakh-rakhaav ke samaayojan, arthath equity ke ek ansh ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Article 109
 Under the concept of maintenance of objective capital, when capital is defined in terms of objective productive capacity, then profit represents an increase in capital over that period
 ikai kii aastiyon or deytaon par asar daalane vaali sabhi keemton main parivartanon ko ikai kii vastugat utpaadan kshamta ke maapan main parivartanon ke rup main dekha jaataa he; atah unhen puunji ke rakh-rakhaav ke samaayojan ke rup main samajha jaataa he jo equity ke ansh hai na ki laabh hai
 Article 110
 The concept of measurement grounds and maintenance of capital will determine the accounting model used in the presentation of financial statements
 Different accounting models exhibit a different level of relevance and reliability, and, as in other areas, management must seek a balance between relevance and reliability
 This framework is applicable across a range of accounting models and provides guidance in the preparation and presentation of financial statements prepared within the selected model
 maujuuda samay main, yah IASC board kaa makasad apekshaakrit apwaad kii paristhitiyon ke atirikt ek vishisht model nirdhaarit karnaa nahin he, jaise ki un ikaayiyon ke liye jo atisfitikaarak arthvyavastha ke rup main mudra kii soochna dete hai
 However, this objective will be reviewed in the light of worldwide developments

 Borobudur is still open to the pilgrims and celebrates at the Buddhist religious monument in Indonesia once a year on Vaishakh Purnima
 borobudur indonesia kaa sabase adhik daura kiya jane vaala paryaton sthal he
 Ancient temples in Indonesia are called by the name of Chandi, hence the "borobudur Temple" is sometimes called the Chandi Borobudur
 chandi shabd bhi shithilatah pracheen banaavaton jaise dwaar or snaan se sambandhit rachanaaon ke liye prayukt hota he
 Although the origin of the word Borobudur is unclear and the major ancient temples of Indonesia are not known
 borobudur shabd sarvapratham sar thomas raddles kii pustak java kaa itihaas main prayukt hua tha
 Raffles wrote about a monument called Borobudur but no older document of this name is available
 keval pracheen java taalptr hi is ore sanket karte hai ki smarak kaa naam budur pavitra buddha poojasthal nagarkaretagma ko kaha jaataa he
 This table was written in 1365 by Majapahit Rajdarbari and Buddhist scholar Mpu Prapancha
 kuch maton ke anusaar borobudur, naam bore-budur kaa apbhransh rup he jo raddles ne angrezi vyakaran main likhaa tha jiskaa arth "''bore gaanv ke nikatavarti budur kaa mandir" tha; adhikansh chandion kaa namakaran nikatom gaanvon ke naam par hua he
 If it is considered to be in accordance with the Java language, the name of the monument should be "budurborough" / Raffles also suggested that Budur is probably derived from the modern Java language word Buddha - "ancient burrows"
 haalanki anya puraatatvavettaon ke anusaar naam kaa doosraa ghatak java bhashaa je shabd bhudhara se bana he
 According to other possible etymologies, Borobudur is the local Java simplified unambiguous pronunciation of Biara Beduhur written by the Sanskrit word Vihara Buddha Uhr
 shabd buddha-uhar kaa arth "buddha kaa nagar" ho saktaa he jabaki anya sambhavit shabd beduhur pracheen java bhashaa kaa shabd he jo ajtak bali shabdaawalee main maujuud he jiskaa arth ek "ucch sthaan" hota he jo stambh shabd dhuhur athwa luhur se bana he
 According to this, Borobudur means Buddha's Vihara in a high place or mountainous area

 Borobudur was built on a cliff at an altitude of 265 m above sea level, 15 m above the surface of a dry lake
 is pracheen jhil ke astitv kaa mudda 20veen sadi main puratatvavidon ke bich gahan charchaa kaa vishay tha
 In 1931, according to the theory developed by w ॰ o ॰ j ॰ Neuvenkamp, a Dutch artist and Hindu and Buddhist architecture scholar, Kedu Plain used to be a lake in ancient times and Borobudur was initially represented by a lotus flower floating on the same lake

 The time of its construction is estimated by comparison with the reliefs engraved in the temple and the inscriptions commonly used during the 8th and 9th centuries

 This corresponds to the peak period of the Shailendra dynasty in central Java from 760 to 830 AD

 The estimated time of its construction is 75 years and the construction work was completed in the year of Samratung around 825 AD
 java main hindu or buddha shaskaon ke samay main bhram kii sthiti he
 The Shailendra dynasty is considered an ardent follower of Buddhism, although according to stone inscriptions found in Sojomerto, he was a Hindu
 yah wo samay tha jab vibhinn hindu or buddha smarakon kaa kedu maidani ilaake ke nikat maidani or pahari kshetron main nirmaan hua
 Buddhist monuments including Borobudur were established around the same time as the Hindu Shiva Prambanan Temple
 720 i main shaiva raja sanjay ne borobudur se keval 10 kimi purv main vukir pahari par shivlinga devalayas ko shuru kiya
 The construction of a Buddhist temple, including Borobudur, was possible at that time because Rakai Picatan, Sanjay's successor, allowed Buddhist followers to build such temples
 san 778 i se dinaankit kalsan raaj-patr main likhe anusaar, vastav main, unke prati apana sammaan pradarshan karne ke liye picktan ne buddha samudaay ko kalsan naamak gaanv de diya
 Just as the Hindi king assisted in the establishment of Buddhist monuments or did so by a Buddhist king, some archaeologists inspired by the idea that there was never a big religious conflict in Java
 haalanki, yah is tarah he ki vahaan par ek hi samay par do virdohi rajvansh the—buddha shailendra rajvansh or shaiva sanjay—jinamein baad main ratu boko mahalay par 856 i main yuddh hua
 Confusion exists about the Lara Jonggarang temple of the Prambanan complex, which was founded by Rakai Picatan, the conqueror of the Shailendra dynasty, in response to Borobudur of the Sanjay dynasty

 a vague mention of the monument is found in the medieval period around 1365 in Mpu Prapancha's book Nagarkaratagama written in the Majapahit period and mentions "vihara in Budur"

 The memorial could not be forgotten completely, because folk stories connected its glorious history with failure and misery to superstitions

 In 1896, King Chulalongkorn of Shyamesh visited Java and requested Borobudur to take the idols

 Borobudur attracted attention at the time in 1885 when Yazermann, president of the archeology community, found a hidden leg

 The Dutch East Indies government took steps to protect the monument after this discovery

 These included the art historian Brandeis, the Dutch Army engineer officer Theodore van Erp and the Public Works Department construction engineer van de Kummer

 For the first seven months of its repair, excavations took place around the monument to find the heads of the Buddha statues and the stones of the pillars
 vine arp ne teenon upari vrittakar chabutare or stupon ko dhvasth karke punah nirmit kiya
 Meanwhile, van Erp explored other topics to improve the monument; He proposed a further proposal which was approved with an additional cost of 34,600 guilders

 santhaan ko iske vipareet koi bhi hindu athwa buddha punyasthaan sanrachana nahin mili or isi kaaran se isaki praarambhik sanrachana hindu athwa buddha ke sthaan par sthaneey java samskruti ke anuroop maani jaati he
 Borobudur was built in the form of a large stupa and when viewed from above it attained the form of a huge Tantric Buddhist mandala, as well as representing the nature of Buddhist cosmology and the mind
 iskaa mul aadhaar vargakar he jisaki prayek bhujaa 118 meter he
 It has nine floors, of which the lower six are square and the upper three are circular
 upari manzil par madhya main ek bade stupa ke chaaron ore bahattar chote stupa hai
 Each stupa is bell-shaped with many decorative holes

 The form of Borobudur is derived from the sopan-pyramid

 The local belief behind the construction of stone-built pyramids is that ancestral spirits or hyangs are inhabited on mountains and high places
 punden berundak sopan-pyramid borobudur kii aadharbhoot banaavat ko mahayan buddha vichaaron or pratikon ke saath nigamit pashaan parampara kaa vistaar mana jaataa he
 The three parts of the monument symbolically represent the three worlds
 ye teen lok kramshah kamdhaatu, rupadhatu or arupadhatu hai
 The ordinary intelligent life lives on one of these lower living standards in the world of desires
 jo log apni ichchhaaon par kaabo praapt kar lete hai wo pratham str se upar uth jate hai or us jagah pahunch jate hai jahaan se roopon ko dekh to sakate hai lekin unki ichha nahin hoti
 In the end, the perfect Buddha rises above the standard of practical reality and is considered the most basic and pure level
 isamen wo ruparahit nirvana ko praapt hote hai
 The upper form from the life cycle of the world where the enlightened soul does not engage with the worldly form, like emptiness, comes to complete emptiness or to exist on its own
 kamdhaatu ko aadhaar se nirupit kiya gaya he, rupadhatu ko paanch vargakar manjilon se or arupadhatu ko teen vrittakar manjilon tathaa vishaal shikhar stupa se nirupit kiya gaya he
 There are figurative differences in the architectural qualities of these three levels

 In Borobudur, mass worship is performed as a revolving pilgrimage

 In 1885, accidentally hidden structures in the base were discovered

 In addition to this, there are relief frames inscribed with children, in which the sculptor wrote some necessary instructions about the carvings
 vaastavik aadhaar ke upar jhaalardaar aadhaar bana hua he jiskaa uddeshy aaj bhi rahasy bana hua he
 According to initial ideas, in the event of catastrophic subsidence in the hill, the actual base is to be covered
 anya maton ke anusaar jhaalardaar aadhaar banane kaa kaaran nagar niyojan or sthapaty ke bare main pracheen bhartiya pustak vaastu shaastra ke anusaar chupe huye mul aadhaar main banaavat dosha hona he
 Despite this, since its construction had started, the fringed base was constructed with full attention to full beauty and religious views

 This modular design allows a business to add or change modules, while maintaining data integrity, in a shared database that can be centralized or distributed
 ] The ERP initials originated as an extension of MRP and CIM
 anusandhan evam vishleshan form gartner dwaara 1990 main isko prachlit kiya gaya tha
 ERP systems now try to cover all the core functions of the enterprise, whatever the organization's business or manifesto
 in pranaaliyon ko ab gaiyr-utpaadan vyapaaron, gaiyr-laabh sanghathanon or sarkaron main paaya ja saktaa he
 To be called an ERP system, a software package must provide the functions of at least two systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek software package jo vetan or lekha, donon kaary pradaan karata ho use takneekee taur par ek ERP software package kaha ja saktaa he
 Examples of modules in an ERP that previously used to be independent applications include: product life-cycle management, supply chain management, warehouse management, customer relationship management, sales order processing, online sales, financial, human resources, and decision support system
 kuch sanghathan - aamtaur par ve jinke paas software utpaadon ko ekikrut karne ke liye paryaapt aatanrik iti kshamta he- ERP pranali ke keval kuch hisson ko lagu karne kaa chayan karte hai or apni anya aplicoshan aavashyaktaaon ke liye ERP yaa swatantra pranaaliyon ke bahya antarafalak viksit karte hai
 For example, they may choose to use the human resource management system of one vendor and perform integration between systems themselves

 Ideally, ERP provides a single database containing all the data for software modules, including: graahakon, aapurtikartaaon or karmchaariyon ke liye data godaam or vibhinn swayan seva antarafalak abhigam niyantran - prakriya nishpaadan hetu praadhikaar staron ke aadhaar par upyogkarta visheshadhikaar anukulan - prakriya pravaah main vistaar, yoga or parivartan kii purti hetu The term enterprise resource planning is originally derived from manufacturing resource planning, which comes from material requirement planning
 MRP, ERP main tab parivartit hua jab "rootings" software vaastukala kaa ek pramukh hissaa ban gaya or ek company kii kshamta yojana gatividhi bhi maanak software gatividhiyon kaa ek hissaa ban gayi
 ERP systems typically manage a company's manufacturing, logistics, distribution, freight, shipping, invoicing and accounting
 ERP software kai vyavsaayik gatividhiyon jaise bikri, vipanan, vitaran, billing, utpaadan, maal prabandhan, gunvattta prabandhan or maanav sansaadhan prabandhan ke niyantran main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 The 1990s saw a huge increase in sales of ERP systems as companies faced the Y2K problem in their older systems
 kai companiyon ne is avasar kaa laabh uthaate hue apni puraani soochna pranaaliyon ko ERP pranaaliyon ke saath badal diya
 This sales boom led to a slowdown in 1999, by which time most companies had already implemented their Y2K solutions
 ERP ko aksar galat tareeke se back offis pranali samajha jaataa he, jo yah darshata he ki graahakon or aam janata kaa isse koi pratyaksh sarokaar nahin he
 This is compared with front office systems, such as customer relationship management systems that connect directly with customers, or e-business systems such as e-commerce, e-government, e-telecom and e-finance, or supplier relationships management systems

 Prior to ERP, software was developed according to business processes
 adhikansh ERP pranaaliyon kii jatilta or ERP karyanvayan main asafalataa ke nakaaratmak parinaamon ke kaaran, adhikansh vikritaon nen apane software main "sarvottam prathaon" ko shaamil kar liya he
 According to the seller, these "best practices" are the most efficient way for a specific business process in an integrated enterprise-wide system
 lugvigshaafen uniwarsity of aplide science ke ek adhyayan ne 192 companiyon kaa surveykshan kiya or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki jin companiyon ne udyog jagat kii sarvshereshth prathaon ko lagu kiya he unamem concigareshan, pralekhan, pareekshan or prashikshan jaise mahatvapurn pariyojna kaaryon main kami aayi he
 In addition, the use of best practices reduced risk by more than 71% compared to other software
 sarvottam prathaon kaa upyog IFRS, sarbence-oxle yaa besel II jaisi aavashyaktaaon ke anupaalan ko aasaan banaata he
 They can also help where the process is an object like electronic money transfer
 aisa isliye hai kyonki vidhaayi or camodity saamagree ko pakadaney or report karne kii prakriya ko ERP software ke andar aasaani se kodit kiya ja saktaa he or tatpashchaat vishwaas ke saath unhen un tamaam vyavsaayon main doharaaya ja saktaa he jinaki vyavsaayik aavashyaktaaen samaan hon
 All functional units of businesses have a wide scope of applications and processes; ERP software systems are produced that are typically complex and demand significant changes in the working practices of employees
 ERP software kaa kriyanvayan "aatanrik" kaushal ke liye aam taur par bahut jatil hota he, isliye yah vaanchhneeya bhi he or isaki salaah bhi di jaati he ki in pranaaliyon ko lagu karne hetu peshewar rup se prashikshit bahya salaahkaaron kii madad lee jaye
 yah aamtaur par laagat kam karne kaa sabase prabhavi tarika he
 There are three types of services that can be hired - counseling, adaptation and support
 The duration of implementing an ERP system depends on the size of the business, the number of modules, the extent of customization, the scope of change and the customer's willingness to assume ownership of the project
 ERP pranaliyaan anukhandit hoti hai, atah yah aavashyak nahin he ki inako ek hi baar main lagu kiya jaye
 inhen vibhinn staron yaa charnon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 a typical project requires approximately 14 months and around 150 consultants
 ek choti pariyojna ko 3-9 maheene ke bheetar yojanabaddh karke lagu kiya ja saktaa he; jabaki, ek bade, bahu-kshetreey or bahu-deshiy karyanvayan main varshon lag sakate hai
 The duration of the implementation depends very much on the desired amount of customization
 ERP pranaaliyon ke karyanvayan hetu companiyaan aksar ERP vikreta yaa tritiy-paksh paraamarsh companiyon kii sahaayta leti hai
 These companies typically provide professional services in three areas: consulting, customization and support
 Customer organizations can employ independent program management, business analysis, change management and UAT specialists to ensure that their business needs remain a priority during implementation
 ek ERP karyanvayan kii safalataa kaa nirdhaaran karne main data sthanantaran sabase mahatvapurn gatividhiyon main se ek he
 As many important decisions are taken before transfer, it becomes necessary to proceed in a very planned manner
 durbhagyavash, data pravaas ek ERP karyanvayan ke utpaadan charan se pehle kii aakhri gatividhi hoti he, atah samay kii kami ke kaaran isapar bahut kam dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The following steps of data migration strategies can be helpful for the success of an ERP implementation: ERP vikritaon ne apni pranaaliyon ko maanak vyapaar prakriyaaon ke anusaar dizin kiya he, sarvottam vyavsaayik paddatiyon ke aadhaar par
 alag vikritaon kii prakriyaayein alag prakaar kii hoti hai lekin ve sabhi ek maanak, anukhandit prakruti kaa hi anusaran karti hai
 As a result, companies that want to implement ERP systems are forced to adapt their organizations to standard procedures rather than customizing ERP packages according to their existing processes
 ERP karyanvayan shuru karne se pehle vartmaan vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa banane kii upeksha, ERP pariyojnaon kii vifaltaa kaa ek mukhya kaaran he
 It is therefore important that organizations do a thorough analysis of business processes before selecting and implementing an ERP vendor
 is vishleshan dwaara maujuuda sabhi vyavsaayik prakriyaaon kaa nakshaa taiyaar karnaa chahie, taaki aise ERP vikreta kaa chayan kiya ja sake jiske maanak anukhand sthapit sanghathan ke saath sarvaadhik nikatataa se jude hon
 adhik prakriyaatmak ekikaran praapt karne ke liye tab ridizin kaa karyanvayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Research indicates that the risk of mismatch in business processes can be reduced by: ERP karyanvayan un sanghathanon main adhik dushkar hota he jahaan lagbhag swatantra vyavsaayik ikaiyaan hoti hai, prayek ikai apane nafe nuksaan ke liye swayan jimmedaar hoti he, kyonki unamem se prayek kii alag prakriyaayein, vyapaar niyam, data shabdaarth-vigyaan, praadhikaar padanukram or nirnay centre hote hai
 Solutions include coordinating requirements by local change management professionals or, if this is not possible, federated implementation using loosely integrated examples that are specifically configured and / or adapted to meet local needs
 ERP kaa ek nuksaan aamtaur par yah bataaya jaataa he ki manakikrut ERP anukhandon ke saath mail khaane ke liye vyavsaayik prakriyaaon ke parivartan se pratispardhi shreshthata main kami aa sakati he
 Documented evidence exists where this actually happened, while other cases show that following ERP processes to the fullest can actually enhance sustainable competitive superiority
 ek ERP pranali kaa vinyas asal main keval in baton ke bich santulan baithaana hi he ki aap is pranali se kya kaam karwaanaa chaahate hai or yah pranali aapako kis prakaar kaam karne detii he
 Start with which modules to install, then integrate the system using configuration tables to make the best possible adjustments with your company's processes
 anukhand- zyaadaatar pranaliyaan maatr isliye anukhandit hoti hai taaki kuch prakaaryon ko karyanvit kiya ja sake, lekin anya nahin hoti hai
 Some common modules such as finance and accounting are adopted by almost all companies; While other modules such as human resource management are not required by companies, they are not adopted
 udhaaharan ke liye ek seva pradaan karne vaali company ko sambhawatah nirmaan anukhand kii aavashyaktaa nahin padegi
 kai baar companiyaan kisi anukhand ko isliye nahin apanaatin kyonki unke paas swayan kii pranali maujuud he jo unki najar main behatar he
 In general, the more modules selected, the more the integration benefit will increase, but at the same time the cost, risk and related changes will also increase
 vinyas talikaay- ek vinyas talika company ko is pranali ke kisi vishisht pahalu ko apane chaynit vyavsaay ke tareeke ke anusaar dhaalane main sakasham banaati he
 For example, an organization may choose the type of inventory accounting - FIFO or LIFO -, or by whom it wants to identify revenue - geographic unit, product, or distribution channel
 What happens when the options provided by the system are not appropriate? In such a situation, the company has two options, but both are not ideal
 vah udhyam pranali kooton ko punah likh sakati he, yaa maujuuda pranali kaa istemaal karti rahe or iske tathaa nayi udhyam pranali ke bich anuphaalak banaaye
 Both options will increase the cost and time of the implementation process
 In addition they can also reduce the importance of integration benefits of this system
 pranali ke anukulan kii maatra jitna zyada hoga, aapurtikartaaon or graahakon ke bich sanchaar kii sahajata utani hi kam hoti jaayegi
 Many organizations did not have sufficient internal skills to implement an ERP project
 iske parinamswaroop kai sanghathan ERP karyanvayan ke liye paraamarsh sevaayen pradaan karne lage
 Typically, a consulting team was responsible for the entire ERP implementation, including planning, training, testing, implementation, and delivery of customized modules
 Examples of customization include additional product training; Creating process promoters and workflows; Expert advice on how to use ERP in business; System optimization; And aid writing reports, complex data findings or business intelligence implementation
 adhikansh madhyam aakaar vaali companiyon ke liye karyanvayan kii laagat, ERP upyogkarta license kii likhit keemat se lekar uske dogune tak ho sakati he

 Unlike most single-purpose applications, ERP packages include full source code from the beginning and are shipped with vendor-supported team ides for customization and expansion of illumination code
 ERP ke praarambhik varshon ke dauraan, jab ek sambhavit graahak swayan ke anuthe samaadhaan kaa aatanrik rup se vikaas karne par vichaar kar rahaa hota tha, yaa "sarvshereshth nasl" ke kai aplications ke ekikaran dwaara prakaarya-vyapee samaadhaan ko ekatra kar rahaa hota tha, us vakt paripakv upkarnon kii guarantee or vyapak anukulan ke liye sahaayta ek mahatvapurn bikri tark hua karata tha
 ERP vendors have tried to reduce customization requirements by providing pre-existing "configuration" features to meet the need for customers to change how the core system works as soon as they exit the packing box
 anukulan or vinyas ke bich mukhya antaron main shaamil hai: According to this analysis, simulating an ERP package can be unexpectedly expensive and complex, and may delay the realization of the obvious benefits of an integration system
 tathaapi, ek ERP suut kaa anurupan, vishisht kshetron main utkrushtataa ke liye gupt takneekon ko lagu karne kii gunjaaish pradaan karata he, saath hi yah sunishchit karata he ki kam samvedansheel kshetron main udyog jagat kii sarvottam prathaon ko lagu kiya ja sake
 In this context, "expansion" refers to the means by which the evoked ERP environment can be extended by third-party programs

 In the absence of an ERP system, a large manufacturer may have multiple software applications that are unable to communicate or interface effectively with each other
