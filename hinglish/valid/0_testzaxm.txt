 unke anek putron main se sabase chote tribhuvan swayambhu the, jinhone kavi ke ukt donon kaavyon ko unki mrityu ke baad apni rachana dwaara puraa kiya tha
 In addition to Bharata, Pingal, Bhamah and Dandi, the poet also mentions the arrows and Harsha at the beginning of his Rittimichariu, which proves his period after the middle of the seventh century AD
 swayambhu kaa ullekh pushpadant ne apane mahapurana main kiya he, jo i

 Therefore, the creation time of Swayambhu is proved within these two limits

 The first two of these compositions are poetic and the third Prakrit-apabhramsa is scholarly

 sandhya sanskaar sampann karne ke pashchaat ram ek bhramar, joki unke man kaa hi prakatikaran he, kaa sita ke liye doot ke rup main chayan karte hai
 Rama asks Bhunare to undertake a pilgrimage to the sacred land of India before departing the journey to Lanka because the pilgrimage to this holy place frees the creature from all sins
 ve bhunre se sarvapratham mithila jane kii liye kehete hai, jisase ki vah sita ke liye unki janmabhumi ke kuch raj kan le ja sake
 After visiting all the people and places of Mithila related to the events of the Balakanda of Ramayana and presented with very liveliness, the bumblebee is ordered to see all the rivers, ashrams and forests in the path of Ayodhya, which the poet has detailed
 It is described as charming
 75 shlokon main ayodhya ke vibhinn sthalon or vyaktiyon kaa sundar varnan prastut he or bhunre se un sabhi ko pranaam karne ko kaha jaataa he
 Then after seeing Bharata and Shatrughna meditating in Nandigram along with his wives, Bhanure is said to fly on the path of Rama's Chitrakoot Yatra described in Ayodhya Kand
 path par sthit guha kaa shrangaverpur rajya, prayagraj main ganga, yamuna evam saraswati nadiyon kaa sangam tathaa ant main chitrakoot –in sabhi romantic sthalon kaa kavi atyant gahanta se chittkarshak varnan karte hai
 The predecessor ends with Rama ordering the bumblebee to depart southward from Chitrakoot
 uttarabrung ke praarambhik bhaag main aranyakand kii ghatnaon se sambandhit sthal varnit hai
 Along with the directions given by Ram to the bumblebee for his journey, the poet walks the stories of Ramayana in the heart of the readers by drawing beautiful and in order
 sarvapratham un rishiyon ke ashramon kii manoram jhaanki kavi ne prastut kii he, jinase sita, ram or lakshmana ne bhent kii thi
 Subsequently, Bhanure is sent to the banks of the Godavari river flowing where Ram lived in the Panchavati along with Sita and Lakshmana
 phir bhunre ko jataayu kii mukti or shramana ke ashram ke pavitra sthalon kaa darshan karne kaa aadesh diya jaataa he

 ram dwaara bhunre ke madhyam se sita ko sampreshit sandesh uttarabrung ke 71wein shloke se prarambh hota he
 This message first presents the compassionate situation arising in the disconnection of Sita of Rama and then communicates Rama's valiant and assured utterances to Sita for life, until Hanuman brings another message and ring from Rama to Lanka
 
 ram kaa sandesh uttarabrung ke 244 shloke tak he or kavy chah or shlokon ke pashchaat samaapt hota he

 In English, the satellite calls the ring "planatory ring" because it often forms around planets, but in scientific terms it can also be built around satellites and other objects
 vaigyanik rup se yah ek challa he jo upgrah kii tarah kisi grah yaa anya upgrah kii parikrama karata he
 Scientists believe that there may be three reasons for becoming a satellite ring - kisi jamaane main sochaa jaataa tha ke upgrahi challe sthai nahin ho sakate or karodon saal ke antaraal main dhire-dhire bikhar jate hai yaa phir judakar ek upgrah bana lete hai
 Conversely, close study of Saturn's rings has revealed that its rings have been intact since the early days of the solar system, that is, they have been in existence for billions of years

 tii-series ke paas sangeet vitaran ke adhikaar hai
 a combination of art, science and technology of rational, intelligent construction of all types of places to satisfy human needs according to the time, technology and interest of buildings, design and design of buildings comes in the definition of architecture
 iskaa or bhi spashtakin kiya ja saktaa he
 Architecture has been and is a branch of fine arts, with the aim of taking the support of industrialization and constructing a good building in terms of utility, whose environment is highly cherished, cherished and cherished and cherished for the cultured and artistic interest
 prakruti, buddhi evam ruchi dwaara nirdhaarit or niyamit katipay siddhanton or anupaaton ke anusaar rachana karnaa is kala kaa sambhddha ang he
 Such a configuration of maps and objects and enriching the structure in the most appropriate way, which creates a lot of interestingness, beauty, greatness, unity and power with maximum features
 praarambhik avasthaaon main, athwa swalpasiddhi ke saath, vaastukala kaa sthaan maanav ke simit prayojanon ke liye aavashyak peshon, yaa vyavsaayon main-praaia: manushya ke liye kisi prakaar kaa rakshasthaan pradaan karne ke liye hota he
 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 Nagraj Raj Comics offering, is an Indian comic book character that can be called a long-lived Indian action comic superhero
 1980 dashak ke ant main sanjay gupta dwaara srujit, nagaraj apane 25 varsh ke jivan kaal main rup-rang or saath hi kahani, donon tarah se bahut badal gaya he
 Despite the fact that comic culture almost disappeared in India at one point of time, its fan base grew and it is expected to grow significantly after the release of his first animated film
 nagaraj kaa sarvapratham ank suprasiddh lekhak parashuram sharma dwaara likhaa gaya tha or ise pratap malik ne chitrit kiya tha
 Malik successfully portrayed the character for around 50 points until 1995
 1995 ke baad se, chithran kaa kaam chitrakaar or lekhak anupam sinha ne sambhaal liya
 Whatever Nagraj is today, it is because of these Indian comic industry stalwarts Pratap Malik and Anupam Sinha
 nagaraj kaa charitra puranic ichhadhari naag, aitihaasik vishaiylla maanav se prerit mana jaataa he
 Her stories have a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic and science fiction
 nagaraj ke kai prashansakon kaa yah maananaa he ki samay ke saath nagaraj comics ne apana hi ek sarp puraana viksit kiya he jo janata ke bich sanpon ke bare main prachlit lokapriy bhartiya manyataon ke liye adwitiya he
 Nagaraja was originally conceived as an enemy of international terrorism
 dilachasp baat yah he ki apane pehle ank main nagaraj ko dusht vaigyanik profesar naagamani dwaara ek antarrashtriya aatankwaadi hathiyaar ke rup main pravartit kiya gaya tha
 Nagaraja was entrusted with the task of stealing the idol of the goddess from a temple protected by tribal devotees, snakes and the mysterious old monk named Gorakhnath Baba, over 300 years old, in this first mission
 nagaraj apane kaary main safal rahaa, lekin gorakhnath or unke rahasyamay kaale nevale shikangi se muqaabale main parrast ho gaya
 Gorakhnath read his mind and discovers that Professor Nagamani has implanted a mind control device in the form of a capsule in his head to keep Nagaraja under his control
 gorakhnath ne shalya-chikitsa kii or nagaraj ke sir se capsule ko hataa diya, jisase nagaraj profesar naagamani ke niyantran se mukt ho gaya
 After this Nagraj became a disciple of Baba Gorakhnath and he vowed to eliminate crime and terrorism from the earth
 Since then Nagraj has visited the world thrice and defeated many villains and terrorists
 samprati nagaraj ek kaalpanik shahar mahanagar main apane hi gopneey swaamitv vaale tii
ve
 channel ke karmchaaree raaj ke rup main jivan yaapan kar rahaa he
 In ancient times, when the gods roamed the earth without any restrictions, there existed an empire called Takshaknagar, which was ruled by King Taksharaj and Queen Lalita
 shaasha danpati ko koi chintaa nahin thi sivaay ek ke; unki koi santan nahin thi
 The absence of a prince or princess made the sole Nagpash his potential heir
 Nagpash was the identical younger brother of the emperor, who began to live a grand life without knowing that he was the only possible heir to the throne
 jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya, rani apane bachche ke abhaav main udhaas rahane lagi
 raja ko rani ke avsaad kaa kaaran samaj main aa gaya or ve bhi pareshaan rahane lage
 pati-patni ashish ke liye apane paariwarik devtaa dev kaaljayi kii puja karte the
 Dev Kalajayi also knew the reason for his grief, so one day he blessed him to have great children
 unka aashirwad safal hua or jald hi rani garbhvatee ho gai or puure rajya main kushi kii lahar daud gai sivaay nagapasha ke
 The birth of this child meant losing the throne to him, so he decided to kill the child before it was born
 ek din jab rani dev kaaljayi kii puja ke liye ja rahi thi, to nagapasha ne devtaa ke bhoga kii dhaki hui thali main, prasad ko mare hue nevale se badal diya
 Nagadevata felt angry and made the queen unconscious with her venomous breath
 raja ne devtaa se kshamaa yachana kii or apni patni ko thik karne kii prarthana kii lekin devtaa ne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad hataash raaj ne aatmahatya karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Unable to withstand the death of the devotee, Dev Kalajayi told him a way to save the life of the queen
 He gave the gem to the king and asked him to react with the queen's medicine
 Mani will reverse all the poison from the queen's body towards the child's body, but due to the ill effects of the poison, the queen will lose her fertility
 saare rajya main matam chaa gaya or raja bhi dukhi ho gaye
 Nagpash was very happy that he has survived as the heir alone
 jab baccha paidaa hua to sabko laga ki vah mara hua he kyonki uskaa sara sharir nila tha or usamen jivan ke koi lakshan dikhaai nahin die
 According to the practice of the Hindus, the newborn was thrown into the river
 nagapasha kushi se jhum uthaa or sidhe nashe main dhut dev kaaljayi ke paas gaya or unase yah kehete hue shahi khajaane ko saunpane ke liye kaha ki vah singhaasana kaa ekmaatr uttaradhikari he isliye shahi khajaane par uskaa adhikaar he
 Dev Kalajayi refused and told him that the "real heir" of the throne was alive and that the treasury would be handed over to him when the time came
 Enraged, Nagpash raised his sword against the deity but fell away with the mere stroke of a giant snake's tail
 Nagpash fell on two bowls, one containing a highly poisonous toxin, which destroyed his face and merged into his blood and the other contained nectar, which made him immortal
 donon ke ek saath prabhaav ne nagapasha ko ek amar vishaiylla aadmi bana diya
 At that time Nagpash could not bear the change of his body and fainted
 jab raja ko dev kaaljayi ne in ghatnaon ke bare main soochna di to unhen pataa chalaa ki unka betaa mara nahin he or unhen apane jivan ke prati sambhavit khataron kaa bhi ehsaas hua
 Therefore, he ordered his loyal astrologer Vedacharya, a great scholar of Tilism, to preserve the treasure in a Tilism that only his son could break
 Vedacharya prepared Tilism with the help of Dev Kalajayi to ensure that no one of the king's sons, except Amar Nagpash, would be able to break that tilism
 When Nagpash regained consciousness, he realized that he had lost the treasure
 gusse main aakar usne raja or rani kii hatya kar di
 In a life-less condition, the infant got trapped in bushes flowing in the river
 vahaan par vah lambey samay tak padaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, the serpent god Dev Kalajayi Chirayu appeared in the dreams of the wishful serpent ruler King Maniraj and his wife Manika Rani, who were living in a human view hiding in an island in the Indian Ocean called Ojhal Nagadweep
 unhone shishu kaa sthaan bataaya or unase uskaa ilaaj karne ke liye kaha
 unhone kahe anusaar kiya tathaa shishu ko found nikaala or unhen yah bhi pataa chalaa ki vah dweep ke mahaan sarp mahatma kaldoot se bhi zyaada vishaiylla he, jo yah sanket detaa he ki uske paas bhagwaan kaa divya vish he
 Initially Raj Vaidya was unsure whether he would be able to treat the infant or not, but Dev Kalajayi himself had asked the king for treatment, so he was convinced that his treatment would be successful
 According to the rules, no one was allowed to bring any outsider to the island, so the king decided to keep his presence a secret
 kai saal biit gaye or ilaaj kaa parinaam nazar aane laga, haalanki abhi bhi usamen koi jivan-kriya nahin thi, par shishu kaa rang dhire-dhire hare main badalane laga
 raja ne yah samachar rani ko diya or unhone bachche ko god lene kaa nirnay liya kyonki unki apni koi santan nahin thi
 His decision was overheard by the evil Tantric Visandhara who wanted to become the ruler of the island, but was afraid of the Mahatma tenant
 usne gupt kshetra par hamalaa kiya jahaan shishu ko rakhaa gaya tha or usko saath lekar bhaag gaya, lekin ishwar ke prakope se dar kar us shishu ko na maarane kaa faisalaa liya or use nadi kii unheen jhaadiyon main waapas rakh diya jahaan par vah mila tha
 Her plan failed as the queen soon conceived and gave birth to a daughter, named Viserpi
 vishandhar ko kabhi pataa nahin chalaa ki jis shishu ko usne bhatakane ke liye chhod diya tha use hosh aa gaya, pehle uskaa cheharaa or phir uskaa sharir saamaanya maanvon jaisaa bana or usne ronaa shuru kiya
 a priest from a nearby temple saw him and presented him to Professor Nagamani, who was wandering in the nearby forest in search of snakes
 agyaat kaarnon se purohit ne ek juthi kahani sunai ki shishu ek aisi mahila kaa he jiskaa balaatkaar hua tha or jo sarp devtaa kii bhakthin thi or shishu ko ichhadhari naag banane kaa aashirwad praapt he or unhone naagamani se anurodh kiya ki ve uskaa paalan-poshan kuch is tarah kare ki vah apni maa kaa badla le sake
 Nagmani realized that the priests were lying but took the infant with him
 shishu ke rakt pareekshan se pataa chalaa ki uski shwet rakt koshikaon main koon kii jagah sookshm saanp hai
 The child had extraordinary curative powers and was highly toxic
 usne shishu kaa paalan-poshan kiya jo aage chalakar nagaraj bana
 Nagaraja was presented to the world as a creation of Nagmani Professor
 use vishisht hatyara mashin banaaya ja rahaa tha or uski mul yojana thi nagaraj ko duniya bhar ke khalnaayakon or aatankwaadi guton ke bich sabase adhik boli lagane vaale ko kiraye par dena
 Professor Nagmani used it for his other pilot projects and leasing it for international terrorism
 naagamani ne hameshaa daawa kiya ki nagaraj ko saanp ke vish ke ansh dekar, uskaa koon zehar banaate hue uski shaktiyon ko viksit kiya gaya he
 He claimed that his venom is the result of snake bites of 1000 different species and that his powers developed from treatment with the ashes of the dead willful serpent
 vastav main tathy yah tha ki nagaraj kisi bhi saanp kii prajati se zyaada zaharila tha, kyonki uskaa vish alokik tha
 Based largely on the sizing Hindu myth, Nagaraja was empowered by the subtle snakes in his blood cells and was subjected to venomous breath poisoning and biting, immediate healing powers, and ropes, parachutes or protruding from his wrist
 And according to his imagination, there are innumerable supernatural powers like snakes taking different shapes
 mana jaataa he ki agar vah kisi ko kaate yaa koi use kaate, to uske vish main potashium synide se bhi tikshn, kisi bhi jivit praani ke sharir ko galane kii shakti maujuud he
 For his first mission, he was sold for a million and the aim was to acquire an ancient statue
 nagaraj safal hota he, lekin phir sadhu "baba gorakhnath" use naakaam karte hai, jo uske man ko "profesar naagamani" ke niyantran se mukt karte hai
 Waking up in a new world of peace of Gorakhnath, Nagaraj vows to eliminate terrorism from the world and moves towards achieving his goal
 praarambhik ankon main nagaraj kii shaktiyaan bhi simit thim, kabhi-kabhi shaktishaalee maanav virodhiyon se bhi vah haar jaataa tha or asthai rup se behosh ho jaataa tha, uski taaqat bhi kaaphi had tak maanvon jaisi thi jaise vah kisi car uthaane vaale ko dekhakar apane virdohi kii shakti se achambhit ho jaataa tha
 Years later, Nagraj became so powerful that he not only held the falling cars alone but also threw things into outer space with ease
 yah ullekhneey he or shaayad vidambnaapurna bhi ki nagaraj ko ab ek puranic-jaadui praani ke rup main badal diya gaya he jise apane dushman ke rup main vilakshan jeevon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, jisamen jaadu-tona or samay or antariksh yatra ke tatv bhi jude hai
 Many see this as the reason for the continued, overwhelming popularity of Nagraj Comics
 haalanki, shuddhivaadiyon kaa ab bhi daawa he ki ve or adhik yathartwaadee or adhik vyaavhaarik kahaniyon ko pasand karte hai jinase nagaraj kii shuruuaat hui thi
 Nagraj is arguably the most powerful superhero of the royal world and the most powerful wishful serpent of his time
 Again and again, he has shown the ability to challenge Sheshnag, Vasukdev, the great serpent deities and defeated serpents like Kaladoot, Triphaana, Mahavayal and Sheetnag Kumar, who are counted among the most powerful serpents of their species
 apane praarambhik ankon main nagaraj ek ghumkkad tha, jo ek himaskhalan kii bhaanti maanav jati ke dushmano ke liye tabaahi machaa detaa tha
 Since there was no need for a disguised personality, Nagaraj did not have one, but he hid himself in an overcoat and often with a hat to hide his identity
 apni asli pahchaan chhipaane ke liye jis poshaak kaa vah istemaal karata tha, uske prashansakon dwaara use hi chhadam bhes kaa naam diya gaya kyonki aksar kisi ko pataa nahin chalata tha ki uske samaksh khadey rahane vaale vyakti swayan nagaraj he
 Nagraj has adopted the same pseudo-personality in his latest global terrorism series

 DNA fingerprinting technology is used to solve the criminal cases
 iske saath hi maatrutiv, pitrutv yaa vyaktigat pahchaan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 At present, fingerprint is considered the best among methods of identification
 jeev jantuon, manushyon main vishesh sanrachanayukta vah rasayan jo use vishisht pahchaan pradaan karata he, use diene kehete hai
 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA
 sharir ke kuch hisson main inaki sankhya alag-alag hoti he
 The activity of the trillions of cells present in the body is determined by DNA
 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species
 is prakriya ko genetic fingerprinting or diene profiling bhi kaha jaataa he
 It was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, scientist at the University of British Leicester
 forencik vigyaan main diene fingerprint kaa upyog hota he
 Forensic examination no longer requires actual fingerprint
 isaki madad se apradhi ko maatr ek boond ke aadhaar par hi pakadaa ja saktaa he
 The DNA sample is fragmented by the DNA enzyme taken

 Inhalation of small droplets containing the virus by inhalation or by mouth or by contact with infected nasal mucus or infected objects
 inamen se koun sa kaaran zukaam ke prasar ke liye uttaradaayi he, iskaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 These viruses can survive in the environment for a long time
 iske baad virus haathon se naak athwa aankhon main prasaarit ho jaataa he, jahaan sankraman ho jaataa he
 People sitting next to each other are at higher risk of becoming infected
 rog pratirohak kshamta kii kami vaale tathaa aksar kharaab saaf-safai vaale bacchon main aapasi nazadiiki ke kaaran dainik dekhbhaal kendron athwa skulon sankraman aam hota he
 Subsequently, the infection passes from children to other family members
 vayuyan main vyavsaayik udaan ke dauraan punahparichaalit vaayu ke prayog se zukaam ke prasar hone kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin he
 The infection is most likely to spread during the first three days of a cold caused by rhinovirus
 iske pashchaat sankraman failane kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 The traditional theory is that the cold is caused by living in cold weather for a long time, such as in rainy or winter, and that is why this disease is also given this name
 yah vivadaspad he ki sharir ke shitalan se bhi saamaanya zukaam hone kaa khatra hota he yaa nahin
 Some viruses that cause common cold are seasonal and have a higher frequency during cold or wet weather
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah mukhyatya adhik samay tak ghar ke andar or sankramit vyakti ke nikat rahane se hota he; vishesh rup se ve bachche jo skool waapas lautate hai haalanki, yah shwasan pranali main hone vaale parivartanon se bhi sambandhit ho saktaa he, jinke falswaroop halake-phulke sankraman ho jate hai
 Due to low humidity, it can increase its rate of spread because in dry air, small droplets spread easily and they stay in the air for longer time and go far
 samooh pratiraksha use kehete hai jab koi samooh ek vishesh sankraman ke prati pratirakshit ho jaataa he or aisa purv main zukam ke vishaanuon ke sampark main aa chuke hone ke kaaran hota he
 Thus the rate of respiratory infection is higher in the younger population and its rate is lower in the older population
 kamazor pratiraksha pranali bhi is beemaari ke liye ek khatra he
 Lack of sleep and malnutrition are also considered a risk against this infection, which subsequently increases the risk of rhinovirus
 yah mana jaataa he ki aisa pratiraksha pranali par inke prabhaav ke kaaran hota he
 Common cold symptoms are generally considered to be the immune system's response to the virus
 is pratiraksha pratikriya kii prakriya vishaanu vishisht hoti he
 For example, rhinovirus is usually acquired by direct contact
 yah ICAM-1 maanav abhigrahakon se agyaat vidhi se jud jaataa he or uttejk madhyasthon ke srav ko sakriy karata he
 Causing these inflammatory mediators
 aamtaur par yah nasika ke apithalium ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaata he
 In contrast, the respiratory syncytial virus is acquired by both direct contact and airborne droplets
 iske pashchaat nichali shwasananalika main adhik failane se purv yah naak or gale main pratikrutiyaan banaata he
 RSV damages the epithelium
 human parinfluenza virus aamtaur par naak, gale or vayumarg main jalan paidaa karte hai
 In young children, affecting the trachea can also result in a throat disease, which causes dry cough and difficulty in breathing
 aisa bacchon ke vayumarg ke chote aakaar ke kaaran hota he
 The difference between upper respiratory tract infections depends mostly on where the symptoms appear
