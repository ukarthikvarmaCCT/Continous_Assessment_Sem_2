 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow
 vidyudvishleshan hone par jo aluminium dhaatu banati he vah cryolite se baari hoti he, at: cell main neeche baith jaati he
 This metal acts as a minus

 Meanwhile, Sri Rama asked Trikuta to stay meditated in a cave located in the Trikuta range of the Manik hills in North India

 Person-centered sophistry refers to a false argument in which an attempt is made to disprove the inherent truth of a claim by diverting attention to the character, ideology or any other quality of that claimant
 udhaaharan ke liye yah kahana ki 'verma sahab ne jo bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya he usapar dhyaan nahin dena chahie kyonki vah ko hameshaa apni patni se jhagadate rahete hai' ek vyakti-kendrit kutark he kyonki vermaji kii vyaktigat samasyaon kaa bhrashtachar kaa ilzaam sach yaa jhooth hone se koi sambandh nahin
 In such sophistry, sometimes an attempt to make a claim true is also made on the basis of the qualities of its caller
 masalan kisi sabun ke vigyaapan main agar koi mashhoor film abhinayta aaye to yah kutark prastut kiya ja rahaa hota he ki 'aapako agar yah abhinayta pasand he to aapako yah sabun bhi pasand aayega', haalanki sabun kaa abhinayta se koi vishesh sambandh nahin hota
 There are many types of person-centered sophistication, some of which are narrated below

 Often the flaw in the character of the opposition is true, but it has nothing to do with the argument presented by the opposition

 It is said that the speaker is giving an argument because of his circumstances
 yah ek mithyaa tark he kyonki kisi kaa apni paristhitivash koi tark dena chaahana us tark ko galat nahin sabit karata: In the 'tum bhi' type of sophistry, the argument of the opposition is said to weaken that it does not follow its own logic
 is se yah to sabit ho saktaa he ki vipakshi paakhandee he lekin is se uskaa tark galat sabit nahin hota: In this, an illegal attempt is made to weaken the opposition's argument that any other person or group that is considered bad also says the same
 udhaaharan: Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 a conscript triplet is a six-digit, three-byte plot number, used in HTML to display colors
 teenon bite darshaati hai kisi ek rang ke laal, haraa, nila ghatak
 a byte is from 00 to FF, or 0 to 255
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows : These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in the 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F, BC, 8B
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 Template: Color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
 The lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%
 are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: bangnee rang ek sabji bangan ke naam par rakhaa hua naam he
 In English it is called Violet, which is named after the flower of the same name

 There were lush green plains on the island
 jameen bahut upjau thi
 There were a large number of animals and birds, and there were also fruit orchards

 Thus governance was also ideal

 They massacred large areas and captured other areas
 ve keval athens se paar nahin paa sake the God's punishment: According to Plato, God also punished the Atlantis for this work
 yah sajaa tufaan, baadh, bhukamp or jwalamukhi ke rup main hoti thi
