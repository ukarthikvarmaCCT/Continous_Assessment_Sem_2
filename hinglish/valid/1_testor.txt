 The spreadsheet concept became widely known in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to the implementation of visicalc by Dan Bricklin and Bob Franxton

 PC world magazine ne visicalc ko pratham electronic spredshit kaha
 Bricklin asked to see his university professor draw a table of calculation results on a blackboard
 When the professor found an error, he had to painstakingly rewrite the order, erasing several entries in the table that prompted Bricklin to think he could repeat the process on a computer, where the underlying formula had He can use the blackboard as a model to visualize the result

 visicalc became the first "killer app", an application that was so compelling, that people started buying specific computers to achieve it
 In this case the computer was Apple II and visicalc contributed significantly to the success of that machine
 Sent to early computers, specifically CP / m machines, the Atari 8-bit family, and various Commodore platforms
 Nevertheless, visicalc is more commonly known as "an Apple II program"

 Spreadsheet 2000 attempted to dramatically simplify formulation, but was generally not successful
 ek "khaane" ko ek box ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisamen ek aankada hota he
 a single field is usually referred to by its column and row
 To change its shape according to the material, usually its length or width can be done by dragging the lines along the box
 khaanon kii vyuh rachana ko "shit" yaa "kaaryapatrak" kaha jaataa he
 In traditional computer programs, this corresponds to an array of variables
 In most experiments, multiple worksheets can be placed within a single spreadsheet
 ek kaaryapatrak, bas ek spredshit kaa upkhand he jise spashtataa ke liye vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Functionally, a spreadsheet operates in its entirety and all fields within the spreadsheet operate as global variables
 ek cell main ek maan yaa ek sutara ho saktaa he yaa ise bas khaali bhi chhod sakate hai
 According to the tradition, formulas usually begin with = sign
 ek maan ko computer keyboard se darj kiya ja saktaa he yaa sidhe ek khaane main tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Alternatively, a value may be based on a formula that can perform a calculation, show the current date or time, obtain an external data such as a stock quote or database value

 kuch aarambhik spredshits main dubaara gananaa ke liye hastchalit anurodh aavashyak tha, kyonki badi yaa jatil spredshit kii gananaa, aksar data pravishti gati ko kam kar detii thi
 Many modern spreadsheets still retain this option
 is suvidha ke liye ek cell kii saamagree ko samay-samay par adhyatan karnaa hota he, jab iske maan ko ek bahari strot se liya jaataa he - jaise ek anya "sudur" spredshit main ek khaanaa
 saajha or web-aadhaarit spredshit ke liye, yah "tatkaal" adhyatan khaane par lagu hota he jise kisi anya upyogkarta dwaara badla gaya he
 All dependent mines also have to be updated
 ek baar pravesh kar die jane ke baad, chaynit khaane ko aakasmik punarlekhan se bachaane ke liye vaikalpik rup se "band" kiya ja saktaa he
 This generally applies to mines that contain formulas, but may also apply to those containing "constants" such as a kilogram / pound conversion factor
 Despite the individual fields being marked off, spreadsheet data is not protected until this feature is activated in the file preferences
 ek khaane yaa shrenee ko vaikalpik rup se yah nirdisht karne ke liye paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki maan kaise pradarshit hoga
 difolt disple formet aamtaur par isaki aarambhik saamagree dwaara nirdhaarit hota he, yadi ise vishesh rup se pehle se nirdhaarit nahin kiya gaya he, isliye udhaaharan ke liye "31 / 12 / 2007" yaa "31 janvari 2007" ke liye khaane ke "taarikh" formet ke difolt hota he
 Similarly, adding a% signal after a numeric value will tag that field as a percentage cell format
 The contents of the field will not change with this format, only the displayed value will change
 khaane ke kuch formet jaise ki "sankhyatmak" yaa "mudra" bhi dashamalav sthaan kii sankhya ko nirdisht kar sakate hai
 " isse avaidh sanchaalan kii anumati mil sakati, jisase bina kisi uchit chetavanee ke visangat parinaam falit hote hai
 Depending on the capacity of the spreadsheet application, each cell can be formatted separately for which either the material can be used or the cell
 To increase the readability of a spreadsheet, cell formatting can be applied to conditional data - for example, a negative number can be displayed in red
 ek kaksh kaa swarupan aam taur par isaki saamagree ko prabhavit nahin karata or is baat par nirbhar karte hue ki kakshon ko anya kaaryapatrak yaa anuprayogon par kaise sandarbhit yaa copy kiya gaya he, swarupan ko saamagree ke saath kiya or nahin bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 In most experiments, a cell, or a group of cells in a column or row, can be "named" enabling the user to refer to that cell by name instead of a grid reference
 spredshit ke bheetar naam adwitiya hone chahie, lekin jab ek spredshit fil main kai shit kaa prayog ho to prayek shit par ek samaan namit kaksh shrenee kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he agar ise shit naam jod kar pahachaanaa jaataa he
 One reason for this experiment is the creation or operation of macros that replicate an order across multiple sheets
 ek anya kaaran yah he ki namit charon vaale sutron ko unke dwaara lagu kiye jane vaale bijganit ke khilaaf tatparta se jaancha jaataa he 
 namit charon or namit kriyaaon kaa prayog, spredshit sanrachana ko adhik paardarshee bhi banaata he
 In place of a named cell, an alternative approach is to use cell references
 Most cell references refer to another cell in the same spreadsheet, but a cell reference can refer to a different cell within the same spreadsheet, or to a cell entirely in another spreadsheet, or from a remote application
 To any value
 "A1" style main ek theth kaksh sandarbh, stambh kii pahchaan karne ke liye ek yaa do cese-sensitive aksharon se bana hota he jiske baad pankti kii sankhya aati he 
 donon main se koi bhi hissaa saapeksh ho saktaa he, yaa nirpeksh 
 vaikalpik "R1C1" sandarbh style r akshar, pankti sankhya, c akshar or stambh sankhya se bani hoti he; saapeksh pankti yaa stambh sankhya ko varg koshthak main sankhya ko gher kar ingit kiya jaataa he
 Most recent spreadsheets use the A1 style, with some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option
 jab computer ek kaksh main us kaksh ke pradarshit maan ko adhyatan karne ke liye koi sutara pariklit karata he to anya kaksh ko namit karne vaale us kaksh main kaksh sandarbh, computer ko namit kaksh ke maan ko laane ke liye prerit karte hai
 a cell in the same "sheet" is usually addressed as: - ek samaan spredshit ke ek alag shit par ek kaksh ko aamtaur par is rup main sambodhit kiya jaataa he: - Some spreadsheet implementations allow a cell reference in another spreadsheet on the same computer or on a local network
 It can refer to a cell in another open and active spreadsheet on the same computer or network that is defined as shareable
 in sandarbhon main puraa fil naam hota he, jaise: - In a spreadsheet, references to cells are automatically renewed when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted
 lekin ek pankti ko ek stambh yoga ke saamne jodate samay khaas saavdhaanee baratani chahie taaki yah sunishchit ho ki yoga main atirikt panktiyon kaa mulya pradarshit ho rahaa he - jo aksar nahin hota he! a circular reference occurs when a cell's formula contains a reference that directly or indirectly, through a series of references, each cell points to another cell that has a reference to the next cell on the chain
 - indicates a cell
 trutiyon ke kai aam prakaar is tarah ke vrittiya sandarbh ko prerit karte hai
 However, there are some valid techniques that are using such circular references
 aisi takneekein, spredshit kii kai punarganana ke baad un kakshon ke liye sahi mulyon par abhisaran karti hai
 Similarly, instead of using a named range of cells, a range reference can be used
 kakshon kii kisi shrenee ke liye sandarbh, farm ke liye aam he jo A6 ke madhyam se A1 shrenee main sabhi kakshon ko nirdisht karata he
 a formula like "= SUM" can join all the specified cells and place the result in the cell containing the formula itself
 aarambhik spredshit main, kaksh ek saral do aiami grid the
 Over time, the model also expanded to include a third dimension and in some cases a series of named grids, called sheets
 sabase unnat udhaaharan aavartan or vyutkram sanchalanon kii anumati data he jo data set ko vibhinn tareekon se chhaant kar prastut kar saktaa he
 a formula identifies the calculation that is needed to place the result in the cell in which it is contained
 ek sutara vaale kaksh ke pradarshan main isliye do ghatak hai; swayan vah sutara or parinamswaroop mulya
 vah sutara saamaanya rup se tabhi dikhaaya jaataa he jab us kaksh ko mouse dwaara "clic" karke ek vishesh kaksh ko chunaa jaataa he, anyathaa yah gananaa ke parinaam ko shaamil rakhata he
 a formula returns a value for a cell or series of cells, and is typically of the form: jahaan abhivyakti main shaamil hai: When a cell contains a formula, it often includes a reference to other cells
 is tarah kaa ek kaksh sandarbh char kaa ek prakaar he
 Its value is the value of the referenced cell or any derivative of it
 yadi vah kaksh badale main kisi anya kaksh ko sandarbhit karata he, to maan unke maan par nirbhar karata he
 The reference can be relative, absolute or mixed row-wise or column-wise absolute / relative
 maanya sutron ke liye uplabdh vikalp, vishesh spredshit karyanvayan par nirbhar karata he lekin, saamaanya rup main, adhikansh ankaganitiya sankriyaayein or kaaphi jatil nested sashart sankriyaayein, aaj kii adhikansh vanijyik spredshits dwaara nishpadit kii ja sakati hai
 Modern implementations also offer operations for accessing custom-built actions, remote data, and applications
 ek sutara main ek shart shaamil ho sakati he - vaastavik pariklan ke bina yaa saath main - or iskaa kabhi-kabhi puri tarah se istemaal trutiyon ko ujagar karne or pahchaan karne main hota he
 In the example below, it is assumed that the sum of the column of percentages is tested for validity and a clear message is inserted into the adjacent right-hand cell
 ek spredshit ko kisi sutara ko dhaaran karne kii zarurat nahin hoti or us maamle main use panktiyon or stambhon main vyavasthit mahaj data kaa ek sangrah mana jayega jaise ki ek, calendar, samay saarini, yaa saral suchi
 upyog main isaki aasaani, swarupan or hiserlinking kshamtaaon ke kaaran kai spredshits ko keval isi uddeshy ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Spreadsheets usually include many supplied functions, such as arithmetic operations trigonometry operations, statistical functions, and so on
 In addition there is often a provision for user-defined actions
 microsoft dhaksal main in kaaryon ko pradaan kiye gaye Visual Basic editor main Visual Basic ke prayog se paribhaashit kiya gaya he or aisi kriyaayein kaaryapatrak par swatah hi abhigam yogya hai
 Additionally, a program can be written that draws information from the worksheet, performs some calculations and reports the results back to the worksheet
 In the figure, the name sq is user-provided and the verb sq is introduced using the Visual Basic provided with Excel
 nem manager, namit char x or y kii spredshit paribhaashaon ko pradarshit karata he
 Verbs cannot write themselves to the worksheet, but only return their evaluation
 haalanki, microsoft dhaksal main, sabaroutine, sabaroutine main paae jane vaale maan yaa text ko sidhe spredshit par likh saktaa he
 This figure represents the Visual Basic code for a subroutine in which the named column variable is the name of each member of x, calculates its class and writes that value to the corresponding element of the named column variable y
 y -stambh main koi sutara nahin he kyonki iske maan kaa pariklan sabaroutine main hota he, na ki spredshit par or keval andar likhaa jaataa he
 Whenever a reference is made to a cell or group of cells that are not located within the current physical spreadsheet file, it is treated as accessing a "remote" spreadsheet
 sandarbhit kaksh kii saamagree ko ek minial adhyatan ke saath pratham sandarbh par abhigam kiya ja saktaa he yaa web aadhaarit spredshits ke maamle main jaisaa abhi haal main hua, nirdisht swat:chaalit rifresh antaraal ke saath ek rial time maan ke rup main
 Many spreadsheet applications allow charts, graphs, or histograms that are generated from specified groups of cells that are dynamically constructed with changes in cell contents
 utpann graphic ghatak ko yaa to vartmaan shit main samahit kiya ja saktaa he yaa ek alag vastu ke rup main joda ja saktaa he
 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the first Javelin Software and later Lotus Improv appeared and, unlike a model in traditional spreadsheets, they use models that are built on objects called variables, Not on the data contained in the cells of a report
 These multi-dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and algorithms in a number of self-documented forms, including multi-synchronized views
 For example, Javelin's users could move through a connection between variables on a diagram, and at the same time see the branches and logical roots of each variable
 yah udhaaharan he aarambhik Javelin ke praathmik yogadan kaa - jo thi iske baarah drishyon ke madhyam se ek upyogkarta ke tark yaa model sanrachana kii anumaargniyata kii avadharana
 ek jatil model ko vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or dusron dwaara samajha ja saktaa he jinka iske nirmaan main koi haath nahin he or yah aaj bhi adwitiya bana hua he
 Javelin was used primarily for financial modeling, but was also used in the creation of instructional models in college chemistry courses, in formatting the world's economies, and in the initial Star Wars project by the military
 It is still used today by organizations for which model integrity is an important mission
 in kaaryakramon main, ek samay shrinkhalaa, yaa koi bhi char, apane aap main ek lakshya tha, na ki kakshon kaa sangrah jo ek stambh yaa pankti main hi dikhaai detaa he
 Variables can have many characteristics, including complete information about their interaction with all other variables, data references, and text and image notes
 Counts were edited on these objects, which was in contrast to the range of cells, so adding two time series automatically adds them to calendar time, or to a user-defined time frame
 Data were independent of worksheet-variables, and therefore data cannot be destroyed by erasing a row, column, or entire worksheet
 For example, January costs are subtracted from January revenue, no matter whether or not both appear on the worksheet
 This allows actions that were used in the pivot table, except that the flexible manipulation of the report table was one of the many capabilities supported by variables
 iske alaava, agar laagat ko saptaah ke anusaar or rajasav ko maheene ke anusaar darj kiya gaya he, to Javelin kaa program sahi disha main aavantit yaa antarveshan kar saktaa he
 This object design enabled variables and the entire model to reference each other with user-defined variable names, and demonstrated multidimensional analysis and large-scale easily editable aggregations
 spredshit, jisamen ankaganit abhivyakti ke bajaay taarkik abhivyakti par aadhaarit sutara bhashaa he, unhen taarkik spredshit kehete hai
 Such spreadsheets can be used to reason deductively about their cell values
 thik jaise aarambhik programing bhashaaon ko spredshit printouts utpann karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya tha, programing takneekein swayan itani viksit ho gai hai ki ve aankadon kii talikaon ko computer main hi adhik kushaltapurvak sansaadhit kar sakati hai
 While developing, spreadsheets began to use powerful programming languages such as VBA; In particular, they are functional, visual and multi-paradigm languages
 kai log, samaan anukramik program likhane ke bajaay spredshits main gananaa karne ke kaary ko aasaan pate hai
 This is due to two properties of spreadsheets
 ek 'spredshit program' ko saamaanya abhikalan kaaryon ke nishpaadan ke liye dizine kiya gaya he jiske liye vah praathmik sanghathankaree siddhant ke rup main samay ke bajaay sthanik sambandhon kaa prayog karata he
 
 ek spredshit ko ek ganitiya graph ke rup main dekhnaa aksar suvidhajanak hota he, jahaan node hai spredshit ke kaksh or kinare hai sutron main nirdisht anya kakshon ke liye sandarbh
 ise aksar spredshit kaa nirbharta graph kaha jaataa he
 References between cells can benefit from spatial concepts such as relative position and absolute position, as well as named location, to make it easier to understand and manage spreadsheet formulas
 spredshit, aamtaur par swachaalit rup se kakshon ko adhyatan karne kaa prayaas karti he jab un kakshon ko jis par ve nirbhar karte hai badal diya gaya he
 Initial spreadsheets used simple techniques such as evaluating cells in a particular order, but modern spreadsheets calculate a minimum recombination order from a dependency graph
 baad ke spredshit main maanon ko utkram main prasaarit karne kii ek simit kshamta thi, jisase vah strot maanon ko is tarah badalata tha ki ek vishesh jawaab ek nishchit kaksh main pahunch jaataa tha
 Since the spreadsheet's class formulas are generally not invertible, however, this technique has somewhat limited significance
 kai avadharanaen, jo anukramik programing model main aam hai, spredshit duniya main unke hamroop hai
 For example, a sequential model of indexed loops is usually represented as a table of classes with similar formulas,
 jabaki spredshit maatraatmak modelling main aage badhane kii ore ek bada kadam hai, inamen kamiyaan bhi hai
 At the level of overall user benefit, the spreadsheet has several major drawbacks, most notably related to the unfriendliness of addresses of alpha numeric cells
 spredshits ke saath judy anya samasyaon main shaamil hai: While built-in and third-party tools for desktops that address these shortcomings, awareness, and usage are generally minimal
 
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he ki puunji bazaar peshewaron main se 55% ko yah nahin pataa hota ki apane spredshiton kaa lekhapareekshan kaise hota he; keval 6% hi tisare paksh samaadhaanon main nivesh karte hai
 "heart failure" simply means that your heart is not pumping blood as well as it is necessary

 Heart failure is also called congestive heart failure

 Deepavans is an ancient book in which the oldest history of Sri Lanka is described
 'dipawans', 'dweepavansh' kaa apbhransh he jiskaa arth 'dweep kaa itihaas' he
 It is believed that this book was compiled in the 3rd-4th century AD from the legend and other sources
 mahavans tathaa dipawans se hi shri lanka tathaa bharat ke pracheen itihaas ke bahut si ghatnaon lekhajokha miltaa he
 It is not only important from the point of view of history, but it is also an important ancient book of Buddhist and Pali literature

 George Turner had once published his opinion that both "deepavans" and "mahavans" are two names of the same composition rather than two different compositions
 unka yah mat ayatharth hi he
 If a comparative study of the "athakatha-mahavans" of the Mahavihara of Anuradhapura and that of the Deepavans is made, it becomes clear that the author of the "deepavans" took not only enough material from the "atkathamahavas" for his edict, but the style of expression
 And at some places, the sentences are adopted as they are
 "dipawans" kaa adhikansh aisa hi he ki jisase vah ek swatantra rachana na hokar aththkatha sadrush granth yaa anya granthon ke uddharanon kaa sangrah prathit hota he
 In a way, it is just a translation of the material obtained in Sinhala into a raw pallet
 jis kaal kaa aitihaasik lekhajokha "dipawans" ne surakshit rakhaa he, vah samay mahavans ke kaal ke samanaantar hi he
 Both texts "recite" their own accounts at the time of the death of Mahasen Naresh
 is samanta kaa ek bada kaaran yah he ki donon granthon ne apni mul upadan saamagree kaa chayan ek hi sthal se kiya he or vah sthal he mahavihar kaa "aththkatha mahavans
 " mahasen naresh kii mrityu par hi "dipawans" tathaa "mahavans" ke samaapt hone kaa ek sambhav kaaran yah he ki mahavihar ke virodhiyon ne mahasen kii hi anumati praapt kar mahavihar ko vidhwans kar daalaa tha
 For the whole nine years, the Mahavihara remained void of the Mahaviharas
 dipawans ke rachanakaal ko ham i
 302 se purv nahin le ja sakate, kyonki isamen us samay tak kii ghatnaon kaa ullekh he
 The other important thing to note is that the great choreographer Buddhaghosh must have been familiar with "deepavans" or some part of it
 phir "mahavans" ko jin mahasthvir ne aage badhaayaa he unhone hamen yah jaankaree bhi di he ki dhatusen naresh ne, mahasthvir mahendra kii murti ke prati gaurav prakat karne ke liye jo mahotsav kiya tha, usamen "dipawans" kaa paath karne k ajna di thi
 By considering these things, we arrive at the same result that the Deepavans must have been composed in the early fourth century and the first half of the fifth century
 jahaan tak rachanakaal kii baat he "mahavans" kaa bhi nishchit rachanakaal agyaat hi he
 But, where "deepavans" seems to be absolutely unnoticed from the point of view of poetry, there is also a poem somewhere, "mahavans" is a great epic
 yah baat vishesh ullekhneey he ki jis prakaar srilanka ke uttarkalin pali mahakaviyon ne "mahavans" kii parampara ko chaalu rakhkar uski katha ko adhyatan bana diya, usee prakaar pandit ahungall vimalkitti mahanayake sthavir ne abhi vartmaan main hi "dipavansak kathakavy" ko aage badhaakar use bhi adhyatan bana diya he

 In those days, the gods were defeated in the battle with Tarakasura

 With Madan being consumed and Shiva being impregnated, Parvati saw all her desires fail and thinking that this beauty is futile, she went to a mountain peak to appease Shiva and started doing intense penance
 kuch kaal ke ananthar shiv kaa man pighla unhone parvati ko sweekaar karne kaa vichaar kiya
 But before that he decided to test Parvati and he reached the ashram of an ascetic

 Shiva then appeared in his form and held his hand

 Abbas is revered by Shia Muslims for his brother Hazrat Hussain, and for his role in the Battle of Karbala
 hazarat abbaas ko iraq ke karbala praant, karbala main hazarat abbaas ke roze main dafnaaya gaya hi, jahaan vah ashoora ke din karbala kii ladaai ke dauraan shahid hue the

 Wearing his father's clothes, known for being a great warrior, Abbas killed many enemy soldiers
 muvaaya kii sena ne vastav main unhen ali ke liye galat samajha
 Therefore, when Hazrat Ali himself appeared on the battlefield, Mu'awiya's soldiers were surprised to see him and were confused about the identity of the other soldier
 tab ali ne abbaas ko yah kehete hue pesh kiya: He is Abbas, the moon of the Hashimites
 
 Hazrat Abbas was trained in the art of war by his father Ali, which was the main reason that he resembled his father on the battlefield
 hazrat abbaas ne karbala kii ladaai main hazarat hossain ke prati apni vafadari dikhaayi
 But after Mu'awiya succeeded as caliph, the tyrannical Yazid denounced that Hazrat Hussain had pledged allegiance to him, but Hazrat Hussain refused, yaazid ek sharaabi he, ek mahilakaar he jo netritv ke liye anupyukt he
 Since these practices were prohibited in Islam, if Hazrat Hussain had pledged allegiance to Yazid, this act of his would have ruined the basics of Islam
 hossain ke bade bhai hazrat imam hasan ne ek samjhauta kiya tha, ki ve dharmik nirnyon ke liye jimmedaar honge or anya maamalon main hastkshep nahin karenge
 But Yazid wanted to take control of religious authority
 ubaayad allaah kii madad se, yaazid ne kusa ke logon ke naam par unhen ek patr bhejkar hazrat hossain ko maarane kii sajeesh rachi
 However most historians state that the letters were actually sent by the people of Kufa, who later betrayed them when the body of Muslim Ibn Aqeel was thrown from a building in the center of Kufa by Yazid's army, while Kufa's People kept quiet
 60 hijri main, hazrat hossain ne makka ke liye madina ko kupha yatra karne ke liye saathi or parivaar ke sadasyon ke ek chote samooh ke saath chhod diya

 lekin, jab tak hazrat hossain kupha ke paas pahunche, to unke chachere bhai kii hatya kar di gai thi
 On the way Hazrat Hussain and his group were stopped
 hazarat abbaas ko "ukab" naamak ghoda diya gaya tha
 
 Shia sources say that this horse was used by Hazrat Muhammad Sahab and Hazrat Ali and that the horse was presented to Muhammad by Saif ibn Zee Yazni, King of Yemen through Abdul Muttalib

 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it
 is vibhaajan ke kaaran utpann ucch stareey raajnneetik ashaanti ke kaaran 1911 main dono taraf kii bhartiya janata ke dabaav kii vajah se bengal ke purvi evam pashchimi hisse punah ek ho gaye
 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also made to merge the districts of Chittagang and Dhaka and Mamansingh with Bengal and Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903
 usee avasar par uske sabhapati shri lalamohan ghosh ne apane abhibhaashan main sarkaar kii pratikriyaavaadi niti kii aalochana karte hue ek akhil bhartiya manchapar asann vangbhang kii soochna di
 He said that such a conspiracy is going on
 sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par 1904 kii janvari main yah vichaar prakashit kiya or farvari main lord karzan ne bengal ke purvi jilon main vibhaajan par janata kii raay kaa akalan karne ke liye adhikarik daure kiye
 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh to try to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province
 un dinon bengal praant main bihar or urisa bhi shaamil the
 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion
 us samay ke vysarai or governor general lard karjan ne land holders association yaa jameendaar sabha main logon ko yah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii ki vangbhang se laabh hi hoga
 He himself went to East Bengal too, but none other than a handful of Muslims supported this proposal
 musalamaanon main pratishthit dhaka ke tatkaaleen nawab ne bhi pratham aavesh main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on 16 October by Lord Curzon, the then Voice Rai of India
 vibhaajan ko prashaskeey kaaryon ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya, bengal lagbhag france jitna bada tha jabaki uski aabaadi france se kahin adhik thi
 It was thought that the eastern region was neglected and not properly governed
 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition
 bengali hindu, shashan main adhik se adhik bhagidaari ke liye rajnatik andolan main agrani the, atah ab purv main muslimon kaa varchasv badhane se unki sthiti kamjor ho rahi thi| hindu or muslim dono hi ne vibhaajan kaa virodh kiya| vibhaajan ke baad, haalaanki, lagbhag rashtriya str par british virdohi andolan prabal hua jisamen ki ahimsak or hinsak virodh pradarshan, bahishkaar or yahan tak ki pashchim bengal ke nae praant ke rajyapal kii hatya kaa prayaas bhi shaamil tha
 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear
 vangbhang kaa uddeshy prashasan kii suvidha utpann karnaa nahin tha, jaisaa daawa kiya gaya tha, balki iske do spasht uddeshy the, ek hindu musalmaan ko ladaana or duusare navjaagrath bengal ko chot pahunchaana
 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance
 nae praant main pahari rajya tripura, chittagong mandal, dhaka or rajshahi shaamil hue or malda jile ko assam praant main mila diya gaya
 Bengal not only had to leave these large eastern states, but also five Hindi-speaking states had to be lost to the Central province
 pashchim kii taraf se ise madhya praant se sambalpur or paanch chote oriya-bhashi rajya pradaan kiye gaye
 Bengal had an area of 141,580 square miles and a population of five crore forty lakhs, of which four crore twenty lakhs were Hindus and ninety million Muslims
 nae praant kaa naam kramshah purvi bengal or assam tha jisamen purvi bengal kii rajdhani dhaka or assam kaa adhinsth mukhyalay chittagong tha
 Its area was 106,540 square miles and the population was thirty million, of which one crore eight million Muslims and one crore twenty lakh Hindus
 prashasan ke liye vahaan ek vidhaan parishad tathaa ek dwi-sadasyeey rajasav board tha or kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar-kshetra ko badla nahin gaya tha
 The government pointed out that there would be a properly defined western border between East Bengal and Assam and would have well-defined geographical, necrological, linguistic and social features
 bharat sarkaar ne apana antim nirnay 19 july 1905 ke sweekrut prastaav se prachaarit kiya or bengal kaa vibhaajan usee varsh 16 oktober se lagu ho gaya
 Before its abolition in 1911, the division lasted barely half a decade
 haalaanki bantwaare ke peeche britain kii niti divide at impera thi, jo ki punarsangathit praant ko prabhavit karti rahi
 In 1919, separate electoral system was established for Muslims and Hindus
 is se pehle, donon samudaayon ke kai sadasyon ne sabhi bengaaliyon ke liye rashtriya ekta kii vakaalat kii thi
 Now, individual communities developed their own political issues
 muslimon ne bhi apni samgr sankhyatmak shakti ke bal par, jo ki mote taur par do karod bees lakh se do karod assi lakh ke bich thi, vidhanmandal main varchasv hasil kiya
 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area
 muslim ab puure praant ko muslim rajya, pakistan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the
 Bengal split for the second time in 1947, this time on religious grounds
 yah purvi pakistan ban gaya
 However, after a successful liberation war with Western Pakistani military rule in 1971, East Pakistan became an independent state called Bangladesh
 bengal ke donon vibhaajanon main raktapaat hua
 This created a major political crisis
 purvi bengal main muslimon kii dharna thi ki ek alag kshetra unhen shiksha, rojgaar aadi ke adhik avasar uplabdh karaayega, jabaki pashchimi bengal ke logon ko yah bantwaaraa pasand nahin aayaa or is samay ke dauraan badi maatra main rashtravaadi sahitya kii rachana kii gayi
 The protest by the Indian National Congress was led by Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton, formerly the Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon remained unmoved
 baad main coton ne, jo ab purvi naatingham ke udaaravaadi saansad ban gaye the, sar bempfield fuller, jo purvi bengal ke pehle leftinent-governor the, ko nikaalane ke abhiyaan kaa safalataa purvak sanchaalan kiya
 In 1906 Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the rally slogan of those who opposed partition, became the national anthem of Bangladesh in 1972
 in raajnneetik virodhon ke kaaran, bengal ke donon bhaag 1911 main phir se jud gaye the
 a new partition took place that divided the province on linguistic lines in place of religious, thereby separating the Hindi, Oriya and Assamese speaking areas into new administrative units
 iske saath hi saath british bharat kii prashasnic rajdhani ko kalakatta se nai dilli le jaaya gaya
 However, the conflict between Muslims and Hindus resulted in the creation of new laws to satisfy the political needs of both classes
 bangbhang ke viruddh bengal ke baahar bahut baari andolan hua
 Famous poets and litterateurs played an important role in this movement
 is andolan ne bankimchandra chattopadhyaay ke vande maataram geet ko nai bulandiyaan pradaan kii
 At that time the English cycle of dividing Bengal was broken, it gained extraordinary fame all over the country and abroad
 german or canada jaise desh bhi isse prabhavit hue
 'vande Mataram' was inscribed on the flag of a ship named Kamagatamaru

 In 1935, Jainendra Kumar's second novel 'sunita' was published
 aarambh main iskaa do tihaai ansh chitrapat main prakashit hua tha
 It was also serialized in a Gujarati magazine
 'sunita' or janendra kii purvaprakashit aupnyasik kriti 'parakh' ke kathanak main drushtikongat bahut kuch samanta he
 The shortcomings of this novel are also clear
 iske paatr-paatriyon ke vyavhaar or pratikriyaayein niruddeshy evam apratyaashit lagati hai
 Unexpected behavior is due to the emotion of the performance, which has brought weak places in the novel
 upanyaaskaar kaa paheli bujhane kaa aagrah kriti main halakaapan laa detaa he, parantu kahin-kahin upanyaas ke charitra apni simaaon kaa atikaraman karke atishay ucchata kaa parichay dete hai
 Zainendra's fictional narrative style seems to be natural, natural in this novel
 is drushti se 'sunita' ko janendra kii sarvshereshth aupnyasik kriti kaha ja saktaa he
 The character remains astonished between the novel's impressive atmosphere and the inspired characters
 janendra kii sookshm manovaigyanik drushti or shashakt vaataavaran kaa chithran pathak par amit prabhaav daalata he
 The biggest event in the story cycle of 'sunita' is that at midnight in the deserted forest, Sunita, the protagonist of the novel, is lost in front of Hari Khushi
 parantu 'sunita' ke charitron kii maansik asthirataa ko dekhte hue is ghatana ko bahut adhik mahatv nahin dena chahie
 Based on this, the allegations of nakedness on Jainendra are unjustified
 vidyut janitr ek aisi yukti he jo yantric urja ko vidyut urja main badalane ke kaam aati he
 For this, it often uses the principle of electromagnetic induction of Michael Faraday
 vidyut motor iske vipareet vidyut urja ko yantric urja main badalane kaa kaary karti he
 An electric motor and an electric generator have something similar, and sometimes the same machine can function like both without any change
 vidyut janitr, vidyut aavesh ko ek vahya paripath se hokar pravaahit hone ke liye vaadhya karata he
 But it does not create charge
 yah jal-pump kii tarah he jo keval jal-ko pravaahit karne kaa kaary karti he, jal paidaa nahin karti
 For power generation by an electric generator, it is necessary that the rotor of the generator is rotated with the help of an external power source
 iske liye reciproketing ingine, terbine, vaashp ingine, kisi terbine yaa jal-chakra par girte hue jal, kisi anterdahan ingine, pawan terbine yaa aadmi yaa jaanavar kii shakti kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 It is possible to convert mechanical energy from any source into electrical energy
 yah urja, jalprapaat ke girte hue pani se athwa koyala jalaakar utpann kii gai ooshmaa dwaara bhav se, yaa kisi petrol athwa deazal ingine se praapt kii ja sakati he
 New sources of energy are being used
 mukhyat:, pichley kuch varshon main parmanushakti kaa prayog bhi vidyutsakti ke liye bade paimaane par kiya gaya he or bahut se deshon main parmanushakti dwaara sanchalit bijlighar banaae gaye hai
 The immense energy contained in tidal waves and volcanoes has also been used to generate electricity
 vidyutsakti ke utpaadan ke liye in sab shakti sadhano kaa upyog, vishalkay vidyut janitron dwaara hi haata he, jo mulat: farade ke 'chumbakeey kshetra main ghoomte hue chaalak par veltata preran siddhant par aadhaarit he
 This theory of Faraday can be expressed as: is prakaar vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye teen mukhya baton kii aavashyaktaa he : 1
 The magnetic field, in which the conductor is rotated, 2
 chaalak tathaa 3
 Mechanical force driving the driver in a magnetic field
 yah bhi spasht he, ki vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan vyaavhaarik banane ke liye chaalak main prerit vi
vaa
ba
 kii maatra paryaapt honi chahie
 Its volume depends on the length of the conductor, the intensity of the magnetic field and the velocity of the conductor
 vastav main ise nimnlikhit sameekaran se vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Where, e = conductor force, b = density of magnetic conductance, l = length of conductor and v = velocity of conductor isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki vyaavhaarik rup main chaalak kii lambaai evam veg donon hi bahut adhik hone chahie or saath hi chumbakeey abhivah ghanatv bhi adhiktam ho
 Maximum magnetic field
 chumbakeey kshetra kii adhiktam seemaa uske santrupt hone ke kaaran nirdhaarit hoti he
 It is also practically not possible to increase the length of the driver, but more than one driver can be adjusted in such a way that the induced VVB in them
 Become practical by joining
 vastut: janitr main ek chaalak ke sthaan par chaalak kaa ek tantra hota he, jo ek duusare se ek nirdhaarit yojana ke anusaar sanyojit hote hai
 The portion holding these conductors is called armature and their combination method is called armature kundalan
 veg adhik hone se, ghoomanevaale chaalkon par apkentre bal bahut adhik ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran armechar par unki vyavastha bhang ho ja sakati he
 Hence, they are placed in the pillars on the armature
 armechar chaalkon ko dhaaran karne ke saath hi unako ghumata bhi he, jiske liye uskaa shaft yantric urja kaa sambharan karanevaale yantra ke shaft se yugmit hota he
 This device can be a water turbine, or a steam turbine or engine
 kisi bhi rup main uplabdh yantric urja ko armechar kaa shaft ghumaane ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus various types of instruments are used to drive the generator
 inhen pradhan chaalak kehete hai
 Various types of engines, such as steam engines, diesel engines, petrol engines, gas turbines, etc
 machines, are used as prime drivers and their mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by the generator
 armechar chumbakeey padaarth kaa bana hota he, jisase chumbakeey kshetra ke abhivah kaa vaahak ho sake
 Generally, it is made of a special type of steel, which is called armature steel
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye bhi vidyut kaa hi prayog vyaavhaarik rup main kiya jaataa he, kyonki isse sthaayee chumbak kii apeksha kahin adhik tivrata kaa chumbakeey kshetra utpann kiya ja saktaa he or kshetradhara kaa vicharan kar sugamawa se kshetra kaa vicharan kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus the voltage generated can be easily controlled
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye kshetra chumbak hote hai, jinpar kshetrakundali vartit hoti he
 The magnetic field is produced by the flow of current in these coils
 ekasam kshetra ke liye kshetra chumbakon kaa aakaar kuch golai liye hota he or unke bich main armechar ghumta he
 The air gap between the armature and the field magnets must be minimal, so that most of the armature of the field current can cut off the conductors and maximize the voltage generated in the armature
 kshetra kundali main dhara pravaah ko uttejan kehete hai
 This stimulation can be done by connecting to an external source, or a part of the current generated in the same generator itself can also be used for stimulation
 bahari strot se uttejit kiye janevaale janitr ko bahya uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he or swayan usee janitr main janit dhara kaa bhaag upyog karanevaale janitr ko swat:uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he
 The systems of automatic stimulation also vary according to the combination of field coil and armature
 yadi kshetra kundali armechar se shrenee main sanyojit hon, to use shrenee janitr kaha jaataa he
 If both have lateral connections, it is called a shunt generator
 yadi kshetra kundali ke kuch vart armechar se shrenee main or kuch usase parshv sambandhit hon, to aise janitr ko sanyukt janitr kehete hai
 These different methods of stimulation provide different symptoms
 bahya uttejit janitr main kshetradhara armechar dhara athwa bhardhaara par nirbhar nahin karti
 Hence the voltage generated in it is independent of load variance
 yadi kshetradhara ko ek samaan rakhaa jaae or janitr main janit voltata bhi ek samaan rahegi
 The shunt generator also has almost the same characteristics and the effect of load variance is not much on the voltage generated
 shrenee janitr main, bhardhaara hi armechar or kshetra kundaliyon main pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, this field depends on the stream load and thus the generated voltage increases with increasing load
 sanyukt janitr main shant evam shrenee janitron ke bich ke lakshan hote hai
 By arranging the shunt and range curves of the field horoscope, any characteristics between them can be obtained
 vyavhaar main sanyukt janitron kaa hi adhik prayog hota he
 The voltage generated in a conductor moving at the same velocity in the magnetic field depends on the speed of cutting the magnetic flow of the conductor
 yah gati, vastut:, kisi kshan bhi chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ke saapeksh sthit par nirbhar karti he
 When the driver is moving at the same speed, he will be perpendicular to the transport twice in one round and in this case he will cut the maximum load, and when he does not cut any transport, will be parallel to it twice
 is prakaar ek chakkar main do baar usamen janit voltata shunya or adhiktam ke bich vicharan karegi, jaisi chitra 3
 main dikhaaya gaya he
 This type of variance is called recursive variance
 armechar chaalkon main bhi isi prakaar kii prayavarti voltata janit hoti he or use disht rup dene ke liye dikparivartak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The transformer is mounted on the shaft of the armature
 usamen bahut se tamrakhand hote hai, jo ek duusare se vidyutruddh hote hai
 The interconnections of the armature are connected to these segments
 dikparivartak se sansparsh karanevaale do burush hote hai, jo armechar main janit voltata dwaara pravaahit honevaali dhara ko bahari paripath se sanyojit karte hai
 The armature drivers are connected to the transformer in such a way that the current collected by the two bursts is in the same direction
 is prakaar ek burush dhanatmak dhara ikatthi karata he or doosraa rinatmak
 On this basis, Burushas are also called positive and negative
 vastut:, burush vidyutdhara ke terminal hai, jo bhaar ko janitr se sambhddha karte hai
 These are attributed to the Burushholder and their position on the diabolical can be administered by the Burush holder

 In these alternative calculus, different meanings have been taken of the meaning of their original idea, but to a reasonable extent their logical concept is the same
 inke avlokan se amoort sambhavyata-kalan sambandhi khoj ke prayatnon ke liye pravartak praapt hota he
 One type of abstract calculus, which can be called incrementally, was invented by JM Kens, Hans Rackenbeck and other authors
 in tantron main sambhavyata saadhy, athwa gun ke madhya aparibhaashit, sambandhon ke rup main prakat hoti he
 Imagine that the probability of a specified a / hh is indicated by the sign
 yah kahana praaia: suvidhajanak rahata he ki a ek 'ghatana' or h koi 'avasthaa' athwa 'pramaan' he
 It is not necessary to assume that a pair determines a numerical value of the practicable function; But if there is a numerical probability, it should satisfy the following four assumptions: a / h 3 0; h / h = 1 a / h + / h = 1 poorakta kaa mooldhan; or / h = a / h ́ b / , mass multiplication principal
 pratham, dwitiya or tritiy abhidhaaran se pramanik hota he ki samast sambhavyata naam 0 se 1 tak ke antaraal main sthit he, jab yah maan liya jaae ki 0 or 1 donon antaraal main sammilit hai
 Third to Comprehensive Yoga Theory with the help of IV / h = a / h + b / h - / h Can prove yadi a or b paraspar nivarak vikalp hon, to unki sanyukt ghatana kii sambhavyata shunya he
 For this kind of mutually a and b / h=a / h+b / h
 This is called special yoga principle
 yadi a / h=n / , to ham kehete hai ki a swatantra he b se 
 Imagination of independence is very important for further development of calculus
 chaturth abhidhaaran tathaa swatantraaa kii paribhaasha se pramanit hota he ki swatantra a or b ke liye samta / h = a / h ́b / h satya he
 This is called special multiplication principle
 loukik bhashaa main kisi nirdisht h kii sambhavyata kaa arth vah saapeksh barambartaa he jisase ghatana a ghatit hoti he, jabaki pratibandh h paripurna ho jate hai
 In other words, the probability of a specified h is the probability of h that is of a
 is siddhant kii vyakhya saralatam rup main nimna prakaar se kii ja sakati he : We analyze h as the number of alternative restrictions in n
 h paripurna ho jaataa he, kaa arth he ki yaa to h1 athwa xxrep 4 
 athwa hn paripurna ho jaataa he
 Some of these options bind the sequence of events of m, a
 shesh -a rin nahin kii ghatana kaa anukram bandha karte hai
 On the basis of a reciprocal terminology, we call the first class of alternatives a as a favorable and the second as an averse
 kisi nirdisht h ko sambhavyata anupaat, m : n, he, arthath anukool vikalp kii sankhya tathaa samast vikalp kii sankhya kaa anupaat he
 It is only natural for any practicable to call the true choice a range
 purvokt chirpratishthit paribhaasha ko ab nimna prakaar se vyapak banaaya ja saktaa he
 The probability of a specified h is the ratio of the measure of the pollen of h- and -a and the measure of the pollen of h only; Ie sambhavyata ke paraas siddhant main mukhya kathinaayee paraas ko maap ke kaaran he
 This difficulty is modified with the question of how to analyze the feasible option
 saamanyat: maap ke chunaav or aankadon ke vikalpon main vishleshan kii anek sambhaavnaayen hai
 The principle of the superhuman has been interpreted in relation to the well-known range definition, whose essential complement has been understood by tradition
 vernuli or laplas donon is vichaar ke the ki prayek ghatana kaa ek paryaapt kaaran hota he, jiske vishay main ham agyani ho sakate hai
 Ignorance of nature is not the undetermined nature, but the main source of potential
 isi kaaran bernuli ne sambhavyata ko vishwaas kii maatra kaha he
 It has psychological or subjective intent, due to which the subject came to a greater extent
 isse suzav miltaa he ki sambhavyata ke siddhant manovaigyanik tathyon se sambandhit ganithivy niyam hai, arthath vah prakaar jisamen manushya apane vishwaas kii anumaan yogya ghatana main 'vitarit' karata he
 The definition of probability as relative frequency is clearly objective
 isi bhanti saapeksh maap ke rup main sambhavyata kii paribhaasha vastunishth he, yadi vah anadhimaan ke chirpratishthit siddhant kii bhanti, maap vidhi gyaan kii dasha kii ore nirdesh nahin karti
 Imagine that the probability of an event occurring on an occasion of h is unaffected by the probability that an event does not occur on the previous occasion of h, that is, the occurrence of a is independent of each other's probability
 kalpana karen ki yah sambhavyata p he
 The principle of special multiplication and addition can be used on the n occasion of h in the interval p ± e of the event a, with probability to be experienced with a relative frequency
 is dwitiya sambhavyatansh ke pratifal se siddh kar sakate hai ki : n The maximum probabilistic value of the relative frequency of the event on occasions is the one closest to its probability p
 n avasaron par ghatana kii saapeksh barambharataa kaa uski sambhavyata p se kisi sankhya î kii, ho kitni bhi laghu kyon na ho, maatra se kam ke vichal kii sambhavyata kii seemaa 1 hoti he, jab n main aniyatarupen vruddhi kii jaati he
 Like this, in cosmic language, the event will eventually be experienced almost certainly with the relative frequency of its probability
 vardhaman sambhavyata ke ananthasparshi gun kii, nimnlikhit udhaaharan dwaara, vyakhya kii ja sakati he : The probability of mind and tails is 1 / 2 when a coin is thrown up
 parinaam sambhavyata ke liye swatantra he : kisi purv phenkane main praapt chitt or pat kaa koi sanchay agali baar upar ko phenkane main chitt athwa pat aane kii sambhavyata ko prabhavit na kar sakegaa
 This important theorem is called Vernouli's theorem
 tathy ke rup main yah us varg ke saadhy kaa pratham sadsy he jisko brihat sankhya kaa niyam kehete hai
 This name was first used by Pawason in 1830 AD
 1763 i
 main thomas wez ne yah siddh kiya ki yadi n swatantra avasar par kisi ghatana kii saapeksh barambharataa m : n ho, to ghatana kii sambhavyata kaa adhiktam sambhavyaman bhi m : n hoga, yadi is sambhavyata kaa aadigrihit koi maan utana sambhavya he jitna koi anya maan
 Laplace also proved this theorem independently in 1774 AD
 laplas ne yah bhi siddh kiya ki yadi varnit kalpana satya ho, to ant main yah lagbhag nishchit ho jayega ki sambhavyata kaa apni saapeksh barambharataa se sampaat hota he
 The Bays – Laplace theorem is the inverse of Bernoulli's theorem and the inverse principle of the inverse probability of probability-estimation based on frequency
 laplas or uske anuyaayiyon ne is siddhant kaa vikaas kiya or isaki anek prayogon main prayukt kiya
 The only heel of the inverse probability is its dependence on the predicted probability
 pratilom sambhavyata ab bhi vivaadaaspad vishay he
 R
A
 Researchers like Fisher have completely rejected it
 bhootkaal main praaia: yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa rahaa ki bernuli ke prameya ke naate, ant main ghatana sambhavyata anupaati sankhya main ghatit hogi, parantu yah gambhir truti he
 The theorem only states that the probability of frequency is greater than the probability of frequency and that it does not, by itself, at the end assure a conclusion about the actual frequency
 is kalpana main chhipi truti kii bernuli naishchityansh sambhaavna kii vyaktinishth sankalpana kii bernuli kaa prameya barambharataa ke padon main vastunishth sankalpana se sanyukt karata he
 First of all R
 Leslie Ellis understood and decisively criticized it in 1843 AD
 to bhi, bernuli ke prameya or sambhavyata ke anya ananthasparshi siddhant ko bina taarkik truti ke sambhavyata se sankhyik barambharataa ko sanyukt karne main prayog ke liye ek anya vidhi he
 It can be expressed as: kalpana karen ki barambharataa ke avlokan se, athwa paraas ke pratifal se, athwa kisi anya strot se, ham kisi h kii sambhavyata kii pariklpana karte hai
 From this hypothesis we calculate that it is almost, or in Bernoulli's terms, morally certain that the relative frequency of an event in the n test range will deviate from its probability by less than a fraction
 ab ham ek swayan tathy grahan kar sakate hai ki ati asambhavya ghatnaayen lagbhag apvarjit hai athwa naitik naishchitya kaa purna naishchitya kii bhanti upachaar karnaa chahie
 This fact itself was actually suggested by Bernoulli and for this reason can be called the moral principle of Benuli's determination
 iskaa grahan karnaa vaigyanik or anuprayukt prayojan main sambhavyataganan ke vaastavik prayog se bhaleebhanti samvedhan karata prathit hota he
 If the observed frequency is against the principle of moral determination, then the hypothesis is modified, or it is rejected
 vastav main naitik drudh nishchay kii seemaa moolyasaapeksh he or uskaa kisi ek, athwa anya maan, par anantim rup se niyat karnaa prayek sthiti ke liye vishisht paristhiti ke samooh par nirbhar rahegaa
 The analysis and evaluation of these conditions is the grand function of statistical theory
 kya sambhavyata ke ek athwa anek arth hai? sambhavyata ke nimnlikhit prayog kii tulana karen : The probability of a normal six-sided stamp rising above the 'sixth' side is 1 / 6
 is baat kii sambhavyata ki shakespeare ne vah naatak swayan likhe the, jo uske likhe bataae jate hai, bahut adhik he
 Frennel's experiments increased the probability of the Urmil theory of light
 kya teenon kathan main sambhavyata kaa arth samaan he? According to Hans Rackenbeck, the main proponent of the present tense of frequency theory, probability has only scientific meaning
 purvokt dwitiya udhaaharan ke rup kaa kathan, jiskaa ek vyaktigat ghatana se sambandh he, aksharsh: arthhin he, parantu samaan paristhiti main saamanyat: sthiti ke kathan ke rup main uski pun: vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The third type of statement, which relates probability to the general proviso, can be interpreted as either the ratio of successful predictions, or the ratio of truth theory in a class, to the frequency of the directive
 je
em
 kange ne bhi sambhavyata kaa ekarthak rup liya, yadhyapi nitant bhinn aadhaar par
 According to Kenge, the difficulty presented by the statement of the form of the preceding second and third examples shows that the probability theory is more judgmental than the concept of frequency theory, or any other theory that requires the amount of probability to be measured
 vyapak rup main sambhavyata parimey vishwaas kaa ek ansh he
 Those who have advocated the double meaning of probability, have done so with a desire to show an asymmetry in the probability of the third type of situation, or the probability of the law of nature and other types of probability
 jacob fredish frees ne 'ganitiya sambhavyata' se bhed karne ke liye 'niyam kii sambhavyata' ko darshanik sambhavyata kaha
 This distinction was adopted by many logicians and philosophers of the 19th century
 'darshanik sambhavyata' saidhantik rup main asankhyatmak samajhi jaati thi
 Rudolph Carnap developed the double meaning of some different types of probability
 sambhavyata kii do kalpanaaon main se pratham paraas siddhant kii bhaavana kii sambhavyata he
 Both concepts are mathematical and can be considered an alternative interpretation of abstract calculus
 karnaap ne donon siddhanton ke virdohi daavon ke samaadhaan ke liye sambhavyata kii donon sankalpanaaon ke prayog ke uchit kshetra niyat kiye
 Even so, in terms of difficulty, which both theories have to take up in the proposed analysis of probability, it cannot be assumed that the solution is entirely satisfactory

 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage

 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects

 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 The inscription on the second rock with a skeleton was that of another protagonist

 This second impression became a puzzle

 Its skeleton was of the form of a reptile, teeth in the jaws and fingernails in the fingers; But it was definitely on hand instead

 No sign of the less developed bird was found before it
 is pathar ko baad main british musium ne praapt kar liya
 In 1877, another replica of Archeopteryx was found in a stone mine, about ten miles from the first location
 is sthaan kaa naam bluemanberg tha
 This impression, which is secured in two stones, is also the mark of the skull and in all things it is better than the Londoner specimen
 in pattharon ko berlin ke naturgunde musium ne kharid liya
 After receiving the stones of Archeopteryx, their study began
 inke adhyayan ke lagbhag 36 prayaas ab tak ho chuke hai
 The last attempt was made in 1945 by Sir Gavin de Beer, the director of the British Museum
 unhone is adhyayan ke liye eks-re tathaa ultrawilet kirnon kaa bhi prayog kiya
 Sir Gavin's study confirms the following: 1
 landan musium ke jeevashmon kii caroti main ab tak jitani haddiyon kii gananaa kii gai thi usase ve adhik hai; 2
 The brain of this undeveloped bird was very much like the brain of a reptile; 3
 iske kasheruk ke sire yaa to chapate hai yaa chhichley pyaale ke aakaar ke, arthath ubhayawatal hai; 4
 The sternum is boat-shaped and codeless; There are no signs of muscle joining anywhere
 yadi pankh aadhunik udanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti hote to unamem urakut hota, yaa mansapeshiyon ke judane ke liye ubhare nishaan hote
 This suggests that Archeopteryx was not a flying bird, only a moving bird

 Its bones are not hollow or airy, 2
 kasheruka kii banaavat tathaa jod donon sarisrup jaise hai, 3

 The bone called Visakhaka is present; 3

 The palpation of the pelvis is bent backwards; 5
 karpar kii anek haddiyaan aadhunik chidiyon kii haddiyon kii bhaanti judi hai
 These mixed traits prove that Archeopteryx is the connecting link between the development of modern birds and reptiles
 iskaa arth yah nahin ki yah aadha sarisrup or aadha pakshi he, kintu yah ek aisa sarisrup tha, jisane pakshi kii ore viksit hona prarambh kar diya tha; arthath yah aadyapakshi he
 Now the question arises as to which original family Archeopteryx originated
 iskaa aakaar udanevaale sarisrup arthath terrodactile se miltaa he
 But the terodactyl had a different flying style and its bones were also different

 It has been well known that Archeopteryx was not a well-to-do bird

 In the Pali Sutras, we read many times, "before attaining enlightenment, at the time of not being Buddha, when i was a Bodhisattva", etc
 atah bodhisattva se spasht taatpary gyaan, satya dayaa aadi kaa abhyaas karne vaale us sadhak se he jiskaa aage chalakar buddha hona nishchit he
 Lord Buddha had not only been a Bodhisattva in his last birth before the state of enlightenment, but he also followed the Bodhisattva practice in many of his earlier births
 jataka kii kathaayen bhagavan buddha ke in vibhinn purvajanmon se jabaki ve bodhisattva rahe the, sambandhit hai

 Some of the Jataka stories have been named from the first words of the saga that came in the Jataka, namely - Apataka Jataka; According to one's protagonist, vānupath jātaka; According to the births of the Bodhisattva, such as Nigradh Mig Jataka, Machta Jataka, etc

 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 The Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatikar Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka-stories are quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables
 buddha sanskrit granth saddharmpundaree sutara ke dwitiya parivart main bhi kaha gaya he ki buddha anek drushtaanton se tathaa jataka ke dwaara sab praaniyon ke kalyanarth upadesh karte hai
 Apart from Buddha, other Indian saints have been preaching religions with the help of fables and parables from the time of the Upanishads to the time of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 isi pravriti ke aadhaar par jatakakathaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found
 aryashur ko lamas, tarnath ne ashwaghosh kaa hi doosraa naam bataaya he parantu yah thik nahin jaan padataa he
 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachauppannavatthu
 us ghatana ne bhagwaan ko kisi purvajanm ke vrut t ko kehane kaa avasar diya
 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and perfected his ability for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The stories of the Jataka include the stories of his past births contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography in the past
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, rather than Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the story has been called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinipatam of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutras and also in the texts of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
