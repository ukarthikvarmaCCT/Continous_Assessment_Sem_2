 portugali rajkumaar henry inamen sabase safal hua
 In the early fifteenth century, the sons of King John of the western Spanish state of Portugal were growing up and by that time the entire Middle East including Jerusalem was occupied by Muslim rulers
 purv se aane vaale resham, masaalon or aabhushanon par arab or anya muslim vyapaariyon kaa kabja tha - jo manachaahe daamon par ise europe main bechate the
 In the summer of 1412, John's three sons - Edward, Peter, and Henry - thought that they should be entrusted with something more exciting and challenging than the boring work of a prince and a knight
 unhone apane pita se ye kaha
 One of John's servants had just returned from Suuta with money in exchange for Muslim prisoners
 pichley saat sau saalon main islam ke shashan main aane ke baad agar suta ko portugali akraman se parrast kiya jaay to yah nishchit rup se ek chunaiti bharaa kaam hota

 Henry, Edward and Peter all served as fighters in this war
 lekin aarthik rup se kuch khaas hasil nahin hua - musalamaanon ne suta ke badale tanjyar se vyapaar karnaa chaalu kiya or suta ke pattan khaali rahe
 Many misconceptions were prevalent in Europe at that time
 unamem se ek ye thi ki afriqa main, kahin dakshin main, ek sone kii nadi bahati he
 But reaching there means defeating the Muslim Arabs and the barbarians present in the Sahara desert
 henry ke vichaar main ye karnaa sambhav or jaruri tha - akhirakar saat sau saal pehle uttari africa par isaiyon kaa kabja tha

 Despite not arriving at the time of Nausenica, Henry left Tangier in 1437 with an army of 7000 remaining

 His generals talked of handing over the price of withdrawal to Sutka in Moroccan hands
 henry ko ye manjuur nahin tha - wo apane bhai ferdinand ko bandhak ke rup main rakh aayaa

 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John, who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in 1487, Pero da Kovilha and Serra da Estrella were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye or unamem se ek purvi africa bhi pahunch gaya
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea

 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa

 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm

 Kopan is an important place of Maya civilization
 yah pashchim handuras main he
 The kingdom, anciently named Xukpi, flourished from the 5th century AD to the early 9th century, with antecedents going back to at least the 2nd century AD
 Its name is an obvious reference to the fact that it was located at the far southern and eastern end of Maya territory
 The nearby modern village of Copán Ruinas itself may have anciently been known as Oxwitik
 The site in Copan is perhaps best known for producing a remarkable series of portrait stelae, most of which were placed along processional ways in the central plaza of the city and the adjoining "acropolis" 
 The stelae and sculptured decorations of the buildings of Copán are some of the very finest surviving art of ancient Mesoamerica
 Many structures are elaborately decorated with stone sculptures, usually constructed from a mosaic of carved stones of a size that one person could carry
 The site also has a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame
 At its height in the late classic period Copán seems to have had an unusually prosperous class of minor nobility, scribes, and artisans, some of whom had homes of cut stone built for themselves, some of which have carved hieroglyphic texts
 The buildings suffered significantly from forces of nature in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins
 There have been numerous earthquakes -- none of the roofs of the stone buildings were intact when the site was rediscovered, and the hieroglyphic stairway had collapsed
 The Copán river changed course and meandered, destroying part of the acropolis and apparently wiping out various subsidiary architectural groups in the region
 In the long period when the site was overgrown the buildings and sculptures suffered from the invasive thick jungle vegetation and periodic forest fires
 Archeologists have consolidated and restored many structures at the site
 The fertile Copán River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th century BC
 a kingdom seems to have been established in Copán in 159
 It grew into one of the most important Maya sites by the 5th century
 Large monuments dated with hieroglyhic texts were erected in the city from 435 through 822
 Xukpi was one of the more powerful Maya city states, a regional power, although it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the kingdom located at Quirigua in 738
 It eventually withered in the face of the depletion of natural resources which was a factor in bringing most of the classic-age Maya city-states to their end
 The area continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th century - 9th century from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000
 The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century
 The first sixteen names, from Yax K'uk 'mo' to Yax Pac, are depicted on Altar Q, an artifact that has provided researchers clues to the history and origins of Copán
 By the time of the Spanish conquest of Honduras, the site had long been overgrown by rainforest
 Although this large ruined city was known locally since early colonial times, it remained largely unknown by the outside world until a series of explorers visited it in the early 19th century
 Juan Galindo wrote a description of the ruins in 1834, which was published the following year
 This sparked the interest of North American explorer and travel writer John Lloyd Stephens and English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood whose illustrated books describing Copán and other sites excited a great deal of interest in Mesoamerican antiquities among American and European scholars, and its publication is regarded as the commencement of modern Mayan studies which continue to this day
 The site was the subject of one of the first modern archeological surveys and excavations in the Maya area, conducted by the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology of Harvard University from 1891 to 1900
 Further excavations and restorations were begun by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in The 1930s, the Peabody Museum again in the 1970s, followed by the Government of Honduras's Proyecto Copán beginning in the late 1970s and continuing to this day

 Puritanism or consequentialism or pragmatism is a synonym for "pragmatism" in English and Pragmatism is derived from the Greek word 'pragma', meaning "verb" or "karma"
 tadnusaar "falanumeyapramanyawad" ek aisi vichaardhaara he jo gyaan ke sabhi kshetron main uske kriyaatmak prabhaav yaa fal ko ek atyant hi mahatvapurn sthaan detii he

 Realism is an ideology that was planted in the human mind in very ancient times

 The idealist holds that the existence of an 'object' depends on our knowledge
 yadi yah vichaar sahi he to vastu kii koi sthiti nahin he
 On the contrary, realists believe that the object has independent existence whether it is in our thoughts or not
 vastu tathaa usase sambandhit gyaan donon pruthak-pruthak sattaayen he
 There are many things in the world that we do not know about, but this does not mean that they do not exist at all

 Our knowledge makes us aware of his condition, but our knowledge about him does not destroy his existence

 It cannot be said with certainty when the purposeist ideology was born, but still keeping in mind the uniqueness of this ideology, it can definitely be said that since man caused his problems and difficulties and their solutions
 Started thinking about the truth and practicality of the experiences gained from the efforts made for this, since then this ideology has been planted

 Dr
 Schiller has proposed a theory called Humanitarianism which should really be considered a branch of consequentialism
 james kii to praaia: sabhi kritiyaan is vichaardhaara par aadhaarit hai
 James was often a staunch opponent of spiritualism, especially Hegelian spiritualism
 unhen prayogpriy evam bahyavastuvaadi amareeki janata kaa vaicharik pratinidhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 When he was engaged in the idea of a criterion of truth that was entirely different from the metaphysical paradigm, he wrote "how do we make our ideas clear" in an American monthly paper called "pupular Science" in January, 1878
 - Read the article and after finding the basic framework of modern consequentialism, he became convinced that this is the criterion of truth or truth
 peers ko, jaisaa swayan unhone hi kaha he, falanumeyapramanyawad kaa sabhanarthvachi "pregametism" shabd or uskaa bhav donon hi germany ke suprasiddh darshanik kaant kii kritiyon se mili the
 But even while showing the antiquity of this ideology, James considers himself especially grateful to Peers and has honored him as a pioneer of modern consequentialism in philosophy
 jo bhi ho, is siddhant ko bal evam prakhyati pradaan karne main swayan james kaa hi naam sarvopar ullekhneey he
 All the well-known texts such as his "principles of Psychology", "miscellaneous Forms of Religious Experience", "consequentialism", "meaning of Truth" and "the Nine World" support this ideology
 unke na keval taarkik vichaar hi kintu manovaigyanik evam tathvik-sabhi prakaar ke vichaar falanumeyapramanyawaadee pravriti ke suspasht pratik hai
 According to James "truth is the name of all things that prove themselves superior in the way of faith, and also for certain specific things"
 sankshep main, "satya vichaar kii prakriya kaa ek yogya yaa uchit upkaran maatr hota he, thik vaise hi jaise "shubh" hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek safal saadhan maatr; vah kisi bhi prakaar se laabhprad or, vastut:, antatogatva tathaa sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par laabhadaayak he
 "james considers truth to be the cash value of our personal perceptions, not objective facts
 unke anusaar ham swayan apane satyon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They are not merely reactions of external objects; But the seekers of our purposes are our only faith
 ham un vishwaason ko jo hamen bhavatmak tripti yaa vyaavhaarik safalataa pradaan karte hai satya maanane lagate hai, or iske vipareet parinamawaalon ko asaty
 Therefore, the veracity of our beliefs or thoughts is permissible by their result or result
 uske sthapit hone ke liye samay or anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Just as we get success in behavior with a belief, so also its truth increases
 hamaare simit anubhav dwaara pramanit hamaari kisi bhi aasthaa ko purnataya satya kahalaane kaa adhikaar nahin, yahan tak ki vigyaan ke tathakthith prakritik niyamon ko bhi purna rup se satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We have the right to say as much as possible that as far as our experiences are concerned, they have proved to be true; But this does not prove their eternal truth
 purna satya ke liye purna anubhav, jiskaa hona kabhi sambhav nahin, apekshit he
 Therefore, any truth propounded by humans, whether it is scientific or whether it is scientific or logical, cannot be absolute truth
 jinhen praaia: manushya siddh-satya yaa siddhant sajaate hai unhen falanumeyapramanyawaadee keval upakalpana hi maanate hai
 They strongly criticize rationalist logic and corrupt their principles of justice
 ve maanviya vichaaron ko, buddhivaadee tarkshastriyon kii manyata ke viruddh, sadaiv prayojnatmak maanate hai, ni:swaarth nahin
 The Indian method of testing the truthfulness of knowledge called "tendency, strength and tendencyism", according to which the successor knowledge is considered to be true or false knowledge is inexact or false when it comes into action, resembling this consequential phenomenological method
 parantu, saath hi saath, "tadvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan yathartham" evam tadbhaavvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan bhram:" kahanevaala kattar vastuvaadi nyaayadarshan anurupatavaad kaa samarthak prathit hota he, jab ki james aadi paashchaatya falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ne uski katu aalochana kii he
 Just as in Satyasatya deliberation, similarly in the interpretation of mental processes or ideas, the consequentialist primevalists give a major place to our practical actions
 unke anusaar, ham na keval apane satyon kaa hi kintu vividh anubhavon kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai
 Our primary or basic experience is like an uninterrupted stream and we divide it into various substances and their interrelationships, inspired by self-interest and self-interest, through our mental actions of analyzing and choosing, etc
 is prakaar, inke manovigyaan or lock aadi ke parmanuwaadi manovigyaan main, jiske anusaar hamaare vichaar praarambhik saral pratyayon ke ek yantric dhang se sangrahit anukram maane jate hai, moulik antar he
 Atomicist psychology is an imitation of the physical science of the same name, which is far from the reality and misleading in the eyes of the consequentialists
 vishwaason yaa vichaaron ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan main falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi sweekaar karanevaalon main tatvagyan sambandhi mataiky nahin
 Nevertheless, if any philosophy can be said to be a counterpoint to this ideology, it is the doctrinal principle propounded by Dr
 Schiller in the book "studies in Humanism", supported by Prof
 Dui
 iske anusaar, ham swayan hi sadaiv ek badi had tak or sahi arth main vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality continues to form, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa sambandh he yah nishchay he ki uskaa swaroop nirman, ek atyant mahatvapurn ansh main, hamaar or hamaare us gyaan ke upar nirbhar rahata he jisapar hamaare prayojanon or swaarthon kii chhap anivaaryat lagi rahati he
 Our facts are those in which their Nirmapika have the power or ability to satisfy our desires
 jis prakaar satya hamaare safal vishwaas hote hai usee prakaar tathy hamaari ichchhaaon ko santushti pradaan karanevaale padaarth hote hai
 In short, successful functional effectiveness in our practical life should be understood, according to these thinkers, as a sign of fact or reality
 bhartiya buddha darshan kii sat kii paribhaasha bhi, jiske anusaar "sat vah he jisamen kisi kaary ko utpann karne kii kshamta ho", falanumeyapramanyawaadee vichaardhaara ke anukool prathit hoti he, kyonki usamen bhi vastuon ke sattvaasatva, astitv, anstitv, ke nirdhaaran main unke kaaryrup fal ko hi nirnaayak mana he
 But in many other philosophical matters, all Buddhist philosophers neither agree with each other nor with the modern philanthropist
 ek maanavtaavaadi darshan hone ke kaaran prayojanavaad sansar evam uski vastuon tathaa kriyaaon ke kaarnon par us gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karata jitna maanav jivan main uski upyogita par vichaar karata he
 In order to protect its existence as an independent philosophy, Purposeism has laid down the following basic principles, considering the reasons of the world and its actions, making human the basis
 atah spasht he ki prayojanavaadee kabhi adarshavaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai to kabhi prakrutivaadiyon kaa
 In this way, they place themselves between these two 'vados'
 prayojanavaadee darshan ‘pragati gami shiksha’ ke aandolan ke rup main prasphutit hua parantu aaj uski safalataa ke sambandh main anek ashankayein uthaai ja rahi hai
 The reason is clear that Purposeism has shown to be imperfect ideology by its uncertain objectives, by giving more importance to the instrument and by rendering principles like creativity in the field of human values
 prayojanavaadee darshan ke sambandh main kuch vichaarneey bindu is prakaar hai – Due to the soft education system, children are not prepared to live real life
 unhen ek kritrim khyaali duniyaan main rakhaa jaataa he

 Tatya Tope was a prominent general of India's first freedom struggle
 san 1857 ke mahaan vidroh main unki bhoomika sabase mahatvapurn, preranadayak or bejod thi
 Sattavan's rebellion began on May 10 in Meerut
 jaldi hi kranti kii chingaari samooche uttar bharat main fail gayi
 The Indian people fought fiercely to turn the bloody claw of foreign power
 usne apane khun se tyaag or balidaan kii amar gaatha likhi
 From the stage of that bloody and glorious history, Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, Nana Saheb Peshwa, Rao Sahab, Bahadur Shah Zafar, etc
, took over the reins of Tatya for about a year after the departure
 nice and thanks Tatya was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family in Yevla village near Nashik district in Maharashtra
 unke pita pandurang raav bhatwo, peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke gharelu karmchaariyon main se ek the
 Due to being loyal to Peshwa Bajirao, he moved to Bithoor in 1818 with Bajirao
 tathya kaa vaastavik naam ramchandra pandurang raav tha, parantu log sneh se unhen tathya ke naam se pukaarte the
 The birth of Tatya is believed to be 1814
 apane aath bhai-bahanon main tathya sabase bade the
 For some time Tatya had also worked in the Bengal Army's artillery regiment in the East India Company, but the British job was unbearable for the independent warner and self-respecting Tatya
 isliye bahut jaldi unhone us naukari se chhutkaaraa paa liya or bajirao kii naukari main waapas aa gayi
 It is said that due to a job in artillery, Tope was associated with his name, but some people tell a different story in this regard
 kaha jaataa he ki bajirao ne tathya ko ek beshkeemtee or nayab topi di thi
 Tatya used to wear this tope with great fervor
 atah bade thaat-baat se vah topi pahanane ke kaaran log unhen tathya topi yaa tathya tope ke naam se pukaarane lage
 That birth remained unmarried
 san 1857 ke vidroh kii lapten jab kanpur pahaunchin or vahaan ke sainikon ne naanaa sahab ko peshwa or apana netaa ghoshit kiya to tathya tope ne kanpur main swadhinata sthapit karne main aguwai kii
 Tatya Tope was appointed by Nana Saheb as his military advisor
 jab brigadier general havelock kii kaman main angrej sena ne elahabaad kii ore se kanpur par hamalaa kiya tab tathya ne kanpur kii suraksha main apana ji-jaan laga diya, parantu 16 july, 1857 ko uski paraajay ho gayi or use kanpur chod dena pada
 Soon Tatya Tope reorganized his forces and reached Bithur, twelve miles north of Kanpur
 yahan se kanpur par hamale kaa mauka khojane lage
 Meanwhile, Havelock suddenly attacked Bithoor
 yadhyapi tathya bithur kii ladai main parajeet ho gayi parantu unki kaman main bhartiya sainikon ne itani bahaduree pradarshit kii ki angrej senapati ko bhi prashansa kerani paddy
 Tatya was a beleaguered general
 paraajay se vichlit na hote hue ve bithur se raav sahib sindhiya ke ilaake main pahunche
 There, he succeeded in bringing the famous Gwalior contingent named Ghadiyar contingent on his side
 vahaan se ve ek bady sena ke saath kalpi pahunche
 In November 1887, he attacked Kanpur
 major general vinaal ke kaman main kanpur kii suraksha ke liye sthit angrej sena teetar-bitar hokar bhaagi, parantu yah jeet thode samay ke liye thi
 Tatya was defeated on 6 December by Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief of the British Army
 isliye tathya tope khaari chale gayi or vahaan nagar par kabja kar liya
 In Khari, he received several cannons and three lakh rupees which were necessary for the army
 isi bich 22 march ko sar huroj ne jhansi par gheraa daalaa
 At such critical times, Tatya Tope arrived with about 20,000 soldiers to help Rani Laxmi Bai
 british sena tathya tope or rani kii sena se ghir gayi
 The queen eventually triumphed
 rani or tathya tope iske baad kalpi pahunche
 In this war, Tatya Tope once again had to face defeat against the Heroes
 kanpur, charkhaari, jhansi or konch kii ladaayiyon kii kaman tathya tope ke haath main thi
 Unfortunately, he was defeated at other places except Charkhari
 tathya tope atyant yogya senapati the
 After the defeat of Konch, it did not take long for them to understand that if no new and vigorous steps were taken, the freedom fighters would be defeated
 isliye tathya ne kalpi kii suraksha kaa bhaar jhaansi kii rani or apane anya sahyogiyon par chod diya or ve swayan vesh badalakar gwalior chale gayi
 While Hierose was celebrating Kalpi's victory, Tatya achieved such a unique success that Huroz was taken aback
 tathya kaa javaabi hamalaa avishwasaneey tha
 He had got the army of Maharaja Jayaji Rao Scindia on his side and captured the famous fort of Gwalior
 jhansi kii rani, tathya or raav sahab ne jeet ke dhanke bajaate hue gwalior main pravesh kiya or naanaa sahab ko peshwa ghoshit kiya
 This thrilling success filled the hearts of freedom fighters with joy, but before Tatya Tope could consolidate his power, Huroj invaded
 phulbaag ke paas hue yuddh main rani lakshmibai 18 june, 1858 ko shahid ho gayin
 After this, the ten-month life of Tatya Tope is a life full of unique Shaurya saga
 lagbhag sab sthanon par vidroh kuchlaa ja chukaa tha, lekin tathya ne ek saal kii lambi avadhi tak mutthi bhar sainikon ke saath angrej sena ko jhakjhore rakhaa
 During this time, he conducted a great raid war against the enemy, which brought him to the first line of the world's raid warriors
 is chhapemar yuddh ke dauraan tathya tope ne durgam paharyon or ghaatiyon main barsaat se ufanti nadiyon or bhayanak jangalon ke paar madhyapradesh or rajasthan main aisi lambi daud-daudi jisane angreji camp main tahalaka machaaye rakhaa
 Repeatedly attempts were made to surround them and repeatedly battled Tatya, but this guerrilla warrior went out of the British enclosures and traps with a prudent prudence
 tatkaaleen angrej lekhak silavester ne likhaa he ki ’’hajaaron baar tathya tope kaa peechha kiya gaya or chalis-chalis mile tak ek din main ghodon ko daudaya gaya, parantu tathya tope ko pakadney main kabhi safalataa nahin mili
 '' gwalior se nikalne ke baad tathya ne chambal paar kii or rajasthan main tonk, bundi or bhilwara gayi
 Their intention was to capture Jaipur and Udaipur at first, but Major General Roberts already reached there
 parinaam yah hua ki tathya ko, jab ve jaipur se 60 mile dur the, waapas lautnaa pada
 Then they intended to take control of Udaipur, but the Rabtrs laid siege
 usne leftinent karnal homes ko tathya kaa peechha karne ke liye bheja, jisane tathya kaa rasta rokane kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi thi, parantu aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Further from Bhilwara, Tatya had a fierce encounter with the British army at Kankroli in which they were defeated
 conkaroli kii paraajay ke baad tathya purv kii ore bhaage, taaki chambal paar kar saken
 It was the month of August
 chambal teji se batch rahi thi, lekin tathya ko jokhim uthaane main anand aata tha
 The British were following them, so they crossed the Chambal in the flood itself and reached Jhalar Patan, the capital of Jhalawar
 jhalawad kaa shaasha angrej-parastha tha, isliye tathya ne angrej sena ke dekhte-dekhte usase lakhon rupee vasuul kiye or 30 topon par kabja kar liya
 From here, his intention was to reach Indore and take the freedom fighters in his favor and reach south again
 tathya ko bharosa tha ki yadi narmada paar karke maharashtra pahunchnaa sambhav ho jaay to swadhinata sangram ko na keval jari rakhaa ja sakegaa, balki angrejon ko bharat se khadeda bhi ja sakegaa
 In early September, 1858, Tatya turned to Rajgarh
 vahaan se unki yojana indore pahunchane kii thi, parantu iske pehle ki tathya indore ke liye ravaanaa hote angreji fouj ne major jan
 micle kii kaman main rajgarh ke nikat tathya kii sena ko gher liya
 Michael's troops were tired, so he thought of attacking in the morning, but on the next morning he was surprised to see that Tatya's army had escaped from his trap
 tathya ne beawara pahunchakar morchabandi kar rakhi thi
 Here the British attacked on foot, horsemen and artillery squads together
 yah yuddh bhi tathya haar gayi
 His 27 cannons hit the British
 tathya purv main betwa kii ghati kii ore chale gayi
 At Sironj, Tatya captured four cannons and rested for a week
 sironj se ve uttar main ishagarh pahunche or kasbe ko lootakar paanch or topon par kabja kiya
 Tatya's army was divided into two parts from Ishagarh
 ek tukdi raav sahab kii kaman main lalitpur chali gayi or duusari tathya kii kaman main chanderi
 Tatya believed that Scindia's army would join her in Chanderi, but this did not happen
 isliye ve 20 mile dakshin main, magavali chale gayi
 There Michail followed him and defeated him on 10 October
 ab tathya ne betwa paar kii or lalitpur chale gayi jahaan raav sahab bhi maujuud the
 Both of them intended to cross Betwa, but on the other bank of the river, the British army stopped the path
 chaaron ore ghira dekhakar tathya ne narmada paar karne kaa vichaar kiya
 To fulfill this plan, he reached Khurai in Sagar district, where Michail defeated the previous squad of his army
 isliye tathya ne hoshangabad or narsinghpur ke bich, fatehpur ke nikat saraiya ghat par narmada paar kii
 Tatya crossed Mulayada in late October 1858 with around 2500 soldiers
 narmada paar karne ke bahut pehle hi tathya ke pahunchne kaa sanket mil chukaa tha
 On 28 October, Kotwar of Etawah village reported an importance at Asre police station, 10 miles away from Chhindwara, informing that a saffron flag, betel nut and betel leaf were being rotated from village to village
 inkaa uddeshy janata ko jaagrath karnaa tha
 They also indicated that Nana Saheb or Tatya Tope were reaching in that direction
 angrejon ne tatkaal kadam uthaae
 The deputy commissioner of Nagpur alerted the deputy commissioners of neighboring districts to face the situation
 is soochna ko itnaa mahatvapurn mana gaya ki uski jaankaree governor general ko di gayi
 By crossing the Narmada and entering its southern region, Tatya caused panic in the hearts of the British
 tathya isi maukey kii talash main the or angrej bhi unki is yojana ko vifal karne ke liye samooche kendriya bharat main morchabandi kiye the
 In this perspective, the success of Tatya Tope will certainly be considered amazing
 nagpur kshetra main tathya ke pahunchne se bombay praant kaa garvanar elfinston ghabara gaya
 Panic spread in Madras province as well
 tathya apni sena ke saath pachmadi kii durgam paharyon ko paar karte hue chhindwara ke 26 mile uttar-pashchim main jamai gaanv pahunch gayi
 17 soldiers of the police station were killed there
 phir tathya bordeh hote hue saat november ko mulatai pahunch gayi
 Both are in Betul district
 mulatai main tathya ne ek din vishram kiya
 He bathed in the Tapti River and donated one Ashrafi to the Brahmins
 baad main angrejon ne ye asharfiyan jabt kar leen
 The heads of Deshmukh and Deshpande families of Multai and many villagers joined his army
 parantu tathya ko yahan jan samarthan praapt karne main vah safalataa nahin mili jisaki usne apeksha kii thi
 The British laid a strong siege on him in Betul
 pashchim yaa dakshin kii ore badhane ke raste band the
 Tatya eventually looted Multai and set fire to government buildings
 ve uttar-pashchim disha kii ore mud gayi or athaner or bhinsdehi hote hue purv nimad yani khandawa jile pahunch gayi
 Tatya reached Khandwa crossing the Satpura peaks in the Tapti valley
 unhone dekha ki angrejon ne har ek disha main unke viruddh morcha band diya he
 Sir Huroz in Khandesh and General Roberts in Gujarat blocked his path
 baraar kii ore bhi fouj unki taraf batch rahi thi
 a colleague of Tatya wrote that Tatya was facing a very difficult situation at that time
 unke paas na gola-barood tha, na rasad, na paisa
 He commanded his allies that they could go wherever they wanted, but sincere allies and followers were not willing to leave their leader in such difficult times
 tathya aseergarh pahunchnaa chaahate the, parantu aseer par kada paharaa tha
 So, before leaving Nimad Tatya set fire to police stations and government buildings of Khandwa, Piplod etc
 khandawa se ve khargon hote hue central india waapas chale gayi
 In Khargone, Khajiya Nayaka joined Tatya Tope with his 4000 followers
 inamen bhil sardaar or malsin bhi shaamil the
 Here in Rajpur, a fierce battle was fought with Sadarland, but Tatya managed to cross the Narmada by dodging the Sadarland
 bharat kii swadhinata ke liye tathya kaa sangharsh jari tha
 Once again, Tatya's great journey against the enemy started from Khargone via Chhota Udaipur, Banswada, Jeerapur, Pratapgarh, Nahargarh and reached Indargarh
 indergarh main unhen nepier, shabars, summerset, smith, micel or harnor naamak brigadier or usase bhi unche sainik adhikariyon ne har ek disha se gher liya
 There was no way to escape, but Tatya had immense patience and understanding
 angrejon ke is kathin or asambhav ghere ko todkar ve jaipur kii ore bhaage
 He had to be defeated by the British in Dewas and Shikar
 ab unhen niraash hokar paron ke jangal main sharan lene ko vivash hona pada
 Tatya Tope is betrayed in the forest of Paron

 Ranbankure could not catch Tatya awake
 vidroh or angrejon ke viruddh yuddh ladne ke aarope main 15 april, 1859 ko shivpuri main tathya kaa court marshall kiya gaya
 All the members of the court martial were British

 18 april ko shaam paanch baje tathya ko angrej company kii suraksha main baahar laayaa gaya or hajaaron logon kii upasthiti main khule maidan main phaansi par lataka diya gaya
 It is said that Tatya climbed above the steps of the gallows and put his own throat in the loop of the gallows
 is prakaar tathya madhyapradesh kii mitti kaa ang ban gayi
 Colonel Malleson has written the history of the Revolt of 1857
 unhone kaha ki tathya tope chambal, narmada or parvati kii ghaatiyon ke nivaasiyon ke ’hero‘ ban gayi hai
 The truth is that Tatya has become the 'hero' of all India
 percy cross naamak ek angrej ne likhaa he ki ’bhartiya vidroh main tathya sabase prakhar mastishk ke netaa the
