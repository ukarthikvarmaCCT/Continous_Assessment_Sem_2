 He said, "whoever reads our songs and really knows anything about us, they will know that we are not promoting any"
 "one of the special things i like about this band is that we never impose any kind of political or religious beliefs on people
 We are just there to entertain with music and maybe to awaken ideas on both sides
 For, but we never really try to cut someone's throat
 i think a lot of bands are doing that nowadays

 Gutoff promised that they would change the existing bureaucracy of the company and make every effort to create an open environment like a small company

 1982 tak welsh ne jones dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye prabandhan dhaanche ko bahut had tak chhin-bhinn kar diya tha
 In the 1980s, Welsh worked towards simplifying ge's methodology
 1981 main unhone neuyork shahar main "dhimi gati se vrudvi kar rahi arthvyavastha main tej gati se aage badhanaa" is sheershak pe bhaashan diya
 ise aksar shairdharak ke mulya kaa mahatv jaanane kaa "savera" kehete hai

 welsh kaa maananaa tha ki koi bhi company, jis bhi udyog kaa vah hissaa ho, usamen # 1 yaa # 2 number par honi chahie, yaa use us kshetra ko puri tarah chhod dena chahie
 baad main welsh kii ranneeti puure america main kai korporate companiyon ke siio ne apanaai
 Every year, Welsh fired 10 of its worst-performing managers
 apane karmchaariyon ke saath baithkon main ve nirdayee hone kii had tak spashtvaadita ke liye jane jane lage
 ve apane prabandhakon par acha pradarshan karne ke liye dabaav banaate the, lekin sabase acha pradarshan karne vaale 20% karmchaariyon ko bonus or share vikalp bhi pradaan karte the
 He also expanded share option programs at GE to about one-third of the company's employees rather than just top executives
 welsh ko company ke nau-stareey prabandhan padanukram ko khatm karne or company main anaupchaarikta kaa maahaul banane ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 In the early 1980s, he was called as "neutron jack", leaving the buildings to do the same, but fired the workers
 Jack: Welsh in Straight from the Gut states that GE had 411,000 employees at the end of 1980, while by the end of 1985 they were down to 299,000
 vetan-chitthey se baahar hone vaale 112,000 karmchaariyon main se 37,000 vikray vyapaaron jabaki 81,000 vartmaan vyapaar main bane rahe

 Some industry analysts claim that Welsh is heavily credited with ge's success
 ve daawa karte hai ki company kii safalataa ke liye vibhinn prabandhak mukhya rup se uttaradaayi rahe hai
 For example, GE Capital under Gary C
 Wyandit contributed nearly 40% of the company's total earnings, while NBC and Robert C
 Wright did significant network expansion work, which would have led to a double-digit growth in the company's earnings for five years doing
 It is also believed that Welsh did not save GE from any major losses as the company's annual earnings growth was 16% during the tenure of his predecessor, Reginald H
 Jones

 velsh ne saarvajanik rup se kaha he ki unhen ucch vetan paane vaale siio or ausat vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon ke vetan main bada antar hone kii baat se koi fark nahin padataa
 When asked his opinion about the extremely high salaries paid to the CEO, Welsh said all such allegations were "outrageous" and strongly opposed the proposed SEC rules affecting workers' compensation
 adhikariyon ke atyadhik vetan par mache hangaame kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki siio ko milane vaali kshatipurti kaa niyantran mukt bazaar dwaara hona jari rahanaa chahie, isamen sarkaar yaa anya bahari agenciyon kaa koi dakhal nahin hona chahie
 iske atirikt, welsh 2002 ke sarbence-oxle act ke mukhar virdohi hai

 Just as a normal circuit is constructed by adding different components, the IC is not constructed by making all the components within a semiconductor follow a specific process simultaneously
 ekikrut paripath aajkal jivan ke har kshetra main upyog main laaye ja rahe hai
 Due to these, the size of electronic devices has become very small, their working capacity has become very high and their power requirement has been reduced

 Today we can say that if the transistor had not been invented, it would not have been incompatible; And if it were not integrated, there would not be computers and other electronic devices whose circuit is made up of billions of components
 ekipari ke vikaas se nimnlikhit laabh hote hai- Integrated circuits are divided into three parts based on the nature of the circuit inside them - digital ekikrut paripathon ko unamem prayukt transistoron kii sakhya ke aadhaar par small scale integrated, medium scale integrated, large scale integrated, veri large scale integrated, ultra large scale integrated aadi main baanta jaataa he

 Even when Mohammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan and took him captive to Ghazni, he could not control himself and went to Ghazni
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kaid main band prithviraj ko jab andhaa kar diya gaya to unhen is avasthaa main dekh kar inkaa hriday dravit ho gaya evam inhone gori ke vadh kii yojana banaayi
 Under the said scheme, he first won the heart of Ghori and then told Ghori that Prithviraj could wield a wrenching arrow
 isse prabhavit hokar mohammad gori ne prithviraj kii is kala ko dekhne kii ichha prakat kii
 On the day of the performance Chand Baradiyi sat on the stage with Ghori
 andhe prithviraj ko maidan main laayaa gaya evam unase apni kala kaa pradarshan karne ko kaha gaya
 As Prithviraj shot an arrow over an hour, Ghori's mouth suddenly said "wow! Wow !!" The word came out just what was it again
 Chandbardiyi immediately told Prithviraj in a couplet that where Ghori was sitting and at what height
 vah doha is prakaar tha: Four bamboo twenty four yards, Angul Ashta Praman! Ta Sultan is up, Chauhan does not miss out !! is prakaar chand bardaai kii sahaayta se se prithviraj ke dwaara gori kaa vadh kar diya gaya
 Prithviraj Raso composed by him is considered to be the first authentic poetry of Hindi language

 The Compton effect is an interaction with a substance of high frequency electromagnetic radiation in which the energy of the photons is degraded by increasing free electrons and their wave amplitude increases
 prakirnit vikiran kii tarangadairghy keval prakirnan ke kone par nirbhar karti he
 In order to clarify the Compton effect, in 1923 AD, Compton and Debai independently adopted the notion that the total energy / momentum in the photon moving in a direction yaa keval thodaa sa bhaag par de saktaa he
 This causes the energy of the observed photon, which has a Planck constant, and the frequency of radiation, to be less than the incident photon's energy and increases the wavelength related to the photon

 In 1924, Burr, Kremers, and Slater suggested another model that was based on waveism
 is praturup main urjasthirataa or samvegasthirataa ke niyam vikiran or electron kii kisi ekaaki ant: kriya main lagu na hokar anek takkaron ke sankhyikeey madhya par hi lagu hote hai
 Therefore, the incident radiation is continuously scaled to correspond to the wavelength model of Tamson, but sometimes a reflect electron also emits from the scatter

 Using the energy and stability of momentum in the Kapton – Debai photon model, a precise relationship is found in the directions of the reflected electron and the dispersed photon

 According to Dirac's theories of quantum mechanics, the interaction between an electromagnetic field and an electron has been explained completely differently
 is praturup main ant: kriya kii praarambhik or antim sthitiyon ke atirikt ek madhyam sthiti bhi hoti he, jisamen keval samveg hi sthir rahata he, urja nahin
 In this internal state an electron can emit a photon or absorb a photon
 at: kaanpton parinaam main do vikalpon kii shakyata he : By considering both of these options, the scattering of electromagnetic radiation of electrons has been studied and the conclusions drawn from it have been proved by modern experiments to be sufficient for the expansion of energy
 kaanpton-debaai ke nishkarsh is saamaanya nishkarshon ke vishesh rup he
 If we consider the electrons to be completely independent and stable in the dislocated material and if the incident photon has energy and the dislocated photon has energy, then using the laws of energy stability and momentum stability we get the following equations: jahaan h⁄mec is called the Compton wavelength of the electron; Its value is equal to 2
