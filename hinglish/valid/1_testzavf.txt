 mudiet yaa mudiettur kerala ke ek paaramparik anushthan theatre or lok nrity naatak he jo ki devi kaali or daanav darika ke bich kii ladaai kii puranic kathaon ko bataata he
 The ritual is a part of the Bhagavati or Bhadrakali cult
 yah nrity ' bhagwati kawas ',naamak mandir main kiya jaataa he, jo fasal or fasal ke mausam ke farvari or may ke bich mata devi ke mandir hai
 In 2010, Muditetu was written on the UNESCO representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, becoming the second art form from Kerala after Kudiyattam
 mudiet kerala ke trishshur,ernakulam jila, kottayam or idukki zila main maaraar or kuruppu samudaayon ke sadasyon dwaara kiya gaya ek gaanv anushthan he
 Muditiyu is a communal undertaking in which each caste of the village plays a specific role

 Moodiyettu is performed annually in the temples of the goddess in 'bhagwati Kavas', in various villages along the Salakkudi Puja, Periyar and Moovattupuzha rivers
 kaali khilne main koi reharsal yaa taiyaari nahin he yah pradarshan bhagwaan shiv, naarad, rakshason daanvaan or daarican se kaali tak ek prakritik pragati he
 a full moodetetu performance requires a total of 16 individuals — including percussionists, kalamezhuthu artists, singers
 mudiet se sambandhit ek kahani - darika ek rakshas tha jisane brahma se ek vardaan praapt kiya tha jo ki hindu puranic kathaon ke chaudaa sansar main rahane vaale kisi bhi vyakti dwaara kabhi bhi use parajeet nahin kiya jayega
 This made Darika extremely powerful and proud
 is vardaan ke saath sashastr, darika ne devtaa ke raja indra ko bhi haraane vaale vishwa par vijay praapt karne ke liye chale gaye
 As his atrocities became unbearable, the sage Narada requested Shiva to engage the darika
 shiv ne sahmati vyakt kii, brahma ke vardaan ko darkinar karte hue yah ghoshit kiya gaya ki darika devi kaali ne use maar diya jayega, vah ek mahila thi or manushya ke bich paidaa nahin hui thi
 There are also obvious regional differences in Mudiyettu's dress and performance styles
 Thus, in the Korati style, Kali shows a bare torso, covered by a breast-shape figure in the Kizilam and Pazur styles, a full upper body dress
 Wears it isi tarah, koratti style main, darika kii mudi kathakali taj ke jaisaa dikhti he or uskaa cheharaa kathakali ke kathi bhaavon ko chitrit karata he
 This indicates how the two forms are interlinked, although Mudittiyu predicts from Kathakali, epigraphists tracing their development as an art even to the 9th or 10th century AD
 apni nishpaksh kala or apni maukhik paramparaon or abhivyakti, gyaan or prathaon or paaramparik shilp kaushal ke saath anushthan or utsav kii ghatnaon ke dauraan pradarshan kiya he
 Being an oral tradition, Mudiyettu relies on the face of direct, communion through traditional guru-disciple tradition
 pradarshan ke dauraan yuva peedi ko prashikshuon yaa sahaayakon ke rup main lagaaya jaataa he
 Currently only four traditional families of regular artists of Madiyet exist in India

 ek samudaay aadhaarit kala rup hone ke naate yah samudaay he jisane paaramparik rup se kala prapatr ko banaae rakhane ke liye agali peedi ko protsaahit kiya or prashikshit kiya he
 There is no school or institution to impart training in this art form and its existence depends directly on direct broadcasting through the guru-shishya tradition
 bharat or kerala kii sarkaron ne mudiettu main academik hit ko badhaava dene or paryaton ke hisse ke rup main ise badhaava dene ke liye kuch kadam uthaae hai
 Large-scale commercialization, globalization and the onslaught of technology have had a negative impact on Mudiyettu, as they have pushed many traditional and ritualistic arts to the brink of extinction
 unesco kii manyata se pradarshan kii aavriti main sudhaar kii ummid he, mudiettu ke anusandhan hit or abhilekhiy ripogitary banane
 Therefore it is very important to maintain such precious cultural forms and if we are able to do so, our youth or future generations can enjoy and feel the real beauty of our culture

 Economics is the branch of social science under which the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services are studied
 'arthshaastra' shabd sanskrit shabdon arth or shaastra kii sandhi se bana he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - 'dhan kaa adhyayan'
 The systematic knowledge of human actions in relation to a subject is called the scripture of that subject, so in economics it is necessary to have systematic knowledge of the work related to human beings
 arthshaastra kaa prayog yah samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he ki arthvyavastha kis tarah se kaary karti he or samaaj main vibhinn virgon kaa aarthik sambandh kaisaa he
 Economical analysis is used in various fields related to society, such as: crime, education, family, health, law, politics, religion, social institutions and war etc
 pro
 samulson ke anusaar, The British economist Alfred Marshall defines the subject as 'a study of everyday life of mankind'
 marshall ne paaya tha ki samaaj main jo kuch bhi ghat rahaa he, uske peeche aarthik shaktiyaan hua karti hai
 That is why we need to understand its economic basis in order to understand the society and make it better
 leonnelle robinson ke anusaar aadhunik arthshaastra kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- Rarity means that the available resources are unable to meet all the demands and needs
 durlabhta or sansadhano ke vaikalpik upyogon ke kaaran hi arthshaastra kii praasangikta he
 Hence this topic studies options under the influence of motivators and resources
 arthshaastra main arthsambandhi baton kii pradhanta hona swaabhaavik he
 But we should not forget that the purpose of knowledge is not only to gain meaning, it is also to achieve welfare, happiness and peace for the world by searching for truth
 arthshaastra yah bhi batalaata he ki manushyon ke aarthik prayatnon dwaara vishwa main sukh or shanti kaise praapt ho sakati he
 Like all the scriptures, the aim of economics is also world welfare
 arthshaastra kaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he, yadhyapi usamen vyaktigat or rashtriya hiton kaa bhi vivechan rahata he
 It is possible that some people or nations become rich after studying this scripture and start exploiting other people or nations in the worry of becoming more rich, which disrupts the peace of the world
 parantu unke shoshan sambandhi ye sab kaary arthshaastra ke anuroop yaa uchit nahin kahe ja sakate, kyonki arthshaastra to unheen kaaryon kaa samarthan kar saktaa he, jiske dwaara vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi ho
 It is clear from this discussion that the simple definition of economics should be as follows - In economics, all the work related to the meaning of municipals is ordered in a systematic way
 uskaa dhyey vishwakalyaan he or uskaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he
 In which money related verbs are studied, it is called Arthashastra
 arthshaastra kii vishay-saamagree kaa sanket isaki paribhaasha se miltaa he
 Arthashatra is the science that studies the relationship between the natural alternative means of human use and their use
 arthshaastra kaa saiddhanthik evam vyavhaarik mahatv he
 The first book written on economics is Kautilya's Arthashastra
 arthshaastra bahut pracheen vidya he
 Four Upvedas were built in very ancient times
 in chaaron upavedon main arthved bhi ek upved mana jaataa he, parantu ab yah uplabdh nahin he
 Economics is also enumerated in the Vishnu Purana in the ancient and ancient 18 disciplines of India
 is samay barhospaty tathaa kautilia arthshaastra uplabdh hai
 Jupiter was the first Acharya of economics
 unka arthshaastra sutron ke rup main praapt he, parantu usamen arthshaastra sambandhi sab baton kaa samavesh nahin he
 Kautilya's Arthashastra is the only treatise available on the subject of Arthashastra, hence its importance is the highest
 acharya kautilya, chanakya ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the general secretary of Chandragupta Maurya
 inkaa granth 'arthshaastra' panditon kii raay main praaia: 2,300 varsh purana he
 According to Acharya Kautilya, the field of economics is to think of ways to obtain and protect the Earth
 unhone apane arthshaastra main brahmacharya kii diksha se lekar deshon kii vijay karne kii anek baton kaa samavesh kiya he
 Acharya Kautilya discusses in detail the things of colonization of cities, management of detectives, creation of army, establishment of courts, marriage rules, rules, methods of climbing the sutras, fortifications, differences of treaties, architecture, etc
 pramant: is granth kii kitni hi baaten arthshaastra ke aadhunik kaal main nirdisht kshetra se baahar kii hai
 In it, topics like politics, criminology, sociology, ethics etc
 have also been considered
 bhartiya samskruti main chaar purushaarthon main arth bhi sammilit he
 Aparigraha is preached in Jainism
 anek pracheen sanskrit granthon main dhan kii prashansha yaa ninda kii gayi he
 Bhartrihari has said, 'survey multiplied Kanchanam Ashrayante'
 chanakyasutra main kaha he- Economics developed in its present form in western countries
 adam smith vartmaan arthshaastra ke janmdata maane jate hai
 You wrote a book called 'wealth of Nations'
 yah san 1776 i
 main prakashit hua
 In this, he has stated that the objective of economics of every country is to increase the wealth and power of that country
 unke baad malths, ricardo, mil, jevans, kaal marks, sithvik, marshall, vaakar, tasig ore robins ne arthshaastra sambandhi vishyon par sundar rachanaayen kin
 But Professor Marshall owes a certain amount to the economics, although Professor Robbins differs from Professor Marshall in the area of economics
 paashchaatya arthshaastriyon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main teen dal nishchit rup se dikhaai padate hai
 The first team is of Professor Robbins, who does not accept economics as a science, to consider such things in economics as a guide to economic reforms
 doosraa dal profesar marshall, profesar pigu ityadi kaa he, jo arthshaastra ko vigyaan maanate hue bhi yah sweekaar karata he ki arthshaastra ke adhyayan kaa mukhya vishay manushya he or uski aarthik unnati ke liye jin jin baton kii aavashyaktaa he, un sabakaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But the economists of this party want to separate economics from politics
 teesraa dal karl marks ke samaan samaajwaadiyon kaa he, jo manushya ke shram ko hi utpati kaa saadhan maanata he or puunjipatiyon tathaa jameendaaron kaa naash karke mazdooron kii unnati chahta he
 He also wants the rule of workers
 teenon dalon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main bahut matbhed he
 Therefore it is necessary to consider this question: dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet yuddh chhid gaya
 This was not a war, but the world was divided into two parts
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan america, england, germany, austrailia, france, canada, spain ek taraf the
 All these countries were democratic and the policy of open economy was adopted here
 logon ko vyapaar karne kii khuli chhot thi
 There was an exemption for investing in the stock market
 in deshon main bahut sari bady-bady companiyaan baniin
 There was new research in these companies
 vishvavidhyalay, soochna praudyogiki, enginiyari udyog, bank aadi sabhi kshetron main jamkar tarakkee hui
 All these countries accepted the policy of promoting trade from other countries
 1945 ke baad se in sabhi deshon ne khub tarakkee kii
 On the other hand there were many more countries including Russia, China, Myanmar, East Germany, where the economic policy of socialism was adopted
 yahan par adhikansh udyogon par kadaa sarkari niyantran hota tha
 The government had the right over the profits from the industries
 saamanytah ye desh duusare loktantric deshon ke saath bahut kam vyapaar karte the
 Due to this kind of economic policy, there was not much competition in the industries here
 aam logon ko bhi laabh kamaane ke liye koi protsaahan nahin tha
 Due to these reasons, economic growth in these countries was very less
 3 oktober-1990 ko purv germany or pashchim germany kaa vilay hua
 United Germany, like progressive West Germany, adopted an open economy and democracy
 iske baad 1991 main soviet rus kaa vikhandan hua or rus sahit 15 deshon kaa janm hua
 Russia too adopted an open economy excluding socialism
 china ne samaajwaad ko puri tarah to nahin choda par 1970 ke ant se udaar nitiyon ko apanaaya or agle 3 varshon main bahut unnati kii
 Czechoslovakia was also a socialist country
 1-janvari-1993 ko iskaa check republic or slovakia main vikhandan hua
 These countries also abandoned socialism and adopted democracy and open economy
 mulya kii avadharana arthshaastra main kendriya he
 One way to measure this is the market price of the commodity
 adam smith ne shram ko mulya ke mukhya shrot ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 The "labor theory of value" has been proposed by many economists, including Karl Marx
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kisi seva yaa vastu kaa mulya uske utpaadan main prayukt shram ke baraabar hot he
 Most people believe that its value determines the price of the commodity
 daam kaa yah shram siddhanth "mulya ke utpaadan laagat siddhanth" se nikatataa se judaa hua he
 Demand, interpretation and forecasting of the price and quantity of goods sold in a fully competitive market are done with the help of demand supply
 yah arthshaastra ke sabase mulbhoot prarupon main se ek he
 It is used extensively for the development of large theories and formats respectively
 maang, kisi niyat avadhi main kisi utpaada kii vah maatra he, jise niyat daam par upabhokta khareednaa chahta he or kharidne main sakasham he
 Demand is usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and desired quantity
 aapurti vastu kii vah maatra he jise niyat samay main diye gayi daam par utpaadak yaa vikreta bazaar main bechney ke liye taiyaar he
 Supplies are usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and quantity of supply
 pro robins ke anusaar arthshaastra vah vigyaan he jo manushya ke un kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he jo icchit vastu or uske parimit sadhano ke rup main upasthit hote hai, jinka upyog vaikalpik yaa kam se kam do prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The following things are clear from this definition of economics - manushya apni ichchhaaon kii tripti se sukh kaa anubhav karata he
 Therefore every human wants to satisfy his desires
 ichchhaaon kii tripti ke liye uske paas jo saadhan, dravya ityadi hai ve parimit hai
 No matter how rich a person is, the amount of his money must remain finite; Then he can use this finite instrument material in many ways
 isliye upyukt paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main manushyon ke un sab kaaryo ke sambandh main vichaar kiya jaataa he jo vah parimit sadhano dwaara apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karne ke liye karata he
 In this way, it becomes necessary to discuss all the functions related to its consumption in economics
 isi prakaar manushya ko bazaar main anek vastuen kis prakaar kharidne kaa saadhan dravya parimit rahata he
 Through this finite instrument, how he buys his essentials, which item he buys or sells at what rate, at what rate, that is, how he regulates, all these things are considered in economics
 manushya jab koi vastu taiyaar karata he, iske taiyaar karne ke saadhan parimit rahete hai or un sadhano kaa upyog vah kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is natural to interpret all the work related to origins in economics
 manushya ko apane samay kaa upyog karne kii anek icchaayen hoti hai
 But time is always finite and can be used in many ways
 maan lijie, koi manushya so rahaa he, puja kar rahaa he yaa koi khel khel rahaa he
 According to Professor Rabin's definition, these works should be interpreted in economics, because the time spent in gold in worship or in sports could have been spent in any other work
 manushya koi bhi kaam kare, usamen samay kii aavashyaktaa avashya padati he or is parimit saadhan samay ke upyog kaa vivechan arthshaastra main avashya hona chahie
 Professor Robbins's definition of economics is so broad that according to it the interpretation of every work of human beings, whether it is religious, political or social, falls within economics
 is paribhaasha ko maan lene se arthshaastra, raajnneeti, dharamshastra or samajashaastra kii simaaon kaa spashtikaran baraabar nahin ho paata he
 The followers of Professor Robbins hold that according to finite means every aspect of human work has its economic aspect and this aspect is considered in economics
 ve kehete hai, yadi kisi kaary kaa sambandh rajya se ho to uskaa us pahalu se vichaar raajnneetishastra main kiya jaae or yadi us kaary kaa sambandh dharm se bhi ho to us pahalu se unka vichaar dharamshastra main kiya jaae
 Suppose a man is selling a commodity at a much higher price in Chorbazar
 saadhan parimit hone ke kaaran vah jo kaary kar rahaa he or uskaa prabhaav vastu kii utpati yaa purti par kya pad rahaa he, iskaa vichaar to arthshaastra main hoga; chorbazari karanevaale ke sambandh main rajya kaa kya kartavya he, iskaa vichaar raajnneetishastra yaa dandniti main hoga
 Whether this work is good or bad, it will be considered in sociology, ethics or theology
 or, yah kaise roka ja saktaa he, iskaa vichaar shaayad kisi bhi shaastra main na ho
 It is worth considering how far it is appropriate to consider any work from only one aspect
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha kii duusari dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vah arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan kii maanata he
 It contains only the rules that explain the relation of work reason at any given time
 paristhitiyon main kis prakaar ke parivartan hone chahie or paristhitiyon ke badalane ke kya tareeke hai, in gambhir prashnon par usamen vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki ye sab kaary vigyaan ke baahar hai
 Suppose, at some point of time, the number of people drinking alcohol in a country is increasing
 professor robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main keval yahi vichaar kiya jayega ki sharaab pinevaalon kii sankhya badhane se sharaab kii keemat, sharaab paidaa karanevaalon or swayan sharaabiyon par kya asar padegaa
 But there is no scope in his economics to consider the question whether drinking alcohol is good or bad and how can the habit of drinking alcohol be stopped by the government
 unke arthshaastra main maargdarshan kaa abhaav he
 Guidance is considered to be an important part of every scripture and this part is lacking in Professor Rabins 's definition of economics 
 is kami ke kaaran arthshaastra kaa adhyayan janata ke liye laabhakaari nahin ho saktaa
 Socialists want that capitalists and landlords do not exist, the government should be laborers and the government should have complete control over the economic condition of the country
 ve apni arthshaastra sambandhi pustakon main in prashnon par bhi vichaar karte hai ki majdoor sarkaar kis prakaar sthapit honi chahie
 How to eradicate the existence of landlords and capitalists
 majdoor sarkaar kaa sagathan kis prakaar kaa ho or unka sanghathan sansarvyapee kis prakaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, socialist writers make the field of economics so broad that many things of political science come into it
 hamako arthshaastra kaa kshetra is prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa chahie jisase usamen raajnneetishastra yaa anya kisi shaastra kii baton kaa samavesh na hone paae
 In relation to the field of economics, it is also necessary to consider Professor Marshall's definition of economics
 professor marshall ke matanusaar arthshaastra manushya ke jivan sambandhi saadhaaran kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he
 He examines the personal and social functions of humans, which are closely related to acquiring and using physical means for their welfare
 professor marshall ne munashya ke kalyaan ko arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main sthaan dekar arthshaastra ke kshetra ko kuch badha diya he
 But even this economist did not give any thought in his book regarding the goal of economics
 vartmaan kaal main paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ne arthshaastra kaa kshetra to badha diya he, parantu aaj bhi ve arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main vichaar karnaa arthshaastra ke kshetra ke adanr sweekaar nahin karte
 Now economics is being given the form of art
 sansar main sarvatra aarthik yojanaon kii charchaa he
 Formulating an economic plan is an art
 bina dhyey ke koi yojana taiyaar hi nahin kii ja sakati
 There is no single objective of those who formulate these plans, because economics do not have any definite goal
 prayek yojana kaa ek alag hi dhyey maan liya jaataa he
 Now ways of improving the condition of countrymen are also considered in economics, but the ultimate goal of improving this condition has not been decided yet
 sarvamaanya dhyey ke abhaav main arthshaastriyon main matbhinnata itani bad gai he ki kisi vishay par do arthshaastriyon kaa ek mat kathinata se ho paata he
 This divergence has created a major hurdle in the study of economics
 is baadha ko dur karne ke liye paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ko apane granthon main arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main gambhirthapurvak vichaar karnaa chahie or jahaan tak sambhav ho, arthshaastra kaa ek sarvamaanya dhyey sheeghra nishchit kar lenaa chahie
 Everyone in the world wants to be happier and avoid sorrow
 vah jaanata he ki apni ichha jab trupt hoti he tab sukh praapt hota he or jab ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Money helps in getting the desired item
 isliye prayek vyakti dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 He understands that happiness is achieved in the world only by money
 adhik se adhik sukh praapt karne ke liye vah adhik se adhik dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 In the worry of obtaining this wealth, he often does not consider how the money is being received
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki dhan aise sadhano dwaara bhi praapt kiya jaataa he jinase dusron kaa shoshan hota he, dusron ko dukh pahunchataa he
 In this way, many examples of obtaining wealth can be given
 poonjipati adhik dhan praapt karne kii chintaa main apane mazdooron ko uchit mazdooree nahin detaa
 This causes the condition of workers to deteriorate
 duukaandaar khaadya padaartho main milawat karke apane graahakon ke swasthya ko nasht karata he
 Many simple people are cheated by thieves, Mahajan ruins families of innumerable individuals by taking excessive interest from borrowers and excessive rent from landlord farmers
 prakruti kaa yah atal niyam he ki jo jaisaa bota he usko vaisaa hi kaatna padataa he
 Those who receive money by exploiting others or causing grief may forget this rule
 jo dhan dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hota he usase ant main du:kha hi miltaa he
 To expect happiness from him is futile
 yah satya he ki dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt kiya jaataa he usase icchit vastuen praapt kii ja sakati he or in vastuon ko praapt karne se sukh mil saktaa he
 But this happiness is temporary and eventually becomes a cause of sorrow
 sansar main aisi kai vastuen hai jinka upyog karne se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, parantu dirghakaal main unase dukh kii prapti hoti he
 For example, there is immediate pleasure from the consumption of intoxicating substances, but when they become habitual, then their intake starts in excessive quantity, which has a bad effect on health
 isse ant main du:khee hona padataa he
 The wealth gained by harming others certainly increases bad habits and by giving temporary happiness for some time it becomes a means of increasing grief
 dusron ko dukh dekar praapt kiya hua dhan kabhi bhi sthaayee sukh or shanti kaa sadhak nahin ho saktaa
 There are two types of happiness
 kuch sukh to aise hai jo dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hote hai
 Examples of these have been given above
 kuch sukh aise hai jo dusron ko sukhi banaakar prapt hote hai
 They create peace in human mind
 apana kartavya paalan karne se jo sukh praapt hota he vah bhi shanti prad hota he kartavyapaalan karte samay jo shram karnaa padataa he usase kuch ksht avashya maaloom hota he, parantu kaary puraa hone par vah du:kha sukh main parinat ho jaataa he or usasen man main shanti utpann hoti he
 This kind of happiness is not a means of sorrow in future and this type of happiness is called bliss
 jab anand hi anand praapt hota he tab du:kha kaa lesh maatr bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Such a condition is called ecstasy
 paramanand praapt karnaa prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he
 That is the peak of autism
 prayek manushya kaa kalyaan isi main he ki vah paramanand praapt karne kaa hameshaa praytn karata rahe
 He always enjoys happiness that does not become the cause or means of sorrow in future and he starts to experience peace and contentment
 jab ham apane prayatnon dwaara dusron ko sukh pahunchaate hai or unke kalyaan ke saadhan ban jate hai tab prakruti ke atal niyam ke anusaar inhen prayatnon dwaara hamaare kalyaan main bhi vruddhi hone lagati he
 The simple way to achieve autism is to become a means of welfare of others
 isi prakaar apane kaaryon dwaara kisi ko bhi du:kha na pahunchaana apane dukh se bachane kaa sabase saral tarika he
 Everyone should understand well that his true interest can only be proved by the benefit or charity of others
 isse yah spasht he ki dusron kaa sukh arthath vishwakalyaan hi apane sthaayee sukh or shanti arthath aatmakalyaan kaa ekmaatr saadhan he
 When every person will always try for the welfare of others for their welfare, then there will be no opposition to selfishness in any way, all kinds of conflict in the world will go away and everywhere happiness and peace will be permanently established
 aatmakalyaan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki prayek vyakti dusron ke swaarthon ko utana hi mahatv de jitna vah apane swaarth ko detaa he
 Just as he tries to increase his pleasures, similarly he should also try to increase the pleasures of others
 iskaa parinam yah hoga ki aise kaary band ho jaayenge jinke kaaran dusron ke du:khon kii vruddhi hoti he
 With this, there will be a continuous increase of happiness in the lives of the world and the welfare of the world will reach a growing climax
 bina vishwakalyaan ke kisi bhi vyakti kaa aatmakalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 True autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 aatmakalyaan hi prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he or jab arthshaastra manushya ke aarthik prayatnon kaa adhyayan karata he tab uskaa dhyey bhi aatmakalyaan hi hona chahie
 But, as stated above, true autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 isliye arthshaastra kaa dhyey vishwakalyaan hi hona chahie
 We have already told that when a wish is not fulfilled, then one experiences sorrow
 isliye yadi kisi vastu kii ichha hi na kii jaae to du:kha praapt karne kaa avasar hi na praapt ho
 Some gentlemen are of the opinion that the lack of sorrow and permanent happiness and peace can be achieved by the retirement of all desires
 isliye is drushti se dekha jaae tab to sab ichchhaaon kaa abhaav hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey hona chahie
 It is fine that through practice one can control desires, but to achieve such condition when any kind of desire does not arise, it is not practical for one of the ordinary person
 astu, arthshaastra kaa dhyey sampurna ichchhaaon ke abhaav ko maan lene se thode se vyaktiyon kaa hi kalyaan ho sakegaa or janata kaa usase kuch bhi laabh na hoga, isliye is dhyey ko maan lenaa uchit na hoga
 Some people believe that human welfare is the goal of economics
 ve jeevajantuon tathaa pashupakshiyon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak nahin samajhate
 They probably believe that God created animals and animals and birds for human happiness only
 isliye unako du:kha pahunchaakar yaa vadh karke yadi manushyon kii ichchhaaon kii purti ho sakati ho to unako du:kha pahunchaane main kuch bhi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 But theology and Mahatma Gandhi are of the opinion that every person should do such a work that interests the 'universal interest' i
e
 all the living beings, so that no one is harmed
 jab manushya prayek jeevadharee ke hit ko apane nijee hit ke samaan maanane lagata he tabhi usko sthaayee sukh or shanti praapt hoti he
 Mahatma Gandhi has named this route 'sarvodaya'
 is sarvoday maarg dwaara hi sansar main prayek prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho saktaa he, shoshan kaa ant ho saktaa he or vishwashanti sthapit ho sakati he
 The path of Sarvodaya is the best means to increase the welfare and welfare of every person
 isliye unke anusaar arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanavkalyaan na maanakar vishwakalyaan hi maananaa chahie
 In relation to the subject matter of economics, a description of economic activities is also necessary
 purv main utpaadan, upbhog, vinimay tathaa vitaran - arthshaastra ke ye chaar pradhan ang maane jate the
 In modern economics, these verbs can be divided into five parts
 aarthik kriyaaon ke uddeshy ke aadhaar par 1933 main sarvapratham reganar frrish ne arthshaastra ko do bhaagon main baanta
 International trade, foreign regulations, banking, etc
 are forms of macroeconomics
 sankshep main, adhyayan ke drushtikon se arthshaastra ke vibhinn angon ko ham is prakaar rakh sakate hai: It studies individual units, such as individuals, families, firms, industries, the value of a particular commodity
 boldig keanusaar, vyashti arthshaastra vishesh fermo, vishesh pariwaron, vaiyaktik keemton, mazdooriyon, aayon, vaiyaktik udyogon tathaa vishisht vastuon kaa adhyayan he
 It gives importance to marginal analysis
 aadhunik aarthik sinddhanth ke bahut se mahatvapurn vishay jaise antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinimay, rajasav, baking, vyapaar chakra, rashtriya aay tathaa rojgaar ke siddhant, aarthik niyojan evam aarthik vikaas aadi kaa adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 In Bolding's words, macroeconomics is that part of economics that studies the large groups and averages of economics, not its special items
 vah in samoohon ko upyogi dhang se paribhaashit karne kaa praytn karata he tathaa inke parsparik sambandhon ko jaanchata he
 In short, it is part of economics
 kence ke baad ke aadhunik arthshaastri ab kuch nae naamon se arthshaastra ke vibhinn angon kaa vivechan karte hai, jaise puunji kaa arthshaastra, poonji nirmaan, shram arthshaastra, yatayaat kaa arthshaastra, maudrik arthshaastra, kenciy arthshaastra, alp viksit deshon kaa arthshaastra, vikaas kaa arthshaastra, tulanatmk arthshaastra, antarrashtriya arthshaastra aadi
 In the modern period, postgraduate education in the subject of economics in the country and abroad is also given according to the papers of these names
 aarthik pranali ) ek aisi pranali he jiske antargat vibhinn vyavsaayon main kaam karke log apni jeevika kamaate he
 Each country adopts a different economic system to conduct economic activities smoothly
 aarthik pranaaliyon ko mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main baanta gaya he
 Socialism and capitalism are mentioned most in modern economic systems
 prayek desh, chaahe vah kisi bhi aarthik pranali ke antargat kaam karata he, usko vibhinn aarthik samasyaon jaise garibi, dhan va aay kii asamanta, berogari, mudrasphiti va mandi aadi kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai
 He adopts various policies to solve these problems
 mukhya aarthik nitiyaan is prakaar he
 India has its own special tradition of knowing, understanding and using economics
 yah du:kha kaa vishay he ki pracheen ev naveen bhartiya arthshaastriyon kii pramukh kritiyon kaa moolyankan uchit rup se abhi tak nahin kiya gaya he or hamaare vidhyaarthee keval paashchaatya arthshaastriyon evam unke siddhanto ko padhate rahe hai
 We derive the economic ideas of ancient times from the Vedas, Upanishads, epics, theology, the Grihasutras, the scriptures of Narada, Venus, Vidur and most importantly the Arthashastra of Kautilya
 aadhunik bharat main mukhya bhartiya arthshaastriyon main- This ideology of economics practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and used by Acharya Vinoba Bhave is very modern and is a unique gift of Indians
 iske atanrgat gramswarajya, swaavlamban, sashastitv ke prayog tathaa ahimsak kranti jaise vichaar hai, jo, jaiprakash narayan ke shabdon main, bharat main hi nahin, vishwa main kahin bhi kabhi bhi aarthik kanti laa sakate hai
 They are being used in India along with new education
 aadhunik arthshaastra aadhe se adhik ganitiya maadlon, saadhyon, samikarnon tathaa formulon main bandha gaya he
 Earlier, economists used to use statistics as a voluntary but now it has become mandatory for economics
 iske atirikt arthmiti bhi vikaas mahojidlon main purna viksit ho rahi he
 From 'in-put out-put analysis' to economics, economics has removed from 'game theory' and 'technical flow'
 aarthik siddhanton ko spasht karne hetu ganitiya aujaaron kaa prayog sab arthshaastri kar rahe hai
 Under Linear Programming and 'differentiation Process', economists are trying to show mathematical visual effects as well as invisible economic effects
 gananaa kii choti mashin se lekar vishaltam computer tak arthshaastriyon kii ganitiya pragati ke vyaavhaarik rup hai
 Probably, for the next two to three decades, such methods will be degraded by which only the conclusions will be obtained by mathematical methods very briefly and it will not be necessary to make any synergy of the process
 aajkal arthshaastri ganitiya arthshaastra paddati par sabase adhik nirbhar kar rahe hai
 Practical economics is solving practical problems of poor and resourceless countries
 gunar mridle krit asian drama sambhavat: marks ke das capital ke baad sabase bada arthshaastreey granth prakashit hua he jisamen alpaviksit deshon kii samasyaayen sulajhaai gai hai
 This ideology of economics has also emerged after the Second World War and it is also expanding rapidly
 isi ke antargat yojanakaran, puunji nirmaan tathaa videshi sahaayta jaisi vartmaan antarashtriya samasyaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The importance of economics is increasing rapidly
 sanyukt raashtra sangh aphake kii report, i
 ke anusaar arthshaastra par lagbhag 1,000 granth yaa lekh prati ghante vishwa main prakashit ho rahe hai
 After politics, economics occupies its place
 vastut: arthshaastra kaa prayog kalyaan ke hetu karnaa hi padegaa anyathaa keval bhautik saadhan jutaney kaa lakshya rakhkar ek din yah sabko le dubegaa
 It is a matter of satisfaction that economists are now beginning to understand this
 bharat kaa pracheen darshan is tathy ko prarambh se jaanata he ki keval bhautik sadhano kaa bahulya hi manushya ko sukhi nahin kar saktaa
 Prof
 Shumpeter has accepted in his latest article Economics in the future that no matter how much progress the economic analysis can make in principle, in practice it will always have to work for peace, happiness and welfare
 yadi arthshaastra samast maanav ke samaan kalyaan ke hetu kaary kar sake to iskaa bhavishya bahut ujwal hoga
 For this reason, the Nobel Prize on economics is now being given

 is prakaar dharmaprapti ke sadhano ko jaanakar anushthan ke liye paurvapary kaa bhi gyaan apekshit he evam fal ke liye anushthey agni hotradi karmon ke prakaran main purvang or uttarang sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he, jinke liye "prakruti" shabd kaa prayog hota he
 But there is no recitation of the Anga in the Sannidhi of the solar day
 us sthal par aakanksha ke udai hone par darsh poornmaas main pratipaadit angon ko lenaa hota he jise atidesh kehete hai
 
 saamaanya rup se nirnay hone par bhi kis karm se kis karm main ang kaa aagaman hota he, iskaa vivechan visheshatidesh se kaha gaya he
 In spite of the excesses of the limbs, due to the difference in nature, the text is read in place of Prakrit
 udaahranarth "agney twa jushta nirvpaami"
 In this Shrutivakya, by placing the Suryapada of "suryohyeshti" in place of fire post, "surya Tvajushtam Nirvapami" recites this shruti
 aise vaakya ko "ooh" kehete hai
 Without the knowledge of these things, it is not possible to understand which parts should be used where and how, so that the ritual can be properly fruitful
 jis sthal par ang pathit na ho vahaan anya sthal se ang laana chahie, kintu jo vikruti yag ke upkaar kar sakate hon ve hi prakruti main liye ja sakate hai
 Those who cannot do favors in deformity, there is no recitation of other organs
 or unka anushthan bhi nahin hota
 Such words are called "obstructions"
 kis ang kaa baadh hota he or kiskaa nahin, iskaa nirnay "ooh" baadh ke adheen he
 And the desired fruitful karma is only one
 kintu kahin kahin anek bhi hote hai
 Some organs are ritualized before the head and some are also performed after the head
 udaahranarth samidheni prayajadi tathaa swisht krit anuyajadi
 It has been said about using those organs at the same time or multiple times - ek baar prayog karne kaa naam tantra he or anek baar ke karne kaa naam "aavriti" athwa "awaap" he
 Somewhere the organs are ritualized by mechanism and elsewhere by frequency
 isliye tantra or awaap kaa vichaar bhi aavashyak he
 For a particular fruit, do the ritual of the head organ and also perform its organs
 un angon ko bhi anya angon kii apeksha hone par jiske prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use prasangi kehete hai
 It consists of the head mechanism, which is called context
 udaahranarth agnishtomic pashu purodashadi purvokt vishyon kaa purnagyata vyakti hi sangopang dharmanushthan kar saktaa he, jisaki vivechna "mimasaa darshan" main jaimini ne kii he
 The philosophy of this philosophy depicts the Dharmapramanas and depicts method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, conclusive sentences and strength
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 navam adhyay main mantroh, samoh or sanskaroh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he
 In Dasamadhyaya, there are three types of obstruction representations of distinction between earthlope, pratyamnaya and prohibition
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word symptom is a textbook isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 a tribunal is formed from many sutras, which consists of a principal sutra and other virtue sutras
 pradhan sutara purv paksh kaa pratipaadan karata he or anya sutara siddhant kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Somewhere the northeast side has been rendered by two sources
 aise hi kahin kahin par bina sutara ke hi purv paksh kaa utthapan karke sutara se siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Somewhere, in principle, the ex-party tax doctrine has been rendered by the undertaking
 ek paad main katipay adhikaran hote hai
 For example, there are eight tribunals in the first foot
 adhikaran main chha: padaarth hote hai - vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, siddhant prayojan or sangati
 Consistency is of three types - scriptural consistency, chapter consistency, and foot consistency
 pratham sutara - pratham adhikaran kaa naam jigyaasa adhikaran he
 Thought is the subject of science
 vichaar shaastra aarambh karne yogya he yaa nahin, yah sanshay he
 Not initiable, this is the former side
 siddhant he ki vichaar shaastra aarambh karnaa chahie
 The origin of this subject is the study method in the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and the teaching method in the "prabhakar" view
 purvapaksh main adhyayan kaa adrishy prayojan he or siddhant paksh main arth-gyaan-rup drusht prayojan he
 Since the religion of religion is related to philosophy, its interpretation in this school of thought is relevant
 is adhikaran main adhyayan drushtaarth hota he, yahi siddh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the basic method of thinking is the study method
 arthgyan kaa saadhan adhyayan vidhi se akshipt hota he
 That is why the beginning of the scripture is valid
 dwitiya sutara - dwitiya adhikaran main dharm kaa lakshan or pramaan he, jisaki kartavyata vidhivaakya se prathit hoti he
 He is a means of credit
 yahan shrey shabd se aihik or aamushmik donon arth abhipret hai
 Gumak is a legal proof in the religion
 jo nishedh dwaara pratipaadit hota he vah anarth kaa saadhan hota he, use hi adharm kehete hai
 Third Sutra - The third sentence is the proof of the law sentence
 yahan pratigya maatr kii gai he
 They are said to be of two types - "chodnaiv Symptom Yasya, Chodana Symptom Me Yasya" ie here the direct evidence is not proof from religion, but legalism is considered as proof in religion
 chaturth sutara - is sutara main pratham pratigya ke samarthan ke liye chaturth adhikaran he
 Characterization of the Lok Siddha direct evidence in this tribunal - "indriarthasanikarsjanyajanam gyanam pratham"
 arthath pratyaksh vartmaan sannikrusht ko hi grahan karata he or dharm utpadyman he, atev pratyaksh dharm main pramaan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki dharm bhavishyat kaalik he
 From these words, the philosopher has not even considered the evidential inference heat and economics
 pancham sutara - chaturth sutara main chaturth adhikaran kii pratham jigyaasa kaa samarthan karke pancham sutara ke pancham adhikaran main dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Law is the only proof in this tribunal, this pledge has been supported
 isi prasang main pramaanon kaa pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 That is, the knowledgeable material generates authenticity, and from the same material also becomes authentic
 vaakya do prakaar ke hote hai - loukik or vaidic
 Because of the proverbial sentence being masculine, malevolent delusions are accompanied by faults, pramad, vipralambha, karanapatava etc
, therefore, the sentence is not proof
 mantra brahmanatmak shabdarashi veda apaurushey he
 Therefore, due to not being illusory due to imperfection in legalism, legalism is the only proof in religion
 is dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan karne ke liye pramaan kaa lakshan or shabdaarth kaa sambandh nity he
 Badarayana has also not accepted transcendence in Pramanya
 padaarth-pratipaadan main sanket dwaara shabd se padaarthon kaa, vaakyarth-pratipaadan main granth kaa or rachana dwaara purush kaa tridha sambandh hota he
 The entry of the man into the Veda has been denied by assuming the words and the meaning of the word-reader-relationship regularly
 arthath, veda purush ke dwaara pranit hai -aisa kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki hamanen vaakyon ko bina vyakti ke kabhi nahin suna, padhaa yaa janaa he
 Whereas, in the opinion of the Mimansakas, the relation of the word and the word Ghatpatadi-meaning is constant
 atah 'ye pad is arth ko bataata he'- is baat kaa hamen pataa na hone par bhi pad apane pratipaadya ko bataata hi he
 That is, even if there is no Shakti Graha, there is only the ability of rendering in the verse
 or vaakyarth sambandh ke dwaara purush sambandh ko pruthak karne ke liye vaakyadhikaran kii pravriti he
 In this tribunal, as the substance of the verse has power, the sentence has power in the sentence, such is not required for those who render, because the substance present in the verse is discovered by aspiration, merit and attachment
 Renders vaiyaakaran mat se vaakyarth vaakyashakti se bhaasith hota he
 According to this opinion, the relation of substances in word sense is related to the connection of dignity
 yah naiyayikon kaa mat he, jisase vaakya kii vaakyarth main pruthak shakti kii pratiti hoti he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne abhihitanvay kaa samarthan kiya he
 Prabhakar has supported Anavitabhidhan
 is tarah vaakyarth main purush sandendh dwitiya prakaar se nirast hua
 The third type is through scripture
 sandarbh vaakya kaa purush ke saath do prakaar se sambandh hota he, ek kartri-karm-bhav-sambandh dwaara or dwitiya prayukt-pravachan-bhav-sambandh dwaara hota he
 The discourse is common and the composition is extraordinary
 asaadhaaran visheshan hota he
 Therefore Veda is Pourusheya
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar vedon main purush, desh, nadi, vriksh aadi ke nirdesh hone ke kaaran vedon ko purushpranit athwa paurushey kehete hai, kintu mimasaa darshan ke anusaar pravachan bhi asaadhaaran mana gaya he
 For example, the legend about "katasamhita" or "kat brahmana" is the legend that "sorrow" was studied completely by Maharishi among many branch chapters
 dwitiya hetu he ki veda main purush, nadi aadi kaa naam aata he, isse bhi veda paurushey siddh hota he, kintu yah kalpana chatur-buddhi-vihit nahin; kyonki praaia: sarvapratham sansaarik vastuon ke naam veda se hi aae hai, usee drushti se lok -naam kii parampara chali he
 That is, the Vedas do not consider history to be impermanent, but it represents the continuity of history, its detailed interpretation is visible in the "shabarbhyas" of the epistle
 nity vishay or vaakya athwa vachan ko yathanupurvi brahmarshigan samadhi main darshan karte hai, atev veda main purvapurush kartrutvkalpana kaa lesh bhi samavesh nahin he
 "cosmic creations are masculine due to their male special curiosity, such as Mahabharata, Ramayana etc
 kumaril bhatta ke anusaar adhyayan parampara anadi he
 Therefore, Vedas are also extraordinary
 aise hi adhikaran siddhant nyaay se hi veda granth rachana ke dwaara purush sambandh nahin ho saktaa, atev vidhi vaakya hi dharm main pramaan he
 There is no fundamental formula in the philosophy of epistemology
 yadhyapi uttarmimasaa ke '"ek evatman: sharire bhavat" is sutara ke bhashya main shankaracharya ne likhaa he ki "purv-tantra" main atmpratipadak sutara nahin he, is vachan ko kahkar aatm swaroop kaa vivechan kiya he
 Quoting the Vrittikārā मतa doctrine authentically, it is written: "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvam and sharike vakshyam:"
 abhipraay yah hua ki purvamimasaa bhi uttarmimasaa kii tarah advay aatma ko maanakar hi nirmit hue hai, tathaapi purvamimasaa sharir ke atirikt kartta-bhokta aatmatatv ko maanakar hi prachlit hua he, kyonki karm-siddhant ke antargat "kritahani" or "akrutabhyagam" nihit he
 And from here there is the accomplishment of rebirth etc
 "chodana punararambh:" "satsamprayoge purushasyendryanam" in donon sutron se aatmbeej kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 And Vapan etc
 is the sacrament of pod
 purusharth main purush shabd se asthi yajna or krit yag se aatma ko fal prapti hoti he
 Shabar Swami, without specifying the sutra, considered the "yagyayudh Sentence" as an instrument, refuting the opinion of the non-believer, and proved the form of self through logic and srutis, which also proved the Vedas authenticity
 uttar-mimasaa main aatma ko ek hi mana gaya he; kintu "sankhya yoga", nyaay, vaisheshik or purvamimasaa main aatma ko anek mana gaya he, jiskaa karm ke dwaara sharir, indriya or man se sambandh hota he
 Therefore, body, sense and subject are called bandhas
 ukt tray aatma ko bandhan main daalate hai, jisase aatma sukhdu:khadi dwandv ko bhogata he
 While doing routine katattavya buddhi to routine moral deeds, the creature keeps on consuming the destiny deeds
 sharir indriya se atirikt jo brahm buddhi se aatma kii upasna karata he uskaa sharir indriya aadi se sambandh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, aisa vyakti vartmaan sharir ke naash ke pashchaat swa swaroop main sthit ho jaataa he
 According to Uttarmimamsa, body, senses and subject have been called bonds which are the cause of ignorance; His retirement is salvation
 udaahranarth - "nivritiratma Mohsya Known purvamimasaa bhi yahi sweekaar karata he ki sharir, indriya or vishyon kaa sambandh hi bandhan hai, tathaa uskaa vilay hi moksh he, jiskaa saadhan, gyaan or karm samucchy he
 There are two types of enlightenment
 shariratirikt atmagyaan ritu kaa ang hota he, jo ni:shreyaskaarak he
 Vedic and temporal sentences have been interpreted by a number of thousands of sentences for judicial usable judgments
 atev bhartiya darshanon main pratham sthaan karm pratipadak purvamimasaa darshan kaa hi he
 Uttarmimamsa considers creation from ignorance and destruction of creation from enlightenment
 nyaay, vaisheshik darshan ne dvanukadi kram se mahabhoot paryant mahasrishti or mahabhoot se parmaanu paryant vinaash ko mahapralay kaha he
 That is, the entire gesture functions are generated in a double order and are destroyed from macro to nuclear
 panch mahabhuton main prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu ke parmaanu nity hai
 The sky itself is continual, but according to the earlier epistemology, there are two types of creation and three types of holocaust, in which the word Mahasrishti and Khand Srishti are called two creation
 aise hi pralay, mahapralay or khand pralay shabd se teen pralay kahe gaye hai
 Among them, Khandi Srishti and Khanda Pralaya have been considered similar to nowadays
 udaahranarth kisi sthal vishesh kaa bukamp aadi se vinaash ho jaataa he or kahin par naveen vastu kii sristi ho jaati he
 In Mahasrishti, the creation of atoms in the Panchamabhuta by the atom from the atoms in the Mahasrishti, which is mentioned in the tenth mandala of the Rigveda - matsaypuranadi main bhi khand pralay ke antargat vidyaman padaarthon kii sthiti kaa vivaran praapt hota he, kintu purv mimasaa mahasrishti or mahapralay ko sweekaar nahin karata
 According to him, no evidence is available in the destruction of all substances
 jaisaa ki vaarthikkaar ne kaha he - Mimamsa philosophy considers block creation and block holocaust
 bhartiya chha: aastik darshanon main nyaay, vaisheshik or vedant kii ishwar sadhak yuktiyaan praaia: samaan hi hai
 For example "yato va Imani Bhoothani Jayante", "dyavabhumi Janayan Dev Ek:" "vishvasya Kattra Bhuvanasya Gopta" through these Srutis and "janmadasya Yatra": This Vedanta Sutra proves God
 isi prakaar nyaay shaastra ke "kshityankuradik kartrujanrya kaaryatvat ghatavat" anumaan se bhi ishwar kii siddhi kii gai he, kintu vedantiyon ne shrutiyon se ishwar ko siddh kar anumaan pramaan ko unka sahakaari kaaran mana he
 And Naiyayikas have supposedly proved God to be the cooperative cause of Shrutis
 sankhya darshan main do mat hai - seshwar or nirishwar
 The Sesvara Samkhists believe in God, but treat him with a special word
 nirishwar sankhyavaadee ishwar kaa nishedh karte hai, "kintu vigyaan bhikshu ne "ishwarasiddhe:" is sutara main "pramanabhavat" is pad kaa ullekh kar ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 Mimamsa philosophy does not prohibit the support of God in the same manner as the Naiyayikas, and like the Nirishvara Samyakists, but in the "sambandesh Parihar" treatise, Kumaril Bhatt has resolved the meaning of God in relation to the word
 abhipraay yah he ki sambandh kaa karta ishwar nahin he
 By accepting the above words, it is popular that Mimamsak is an atheist
 kumaril bhatta, nandishwar aadi mimasakon ne anumaansiddh ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he or vedasiddh ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, Mimamsa accepts Siddha Brahma or God from the Veda
 kyaaki mimasaa darshan veda kaa swatah pramaan maanata he
 Mimamsa is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedantaka Uttermimansa
 isse bhi veydant kaa mimasaa ke sidbhant ar mimasaa kaa veydant ke siddhanth maanya hai yah baat spasht haati he
 Vedhita Yagadi Karma Dravya and Deity are compatible with these two
 dravya dadhyadi he or devtaa shastrake samadhigamya he
 That is, the sentence which the deity says is considered the deity
 yahan devtaa ke vishay main teen paksh dashamadhyay ke chaturthpad main or shabar bhashya aadi granthon main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The meaning deity is the specific deity and the word deity
 in teenon main antim paksh hi siddhant he, kyonki arth kaa samaran shabd ke dwaara hua karata he
 Therefore, because of the first appearance of the word, the word itself has been considered a deity
 udaahranarth "indraay swaha, takshakaay swaha" shabdon main indraay or takshakaay ye chaturthaant pad hi devtaa hai
 Even those who accept the meaning of the deity cannot ignore the word
 at: teenon pakshon main shabd mukhya hone ke kaaran mimasakon ne shabd ko hi devtaa sweekaar kiya he
 There is a rule here - the deity word which is in the method sentence should be pronounced in evacuation, renunciation and hymn, etc
, not its synonyms
 udaahranarth "aagneyamshtakapalam" main agni ke paryaayavachi "jatvedas" shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 It is known from the above things that the "word goddess" is the principle of Mimamsa philosophy
 devtaa ke vigrahadi sadasad bhav kaa vichaar - agni aadi devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch is darshan main maane jate hai
 That is, Vigraha, Havish, Bhoga, Aishwarya, happiness and fruitfulness are these five Vigrasha
 ukt vachan ke aadhaar par hi vedantiyon ne devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch swaroop maane hai
 The idea is that just like humans etc
, the taxes, steps etc
 are also of the gods, they accept Havish, eat and eat and give happiness to the Yajaman
 at: devtaa vigrahadiman hai
 The above thought is the same Yasak Maharishi has proved masculinity with the sentence "athakaar Chintanam" of "nirukta"
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar "shabdamayi devtaa" kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, kintu shabar swami ne apane shashth devataadhikaran bhashya main devtaa vigrah kaa khandan kiya he
 Generally, all the scholars like Parthasarathi, Khandadeva etc
 have followed this path, but in his commentary, Kumaril Bhatt has considered the deity as a part of it and not the deity as the head, and has accepted karma primarily and said that karma is the fruit
 gives
 swami ke rahete hue das se koi fal kii yachana nahin karata
 Karmana Phaljakantavam and Shabdmayi Devta, the above two principles have been supported by other minders by considering the deity Vigrahadi
 bhashyakaar shabar kaa devtaa vigrah kaa niraakaran prodhiwaad se jaananaa chahie
 Therefore, Purvimamsa accepts the "word goddess"
 uskaa gyaan, taddhit, chaturthi vibhakti or mantravarna in teenon se hota he
 The only difference between them is that with the frequency of the corresponding power, the deity realizes
 chaturthi vibhakti lakshanya or mantravarna adhishthan kaa bodhan karata he
 Mimamsadarsan has considered the part of the deeds of the deity in the above manner in terms of his ritualism
 vastutah devatashastra ta nirukt he
 Nirukta is Vedang and epistemology is Vedapang
 atah vaidic devataatatvavichaar ke prasang main nirukt ke vivechan kaa swatantra ar mukhya devataatatvavichaar maananaa avashyak haata he
 The realization through sentences is called sentence comprehension or word comprehension
 vaakya bhi aakhyaant hi hota he - Subantachaya: Sentence, Tingantachayavakyam, Suptingantachayo Sentam
 usamen ye teen paksh hai, jinamein karkanvit kriya honi chahie
 According to Amarkosh - "tidd
subant chayo sentence verb va karkhavitaita"
 arthath subant or tingant vaakyon kaa karkanvit kriya paryavsaan hota he
 The three views of Kumaril Bhatt, Prabhakar and Murari are famous in the East India, but in the last, a famous text with the name "tripad Niti Nayan" has also been known
 mimasakon main abhihitanvayavaad ar anvitabhidhanwaad naam se do prasthaan prasiddh hai
 Among them, first is the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and second Prabhakar
 shaabdh bodh main bhaavana ko mukhya rup se bhatta ne sweekaar kiya he
 Prabhakar has accepted the task as the main one
 abhihitanvay shabd kaa yah arth he ki padon se pratipaadit padaarth gyaan aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti samanvit hokar lakshana ke dwaara shaabdabodh karaate hai In the Nyayamat, there is power in the substance of the posts and the verses signify knowledge
 padon se padaarth kii upasthiti hoti he
 Similarly, it is said in Mimamsa, for example Jyotishtomen Swarga Kamo Yajet "
 yahan "yajet" main do ansh hai -"yaj" dhaatu or "t" pratyay
 The suffix represents the emotional sense of exposition
 us bhaavana kii teen aakankshaayen hoti hai - saadhyaakanksha sadhanakanksha or "itikartavyatakanksha"
 On attaining realization, there is a true discovery of heaven
 sadhanakanksha hone par dhatworth kaa kaarantven anvay hota he
 
 iti kartavyatakanksha hone par itikartavyatatven anvay hota he
 The sentence states that vishisht arth kaa bodh karne ke liye vaakya lok main prayukt hota he
 Padraavana leads to separate knowledge of substances
 yah vaacharth he, kintu jo padaarthagyan hota he vah shrota ko abhipret nahin or jiske liye vaakya prayukt hua usase shrota kaa kaary nahin hota, aise sthal main vaakya taatpary kii anutpatti hoti he
 Consequently, symptoms have been considered for prevention of deficiency
 sabhi darshanikon ne taatparyanupapatti ko lakshana kaa beej sweekaar kiya he
 Two types of meanings are considered, first meaning and second meaning
 pratham avaantar taatpary padaarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he or mahataatpary vaakyarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In aphorism, there is a sense of sentence by sentence
 kumaril bhatta ne nimna shlokon se pratipaadan kiya he - By this word, the form of Bhatt Padaka Orientalism is shown
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki "ananvitavasth" padaarth padon se abhihit hote hai
 Their discovery is only targeted
 atev "anvitabhidhanwaad" kumaril bhatta kaa he, kintu bhatta mat kaa anuvadak anvitabhidhanwaad maanakar jo khandan karte hai, yah uchit nahin he, kyonki unke granthon main uparyukt lekh kii charchaa kahin bhi nahin he
 This is what the word Anavitabhidhan means - the verses are called Anvirtha Bodhan
 atev pad shakti se hi padaarth or vaakyarth donon kaa bodh ho jaataa he
 There is no need to assume additional signs etc
 from the position of power
 vayovruddh purush kisi vastu ko laane le jane ke liye shabd kaa prayog karata he
 The child next to him understands the meaning of the word by hearing the word and seeing the other man carrying and carrying it
 yahi pravriti kaa kaaryatagyaan kaaran he
 In folk, action is also considered as action, similarly in Vedas, Yagadi action is considered as primary work
 yagadi kriya kshanik he or swarg kalantar bhavi he
 Therefore, the said Veda is considered as an object called "apurva," apart from the sentence discussion
 yahan par "ek kaary shabd" kii purvokt do shaktiyaan do arthon main sweekaar kerani padati hai
 One has to accept strength and the other is to be characterized
 usamen bhi alokik kaary main vishesh shakti he, jaisaa vidwaanon main prachlit he - In folk, there is a symptom in action form
 veda main pad hi vaakya hote hai or padaarth hi vaakyarth hota he 
 In this opinion, synonyms, anvay and sangaras are all synonymous
 arthath anvit hi anvay main nimitt hota he
 Prabhakar has considered customer eclipse, that proves investigative
 is mat main - "yajet swargkaam:" is vaakya se anvitabhidhan kaa shaabd bodh hota he
 In this darshan, there is only the provision of Yag for heaven
 swarg se abhipraay yah he - jo du:kha se grast na ho tathaa du:kha utpann kii usamen sambhaavna na ho or abhilaashaa ko purna kare use swarg kehete hai
 By means of sentences like "dashapurnamasabhyam swargakamo yajet" etc
, the instrument of heaven has been constituted by Darshanamasam Yag
 yag ko kshanik mana gaya he, kyonki kisi devtaa ke uddeshy se dravya ke tyaag kaa naam yag he
 "indray Idan Na Mama" renounces the psyche business with this sentence
 us kshan main us vyapaar kaa naash ho jaataa he
 The subject of imperfect love is called heaven
 vah kalantar athwa janmaantar main praapt hota he
 This is the rule of philosophy, reason must remain in the disorganized prior moment of Kayapatti, and transient yag birth is not possible in the haphazard predecessor of future self-consciousness
 etdarth ukt shruti ke aadhaar se yag kaa saadhy, swarg kaa saadhan athwa yag kii uttaravastha evam fal kii purvavastha, ye sab ek vastu siddh hoti hai, jise atishay, apurv, yaa yogyata kehete hai
 It has been elaborately analyzed by Kumaril Bhatt in Unreasonable Action
 yaganushthan ke purv purush main swarg ke upbhog karne kii yogyata nahin hoti
 Even before the rituals, there is no ability to give Swargadi fruit and by resolving the inefficiency of the man and the inefficiency of karma, the scriptural ability is now considered to be incomparable
 yatha This is called as pre-emptive or preplanned
 jahaan ek hi pradhan ho vahaan pradhan yag se jo apurv utpann hota use utpatypurv kehete hai
 The phenomena that arise from the organs are called Angaapurava
 angaporesv or pradhanapurv donon milakar parmapurv ko utpann karte hai
 From it, you get the fruit of Swargadi
 kuch yaagon main anek pradhanon se fal hota he
 For example - Darsha has three Yagas and Pournamas also has three Yagas
 yahan teenon pradhanon se utpann honevaale teen utpatypurvo se ek samudaya purv utpann hota he
 a pre-eminent arises from both communities
 abhipraay yah hua ki uparyukt pratham udhaaharan main teen apurv maane jate hai
 In the second example, preterm, premenstrual, preclinical and preclinical, four are considered incomplete
 ye hi mimasakon kaa sarvasv he
 In it Bhatt Mimansak Shabar Bhasya 2
 1
 2 according to "yagen Apurva Kritva Swarga Bhavayet", accomplishes Apoorva with words and with eloquence
 or use lingadi kaa vachya tathaa shabdabodh main mukhya visheshya maanate hai

 Chodanalakshanodharm: In the sutra - "naanu Athatabhumapayartha Bruyat Chodana", etc
, the meaning of the subject is explained
 "tachch abadhitatvan, arthnirutho dharm vishesh:, tasya gyanen niruprana"
 Chaudna Sutra's commentary "athaattva Bhootam Artha" refers to the non-objective meaningless religion, which is represented by knowledge
 atev pramanya ko gyananishtha kaha jaataa he
 That layer is generated and layer is admitted

 That is, the material from which knowledge is generated, does not originate from other material, and from which knowledge is acquired, from which knowledge is acquired rather than from other qualities, knowledge is acquired from knowledge
 isse yah aayaa ki gyanotpadak saamagree se bhinn saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or gyaan graahak saamagree se bhinn saamagree ke dwaara pramanya gruhit hota he
 In this opinion, there is both the primordial and the imperfect layer
 yah naiyayik sammat vivechna he
 In the above opinion, Mimansak people tell infidel dosha, due to which knowledge can never be proved valid

 Therefore, knowledge is self-generated and automatically acquired
 abhipraay yah he ki jis samagri se gyaan utpann hota he, usee saamagree se pramanya bhi utpann hota he; or jis saamagree se gyaan gruhit hota he usee saamagree se pramanya bhi gruhit hota he
 This is the self-authenticity of the Authentic Mimanskadikas, which Kumaril Bhatt has endorsed in his treatise Bhatta Vartika with many tips - yahan bhattamat main gyaan anumey he
 Something excessive arises in the subject of knowledge, from which it is known
 isse gyatata naamak ek dharm ghatadi vishay main utpann hota he, jise practyam, bhasana, prakaash: aadi shabdon se kaha jaataa he
 From this it came to be known that knowledge is derived from the presumption of gender

 We can refer to any of the following: chirsmmat yantriki main, islar ke ghurni sameekaran ghurni nirdesh tantra kii sahaayta se drudh pindon kii ghurnan gati kaa varnan karte hai
 The axis of the rotational frame taken in it is connected to that body and is parallel to the main inertia axes of the body
 islar sameekaran, sadish ardharakhik pratham order vaale saadhaaran avakal sameekaran hote hai
 The general form of Euler equations is the following- jahaan m lagaaye gayi balaghurna hai, i jadtwaghurna matrix he, ω mukhya akshon ke saapeksh koniya veg he
 The above equations in 3D main perpendicular axes form the following: jahaan Mk aropit balaghurna m ke ghatak hai, Ik mukhya jadtv aghurna aksh i ke ghatak hai or ωk koniya veg ω ke ghatak mukhya akshon kii disha hai
 Starting with the second law of Eiler, in an inertial reference system, the angular momentum l has a differential differential equal to the charged fault relative to time
 jahaan Iin jadtviya nirdesh tantra main pariklit jadtwaghurna pradeesh he
 Although this rule is universally true, it is not always helpful to solve for the speed of a normal rotational hard body
 chunki Iin or ω donon gati ke dauraan parivartit ho sakate hai
 Therefore, we change the direction of the system in such a way that it remains constant along the rotational body and selects such that its axes are located in the direction of inertial direction
 is nirdesh tantra main kam se kam jadtwaghurna pradeesh to niyat he, jo gananaa ko sugam banaata he
 As explained in the inertia, angular momentum jahaan Mk, Ik or ωk upar varnit kiye gayi anusaar hai
 In the rotational reference system, the time differential is se pratisthapit karnaa chaiye
 Where the following "rot" is representing the rotational instruction system
 jadtviya or ghurni nirdesh tantron main balaghurna se sambandhit vyanjak nimna he : Where q is the rotational direction, which is the perpendicular angular direction corresponding to an angular velocity vector v
 saamne ke chitra main r trigya, m dravyaman evam i jadtwaghurna vaali ek billiard kii gend ko teble ke samaantar is prakaar maarna he ki gend teble par bina sarake hue aage bade 
 In this we want to know at what height f from the base of the ball is applied so that there is no friction force, the ball moves forward without slipping, rolling
 kshaitij disha main lagaaye gayi bal f kaa balaghurna m = - f gend main ghurni twaran paidaa karata he- The fault negative is taken here because it is opposite to the rotation angle φ
 is sameekaran ke alaava, gend par lagaaye gayi bal f ke kaaran uske dravyaman kendra main twaran utpann hot he
 Therefore dhyaan dijiye ki twaran x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}}, teble ke samaantar tathaa bal kii disha main he
 To roll without slipping it is necessary to- is prakaar uparokt sabhi sameekaran milakar gend kii gati kaa teen charon h, φ, tathaa x main varnan karte hai
 Solving these equations together, we get the following information: kisi thos, samang gole kaa jadtwaghurna i = 2 5 m r 2 { \ displaystyle I={ \ tfrac {2}{5}}mr^{2}} hota he
 Keeping this value- r trigya, m dravyaman tathaa i jadtwaghurna vaala ek pahiyaa α kone par jhuke hue samtal par gurutveey twaran g ke prabh se lotni gati kar rahaa he
 
 chunki yah pahiyaa sthaanantarit bhi ho rahaa he, iske dravyaman kaa raikhik twaran bhi ho rahaa he
 In this problem we are assuming that the speed of the wheel is slipping
 atah nat-samtal or pahiye ke bich ek gharshan bal r utpann hota he jo pahiye ko ghumata he, kyonki is bal ke kaaran ek balaghurna m = -r r lagata he
 This force is taken negative because it is opposite to the rotation angle φ
 atah pahiye kii ghurnan gati kaa sameekaran nimnlikhit he- Now consider the displacement of the wheel's center of mass
 pahiye ke dravyaman mg kaa nat-samtal kii disha main avyav f kaa maan F=mgsin he
 This force is acting in the opposite direction to the force of friction
 atah newton kii gati ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar- Where x ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}} is the parallelogram acceleration of the wheel
 iske alaava, yadi loton gati bina phisale hue ho rahi he to x ̈ = − r φ ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}}=-r{ \ ddot { \ varphi }}} 
 Thus we obtained equations of motion covering three unknown quantities R, φ and x
 in samikarnon ko hal karne par hame yah praapt hota he- From this it can be seen that for a given side-angle α, the maximum acceleration occurs when the mass of the wheel is at most close to its axis
 
 Note that at the same level, if friction is zero, the acceleration of a body moving on it will be x ̈ = g sin ⁡ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {x}} = g \ sin}, which is the acceleration of the wheel More than
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki pahiye kii sthitij urja do prakaar kii gatij urja main badal rahi he- ghurnan kii gatij urja tathaa dravyaman kendra ke sthaanantaran kii gatij urja ; jabaki sarakate hue pind main keval ek hi gatij urja hoti he- dravyaman kendra ke sthaanantaran kii gatij urja } nirdeshaank: 27°53′N 78°04′E / 27
