45 amwa-alias-khaje-jahanpur is a village in Teghra, Begusarai, Bihar
 pablo neruda kaa janm madhya chili ke ek chote-se shahar paraal main hua tha
 His original name was Nephtali Ricardo Reis Basolta
 ve swabhaav se kavi the or unki likhi kavitaaon ke vibhinn rang duniya ne dekhe hai
 On the one hand, he has written poems of frantic love, on the other he is full of bitter reality
 kuch kavitaayen unki raajnneetik vichaardhaara kii samvahak nazar aati hai
 His first poetic collection 'twenty Love Poems and a Song of Desire' was published at the age of twenty
 neruda ko vishwa sahitya ke shikhar par virajman karne main yogadan sirf unki kavitaaon kaa hi nahin balki unke bahuaiami vyaktitv kaa bhi tha
 He was not only a poet but also a politician and diplomat and it seems that whenever he took the steps, a street full of adventure was in front of a road
 chile ke taanaashaahon ke kilaaf awaz uthaane ke baad unhen apni jaan bachaane ke liye desh chhodana padaa
 Wherever he took refuge in Italy, the administration had to play eyeball with the eye
 neruda kii vishwa prasiddh rachanaayen 'maachchu pichchu ke shikhar' or 'canto general' ne vishwa ke kai kaviyon ko prabhavit kiya or ashok vaajapeyi maanate hai ki unhone pachaas or saath ke dashak main bhartiya kaviyon kii soch par apni gahari chhap chodi thi
 In 1970, Salvador Allende formed a communist government in Chile, the world's first democratically elected communist government
 alende ne 1971 main neruda ko frans main chile kaa rajdoot niyukt kiya
 And in the same year he also received the Nobel Prize for Literature
 1973 main chile ke sainik general augusto pinoche ne alende sarkaar kaa takhta palat diya
 In this action, President Allende died and in the days to come, thousands of pro-allende ordinary people were killed by the army
 cancer se biimaar neruda chile main apane ghar main band is jansanhaar ke khatm hone kii prarthana karte rahe
 But 12 days after Allende's death, Neruda died
 sena ne unke ghar tak ko nahin baksha or vahaan kii har chiz ko tod phod kar ek kar diya
 As a result, some of his friends came out of this house with his funeral
 lekin sainik karfue ke baavjood har sadak ke mode par aatank or shoshan ke kilaaf ladanevaale is senaanee ke hazaron chaahane vaale kaafile se judate chale gaye
 The song of communist power that once again rose up from the traumatized songs that Neruda sang many times with these people - "no power can beat the united people

 There are mainly four river systems in India
 uttari bharat main sindhu, uttari-madhya bharat main ganga, or uttar-purv bharat main brahmaputra nadi pranali he
 The rivers Narmada, Cauvery, Mahanadi, etc
 form a wide river system in peninsular India
 yahan bharat kii nadiyon kii ek suchi di ja rahi he: surma-meghna-barak River Family Wide Basin in Bangladesh and India mahabharat yuddh se purv guru dronacharya anek sthano main bhraman karte hue himalay phuche
 There is a Swayambhu Shivling called Tapeshwar in a divine cave on the banks of the Tamsa River
 yahan guru dronacharya or unki patni mata kripi ne shiv kii tapasya kii
 Pleased with his penance, Lord Shiva gave him the boon of having a son
 kuch samay baad mata kripi ne ek sundar tejashvi baink ko janm diya
 At the time of taking birth, there was a sound of snickering from his throat, which gave him the name Ashwatthama
 janm se hi ashwatthama ke mastak main ek amuly mani vidyaman thi
 Which kept him fearless from the monster, demon, weapon, disease, deity, serpent etc
 mahabharat yuddh ke samay guru dronacharya ji ne hastinapur rajya ke prati nishtha hone ke kaaran kauravon kaa saath dena uchit samajha
 Ashwatthama, like his father, was expert in scripture and weapons education
 mahabharat ke yuddh main unhone sakriy bhaag liya tha
 He was a general of the Kaurava side in the Mahabharata war
 unhone bhim-putr ghatotkach ko parrast kiya tathaa ghatotkach putr anjanparva kaa vadh kiya
 Apart from this, Drupadkumar, Shatrunjaya, Balanik, Jayaniik, Jayashva and King Shrutahu were also killed
 unhone kuntibhoj ke das putron kaa vadh kiya
 The father-son duo dispersed the Pandava army during the Mahabharata war
 pandavon kii sena kii haar dekhkar shrikrishna ne yudhisthir se kootneeti sahaara lene ko kaha
 Under this scheme, it was spread that "ashwatthama was killed"
 When Guru Dronacharya asked Dharmaraja Yudhishthira to know the truth of Ashwatthama, he replied - "ashwatthama was killed but an elephant", but he shouted "but the elephant" Said, and survived by lying
 is ghatana se purv pandavon or unke paksh ke logon kii shri krishna ke saath vistrut manthana hui ki ye satya hoga ki nahin ki "parantu hathi" ko itane swar main bolaa jaae
 At the same time Sri Krishna performed Shankhanad, the noise of which Guru Dronacharya could not hear the last words
 apane priy putr kii mrityu kaa samachar sunakar aapane shastr tyaag diye or yuddh bhoomi main aakhen band kar shok avasthaa main baith gayi
 Knowing Guru Dronacharya's disobedience, Draupadi's brother Dushtadyumna cut his head with a sword
 guru dronacharya kii nirmam hatya ke baad pandavon kii jeet hone lagi
 In this way, the Kauravas were destroyed by Arjun's arrows and Bhimsen's mace in the Mahabharata war
 dusht or abhimaani duryodhana kii jaangh bhi bhimsen ne mallayuddh main tod di
 On seeing such condition of his king Duryodhana and remembering the death of his father Dronacharya, Ashwatthama became impatient
 duryodhana pani ko bandhane kii kala jaanata tha
 So the pond near which Gadayudhud was running, entered the same pond and hid it after damaging the water
 duryodhana ke paraajay hote hi yuddh main pandavo kii jeet pakki ho gai thi sabhi pandav kheme ke log jeet kii khushi main matvaale ho rahe the
 Ashwatthama used the Narayan weapon on the Pandavas to avenge the merciless killing of his father after Dronacharya's slaughter
 jiske aage sari pandav sena ne hathiyaar daal diya tha
 After the war Ashwatthama killed Draupadi's five sons and Dushtadyumna
 ashwatthama ne abhimanyu putr parakshit par bahmshirsh astr kaa prayog kiya
 Ashwatthama is immortal and is still alive
 bhagwaan krashna ke shraap ke kaaran ashwatthama ko code rog ho gaya
 He is still alive today
 chup kar vah pandavon ke shivi main pahunchaa or ghor kaalaratri main kripacharya tathaa kritavarma kii sahaayta se pandavon ke bache huye vir mahaarathiyon ko maar daalaa
 Not only this, he also beheaded the heads of the five sons of the Pandavas
 ashwatthama ke is kukarm kii sabhi ne ninda kii yahan tak ki duryodhana tak ko bhi yah acha nahin laga
 Unhappy with the killing of sons, Draupadi started mourning
 uske vilaap ko sun kar arjuna ne us neech karm hatyare brahman ke sir ko kaat daalane kii pratigya kii
 Hearing Arjuna's promise, Ashwatthama escaped
 shrikrishna ko sarathi banaakar evam apana gandiv dhanush lekar arjuna ne uskaa peechha kiya
 If Ashwatthama could not get protection anywhere, due to fear, he used Brahmastra on Arjuna
 ashwatthama brahmastra ko chalaanaa to jaanata tha par use lautaanaa nahin jaanata tha
 Seeing that very fiery fiery fire coming towards him, Arjuna pleaded with Shri Krishna, “O Janardhana! You are the God who created this three-dimensional vision
 shrrishti ke aadi or ant main aap hi shesh rahete hai
 You are the ones who incarnate to protect your devotees
 aap hi brahmaswaroop ho rachana karte hai, aap hi vishnu swaroop ho paalan karte hai or aap hi rudraswaroop ho sanhaar karte hai
 You tell me, where is this fierce fire coming from me and how will it protect me? " shrikrishna bole, “he arjuna! tumhaare bhay se vyakul hokar ashwatthama ne yah brahmastra tum par brahmastra se tumhaare praan ghor sankat main he
 That Ashwatthama knows its use but is unaware of its prevention
 isse bachane ke liye tumhen bhi apane brahmastra kaa prayog karnaa hoga kyon ki anya kisi astr se iskaa nivaaran nahin ho saktaa
 ” shrikrishna kii is mantranaa ko sunakar maharathi arjuna ne bhi tatkaal aachman karke apana brahmastra chhod diya
 The two Brahmastras clashed together and a fierce fire arose and heated the three worlds
 unki lapaton se sari praja dagdh hone lagi
 Seeing this destruction, Arjuna returned and pacified both Brahmastras and pacified Ashwatthama and tied him
 shrikrishna bole, “he arjuna! dharmatma, soye huye, asaavdhaan, matvaale, pagal, agyani, rathhin, stri tathaa balak ko maarna dharm ke anusaar varjit he
 It has behaved against religion, killing sleeping innocent children
 jivit rahegaa to punah paap karegaa
 So immediately fulfill your vow by slaughtering it and placing its severed head in front of Draupadi
 ” Even after hearing these words of Shri Krishna, Dhirwan Arjuna took pity on Guruputra and took Ashwatthama alive in the camp and presented him before Draupadi
 pashu kii tarah bandhe huye guruputr ko dekh kar mamtamayi draupadi kaa komal hriday pigal gaya
 He saluted Guruputra and asked Arjuna to release him, “O Aryaputra! These are Guruputras and Brahmins
 brahman sadaa poojaneey hota he or uski hatya karnaa paap he
 You have gained knowledge of these unique weapons from his father
 putr ke rup main acharya dron hi aapke sammukh bandi rup main khadey hai
 By killing them, their mother Krupi would be like me, mourning and mourning her son
 putr se vishesh moh hone ke kaaran hi vah dronacharya ke saath sati nahin hui
 Kripi's soul will continue to curse me
 inke vadh karne se mere mrit putr laut kar to nahin aa sakate! atah aap inhen mukt kar dijiye
 ” draupadi ke in nyaay tathaa dharmayukt vachanon ko sun kar sabhi ne uski prashansa kii kintu bhim kaa krodh shant nahin hua
 On this Sri Krishna said, "O Arjuna! According to the scriptures, slaughter of impure Brahmin is also a sin and not punishing the terrorist is also a sin
 atah tum vahi karo jo uchit he
 "realizing his point, Arjun cut Ashwatthama's head with his sword and took out the gem of his forehead
 mani nikal jane se vah shrihin ho gaya
 He was dead at the same moment when he had killed the boys but due to the shaving of the hair and leaving the gem, he became even more Mr

 arjuna ne use usee apamaanit avasthaa main shivi se baahar nikaal diya
 Ammeter or 'ammometer' is a device used to measure the current flowing in a branch of a circuit
 bahut kam maatra vaali dhaaraon ko maapne ke liye prayukt yuktiyonko "milliametre" yaa "micrometre" kehete hai
 The earliest design of the ammeter was d'arsonal's currentmeter or moving coil currentmeter
 san 1820 i
 main ampiore ne avishkaar kiya ki yadi kisi chaalak ko, jisamen vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae, to usapar ek bal kaary karata he
 The value of this force is equal to the product of the intensity of the magnetic field, the current and the length of the conductor
 is bal kii disha fleming ke baayein haath vaale niyam se gyaat kii jaati he
 Spread the thumb of your left hand, the finger near it and the middle finger of the middle in such a way that all three are perpendicular to each other
 yadi tarjani chumbakeey kshetra kii disha main or madhyamaa vidyutdhara kii disha main sanket karen, to chaalak kii gati anguthe kii disha main hogi
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 yadi kundali kaa vikshep kone tha ho, to dharaman nimna sutara se nikalataa he : That is, the current is proportional to the angle of deflection
 ye dharamapi atyant sthaayee or yathesht sugranhak hote hai
 They can measure current up to 10 amperes
 chalkundal dharamapi mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : In this, the coil is wrapped on a metal structure, which causes the coil to deflect quickly as the current flows
 jaise hi kundali gumti he, usamen or uske dhaatu ke dhaanche main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or kundali ko roak detii hai
 The horoscope does not oscillate, this is why this instrument is called dead-pulse
 dhara ke hatate hi kundali apni purv sthiti main pahunch jaati he
 Therefore, the value of the current can be determined very easily by the knowledge of the position of the coil and the position of the current
 is dharamapi main kundali ek achaalak dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or is kaaran usamen bhavar dhara nahin utpann hoti
 Hence there is very little resistance in the coil deflection
 kundali dhaatu ke dhaanche par aavisht na hone se dhara pravaahit kiye jane par, apni vikshepasthiti ke donon ore dolan karti he
 It is very sensitive and we can determine the transient charge before it is very accessible
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : aakarshanwale tathaa pratikarshanwale
 If current flows through a stationary coil of insulating wires, a magnetic field is produced in and around the coil
 is kundali ke paas yadi kachche lohe kaa ek tukdaa lataka diya jaae, to vah kundali kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 If this iron piece is fitted with an indicator, the indicator will also be deflected
 yadi koi aisi vyavastha ho ki lohe ke tukade par jo aakarshan bal he uske vipareet bal lagaakar use santulan main laayaa ja sake, to dhara kaa maan sanketak ke vikshep se pataa chal sakegaa
 Often this attraction is opposed by a spiral spring
 aakarshan bal dhara-maan ke varg ke samaanupati hota he
 Therefore the deflection of the indicator will also be proportional to the square of the current value
 isi kaaran yah prayavarti dhara kaa maan bhi gyaat kar saktaa he
 Between the stationary coils of several wheels of insulating wires, two soft iron thin rods are parallel to the axis of the coil
 ek chad to sthir rahata he, doosraa ek sanketak se judaa he jo swayan ek keel par laga he
 The other end of the indicator rotates on a dial
 jab kundali main dhara pravaahat hoti he, tab donon chad ek hi prakaar ke prerit chumbak ho jate hai
 According to magnetic laws they have repulsion and the iron attached to the indicator rotates, causing a deflection in the indicator
 isamen bhi vikshepanakon dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 These instruments are very simple and cheap
 jab naapane main bahut yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or anek pusht yantron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tab isi siddhant par bane ameter or voltmapi prayog main laae jate hai
 In power houses, soft iron devices are mostly used on switchboards
 prerit chumbak main aakarshan yaa pratikarshan dharapravaah kii disha par nirbhar nahin hota
 The force is proportional to the square of the torrent
 is kaaran dhara pravaah kii disha kuch bhi ho, bal kii disha ek hi hoti he
 For these reasons, these instruments are used to measure both direct current or reverse current
 kundali ke prerakatv ke kaaran ye ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara ke maapnkaarya main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 This type of ammeter depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise emeter dishtdhaara athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 This effect has been used in two ways in the measurement method: pehle prakaar kaa yantra sabase pehle 1883 main major kardyu ne banaaya tha
 hartmann-bron improved it
 taar main dhara bahati he or tapt hone ke kaaran usamen prasar hota he
 At this time, the segmental wire attached to the middle pulls the wire and the pulley rotates according to the spread
 saath hi saath ghirani main laga sanketak bhi vikshepit hota he or dhara kaa maan dial par darshit karata he
 In the absence of current, the wire gets cold and shrinks and the indicator then returns to its former state
 aise dharamapi saral or saste hone ke kaaran bahut prayog main laae gaye hai
 They do not have a coil, so they do not have inductance and a high frequency alternating current is also measured, but they are not sufficiently accurate and are unable to tolerate high currents
 inase adhik suvidhajanak or yatharth taapyugma vaale dharamapi hote hai
 Nowadays, high frequency alternating current is mostly measured by the same instruments
 dhara taar se pravaahit hokar use tapt karti he
 The confluence of the copper constanton temperature coupled to this wire is also heated
 is kaaran taapyugma main taap ke anupaat main vidyut vaahak bal utpann hota he
 It flows in a direct currentometer

 kabhi haan kabhi naa naam se lekh:- Binoculars, field glasses or binocular telescopes are similar or mirror symmetrical telescope-pairs, which are side-mounted and positioned precisely to look in one direction
 ek sadhran dwinetri doordarshee, gallileo kism ke do doordarshiyon kaa yugma hota he
 Binoculars are used to view earthly objects, so it is necessary that in this type of binoculars a direct reflection of the object is made
 galileyon kism ke doordarshee sidhaa pratibimb banaate hai
 Therefore, similar binoculars are used in the construction of ordinary binocular telescopes
 saadhaaran dwinetri doordarshee ko natya doorabeen kehete hai
 Unlike telescopes, binoculars offer a three-dimensional image to the user: when viewing relatively close objects, the viewer presents images from a slightly different perspective to both eyes that together combine the depth effect
 monocular telescope ke vipareet isamen bhram se bachane ke liye ek aankh ko band athwa dhakne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he
 The use of both eyes increases the visual acuity significantly and the same is true for distant objects where the depth perception is not clear
 sabase pehla dwinetri doordarshee san 1608 main leparhe dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya
 This device was a pair of telescopes of two parallel axes
 gallileo kism ke doordarshee main do mukhya dosha hote hai : 1
 Its field of view is not wide and 2
 isaki aavardhan kshamta adhik nahin hoti
 Telescopes of the Kepler variety are called astronomical telescopes
 drushtikshetra ke vistaar or aavardhakata kii drushti se kepler doordarshee gallileo doordarshee se acha hota he, kintu kepler doordarshee kaa upyog dwinetri doordarshee banane main isliye nahin ho saktaa tha ki usamen pratibimb ulataa banataa he
 Porro created a tripartite combination that can show the inverted reflection in the Kepler telescope by perpendicular to it in both the horizontal and vertical directions
 dwinetri upkarnikaon ke vikaas main poro kaa ukt avishkaar bada mahatvapurn he
 In the trilateral combination of Poro, two right angled trilateral are connected in such a way that their hypotenuse surfaces are in contact with each other and their entire reflection pages are reciprocal
 poro ke baad aibe ne triparshv yogicon ke prashn par vishesh rup se vichaar kiya
 Abe's research has had a significant impact on the development of the modern Tripartite binocular

 These trilateral spheres lie between the appendage and the appendage of the telescope
 triparshvi dwaara jis prakaar kshaitij or urdhvadhar dishaao main pratibimb ko sidhaa kiya jaataa he, vah chitra 1

 The light emanating from the object collides on the first trilateral after passing through the visible layer 1
 is triparshv kii vartak kor urdhvadhar hoti hai, jisase vah pratibimb ko kshaitij dharaatal main sidhaa kar detii he
 After coming out of the first tripartite, the light rays fall on the second tripartite, whose turn core is in a horizontal position
 isse urdhvadhar dharaatal main pratibimb sidhaa ho jaataa he
 After coming out of the second trilateral, the light rays enter Subnar Le2
 upanetra dwaara is sidhe pratibimb kaa aavardhan hota he
 The length of the tube of the telescope is reduced considerably due to the trilateral
 yah do sookshmdarshiyon kaa yugma hota he jisamen triparshwo kii sahaayta se pratibimb ko sidhaa kiya jaataa he
 Its specialty is that it experiences solidity of objects
 do nearesth vastuon kii duuri athwa gaharaai kaa anubhav netra or vastuon ke antar par nirbhar karata he
 There is some difference in the reflections formed on the retinas of both the eyes and due to this variation one experiences depth or solidity
 trivimadrushti kaa paraas 1,250 se 1,600 gaj tak hota he
 Generally, two photographs of the same object are placed in a stereoscope in such a way that they begin to experience the solidity of the substance
 aakhon ke bich kii duuri jitani hoti he utani hi duuri par sthit do lenson se vastu ke do photo le liye jate hai
 Now both these photos are arranged in such a way that the right eye can only see the photo taken from the right lens and cannot see the other photo
 isi vyavastha ko trivimdarshi kehete hai
 It seems that with the invention of the telescope in the 17th century, the benefits of binocular vision derived from two such telescopes came to be discovered
 sabase shuruaati doorabine gallilian prakaashiki kaa prayog karti thim; ve ek uttal objective lens tathaa avatal ipis lens kaa prayog karti thim
 The advantage of Galilean design is that the image obtained is straightforward but the field of view is narrow and its magnification is not very high
 is prakaar ke nirmaan kaa prayog abhi bhi kaaphi saste modelon main tathaa opera glasson va theatre glasson main kiya jaataa he
 a better image and higher magnification can be obtained using Keplerian optics, in which the image obtained from the objective lens is viewed with a positive eyepiece lens
 is vinyas kaa ek nuksaan yah he ki praapt chhavi ulti hoti he
 There are many ways to overcome these shortcomings
 poro prism doorabeenon kaa naam italy ke prakaashiki vidvan ignazio poro ke naam par rakhaa gaya he jinhone is chhavi sudhaar pranali ko 1854 main patent karavaaya or baad main karl zius jaise nirmaataaon dwaara 1890 ke dashak main isamen sudhaar kiya gaya
 This type of telescope uses a z-shaped double poro prism configuration to straighten the image
 is vishistataa ke prayog se chaudee doorabeenon ko aise objective lens ke saath bana paanaa sambhav hota he jo kaaphi dur hote hai kintu ipis dwaara samyojit hote hai
 Another advantage of Poro prism design is that they shorten the light path due to which the actual length of the telescope is smaller than the focal length of the objective lens and the depth of distance between the two objects gives a better sense of depth 
 esile victor emil dobres dwaara 1870 main di gayi dizine ke parinamswarup ruf prism aadhaarit doorabine aayin
 Most roof prism-based telescopes use either the abbe-könig prism or the schmidt-pechon prism to straighten the image and shorten the light path
 inamen aise objective lens hote hai jo ipis kii lagbhag sidh main hote hai
 Roof prism design allows the manufacture of such devices which are thinner and smaller than the poro prism
 yahaan chhavi kii chamak main bhi antar aata he
 Porro prism-based telescopes achieve a much brighter image than roof-prism based telescopes with the same magnification, object size, and equivalent optics quality, this is because the surface surface used in the roof prism design is that of light
 Reduces transmission from 12% to 15%
 ruf prism dizine vaali doorabeenon ko apane prakashkeey tatwon ke sarekhan main adhik sookshmata kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such a situation, their price increases because their design is based on setting them at a higher collimation with certain components in the factory itself
 poro prism vaali doorabeenon main unke prism ko kabhi kabhi punahrekhit karnaa hota he jisase ki colimation ko punarprapt kiya ja sake
 The roof design with a stable crossing means that they will usually never need collimation again
 doordarshee kii dizine aamtaur par vishisht anuprayog ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These different designs produce certain optical parameters
 These parameters are: ipis kii focal lambaai ko objective kii focal lambaai se vibhajit karne par praapt anupaat doorabeen kii rekhiy aavardhan shakti kehalaata he 
 udhaaharan ke liye aavardhan shakti 7 ke gunak main hone kaa arth yah hota he maano dekhne vaala vyakti dekhi ja rahi vastu ko 7 guna nikat se dekh rahaa ho
 The amount of magnification depends on what application the telescope is made for
 chunki haath main pakad kar prayog kii jane vaali doorabeenon main aavardhan kam hota he atah ve kampan ke prati kam samvedansheel hoti hai
 Visible magnification makes the visual field smaller
 objective lens kaa vyas yah nirdhaarit karata he ki ek chhavi banane ke liye kitna prakaash ekatrit kiya ja saktaa he
 This number directly affects performance
 jab aavardhan or gunvattta baraabar hoti hai, doorabeen kii duusari sankhya jitani badi hoti he, praapt chhavi tani hi ujjwal tathaa spasht hoti he
 Thus images obtained by an 8X40 will be brighter and clearer than an 8X25, although both will magnify an image only eight times
 8x40 main saamne ke bade lens prakaash ke bade punj utpann karenge jo ipis main jaayenge
 is prakaar 8x40 se dekhnaa ek 8x25 kii tulana main adhik aaramdaayak hoga
 It is usually expressed in millimeters
 prathagat rup se doorabeenon kaa shreneekaran aavardhan x objective ke vyas ke rup main kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye 7X50 
 The field of view of a telescope is determined by its optical design
 ise rekhiy maan se vyakt kiya jaataa he, jaise 1000 gaz se dekhne par kitne feet chaudaai dikhaai degi, athwa kitne degree kaa koniya maan dekha ja saktaa he
 The telescope concentrates the light received by the object as a mass, the exit pupil whose diameter is obtained by dividing the diameter of the object by the magnifying power
 sabase acchhee prakaash grahyata tathaa ujjwal chhavi ke liye exit pupil kaa vyas ek puri tarah faili maanviya aankh kii putali ke aakaar kaa hona chahie jo lagbhag 7 mimi hota he tathaa aayu ke saath kam hoti jaati he
 If the light cone emanating from the telescope will be larger than the size of the pupil of the eye into which it has to enter, then any light other than the size of the pupil will be wasted, meaning the eyes will not get any information through it
 The pupil of the eye expands about 3 mm during the day, which is equivalent to the exit pupil of the 7X21 telescope
 adhik bade 7x50 doorabeen putali se zyada bade prakaash shanku kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo ki din ke samay vyarth ho jaati he
 Therefore, carrying a large device does not seem particularly useful
 However, a large exit pupil makes it easier to position the eye from where it can receive light: the eye can be placed anywhere in the light cone
 aankh lagane kii yah aasaani chhavi ko aspasht hone se bachaati he, jo ki prakaash kaa maarg aanshik rup se avaruddh hone par kaalepan athwa dhundhalepan ke rup main ho saktaa he
 And, it also means that the image can be found quickly which is important when viewing more dynamic games of birds or animals
 sankeern exit pupil vaali doorabine shighrata se thakaa sakati hai kyanki sahi chhavi praapt karne ke liye upkaran ko thik ankhon ke saamne hona chahie
 Finally, many people use their binoculars in the evening, during twilight, and at night when their pupils are large
 is prakaar din ke samay kaa exit pupil hameshaa sabase upyogi maanak nahin hota he
 Large telescopes with large exit pupils are a satisfying choice for convenience, ease of use, and variation in applications, although their potential may not be fully utilized during the day
 ai relif pichley ipis lens se eczit pupil athwa netra bindu ke bich kii duuri ko kaha jaataa he
 This is the distance a viewer has to place between his or her eye from the eyepiece so that he or she can get a clear image
 ipis kii focal lambaai jitani badi hogi, ai relif utani hi adhik hogi
 Eye relief in binoculars can range from a few millimeters to 2
5 centimeters or more
 chashma pahanane waalon ke liye ai relif vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hoti he
 The eye of the person wearing glasses is usually away from the eyepiece of the telescope, which makes it necessary that the eye relief of the telescope is high so that the person can see the entire field of view
 choti ai relif vaali doorabeenon ke prayog main vahaan adhik dikkat ho sakati he jahaan unhen sthirataa pakadaney main mushkil ho
 The nearest focus distance is the least distance the telescope can focus
 yah duuri 1 meter se 30 meter tak ho sakati he or yah doorabeen ke dizine par nirbhar karti he
 Since the objects that telescopes are used to see are not at a fixed distance, it is necessary to have a focusing mechanism so that the distance between vision and objective lenses can be changed
 paramparaagat rup se, focus karne ke liye do alag alag vyavasthaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In telescopes that have an "independent focus", two different telescopes focus independently of their eyepiece
 paaramparik rup se baari field prayog, udhaaharan ke liye sainya anuprayogon ke liye, swatantra focus vaali doorabeenon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since normal users find it more convenient to focus both tubes of the telescope with a single adjustment, a second type of telescope uses a "central focus" that has a central focusing wheel to adjust both tubes simultaneously
 can go
 iske atirikt, donon ipis bhi darshak kii ankhon ke antar kii kshatipurti karne ke liye samyojit kiye ja sakate hai 
 ipis ko uske mount main ghuma kar samyojit kiye jane se hone vaale focal parivartan ko apvartan shakti kii prachlit ikai diopter main mapa jaataa he isi liye kai baar samaayojan kiye ja sakane vaale ipis ko bhi "diopter" hi kaha jaataa he
 After this adjustment has been made for a particular individual, both tubes are focused with the focusing wheel to see objects located at different distances and the eyepiece does not have to be adjusted again
 adhikansh aadhunik doorabeenon main ek kabjedaar banaavat kii sahaayta se donon alag alag telescopon ke bich kii duuri ko bhi parivartit kiya ja saktaa he jisase vibhinn logon kii donon aakhon ke bich kii duuri ke anusaar inhen set kiya ja saktaa he
 Most adults have the same distance between the two pupils
 kai doorabine "focus free" athwa "phixd focus" vaali hotin hai, jinamein focus karne kii koi yantrawali nahin hoti he
 Their design is for a static field of view that ranges from relatively close objects to infinity with a large hyperfocal distance
 in diginon ko samjhautapurna dizine mana jaataa he, isamen suvidha to he, parantu ve vasteen jo inaki dizine ke aadhaar par inke paraas ke bahaar hoti hai, ve thik se nahin dikhaai padatin
 Some binoculars provide adjustable magnification, called zoom binoculars, with the aim of keeping the user with the same binoculars and achieving different magnification levels using a "zoom" lever
 aisa karne ke liye lenson ke samaayojan kii ek jatil shrinkhalaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaisaa ki zum camera lenson main kiya jaataa he
 These designs are considered compromised or juggle as they increase the size, complexity and fragility of the telescope
 jatil prakaashiya path ke kaaran drishy kshetra kam ho jaataa he tathaa ucch zum ke str par chamak kam ho jaati he
 In models of this type, it is necessary to maintain equal magnification for both eyes throughout the zoom range, and also to keep the eye synchronized to avoid stress and fatigue
 doorabeenon main image sthirikaran takanic kaa prayog karte hue chhavi ko hilne se bachaaya tathaa ucch aavardhan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The components that change the image are held firmly in place by an energy-driven gyroscope or mechanics that operate with gyroscopes or stability testing devices, many times they are positioned so that they Actions do the opposite of effect
 sthirikaran ko prayogkarta kii ichha ke anukool shuru yaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 With these techniques, binoculars can be handheld with magnification up to 20X, as well as increasing the quality of image stabilization in low power devices
 yahaan par kuch kamiyaan bhi hai: sthirikaran kaa prayog na karne vaali shreshth doorabeenon ko tripad par lagane ke baad, unase praapt tasviir kahin behatar hoti he, saath hi sthirikaran vaali doorabine apni samatuly sthirikaran kaa prayog na karne vaali doorabeenon se mahangi tathaa baari hoti hai
 a well-converged telescope, when viewed with the human eye and processed by the human brain, should show a single, distinctly three-dimensional image and not look like two different images being viewed from a slightly different perspective

 Alignment is usually done by a professional, although instructions for identifying and aligning alignment errors are also found on the Internet
 kisi saadhaaran doorabeen main 6 se 10 prakaashiya tatva prayukt hote hai jinka vishisht prayog hota he, tathaa kaanch se hawa ke sampark vaali satahen 16 tak ho sakati hai, isliye doorabeen nirmaataaon ko takneekee kaarnon se vibhinn prakaar kii optical coating kaa prayog karnaa hota he jisase upkaran se praapt chhavi kii gunvattta badhaai ja sake
 The loss of light due to reflection on each surface is minimized by anti-reflective coating
 anti-recolactive coating ke madhyam se doorabeen ke andar "lupt" prakaash, jo ki praapt chhavi ko dhundhala bana saktaa he, ko kam kiya jaataa he
 An 8x40 telescope with good optical coating can produce a better and brighter image than an 8x50 telescope without a coating
 ek paaramparik lens coating saamagree magnesium fluoride he jo paravartan ko 5% se 1% tak kam kar detaa he
 Modern lens coatings consist of complex multi-layers and reflect only 0
25% or less, as well as give a good image with maximum brightness and natural colors
 ruf prism vaali doorabeenon main prakaash do raaston main vibhajit ho jaataa he jo ruf prism kii peeth ke kisi bhi taraf se paravartit hota he
 Half the light is reflected from surface 1 to surface 2 of the roof
 prakaash kaa bachaa hua aadha hissaa sataha 2 se sataha 1 par paravartit hota he
 This causes the light to partially polarize
 Its polarization vector changes with the changes occurring next to it but it changes like the Foucault pendulum in each path
 alag alag pathon par ja rahaa prakaash jab miltaa he, tab prayek path ke polaraise sadish mail nahin khate hai
 The angle between polarized vectors is called phase shift or geometric phase or berry phase
 bhinn jyamitiya fez vaale alag pathon ke takaraane par chhavi main ghatati-badhati tivrata kaa vitaran praapt hota he, jisase praapt hone vaala contrast va rizolution poro prism pranali ke mukaable kam ho jaataa he
 To reduce these unwanted interference effects on the roof surface of a roof prism, certain special electrolyte coating materials are vaporized, these substances are called phase-correction coating or P-coating
 yah coating do pathon ke bich jyamitiya fez main antar ko thik karke donon pathon se aa rahe prakaash ko ek hi fez main parivartit karti he jisase takaraav ke kaaran chhavi karaab nahin hone paati he
 Telescopes using schmidt-pechen Roof Prism or abbey-könig Roof Prism particularly benefit from the phase coating
 poro prism aadhaarit doorabine alag alag path se aa rahi prakaash kirnon ko punah ekatrit nahin karatin atah inhen fez coating se koi vishesh laabh nahin hota
 Telescopes using schmidt-pechen Roof Prism mirror coat the surfaces of the roof prism so that the light falling on one of its surfaces is less than the marginal angle, so that its total internal reflection does not occur
 Without mirror coating most of the light will be damaged
 schmidt-pechen Roof Prism uses aluminum mirror coating or silver mirror coating
 puraane dizin main rajat darpan coating kii jaati thi parantu sil na kii gayi doorabeenon main iskaa oxikaran ho jaataa tha tathaa ye paravartaneeyata kho detii thim
 Later aluminum mirror coating was used in unsealed designs as it does not tarnish, although it gives lower reflectivity than silver
 aadhunik dizin yaa to aluminium yaa chaandi kaa upyog karte hai
 Silver is used in modern high quality designs, filled with nitrogen or argon and sealed so that the silver mirror coating never tarnishes
 poro prism tathaa ruf prism vaali doorabine jo ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog karti hai, inako darpan coating kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa kyonki ye prism 100% paravartaneeyata sampoorn aatanrik paravartan se praapt kar lete hai
 Die-electric mirror coating is used to produce the effect of die-electric mirrors in schmidt-pechen Roof Prism
 saanchaa:jargon adhatvik daai-electric darpan coating ko banane ke liye ruf prism kii paravartaneey sataha par ekaantarit rup se ucch tathaa nimna apvartan suchakank vaale tatwon ko nickshepit kiya jaataa he
 Each single multilayer light reflects a thin frequency beam so many layers, so multiple multilayer light adjusted to different colors is needed to reflect white light
 yah bahuparat coating prism kii sataha par vitarit brag parivartak kii tarah kaary karte hue paravartaneeyata ko badha detii he
 a well-designed die-electric coating provides more than 99% reflectivity in the visible light spectrum
 yah paravartaneeyata aluminium darpan coating athwa rajat darpan coating se kahin behatar he
 Telescopes with poro prisms and roof prisms that use the abbe-könig roof prism do not have to use a die-electric coating because these prisms achieve very high reflectivity using complete internal reflection
 kisi coating kii upasthiti ko aamtaur par nimnlikhit shabdon dwaara doorabeen par chihnit kiya jaataa he: Handheld binoculars range from 3X10 opera glass used in theater to 7 to 12 m diameter magnification and 30 to 50 mm objective lenses
 kai paryatak sthalon par sikaa-chaalit doorabeen, stand par lagi hoti hai, jisaki sahaayta se ve us paryaton-aakarshan ko nikat se dekh pate hai
 In the UK, 20 pence usually allows two minutes of viewing with a telescope, while in the United States one or two quarters are allowed for one and a half to two and a half minutes
 kai doorabeenon main range khojane ke liye retical drishy kshetra main hi dikhataa he
 This scale helps in estimating the distance of the object being viewed when the height is known
 navikon kii saadhaaran 7X50 doorabeen main paimaane ke chinhon ke bich kii duuri lagbhag 5 mil ko vyakt karti he
 a mill, when viewed from a distance of 1000 meters, is called the angle formed between the top and base of a meter high object
 is prakaar ek gyaat oonchai par sthit vastu se duuri kaa anumaan lagane ke liye sameekaran is prakaar hoga: where: ek saadhaaran 5 mil paimaane par, ek prakaash-stambh jo ki 3 chinh ooncha dikh rahaa ho, vastav main 120 meter ooncha tathaa 8000 meter dur hoga
 The military use of binoculars has a long history

 The prisms of military binoculars are coated with an additional aluminum coating so that they are not degradable even when drenched
 doorabeen kaa ek or prayukt rup "trench doorabeen" hota he jo darasal doorabeen va periscope kaa mishran hota he, iskaa prayog topakhane kaa pataa lagane main kiya jaataa he, iskaa prayog karte samay sainik apana sar munder ke neech rakhte hue dekh saktaa he, jisase use suraksha praapt hoti he
 Military telescopes of the Cold War period were often fitted with passive sensors to make them visible to active infrared emissions, while modern telescopes have performers that prevent them from using laser rays as weapons

 This optical combination prevents the telescope from blurring or obscuring the image when it is vibrated relative to the eye

 Very large naval range-finder telescopes have been used, but the technology of the late 20th century made their application unnecessary

 Some telescopes of 70 mm and larger range are suitable for Earth observation; In the design of real astronomical telescopes, prisms are used to accurately display the image by increasing light transmittance

 Ceres, Neptune, Pallas, Titan, and Jupiter's Galilean moon, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, can be easily seen with the help of binoculars
 haalanki pradooshan rahit akaash main bina kisi sahaayta ke dekhe ja sakane vaale urenus tathaa vesta ko doorabeen kii sahaayta se sahajata se dekha ja saktaa he
 The 10X15 binoculars are limited to a value of +10 to +11 and also depends on the position of the sky and the experience of the observer
 saamanyatya uplabdh doorabeenon se grahikaayen jaise ki interemnia, davida, europa tathaa asaadhaaran paristhitiyaan hone par haijia, badi mushkil se nazar aati hai
 Similarly, except for Galilean and Titan, the moons of the planets and the dwarf planets Pluto and Iris are barely visible with most telescopes

 kam prakaash tathaa khagoleey darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn tathy aavardhan shakti tathaa optical lens ke vyas kaa anupaat he
 At low magnification, the field of vision is enlarged, making it easy to see deep celestial objects, such as the sky, the Ganges, the impractical, and the star clusters, although the light from the large exit pupil is not fully seen by the aged investigator because 50 years Eyes older than 4 rarely spread more than 5 mm
 bada exit pupil se raatri main akaash kii prishthbhumi main vaishamy kam ho jane ke kaaran dhundhlee vastuon ko pahchaanana kathin ho jaataa he, un kshetron ko chhod kar jahaan prakaashiya pradooshan naganya ho
 Telescopes designed for astronomical use show a very satisfactory view with large aperture objective
 Astronomical telescopes are usually of magnification of 12
5 and above

 However, for astronomical use, only large objective telescopes are good because blurred objects are also easily visible due to the high amount of light received from them
 unke ucch aavardhan or baari vajan ke kaaran, in doorabeenon ko sthir chhavi dekhne hetu stand par laga kar prayog karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Typically binoculars up to ten magnification can be used by holding them in hand, there is no need to place them in a stand
 Much larger telescopes are made by amateur telescope makers than two astronomical telescopes, refraction or reflection

 Jhilai or Jhalay is the first destination of Jaipur State
 When the child was not born in Jaipur State or the lineage did not move, then the place was adopted from the Jhilaya and its descendants were made tilak because it is a tradition in Rajputana that the elder brothers If there was no son, then the eldest son of the younger brother was adopted from him, and the big house of the Jaipur house was only visible and when the lineage did not grow in the house, then Jayapu a descendant was adopted from the r State, later the brothers of the Jhilai Jagiro were divided, in which the elder brother took the place and Jhilaya, and the other brothers took the place of thikana-israda, thikana-baler, Kunwar Chansinghji of Narsinghgarh State, 1824, was married to thikana-pilukheda in Rajasthan and Thikana Muvalia Narsinghgarh State Malwa was married in Thikana Muvalia, which is from the rajawat Rajawat family of Jaipur State, because Sawai Jaisingh was made the Subedar of Malwa thrice

 schimitto ne keval yahi poocha ki kahaan ke hai, unka pesha kya he or kya ve vila ke visham vaataavaran main paint kar sakate hai
 When Qadri said that he could do so, Scimitto invited him to stay and Qadri stayed there for eighteen years, except for a brief period
 copenhegan main basane ke kuch varshon baad 1973 main kadri apane sabase mahatvapurn duusare sangrakshak va nobel puraskaar vijeta henrik ball se mili

 iske alaava is avadhi ke dauraan kadri ne america drug ke nashe ke aadi chitrakaar linda wood or pere baacho ke saath ek puraane bandook kaarkaane daayitv sambhala or christiana naam ke ek mukt shahar se parichit hone main madad mili, jo abhi bhi copenhegan main maujuud he
 Over time, everything in Christian was available to everyone
 yahaan koi gopneeyata nahin thi or hashis khule main bazaar main uplabdh thi
 Although he enjoyed this openness, it was an impossible environment to work in
 chah maheene baad, kadri helerup laut aaye, jahaan ve 1986 main dow shimitto kii mrityu tak bane rahe
 antat vah sarkaar dwaara pryojit kalakaaron ke awaas main chale aaye, jahaan vah aaj bhi rah rahe hai
 Although he continued to work on canvas, paper became the favorite medium of Qadri from the mid-1970s
 He says, "I was always looking for a medium where effort is unnecessary
 Deep stages of life are not brought out of effort
" They say
 ve kehete hai ki unka kaam darshanik kism kaa nahin he, yah soch kii prakriya ko uttejit karne ke liye nahin hona chaiye
 iske vipareet, unka uddeshy vichaar prakriya ko kaid karnaa he, jaisaa ki dhyanavastha main hota he, jiskaa kadri har roj abhyaas karte the or sikhaate bhi the
 Kadri work broadly on monochromatic surfaces, in which they penetrate with holes and granular points
 buddha vidwaan robert thuraman ne unke binduon or daanedaar akritiyon ko "urja ke ujjwal bulabulon" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Qadri paper transforms these marks into a three-dimensional surface
 is tathy ke baavjood ki ve uttari europe main rahete he, bhartiya lokachar kii bhaavana unki kala main puri tarah maujuud he
 Their colors are bright - vermilion red, mayuri blue, dark orange and even dark black and brown and are distinctly Indian
 rang fike he or lagata he ki kaagaj se ris rahe hai
 The vibrations generated by the colors are infinite and break the boundary between the inner space of the image and the outer space of the viewer
 1980 ke dashak or 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan kadri kii kalatmak utpaadakta badi he or unhen los angeles, copenhegan, nairobi, nai dilli, mumbai, singapore or neuyork main pradarshaniyon ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Although he never married, he helped two partners, one Christian of Kerala and the other one to raise their three children
 This was also the time when he started planning to build a spiritual project, a Gyan Pillar or a Gyan Stupa, on an ancient trade route in Punjab, India
 These structures will eventually be built on several acres of land and will be dedicated to knowledge and peace
 Stupa construction is in progress
 apni kala gadhane ke saath-saath, kadri ne scadinavia main unnat str ke chaatro ko dhyanavastha kaa paath padhaanaa jari rakhaa he
 Qadri has successfully lived in different cultures throughout his career
 He says, "I did not want to limit myself to one place, nation or community
" " "meraa jivan ke prati drushtikon saarvbhaumik he or aisi hi meri kala he
 " yah sohan kadri ke gyaan or kala kaa parichay karaane kaa visheshadhikaar he, yahaan tak ki is jaise chote rup main
 aisi kala kaa lakshya sirf siddhant paidaa karnaa nahin hota
 iskaa kisi tarah kaa uddeshy nahin ho saktaa he
 It invites its partner to open the vibrant dimension from which it originates
 yah kalakaar ke vaastaviktaa ke anubhav ke khet main faltaa-phulataa he
 He disintegrates as pure beauty after looking through illusions and flying free
 vaastavik swatantraaa khud ko jaal main nahin fansaati, yah ek saath hi khud se mukt he or isliye dusron ke liye khushi or pyaar se bhram ko baahar main sanlagn hoti he
 The deceiving illusion turns into a spell of liberation
 gyaan kalakaar ko anand sagar main chodta he
 Ananda spontaneously looks at others with loving eyes, further prepares the desire for bliss in them as well
 kalakaar saundarya ke sthaan kii kalpana karata he, jahaan uskaa anubhav duusare ke anubhav chhu sake he
 Dr
 Robert Thurman kalakaar hote hai

 jahaan tak mujhe pataa he, aise tantric yogi nahin hote, jo saath-saath kalakaar bhi hon
 sohan kadri ek apwaad he
 He is an extraordinary artist
 ve yoga kii kala main nipun master he
 He is a master of the art of painting
 vah abhyaas karne vaale ek tantric yogi hai, jo samay-samay par varjit khaadya padaarth khaane, sharaab pine or vyabhichaar main lipt anushthan karte hai
 In this case, by breaking the law, he becomes an MLA in a way
 ek murtivaadee banane ke liye kisi ko chhaviyon kaa nirmaan karne ke bare main pataa hona chahie
 kanoon todane ke liye kisi ko ek vidwaan vakil hona chahie
' Qadri is a learned man
 vah ek puneatma hai, jinase ek prabhamandal utpann hota he
 Try or expose him as a fake saint and he will emerge as a great artist
 Try to declare his art as deceit and he will emerge as a great scholar
 Try to prove their knowledge false and it will be proved that all three of them - saintliness, aesthetics and knowledge are present
 mere man main koi shaq nahin he ki sohan kadri ek durlabh or moulik bhagidaar ke rup main ubhar rahaa he
 You can see their paintings in the form of instruments or mandalas and describe them as words like mantras
 aap unki chitrakaari main kundalini naam kii 'bhujang-satta' yaa shakti kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv dekh sakate hai, jise merudand ke antim chor par ghumaavdaar akruti main sthit bataaya jaataa he
 You can see his painting as just form or color and enjoy him as a pure art
 isse koi antar nahin padataa ki aap kis kone se dekh rahe hai, par yah ek mahaan drushtikon kaa khulaasa karata he, jo rahasyavaad he
 In its aesthetics, Sakha's union with emotion reaches its climax
 sohan kadri ek guru ho sakate hai
 He can be a tantric baba
 vah kala se asambaddha kuch bhi ho sakate hai
 For me she is a remarkable artist
 ajit mukherjee kii pustak tantra kala main kaha, gaya he "yah ascharyajanak he ki kai mahaan bhartiya kalakaar antat: sant ban gayi

 But the term is also used for articles that make logical and intellectual inquiry into a subject
 niabandh ke paryaay rup main sandarbh, rachana or prastaav kaa bhi ullekh kiya jaataa he
 But the most popular word in literary criticism is essay
 ise angreji ke compozishan or esse ke arth main grahan kiya jaataa he
 According to Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, there is also literature of essays in Sanskrit
 pracheen sanskrit sahitya ke un nibandhon main dharamshastreey siddhanton kii taarkik vyakhya kii jaati thi
 They were not characterized by personality
 kintu vartmaan kaal ke niabandh sanskrit ke nibandhon se thik ulate hai
 Among them, the quality of personality or individuality is universal
 itihaas-bodh parampara kii roodhiyon se manushya ke vyaktitv ko mukt karata he
 The mode of essay is related to this sense of history
 yahi kaaran he ki niabandh kii pradhan visheshta vyaktitv kaa prakaashan he
 The best definition of an essay is- is paribhaasha main ativyapti dosha he
 But the form of essay is so independent of other forms of literature that it is very difficult to define it accurately
 sari duniya kii bhashaaon main niabandh ko sahitya kii srujanaatmak vidha ke rup main manyata aadhunik yug main hi mili he
 In the modern era itself, the door of freedom from medieval religious, social conventions has been seen
 is mukti se niabandh kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 According to Hazariprasad Dwivedi- is prakaar niabandh main nibandhkaar kii svachhndatha kaa vishesh mahatva he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla wrote: iskaa taatpary yah he ki niabandh main kinhin aise thos rachana-niyamon or tatwon kaa nirdesh nahin diya ja saktaa jinka paalan karnaa nibandhkaar ke liye aavashyak he
 It is said that the essay is an artwork whose rules are invented by the author
 niabandh main sahaj, saral or aadambarhin dhang se vyaktitv kii abhivyakti hoti he
 According to 'hindi Sahitya Kosh': is prakaar niabandh ke do vishesh gun hai- The essayist is not obliged to follow any such instructions and rules as to how the beginning of an essay, what should be in the middle and how to end
 lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki niabandh ek uchhrunkhal rachana he or nibandhkaar ek uchhrunkhal vyakti
 The essayist organizes the publication and composition of his personality according to his inspiration and the possibilities of the subject matter
 isi kaaran niabandh main style kaa vishesh mahatva he
 In the modern era of Hindi literature, the tradition of writing essays with Bharatendu and his colleagues begins
 niabandh hi nahin, gadhy kii kai vidhaon kaa prachlan bharatendu se hota he
 This is a proof that prose and its genres are more compatible with the independent personality of modern man
 mote rup main swadhinata aadhunik manushya kaa kendriya bhav he
 Traditions of tradition are visible due to this sentiment
 samayik paristhitiyon kaa dabaav anubhav hota he

 The literature of Bharatendu era is considered modern due to this historiography

 Thus in education psychology, the behavior, mental processes and experiences of a person are studied under educational conditions

 According to modern education psychologists, the main areas of education psychology are as follows: shiksha kii mahatvapurn samasyaon ke samaadhaan main manovigyaan sahaayak hota he or yahi sab samasyaayein va unka samaadhaan shiksha manovigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra banate hai - Kelly has analyzed the functions of education psychology as follows - shiksha manovigyaan kaa sambandh seekhney evam seekhney kii vidhiyon arthath padhaane se he
 Education and psychology are two clear branches of knowledge, but both of them are closely related
 The basis of modern education is psychology
 bachche ko uski ruchiyon, rujhaanon, sambhaawanaaon tathaa vyaktitv kaa dhyanpurvak adhyayan karke shiksha di jaati he
 Today education and psychology complement each other
 skinner skinner kaa mat he ki ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan shiksha kaa ek aavashyaktatv he
 Education cannot be solved without its help
 shiksha tathaa manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh vyavhaar ke saath he
 Psychological discoveries have a deep impact on other aspects of education
 ’’ Education and psychology is the coordination of theory and practice, knowledge of mutual relationship between education and psychology is necessary for the coordinated balanced development of human beings
 shiksha ke samaan kaary, manovigyaan k siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 According to Crow and Crow, "psychology is the science of human behavior occurring in contact with the environment"
 Psychology describes human development related to learning
 shiksha, seekhney kii prakriya ko karne kii cheshtaa pradaan karti he
 Education psychology is related to the why and when of learning
 ’’ The link connecting education and psychology is "human behavior"
 is sambandh main do vidwaanon ke vichaar drushtavy he :- Brown- "education is the process by which a person's behavior changes
" ’’ Pillsbury- "psychology is the science of human behavior
 ’’ It is clear from these definitions that both education and psychology are related to human behavior
 shiksha maanav vyavhaar main parivartan karke use uttam banaati he
 Psychology studies human behavior
 is prakaar shiksha or manovigyaan ke sambandh hona swaabhaavik he par is sambandh main manovigyaan ko aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Education has to get the approval of psychology for each of its functions

 jha ne thik hi likhaa he- ‘‘shiksha jo kuch karti he or jis prakaar vah kiya jaataa he uske liye ise manovaigyanik khojon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 ’’ manovigyaan ko yah sthaan isliye praapt hua he kyonki usne shiksha ke sab kshetron ko prabhavit karke unamem krantikari parivartan kar diya he
 In this context, these pithy sentences of Ryan are notable - yah sab shiksha manovigyaan ke upyog ke kaaran sambhav hua he
 In short, psychology has made the following contribution in the field of education- shiksha kii samasyaayein uske uddeshyon, vishay vastu, sadhano evam vidhiyon se sambandhit he
 Psychology helps in solving problems in these four areas
 manovigyaan shiksha ke uddeshyon ko acchhee tarah se samajhane main nimna prakaar sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology plays an important role in understanding the content of education and determining it according to the development of the student
 kis kaksha ke chaatro ke liye vishaywastu kya ho? apratyaksh paathyakram kis prakaar kaa ho jisase chaatro ke maansik swasthya par vipareet prabhaav na pade aadi mahatvapurn prashnon kaa samaadhaan manovigyaan karata he
 With the help of psychology, mankind can be used for the welfare of the world
 manovigyaan shiksha ke sadhano ko samajhane main sahyog pradaan karata he, kyonki- Psychology gives knowledge about the methods of teaching in three ways - davis ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv kii is prakaar vivechna kii he - manovigyaan ne chaatro kii abhikshmataaon evam unamem paae jane vaale vibhinnataaon kaa vishleshan karke shiksha ke kshetra main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 It has also contributed to the school years by imparting knowledge about the manner of growth and development of the student
 blair ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv ko nimna shabdon main bataaya he - Different authors have given different definitions of education psychology
 isliye shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra ke bare main nishchit taur par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 In addition, education psychological is a new and growing science
 iske kshetra anishchit he or dharanaen gupt he
 a lot of research is being done in its fields right now and it is possible that new concepts, rules and principles of education psychology will be obtained
 iskaa bhav yah he ki shiksha manovigyaan kaa kshetra or samasyaayein anishchit tathaa parivartansheel he
 Whatever be the following areas or problems can be included in the field of education psychology
 kro and kro- ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan kii vishay saamagree kaa sambandh seekhney ko prabhavit karne vaali dashaon se he
 ’’ shiksha manovigyaan ko vyavhaarik vigyaan kii shrenee main rakhaa jane laga he
 Being a science, many methods developed in its study as well
 ye vidhiyaan vaigyanik hai
 In the words of George A
 Lundberg - shiksha manovigyaan main adhyayan or anusandhan ke liye saamaanya rup se jin vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unako do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa haih- Some of these major methods are described as follows: - aatm nirikshan vidhi ko arntadarshan, anternirikshan vidhi bhi kehete he
 According to Stout, "the systematic study of one's mental activities is called internal inspection
" ’’ woodworth ne is vidhi ko aatmanirikshan kaha he
 In this method, one's mental actions are subjective
 aatmagat hone ke kaaran aatmanirikshan yaa antardarshan vidhi adhik upyogi hoti he
 According to Locke - the inspection of one's own actions by the brain
 vyakti adhyayan vidhi kaa prayog manovaigyanikon dwaara maansik rogiyon, aparaadhiyon evam samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaale vyaktiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Often a psychologist is brought up by many types of people
 inamen koi apradhi, koi maansik rogi, koi jhagadaaloo, koi samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaala or koi samasya balak hota he
 The psychological, physical, family and social environment of a person leads to mental imbalance
 jiske falswaroop vah avaanchhneeya vyavhaar karne lagata he
 To find the real reason for this, he connects the episodes of the person's prior history
 is uddeshy se vah vyakti uske mata pita, shikshakon, sambandhiyon, padosiyon, mitron aadi se bhent karke poochtacha karata he
 In this way, he collects facts regarding a person's inheritance, family and social environment, interests, actions, physical health, educational and emotional development, which leads to improper conduct as a victim of psychosis
 is prakaar is vidhi kaa uddeshy vyakti ke kisi vishisht vyavhaar ke kaaran kii khoj karnaa he
 Crowe and Crowe wrote, "the main purpose of the life history method is to diagnose a cause
" ’’ The extrusion method is also called the observation or inspection method
 avlokan yaa nirikshan kaa saamaanya arth he- dhyanpurvak dekhnaa
 We can estimate one's inner state of mind by observing the behavior, behavior and actions, reactions etc
 from outside
 udaahranartha- yadi koi vyakti jor-jor se bol rahaa he or uske netra laal he to ham jaan sakate he ki vah krodh me he
 You can guess a person is happy to see him laughing
 nirikshan vidhi main nirikshankarta, adhyayan kiye jane vaale vyavhaar kaa nirikshan karata he or usee ke aadhaar par vah vishay ke bare main apni dharna banaata he
 Practicalists have given special importance to this method
 colesnic ke anusaar nirikshan do prakaar kaa hota he- Formal inspection is performed in controlled conditions and informal inspection is conducted in uncontrolled conditions
 inamen se anaupchaarik nirikshan, shikshak ke liye adhik upyogi he
 He gets many opportunities to observe his students' behavior in and outside the classroom
 vah is nirikshan ke aadhaar par unke vyavhaar ke pratimaano kaa gyaan praapt karke unako upyukt nirdesan de saktaa he
 According to Good and Hat - "A questionnaire is generally a method of getting answers to literal questions, in which the person has to fill in the format himself
 is vidhi main prashnon ke uttar praapt karke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatra karnaa mukhya hota he
 a questionnaire is a schematic list of written questions
 isamen sambhavit uttaron ke liye yaa to sthaan rakhaa jaataa he yaa sambhavit uttar likhe rahete hai
 " is vidhi main vyaktiyon se bhent kar ke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatrit karnaa mukhya hota he
 Through this method, knowledge of the problems and qualities of a person is obtained
 isamen do vyaktiyon main aamane-saamne maukhik vaartalap hota he, jiske dwaara vyakti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane tathaa shaareerik or maansik dashaon kaa gyaan praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In the words of Good and Hat - a serious conversation with an objective is the interview
 ‘‘purv nirdhaarit dashaon main maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan
 In the method, the user studies the behavior of a person in situations or environments they have set themselves or collects facts in relation to a problem
 ‘‘vyakti ke achetan man kaa adhyayan karke upachaar karnaa
 Through this method, a person's unconscious mind is studied, and information about his unquenchable desires is obtained
 taduparant un ichchhaaon kaa parishkar yaa margntikaran karke vyakti kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he or is prakaar iske vyavhaar ko uttam banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he Jogulamba or Jogulamba Gadwal is a district in the state of Telangana, India
