 When the nature of these deformations is easily perceptible within the body, then it is called macro deformity and when there is a deformity of the subtle form, when the microscope instrument is needed to see these deformations then it is called micro deformation

 iske kaaran ukt sthaan par paushtik padaarth nahin pahunchataa he
 The following are the types of tissue: yah bhi ootkavishesh par honevaali kriya he
 When a tissue is called degeneration, it must be understood to mean a particular type of change in the tissue, such as saying fat degeneration is the presence of fat in a particular tissue, such is the perception, naming accordingly, such as the heart Deterioration, muscular degeneration, mechanical degeneration etc
 duusare shabd main utakon ke paushtik aahaar kii kami se koshika kii rasinic kriya main jab parivartan aa jaataa he, to use apakarshan kehete hai
 In this, the cell dies completely and a new type of chemical substance is produced from its protoplasm

 When a specific substance comes out of the lymph inside the cell, it is called inhalation

 When there is a type of rot in the tissue due to lack of blood, it is called koth
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he shushk koth tathaa ardra 
 Dry koth - When the blood reaches an organ through an artery of one part, dry koth is produced

 unki rachana utak se bhinn hoti he tathaa unki vruddhi bahut hi drut veg se hoti he
 They circulate in the body quickly and induce healthy ingredients inside

 For this reason, they are also very deadly and because of this they are called deadly, wicked, or few tumors
 manushya sharir main jab koi rogotpadak jeevanuon kaa akraman hota he, to sharir ke andar prakruti unka ghortam pratirodh karti he or isi yuddh main sharir ke bali kosh un bahari jeevanuon kaa bal nasht karke sharir ko rog se bachaa lete hai

 pratiraksha do prakaar kii hoti he : Natural immunity - The natural force that is produced inside the body in resistance to a disease is called natural immunity
 arjeet pratiraksha - kisi vyakti main kisi vishesh rog ke pratirodh kii shakti yadi nahin he or peeche se swayan yaa kisi anya upayon dwaara usamen us rog ke pratirodh kii shakti paidaa kar di jaae, to use arjeet pratiraksha kah sakate hai
 For example, some germs that produce cholera, smallpox, pearl, tetanus, etc
 are small that can cause disease once they enter the body, but produce small amounts of immunity against disease
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ek vish adhik maatra main hone se sharir main vyaadhi utpann karata he, kintu vahi vish atyalp maatra main rahane se pratiraksha paidaa karata he

 After the conquest of Greece by Rome, that is, in graeco-roman literature prose, history and criticism are important from the point of view of scripture
 rome ke isai dharm main dikshit hone ke baad prakrutipujak greece ke sahitya or samskruti ko bahut chot pahunchi
 Then there were historians such as Plutarch and Lucian, and critics like Dionysius and Lajinus in this era
 pracheen roman yaa laathini sahitya prasar or samruddhi donon hi drushtiyon se pracheen greek sahitya se ghatakar he
 It also has three divisions: 1

 referring to the universal comprehensiveness and generosity of his approach and the climax of the aesthetic elegance and beauty of Greek and Latin poetry in his poetry
 Elliot has said: 'our Kalasik is a classic, Virgil of contemporary Europe'

 The first is famous for its satirical and sarcastic compositions and verses, and the second for its pranks and marquis
 livius yaa livi is yu ga kaa prasiddh itihaaskaar he
 He wrote the history of Rome

 samrajyakaal ke do upavibhaajan kiye jate hai: Among the famous litterateurs of Raztakan, Seneca enriched Latin literature in the Greek tradition by the creation of Trajedi, Lucan by epic, flakus and juvenal satire and sarcasm, Pliny by history, Quintilian by literature and history, and Tasitas by composing biography, history, literary criticism, etc

 After the second century, Christianity became dominant over Latin literature
 is sahitya main pracheen greek or laathini murti or prakrutipujak parampara or isai dharm kii manyataon ke bich teevr dwandv kii abhivyakti hui
 Notable litterateurs of this era include Tartulian, Minusius Felix, lacanthaeus, Saint Jerome, Saint Agustin, Boethium, Kassidorus, Saint Benedict, Gregory the Great, Saint Isidar, etc
 isa kii chhathi sadi se lekar puure madhya yug tak laathini sahitya kii rachana hoti rahi
 All the work of the church was done in Latin, in addition to this, the language had a prominent place in the field of cosmic literature, philosophy and education
 is lambey kaal ke rachanakaaron main kuch prasiddh naam ye hai: colombaanas, bid, alkuin, sant barnard, sant tomas aquinas, dante 
 The important role of Latino in this era can be inferred from the fact that its litterateur belonged not only to Italy or Rome, but also to many countries in Ireland, England and Western Europe
 punarjagran europe main greek or roman sahitya, kala or darshan ke prati nai sajagata or abhiruchi kaa kaal he
 Most scholars believe the rise of the Renaissance since 1453 AD, when the Turks conquered Kustuntunia and forced the Grecroman civilization to take Shannon westward to Italy
 kuch iskaa prarambh 1440 i

 Even before this, there are signs of newfusion in the 10th and 12th centuries
 15veen sadi ke pehle or uske purvardh main hi is jaagran kii purvapithika italy ke anek nagaron main, jinamein rome or florence pradhan the, taiyaar ho chuki thi
 Among those who led it were Dante, Petrarch:, Boccacho, Kojimo Medichi, etc
 kintu 15veen sadi ke madhya se yah prakriya itani vegavati or vyapak ho gai ki yahaan se madhya yugin europe kaa aadhuniktaa main sankraman mana jaataa he
 With this transition, the liberal secular and humanist view of Greek and Roman literature, culture and art dismantled the narrow and orthodox religiosity of medieval Europe and the anti-independence feudal curiosities of the heretics and their allies
 punarjagran ne adipaap or hinata ke siddhant ke sthaan par maanav kaaya kii pavitrataa or vyakti ke vikaas kii amit sambhaavnaaon main aasthaa kii pratishtha kii
 The trend was so strong that the church itself had to compromise with it
 french vidwaan jasraan ke anusaar loukikta or maanavtawaad kii is asandigdh vijay kaa pratik kaanse kii bani aurat kii vah nangi murti thi jo punarjagran ke baad swayan ek pope kii samadhi par sthapit kii gai
 The Renaissance revived humanism as well as the ancient Greek and Roman literary tradition, as a result of which Italian literature received the ideal constitution of the object and creation of poetry, tatak, fable, history, etc
 pracheen greek or laathini sahityakaron kii rachanaaon se prerana grahan karne ke atirikt 16veen sadi ke italvi sahityakaron ne arastu or horess kii poetiks or ars poetika naamak rachanaaon ko kavy ke lakshan granth ke rup main sweekrut kiya
 The Renaissance also gave rise to neo-latinanism under the leadership of Lorenton Medichi in Florence, which had a profound effect on the love poems of Italy and other countries of Europe
 italy kii simaaon ko laanghakar clasical navjagriti 15veen 16veen sadi main france main or 16veen sadi main spain, germany or england main pahunchi
 This renaissance freed the personal talents of these countries by dissolving the unity of Europe under the Roman Catholic Church
 isaliye inamen se har desh ne is nai chetana ko apane apane saanchon main dhaala
 Religion, culture, literature, art, science, education, all were marked by this awakening
 is andolan ke sandesh ko italy ke agraniyon ne europe ke deshon main pahunchaaya or use grahan karne ke liye europe ke deshon ke agrani italy pahunche
 Leonardo da Vinci of Italy and Alamanni France and Castiglione arrived in Spain
 pashchimi europe se mahan dharmik netaa luther or medhaavi maanavtaavaadi iraismus italy pahunche
 Poets of France's Plaea, the Reformation movement of Germany, the Lyric poetry of Spain, the original revival of the Elizabethan era literature of England was the renaissance
 is navjagriti kii visheshta yah thi ki usne jahaan ek ore apane pracheen clasical adarsh upasthit kiye, vahaan duusari ore vyakti kii chetana ko muktakar use prayog or srijan kii nai dishaao main jane kaa saahas bhi diya
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, after these ideals became stereotypes, this creative spirit was lost
 pracheen clasikon ke pravaah ko reeti ke kunda main baandh kar ek nae vaad ne janm liya, jise nioclasisism kaha jaataa he
 Often 'classicism' and 'neo-classicalism' are used as synonyms, but it is necessary to understand the distinction between the ideals of classicism or neo-classicalism once the ideals of old classics and ideals are tied up
 europe meniyo classisism ko pratishthit karne main mukhya bhoomika 17veen sadi ke french sahityakaron or aalochakon kii thi, jinhone 16veen sadi ke italvi aalochakon dwaara arastu, horess aadi pracheen greek or roman sahityachintakon ke siddhanton par kiye gaye mataikyheen vichaarvimarsh ko kathor vyavasthit or praaia: nirjeev reeti kaa rup de diya
 The French criticalists did not reach out to the ancient Greek and Roman thinkers directly through Italian critics of their interest, as a result of which they charged their customs on the principles of the ancient Classico, especially Aristotle, with great freedom
 aalochana main is ritivaad kaa pratham mahatvapurn prachaarak mailarb hua
 Between 1630 and 1660, this formalism spread more
 yah kaary shaplein, bvylo, raapem, le bossu ityadi ke dwaara sampann hua or isamen unhen lui ke darbar ke sangrakshan main santhaapit french academy, dekart ke buddhivaad or catholic carch se prerana or samarthan praapt hua
 The focus of neo-classical criticism turned to poetry, which also included epics and grief and happy metaphors
 uske kuch saadhaaran siddhant the, jaise, kavita kaa lakshya manoranjan se adhik naitik shiksha he; kavyashastra yaa reeti kaa gyaan pratibha se adhik aavashyak he; reeti kaa arth kalasikon kaa anukaran he: kavy kii vastu main ‘satya’ sarvopari he or satya kaa arth he maanav dwaara anubhoot saarvbhaum satya; or kalpana ke udvaig ke sthaan par bauddhik sanyam or santulan hona chahie; abhivyakti main spashtataa or laghav hona chahie; rachanavidhan main vyavastha, anupaan or santulan kaa samyak nirvaah hona chahie
 In short, these simple rules had three axles, intelligence, neer-kshir-vivek and artistic interest
 jahaan tak kavyarupon kaa prashn tha, nio-clasical aalochana shastriyon ke anusaar prayek rup ke vishay, lakshya, prabhaav or sheliyaan pracheenon ne nishchit kar di thi
 It was on this basis that he composed the composition of epic and happy plays
 unhone du:khant main prahasan or prahasan main du:khant ke tatwon ke sammishran kii ninda kii or kaal, desh evam ghatana ke sandhitray ko roopak ke rachanavidhan kaa kendriya siddhant mana
 Neo-classical theories had a profound impact on the then European literature as France of 14th Louis was the cultural center of Europe
 18veen sadi kaa angreji sahitya nio-clasical aadarsho kaa pratibimb he
 It is clear that his followers of ancient Greek and Latin classics and Renaissance cannot be united with Neo-classical litterateurs

 The features of classicism that Elliot has mentioned in his article on Virgil, 'whiteize Classic', are summarized as follows: the expression of the maturity of thinking and folklore, the perception of history, tradition and social destiny, in language or style
 Generalization, liberal and broad receptivity of approach, universality
 pracheen clasikon ne apana kaary sahitya, saamaajik jivan or chintan kii mahan paramparaon ke sandarbh se sampann kiya
 Neo-classical litterateurs also had this realization, but they did not have these great references before them
 nio-classisism aise yug kii upaj he jab samaaj kisi vikaas ke daur se guzar kar jadta kii sthiti main aa jaataa he, jab vah band gali ke chor par pahunchakar ruk jaataa hai
 At such a time, the place of object becomes secondary and the place of form becomes dominant in literature
 yah roopashakti sahitya main roodhi yaa ritivaad kii atyant urvar bhoomi he
 It is not surprising that in this era of Western Europe's cultural crisis there was a revival of Nia-classicism in English and other literature

 Greek and Roman literature and European literature in their perspective are discussed above under the traditional definition of 'classic'
 uparyukt sahitya ke sandarbh main hum ne yah prashn uthaaya ki homer aaj se hajaar-do hajaar saal purv rome or athens padhe jate the or aaj bhi ve landan or paris main padhe jate hai
 Despite many variations and changes, their importance remains till date, what is the reason for this? In response to this question, it was felt that the literature which has stood the test of time is the 'classic'
 atev ab yah samajha jane laga he ki clasik sahitya vah he jisamen jivan ke un tatwon kaa samavesh nishchit rup se ho jinaki upyogita or sarthakata prayek yug or desh ke liye aprihaary he
 Indian literature can be seen from the same definition of 'classic'

 Many Sanskrit poems and epics can be counted under it

 You can also use v { \ displaystyle V} instead of u { \ displaystyle U}
 If vx, vy, vz { \ displaystyle v_ {x}, v_ {y}, v_ {z}} are considered components of this velocity vector then the kinetic energy equations are e = 1 2 m v →

 The origin of this operator is in partial differential
 If this operator works on a particular range of functions, called the characteristic function, then the result of this function is multiplied by a constant called the characteristic value
 The characteristic function depends on the operator

 There are many operators in quantum mechanics, these operators are the same variables that can be measured by experiments for a particle
 These variables are called 'observational' or 'observable'
 Speed, momentum, location, potential energy and energy are observable variables

 In the battlefield of Kurukshetra in the battle of Mahabharata war, Mumursh Bhishma Pitamah lying on the sharaiya is beset by unbearable mindset and is suffering in the midst of many contradictions
 unke liye jivan paap or maran abhishaap ho gaya he
 But why so? This is because Bhishma showed great short-sightedness by kidnapping the three princesses of Kashiraj for his ill-tempered and estranged half-brother Vichitravirya

 'tutaa hua sagar' kii kavitaaon main kavi kii balwattar anubhutiyon evam prauji bhashaa-shilp ke darshan hote hai
 The poet's sense of responsibility towards the individual, society and nation is expressed here in a more intense form
 jivan ke karagaar main kaid aaj ke aadmi kii tasviir ko kavi ne kitne marmasparshi rup main ankit kiya he : See the poet's sarcastic satire towards the toxic civilization of the city and the Sarapagark citizens and recall the poem titled 'snake' of Agnayaji: 'ritumati he pyaas' vishuddh geet-sangrah he, jisamen upamalankar evam lakshanik prayogon se samalankrita prakruti kaa chitropam evam bimbaatmak chithran dekhte hi banataa he

 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted

 He took this color from the flag of Mahar, the largest Dalit class in Maharashtra
 ab yah buddha dharm kaa ashokachakr vaala yah nila jhanda ambedkar kaa pratik chinh ban chukaa hai
 Later, all other Ambedkarite organizations and Patis, including Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, Bahujan Samaj Party, also adopted the same color and thus became a symbol of resistance, struggle and identity of Ambedkarite Buddhists and Dalits
 buddha evam dalit har maukey par nila rang tathaa nila jhande kaa istemaal karte hai

 lok prashasan mote taur par shaskeey niti ke vibhinn pahaluon kaa vikaas, un par amal evam unka adhyayan he
 That part of the administration which is for the benefit of the general public is called public administration
 lokprashasan kaa sambandh saamaanya nitiyon athwa saarvajanik nitiyon se hota he
 As a discipline it means public service carried out by an organization of persons called 'sarkar'
 iskaa pramukh uddeshy or astitv kaa aadhaar 'seva' he
 To avail this type of service, the government has to raise resources by charging the people financial burden in the form of taxes and revenue
 jinaki kuch aay he unase kuch lekar sevaaon ke madhyam se uskaa samtapurna vitaran karnaa iskaa uddeshy he
 The objectives of public administration in any country depend on the institutions, processes, structures of personnel-political system and principles of governance expressed in the constitution of that country

 Human is a social animal
 vah sadaiv samaaj main rahata he
 There is a political system to maintain every society, so it can be assumed that society and political system has been mandatory for it since time immemorial
 arestu ne kaha he ki “yadi koi manushya aisa he, jo samaaj main na rah saktaa ho, yaa jise samaaj kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, kyonki vah apane aap main purna he, to vah avashya hi ek junglee jaanavar yaa devtaa hoga
 "every society has some body or organization to maintain order, whether it be called city-state or nation-state
 rajya, sarkaar or prashasan ke madhyam se kaary karata he
 No matter how effective, attractive and useful the objectives and policies of the state are, they cannot be of any benefit until they are converted into action by the administration
 isaliye prashasan ke sanghathan, vyavhaar or prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Charlesbeard states that "no subject is as important as the administration"
 rajya evam sarkaar kaa, yahan tak ki, swayan sabhyataa kaa bhavishya, sabhy samaaj ke kaaryon kaa nishpaadan karne main sakasham prashasan ke vigyaan, darshan or kala ke vikaas karne kii hamaari yogyata par nirbhar he
 "donham confidently stated that" if our civilization fails, it will be mainly due to the failure of the administration
 yadi kisi sainik adhikari kii galati se anubam chhot jaye to tritiy vishwa yuddh shuru ho jaayegaa or kuch hi kshanon main viksit sabhyataaon ke nasht honeki sambhaavnaayen utpann ho jaayengi
 " jyon-jyon rajya ke swaroop or gatividhiyon kaa vistaar hota gaya he, tyon-tyon prashasan kaa mahatva badhata gaya he
 It is not an exaggeration to say that we are born, thrive, grow up, befriend, and collide and die in the lap of administration
 aaj kii badhati hui jatiltaaon kaa saamana karne main, vyakti evam samudaay, apni simit kshamtaaon or sadhano ke kaaran, swayan ko asamarthpate hai
 Whether it is a problem of prevention of famine, flood, war or malaria, or the question of eradicating ignorance, exploitation, inequality or corruption, nothing can be done without the help of the administration
 sthiti yah he ki prashasan ke abhaav main hamaara apana jivan, mrityu ke samaan bhayaavah or toote taare ke samaan asahaay lagata he
 We do not consider it as the support of our present, but consider it as the basis of building a new civilization, culture, system and world
 hamen apana bhavishya prashasan ke haathon main saunp dene main adhik sankoch nahin hota
 All private and public organizations are required to administer
 dymock evam koing ne kaha he ki “vahi yah nirdhaaran karata he ki ham kis tarah kaa saamaanya jivan bitaayenge or ham apni kaarykushaltaaon ke saath kitni swadhinataon kaa upbhog karne main samarth honge
 “administration is the world between dreams and their fulfillment

 Where Smithberg, Simon and Thomson consider him synonymous with "collaborative group behavior", for Morstein Marx it is "the work of each"
 vastutah prashasan sabhi niojit kaaryon main vidyaman hota he, chaahe ve nijee hon athwa saarvajanik
 It can be considered a system of fulfillment of the general wishes of every community
 prayek raajnneetik vyavastha ko prashasan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chaahe vah loktantratmak ho athwa samaajawaadee yaa taanaashaahee
 From a point of view, the need for administration remains more socialist than democracy
 samaajawaadee vyavasthaaon ke sabhi karyprashaskon dwaara hi sampann kiye jate hai
 Individuals and information communities also contribute to public life in democratic systems
 yadhyapi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prashasan kaa kaary samaajwaad kii apeksha loktantr main adhik kathin hota he
 Administration in Socialism is the administration of activities done in a cooperative manner by groups to accomplish the same goals, controlled and guided by a political party

 Smithberg, Simon etc
 have considered the activity of the groups that cooperate to achieve the same goals
 fifanor va prasths ke matanusaar, prashasan “vaanchit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye maanviya tathaa bhautik sadhano kaa sanghathan evam sanchaalan he
 "encyclopपीdia Britannica described it as" the management of tasks or the act of completing them "
 nigro ke anusaar, “prashasan lakshya kii prapti ke liye manushya tathaa saamagree kaa upyog evam sanghathan he
 In White's view, it is "the art of directing, controlling and coordinating many individuals to achieve a specific objective or goal
" ” From the perspective of the above definitions, the general symptoms of administration can be stated as follows - in sabhi lakshanon ko tid kii paribhaasha main dekha ja saktaa he ki “prashasan vaanchit parinaam kii prapti ke liye maanav prayaason ke ekikaran kii samaveshi prakriya he
 " in sabhi paribhaashaon main prashasan kii badi vyapak vyakhyaayein kii gayi hai
 When we talk of public administration or administration related to the implementation of public policies, it has been called "public administration" or "public administration"
 yaheen lokprashasan saamaanya “prashasan” se pruthak evam vishisht ho jaataa he
 The principles and practices of public administration are increasingly affecting the administration available in other areas
 white ke shabdon main, lok prashasan main “ve gatividhiyaan aati hai jinka prayojan saarvajanik niti ko puraa karnaa athwa kriyanvit karnaa hota he
 According to Woodrow Wilson, "public administration is the work of implementing the law or law in a detailed and systematic manner
" kanoon ko kriyanvit karne kii prayek kriya prashaskeey kriya he
 "dimock has stated that" administration is related to the "what" and "how" of the government
 “kya” se abhipraay vishay main nihit gyaan se he, arthath vah vishisht gyaan, jo kisi bhi prashaskeey kshetra main prashaasak ko apana kaary karneki kshamta pradaan karata ho
 "how" means the art and principles of managing, according to which, collective plans are taken towards success
 ” harvey vaakar ne kaha ki “kanoon ko kriyaatmak rup pradaan karne ke liye sarkaar jo kaary karti he, vahi prashasan he
 "according to Willoughby," the administration is actually concerned with administering legislation declared by the administrative body of the government and made by the judiciary
 ” percymequin ne bataaya ki “lokprashasan sarkaar ke kaaryon se sambandhit hota he, chaahe ve kendra dwaara sampadit hon athwa sthaneey nikaay dwaara
 As a widespread activity, Waldo called it "collaborative human action with a high degree of intelligence"
 siddhanth evam vishleshan kii drushti se lokprashasan evam nijee prashasan, saamaanya prashasan ke hi do vishisht rup hai kintu in donon roopon main moulik samantaayein paayi jaati hai
 At the present time, the inequalities between them are gradually decreasing
 isi prakaar, prabandhan bhi prashasan se bhinn na hokar usee kaa sanchaalan evam nirdeshaatmak bhaag he
 The subject of public administration is very vast and diverse
 iskaa siddhant antah anushaasanamak he kyonki yah apane daayre main arthshaastra, raajnneeti vigyaan, prabandhashastra or samajashaastra jaise anek saamaajik vigyaanon ko sametataa he
 The central elements of public administration or good governance are the same all over the world - efficiency, economy and equity are its foundations
 shashan ke swaroopon, aarthik vikaas ke str, raajnneetik or saamaajik-saanskrithik karkon, ateet ke prabhaavon tathaa bhavishya sambandhi lakshyon yaa swapnon ke aadhaar par vibhinn deshon kii vyavasthaaon main antar aprihaary hai
 The objective of public administration in a democracy is the maximum welfare of the maximum people by such appropriate means, which are transparent and clear
 america vidwaan woodro wilson ke anusaar, ek samvidhan banane kii apeksha use chalaanaa adhik kathin he
 Since administration has a role in the implementation of the Constitution, administration is considered to be a practical discipline, which needs serious study
 wilson kaa mukhya sandesh tha ki, lok prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak kiya janaa chahie
 Although politics can determine the functions of administration, the administrative discipline should not be distracted from its task
 lok prashasan chaahe kala ho yaa vigyaan ho, yah ek vyaavhaarik shaastra he, jo sarvyaapee ban chuke raajnneeti or rajkeey kaaryakalapon se gaharaai se judaa hua he
 In practice also public administration has become an all-inclusive scripture, as it affects a person's life from birth to death
 vastav main yah vyakti ko uske janm ke pehle se bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he, jaise bhrun pareekshan par pratibandh yaa mahilaon or bacchon ke liye swasthya sevaaon ke praavdhaan jaisi nitiyon ke dwaara
 To understand the meaning of 'public administration' well, it is necessary to understand the distinction between 'administration' and 'public administration': lokprashasan kii prakruti ko lekar vidwaanon main teevr matbhed he ki lok prashasan ko vigyaan kii shrenee main rakhaa jaye athwa kala kii shrenee main
 On the basis of this difference, scholars can be divided into four categories: lok prashasan ko vigyaan maanane vaale vichaarak
 Thinkers who do not consider public administration as science
 lok prashasan ko kala maanane vaale vichaarak
 Thinkers who place public administration in the category of both arts and sciences
 vartmaan samay main lok prashasan kii bhoomika atyadhik vyapak evam jatil ho gai he
 Administrators are taking a permanent part in policy making process and solving various problems
 atah yah aavashyak he ki sabhi prashaasak nirnay prakriya se behatar dhang se parichit hon
 Also, they should also know what the role of values and facts can be in problem solving
 lok sevaayen vaid satta par aadhaarit hai jinhen kaaryon ke sampadan hetu samuchit adhikaar, aavashyak suraksha tathaa paryaapt suvidha pradaan kii gai he
 Therefore, the responsibilities of public servants working in these services should also be ensured
 lok sevakon ko unke kaaryon evam vyavsaayik samhita sambandhi dishanirdesan lokseva mulyon ke santulit dhaanche dwaara diya janaa chahie
 Ethics generally refers to the moral values that play an important role in directing and sanskritizing people's behavior
 jab in naitik mulyon kii prashasan ke sandarbh main paricharchaa kii jaati he to yah "prashasnic nitishastra" kehalaata he
 Modern public services have taken the form of a profession, so the demand for administrative ethics has started to arise
 germany vah pratham desh he jahaan lok sevaaon kaa peshewar rup viksit hua or loksevakon ke liye peshewar aachaar samhita viksit hui
 At the same time, the beginning of morality in American public administration can be linked to the "robbery" method prevalent there, when an American youth, fed up with this method, killed the then American President Garfield in the year 1881
