 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows
 unhone ‘the Road Ahead’ pustak likhi he
 This book is also very good

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part

 isaki rachana karne vaale shukr kaa naam mahabharat main 'shukracharya' ke rup main miltaa he
 Nothing is known about the creator of Shukraniti and his period
 shukraniti main 2000 shloke hai jo iske chauthe adhyay main ullikhit he
 It is also written in it that the king who thinks day and night of this policy is able to carry his kingdom
 isamen kaha gaya he ki teenon lokon main shukraniti ke samaan duusari koi niti nahin he or vyavhaari logon ke liye shukr kii hi niti he, shesh sab 'kuniti' he
 The content of sukraniti is different from that of spiritual policy
 iske chaar adhyyon main se pratham adhyay main raja, uske mahatv or kartavya, saamaajik vyavastha, mantri or yuvaraj sambandhi vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Shukraniti occupies an important place in ancient Indian political thinking
 shukraniti ke rachayita shukracharya kaa naam pracheen bhartiya chintan main sammanit sthaan rakhata he
 In Dandi's 'daskumarcharitam', Shukracharya has been given the first place in the names of political scribes
 shukraniti itnaa prrachin granth hote hue bhi isamen aise anek vishyon kaa vivaran he jo aaj bhi prasangik hai or upyogi bhi he
 Knowledge of the glorious and rich tradition of Shukraniti contemplation
 kautilya ke ‘arthshaastra‘ evam maikiyavali ke ‘da prince‘ ke samaan shukr kii shukraniti main bhi raja ko shashan karnaa sikhaaya gaya he
 Thus, in this the practical side but not the theoretical aspect of politics is more important
 shukr ke anusaar, ‘‘sabhi ashankaon ko tyagkar raja ko aisi niti kaa paalan karnaa chahie jisase shatru ko maaraa ja sake arthath vijay praapt ho‘‘
 According to Shukracharya, he has presented to his disciples the essence of the ethics of Brahma
 shukr niti me chaar mul adhyay he
 In its various editions, the fifth chapter is in the form of 'khil Niti' which is not a part of the original text
 shukracharya ke kaal kaa nirdhaaran atyant kathin kaary he
 Based on its theme and style, it seems to be a post-kautilya work of Arthashastra
 aisa lagata he ki shukr naam vastutah chintan kii ek vishesh parampara ko vyakt karata he, ek vyakti ko nahin
 It is considered as an authentic text as a source of Indian political thought
 yadhyapi shukranitisar ke rachanakaal ke vishay main vidwaanon main matbhed he, kintu praayah sabhi aadhunik vidwaan is par sahamat hai ki yah vedikkaleen rachana nahin he apitu isa ke baad kii kriti he
 According to Kashiprasad Jaiswal, it is an 8th century creation
 iske granthkaar ko isi kaal kaa rajshastri kaha ja saktaa he
 Shukrniti is a book of political nature, basically similar to Kautilya's Arthashastra, in which Venus has accepted four branches of knowledge like the Kautilya and Kamandaka - angikshika, trilogy, dialogue and chastisement
 shukraniti ke tikaakar, bi0ke0 sarkaar ke anusaar, ‘‘dandniti shashan karne tathaa nirdesh dene se sambandhit vidya he
 "it is fair to say that the importance of punishment and policy that Venus has given in various contexts is the importance of politics, ie politics
 dand niti yaa nitishastra ke alaava jitne shaastra hai, ve sampoorn maanav vyavhaar ke simit bhaag se hi sambandhit hote hai, kintu nitishastra sampoorn maanav vyavhaar se sambandhit shaastra he
 Only with the help of this scripture does the king succeed in fulfilling his basic obligations, but the king who abandons the policy and behaves well, suffers and his servants also suffer
 shyaamalaal pande ne shukraniti saar kaa mahatv bataate hue kaha he ki yah pracheen bharat kii dand pradhan vichaardhaara par aadhaarit ekmaatr uplabdh granth he
 According to Shukracharya, ethics can be considered the main reason for religion, meaning, work and the element that ensures salvation
 shukraniti main raajnneetik chintan ke samast mahatvapurn pakshon - darshanik, avadharanatmak, sanrachanaatmak, prakriyaatmak ko paryaapt mahatv ke saath chitrit kiya gaya he
 The subjects of the state, the control of the state, etc
, along with the theoretical aspects, such as punishment and judicial process, administration of the state, security and war of the state, inter-state relations, etc
, such topics which are related to the practical aspects of the state, have been elaborated
 shukraniti main rajya kii utpatti ke siddhanth kaa vistrut vivechan nahin kiya gaya he
 There is only one verse in the entire book which can be considered to be related to the origin of the kingdom
 shukraniti ke pratham adhyay main kaha gaya he, ‘‘praja se apana vaarshik kar vetan ke rup main sweekaar karne se swami ke rup main sthit raja ko brahma ne praja ke paalnarth sevak banaaya he’’
 Thus, where Brahma, by stating the origin of the kingdom, has supported the divine principle of origin of the kingdom, by emphasizing the responsibility of obeying the king as a public servant and has not accepted any kind of divine authority
 shukr ne rajya ko ek anivaary evam swaabhaavik sanstha sweekaar kiya he kyonki is sansar ke abhyuday kaa aadhaar rajya he
 Just as the moon is the reason for the rise of the sea, similarly the state is the root of the rise of the people
 rajya hi nyaay dwaara dharm, arth, kaam kii siddhi karaata he
 Just as the boat is destroyed in the absence of the seafarer, similarly in the absence of the leadership of the king, the people are likely to be destroyed
 shukr ne rajya ko praja kii bhautik suraksha ke liye hi nahin, varan naitik utthan ke liai bhi uttaradaayi mana he
 In ancient Indian thought, the state is defined as the Weekend State, Venus is also no exception
 rajya saat ango se bana saavyavi he, yah swami, amaatya, mitra, kosh, raashtra, durg, sena se bana he
 "these seven constructive elements of the state have swami head, amatya eye, friend karna, kosh mukha, army mana, fort arms and nation legs," says Shukraniti
 ’’ ek anya prasang main rajya kii tulana vriksh se karte huai raja ko is vriksh kaa mul, mantriyon ko skandh, senapati ko shakha, sena ko pallav, praja ko dhul, bhoomi se praapt hone vaale karkon ko fal evam rajya kii bhoomi ko beej kaha gaya hai
 It is noteworthy that while modern political thinkers consider 4 constructive elements of the state - population, land, government and sovereignty, Venus considers 7 constructive elements
 shukraniti main rajya va raashtra ke madhya antar ko spasht karte huai kaha gaya he ki kisi vishisht raashtra par samprabhu kaa niyantran use rajya kaa rup pradaan kar detaa he
 In this way, Shukraniti makes the difference between state and nation as clear as modern political thinkers
 shukraniti main rajya ke kaary kshetra ko atyant vyapak bataaya gaya he
 Venus has mentioned 8 major areas of state duties- rajya ke dayitvon kii is suchi se yah spasht he ki shukr ne rajya ke vistrut kaaryakshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 It has also made it clear that the state should also acquire the necessary means to fulfill its obligations
 shukr ne rajya ke kaaryakshetra main nimnlikhit pramukh kaary sammilit kiye hai :- According to Venus, the fund has fundamental importance for the defense and prosperity of the army and the nation
 kintu raja ko kosh kaa anyaaypurvak sangrah nahin karnaa chahie
 If the king collects more money from the people to fight the crisis, then at the end of the crisis, the subjects should return the money with interest
 shukr ne rajpad ko kendriya mahatv pradaan kiya he, raja kaa pramukh kartavya praja-ranjan he
 Without the king, the subjects are destroyed, just as the boat without the boat is destroyed
 jaisaa ki ullekh kiya gaya he shukr ne raja ko aath devataaon ke ansh se nirmit bataaya he
 Venus is an Indian thinker who has opposed the notion of the king being the direct god
 shukr ne na to raja ko ‘dev‘ sweekaar kiya he or na hi uske daivi adhikaar maane he, parantu uske dayitvon kii divyata kaa spashtikaran avashya hi kiya hen
 Due to the divinity of obligations, even the ruler himself cannot be free from these obligations by his own will
 rajdharm kaa paalan karne se kshudra raja bhi shrenshth ban jaataa he, jabaki iske vipareet aacharan karne se uttam raja bhi kshudra ban jaataa he
 Venus has also given importance to the moral basis in the classification that the king's income should be without suffering for the people and this is only the classification related to the monarchy
 shukr ne yah pratipaadit kiya he ki shashan kaa uttaradhikari rajkul main se hi liya janaa chahie, kintu raja ke jyeshtha putr ko swatah hi shashan kaa uttaradhikari nahin maan lenaa chahie
 It is good to determine the question of succession only when the king is alive
 anek vyaktiyon ke sthaan par ek vyakti ko hi uttaradhikari nishchit karnaa chahie
 Venus has strongly denied the idea of dividing the state to solve the question of succession because the division is expected to be destroyed by the enemy
 uttaradhikaar ke daavedaaron main aise matbhed bhi ho sakate hai jo rajya evam rajkul ke liai vinaash kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Therefore, a life of royal honor and respect should be arranged for all of them, so that they can remain satisfied
 shukraniti main shaasha ko vyapak shaktiyaan pradaan kii gai he, parantu shaasha se inkaa prayog vidhi evam dharm ke anusaar karne kii apeksha kii gai he
 Venus has suggested three measures to prevent kings from becoming autocratic and arbitrary - shukr ne shaasha se paramparaon, pratishthit saamaajik mulyon aadi kaa niyantran maanane kii apeksha kii he
 The moral measures suggested by Shukraniti Saar can include the teachings of the king, the teachings of policy and philosophy, the parables presented by the king's assistants and advisors, the system of parochial pleasures and sorrows, the king's various duties, the king's routine, etc
 prashasnic kshetra main shashan kii prakrutiyon kaa uchit paraamarsh raja ko nitibhrasht hone se bachaane ke liye aavashyak mana gaya he
 Venus has propounded the need for the ruler's loyalty to the consultants of ministers etc
 for the smooth functioning of the kingdom, as well as requiring the officials appointed to consult him to always give proper advice to the king
 yahan tak ki apatkaal main bhi raja ko swatantra nahin mana he
 He is able to take drastic decisions only with the consent of the parties concerned
 nyaayayik kshetra main udaseenta ke vyavhaar ko shaasha ke ghor naitik aparaadh kii sangya di he, tathaa chetavanee di he ki aisa karne par vah narak main jayega
 For the decisions of judicial lawsuits, there is a definite and fair procedure to be followed by the king
 shukr ne nyaay sabha ke sadasyon kii yogyata va nyaay sadhano kaa vistrut vivaran diya he
 It is clear from the above description that Venus has considered the opposition of a king who is unrighteous, arbitrary and destroys the nation and has considered various ethical measures and statutory measures as well as legislative measures for his control
 mahabharat ke anushaasan parv main bhi dusht raja ko saakshaat kaliyug maanate hue, uske vadh ko uchit mana he
 It is noteworthy that Venus has accepted the system of control or emancipation of the evil and arbitrary king and has not supported his slaughter
 shukraniti saar ke anusaar sabhi vidyaon main ati kushal raja ke liye bhi rajkaarya jaise atikathin kaary ko akele hi karnaa asambhav hota he
 Hence the king should consult his assistants
 shukr ke anusaar jo raja mantri ke munh se kahi gayi hit-ahit kii baton par gaur nahin karata he vah raja hokar bhi vastav main daaku ke samaan keval praja ke dhan ko luutane vaala hi hota he
 Venus has used the word 'nature' for the members of the council of ministers
 altekar ke anusaar, ‘‘shukr kaa mat he ki keval bhojan va vivaah ke avasaron par hi jati kii poochtacha kii jaani chahie, mantriparishad main niyukti ke samay nahin
 Venus has no objection to keeping a military department under the Shudra, if he is qualified and royalist
 ‘‘ vastav main shukr kaa mat pracheen bharat kii udaar parampara ke anuroop he
 Shantiparva has clearly mentioned the appointment of three qualified Shudras in addition to the first three varnas in the mantriparishad
 pratinidhi ko itnaa yogya hona chahiai ki vah desh, kaal va sthaan ke sandarbh main karne yogya evam na karne yogya kaaryo kii pahchaan rakhata ho
 The third member of the Council of Ministers is the head who has the ability to conduct a general inspection of all the functions of governance
 chauthaa sadsy sachiv he, jo apane kaaryon kii drushti se yuddh mantri he
 He has complete knowledge of the army and its functions
 paanchavaa sadsy mantri kaa he, jise aadhunik drushti se videsh mantri yaa pararashtra mantri kah sakate he
 The sixth member is Prudivac, who is the Chief Justice and also the principal political officer of the Department of Justice
 use shastrokt evam lok prachlit aachaar kaa gyaata hona chahie
 The seventh member should be a scholar of the element of religion
 aathven sadsy sumantra ko shukr kaa vitt mantri yaa koshadhyaksh kaha ja saktaa he, jise aay-vyay kii sampoorn jaankaree honi chahie
 The ninth member should be a knower of amatya country and articles
 vah rajya main sthit nagaron, graamon, jangalon kii bhoomi kii maap kaa hisaab rakhata he or inase hone vaali aay kaa bhi vivaran rakhata he
 The last place in the order of priority is that of the messenger
 vah shadgunyamantra kaa gyaata, acha vaktaa, nirbhik, desh va kaal kii sthiti ko samajhane vaala hona chahie
 K
 According to P
 Jaiswal, in the ancient Indian political texts, the functioning of the Council of Ministers has been elaborated only in Shukranitisar
 bi
 ke
 sarkaar ke anusaar is granth main mantri parishad kii kaary pranali ke bare main agralikhit tathyon ko spasht kiya he - Members and assistants of the Council of Ministers together prepare an article on any subject related to their department
 is lekh par sarvapratham raja kii tippanee dwaara iske dosha ko samaapt kiya jaataa he
 After this, all the ministers are consulted, so that coordination and cooperation is maintained in all departments
 is lekh par sabhi mantriyon dwaara apni mudra sahit hastakshar kiye jate he
 Finally, the king revisits and gives his final decision
 is prakaar yah prakriya rajya ke liye laabhadaayak he kyonki raja likhit rup main sabaki raay bhi jaan letaa he evam antim nirnay kaa adhikaar apane paas surakshit rakhata he
 Venus mentions two types of administration - central administration and local administration
 kendriya prashasan main rajbhrityon ke mahatv ko bataate hue shukr ne raja ko paraamarsh diya he ki vah rajya kii unnati ke liye anek gyanvaan evam guni sahaayakon kii niyukti kare
 Venus has mentioned seven types of sevaks and has elaborated on the qualifications related to the appointment of officers, assistants and servants of all classes
 shukr ne sthaneey prashasan ke sanghathan kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, jisamen agralikhit 6 adhikariyon kaa ullekh he - It is imperative for efficient administration that the king keep a close watch on the officers' actions
 shukraniti main kaha gaya he ki yadi sau prajajan kisi adhikari ke viruddh aavedan patr de den, to us adhikari ko padchyut kar dena chahie
 Venus has advised that the king should take away his powers from unjust officials
 niyantran ke liye yah bhi anivaary he ki ek pad par ek vyakti adhik samay tak na rahe
 a person should be appointed to the post only on merit
 shukraniti main prashasan ke 20 vibhaagon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he- gaj, ashv, swarna, rajat vibhaag aadi
 The post of president of these departments is normally called Karma Secretary, but with this, the noun of the president, husband or suzerain has been used for the post of president
 shukraniti main pratipaadit prashasnic sanghathan bahustareey he
 In addition to organized departments at the central level of administration, Venus has highlighted the organizational structure of local, rural and urban administration
 shukr kaa mat he ki prayek gram or prayek nagar main sahsaadhyaksh gram kaa adhyaksh bhagahaar kii niyukti kii jaani chahie
 The professional and technical qualifications of personnel employed at all levels of administration are mentioned in detail in the Venus policy
 shukr ne prashasan kii karyaalay paddati main likhit aadesh ko atyadhik mahatv diya he
 According to him, officers or assistants should not do any work without a written decree, because only the written order containing the Rajamudra and signature of the king is the actual king, the person is not the king
 shukr ne raja ke likhit aadesh ko smriti patr ke rup main surakshit rakhane kii pranali ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Along with this, he has also laid emphasis on preparing daily, monthly, annual and multi-year reports in administration
 prashasan ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye shukr ne soochnaaon kii pratidin prapti par jor diya he
 He is of the opinion that the king should receive information from far-flung territories every day
 shukr ne rajkeey karyaalayon kii suraksha ke liye paharedaaron va rakshakon kii vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya he
 From the point of view of the personnel system, Shukraniti can be considered as a unique text, because the exact, systematic and complete depiction of the various aspects of the personnel system is available in it, it is not found anywhere
 rajya karmchaariyon ke liai aachaar samhita : samast rajkarmchaariyon se aacharan ke saamaanya niyamon ke paalan kii apeksha kii gai he
 Employees following these rules or code of conduct are described as the best personnel in the book
 shukr ke anusaar, bhrity ko swami ke prati tathaa apane seva kaary ke prati puri tarah se samarpit hokar kaary karnaa chahie
 He should courteously inspire the king for good work and should never be merely sycophantic
 karmchaariyon ko kabhi bhi praja se jhuthe vaade nahin karne chahie
 Inappropriate actions such as bribery, gambling, anger, hostility etc
 should be abandoned
 uparyukt gunon ke vipareet kaary karne waalon ko shukr ne nikrusht mana he
 Salary, Pay Scale and Increment: In the principle of pay, both the work and the period have been made the basis, ie, the amount of work done in a certain period is given only on the basis of allowance
 shukr ne raja ko yah paraamarsh diya he ki vah vetan main katautee nahin kare or sadaiv niyat samay par hi vetan de
 It has been clearly proposed in the Shukrniti that the minimum salary of the personnel should be so that the dependents can be easily maintained
 vetanmanon ko shreshth, madhyam, sam va hin main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Venus warns the king that the employees with very low wages get dissatisfied with the rule and start taking interest in other tasks than state work
 atah jaise-jaise bhrity kii yogyata main vruddhi ho, vaise-vaise uske vetan main bhi vruddhi honi chahie, kyonki isse ant main swayan raja kaa hit hota he
 Service Period, Promotion and Degradation: In normal condition, the service period of an employee - 40 years is accepted, but with this, the recruitment should always be held and in the event of demerit, the act should be relieved
 shukraniti main karmchaariyon kii samaybaddh padonnati ke bare main spasht praavdhaan kiya gaya he, jab koi carmik apane anubhav ke aadhaar par apane pad se shreshth hota jaae to use uttarotar shreshth pad par niyukt kiya janaa chahie
 On the contrary, if a chief servant ignores his obligations due to laziness etc
, then he should be made an unreserved servant
 shukr ne bhrityon ke prashikshan kii vyavastha bhi kii he
 Pension, Compensation, Provident Fund and Bonus Arrangement: After completing 40 years in the Raj Seva, money should be given lifetime as pension after retirement
 keval pension hi nahin paariwarik pension kii vyavastha bhi he
 Raj has also accepted the scheme of provident fund for employees
 raja ko carmik ke vetan kii kul raashi kaa 1 / 6 yaa 1 / 4 bhaag katkar apane yahaan jamaa kar lenaa chahie or do yaa teen varsh baad, us jamaa raashi ke aadhe yaa puure bhaag kaa bhugtan carmik ko kar dena chahie
 Rules for rest and leisure: There is a system of 12 hours of daily work for regular workers
 karmchaariyon ko upyukt interval par tathaa vishisht paristhitiyon main kaary se avkaash pradaan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa vyakt kii gai he evam vistrut niyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 No work will be done by the employees on the day of celebration etc
 yadi koi adhik aavashyak kaary ho to utsav vaale din bhi karaane kii vyavastha kii gai he, parantu shraadh ke din kisi bhi prakaar ke kaary kaa spasht nishedh kiya gaya he
 Arrangements have also been made to provide leave to personnel at fixed intervals every day
 karmchaariyon ke aswasth ho jane par unhen ‘savetan‘ va ardhvethan avkaash kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Every year 15 days paid leave is also provided along with health leave
 kintu jab koi yogya bhrity biimaar ho jaae, uski beemaari kii avadhi kii upeksha karke use sadaiv aadha vetan avashya hi diya janaa chahie
 Thus Shukraniti is such a text of ancient Indian political thought
 jisamen carmik vyavastha kaa itnaa vistrut va vyapak vivaran diya gaya he, tathaa jo karmchaariyon ke hiton par aadhaarit he
 Venus has accepted moral values according to the country, time, position, instead of eternal moral values in social life
 shukr ne pracheen bhartiya parampara ke anusaar samaaj sanghathan kaa pramukh aadhaar varna evam ashram vyavastha ko hi sweekaar kiya he
 But he is not as rigid and very conservative as Manu
 shukr ne saamanytah janm par aadhaarit varna vyavastha ko sweekaara he
 But with this, Varna system is also supported on the basis of karma
 shukr ne brahman, kshatriya, vaisya, shudra- chaaron varnon ke paramparaagat kaaryo kaa ullekh kiya he
 And with this it is said that a person of Brahmin varna should follow the four ashrams called Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyas
 kintu anya shesh teen varno dwaara pratham teen ashramon kaa paalan paryaapt hota he
 According to Venus, castes are formed on the basis of occupations, hence it was possible to create many castes
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne manu aadi dharamshastriyon kii tarah saarvajanik jivan main varna evam jati ke mahatv ko badha-chadhaakar prastut nahin kiya he
 He is of the opinion that varna and caste have special importance in practices like marriage and food
 raashtra ke prashasan main shukr ne varna evam jati kii tulana main vyakti ke karm, sheel evam gun ko hi mahatvapurn mana he or raja ko nirdesh diya he ki vah rajkeey adhikariyon evam bhrityon kii niyukti main vyakti ke karm, sheel evam gun ko hi aadhaar banaae
 Venus has not demonstrated the superior superiority of Brahmins or inferiority of Shudras
 is drushti se dandshastri shukr kii samaaj vyavastha manu se adhik udaar, yathartwaadee evam vyaavhaarik he
 Following the ancient Indian tradition, Venus has imposed two controls on the king's right to levy taxes
 raja brahma dwaara niyukt aisa praja sevak he, jo praja se kar ke rup main apana vetan praapt karata he, atah praja paalan ke karttavya kii purti ke liye hi raja ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hota he
 The king should follow the rules of memory for tax assessment, the king does not have the right to determine or collect arbitrary tax
 rajya ke strot ke rup main kar kaa swaroop aisa hona chahie kii ped se fal tod liya jaae kintu ped, pattiyon,tahaniyon ko nuksaan naa pahunche| raja ko mali ke rup main fal kaa upyog kar beej ko punah ropit kar dena chahie| There are two types of taxation system in Shukraniti essence - sthaneey kar pranali National Tax System
 shukracharya ne sthaneey aavashkataaon kii purti ke liye sthaneey karadhaan ke siddhanth ko sweekaara he jaise-nagar ke grihon kii rakshak police kaa bharan-poshan grihasthon se praapt vetan se kiya janaa chahie
 This includes all taxes other than local
 isamen do kaalon ke prasang main kar niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 General tax policy saamanyakalin niti :- saamaanya kaal main shukr ne praja kii aarthik kshamta ko dhyaan main rakhkar kar lagane kaa nirdesh diya he
 He opines that the fee should be taken in such a quantity that the taxpayer's original capital does not end
 raja ko bhaag ke sangrah main mali kii pravriti kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 The tax should be taken in such a way that it is in the interest of both the king and the subjects, the tax should not be taken unjustly and unjustly; on doing so, the king is destroyed
 jo raja apane kosh main vruddhi chahta he, use praja paalan kaa daayitv avashya hi puraa karnaa chahie
 In times of crisis, the king has the right to increase the amount of tax and also to impose taxes on tax-free items in general
 isiilie shukr ne saamanyakaal main tirthasthan va devsthan ko karmukt mana he, kintu sankatkaal main nahin
 Venus has accepted the system of taxation as well as taxation in terms of economic development of the people
 gharelu upbhog hetu kharide jane vaale dhaany evam vastra, kutumb-paalan hetu dudharu pashu ko pashu kar se mukti, vyapaar main haani uthaane vaala saudagar, tirth snaan va dev sthaan nae udyog lagane yaa nae krishi kaary main jab tak duguna laabh-praapt na ho jaae is niti se shukr kii lok kalyankari niti kaa gyaan praapt hota he
 It is a tax levied on agricultural produce
 bhaag kii vasuuli ke liye 3 pramukh aadhaaron kaa ullekh kiya gaya he - According to Venus, one can recover the inheritance with the help of a rich man, with the help of an act called Grampal or with the help of an officer called Matharhar
 shukr ne bhartiya parampara ke anusaar anaaj yaa nakad ke rup main kar lene kaa ullekh kiya he
 When the farmer submits the part, he should be given a government printed part
 shulk : shukr ke anusaar raja ko us kreta yaa vikreta se shulk praapt karnaa chahie, jo aarthik len dein main laabh kii sthiti main ho shulk kii vasuuli main chal kapat nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Size-tax: In ancient India, the tax levied on mineral production was called and taxed as a commodity
 shukr ke anusaar raja utpaadan par hone vaale vyay ko katkar, khan se utpann hone vaali dhaatuon-swarna, rajat, tamba aadi par alag-alag dar se yah kar praapt karata tha
 The more expensive the metal, the higher the size and tax was
 trin kaashthadi par kar : eendhan ke liye jangal se lakdi ekatrit karne waalon par, yah kar vastu ke rup main liya jaataa tha
 Animal tax: Animal husbandry was a major occupation in ancient India, so there was a tradition of taxing it
 bakrii, bhed, gaay, bhens, aadi sabhi par kar lagaaya jaataa tha
 The rate varied
 byaaj kar : raja ko sahuukaar kii byaaj kaa 32waan hissaa kar ke rup me praapt karne kaa adhikaar tha
 Tax on residential and commercial land: There should be the same rate of tax on this land as fixed for agricultural land
 yatri kar : manu ne jalmaarg par, jabaki shukr ne thalmaarg par kar kaa ullekh kiya he
 Arrangements have been made to collect taxes from passengers for road safety, repair and cleaning
 hastshilpiyon va kalakaaron par kar : shukr ke anusaar kaarigaron va shilpiyon se ek paksh main ek din nickshulk kaary karaayaa janaa chahie
 It is clear from the above discussion of the prohibitive and positive rules laid down in Shukraniti in relation to the tax system that the tax system of the state has been provided in accordance with the expectations of the 'public welfare state'
 shukr ne nyaay kaary ke mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue raja ke 8 pradhan karttavyon main dusht-nigrah ko shaamil kiya he
 This judicial process helps the subjects to practice religion
 raja kaa karttavya he ki vah mukademon kaa uchit prakaar se nirnay kare or is bare main sattapurvak prajajan se apane nirnay kaa paalan karwaae
 Venus has not given a detailed explanation of the conceptual aspect of justice, as is available in Kautilya's Arthashastra and Manusmriti
 nyaay ke sansthagat or prakriyaatmak paksh kaa shukr ne vistrut vivaran diya he
 The rights and responsibilities of the parties related to the organization of judiciary, judicial process and litigations have been discussed in detail
 shukr dwaara nyaayik prakriya ke antargat raja evam sabha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he tathaa vishesh prasangon main sahaayta karne ke liye ‘juri‘ kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 In Shukraniti, the king has been considered as the main deciding or supreme authority of the entire judicial system, but it has been made clear that the king is only the formal head of the judiciary
 shukr ne raja se shastron ke anuroop nyaayik kaaryon ko bhalee bhaanti dekhne kii apeksha kii gai he
 The king has also mentioned the serious consequences of taking decisions without the consent of the councilors alone
 sabha - shukr ne rajya ke kendriya nyaayalay ko sabha yaa nyaayasabha kaha he
 The gathering is a place where the temporal conduct and interests of a person are examined according to the law of memory
 shukr ne aise das sadhano kaa ullekh kiya he, jinaki madad se sabha nyaay-kaary ko bhalee bhaanti main samarth hoti he
 These ten tools are- shukr ke anusaar, sabha main pratham sthaan raja kaa hota he, jo sabha kaa sabhapatitv karata he
 The king can appoint his representative in the assembly, which Venus has called pradevivaka, which besides the assembly is also a member of the Council of Ministers
 shukr ne brahman varna ko praathamikta dene ke saath hi sabhi jatiyon se sabha ke sadsy bananaa sweekaar kiya he
 Ambika Prasad Vajpayee has said, "venus has given a special principle in relation to the councilors
 jin logon kaa vivaad ho unhi ke vyavsaay se sabhasad banaae jaae, jaise- kisaanon ke vivaad main kisaan kyonki vahi apane vyavsaay ke niyamon ke vishay main adhik acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 "this description of Shukraniti makes his judicial system more liberal, rational and realistic
" mukhya nyaayadhish : raja ke baad yahi sarvocch nyaayik padaadhikari mana gaya he
 According to Venus, such a person should be appointed on this post
 jiskaa vidhi-shaastra kaa gyaan atyant vyapak va vishesh ho tathaa jisaki nishpakshta va nishtha andeh se pare ho
 Personnel and resources of the court: Court should provide proper number of employees and resources, otherwise the court cannot do its work smoothly
 atah shukr kaa mat he ki vahi nyaayasabha pavitra hoti he, jisamen mukademen ke nirnay ke liye aavashyak samast saadhan uplabdh ho
 The arbitrary behavior of judges has been prohibited in Shukraniti
 unke liye kuch niyamon kii vyavastha kii gai he
 The king should carry out his duty of justice properly and while doing justice, following the traditions of different castes, categories and clans, should decide and follow the religion
 sabhaasadon ko sabha main satya avashya kahana chahie
 At the time of the judicial process, the king or judge must conduct respectfully to the plaintiff
 vyavhaar : saral shabdon main vyavhaar kaa arth he- 'nyaayalay main chalane vaale mukademe kii nyaayik prakriya'
 It is through this judicial process that it is known who is a criminal and who is innocent
 vyavhaar ke charan : shukr ne mukademe kii nyaayik prakriya ke chaar charan sweekaar kiye he
 Any litigation begins with a written or oral statement of the antecedent as to whether a lawsuit is made
 iske baad doosraa charan pratipaksh prarambh hota he
 Now the court questions and questions both the plaintiff and the defendant
 yadi nyaayalay yah anubhav karata he ki vastav main kanoon kii drushti se koi mukadmaa banataa he, to mukadmaa apane tritiy charan arthath kriyaapad main pravesh karata he
 Otherwise it ends in the second foot
 kriya paad ke antargat mukademe main prastut vibhinn pramaanon kii kadi jaanch kii jaati he or mukademen main nihit satya va asaty kii jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 Venus has given two basic types of all evidences - shukr ne daivi pramaan ko maanush pramaan se kam mahatvapurn mana he or isliai kisi bhi prakaar ke maanush pramaan ke abhaav main devi pramaan ko uchit bataaya he
 The fourth and final phase of the judicial process is the decision footing
 shukr ne 6 prakaar ke nirnay bataae he - According to Venus, with the announcement of the decision, a winning letter should be given to the winner
 ise ek kanoonee dastavej ke rup main bhi manyata pradaan kii he
 Both the plaintiff and the defendant must appear in the court
 shukr ne apane purvavartiyon ke vipareet nai vyavasthaaon jaise-punarvichaar sammaan, jamaanat or niyogi kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 According to Venus, the Niyogi should have knowledge of the law and he should charge according to the rules
 shukr ne aparaadh ke das prakaaron kaa ullekh kiya he- inamen rajagna kaa ulanghan, stri kii hatya, chori karnaa aadi sammilit he
 In fact, these 10 crimes are crimes against the state, society, morality and religion
 shukr ne dandaneey aparaadhon main 50 prakaar ke chhalon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Venus considered these crimes committed against the king
 shukr ne sabhi prakaar ke aparaadhon ko chaar mul virgo main baanta he - Physical crime is committed by body, speech by speech, mental crime by mind and worldly crime by association or cooperation with someone
 shukr kaa mat he ki prayek aparaadh kii guruta evam laghutaa ko jaanakar hi apradhi ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 a detailed classification of the categories of crimes has been made in Shukraniti, which expresses the systematic, practical and scientific view of Shukraniti concerning crimes
 shukraniti main saamaajik, aarthik, naitik, rajnatik, va prashasnic samast prakaar ke aparaadhon ko mahatv pradaan karte hue unke pratikaar kii apeksha kii gai he
 In Shukraniti, there is a provision of not giving life sentence and justification for providing punishment for killing only for a serious crime like treason
 pracheen bhartiya parampara main ‘dand‘ shabd ke anek arth he
 Here Venus has two meanings of punishment - yadhyapi anyatra shukr ne dand kaa arth sena, yuddh evam nyaay vyavastha ko bhi sweekaar kiya he, vastav main dand janata ko bure aacharan se mukti dilaataa he
 The punished policy of the king proves all works and punishment is the ultimate protector of religions
 shukr ne manu va yajyavlky ke samaan hi nyaayik prashasan yaa aparaadh unmoolan ke sandarbh main dand ke agralikhit chaar prakaar sweekaar kiye he - According to Venus, it is advisable to only give a good man or a middle man a speech or a dhikand, they do not have a corrective effect on the unhappy men, so this punishment is not for them
 shukr ne aparaadh va dand ke parsparik sambandh ko sweekaar kiya he
 The king who acts after taking care of this relationship of crime and punishment, is satisfied by the people
 keval apradhi hi dandaneey he
 Immortal is always indomitable
 dand kii maatra, aparaadh ke anusaar hi honi chahie
 He cannot be punished arbitrarily
 raja ko dand dene main atyadhik kathor nahin hona chahie
 Venus has arranged different punishments for the same type of crime for superior, middle, and half-male men, which makes the asymmetric side of Venus's punishment policy clear
 parantu shukr ne aise aparaadhon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, jinamein dand sabko samaan diya jaataa he, jaise- rajdroh
 It is noteworthy that Venus has adopted a more egalitarian system in the field of punishment than Manu
 aadhunik dand siddhanth kii drushti se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shukr ne pratikaratmak dand siddhanth ko sweekaar nahin kiya he parantu shukraniti main avarohak, nirodhak or sudharatmak dand siddhanton ko avashya hi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Venus, under the tradition of ancient Indian Acharyas, has given a detailed discussion of 'per-nation relations' i
e
 their state and the mutual relations of other states
 adhyayan kii drushti se ham in vichaaron ko do pramukh bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate he - Venus did not mention the divisional doctrine similar to Kautilya, but has accepted the existence of four types of states
 shukr ne rajyon ke vargeekaran kaa aadhaar unki bhugolic sthiti ko nahin mana he apitu vijigishu raja evam anya rajyon ke bich unke rajait kii sthiti ko mana he
 Venus has given enough importance to the Rajhit and Shakti elements in the operation of the Parashtra policy
 unke anusaar prayek raja apane rajait ko hi saadhy maanata he or jab vijigishu raja anya rajyon ke sandarbh main apni shakti ke anusaar niti ke upayon evam shadgun mantra ke sadhano kaa kushaltam prayog karata hai to use safalataa milti he
 According to Venus, just as a snake, elephant and lion are administered by the king, in the same way, the king should make a friend and foe as his captive by appropriate measures
 shukr ne niti ke chaar paramparaagat upayon kaa hi ullekh kiya he - Content policy can only be used against both friend and foe
 shanti va maitri kii niti se jahaan mitrataa adhik majboot hoti he
 At the same time, help and cooperation towards the enemy king is also certain
 shatru ke prati saamaniti kaa prayog donon rajyon kii aapasi suraksha main abhivruddhi karnaa he
 Donation policy is also used towards both enemy and friend
 mitra raja se yah kahana ki meri sabhi vastuen, yahan tak ki jivan bhi, tumhaara he, mitra ke prati daan niti kehalaati hai
 Giving direct money to the enemy king is called a donation policy towards him
 bhed niti ke prayog ko shukr ne mitra ke viruddh anuchit mana he, kintu kuch sthitiyon main uchit bhi mana he
 Three types of discrimination policy can be used against the enemy king - isamen atirikt bhed ke dwaara shatru raja va uski rajbhakt praja ke madhya matbhed utpann karaae ja sakate he
 Punishment can also be used against both friends and enemies
 mitra raja ko yah chetavanee dena ki vah yadi manamaana vyavhaar karegaa to main tumhaara mitra nahin rahoonga- dand niti he
 Whereas to show the faults of enemy king, destroy money, suffer in war, it is punishable
 yadyapi shukr dwaara mitra raajaaon ke prati bhed va dand niti ko aniatik kaha ja saktaa he, lekin yah unki yathartwaadee niti he
 According to Venus, the king should use these four policy measures after careful consideration
 shukr ne atyant prabal shatru ke liye sam or daan kaa, apane se adhik balavaan ke liye sam or bhed kaa, apane baraabar shakti vaale ke liye bhed or dand kaa prayog uchit mana he
 This means - a specific concept with 6 properties
 yadhyapi kautilya ke samaan shukr ne in gunon kaa vistaar se vivechan nahin kiya he
 Its 6 properties are as follows- sandhi :- shukr ne sandhi ko aisa saadhan mana he, jiske dwaara shaktishaalee shatru se hinabal raja kii mitrataa hoti he arthath hinabal raja ko suraksha praapt hoti he
 Underlining the importance of the treaty, he said, "just as no one can cut or uproot a group of bamboos surrounded by thick thorns, in the same way no one can defeat a king, even with a mulch
 
 ’’ shukr ekmaatr aise pracheen acharya he, jo apane hit kii purti ke liye anarya raja se bhi sandhi ko bhi uchit maanate he
 Deity: Deity means the end of the policy of peace and cooperation between kings and the beginning of tension and conflict
 jis kaary dwaara shatru ko peedit kiya jaae or adheen kiya jaae, use vigrah kehete he
 In fact, the Deity is such a policy, by which the powerful king, by suffering the weak king, forces him to walk according to himself, without direct war
 yahi kaaran he ki budhimaan raja ko sandhi se bandhe hue shatru kaa bhi vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Giving the example of Vritrasura-slaughter by Indra, Venus has said that Indra also did this by making a pact with a pledge not to reprimand
 kintu shukr ne balavaan shatru se vigrah kaa nishedh kiya he
 In the end, Venus has considered the Deity justified when there is no option left for defense
 yaan :- jab apane icchit hit kii prapti ke liye shatru raja kaa naash aavashyak hota he or is uddeshy se us par akraman kiya jaataa he, tab ise yaan kehete he
 The negative objective of the vehicle is to destroy the enemy
 kintu sakaaratmak uddeshy he, aarthik sainik, va raajnneetik laabh kii prapti
 Only the powerful king should use the vehicle against the weak king
 asana :- jahaan anya aacharyo ne asana kaa arth - shatru raja ke prati upeksha tatasthta evam niskriyata kii niti mana he
 Venus has considered it a military siege of the enemy king's fort or city, which, while protecting itself, forces the enemy to contact on its own terms
 asana dwaara shatru raja kii rasad pankti nasht kar di jaati he
 Internal dissatisfaction arises on enemy side due to lack of war material and food items etc
 or tab vah shatru raja vivash hokar adheenta sweekaar kar letaa he
 Shelter: - When a weak king's kingdom is destroyed by a powerful enemy king or there is a crisis of such defeat, the weak king should take shelter of another powerful king for his protection, which can increase his power
 dwaidhi bhav :- iskaa shabdic arth he ek hi samay main do bhaavon kaa paaya janaa jo prakat rup main dikhaaya jaataa he
 In secret, it is treated exactly opposite
 prakat rup main mitrataa evam gupt rup main shatruta isaki visheshta he
 In the operation of the army, Venus has also mentioned the double sentiment
 sena ko anek tukadiyon main baantkar shatru ko prakat rup main apane sainik bal ke bare main rakhana dwaidhi bhav he
 Venus has mentioned four major institutional tools for practical operation - doot : doot ko shukr ne mantriparishad ke 10 sadasyon main bhi sthaan diya he
 He does the work related to diplomacy and foreign policy
 vah raja kaa aisa bhramanshil pratinidhi he jo anya raajaaon se samvaad sthapit karata he
 Therefore, he should be skilled in speech art, who understands the state of the country and time, understands the heart feeling of others and has a fearless nature
 guptchar : shukraniti main arthshaastra ke samaan guptchar kii vyavastha kaa vyapak ullekh nahin kiya gaya he
 There is also silence about the types of intelligence, intelligence administration is the main means of protecting the king and the state from external and internal enemies
 guptchar kaa kaary he- raja ke shatru sevakon va praja ke vyavhaar ko jaananaa va uski jaankaree raja ko dena
 The king should also test his veracity and punish untrue detectives
 sena : shukr ke anusaar sena vyaktiyon, pashuon aadi kaa samooh he, jo astr, shastr se susajjit hoti he
 Due to the army, the destruction of the enemy is possible and there is an increase of treasury, state and might
 shukr ne sainik anushaasan va acharsanhita par bhi vichaar kiya he
 The king should always make such an effort that there is no difference in his army, whereas there must be a difference in the enemy army
 yuddh main vijay praapt hon par sainikon ko bhi laabh milanaa chahie or unhen lut ke maal main bhagidaar banaakar santusht rakhana chahie
 War: Venus has acknowledged the need for war to protect against external challenges and to expand her kingdom
 sabhi raja rajya vistaar kii kaamana rakhte he
 Therefore, they also have mutual enmity
 shukr ke anusaar jab niti ke vibhinn upaay evam shadgun mantra se bhi safalataa nahin mili, tab antim saadhan ke rup main yuddh ko apnaanaa chahie
 Shukraniti is probably the only text in ancient Indian texts, in which war is defined
 shukr ke anusaar, paraspar shatru bhav rakhte hue do raajaaon kaa astr-shastr kaa prayog karnaa yuddh he
 Venus mentions two types of war, based on the observance and violation of moral rules in war
 dharm yuddh, evam kutayudh
 Venus has given details of the moral rules of the crusade
 kintu unhone manu kii tarah kutayudh par dharm yuddh kii shreshthata kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 Venus clearly states that a religious war or a code war in which the enemy is destroyed is only appropriate
 vastav main shukr ne yathartwaadee drushtikon apanaate hue dharm yuddh par kuta yuddh ko variyata di he
 Venus did not consider war to be a sinful and heinous act, but mentioned that a Kshatriya gets good results when he dies in war
 kshatriya ke liye yuddh ko pavitra kartavya maanane kaa aagrah shukr kii is apeksha ko vyakt karata he ki vah avasar aane par yuddh se palaayan na karen
 Dealing with the defeated side: Venus has advised the victorious king not to take malicious actions against the victorious kingdom and its subjects after victory in the war
 unhone vijayi raja ko vijit rajya kii praja ko prasann rakhane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Venus has expected the victorious king to conquer the enemy and collect taxes from him, according to circumstances, to occupy half of the enemy's kingdom or the entire kingdom
 uske pashchaat shatru kii praja ko har prakaar se prasann rakhe tathaa apni praja kii bhaanti hi uskaa paalan kare
 Venus has also advised the king to remove the ministerial council functioning in the conquered state and appoint a new ministerial council that is loyal to him
 yadi vah parajeet raja kaa rajya chin le to use, jaagir aadi jeevika ke liye pradaan kare
 The conquering king should not rule arbitrarily in the won state
 uski putravat raksha karte hue use prasann rakhaa janaa chahie or use apana bana lenaa chahie
 In fact, there is a sense in this description of Venus that the religious moral and social values of the subjects and society of the defeated state should be protected and the subjects should also be followed
 manu multah dharamshastreey vichaarak he, kautilya arthshaastreey vichaarak he, jabaki shukr raajnneetik vichaarak hai
 That is why they have a special place and importance in ancient Indian political thought
 altekar kaa mat he, ‘‘shukraniti main prashasnic mahatv kii aisi anek suchnaaain milti he, jo arthshaastra sahit anya kisi granth main uplabdh nahin he
 It is true that Venus did not elaborate on the theoretical aspects of the state, but in ancient India there was a tradition to throw light on the practical side
 adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye shukr ke yogadan ko nimnlikhit binduon ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he - Recognition of Dandaniti as the most prominent discipline: Venus has imitated the Dandaniti classical Oceanic school, and has demonstrated the superiority of practical and temporal knowledge over theoretical and theological knowledge
 dandniti ke prayog se raja ko sabhi falon kii siddhi hoti he, yahaan tak ki vah satyuga kii sthapana bhi kar saktaa he
 Rendering a liberal and practical socio-political system: Venus has recognized the varna system as the basis of social organization
 kintu unhone karmanusaar varna vyavastha kii dharna kaa samarthan kiya he
 Thus Venus has tried to ignore the selfishness and inefficiency inherent in the Varna system based on birth and has given the idea of re-creation of Varna system on the basis of karma, merit and talent
 varna evam jati kaa mahatv vivaah evam bhojan saamudayik jivan main hota he
 In public and political work like national administration, merit and expertise based on working and quality is more important than varna and caste
 manu kii tulana main shukr ke vichaar paryaapt udaar hai or us saamaajik parivartan kii ore sanket karte he jo unke yug main janm le rahaa tha
 Implicit theory of the state: Following the Indian tradition, the notion of 'weekend State' is accepted
 unhone rajya ke saaton angon kii tulana maanav sharir ke ango se kii he
 Venus has also given the tree a liking for the kingdom, this description of Venus is important in terms of explaining the intangible structure like the state
 rajyon kaa vargeekaran : shukranitisar aisa ekmaatr pracheen bhartiya granth he, jisane ek sunishchit aadhaar par rajtantreey rajya ke vibhinn prakaaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 This classification also points towards the imperial imperialist system of governance of ancient India
 rajpad par yathartwaadee dhang se vichaar : shukr ne manu ke samaan raja ko 'nar dev' nahin mana he
 Venus has a clear view that even after all the dignity of the Rajapada, the king is basically a servant of the people and in this form has given him the right to receive tax
 shukr ne praja paalan ko raja kaa aadharbhoot kartavya mana he
 Development of Ancient Council of Ministers: Shukraniti is the only text which clearly shows the order of preference of ministers, difference in salary, office etc
 shukr ne hi sarvapratham mantriparishad kii vibhageeya paddati, mantriyon ke vibhaag parivartan, mantralayon ke sanghathan aadi kaa ullekh kiya he
 Venus has also first made a clear mention of the definite and written functioning of the council of ministers
 kosh, arth-vyavastha evam prajahitkaari rajya : yah ullekhneey he ki kaal-saapeksh, adarsh kosh kii dharna kaa ullekh keval shukr ne hi kiya he
 This fund should be so rich that even if the tax is not collected, it will be able to protect the subjects and the army for 20 years
 shukr ekmaatr aise rajshastri he, jinhone rajya kii aay-vyay kii vaarshik yojana kaa ullekh kiya he
 Compared to Acharyas etc
 Manu, Kautilya, expenditure details of Venus are more clear, definite and fixed
 shukr ne apane vyay ke vivaran main jan kalyaan evam samaaj kalyaan par bhi bal diya he
 Description of developed administrative system: The administrative system of Venus is more complex and developed than Manusmriti
 isamen likhit karyaalay paddati, rajasevakon kii aachaar samhita, nunatam evam adhiktam vetan ke siddhanth aadi kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 Venus has also mentioned the rules of service period, promotion, demotion, training, uniforms etc
 of personnel
 shukr ne prashasan kii is carmik vyavastha ke antargat kuch aisi vyavasthaaon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo aadhunik prashasnic vyavasthaaon ke paryaapt nikat prathit hoti hai
 He has also mentioned general rest, leave, health leave, retirement including pension, family pension, provident fund, bonus etc
 nyaay prashasan kaa shreshth vivaran : yadhyapi shukr ne nyaay prashasan main dharamshastreey parampara kaa anukaran kiya he, kintu iske saath hi unhonen nyaay prashasan main kuch nae tatwon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Membership for the judicial assembly includes not only the essentiality of Brahmin varna, the jury system, summons, bail, appeals and reconsideration, Niyogi etc
 par-raashtra sambandhon kii saiddhanthik evam yathartwaadee vivechna : jahaan is kshetra main manu adarshavaadi adhik hai, vahiin shukr ne yathartwaadee sambandhon kaa pramukh aadhaar hi rajyon kii aapasi avishwasaneeyata ko sweekaar kiya he
 He has given the elements of state interest and power a major place in the conduct of foreign policy, which is similar to the modern period
 yadhyapi shukr ne parajeet raja evam parajeet pradesh ke adarshavaadi paksh kaa samarthan kiya he kintu aise vyavhaar kaa antim uddeshy yathartwaadee hi he
 Such a policy provides stability to the victorious king's victory over the defeated side
 shukr ne rajya evam raashtra ke madhya bhed ko spasht kiya he tathaa yah spasht kiya he ki raashtra sampradaay kaa niyantran hi use rajya kaa swaroop pradaan karata he
 Thus Venus has given a detailed description of the political system found under the monarchical system of governance of his era
 benny prasad kaa mat he ki shukranitisar pracheen hindu samaajik va raajnneetik parampara main likhaa gaya aisa atyant mahatvapurn granth he, jisane sabhi vishyon ko sparsh kiya he or unhen sanvaara va samrudh bhi kiya he
 According to Altekar, "this is a very important book for the scholars of ancient Indian politics

 It is possible to convert mechanical energy from any source into electrical energy
 yah urja, jalprapaat ke girte hue pani se athwa koyala jalaakar utpann kii gai ooshmaa dwaara bhav se, yaa kisi petrol athwa deazal ingine se praapt kii ja sakati he
 New sources of energy are being used
 mukhyat:, pichley kuch varshon main parmanushakti kaa prayog bhi vidyutsakti ke liye bade paimaane par kiya gaya he or bahut se deshon main parmanushakti dwaara sanchalit bijlighar banaae gaye hai
 The immense energy contained in tidal waves and volcanoes has also been used to generate electricity
 vidyutsakti ke utpaadan ke liye in sab shakti sadhano kaa upyog, vishalkay vidyut janitron dwaara hi haata he, jo mulat: farade ke 'chumbakeey kshetra main ghoomte hue chaalak par veltata preran siddhant par aadhaarit he
 This theory of Faraday can be expressed as: is prakaar vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye teen mukhya baton kii aavashyaktaa he : 1
 The magnetic field, in which the conductor is rotated, 2
 chaalak tathaa 3
 Mechanical force driving the driver in a magnetic field
 yah bhi spasht he, ki vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan vyaavhaarik banane ke liye chaalak main prerit vi
vaa
ba
 kii maatra paryaapt honi chahie
 Its volume depends on the length of the conductor, the intensity of the magnetic field and the velocity of the conductor
 vastav main ise nimnlikhit sameekaran se vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Where, e = conductor force, b = density of magnetic conductance, l = length of conductor and v = velocity of conductor isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki vyaavhaarik rup main chaalak kii lambaai evam veg donon hi bahut adhik hone chahie or saath hi chumbakeey abhivah ghanatv bhi adhiktam ho
 Maximum magnetic field
 chumbakeey kshetra kii adhiktam seemaa uske santrupt hone ke kaaran nirdhaarit hoti he
 It is also practically not possible to increase the length of the driver, but more than one driver can be adjusted in such a way that the induced VVB in them
 Become practical by joining
 vastut: janitr main ek chaalak ke sthaan par chaalak kaa ek tantra hota he, jo ek duusare se ek nirdhaarit yojana ke anusaar sanyojit hote hai
 The portion holding these conductors is called armature and their combination method is called armature kundalan
 veg adhik hone se, ghoomanevaale chaalkon par apkentre bal bahut adhik ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran armechar par unki vyavastha bhang ho ja sakati he
 Hence, they are placed in the pillars on the armature
 armechar chaalkon ko dhaaran karne ke saath hi unako ghumata bhi he, jiske liye uskaa shaft yantric urja kaa sambharan karanevaale yantra ke shaft se yugmit hota he
 This device can be a water turbine, or a steam turbine or engine
 kisi bhi rup main uplabdh yantric urja ko armechar kaa shaft ghumaane ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus various types of instruments are used to drive the generator
 inhen pradhan chaalak kehete hai
 Various types of engines, such as steam engines, diesel engines, petrol engines, gas turbines, etc
 machines, are used as prime drivers and their mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by the generator
 armechar chumbakeey padaarth kaa bana hota he, jisase chumbakeey kshetra ke abhivah kaa vaahak ho sake
 Generally, it is made of a special type of steel, which is called armature steel
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye bhi vidyut kaa hi prayog vyaavhaarik rup main kiya jaataa he, kyonki isse sthaayee chumbak kii apeksha kahin adhik tivrata kaa chumbakeey kshetra utpann kiya ja saktaa he or kshetradhara kaa vicharan kar sugamawa se kshetra kaa vicharan kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus the voltage generated can be easily controlled
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye kshetra chumbak hote hai, jinpar kshetrakundali vartit hoti he
 The magnetic field is produced by the flow of current in these coils
 ekasam kshetra ke liye kshetra chumbakon kaa aakaar kuch golai liye hota he or unke bich main armechar ghumta he
 The air gap between the armature and the field magnets must be minimal, so that most of the armature of the field current can cut off the conductors and maximize the voltage generated in the armature
 kshetra kundali main dhara pravaah ko uttejan kehete hai
 This stimulation can be done by connecting to an external source, or a part of the current generated in the same generator itself can also be used for stimulation
 bahari strot se uttejit kiye janevaale janitr ko bahya uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he or swayan usee janitr main janit dhara kaa bhaag upyog karanevaale janitr ko swat:uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he
 The systems of automatic stimulation also vary according to the combination of field coil and armature
 yadi kshetra kundali armechar se shrenee main sanyojit hon, to use shrenee janitr kaha jaataa he
 If both have lateral connections, it is called a shunt generator
 yadi kshetra kundali ke kuch vart armechar se shrenee main or kuch usase parshv sambandhit hon, to aise janitr ko sanyukt janitr kehete hai
 These different methods of stimulation provide different symptoms
 bahya uttejit janitr main kshetradhara armechar dhara athwa bhardhaara par nirbhar nahin karti
 Hence the voltage generated in it is independent of load variance
 yadi kshetradhara ko ek samaan rakhaa jaae or janitr main janit voltata bhi ek samaan rahegi
 The shunt generator also has almost the same characteristics and the effect of load variance is not much on the voltage generated
 shrenee janitr main, bhardhaara hi armechar or kshetra kundaliyon main pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, this field depends on the stream load and thus the generated voltage increases with increasing load
 sanyukt janitr main shant evam shrenee janitron ke bich ke lakshan hote hai
 By arranging the shunt and range curves of the field horoscope, any characteristics between them can be obtained
 vyavhaar main sanyukt janitron kaa hi adhik prayog hota he
 The voltage generated in a conductor moving at the same velocity in the magnetic field depends on the speed of cutting the magnetic flow of the conductor
 yah gati, vastut:, kisi kshan bhi chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ke saapeksh sthit par nirbhar karti he
 When the driver is moving at the same speed, he will be perpendicular to the transport twice in one round and in this case he will cut the maximum load, and when he does not cut any transport, will be parallel to it twice
 is prakaar ek chakkar main do baar usamen janit voltata shunya or adhiktam ke bich vicharan karegi, jaisi chitra 3
 main dikhaaya gaya he
 This type of variance is called recursive variance
 armechar chaalkon main bhi isi prakaar kii prayavarti voltata janit hoti he or use disht rup dene ke liye dikparivartak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The transformer is mounted on the shaft of the armature
 usamen bahut se tamrakhand hote hai, jo ek duusare se vidyutruddh hote hai
 The interconnections of the armature are connected to these segments
 dikparivartak se sansparsh karanevaale do burush hote hai, jo armechar main janit voltata dwaara pravaahit honevaali dhara ko bahari paripath se sanyojit karte hai
 The armature drivers are connected to the transformer in such a way that the current collected by the two bursts is in the same direction
 is prakaar ek burush dhanatmak dhara ikatthi karata he or doosraa rinatmak
 On this basis, Burushas are also called positive and negative
 vastut:, burush vidyutdhara ke terminal hai, jo bhaar ko janitr se sambhddha karte hai
 These are attributed to the Burushholder and their position on the diabolical can be administered by the Burush holder
 zaahid qurbaan alvi, pakistan ke praant, sindh ke purv antarim kaaryvahak mukhyamantri the
 In electronics, the multiplexer selects one of several analog or digital input signals and further devices the line of the selected input
 bahusanketak me 2n kaa n line kaa chayan karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he bahusanketako kaa mukhya rup se samay or bandwidth kii ek nishchit raashi ke bheetar network par bheja jaataa he or data kii maatra badhaane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 a multiplexer is called a data selector
 ek electronic bahusanketak sambhav kai sanketon ke bajaay input sanket ke prati ek yukti karata he divaais yaa sansaadhan, udhaaharan ke liye ek e / di canwarter yaa ek sanchaar line ko saajha karne ke liye banaata he
 In contrast, a multiplex separator takes an input signal and is connected to an input that is a tool for selecting one of several data-output lines
 ek bahusanketak aksar praapt ant par ek poorak bahusanket viyojak ke saath prayog kiya jaataa he
 An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiplex separator, as a multi-input, single output switch, and a single input, multiple output switch
 ek bahusanketak ke liye yojanabaddh pratik yukt ab samanaantar paksh ke saath ek samdvibahu samalamb he or input pin or utpaadan pin samanaantar paksh ke hote he
 The schematic on the right multiplex separator is left and a 2 to 1 multiplexer is detected on an equal switch on the right
 esaiel taar utpaadan karne ke liye vaanchit input se jodta he
 Cost savings ek bahusanketak ke buniyadi samaaroh me ek hi data pravaah main kai aadaanon ke sangyojan hota he
 On the receiving side, a basic multiple signal consists of a single data stream segmentation
 The use of a single for multiplexer saves cost by adding a multiplexer and a multiplex separator simultaneously on the same channel
 sahi karne ke liye isaki chhavi ise darshata he
 In this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is greater than the cost and inconvenience of providing multiplexing functions
 data praapt karne ke ant main ek poorak bahusanket viyojak saamaanya rup se waapas neeche mul dhaaraon main ek data pravaah ko todane ke liye aavashyak sandes detaa he
 In some cases, the logic of the far-end system multiplex separator exists, while it may never actually be physically, a simple multiplex separator and so much more functionality
 ek bahusanketak ypi network upyogkartaaon kii sankhya main yukti karata he or phir turant apane maarg procesar main puure link kii saamagree ko padhata he jo ek router main sidhe jaati he or phir ise ypi main sidhe parivartit kiya jaataa he jahaan se smriti main bahusanket viyojak madad karata he aksar ek bahusanketak or bahusanket viyojak aam taur par ek "bahusanketak" ke rup main bas janaa jaataa he jo upkaran kaa ek tukdaa, main ek saath sanyukt karte hai
 Most communication systems transmit in both directions because both pieces of equipment are needed at both ends of a transmission link
 nenalog circuit dizin main, ek bahusanketak ek ekal utpaadan karne ke liye kai aadaanon se chaynit ek sanket jodta he vah anuroop switch kii ek vishesh prakaar he
 Digital multiplexer digital circuit dizin main, chayankarta taron digital mulya ke hai
 I_1 connects to produce a logic value of its, while in the case of a 2 to 1 multiplexer, I_0 connects to a 0 to produce a logic value
 bada bahusanketak main, chayankarta pinon kii sankhya baraabar he
 For example, 9–16 inputs would require no less than 5 selector pins, compared to 4 selector pins and 17–32 inputs would require no less
 in chayankarta pin par vyakt dwiadhari mulya chaynit input pin nirdhaarit karata he
 Chaining multiplexer badi bahusanketak unhen ek saath shrinkhalan dwaara chote bahusanketako kaa upyog karke nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, an 8 to 1 multiplexer can be constructed with two to 1 4- and a 2 to 1 multiplexer
 do 4 se 1 bahusanketak bahari main laayaa jaataa he 2 se 1 par chayankarta pin ke saath 4 se 1 ek 8 karne ke liye baraabar he, jo karne ke liye 3 chayankarta aadaanon kii kul sankhya dene ke samanaantar main daalaa jaataa he

 is tarah ke vistaar ko bathemetric vitaran kehete hai
 Some authors have not divided the bathymetric distribution into two parts, one is depth related, ie aquatic and the other is height related, ie altitudinal extension
 bathemetric vistaar ke adhyayan ke liye jeev sambandhi teen vibhaag kiye gaye hai : 1
 The living animals are living on earth

 Similarly, there is a fossil of Archeopteryx, which has the characteristics of birds and also of Uragas
 yah siddh karata he ki uragon se hi pakshio kaa vikaas hua
 From a geological point of view, time has been divided into six kalpas and each kalpa is divided into other smaller chronicles
 jinhen avadhi kaha gaya he
 The first is named after the name of the livingless kalpa
 yah kalp lagbhag 1,00,00,00,000 varshon tak rahaa
 The second organism occurred in the second eon, named Archeozoic
 is kaal ke jeevashm praapt nahin he
 The reason for this is that the early creatures were extremely tender and small, so they did not leave any mark
 tisare kalp kaa naam praajeev kalp he
 The fossils of this period are not very good, but it is estimated that most of the inhospitable beings had evolved in this time
 is nishchay par pahunchne kaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki iske agevali kaal se aprishthvanshi praaniyon ke achche jeevashm praapt hai
 This is followed by the archaeological period
 isko chha: avadhiyon main baanta gaya he
 The first period is called Cambrian
 uske baad kramash: ordovisian, devonian, carbonipheras tathaa parmian aate hai
 Cambrian has an abundance of unorthodox beings
 trilobites or bracayopods adhik hai
 In the Ardovician, the invertebrates and their fishes were born
 kawachadaar machhliyaan bhi paidaa ho gai thim
 Large coral reefs were born in Silurian

 During this period, fishes are well found
 fefdevaali machhliyaan bhi milti hai
 The Devonian is called the Age of Fishes
 is avadhi main molsk adhik the
 Amphibians were also born
 is prakaar prishthvanshi praaniyon ne is avidh main pratham baar prithvi par janm liya
 These three parts of this period are particularly important for this reason

 Pests had developed well
 brankiopod villin hone lage the
 Big shark fishes and other lung fish were more
 pradhanat: yah ubhaycharon kaa yug tha
 It had large amphibians
 inhen se uragon kaa janm hua
 After the Carboniferous came the Permian era
 is avidh main machhliyaan, ubhaychar ore chhipakliyaan bahut thim
 Spiders, scorpions, millipers, snails and archaic pests were numerous in this era
 mesozoik kalp praajeev kalp ke baad aayaa
 This is called the Urga period
 kuch urag to haathiyon se bhi bade the
 The Uragas of the same era turned into birds
 is kalp ko teen avadhiyon main baanta gaya he
 These are Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous
 tritisik main samudri aprishthvanshi praaniyon kii kami hui or bade urag dianosor kii vruddhi
 Modern crustaceans were born in Jurassic and ammonites abound
 is kaal main pakshi or udanevaale urag bhi paae jate hai
 Ammonites disappeared in the Cretaceous era
 bade bade urag bhi villin hone lage or tiliostian machhliyon kii vruddhi hui
 The last cycle is called the Kenozoic era, it is the period of modern beings
 iskaa vibhaajan do kaalon main kiya gaya he
 One is the third era and the second is the fourth era
 tritiy yug ke kai bhaag hai
 The first part is called Adi Nutan period
 isamen aviksit stanadhariyon kaa vilinikaran prarambh ho gaya tha or garbhanal vaale stanadhariyon kaa janm hua
 Among these, the primary form of the horse is also Eohippus
