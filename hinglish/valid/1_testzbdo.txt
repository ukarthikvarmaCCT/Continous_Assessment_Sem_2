 upies, sahaayak urja-strot jaise- stand-bai janarator aadi se is maamle main bhinn hai ki vidyut jane par ve sambandhit upkaran ko milane vaali vidyut main naganya samay ke liye vyavdhaan karte hai jisase us upkaran ke kaam main baadha yaa rukawat nahin aati
 UPS is often used with computers, data centers, communication devices, etc
 where an accident can occur due to power outages; Fear of destroying important figures; There may be loss of business etc
 upies na sirf computer ko voltage kam-zyada hone kii sthiti main haani se bachaata he, balki vidyut aapurti chale jane kii sthiti main kuch samay baad tak computer ko vidyut pradaan karata he, jisase upayokta apana kiya hua kaam sahej lete hai or computer ko sahi tareeke se shat down kar pate hai
 If the power supply of the computer goes away or becomes unstable, then it is likely to damage the hard drive and RAM and the motherboard can also be in danger
 upies main voltata niyantran bhi avashya hona chaiye, jisase upies is khatre se computer ko bachaa paye
 It should be noted that UPS should not be overloaded with external devices like installing unnecessary printers, scanners and fax machines etc
 kabhi bhi printer ko bydaree back ap system main plag na karen
 Similarly, UPS can be either offline type or line-interactive type
 ofline upies sara lod bydaree par daal detaa he
 The response time to switchover, also known as switching time, is 2 to 10 minutes
 zyaadaatar swimming-mod power supplai kaa hold ap time 16 minute se kam hota he, jo upies ke swimming time se adhik hota he jis kaaran computer shat down kii samasya nahin hogi
 Most of the presently found UPS lines are interactive UPS
 ye ek seemaa tak input asi power ko niyantrit karte hai or bydaree asi power se charge ho jaati he
 Not only this, such upss are of small size and are available with most producers
 online upies upies tulanaatmak rup se mahange hote hai
 In this design, the battery is charged through the inverter
 chunki asi line se sidhaa judaav nahin hota, isse line main koi gadabadi hone kaa asar upies par nahin padataa
 If using computers at home, then comparatively cheap standby power system should be used for this
 upies kai tarah ke hote hai
 According to a classification, they can be static or rotational
 jin upies main koi ghoomane vaali mashin prayog nahin kii jaati balki keval sthavar ardhchaalak yuktiyaan prayog kii jaatin hai use sthitik upies kehete hai
 In contrast, rotary machines that use rotary UPS are called rotary UPS
 the The power capacity of UPS should be high
 adhik upies is tarah dizin kiye jate hai ki vidyut jane ke 10 minute baad tak unase jude upkaran kaam kar sakate hai
 For this, V
A
 Ratings have to be kept in mind
 ampear reating computer / upkaran par likhi hoti he, jise voltage se guna kar sakate hai
 Should take such UPS, whose V
A
 Rating should be 20 to 25 percent higher
 adhiktar pisi ke liye 600 volt-ampear kii dar kaa upies kaaphi rahata he
 Most UPS is taken on the basis of backup time, so that its full capacity is not known
 bydaree byaap puri tarah se is baat par nirbhar karata he ki judane vaala upkaran kitni urja le rahaa he
 The more powerful the device, the more it consumes energy

 "'premchand', who gave the best form of Hindi story, defines the story as follows:" The story is that of Dhrupad, in which the singer shows his perfect talent as soon as the Mahaphil starts, in a moment full of chivalry
 It does not happen as much as listening to the song overnight
 " hindi ke lekhakon main premchand pehle vyakti hai jinhone apane teen lekhon main kahani ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai – ‘kahani ek rachana he jisamen jivan ke kisi ek ang yaa kisi ek manobhaav ko pradarshit karnaa hi lekhak kaa uddeshy rahata he

 Being a holy pilgrimage, people also call it Vaidyanath Dham
 jahaan par yah mandir sthit he us sthaan ko "devgarh" arthath devataaon kaa ghar kehete hai
 This place got the name Deoghar due to the location of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga
 yah jyotirling ek siddhapitha he
 It is said that all the wishes of those who come here are fulfilled
 is kaaran is ling ko "kaamana ling" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 The history of the establishment of this linga is that once Rakshasraj Ravana went to the Himalayas to perform austerities for the happiness of Shiva and started cutting his head and offering it to Shivalinga
 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon
 ravan ne lanka main jaakar us ling ko sthapit karne ke liye use le jane kii ajna maangi
 Shivji gave permission, but with the warning that if he puts it on the road, he will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling
 shivaji kaa darshan hote hi sabhi devi devataaon ne shivlinga kii vahiin usee sthaan par pratisthapana kar di or shiv-stuti karte hue waapas swarg ko chale gayi
 According to public opinion and popular belief, this vaidyanath-jyotirlinga is going to give desired results

 The very sacred and grand temple of Baba Bholenath is situated in Deoghar
 har saal sawan ke maheene main sravan mela lagata he jisamen lakhon shraddhalu "bol-bam!" "bol-bam!" kaa jayakaara lagaate hue baba bholenath ke darshan karne aate he
 All these devotees take the holy Ganga water from Sultanganj and take a very hard walk of about hundred kilometers and offer water to Baba
 mandir ke sameep hi ek vishaal talab bhi sthit he
 The main temple of Baba Baidyanath is the oldest, around which many other temples are also built

 The holy journey of Baidyanath Dham begins in the month of Shravan
 sabase pehle tirth yatri sultanganj main ekatra hote hai jahaan ve apane-apane paatro main pavitra gangaajal bharte hai
 After this, they keep Gangajal in their Kanwar and proceed towards Baidyanath Dham and Basukinath

 Among the 12 Jyotirlingas of India, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga is located in Deoghar district of Jharkhand
 vishwa ke sabhi shiv mandiron ke sheersh par trishul laga dikhta he magar vaidyanathdham parisar ke shiv, parvati, lakshmi-narayan va anya sabhi mandiron ke sheersh par panchashul lage hai
 It is said that Ravana used to protect his kingdom Lanka from Panchshul
 chunki vaidyanath jyotirling ko lanka le jane ke liye kailash se ravan hi lekar aayaa tha par vidhaataa ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd
 yahan prativarsh mahashivaratri se 2 dinon purv baba mandir, maan parvati va lakshmi-narayan ke mandiron se panchashul utaare jate hai
 During this time, devotees throng to touch the Panchshul
 jaisaa ki neeche ke chitron main aapako dikhaai padegaa
 Panchshulas at the top of other temples located in the Vaidyanathdham complex are taken off a few days before Mahashivratri
 sabhi panchshulon ko neeche laakar mahashivaratri se ek din purv vishesh rup se unki puja kii jaati he or tab sabhi panchshulon ko mandiron par yatha sthaan sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 During this time the alliance of Baba and Parvati temples is removed
 mahashivaratri ke din nayaa gathbandhan kiya jaataa he
 Crowds of devotees throng to get the red sacred cloth of the alliance
 mahashivaratri ke dauraan bahut-se shraddhalu sultanganj se kaanvar main gangaajal bharkar 105 kilometre paidal chalakar or ‘bol bam’ kaa jaighosh karte hue vaidyanathdham pahunchate hai

 yah avadharana saamanyatya computer yaa soochna pranali se sambandhit hoti hai
 The SDLC concept in software engineering supports many types of software development processes
 ye kaary pranaliyaan soochna pranali : software deveopment prakriya ke nirmaan kii yojana banane evam use niyantrit karne kaa dhaancha taiyaar karti hai
 SDLC is a common logical process used by system analyzers in the development of information systems, including requirements, validity, training, and user ownership
 koi bhi SDLC ucch gunvattta system kaa parinaam dene vaala hona chahie, jo graahakon kii ummiido se zyada yaa uske baraabar hota hai, jo samay or anumaanit laagat ke bheetar puraa hokar pahunch jaataa he, vartmaan or yojanabaddh soochna prodyogiki avasanrachana main prabhavi or sucharu rup se kaam karata he or iskaa nirvaah karnaa sasta or badhanaa laagat-prabhavi hota hai
 Computer systems have become very complex and often multi-traditional system links are supplied by various software vendors
 jatilta ke is str ke prabandhan ke liye, kai SDLC model banaae ja chuke hai: "waterfol", "founten", "spiral", "bild and fiks", "rapid phototiping", "incremental" or "sinchronies evam stablise"
 SDLC models can be defined as mutually effective and consequential, with efficient spectrum
 kushal karypranaliyaan jaise ki XP or scrum alp bhaar prakriyaaon par dhyaan detii hai jo vikaas chakra ke saath teevr badlaav kii anumati detaa hai
 Interactive work systems such as the Rational Unified Process and Dynamic Systems Development Method focus on limited project dissemination and increasing or improving products through multiple iterations
 anukramik yaa big dijin aparrant model, jaise "waterfol", badi pariyojnaon or jokhim ke maargdarshan ke liye purna or sahi yojana banane par kendrit rahati hai jisase safal or purvanumanit parinaam praapt ho
 Some efficient and iterative proposals confuse the SDLC term with sequential or 'more traditional' processes, however, SDLC is an umbrella term for all functions of design, implementation, and software release
 pariyojna prabandhan main ek project kaa jivan chakra or ek "system deveopment life saaikal" donon rahata he, jiske dauraan kai vishisht gatividhiyaan ghatit hoti hai
 The project life cycle revolves around all the activities of the project, while the system development life cycle focuses on meeting the product requirements
 system deveopment life saaikal kaary pranali kaa aisa prakaar he, jiskaa soochna system ko banane kii prakriya ko paribhaashit karne main prayog hota he, jivan chakra ke har str ko duharaakar soochna system ko ek bahut sankalpit, sanrachana or menthodical tareeke se viksit karne ke liye vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The traditional development systems life cycle began in the 1960s in the era of large-scale business groups to develop large-scale functional business systems
 soochna systams gatividhiyaan heavi data pracesing or nambar cranching routines ke aas-paas chakkar lagaati hai
 Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method was based in SDLC in the 1980s
 SSADM soochna systams ke vishleshan or dijin kaa ek system drushtikon, sarkari vanijyik karyaalay ke liye nirmit, ek UK sarkari karyaalay sarkaar main praudyogiki ke istemaal ke saath sambhddha hui
 Traditional life cycles entered into system development since the 1980s, increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks that attempted to break out of some of the inherent shortcomings of traditional SDLC
 system deveopment life saaikal mahatvapurn charnon kaa anusaran karti hai jo vikasakarta ke liye aavashyak he jaise ki yojana banane, vishleshan, dijin or karyanvayan or neeche ke bhaag main samajhaayaa gaya hai
 Many systems exist in the development life cycle
 sabase purana model, jise mulat: "da systams vikaas jivan chakra" mana jaataa tha waterfol model he, charnon kaa ek anukram jisamen har charan kaa nirgam agle charan ke liye aagat ho jaataa he
 These steps usually follow the same basic steps but many different waterfall operations give different names to the steps and there is a difference between 4 and 7 in the number of steps
 koi bhi system deveopment life saaikal model bilkul sahi nahin hota he lekin qadamon ko gunvatttashil or vibhinn charnon main baanta ja saktaa he
 To generate a high level of future project and to set the goal of the project
 kabhi-kabhi nidhi praapt karne ke prayaas main ucch prabandhan ko pariyojna pesh karne ke liye vyavhaaryata adhyayan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Projects are usually evaluated in three areas of feasibility: economic, work related and technology related
 In addition, it is also used in the context of putting the project on track and evaluating the progress of the MIS team
 MIS un charnon kaa poorak bhi he
 This phase is also called the analysis phase
 system vishleshan kaa uddeshy system ko fiks karne ke prayaas main samasya kahaan he ko tay karnaa he
 This step involves breaking the system into various parts and drawing diagrams for the analysis of the situation
 pariyojna kaa uddeshy kaa vishleshan vibhajit kaary jisko nirmaan karne ke zarurat he or upyogkarta ko shaamil rakhane kaa prayaas jisase ki nishchit aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit kiya ja sake
 Necessary Gathering sometimes requires individual / team of customer as well as service providers to achieve detailed and correct requirements
 system dijin main kaaryon or parichaalanon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya jaataa he jisamen patal abhinyas, vyapaar ke niyam, prakriya aarekh or duusare dastauez-pralekhan shaamil hai
 The issuance of this step will describe the new system as a criterion or a subsystem
 dijin charan main aavashyaktaaon ko apane praarambhik aagat ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These requirements are identified in the accepted required document
 har zarurat ke liye, ek yaa zyada dijin avyavon kaa set saakshaatkaar, kaaryshaalaayein or / yaa adarsh prayaason ke parinaam main pesh kii jaayegi
 dijin avyav vaanchit software visheshtaon kaa vistaar se varnan karti he or saadharantah kaaryaatmak padanukram aarekh, patal abhinyas aarekh, vyavsaay niyamon kii sarini, vyapaar prakriya aarekh, siudocode or ek purna satta-sambadh purna data shabdkosh ke saath shaamil hai
 These design components are determined to describe the software with sufficient detail in which skilled programmers can perform software development with minimal additional investment
 modular or upsistems programing code is charan ke dauraan puri kii jaati he
 Unit tests and modulus tests are performed by developers in this level
 yah charan agle charan ke saath antarmishrit he jisamen mukhya pariyojna ke samakalan ke pehle vyaktigat modul ko pareekshan kii zarurat padegi
 Software testing involves testing code at different levels
 ikai, system or upyogkarta sweekruti pareekshanon ko kai baar kiya jaataa hai
 This is a gray area because many ideas exist in it that if an iteration occurs, what are the test steps and how much
 aamtaur par punrariti waterfol model kaa bhaag nahin he lekin kuch is charan main ghatit hote hai
 The spread of the system includes changes before the end of the system or the end of the system, and the release of service
 system kaa rakh-rakhaav SDLC kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he sanghathan main mukhya karmchaaree parivartan jagahon ke rup main naye parivartan karyanvit kii jaayegi; jisko system aadhuniki kaarnon kii zarurat hogi
 The system development life cycle phase serves as a programmatic guide to project activity and works with the project theme and provides a flexible yet favorable way to run projects by deep matching the project theme
 SDLC charan ke har ek uddeshy ko is vibhaag main mukhya pradeyon, diye gayi kaaryon kii vyakhya or prabhavi prabandhan ke liye sambadhit niyantrit uddeshyon ke saransh ke saath paribhaashit kiya gaya hai
 Creating and operating control objectives during every SDLC phase along with implementing projects is very critical for the project manager
 vaanchit yaa prastaavit parinaam kaa spasht kathan pradaan karne main niyantran uddeshy madad karti he or sampurna SDLC prakriya ke antagart prayog hona chahie
 Control objects can be grouped into core classes and as shown in the figure, it is associated with SDLC phases
 kisi bhi shuruuaati SDLC ke prabandhan or niyantran ke liye har pariyojna ko kuch degree work avrodh strecchar kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aavashyak kaaryon kii suchi or pakadaney kii zarurat hogi
 WBS and all programmatic content must be placed in the "project Descriptions" section of the project notebook
 WBS swaroop ko adhikanshtah pariyojna prabandhak ko saunp diya jaataa he jo ise is dhang se sthapit karata he ki pariyojna kaary kii sabase acchhee vyakhya ho jaati he
 There are some key areas that must be described in the WBS as part of the SDLC policy
 The following diagram describes the main areas that will be employed in WBS in the manner created by the project manager
 kaary avrodh sanrachana ke upree vibhaag ko mukhya charnon or pariyojna ke mile ke pathar ko sankshipt vyavhaar main pahchaanana chahie
 In addition, the Upper Department should provide an overview of the entire subject and the time frame of the project and the initial project description for project approval will be part of the effort
 WBS kaa madhya vibhaag WBS kaary vikaas ke guide ke rup main saat system deveopment life saaikal par aadhaarit hai

 Politics gateway sangheey sharian nyaayalay yaa vafaaqi sharai adaalat, pakistan kii ek nyaayik santhaan he, jiska kaary yah jaanch va nirdhaarit karnaa he kii desh ke kanoon, sharia kaa paalan karte hai yaa nahin
 The body consists of eight Muslim judges, including the Chief Justice
 yah sabhi nyaayadhish, pakistan ke raashtrapati kii manjuuri se niyukt kiye jate hai jinka pakistan kii ucchtam nyaayalay yaa kisi bhi prantiy nyaayalay ke sevanivrutt yaa sevarat nyaayadhish main se chunaa janaa aavashyak he
 The current Chief Justice of the federal Sharia court is Justice Riaz Ahmed Khan
 sangheey sharia nyaayalay ke 8 nyaayadhish main se 3 nyaayadhishon kaa ulema hona aavashyak he, jiskaa kaa adhyayan islamia or vyavastha kaa alam hoga jinhen islamic kanoonon or niyamon main atyadhik moolyankan kaushal praapt ho

 1980 main jab yah adaalat kii sthapana kii gai thi, tab se yah adaalat kai baar aalochana va vivaad kaa vishay banati rahi he, or kai avasaron par vivaadaaspad bhi rahi he
 It was established by the eighth amendment to this court in its claim of Islamization in military government

 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he
