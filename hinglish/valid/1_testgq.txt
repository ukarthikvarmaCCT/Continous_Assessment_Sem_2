 Osteoporosis or osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the risk of fractures
 osteoporosis main asthi khanij ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, asthi sookshm-sanrachana vighatit hoti he or asthi main asangrahit protein kii raashi or vividhta parivartit hoti he
 The World Health Organization has defined osteoporosis in women as the bone mineral density 2
5 standard deviations below the maximum bone mass as measured by DXA; The term "establishment of osteoporosis" also includes the presence of delicate fractures
 osteoporosis, mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad sarvaadhik saamaanya he, jab use rajonivrittottar osteoporosis kehete hai, par yah purushon main bhi viksit ho saktaa he or yah kisi main bhi vishisht hormone sambandhi vikaar tathaa anya dirghakaalik bimariyon ke kaaran yaa aushadhiyon, vishesh rup se glucocorticoid ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he, jab is beemaari ko steroid yaa glucocorticoid-prerit osteoporosis kaha jaataa he
 Given its effect, the risk of fragile fracture remains, bone weakness can significantly affect life expectancy and quality of life
 osteoporosis ko jivan-style main parivartan or kabhi-kabhi dawaaiyon se roka ja saktaa he; haddiyon kii kamazori vaale logon ke upachaar main donon shaamil ho sakati hai
 Changing lifestyles include exercising and preventing falls; Medicines include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, and many others
 girane se rokthaam kii salaah main chahalqadami vaali mansapeshiyon ko taanane ke liye vyaayaam, utak-samvedi-sudhaar abhyaas; santulan chikitsa shaamil kii ja sakati hai
 Exercise, with its anabolic effect, can at the same time stop or reverse osteoporosis
 osteoporosis ke sabhi maamalon main antarnihit pranali asthi avasorana or asthi-nirmaan ke bich asantulan he
 The normal bone contains a constant bone reproducibility matrix; At any given point of time, 10% of all bone mass undergoes reproduction
 jaisaa ki 1963 main frost ne pehali baar bataaya, yah prakriya asthi bahukoshikeey ikaayiyon main ghatit hoti he
 Bone is absorbed by osteoblast cells, after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells

 The amount of estrogen required to suppress this process is generally lower than the amount expected to stimulate the uterus and mammary gland
 asthi her-pher ke viniman main α-rup kaa estrogen receptor bahut mahatvapurn lagata he
 In bone manipulation, calcium metabolism plays an important role in addition to estrogen, and calcium and vitamin d deficiency leads to bone deposition atrophy; Additionally, the parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone, which increases bone absorption to ensure adequate amounts of calcium in the blood
 asthi nickshepan ko badhaane vaali, thyroid dwaara utpaadit hormone calsitonin kii bhoomika kam spasht he or sambhawatah PTH kii tarah utani mahatvapurn nahin
 Activation of osteoblasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL has been the most studied
 yah anu, asthikorak or anya koshikaon dwaara nirmit hota he or RANK ko uttejit karata he
 Osteoprotigerin combines RANKL before it has a chance to bind RANK and therefore suppresses its ability to increase bone absorption
 RANKL, RANK or OPG, tumor parigalan kaarak or uske grahiyon se nikat se jude hue hai
 The role of the Wnt signaling pathway has been accepted, but is poorly understood
 eicosnoid or interlukin ke sthaneey utpaadan ko, asthi her-pher ko niyantrit karne main bhaag lene vaala mana jaataa he or osteoporosis ke vikaas ke mul main in madhyasthon kaa adhik yaa kam utpaadan kaarak ho saktaa he
 The bony bone is the spongy bone located at the end of the long bones and vertebrae
 valkuteey asthi, haddiyon kaa kathor bahari kavach or lambii haddiyon kaa madhya he
 Because osteoblasts and osteoblasts reside on the surface of bones, the ligamentous bone is more active and subject to bone manipulation and regeneration
 na keval asthi ghanatv kam hota he, balki asthi kii sookshm-sanrachana baadhit hoti he
 The ligamentous bone weak bones are dislocated and replaced by weak bones
 aam osteoporotic asthi-bhang jagahen, yatha kalai, kuulhe or ridh kii haddi main valkuteey asthi se bandhakmay asthi kaa anupaat apekshaakrit ucch hota he
 These sites are dependent on the asymptomatic bone for strength, and therefore when the reproduction is unbalanced, rapid regeneration leads to weathering of these sites
 osteoporosis kaa apana koi vishesh lakshan nahin he; iskaa mukhya parinaam, asthi bhang kaa vardhit jokhim he
 Osteoporotic fractures occur in conditions where bone is not broken in healthy people in general; Hence they are considered to be fragile fractures
 vishisht najuk asthi-bhang kasheruki stambh, pasli, kuulhe or kalai main hote hai
 Symptoms of spinal cord depression are sudden back pain, often accompanied by nerve root pain and rarely with spinal compression or caudal cavity syndrome
 Multiple vertebral fractures cause long-term pain due to tingling, loss of height, consequent decrease in mobility
 lambii haddiyon ke asthi-bhang gatishiltaa par teevr kshati pahunchaate hai or shalya-chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Hip fractures in particular typically require immediate surgery, as hip fractures are associated with several serious risks such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary angiography and increased death

 Removal of obstructions and loose carpets in residential environments can significantly reduce falls
 jo pehle bhi gir chuke hon or jinaki chaal yaa santulan avyavasthit ho, unhen sabase zyada girane kaa khatara he
 Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures can be divided between non-variable and variable
 iske atirikt, aise vishisht rog tathaa vikaar maujuud hai, jinamein osteoporosis ek sweekrut samasya he
 Medication use is theoretically variable, although in many cases the use of drugs that increase the risk of osteoporosis is unavoidable
 osteoporosis ke liye sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak he unnat umr or mahila ling; rajonivritti ke baad estrogen kii kami asthi khanij ghanatv kii teji se kami ke saath sah-sambhddha he, jabaki purushon main testosterone ke str main kami kaa tulanaatmak prabhaav padataa he
 Although osteoporosis occurs in people of all ethnic groups, people of European or Asian descent are already prone to osteoporosis
 jin logon kaa paariwarik itihaas asthi-bhang yaa osteoporosis kaa ho, unhen adhik jokhim he; asthi-bhang or nune asthi khanij ghanatv kii vanshagatata 25 se lekar 80 pratishat tak vistaar sahit, apekshaakrit ucch he
 There are at least 30 genes associated with the development of osteoporosis
 jin logon ko pehle hi ek fracture hua ho, unhen hamaumr or samalangik kisi vyakti kii tulana main dubaara fracture hone kii sambhaavna duguni hoti he
 Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki haddi upaapachay ko prabhavit karne vaali antarnihit vyavastha sidhi he, jabaki dusron ke liye, kaaran kai or agyaat hai
 Some drugs have been linked to increased osteoporosis risk; Classically, only steroids and anticonvulsants are associated, but evidence is emerging regarding other drugs as well
 osteoporosis kaa nidaan asthi khanij ghanatv ko maapne par kiya jaataa he
 Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most popular method
 asaamaanya BMD kaa pataa lagane ke alaava, haddiyon kii kamajori ke nidaan ke liye sambhavit parivartaneey antarnihit kaarnon kii jaanch apekshit he; yah rakt-pareekshan or eks-re ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 Depending on the likelihood of the original problem, cancer can be investigated with bone deflections including multi-marrow, Cushing's disease and other factors mentioned above
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi ko osteoporosis ke nidaan ke liye swarna maanak mana jaataa he
 Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2
5 standard deviations of the young adult reference population
 ise T-score kaha jaataa he
 The World Health Organization has established the following guidelines: jab osteoporotic fracture bhi ho, jise ek khadi oonchai se girane kii vajah se ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab shabd "gambhir yaa sthapit" osteoporosis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The International Committee on Diagnostic Densitometry recognizes that osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be diagnosed on the basis of density measurement criteria alone
 They also state that for pre-menopausal women, a Z-score should be used instead of a T-score, and that osteoporosis should not be diagnosed in such women as well, based on densification criteria alone

 Clinical prediction rules are available to conduct the selection of women aged 60–64 for screening
 sarvaadhik samvedansheel ranneeti osteoporosis jokhim moolyankan saadhan ho saktaa he
 In relation to the screening of men, a cost-analysis study suggests that the investigation "costs in cases of auto-reported pre-fractures in men 65 years of age and without pre-fractures in men 80 years and older" May be less "
 In addition, in middle-to-adult men, a significant reduction in testosterone levels, say less than 300, may be less expensive to detect
 ling ke aadhaar par osteoporosis kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kai dawaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Changes in lifestyle are also an aspect of treatment
 upachaar ke liye bisphosphonet mukhya aushadhiy upaay he
 However, in the 1990s, new drugs such as teriparatide and strontium renalate appeared
 pusht osteoporosis maamle main bisphosphonet dawaaen mahilaon ke upachaar-variyata kram main pratham rahi hai
 Commonly included in the prescription are bisphosphonate according to presently sodium alendronate 10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week, risadronate 5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week and or ibandronate once a month
 2007 nirmaataa-samarthit ek adhyayan kaa bataaya ki kam-prabhaav kulha asthi-bhang se peedit rogiyon main, 5 mg zoladronic amla ke vaarshik aadhaan ne kisi bhi fracture ke khatre ko 35% tak, kasheruki fracture ke khatre ko 3
8% se 1
7% tak or gaiyr-kasheruki fracture ke jokhim ko 10
7% se 7
6% tak kam kiya he
 The study also found mortality benefit after 1
9 years: 9
6% of the study group died due to any cause, indicating 28% mortality benefit
 maukhik bisphosphonet apekshaakrit kam avashoshit hote hai or isliye inhen khaali pet lenaa chahie, jahaan agle 30 minute tak koi bhojan yaa peya naa liya jaae

 Although intermittent doses with intravenous prescriptions such as zolendronate prevent oral tolerance problems, these factors are predominantly involved in a rare but unpleasant oral disease called mandibular osteonecrosis
 is kaaran se, maukhik bisphosphonet chikitsa ko sambhawatah tarjeeh di jaani chahie or ab doctor yah anushansa karte hai ki upachaar se purv hi koi bhi upachaaratmak danta kaary kar lenaa chahie
 Recently, teriparatide has been found to be effective against osteoporosis
 yah paratharid hormone kii tarah kaam karata he or asthikorak uttejit karata he or is prakaar unki gatividhi badhati he
 It is used mostly for patients with osteoporosis, especially those with low BMD or multiple fracture risk factors, or who cannot tolerate oral biophosphonates
 yah kalam jaise ek injection upkaran ke istemaal ke saath dainik injection ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some countries, teriparatide can be used for treatment only if biophosphonates fail or are prohibited

 The terminology or definition dictionary is a term for "glassery"
 "glassri" mulat: "glos" shabd se bana he
 "gloss" is a glossa from the Greek language whose initial meaning was "speech"
 baad main yah "bhashaa" yaa "boli" kaa vaachak ho gaya
 Later, it became more semantic and it was used for any kind of word
 aise shabdon kaa sangrah hi "glosri" yaa "paribhaasha kosh" he
 a list of words used in a particular genre of knowledge along with their definitions is called a technical glossary or a technical dictionary
 udhaaharan ke liye ganit ke adhyayan main aane vaale shabdon evam unki paribhaasha ko ganit kii paribhaashik shabdaawalee kehete hai
 The use of terminology makes the expression of complex ideas smooth
 mahaviracharya ne ganitsarasangrahah ke 'sangyadhikaar' naamak pratham adhyay main kaha he- After this, he has given the names and definitions of units of measurement of length, area, volume, time, gold, silver and other metals
 iske baad ganitiya sankriyaaon ke naam or paribhaasha di he tathaa anya ganitiya paribhaashaayen di he
 In bilingual terminology, synonyms of words of one language are given in another language and the definition of that word is also given
 arth kii drushti se kisi bhashaa kii shabdaawalee do prakaar kii hoti he- saamaanya shabdaawalee or paribhaashik shabdaawalee
 Words that are used in a certain sense in a particular field of knowledge are technical terms and words that are not used in a certain sense are common words
 prasiddh vidwaan acharya raghuveer bade hi saral shabdon main paribhaashik or saadhaaran shabdon kaa antar spasht karte hue kehete hai- To clarify the technical terms, many scholars have tried to define definitions in many ways
 dow raghuveer singh ke anusaar - Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari clarifies this in the editorial of 'translation' - shabdaawalee kii parampara "encychlopedia britnica" main tathaa anyatra bhi philatus se maani jaati he
 Their period was 3rd century BC
 is
 inhone "atakta" sheershak shabdaawalee sangruhit kii thi
 But in fact, the history of the vocabulary has gone backward and the oldest vocabulary found so far is that of the Hittite language, whose time is more than 1000 years before Christ
 bharat main pracheenatam shabdaawalee nighantu rup main milti he
 Due to the development in Sanskrit language, when Vedic proved to be difficult for Sanskrit people, collections of Vedic words were called "nighantu"
 aaj jo nighantu uplabdh he vah yaskacharya kaa he, kintu aise vishwaas ke paryaant pramaan hai ki yask ke samay main aise 4-5 or bhi nighantu the
 Yask's time in the 8th century BC It is assumed
 iskaa aashay yah hua ki pashchimi vidvan philtus kii jis shabdaawalee ko pracheenatam maanate hai vah bhartiya nighantuon se kam se kam 4-5 sau varsh baad kii he
 The terminologies that were initially collected in Europe were monolithic, but later the tradition of multilingual glossaries followed
 europe kii pracheenatam gyaat dwibhashik shabdaawalee latingreek kii he, jiske sangrahakarta philoxens maane jate rahe hai yadhyapi yah siddh ho chukaa he ki mulat: yah rachana unki nahin thi
 Its period is roughly 6th century AD
 yah ullekh he ki encychlopedia britnica aadi main ise pracheenatam bahubhashik shabdaawalee mana gaya he, kintu vastut: peeche jis hittit shabdaawalee kaa ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, vah dwibhashik hi nahin tribhaashik he
 Thus, the period of the oldest multilingual terminology is about one and a half thousand years behind the latin-greek
 1000 i
 ke aasapaas greek-latin latin-greek kii kai shabdaawaliyaan baniin
 The tradition of multilingual terminology in India is not very old
 amarkosh ke purv - jaise kaatya kaa "nammala", bhaguri kaa "trikand", amardutt kaa "amarmala" yaa vachaspati kaa "shabdarnav" aadi-evam baad ke - purushottam dev ke "haravali" tathaa "trikandkosh", halaayudh kaa "abhidhaan ratnamala", yadavaprakash kaa "vaijanti" aadi-kosh ekabhashik hi hai
 Prakrit Apabhransh - like Dhanapalarit "paiya Lachinamala", Hemachandra's "deshinamala" and Gopal, Drona etc
's native "kosh" and the old dictionary of Hindi - like Nandadas, Banarasidas, Badridas, Haricharan Das, Chetnavijaya, Vinayasagar etc
 Prayagadas etc
 The "shabdaratnavali" or Haricharanadasa's "karnabharana" etc
 - are in the same tradition, ie monolithic glossaries
 is parampara main kadachit antim granth suvansh shukla kaa "umravakosh" he
 In India, the tradition of glossaries of multiple languages begins with Muslims
 iskaa sabase prasiddh granth "khalikabaari" he, jisamen hindi, frarsi, turki ke shabd hai
 Many such texts were written in the Khalikbari tradition, the most famous of which is said to be the rich Khusra, though there is considerable controversy in this regard
 anek vidwaanon ke anusaar khalikabaari kisi "khusroshaah" kii rachana he, jo prasiddh kavi khusro ke bahut baad main hue the
 Shivaji also created a persian-sanskrit glossary of politics, which contained about 1500 words
 uske baad khalikabaari parampara main hindi-farsi ke kai kosh likhe gaye
 But in a scientific way, this work started after contact with the British
 europe main is disha main kaary ko vaigyanik str par laane kaa shrey je
 skellisar ko he
 The bilingual glossary of Henry Stephanes, published in 1573, is considered to be the first important work in this field
 bharat main angrej padariyon ne dharm evam rajprachaar kii drushti se yahan kii kai bhashaaon ke angreji kosh prakashit kiye
 From the point of view of Hindi, the first dictionary of this series J
 Ferguson's "A Dictionary of Hindustan Language" appeared from London in 1773 AD
 yah ullekhya he ki is parampara main hote hue bhi ye kosh shabdaawalee kii seemaa ke baahar hai
 Now the tradition of multilingual glossaries has developed a lot and glossaries of different subjects have been published here from 3-4 to 10-12 languages
 is disha main england, america, germany, france tathaa rus ne paryaapt shram kiya he
 The United Nations has also given yoga in this direction
 isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin ki shabdaawaliyon kaa hi vikaas koshon ke rup main hua he, kintu donon ek nahin hai
 The difference between the two is that there is a collection of words in one or more languages in the vocabulary, but the meaning or interpretation of the words in the dictionary is also there
 kala, vaanijya, vigyaan aadi ke vigyaan aadi ke vibhinn vishyon ke dwibhashik yaa bahubhashik koshon ke atirikt, paryaay evam vilomkosh bhi shabdaawaliyon kii hi parampara main aate hai
 The "nammala" literature of medieval Hindi literature refers to this
 ab paryaay koshon kii parampara badi vaigyanik ho gai he or lekhakon aadi ke liye ye bade upyogi siddh hue hai
 The work of compiling the first vocabulary after the tradition of medieval nomenclatures was created by Adam in 1829 under the title 'dictionary of the Hindu language' which contained 20,000 words
 tadbhav tathaa deshaj shabdon ko pradhanta di gai
 Adam Sahab was the first person who collected colloquial words from the people

 In 1952, the construction of vocabulary started under the auspices of the Board
 antat: 1960 main kendriya hindi nideshaalay kii sthapana hui
 Thus the terminology prepared on various occasions was published under the title 'definitive Vocabulary', which on the one hand was intended to provide the basis for the coordination work of the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology and on the other hand the writers were unanimous for new concepts in the interim period
 The term was to be provided

 This new type of vocabulary is referred to in English as 'acronym'
 prayek kaal main aise shabd banate rahe hai
 In time, when these words become overused and make their proper place under the dictionary, they often forget that they must have been formed by this method, such as English 'news'
 The words 'badi' and 'sudi' which are prevalent in Hindi are also the result of this process, 'S' Sudi: Sufficient words in English like Anktad, Sam, Meadow, Seeto, Intak, NATO, UNESCO etc
 belong to this category

 Prof
 Ferguson has thought deeply about which language is considered to be developed and developing
 likhit rup main praapt jis bhashaa main nimnlalikhit visheshtaayen hon vah bhashaa viksit maani jaaegi - Hindi meets this criterion
 haan, unhone jo aage kii avasthaaen sweekaar kii hai ki From that point of view, Hindi is a developing language right now and in the future it has eternal possibilities
 hogan ne viksit bhashaa ke jo chaar tatva sweekaar kiye hai unamem se 'aadhuniktaa' par vishesh bal diya he
 'modernity of language' means: increase in vocabulary and development of new styles and expressions

 jo usase asthaapurvak maanga jaataa he, bhashaa vah detii he
 Do not ask for anything from him because if he is not seen hanging from the tree, then Kalpavriksha also gives nothing
 " According to the twentieth century eminent linguist, Bloomfield vastut: bhashaa mulat: abhivyakti kii sanrachana tathaa shabdaawalee kaa sanyukt rup he jo paraspar sangumphit he
 Vocabulary goes on and on, new ones are being created, new meanings are added to the old words, like today, there is expression of all new meanings from adhram, advocate, inscription, candidate, last word
 hindi kii aaksharik sanrachana bhi badi sampann he
 The unprecedented potential of development is evident due to the ample space available in the asterisks

 The assembly language is also specific to a particular computer architecture
 asembli bhashaa ko 'sankethik mashin code' bhi kah sakate hai
 To overcome the difficulties faced by the machine language in preparing programs, computer scientists created another computer program language
 is computer programing bhashaa ko asembli bhashaa kehete he
 The first step in the development of the computer programming language was that the machine language was used as a mnemonic in place of numerical implementation signals
 smaranopkaaree kaa arth yah he ki -asi yukti jo hamaari smriti me vardhdan karen
 Just like xxrep 4 1 is used in the binary system and 15 in the decimal system for subtraction, now if only sub is used for this, then it will make the programmer easier in time
 paribhaashik shabdo me, vah computer programing bhashaa jisame masini bhashaa me prayukt ankiy sanketo ke sthaan par akshar athwa chinho kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, asembli bhashaa athwa symbol language kehalaati he
 In the assembly language, instead of machine codes, 'mnemonic codes' were used which the human brain could easily identify such as LDA, Tran, JMP and other similar mnemonic codes that could be easily identified and remembered
 iname se prayek ke liye ek mashin code bhi nirdhaarit kiya gaya, par asembli code se mashin code me parivartan kaa kaam, computer me hi sthit ek program ke jariye kiya jane laga, is prakaar ke program ko asembler naam diya gaya
 It works like a translator
 nemonic code or aakado hetu upyukt naam ke prayog ke kaaran is programing bhashaa ko apekshaakrit adhik saralata se samajha ja saktaa he
 This programming language takes less time
 isame galatiyo ko saralata se dhundhakar dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This programming language includes many features of the machine language
 chunki is programing bhashaa me prayek nirdesh chinho evam sanketo me diya jaataa he or iskaa anuwaad sidhe masini bhashaa me hota he at: yah bhashaa bhi hardware par nirbhar karti he
 It is necessary to write different programs for different alus and controlling units
