 Mutthi Bhar Mitti is a novel written by British author Evelyn Waugh
 yah pehali baar 1934 main prakashit hui thi 
 It was often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous before World War II
 haalanki, tippaneekaron ne apane gambhir upakramon par dhyaan diya he, or ise ek sankramanakalin kaary ke rup main mana he jo wa ke catholic postwar fiction kii taraf ishaara karata he
 The protagonist Tony Last, a contented but shallow English country landowner who is betrayed by his wife and sees his illusions scattered one by one, joins an expedition into the Brazilian jungle, staring himself at a remote He was trapped in the post like a mad prisoner
 wa ne sajeesh main kai aatmakathaatmak tatwon ko shaamil kiya, jisamen unki patni ne haal hi main apane vivek ko shaamil kiya
 He traveled to the South American hinterland in 1933–34, and many of the events from the trip were included in the novel
 jangal main tony ke ekvachan bhagya kaa istemaal pehali baar wa dwaara ek swatantra laghu kahani ke vishay ke rup main kiya gaya tha, jise 1933 main "da main hu liked dicans" sheershak ke tahat prakashit kiya gaya tha
 The initial critical reception of the book was modest, but it was popular in the public and has never been out of print
 prakaashan ke baad ke varshon main, pustak kii pratishtha badi he; ise aam taur par wa ke sarvottam kaaryon main se ek mana jaataa he or 20 veen shatabdi ke sarvshereshth upanyaason kii anaupchaarik soochiyon par ek se adhik baar lagaaya gaya he
 Waugh converted to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew enmity from some Catholic quarters
 unhone vyapak rup se dharmik vishyon ko muththi bhar mitti main pesh nahin kiya, lekin baad main samajhaayaa ki unhone dharmikata, vishesh rup se catholic, mulyon se alag maanavtaa kii vyarthta kaa pradarshan karne ke liye pustak kaa iraadaa kiya tha
 The book is dramatized for radio, stage and screen
 tony last ek desh kaa sajjan he, jo apni patni brenda or unke aath varshiya bete jon andrew ke saath apane paitruk ghar heton ebe main rahata he
 The house, a Victorian pseudo-gothic adulteration described by a local guide book as "devoid of interest" and "ugly" by his wife, but Tony's pride and joy are highlighted in it
 desh ke jivan ke saath puri tarah se saamagree, vah brenda ke badhate boriyat or asantosh, or unke bete ke vikasshil tareeke se anjaan he
 Brenda meets John Beaver and, despite acknowledging her weakness and insignificance, she begins an affair with him
 brenda landan main apane saptaah bitaane lagati he, or tony ko ek chote se flats kaa vittaposhan karne ke liye raji karti he, jise vah jon kii maa shrimati biver, ek beyimaan sampatti develper se kiraye par leti he
 Although brenda-beaver Contact is well known to her London friends, Tony remains generous and clueless; Brenda and her friends have absurdly failed attempts to set her up with a mistress
 durghatana main jon andrew kii maut kii samay brinda landan main he
 Upon saying that "john is dead", Brenda first thinks that Beaver has died; Upon learning that he is her son John, she is an involuntary "thank God!" Saying it betrays her true feelings
 antim sanskaar ke baad, vah tony ko bataati he ki vah talaak chaahati he taaki vah biver se shaadi kar sake
 Tony is shattered upon learning the extent of his deception, but agrees to protect Brenda's social reputation by allowing her to divorce him, and to provide him with £ 500 a year
 braiton main ek ajeeb lekin shuddh saptahanth kharch karne ke baad, ek veshya talaak ke sakshya kaa virodh karne vaale veshya ke saath, tony brinda ke bhai se sikhti he, jise biver dwaara protsaahit kiya jaataa he, brenda ab salanaa 2,000 pound kii maang kar rahaa he-ek yoga jo tony ko heton bechney kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Tony's illusions are shattered
 haalanki, veshya ne apane bachche ko uske saath laayaa jo sthapit kar saktaa he ki tony ne vyabhichaar nahin kiya or blackmel vifal ho gaya
 Tony withdraws from the divorce negotiations, and announces that he intends to travel for six months
 unki vaapasi par, unka kahana he ki brenda ko talaak ho saktaa he, lekin bina kisi vittiya samjhaute ke
 With no prospect of Tony's money, the beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left in disgrace and poverty
 is bich, tony ne ek explorer dow
 Met Messinger, and joined the expedition in search of a lost city in the Amazon rainforest
 bahari yatra par, tony thiorese di vitre ke saath ek jahaaj ke romance main sanlagn he, ek yuva ladki jiskaa roman catholic dharm use use chhodane kaa kaaran banataa he jab vah use bataata he ki uski patni he
 In Brazil, Messinger proves to be an incompetent organizer; He cannot control the native guides, who abandoned him and Tony in the depths of the forest
 tony biimaar padati he, or messinger madad khojane ke liye apane ekmaatr kute main chhod detaa he, lekin jharne par gir jaataa he or maaraa jaataa he
 Tony wanders into delirium until he is rescued by Mr
 Todd, who rules a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the woods
 tod nurse tony waapas swasthya ke liye
 Although uneducated, Todd has copies of Charles Dickens' complete works, and asks Tony to read them
 haalanki, jab tony kaa swasthya thik ho jaataa he or vah apane raste par madad karne ke liye kahata he, to boodha aadmi baar-baar girtaa he
 The reading continues, but the atmosphere is becoming increasingly dangerous as Tony realizes that it is happening against his will
 jab ek khoj dal antat niptaare tak pahunch jaataa he, to tod ne vyavastha kii he ki tony ko daraaya jaae or chupaaya jaae; vah party ko bataata he ki tony kii mrityu ho gai he, or unhen ghar lene ke liye unki ghadi detaa he
 When Tony wakes up he learns that his hope of rescue is over, and he is condemned to read Dickens indefinitely in his captivity
 england main waapas, tony kii mrityu sweekaar kii jaati he; heton apane chachere bhai ke paas jaataa he, jo apni yaaddaasht ke liye ek smarak khadaa karata he, jabaki brenda tony ke dost joke grant-menaziz se shaadi karti he
 Evelyn Waugh, born in 1903, was the younger son of Arthur Waugh, managing director of the London publishing firm of Chapman & Hall
 oxford ke launsing college or hertford college main bhaag lene ke baad, wa ne ek lekhak ke rup main apana kariyar shuru karne se pehle teen saal ke liye nijee praarambhik vidyalayon kii ek shrinkhalaa main padhaayaa
 His first commercially printed work was a short story, "the Balance", which was incorporated into the 1926 anthology by Chapman and Hall
 unhone daily express reporter ke rup main sankshipt rup se kaam kiya, unhone daily express reporter ke rup main sankshipt rup se kaam kiya, or 1928 main apane comic upanyaas, dekaline or patan ke prakaashan ke saath safalataa praapt karne se pehle pre-rapheliet chitrakaar dante gabrial rocketi kii ek choti jeevani likhi
 By the end of 1932, Waugh had written two more novels, Vile Bodies and Black Mischief and two travel books
 unki vyavsaayik safalataa nijee uthal-puthal ke saath hui; june 1928 main unhone evalin gardenar se vivaah kiya, lekin ek saal baad shaadi khatm ho gai jab usne jode ke aapasi dost jon heget ke liye apana pyaar ghoshit kar diya
 Reconciliation proved impossible, and Waugh filed for divorce in September 1929
 saath hi, wa nirdesh se guzar rahaa tha jisane sitambar 1930 main roman catholic girjaghar main apana swaagat kiya
 Waugh's adherence to Catholic education on divorce caused disappointment while awaiting the possible annulment of their marriage
 unhone terresa jangamain, ek jeevant soshlite jiskaa roman catholic isai carch wa kii aankhon main ke baad se unke rishte main kisi bhi antarangta roka shaadi bane rahe ke saath pyaar main gir gaya tha
 Waugh's adaptations did not greatly affect the bitterness of his own and the increasingly sarcastic tone of the narrative — his leading characters were often unsympathetic and his movements sometimes shocking
 wa ne daawa kiya he "is tarah ke ek fishan main aadmi kii bhrashtataa ke likhane ke liye ke rup main yah badsoorat karne kaa adhikaar"
 When Black Mischief was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic magazine The Tablet, Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was "an insult to anyone claiming a Catholic name"
 wa, oldmado likhaa tha, "na keval catholic ke liye, lekin namrata ke saath saadhaaran maanakon ke apmanjanak ek kaam vyakhya karne par amada tha"
 Waugh made no public denial of these allegations; An open letter was prepared to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, but was not sent on the advice of Waugh's friends
 1932 main vaagh ne dakshin america main ek vistaarit yatra shuru kii
 His decision to absent himself might have been a reaction to his increasingly complex emotional life; While his passion for Teresa Jungman remained insufficient, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual relationships, and was being pursued by the much older Hazel Lavery himself
 dakshin america kii pasand shaayad da spectrator ke saahitiyik sampadak peter fleming se prabhavit thi
 Fleming had recently returned from a Brazilian expedition seeking the trail of Colonel Percy Fawcett, who went missing in Brazil in 1925 while searching for an endangered lost city
 blike mischiff ko mishrit lekin aam taur par anukool mahatvapurn tippanee ke liye launch kiya gaya, wa 2 disambar 1932 ko tilabari se chale gaye
 He arrived in British Guiana on 23 December, and after a few days of uncertainty opted to accompany the District Commissioner for Rupuni on a journey into the interior
 unhone aashaa vyakt kii ki vah brazil ke jangal ke bheetar gahare bade shahar manos tak pahunch sakate hai, lekin parivahan avishwasaneey sabit hua, or unhen bova vista ke simavarti shahar se aage nahin mila
 By the way, at one of his overnight stopping points, he encountered Mr
 Christie, an elderly mixed-race resident, who greeted him by saying, "I was expecting you
" mujhe aapke drushtikon kii drushti main chetavanee di gai thi"
 The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christy spoke of the "fifth Empire"
 unhone vau se kaha ki unhone swarg main santon kii puri sabha ko dekha he-ascharyajanak rup se kuch, unhone kaha- lekin unhen ginana nahin tha kyonki ve avibhajya the
 Waugh added Christie to his "treasures of eccentricity", set aside for future literary use
 wa 4 farvari 1933 ko boa vista pahunche, taaki unhen manos main jane ke liye koi naav uplabdh na ho
 Days of inaction and boredom followed, "nothing to read except a few lives of saints in the sermons of French and Bosquet"
 wa ne kuch samay ek choti si kahani likhakar paarit kiya; haalanki diary main pahachaanaa nahin gaya he, is kahani ko aam taur par "da main hu liked dicans" ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The story is very similar to the episode except for using different names and some minor details that Waugh later uses in the climax of a Handful of Dust: an elderly settler, rescues and captives the Lost Explorer and her Forever, Dickens' novels need to be read aloud
 yah kahani 1933 main america main harsts international-cosmopolitan main or naish ke pal mal patrika main britain main prakashit hui thi
 In an article written several years later , Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: "the idea came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler 


 and showing how easily He could hold me prisoner
 phir, choti kahani likhi or prakashit hone ke baad, vichaar mere dimag main kaam kar rahaa tha
 i wanted to find out how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into another kind of cruel study of helpless plight between home and civilized man
 " Returning to England in May 1933, Wash, short of cash, had to fulfill several writing commitments before starting work on the projected novel
 oktober-november main unhone dakshin america yatra kaa apana khaataa likhaa, jise unhone nabbe-do din kaha
 He went to Fez in Morocco to start a novel in heat and loneliness
 janvari main unhone mairi ligon ko likhaa, reporting kii ki unhone "mere gandi upanyaas" ke 18,500 shabd likhe hai, or baad main unhone catherine asquith se kaha: "maine lon meeting main ek chote se ladke ko maar daalaa he or apni maa ko vyabhichaar kiya he

 Similarly reviewing the book's initial publication in 1934, Gerald Gould in The Observer, "here was the old grand, careless note of contempt and confusion
 dhire-dhire, dhyaan main parivartan or gaharaai hui"
 Later critic, John Cunningham, stylistically, recognizes the book as both more ambitious and more ambiguous, in a category different from Waugh's other 1930 novels
 yadhyapi, kaningham kehete hai, " tii wash ke anya santon ke rup main zyada jaanboojhkar hansi ko uttejit karata he", yah catholic "uddhaar kii kamedis" kii ore apane purvavartiyon se ek mahatvapurn kadam he jo unke lekhan kaa mukhya centre ban jayega jindagi
 In an introduction to the 1997 Penguin edition, Robert Murray Davis suggested that the book, in part, reflected Waugh's reconsideration of his status as a Catholic writer, most recently in light of the Oldmeadow furore on the Black Mischief

 Waugh's own comment, in 1946, was that he was not a "sarcastic" writer, according to his understanding of the term, and in writing the book he was merely "trying to overcome comedy and sometimes out of displeasure" Outside behavior of distant tragedy people "
 pustak ke pehle prakaashan ke baad da spectrator main likhane vaale wiliam plomar ne sochaa ki "shri vaagh kii ascharyajanak yaa dur-daraaj ke rup main or adhik ascharyajanak paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ve puri tarah yathartwaadee hai"

 cics ke vichaar main, vaagh kii doordaraj kii duniya, jaise ki ladi metroland ke paatro kii pustak main bede kii upasthiti ajeeb or ghuspaith kar rahi he- e handphul of dust kii duniya anjaan nahin he: "evalin ladi metroland ko bhul gaye the or uski duniya puri tarah se "
 After Cunningham Waugh, a handful sees dust as a precursor to Catholic novels

 Instead, Christianity develops by presenting the horrors of life without it; According to writer and critic Frank Kermode, "the melancholy of the event and the coolness of the tone work by suggesting a positive and rational declaration of faith"
 pathak, stanerd kehete hai, "kabhi bhi manushya kii praarambhik pashaviktaa ko bhuulane kii ijaajat nahin he 


 ishwar vah kunjee he jise is puri tarah se dharmanirpeksh duniya main phenk diya gaya he"

 However, Waugh commented to the novel that it was "humanitarian" and said that i wanted to say "about humanity"

 Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony confronts what Davis called "power without grace 


 secular feudalism deprived of Christianity's saving grace"
 tod maanavvaadi, adharmik shakti kaa pratik he
 Critic Bernard Bergonji refers to Tony Last as "a destructive Gothic hero", echoing Waugh's explanation for his friend Henry York that the subject of the book was "a gothic man in the hands of the uncivilized - first Mrs
 Beaver, etc
" , Then real people "
 stanerd ke mutabik, vaagh ne apni kala se sabhyataa kaa nyaay karne kaa prayaas kiya, or vishesh rup se isaki vaastukala ke dwaara, or angreji gothic upanyaas kaa ek pramukh litmotif he
 Tony's recognition of the extent of Branda's betrayal has been described as "the whole gothic world 


 comes grief"
 baad main, tony ko anyathaa vyarth yatra main uddeshy miltaa he jab vah messinger se laapata khoe shahar kii sunata he; vah ise charitra main gothic ke rup main dekhtaa he, "ek roopantarit heton 


 sabakuch chamakdaar or paardarshee; ek coral garh he jo dezi ke saath ek hare pahari kii chotii par chadhataa he"
 
 When at the end of his quest he first sees the settlement of Todd, he sees, in his confusion, the reality of the mud huts and destruction, rather than the "guild cupolas and spiers of alabaster"
 yadhyapi mul angreji gothic ko samarpit, vaagh ne gothic rivival architekchar par mishrit vichaaron ko pasand kiya tha, jise unhone 19veen shatabdi kii style ke baad "study" ke liye "pre-ruskin" kaha tha, jisamen unhone heton ko rakhaa tha
 He instructed the artist responsible for the frontispiece to illustrate the "worst possible 1860" style home in the first edition of the book

 Thus, Tony's devotion is shown as a false ideal; His statement and replacement by middle-class heirs in his domain represents what author Brigid Brophy calls "the bourgeois useless of fake-gothic Rome"

 In Bible Genesis 4:21 Jubal is described as "the father of all those who play Ugab and Kinnaur"
 purvavarti hebrew shabd kuch vaayu vaadya yantron yaa saamanytah vaayu yantron ko sanderbhit karata he, uttarvarti ek tardaar vaadya yantra yaa saamanytah tardaar vaadyayantra ko sanderbhit karata he
 Therefore, in the Judeo Christian tradition, jubal is considered the inventor of the flute

 The flute has always been an essential part of Indian culture and mythology, and the origin of the cross flute is considered in India by some chronicles as early as 1500 BC
 The Indian flute has a detailed description of the cross flute
 jab yantra ke chhidr ke aar-paar vaayu dhara pravaahit kii jaati he, jisase chhidr par vaayu kampan hone ke kaaran bansuri dhwani utpann karata he
 The air across the hole creates a barnoli or siphon that has an effect on the von Karman Vortax Street
 yah bansuri main saamanytah maujuud belanaakaar anunaadi guhika main vaayu ko uttejit karti he
 The player changes the tone of the sound by opening and closing the holes of the instrument, thus it changes the effective length of resonance and its corresponding resonant frequency
 vaayu daab main parivartan ke dwaara evam kisi bhi chhidr ko khole or band kiye bagaiyr aadharbhoot aavriti ke alaava bhi bansuri ko guneet swar par anuwaad ke dwaara vadak swar main bhi parivartan kar saktaa he
 For more sound, the flute will have to use a relatively large resonator, large air stream or large air stream velocity
 Generally the sound of a flute can be increased by increasing its resonant and sound holes
 isliye police kii siti, jo bansuri kaa ek rup he, apane swar main bahut vistrut hoti he evam isiliye pipe argon ek concert bansuri kii tulana main adhik tej aawaaj kaa ho saktaa he: ek bade organ pipe main kuch cubic feet vaayu ho sakati he evam iske dhwani chhidr kuch chaude ho sakate hai, jabaki concert bansuri kii vaayu dhara kii maap ek inch se thodi hi badi hoti he
 The air stream should flow at a proper angle and velocity, otherwise the air in the flute will not vibrate
 In flipped fillets or nozzles, a narrowly formed and installed airway will shrink and the air across the open window will flow to the ramp edge
 In pipe organ, this air flows through a controlled blower
 gaiyr fipil bansuri main vaayu dhara nishchit rup main vadak ke hothon se pravaahit hoti he jise imboshar kaha jaataa he
 This allows the player to have a wider range of voice, sound and voice expression, especially compared to the fipil / tube flutes
 haalanki, isse nausikhie vadak ko recorder jaise nalika bansuriyon kii tulana main antim sire se bajane vaale yaa anuprastha bansuriyon dwaara puri dhwani utpann karne main paryaapt kathinaayee hoti he
 To play transverse and end-flute flutes, more air is required which requires deep breathing and complicates cyclic respiration
 saamanytah gunvattta yaa "dhwani rang", jise swar kehete hai, main parivartan hota he kyonki bansuri kai bhaagon evam gahnataaon main sur utpann kar sakate hai
 Sound-color can be altered or improved by a change in the internal shape of the hole such as a conical tip
 sur ek aavruti he jo ek nimna register purnank gunak he yaa bansuri kaa "aadharbhoot" note he
 In general, the air stream is thin, sharp and less deep flowing across the cavity at the origin of high noise
 dhwani vigyaan nishpaadan evam swar ke prati sheersh jod jyamiti vishesh rup se jatil prathit hoti he, lekin utpaadakon ke madhya kisi vishesh aakaar ko lekar koi sarvasammati nahin he
 The acoustic barrier of the imbosher orifice appears to be the most complex criterion
 dhwani vigyaan baadha ko prabhavit karne vaale jatil karkon main shaamil hai: chimney kii lambaai, chimney kaa vyas evam radi yaa chimney ke ant sire kaa ghumaav tathaa vaadya yantra ke "gale " main koi dizin pratibandh jaisaa ki japani nohakan bansuri main
 In a study, in which professional players were blindfolded, it was found that they could not find any difference in instruments made of different metals
 On hearing blindly, no one could identify the instrument correctly at first and in the second time only the silver instrument could be identified
 The study concludes that "no evidence of wall material having any noticeable effect on the sound tone or kinetic extension produced by the instrument was found"
 Unfortunately, this study does not control for headline design, which is commonly believed to affect tone
 The controlled tone test shows that the mass of the tube produces a change and therefore the tube density and wall thickness will produce changes
 We should also keep in mind the limitations of human ears as compared to electronic sensors for sound recognition
 apane aadharatam rup main bansuri ek khuli nalika ho sakati he jise bottle kii tarah bajaayaa jaataa he
 There are some wide categories of flutes
 zyaadaatar bansuriyon ko sangeetkaar yaa vadak oth ke kinaaron se bajaata he
 However, some flutes, such as Whistle, Jamshorne, Flagiolate, Recorder, Tin Whistle, Tonnet, Fujara, and Okarina, have a tube that sends air to shore
 These are called fipil flut
 fipil, yantra ko ek vishisht dhwani detaa he jo gaiyr-fipil fluton se alag hoti he evam yah yantra vaadan ko aasaan banaata he, lekin is par sangeetkaar yaa vadak kaa niyantran kuch kam hota he
 There is another division between side-played flutes such as Western music Kaval, Danso, Shakuhachi, Anasazi Flute and Quena
 bagal se bajaai jane vaale bansuriyon main nalika ke antim sire se bajaaye jane kii ke sthaan par dhwani utpann karne ke liye nalika ke bagal main chhed hota he
 End flutes should not be interpreted as fipple flutes such as recorders, which are played vertically but have an internal tube that sends air to the end of the sound hole
 bansuri ek yaa donon siron par khule ho sakate hai
 Okarina, Jun, Pan Pipes, Police Whistle and Bosun Whistle are closed at one end
 sire par khuli bansuri jaise ki concert-bansuri evam recorder zyada sureele hote hai atev vadak ke liye bajaane main adhik lochasheel tathaa adhik chatkh dhwani vaale hote hai
 An organ pipe can open or close depending on the desired sound
 bansuriyon ko kuch vibhinn vaayu stroton se bajaayaa ja saktaa he
 Traditional flutes are played by mouth, although some cultures use a flute that is played through the nose
 organ ke flu pipon ko, joki nalika bansuri se dhvanik rup main samaan hote hai, dhaukani yaa pankhons ke dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 The Western concert flute is a descendant of the 19th century German flute
 yah ek adhi yaa anuprastha bansuri he joki sheersh par band hoti he
 There is a gaping hole near its top from which the player plays
 bansuri main golakaar dhwani chhidr hote hai joki iske barok purvajon ke anguli chhidr se bade hote hai
 The size and position of the sound hole, the major function, and the use of the finger to generate notes in the expansion of the flute were developed by Theobald Bohm between 1832 and 1847 and his heirs made great improvements in the dynamic expansion and tone of the instrument
 
 kuch parishkaron ke saath western concert bansuri multah boham kii dizin tak hi simit rahe evam boham pranali ke naam se jane jate he
 The standard concert flute is vocalized in the octave c and its expansion starts from the middle c to the third octave
 iskaa taatpary he ki concert bansuri sarvaadhik prachlit arcestra yantron main se ek he, iskaa apwaad picholo he jo ek saptak upar bajataa he
 g alto and c bamboo flutes are rarely used, and they are pronounced one octave below the full fourth octave and concert flute respectively

 Contrabas, double contrabas, and hyperbas are some other rare flute forms that are voiced below the middle octave by two, three and four octaves respectively
 samay-samay par bansuri or picholo ke anya aakaaron kaa prayog hota he
 a rare instrument of the modern vocal system is the treble g flute
 yantra puraane swar maanakon ke anusaar banaaya gaya he, jiskaa prayog saidhantik rup se wind-band sangeet sahit di bi picholo, eb soparano bansuri, epa alto bansuri evam bi bi baas bansuri main hota he
 The bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music, developed independently of the Western flute
 hindu bhagwaan krishna ko paramparaagat rup se bansuri vadak mana jaataa he 
 pashchimi sanskarnon kii tulana main bhartiya bansuri bahut saadhaaran hai; ve bans dwaara nirmit hote hai evam chaabi rahit hoti hai

 Although the tone of a composition is not fixed in itself, any flute can be used for concerts and it depends mainly on the individual choice of the artist
 bhartiya bansuri ke do mukhya prakaaron kaa vartmaan main prayog ho rahaa he
 The first one is the flute, which has six holes for the fingers and one cracked hole and is used mainly in Hindustani music in North India

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The history of Hinduism is very ancient

 Vedas are the most sacred texts of Hinduism

 It is assumed from yani yah dhire-dhire rache gaye or antat: pehle veda ko teen bhaagon main sankalit kiya gaya- rugveda, yajurveda or samaveda jise vedatrayee kaha jaataa tha
 It is believed that the split of the Vedas took place during the time of Pururava Rishi before Rama's birth
 baad main atharvaveda kaa sankalan rishi atharva dwaara kiya gaya

 In fact, Hindus kept their history alive by singing, rote and based on sources
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki vah itihaas dhire-dhire kavyamay or shringaarik hota gaya jise aadhunik log itihaas maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 It was a time when there was no paper and pen

 Before reading the history texts of Hinduism, there is a reference to the tradition of Manus before the tradition of sages and sages, who have been called Kulkars in Jainism
 aise kramash: 14 manu maane gaye hai jinhone samaaj ko sabhy or takneekee sampann banane ke liye athak prayaas kiye
 The name of the first man of the earth was Swayambhu Manu and the first woman was Satarupa, in the Mahabharata, eight manu are mentioned
 is vakt dharti par aathven manu vaiwaswath kii hi santaanen hai
 Eighth Manu was the Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu at the time of Vaivaswat
 puraanon main hindu itihaas kaa aarambh sristi utpatti se hi mana jaataa he
 To say that this started from here may not be appropriate, yet there is a mention in Hindu history texts Mahabharata and Puranas from Manu to the generation of Lord Krishna
 hindu dharm lagbhag 5000 saal se vyavasthit viksit hua he or saat charnon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki doorabeen ek-duusare main he
 Some Hindutva advocates would believe that Hinduism was revealed to the sages in its entirety by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago
 hindutv ke itihaas main, puranic kathaayen sirf samay-samay par itihaas he, itihaaskaar gananaa nahin kar sakate yaa nahin
 In recent times, Hinduism has been described as an "open source religion", unique in that it has no defined founder or doctrine, and its ideas constantly evolve in response to historical and geographical realities
 yah kai sahaayak nadiyon or shakhaon ke saath ek nadi ke rup main sabase acha varnit he, hindutv shakhaon main se ek he, or vartmaan main bahut shaktishaalee he, kai log swayan ko nadi ke rup main maanate hai
 About 5000 years ago, in the Bronze Age, now called the Harappan Indus Valley Civilization, which is characteristic of brick cities, reached the vast area of the Indus river valley over the Ganges for nearly a thousand years
 samtal in shaharon main, ham un chitron ke saath mitti kii javaanon ko khojate hai jo vartmaan hindu prakruti kii bahut adhik hissaa hai jaise pipel vriksh, bail, swastika, saat daasi, or ek aadmi jo yoga mudra main baitha he
 We do not know much about this stage because language remains to be understood
 3,500 saal pehle, louh yug main, vaidic bhajanon or anushthanon se pataa chalaa ja saktaa he jisamen hadappa ke vichaaron ke nishaan hote hai, lekin ek sthai shahari jivan style kii bajaay ek khanaabadosh or gramin jivan style ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Some Hindutva advocates completely disagree and insist that the two stages are actually one
 is charan main, hamen ek vishvadrushti milti he jo bhautik duniya kaa jashn manaati he, jahaan ishwaron ko anushthanon ke saath pesh kiya jaataa he, or swasthya or dhan, samruddhi or shanti pradaan karne ko kaha jaataa he
 This aspect of inviting the gods and receiving favor from them continues to this day, although these rituals vary
 vedon ne sindhu se apper ganga or nichle ganga maidaanon main ek kramik failaav prakat kiya he
 Some Hindutva scholars refute such geographical spread and insist on the subcontinent to have advanced, such as fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, plastic surgery and even airplanes since ancient times
 tisare charan main 2,500 saal pehle upanishad ke rup main janaa jaataa granthon ke saath, jahaan anushthanon kii tulana main aatmanirikshan or dhyaan par adhik mahatv diya gaya tha, or ham punarjanm, mathvaad, janm or mrityu ke chakra se mukti jaise vichaaron par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 This phase saw the rise of shamanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, its followers spoke in Pali and Prakrit and also rejected the Vedic form and the Vedic language, Sanskrit
 isamen brahman pujaariyon ne bhi dharm-shastron kii rachana ke madhyam se vaidic vichaaron ko punargathit kiya, kitaaben jo ki shaadi ke madhyam se saamaajik jivan ko viniyamit karne or paarit hone ke anushthan par dhyaan kendrit karti hai, or logon ke dayitvon ko unke purvajon, unki jati or vishwa par nirbhar karata he

 kai shikshavid vaidic vichaaron ke is sanghathan kaa varnan karne ke liye brahmanwad kaa prayog karte hai or ise ek mul rup se pitrusattatmak or magasivadi bal ke rup main dekhte hai jo samtawadi or shantivaadee mathon ke adeshon ke saath hinsak rup se pratispardhaa karte hai
 Buddhism and Jainism, along with Vedic practices and beliefs, spread from North India to South India, and eventually from the subcontinent to Central Asia and to Southeast Asia
 dakshin main, tamil sangam samskruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, us jaankaree ke bare main jo praarambhik kavitaaon ke sangrah se aate hai, jo vaidic anushthanon ke kuch gyaan or buddha dharm or jain dharm ke gyaan ke saath baad main mahakavyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Some Hindutva scholars say that there was no separate Tamil Sangam culture
 yah puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti kaa hissaa tha, jahaan sabhi ne sanskrit ko bolaa tha
 The fourth phase saw the rise of writings such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Purana, which began 2,000 years ago, where stories are used to reconcile the worldview of domestic and world relations and create the now familiar Hindu worldview
 hamen ek puri tarah se viksit puranic kathaon ke liye pesh kiya jaataa he jahaan vishwa kii koi shuruyaat nahin he yaa ant, kai akaash or kai hello ke saath, kriya or pratikriya dwaara niyantrit, jahaan sabhi samaaj janm or mrityu ke chakron ke madhyam se jate hai, bas sabhi jivit praaniyon kii tarah is charan main mandiron or mandir anushthanon kaa udai hua
 We also see the rise of the monastic Vedantic orders that corrupt the body and everything sensory, as well as the Jap tantric orders, corrupting the body and exploring the body and all things
 ham puraane nigama parampara ke mingling bhi dekh sakate hai, jahaan divyata ko nae agma parampara ke saath niraakaar mana jaataa he, jahaan paramatma shiv or uske putron, vishnu or unke avatar, or devi or uske kai roopon kaa rup lete hai
 With the emergence of new orders and traditions, we also see consolidation of the caste system, which is not a community group based on occupations, which distinguishes itself from not being interim
 kai shikshavidon ne jati ko hindu dharm kii ek aavashyak visheshta ke rup main dekha he jo ucch jatiyon ke paksh main he, jis par aarope he ki hindutv asweekaar karte hai
 Many Hindutva scholars maintain that caste has a scientific and rational basis, and has nothing to do with politics or economics
 paanchvaan charan 1,000 varsh purana he, or yah ek siddhant ke rup main bhakthi kaa udai dekha, jahaan bhakt bhavuk geeton ke madhyam se devataaon se jude hue hai, jo kshetreey bhashaaon main bana he, aksar mandir pranali ko darkinar karte hai
 This was a time when a rigid caste hierarchy firmly asserted itself, based on the principle of holiness and some castes being viewed as inauspicious and inept
 unhen bhi samudaay se acchhee tarah se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he yah bhi vah samay he jab islam bharat main pravesh karata he, shantipurvak samudr ke vyapaariyon ke madhyam se dakshin main or madhya asian saradaaron ke madhyam se hinsak rup se uttar main jaataa he, jo buddha mathon or hindu mandiron ko nasht karte hai, jo raajnneetik satta ke centre bhi hote hai or antat unke shashan kii sthapana karte hai, aksar hindu raajaaon jaise uttar main rajput, purab main ahoms, maraathon or dakkan main vijaynagar samrajya kaa virodh karte the
 Hindutva saw the arrival of Islam and the rise of the Delhi and Deccan Sultanates, the latter marking the end of Mughal rule as the end of great Hindu culture, a subject that Marxist historians have made crazy communal propaganda
 baad main keval hindu-islamic sahyog ko ujagar kiya gaya, jo anya charam par ja rahaa he, gaiyr-marxvaadi itihaaskaaron kaa tark he The sixth phase is 300 years old when Hinduism answers the rise of European power in the subcontinent, and the resulting arrival of Christian missionaries and rational scientific discourse
 kuch hindutv vidwaan, donon ke bich antar nahin karte hai
 European scholars in this era tried to make sense of Hinduism using both scientific methods and a judeo-christian lens
 unke liye, akeshwarwad sachcha dharm or vaigyanik tha; bahudevvaad murtipujak puranic kathaon tha unhone hindu jivan style ke anuwaad or dastavejikaran kaa ek vishaal abhyaas shuru kiya
 He sought a holy book, a prophet, and more importantly, a purpose
 aakhirkaar, jatilta ko vyavasthit karne ke liye, unhone hindu dharm ko brahmanwad ke rup main paribhaashit karnaa shuru kiya, yah buddha dharm, jain dharm or sikh dharm se bhinn tha
 This orientalist framework continues to inform the global understanding of Eastern religions through schools, colleges and media
 ek taral maukhik samskruti ko 1 9veen shatabdi tak tay kiya gaya tha
 Hindus studying in Western ways felt a deep impact of shame and shame when asked about their customs and beliefs
 kuch ne aupniveshik dekhne ke liye hindutv ko sudhaarney kaa faisla kiya
 Others rejected the "true essence" of Hinduism and rejected "later corrupt" practices
 phir bhi dusron ne hindu dharm ko hi khaarij kar diya or sabhi dharmon ko ek andhere khatarnaak bal ke rup main dekha, jo tarksangatta or vaigyanik rup se badal diya gaya
 It is at this stage that Hindutva emerged as a counter-power that he saw in Europe as an indestructible and unfair mockery of all things Hindu and later challenged in American and Indian universities
 hindutv ne marxvad or anya sabhi pashchimi pravachanon ko isai pravachan ke ek or rup ke rup main dekha, jo pichley shatabdiyon main islam ne madhya or dakshin purv asia main jo kiya tha, vah hindu jivan style ke sabhi nishaanon ko mitaa dene kii maang kar rahaa tha
 The seventh phase, post-independence, cannot be ignored, even if it extends only to the last 70 years, as it begins with violent and blood-soaked divisions on religious grounds and the creation of East and West Pakistan for Muslims
 
 kya yah bharat ko mul rup se ek hindu rajya bana detaa he? yaa kya yah "bharat ke vichaar" ko prerit karata he jahaan sabhi logon ko samaan sammaan miltaa he, chaahe dharm or jati kaa? alag-alag log alag-alag jawaab denge
 Hindutva saw secularism as minority disciplinary, positive discrimination as a counterrevolution of specific castes, socialism as just angry capitalism, the creation of gender equality by threatening the principles of social justice and traditional Hindu family values, and the Uniform Civil Code Another way of dividing India as an absence of
 kai buddhijiviyon ne jab unka tark diya ki hindu dharm or bharat jaisi avadharanaen british kii rachana thim, to koi vaastavik pracheen jadon ke saath, aam janata kii aasthaa ko kalpit kalpanaaon ke vipareet ke rup main asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 It became worse when academics around the world equated terrorism with racism, denying Islam with terrorism, or denying Christianity with terrorist missionary activity
 bahut se logon ne marxvad, udaarvaad or dharmanirpekshata ke siddhant ko bahusankhya bharatiyon main vifal kar diya, jinamein se zyaadaatar garibi garibi main rah rahe hai
 Fair or not, the victim felt it was time to give Hindutva an opportunity despite its aggressively masculine stance, especially since it spoke of the language of development, and aspirations

 Management consulting primarily refers to both practice and industry helping organizations improve their performance and develop plans for improvement through analysis of existing business problems
 sanghathan kai kaarnon se prabandhan salaahkaaron kii sevaaon ko hasil karte hai jisamen bahari salaah hasil karnaa or salaahkaaron kii vishisht visheshgyata kaa upyog karnaa bhi shaamil he
 Because of the association and risk associated with many organizations, consulting companies reportedly have to be aware of the industry's "best practices" although the ability to transfer such practices from one organization to another is problematic depending on the circumstances under consideration Can

 Management consultants typically use their own, proprietary methods or frameworks to guide the identification of problems and serve as the basis for recommendations to carry out business tasks in a more effective or efficient manner

 One of the many reasons for the rise of the first management consulting company in the USA is the deep cultural factors: it was accepted there that management and such boards could not be competent or qualified in all circumstances; Therefore, the process of purchasing external qualifications was seen as a common way of solving a business-related problem

 This is referred to as the "pater Familias" method
 Therefore, it was considered inappropriate to ask for external advice
 However, it is sometimes argued that in those days the type of education of executives in the USA was often different than in Europe where managers were often of technical or other special backgrounds - such as graduates of technical Grandes Ecoles in France or in Germany
 Similar to "doctors") - but their specific management education was often limited

 It can generally be assumed that different approaches to counseling are situated somewhere along the continuum where there is an 'expert' or prescriptive approach on one side and a convenient approach on the other
 visheshgy drushtikon main salaahkaar visheshgy kii bhoomika nibhaataa he or graahak ko visheshgy salaah yaa sahyog pradaan karata he or isaki tulana main suvidhajanak drushtikon ke tahat, graahakon se kam input liya jaataa he or bahut kam sahyog pradaan kiya jaataa he
 With a convenient approach, the consultant focuses less on specialized or technical expert knowledge but more on the consultation process

 ye sab ek saath ek matrix kaa nirmaan karte hai, jahaan matrix main ek yaa ek se adhik "kaksh " par salaahkaaron kaa kabza hota he
 For example, one consultant may specialize in retail industry operations and another consultant may focus on process improvement in the downstream oil and gas industry

 ek teevr vikasshil kshetra hone ke baavjood, sampoorn rup se prabandhan paraamarsh udyog par vichaar karne par in sabase badi sorcing salaahkaar companiyon ko sambhawatah boutique companiyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jayega, jinamein se ek sabase badi company udhaaharan ke taur par tipiai he, jisaki 2006 kii aay, iesji dwaara iske adhigrahan ke dauraan, 150 million america dollar se kam thi
 Another way to differentiate among consulting companies is based on the income model: 1
 samay or prayaas ke aadhaar par: zyaadaatar companiyaan samay or prayaas ke aadhaar par bhugtan maangati hai
 They use specific studies and past records, such as mckinsey, BCG, etc
, to determine fees
 2
 keval vitarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par: bahut kam or aam taur par boutique companiyaan, jinka safalataa dar kaaphi acha hota he, is aadhaar par bhugtan maangati hai
 3
 Combination of both: Many large companies assume a share of remuneration based on distributed results
 lekin aamtaur par parivartaneey ghatak kul ghatakon kaa keval 20-30% hota he
 Management consulting is also becoming more prevalent in non-business related areas
 jaise-jaise peshewar or vishesh salaah kii jarurat badhati ja rahi he vaise-vaise sarkari, ardh-sarkari or labharahit agenciyaan unheen prabandhkeey siddhanton kii taraf mud rahi hai jinhone saalon tak nijee kshetra ko sahaayta di thi
 An industry structural trend that occurred in the early part of the twenty-first century was the by-product or separation of consulting and accounting units of large diversified professional advisory companies, with Ernst & Young, pwc and KPMG being the most notable
 lekhankan or lekhapareekshan companiyon ke rup main apane vyavsaay ko shuru karne vaali in companiyon ke liye prabandhan paraamarsh unke vyavsaay kaa ek nayaa vistaar tha
 But after several highly publicized scandals related to accounting practices, such as the Enron scandal, these companies began divesting their management consulting units to more easily comply with strict regulatory scrutiny
 duniya ke kuch bhaagon main yah chalan ab ulta rup le rahaa he, jahaan companiyaan teji se apane prabandhan paraamarsh sadhano kaa phir se nirmaan kar rahi hai, jaisaa ki unki korporate websiton main saafe dikhaai detaa he
 These approaches include corporations that set up their own internal consulting groups, for which they employ internal management consultants, either from the corporation, or from outside companies
 kai nigamon main 25 se 30 purnakalik salaahkaaron vaale aatanrik samooh hote hai
 Internal consulting groups are often created roughly equal to the number of practices or practice areas, which typically include: organizational development, process management, information technology, design services, training and development
 aatanrik salaahkaaron ko niyukt karne vaali companiyon ko in aatanrik salaahkaaron se kai sambhavit laabh praapt hote hai: Note: In the evaluation of cost effectiveness, corporations should be aware and consistent with how the internal consultant's expenses will be levied at the project level and organizational level
 aatanrik salaahkaaron kaa ek samooh baariki se bahari paraamarsh companiyon kii nigaraanee or unke saath kaam kar saktaa he
 This will ensure better delivery, quality and overall operational relationships
 paraamarsh sevaayen pradaan karne vaali bahari companiyon main praathamikta ke maamle main virodhabhas rahata he
 The health of the outside company is more important than the health of their client
 haal ke dinon main sarkari shashan pranaaliyon main prabandhan paraamarsh kaa istemaal kaaphi bad gaya he
 Booz Allen Hamilton is now particularly well known as a consultant, primarily serving the US federal government
 deloit kansalting elelpi, sarkari vibhaagon or agenciyon kii sabase zyada mushkil samasyaon ke samaadhaan main, unki madad karne main apni udyog visheshta or dashakon ke anubhav kaa istemaal karata he
 The Agricultural Finance Corporation Limited in India mainly advises government and related institutions
 1997 se 2006 tak, lebar sarkaron ne prabandhan salaahkaaron ke liye 20 billian pound or iti pranaaliyon ke liye kam se kam or 50 billian pound kharch kiya he, jo pichley roodhiwaadee sarkaar dwaara ek saal main kharch kiye gaye 500 million pound se kaaphi adhik he
 There has been a one-third increase in spending on consultants from 2003 to 2006 and £ 2
1 billion from 2003 to 2004 and £ 2
8 billion from 2005 to 2006, mainly due to an increase in spending by the National Health Service 
 pichley teen saalon main badi paraamarsh companiyon se paraamarsh sevaaon liye jane par 7
2 billian pound kharch kiya gaya he
 The web service "vault
com" produces a list of the top 50 consulting companies working every year
 ranking ke samay kuch anya vikalpon ke uparaant company kii sabhyataa, abhyaas shakti, pratishtha or muaavja par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The top 25 companies of the year 2011 are as follows: lagaataar ucch or badhati aay ke baavjood, prabandhan paraamarsh company ko lagaataar client evam prabandhan vidwano se aalochana milti rahati hai
 "management consultants are often criticized for the excessive use of popular or popular terms and the promotion and reliance on management craze and failure to develop AC plans that clients can execute
 " prabandhan paraamarsh ke bare main kai mahatvapurn kitabon main yah tark diya gaya he ki vastav main prastaavit parivartan kaa nirmaan karne ke liye prabandhan paramarshkari salaah or vyavsaay kaaryakariyon kii kshamta ke bich ke bemail ke parinamswaroop maujuuda vyavsaayon main kaaphi nuksaan hota he
 According to Chris Argiris's book, "flood Advice and the Management Trap", Chris Argiris believes that most of the advices given today have a fair amount of real merit
 haalanki, nazadiiki avlokan se pataa chalata he ki aajkal di jane vaali zyaadaatar salahon main antaraal or visangatiyaan hoti hai, jo bhavishya main sakaaratmak parinaamon ko roak sakati hai
 Despite very high fees, unrestricted permit companies are often accused of making empty promises
 un par aksar "spashtvaadi" na hone or unki salaah jis aadhaar par kahi jaani chahie us anubhav kaa abhaav hone kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 These consultants bring little innovation and instead provide simple and "prepackaged" strategies and plans that are irrelevant to the client's particular use
 ve clienton ke saamne, unase pehle apni company ke hiton ko rakhkar, apni jimmedaariyon ko praathamikta dene main vifal ho sakate hai
 Another concern is the promise given by consulting companies on the sustainability of results
 client or paraamarsh companiyon ke bich ke kaamkaaj ke ant main, aksar is baat kii ummid rahati he ki salaahkaar apane prayaas tikaau he esa sunishchit karne ke liye kuch samyavadhi tak pariyojna ke parinaamon kaa lekha pareekshan karenge
 Although sustainability has been promoted by some consulting companies, it is difficult to implement because of the disconnection between the client and consulting companies after the project is closed
 atirikt aalochanaon main shaamil hai: laagat main katautee karne ke abhiyaan main vyavsaay kaa algaav, keval vishleshan report pradaan karnaa, junior salaahkaar senior salaahkaaron kii dar se bhugtan maangate hai, "custom kaary" ke rup main kai clienton ko ek hi tarah ke reporton ko phir se bechnaa, navachaar kaa abhaav, un dinon ke liye overbiling karnaa jab kaam nahin kiya gaya he, gunvattta ke mulya par gati, anuttaradaayi badi companiyaan or client par dhyaan dene kaa abhaav, anubandhon main parinaamon vishyak spashtataa kaa abhaav or gopneeyata
