 Knowing the sincere desire of the knowledgeable and humble Mahatmas, Mahamuni Sutaji accepted the grace
 unhone kaha-jan kalyaan kii laalasaa se aapane badi sundar ichha prakat kii
 i tell you to him
 yah sach he ki shri mad devi bhagwat puraana sabhi shastron tathaa dharmik granthon main mahaan he
 Big pilgrimage and fast are negligible in front of it
 is puraana ke sunne se paap sookhe van kii bhaanti jalakar nasht ho jate hai, jisase manushya ko shok, klesh, du:kha aadi nahin bhogane padate
 Just as darkness is cut off in front of the sunlight, similarly, hearing of Bhagavat Purana eliminates all the sufferings, diseases and inhibitions of human beings
 mahatmaon ne sutaji se bhagwat puraana ke sambandh main ye jigyaasaaen rakhin: By the combination of Maharishi Parashar and Goddess Satyavati, Anshvatar Dev Vyasji of Srinarayan was born
 vyasaji ne apane samay or samaaj kii sthiti pahachaanate hue vedon ko chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya or apane chaar patu shishyon ko unka bodh karaayaa
 After this, he created eighteen Puranas for the welfare of the male and female retarded women, who were deprived of the right to study, so that they too would be able to practice religion
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 shri krishna prasenjit ko dhundhane ke prayaas main kho gaye the jo shri devi bhagwati ke aashirwad se sakushal laut aae
 While narrating this account in detail with the wishes of the Maharishi, Mr
 Sutji started saying - Gentlemen Long ago, Bhojwanshi King Satrajit lived in Dwarka Puri
 surya kii bhakthi-aradhana ke bal par usne swamantak naam kii atyant chamakdaar mani praapt kii
 Due to the revolution of Mani, the king himself became sun-like
 is bhram main jab yadavon ne shrikrishna se bhagwaan surya ke aagaman kii baat kahi, tab antaryami krishna ne yadavon kii shankaa kaa nivaaran karte hue kaha ki aane vaale mahanubhav swamantak manidhari raja satrajit hai, surya nahin
 The virtue of the self-styled gem was that the person holding it would receive eight kilos of gold per day
 us pradesh main kisi bhi prakaar kii maanviya yaa divine vipatti kaa koi chihn tak nahin tha
 Krishna himself aspired to receive the Swatantak Mani, but Satrajit rejected it
 ek baar satrajit kaa bhai prasenjit us mani ko dhaaran karke ghode par chadhakar shikaar ko gaya to ek singh ne use maar daalaa
 Incidentally, a bear named Jamwant killed Singh and he took Mani to his cave
 jamavant kii beti mani ko khilonaa samajhakar khilne lagi
 On Prasenjit's return, a rumor spread in Dwarka that Krishna was assassinated by Sranjith's refusal to grant Mani to Krishna and took possession of Mani
 krishna is afvaah se du:khee hokar prasenjit ko khojane ke liye nikal pade
 In the forest, Krishna and his companions found a lion dead along with Prasenjit
 unhen vahaan rich ke pairon ke nishaanon ke sanket bhi mili, jo bheetar gupha main pravesh ke suchak the
 With this Krishna speculated to kill Singh and near Mani's bear
 apane saathiyon ko baahar rahakar pratiksha karne ke liye kahkar swayan krishna gupha ke bheetar pravesh kar gaye
 After a long time, the returned companion, disheartened when Krishna did not return, falsely propagated the death of Krishna
 krishna ke na lautne par unke pita vasudev putr-shok main vyathit ho uthe
 At the same time Maharishi Narada came
 samachar jaanakar naradji ne vasudev se shrimad devi bhagwat puraana ke shravan kaa upadesh diya
 Vasudev was previously familiar with the grace of Mother Bhagwati
 unhone naradji se kaha-devarshi, devaki ke saath karagaravaas karte hue jab chha: putr kansa ke haathon maare ja chuke the to ham donon pati-patni kaaphi vyathit or ansatulit ho gaye the
 Then he consulted his clan priest Maharishi Garg and asked for a solution to get rid of trouble
 gurudev ne jagadamba maa kii gaatha kaa parayan karne ko kaha
 Being in prison was not possible for me
 at: gurudev se hi yah kaary sampann karaane kii prarthana kii
 Vasudev said - By accepting my prayer, Gurudev went to Vindhyachal mountain and worshiped the goddess with the Brahmins
 vidhi-vidhanpurvak devi bhagwat kaa nawahr yajna kiya
 On completion of the ritual, Gurudev informing me of this, said - Goddess has pleased this Akashvani - With my inspiration, Vishnu himself will incarnate the house of Vasudev Devaki to alleviate the suffering of the earth
 vasudev ko chahie ki us balak ko gokul gram ke nand-yashoda ke ghar pahunchaa den or usee samay utpann yashoda kii balika ko laakar aathvin santan ke rup main kansa ko saunp den
 Kans, as always, would throw the baby girl to the ground
 vah balika kansa ke haath se tatkaal chhootakar divya sharir dhaaran kar, mere hi ansh rup se lok kalyaan ke liye vidhyanchal parvat par vaas karegi
 On hearing this ritual fruit by Garga Muni, i expressed happiness and completed the following events according to Muni's statement and protected Krishna
 yah vivaran sunaakar vasudev naradji se kehane lage-muniver ! saubhaahgya se aapkaa aagaman mere liye shubh he
 Therefore, please oblige me by narrating the story of Goddess Bhagwat Purana
 vasudev ke kehane par naarad ne anugrah karte hue nawahr parayan kiya
 At the end of the ninth day, Vasudeva worshiped Naradji and when Krishna entered the cave from the Maya of Bhagwati's mother, he saw a girl playing with a gem
 jaise hi krishna ne balika se mani lee, to balika ro uthi
 Hearing the crying of the girl, Jamwant arrived there and started fighting with Krishna
 donon main sattaees din tak yuddh chalata rahaa
 By the grace of Goddess, Jamwant continued to suffer and Shri Krishna became powerful
 ant main unhone jamavant ko parajeet kar diya
 By the grace of Bhagwati, Jamwant had a prior memory
 treta main ravan kaa vadh karne vaale ram ko hi dwapar main krishna ke rup main avatarit jaanakar unki vandana kii
 Apologized for the crime committed in ignorance
 mani ke saath apni putree jambavati ko bhi prasantaapurvak krishna ko samarpit kar diya
 After the narrative ended in Mathura, Vasudev was taking blessings after the Brahmin banquet, at the same time Krishna reached there with Mani and Jambavati
 krishna ko vahaan dekhakar sabhi kii prasannataa kii koi seemaa na rahi
 In gratitude to Bhagwati, vasudev-devaki welcomed Shri Krishna with tearful eyes
 vasudev kaa safal kaam banaakar naarad devloak waapas laut gaye
 According to the Goddess Bhagwat Purana, Sutji while narrating this story to the incoming monks said, Sridvalu sages! The devotees should take advice from any astrologer to get the auspicious time for Katha Shravan or it is suitable for Navratras

 After that, one should listen to the Devi Katha while meditating

 At the same time, until the 20th century, it has generally grown significantly in the form of limited editions such as graphic novels, comics albums, and tankobans, and has now proved to be a huge success in the 21st century as an online webcomics
 kamiks itihaas kaa vividh vikaas bhi saanskrithik vividhta kii dein he
 Intellectuals believe that such a beginning can be gauged from the cave paintings of Lascaux of the prehistoric era

 If you look at the history of European comics, the cartoon strip made by Rudolf Tappfer in 1830 was very popular, which later became a successful strip and book form by 1930, The Adventure of Tintin
 america kamiks ne saarvajanik madhyam paane ke liye 20veen ke purv tak akhabaaron ke kamiks strip dwaara paith jamaai; patrika-style kii kamiks pustaken bhi 1930 main prakashit hone lagi, or 1938 main superman jaise prakhyat kirdaar ke aagaman baad superhiro peedi kaa ek nayaa daur udai hua
 At the same time, the original history of Japanese comics or cartooning is even older than the earlier 12th century
 japan main aadhunik kamiks strip kaa udai 20veen main hi hua, or kamiks patrikaon evam pustakon kaa baari utpaadan bhi dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hua jisamen osamu tezuka jaise cartooniston ko kaaphi shoharat dilaai
 Although the history of comics had been known as second-rate until then, by the end of the 20th century, it was wholeheartedly approved by the public and educational institutions

 Although other definitions such as these comedic works were used extensively on the comic strips of former American newspapers, it soon created non-comedic-like criteria
 angreji main saamaanya taur par kamiks ke ullekh kii tarah hi vibhinn samskritiyon main bhi unki mul bhashaaon main upyog hota rahaa he, jaise japani kamiks ko minga, evam french bhashaa kii kamikson ko bandis desinis kaha jaataa hai
 But so far there is no consensus among thinkers and historians about the correct definition of comics; Some emphasize their argument that it is a combination of pictures and words, some call it a story of pictures related to or ordered from other paintings, and some other historians admit it is like a mass-scale reproduction in which a particular character Frequent frequency

 Such satirical cartoons have had a long prehistoric period in Japan and the era of comics was coined with World War II

 At the same time, Japanese comics began to develop from the modern era during the war when Osamu Tezuka became part of the creation of its fruitful work

 The list of Chambers is somewhat different
 lagbhag 20 varshon ke saahitiyik jivan main shakespeare kii sarjanaatmak pratibha nirantar viksit hoti gai
 In general, four different stages are seen in this development
 praarambhik avasthaa 1595 main samaapt hui
 Almost all the works of this period are experimental
 shakespeare abhi tak apana maarg nishchit nahin kar paae the, atev vibhinn prachlit rachanapranaliyon ko kram se karyanvit karke apana rachanavidhan susthir kar rahe the, pracheen sukhaant naatakon kii prahasanatmak style main unhone 'di kamedi ov erars' or 'di teming of di su' kii rachana kii
 Subsequently, in 'love's Labors Lost', he followed the pattern of Lily's courtly pleasures
 isamen rajdurbar kaa vaataavaran upasthit kiya gaya he jo chatur paatro ke rochak vaartalap se paripurna he
 'the Two Gentlemen of Verona' imitates Greene's romanticistic pleasantries
 du:khant naatak bhi anukaranaatmak hai
 In 'richard III' the goods are imitated and in 'titus Andronicus' the Kid is followed but in 'romeo and Juliet' the element of origin is relatively high
 isi kaal main likhi hui donon prasiddh kavitaayen 'di rape aav lukris' or 'venus and adonis' par tatkaaleen italian premakavy kii chhap he
 The second phase of development ended in 1600
 isamen shakespeare ne anek praudh rachanaayen sansar ko bhent kin
 Now he had set his path and gained confidence
 'e mid samar nits dream' tathaa 'di marchent aav venice' rochak evam lokapriy sukhaant naatak hai kintu inase bhi adhik mahatv rakhanevaale shakeyapear ke sarvotkrisht sukhaant naatak 'much ado ebout nathing', 'aij you like it' tathaa 'twailvath nite' isi kaal main likhe gaye
 In these plays, the imagination of the poet and the pleasure of his mind are well published
 sarvottam aitihaasik naatak bhi isi samay likhe gaye
 Marlowe-influenced 'richard II' is far more successful in composition than the previous category of the same category, 'richard III'
 'henry chaturth' ke donon bhaag or 'henry pancham' jo suvikhyath aitihaasik naatak hai, isi kaal kii rachanaayen hai
 Almost all of Shakespeare's sonnets, which are unique for their excellent expression, were written between 1595 and 1607
 teesri avasthaa, jiskaa ant lagbhag 1607 main hua, shakespeare ke jivan main vishesh mahatv rakhti he
 The poet's mind was distressed over the years due to family misfortune and health problems
 at: in dinon kii adhikansh rachanaayen du:khant hai
 The worldly sorrow drama Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, and the Roman sorrow drama Julius Caesar, 'antoine and Cleopatra' and 'coriolanus' were written and played during this period
 'travaylas and cracida', 'als wel dait ands wel' or 'major for major' main sukh or du:kha kii sanshlisht abhivyakti hui he, tab bhi du:khad ansh kaa hi praadhanya he
 In the final stages of development, Shakespeare created Perrickles, Sinvelin, 'the Winters Tale', 'the Tempest' Prabhriti plays, which, despite being peaceful, filled with sad possibilities and created an evening atmosphere
 in sukhaant du:khant naatakon ko romance athwa shakespeare ke antim naatakon kii sangya di jaati he
 Shakespeare's pleasant plays have their own personal characteristics
 yadhyapi 'di kamedi aav erars' main platus kaa anusaran kiya gaya he tathaapi anya sukhaant naatak pracheen clasiki naatakon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Their purpose is not to eradicate the deformities and improve the errors by the skit, but to entertain people through interesting story and characterization
 is prakaar ke praaia: sabhi naatakon kaa vishay prem kii aisi teevr anubhuti he jo yuvakon or yuvatiyon ke man main sahaj aakarshan ke rup main swat: utpann hoti he
 Obstacles first come in the way of the lovers but by the end of the play the difficulties are overcome and they result
 in rachanaaon main jivan kii kavitvapurn evam kalpanapravan abhivyakti hui he or samast vaataavaran ahlad se ot-prot he
 Shakespeare was introduced to certain upper-class families and the kind of life he saw in them is published in these plays
 du:khant naatakon main maanav jivan kii gambhir samasyaon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The aristocratic protagonists of these plays become victims of torture and destruction after being on the road to success and progress for some time
 unke du:kha or mrityu ke kya kaaran hai, is vishay par shakespeare kaa mat spasht rup se abhivyakt hua he
 The misfortune of the protagonist is partly derived from unfavorable destiny and circumstances, but a much bigger reason is found in his character weakness
 pracheen unani dukhaant naatakon main nayak keval trutipurna nirnay athwa trutipurna drushtikon ke kaaran vinasht hota tha parantu, kadachit isai dharm or naitikwaad se prabhavit hokar, shakespeare ne apane naatakon main nayak ke patan kii pradhan jimmedaari uski charitrik durbalata par hi rakhi he
 Hamlet, Athelo, Lear and Macbeth - all of them find such a deficiency in their nature or character that causes their suffering and death
 in du:khant naatakon main duhara dwandv parilakshith hua he, aantarik dwandv ev bahya dwandv
 Internal conflict arises in the mind of the hero, in his thoughts and feelings and due to his intensity not only makes decisions difficult but also distracts the hero's principle for some time
 is prakaar ke aantarik dwandv ke kaaran naatakon main manovaigyanik sookshmata or rochakata kaa aavirbhaav hua he
 External conflict arises from the competition of external powers and their struggle, such as mutual opposition of two opposing political parties or armies
 shakespeare ke pramukh du:khant naatakon main raktagat evam bhayaavah drishyon kii avatarana ke kaaran atyant aatankapurna vaataavaran nirmit hua he
 Likewise, the incorporation of murder and vengeance scenes also deepened the process of depression
 in sabhi visheshtaon or upkarnon ko shakespeare ne katipay puraane naatakon tathaa seneka, kid, marlo aadi naatakakaron se grahan kiya tha or samayik lokaruchi ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi unka upyog apane naatakon main kiya tha
 The features of the grief dramas we have mentioned here are found not only in Hamlet, Athelo, King Lear, and Macbeth, but also partly in the grief plays based on Romeo and Juliet and the history of England and Rome
 Huh
 shakespeare ne jin aitihaasik naatakon kii rachana kii unamem kai roman itihaas vishyak hai
 In the writings of these Roman plays, Shakespeare has altered the facts of history quite a bit, and at some sites it appears that the portrait of life presented is not of ancient Rome but of Elizaveth England
 itnaa hone par bhi ye naatak sadaiv lokapriy rahe hai, visheshkar julius sijar tathaa antony and cleopatra
 Antoine Aid Cleopatra is full of poetic passages and the characterization of Cleopatra is extremely effective
 timen ov athens or pericules main unani itihaas kii ghatnaon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Among the plays based on English history, there are some that are written only partially by Shakespeare, but both Henry IV and Henry v are penned by Shakespeare
 in teenon naatakon main kavi ko mahan safalataa mili he
 They have a very attractive rendition of valor and honor and Falstaff's character is very interesting and charming
 richard tritiy or richard dwitiya main marlo kaa anukaran safaltaapurvak kiya gaya he
 Most English historical plays prior to Shakespeare contained inanimate depictions of facts and events, and they were monotonous due to blank history
 shakespeare ne is prakaar ke naatakon ko jeevant rup dekar chamatkaarpurn bana diya he
 Shakespeare's mature biography is found in the final plays
 mahakavi ko apane jivan main vibhinn prakaar ke anubhav hue the jinaki jhalak uni kritiyon main dikhaai padati he
 There is imagination in the pleasing plays of love, and the poet's mind is rich in luxury and youth
 du:khant naatakon main aise du:khad anubhavon ko abhivyakti he jo jivan ko vishakt bana dete hai
 Shakespeare's work has resulted in the creation of plays that have resulted in his perfect intelligence
 kavi ab apni vivekpurna drushti se dekhtaa he ki jivan main sukh or du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: daanon hi kshanik hai
 Both are embedded in grief in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha ke baad sukh aata he, atev vichaar or vyavhaar main samatv vaanchhneeya he
 These final plays lead to the conclusion that mercy and forgiveness are more invulnerable than violence and vengeance
 apane gambhir naitik sandesh ke kaaran in naatakon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Shakespeare's plays are Romantic and separate from the tradition of ancient Greek and Latin plays
 at: unamem vastuvinyas kii shastreey visheshtaon ko foondnaa uchit nahin he
 Only in his last play 'the Tempest' have he managed the three inventions
 praaia: sabhi anya naatakon main keval karyanviti kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, samay or sthaan kii drushti se ve nitant niabandh hai
 There is always enough detail in the plot and usually many stories are embedded in it
 udaahranarth ham e mid samar nits dream, di marchent aav venice, aiz you like it athwa king lier ko le sakate hai
 In all these, a mix of many stories has done the objective work
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki shakespeare ke naatakon kii banaavat trutipurna he
 The end-of-the-story storytelling is beautifully crafted, and there is a sense of unity collected from the entire plot
 shastreey arth main anvitiyon kaa abhaav hone par bhi in svachhndathawadi naatakon main bhavanatmak tathaa kalpanaatmak ekikaran hua he
 Shakespeare has more success in characterization
 apane naatakon main unhone anek aakarshak paatro kii sristi kii he jo apane jeevant rup main hamaare saamne aate hai
 Over time the process of characterization became more and more subtle and artistic
 udhaaharan ke liye ham sukhaant naatakon main samavisht rojalin, porcia, viartras, rojalind, vyla prabhruti pragalbha naariyon ko le sakate hai jo apni prakhar buddhi or vaakchaturi kaa parichay nirantar detii hai
 The second category are those women whose unique beauty and perilous experiences lead to compassion in the mind
 es naariyon main pramukh hai juliet, ophilia, desdymona, cardilia, imozen ityadi
 Characterization is highly important in sad plays
 udhaaharan ke liye ham hamelet ko le sakate hai
 All the events of the play are centered on the character of the protagonist and the development of the narrative is effected by his personality
 anshat: yahi baat anya du:khant naatakon ke liye bhi satya he
 Many memorable characters are found in ancient Greek plays, but Shakespeare's main characters, depicted using moral and psychological devices, are far more interesting and attractive
 aantarik dwandv ke upyog se du:khant naatakon kii patrakalpana or bhi adhik chamatkaarpurn ho gai he
 Some other characters in Shakespeare's plays are also notable such as clown and villain
 vidushakon main phalstaff tochastone, feste or king lier kaa swamibhakt vidooshak aadi mahatvapurn hai
 Villains include Richard III, Iago, Edmund Iyashi, etc
 jaisaa hazlit ne likhaa he, shakespeare kii shakti kaa pataa isse lagata he ki na keval unke mahatvapurn paatro main vaishishty he varan unke bahusankhyak laghu paatr bhi apana nijee mahatv rakhte hai
 Although prose is used elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, they are still poetic in origin
 unka adhikansh bhaag chandobaddh he
 Not only this, almost all theatrical works are full of poetic qualities
 kalpana kaa prakaashan, alankarik abhivyakti, sangitatmak lay tathaa komal bhaawanaaon ke nirupan dwaara shakespeare ne manomuguakari prabhaav utpann kar diya he
 Since ancient times, plays were considered a mere distinction of poetry and Shakespeare accepted the ancient notion
 gadhy kaa prayog yada kada vishesh prayojan se hua he
 But in general we can call Shakespeare's plays poetic
 kavyatatv shuru main atyadhik tha kintu shanai: shanai: uskaa rup sanyat ho gaya or prayojan ke vichaar se uskaa niyantran hone laga
 Likewise, there was a constant effort to incorporate Shakespeare's style; As a result, early plays have an abundance of elaborate narratives and beautiful metaphors
 His style was balanced in his mature age by the time Shakespeare was composing his famous sorrowful plays
 praathmik avasthaa main abhivyakti kaa adhik mahatv tha or vichaaron kaa kam
 But in this secondary period, there is proper coordination of ideas, expressions and means of expression
 yah santulit vyavastha antim varshon main shakespeare kaa dhyaan vichaaron or naitik pratimaanon par kendrit tha or unhone shailigat chamatkaar kii upeksha kii
 That is why the style of the final plays has gone somewhere rough
 shakespeare ne apane naatak mukhyat: rangamanch par abhinay ke liye likhe the, yadhyapi kaavyatmak gunon ke kaaran ham unase pathan dwaara bhi anand praapt karte hai
 The arrangement of the acting of the erstwhile theater, the public interest of the audience, all influenced Shakespeare's theatrical production
 do ek udhaaharan hi paryaapt honge
 At that time dyed curtains were not used, so many descriptive pieces have been included in plays
 inhen varnanon dwaara sthaan, kaal or paristhiti kaa sanket hota tha
 The continuous use of the subject and self-talk in plays was possible because the next triangular part of the theater continued to spread among the observers
 kai purush or nari paatro kaa sarjan shakespeare ne keval isliye kiya ki unke upyukt abhinayta uplabdh the
 Many scenes have been opened for the entertainment of the audience, in which exciting and entertaining situations have been performed at the theater
 aaj ke yathartwaadee rangamanch kii bhanti elizveth yugin rangamanch prachur sadhano tathaa nishchit vyavastha dwaara bandhaa hua tha
 Both the acting and the performances were relatively free, so Shakespeare's plays have enough merit
 praaia: sabhi prakaar ke naatakon main mahakavi ne gey muktakon kaa sannivesh kiya he jo apane saundarya or maadhurya ke liye anupam hai
 Apart from these, there are elaborate poems of Shakespeare, in which 'vince and Adonis', 'the Rape of Lucreis' and Sanates are required to be mentioned
 ye sabhi kritiyaan 16 veen shatabdi ke antim dashak kii hai jab shakespeare kaa man saundarya evam pranay ke prabhaav se ahladaparn ho gaya tha
 An ancient love story has been described in a very poetic manner in 'vince and Adonis'
 'di rape ov lukris' main ek param sundari roman mahila ke durbhaagya or mrityu kii katha he
 There are some in the Sannets who are related to a friend of the poet who had decided not to marry
 shakespeare ne uske rup or gunon kii charchaa karte hue usase apana nishchay badalane ke liye aagrah kiya he
 The second order of the sennets is related to a Shyamvarna woman, who had developed intense attraction in the mind of the poet, but who did not respect the affection and gave her love to the friend of the poet, keeping in mind the first order of the sennets
 shakespeare ne in saneton main apni aantarik bhaawanaaon kaa prakaashan kiya he athwa ve paramparaagat rachanaayen maatr hai, yah prashn atyant vivadagrast he

 In 1754, Margraf demonstrated that the soil called alumina is different from lime
 sar hanferi davy ne san 1807 hi main alumia mitti se dhaatu pruthak karne kaa praytn kiya, parantu safalataa na mili
 In 1825, Arstad heated aluminum chloride with potassium content and then distilled the mercury
 aisa karne par jo churna sa batch rahaa usamen dhaatu kii chamak thi
 This metal is called aluminum
 san 1845 main frederick vohalar ne is dhaatu ke taiyaar karne main potacium dhaatu kaa prayog apchaayak ke rup main kiya
 He found some small particles of this metal, after examining which he told that this new metal is very light and its wires can be pulled
 tadnantar sodium or sodium aluminium chloride kaa prayog karke san 1854 main devil ne is dhaatu kii acchhee maatra taiyaar kii
 Being a new metal at that time, aluminum was counted among precious metals and was used in decorations and ornaments
 san 1886 main ohayo nagar main chalrs martin haul ne gale hue cryolite main alumina ghola or usamen se vidyudvishleshan vidhi dwaara aluminium dhaatu pruthak kii
 In the same year in Europe also, HERO independently made this metal in this way
 yahi haul-hero-vidhi aajkal is dhaatu ke utpaadan main vyavahrut ho rahi he
 Since it is lighter and cheaper, the prevalence of aluminum and alloys has been increasing since then
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke liye do khanijon kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 One is bauxite and cryolite
 bauksite ke vistrut nikshep bharat main ranchi, palamu, jabalpur, balaghat, selem, belgaum, kolhapur, thana aadi jilon main paae gaye hai
 The permitted quantity of this mineral in this country is 28 million tonnes
 aluminium dhaatu taiyaar karne ke nirmitt pehla praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki bauksite se shuddh alumina mili
 a method of purification of bauxite is named after the Bayer method
 isamen bauksite ko garam castic soda ke vilyan ke saath abhikrut karke sodium aluminute bana lete hai
 This aluminate solution is filtered and the alumina is precipitated from it
 
 Aluminum metal from alumina is prepared by hall-hero method
 vidyudvishleshan ke liye jis cell kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah ispaat kaa bana ek bada baksaa hota he, jiske bheetar carbon kaa astr laga rahata he
 This lining of carbon is prepared by heating a mixture of coke, pitch and coal tar
 isi prakaar carbon ke dhanagar bhi taiyaar kiye jate hai
 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow
 vidyudvishleshan hone par jo aluminium dhaatu banati he vah cryolite se baari hoti he, at: cell main neeche baith jaati he
 This metal acts as a minus
 gali hui dhaatu samay-samay par cell main se baahar baha lee jaati he
 Alumina is added in the cell as needed
 cryolite ke galnaank ko kam karne ke liye isamen bahudhaa thodaa sa calcium floride bhi mila dete hai

 Since 2005 it has regularly been the busiest shopping day of the year, although in news reports, which were not correct at the time, it has long been described as the busiest shopping day of the year

 baad main ek vaikalpik vyakhya kii shuruyaat hui: ki "blike friday" us avadhi ke bare main bataata he jiske dauraan khudara vikreta ek laabh kii sthiti yaa "in da blike" main aa jate hai
 Because Thanksgiving always falls on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, the day after that falls between 23 and 29 November
 samachar media ne thankgiving ke agle din ko kaaphi lambey samay se varsh main kharidari ke sabase vyast din ke rup main bataaya he
 In the early years, this was not really the case

 However, in 2003, Black Friday was actually the busiest shopping day of the year and it has maintained that position every year except 2004, when it was ranked second

 iske atirikt kai niyokta apane karmchaariyon ko thankgiving kii chuttee ke ek hisse ke rup main us din kii chuttee dete hai jisase kharidaaron kii sankhya bad jaati he
 In order to take advantage of this, almost all big and small retailers in the country offer different types of sale

 Other retailers, such as Sears, Aeropostale and Kemart, started Black Friday sales early in the morning on Thanksgiving and continued it until 11

 Forever 21 decided to walk in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday and continuing the sale until late in the night and working until 2:00 on Saturday morning
 aitihaasik rup se blike friday kii bikri ko agle saptahanth tak nirantar jari rakhana aam baat thi
 While this trend has largely disappeared in recent years, it is probably due to an attempt by retailers to create a broader sense of inevitability

 The earliest known reference referring to "black Friday" as the day after Thanksgiving was made in a 1966 publication in Philadelphia on the significance of this day: janvari 1966 - "blike friday" vah naam he jise philadelphia ke police vibhaag ne thankgiving de ke baad aane vaale shuukravaar ko diya he
 It is not a word of love towards him
 "blike friday" shahar ke centre main christmas kii kharidari ke avasar kii aadhikarik taur par shuruyaat karata he or yah aam taur par baari trephic jam or footpaathon par bahut zyada bheed lekar aata he jab shahar ke vyavsaayik kshetra kii dukaane khulne se lekar band hone tak khachaakhach bhari rahati hai
 The term Black Friday began to expand widely around 1975 as shown in two newspaper articles dated November 29, 1975, both of which have Philadelphia datelines
 pehla sandarbh da neuyork times main "army varses navy: e diming splandar" sheershak se prakashit aalekh main he: Every year that day, between Thanksgiving Day and the army-navy game - Philadelphia's police and bus drivers call it "black Friday

 This derivation is also evident in an Associated Press article titled "fox on Buying Spry Dispit Down Economy", which appeared in the Titusville Herald on the same day: dukaan ke raste jam the

 Many traders objected to the use of a negative word in reference to one of the most important shopping days of the year
 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat tak ek vaikalpik siddhant prachaarit kiya jane laga: jo yah he ki khudara vikreta paramparaagat rup se varsh ke adhikansh hisse main apane kaarobaar ko ek vittiya nuksaan main sanchalit karte hai or chhuttiyon ke mausam ke dauraan apana munaafaa arjeet karte hai jisaki shuruyaat thankgiving ke agle din se hoti he
 When it was recorded in financial records, red ink was used to indicate a negative amount and black ink was used to show a positive amount in common accounting practices of a time
 is siddhant ke tahat blike friday us avadhi kii shuruyaat he jahaan khudara vikreta ab nuksaan nahin uthaate hai balki varsh kaa munaafaa apane ghar le jate hai
 The earliest known experiment, similar to the 1966 example above, which was discovered by Bonnie taylor-blake of the American Dialect Society, is from Philadelphia in 1981, and it is the theory of "black ink" as one of many competing possibilities

 The notion that the next day of Thanksgiving marks the "official" start of the holiday shopping occasion is likely tied to the idea of the Santa Claus parade
 thankgiving samaaroh ko manaane kii parade main aksar parade kii samaapti par is vichaar ke saath santa clos kii upasthiti shaamil hoti he ki "santa clos aa gaya he" yaa "santa bas hamaare aas-paas maujuud he"

 Seeing so many differences and controversies, Ashoka established the original Buddhism in 253 or 246 BC, 236 years after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana
 In Pataliputra, an assembly of Buddhist monks was convened, whose Chairman, Stagnar Moggaliputta Tiss, considered the Theravada or Sthavirism as the only original Buddhism out of the 18 bodies, resolving the philosophical principles of the remaining 17 bodies and presenting it in a treatise called Kathavatthuppikaran
 yah granth usee samay se abhidhammpitak kaa ang mana jane laga
 The text contains a refutation of 216 doctrines of anti-sects, which is divided into 23 chapters, but it does not find a mention of the said anti-sects

 Some scholars are of the opinion that philosophical principles of some Ashokparavar sects are also dispensed with in Kathavatthu
 yah to purnataya spasht he kathavatthu main sampradaayon ke naamon kaa ullekh nahin he
 Therefore, it is natural to infer that the principles which were alive in the time of Moggaliputta Tis developed into a sect later

 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus

 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today

 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart

 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
