 Injuries and fatalities in a fully functioning parachute typically occur because the skydiver made unsafe attempts or missed a decision when flying his umbrella, resulting in a rapid velocity, especially on the ground or other hazards on the ground One of the most common sources of injury is under a high-capacity umbrella and a low turn while swooping
 Swooping is an advanced practice of gliding parallel to the ground while landing
 hawa kii badalati paristhitiyaan jokhim ke anya kaarak hai
 Parachutists may be caught in a downdraft close to the ground under hot winds and atmospheric disturbance on hot days
 badalati hawaaon ke kaaran tirchhi hawaaon yaa neeche kii ore hawaaon vaali landing ho sakati he jisamen landing gati main hawa kii gati jud jane ke kaaran chot kii sambhaavna kaaphi bad jaati he
 Another risk factor is the "umbrella collision" or collision of two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes
 chhatari kii takkar ke kaaran jampar kaa phulayaa hua parachute ek duusare ke saath ulajh jaataa he jiske parinaam swaroop aksar isamen shaamil ek yaa adhik parachute achaanak naakaam ho jaataa he 
 jab aisa hota he to jamparon ko aksar jaldi se apatkaaleen prakriyaayein nishpadit kerani chahie jisamen apni mukhya chhatari se "cat kar alag ho janaa" or apni rigerv chhatriyon kaa istemaal karnaa shaamil he
 The collision of the umbrella becomes particularly dangerous when the height is so low that the jumper does not get enough time to safely release from his main umbrella and fully utilize his reserve parachutes
 upkaran kii vifaltaa shaayad hi kabhi ghaatak parinaam or choton kaa kaaran banati he
 About once in a thousand uses of a main parachute, the result is seen as a defect
 ram-air parachute aam taur par kharaab hone par hi aniyantrit rup se ghoomane lagate hai, aise main rigerv parachute kaa istemaal karne se pehle ise avashya mukt kar liya janaa chahie
 Reserve parachutes are packaged differently and used differently, are designed and constructed in a more conserved manner, as well as tested to far more precise standards that allow them to exceed the main parachute
 Are reliable, but the real safety benefit comes from the possibility of an unexpected major failure that is a relatively low probability of a reserve fault Increases by leaps and bounds
 isse ek dohari kharabi kii kahin choti si sambhaavna paidaa ho jaati he haalanki ek mukhya kharabi kii sambhaavna rahati he jise kaat kar alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he jiske kaaran ek vipareet kharabi hoti he jo bahut hi vaastavik jokhim he
 Subjects of parachuting, such as base jumping or which involve equipment such as wingsuit flight or sky surfing, are a high risk factor due to the jumper's reduced maneuverability and far greater risk of entanglement
 {0}is kaaran se in vishyon kaa abhyaas aam taur par anbhavi jamparon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 {0} vyavsaayik filmon - visheshkar hollywood kii ection filmon - ke chithran main aam taur par khel ke khatre ko kaaphi badha-chadha kar dikhaaya jaataa he
 Those films often depict characters doing tricks that are directly impossible without the help of special effects
 anya maamalon main unke abhyaas kisi suraksha ke prati sajag drop jone yaa club main dharashayi yaa naakaam ho sakate hai
 USPA member drop zones in the US and Canada are required to have an experienced jumper acting as a "security officer" responsible for negotiating with jumper who breaks rules, regulations or otherwise any such Perform functions that are deemed unsafe by the person appointed
 kai deshon main yaa to sthaneey niyamon yaa drop jone maalikon ke daayitv ke prati jaagruk vivek kaa hona aavashyak he ki parachutist is khel main shaamil hone se pehle paripakvata kii umr tak avashya pahunch gaya he
 Parachuting can be a dangerous activity in bad weather, especially thunderstorms and lightning storms, strong winds and dusty storms
 pratishthit drop jone kharaab mausam ke dauraan saamaanya gatividhiyon ko roak dete hai
 Collision with the second umbrella is a statistical hazard and can be avoided by following simple principles
 skydiving kaa abhyaas kud ke bina kiya ja saktaa he
 Vertical aerial tunnels are used to practice freefall, while virtual reality simulated parachutes are used to practice parachute control
 prashikshan kii chaah rakhane vaale shuruaati skydiveron ke paas nimnlikhit vikalp hai: At the height of deployment of a skydiver, the person himself uses a small pilot-shoot that acts as an air guide, captures the air and pulls out the main parachute or main umbrella
 isamen do pramukh pranaliyaan upyog main laai jaati hai: "thro-out" jisamen skydiver mukhya container ke baahar ek chote pocket main sajaakar rakhe gaye payalat-shoot ke sheersh se jude togal ko khinchataa he: or "pul-out" jisamen skydiver container ke bheetar sajaaye gaye payalat-shoot se jude ek chote se pad ko khinchataa he
 Throw-out pilot-shoot pouches are usually placed on the bottom of the container - B
O
C
 Deployment system - but in older materials pouches are often fitted to the foot
 doosraa vikalp sapaat-udaan ke liye surakshit he lekin freestil yaa sir-neeche kar kiye jane vaale udaan ke liye aksar anupyukt hote hai
 In a special non-military parachute system, such as a throw-out, the pilot-shoot is attached to a line known as a "halter" that attaches to a small deployment bag that has a folded parachute
 , As well as hanging lines adorned in rubber bands
 container ke tal main jo tainaati bag ko pakad kar rakhata he, ek band loop hota he jise packing ke dauraan container ko band karne ke liye istemaal main laaye jane vaale chaar fleepon ke gromats ke madhyam se samaaya jaataa he
 At that time a sinuous pin which is connected to the halter is inserted through a closed loop
 agle charan main payalat-shoot ko modana or ise ek paauch main rakhana shaamil he
 Activation begins when the pilot-shoot is thrown out
 yah fail jaataa he or khinchaav paidaa karata he, pin ko band loop se baahar khinch liya jaataa he or container se tainaati bag ko khinch lene main payalat-shoot kii madad karata he
 The parachute lines are pulled loosely with rubber bands and spread as the umbrella begins to open
 kapade kaa ek ytaakar tukdaa jise "slider" kaha jaataa he yah parachute ke khulne kii prakriya ko dhimaa kar detaa he or neeche kii or iske maarg par tab tak kaary karata he jab tak ki chhatari puri tarah se khul nahin jaati he or slider skydiver ke sir ke thik upar nahin aa jaataa he
 The slider slows down and controls the deployment of parachutes
 slider ke bina parachute teji se fail jaataa he jo sambhavit rup se parachute ke kapade or / yaa latakaav linon ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 During a normal deployment the skydiver experiences a rapid decrease in speed, typically for a few seconds in the region of 3 to 4G while the parachute slows the mounting from 120 mph to about 18 mph
 agar koi skydiver apane mukhya parachute main kisi kharabi kaa anubhav karata he jise vah thik nahin kar saktaa he to vah apane harnes ke daayin ore saamne sthit ek "cat-awe" handle ko khinch letaa he jo mukhya chhatari ko harnes / container se nikaal detaa he
 Once the malfunctioning main umbrella is freed, the reserve umbrella itself can be activated by pulling a second handle on the front left harness
 kuch container mukhya se lekar rigerv parashooton tak ek sampark line se feet kiye gaye hote hai - jise ek rigerv static line ke rup main janaa jaataa he - jo rigerv container ko swayan dwaara nikaalane kii apeksha kahin adhik teji se khinchakar khol detaa he
 Regardless of the method used, a spring-loaded pilotshoot extracts the reserve parachute from the top half of the container
 jin vishyon main logon ko prashikshit kiya jaataa he unke atirikt upkarnon ko kharid sakate hai or koching / prashikshan praapt kar sakate hai, manoranjan ke liye skydiving karne vaale romaanch kaa majaa lene ke liye alag-alag tareeke dhundte hai
 An example of this is "hit and Rock" which is a type of precision landing designed to allow people of different ability levels to compete for adventure
 "hit and rock" mul rup se piopies se aayaa he
 See the main site of POPS
 iskaa uddeshy he kursi ke jitna kareeb sambhav ho land karnaa, parachute ke harnes ko hataanaa, kursi ke saath sprint hona, kursi par puri tarah se baith janaa or kam se kam ek baar peeche or aage jhulana
 pratiyogi ko us pal se samay diya jaataa he jab pair jameen ko choote hai or jab tak ki pehla rock puraa nahin ho jaataa he
 This activity is considered a race
 pound sweeping pratispardhi parashooting kaa ek swaroop he jisamen chhatari ke payalat pani kii ek choti ikai ke aar-paar phislan par or samudratat par chune kii koshish karte hai
 Such activities provide a happy mind competition, rating accuracy, speed, distance and style
 ank or saathiyon kii sweekruti us samay kam ho jaati he jab koi pratibhaagi "chous" ho jaataa he yaa samudratat tak pahunchane main naakaam hota he or pani main dub jaataa he
 a cross country jump is a skydive where participants immediately open their parachute after jumping with the intention that the ground under the umbrella be covered as much as possible
 The normal distance from the jump run to the drop zone can be as many as several miles
 camera udaan main ek cameraperson duusare skydiver ke saath kudata he or apni film banaata he
 The camera flier often wears specialized equipment, such as a wingsuit jumpsuit, helmet-mounted video and steel cameras, mouth-operated camera switches, and optical sites to provide a greater range of fall rates
 Some skydivers are proficient in camera flight and some charge students to film on trained litter or tandem-jumper, or produce professional scenes and photographs for the media
 skydiving samudaay main hameshaa achche camera udaakon kii maang rahati he kyonki skydiving sambandhi kai pratispardhi vishyon kaa nirnay ek video record ko dekhakar diya jaataa he
 Parachuting is not always limited to hours of day time; Experienced skydivers also occasionally perform night jumps

 Must have a lighted altimeter
 raatri kud kaa pradarshan karne vaale skydiver apane saath aksar flashlite lete hai jisase ki ve apni chhatriyon kii samuchit rup se tainaati kii jaanch kar saken
 It is also necessary to consider visibility for other skydivers and other aircraft; FAA regulations require skydivers participating in night jumps to wear light equipment visible up to three miles in each direction and illuminate it when under the umbrella
 raatri kud main ek kemlite kaa hona behatar mana jaataa he
 While landing at night, participants in the night jump should be made aware of the dark area
 apni chhatari ko 100 feet se upar udaane vaale jamparon ko paravartit pariveshi prakaash / chandramaa kii roshni ke kaaran aam taur par landing jone kaa sahi andaja hota he
 As they approach the ground, this ambient light source disappears due to the low angle of reflection
 ve jitna neeche aate hai, jameen utana hi andhakaarmay dikhaai detaa he
 At an altitude of about 100 feet and it may look like they are landing in a black tunnel
 achaanak yah bahut andhakaarmay ho jaataa he or iske turant baad jampar jameen par utar jaataa he
 For the first time, jumpers who participate in the night jump should be told about this ground attack and given an idea
 pichley daravaaje vaale vimaan or kudane ke liye ek vishaal, khaali sthaan kii uplabdhta se staff jump sambhav ho jaataa he
 In this type of jump, skydivers jump out with something
 rabad kii nauka se kudana lokapriy he jahaan jampar ek rabar kii nauka main baithta he
 Cars, bicycles, motorcycles, vacuum cleaners, water tanks and fluffers have also been thrown out of the back of the aircraft
 ek nishchit oonchai par jampar us vastu se alag ho jaataa he or apane parashooton kaa istemaal karata he jo ise terminal veg se jameen par takaraane main madad karata he
 Many countries have national parachuting associations, many of which are affiliated with the Federation Aeronautic Internationale to promote their sport
 zyaadaatar maamalon main rashtriya pratinidhi nikaayon ke saath-saath sthaneey dropzon operataron ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki pratibhaagiyon ke paas unke prashikshan, khel main unke anubhav ke str or unki pramanit sakshmata ko satyapit karne vaala praaanpatr hona chahie

 The cost in this game is not modest
 nayi takneekee suvidhaon yaa kshamta vruddhi ke sadhano ko pesh kiye jane se upkarnon kii keemten kuch adhik ho jaati hai
 Similarly average skydivers carry far more equipment with safety equipment than in previous years, which is a fairly large part of the cost

 This event is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age in South India, as he set the ideal Hindu kingdom on the backdrop of the expansionist plan of the barbaric Mughal sultans in South India, which later became the inspiration for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Hindu Swarajya

 It is said that Harihar and his brother Bukkaraya, the first ruler of the Vijay Nagar empire, were devotees of Lord Krishna and wanted to destroy unrighteousness and establish religion with their inspiration

 With the efforts of Harihar Rai, Vijayanagara became a state and just as Chandragupta's prime minister was Acharya Chanakya, so did Harihar Rai, the general minister of Vijayanagara empire, Sant Vidyaranya Swamy and the first ruler

 The rulers kept changing and after Harihar I, the reigns of Bukkaray, Harihar II, Devaraya I, Devaraya II, Mallikarjuna and Virupaksha came into the hands of the rulers, but after the separation from the Delhi Sultanate, there was a struggle for the expansion of the Mughals of the Bahmani kingdom

 At the time of this coronation, the Portuguese invaded Goa's Sultan Adilshah to secure their trade in Goa, but Emperor Krishnadeva Raya, with his diplomatic tactics, led the Adilshah, the representatives of the Mughal Sultanate and the fire of war between the Portuguese

 The struggle of Raichur after the coronation year was the most important struggle in the life of Emperor Krishnadeva Raya
 raichur ek surakshit nagar tha
 There was also a strong fort, the desire to conquer it was in the mind of Narasimha, the former ruler of Vijayanagar, because this fort was taken away by Adilshah from the former rulers of Narasimha
 vastut: samraat krishna dev raay kii drushti raichur ke kile ke saath-saath mughal samrajya ko ukhaad phenkane par bhi thi
 Emperor Krishnadeva Raya was very fond of horses
 unhone seede marakar naamak ek mughal ko chalis hajaar sikke dekar goa ke ponda main mughalon se ghode kharidne ke liye bheja, kintu us mughal ne vishwasghaat kiya or ponda ke mughalon ke saath sikke or ghode lekar adilshaah ke rajyashetra main bhaag gaya
 Protecting the culprit of the other state on the basis of the forty-year old treaty of both the states was a violation of the treaty, so Emperor Krishnadeva Raya wrote a letter to Adilshah telling that Cedamarkar should be immediately handed over to Vijayanagara Empire with money, otherwise the result would be terrible
 
 adilshaah ne ahankaar ke kaaran us mughal apradhi ko vijay nagar bhejneke bajaay samraat ko patr likhaa ki kaaji kii salaah ke anusaar seede marakar paigambar ke vesh kaa pratinidhi or kanoon kaa gyaata he, at: use vijaynagar ko nahin saunpa ja saktaa
 The emperor Krishnadeva Raya against this obstinacy attacked Raichur with a huge army of 7,36,000 soldiers
 kootnithik tareeke se baraar, bidar or golkunda ke sultaanon ko unhone adilshaah ke paksh main na bolne ke liye bhi taiyaar kar liya
 These Sultans knew that if we helped Adilshah, we would also have to contend with the wrath of Emperor Krishnadeva
 parinamat: ye sabhi adilshaah ke sahyog main nahin khadey hue jabaki sabhi hindu raajaaon ko unhone krishna nadi ke tat par ek jute karke bijapur kii adilshahi sena par akraman kar diya

 Emperor Krishnadeva Raya organized a splendid celebration in Vijayanagara on this success, in which the Mughal rulers sent their messengers, who were reprimanded by Emperor Krishnadeva Raya

 The military strength of about 10 lakhs, including 32 thousand cavalry and a small cannon and elephants also, showed the military strength of the place
 vijaynagar samrajya apni adarsh hindu jivan style ke liye vishwa-vikhyath tha
 While Maharaja Krishnadeva Raya was a Vaishnavite, he also provided complete religious freedom to not only Indian creeds like Jains, Buddhists, Shaivas, Lingayats but also to indigenous religions like Christians, Jews and Muslims

 The GRE is typically a computer-based test conducted by selected qualified exam centers; However, in areas of the world which lack technical requirements, examinations based on paper are conducted
 graduate skool pravesh prakriya main GRE prapthank par jis str kaa jor diya jaataa he usamen skulon or skulon main vibhaagon ke bheetar vyapak antar paaya jaataa he
 The importance of the GRE score can range from an important selection factor of selection to mere admission formality

 The ETS responded by planning to radically redesign the examination structure starting in the autumn of 2007; However, the company has announced that "plans to introduce a completely new exam were suddenly withdrawn and ETS decided to put new types of questions into practice and progressively improve them over time"
 Since November 2007, new questions have been introduced in practice

 The first section is the written section, while the other three are multiple-choice styles

 The test takers do not know which of the multiple-choice sections is experimental

 a hierarchical multiple-choice clause is always a verbal section, which includes analogy, antonyms, completing sentences, and reading citation
 bahu-vikalp pratikraya khand 10 ank kii vriddhiyon ke saath 200-800 ke paimaane par shreneekrut kiye jate hai
 This section mainly performs vocabulary tests and the average scores in this section are basically lower than the mathematical section
 ek pratirupi pariksha main, is khand main 30 prashn ho sakate hai or is khand ko puraa karne ke liye 30 minute aavantit kiye ja sakate hai
 It usually consists of reading 8–10 questions in relation to antonyms, 6–8 questions of analogy, 5–7 sentence completion questions, and 6–10 reading comprehension questions
 ganitiya khand, anya bahu-vikalp khand main samasya ko hal karne or ucch-vidhyalay str par ganit kii jaanch karne vaale ganitiya tulana sambandhi prashn shaamil ho sakate hai
 Multiple-choice response segments are graded on a scale of 200–800 with increments of 10 points
 ek prati rupi pariksha main, is khand main 28 prashn ho sakate hai or parikshaarthiyon ko is khand ko puraa karne ke liye 45 minute die ja sakate hai
 This section typically consists of 14 mathematical comparison questions, 10 discrete mathematical questions and 4 data representation questions

 The person giving the exam will be able to choose from two subjects, on which subject to write an essay

 The topic topic is selected from a collection of questions

 pariksha dene vaale vyakti ko kathan ke tark par vichaar karne or us kathan ke tark ko behatar banane ke bare main suzav dene ke liye kaha jayega

 The statement is chosen from a collection of topics
 praayogic khand, jo yaa to ek maukhik, ganitiya yaa vishleshnatmak lekhan kaary ho saktaa he, main nae prashn shaamil hai jise ETS bhavishya main upyog ke liye vichaar kar rahaa he
 Although the marks of the experimental section are not included in the marks of the test taker, it is unknown and looks similar to the actual part of the exam
 chunki parikshaarthiyon ke paas yah jaanane kaa koi spasht tarika nahin he ki koun sa khand praayogic he, ve is khand ko puraa karne ke liye baadhya hote hai
 If the experimental section looks like an analytical writing question, if a "subject" question is presented, the choice between the two subjects will not be given
 Coupled with the fact that the true analytical writing section is the first test given, it can help the test taker conclude which section is the experimental section and thus the person giving the test lessens the importance of that section Can do

 The person taking the exam is not allowed to go back and change the answer to previous questions, some have to be answered before the next question is presented
 ek bahu-vikalp khand main die jane vaale pratham prashn ko ek "ausat str" kaa prashn mana jaataa he jiskaa aadhe GRE pariksha dene vaale sahi uttar denge
 yadi prashn sahi dhang se uttar diya jaataa he, to uske baad vaale prashn adhik kathin ho jate hai
 If the question is answered incorrectly, then the questions become more simple
 prashasan ke prati is drushtikon se ve ank praapt hote hai unase utani hi parishuddhta praapt hoti he jitani lagbhag aadhe vishyon kaa prayog karne ke samay hoti he
 However, with GRE this effect is less because it has a fixed length, in fact CAT length is variable, where once the candidate has set the ability level, the exam will be closed automatically
 pariksha ke ank kaa nirdhaaran vishay pratikriya siddhant ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 While CAT is linked to IRT, in reality IRT is used to determine the score for non-cat exams
 GRE vishay kii parikshaayen, jo paaramparik kaagaj-or pencil praaroop ke aadhaar par di jaati he, IRT main ank nirdhaaran kii samaan vidhi kaa prayog karti hai
 The difference provided by CAT is that the subject is selected in a dynamic manner so that the person taking the exam sees only the subjects with appropriate difficulty
 manometiya laabhon ke atirikt, atyadhik kathin yaa saral vishay dekar parikshaarthi ke samay ko barbaad nahin karnaa iskaa ek atirikt laabh he
 This happens in a fixed format exam
 koi parikshaarthi bahu-vikalp khand ke ek yaa adhik prashnon ko chhodkar bhi 800 kaa ek adarsh ank praapt kar saktaa he
 Similarly, if any question is not answered correctly, 200 is still the lowest possible mark
 vartmaan pariksha ke shatamak nimnaankit hai: Comparisons for "intended undergraduate major" are "limited to those who earned their college degrees for two years before the exam date"
 ETS does not provide any marks of marks for "non-traditional students" who have been out of school for more than two years, although its own report "RR-99-16" informs that the examinations in 1996 22% of all individuals with age were over 30 years old

 GRE se us seemaa ko maapne kii apeksha kii jaati he jis seemaa tak purvasnatak shiksha ne kisi vyakti kii shabdic or ganitiya kaushalon ko amoort soch main viksit kiya he
 Like other standardized entrance examinations, the use and importance of GRE scores vary not only from one school to another but also from one department to another and from one course to another

 Admission to graduate schools depends on a complex mix of many different factors
 skulon ke prashasti patr, is uddeshy ke kathan, GPA, GRE ank aadi par vichaar karte hai
 Some schools use the GRE in admissions decisions, but not in funding decisions; Otherwise they use the GRE for selection of scholarships and apprenticeship of candidates, but not for admission
 In some cases, GRE may be a general requirement laid by the university to gain admission to undergraduates, while some special departments may not consider any at all

 The syllabus in which descriptive writing is notable requires the submission of a prepared writing sample that is considered more useful than the analytical writing section in determining writing ability; However, sometimes the writing marks of foreign students are more scrutinized and used as an indicator of overall effort to master and master conversational English

 GMAT graduate management admician test snaatak vyavsaayik adhyayan main shaikshik rup se safal hone ke liye yogyata maapne hetu ganit or angreji bhashaa main ek computer anukuli manakikrut pariksha he
 Vocational schools generally use this test as one of the various selection criteria for admission to MBA courses
 haalanki, kai vyavsaayik skool aise bhi hai jo GRE ankon ko bhi sweekaar karte hai
 Following are some criteria of vocational schools: GMAT dwaara tark shakti par jor dene kii tulana main, GRE parikshaarthiyon kii shabd sangrah main yogyata kaa adhik maapan karata he
 This difference is reflected in the structure of each test
 vishleshnatmak lekhan khand saamaanya hone ke baavjood, GRE main maukhik khand main saadrishyataayen, viparitarthak shabd, vaakyon ko puraa karnaa or bodh ke uddharanon ko padhanaa shaamil hote hai, jabaki GMAT main vaakya shuddhikaran, kathin tarkshakti or uddharanon ko padhanaa shaamil hai
 In addition, the GMAT requires high mathematical ability to score well
 GRE antarrashtriya emb MBA chaatro or ek gaiyr paaramparik prishthbhumi se sambandhit aavedakon ko adhik aakarshith karte hai
 a variety of resources are available to those preparing for the GRE
 panjikaran ho jane par, ETS power prepe naamak ek software pradaan karata he, jisamen puraane prashnon kii abhyaas parikshaon ke do set or atirikt abhyaas prashn evam adhyayan saamagree hoti hai
 Since this software can replicate both the exam format and the questions used, it can be useful in predicting the actual GRE score
 ETS puraane prashnon ke license kisi anya company ko pradaan nahin karata he, jisase vah aadhikarik prayukt saamagree kaa ek maatr strot bana rahata he
 ETS used to publish "BIG BOOK" which included a large number of real GRE questions; However, this publication was discontinued
 kai companiyaan paathyakram, pustaken or anya taiyaari vaali anadhikarik saamagree uplabdh karaati hai
 The ETS has claimed that the content of the GRE is "untraceable"; However, various exam preparation companies such as Kaplan, Princeton Review, IMS Learning Resources, VISU etc
 claim that the exam format is so difficult to familiarize yourself with the organization, timing, specific focus of the exam and the process of removal
 The use of GRE is the best way to increase the score

 pariksha dene vaale vyakti pariksha centre ke kathor niyamon ke bare main shikaayat karte hai
 For example, test takers cannot use a pen or bring their own pieces of paper
 kaagaj or pencil pariksha centre par uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 Food and beverages are prohibited in examination centers as well as chewing gum
 vyaktigat vastuon jaise ki jacketon or tapiyon kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he
 In some places, the candidates are allowed to carry only one fine paper in the examination hall, unless it is made available by the examination center
 However, such rules are relevant not only to the GRE but to all high-risk exams
 aalochakon ne daawa kiya he ki computer anukuli paddati kuch pariksha dene vaale vyaktiyon ko hatotsahit kar sakati hai, kyonki prashn kii kathinaayee nishpaadan ke saath badalati he
 For example, if a test taker is given significantly easier questions in the middle of the exam, they may conclude that they are not doing well, which will affect their ability as the exam continues
 , Even if the difficulty of the question is subjective
 Conversely, standard examination methods may discourage students by initially giving them more difficult subjects
 aalochakon ne yah bhi kaha he aarambh ke kai prashnon par adhik jor dene sambandhi computer anukuli parikshaarthiyon ke khilaaf pakshpatpurna he jo aam taur par pariksha jari rahane ke saath-saath adhik aaramdaayak sthiti main rahane ke purv tanaav yaa bhram kii vajah se pariksha kii shuruyaat main kharaab pradarshan karte hai
 Of course standard fixed-form exams are also said to be "biased" against students who have less power to take the test because they will need twice the time of an equivalent computer length adaptive exam to achieve the same level of precision
 
 anya pravesh parikshaon ke samaan hi GRE bhi jaateey purvaagrah kii aalochanaon ke adheen he
 In 1998, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education noted that in 1996, the average score for black students was 389 in the verbal section, 409 in the mathematical section, and 423 in the analytical section, while the average score for white students was 496, 538 and respectively
 There were 564
 dhyaan den ki keval saamaanya ausat prapthank main antar se purvaagrah ke pramaan nahin milte hai jabatak ki jansankhyaayein kshamtaaon main samaan nahin hon or is baat par jor dena ki samooh ke prapthank main antar ek buree pariksha ke pratyaksh pramaan hai, yah ek charam sthiti he
 a more effective, accepted and empirical approach is the analysis of the penetrating procedure of examination, which examines differences in the object response curve for subgroups; The best approach for this is the DFIT framework
 un chaatro ke prati bhi purvaagrah hota he jinke paas nijee swaamitv vaali pariksha lene vaali kakshaon main shaamil hone ke liye vittiya sansaadhan hote hai
 These classes generally yield better scores; However, many such companies and teachers focus more on how to use the exam format for the benefit of someone and not really because of how to learn the material related to the exam
 gres kii is baat ke liye aalochana kii jaati he ki vah is baat kii maap nahin karata he ki koi chaatr graduate skool main safal hoga yaa nahin
 taffts vishvidhyalay ke robert sternberg ne daawa kiya ki GRE saamaanya pariksha manovigyaan main snaatak adhyayan main safalataa kii durbal pragsuchak thi
 Weak preponderance claims may be related to the mathematics portion of the GRE General Examination because a good foundation of mathematics is important in understanding advanced statistics
 haalanki, manovigyaan kii kuch shakhaon main, aankadon kaa prayog alpatam hota he
 The ETS published a report that states a predictive value of GRE on a student's price index upon graduation
 jaisaa ki maine pehle ullekh kiya, manyata gunank GRE or pehle varsh or samgr snaatak GPA ke bich

 In May 1994, Kaplan Incorporated warned the ETS during a hearing before a New York legislative that the small collection of questions available in a computer adaptive exam was fraudulently vulnerable
 ETS ne jaanchakartaaon ko aashwaasan diya ki yah prashnon ke ekaadhik set kaa upyog kar rahaa tha or pariksha surakshit tha
 It was later found to be incorrect
 disambar 1994 main, chaatro dwaara punaravartit prashnon kii soochna die jane se prerit hokar, kaplan, inkorporate ke purv nideshak or newton ke varttman mukhya kaaryakari adhikari, jose farera ne pariksha lene ke liye 9 america shaharon main tainaat 22 karmchaariyon ke ek dal kaa netritv kiya
 Kaplan, Inc then handed over 150 questions to the ETS expressing 70-80% of the GRE
 According to the initial news release, ETS felt grateful to Stanley H
 Kaplan for identifying the security issue
 haalanki, 31 disambar ko ETS ne ek sangheey electronic sanchaar gopneeyata adhinium, copirite kanoonon, anubandh kaa ulanghan karne or dhokhadhadi ke liye kaplan, inkorporate ke khilaaf mukadmaa daayar kiya or pariksha ke din parikshaarthiyon ke dwaara gopneeyata ke samjhaute par hastakshar kiye gaye
 On 2 January 1995, an agreement was reached outside the court
 iske atirikt, 1994 main, computer anukuli prapatr ke liye ank kalan vidhi ko asurakshit paaya gaya
 The ETS acknowledged that employees at Kaplan, Inc
, led by Jose Ferreira, disavowed key features of the GRE marking algorithm
 Researchers found that an examiner's performance based on a few questions early in the test had an inconsistent effect on the candidate's final score to maintain the accuracy of the score, ETS revised its scores and that now a more sophisticated score calculus Uses the method

 On 2 April 2007 the ETS announced the decision to cancel the plan to amend the GRE
 The announcement, while clarifying the cancellation of the planned change, raised concerns about the ability to provide clear and equal access to the new exam
 However, he stated that he plans to "implement planned improvements to the content of the exam-related content in the future", although exact details regarding those changes have not yet been announced
 GRE main 1 navambar 2007 se parivartan lagu hue kyonki ETS ne pariksha main nae prakaar ke prashnon ko shaamil karnaa shuru kar diya
 parivartan adhikanshat: ganit or shabd sangrah khandon ke liye "rikt sthanon ko bharen" prakaar ke uttaron par kendrit he, jisamen parikshaarthi ko uttaron ke liye bahu-vikalp suchi main se chunane ke bajaay rikt sthaan ko sidhe bharna padataa he
 Currently ETS is planning to introduce two of these new types of questions in each mathematical and vocabulary section, while the majority of questions will be presented in regular format
 janvari, 2008 main, maukhik khand main pathan bodh karnaa ko uddhran ke rup main pun:praroopit kiya gaya he
 In order to "help students easily obtain appropriate information in reading the citations", it will be marked by the examinee to focus on specific information in the quotes

 Raghuvansh is an epic poem composed by Kalidas
 is mahakavy main unniis sargon main raghu ke kul main utpann bees raajaaon kaa ikkis prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog karte hue varnan kiya gaya he
 In it, special descriptions of Dilip, Raghu, Dasaratha, Rama, Kush and Atithi are given
 ve sabhi samaaj main adarsh sthapit karne main safal hue
 Rama is described in this
 unniis main se chah sarg unase hi sambandhit hai
 Adikavi Valmiki composed his Ramayana by making Rama a hero, which many poets and writers of the world followed in their own language and presented the story of Rama in their own way
 kalidas ne yadhyapi ram kii katha rachi parantu is katha main unhone kisi ek paatr ko nayak ke rup main nahin ubhaara
 He composed the story of the entire dynasty in his work 'raghuvansh', which begins with Dileep and ends at Agnivarna
 agnivarn ke maranoparant uski garbhvatee patni ke rajyabhishek ke uparant is mahakavy kii itishree hoti he
 The oldest available commentary on Raghuvansh is that of the 10th-century Kashmiri poet Vallabhadeva
 kintu sarvaadhik prasiddh tikaa mallinath dwaara rachit 'sanjivani' he
 Kalidasa has divided the story of 'raghuvansh' into 19 cantos, in which the stories of Raja Dileep, Raghu, Aj, Dasaratha, Ram, Luv, Kush, Atithi and the later twenty Raghuvanshi kings have been recited
 is vansh kaa patan uske antim raja agnivarn ke vilasita kii ati ke kaaran hota he or yaheen is kriti kii iti bhi hoti he
 The following list of Raghuvanshi kings mentioned in twenty-one cantos is as follows - is katha ke madhyam se kavi kalidas ne raja ke charitra, adarsh tathaa rajdharm jaise vishyon kaa bada sundar varnan kiya he
 There is also a part of this chapter of Suryavansh in the history of India, in which there is a message that on the one hand, fame and fame of the king who maintains the religion is spread all over the country, on the other hand, due to the characterless king, there is certain loss and descent, Even if he is a descendant of any higher lineage! samalochakon ne kalidas kaa sarvshereshth mahakavy 'raghuvansh' ko mana he
 From the beginning to the end, the singular skill of the accomplished poet is expressed in it
 dilip or sudakshina ke tapomay jivan se prarambh is kavy main kramash: raghuvanshi raajaaon kii vadanyata, veerta, tyaag or tap kii ek ke baad ek kahani udghaatit hoti he or kavy kii samaapti kaamuk agnivarn kii vilasita or unke avsaan se hoti he
 Dilip and Sudakshina's tenacity: the demeanor, the dialogue of Kautas and Raghu, the disciples of Varatantu, the picture of Indumati Swayamvara, Ajavilapa, the voyage of Rama and Sita, the glory of exiled Sita, the confluence, the emptiness of the city of Ayodhya, etc
 And the reader looks at them with an amused look
 anek kathankon kaa ekatrikaran hone par bhi is mahakavy main kavi ne unka ek duusare se ek prakaar samanvay kar diya he jisase unamem swaabhaavik pravaah kaa sanchaar ho gaya he
 In this lit Nakshatramala of many nappies of 'raghuvansh', the poet has given Tejavita and dignity to the glorious Rama of Adikavi Valmiki
 varnanon kii sajivta, aagat prasargon kii swaabhaaviktaa, style kaa maadhurya tathaa bhav or bhashaa kii drushti se 'raghuvansh' sanskritmahakavyon main anupam he
 The style of the Raghuvansha epic is simple and not prashanti, simple and prasadagunmayi
 alankaaron kaa suruchipurna prayog swaabhaavik evam sahaj sundar he
 In the selected words, the poet has taken the wonderful trick of showing the beauty of the favored object in the thirteenth canto of 'raghuvansh', with a beautiful tableau of the subject
 ganga or yamuna ke sangam kii, unke mishrit jal ke pravaah kii chata kaa varnan karte samay ek ke baad ek upamaaon kii shrunkhlaa upasthit karte hue ant main kavi ne shiv ke sharir ke saath-saath uski shobhaa kii upama di he or is prakaar saundarya ko seemaa se nikaalkar anant ke haathon saunp diya- Kalidas is an expressive poet of mainly gentle and delightful expressions
 isiilie prakruti kaa komal, manoram or madhur paksh unki is kriti main bhi ankit hua he
 In the beginning of Raghuvansh poetry, Mahakavi has given many types of delightful sermons for pranamatras on the pretext of describing the importance and merit of the kings of Raghukul
 raghuvansh kavy main kalidas ne raghuvanshi raajaaon ko nimitt banaakar udarcharit purushon kaa swabhaav pathakon ke sammukh rakhaa he
 If you want to know the description of Raghuvanshi kings in a nutshell, then in one verse of Raghuvansh, its result is as follows- ) The story of 'raghuvansh' begins with Dilip and his wife Sudakshina's entry into the ashram of sage Vasistha
 raja dilip dhanwaan, gunwan, budhimaan or balavaan he, saath hi dharmaparayan bhi
 They are rich in every way, but there is a shortage of children
 santan prapti kaa aashirwad paane ke liye dilip ko gomata nandini kii seva karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 As usual, Nandini is wandering in the forest and Dileep also walks along to guard her
 itane main ek singh nandini ko apana bhojan bananaa chahta he
 Dilip dedicates himself and begs Singh to make him his diet
 singh prarthana sweekaar kar letaa he or unhen maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 With this leap, the lion disappears
 tab nandini bataati he ki usee ne dilip kii pariksha lene ke liye yah mayajaal rachaa tha
 Nandini is pleased with Dilip's service and blesses her son's attainment
 raja dilip or sudakshina nandini kaa doodh grahan karte hai or unhen putr ratna kii prapti hoti he
 This talented son is named Raghu, due to his might, this dynasty is known as Raghuvansh
 raghu ke parakram kaa varnan kalidas ne vistaarpurvak apane granth ‘raghuvansh’ main kiya he
 On stealing the horse of Ashwamedha Yagya, he fought with Indra and had rescued him
 unhone vishwajit yajna sampann karke apana sara dhan daan kar diya tha
 When he had no money, one day Rishiputra Kauts came and asked him for 14 crores gold coins so that he could give his Guru Dakshina
 raghu ne is brahman ko santusht karne ke liye kuber par chadhai karne kaa man banaaya
 On receiving this information, Kuber panicked and filled his treasure by himself
 raghu ne sara khazaana brahman ke hawaale kar diya; parantu us brahmanputra ne keval 14 karod mudraaen hi sweekaari
 Raghu's son Aj was also very powerful
 unhone vidarbha kii rajkumaari indumati ke swayamvar main jaakar unhen apni patni banaaya
 Kalidasa has beautifully described this swayamvara in 'raghuvansh'
 raghu ne aj kaa raaj-kaushal dekhakar apana singhaasana unhen saunp diya or vanprastha le liya
 Like Raghu, Aja also became a skilled king
 ve apni patni indumati se bahut prem karte the
 Once Naradji was pleased and wandering in the sky with his veena
 sanyogvash unki vina kaa ek phool tutaa or bageeche main saiyr kar rahi rani indumati ke sir par gira jisase unki mrityu ho gai
 Raja Aj became upset at Indumati's disconnection and finally took water-tomb
 kalidas ne ‘raghuvansh’ ke aath sargon main dilip, raghu or aj kii jeevani par prakaash daalaa
 Later he described the story of Dasaratha, Rama, Luv and Kush in eight cantos
 jab ram lanka se laut rahe the, tab pushp vimaan main baithi sita ko dandakarany tathaa panchvati ke un sthanon ko dikhaa rahe the jahaan unhone sita kii khoj kii thi
 Kalidas has a very beautiful and poignant illustration of this in the thirteenth canto of 'raghuvansh'
 is sarg se pataa chalata he ki kalidas kii bhugolic jaankaree kitni gahan thi
 Ayodhya's earlier fame and present situation has been described by the poet very skillfully in the sixteenth canto through the dream of Kush
 antim sarg main raghuvansh ke antim raja agnivarn ke bhoga-vilaas kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 The culmination of the king's boast is that when the public comes to see the king, Agnivarna spreads his feet outside the window
 janata ke anadar kaa parinaam rajya kaa patan hota he or is prakaar ek pratapi vansh kii iti bhi ho jaati he
 Kalidas knew that the story of Rama had flourished from Valmiki's Ramayana, and whatever would be written after that would be confused
 isiilie unhone apane kavy main ram ko nayak banane kii bajaay raghuvansh ko hi kathanayake ke rup main prastut kiya; jisamen sabhi paatro kii apni-apni bhoomika rahi- apane-apane charitra ke aadhaar par xxrep 4 
 kuch utkarsh to kuch ghatiya
 The name of Raghuvansh will continue to be in the name of their mighty and ideal kings
 uparyukt jaankaree kalidas ke mahakavy raghuvansh ke anusaar he kintu raghuvansh naam padane ke pehle is vansh kaa naam 'ikshvaku vansh' tha
 According to Valmiki Ramayana, the entire lineage of the Ikshvaku dynasty is as follows in the marriage context of Rama in Valmiki Ramayana
 is mahakavy main 21 prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog hua he: 1 Manu 2 • Ikshvaku 3 • Shashad 4 • Kakutastha 5 • Anenus 6 • Prithu 7 • Vishwagashvara Humid 8 • Yuvnashtha 9 • Shravasta 10 • Vrihashvara 11 • Kuvalayashva 11 • Perseverance 12 • Pramod 13 • Harishrava 14 • Nikumbha 15 • Samhitashv 16 • Krishna 17 • Prasenjit 18 • Yuvnasht 19 • Mandhatu 20 • Purukutsa 21 • Trusadasu 22 • Sambhut 23 • Ananya 24 • Parashvadesh 25 • Hariyashrava 26 • Vasumanas 27 • Trudhanavan 28 • Triyaruna 29 • Hung 30 • Harishchandra 31 • Rohit 32 • Green 33 • Chanchu 34 • Vijay 35 • Ruruk 36 • Vrika 37 • Bahu 38 • Sagar 39 • Asamjus 40 • Anshuman 41 • Dilip 42 • Bhagirath 43 • Shrut 44 • Srut 45 • Part 46 • Umbarish 47 • Sindhudip 48 • Ayatyus 49 • Rituparna 50 • Sarvakam 51 • Sudas 52 • Kalmashapad 53 • Ashmak 54 • Moolik 55 • Shatratha 56 • Vriddhasharman 57 • Vishwas Sah 58 • Dilip 2 58 • Long-lived 60 • Raghu • Aj 61 • Dasharatha 62 • Ramachandra • nachiketa, vaidic yug ke ek tejasvi rishibalak the
 His story is available in Taitriya Brahmin and Kathopanishad and Mahabharata
 unhone bhautik vastuon kaa parityag kiya tathaa yama se aatma or brahm vishay par gyaan praapt kiya
 Nachiketa was the son of Vajashrava Rishi who performed the "vishvajit" Yajna, the Dakshinavasa Dakshinavala
 karanvash rusht hokar pita ne putr ko yamalok main jane kaa shaap diya
 Nachiketa received three graces from Yama, the most important of which was the preaching of spiritualism
 nachiketa kaa yah aakhyaan mahabharat ke anushaasan parv main tathaa varah puraana main bhi taatpary bhed se uplabdh hota he
 In a later period, this narrative was developed as a nasiketopakhyana in which a specific change of the original Vedic tale is targeted, its short-lived narrative translated by Sadal Mishra into Hindi prose
 vajashravas raja ek baar vishvajit yajna karke dakshinaswaroop sab dhan daan kar rahe the
 Child Nachiketa used to persistently ask me to donate it to anyone
 atev pita ne kupit hokar kaha ki ja tuje yama ko diya
 Satyapalak Bajashravas later sent him to Yamasadan
 yama ke paas nachiketa ne brahmavidya sikhi
 Although Yama gave him many temptations before he preached spiritualism, Nachiketa remained firm on his goal
 ant main yama ne sarvadukh se mukt karne vaale parmatm-vishay main uske samast andeh dur kar use gudh gyanopadesh diya evam anek ratnamalas pradaan kin
 New poets have touched this legend as a symbol

 Along with this, they also help in the regular army operations
 chhapamaron kaa lakshya sainik hi nahin rahete
 They also damage rail, traffic, logistics, bridges and other such means, which can hamper regular army operations of enemies
 chhapamar yudhon ke liye teen pramukh vastuen hai
 The first is the territory suitable for the work of the partisan, the second political stage and three things are national conditions
 is prakaar ke kaary ke liye sabase ati upyukt pahari bhoomi hoti he, jisamen jangal ho, athwa aisa hi bhukhand jo jangalon or daldalon se bharaa ho
 Knowledge of irregular methods used by the guerrillas is necessary to protect them from guerrilla warfare so that their efforts are immediately destroyed by cooperative efforts
 ek or vishesh upyogi vidhi us kshetra ko gher lenaa he jisamen chhapamar vishram karte hai
 In the First World War, there were long confrontations in Europe
 chhapamaron ke liye ye kshetra vishesh aakarshak nahin kintu san 1916-18 kaa arab kaa vidroh to bilkul aniyamit tha

 The raids carried out by Laurence in collaboration with the Arab army are notable
 madhyapurv ke tukon kii do durbalataayen thim pratham to janata athwa arabon ke bich kii ashaanti or dwitiya turk samrajya ko niyantrit karanevaali bhanjansheel or durbal sanchaar vyavastha
 Laurence and his supporting Arabs cut off the railway lines, escaping from the Ottoman strongholds, harassing the Turks from invasions and preventing them from advancing
 ab duusari ore se jordan main sthit niyamit angreji sena ne pramukh turk sena par akraman kar diya
 Here Laurence, with the help of his army, severed this Turkish army from other armies
 larens kii safalataa ke kaaran the uski sena kii gatishiltaa, bahya sahaayta, samay or janamat, jisase nagarikon kii sahaayta praapt ho saki
 The guerrillas thus got victory

 The Japanese attacked the Chinese

 The Chinese received arms and ammunition from the US
 jisaki sahaayta se inhone shatru sena ko ek lambey kaal tak bahut pareshaan kiya or chote chote sainik dalon ko mukhya sena se alag karke nasht kar diya
 a wide area was found for raiding in the Second World War
 europe main germanon kii or dakshini-purvi asia main japaniyon kii vijay itani tivrata se or itane vistrut kshetra main hui ki vijit kshetron main shashan kaa acha prabandh na ho sakaa
 As soon as the soldiers conquered one place, they were suddenly ordered to move forward
 vijit kshetra chote chote sainik dalon ke adhikaar main chhod dene pade
 These areas became ideal sites for raiding and soon the scattered communication areas of the enemy parties were successfully destroyed
 uttari africa main italy kii senaaon ne prarambh main bade bade kshetron par adhikaar kar liya or vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko buree tarah kuchal diya
 Public opinion here was opposite to Italy
 angarejon ne is bhaavana kaa laabh uthaaya or vahaan ke muulavaasiyon kii sahaayta se safaltaapurvak chhapamar yudhon kaa sanchaar kiya
 Communication systems of Italian military squads, airports, petrol, ammunition stores, motor traffic, etc
 were spread from Benghazi to Egypt
 upyukt shastron se sajjit paidal sena yaa jeepen in chhapamar sainikon ke liye vishesh upyukt thim
 Guerrillas used to attack enemy targets at night
 san 1941 ke vasant main germanon ne yugoslavia par adhikaar kar liya
 Soon after the country was authorized, the people there formed a guerrilla team headed by Josip Vrozovic who worked against the enemy army
 shastron kii aavashyaktaa kii purti vahaan kii janata se, yaa shatrudal se chhine hue shastron se, hoti thi
 They received munitions by attacking the troops and their bases in Germany and Italy
 safalataa ke saath saath inaki sankhya main bhi vruddhi hui
 By the end of 1943, the number increased to around 1,50,000
 yah shakti yugoslavia bhar main faili hui thi or vishesh rup se jangalon or pahaado main sthit thi
 Communication was carried out as far as possible by radio sets snatched from the enemy party
 yugoslavia ke is dal kaa uddeshy shatru ke un sampann lakshyon par akraman karnaa tha jo durbal the or jahaan akraman hone kii sabase kam apeksha kii jaati thi
 Apart from this, at any stage they did not want to give such an opportunity that the enemies could retaliate against them
 tito ke pakshaavlambee pradaay, aashray or soochna ke liye nagarikon par ashrith the
 Civil behavior is of utmost importance in all partisan wars
 nagarikon ne chhapamaron ko jo sahaayta di thi uskaa dand unhen bhugatna padaa
 Thousands of men, women and children were killed
 hajaaron gaanv lut liye gaye or jalaakar dhwast kar die gaye
 In a period of three years, the enemy attacked seven times to destroy the guerrillas and also resorted to the Air Force, but each time Tito's counterpart survived somehow and the axis reappeared to attack the nation at such a place
 Where his attack could not be expected
 aadhunik vayusena or chhapamaron ke sahyog se kya parinaam nikal sakate hai, yugoslavia iskaa pramaan he
 The attack of the guerrillas on the communication system of the enemy has an important place in the success of the Russians
 janata se sambadh rakhane se unhen germanon ke addon or unki sena kii gatividhi kii soochna milane kaa vi·st saadhan praapt ho gaya
 Their mobility, knowledge of locations, unexpected invasions and the withdrawal of individual troops from the battlefield became a means to confuse and harass the enemy
 san 1941 i

 This created major problems for both England and the United Nations
 yudhakshetra ab bahut vistrut ho gaya or yuddh ke pehle prakram main itani lambii pratiraksha pankti ke liye aavashyak vastuon kaa prabandh karnaa asambhav sa ho gaya
 United Nations General Douglas macarthur, appointed in the Philippine, had lived in that area for many years
 unhone japaniyon ke viruddh chhapamar sena kii vyavastha kii
 He scattered several small teams of officers in this island
 ye adhikari is kshetra se bhalee bhanti parichit the
 Their job was to escape from the Japanese army to conduct raids
 pravidhik sanchaar aadi main daksh vyaktiyon ko milakar prayek dal main adhik se adhik 15 vyakti hote the
 Their main function was to receive and transmit secret news
 inkaa doosraa kaary tha desh main sthapit japani niyantran main baadha daalana
 After the spread of these parties, there was difficulty in arranging mutual communication among the parties
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye chhapamaron ne janata ke chote radio seton se kaam liya
 Later in 1942, a direct radio connection of the partisan troops was established with General macarthur's main office in Australia
 sheeghra hi sabamerine bhejne kii niyamit vyavastha ho gai or april 1944 tak sabhi bade dwipon kaa general macarthar se radio sampark sthapit ho gaya
 It was soon planned to launch forces on various islands
 ab chhapamaron ke kaary gupt soochna praapt karnaa or sanyukt raashtra sena ke liye lakshya dhoondhna rah gaya
 Thus the espionage operations carried out by the guerrillas helped General macarthur to revive the region and plan his actions
 farvari, 1943 i
 main general aaden si
 winget khachcharon or belon dwaara, 3,000 sainikon ke saath chindbin or irawadi nadiyaan paar karke burma main sthit japani senaaon ke prishthbhag main pahunch gaye
 Here they spoiled the Japanese communication system, destroyed weapons stores and obstructed the Japanese invasion of India
 adhik bheetar tak janevaale inke dalon ko, jo chindwin ke naam se jane jate the, sanchaarvyavastha ke liy vayuyanon dwaara radio set die gaye
 In the same year, the British combined the Ketchins in Burma for raiding
 unhen radio seton ke prayog ke liye prashikshan diya gaya tha
 In order to enable these people to stay longer behind the enemy army, a supportive environment was also created in that area
 duusare vi·yuddh ke pashchaat malaya, hindchin aadi asian desh bhi chhapamari ke liye achche kshetra ban gaye
 In June 1950, the conflict in Korea became widespread in which the raid against the regular army equipped with very modern weapons proved to be very effective
 yahan samyavaadee chhapamaron ko apane se shreshth shaktiyon se apane ko bachaane kii shiksha di gai thi
 Special emphasis was given to the swift retreat by small contingents, rapid retreat, scatter and regroup
 chhapamari ke mukhya ang the sidhaa akraman or chhipakar akraman
 Towns with population ranging from 10 thousand to 20 thousand continued to be attacked till 1956 AD
 aakraamak dalon main 50 se 300 tak vyakti rahete the
 The attack was done with the help of two teams in chronological order
 pehali tukdi aakraamak kshetra main pahunchati or apane kaary kii purti karke teetar bitar ho jaati
 At the time of the second troop's escape, the first troop would protect him
 lautnaa sadaiv kisi anya maarg se hota, jo pahaado se yaa kisi badi nadi ko paar hokar rahata tha
 The enemy side was also harassed for war and propaganda, leading to the moral collapse of the enemy
 yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chhapamar yuddh ke siddhant aaj bhi vahi hai jo yuddh ke aarambhik samay main the
 Even today the guerrillas move at a rapid pace, cheating and attacking the enemy where they are most vulnerable
 saath hi ve shatru ko pratyakraman karne kaa avasar bhi nahin dete
 Along with the vulnerability of the weapons, equipment, military installations etc
 used in the war, with the help of which rapid attack or interception is possible, the area of guerrillas is also increasing
 saath hi aadhunik yudhvidhiyon main bhi is prakaar ke yuddh kaa mahatv bad gaya he
 All plans for enemy attack can be thwarted by the destruction of well-defined targets and essential chains of warfare
 bhugolic paristhitiyaan bhi apana vishesh mahatv rakhti hai or chhapamari ke liye suvidhajanak kaaryakshetra atyant aavashyak he
 The early escalation of collisions in the Second World War increased the chances of the guerrillas entering the enemy army and at some places even the regular army troops reached the background of the enemy
 ab to chhapamaron or nagarikon ke sahyog se kiye ja sakanevaale chhapamari ke kaaryon kaa kshetra atyant vishaal ho gaya he
 In these types of wars, it has become mandatory to get the help and good wishes of the public
 radio or vimaan, in do avishkaron ne chhapamar yuddh main kranti laa di
 Where the path opened for the guerrillas to get help from these means, these tools also started to be used to chase them
 phir bhi inamen haani kii apeksha laabh adhik hua
 Earlier, the guerrillas were rarely able to get news of their partners, but now with the help of small portable senders, they got the facility to contact their partners at will
 phir vayuyanon, dwaara chapa tathaa anya sabhi prakaar kii aniyamit senaaon ko utaarne, unhen lene, unki shakti ko sudrudh banane or pradaay tathaa samrik mahatv kii anya vastuon ko unhen uplabdh karaane kaa bhi kaary sampann hone laga
 The main task of the guerrillas is to destroy the material that the enemy forces get from their back
 aanvik shastron ke vikaas ko dekhte hue samrik niti badalegi
 The armies will divide into small contingents
 pradaay stroton, yuddh aadhaaron, udyogon tathaa anya samrik vyavastha kaa vikendrikaran karnaa aavashyak hoga
 Consequently, if molecular power is used, the guerrillas will become smaller in size and more conserving
 parinaam yah hoga ki chhapamari kaa kshetra vishaal or adhik prabhavi ban jaayga
 The regular army will also fight in small squads
 in paristhitiyon main chhapamar yuddh hi vishesh safal ho sakenge
 It would not be unfair to say that guerrilla warfare will be of major importance only when the use of nuclear weapons in war and other methods will remain in common use
