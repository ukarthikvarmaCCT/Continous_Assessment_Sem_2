 ali ne yuddh main kai anya makka sainikon ko bhi haraa diya
 According to Muslim traditions, Ali killed between twenty-five enemies in battle, mostly agreeing with the Seventh; While all other Muslims jointly killed another seventh

 He had a special role to protect Muhammad when most of the Muslim army fled the battle of Uhud and was told "there is no brave youth except Ali and no sword who serves except Zulfiqar
 " vah khabar kii ladaai main muslim sena ke commander the
 After this war, Mohammed named Ali Asadullah, meaning "lion of God"
 ali ne 630 main hunain kii ladaai main mohammad kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Muhammad named 'ali as one of the scribes who would write the text of the Quran, which was revealed to Muhammad during the last two decades
 jaise hi islam puure arab main failana shuru kar diya, ali ne nae islamic aadesh kii sthapana main madad kii
 He was instructed in 628 to write a peace treaty between Muhammad and the Quraysh to Huddabiyyah
 ali itane bharosemand or bharosemand the ki mohammad ne unhen sandesh le jane or aadesh ghoshit karne ke liye kaha tha
 In 630, Ali recounted at a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca that a portion of the Quran that Muhammad and the Islamic community were not bound by the earlier agreement with Arab polytheists
 630 main makka kii vijay ke dauraan, mohammad ne ali se yah guarantee dene ke liye kaha ki vijay khooni hogi
 He ordered Ali to dismantle all the idols worshiped by the people of Banu Aus, Banu Khajraj, Tayi and Kaaba after their defilement from pre-islamic era polytheism

 After comparing Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation, Muhammad called them Mubhala, where each party brought its knowledgeable men, women and children, and ask Allah to curse the lying party and their followers 
 mohammad, unhen sabit karne ke liye ki vah ek bhavishyadvaktaa tha, ne apni beti fatima, ali or uske pote hasan or hossain ko laayaa
 He went to the Christians and said "this is my family" and covered himself and his family with a cloak
 muslim sroton ke mutabik, jab ek isai bhikshuon ne apane chehre dekhe, to unhone apane saathi ko salaah di ki ve apane jivan or pariwaron ke liye mubahaalaa se waapas aaen
 Thus the Christian monks disappeared from Mubhala place
 allameh tababatei tafaseer al-mizaan main bataati hai ki is kavita main "hamaara khud" shabd mohammad or ali ko sanderbhit karata he
 Then he describes how Imam Ali al-rida, the eighth Shia Imam, in discussion with al-mamun, the Abbasid Caliph, mentions this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's lineage to the rest of the Muslim community, and calls it The evidence is believed to be due to Ali's making of Ali as Muhammad, for Ali's right to the Caliphate
 chunki mohammad 632 main apni aakhri tirthayatra se laut rahe the, unhone ali ke bare main bayaan die jinhen sunnis or shiyas ne bahut alag tareeke se vyakhya kii he
 They halted the caravan at Gadir Khum, gathered the returning pilgrims for communal prayer and began addressing them
 islam ke vishwakosh ke anusaar: The Shia consider these headquarters as the designation of Ali as Muhammad's successor and first imam; In contrast, Sunnis only take him as an expression of the close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherits his family responsibilities upon his death, but must
 Not that his post was a political right many Sufis regard this episode as a transfer of Muhammad's spiritual power and authority to Ali
 Understand that they regard as the Valley overall excellence

 After Muhammad's death another part of Ali's life began in 632 and the third caliph 'uthman ibn' Afan in 656
 The murder went on
 un 24 varshon ke dauraan, ali ne na to kisi bhi yuddh yaa vijay main bhaag liya, na hi unhone koi kaaryakari pad sambhala
 He withdrew from political affairs, especially after the death of his wife Fatima Zahra
 unhone apane parivaar kii seva karne or ek kisaan ke rup main kaam karne ke liye apana samay istemaal kiya
 Ali opened several wells and planted gardens near Medina and endowed them for public use
 in kuon ko aaj abar ali ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Ali compiled a complete version of the Quran, Musaf, six months after Muhammad's death
 madina ke anya logon ko dikhaane ke liye wolum puraa ho gaya tha or oont dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The order of this mushaf differed from that which was later gathered during the Uthmanic era
 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar
 umr ne raajnneetik muddon ke saath-saath dharmik logon main ali ke sujhaavon kaa istemaal kiya
 'ali was one of the electoral council to elect a third caliph appointed by Omar
 haalanki 'ali do pramukh ummidavaaron main se ek tha, parishad kii vyavastha unke khilaaf thi
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai
 The common man, the poor, clearly the less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam


 more friendly with them and securing their confidence and sympathy
 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership

 Main article: Ali ibn Abi Talib and Alawi's descendants initially married Fatima, his dearest wife

 He had four children with Fatima, Hasan ibn Ali, Hussain ibn Ali, Zainab Bint Ali and Umm Kulthum Bint Ali
 unke anya jane-maane bete al-abbaas ebn ali the, jo fatima binate hijaam or mohammad ebn al-hanafiyah ke liye paidaa hue the
 Muhammad ibn al-hanafiyyah was from the Hanifa dynasty of central Arabia, another wife, Ali's son named Khawala bint Jafar
 fatima kii maut ke baad, ali ne bani hanipha janajati ke khawala bint jafar se vivaah kiya
 Hassan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and occupied the Khalifa's outward work for nearly six months

 Hussain, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam
 vah muaayah dwaara daman or utpeedan kii gambhir paristhitiyon main rahete the
 On the tenth day of Muharram of the year 680, he stood in front of the Khalifa's army with his small band of followers and nearly all were killed in the Battle of Karbala

 The death of the last is suspected

 His daughter Zainab — who was in Karbala — was captured by Yazid's army and later played a large role in revealing what happened to Hussein and his followers
 fatima dwaara ali ke vanshajon ko sharif, kahaniyaan yaa kahaniyon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 These are venerable titles in Arabic, Sharif means 'great' and is said or said or 'god' or 'sir'
 mohammad ke ekmaatr vansh ke rup main, unhen sunni or shiya donon kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation
 druj, ek samadharmi dharm, maanate hai ki bhagwaan tha avatarit manushya main vishesh rup se, al-hakim bi-amr allaah ali ke vanshaj
 See also: Historiography of early Islam The primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Quran and Ahmadi, along with other texts of early Islamic history
 vyapak madhyamik sroton main, sunni or shia musalamaanon, isai arabon, hinduon or madhya purv or asia ke anya gaiyr-musalamaanon ke lekhan or aadhunik pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kuch kaaryon ke alaava, shaamil hai
 However, some of the earliest Islamic sources are colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali
 in kathanon ke khilaaf pehle pashchimi vidwaanon ke bich ek aam pravriti rahi thi or baad main sunni or shia pakshpatpurna padon kii pravriti ke kaaran baad kii avadhi main ekatrit reportein huin; baad main banaavat ke rup main unke bare main aise vidwaan
 This led him to consider some of the reported programs as informal or irrelevant
 ebn isaac jaise itihaas ke shuruaati compilers dwaara isnaad ke bina report kiye gaye khaaton ke munaafe ke dauraan leone kaitani ne ebn abbaas or aisha ko aitihaasik reporton kii visheshta mana
 Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of blindly dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and there is no evidence for a late origin to the trend alone in this approach
 unke anusaar, kaitani kaa drushtikon asangat he
 Madelung and some later historians do not reject narratives compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with events and figures
 abbasid khaliphot ke udai tak, kuch kitaaben likhi gayi or adhikansh report maukhik thim
 The previous most notable work of this period is the book of Sulem ibn Qays, written by Sulem ibn Qays, who was one of Ali's companions who lived before Abbasid
 jab muslim samaaj ke liye paper pesh kiya gaya tha, 750 or 950 ke bich kai monograph likhe gaye the
 According to Robinson, at least twenty one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin

 Shia works written after the 10th century are about the biographies of fourteen Inflables and twelve Imams
 is kshetra main sabase purana jivit kaam or sabase mahatvapurn kaaryon main se ek shaikh mufid dwaara kitaab al-irshaad he
 The author has devoted the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali
 manakib naamak kuch kitaaben bhi hai jo dharmik drushtikon se ali ke charitra kaa varnan karti hai
 Such works also constitute a kind of historiography
 bhagirath maanjhi jharkhand kshetra main andalanon ke praneta tilka maanjhi ke putr the

 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu

 After the death of his mother at the age of five years, the child Sakharam was brought up with his Vidyanuragini aunt who was well acquainted with Marathi literature

 Along with studying Vedas in childhood, Sakharam also learned Bengali

 In 1894, there was an English magistrate named Hard in Deoghar
 uske anyaay or atyaachaar se janata pareshaan thi
 Deusker wrote several articles against him in a letter titled Hitwadi to be published from Calcutta, which resulted in Hard threatening to expel Deuskar from his school job
 uske baad deuskar ji ne adhyaaapak kii naukari chhod di or kalakatta jaakar hitvaadi akhbaar main pruf reader ke rup main kaam karne lage

 The basic concern of his overall thinking and writing was the complete independence of the country

 Psychosis is a state of mental health of a person that is not called 'normal' when compared to a healthy person
 swasth vyaktiyon kii tulana main manorogon se grast vyaktiyon kaa vyavhaar asaamaanya athwa duranukuli nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he or jisamen mahatvapurn vyathaa athwa asamarthta antargrast hoti he
 They are also called psychiatric, mental illness, mental illness or mental disorder
 manorog mastishk main rasinic asantulan kii vajah se paidaa hote hai tathaa inke upachaar ke liye manorog chikitsa kii jarurat hoti he
 In psychology, unusual and inappropriate behavior for us is called psychosis
 ye dhire-dhire badhate jate hai
 There are many factors of psychosis, including heredity, weak personality, lack of tolerance, childhood experiences, stressful situations and inability to cope with them
 ve sthitiyaan, jinhen hal kar paanaa evam unka saamana karnaa kisi vyakti ko mushkil lagata he, unhen 'tanaav ke kaarak' kehete hai
 Stress imposes such requirements and demands on a person, which he considers extremely difficult and difficult to fulfill
 in maangon ko puraa karne main lagaataar asafalataa milane par vyakti main maansik tanaav paidaa hota he
 In today's time, stress has become a very common experience for people, which is expressed by a lot of physical and psychological reactions
 tanaav kii paaramparik paribhaasha daihik pratikriya par kendrit he
 Hans Shale discovered the term 'stress' and defined it as an uncertain response based on any body requirement
 hens style kii paribhaasha kaa aadhaar daihik he or yah hormones kii kriyaaon ko adhik mahatv detii he, jo adrinal or anya granthiyon dwaara sravit hote hai
 Shale conceptualized two types of tensions - tanaav par naveen upaagam vyakti ko uplabdh samyoji sansadhano ke sambandh main sthiti ke moolyankan evam vyakhya kii bhoomika par kendrit he
 Interdependent processes of evaluation and adjustment determine the relationship between the environment of the individual and his adaptation
 anukulan vah prakriya he jis ke dwaara vyakti daihik, manovaigyanik or saamaajik hit ke ishtatam str ko banaae rakhane ke liye apane aasapaas kii sthitiyaan evam vaataavaran ko vyavasthit karata he
 When faced with stressful situations, the person usually adopts problem-focused or emotion-focused diplomacy
 samasya kendrit niti dwaara vyakti apane baudwik saadhaanon ke prayog se tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa samaadhaan dhundta he or praayah ek prabhaavshaalee samaadhaan kii ore pahunchataa he
 When faced with stressful situations with an emotion-focused strategy, the person displays emotional behavior such as shouting
 yadhyapi, yadi koi vyakti tanaav kaa saamana karne main asamarth hota he tab vah pratirohak-abhivinyast kootneeti kii ore rujhaan kar letaa he, yadi ye barbar apanaae jaaen to vibhinn manovikar utpann ho sakate hai
 Resistant-oriented behavior does not make it able to face the situation, it is only a means to justify its actions
 shaareerik samasyaayein jaise fever, khaansee, zukam ityadi ye vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar hote hai
 The list of psychologists in these classes ranges from minimal anxiety to severe psychosis such as dementia or fragmented mentality
 america manovikari sangh dwaara manovikaron par naidanik or sankhyikeey niyam pustak ) ko prakashit kiya gaya he jis main vividh prakaar ke maansik vikaron kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 The branch of psychology that seeks solutions to disorders is called abnormal psychology
 ye jaan kar shaayad aapako aashcharya ho ki bachche bhi manovikaron kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 The fourth version of the DSM, which seeks to address a wide variety of childhood disorders, is usually first identified in infancy, childhood, or adolescence
 in main se kuch saavdhaan-abhaav atisakriy vikaar paae jate hai jisamen baccha saavdhaan yaa ekagra nahin rahata yaa vah atyadhik furtila vyavhaar karata he
 And autism disorder in which the child becomes introverted, does not smile at all and learns language late
 yadi koi vyakti bina kisi vishesh kaaran ke daraa hua, bhaybheet yaa chintaa mahasoos karata he to kaha ja saktaa he ki vah vyakti vyagrata vikaar se grast he
 There are different types of anxiety disorder in which anxiety is manifested in various forms
 inamen se kuch vikaar kisi cheez se atyant or tarkarahit dar ke kaaran hote hai or jununee-badhyakaari vikaar jahaan koi vyakti barbar ek hi baat sochataa rahata he or apni kriyaaon ko doharaata he
 Individuals who suffer from experiences of mood disorder have their moods restricted for a long period of time, those individuals settle on one emotion, or switch between these categories of emotions
 udhaaharan swaroop chaahe koi vyakti kuch dinon tak udhaas rahe yaa kisi ek din udhaas rahe or duusare hi din khush rahe, us ke vyavhaar kaa paristhiti se kuch sambandh na ho
 In this way there are two types of mood disorders dependent on the behavioral symptoms of the person - avsaad aisi maansik avasthaa he jo ki udaasi, ruchi kaa abhaav or pratidin kii kriyaaon main prasannataa kaa abhaav, ashaant nidra va neend ghat janaa, kam bhukh laganaa, vajan kam ho naa, yaa zyada bhukh laganaa va vajan badhanaa, aalas, doshi mahasoos karnaa, ayogyata, asahaayta, niraashaa, ekaagratha sthapit karne main pare shaani or apane va dusron ke prati nakraatmak vichaardhaara ke lakshanon ko darshaati he
 If such a person stays at such a price for a minimum of two weeks, he can be said to be depressive and it is necessary to provide him prompt clinical treatment for his treatment
 aaj ke samay main kuch bimaariyaan bahut hi saadhaaran ban chuki hai jaise nimna raktchaap, ucch raktchaap, madhumeh aadi
 Although they are all physical diseases, but they arise from psychological reasons like stress and anxiety
 atah manodaihik vikaar ve manovaigyanik samasyaayein hai jo shaareerik lakshan darshaatin hai, lekin iske kaaran manovaigyanik hote he
 At the same time, in the concept of psychosomatic, the meaning of mind is manas and somatic means body
 iske vipareet daihikroop vikaar, ve vikaar hai jinke lakshan shaareerik he parantu inke jaivik kaaran saamne nahin aate
 For example, if a person is complaining of stomachache but even when there is no problem of that particular part ie stomach
 kisi-kisi abhighataj ghatana ke baad vyakti apana pichhlaa astitv, gat ghatnaayen or aas-paas ke logon ko pahchaanane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 In clinical psychology, such problems are called dissociative disorders, in which a person's personality is separated from the social and society
 vighatnsheel smritilop, vighatnsheel manovikar kaa ek varg he, jisamen vyakti aamtaur par kisi tanaavpurn ghatana ke baad mahatvapurn vyaktigat soochna ko yaad karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 In the state of dissolution, a person realizes his new existence
 doosraa varg vighatnsheel pahchaan vikaar he jisamen vyakti apni yaaddaasht to kho hi detaa he vahiin naye astitv kii kalpana karne lagata he
 The other category is personality disorder, in which a person feels sudden changes or variably odd
 vyakti is prakaar mahasoos karata he jaise usne apane sharir ko tyaag diya ho yaa phir us kii gatividhiyaan achaanak se yantric yaa swapn ke jaisi ho jaati he
 However, the most serious situation of disintegration psychosis arises when there is a multiple personality psychosis and dissolution psychosis
 is sthiti main vividh vyaktitv ek hi vyakti main alag-alag samay par prakat hote hai
 You may have seen someone on the street in dirty clothes, eating unhygienic food lying around the garbage or interacting or behaving strangely
 unamem vyakti, sthaan va samay ke vishay main kamjor abhivinyas hota he
 We often call them insane, unconscious, but in clinical language they are called psychotic
 ye manovikar kii ek gambhir paristhiti hoti he, jo ashaant vichaaron, manobhaavon va vyavhaar se hote hai
 Dementia disorders include inconsistent mindset, faulty perception, obstruction of operative activities, monotonous and inappropriate expressions
 isse grast vyakti vaastaviktaa se nirlypt rahete hai or aksar kaalpaniktaa or bhranti kii duniya main khoye rahete he
 Vibranti means looking at something that is not actually physically there, some sounds that are not really there
 bhramasakti vaastaviktaa ke prati andhavishwaas he is tarah ke vishwaas dusron se sambandh viched karte hai
 There are different types of psychosis, such as catatonic psychosis
 vyaktitv vikaar kii jaden kisi vyakti ke shishav kaal se judin hoti hai, jahaan kuch bachche lochaheen va ashudv vichaardhaara viksit kar lete hai
 These different personalities emerge from a harmless isolation in a psychotic person as emotionless sequential killers
 vyaktitv manovikaron kii shreniyon ko teen samoohon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 At first, the group is characterized by strange and eccentric behavior
 chintaa or shaq duusare samooh kii visheshta he or tisare samooh kii visheshta he naatakeey, bhavpurn or aniyamit vyavhaar
 The first group consists of vioharabha, interrabandha, paranoid personality disorders
 duusare samooh main ashrith, parivarjit, jununee vyaktitv manovikar bataae gaye hai
 Antisocial, borderline, acting, narcissistic personality disorders fall under the third group
 kisi bhi prakaar ke manovikaron se nipatane ke liye kuch vishesh manashchikitsa prakriya dwaara vyakti kii seva kii jaati hai
 The person who determines the nature of the program of psychiatry is a trained person, called a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist
 jo vyakti yah upachaar karwaata he use sevaarthee / rogi kehete hai
 Psychiatry is often called negotiation therapy because it is provided by interpersonal contact
 is kii aushadhiyaan keval manochikitsak dwaara hi di ja sakati hai, jo ki aushadhiy chikitsak hona manashchikitsa kii vibhinn takneekein hoti hai, jo asaamaanya vyavhaaron ke kaaran evam vikaas kaa varnan karti hai
 These include psychoanalysis, behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, client-centered therapy, etc
 manashchikitsa ek roopaankit yojana he, jo ki manovikaron kii prakruti or gambheertha ko dhayaan main rakhkar taiyaar kii jaati he
 The individual usually follows work-oriented and immune-oriented or emotion-focused processes to deal with stress
 kaary abhivinyast prakriya kaa uddeshy kisi vishesh tanaav kaarak dwaara adhiropit kii gai samyoji maang kaa yathartwadita se samaadhaan dhundhna he
 These are based on objective assessment of stressful situations at conscious and rational levels
 tanaav se nipatane ke in tareekon ko teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he jaise prarambh, pratyaahaar or samjhauta
 Coping with stress through emotion-focused or self-defense-oriented methods is not beneficial, as the individual does not arrive at a solution through it, just finding ways to reassure themselves
 aatmarakshak paddatiyon kaa udhaaharan budvisangat vyakhya karnaa he jaise yah tark dena ki sabhi vidhyaarthee isiilie asafal rahe, kyonki pariksha-patr kaaphi kathin tha
 Another example of this is displacement such as bringing down the anger on the strict teacher by scolding or killing his younger brother
 yahaan aapane krodh kaa visthaapan kiya he
 It is very important to understand that in order to effectively deal with stress, one should adopt a healthy lifestyle
 sakaraatmak soch, manobhaavon or kriyaaon dwaara sirf tanaav se hi behatar tareeke se nahin nipta ja saktaa he, varan iske dwaara ham jivan main atyadhik prasann va halkaa mahasoos karte hai, evam adhik yogya banate hai
 There are many types of mental disorders
 ye vikaar vyaktitv, manodasha, khaane kii aadaton, chintaa aadi se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 Thus the list of mental diseases is very large
 kuch mukhya manorogon kii suchi neeche di gayi he- There are many types of causes of psychiatry
 inamen se mukhya prakaar nimnlikhit hai : Genetic: Diseases like psychosis or psychosis, personality disorders, alcoholism, retardation, epilepsy, etc
 are more common in those whose children are almost doubled if any family member suffers from them
 sthool vyaktiyon main bhavatmak rog, histyria, hriday rog ityadi adhik hote hai jabaki lambey evam duble gathan vaale vyaktiyon main vikhandit manskta, tanaav, vyaktitv rog adhik paye jate hai
 People with schizophrenia have more of a schizoid personality than those with lost, quiet, low-friend-like bookworms, while those with a disciplined and hygienic preference, punctual, frugal consumption have higher consumption diseases
 is found
 kishoravastha, yuvavastha, vriddhavastha, garbh-dhaaran jaise shaareerik parivartan kai manorogon kaa aadhaar ban sakate hai
 Consumption of certain drugs, chemical substances, metals, alcohol and other drugs etc
 can cause the development of psychopaths
 aapasi sambandhon main tanaav, kisi priy vyakti kii mrityu, sammaan ko thes, kaary ko kho baithna, aarthik haani, vivaah, talaak, shishu janm, kaary-nivritti, pariksha yaa pyaar main asafalataa ityadi bhi manorogon ko utpann karne yaa badhaane main yogadan dete hai
 Social and recreational activities can cause depression, loneliness, political, natural or social accidents
 maansik rog yaa paagalpan ek aisa shabd he jisase iske kaarnon evam upachaar ke vishay main na jane kitni bhrantiyaan evam ashankaaye judi hai
 Some people consider it to be an incurable, genetic and contagious disease, and some witchcraft, ghosts and witch outbreaks
 kuch log ise beemaari na maanakar jimmedaariyon se bachane kaa naatak maatr bhi maanate hai
 Ignorant people go to local or nearby Ojha, Pandit, Mulla etc
 for treatment, consume unnecessary herbs, herbs and are inhumanly persecuted so as to remove the wrath of 'pishchamat'
 yah sab galat he
 The correct assumption is that it is a disease and it is possible to treat it scientifically by medical science
 ye bhi sahi nahin he ki- Raz and Tama are the two psyche diseases
 inaki vikruti se hone vaale vikaar maanas rog kehalaate hai 
 Kama, anger, greed, fascination, Ishiyar, Maan, mada, mourning, worry, udveg, fear, joy, grief, abhyasuya, dainya, matsyaar and dambha are these diseases
 1
 kaam- indriyon ke vishay main adhik aasakti rakhana 'kaam' kehalaata he 
 2
 Anger- The tendency to hurt others by which the mind and body also suffer is called anger
 3
 lobh- duusare ke dhan, stri aadi ke grahan kii abhilaashaa ko lobh kehete hai

 The group established an Islamic theology called Darul Uloom Deoband, where the Islamic revivalist and anti-imperialist ideology of Deobandi developed

 " The founders of the Deobandi movement, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi, studied Sufism at the feet of Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki
 sabhi sahamat nahin hai ki devbandis sufi hai
 Whatever is considered by many to be anti-sufis, whatever the case, Darul Uloom Deoband's orthodoxy and radical theology have since led to a true fusion of his teachings with Wahibism in Pakistan, which are "all scattered about the mysterious Sufi presence" there
