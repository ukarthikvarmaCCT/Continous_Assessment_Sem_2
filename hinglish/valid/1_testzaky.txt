 It has come there that the power of thought keeps the soul higher, so that the human-mind should be aware that all the material substances or manifestations in the whole universe are all one and they have the same variety
 bhagavadgita ne yahi bhaavana or adhik spasht rup se vyakt kii he-'vah vyakti, jo antkaal main mujhe samaran karata hua is jivan se vidaa hota he, vah mere paas aata he, isamen sanshay nahin he'
 But one thing to remember is that nothing will happen in the end only by remembering God, when the soul is overwhelmed with such emotion throughout life, then only God attains God
 aisa kaha gaya he-'vyakti mrityu ke samay jo bhi rup sochataa he, usee ko vah praapt hota he or yah tabhi sambhav he, jabaki vah jivan bhar aisa karata aayaa ho
 ' puraanon ke aadhaar par kuch nibandhon kaa aisa kathan he ki antkaal upasthit hone par vyakti ko, yadi sambhav ho to, kisi tirth-sthaan main le janaa chahie
 Shuddhittattva has quoted the Korampurana - 'A person attains salvation by dying in the waters of the Ganges, in the site or waters of Varanasi, in the Gangasagar or in its land, water or space
 ' isi arth main skandapurana main aayaa he-'ganga ke taton se ek gavyuti tak kshetra hota he, itani dur tak daan, jap evam home karne se ganga kaa hi fal praapt hota he; jo is kshetra main marataa he, vah swarg jaataa he or pun: janm nahin paata'
 He has come to Pujratnakar - 'where the Shalgramshila is there, Hari resides there; One who dies near Shalagramashila receives the supreme sacrifice of Hari
 ' aisa bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi koi anarya desh main bhi shalagram se ek kos kii duuri par marataa he, vah vaikuntha paata he
 Similarly, a person who dies in the forest of Tulsi or at the time of death in whose face Tulsidal gets Mokshapad even after committing crores of sins

 There are some assumptions about the best period of death
 shaantiparv main aayaa he- 'jo vyakti surya ke uttar disha main jane par marataa he yaa kisi anya shubh nakshatra evam muhoort main marataa he, vah sachmuch punyavan he
 'this sentiment is based on the notion of dying in Uttarayan and Dakshinayan expressed in the Upanishads
 chaandogopenishad main aayaa he- 'ab chaahe log uski antyeshti kriya karen yaa na karen, vah archi: arthath prakaash ko praapt hota he, prakaash se din, din se chandra ke ardh prakaash, usase uttarayan ke chha: maas, usase varsh, varsh se surya, surya se chandra, chandra se vidyut ko praapt hota he
 Amanav leads him to Brahm
 yah devon kaa maarg he; vah maarg, jisase brahm kii prapti hoti he
 Those who go this route do not return to human life again
 haan, ve nahin lautate
 'the same thing has come in the Chandogyopanishad, where it has been said that the householder who knows Panchagni-gya and also the Vanaprastha and Parivrajaka who believe and meditate, also go to Devayana
 or jo log gramvasi hai, yagyaparayan hai, daan-dakshinayukta hai, dhooma ko jate hai, ve dhooma se raatri, raatri se chandra ke ardh andhkaar main, usase dakshinyan ke chha: maas, usase pitrulok, usase akaash evam chandra ko jate hai, jahaan ve karmfal pate hai or pun: usee maarg se laut aate hai
 The Chandogyopanishad has indicated a third place, where insects and kites etc
 keep coming
 brihadaaranyakopenishad ne bhi devloag, pitrulok evam us lok kaa ullekh kiya he, jahaan keet, patang aadi jate hai
 The Bhagavad Gita has also said these words of the Upanishads in a subtle way - i will describe those times when devotees depart from this world to never return
 agni, jyoti, din, shukla paksh, uttarayan surya ke chha:; jab brahmagyani in kaalon main marate hai, to brahmalok jate hai
 Devotees who die in six months of Dhoom, night, Krishna Paksha, Dakshinayan Sun, go to Chandralok and return again
 is vishay main ye do maarg, jo prakaashmaan evam andhakaarmay hai, sanathan hai
 One who returns from one never returns, but one who comes from another returns
 veydantasutra ne 'prakaash', 'din' aadi shabdon ko yathashrut shabdic arth main lene ko nahin kaha he; arthath uske mat se ye margon ke lakshan yaa str nahin hai, pratyut ye un devataaon ke pratik hai, jo mritatmaon ko sahaayta dete hai or devloak evam pitrulok ke margon main unhen le jate hai, arthath ve aativaahik evam abhimaani devtaa hai
 Shankar has explained in the interpretation of Vedantasutra that when Bhishma recited Uttarayana, it should be understood from this that there is only praise for Archiradi - the one who is a Brahmistra, even if he dies in Dakshinayan, he gets the fruit of his knowledge, That is, one attains Brahm
 jab bhishma ne uttarayan kii baat johi to aisa karke unhone keval lokprasiddh prayog yaa aacharan ko manyata di or unhone yah bhi prakat kiya ki unamem yah shakti bhi thi ki ve apni ichhashakti se hi mar sakate hai, kyonki unke pita ne unhen aisa var de rakhaa tha
 Despite the words of Shankar and Vedantasutra, it has been a well-known thing that it is better to die in Uttarayana
 antyeshti ek sanskaar he
 It is one of the sixteen or more rituals performed by the Dwijs and is performed with Vedic mantras by the views of Manu, Yajnavalkyasmriti and Jatukarnya
 ye sanskaar pehle striyon ke liye bhi hote the, kintu bina vaidic mantron ke or shudron ke liye bhi bina vaidic mantron ke
 Baudhayana Pitrimedhasutra states that there are two rites of credit for every human being and they are the birth rites and the deceased rites
 dah sanskaar tathaa shraadh aadi aahitagni evam smartagni ke liye bhinn-bhinn ritiyon se hote hai, tathaa un logon ke liye bhi jo shrout yaa smart koi agni nahin rakhte
 One who is a woman, a child, a parivrajak, one who dies in a distant country, one who dies prematurely or commits suicide or dies accidentally; Funeral acts for them are of different types
 ek hi vishay kii krity-vidhiyon main shrautasutra evam grihyasutra vibhinn baaten kehete hai or aage chalakar madhya evam pashchaatyakalin yugon yugon main vidhiyaan or bhi vistrut hoti chali gayi hai
 Decision Sindhu has clearly stated that, the funeral is mentioned differently in each branch, but some things are same in all branches
 anty-karmon ke vistaar, abhaav evam upasthiti ke aadhaar par sutron, smritiyon, puraanon evam nibandhon ke kaal-kram-sambandhi nishkarsh nikaale gayi hai, kintu ye nishkarsh bahudhaa anumaanon evam vaiyaktik bhaawanaaon par hi aadhaarit hai
 The five Suktas of the Rigveda are translated as follows before the Shrutasutras, Grihyasutras and the later deeds mentioned in the later texts
 in sookhton kii richaayen bahudhaa sabhi sutron dwaara prayukt hui hai or unka prayog aaj bhi antyeshti ke samay hota he or unamem adhikansh vaidic samhitaon main bhi paayi jaati hai
 Indian and Western commentators have interpreted and interpreted these mantras in various ways
 rugveda main pratham sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the second sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - rugveda main tritiy sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the fourth sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - Except for three to six mantras of this sukta, other mantras do not throw light on the funeral, so we will translate only four mantras

 vaikhansasmartasutra ne akritidahan ko faldaayak karm mana he or ise keval shav yaa asthiyon kii aprapti tak hi simit nahin mana he
 Shuddhiprakash has quoted the Brahma Purana saying that Aakritahana should not be confined to Ahitagni only, this karma is also for those who have not performed Shruta Agnihotra
 is vishay main aahitagniyon ke liye ashauch 10 dinon tak tathaa anya logon ke liye keval 3 dinon tak hota he
 In the Satyasadha Shrutasutra, Boudhayan Pitrimedasutra and Garuda Purana, such a system has been given that if a person who has gone abroad returns after shaping, that is, a person who is deemed dead returns to a living state, he is taken out by dipping in a pool filled with melted butter; He is given a bath again and all rites are performed from caste work
 iske uparant usko apni patni ke saath pun: vivaah karnaa hota he, kintu yadi uski patni mar gayi he to vah duusari kanya se vivaah kar saktaa he or tab vah pun: agnihotra armbh kar saktaa he
 Some sources have provided that if Ahitagni's wife dies before he can, he can either burn it with shroteagni or keep it in a fire filled with cow dung or in three thalias, soon by the fire produced by the burning weeds
 Can burn manusmriti kaa kathan he ki yadi aahitagni dwij kii savarna evam sadaacharini patni mar jaye to aahitagni pati apni shrout evam smart agniyon se use yajyapatro ke saath jala saktaa he
 After that, he can marry again and start Agnihotra
 vishwaroop aahitagni ke vishay main kathak-shruti ko uddhrut kar kaha he ki yadi koi vyakti apni patni kii mrityu ke uparant bhi ve hi puraani shrautagniyaan rakhata he to ve agniyaan us agni ke samaan apavitra maani jaati hai, jo shav ke liye prayukt hoti hai or usne itnaa jod diya he ki yadi aahitagni kii kshatriya patni uske purv mar jaye to uskaa dah bhi shrautagniyon se hi hota he
 This theory is opposed to the views of other commentators, but he has taken the 'savarna' used in Manusmriti as an example only because not doing so will lead to sentence discrimination
 at: brahman patni ke atirikt kshatriya patni ko bhi manyata di gai he
 Some memories have written that Ahitagni can perform his Agnihotra even in a widower form and perform Yajnadi by making a wife's gold or Kush statue, as Rama did
 jab grihasth apni mul patni ko shrautagniyon ke saath jalaane ke uparant pun: vivaah nahin karata he or na pun: naveen vaidic agniyaan rakhata he to vah marane ke uparant saadhaaran agniyon se hi jalaayaa jaataa he
 If the householder does not remarry, he can burn the corpse of his dead wife in the fire emanating from the aranis
 yadi aahitagni pehle mar jaye to uski vidhwaa araniyon se utpann agni se jalaayee jaati he
 When the wife is cremated, there is no recitation of the mantra called 'asmatvamabhijatosi'
 keval sadaacharini evam pativrata stri kaa dah-karm shrout yaa smart agni se hota he
 According to Ritu and Baudhayana Pitrumedhasutra, the widow and widow are cremated by the fire called kapal, the brahmachari and the Yeti is born from the fire, the virgin girl and the unborn boy are born from the straw
 yadi aahitagni patit ho jaae yaa kisi prakaar se aatmahatya kar le yaa pashuon yaa sarpon se bhidakar mar jaae to uski shrautagniyaan jal main phenk deni chahie, smart agniyaan chauraahey yaa jal main phenk deni chahie, yajyapatro ko jala daalana chahie or use saadhaaran agni se jalaana chahie
 Manusmriti, Yajnavalkyasamriti, Parasramadhaviya, Vishnu Dharmasutra, Brahmapuran should cover the womb, fetus, dead baby and toothless infant covered with cloth
 choti avasthaa ke bacchon ko nahin jalaana chahie, kintu is vishay main pracheen smritiyon main avasthaa sambandhi vibhed paaya jaataa he
 Parskar Grihyasutra, Yajnavalkyasmriti, Manusmriti, Yama etc
 have arranged that children within the year should be buried outside the village in a clean place away from the crematorium
 aise bacchon ke shavon par ghrit kaa lep karnaa chahie, un par chandanalep, pushp aadi rakhane chahie, na to unhen jalaana chahie or na jal-tarpan karnaa chahie or na unka asthi-chayan karnaa chahie
 Relatives cannot go together
 yama ne yamasookt ke paath evam yama ke sammaan main stutipth karne kii vyavastha di he
 Manusmriti has given some alternative arrangements, such as watering can be done for children with teeth or naming-sanskrit children, ie there can be cremation of such children
 at: do varsh se kam avasthaa ke bacchon kii antyeshti ke vishay main vikalp he, arthath namakaran evam daant nikalne ke uparant aise bachche jalaaye yaa gaade ja sakate hai
 But in doing this it is not necessary to go with all the dead bodies
 yadi baccha do varsh kaa ho yaa yadi adhik avasthaa kaa ho, kintu abhi upanayan sanskaar nahin hua ho to uskaa dahakarm loukik agni se avashya hona chahie or maun rup se jala dena chahie
 Chudakaran with the opinion of Laugakhi - Sanskrit children should have the same kind of funeral
 vaikhansasmartasutra ne kaha he ki 5 varsh ke ladke tathaa 7 varsh kii ladki kaa dahakarm nahin hota
 After Upanayana, there is cremation like Ahitagni, but Yajnapatras do not have right and mantra
 boudhayanpitrumedhasutra ne vyavastha di he ki chudaakaran ke purv mrit bacchon kaa shavadah nahin hota, kumari kanyaon evam upanayan rahit ladakon kaa pitrumedh nahin hota
 He has also arranged that children without teeth are buried with 'om' and children with teeth are buried with vyahtriyas
 mitakshra ne niyamon ko nimna rup se diya he-'namakaran ke purv keval gaada jaataa he, jal-tarpan nahin hota; namakaran ke uparant teen varsh tak gaadna yaa jalaana vikalp se hota he; teen varsh se upanayan ke purv tak shavadah evam tarpan maun rup se hota he; yadi teen varsh ke purv chudaakaran ho gaya ho to marane par yahi niyam lagu hota he
 After the Upanayana, the cremation of the dead is done by temporal fire, but the manner is the same as that prescribed for Ahitagni

 15veen shatee se hi jo khojein aarambh hui unke madhyam se portugaliyon kaa sampark africa, asia or america ke nivaasiyon se hua
 As a result, many new words were introduced in Portuguese
 laathini kii tulana main portugali kii mukhya visheshtaayen nimna hai : The syntactic phonology in Portuguese is worth noting: the pronunciation of 'S' in the syllable is often the same as the 'sh' of 'ship', but when followed by more words, it is pronounced as Z, as in as
 Z; Being pronounced in the east of the vowel and preceding the Ghosh Varna, its pronunciation is similar to the Pleasure K, but beyond the Aghosha Varna remains S
 'OS Pis' kaa uccharan 'us pass' hota he - kyonki pa adhosh he, 'as artes' kaa uccharan 'az arthess' hota he kyonki 'artes' ke prarambh main swar he

 In addition to the original nonverbal verb form, another descriptive or syntactic verb form is found in Portuguese, which is often associated with a certain phrase
 'i una vergonha noo sabermoe escrever' - yah lajja kii baat he ki ham likh nahin sakate
 In nematic verbs there is also a future form which is similar to the common form of a proper verb
 anya navalathini bhashaaon ke samaan portugali is drushti se bhi bhinn he ki usamen laathini kaa purnabhoot sanketkaal bhi shesh rah gaya he 
 Due to the omission of factors, it became necessary to tighten the order of words in comparison to the wide variety of Latino words
