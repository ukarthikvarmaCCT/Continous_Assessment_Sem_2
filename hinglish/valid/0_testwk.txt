 Template: Artist of Backstreet Boys]] Artist]] / ATV Music Publishing Artist]] darian calendar mangal grah par maanav basane kii sthiti main samay gananaa ke liye prastaavit pranali he
 It was created and named in 1985 by airspace engineer and political scientist Thomas Gangale
 calendar kaa nirmaan kiya he jisamen se buniyadi samay avadhi mangal grah kaa nivasee saura din or ushnkaribandheey varsh se thodaa alag he jo mangal grah kaa nivasee vasant vishuv varsh, kar rahe hai 
 pa sthaliy saura din kii tulana main 35
244 second ab 39 minute he or mangal grah kaa nivasee vasant vishuv varsh lambaai main 668
5907 SOLS he
 The basic intercalation formula therefore allocates six 669 sol years and four 668 sol years to each planet resident decade
 In the former odd or evenly divisible by 10, 6686 SOLS production per ten years
 darian calendar ke baad chalanaa 100 aam saal se saal vibhajya banaaya he, lekin 500 pravaas chalaang saal se vibhajya saal 
 yah 12,000 mangal grah kaa nivasee prati varsh ke bare main keval ek sol ke ek truti main parinaam he
 The year is divided into 24 months
 prayek timahi main pehle 5 maheenon main 28 SOLS he
 It jumps to its final form when it is the last month of a leap year, as long as the last month is only 27 SOLS
 calendar ek saat pa saptaah rakhata he, lekin saptaah prayek maah kii shuruyaat main apni pehali pa se aarambh hota he
 a month is 27 SOLS, so the last of the week is omitted
 is safaai ke liye aanshik rup se he
 It should also be remembered that 28 Earth days is equal to the resident SOLS of 27 +1 / 4, however, close to the average length of terrestrial week is not as rational as making the average length of Martian week and 27 5 / Can be 6 Martian SOLS
 Vrishika ke antim din har saal main nahin hoti he ki ek antanivishti din he
 The Martian year is treated as the beginning near the equinox marking spring in the northern hemisphere of the planet
 mangal grah vartmaan main prithvi ke samaan ek aksheeya jhukaav he, taaki dharti ke saath tulana main surya ke bare main 'mangal kii kaksha kaa adhik se adhik sanak unke mahatv dridhtaa se dakshini golarddh main parilakshith or chipa hua he iskaa matlab he ki haalanki mangal grah kaa nivasee mausam, pratyaksh kar rahe hai uttari golarddh main 
 darian calendar kii sabase parishkrut gananaa kai hajaar varshon main mangal grah kaa nivasee vasant vishuv varsh kii lambaai main maamuli vruddhi ke liye bhatta banane ke mudde par vistaar 
 ye ek adhik jatil madhyanivesh sutara likh
 Gangale originally selected late 1975 as the era of the calendar in recognition of the American Viking program as the first fully successful American soft landing mission to Mars and the first 1971 Soviet Mars 3 landing overlooked
 
 2002 main vah pehali baar mangal grah kii tiko brahe kii tippaniyon ke johans kepler upyog grahon kii gati ke niyamon ko spasht, or yah bhi ek doorabeen ke saath mangal grah kaa galileo galilei kii pehali tippaniyon ke liye kii manyata main 1609 main jo peter kokeh, ne suzav diya doorabeen yug, apanaaya

 The Darian calendar suggests variations on the World Wide Web, using schemata for different naming weekdays and the month of the year
 24 maheenon ke naam praavadhik prayaavartan main raashi chakra or unke sanskrit samakaksh ke taramandal ke latin naam ke rup main gaangale dwaara chune gaye hai
 Likewise, 7 sols of the week were named after the 5 brightest planets, as seen from the Sun, Moon and Mars - including Earth
 The Darian defrost calendar creates, for example, the new name for the resident month outside the month order and the letter letter and weather length related pattern to the season
 2001 main mangal grah samay samooh dwaara taiyaar kaalpanik calendar, namakaran sanshodhan ke liye atirikt suzav diya he
 In 2002 Gangale devised a version of the Darian calendar that solves the month and week SOLS solution in a repeating pattern and removes the need to skip days of the week
 In the Martina version, all months in a given quarter begin on the same side of the week, but each month begins with a shift from Sol to the next quarter
 nimna talika timahi main prayek maah shuru hota he jis par saptaah ke pa se pataa chalata he
 The first quarter resident corresponds to the Martian in the southern hemisphere, the northern hemisphere and the spring in autumn
 chalaang pa mul darian calendar main ke rup main kareeb gine saal ke ant main hota he
 The oddly numbered 28 SOLS occurs in the last month of the year, the next year also repeating the relationship of the week-to-week SOLS at which the Sol begins at Solis, resulting in a two-year cycle
 har dasven saal main joda jaataa he ki pa epagomenal he, is prakaar saptaah ke SOLS kii do saal kii roteshan baadhit nahin he
 The Martiana plan avoids the need for a Darian calendar to shorten six sols three to four times per year per week
 nuksaan darian calendar maheene ke maheene se repeatable he jabaki yojana, saptaah or maheene ke SOLS milan ke liye ek do saal ke chakra main yah parinaam he
 Cube, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto: The 1998 Gangesale adapted the Darian calendar for use on Jupiter's four Galilean moons discovered by Galileo in 1610
 In 2003, he created a version of the calendar for Titan

 According to the plan, Gandhi was to be killed at the time of the chaos caused by the bombings, but at that time his pistol was jammed and he could not move at all

 On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse reached Birla Bhavan in Delhi 40 minutes before the time of prayer meeting
 jaise hi gandhi prarthana-sabha ke liye parisar main daakhil hue, nathuram ne pehle unhen haath jodakar pranaam kiya uske baad bina koi bilamb kiye apni pistaul se teen goliyaan maar kar gandhi kaa ant kar diya

 These cells bind the blood flow, for example, when one of your organs is cut a little, then these cells bind the blood flow
 yadi chemotherapy ke kaaran aapaki platelets bahut kam ho gai hai to aap dekhge ki aapako aasaani se kharonchen lag jaati hai, athwa aapaki naak yaa masoodon se khun bahata he

 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den

 aapke upachaar ke kai dinon baad tak aapke sharir ke drav padaarthon main kuch ansh main chemotherapy ke tatv maujuud ho sakate he
 Although the risk of harm from this is very low, it is important that others are exposed to chemotherapy
 isliye hamaari yah salaah he ki aap toilet kaa istemaal karne ke turant baad pani chalaa den or apane haath acchhee tarah se dhoen
 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them

 isse aapkesharir kii rogapratikaarak paidaa karne kii kshamta ghatati he, jo aapako flu se bachaane ke liye jaruri hai
 If you get vaccinated during chemotherapy, you should do so only when your white cell count falls to normal levels
 yadi aapaki safed koshikaon kii sankhya kam he to aapako tikaa lagavane se bachanaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se aapke sharir kaa taapmaana bad saktaa he
 This can lead to a misunderstanding that you have a fever due to infection and as a result you may have to be treated unnecessarily in a hospital
 chemotherapy karaane ke dauraan yadi aap ghar par aswasth mahasoos karen or aapako yah lage ki aisa chemotherapy kii vajah se ho rahaa he to aapako hamen turant sampark karnaa chahie
