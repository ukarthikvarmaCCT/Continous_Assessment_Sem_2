 Spiral of cultivation theory sadhana siddhant kii elizabeth newman ke sarpil vishleshan karti he or parsparik sanchaar or media janata kii raay ke vikaas main ek saath kaise kaam ko darshata he
 Elizabeth Neumann is a German political scientist
 sadhana siddhant newman ke is sarpil ke madhyam se paroksh rup se naaji ke niyantran main dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan yahudiyon sthiti bataate hai
 Adolf Hitler is dominated by the entire society and silenced for fear of segregation or separation due to minority Jews
 is siddhant ke chunaav main kuch drishyon dusron kii tulana main adhik khilne paane ke liye lag rahe hai ki rajyon
 Sometimes people talk about them rather than mute their opinions
 ve apni raay lokapriy he ki maanata he jab vyaktiyon ko vyakt karne or to lagata he ki jo log chup rahete hai jab yah hota he
 If one side of an issue ends with more publicity and the other side with little, then this process occurs in a spiral
 yah abhivyakti / gaiyr-abhivyakti do parisar par tiki hui he
 The first is the popular opinion of people who know that
 duusare logon ko in dharanaon ko raay kii unki abhivyakti ko samyojit he
 Psychologists believe that this 'spiral of cultivation' is caused by fear of isolation as an attempt to win over the 'spiral of silence', but not as an attempt to avoid separation from a social group
 
 aalochana kii dhamkee bhi vyaktiyon munh band karne main shaktishaalee balon hai
 This process affects public opinion, but separations are feared and there are exceptions as groups and individuals who do not express their opinion of any outcome
 korporate sanchaar samaaroh ke dizin or placement The need for centralization or decentralization usually comes down to weighing the idea of company size, product or service diversity, and geographic expansion
 general electric ke rup main vividh or bade ek company ke liye, udhaaharan ke liye, sawaal yah vivaadaaspad tha
 Such a vast, diverse organization involved in various activities as aerospace and television networks cannot possibly remain fully centralized in all of its communication activities
 shaayad tab, badi companiyon ke liye acchhee sanrachana ek majboot, kendrikrut, kaary kshetra ke saath saath swatantra vyapaar ikai kii vishesh jaruraton ke samaaroh anukool dhaalane jabaki sanghathan bhar main lagaataar sanchaar rakhane ke liye madad vikendrikrut gurgon ke ek network ke kuch sangyojan he
 Despite its advantages, the mix of centralized and decentralized activities presents problems for organizations in terms of reporting relationships
 sanchaar gurgon mukhyalay se prabandhak sthaneey str par kii gai karrwai se sahamat nahin hai, jab ve anivaary rup se, ve samasyaon main chalaa jayega, ke rup main apane sthaneey prabandhakon ko report karte hai
 On the other hand, operatives may not fit in with the rest of the organization locally if they report to headquarters
 in samasyaon ko aksar peeth par general electric, "patrakaron" ke rup main kaary karne ke maamle main ke rup main, company ke baahar ke madhyam se sanchaar se sambandhit sabhi maamalon ke liye ek majboot kendrikrut niyantran or sthaneey gurgon he jo kii bhagidaari donon ke kuch sangyojan kaa upyog rachanaatmak sambhala ja saktaa he mukhyalay
 The problem of decentralization versus centralization across business units will become more or less significant depending on the size of the company, geographical spread, and the diversity of the company's products and services bahudaleey nigociation More than multi-party talks, where the two sides are working together to reach a collective objective
 bahudaleey baatcheet kii prakriya main, prayek party apane hi variyataon ko or praathamiktaaon main he
 Therefore, a meeting is necessary for everyone to discuss the best option and to make a collective decision
 yah ek samuhik nirnay lene kii prakriya main adwitiya gatishiltaa shaamil he ki ek bahudaleey vaarta he
 However, this process is not so easy to manage
 bahudaleey vaarta or adhik kathin he par ek-ek baatcheet se prabandhan karne ke liye karnaa he ki kaarak hai
 First of all, the number of parties negotiated has grown and creates challenges for managing many different perspectives
 yah prayek party apane hi variyata baat karne ke liye or suna ja paryaapt samay he ki yah sunishchit karne ke liye mushkil he
 Secondly, information and computational complexity brings in more issues, more perspectives on issues, and more aggregate information
 dalon kii sankhya baatcheet sthiti kam chamakdaar, or adhik kii maang kar badhaane se
 Many people involved in making a decision also create social complexity
 saamaajik vaataavaran ek chote samooh charchaa karne ke liye ek par ek-ek samvaad se badal jayega
 As a result, all dynamics of small groups affect the way negotiators behave, and begin to participate
 adhik dalon ke ek baatcheet main shaamil kar rahe hai jab iske alaava, prakriya vyakti kaa paalan karnaa padataa he or adhik jatil he
 The parties will take a long time to present the issues and it takes time to reach the negotiation objective
 partiyon ke liye unhen or adhik prabhavi dhang se apane kaaryon kaa samanvay karne ke liye anumati detaa he ki ek nai prakriya ke liye baatcheet karne ke liye ho saktaa he
 Conversational art vyapaar lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye sabase mushkil baat yah he ki duniya main, shaayad baatcheet kii mej lekin kuch bhi nahin he
 To reach agreement through a negotiation and win on the other side is our market striving forever, for which is the most complex and complex task
 manovigyaan ke liye vyapaar pathari ke liye prabandhan vigyaan se or raajnneeti se kootneeti ke saath hi samaajwaad se, negations main shaamil hai or har kala dharna
 Negotiations need to be resumed not only in one of the subjects mentioned above, but they must be mastered for all equipment employment, if needed
 vyavsaay or arthshaastra ke teji se badalati duniya ke saath baatcheet karne kii kala main bhi adhik se adhik asthir or bashpikarniya hota ja rahaa he
 One cannot confront or feel settled settlements for a certain period of time but any one of the party involved feels dissatisfied when the need to be renegotiated can be born at any time
 ek bas vyapaar vaastaviktaaon par bharosa nahin kar sakate charchaa kii mej par baithe, vahiin ek tulanaatmak adhyayan nahin lagata kar sakate hai yaa tathyaatmak vyakhya vaanchit parinaam laane ja saktaa he
 One simply seems to beat the opponent by resorting to logics or employing rationalism, but in addition to doing what needs to be borne in mind, it may even be necessary to perform emotionally and fully
 To turn the table above the feeling that all rational thinking and conversational art cannot
 korporate communication kya he? By corporate communication we mean the voice of the corporation and the images it projects itself to various stakeholders
 is tarah ke sanchaar, sarkaar ke sambandhon or media prabandhan ke liye korporate pratishtha, korporate vigyaapan, or karmchaaree ke rup main kshetron main shaamil hai
 We will discuss them one by one in a later stage
 bada sanghathanon ke adhikansh in dinon corporate communicationwhich ke vibhaagon vipanan yaa lekha jaise paaramparik kaaryon ke saath-saath sanghathanaatmak chart par dikhaai diya he
 In addition, there is also the use of corporate communication processes to communicate all their messages to key constituencies - a combination of meetings, interviews, speeches, reports, images, advertisements, and online communications
 adarsh rup main, korporate sanchaar kii ore sanchaar yaa karmchaariyon internalize ki maansik aadaton kaa ek set ke ek drushtikon he
 The result is good communication practices that are present in an organization in all its communications with lime and constituencies
 korporate sanchaar ve memo, patr, report, websiton, i-mail, bhaashan yaa nae relies ho saktaa he, sanchaar ke utpaadon ke rup main paribhaashit kar rahe hai
 Overall in these messages it sends to constituencies, whether internal or external to a company
 korporate sanchaar vyavsaayon saamana karnaa he ki lagaataar jaanch or nakaaratmak dhyaan pratikriya karne ke liye ek pramukh tareeke ho sakate hai
 Second, to prevent a good strategy, expanding the scope of publicity barrage can compensate for technological development
 korporate jagat se teesraa, kai sabak or korporate sanchaar se bachane ke kathor parinaam pradarshit karata he
 And finally, corporate communication can serve as a differential benefit to your organization
 itnaa kuch companiyon ve karte hai ki un logon ko chhod ki is kala kaa abhyaas, or bheed se baahar khadaa he, yah acchhee tarah se karata he Business report writing: Report writing is an essential skill for professionals in almost every field
 report kii har tarah kii apni visheshtaayen he
 An investigation report or a survey report is essentially a fact finding report and should clearly bring out the facts
 ek nideshkon kii report, duusare haath par, vikaas yaa ek vishesh avadhi ke dauraan vyapaar sanghathan se sambandhit pragati kaa byora he
 a committee report can not only bring out facts and figures, but also cover the alternative view expressed by members and final recommendations

 At the age of seventeen, Mehrunnisa was married to a courageous Iranian young man named 'alikuli', who was given the title of Sher Afghan and the manor of Burdwan at the beginning of the reign of Jahangir
 1607 i
 main jahangir ke duuton ne sher afakhaan ko ek yuddh main maar daalaa
 Mehrunnisa was captured and brought to Delhi and sent to the emperor's royal harem
 yahan vah badshaah akbar kii vidhwaa rani 'salima begum' kii paricharika bani
 Mehrunnisa first saw Jahangir on the occasion of Nowruz festival and, enchanted by her beauty, Jahangir married her in May, 1611 AD
 vivaah ke pashchaat jahangir ne use ‘nurmahal’ evam ‘noorjehan’ kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 In 1613 AD, Nur Jahan was made 'pattamahishi' or 'badshah Begum'
 asaadhaaran sundari hone ke atirikt noorjehan budhimati, sheel or viveksmpann bhi thi
 He had a special interest in literature, poetry and fine arts
 uskaa lakshya bhed achook hota tha
 In 1619, he killed a lion with a single bullet
 in samast gunon ke kaaran usne apane pati par purna prabhutv sthapit kar liya tha
 As a result, the entire weight of Jahangir's rule had fallen on him
 sikkon par bhi uskaa naam khoda jane laga or vah mahal main hi darbar karne lagi
 His father Etmaduddola and brother Asaf Khan were accorded a high position in the Mughal court and his niece, who later became known as Mumtaz, married Shah Jahan
 usne pehle pati se utpann apni putree kaa vivaah jahangir ke sabase chote putr shehryaar se kar diya or kyonki uski jahangir se koi santan nahin thi, at: vah shehryaar ko hi jahangir ke uparaant raaj singhaasana par baithaana chaahati thi
 All these works of Nur Jahan were a part of his diplomacy
 1620 i
 ke ant tak noorjehan ke sambandh khurram se achche nahin rahe, kyonki noorjehan ko ab tak yah ahsaas ho gaya tha ki shahjahan ke baadashah banane par uskaa prabhaav shashan ke kaaryon par kam ho jaayga
 Therefore Nur Jahan started giving importance to Jahangir's second son 'shaharyar'
 chunki shehryaar alpaayu evam durbal charitra kaa tha, isliye uske samraat banane par noorjehan kaa prabhaav pehle kii tarah shashan ke kaaryon main bana rahata
 For this reason Sher married his daughter 'ladli Begum', born of Afghan, to Shaharyar in 1620 AD and granted him mansab of 8000 / 4000
 shahjahan ko jab is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki noorjehan uske prabhaav ko kam karnaa chaah rahi he, to usne jahangir dwaara qandahar durg par akraman kar use jeetne ke aadesh kii avhelnaa karte hue 1623 i
 main khusro khaan kaa vadh kar dakkan main vidroh kar diya
 To suppress his rebellion, Nur Jahan did not send Asaf Khan and sent Mahavat Khan under the leadership of Shahzada Parvez
 un donon ne safaltaapurvak shahjahan ke vidroh ko kuchal diya
 Shah Jahan surrendered to Father Jahangir and was pardoned
 jamaanat ke rup main shahjahan ke do putron daara shikoh or aurangzeb ko bandhak ke rup main rajdurbar main rakhaa gaya
 By 1625 AD, Shah Jahan's rebellion completely subsided
 shahjahan ke vidroh ko dabaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa nirvaah karne vaale mahavat khaan se noorjehan ko irshyaa hone lagi
 Nur Jahan realized that Mahavat Khan was one of those who did not accept my dominance in the work of governance
 mahavat khaan evam shahzada parvej kii nikatataa se bhi noorjehan ko khatara tha
 So to minimize his influence, Nur Jahan asked him to go to Bengal and give the account of the money looted during the war
 in kaarnon ke atirikt kuch or kaaran bhi the, jisase apamaanit mahasoos kar mahavat khaan ne vidroh kar kabul ja rahe samraat jahangir ko jhelum nadi ke tat par 1626 i
 main qaid kar liya
 Nur Jahan and his brother Asaf Khan were also arrested
 qaid main rakhane par bhi mahavat khaan ne jahangir ke prati nishtha evam sammaan kii baat nahin sochi
 In Rohtas, Nur Jahan and Jahangir liberated themselves from the influence of Mahavat Khan through diplomacy
 mahavat khaan apni suraksha ke liye ‘thatta’ kii ore bhaag gaya
 After Parvez's death on October 28, 1626, Mahavat Khan was weakened in some way and he went to the service of Shah Jahan
 jahangir ke jivan kaal main noorjehan sarvashakti sampann rahi, kintu 1627 i
 main jahangir kii mrityu ke uparaant uski raajnneetik prabhutaa nasht ho gai
 Nur Jahan died in 1645 AD
 apni mrityu paryant tak kaa shesh jivan usne lahore main bitaayaa
 Evidence of his artistic interest is available in the grand and attractive mausoleum, which he built in Agra on the bone relics of his father Etmaduddola
 kalavidon ke anusaar yah mazebara baarik or saaj-sajja kii drushti se anupam he
 Multani soil is a type of medicinal soil
 iskaa upyog puraane samay se bal dhone aadi ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Even in modern times, it is used for bathing, face packs etc
 charmarogon ko samaapt karne evam twachaa ko mulaayam rakhane main bahut sahaayak he
 In Britain it was used in the wool industry
 prachinkaal se hi multani mitti kaa istemaal rup ko nikhaarane ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The times may have changed but the importance of multani mitti has not diminished even today it is used for grooming
 multani mitti twachaa se gandagi saaf karne ke liye bahut kargar he or iske koi said effects bhi nahin hai
 The Nutanjeevi Mahakalpa or the Cenozoic Mahakalpa is a great revolution in the geological history of the earth, which started 6
6 million years ago and continues till today
 is se pehle madhyajivi mahakalp tha, jis se pehle purajivi mahakalp tha
 Visual Ion consists of three parts, consisting of Nutanjeevi, Madhyamjeevi and Puranjeevi Mahakalpa
 nutanjivi mahakalp ko "stanadhariyon kaa mahakalp" bhi kehete hai, kyonki is se pehle hui kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana main adhikansh bade praani maare gaye, jis se chote aakaar ke stanadhariyon ko ubharne or phir vividh jatiyon main kramviksit hone kaa avasar mila
 The new life cycle is divided into three geological imaginations: kishanpur doliya, vetalghat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 This article is about the Internet encyclopedia
 vikipedia ke mukh prishth ke liye, vikipedia kaa mukhya prishth dekhen
 For visitor introduction to Wikipedia, see page about Wikipedia
 vikipedia ek muft, web aadhaarit or sahyogi bahubhashi vishwakosh he, jo gaiyr-laabh vickemedia foundation se sahyog praapt pariyojna main utpann hua
 Its name is a combination of the two words Wiki and Encyclopedia
 duniya bhar main swayamsevakon ke dwaara sahyog se vikipedia ke 13 million lekh likhe gaye hai or iske lagbhag sabhi lekhon ko vah koi bhi vyakti sampadit kar saktaa he, jo vikipedia websit kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 It was started in January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, currently the most popular reference work on the Internet
 vikipedia ke aalochak ise vyavasthit purvaagrah or asangatiyon ko doshi tehraate hai, or aarope lagate hai ki yah isaki sampadakeey prakriya main uplabdhiyon par sahmati kaa paksh leti he
 The reliability and accuracy of Wikipedia is also an issue
 anya aalochanaon ke anusaar nakli yaa asatyaapit jaankaree kaa samavesh or vidhvansak pravriti bhi iske dosha hai, haalaanki vidwaanon ke dwaara kiye gaye kaary bataate hai ki vidhvansak pravriti aamtaur par alpakaalik hoti he
 Jonathan d of the New York Times, and Andrew Leah, in the fifth International Symposium on Online Journalism, described the importance of Wikipedia not only in the context of an encyclopedia but also as a frequently updated news source because it was recently Offers a very quick article about the events in jab time patrika ne you ko varsh 2006 ke liye person of da year kii manyata di or bataaya ki duniya bhar main kai million upyogkartaaon ke dwaara iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he or online sahyog main isaki badhati safalataa ko manyata di, isane web 2
0 sevaao ke teen udaahranon main vikipedia ko utyub or mispes ke saath rakhaa
 Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed as part of a formal process
 nupedia kii sthapana 9 march 2000 ko ek web portal company bomis, ink ke swaamitv ke tahat kii gayi
 Its main members were Jimmy Wales, Bomis CEO and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of Nupedia and later Wikipedia
 prarambh main nupedia ko iske apane nupedia open content license ke tahat license diya gaya or richard stallmen ke suzav par vikipedia kii sthapana se pehle ise GNU ke muft documentation license main badal diya gaya
 Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are the founders of Wikipedia
 jahaan ek ore wales ko saarvajanik rup se sampadan yogya vishwakosh ke nirmaan ke uddeshy ko paribhaashit karne ke shrey diya jaataa he, senger ko aamtaur par is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye ek viki kii ranneeti kaa upyog karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 On 10 January 2001, Larry Sanger proposed the Nupedia mailing list to produce a wiki as a "feeder project" for Nupedia
 vikipedia ko aupchaarik rup se 15 janvari 2001 ko, www
wikipedia
com par ekmaatr angreji bhashaa ke sanskaran ke rup main shuru kiya gaya
 And it was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list
 vikipedia kii "neutral point of vyuu" kii niti ko iske praarambhik maheenon main sanketabaddh kiya gaya, ore yah nupedia kii praarambhik "pakshpaatahin" niti ke samaan thi
 Otherwise, initially there were relatively few rules and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia
 vikipedia ne nupedia se praarambhik yogadanakarta praapt kiye, ye the sleshdot posting or search ingine indexing
 By the end of 2001, it had nearly 20,000 articles and 18 language editions
 2002 ke ant tak iske 26 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye, 2003 ke ant tak 46 or 2004 ke antim dinon tak 161 bhashaaon ke sanskaran ho gaye
 Nupedia and Wikipedia were present together until the former's server was permanently down in 2003 and its text was moved to Wikipedia
 9 sitambar 2007 ko angreji vikipedia 2 million lekh kii sankhya ko paar kar gaya, yah tab tak kaa sabase bada sankalit vishwakosh ban gaya, yahan tak ki isane yongal vishwakosh ke record ko bhi tod diya, jisane 600 varshon ke liye kaayam rakhaa tha
 Due to lack of control and perceived commercial advertising in an alleged English-focused Wikipedia, Spanish Wikipedia users split from Wikipedia in February 2002 to form Enciclopedia Libre
 baad main usee varsh, wales ne ghoshit kiya ki vikipedia vigyapanon kaa pradarshan nahin karegaa or isaki websit ko wikipedia
org main sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 Many other projects have since been separated from Wikipedia for editorial reasons
 vikiinfo ke liye kisi udasin drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he or yah mul anusandhan kii anumati detaa he
 New projects inspired by Wikipedia — such as citizendiam, scholarpedia, Conservapedia and Googles Knoll — have been launched to address Wikipedia's perceived limitations, such as its policies on peer review, original research, and commercial advertising
 vikipedia foundation kaa nirmaan 20 june 2003 ko vikipedia or nupedia se kiya gaya
 It was applied to the Trademark Office and the US Patent to trademark Wikipedia on 17 September 2004
 is mark ko 10 janvari 2006 ko panjikaran kaa darja diya gaya
 Trademark protection was provided by Japan on 16 December 2004 and by the European Union on 20 January 2005
 takneekee rup se ek sarvice mark, mark kaa scope "internet ke madhyam se aam vishwakosh ke gyaan ke kshetra main jaankaree ke praavdhaan" ke liye he, kuch utpaadon jaise pustakon or dvds ke liye vikipedia trademark ke upyog ko license dene kii yojanayen banaayi ja rahi hai

 vikipedia ke avyav florida main kanoon ke adheen hai, jahaan vikipedia ke sarvaron kii mejabani kii jaati he or kai sampadakeey nitiyaan or dishanirdesh is baat par bal dete hai ki vikipedia ek vishwakosh he
 Each entry in Wikipedia must be about a subject that relates to the encyclopedia and is eligible for inclusion as such
 ek vishay vishwakosh se sambandhit samajha ja saktaa he yadi yah vikipedia ke shadjaal main "ullekhneey" he, arthath, yadi isane un madhyamik vishwasaneey sroton main mahatvapurn kawarez praapt kiya he, jo is vishay ke maamle se swatantra hai
 Second, Wikipedia has to display only the knowledge that is already established and recognized
 duusare shabdon main, udhaaharan ke liye ise nayi jaankaree or mul kaary ko prastut nahin karnaa chahie
 a claim that can be challenged requires a reference to reliable sources
 vikipedia samudaay ke bheetar, ise aksar "verifiability, not truth" ke rup main bataaya jaataa he, yah is vichaar ko vyakt karata he ki pathak khud lekh main prastut hone vaali saamagree kii sachai kii jaanch kar saken or is vishay main apni khud kii vyakhya banaayen
 ant main, vikipedia ek paksh nahin letaa he
 All views and approaches, if they can specify external sources, must find a suitable part of coverage within an article

 Because contributors typically rewrite a small portion of an entry rather than an entire encore, the components of high and low quality in an entry may be mixed

 Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia is generally reliable, but the reliability of any given article is not always clear
 paaramparik sandarbh kaary jaise encychlopedia britanika ke sampadak, ek vishwakosh ke rup main pariyojna kii upyogita or pratishtha par sawaal uthaate hai
 Many university spokespersons discourage students from using any encyclopaedia in academic work as their primary source; Some specifically prohibit the use of Wikipedia

 khalis urdu jaanane waalon kii milkiyat samajhi jane vaali, nawabon-rakkasaon kii duniya main jhankati or shaayaron kii mahafilon main vaah-vaah kii daad par itaraati gazalon ko aam aadmi tak pahunchane kaa shrey agar kisi ko pehle pahal diya janaa ho to jagajeet singh kaa hi naam zubaan par aata he
 His ghazals not only enhanced the understanding of shero-shayari among the lesser known Urdu scholars, but also introduced him to poets like Ghalib, Mir, Majaz, Josh and Firaq
 jagajeet singh ko san 2003 main bharat sarkaar dwaara kala ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 Two postage stamps were also released in your honor and memory in February 2014
 jagajeet ji kaa janm 8 farvari 1941 mratu 10oktubar 2011 ko rajasthan ke ganganagar main hua tha
 Father Sardar Amar Singh Dhamani was an employee of the Government of India
 jagajeet ji kaa parivaar multah punjab ke ropar zile ke dalla gaanv kaa rahane vaala he
 Mother Bachchan Kaur was from Uttalan village in Samrala, Punjab
 jagajeet kaa bachapan kaa naam jeet tha
 Due to crores of listeners, Singh sahib became Jagjit who won the Jag in a few decades
 shuruuaati shiksha ganganagar ke khalsa skool main hui or baad padhane ke liye jalandhar aa gaye
 Bachelor's degree from DAV College and then did post graduation in history from Kurukshetra University
 bahuton kii tarah jagajeet ji kaa pehla pyaar bhi paravaan nahin chadh sakaa
 Recalling those days, he says, "I wanted a girl
" jalandhar main padhai ke dauraan cycle par hi aana-janaa hota tha
 They used to sit in front of the girl's house pretending to break the cycle or remove air and used to watch her
 baad me yahi silsilaa bike ke saath jari rahaa
 Was not interested in studies
 kuch class me to do-do saal guzaare
” jalandhar main hi diavi college ke dinon girls college ke aasapaas bahut fatakate the
 Once, at the wedding of his cousin, he went to the meeting of a women's congregation and started singing
 puche jane par kehete hai ki singer nahin hote to dhobi hote
 It was a habit to watch movies without father's permission and sneak into the hall by punching the gate keeper in the talkies
 bachapan main apane pita se sangeet viraasat main mila
 It was in Ganganagar itself that he started learning classical music for two years under the leadership of Pandit Chhagan Lal Sharma
 aage jaakar sainiya gharaane ke ustad jamaal khan sahab se khyaal, thumari or dhrupad kii baarikiyaan sikhin
 The father wanted his son to go to the Indian Administrative Service, but Jagjit was keen to become a singer
 kurukshetra vishvavidhyalay main padhai ke dauraan sangeet main unki dilchaspee dekhakar kulapati profesar surajbhaan ne jagajeet singh ji ko kaafii utsahit kiya
 At his behest, he moved to Mumbai in 1965
 yahaan se sangharsh kaa daur shuru hua
 He used to stay as a paying guest and used to sing livelihood by singing jingles for advertisements or in wedding ceremonies etc
 1967 main jagajeet ji kii mulaaqaat chitra ji se hui
 The two tied the knot in 1969 after two years
 jagajeet singh filmi duniya main parshvagayan kaa sapana lekar aae the
 Then they used to give their offerings in college and high-profile parties to feed
 un dinon talat mahmud, mohammad rafi sahab jaison ke geet logon kii pasand hua karte the
 During the era of Maharashtrians like rafi-kishore-mannade, the opportunity of playback singing was far away
 jagajeet ji yaad karte hai, ”sangharsh ke dinon main college ke ladakon ko kush karne ke liye mujhe tarah-tarah ke gane gane padate the kyonki shastreey gaanon par ladke hoot kar dete the
 The then famous music company HMV needed music to stick to the light classical trend
 jagajeet ji ne vahi kiya or pehla elbum ‘da anforgatables ’ hit rahaa
 Jagjit ji remembers those days, saying, “it was a very good thing to get LP from a singer in those days
 ” bahut kam log jaanate hai ki sardaar jagajeet singh dhimaan isi elbum ke release ke pehle jagajeet singh ban chuke the
 He cut his hair to become the effective Jagjit Singh
 jagajeet ne is elbum kii kamyaabi ke baad mumbai main pehla flat karidaa tha
 When Jagjit Singh started singing ghazals like film songs, the common man started showing interest in ghazals but eyebrows of ghazals were crooked
 khaaskar ghazal kii duniya main jo mayaar begham akhtar, kundanlal sahagal, talat mahmud, mehadi hasan jaison kaa tha
 
 usase hatakar jagajeet singh kii style shuddhtavaadiyon ko raas nahin ai
 Actually this was the time when the common man started listening to ghazals by listening to singers like Jagjit Singh, Pankaj Udhas
 duusari taraf paramparaagat gayaki ke shaukeenon ko shastreeyta se hatakar nae gayakon ke ye prayog chubh rahe the
 It is alleged that Jagjit Singh tampered with Ghazal's purity and mood
 lekin jagajeet singh apni safaai main hameshaa kehete rahe hai ki unhone prastuti main thode badlaav zarur kiye hai lekin lafzon se chhedchhad bahut kam kiya he
 On most occasions, removing some heavy ghazal lions and covering it for six to seven minutes, he began to play double bass, guitar, and piano in music
 
yah bhi dhyaan dena chahie ki aadhunik or paashchaatya vaadyayantron ke istemaal main saarangi, tabalaa jaise paramparaagat saaj peeche nahin chute
 The experiment did not stop here, but the tabloid replaced the octoped, violin instead of the violin and the keyboard replaced the harmonium
 kehkashan or fes tu fes sangrahon main jagajeet ji ne anokhaa prayog kiya
 The chorus was used in some ghazals of both albums
 vinod khanna, dimple kapaadiya abhinit film 'lila' ke geet 'jaag ke kaati sari raina' main guitar kaa adbhut prayog kiya
 This album from the Jalal Aga-directed TV serial Kahakshan was the best performance in Mazaz Lakhanvi's 'awara' Nazm 'ae Gheme Dil Kya Koon Ae Wahshte Dil Kya Karoon' and 'face to Face' Do not burst into pranks in dairo-haram 
 jagajeet hi pehle ghazal gulukaar the jinhone chitra ji ke saath landan main pehali baar digital recording karte hue ‘biond time' album jari kiya
 Not only this, in addition to classical poetry, Jagjit ji also gave voice to the life of the common man in simple words
 ‘ab main rashan kii dukaanon par nazar aata hum’, ‘main royaa pardes main’, ‘maa sunaao mujhe wo kahani’ jaisi rachanaaon ne ghazal na sunne waalon ko bhi apni ore khinchaa
 Poets Nida Fazli, Bashir Badr, Gulzar, Javed Akhtar are among Jagjit Singh's favorite poets
 nida fazli ke dohon kaa elbum ‘insite’ kar chuke hai
 'silsile' with Javed Akhtar was a huge success
 lata mangeshkar ji ke saath ‘sajadaa’, gulzaar ke saath ‘marasim’ or ‘koi baat chale’, kehkashan, sound afair, difarent strokes or mirza gaalib ahm hai
 Jagjit Singh, who made crores of people crazy, gave his voice to the ghazals of the poets of every age, from mero-ghalib to faiz-firaq and from gulzar-nida Fazli to Rajesh Reddy and Alok Srivastava
 1981 main raman kumaar nirdeshit ‘premugit’ or 1982 main mahesh bhatta nirdeshit ‘arth’ ko bhala koun bhul saktaa he
 Jagjit ji gave music in 'earth'
 film kaa har gaanaa logon kii jubaan par chadh gaya tha
 After this, all attempts to give hit music in films failed miserably
 kuch saal pehle dimple kapadiya or vinod khanna abhinit film lila kaa sangeet ausat darze kaa rahaa
 Khudai in 1994, Billu Badshah in 1989, Kaanoon Ka Vahan in 1989, Raahi in 1987, Jwala in 1986, Clove Da Lashkara in 1986, Ravana in 1984 and Sitam Chale neither in 1982 nor films
 ye sari filmein un dinon ausat se kam darze kii filmein maani gayi
 It is obvious that Jagjit Singh played a lot of papad as a composer, but he failed to make good film songs
 iske ulat parshvagayak jagajeet ji sunne waalon ko sadaa jamate rahe hai
 His thunderous voice continued descending into the depths of the heart as if the hearts of both the listener and the listener were united
 kuch hit filmi geet ye rahe- 'lets touch my lips with the lyrics of love song' Amar Kar Do '' o Maa Tujhe Salaam 'of' Khalnayak '' Letter 'no message' from 'dushman' 'joggers Park' 'big delicate is this destination' Saath -with 'yeh Tera Ghar, Yeh Mera Ghar' and 'pyaar Mein Jo Jo Kiya Hai', 'what is the news to the senses of Sarfarosh', What is the absurdity of 'traffic signal' 'even if you do not touch the relationship' 'tum bin' '' No frayad is buried in your heart like 'veer Zara' Of 'you are coming close' of 'tarakib' of 'my eyes have chosen you seeing the world' bahut kam logon ko pataa hoga ki apane sangharsh ke dinon main jagajeet singh is kadar tut chuke the ki unhone sthapit plabac singron par tikhi tippanee tak kar di thi
 However, today they accept it as their mistake
 stattman likhata he ki, kishor da ne jagajeet singh ke us bayaan par coment kiya tha – ”how dare these so-called ghazal singers criticize an icon that Manna Dey, Mukesh and i dare not criticize
 Rafi was unique
” zaahir he jagajeet ji ne mahaan parshv gayak mohammad rafi sahab par jo kaha wo uchit nahin hoga
 It is also to be seen that the film songs of Jagjit ji of his choice were covered in the version album Close to My Heart
 
 There was no song of Rafi Sahab in it
 kair, iske baad unki dilchaspee raajnneeti main bhi badi or bharat-paak kargil ladaai ke dauraan unhone pakistan se aa rahi gayakon kii bheed par etraj kiya
 Then Jagjit Singh Ji said that his arrival should be banned
 darasal, jagajeet ji ko pakistan ne visa dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 
 lekin jab pakistan se bulaava aayaa tab jagajeet singh ji kii naaraazgi dur ho gai
 It was a blessing of this man that Jagjit helped to pay three lakh rupees for the treatment of Mehdi Hasan, the emperor of the Ghazals
 
 In those days Mehdi Hasan Saheb was ignored even by the Government of Pakistan

 After this, every day they fight with new spirits and get caught due to mistake
 yah ant tak isi prakaar ke pratidin ke kahani ke anusaar chalata rahata he
 Aerodynamics is the branch of kinetics in which the motion of air and other gaseous liquids and the forces acting on the moving solids relative to these fluids are discussed
 is vigyaan ke sarvaadhik mahatvapurn anuprayogon main se ek anuprayog vayuyan kii abhiklpana he
 Viscosity and compressibility are the two properties of all gases, at most
 teesraa guna samaangta kaa he
 Although air is made up of particulate matter, the error in assuming it to be a medium or a continuum is negligible unless it is highly sparse
 saantatya maane bina saidvantik upachaar praaia: asambhav sa hi he
 Viscous, ie frictionless, incompressible and homogeneous liquid is called perfect liquid
 jal or vaay dono ko paripurna taral mana ja saktaa he 
 Mathematical theories of aerodynamics of low velocity airflow are often similar to those of hydraulics
 vayugati vigyaan kii clishttar samasyaon kaa hal paripurna taral kii manyata par praapt hal main shyaantajanya atirikt prabhaav jod dene par mil jaataa he
 The most important principle in the aerodynamics of viscous fluids is the boundary level theory, based on which the interpretation of acceleration-friction-turbulence in a moving body in air
 jab vaayu main gativan pind kaa veg dhwani veg ke sameep aa jaataa he, yaa usase bhi adhik ho jaataa hai tab dhanatv or taap main parivartanon kaa prabhaav pind par kriyanvit dababalon kii vyakhya main mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Then the liquid cannot be considered incompressible and the correlation of pressure, density and temperature needs to be known
 sampidya pravaah ke vayugati vigyaan kaa vyaavhaarik anuprayog prakshepyon ke bahya kshepan vigyaan main or tivrgami vayuyanon athwa unke nodakon kii udaan-takneekee main he
 It has been used in power plant design, vapor turbine and gas turbine and jet-propulsion units for flow studies
 pindveg or tarleey dhwaniveg ke anupaat ko mek sankhya kehete hai
 Since the sound velocity in a liquid is a measure of the pressure change rate relative to the liquefaction, the make number m is an indicator of the compressibility of the liquid
 siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi m > 1, arthath paradhwanik pravaah main tund, vahini, athwa dhara rekhaon ke bich kshetrafal vegavardhan ke saath badhanaa chahie
 The opposite is for subclimate flows
 taral kii aisi gati ko, jisamen samay ke saath veg or disha koi nahin badalati, aparivarti pravaah kehete hai, anyathaa use parivarti pravaah kehete hai
 The oscillating flux or the back of a stationary blunt body is variable
 vayugativigyaan main vyavahrut adhikansh samasyaayen aparivarti pravaahvali hoti hai
 Flow is said to be monolithic, stereoscopic or stereoscopic according to the fact that the velocity, density and pressure are the function of only one, two or three celestials
 vaat surang kii dizine ek vim pravaah siddhant kaa anuprayog he
 In two dimensional plane flow, the speed lines, ie stream lines, will be either in the same plane or in parallel planes and then the planes will have momentum
 anant vistaaravaale pakshak par se pravaah dwivim hota he, kyonki pakshak ke anuprastha parichchhedon par tatsam pravaah milegaa
 If the sides are of limited expansion, then the stereoscopic flow is obtained
 jab veg itnaa kam ho ki vaayu ko drav ke samaan sampidya mana ja sake, to pravaah ko asampidya pravaah kehete hai
 In terms of velocity, the flow is said to be subaqueous, transatonic, transcendental, or hypercritical, according to the fact that the flow is less than, near, greater than, or greater than, the sound wave
 pindjnya dabasanketon kaa veg dhwaniveg se, agevale pind ke saapeksh uske veg ko ghataane par, yaa pechhevaale pind ke saapeksh uske veg ko jod dene par, praapt hota he
 The time is obtained by adding its velocity relative to the body
 kalantar main sanket akaash ke sabhi binduon par pahunch jate hai
 Transmission of pressure signals at extremely low subclassical velocities is symmetric in all directions and if the velocity of the pressure signals can be assumed to be infinite, the subclassic flow becomes incompressible flow
 paradhwanik pravaah main dabasanket aage nahin ja pate or kisi bindu vishesh par kaa vikshobh anupravah disha main "mek" shanku ke bheetar hi simit rahata he
 As Carmon has proved, the aerodynamics of superhuman flow corresponds to Newton's annularism in many respects
 rocket udaan ke vikaas ne atidhvanik pravaah ke adhyayan ko prerit kiya
 In this study there are many applications of conical flow, in which the fluid properties along a fundamental pointwise radius remain unchanged
 atyant hi viral gaison ke vayugativigyaan ko parmanugativigyaan kii sangya di gai he, kyonki ab pind ke vistaar kii tulana main gas kaa madhya muktapath upekshniya nahin rahata
 The first goal of representing aerodynamic phenomena by mathematical models is to know how the pressure on the body is distributed and the resultant forces and rotating actuations on the outer and inner pages of the aircraft, to make them of proper firmness 
 duusare, vayuyan ke ek ang par vayupravah kaa prakaar gyaat karnaa, jisase uske prabhaav kaa puchhprishth jaise anya angon par adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Minor-like liquids such as air become kinetic, but usually do not resolve
 atev vaimaaniki main prayog karke parinaam praapt kiye jate hai; kintu puure paimaanevaale pindon par prayog karnaa atyant vyay or shramsadhy he
 Their responses are seen in proper airflow by hanging small patterns of pests in the tunnel
 vaimaanik samasyaon main vaayu ko paripurna mana ja saktaa he
 In that case, it is a well-known fact that whatever the volume of the body, or its velocity, or the density of the liquid, will be the generation of homogeneous airflows from homogeneously moving bodies
 drav taral ke liye bhi yah satya he
 If velocities larger than 400 mph are encountered, then for symmetry, it is important to keep in mind that the velocities in aquifer experiments have the same ratio of aqueous soundwave as those in airborne experiments, ie the water velocities are approximately four times that of air velocities
 Are
 shyanta se prabhavit taral pravahon main samarupata ke liye aavashyak he ki donon kii renold sankhya, pvl m, vahi rahe
 Here m is the viscosity of the liquid, r its density, v the velocity of the body passing through it and 1 is the appropriate length defining the volume of that body, such as its length for the aircraft and its diameter for the sphere
 yadi kisi pravaah kii renold sankhya laghu he, jo us gati main shyanta kaa mahatvapurn prabhaav hoga or vah sire, yaa baari tel, ke jaisaa pravaah degaa
 One of the conclusions of the theory of presumptive liquid is that if a body moves in a liquid that is only left at rest due to the body, then the flow type of the body is uniquely determined by the size and speed of the body
 And the resultant pressure that the liquid exerts at different points on the body is zero, even if their moment is not zero
 yah sthiti vayuyan pakshak jaise chapate supravahee pind par uplabdh hoti he
 Whatever remains for a few years is only due to acceleration, ie the tangential forces exerted on the surface
 badi renold sankhyawaale pravahon main tvakgharshan pindprishth se lagi atyant patali parat main, jise parisima str kehete hai, simit rahata he
 The flow within this level is extremely complex
 str ke baahar kaa pravaah dhararekhi ashyaan taral jaisaa hota he
 As long as the angle of velocity of the liner is not excessive, the liner will have a flowing current, the head will be low and the lifting force will be applied to the liner, which will increase with the emergency angle
 yadi apaat kone ek seemaa se bad jaataa he, to pravaah dhararekhi na rahakar vikshubdh ho jaataa he or paksh avyavasthit hone lagata he ; karsh ekadam bae jaataa he or utthapak bal apaat kone ke badhane par kuch kam hone lagata he
 Theoretical interpretation of forces is complicated even at low emergency angles; Particularly in the aspect of finite magnitude, one has to consider induced waves, lateral waves, etc
 mukt udaan main sthayitv kii samasya bhi upasthit ho jaati he
 His discussion in flight science is of utmost importance

 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government
 isi kram main 1861 main elexander kaningham ke nirdesan main bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai

 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area

 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier

 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
