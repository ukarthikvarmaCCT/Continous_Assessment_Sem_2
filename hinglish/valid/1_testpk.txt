 To persuade the Senate, he expressed sorrow on behalf of the senator who was not found sitting in a crowded place in Putoli: isaki pratikriya main seenet ne yah faisla sunaaya ki, jab bhi koi saarvajanik sho kahin hoga to siton kii pehali pankti seenetteron ke liye arakshit kii jaani chahie; or rome main vah sahyogi deshon ke pratinidhiyon ko orcestra main baithne kii anumati nahin hogi, kyonki unhen bataaya gaya ki kabhi-kabhi mukt vyaktiyon ko bhi niyukt kiya gaya tha
 He separated the military qualities from the public

 It did not allow women to see gladiators from anywhere except the upper seats, although it was a tradition for men and women to sit together in such shows

 Therefore the gladiator, no matter how weak a heart, must offer his neck to his opponent during the entire battle and the waving sword holds the key

 They refer to themselves as "yolmowa" or "hyolmopa", and live natively in the Helimbu and Melamchi valleys and surrounding areas of northeast Nepal

 They are traditionally known to wear chuba, which shares traditional Tibetan attire with their names and many stylistic cues
 However, a large number of the natives of Yolmos are Nepal, especially Tarkeghyang, Milimchim Gaon, Sermathang, Dhana, Sarkathali among others, preferring to wear tour-suruwal, the national dress of Nepal

 The Yolmos belonging to an ethnic group are the inhabitants of the original Yolmo from Kagate who stem from the Hellembu and Melamchi valleys
 What distinguishes them from others is that Kagate began migrating from the southeast to Helambu, and finally, to the Ramechhap district more than 100 years ago, and that they practiced craft paper making during their peregrinations in order to make a living - Earned the nickname "kagate"
 Some of the characteristics they have developed since are different from their speech in the traditional Yolmo
 The Yolmo speaking groups of Lamjung district and Ilam district were also historically called "kagate" although the two groups claim to have a clear distinction between themselves and Kagate's Ramechhap
 However, "yolmo" and "kagate" are frequently used words as both for the ethnic group and their dialect interchangeably

 Inevitably, Yolmo people are farmers
 Potatoes, radishes, and some other crops, along with their primary sustenance, flock to yaks from milk and meat to which Yolmos are known
 In the last few decades, the Helmbu region has also become a popular site for tourism and trekking, and many Yolmos are now employed in the tourism industry, as tour guides either in their own respective villages or in various other parts

 For centuries, Tibetan Buddhists have referred to the Helambu region using the word "yolmo"
 In recent years, most people, like Yolmos and otherwise, seem to prefer the name "helmbu" itself
