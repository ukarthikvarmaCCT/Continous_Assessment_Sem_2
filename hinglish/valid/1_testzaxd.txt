hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he
 Evidence of severe firefighting has also been obtained
 mohenzodaro ke ek kamare se 14 nar kankal mili he jo akraman, aagjanee, mahamari ke sanket he
 a well and bath house located in the city of Indus Valley Civilization ek bail ke murti a drain located in the ancient city of Lothal laal mitti se bane ek paatr ke avshesh Ritual character raagi manni ek kannada khaanaa he

 Thanks in advance, Felagund, he wiki ambassador
 "stub" or "sabstub" angrezi boli he
 i think that using such English alphas makes it a little difficult to understand the article
 ham inke liye zarur koi hindi shabd izaad kar sakate hai! If i offer my opinion, we can use "seed" instead of "stub" and "seed" instead of "substub"
 yelekh kii haalat ko saafe-shafaaf bayan karte hai, or viki-kalpana ko bhi pesh karte hai
 We did something similar on Nynorsk Wikipedia
 ye bas meraa khyaal tha - agar aap ko pasand na aae to koi baat nahin
 - Arvind 15:21, 9 June 2006 mere khyaal se mudda yah rahaa he ki "stub" yaa "sabstub" jaise shabd hindi prayoktaaon ke liye myne nahin rakhte
 But having ornate words like "sprout" or "plant" will also not be of much benefit because these words of new users or readers will be as unknown as the stub
 behatar ho yadi sidhaa arth samajhane vaale shabd liye jaayen, jaise sabstub ke liye "aparipakv" or stub ke liye "praarambhik" yaa "aarambhik" yaa "aadhaar"
 If you write "this is a base article" or "this is an immature article" then the meaning will be more clear
 debashish kii batoo kaa samarthan karata hoon
 Words should be simple
 "aparipakv" shabd se lag saktaa he jo stub nahi he ve paripakv he or yogadan na bhi mili to thik he
 So the term "base article" would be more appropriate
 agar shabd se aisa lage ki lekh ko badhaana chahie to or bhi zyada upyukt hoga
 The funny word could have been "kid article"
 :) agar koi anya shabd nahi sujhaayaa gaya to meraa mat abhi tak to "aadhaar lekh" par he, magar aisa lagata he or upyukt shabd ho saktaa he

 We need to do everything we can to help them contribute more easily
 Sorry for leaving this message in English, i make too many errors and it takes too long for me to write this much in Hindi
 Hello, i want to say two things here
 Typing is definitely one of the biggest blockers for contributors but i think that enough good options are available now
 On my talk page on English wikipedia, when dagizza invited me to contribute to Hindi Wikipedia, he gave me some links, some of which i like very much
 i am reposting part of his message here: i have some sites that convert online -> 
 i also have some sites where you can download a simple converter

 is upaay se hui kami ko puraa karne ke liye £ 1million se adhik kii sampatti kii kharid par 4% se 5% tak mudrank shulk main vruddhi kar di gai
 Although the federal government used to impose stamp duty on documents like deeds, notes and other transaction papers in the past, in modern times such taxes are levied only by the states
 visheshkar jab achal sampatti sthanantarit kii jaati he yaa bechi jaati he, tab ek achal sampatti hastantaran kar saarvajanik record main panjikrut karte samay lagaaya jaataa he
 In addition, many states impose taxes on documents in the case of loans taken or on real estate

 kailash satyaarthee Malala Yusufzai is known for being a child rights activist
 vah pakistan ke kaibar-pakhtuunakva praant ke swat jile main sthit mingora shahar kii ek chaatra he
 At the age of 13, she became a heroine among the people of Swat by blogging for the BBC under a pseudonym about the atrocities of the tehreek-e-taliban regime
 oktober 2012 main, maatr 14 varsh kii aayu main apane udaaravaadi prayaason ke kaaran ve aatankwaadiyon ke hamale kaa shikaar bani, jisase ve buree tarah ghayal ho gai or antarrashtriya media kii surkhiyon main aa gai
 Malala lives in Yusufzai Mingora, the main city of Swat
 mingora par taliban ne march 2009 se may 2009 tak kabja kar rakhaa tha, jab tak kii pakistani sena ne kshetra kaa niyantran hasil karne ke liye abhiyaan shuru kiya
 During the struggle, Malala started writing diaries at the age of 11
 varsh 2009 main chhadam naam "gul makai" ke tahat bibisi urdu ke liye diary likh malala pehali baar duniya kii nazar main ai thi
 In which he described Taliban's misdeeds in Swat and described his pain in a diary
 diary likhane kii shaukeen malala ne apni diary main likhaa tha, 'aaj skool kaa aakhri din tha isliye hamane maidan par kuch zyada der khilne kaa faisalaa kiya
 i believe that one day the school will open but on the way to leaving i saw the school building as if i will never come here again
 ' Malala has received numerous threats since the time she began writing about the excesses of the Taliban in blogs and media
 malala ne taliban ke kattar farmaanon se judi dardanaak dastaanon ko mahaj 11 saal kii umr main apni kalam ke jariye logon ke saamne laane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Malala is one of the aggrieved girls who were denied school for long due to Taliban decree
 teen saal pehle swat ghati main taliban ne ladakiyon ke skool jane par pabandi laga di thi
 Girls were also forbidden to watch TV programs
 swat ghati main talibaniyon kaa kabja tha or skool se lekar kai chizon par pabandi thi
 Malala also succumbed to it
 lekin apni diary ke madhyam se malala ne kshetra ke logon ko na sirf jaagruk kiya balki taliban ke khilaaf khadaa bhi kiya
 The Taliban took Swat into control in 2007
 or lagaataar kabje main rakhaa
 The Taliban closed the girls' schools
 car main mujeec se lekar sadak par khilne tak par pabandi laga di gai thi
 The girl wrote a diary for the BBC Urdu service in January 2009, based on her experiences of that period
 isamen usne zikr kiya tha ki tivi dekhne par roak ke chalate vah apana pasandida bhartiya serial raja kii aegi baraat nahin dekh paati thi
 In 2009, New York Times also made a film on Malala
 swat main taliban kaa aatank or mahilaon kii shiksha par pratibandh vishay par bani is film ke dauraan malala khud ko roak nahin pai or camere ke saamne hi rone lagi
 Malala was dreaming of becoming a doctor and the Taliban targeted her
 us dauraan do sau ladakiyon ke skool ko taliban se dhaha diya tha
 In 2009, the Taliban had clearly stated that not a single girl would go to school after January 15
 yadi koi is fatve ko maanane se inkaar karata he to apni maut ke liye vah khud jimmedaar hogi
 When the Taliban terror in Swat subsided, Malala's identity was revealed to the world and she was awarded an award for bravery
 isi ke saath vah international children pis award ke liye bhi namit hui
 
 pakistan kii ‘new neshnal pis prise’ hasil karne vaali 14 varshiya malala yusufajai ne taliban ke farmaan ke baavjood ladakiyon ko shikshit karne kaa abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he
 Taliban terrorists were angry with this and took him on their hit list

 He supported the secular government in the Swat region
 isi vajah se yah hamaari hit list main hai

 Who was very beautiful in appearance, the king was very pleased and he named the temple after the same sculptor "ramappa Temple", it is probably the only temple in the world that is not named after God but in the name of his artisan
 
 kuch varshon pehle logo ko dhyaan main aayaa ki yah mandir itnaa purana he fir bhi yah tuutata kyon nahin jab ki is ke baad main bane mandir khandhar ho chuke he
 If this thing fell in the ears of archaeological scientists, they went to Palampet and examined the temple and found that the temple is indeed very strong according to its age
 kaafii koshishon ke baad bhi visheshgy yah pataa nahin laga sake ki uski majbooti kaa rahasy kya he, fir unhonen mandir ke pathar ke ek tukade ko kaata to paaya ki pathar vajan main bahut halkaa he, unhone pathar ke us tukade ko pani main daalaa to vah tukdaa pani main tairne laga yani yahan archimedes kaa siddhant galat sabit ho gaya
 Then the secret of the strength of the temple came to know that all other temples were broken due to the weight of their stones, but the weight of Ramappa temple stones is very less, due to this the temple does not break
 ab tak vaigyanik us pathar kaa rahasy pataa nahin kar sake ki ramppa yah pathar laaye kahan se kyon ki is tarah ke pathar vishwa main kahin nahin paye jate jo pani main tairte hon
 to fir kya ramppa ne 800 varsh pehle ye pathar khud banaaye? agar haan to wo koun si takanic thi unke paas!! wo bhi 800-900 varsh pehle xxrep 5 ! Ramappa or Ram Lingeshwar Temple 70 km from Warangal in Andhra Pradesh

 is pranali ke aadhaar par bhi varsh ke ant main laabh-haani khaataa tathaa aarthik chittha banaaya jaataa he
 The main objective of financial accounting is to identify, measure, write, transmit financial information as well as record business transactions in the books of accounts in such a way that the operational results of the business for a fixed period can be known and on a fixed date
 Economic status has to be ascertained
 laagat lekhankan laagton ke lekhe karne kii ek aisi prakriya he jo aay va vyay, athwa un aadhaaron ke jin par unka pariklan kiya jaataa he, ke abhilekhan se armbh hoti he tathaa sankhyikeey samankon ke taiyaar hone ke saath hi samaapt ho jaati he
 This accounting method also considers current costs as well as future expenses
 prabandh lekhankan se taatpary lekhankan evam sankhyikeey pravidhiyon kii soochna ko prastut karne evam nirvachan karne ke vishisht uddeshy ke liye prayog se he
 It is designed to bring maximum efficiency to the information managers and to assist in the task of measuring their performance after considering, projecting and coordinating future plans
 agar hamen kisi upkram kii sthirataa, vikaas or laabhadaayakta sunishchit kerani ho to uski maanav sampatti se adhik mahatvapurn anya koi sampatti nahin he
 Its importance can be easily understood when other means of production such as capital, materials, torches, etc
 are all available and workers are not available
 itnaa hote hue bhi is mahatvapurn sampatti kaa lekhankan evam moolyankan aarthik chitthey main kisi bhi prakaar parilakshith nahin hota he
 As a result, the comparison of the economic results of the two firms on the basis of mere capital on appropriation etc
 is incomplete and sometimes misleading
 lekhankan main is kami ko dur karne ke liye maanav sansaadhan moolyankan evam lekhon main darj kar vittiya parinaamon main pradarshit karne kii ek nayi pranali viksit hui he jise maanav sansaadhan lekhankan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the Human Accounting Accounting Committee of the American Accounting Association, "human resource accounting is the process of identifying human resources, measuring it in the form of data, and organizing this information to the relevant parties
 ’’ If we look at the long-term price situation of the past, one thing is universally clear that the value of every item in the world has generally increased
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad mulya suchakaankon main parivartan kii gati behad teevr hui
 This inflationary situation made the comparability of economic outcomes in the commercial world redundant
 mudra sfiti ke is dushprinaam kaa prabhaav shunya par vaastavik parinaamon kii jaankaree karne ke liye mudra sfiti mulya suchakankaan kii sahaayta se laabh-haani khate ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or isi prakaar se chitthey main sthaayee sampattiyon ke mulyon ko samyojit kiya jaataa he
 Final accounts are also prepared by revaluation
 vartmaan main is lekhankan kii do vidhiyaan-vartmaan laagat lekhankan tathaa vartmaan kray shakti lekhankan prachlan main he
 In the present few decades, the ideology of social responsibility has emerged in business
 badalte hue saamaajik mulyon or aashaaon ne samaaj main vyavsaay kii bhoomika ke bare main vichaar ko badhaaya he or yah vichaar vyavsaay ke saamaajik daayitv kii prakruti par kendrit ho gaya he
 It has been assumed that this liability can be met by social obligation accounting, a form of accounting
 chunki vyavsaay utpaadan ke saadhan sthaneey sroton se praapt karnaa he atah paryaavaran main uske kaaran anek hanikaarak parivartan hote hai
 Under social accounting, a business can show the extent to which it has carried out social responsibilities by creating a social profit-loss account and social letter
 lekhankan kaa mul uddeshy sanstha main hit rakhane vaale aantarik tathaa bahya pakshakaron ko aavashyak suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 But what information a party needs, it depends on the nature of interest in his business
 vibhinn pakshakaron kii drushti se aavashyak lekhankan soochna kaa vivechan is prakaar he- Owners arrange funds for the running of the business, hence they want to know that they have appropriated the funds provided by them
 us kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti jaanane ke liye lekhankan suchanaaen chaahate hai
 Such information is provided from time to time by financial statements prepared from accounting records
 duusare se kaary karwaane kii kala hi prabandh he
 Therefore, the management should ensure that its subordinate employees are doing proper work or not
 is sambandh main lekhankan suchanaaen bahut sahaayak hoti hai kyonki isse prabandhak karmchaariyon ke nishpaadan kaa moolyankan kar saktaa he
 Corrective action can be taken by comparing actual performance of employees with pre-determined standards, if actual performance is not of the desired level
 vastav main lekhankan suchanaaen hi prabandh kii vittiya niti, niyojan evam niyantran kaa aadhaar hoti hai
 Appropriators include potential shareholders and long-term lenders
 inkaa hit apane viniyog kii suraksha tathaa us par paryaapt aay praapt karnaa hota he
 They therefore require accounting information to evaluate the past performance of the institution and to explore future prospects, so the employers rely on accounting information included in the financial statements for their investment decisions
 ve jis sanstha main viniyog karnaa chaahate hai, lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par us sanstha kii laabhadaayakta evam vittiya sthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Creditors include sellers of goods, bankers and other lenders
 ye rin dene se purv sanstha kii vittiya sthiti jaananaa chaahate hai tathaa is baat se aashwast hona chaahate hai ki sanstha samay par rinon kaa bhugtan kar degi
 In other words, the liquid position of the institution is satisfactory
 sanstha kii taralata sthiti kii jaankaree ke liye inhen chaalu sampattiyon, taral sampattiyon tathaa chaalu dayitvon sambandhi lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo inhen sanstha ke vittiya vivaranon se uplabdh hoti he
 Various government departments and agencies like Company Law Board, Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department, Wing Market etc
 are also interested in financial information of companies
 in agensiyon kaa uddeshy yah aashwast karnaa hota he ki company ne apane lekhon main kar, labhaansh, hris aadi ke sambandh main adhinium kii vyavasthaaon kaa paalan kiya he athwa nahin tathaa apane laabhon evam vittiya sthiti ko sahi va sachche dhang se prastut kiya he athwa nahin
 The government determines the tax payable capacity of business entities on the basis of information received from the statement of accounts
 ye suchanaaen sarkaar kii bhavi kar niti, utpaadan, mulya niyantran, anudaan, license, aayaat-niryaat niti main di jane vaali suvidhaayen aadi kaa aadhaar hoti he
 The government also requires accounting information of business entities to determine national income
 kabhi kabhi sanstha ke utpaadon kaa mulya nirdhaarit karne ke liye bhi moolyankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upabhoktaaon evam utpaadakon kaa shoshan na ho sake
 Employees are interested in the economic soundness of the institution as the payment of bonuses depends on the benefits earned
 iske atirikt niyoktaaon or shram sanghon ke bich samuhik saudebaaji lekhankan soochnaaon ke aadhaar par hi kii jaati he
 Accounting information, which is said to mirror the financial performance of a business institution, is very valuable to researchers
 ek kaary vishesh kii vittiya kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye shodhakartaaon ko kray, vikray, chaalu sampatti evam daayitv, sthaayee sampattiyaan, dirghakaalin daayitv, swaamiyon ke kosh aadi ke bare main vistrut lekhankan soochnaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, aisi suchanaaen sanstha dwaara rakhe gayi lekhankan abhilekhon se hi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 Each transaction has two aspects or parties
 khaataa-bahi main prayek paksh kaa ek khaataa banaaya jaataa he
 An account is that part of an ledger in which a collective statement of transactions made in relation to a person, goods or services is written
 is prakaar prayek khate kii sthiti kaa pataa lag jaataa he ki vah khaataa lender he tathaa dendar 
 According to the dual system it is necessary to know the classification of accounts in order to write transactions in sources
 jin khaaton kaa sambandh kisi vishesh vyakti se hota he, ve vyaktigat khate kehalaate hai
 An individual means an individual, firm, company and any other type of business entity
 duusare shabdon main, sab lendaaron tathaa dendaaron ke khate vyaktigat khate hote hai
 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business
 is prakaar aaharan khaataa bhi vyaktigat khaataa hota he
 Accounts of goods and property are called real accounts
 in khaaton ko vaastavik isliye kaha jaataa he ki inamen varnit vasteen, vishesh sampatti ke rup main vyapaar main prayog kii jaati he
 The merchant can convert his capital into money by selling them when needed
 vaastavik khate aarthik chitthey main sampatti kii tarah dikhaaye jate hai
 Such as machines, buildings, goods, machinery, furniture, cash and banks etc
 are the actual accounts
 in khaaton ko avastavik khate bhi kehete hai
 Business consists of many expenditure items, income items and profit or loss items
 in sabake liye alag-alag khate banate hai jinako ‘nammaatr’ ke khate kehete hai
 They have no tangible basis like personal or real accounts
 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
 baayen haath kii ore bhaag ‘rini paksh’ hota he or daahine haath kii ore kaa bhaag ‘dhani paksh’ hota he
 Debit or credit to accounts - When an account is a 'lane' party in a transaction, that is, it gets debited then the accounts are debited
 debit karne kaa matlab yah he ki khate ke rini bhaag main lenden kaa lekha hoga
 Similarly, when an account is a party to a transaction, that is, someone gains something from it, then that account is credited
 arthath us khate ke credit bhaag main lenden kaa lekha kiya jayega
 In this transaction one account and another account are credited in this way
 debit khate main debit kii ore lekha tathaa credit khate main credit kii ore lekha hota he
 Credit and debit accounting is done for every transaction according to double account system
 udhaaharan - yadi hamane mohan se 100 rupaye kaa maal kharida he to isamen do khate hue- ek maal kaa doosraa mohan kaa
 One account will be done in the account of the receiver ie goods account and the other account will be done in the account of the recipient ie Mohan
 isi kaaran is pranali ko dohare lekhe kii pranali kaha gaya he
 Each transaction has two accounts, a debit and a credit

 There are very few astronomers who do both because different fields require different proficiency, but most professional astronomers find themselves on one of the two sides
 khagoliki brahmad main avasthit akashiya pindon kaa prakaash, udbhav, sanrachana or unke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan khagoliki kaa vishay he
 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system
 sthaneey nakshatra pranali akaash ganga ke antargat prati second 200 mile kii gati se chal rahi he or sampurna akaash ganga duurastha bahya jyortimalaon ke antargat prati second 100 mile kii gati se vibhinn dishaao main gum rahi he
 The Moon is a satellite of the Earth on which human steps have reached
 is brahmad main sabase vismayakari drishy he- akaash ganga kaa drishy
 Every person can see them with naked eyes in the open sky of night
 dekhne main yah halke safed dhuen jaisi dikhaai detii he, jisamen asankhya taron kaa bahulya he
 This sky Ganga is crooked
 iskaa pravaah uttar se dakshin kii ore he
 But just before dawn, it flows from northeast to west and south
 dekhne main akaash ganga ke taare paraspar sambhddha se lagate hai, par yah drushti bhram he
 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana
 Apart from this, it is not possible to express the vastness, generality of the universe in other words

 These are called star clusters or gluteular stars ie Tara Clusters

 Due to modern discoveries, as the capacity of binoculars increases, the range of this visible region of the universe increases
 parantu vartmaan paridrishy main brahmad kii puri thaah maanav kshamta se bahut dur he
 The modern era of astrophysics began with the German physicist Kirchak
 surya ke vaataavaran main sodium, louh, magnesium, calcium tathaa anek anya tatwon kaa unhone pataa lagaaya 
 In our country, the late Professor Meghnad Saha has done important work in the study of physical elements of the Sun and stars

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 There is only one species in the Ashwansh, which has horses, donkeys and zebras
 inke atirikt is prajati main ve sab lupt jantu bhi hai jo ghode ke purvaj maane jate hai
 As with other venomous creatures - rhinoceros and tapirs - the animals of the Ashwansh have a more slim and agile body
 vaigyanikon kaa vishwaas he ki aarambh main ghode bhi mandagami or pattee khaanevaale jeev the
 As less and less leaves started falling, the horses started eating more and more grass
 tab unke daanton kaa vikaas is prakaar hua ki ve kadi kadi ghaasein acchhee tarah chaba saken
 Here, to avoid predatory creatures like wolves, the fingers of their four legs and legs and the whole body developed so that they could run away and save themselves
 is prakaar unke pairon kii agal bagalvaali anguliyaan choti hoti gai or bich kii anguli ekal khur main parinat ho gai
 This theory is fully supported by the Jovasham found in the land

 In the Middle Age, the fifth toe of the next toe was not rendered useless, but the corners had become somewhat wide

 Only three fingers could work on the fingers of the front leg, the fingers on the side were so small that they could not even touch the ground
 bich kii anguli bahut moti or pusht ho gai thi
 In the Middle Age, the teeth grew bigger than before and the teeth adjacent to the chaubhad became like the chaubhad
 saamne ke pair kii bichwali anguli khur main badal gai or agal bagal kii koi anguli bhoomi ko nahin chhu paati thi
 The teeth became longer in the modern era and their shape became like the teeth of modern horses
 saamne kaa khur or bhi bada ho gaya or agal bagal kii anguliyaan adhik choti or bekaar ho gai
 In the pre-modern era, the horse became like a modern horse
 uske jeevashm us yug ke pattharon main america main mili hai
 Since this period, fossils of horse have been found in abundance in India and other parts of Asia and Africa
 jab ki daanton or khuron kaa vikaas hota rahaa tab tak sharir ke aakaar main bhi vruddhi hoti rahi
 The vertebrae of the cervix and the skull of the mouth also grew; Therefore, the shape of the horse also changed

 muhaavara mulat: arabi bhashaa kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he baatcheet karnaa yaa uttar dena
 Some people call the idiom 'everyday', 'colloquial', 'tarzeclam', or 'istalah', but neither of these words could become a complete synonym of 'idiom'
 sanskrit vaanmay main muhaavara kaa samanarthak koi shabd nahin paaya jaataa
 Some people use 'utility', 'vagriti', 'vagdhara' or 'bhasha-sampradaya' for this
 ve0es0 apte ne apane ‘inglish-sanskrit kosh’ main muhaavarey ke paryaayavachi shabdon main ‘vaak-paddati', ‘vaak reeti’, ‘vaak-vyavhaar’ or ‘vishisht swaroop' ko likhaa he
 Paradkar has considered 'speech-community' as a synonym for idioms
 kaaka kalelkar ne ‘vaak-prachaar’ ko ‘muhaavarey’ ke liye ‘roodhi’ shabd kaa suzav diya he
 In Greek, the idiom is called 'idioma', 'indiatisme' in French and 'idiam' in English

 The use of idioms brings wonderful pictoriality to the language
 muhaavaron ke bina bhashaa nistej, neeras or nishpraan ho jaati he
 In Hindi language, very popular and people's sentences are known as proverbs
 in vaakyon main janata ke anubhav kaa nichod yaa saar hota he
 Different scholars have defined 'idioms' in different ways, some of which are given here: dow udai narayan tiwari ne likhaa he- In 'advanced Learners Dictionary', AS Hornby wrote that 'chambers tuventith centuri dictionari' ke anusaar, According to the Oxford Concise Dictionary, ‘muhaavara’ kii sabase adhik vyapak tathaa santoshajanak paribhaasha dow omprakash gupt ne nimna shabdon main di he : The idioms are the foundation stones of the language on which his grand building has remained till date, and the idioms have been protecting him from the ravages of summer, winter and rain, while correcting his wear and tear

 Use of them brings pictoriality in the language, such as hitting an ax on their feet, pressing a finger under the teeth, having a wolf, etc
 shabdon kii teen shaktiyaan hoti hai : When a word or group of words is used in a general sense, then there is its design power
 abhidha dwaara abhivyakti arth ko abhidheyarth yaa mukhyarth kehete hai; jaise ‘sir par chadhana’ kaa arth kisi cheez ko kisi sthaan se uthaa kar sir par rakhana hoga
 But when there is no realization of the main purpose and due to stereotypes or famousness or knowledge of any other meaning related to the main purpose, then the power through which it happens is called the symptom
 yah shakti ‘arpit’ arthath kalpit hoti he
 That is why Vishwanath wrote in 'sahityadarpan': lakshana se ‘sir par chadhane’ kaa arth aadar dena hoga
 Mammatt has also supported his opinion in 'poetic light' and in more comprehensible words
 udaahranarth, ‘‘angaaron par lotna’, ‘aankh maarna’, ‘aankhon main raat kaatna’, ‘aag se khelnaa’, ‘aasmaan par diya jalaana’, ‘doodh-ghi kii nadiyaan bahaanaa’, ‘khun chusna’, ‘chaiyn kii banshi bajaanaa’, ‘tahaakaa lagaana’, ‘lambi baanh hona’, ‘vijay kaa danka bajaanaa’ or sher bananaa’ aadi main lakshana shakti kaa prayog hua he
 So, they are idioms
 parantu is sandarbh se yah drashtavy he ki lakshana ke samast udhaaharan muhaavarey ke antargat nahin aa sakate
 Only those examples of symptoms can come under idioms which have become stereotyped or famous due to chronic practice
 jab abhidha or lakshana apana kaam karke virat ho jaati hai tab jis shakti se shabd-samoohon yaa vaakyon ke kisi arth kii soochna milti he use ‘vyanjana’ kehete hai
 The sarcasm that occurs in idioms is not due to the meaning of one word but to the chained meanings of all the words, or to say that it lives in the meaning of the whole idiom
 is prakaar ‘sir par chadhana’ muhaavarey kaa vyangyarth na to ‘sir’ par nirbhar karata he na ‘chadhaane’ par varan puure muhaavarey kaa arth hota he ‘uchhrunkhal, anushaasanheen athwa dheeth bananaa
 'it is different from satirical meaning and expression expression meaning
 anek muhaavarey main alankaaron kaa prayog hua rahata he
 But this does not mean that every idiom is a rhetorical, or every rhetorical phrase is an idiom
 neeche kuch muhaavarey die jate hai jinamein alankaaron kaa prayog hua he : Being red ember, money is manhood and masculinity is money, embers rain, gold is gold, etc
 idhar-udhar karnaa, oonch-neech dekhnaa, daaen-baayen na dekhnaa, pani se pyaas na bujhna
 Breaking the bangle, wearing the bangle, having a lamp, increasing the shop, being full of demand and womb, etc
 shabdalankarmulak muhaavarey anjar-panjar deele hona, aany-vaayam-shany bakna, kaccha-pakkaa, der-saver, boria-bistar baandhna, aadi
 Some idioms are based on practices; To take the lead
 madhya yug main raaj-darbaron main yah pratha thi ki jab koi dushkar kaary karnaa hota tha tab samanton or veeron aadi ko bulaakar unhen uske sambandh main sab baaten bataa di jaati thim or thali main paan rakh diya jaataa tha
 The hero who took the responsibility to do that work, he would take the platter from the plate
 kuch muhaavarey kahaniyon par aadhaarit hote the, jaise tedi kheer hona, dhaporshankh hona, sone kaa mrug hona, aadi
 Sometimes proper nouns are used like caste nouns to create idioms; Like - sleep of Kumbhakaran, Draupadi rip, Jaichand, becoming Yudhishthira, Vibhishana, becoming Harishchandra, etc
 jab manushya prabal bhavavesh main hote hai tab unke munh se kuch aspasht dhvaniyaan nikal jaati hai jo baad main kisi ek arth main rudh ho jaati hai or muhaavarey kahalaane lagati hai
 The following are examples of idioms based on some such expressions and the sounds emanating from them: tara-tara karnaa, bhon-bhon karnaa, main-main karnaa, aadi
 Kaw-kaw kan, kukdu-kun speak, bhinna go, etc
 phus-phus karnaa, phus-phus hona, aadi
 To-morrow sar-saraahat hona, sany-sany karnaa, aadi
 Physical gestures evoke emotion and some idioms are formed on the basis of them; Such as chest pitting or beating, gnashing of teeth, dancing, tail wagging, feet slapping, making mouth, giving a mustache, etc
 achaanak kisi sankat main aane se sambandhit muhaavarey : aathon pahar suuli par rahanaa, aave kaa awa bigadanaa, kahin kaa na rahanaa, takadir footnaa, aadi
 Idioms emanating from the tendency of exaggeration: breaking the stars of the sky, fluttering the walls, shedding blood, etc
 bhashaa ko alankrita or prabhavotpadak banane ke prayaas se udbhut muhaavarey : id kaa chand hona, gooler kaa phool hona, sarson-sa phoolnaa, aadi
 Just now, sprinkle, spit, covertly, sesame and sesame, bit by bit, etc
 uthanaa-baithna, khaanaa-pinaa, padhaanaa-likhnaa, aadi
 Cloth-rags, stove-chowka, medicine-liquor, carrot-radish, river-stream, food-clothes, live-bread, etc
 daan-dahej, mail muhabbat hona, mail-mulaakaat rakhana, disha-maidan janaa, aadi
 From Sanskrit - Withdrawal with half-crescent: Ardhchandra datva nisarita
 jaale par namak chhidakna : kshate ksharmivasahyam
 From Persian and Urdu - one is able to be alive, to become infatuated, to be treasured by Karan, to be Kaifiyat, to be shiro-shakar
 angreji se - taash ke mahal kii tarah dhah janaa : fall or collapse like a house of card; ghode ke aage gaadi rakhana : put the cart before the horse; moorkhon kaa swarg : fool’s paradise
 Many idioms are based on someone's experience
 atev yadi unamem kisi prakaar kaa parivartan yaa ulatpher kiya jaataa he to unka anubhav-tatv nasht ho jaataa he
 For example, 'going to water' is an idiom, instead we cannot say 'to be water-water'
 aise hi 'gadhe ko baap bananaa' kii jagah par 'bail ko baap bananaa' or'matargashti karnaa' kii jagah par 'gehungshti' yaa 'chanaagashti' nahin kaha ja saktaa he

 drud charles dicans ke apurna upanyaas da mistry of edwin drud par aadhaarit ek sangeet naatak he
 It is written by Rupert Holmes and was the first mainstream musical drama to end in diversity
 Holmes won the Tony Award for Best Book and Best Original Musical Drama
 is sangeet naatak ne sarvshereshth sangeet naatak sahit 11 manonayanon main se paanch tony puraskaar jite
 The musical drama first appeared in August 1985 as a part of the New York Shakespeare Festival and was moved to Broadway after the revision, where it ran until May 1987
 This was followed by two national tours and was performed in London's West End
 haalanki sho kaa abhi tak mukhyadhara main punaruddhar kiya janaa baaki tha, yah kshetreey, shaukia or chaatr theatre companiyon main lokapriy bana hua he or isaki kai videshi prastutiyaan hui he
 The musical drama Drood is derived from three major inspirations: Charles Dickens's final novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood, British pantomime and music hall traditions, which reached the height of its popularity in the years following Dickens's death
 dicans kii mistry kaa 1870 main prakaashan shuru hua
 The book was written and published in installments at irregular intervals, which remained incomplete that year due to Dickens' sudden death from a heart attack
 mistry ke prati sankalp kii kami ne da mistry of edwin drud ko ek saahitiyik jigyaasa bana diya
 Almost immediately after the publication of Dickens' finale, various writers and playwrights tried to complete the story by adding their own endings: several "coauthors", material between the late Dickens and other novelists, until Drood's creation as a musical play
 Had several staged extrapolations and three film adaptations of the story

 Rupert Holmes spent his childhood in England making major creative contributions to the musical drama Drood
 At the age of three, he experienced theater for the first time when he was moved to a modern "panto", featuring the protagonist boy dressed in the opposite sex and singing with the audience
 kuch saal baad rahasy vaali pustakon main ek 11 varshiya ladke ke prati aakarshan paidaa hua, to homes ne pehle dicans ke adhure upanyaas kii khoj kii
 The profitable experiences of the two had a major impact on Holmes when he was first approached by show organizer Joseph Paup to write a new musical play
 ek prasiddh lokapriy geetkaar homes, jinke geeton ko barbara streisand kii tarah manchit kiya gaya tha or jinhone khud 1979 main # 1 hit "escape " kii recording karai thi, ne pehle pahal 1983 main sangeet naatak lekhan main dilchaspee dikhaai
 ek nite club main upasthiti ke baad, jis dauraan homes ne kuch manoranjak sachhee ghatnaon kii charchaa ke kram main apane kuch "katha sangeet" ke pradarshan kiye to homes ko neuyork shakespeare mahotsav main naatak vikaas nirdeshak gale mericield kaa ek note mila, jinhone homes ke pradarshan dekha tha or puri lambaai vaala sangeet naatak likhane kaa suzav diya
 Holmes imagined the show's central premise, feeling a vibe to pantomime memories and Dickens's novels, as well as Victorian-style music hall performances
 dicans ke kaam se homes ne kendriya ghatana or zyaadaatar chitrit paatr liye
 From the musical drama hall traditions he took the lead character of "the Chairman", who was like a master of ceremonies and an action instigator on stage
 mookabhinay se unhone 'lead byaay' kii avadharana " or drud ke sabase nayab paksh, darshakon kii bhagidaari, ko behaal rakhaa
 Drood is somewhat unusual given Holmes' passion for book writing, music, lyrics, and shows
 haalanki homes kaa vishwaas tha ki kisi broadway nirmaataa ne isse pehle aisa nahin kiya he or sho kii samikshaon or lekhon main is kartab ke aksar ullekh ke baavjood yah abhyaas sangeet naatak theatre ke praarambhik dinon main puri tarah se asaamaanya nahin tha
 Songwriters including Adolf Phillip have previously been credited with books on their musical plays
 However, the composers / librettists did not write their own orchestrations
 pustak likhane main homes ne apane iraadon par dicans kaa saaya nahin padane diya
 dicans kii lekhan style kii nakal karne ke bajaay, jiske bare main unhone mahasoos kiya ki jis tarah kaa sho vah likhnaa chaahate hai, uske liye yah niraashajanak hoga, homes ne "sho ke bheetar-sho" kii ek yukti nikaali
 drud ke cast sadasyon ne vishesh rup se dicans ke charitron kaa abhinay nahin kiya, balki iskaa abhinay sangeet naatak haul ke kalakaaron ne kiya, jo dicans ke charitron kaa pradarshan kar rahe the
 This tactic went a long way in incorporating lighthearted humor, which was not originally found in Dickens' novel, which would have been included in the show and not many songs that were unrelated to the original story
 is nirnay ko samajhaate hue homes ne kathith taur par kaha ki "yah sangeet ke liye nicholas nickelbai kaa set nahin he- yah dicencian kaam nahin he
 "it's lighthearted, fun and entertaining
 mujhe lagata he- lekin mujhe aashaa he ki dicans ko bhi isse mazaa aayaa hoga"
 homes ne yah bhi kaha bhi ki " yah dicans ke saath vaisaa hi rishta he, jo kis me ket kaa da teming of da sreeu se he
 "the pantomime concept allowed Holmes to cast a woman in the lead male role, which further gave her the opportunity to write a love song, to be sung by two loud-sounding singers
 ek sabase moulik vichaar ke rup main homes ne naatak ke parinaam ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek nayab tarika apanaaya; vah tha ant ke liye darshakon kaa matdaan
 sho ke madhyantar main darshak is par matdaan karte the ki drud ko kisne maaraa, rahasyamay dick datcheri kii pahchaan or ant main koun se do charitron main pyaar ho jayega, jisase ki ant sukhad hoga
 chunki har darshak swabhaav main alag he, iskaa parinaam saidhantik rup se yahaan tak ki abhinaytaon ke liye bhi apratyaashit hota he or unhen teji se voton kii gananaa kerani hoti he or chune hue ant ke hisaab se naatak ko puraa karnaa padataa he 
 is yojana se homes ko atirikt kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi, jinhen kai chote-chote ant likhane padate the, jo har sambhav matdaan parinaam ke mutabik chune ja saken
 There are many variations between musical plays and novels
 dicans kii mul pustak kaa swar kuch dhoomil tha jabaki sho ullekhneey rup se kaaphi manoranjak tha or kamedi ke liye khelaa jaataa tha
 Notable differences in characterization include Jasper: Although Dickens' character no doubt looks repressed and disturbing, he is not portrayed as completely double personified, as he should appear in a musical play
 kai chote charitra hataa diye jate hai or dusron kii bhoomika kaa vistaar hota he
 In the musical drama, Bazzard is an assistant to Crisparkle, while in the novel he is hired by Rosa's guardian, Mr
 Griulius
 is bich, naatak kii antarkriyasheeltaa badhaane or kaatil koun he, iskaa andeh paidaa karne ke liye sangeet naatak main upanyaas ke kai suraagon ko hataa diya jaataa he ki jasper hi hatyara he or un suraagon se parichay karaata he, jo upanyaas main dikhaai nahin dete or anya sandigdhon kii ore ishaara karte hai
 The first performance preparations for the expatriate troupe version of "the Mystery of Edwin Drood" are underway at London's Royale Music Drama Hall
 mandali ke sadsy darshak sadasyon ko dicans ke asamyik nidhan kii aitihaasik jaankaree dete hai or saath hi yah bhi bataate hai ki parinaam ko nirdhaarit karne main darshakon kii bhoomika hogi
 Artists from various theater locations sing the opening song: "there You Are
" The chairman, a sort of master of ceremonies, informs attendees that this is going to be an unusual build and he invites everyone to "be as naïve and rude as possible legally"
 is ghoshnaa ke saath naatak-ke-bheetar naatak shuru ho jaataa he
 The first Dickens character to be introduced is John Jasper, the Vrindagan leader, a 'respected' member of society and who tells the audience the fact that he is indeed suffering from inner pain
 This is followed by Jasper's nephew, Edwin Drood, who discusses his impending arranged marriage to Rosa Budd, as well as his plans to leave for Egypt after the wedding

 It is her birthday and her music teacher Jasper has composed a musical for Rosa, who insists her to sing

 When Jasper Mayer enters with Sapsey, he tells Meyer that everything is not always what it seems
 jasper kabristaan ke paas jaataa he, jahaan use ek makbare kii chaabi hasil ho jaati he
 After this, Edwin and Rosa reveal that they both have a lot of misconceptions about their upcoming wedding and have decided to break their wedding plans, but will not tell about it until after the Christmas holidays
 Big players gather to celebrate Christmas dinner at Jasper's house, but the atmosphere is not happy, because it also shows rivalry and evil intentions
 After the others leave Edwin and Neville head to the river and Jasper offers Edwin his topcoat
 agle din edwin gaayab ho jate hai or he chrisaparcal ke sahaayak baijrd jasper kaa fata or khun se sanaa kot miltaa he
 Drood is believed to have been killed and Neville is the main suspect
 baijrd ek kshan ke liye apni hi vifaltaaon par pachhataate hai, lekin ashaavadi bane rahete he
 However, Neville, who is held hostage, is released early
 is bich, jasper rojaa se yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhen use pyaar ho gaya he
 Annoyed Rosa turns to Jasper, prompting him towards the frequency of "moonfall"
 chah maheene baad edwin drud abhi bhi laapata rahata he or rajkumaari pafar or ek ajanabi dick datcheri edwin ke laapata hone ke rahasy kii jaanch ke liye aate he
 At this time, the chairman arrives with the deputy and the durdles to remind the audience to pay attention to the clues
 jasper kii raah dekh rahi pafar rojaa bed or baaki kalakaaron se milti hai or unhen apni mahatvakankshaon ko nahin chhodane kaa kahati hai 
 achaanak geet ke bich main sab kuch band ho jaataa he : yah utana hi lanbaa hota he, jitna samay dicans ko marane ke pehle mila
 Now is the time for the audience to decide how the story will end
 pehle yah nirdhaarit hoga ki kya vastav main edwin mar gaya he yaa nahi
 yah pataa chalaa ki mahila pararupadharika elice nating naatak ke do ankon main abhinay ke anubandh ko puraa karne ke liye datcheri ke poshaak pahenti aa rahi he- lekin datcheri or drud kya ek hi or samaan hai? kalakaar sarvasammati se matdaan karte he ki drud vastav main mar chukaa he
 Before being sent out, Alice gets angry and tells the cast that they are all jealous of her and that is the only reason she is being sacked
 uske baahar nikalne ke baad chairman satya kaa rahasyodghatan karte hai : elis dard se peedit thi, lekin ab yah nirdhaarit kiya janaa baaki he ki vastav main datcheri koun he
 Audiences clap and vote for a new datchery and the chosen actor goes to change the costume for the finale
 aage hatyare kaa nirdhaaran kiya janaa he
 The chairman summarizes the list of possible killers and their motives for the crime
 darshakon ko hatyaron ke liye "jilavaar" matdaan karne ke liye kaha jaataa he or jab tak vot kii gananaa kii jaati he, "setting ap da score " "da mistry" ke sankalp kii ore badhata he
 Puffer discovers Roja and reveals that she was Roja's midwife years ago
 She stands firm on "puffer's statement" and reveals Datchery's identity
 Sham's Datchery explains why she wants to find the killer and immediately accuses Jasper of being a murderer
 jasper jald hi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone opium ke nashe main apane bhattije kaa galaa dabaaya

 Odia, Oriya or Odia is a language spoken in the Odisha province of India
 yah yahan ke rajya sarkaar kii rajbhasha bhi he
 As a linguistic family, Odia is an Aryan language and is closely related to Nepali, Bangla, Assamese and Maithili
 orissa kii bhashaa or jati donon hi artho main oriya shabd kaa prayog hota he, kintu vastav main thik rup "oriya" hona chahie
 The evolution of its etymology is considered by some scholars as follows: Odravishya, Odravisha, Odisha, Odisha or Odisha
 sabase pehle bharat ke naatyashaastra main udravibhasha kaa ullekh miltaa he: "shabarabhir Chandal Sachladravidodraja:

 At the same time it also has the characteristics of the languages of the Mundari class like Santhali, Mundari, Shabari, etc
 and the languages of the Dravidian class of Auragaon, Cui Telugu etc
 isaki lipi kaa vikaas bhi nagari lipi ke samaan hi brahmi lipi se hua he
 The only difference is that the upright line of the Nagari script becomes circular in the Oriya script and occupies more space than the main part of the script
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki oriya main pehle taalptr par louh lekhnee se likhane kii reeti prachlit thi or sidhi rekha khinchne main taalptr ke cat jane kaa dar tha
 Therefore, the straight line was replaced by the straight line and the modern form of Oriya script started coming in progress
 sampoorn oria bhashaa ke itihaas ko nimna virgon main baanta ja saktaa he - Odia being a eastern indo-aryan language is a member of the indo-aryan language family
 ise purv magadhi naamak praakrit bhashaa kaa vanshdhar mana jaataa jise ki 1500 saal pehle purv bharat main prayog kiya jaataa tha
 It is closely related to modern Bengali, Maithili, Nepali and Assamese languages
 anya uttar bhartiya bhashaaon ke mukaable main uriya, parsi bhashaa dwaara sabase kam prabhavit hua he
 The oldest example of written Odia language is found in Madla Panji, which was written on palm leaves

 This era began with the propagation of Vaishnab religion of Srichaitanya
 balram das, jagannatha das, yashovant das, anant das evam achyutanand das-in paanchon ko panchasakha kaha jaataa he
 Like other literatures of this era, his works were also based on religion

 The word 'chhattisgarhi' is used in two meanings
 1
 chhattisgadhi bhashaa, vah bhashaa jo bharat ke chhattisgarh praant or uske aasapaas boli jaati he
 2
 Chhattisgarhi people, people who live in Chhattisgarh province of India or who are born in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgadhi bharat main chhattisgarh praant main boli jane vaali ek atyant hi madhur va saras bhashaa he
 It is very close to Hindi and its script is Devanagari

 Chhattisgarh is the mother tongue of 2 crore people
 yah purvi hindi kii pramukh boli he or chhattisgarh rajya kii pramukh bhashaa he

56 percent of the state's population lives in rural areas and only 17 percent in urban areas
 yah nirvivaad satya he ki chhattisgarh kaa adhiktar jivan chhattisgadhi ke sahare gatiman he
 It is a different matter that the business-language of a few cities is in the national language Hindi and Urdu, Punjabi, Oriya, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Telugu, Sindhi etc
 and in tribal areas like Halbi, Bhatri, Muria, Madiya, Pahari Korwa, Uraon Contact is made only with the help of initial bids
 is sabake baavjood chhattisgadhi hi aisi bhashaa he jo samooche rajya main boli, va samajhi jaati he
 This Chhattisgarhi, which touches each other's heart, is a kind of contact language of Chhattisgarh state

 In 875 AD, Ratanpur in Bilaspur district was ruled by the Chedolite king Kallol
 tatpashchaat ek sahastra varsh tak yahan haihyavanshi nareshon kaa rajkaaj aarambh hua
 According to Cunningham, the "south Kosala" at that time was the "mahakosal" and it was the "great Chhattisgarh" in which some districts of Orissa, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, namely, Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Balangir, Boudhulavani, Kalahandi, Koraput, Bhandara, Chandrapur , Shahdol, Mandla, Balaghat included
 uttar main sthit ayodhya rajya kaushal rajya kahalaaya jahaan kii boli avadhi he
 In South Kaushal, Awadhi was called Sahodhara Chhattisgarhi
 haihyavanshiyon ne is anchal main iskaa prachaar kaary prarambh kiya jo yahan par rajkeey prabhutv vaali siddh hui
 Due to this, they scattered bids and remained confined in the hills and forestlands and in these areas the ancient form of Chhattisgarhi started to stabilize
 chhattisgadhi ke praanrabhik likhit rup ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah 1703 isvi ke dantewada ke danteshwari mandir ke maithil pandit bhagwaan mishra dwaara shilaalekh main he
 Mr
 Pyarelal Gupta writes very interestingly in his book "ancient Chhattisgarh" - "chhattisgarhi language is the duhita of Ardha Bhagadhi and the brother of Awadhi"
 " chhattisgadhi or avadhi donon kaa janm ardhamagadhi ke garbh se aaj se lagbhag 1080 varsh purv naveen-dasvin shatabdi main hua tha
 " dow bholanath tibaari, apni pustak " hindi bhashaa" main likhte he - " chhattisgadhi bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya avadhi kii apeksha kahin adhik he or is dru se yah boli ke str ke upar uthakar bhashaa kaa swarup praapt karti he
 " bhashaa sahitya par or sahitya bhashaa par avlambit hote he
 That is why language and literature flourish simultaneously
 parantu ham dekhte he ki chhattisgadhi likhit sahitya ke vikaas ateet main spasht rup main nahin hui he
 Many writers believe that the reason is that in the past, the writers here made Sanskrit the medium of writing and remained a bit indifferent to Chhattisgarhi
 isiilie chhattisgadhi bhashaa main jo sahitya rachaa gaya, vah kareeb ek hazaar saal se hua he
 Many writers have divided this one thousand years in this way: ye vibhaajan saahitiyik pravritiyon ke anusaar kiya gaya he yadhyapi pyarelal gupt ji kaa kahana thik he ki - " sahitya kaa pravaah akhandit or avyahat hota he
 "mr
 Pyarelal Gupta ji goes ahead with a very beautiful estimate -" However, the trends of specific era leave their footprints on the chest of literature: Looking at the nomenclature of trend, one should not think that literature with any specific trends in an era Was composed only
 tathaa anya prakaar kii rachanaaon kii us yug main ekaant abhaav tha
 " yah vibhaajan kisi pravriti kii saapekshik adhikta ko dekhakar kiya gaya he
 Another noteworthy fact is that in other Aryan languages, even in Chhattisgarhi, only the poetic works have been done till the medieval period

 Jogan is a 1950 Hindi-language film
 isamen anya saathi kalakaaron ke saath hindi ] evam ne bhoomika nibhaai thi
 First appeared on the screen of this film
 1950 main bani is film ke nirdeshak the, evam sangeet ne diya
 The hymns sung in the melodious voice of "veil ke pat khol", "mere to Giridhar Gopal", Mat Ja jogi "and the song" All the hunters of beauty "were very much a hit
 jogan internet movie database par This article is not about Sanskrit Mahakavi Bhasa's work 'dootavakya'
 dootkavy, sanskrit kavy kii ek vishisht parampara he jiskaa aarambh bhaas tathaa ghatkarper ke kaavyon or mahakavi kalidas ke meghdoot main miltaa he, tathaapi, iske beej or adhik puraane prathit hote hai
 The passage described by Valmiki in the poems in which Rama sent his viraha message to Sita is considered to be the beginning link of this tradition
 swayan kalidas ne bhi apane "meghdoot" main is baat kaa sanket kiya he ki unhen megh ko doot banane kii prerana valmiki "ramayana" ke hanumanvaale prasang se mili he
 On the other hand, the seeds of this tradition also appear to be located in folklore, where the Virhi and the Virhinis plead to carry the message by birds of their loving relatives, Bhramar, Shuk, Chatak, Kak etc
 "ghatkarper" kavy main keval 22 padya uplabdh hai, jinamein akaash main ghire megh ko dekhakar ek virahinee ne apane virah kii vyanjana karai he
 The other characteristic of this poetry is the use of padanta yamaka ornamentation with paraphrasing

 Due to this pledge, the title of the author became "ghatkarpar" and we do not know his real name
 kuch vidvan is rachana ko kalidas krit maanate hai, kintu yah siddh ho chukaa he ki yah kalidas kii rachana nahin he
 The time of "ghatkarpar" is an indefinite one, as according to early tradition, "ghatkarpar" was also one of Vikramaditya's Navratnas
 keval itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki is kavy k rachana kalidas se puraani he
 The powerful work of this tradition is the "meghdoot" of Mahakavi Kalidasa, in which the Yaksha, exiled by Kubera to Mount Ramagiri, through his unconscious cloud sends a message to his Priya in distant Alakapuri that he is somehow of the exile period
 Let the rest of the month pass and then they will fulfill all their aspirations in the dusty nights with the moonlight of Sharad

 In the 12th century Adhmana, a weaver from Multan, composed a poem in the style of Rasak Gitikavya in which the Virahini heroine begs a wanderer to carry a message to her beloved on her way to Khambhat
 is kavy main nayika ke saundaryavarnan ke atirikt romantic shadritu varnan or nayika kii virahadasha kii maarmik abhivyanjana uplabdh he
 In Hindi, "dhola Maru Ra Duha", there are some couplets, whose form is of the messenger style
 iske atirikt hindi premakhyaan kaavyon main aise sthal uplabdh hai, jahaan virahi pranayi ne apane priy ke prati kisi madhyam se sandesh pahunchaane kii cheshtaa kii he
 In this connection, some of the available sites can be indicated in Jayasi's "nagamtivirah narration"
 isi tarah hindi krishnakavy main bhramaragit parampara ke antargat dootkavy yaa sandeshkavy ke kuch beej mil jaayenge
 The style of Dootkavya or Sandeshkavya in Malayalam originates from the "neelkanthsandesh" of Kerala Varma, who sent a message from prison to his wife via Neelkanth
