 gotra mote taur par un logon ke samooh ko kehete hai jinka vansh ek mul purush purvaj se atoot kram main judaa he
 For grammar purposes, the definition of gotra in Panini is 'apatyam potraprabhrati gotram', meaning the word 'gotra' means child beginning with son's son
 gotra, kul yaa vansh kii sangya he jo uske kisi mul purush ke anusaar hoti he In a nutshell, according to Manusmriti, after seven generations, the literacy ends, that is, after seven generations, the value of the gotra changes and a new gotra starts in the name of the eighth generation
 lekin gotra kii sahi gananaa kaa pataa na hone ke kaaran hindu log lakho hajaaro varsh pehle paidaa hue purvajo ke naam se hi agyantavash apana gotra chalaa rahe hajisase vaivaahik jatiltaayen utapann ho rahi hai
 There are two famous theories of Hindu law in India called Mitakshara and Daibhaga
 inamen se daybhag vidhi bengal main tathaa mitakshra punjab ke atirikt shesh bharat main prachlit he
 It has undergone conservative changes in Punjab
 mitakshra vidhi ke anusaar raktasambandhiyon ke do saamaanya pravarg hai : According to the Mitakshara theory of Hindu law, blood relatives can be divided into two general categories
 pratham pravarg ko gotreey arthath 'sapind gotraj' kaha ja saktaa he
 Gotriya or gotraja sapind are those who are related to a person by an unbroken chain of ancestors or descendants of ancestral side
 vanshaparampara kaa bane rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 For example, a person's father, grandfather and great-grandfather are his gotraja sapind or gotriya
 isi prakaar iske putr pautradi bhi uske gotreey athwa gotraj sapind hai, yaa yon kahie ki gotraj sapind ve vyakti hai jinaki dhamniyon main samaan rakt kaa sanchaar ho rahaa ho
 The second category of blood relatives is also called ‘other gotra’ or different gotraja sapind or bandhu
 anya gotreey yaa bandhu ve vyakti hai jo kisi vyakti se matrupaksh dwaara sambandhit hote hai
 For example, the son of Bhanja or niece would be called Bandhu
 gotreey se aashay un vyaktiyon se he jinke aapas main purvajon athwa vanshajon kii sidhi pitru parampara dwaara raktasambandh hon
 But this dynasty does not go to infinity on either side
 yahan keval ve hi vyakti gotreey hai jo samaan purvaj kii saatvin peedi ke bheetar aate hai
 The specific method of calculating generation according to Hindu law is also of a different type
 yahan vyakti ko athwa us vyakti ko apane aap ko pratham peedi ke rup main ginana padataa he jiske baar main hamen yah pataa lagaana he ki vah kisi vishesh vyakti kaa gotreey he athwa nahin
 For example, if 'A' is a person whose ancestors we have to count, then 'A' will be counted as one generation or first generation
 uske pita duusari peedi main tathaa uske dada teesri peedi main aayenge or yah kram saatvin peedi tak chalegaa
 All these people will be the tribe of 'A'
 isi prakaar ham pitruvanshanukram main arthath putr pautradi kii saatvin peedi tak, arthath 'k' ke praputra ke praputra tak, gananaa kar sakate hai
 All these gotrajas are spindles but only such gotras are not spindles
 inke atirikt saatvin peedi tak, jisaki gananaa main pratham peedi ke rup main pita sammilit hai, kisi vyakti ke pita ke anya purush vanshaj arthath bhai, bhatija, bhattije ke putradi bhi gotraj sapind hai
 Similarly, six male descendants of a person's grandfather and six male descendants of great-grandfather's father are also Gotraj Sapind
 ham in chha: vanshajon kii gananaa purvajawali ke kram main tab tak karte hai jab tak ham 'k' ke pardada ke pardada ke chha: purush vanshajon ko isamen sammilit nahin kar lete
 In this lineage, more gotra sapinds can also be included such as the wife and daughter of 'A' and her maternal uncle
 'k' ke pitrupaksh ke chah vanshajon kii dharmapatniyaan arthath uski mata, daadi, paradaadi or uske pardada ke pardada kii dharmapatni tak bhi gotraj sapind hai
 According to the right and narrow legal interpretation, the total number of gotras spindles is 57
 'k' ke samaan purvaj kii 13veen peedi tak ke in purvajon ke vanshajon ke pare jo vyakti honge ve 'k' ke samaanodak honge
 In addition to these, the seven ancestors of ancestral tradition beyond the great-grandfather of 'A' and their descendants up to the 41st generation in that tradition will also be synonymous with 'A'
 samaanodak ve vyakti hai jinhen 'k' shraadh karte samay jal detaa he
 But in broad terms, the philosophers are also Gotri
 jinke gotra gyaat na hon unhen kaashyapagotreey mana jaataa he

 Other areas that speak this language are - most of Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, African Francophone, Luxembourg and Monaco
 franci bhashaa 19 karod logon dwaara duusari bhashaa ke rup main or anya 20 karod dwaara adhigrahit bhashaa ke rup main boli jaati he
 There are good numbers of speakers of this language in 54 countries of the world
 francisi roman samrajya kii latin bhashaa se nikali bhashaa he, jaise anya rashtriya bhashaayen - portugali, spanish, italian, romanian or anya alpsankhyak bhashaayen jaise catelan ityadi
 In the development of this language, it was influenced by the Celtic languages of the original Roman Gaul and the Germanic language of the later Roman French invaders
 yah 29 deshon main ek aadhikarik bhashaa he, jinamein se adhikanshtah laa francophoni naamak francisi bhashi deshon ke samuh se hai

5 karod mulbhaashi hai or 6
9 karod ise duusari bhashaa ke rup main bol sakate hai, jo ise angrezi or german ke baad sangh kii teesri sarvaadhik boli jane vaali bhashaa banaata he
 Additionally, prior to the overthrow of English in the early 20th century, French was the principal language of diplomacy and dialogue between European and colonial powers, as well as the colloquial language of the educated class of Europe
 likhi hui francisi main agar shabd ke ant main agar ye vyanjan aate hai : s, t, f, c, q,, x, p, n, m, to saadharantaya inkaa uccharan nahin hota
 So if it is spelled français, it will be pronounced French, not Frances
 "na" or "m" swaron ko nasiky bana sakate hai
 Other consonants are often pronounced when they come at the end of a word
 par agar koi francisi ke apane uccharan niyamon ko acchhee tarah samaj jaye to wo maan jaayegaa ki isamen angrezi se behatar niyambaddhata he

 kai dhumrapaan virdohi sanghathanon kaa daawa he ki kishor apane hamaumr ke saathiyon ke dabaav tathaa doston ke pade saanskrithik prabhaav ke kaaran dhumrapaan shuru karte hai
 However, one study has found that the direct pressure of cigarette smoking does not play a significant role in smoking among adolescents
 is adhyayan main yah bhi report he ki kishoravastha main cigarette pine ke nirdeshaatmak or pratyaksh donon tarah ke dabaav kam hote hai
 One such study has shown that one can play a more active role in smoking than the one who has been accepted earlier and needs to be given attention to other social processes than peer pressure
 ek anya adhyayan ke parinaamon se pataa chalaa he ki saathiyon ke dabaav main sabhi aayu or ling ke dal ke dhumrapaan vyavhaar mahatvapurn dhang se jude the, lekin ve antarvaiyaktik kaarak kaaphi adhik mahatvapurn the jo 12-13 varsh kii ladakiyon kii tulana main usee umr ke ladakon ke dhumrapaan vyavhaar ko alag karata he
 Within the age group of 14–15 years, the effect of smoking pressure on peers compared to boys emerged as an important factor
 It is often debated whether peer pressure or self-selection is a major cause of smoking among adolescents
 yah tark kaa vishay he ki saathiyon ke dabaav kaa ulta bhi sach he, jab saathiyon main se zyaadaatar dhumrapaan nahin karte hai or jo aisa karne waalon ko bahishkrut kar dete hai
 Psychologists such as Hans Isenk have created a personality development profile for specific smokers
 chunki ve ek aisi gatividhi main lipt hote hai jiskaa swasthya par nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he, atah aise log jo log dhumrapaan karte hai, ve apane vyavhaar ko yuktisangat banane ke liye prayatnshali rahete hai
 In other words, they develop acceptance, not necessarily because they have a logical reason why smoking is acceptable to them
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek dhumrapaan karne vaala apane vyavhaar kaa auchity yah kahkar sabit kar saktaa he ki har koi marataa he or isliye vastav main cigarette kuch bhi nahin badalati
 yaa ek vyakti auchity sabit karne ke liye yah vishwaas jataa saktaa he ki dhumrapaan tanaav se raahat yaa anya laabh dilaataa he
 These types of beliefs prevent anxiety and people continue smoking
 is gatividhi ke liye dhumrapaan karne waalon dwaara die gaye kaaran ko mote taur par is prakaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he: dhumrapaan ke nashe kii lat, maje ke liye dhumrapaan, tanaav main kami / vishram, saamaajikta ke kaaran dhumrapaan, uttejnaa, aadat / swachaalan or prabandhan

 Some smokers argue that the depressant effect of smoking calms their nerves, often helping to increase concentration
 haalanki imperial college landan ke anusaar, "nicotine uttejk or avsaad donon kaa prabhaav dene lagata he or yah sambhaavna he ki yah prabhaav kisi bhi samay upyogkarta kii manosthiti, paryaavaran or upyog kii paristhitiyon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 The study also suggested that lower doses have a depressive effect, whereas higher doses have a stimulant effect
 tathaapi nicotine ke upyog ke prabhaav or nicotine chhodane ke prabhaav ko alag karnaa asambhav he
 Lack of resistance to the harmful effects of health is an ancient ideal example of optimistic bias
 iske alaava sambhaavna kii samaj kii kami ki aam taur par iskaa prabhaav zyada umr main dikhaayi detaa he or vyaktitv main hraas yaa vikaar paidaa karata he jo aam taur par ucch jokhim yaa aatm vinaashkari vyavhaar main dikhaayi detaa he
 Several studies have established that the time frame between cigarette sales and smoking use are different
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main cigarette kii bikri kaa dhaancha kaaphi had tak mausam se judaa hua he, garmi ke maheene main isaki bikri kaaphi bad jaati he, jabaki sardiyon main isaki khapat kam ho jaati he
 Similarly, smoking shows a different practice with the beginning of the day, its number increases slightly after waking up in the morning and shortly before bedtime
 jin deshon main ek saarvajanik swasthya pranali he, vahaan dhumrapaan karne vaale biimaar logon kii samaajik chikitsa dekhbhaal kii laagat karon main vruddhi ke madhyam se vahan kii jaati he
 Two arguments exist on this front, with "smoking advocates" arguing that heavy smokers generally do not live long lives leading to expensive and chronic illnesses that affect old age and reduce the burden of healthcare in society is
 "dhumrapaan virdohi" tark ke anusaar swasthya chikitsa kaa boj badhata he kyonki dhumrapaan karne waalon kii saamaanya aabaadi kii tulana main kam umr main lambii beemaari dar adhik he
 Both have limited figures
 rog niyantran or rokthaam kendra ne 2002 main prakashit apane anusandhan main daawa kiya he ki sanyukt rajya america main beche gayi ek packet cigarette par chikitsa dekhbhaal or utpaadak hraas par 7 dollar se adhik kii laagat aati he
 The cost may be higher while another study has reported a cost of $ 41 per packet, most of which has to be borne by the individual and his / her family
 is tarah se ek anya or adhyayan ke lekhak dusron ke liye bahut kam laagat bataate hue kehete hai: "sankhya ke kam hone kaa kaaran nijee pension, saamaajik suraksha or chikitsa he- kharch kii gananaa main sabase bada kaarak samaaj he- dhumrapaan vastav main paise bachaata he
 Smokers die at an early age and do not take the money they are paid by those systems

 anterdahan ingine aisa ingine he jisamen eendhan evam oxykaarak sabhi taraf se band ek belanakaar dahan kaksh main jalte hai
 In this process of combustion, often the air acts as an oxidizer
 jis band kaksh main dahan hota he use dahan kaksh kehete hai
 This combustion reaction is exothermic which produces high temperature and high pressure gases
 ye gaisen dahan kaksh main lage hue ek piston ko dhakelti hue failtin he
 The piston is connected to a crank shaft through a connecting rod, thus when the piston moves downwards the crank shaft attached to the connecting rod starts to rotate, thus converting the chemical energy of the fuel into first thermal energy and then thermal Energy is converted into mechanical energy
 anterdahan ingine ke vipareet bahirdahan ingine, main kaary karne vaala taral kisi anya kaksh main kisi taral ko garam karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 Often the piston reciprocating engine, in which combustion occurs after a period of time, is called the internal combustion engine, but jet engines, most rockets and many gas turbines also fall under the category of internal combustion engines in which combustion is going on continuously
 is
 aajkal automobile main prayukt adhikansh ingine anterdahan ingine hi hote hai
 The idea of the invention of the combustion engine began in the medieval period
 1680 i
 main dach vaigyanik chrishchiyan higes ne ek urdhv silinder or piston ke ingine kaa suzav rakhaa tha, jisamen barood ke visphot se piston upar chadhe
 But this type of engine never worked
 baad main dahansheel gaison tathaa khanij tailon ke avishkaar se unka suzav vyaavhaarik ho gaya kyonki barood kii jagah idhan dene kii samasya sulajh gai
 But still many years of practical and theoretical studies were needed to make the engines of this class compatible with practical utility
 antardahan injanon main idhan ke rup main dijal, petrol, alcohol athwa prakritik yaa kritrim gas ityadi kaa prayog hota he
 But generally petrol and diesel are used only
 antardahan ingine do siddhanto par kaary karte hai - chaturghaat chakra or dwighat chakra In a four-stroke engine, the four-stroke suspension, compression, power and exhaust process is complete
 tathaa power jab banati he jab piston do baar Up and down hota he
 Meaning the crankshaft rotates twice
 four stroke ingine mai ful kii bachat hoti he
 Inertial locomotives have two species, direct-activated engines and amphibious active engines
 ekadish sakriy injanon main kaaryakari padaarth piston ke keval ek ore rahata he; ubhaydish sakriy injanon main donon ore
 They have a long cylinder and both parts of the piston have suction, compression etc
 adhikansh antardah ingine ekadish sakriy hote hai
 For example, engines in motorcars are of this type
 parantu bahuterey bade ingine ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai
 Amphibious active engines generate nearly twice as much energy as direct-activated engines and have a nominal increase in size, but there are many mechanical difficulties in building amphibious active engines
 isliye keval badi naav ke injanon main hi ubhaydish sakriy ingine laabh daayak hote hai
 On the other hand, steam engines and air compressors are usually made active amphibians, although this is not a mandatory rule
 aaj ke adhikansh antardahan ingine oto chakra ke siddhant par banate hai
 For simplicity of calculation, we can imagine that the two actions in a cycle are both sub-entropic and two constant
 kalpit chakra ke vishleshan main sugamawa ke liye maan liya jaataa he ki kaaryakari padaarth keval vaayu he
 It is also assumed that neither suction shock nor exhaust shock occurs
 is vishleshan ko vayumatrik vishleshan kehete hai
 In actual engines, gases are exhausted
 uske badale mana jaataa he ki sthir aaytan par gaisen thandi ho jaati hai
 The work is the same, whether the gases are discharged, whether they are cooled, in every case the heat generated by the burning of fuel remains the same
 jis dar se urja kaary main roopantarit hoti he use shakti kehete hai; yah samay ke ekak main kaary kii maatra he
 The work that is done on the piston of the engine with the piston moving back and forth is called the specified function and the power calculated according to the specified work is called the specified horsepower
 ingine kii dhuree tak jitna kaary pahunchataa he vah dhuree kaary athwa brake kaary kehalaata he or is kaary ke anusaar utpann shakti ko brake ashwashakti kehete hai
 Several grounds can be taken to determine how much power an internal engine can receive
 motorcar ingine banaanevaale apane vigyapanon main apane ingine kii mahattam shakti bataate hai, jo tab praapt hota he jab samast paristhitiyaan mahattam rup se anukool hoti hai
 But manufacturers of industrial engines generally determine the power of their engines according to the power generated at approximately the greatest thermal efficiency
 audyogic injanon kaa samarthy isi prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa uttam bhi he
 The reason is that if the engines are run at the prescribed capacity, then the fuel cost will be minimal and then they will be able to operate at higher power for some time if needed
 prayek antardahan ingine main praapt shakti isapar nirbhar rahata he ki piston kii ek daud main jitna idhan-vaayu-mishran silinder main pravisht hota he uskaa dravyaman kya he
 Therefore, the reasons for which this mass will decrease will reduce the power of the engine
 vaastavik ingine main idhan-vaayu-mishran ko ghataane badhaanevaale yantra se, jise prarodh kehete hai, tathaa antargrahan or nikaas vaalvon se mishran kii gati main kuch baadha padati he
 Therefore, while sucking the mixture, the pressure in the cylinder is less than the atmospheric pressure
 falat: utana mishran nahin ghus paata jitna saidhantik gananaa main mana jaataa he
 In theoretical calculations it is assumed that the pressure of the mixture within the cylinder is equal to the atmospheric pressure
 phir, silinder kaa bhitari prishth, tathaa mishranpurna apekshaakrit tapt rahete hai
 Therefore, on reaching the cylinder, the fuel mixture gets heated
 aaytan taap-daab niyam ke anusaar taap badhane ke kaaran silinder main mishran kaa dravyaman us dravyaman kii apeksha kam hota he jo thande rahane par hota
 Then, in the actual engine's cylinder space, even after the exhaust ambush is complete, the gases remain at higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, and they spread to the cylinder at the start of the suction power
 inkaa daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar ho jane ke baad hi chushan kaa aarambh hota he
 Also, less than a calculated amount of theory, the mixture enters the cylinder
 ant main, ingine samudratal se jitani hi adhik oonchaai par kaam karegaa vahaan vayumandaleey daab utani hi kam hogi
 Therefore, according to mass, the amount of mixture that can enter the cylinder at sea level is less than the mixture will be able to enter the high places
 antardahan ingine kii aaytneey dakshata keval oonchaai badhane par hi nahin ghatati, vah ingine kii chaal badhane par bhi ghatati he
 Therefore, the supercharger is often installed in the engines used in the race competition and at high altitude engines
 is yantra main ek chota sa apkendriya pankhaa rahata he jo idhan-vaayu-mishran ko silinder main vayumandaleey daab ke kuch adhik daab par thuns detaa he
 Applying a supercharger increases the rectangular efficiency, even it can exceed 1
 oto chakra ke vishleshan main yah dikhaaya ja chukaa he ki sampeden anupaat badhaane se dakshata badhati he
 The same trend appears in real engines
 oto chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main chushan aghat main vaayu ke saath hi idhan bhi ghusata he or isliye sampeden aghat main bhi vah vartmaan rahata he
 When the compression ratio is kept too large, the fuel mixture explodes as soon as the compression exceeds a certain amount, that is, the fuel itself, ignites without sparking from the spark plug
 phir, yadi aisa na bhi hua, to spark plag kii chinagaari se jalanaa aarambh hone par sampeden lehren uthati hai, jo chinagaari ke paas jalte hue mishran ke aage aage chalati hai
 Due to these compression waves, the mixture away from the spark may itself burn, which is undesirable
 phir, silinder main kahin petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade petrol aadi ke jaale avshesh ke dahakate rahane se, athwa piston ke bheetar bade kisi avyav kii tapt nok se bhi idhan mishran samay ke pehle jal saktaa he
 Whenever the compressed mixture burns prematurely, its burning is explosive
 yah kaan se sunai padataa he - jaan padataa he ki kisi dhaatu ko hathode se thonka ja rahaa he
 Fear of explosions is more likely in quick-burning fuels
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main kai naveen khojein hui hai, jinase bina adhisphot hue sampeden anupaat adhik bada rakhaa ja saktaa he
 For example san 1920-25 ke lagbhag motorcar ke injanon main sampeden anupaat lagbhag 4
5 rahata tha; kabhi-kabhi to yah 3
5 hi rahata tha
 At present the ratio is 6
5 or more; In some engines, this ratio is up to 10
 injanon kii twara saadhaarant: chakkar prati minute main bataai jaati he parantu yah nirdhaarit nahin he ki kitne chakkar prati minute rahane par ingine ko inamen se kis vishesh varg main rakhaa jaae
 Additionally, the number of revolutions per minute in a high-speed steam engine has a velocity of 4,000 or more revolutions per minute for a very slow inhalation engine, but for a race competition the revolutions are around 6,000 per minute
 ve deazal ingine, jinamein chakkar prati minute lagbhag 1,000 hote hai teevrgati deazal kehalaate hai
 Larger size cylinders run slower than engines with smaller cylinders, because larger pistons are heavier and tend to be so jerky that they are harder to handle when changing direction of movement
 piston kaa veg bhi injanon kii gati kii seemaa nirdhaarit karata he, kyonki piston kaa veg bahut badhaane se ingine ghiskar sheeghra nasht ho jaataa he
 In motorcar engines, piston-velocity is now maintained at 2,800 feet per minute or even more
 deazal injanon main piston kaa ausat veg 1,000 or 1,200 foot prati minute ke bich rahata he
 The size of the engines is determined by the diameter of the cylinder and the race of the piston
 udaharant:, 12-18 inch ke ingine kaa arth yah he ki silinder kaa vyas 12 inch he or piston kii daud 18 inch he
 Modern motorcar engines have much more power than their predecessors 20-30 years ago

 The Venn diagram was invented around 1880 by John Wayne
