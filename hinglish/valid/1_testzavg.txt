 newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid

 bhautikee main, urja vastuon kaa ek gun he, jo anya vastuon ko sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he yaa vibhinn roopon main roopantarit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The ability of any worker to work is called energy
 oonchaai se girte hue jal main urja he kyonki usase ek pahiye ko ghumaya ja saktaa he jisase bijli paidaa kii ja sakati he
 It is difficult to give a simple definition of energy
 urja vastu nahin he
 We cannot see it, it does not surround any place, nor does it have any shadow
 sankshep main, anya vastuon kii bhanti yah dravya nahin he, yadyapi bahudhaa dravya se iskaa ghanishtha sambandh rahata he
 Yet its existence is as real as that of any other object and because in a mass community, which does not have the influence of any external force, its quantity is not deficient
 saadhaarant: kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 When a hunter with a bow pulls the strings, the bow brings energy which is used to drive the arrow to the hunt
 behate pani main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog panchakki chalaane main athwa kisi duusare kaam ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, gunpowder has energy, which can be used to break stone rocks or fire with cannon
 bijli kii dhara main urja hoti he jisase bijli kii motor chalaai ja sakati he
 Sunlight has energy that can be used to generate electric current by light cells
 aise hi anubam main nabhikeey urja rahati he jiskaa upyog shatru kaa vidhwans karne athwa anya kaaryon main kiya jaataa he
 Thus we see that energy is found in many forms
 tane hue spring main jo urja he use sthitij urja kehete hai; behate pani kii urja gatij urja he; barood kii urja rasinic urja he; bijli kii dhara kii urja vaidyut urja he; surya ke prakaash kii urja ko prakaash urja kehete hai
 The energy in the sun is due to its high temperature
 isko ushma urja kehete hai
 Energy can be converted from one form to another by various measures
 in parivartanon main urja kii maatra sarvada ek hi rahati he
 There is no lack in it
 ise urja-avinashita-siddhant kehete hai
 It is said above that the ability to work is called energy
 parantu sari urja ko kaary main parinat karnaa sarvada sambhav nahin hota
 Therefore it would be more appropriate to say that energy is an object that decreases as much as work
 is kaaran urja ko naapane ke ve hi ekak hote hai
 To measure the work
 yadi ham ek kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaate hai to prithvi ke gurutvkarshan ke viruddh ek vishesh maatra main kaary karnaa padataa he
 If we lift the same weight two meters high or lift two kilograms one meter high, then in both cases double work will have to be done as before
 isse prakat hota he ki kaary kaa pariman us bal ke pariman par, jiske viruddh kaary kiya jaae or us duuri ke pariman par, jis duuri dwaara us bal ke viruddh kaary kiya jaae, nirbhar rahata he or in donon parimaanon ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 We can consider any quantity of work as a unit of work
 udhaahrant: ek kilogram bhaar ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use ekak mana ja saktaa he
 But the attraction of the earth is not the same everywhere
 iskaa jo maan chennai main he vah dilli main nahin he
 Therefore, this unit is inconclusive
 phir bhi bahut se deshon main ejeeniyar aise hi ekak kaa upyog karte hai
 Which is called foot-pound
 yah us kaary kii maatra he jo landan ke akshansh main samudratat par ek pound ko ek duusare hi ekak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo centimetre-gram-senkad ke upar nirbhar he
 In this, the unit of force is called "dine"
 dine bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek gram ke pind main ek second main ek centimetre prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 The point of action of this force is one cent against it
 m The amount of work that is required to be removed is called a square
 parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se kaary kaa yah ekak bahut chota he
 Therefore, a second unit is used in daily practice
 isamen lambaai kaa ekak centimetre ke sthaan par meter he tathaa dravyaman kaa ekak gram ke sthaan par kilogram he
 The unit of force in it is "newton"
 newton bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek kilogram ke pind main ek second main ek meter prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 In this way, Newton equals 1 xxrep 5 0 dines
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko uske viruddh ek meter tak hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use jul kehete hai
 One joule equals 107 argo
 urja ko bhi inhen ekakon main napa jaataa he
 But sometimes some other units are used at special sites
 inamen ek electron volt he
 It is the unit of energy that an electron receives when it passes through the voltage difference
 yah bahut chota ekak he or keval 1
60 x 10 -19 jul ke baraabar hota he
 Additionally, a second unit is used to measure the electrical energy used in homes, called kilowatt-hours and which is equal to 3
6x 10 6 joules
 The unit of energy is the energy fields of Zon Percott Joule
 i kept 'joule' in memory of bringing a revolution
 un vastuon kii apeksha, jinke astitv kaa anumaan ham keval tark ke aadhaar par kar sakate hai, hamen un vastuon kaa gyaan adhik sugamawa se hota he jinhen ham sthool rup se dekh sakate hai
 The feeling of that form of energy first emerged in the brain of man, which is related to the big bodies and which can be seen clearly when it is turned into a work with the help of instruments
 is yantric urja ke do rup hai : ek sthitij urja evam doosraa gatij urja
 On the contrary, knowledge of the energy which is related to the movement of atoms and atoms occurred to humans later
 is kaaran yah kam aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki newton se bhi pehle francis bekan kii yah dharna thi ki ushma dravya ke kanon kii gati ke kaaran he
 The work we have to do to lift a body of one kilogram weight against the attraction of the earth one meter high, we can say kilogram-meter and it is equal to about 981 joules
 yadi ham ek door lekar ore use ek ghirani ke upar daalkar uske donon siron se lagbhag ek kilogram ke pind baandhe or unhen aisi avasthaa main choden ki ve donon ek hi oonchaai par na hon or unche pind ko bahut dhire-se neeche aane den to ham dekhenge ki ek kilogram ke pind ko ek meter unchaa uthaa degaa
 The lower the friction in the pulley, the second body can be kept equal to the weight of the first body
 isak arth yah hua ki yadi ham kisi pind ko prithvi se unchaa bad jaati he
 If a body of one kilogram is raised to 5 meters high, it has the capacity to work 5 kilogram-meters, and its energy increases to the same magnitude as before
 yah urja prithvi tathaa pind kii aapekshik sthiti ke kaaran hoti he or vastut: prithvi evam pind dwaara bane tantra kii urja hoti he
 That is why it is called potential energy
 jab kabhi bhi pindon ke kisi samudaay kii parsparik duuri athwa ek hi pind ke vibhinn bhaagon kii swaabhaavik sthiti main antar utpann hota he to sthitij urja main bhi antar aa jaataa he
 Pressing the segmental or bowing the bow brings potential energy to them
 nadiyon main band baandhakar pani ko adhik oonchaai par ikattha kiya jaae to is pani main sthitij urja aa jaati he
 Newton defined the force as the force equal to the rate of change of momentum
 yadi m kilogram kaa koi pind prarambh main sthir ho or usapar ek niyat bal F, t senkad tak kaary karke jo veg utpann kare uskaa maan v meter prati second ho to bal kaa maan m v t { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv}{t}}} newton hoga
 At the same time, if the distance the body moves is d m, then the work done by the force will be equal to Fd joules
 arthath m dravyamanvaalen pind kaa veg yadi v ho to uski urja 1 2 m v 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}} hogi
 This energy is due to its motion in that body and is called kinetic energy
 jab ham dhanush ko jhukaakar tir chhodte hai to dhanush kii sthitij urja tir kii gatij urja me parivartan ho jaati he
 The most beautiful example of the reciprocal transformation of potential energy and kinetic energy is simple pendulum
 jab ham lolak ke golak ko ek ore khinchate hai to golak apni saadhaaran sthiti se thodaa unchaa uth jaataa he or isamen sthitij urja aa jaati he
 When we release the ball, the ball starts swinging here and there
 jab golak latakane kii saadhaaran sthiti main aata he to isamen keval gatij urja rahati he
 Due to momentum, the ball moves to the other side and the kinetic energy is again converted to potential energy
 saadhaarant: vaayu ke gharshan ke viruddh kaary karne se golak kii urja kam hoti jaati he or isaki gati kuch der main band ho jaati he
 If there is no force of friction then the pendulum will go on for eternity
 gati vigyaan main urja-avinashita-siddhant ke pramanit ho jane ke baad bhi iske duusare swaroopon kaa gyaan na hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa tha ki kai sthitiyon main urja nasht bhi ho sakati he; jaise, jab kisi pindsamudaay ke vibhinn bhaagon main apekshik gati ho to gharshan ke kaaran sthitij or gatij urja kam ho jaati he
 In fact, in such situations the energy is not destroyed, but the heat energy changes
 parantu 18veen shatabdi tak ushma ko urja kaa hi ek swatantra swaroop nahin samajha jaataa tha
 Till that time, there was a belief that heat is a substance
 19veen shatabdi main prayogon dwaara yah nirvivaad rup se siddh kar diya gaya ki ushma bhi urja kaa hi ek doosraa rup he
 Even in prehistoric times, humans used to produce fire by rubbing wood, but Benjamin Tamson first noticed the close connection of energy and heat

 dhali hui pital kii top kii naliyon ko chhedate samay isane dekha ki nalee bahut garm ho jaati he tathaa usase nikle buraade or bhi garam ho jate hai
 In one experiment, by filling the water in the lumbar vessel around the canal cord, he saw that the heat generated by the lathe reached the temperature of boiling in two and a half hours
 is prayog main uskaa vaastavik dhyey yah siddh karnaa tha ki ushma koi drav nahin he jo pindon main hoti he or daab ke kaaran vaise hi baahar nikal aati he jaise nichodne se kapade main se pani; kyonki yadi aisa hota to kisi pind main yah drav ek simit maatra main hi hota, parantu chhednevaale prayog se gyaat hota he ki jitna hi adhik kaary kiya jaae utani hi adhik ushma utpann hogi
 Rumford did this experiment in 1798 AD
 iske 20 varsh pehle hi lavvajie tathaa laagranz ne yah dekha tha ki jaanwaron main bhojan se utani hi ushma utpann hoti he jitani rasinic kriya dwaara us bhojan se praapt ho sakati he
 In 1819, French scientist Duals observed that the compression of a gas produces heat in the same proportion as the work done in compression
 san 1842 i
 main isi bhaavana kaa upyog julius rabart mir ne, jo us samay keval 28 varsh kaa tha or germany ke hylebron nagar main doctor tha, is baat kii gananaa ke liye kiya ki ek calories ushma utpann karne ke liye kitna kaary aavashyak he
 We know that each gas has two specific heat: one at a fixed volume and the other at a fixed pressure
 pehali avasthaa main gas koi kaary nahin karti
 In the second stage, the gas has to work against the external pressure and the difference between the two specific heat is equivalent to this work
 is tarah mir ko ushma ke yantric tulyank kaa jo maan praapt hua vah lagbhag utana hi tha jitna count rumford ko praapt hua tha
 At the same time in England, James Prescott Joule was also engaged in extracting a mechanical equivalent of heat
 iske prayog san 1842 i
 se san 1852 i
 tak chalate rahe
 In its experiment, it took water in a copper thermometer and churned it with a churner
 mathni ko do ghiraniyon par se latake hue do bhaaron par chalaaya jaataa tha
 The door with which these loads were hanging was wrapped in the end of this churn and when these loads were falling down, the churn used to rotate
 jab ye bhaar neeche girte the to inaki sthitij urja kam ho jaati thi
 Part of this reduction was converted into kinetic energy of loads and some part was spent moving the churn
 is tarah yah gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha ki mathni ko ghumne main kitna kaary kiya ja rahaa tha
 With the increase in the temperature of the thermometer water, it could be known how much heat was generated; And then the mechanical equilibrium of heat could be found

 Many different types of products fall under the category of nutritional medicine
 ek aahaar poorak utpaada ek aisa utpaada he jisamen khaadya utpaadon se praapt poshak tatv hote hai jo drav yaa capsule ke rup main sankendrit hote hai
 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 defined what dietary supplementation generally consists of
 "ek aahaar poorak utpaada munh se liya jane vaala ek utpaada he jisamen ek "aahaareey ghatak" hota he jiskaa uddeshy aahaar ko puraa karnaa he

 This mechanism returns the amount of the same level of nutrients in the food before the food is processed

 Health Canada defines functional foods as "functional foods are common foods that are combined with ingredients or components to provide therapeutic or physical benefits in addition to full nutritional effects"

 The FDA still uses a common term "dietary supplement" for all substances without distinguishing them from their efficacy, manufacturing processes, supporting scientific research, and enhanced health benefits
 2005 main, naishanal aikadmiz ke institute of medicine or naishanal research council ne aahaar sambandhi purakon kaa moolyankan karne ke liye sangheey khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ke liye ek behatar dhaancha taiyaar karne hetu ek swatantra evam nishpaksh samiti kii sthapana kii

 Even in non-cultured foods, not all foods undergo chemical changes and are not effectively digested

 Fashion design is the art of realizing design and beauty on clothing and accessories
 fishan dizine saanskrithik or saamaajik vyavhaar se prabhavit hote hai or samay or jagah ke saath badalte rahe hai

 They satisfy the consumer's desire for elegantly designed clothing and since the design takes time to reach the market, they often predict consumer choice
 vastav main kuch diziner itane pratishthit hai ki ve hi fishan kaa chalan nirdhaarit karte hai
 Fashion designers try to make their clothes look good not only in terms of utility but also in looks
 They should keep in mind who will wear that cloth and on which occasions it will be worn
 They have a wide range of fabrics and combinations of materials to work with, as well as a wide range of colors, patterns and styles
 haalanki zyaadaatar rozaana pahane jane vaale kapadey paaramparik style kii shrenee main aate hai, par kuch alag tarah kii poshaaken kuch khaas maukon ke liye hoti hai, jaise ki shaam ko pahane jane vaali poshaaken yaa phir party main pahane jane vaale paridhaan
 Some clothes are made for a particular person, such as haute couture or off-the-rack
 Nowadays most of the clothes are made for the general public, especially casual and everyday clothes
 fishan diziner kai tareekon se kaam kar sakate hai
 Fashion designers can work solely for one fashion, known as 'in-house-designers' who hold the right to design
 ve akele kaam kar sakate yaa phir kisi samooh ke saath
 freelance diziner khud ke liye kaam karte hai, wo apni dizine fishan house ko bechate hai, sidhe dukaanon ko yaa phir kapadaa nirmaataaon ko
 Clothing is labeled by the manufacturers
 kuch fishan diziner apana khud kaa label viksit karte hai or usee ke tahat ve apane dizinon kaa vipanan karte hai
 Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual customers
 anya ucch fishan diziner vishesh store yaa hai-fishan department store kii zaruuraton ko puraa karaten hai
 These designers not only make original garments, but also such garments which are in line with fashion trends
 zyaadaatar fishan diziner paridhaan nirmaataaon ke liye kaam karte hai, aam janata ke purushon, mahilaon or bacchon ke fishan ke dizine bhi viksit karte hai
 Large well-known designer brands such as Calvin Klein, Gucci or Chanel's apparel are designed by a group of individual designers under the direction of the Director of Design
 == sangrah kii dizining ==fishan sangrah, dizineron dwaara har sizan banaaye gaye vastron kaa sankalan he jiske madhyam se ve ucch shrenee ke paridhaan or saamaanya varg shrinkhalaa ke nae prachlit vastra ko saath main pradarshit karte hai
 It is believed that by this they also make the previous one or two seasons of apparel obsolete
 ek fishan sizan yaa to sharad / sardi yaa vasant / greeshm ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 == Clothing Designing == Fashion designers work in different ways
 kuch kaagaj par apane vichaaron ke rekhachitr banaate hai, jabaki anya ek poshaak ke rup main kapade kii sajaavat karte hai
 When a designer is / is fully satisfied with the fitting of his or her design made of toilets, he or she creates a practical design of the design on the fabric with the help of a professional design developer
 pattern nirmaataa kaa kaary bahut sateek or kathin he
 The fitting of the garment depends on their precision
 ant main, ek namoonay ke taur par ek paridhaan banataa or ek model par uskaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 Fashion design is generally thought to have originated in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, the first designer to label his name on his clothing
 draper, charles fredrick worth dwaara paris main apana mason kochar sthapit karne se pehle, kapadon kaa dizine evam nirmaan zyaadaatar anaam darjinon dwaara kiya jaataa tha or ucch fishan kii avadharana shahi darbar ke vastron se aati thi
 Worth's success was such that he himself told them what they should wear, rather than what the customers said, when other designers at the time worked according to what the customers told them
 vastav main shabd koshurier kaa prayog pehali baar uskaa varnan karne ke liye hi kiya gaya
 In educational use, we study any timewear as dress design, while any fabric manufactured after 1858 is under fashion design
 isi avadhi ke dauraan kai anya dizine house bhi chitrakaaron ko kaam par rakh kar vastron ke dizine ko chitrit karwaane lage
 These pictures, which were much cheaper than producing an actual garment, were shown to customers
 agar graahak ko unka dizine pasand he, to graahak ke aadesh par ve us paridhaan ko taiyaar karvaa dete the or us taiyaar paridhaan se unhen munafa hota tha
 Thus, instead of presenting the entire garment on models to customers, the tradition of garment design drawings prepared by designers proved to be inexpensive
 vastra nirmaataaon dwaara utpaadit vastra teen mukhya shreniyon main aate hai, haalanki inako or bhi vishisht shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: By the 1950s, most fashion apparels were either measure-made or designed and made according to haute-couture, a garment designed for an individual-specific customer
 ek ucch-fishan paridhaan akele graahak ke aadesh par nirmit hota he or aamtaur par ucch gunvattta vaale, mahange kapade se, baarikiyon par dhyaan dete hue, aksar hast-nirmit va samay lene vaali vidhiyon se sila jaataa he
 Their appearance and texture are more important than the cost of their materials and the time it takes to make them
 pahanane-ko-taiyaar kapade jan bazaar or hot-kochar ke bich ke hote hai
 They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in clothing selection and measurement
 ye kapade choti maatra main banaae jate hai jinase ki inaki vishistataa kii guarantee rahe, isiilie ye mahange hote hai
 The ready-to-wear collections are usually performed by the fashion house every year on a fixed-week fashion week
 iskaa aayojan shahari aadhaar par, saal main do baar hota he
 Currently, the sales of the fashion industry depend heavily on the mass market
 jan bazaar, graahakon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karata he, maanak maapon ke anusaar, pahanane-ko-taiyaar kapadon kaa kaaphi maatra main utpaadan hota he
 Creatively inexpensive goods create affordable fashion
 jan bazaar ke diziner, nami dizineron dwaara sthapit vichaardhaaraon ko apanaate hai
 They often use inexpensive clothing and simple production techniques, before making a model of an original design, often wait a season to determine how much a style will go, to save money and time, Can be easily produced by machines
 isliye ant-utpaada bahut adhik saste main bechaa ja saktaa he
 There is a design called "kisch Design" which derives from the German word "kishen" i
e
 ugly or which does not have aesthetic sense
 duusare tareeke se bhi kisch ko samajhaayaa ja saktaa he, "pahanane yaa dikhaane kii koi chiz jiskaa samay nikal gaya he yaa jo ab fishan main nahin he
 So if you wear a pants that was once worn in the 80s, it will be called "kisch" fashion style
 vetanbhogi fishan dizineron ke liye madhya vaarshik mazdooree may 2008 main $61,160 thi

 The average annual income was $ 52860 in the industries that employed fashion designers the most - apparel, retail, and concept
 kai peshewar fishan diziner fishan ke kisi ek vishesh kshetra kii visheshgyata se shuruyaat karte hai
 The smaller and more specialized the market, the more likely the company is to give its garments a right size and price
 agar ek company alag-alag utpaadon kii bajaay ek vishesh prakaar ke utpaada se jaani jaati he to usko is udyog main apni pahchaan banane main aasaani hoti he
 Once a fashion company is established, it can then decide to expand into new territory
 yadi form ne apane dwaara banaaye gaye kapadon se apana naam bana liya he to unako nae kism ke kapade bechney main madad milti he
 It is usually safe for the company to expand in the areas it is aware of

 In 1925, the Commission recommended that the region remain part of Iraq, with the condition that the British would have a mandate on Iraq for the next 25 years to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population
 The League Council accepted the recommendation and on 16 December 1925 decided to give Mosul to Iraq

 Various factors were responsible for this failure, many of which were linked to general weaknesses within the organization
 atirikt rup se, america dwaara sangh main shaamil hone kii manaahi ne sanghathan kii shakti ko simit kiya
 The emergence of the League as an organization was carried out by the Allies as part of peace efforts to end World War i and was therefore seen as a "union of Conquerors"
 isane sangh ko varsay kii sandhi se bhi baandh diya, jisase jab sandhi apratishthit evam alokapriy ho gaya, yah rashtrasang main bhi pratibimbit hua
 The so-called neutrality of the union expressed it as indecision
 ise apane nau sadasyon, baad main chalakar pandrah parishad sadasyon kaa sarvasammat vot kisi adhinium ko paarit karne ke liye chahie; atah nirnayaatmak evam prabhavi kaary asambhav nahin to mushkil tha
 It was also slow to come to its decisions as some decisions required unanimous approval of the entire assembly
 yah samasya mukhyatya is vaastaviktaa se nikali ki rashtrasang ke mukhya sadsy is sambhaavna ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin ho rahe the ki unki niyati anya deshon dwaara tay kii jaaegi or isliye iske parinamswaroop, sarvasammat vot ko lagu karke apane ko vito kii shakti di
 Representation in the union was often a problem
 haalanki iskaa abhisht sabhi rashtron ko shaamil karnaa tha, kai kabhi shaamil nahin hue, yaa unki sangh ke saath saajhedaari bahut choti thi
 The most notable absence was the possibility of America's role in the League, not only would it secure world peace and security but also finance the Union
 US President Woodrow Wilson was the driving force behind the creation of the Union and strongly influenced its size, but the American Senate voted on 19 November 1919 not to join it
 routh heaning ne suzav diya ki yadi america sangh kaa sadsy hota to, isane france evam britain ko bhi prishth-samarthan diya hota, sambhavatya france zyada surakshit mahasoos karata evam aisa protsaahan france evam britain ko germany ke sambandh main zyada sahyog karne detaa evam isse naaji party kaa udai kam sambhav hota
 Conversely, Henning acknowledges that if the US had been a member of the Union, its reluctance to engage in war with European powers and enacting economic sanctions would have impeded the Union's ability to withstand international events
 america main sarkaar kii sanrachana ne bhi isaki sadsyata ko samasyapurna banaaya hota kyonki sangh main iske pratinidhigan america kaaryakari shakhaon kii taraf se isaki vidhai shakhaon kii purv anumati ke bina koi nirnay nahin liya gaya hota
 In January 1920, when the Confederacy began, Germany was not allowed to join as it was seen as offensive in the First World War
 soviet rus bhi prarambh main sangh se bahishkrut tha, kyonki pratham vishwa yuddh ke vijetaon ko communist vichaar pasand nahin tha
 The League was further weakened when important powers abandoned it in the 1930s
 japan ne sthaayee sadsy ke rup main parishad main shuru kiya, lekin 1933 main tab hat gaya jab sangh ne iske china ke manchuriya kshetra par akraman kaa virodh kiya
 Italy also started as a permanent member of the council but withdrew in 1937
 sangh ne germany ko 1926 main sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya, ise “shanti premi desh” mana, lekin adolf hitler 1933 main jab satta main aayaa to germany ko isse alag kar liya
 Another significant weakness developed from the contradiction between the idea of collective security, which was the basis of the League and international relations between individual nations
 samuhik suraksha pranali jise sangh ne prayukt kiya, kaa arth tha ki rashtron ke liye aavashyak tha ki ve un rajyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi karen jinhen ve mitra maanate hai or is tareeke se un rajyon kaa samarthan jinke saath saamaanya ghanishthata nahin thi, unke rashtriya hiton ko khatra ho saktaa he
 This weakness became evident at the time of the Abyssinia crisis when Britain and France had to make balanced efforts to maintain security in Europe, which they had built for themselves "to maintain order against the enemy of internal order" in Europe, in which Italy's support played a major role, with Abyssinia being obliged to remain a member of the Union
 23 june 1936 ko abisinia ke khilaaf italy ke yuddh abhiyaan ko rokane main sangh ke prayaason ke asafal hone par, british pradhanmantri stenle baldwin ne house of comons main kaha ki samuhik suraksha Ultimately, both Britain and France abandoned the concept of mass security in favor of appeasement due to the increasing influence of German militarism under Adolf Hitler
 28 july 1920, panch patrika kaa cartoon, sangh kii kamazori dekhakar vyangy kas rahaa he
 ]] The League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and relied on great powers to implement its resolutions, which they were very against

 british paramparawaadi vishesh rup se sangh par utsaahhin the tathaa sarkaar main, sanghathan kii bhagidaari ke bina samjhauta vaarta karne ke icchhuk the
 In addition, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was denying itself deception by the powerful means by which its authority would be upheld

 When the British Cabinet discussed the concept of the Union during the First World War, the Cabinet Secretary, Maurice Hankey, sent a memorandum on the subject
 usne yah kehete hue shuru kiya: "aam taur par mujhe aisa lagata he ki aisi koi yojana hamaare liye khatarnaak he, kyonki yah suraksha kaa bodh karaayegaa jo puri tarah se kaalpanik he
 It delusionally attacked the pre-war faith of the British in the sanctity of the settlement and concluded with the claim
 videsh karyaalay mantri sar ir kro ne bhi british cabinet ko ek gyaapan likhaa jisamen vah daawa kar rahe hai ki "ek gambhir sangh or anubandh" bas "duusari sandhiyon kii tarah ek sandhi" maatr hogi : "aisa kya he vahanjo yah sunishchit kare ki yah duusari sandhiyon kii tarah nahi tuutegi?"

 As the situation worsened in Europe, the war shifted, the House transferred enough power to the secretary-general on 30 September 1938, and on 14 December 1939, to allow the Union to continue legally and advance the imandy in operation

 The feeling of the crowd during a speech for the last meeting is summed up by Robert Cecil when he said: The League is dead
 Long live the sanyukt raashtra The resolution which dissolved the Union was unanimously passed: "the League of Nations shall cease to exist, except for the purposes of liquidation of its affairs

 Major Allies became permanent members of the United Nations Security Council in World War II; These new "great powers" gained significant international influence, mirroring the League Council

 Similarly, the United Nations does not have its own stability armed forces, but has been more successful than the United Nations in inviting its members to contribute to armed intervention, such as during the Korean War and maintaining peace in former Yugoslavia

 As a type of rapid software development, it supports regular "releases" in short development cycles, aimed at increasing productivity and presenting checkpoints where new consumer needs can be adopted

 Critics have noted several potential drawbacks of this, including problems with unstable requirements, the absence of a written agreement for user disputes, and the lack of a gross design specification or document
 extream programing kaa nirmaan kent bek dwaara crisler comprehensive compenseshan system vetan bhugtan pariyojna par apane kaary ke dauraan kiya gaya tha
 In March 1996, Beck became C3 project head and started refining the development method used in the project and wrote a book on this method)
 damlar-benz dwaara company ko adhigrahit kar liye jane ke baad crisler ne farvari 2000 main si3 pariyojna nirast kar di
 Although extreme programming by itself is relatively new, many of its methods have been used for some time; After all, its methodology leads "best practices" to peak levels
 udaahranarth, "test-first vikaas, niyojan or prayek laghu-vruddhi ke purv pareekshan likhane kii paddati" kaa prayog 1960 ke dashak ke prarambh main nasa ke project mercury ke samay se kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Reconstruction, modularity, bottom-up, and incremental design are described by Leo Broadie in his 1984 book
 1990 ke dashak main hue software vikaas ko mukhyatah do baton ne aakaar diya: aantarik rup se udyog ke kuch logon dwaara pasand kiye jane vaale programing pratimaan ke rup main prosceneral programing kaa sthaan object-abhimukh programing ne le liya; bahya rup se, internet ke udai or dot-com boom ne pratispardhaatmak karkon ke rup main bazaar-kii-ore-tezi tathaa company-ke-vikaas par jor diya
 Rapidly changing requirements demanded short product life-cycles and were often incompatible with traditional methods of software development

 It brought in Kent Beck, who was a well-known smalltalk user, to improve system performance, but his role increased when he noticed various problems in his development process

 Beck describes the initial concept of these methods as follows: in vidhiyon ko viksit va parishkrut karne main sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye bek ne ron jefris ko pariyojna main aamantrit kiya
 After this, Jeffriss worked as a trainer providing the necessary training to incorporate these systems into the C3 team's habits

 Various contributors discussed this and broadened their views, and resulted in the creation of some additional methodologies

 Beck edited a series of books written on XP, beginning with his own book Extreme Programming Xpland, which spread this knowledge to a much larger, but still receptive audience
 In this series, the authors looked at several aspects related to XP and its methods
 yahaan tak ki in paddatiyon par ek vivechanaatmak pustak bhi likhi gai
 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, XP produced a thrill, owing to the acquisition of many environments that were fundamentally different from its origins
 mul paddatiyon ke liye aavashyak anushaasan kii ucch maatra aksar apane maarg se bhatak jaati thi, jisase inamen se kuch paddatiyon, jo bahut sakht prathit huin, kii aalochana kii gai yaa unhen unke sthanon par apurna avasthaa main hi chhod diya gaya
 Rapid development methods have never stood steady and XP is still evolving, assimilating experiences found in this field
 extream programing expland ke duusare sanskaran main bek ne kuch nae mulya or paddatiyaan shaamil kin or praathmik tathaa sahaayak paddatiyon ke bich antar spasht kiya
 Extreme Programming describes Extreme Programming as an area of software development that mobilizes people to produce high quality software with greater productivity
 paaramparik system vikaas vidhiyon athwa waterfol model) main system kii aavashyaktaaon kaa nirdhaaran vikaas pariyojna ke prarambh main hi kar liya jaataa he or aksar ve us bindu se aage sthir rahati hai
 This means that the cost of changing the requirements at a later stage will be higher
 teevr software vikaas kii anya vidhiyon kii hi tarah, ekspe bhi parivartan kii laagat ko kam karne kaa prayaas karti he, jiske liye ek bade vikaas chakra ke bajaay anek sankshipt vikaas chakron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to this theory, changes are a natural, unavoidable and desirable aspect of software development projects and should be planned for their fulfillment rather than attempting to define a stable set of requirements
 extream programing ne teevr programing dhaanche ke sheersh par anek buniyadi mulya, siddhant or paddatiyaan bhi prastut kin
 XP describes four basic activities performed within the software development process
 ekspe ke samarthakon kaa tark he ki code-aise software nirdesh, jinhen computer samaj saktaa ho, system vikaas prakriya kaa ekmaatr vaastavik rup se mahatvapurn utpaada he
 Without code, there is no work product
 koding kaa prayog sarvaadhik upyukt samaadhaan nikaal paane main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, XP would support that when there are different options available for a programming problem, one should be coding all solutions and by automated tests to determine which solution is the most appropriate
 koding programing samasyaon ke bare main vichaaron kaa sampreshan karne main bhi sahaayak hoti he
 If a programmer is experiencing a complex programming problem and is finding it difficult to explain the solution to his fellow programmers, he can coding it and demonstrate what he wants to say
 code, jise ham is sthiti kaa prastaavak kah sakate hai, sadaiv hi spasht or sankshipt hota he or isaki ek se adhik vyakhyaayein nahin kii ja saktin
 anya programmer bhi apane vichaaron kii koding karke is code par apana feedback de sakate hai
 Until a function is tested, it cannot be said with certainty that it works
 bag va dizine trutiyaan software vikaas main vyapak samasyaayein hai
 The way to extreme programming is that if a small amount of testing can overcome some of the flaws, we can erase a lot of flaws by doing a lot of testing
 ek "testethon " ek aisa aayojan hota he, jisamen programmer sahyogpurn pareekshan lekhan ke liye aapas main milte hai, jo ki software pareekshan ke sandarbh main ek prakaar kaa vichaar-vimarsh hota he
 It is essential for the programmer to hear what the consumer wants the system to do, what "business logic" is required
 unhen anivaary rup se in aavashyaktaaon ko itani acchhee tarah samaj lenaa chaiye ki ve upabhokta ko is bare main feedback de saken ki samasya ko kyon suljhaayaa ja saktaa he yaa kyon suljhaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 upabhokta or programmer ke bich samvaad par aage niyojan khel main dhyaan diya jaataa he
 From the point of view of simplicity, we can definitely say that coding, testing and listening are sufficient for system development
 yadi ve gatividhiyaan bhalee-bhaanti purna kii gayi hai, to parinaam ke rup main hamen sadaiv hi ek kaaryshil system praapt hota he
 But in practice, it will not work
 dizine ke bina bhi vyakti ek lanbaa rasta tay kar saktaa he, lekin kisi vishisht bindu par aakar vah funs jayega
 system bahut adhik jatil ban jaataa he or system ke antargat nirbharataayen spasht nahin ho paati hai
 This can be avoided by constructing a design structure that organizes the logic used in the system
 acha dizine kisi system ke antargat anek nirbharataaon se bachaa saktaa he; iskaa arth yah he ki system ke ek bhaag main parivartan karne par anya bhaag prabhavit nahin honge
 Initially in 1999, Extreme Programming recognized four values
 extream programing expland ke duusare sanskaran main ek nayaa mulya joda gaya
 These five values are: software system kaa nirmaan karne ke liye system ke vikasakartaaon tak system kii aavashyaktaaon kaa sampreshan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 In formal software development practices, this work is done through documentation
 extream programing takneekon ko vikaas-dal ke sadasyon ke bich sansthagat gyaan kaa nirmaan va prachaar teevr gati se karne kii vidhiyon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Its goal is to provide all developers with a shared view of the system, which corresponds to the view thought by the user of the system
 is chor par, extream programing saral dizinon, aam lakshanon, prayoktaaon va programmeron ke aapasi sahyog, niyamit maukhik samvaad or feedback kaa samarthan karti he
 Extreme programming encourages you to start with the simplest solution
 atirikt kaaryaatmakataa baad main jodi ja sakati he
 The difference between this method and the more traditional methods of system development is that it focuses on designing and coding for today's requirements rather than the requirements of tomorrow, next week, or next month
 kabhi-kabhi sankshep main ise "aapako isaki aavashyaktaa nahin padane vaali he " paddati kaha jaataa he
 Supporters of XP acknowledge the lack that sometimes it may require more effort to make changes to the system in the future; Their argument is that this shortfall is met by the benefit that we do not have to invest in future needs that may change before they become relevant
 bhavishya kii anishchit aavashyaktaaon ke liye koding or dizining karne main is baat kaa khatra rahata he ki aisi baat ke liye apane sansaadhan kharch kiye ja rahe hai, jisaki aavashyaktaa shaayad na bhi pade
 "samvaad" mulya ke sambandh main, dizine or koding kii saralata se samvaad kii gunvattta main sudhaar hona chaiye
 a simple design with very simple code can be easily understood by most programmers in the team
 extream programing ke antargat, feedback system vikaas ke vibhinn ayaamon se sambandhit hota he: Feedback has a close relationship with dialogue and simplicity
 system main upasthit dosha ko ek aisa ikai pareekshan likhakar saralata se sampreshit kiya ja saktaa he, jo yah sabit karata ho ki code kaa vishisht bhaag tut jayega
 system se milane vaale pratyaksh feedback se programmeron ko yah pataa chalata he ki is bhaag kii koding punah kerani he
 From time to time, the consumer is able to test the system according to the functional requirements, which are called user stories
 kent bek ke shabdon main, "ashaavadita programing kaa ek vyavsaayik jokhim he or feedback uskaa upachaar he
 " anek paddatiyon main saahas sammilit hota he
 One of these rules is that designing and coding should always be done for today and not for tomorrow
 yah dizine main funskar ulajh jane or kuch or kriyanvit karne ke liye atyadhik prayaas karne kii aavashyaktaa se bachane kaa prayaas he
 Courage enables developers to feel comfortable during the task of restructuring their code as needed
 iskaa arth he, vartmaan system kii samiksha karnaa or use sanshodhit karnaa, taaki bhavi parivartanon ko adhik saraltapurvak lagu kiya ja sake
 Another example of courage is to know when to remove the code later: the courage to remove unusable source code, no matter how much effort is put into building that source code
 saath hi saahas kaa arth dridhtaa bhi he: ho saktaa he ki koi programmer puure din kisi ek jatil samasya main fansaa rahe or duusare din vah ise bahut jaldi sulajhaa le, lekin yah keval tabhi sambhav he, jab vah drudh ho
 Respect value includes respect for others as well as self-respect
 programmeron ko kabhi bhi aise parivartan nahin karne chaiye, jo compylation ko tod den, jo vartmaan ikai-pareekshanon ko vifal bana den, athwa jo anyathaa apane sahakarmiyon ke kaary ko vilambit kar den
 Members respect their own work by always striving for the highest quality and making the best design by restructuring the available solutions
 pichley chaar mulyon ko apnaane ke parinamswaroop team ke anya sadasyon kii ore se sammaan praapt hota he
 No team member should feel that he is not praised or ignored
 isse prerana kaa ek ucch str sunishchit hota he or yah team ke prati or pariyojna ke lakshya ke prati vafadari ko protsaahit karti he
 This value is highly dependent on other values and is highly oriented towards the team people
 ekspe ke niyamon kaa pehla sanskaran ken oir dwaara ekspe / azeil univers 2003 main prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 He felt that XP was defined by its rules, not by its methods
 unhone do shreniyan paribhaashit kin: "kaary ke niyam", jo us vaataavaran kaa varnan karte hai, jisamen software vikaas kaa kaary prabhavi rup se kiya ja saktaa ho, tathaa "khel ke niyam", jo kaary ke niyamon ke dhaanche ke antargat minute-dar-minute kii jane vaali gatividhiyon tathaa niyamon ko paribhaashit karte hai
 At the ICSE 2008 conference's Epso workshop, Mehdi Mirakhorli proposed a new, more explicit and vivid version of extreme programming, which was more independent of the methods and intended to be more "rapid"
 mehadi mirakhorali ke anusaar, ye hai: The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to encourage decisions in a systems development project
 siddhant mulyon se adhik drudh hone chaiye or kisi vyaavhaarik paristhiti main ve adhik saralata se ek maargdarshan main anuvaadit hone chaiye
 Feedback is considered most useful in extreme programming if it is done quickly and it expresses that the time between a task and its feedback is very important for learning and making changes
 paaramparik system vikaas vidhiyon ke vipareet, upabhokta ke saath kam avadhi vaale chakron main baar-baar sampark kiya jaataa he
 The consumer has a clear insight about the system being developed
 vah apana feedback de saktaa he or aavashyaktaa ke anusaar vikaas ko sanchalit bhi kar saktaa he
 Unit tests are also helpful for rapid feedback theory
 code likhte samay, ikai pareekshan is bare main pratyaksh feedback pradaan karata he ki ek baar parivartan kar diye jane par system inke prati kis prakaar kii pratikriya detaa he
 For example, if the changes affect a part of the system that is not within the scope of the programmer who created them, then that programmer will not be able to see that flaw
 is baat kii bahut adhik sambhaavna he ki jab system kaa utpaadan kiya jaayegaa, to us samay yah truti upasthit hogi
 Each problem is dealt with by assuming that it is "too simple"
 paaramparik system vikaas vidhiyaan bhavishya ke liye niyojan karne or punarprayog ke liye code likhane ko kahatee hai
 Extreme programming rejects these ideas
 extream programing ke samarthak kehete hai ki bade parivartan ek hi baar main ek saath karnaa upyukt nahin hota
 Extreme programming applies incremental changes: for example, a smaller version of a system may be released every three weeks
 jab anek chote-chote kadam banaaye jate hai, to upabhokta ke paas vikaas prakriya kaa or viksit kiye ja rahe system kaa adhik niyantran hota he
 The principle of adopting change relates to not working against changes and accepting them
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi charanbaddh baithkon main se kisi ek ke dauraan yah dikhaai de ki upabhokta kii aavashyaktaaen naatakeey rup se badal gayi hai, to programmer ise sweekaar karte hai or agle charan ke liye nai aavashyaktaaon kii yojana banaate hai
 Extreme programming describes 12 methods, grouped into four areas: ekspe kii paddatiyon par atyadhik vivaad hota rahaa he, jisamen ekspe ke prayog ke samarthan or virodh main kathor vichaar vyakt hue hai
 Proponents of extreme programming claim that this process becomes more flexible when requests for changes in consumer requirements are received informally at the workplace, and this saves the cost of formal expenses
 ekspe ke aalochak daawa karte hai ki iske parinamswaroop dobaaraa kaary karnaa mahangaa pad saktaa he or dhire-dhire pariyojna kaa dayera us seemaa se baahar chalaa jaataa he, jis par purv main sahmati bani thi yaa jiske liye dhan diya gaya tha
 Change control boards indicate that conflicts between multiple users about the project's objectives and constraints are likely
 ekspe kii teevr karypranali kuch had tak is baat par nirbhar hoti he ki programmer upabhokta ke ek ekikrut drushtikon kii kalpana kar paane main sakasham hon, taaki programmer samjhaute ke uddeshyon or baadhaon ke dastavejikaran ke bajaay apana dhyaan koding par kendrit kar saken
 yah baat tab bhi lagu hoti he, jab anek koding sanghathan shaamil hon, vishisht rup se aise sanghathan, jinke bich pariyojnaon ke ansh ko lekar pratispardhaa jari ho
 Other potentially controversial aspects of extreme programming include: aitihaasik rup se, ekspe keval baarah yaa isse kam logon ke samoohon main kaary karata he
 Breaking the project into smaller parts and then forming teams in small groups is a way to circumvent this limitation
 yah daawa kiya jaataa rahaa he ki ekspe kaa prayog sau se bhi adhik sadasyon ke samoohon par safaltaapurvak kiya jaataa rahaa he
 thoughtworks has claimed that they have found substantial success by working with groups of up to sixty people on distributed XP projects
 2004 main, industrial extream programing ko ekspe ke ek vistaar ke rup main prastut kiya gaya
 It aims to provide the ability to function in large and distributed groups

 Since it is a new member of the Agile family, there is not yet enough data to prove its usefulness, however, it is claimed to be a response to what is thought to be a lack of XP

 iske kaaran lekhon, internet samachar-samoohon or web-site chat kshetron main ek lambii bahes shuru ho gai
 The basic argument of this book is that xp's methods are interdependent, but few practical organizations are willing / able to adopt all of these methods; Hence the whole process fails

 The early thrills of extreme programming and controversial theories, such as pair programming and continuous design, have attracted specific criticism, such as criticism from mcbreen and Boehm and Turner
 However, users of Agile systems believe that the reason for most of these criticisms is the misunderstanding of rapid development

 As these thieves radios began to grow in the late 1970s and early 1980s, broadcasting of minority immigrant communities began to be associated with these stations, especially in cities such as London, Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester
 Although "community radio" remained synonymous with "thief radio" for some people in the UK, most immigrant stations remained purely focused on specific music genres and operated on a profit basis
 The uk's community radio services operate on a non-profit basis, with community ownership and control under the construction of its structure

 Community radio is often coined with the concept of usage and participation, and hence the term community may refer to the possible accessibility of the radio signal to be based on the surrounding geographic communities, that is, the people who can receive the message and They should have the ability to participate in the creation of such messages
 It is, of course, problematic with the fact that many radio stations are now broadcasting on the Internet as well, enabling them to reach global audiences and communities

 Sometimes, however, the provision of syndicated material that is not already available within the service area of the station is seen as a desirable form of service
 is tarah ke kaaryakramon ke prati vigyapandaataaon kii ruchi kam hone yaa raajnneetik rup se vivaadaaspad prakruti ke kaaran, is aadhaar par ki unke dwaara pradaan kii jane vaali saamagree kaa rup anyathaa uplabdh nahin he, sanyukt rajya america ke andar, udhaaharan ke liye, anek stesan pacifica radio or demokrasi naao! jaise samoohon se saamagree sindicket kiya karte hai

 According to the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, the role of community broadcasting in Australia is to provide a variety of services to meet community needs, which are not met by other regions
 Community broadcasting is consistent with the principles of access and participation, volunteering, diversity, independence and localism
 saamudayik radio stesan kabhi-kabhi visheshgy sangeet stesan hote hai, yaa ve dridhtaa se sthaneey sangeet or kala kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai

 Most radio stations started out on a small scale and with very simple means
 Some of them received foreign aid and developed more sophisticated radio stations with better equipment and installations
 Some built their theaters near the premises, so the trade unions' meetings started taking place there and they were also broadcast live by radio
 For example, Radio Vanguardia had a beautiful and decorated theater with large frescoes that would narrate the story of the Colloquiero mining center
 a mural depicts a 1967 attack by Bolivian Air Force aircraft during military rule
 1970 ke dashak ke aarambh main, 26 radio stesan chal rahe the, sabhi bolivia ke hilands ke khanan jilon main the
