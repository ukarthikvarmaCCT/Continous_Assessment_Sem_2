 Sweet potato is planted by pen in the month of ashadh-sawan
 kalmen pichley mausam main boi gai fasalon se praapt kii jaati hai
 They are about 1 foot to 1 foot long
 inako 2 se 3 foot kii duuri par medon par ropana chahie
 Planting after a light shower is good
 ropan kii saadharantaya teen reeti prachlit hai : 1
 The cloves, about one foot long, are given at a distance of one to one and a half feet on the ridges, 5 to 6 inches deep and making an angle of 60 °
 2
 kalmen medon ke upar ek qatari main lita di jaati hai
 The remaining part is then covered with soil, leaving about 4 inches open at both ends
 3
 kalmen uparyukt reeti se hi ropit kii jaati hai, kintu ve med par na hokar uski donon dhaal par hoti hai
 This method gives more yield than the other two methods
 barsaat main bel ko sinchaa nahin jaataa, par barsaat ke baad halki bhoomi ko teen yaa chaar baar sinchaa jaataa he
 Till the land is completely covered with vines, the field should be kept clean with weeds by light plowing or other methods
 saadharantaya do baar mitti chadhaai jaati he
 Sorting the vines is definitely harmful
 chaar se paanch maas main fasal taiyaar ho jaati he, phir bhi kand ko bade ho jane par khoda jaataa he
 The yield is high only when ripe and the sweet potato is of good quality
 shakarkand ke paripakv ho jane par, uskaa upree bhaag hawa main jald suukh jaataa he
 Three species of sweet potato, yellow, white and red, are commonly grown
 pili jati ke goode main pani kaa ansh kam rahata he or vitamin "e' kii maatra adhik rahati he
 White castes have high water content
 laal jatiyaan saadharantaya khurkhuri hoti he, par bhoomi ke drushtikon se anya jatiyon se adhik shaktishaalee yaa sahansheel hoti hai
 Some new red castes have also been developed by research
 ek amareeki jati indian agricultural research institute, nai dilli, se praapt ho sakati he
 Average yield is 120-150 mana per acre
 agar koi kisi se apni marzi ke aadhaar par kuch aise kaam karvaa saktaa he jo vah anyathaa nahin karata, to ise ek vyakti kii duusare par satta kii sangya di jaaegi
 This easy-going definition of power is a product of Robert Dahl
 iskaa sutrikaran keval vyaktiyon ke sandarbh main kiya gaya he
 As power is considered within the confines of group and collectivity, many intriguing and controversial questions arise
 samajha jaataa he ki samuhik sandarbh main satta kaa aashay aise faisale karne se he jinhen maanane ke liye duusare log majaboor hon
 For example, the decision taken by the teacher is considered by the student in his class and the family members are based on the parents' decision
 lekin, raajnneeti, arthvyavastha or samaaj-niti ke maamalon ke liye satta kii yah paribhaasha aparyaapt sabit hoti he
 Students of sociology can ask who has power in the context of society, who should have it and on what basis it should be exercised? In light of these questions, the question of power has been deeply contemplated in the realm of modern thought
 satta se jude ahm sawaalon main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn yah he ki satta samaaj main vyapak or samaan rup se vitarit he yaa kisi shaasha varg yaa kisi ‘power ilit’ ke haathon main kendrit he? satta kaa prashn us samay or jatil ho jaataa he jab satta or uskaa prayog karne se jude iraade ke sameekaran par gaur kiya jaataa he
 Parties, governments, interest groups and big corporations can be seen using power
 yah satta ke iradatan prayog ke udhaaharan hai
 But can the same thing be said for an advertiser? His intention is merely to increase the sales of his product
 to phir uske dwaara jari vigyaapan upabhoktaaon par apni satta kis tarah se kaayam karata he? upabhokta us vigyaapan ke prabhaav main kuch khaas tarah ke mulyon ke haq main kyon jhuk jate hai? spasht he ki satta ke ‘abhipret’ roopon ke alaava bhi kuch aise rup hai jinhen satta ke ‘sanrachanagat’ roopon kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Steven Lukes discusses the three dimensions of power and tries to cover many aspects of it
 unke anusaar satta kaa matlab he nirnay lene kaa adhikaar apni mutthi main rakhane kii kshamta, satta kaa matlab he raajnneetik agenda ko apane paksh main modane ke liye nirnyon ke saar ko badal dene kii kshamta or satta kaa matlab he logon kii samaj or praathamiktaaon se khelte hue unke vichaaron ko apane hisaab se niyantrit karne kii kshamta
 Robert Dahl does not believe that the ability to influence decisions remains within the grasp of a well-defined 'ruling elite' or ruling class
 1963 main prakashit apni rachana hu governs? main dahl ne america ke new havins, connecticut kaa adhyayan pesh kiya
 In this, he first sorted the three major areas of decision, identified the people involved in the decision-making process and their priorities and then matched the decisions made by those people with their priorities
 dahl ne yah to paaya ki aarthik or raajnneetik rup se taqatvar logon kii aam logon ke mukaable faisalon main zyaada chalati he, par unhen abhijanon ke kisi sthai samooh dwaara faisale karne yaa unhen prabhavit karne ke saboot nahin mili
 They came to the conclusion that power plays a role in influencing decisions, but power is not in one, but in many centers
 dahm kii manyata he ki agar isi tarah se satta ke sthaneey roopon ke adhyayan kar liye jaaen to uske rashtriya swaroop ke bare main nattejey nikaale ja sakate hai
 It is a little difficult to identify the use of power in making political agenda according to its own
 is prakriya main jor faisale karne par kam or dusron ko faisalon main shaamil hone se rokane yaa kisi khaas mat ko vyakt hone se rokane par zyaada rahata he
 To understand this role of power, it is necessary to pay attention to established values, political myths, trends and ways of functioning of institutions
 inke zariye kisi ek samooh kaa nihit swaarth duusare samoohon par haaavee ho jaataa he or kai maamalon main un samoohon ko apni baat kehane yaa nirnay-prakriya main hissedari kaa mauka bhi nahin mil paata
 Advocates of the status quo often marginalize those advocating change
 udaar-loktantric raajnneeti kii prakriyaaon ko abhijanvaadiyon dwaara aise filtaron kii tarah dekha jaataa he jinke zariye radical pravritiyaan chhantati chali jaati hai
 The third face of power, that is, the process of controlling the thoughts of the people and expressing their views, is dependent on the work of deciding the needs of the people according to their own
 harbart marcus ne apni vikhyath rachana van- diamensional main main vishleshan kiya he ki kyon viksit audyogic samaajon ko bhi sarvasattavadi kii shrenee main rakhana chahie
 According to Marquez, a totalitarian state was created using Hitler's power in Nazi Germany or in Stalin's Russia, but in industrial societies, this is done by changing the needs of people without any direct brutality through modern technology
 
 aise samaajon main takaraav upar se nahin dikhataa, par iskaa matlab satta ke vyapak vitaran main nahin nikaala ja saktaa
 In a society that does not have opposition and resistance, it can be assumed that the subtle manipulation of psychological control and imposition are being used
 satta kii avadharana par vichaar karne ke liye zaruri he ki uske marxvaadi, uttar-aadhunik, nariwadi ayaamon or hanna arendt dwaara pratipaadit satta kii vaikalpik dharna par bhi gaur kar liya jaae
 Marxist scholars believe that in a society divided into classes, the ruling class occupies the means of production and imposes its power over the working class
 poonjeewaadi varg kii satta na keval vichaardhaaratmak, balki aarthik or raajnneetik bhi hoti he
 Marx thought that the dominant forms of ideas, values and beliefs in any society are compatible with the ruling class
 mazdoor varg ke maanas par unheen kii chhap hoti he jiskaa nateeja shramikon kii ‘bhrant chetana’ main nikalataa he
 Due to this form of consciousness, the workers do not recognize the reality of their exploitation
 isiilie unke ‘vaastavik’ hit yani poonjeewaadi ke unmoolan or unke ‘anubhoot’ hit main antar bana rahata he
 Lenin believed that due to the power of the capitalist ideology, the working class can achieve maximum 'trade union consciousness' only
 arthath vah poonjeewaadi vyavastha ke daayre ke bheetar apni jivan-sthitiyaan sudhaarney se pare nahin ja paata
 Michel Fuco in his discourse has drawn attention to the formula between power and thought systems
 phuko vimarsh ko saamaajik sambandhon or aacharnon kii aisi pranali ke rup main dekhte hai jo apane daayre main rahane vaale logon ko apane hisaab se taatpary thamati rahati he
 Whether it is psychiatry, medicine, justice system, or prison, academic discipline or political ideologies, Fuco's eyes are all systems of discourse and thus are forms of power
 phuko ke mutabik aadhunik yug main satta kisi ko kuch karne se nahin rokatii, balki asmitaaon or atmparakataaon kii rachana karti he
 There is no single center of power such as a state or ruling class, but it flows throughout the system in the same way that blood flows through the arteries in the body
 is prakriya kaa niyantran ‘shaskiyata’ ke zariye kiya jaataa he
 a vast bureaucratic system classifies people by adopting them in an unforeseen manner
 samaaj ko uttarottar sangathit or samaroopikrut karte hue un par nigaraanee ke vibhinn rup thope jate hai
 In this process, people express various kinds of self-esteem
 isi aatmsatikaran ke madhyam se vyakti satta ko ‘normal’ dhang se sweekaar karata rahata he
 Governmentalism transforms a person into a subject through this 'normalization'
 subject ek aisi abhivyakti he jiskaa ek arth he swatantra kartta or doosraa he shasit praja kaa sadsy
 Fuco means that as soon as the subject changes into a subject through discussion, a person goes into the vows of governmental activities
 nariwadi vidwaan satta ko pitrusatta kii avadharana kii roshni main parakhte hai
 Patriarchy is such a ubiquitous structure of domination that works at every level
 pitrusatta ke tahat koi stri vyaktigat str par sattavan bhi ho sakati he
 But it will have to work within the limits set by the patriarchal regime
 masalan, ghar ke daayre main stri saas ke rup main to ek had tak sattadhari ho sakati he, par beti, bahu, patni yaa bahin ke rup main nahin
 Everywhere his position is forced to be defined relative to the man and the relationship with him
 akeli or pruthak koi asmita na hone ke kaaran vah adrishy or satta se vanchit hone ke liye abhishpt he
 According to feminists, there is no homogenous structure of patriarchy which is found in the same form everywhere
 itihaas, bhugol or samskruti ke mutabik uske bhinn-bhinn rup milte hai
 In addition, patriarchy is also interrelated with other forms of exploitation and domination
 har jagah uske prabhaav alag-alag nikalate hai
 An American white woman and an Indian Dalit woman have to face persecution of patriarchy differently
 hanna arent satta ko keval prabhutv kii sanrachana ke taur par dekhne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 His creation 'what is Authority?' They interpret power as an increased capacity that is achieved through collective action
 log jab aapas main samvaad sthapit karte hai or mil-jul kar ek saajha udhyam kii khaatir kadam uthaate hai to us prakriya main satta udbhoot hoti he
 This form of power provides the basis on which a person is active by standing and carrying moral responsibility

 Alexander Graham Bell is known more generally as the inventor of the telephone
 bahut kam log hi yah jaanate hai ki graham bel ne na keval telephone, balki communication technology ke kshetra main kai or bhi upyogi avishkaar kiye hai
 He is also credited with inventing optical-fiber systems, photophones, bell and decibel units, metal-detectors, etc
 ye sabhi aisi takanic par aadhaarit hai, jiske bina sanchaar-kranti kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 Graham Bell was born on 3 March 1847 in Edinburgh, Scotland
 graham bel kii vilakshan pratibha kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ve mahaj teraa varsh ke umr main hi graduate ho gaye the
 It is also very surprising that at the age of sixteen, he became famous as a great music teacher
 aapangata kisi bhi vyakti ke liye ek abhishaap se kam nahin hoti, lekin graham bel ne aapangata ko abhishaap nahin banane diya
 Actually, Graham Bell's mother was deaf
 maa ke sunne main asamarthta se graham bel kaaphi dukhi or niraash rahete the, lekin apni niraashaa ko unhone kabhi apni safalataa kii raah main rukaawat nahin banane diya
 He thought it better to give his disappointment a positive mode
 yahi kaaran tha ki ve dhwani vigyaan kii madad se na sun paane main asamarth logon ke liye aisa yantra banane main kaamyaab hue, jo aaj bhi badhir logon ke liye kisi vardaan se kam nahin he
 It would probably not be wrong to say that Graham Bell spent his entire life working for deaf people
 unki maa to badhir thim hin, graham bel kii patni or unka ek khaas dost bhi sunne main asamarth tha
 Since he had felt the pain of such people very closely from the beginning, he could understand better what should be done for the betterment of his life
 ho saktaa he ki shaayad apane jivan kii inhen khaas paristhitiyon kii vajah se graham bel telephone ke avishkaar main safal ho paae hon
 Graham Bell had a keen interest in sound science since childhood, so at the age of 23, he made a piano whose melodious voice could be heard far enough
 kuch samay tak ve spich technology vishay ke teacher bhi rahe the
 During this time, he continued his efforts and was successful in creating an instrument that was capable of sending not only musical notes, but also articulated speech
 yahi telephone kaa sabase purana model tha
 As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father
 ek kam umr main, haalanki, unhone kaha ki vah keval pehle chaar roopon ko puraa karne, skool 15 saal kii umr main chhod diya he jo royal hai skool, edinburgh, scotland, main namankit kiya gaya tha
 His school record was unsolved, marked by absenteeism and non-committal grades
 vah apane maang kii pita kii niraashaa karne ke liye, udaseenta ke saath skool ke anya vishyon kaa ilaaj kiya he, jabaki unka mukhya byaaj

 Since most of what humans do is accurate within the social structure or category of social activity, sociology has gradually shifted its focus to other disciplines such as medical, military and penal organizations, public relations and even scientific knowledge
 Focused on the role of social activities in construction

 The term "sociologie" was first coined in 1780 in an unpublished manuscript by the French essayist Emmanuel Josef Seus
 yah baad main august comt dwaara 1838 main sthapit kiya gaya
 Earlier the Comte used the term "social physics", but was later adopted by others, notably the Belgian statistician Adolf Kiotlet
 Comt attempted to unify history, psychology and economics through scientific understanding of social fields
 francisi kranti kii vyakulata ke sheeghra baad hi likhte hue, unhone prasthaapit kiya ki saamaajik nishchayaatmakataa ke madhyam se saamaajik buraaiyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa he, yah da course in positive philosophy or e general vyuu of positivism main ullikhit ek darshanashastreey drushtikon he
 Comt believed that a 'positivist level' would mark the final stages in the order of human understanding, followed by religious speculation and spiritual stages

 aarambhik siddhantkaron kaa samajashaastra kii ore krambaddh drushtikon, is vishay ke saath prakruti vigyaan ke samaan hi vyapak taur par vyavhaar karnaa tha
 Empiricism and scientific method were sought to value any social claim or conclusion to provide an undisputed basis and to separate sociology from relatively less empirical fields such as philosophy

 Emil Durkheim was a great supporter of theoretically based empirical research, seeking connections between "social facts" to reflect structural rules
 unki sthiti "anomi" ko khaarij karne or saamaajik sudhaar ke liye saamaajik nishkarshon main unki ruchi se anupranit hoti thi
 Today, Durkheim's description of scholarly positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and over-simplification: Comet was the only prominent social thinker who claimed that the social department could also fall under the same scientific analysis as elite science, while Durkheim Has acknowledged the fundamental knowledge boundaries in more detail

 iske baavjood marks ne aitihaasik bhautikwaad ke aarthik niyatwaad par aadhaarit science of socity prakashit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Other philosophers, including Heinrich Rieckert and Wilhelm Dilthey, argued that the natural world is different from the social world social reality because of the specific aspects of human society that fascinate human culture

 Max Weber argued that sociology can be interpreted lightly as a 'science', as it is able to identify causal relationships — particularly between the ideal class or imaginary simplification of complex social phenomena
 baharhaal, prakritik vaigyanikon dwaara khoje jane vaale sambandhon ke vipareet ek gaiyr pratyakshvaadi ke rup main, ek vyakti sambandhon kii talash karata he jo "anaitihaasik, aparivartaneey, athwa saamaanya he"

 Psychological knowledge applies to different areas of human action, including issues of daily life and -; Such as family, education and employment and - and treatment of mental health problems
 Psychologists try to understand the role of mental function in personal and social behavior, while also working on the physiology and neural processes underlying it

manovigyaan main prakritik vigyaan, saamaajik vigyaan or manviki ke anusandhan bhi shaamil hai
 The study of psychology in philosophical context refers to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China and India
 manovigyaan ne madhyakaal main adhik naidanik or prayogtmak drushtikon apana liya jab muslim manovaigyanikon or chikitsakon ne aise uddeshyon ke liye manorog aspataal banane shuru kar die
 In 1802, the French psychologist Pierre Cabanese tried to advance bio-psychology through his essay Reperts du Physique et du Moral d'i hom
 Cabanis interpreted and reasoned about the brain in light of earlier studies of biology
 Given that sensitivity and spirit are qualities of the nervous system

 That is why 1879 is sometimes called the "date of birth" of psychology

 Other important early contributors to this field are Herman Ebbinghaus, a pioneer in studying memory at the University of Berlin; And the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov who discovered the learning process known today as Classical Conditioning
 1890 se lekar 1939 main unki mrityu tak, austria ke chiktsak sigmund frud ne manashchikitsa kii ek vidhi kaa vikaas kiya jise manovishleshan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Fried's understanding of the brain was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations, and particularly focused on unconscious conflict, mental stress, and psychopathology
 frud ke siddhant bahut hi lokapriy ho gaye kyonki inhone kai vishyon jaise kaamuktha, daman or achet mastishk ko mano vaigyanik vikaas ke saamaanya pahaluon ke rup main niyantrit kiya
 At that time, they were widely considered a banned topic and Freud provided a catalyst for them to discuss this openly in all the society
 Although Freud was perhaps best known for his tripartite model of the brain, including his theories about ID, ego and hyper-ego, and the idipus complex, his most enduring legacy is probably not his theories but his clinical innovations, such as Method of free association and clinical interest in dreams

 More recently, however, South African neurologist Mark Solms and other researchers in the developing field of neural psychoanalysis argue that Freud's theories point to the structures of the brain related to Freud's concept, such as libido, drives
 , Stun and repression

 Furthermore, unlike early psychologists Wilhelm Wundt and William James, who studied the brain through introspection, behavioral scientists argued that the components of the brain were not open to scientific inquiry, and scientific psychology should refer only to observational behavior 
 aantarik pradhinidhitiv yaa mastishk ke bare main koi vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 Pragmatism was introduced in the 20th century by American psychologist John B
 Watson, expanded by Americans Edward Thorndyke, Clark L
 Hull, Edward C
 Tolman, and later B
 F
 Skinner
 vyaavhaarikta anya drushtikonon se kai prakaar se vibhinn he
 Behaviorists focus on the behavior – environment relationship and analyze open and personal behavior as the function of an organism, which interacts with its environment

 Concepts such as "brain" and "consciousness" are not used by behavioral scientists, because such terms do not describe actual psycho-scientific phenomena, but are used as hidden explanatory entities elsewhere in the organism
 
 iske vipareet, vyaavhaarikta nijee ghatnaon ko vyavhaar maanata he or unhen khule vyavhaar ke tareeke se hi vishleshit karata he
 Behavior is used for concrete events of the organism, open or private

 manovigyaan ke ek vyapak model ke rup main vyaavhaarikta ke arohan ne, haalaanki, agle prabhavi udhaaharan, sangyanatmak drushtikon ko rasta diya he
 Human psychology developed in 1950, in response to both pragmatism and psychoanalysis

 These include an emphasis on subjective meaning, a rejection of determinism, and references to positive development rather than pathology
 Some of the founding theories behind this school of ideas were the plaintiff American psychologist Abraham Maslow, who created a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, the client
 - Created and developed focused medicine; And Fritz Perls, a german-american psychiatrist who contributed to the creation and development of Gestalt medicine
 yah itnaa prabhavi ban gaya kii manovigyaan, vyaavhaarikta or manovishleshan main "teesraa bal" kaha jane laga
 Influenced by the work of the German philosopher Martin Hideger and the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, the psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rölö developed an existential species of psychology between 1950 and 1960
 astitv manovaigyanikon ne tark diya kii logon ko apni maran sheeltaa ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 And in doing so people must accept that they are free; They have free will, they are free to have expectations and can ignore their own mean path during their lives
 main kaa ki arth nirmaan karne vaali prakriya kaa ek mukhya tatv, he, myth kii khoj, yaa kathatmak praturup jinamein koi vyakti feet ho saktaa he
 From the standpoint of existence, questions are raised not only for the meaning arising out of acceptance of death, but that the attainment of meaning can cover the possibility of death
 austria ke ek astitv manochikitsak or purna aahuti uttarajive victor frankal ne dekha, "ham jo ekaagratha shiviron main rahete the, un vyaktiyon ko yaad rakh sakate hai jo dusron ko aaraam dete hue jhopadiyon main hokar jate hai, apana roti kaa aakhri tukda bhi dusron ko de dete hai
 These may be very few in number, but they provide sufficient evidence that everything can be withdrawn from one person, but one thing: the last freedom of man; Choosing one's attitude, choosing one's own path in any given set of circumstances
 me ne astitv chikitsa ke vikaas main agrani hone main sahaayta kii or frankal ne isaki kai kismon kaa vikaas kiya jo logo therapy kehalaati hai
 In addition to May and Frankel, the Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binsvenger and the American psychiatrist George Kelly can be said to belong to the school of survival
 astitv or maanavtaa vaadi donon prakaar ke mano vigyaani tark dete hai ki, logon ko apni purna kshamta tak pahunchne ke liye bharpoor koshish kerani chahie, lekin keval maanavtaavaadi manovigyaani vishwaas karte hai ki, yah prayaas sahaj he
 For existential psychologists, this effort leads to a worrying morbidity, freedom, and accountability

 However, the modern field of psychology remained largely influenced by cognitive psychology

 Chomsky used to think intricately about arbitrary ideas of 'stimulus', 'response' and 'reinforcement', ideas that Skinner derived from animal experiments in the laboratory
 chomuski kaa tark tha ki skinner ke vichaar keval jatil maanav vyavhaar jaise bhashaa adhigrahan par ek aspasht or satahi tareeke se lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 Chomsky emphasized that during research and analysis, a child's contribution to language acquisition should not be neglected and proposed that humans are born with a natural ability to acquire language

 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke se lekar hathiyaaron kii kriya ke bare main ek behatar samaj viksit karne ke liye sangyanatmak manovigyaan anusandhan kiya gaya
 Cognitive psychology differs from other psychological perspectives in two main ways
 pehla, yah vaigyanik vidhi ke upyog ko sweekaar karata he or pratikon kaa upyog karne vaale drushtikon jaise frud kii mano gatiki ke vipareet saamanytah aatmanirikshan ko khoj kii ek vidhi ke rup main asweekrut karata he
 Second, it explicitly acknowledges the existence of an internal mental state and — such as belief, desire, and motivation — and while pragmatism does not
 haalaanki, frud or gahare manovigyaniyon kii tarah sangyanatmak manovaigyanik daman sahit achet prakriya main ruchi lete hai, lekin unhen prachaalan-paribhaashit ghatakon ke shabdon main spasht karnaa pasand karte hai, jaise ki achetan prasanskaran or antarnihit smriti jo prayogtmak jaanch ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Yet cognitive psychologists have raised many questions on the existence of these components
 udhaaharan ke liye, american manovaigyanik elizabeth lofts ne un tareekon ke pradarshan ke liye mul vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya he jinamein prakat hone vaali yaadon ko daman ke unmoolan ke bajaay chhalrachana ke madhyam se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Moving forward in the cognitive revolution, over the course of several decades, Herman Ebbinghas has been a pioneer in experimental studies of memory, arguing that higher mental processes are not hidden from view, but instead studied them using experiments can go
 manovaigyanik gatividhi or mastishk or tantrika tantra ke kaaryon ke bich kii kadiyon ko samajha gaya, aisa aanshik rup se kuch logon ke praayogic kaary ke kaaran hua jaise angreji mano vaigyanik aucharles sherington or canada ke mano chiktsak donald olding hebb tathaa aanshik rup se mastishk kshati se yukt logon ke adhyayan se hua
 These brain-body links were elucidated by cognitive neuropsychologists in length

 Cognitive psychology is included among other disciplines such as neuroscience under the discipline of philosophy of mind, computer science and cognitive science
 vichaaron ke kai skulon kaa tark he ki ek maargdarshan siddhant ke rup main ek vishesh model kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jiske dwaara sabhi yaa adhikansh maanav vyavhaar ko spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Their popularity has been increasing and decreasing over time

 aadhunik samay main, manovigyaan ne sachetata, vyavhaar or saamaajik antarkriya kii samaj kii disha main ek ekikrut drushtikon ko apanaaya he
 This perspective is commonly called bio-psycho-social approach

 It can be difficult to draw a line between normal and abnormal behavior
 saamanyatayah, asaamaanya vyavhaar an anukulit hona chahie or yah ek vyaktigat mahatvapurn pareshaani kaa kaaran hota he taaki naidanik or anusandhan prakriya ko lagu kiya ja sake
 According to DSM-IV-TR, behaviors can be considered abnormal if they are related to disability, personal discomfort, violation of social norms or wrong actions
 jaivik manovigyaan vyavhaar or maansik avasthaaon ke jaivik substrates kaa vaigyanik adhyayan he
 Assuming every behavior to be related to the nervous system, biological psychologists feel it is sensible to study the functioning of the brain to understand behavior
 yah vah drushtikon he jo vyavhaar tantrika vigyaan, sangyanatmak tantrika vigyaan or tantrika mano vigyaan main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Neuropsychology is a branch of psychopathology that helps to understand how the structure and function of the brain are related to specific behavioral and psychological processes
 tantrika mano vigyaan vishesh rup se mastishk kii kshati ko samajhane se sambandhit he, taaki saamaanya mano vaigyanik kaaryon ko banaaye rakhane ke liye prayaas kiya ja sake
 Cognitive neuroscience approaches use neural imaging tools to study the relationship between the brain and behavior, in order to observe which areas of the brain are active during a particular action
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan anubhuti kaa or vyavhaar ke tahat aane vaali maansik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he, yah mastishk ko samajhane ke liye soochna sansaadhan kaa upyog ek dhaanche ke rup main karata he
 Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are also fields of research
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan vichaaron ke ek sccol se sambandhit he jo anubhuti ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jise maanane waalon kaa tark he ki maansik kriya kaa soochna sansaadhan modal, yaqiin or prayogtmak manovigyaan ke dwaara suchit hota he
 On a broader level, cognitive science is a joint venture of cognitive psychologists, neurobiologists, and researchers of artificial intelligence, logicians, linguists, and social scientists, and puts greater emphasis on computational theory and formalization
 donon hi kshetra computesnal model kaa upyog ruchi kii ghatana kaa anukaran karne ke liye karte hai
 Because mental phenomena cannot be directly observed, computational models use a tool to study the functional organization of the brain
 is tarah ke model sangyanatmak manovaigyanikon ko ek aisa tarika bataate hai ki jisase ve hardware se swatantra rahakar maansik prakriyaaon ke software kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai, phir chaahe wo mastishk ho yaa computer
 In comparative psychology, the study of behavior and mental life in animals other than humans
 yah manovigyaan ke baahar anushaasan se sambandhit he jisamen jantu vyavhaar jaise ithology kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 Counseling psychologists are working in a variety of locations such as universities, hospitals, schools, government organizations, businesses, private practice, and community mental health centers
 naidanik manovigyaan main manovigyaan kaa adhyayan or anuprayog shaamil he jo manovigyaan par aadhaarit tanaav yaa rog se aaraam dilaane ke liye, use rokane yaa samajhane ke liye kiya jaataa he or vyaktiparak jeevon ke va vyaktigat vikaas ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Its practice centers are psychological assessment and psychiatry, although clinical psychiatrists may engage in research, teaching, counseling, forensic testimony, and in the development and administration of the program
 kuch naidanik manovaigyanik mastishk kii chot ke rogiyon main naidanik prabandhan par dhyaan kendrit kar sakate hai- yah kshetra naidanik tantrika manovigyaan kehalaata he

 The four key perspectives are psychodynamics, cognitive behavior, existential-humanism, and tantra or family therapy
 There has been a growing movement to integrate these various medical approaches, particularly in relation to issues of culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation
 With an increasing understanding
 mano chikitsa ke sambandh main adhik majboot shodh nishkarshon ke aagaman ke saath, is baat ke pramaan bad gaye hai kii adhikansh mukhya chikitsaayen baraabar prabhavita kii hoti hai, jinamein ek prabal chikitsa gathbandhan ke saath saamaanya kunjee tatv hote hai

 As such, it not only criticizes the mental subsets of the status quo, but also criticizes elements of mainstream psychology, which in themselves are seen as contributors to oppressive ideology
 gambhir manovigyaan is vishwaas par kaary karti he ki "manovigyaan kii mukhyadhara ne maanav ke kalyaan ko badhaava dene ke liye kshetra ke naitik janadesh ke ek sankeern drushtikon ko sansthagat rup se sanchalit kiya he" isamen saamaajik buraaiyon ko vyaktigat rup se dur karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he, tuchh or mahatvaheen anusandhan ko protsaahit kiya gaya he or aisi prakriyaaon main bhaag liya gaya he ki gambhir sanviksha ke tahat sakaaratmak tareeke vifal rahe hai
 a serious psychologist may ask if a "work stress case" warrants an effort to alter the large-scale mechanisms that control work, rather than treating the person who experiences stress Does and-; More precisely, who shares the tension with countless other individuals
 koi yah bhi puch saktaa he ki yuddh main tabah ho gaye samudaayon main "mukhya dhara ke aghat prayaas, maanav ke adhikaron or saamaajik nyaay par dhyaan kendrit karne main kyon asafal ho jate hai" sankshep main, gambhir manovigyaan, jahaan yah samaaj ke liye, ek vyakti se vishleshan ke manovaigyanik str ko uthaane main upyukt prathit hota he, or manovigyaan ko unnat ke tulana main adhik roopantaraneey banaata he
