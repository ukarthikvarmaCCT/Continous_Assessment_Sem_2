 In 1901–2, a scholar named mcclung discovered the chromosome
 usee ne kuch siddhant bhi banaae, jo kalantar main vaigyanik anusandhanon dwaara pusht hote gaye
 In this theory it is assumed that the sex of each creature depends on the number of certain chromosomes
 chromosomon kii rachana ko yadi adhik shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi, jaise electron sookshmdarshi dwaara dekha jaae to usamen bhi kuch bahut hi sookshm rachanaayen dikhaai padegi
 They are called genes and it is believed that these transmit the genetic properties of the parent to their offspring
 jantuon or vanaspatiyon ke chromosomon tathaa jeenon ko lekar bahut adhik anusandhan or prayog hue hai
 It has been found that some of the chromosomes found in the reproductive cells of each living organism are known as alingusutra
 ye nar tathaa maadaa donon main ek prakaar ke hi hote hai or sadaa yugma main rahete hai
 Some other types of chromosomes are also found, which are called sex determinants
 ab tak jitne prakaar ke chromosome paae gaye hai, unhen eks, vaai, dablyoo, zed tathaa o kii sangya di gai he
 Male and female are believed to be determined by the same and odd number of these sex-bearing chromosomes, such that sex in humans is determined as follows: 21 aling sutara + 1 eks + 1 vaai = purush; tathaa 21 Alling Sutra + 2x = Female
 chromosomon kii sankhya ke anusaar nar tathaa maadaa ko vishamyugmaki yaa samayugmaki kaha jaataa he
 a creature has a male homozygote, then a female
 pakshiyon, titliyon, machhliyon, jalsthalchar aadi main maadaa vishamyugmaki hoti he
 In these animals, the sex-bearing chromosomes are named z and W, while in other animals and flora, they are referred to as x and Y
 anek praaniyon main eks tathaa vaai hi nar yaa maadaa ling kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 When a sperm with x is combined with a female's egg, the zygote receives two X's and becomes a female
 kintu jab shukranu kaa vaai maadaa ke andey ke eks se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko eks vaai, arthath visham sankhya praapt hoti he or vah nar hota he
 The differentiation found in the chromosomes of males and females of humans and other creatures is shown in the table on the next page
 jis prakaar jantuon main chromosomon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, usee prakaar vanaspatiyon main bhi unka adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Most seed plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they have male and female sexes together
 chromosomon kii gananaa hone par bhi ling kii charchaa keval nar-maadaa-vishleshan ke hi sandarbh main kii jaati he, kyonki ling or anuvanshikta kii samasya vanaspati jagat main nahin he
 Some species have separate male and female plants
 aise paudhon ke bhi eks tathaa vaai chromosomon kaa pataa chalaa he, jaise elodia canadensis, milandrium album aadi
 a seedling plant, Frageria elitior, is described as a bird with chromosomes
 kuch anya paudhon main nar vishmalingi hote hue bhi do vaai tathaa ek eks dhaaran karata he
 At the time of degradation, both y and x are separated and are formed by the formation of two y reproductive cells into a male and an x female embryo
 isi prakaar ling kaa nirdhaaran anya paudhon main bhi hota he
 There are some glands in the body of beings that are called ductless or endocrine
 kuch viksit visheshkar kasheruki jantuon main in grathiyon ke sraavon kaa, jinhen hormone kehete hai, adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Whether or not there are hormones in vegetation is also a controversial subject
 jantuon ke sharir main pai janevaali grathiyon ke naam hai : piyush, piniyal, avatugranthi, parathyroid, thimus, packrius yaa agnyashay, vrikk ; janangranthi, nar main vrushan tathaa maadaa main andashay 
 The hormones originating from these glands have been studied in detail and it has been found that the existence of secondary sexual traits related to masculinity in a male creature and femininity in a female depends on their action
 jin or chromosome keval yah nishchit karte hai ki yugmanaj nar hoga yaa maadaa
 Determination of actual masculinity and femininity and their development in the proper direction is done only with the help of secretions of the ductless glands
 jaise, koi bhrun purush ke rup main janm lene vaala ho to stri hormonon kii sooyee lagaakar athwa use badhiya kar dene or uske sthaan par andashay grathiyon ko aropit kar dene par vah yaa to purnroopen stri ho jayega, yaa usamen stritv ke lakshan viksit ha jaayenge
 xxrep 4 = naam -- nar—maadaa Tortoise - x x - x o kabutar—eks eks, yaa jed jed -- eks o, yaa jed dablyoo Bats - x o - x x chuha -- eks vaai -- eks eks 4 x 4 x x bhed -- eks vaai -- eks eks Chimpanzee - x y - x x jheengur, telchatta, tidde -- eks o, yaa eks vaai -- eks eks Sand - x - x o murga-- eks eks, yaa jed jed -- eks o yaa jed dablyoo Rabbit - x Y, or x o - x x kutta -- eks vaai -- eks eks Buffalo - x y - x x ghoda -- eks vaai -- eks eks Monkey — x y - x x drosophila -- eks vaai -- eks eks After proper study of flora and fauna, it has been found that the determination of sex is not the only result of male and female tendencies
 bhrun ke vikaas ke saath hi saath nar or maadaa nirdharak tatv bhi samaan rup se hi viksit hote hai
 An animal is not only male or female because it is formed by a particular number of chromosomes, but also male or female because it has "suppressed" other elements that are female or male determinants
 sabhi hormonon kaa utpaadan sharir main hota rahata he, at: jab stritv, yaa purushatv nirdharak hormone adhik shaktishaalee honge tab bhrun stri, yaa purush sharir tathaa pravritiyon kii ore agrasar hoga
 The result of the balance of hormones is that the creature is born as a male or female
 court stern ne yah dikhalaayaa he ki yadi kisi stri main do eks ke sthaan par teen eks hon, to usamen apekshaakrit adhik stritv hoga
 But such a woman will be late in the season, extremely young and completely barren
 isi prakaar goldshmit ne limetria japonica naamak shalab kaa adhyayan kar yah batalaaya he ki jab balavaan naron kaa nirbal kiton se sanyugman hota he tab 50% saamaanya nar or 50% antlingi maadaa kii utpatti hoti he
 But 100% of male pests are produced when highly powerful males are mated to weak females

 kriu bhi kehete hai ki bhrun ke ling kaa nirdhaaran keval chromosomon se hi na hokar, unamem paae janevaale jeenon kii tathaa alingsutron main paae jane vaale janakon kii antakriya se bhi hota he, jaise pakshiyon main maadaa vishmalingi eks vaai tathaa nar samalingi eks eks hote hai
 Sexual division in insects does not depend on the reproductive glands
 unke mukhya janakaatmak lakshan is prakaar hote hai : nar eks o, yaa eks vaai ; maadaa eks eks
 In 1923, Finkler cut off the foreheads of some male pests and applied them on females and the foreheads of females
 in prayogon main yah paaya gaya ki kiton ne apane sharir ke anusaar nahin apitu mastak ke anusaar kaam kiya, arthath nar mastak vaali maadaaon ne nar kii bhanti tathaa maadaa mastakwale naron ne maadaa kii bhanti langik lakshan prakat kiye
 There is a clear difference in the shape and form of the male and female of many animals
 ise langik dvirupata kehete hai
 It has been reported that in the third stage of sexual development, differences of male and female began to appear
 dhire-dhire andashay tathaa vrishanon kaa vikaas hua or sahaayak ang bhi kramash: viksit hote gaye
 Male and female genitalia are found in the same body in many lower organisms, and also in flora
 jyon jyon ucch varg kii ore badha jayega to yah milegaa ki ling spasht hi pruthak ho gaye hai or nar tathaa maadaa sharir kii rachana bhi pruthak he
 a familiar example of sexual dimorphism is a marine worm called Bonelia viridis
 isaki maadaa hare rang kii tathaa akruti main ber jaisi hoti he
 Under the stones or in their holes in the ocean floor, this worm lives
 vahiin se apni dwishakhit shund ko baahar laharaate hue yah jeev aahaar dhoondta rahata he
 The male worm is very fine and apart from the genitals, all its other organs are depleted
 maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar nar krimi paropjivi kii bhanti rahata he
 Fertilized ovaries develop like larvae floating freely in water
 yadi koi larva samudratal main baith jaataa he, athwa kisi maadaa ke shund main pahunch nahin paata he, to vah maadaa ke rup main viksit hone lagata he
 But if somehow he reaches by attracting the female to the Shunda, he develops into a male
 maadaa ke shund main bandi bouna nar, sarakate hue use munh main tathaa vahaan se bhi dhire dhire neeche sarakate hue maadaa kii janan nalika main pahunchakar, dimbashyon ko nishechit karata he
 The fertilized ovaries are re-released into the water and swim freely like larvae
 isi prakaar saculina naamak ek paraseete crusteshia nar tathaa maadaa kekadon par ashrith rahata he
 Giard and Smith have written that the body of this crustacea thrives in the crab's abdomen and some parts of the body also come out after penetrating
 jis kekade ke sharir main yah ghusata he, uske jananaangon ko yah chus daalata he
 Due to this, he becomes blind
 adhikansh kekade mar jate hai, kuch nar maadaa gunon se yukt ho jate hai, athwa maadaa kekade antarlingi banakar vrushan tathaa dimbashay donon utpann karne lag jate hai
 Gender linkage means variation in the sexes according to the genes found in sexual chromosomes
 in jeenon par jo gun yaa visheshak nirbhar karte hai, unhen ling sahalagnta kehete hai
 The transmission method of these traits or traits is called sex-linked inheritance, such as XY in male and XX chromosome in female
 koi purush yadi kisi anuvanshik dosha se dooshit he, to keval uske putr hi us dosha ko vanshagati main grahan kar sakate hai, putriyaan nahin
 First, in 1908, Doncaster threw light on this subject
 unhone ek shalab abracsas lacticler kii maadaa kaa abraxs grossulariata ke nar se sanyog karaayaa
 As a result, in the first generation, all moths of the genus Grossulariata were found
 duusari peedi main grossulariata tathaa lacticler ke anupaat 3:1 the, kintu sabhi lacticler maadaa nikle
 This showed that in this creature the male produces one type of gametes, but the female has two types
 at: nar samayugmaji tathaa maadaa vishamyugmaji hoti he
 Bravel states that the x chromosome contains some other types of genetic factors and genes
 yadi yah siddhant thik he, to samayugmaji mata pita ke visheshak unke vishamyugmaji santanon main chale jaayenge
 This principle is called gender cohesion, such as two x chromosomes found in the female of the fruitfly Drosophila and x y in the male
 iske eks chromosomon main laal aankhon ke jin honge, yaa shwet aankhon ke
 Red-eye genes are called effective and white is ineffective
 at: jab shwet tathaa laal aankhon vaali mackhiyon kaa sanyugman hota he, tab laal aankhon vaali santan adhik hoti he
 Haemophilia and color blindness are considered to be the major diseases among the sexes
 shukranu tathaa dimb sanyukt hokar ek yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In the process of Khandi Bhavan, the same fertilized egg divides into several blocks until it becomes a complete embryo
 is prakriya main shukranu ke chromosome tathaa dimb ke chromosome ek saath milakar vibhajit hote rahete hai
 For example, 23 chromosomes of 23 male and 23 chromosomes are combined
 vibhaajan ke samay 23 chromosome ek chor kii ore tathaa 23 duusari ore chale jate hai
 These two ends are also called the daughter nucleus
 vibhaajan kii is saamaanya prakriya main anek prakaar ke dosha utpann ho sakate hai jaise ek centre main 22 chromosome chale jaaen tathaa duusare main 24, yaa koi anya durghatana ghat jaae to ise aviyojan kaha jayega
 Bridges is named with this principle
 inhone san 1916 main kuch utparivarti praaniyon kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 They found that both the x and x and x x y creatures were female, the XO animal was male, but incapable of child production and the OY animal did not increase
 jis praani main ek eks kam tha, use praathmik tathaa jisamen ek eks adhik tha, use gaun aviyojit kaha gaya
 Gender abnormalities occur as a result of the process of degradation
 ye asaamanyataayen mukhyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai : stri purush ubhayalingi tathaa madhyalingi
 Stereotypes - Stereotypes include animals that have characteristics of both male and female, such as butterflies, birds and insect moths, some half of which are female and some have different characteristics in different proportions
 vaigyanikon kaa vishwaas he ki stripurush praani kaa jivan maadaa ke, jisamen eks eks upasthit he, rup main aarambh hota he
 When cell division begins
 us samay vibhajit koshika ke ek bhaag main chromosem kii sankhya main ghatbad ho jaati he
 As a result, only one y is present in a dividing cell
 is prakaar ke chromosomon kii asmaan sankhya ke kaaran nar tathaa maadaa kii akritiyon main bhinnata hoti jaati he
 Tests of the internal structure of such female-male beings reveal that their sperm and egg genitalia are also present
 yah asaamanyata un main adhik maatra main pai jaati he jinamein hormono kaa prabhaav atyalp hota he, athwa sarvatha nahin hota
 This is the reason why barbarism is not found in other developed and higher beings except for some birds
 ubhalingta - sansar ke lagbhag sabhi jeev ubhayalingi hote hai
 On the basis of which a creature develops in the direction of masculinity and femininity, not all scientists are unanimous in this regard
 koshika vibhaajan ke samay chromosomon kii sankhya main kyon antar aa jaataa he, athwa linganirmaan ke samay volfi tathaa mulari vahiniyon main se ek kaa kyon hraas ho jaataa he, yaa purushatv athwa stritv nirdharak hormone kisi niyam, yaa maatra se, kyon or kaise ni:sravit hote hai? in sab prashnon kaa koi santoshjanak uttar abhi vaigyanik nahin de paae hai
 Therefore, we will assume that being a man or a woman is a matter of coincidence
 prayek praani main yah kshamta hoti he ki vah nar, yaa maadaa main viksit ho jaae
 Bisexual is a vivid example of this
 ubhayalingi kai prakaar ke hote hai, jaise aise praani jo swanishechan karte hai, jaise hydra, feetakrimi, chapatakrimi aadi, duusare aise praani hote hai jo nishechan ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar karte hai; jaise kentua, jonk aadi
 In many species of plants too, some flowers in the same plant are found only in a particular part of the plant
 ucch shrenee ke anek paudhon main ek hi phool main strikesar tathaa punkesar samipsth hote hai taaki garbhaadhan main saralata ho
 In bisexuals, the internal and external characteristics of male and female are found simultaneously
 bhekon kii maadaaon main shukr tathaa naron main dimb granthiyaan praaia: saath saath pai jaati hai
 Egg testes have also been found in turtles
 kabutaron main nar kii shukr granthi dimb tathaa taramin kii maadaa ke dimbashay main vrushan paae gaye hai
 In crabs, testes and ovaries have been found together
 ilasmobrac machhliyon main niskriy vrushan or sakriy dimbashay saath saath paae gaye hai
 Some fish were also found which had two ovaries and one testis
 madhyalingta - yah vah sthiti he jab koi praani kisi ek ling kii ore viksit hote hote sahasaa, kisi karanvash, duusare ling ko bhi dhaaran kar le
 This is the condition of eunuchs in humans

 They will be either male or female in shape
 aise praani vandhya hote hai
 Bravel has stated that the genital glands of the innermost are of the same type, but some or all of the supporting organs and secondary characteristics decide the other sex, and their actual development takes place only through the influence of hormones
 san 1923 main kriu ne kuch gharelu pashuon kii jaanch kii or paaya ki unamem mithyaa madhyalingta thi, arthath kuch main to nari jananaang atyant sankuchit the, kuch main sidhe or spasht, kintu anpekshit lambey the, tathaa kuch main spashtat: nar ke samaan, kintu apurna nalikayukta the
 Testis and ovum glands were also present in some
 purushon main kuch ko masik dharm hote tathaa kuch ko doodh pilaate hue paaya gaya he
 Lesions in the genitalia, or surgery, or hormone use can cause mediastinitis
 anek praaniyon main swat: ling parivartan hota rahata he, unka jeevanchakra is prakaar hota he : nar r ubhayalingi r maadaa 
 In Bonalia, parasitic crabs, horses, bees, taramines, and birds often undergo physical changes
 praaia: sabhi vaigyanikon ne murgo main langik parivartan kaa adhyayan kiya he or paaya he ki koi murga aarambh main maadaa tha or andey detaa tha, kintu, dimbashay main rog ho jane ke kaaran andotpaadan band ho gaya
 The hen's symptoms gradually started appearing in the hen and she started conception in the hens
 kriu kaa kahana he ki maadaaon main saamaanya dimbashay ke saath saath ek chota, alpavardhit vrushan bhi hota he
 The testis become active as the ovaries become inactive
 yahi sthiti un murgiyon kii hui jinaki dimbugranthiyaan katkar nikaal di gai thim
 An unusual event called the independent Martin is mentioned in the twins of the four-footed
 yah hormone prabhaav kaa udhaaharan he
 There are three types of twins: both male or both female, or one male and one female
 antim prakaar main aisa hone kii sambhaavna rahati he ki bhruneey vikaas main donon bhrunon main parsparik rakt kaa pravaah ek sharir se duusare sharir main hota rahe
 In such a situation, exchange of hormones can also take place
 nar hormone pehle viksit hota he or judawon ko nartv kii ore le chalata he
 The female hormone develops late and makes one of the twins fundamentally female
 falswaroop jo maadaa utpann hogi, usamen nar ke spasht lakshan honge or vah vandhya hogi
 Lily states that the twins of the quadruped have normal blood flow and that the female actually receives male hormonal blood
 anya pashuon main judawon main saamaanya raktapravaah kii vyavastha nahin hoti, at: unamem swatantra martin nahin hote
 The effect of sex change is also seen on humans
 praaia: samachaarpatron main padhane ko miltaa he ki amuk kaa ling parivartan ho gaya
 In the Olympic Chapters of 1935 and 36, two women were found who later became men
 manushyon main yauvanarambh ke purv yadi stri purush kii janangranthiyaan kaat di jaaen, to unka ling parivartan to ho jayega, kintu ve purnataya stri, yaa purush nahin ho sakenge or na to santonotpaadan hi kar sakenge
 Their expressions will be feminized, or masculine
 pakshiyon main lingaparivartan stritv se purushatv kii ore hi hota he
 This means the origin, status and rate of death of a male and female in any animal group
 yah anumaan kiya jaataa he ki kam se kam manushyon main pratham santan nar hi hoti he
 Most of the children are male even in the days of war, because nature itself fulfills the shortage of males
 praathmik ling anupaat kii baat keval manushya hi nahin, apitu pashu jagat main bhi lagu hoti he
 There are also more animals in those animals that live in harem, like some species of monkeys, honey bees, ants, termites etc
 ek ghoda anek ghodiyon ko garbhit karata he
 If she copulates more often, then the sex ratio can undergo a dramatic change
 murgi se balpurvak bachche paidaa karaae jaaen, to maadaa bachche adhik paidaa honge
 In relation to the secondary sex ratio, Creu has stated some rules: praaniyon kii jatiyon ke saath anupaat ghatata badhata rahata he, jaise 100 maadaaon ke anupaat main manushya nar 103-107, ghoda 98
6, kutta 118
5, choupaae 107
3, bhed 97
7, boar 111
8, khargosh, 104
6, murga 93
4-94
7, kabutar 115, machhlee, kots 188 tathaa lophius 385 hote hai
 Ratios vary by species, race and tribe, such as: 106 in the United States, 93
5 in Great Britain, 95
3 in Spain, 96
9 in Germany, 97
9 in France, 98
4 in Belgium, 99 in Italy, 100 in Poland, 102 are found in Japan, 104 in India and 125 in China, and 104–105 in Jews per 100 females
 lagic anupaat main prati varsh antar hota rahata he
 The special mating season of the year also has an effect on animals
 mata pita kii aayu or shaareerik avasthaa kaa prabhaav santanon ke anupaat par padataa he
 The chronological number of pregnancies affects the sex ratio
 do garbhon ke bich kaa kram bhi prabhaavshaalee hota he
 According to Kurt Stern, the number of males in illegal offspring is less than females
 dusron ke anusaar nagarikaran, sankaran, saamaajik aarthik avasthaa, bhugolic vaataavaran aadi kaa bhi prabhaav linganupaat par padataa he
 The sex ratio is determined by sex conversion in other animals, such as the ratio of male and female in the immature creatures of Geophorus hilary to 0
5: 1, but in mature creatures this ratio is the opposite
 chonch pakshiyon ke mukh kaa ek shaareerik ang hota he jise raksha va akraman karne, vastuon va grass ko pakadaney, swayan ko svachh rakhane, shishuon ko khaanaa dene, chizein tatolane or pranay-kriyaaon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 It occurs almost at the same place where some other creatures have a snout

 Mouth blisters can occur due to viral, fungal and bacterial processes
 munh ke rogajanak chhaalon ke utpann hone kaa ek kaaran apane haathon ko dhoye bina apane fate honton ko choona he
 The reason for this happening is that the bacteria on your hands penetrate through the small, open cracks produced by your cracked lips

 Dengue fever is an infection caused by the dengue virus
 dengue kaa ilaaj samay par karnaa bahut jaruri hota hai
 machhar dengue virus ko sancharit karte hai
 Dengue fever is also known as "bone fracture", because it can cause so much pain to the people who have broken their bones
 dengue bukaar ke kuch lakshanon main bukhaar; sirdard; twachaa par chechak jaise laal chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard shaamil hai
 In some people, dengue fever can occur in one or two forms that can be life-threatening
 pehla, dengue rakthasravi bukaar he, jiske kaaran rakt vahikaaon, main raktasrav yaa risaav hota he tathaa rakt platelets kaa str kam hota he
 The second is dengue shock syndrome, which leads to dangerously low blood pressure
 dengue virus chaar bhinn-bhinn prakaaron ke hote hai
 If a person gets an infection from one of these types of viruses, then usually he is protected from that type of dengue virus throughout his life
 halanki baaki ke teen prakaaron se vah kuch samay ke liye hi surakshit rahata he
 If he is infected with one of these three types of virus, then he is more likely to have serious problems
 logon ko dengue virus se bachaane ke liye koi vaxin uplabdh nahin he
 There are some measures that should be taken to save people from dengue fever
 log apane ko machharon se bachaa sakate hai tathaa unase kaate jane kii sankhya ko simit kar sakate hai
 Scientists say that mosquitoes can grow and shrink
 yadi kisi ko dengue bukaar ho jaay to vah aamtaur par apni beemaari ke kam yaa simit hone tak paryaapt taral pikar thik ho saktaa he
 If the person's condition is more serious, he may need intravenous or blood transfusion
 1960 se, kaaphi log dengue bukaar se peedit ho rahe hai
 The disease has become a worldwide problem since World War II
 yah 110 deshon main aam he
 Each year around 50–100 million people suffer from dengue fever
 virus kaa pratyaksh upachaar karne ke liye log vaxin tathaa dawaaon par kaam kar rahe hai
 People also take many different measures to get rid of mosquitoes
 dengue bukaar kaa pehla varnan 1779 main likhaa gaya tha
 In the early 20th century, scientists learned that the disease is caused by the dengue virus and it is transmitted through mosquitoes
 dengue ko kai varshon purv sabase pehle likhaa gaya tha
 The Jin Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine speaks of a person who may have had dengue
 kitaab ek "jal jehar " rog ke bare main bataata he jiskaa sambandh udne vaale kiton se tha
 Written documents from the 17th century also discuss an epidemic that may be dengue
 sabase adhik sambhavit dengue mahamari kii aarambhik report 1779 tathaa 1780 kii he
 These reports speak of an epidemic that engulfed Asia, Africa and North America
 us samay se 1940 tak bahut sari mahamariyaan nahin hui
 In 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infected with "aedes" mosquitoes
 1907 main vaigyanikon ne darshaya ki dengue kaa kaaran virus he
 This was only the second disease that was shown to be caused by the virus
 jon bartan clayland tathaa joseph franklin siller dengue ke virus kaa adhyayan karte rahe or virus ke vistaar ke aadhaar kaa pataa lagaaya
 Dengue started spreading more rapidly after the second world war
 mana gaya ki yuddh ne paryaavaran ko kai tareeko se badla
 Different types of dengue spread to new areas
 logo ko pehali baar rakthasravi dengue bukhaar hona shuru hua
 This horrific type of Daegu was first reported in the Philippines in 1953
 1970 ke aate-aate rakthasravi dengue bukhaar bacchon main mrityu kaa pramukh kaaran ban gaya
 It started happening in the Pacific region and also in America
 rakthasravi dengue bukhaar tathaa dengue shock syndrome sabase pehle madhya tathaa dakshin america main 1981 main report kiya gaya
 At this time healthcare professionals noticed that those who had been affected by the type 1 dengue virus were being affected by the type 2 dengue virus after a few years
 yah spasht nahin he ki shabd "dengue" kahaan se aayaa
 Some people believe that the word came from the Swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo
 yah vaakyansh buree atmaaon se hone vaali beemaari ke bare main bataata he
 The Swahili word dinga is believed to be derived from the Spanish word dengue
 is shabd kaa arth he "saavdhaan"
 The term may have been used to refer to a person who suffers from bone pain of dengue fever; That pain would force the person to walk with caution
 halanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki spani shabd swahili bhashaa se aayaa ho, na ki jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he
 Others believe that the name "dengue" came from the West Indies
 west indies main, dengue se peedit gulam "e dendi" kii tarah khadey hone vaale or chalane vaale kahe jate the or isi kaaran se beemaari ko bhi "dendi fever" kaha jaataa tha
 The name "bone-breaking fever" was first used by the United States "founding father" Benjamin Rush, a physician
 1789 main rash ne "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam kaa upyog ek report main kiya jo 1780 main philadelphia main huye dengue ke prakope par thi
 In the report, Rush used the more formal name "billius Remitting Fever"
 shabd "dengue bukhaar" 1828 tak aam taur par upyog main nahin tha
 Earlier, different people used different names for the disease
 udhaaharan ke liye dengue ko "brikeheart fever" tathaa "laa dengue" bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Several names were used for complex dengue: for example "infectus thrombocytopenic purpura", "philippine", "thai" and "singapore hemorrhagic fever"
 dongu kaa pratham mahamari roopen hamalaa ek saath asia, africa, uttari america me ek saath 1780 ke lagbhag hua tha, is rog ko 1779 me pahachaanaa tathaa naam diya gaya tha
 In the 1950s, it started spreading in this continuous epidemic in Southeast Asia and by 1975, dengue hemorrhage fever has become the leading cause of child death in these countries
 1990 ke dashak tak dengue malaria ke pashchaat machharon dwaara failane vaala doosraa sabase bada rog ban gaya jisase saal bhar me 4 karod log sankramit hote he vahiin dengue hamerej fever ke bhi hajaaron maamle saamne aate he
 In February 2002, when dengue spread in Rio de Janeiro, 1 million people were hit by it, due to which 16 people died
 march 2008 tak bhi is shahar me dasha bahut acchhee nahin thi keval 3 maheene main 23,555 maamle or 30 maute hui thi
 There is a big outbreak of dengue in about five to six years, because the annual cycle that comes with this disease gives resistance to the patients for some time, as in cases of chikungunya
 jab yah pratirodh kshamta samaapt ho jaati he to log rog ke prati phir se samvedansheel ho jate he, phir dengue ke chaar prakaar ke virus hote he, iske alaava naye log jansankhya me janm yaa pravaas ke jariye jud jate he
 There is ample evidence that SB Halstead has proved by a study that dengue haemorrhagic fever is more common in patients who suffer from secondary infections than those with primary infection
 yadhpi is dharna ko thik se samajha nahin ja sakaa he keval kuch model he jo iske bare me mat vyakt karte he, is dasha ko paramsankraman kii dasha kehete he
 Every year 4000-5000 cases of this disease occur in Singapore, however the common belief is that many cases remain hidden
 dengue ke lakshan dengue virus se sankramit lagbhag 80% logon main koi lakshan nahin hote hai yaa behad halke lakshan hote hai
 About 5% of the infected people become seriously ill
 in logon kii ek choti sankhya main, beemaari jivan ke liye khatarnaak hoti he
 Symptoms occur in a person 3 to 14 days after suffering from dengue virus
 lakshan aksar 4 se 7 dinon ke baad hi dikhte hai
 In this way, if a person returns from an area where dengue is common and he or she has fever or other symptoms 14 days after his or her return, then he / she may not have dengue
 aksar jab bacchon ko dengue bukaar hota he to unke lakshan aam sardi-zukaam yaa antrashoth ) hote hai
 However, children are more likely to develop serious problems with dengue fever
 dengue bukaar ke aise adarsh lakshan kam hote hai jo achaanak shuru ho jate hai jaise sirdard ; chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard
 The disease's nickname "bone fracture" refers to how severe this pain can be
 dengue bukaar teen charnon In the fever phase, a person usually has high fever
 bukaar aksar 40 degree celsius hota he
 The person may have general pain and headache
 yah charan aamtaur par 2 se 7 din tak chalata he
 About 50 to 80% of the people who have symptoms in this stage have rashes
 pehle yaa duusare din, chakatte laal twachaa jaise dikh sakate hai
 In the later days of the disease, rashes may look like smallpox
 chote laal daag twachaa par ubhar sakate hai
 These stains do not remove on pressing the skin
 ye laal daag tuuti keshikaon ke kaaran banate hai
 The person may have mild bleeding from the mouth and nose through the mucous membrane
 bukaar apane aap kam hone lagata he tathaa ek yaa do dinon ke liye waapas hone lagata he
 However, this pattern varies among different people
 kuch logon main, ucch bukaar ke jane ke baad beemaari gambhir charan main pravesh kar jaati he
 The severe phase lasts from one to two days
 is charan ke dauraan, chaati tathaa pet main taral kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he, aisa isaliye kyonki rakt nalikaaon main risaav hota he
 Fluid is formed and it circulates throughout the body
 iskaa arth he ki mahatvapurn angon ko unki aavashyaktaa ke anusaar aam taur par rakt nahin miltaa he
 For this reason, organs are unable to function normally
 vyakti ko atyadhik raktasrav bhi ho saktaa he 
 Less than 5% of people with dengue experience circulatory shock, dengue stroke syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever
 yadi kisi vyakti ko pehle kisi duusare prakaar kaa dengue hua ho to usko aisi gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 In the rectification phase, the fluid that leaks out of the blood vessels is incorporated back into the bloodstream
 sudhaar charan 2 se 3 dinon tak chalata he
 The person often becomes much better during this phase
 halanki, unako gambhir khujalaahat tathaa dhimi hriday gati kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 During this phase, the person may go into a liquid overload state
 yadi yah dimag ko prabhavit karata he to, yah chetana ke str main parivartan yaa daure jaisi sthiti laa saktaa he 
 Sometimes dengue can affect other mechanisms of our body
 kisi vyakti main keval lakshan ho sakate hai yaa adarsh dengue lakshan bhi saath main ho sakate hai
 The level of consciousness may decrease in 0
5–6% of cases
 aisa tab ho saktaa he jab dengue virus mastishk main sankraman paidaa karata he
 This can happen even when vital organs are not functioning properly
 anya snayutantr sambandhi vikaar un logon main darj kiye gayi hai jinako dengue bukaar hota he
 For example, dengue can cause transverse myelitis and guillian-barre syndrome
 halanki aisa lagbhag nahin hota he, lekin dengue dil kaa sankraman tathaa gambhir jigar kii vifaltaa paidaa kar saktaa he
 Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus
 vah vaigyanik pranali jisamen virus kaa vargeekaran tathaa namakaran kiya jaataa he uske antargat dengue virus "flaviviriday" parivaar tathaa "flaviviras" jin kaa hissaa he
 Other viruses also belong to this family and can cause diseases in humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, pit-fever virus, west nile virus, saint louis anseflitis virus, japani anseflitis virus, tik- janit anseflitis virus, kyasanur jangal rog virus tathaa omsk rakthasravi bukaar, sabhi "flaviviriday" parivaar se sambandhit hai
 
 Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks
 dengue virus, adhiktar adies machharon dwaara sancharit hota he, vishesh rup se adies aegypti prakaar ke machhar se
 These mosquitoes usually occur at altitudes less than 1000 m, at 350 north and 350 south latitudes
 yah adhiktar din ke samay katate hai
 a single bite can also infect humans
 kabhi-kabhaar machharon ko bhi maanvon se dengue mil saktaa he
 If a female mosquito bites an infected person, the mosquito can get the dengue virus
 sabase pehle virus un koshikaon main rahata he jo machhar ke pet main hoti hai
 After about 8 to 10 days, the virus gets infected by the salivary glands of the mosquito that make up the saliva
 iskaa arth he machhar dwaara banaayi gayi laar dengue ke virus se sankramit hoti he
 Therefore, when mosquitoes bite a human, their infected saliva can infect a human
 virus un sankramit machharon ke liye koi samasya paidaa nahin karte dikhte hai, jo apane puure jivan bhar sankramit rahenge
 It is most likely that the Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads dengue
 aisa isaliye ki kyonki ye maanvon ke sabase adhik nazadik rahete hai or jaanwaron kii bajaay maanvon par jite hai
 It prefers to lay eggs in vessels containing man-made water
 dengue sankramit rakt utpaadon tathaa ang daan dwaara fail saktaa he
 If a person infected with dengue donates blood or organ, which is given to another person, this person may get dengue from the blood or organ donated
 kuch deshon jaise singapore main dengue aam he
 In these countries, 1
6 to 6 out of 10,000 blood transfusions spread dengue
 garbhavastha ke dauraan yaa bachche ko janm dete samay dengue virus maan se bachche main bhi fail saktaa he
 Dengue usually does not spread in any other way
 dengue se peedit vayaskon se adhik shishuon tathaa bacchon main beemaari kii gambhirtha hone kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Children are more likely to become seriously ill if they are well nourished
 mahilaon kii apeksha purushon main gambhir beemaari kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma
 jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to isaki laar maanav kii twachaa main pravesh kar jaati he
 If the mosquito has dengue, the virus is in its saliva
 isaliye jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to virus machhar kii laar ke saath vyakti kii twachaa main pravisht ho jaataa he
 The virus attaches to the white blood cells of the person and enters them
 jab shwet rakt kanikaayen sharir main idhar-udhar jaati hai to virus purnutpaadan karata he
 White blood cells react through a variety of signaling proteins such as interleukins, interferons, and tumor necrosis factors
 in protein ke kaaran dengue ke saath bukhaar, flu jaise lakshan tathaa gambhir dard paidaa hote hai
 If a person has severe infections then the virus grows more rapidly in his body
 kyonki virus kii sankhya bahut adhik he isaliye ye kai or angon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Blood escapes from the walls of small blood capillaries into the body's coters
 is kaaran se rakt keshikaon main kam rakt kaa pravaah hota he
 a person's blood pressure falls so low that the heart is not able to supply enough blood to vital organs
 saath hi, asthi majja paryaapt platelets kaa nirmaan nahin kar paati he, jo rakt kaa thakka banane ke liye jaruri he
 Without adequate platelets, the person is quite likely to have bleeding problems
 raktasrav, dengue ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali mukhya jatilta he
 Health care professionals usually diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and seeing that his symptoms resemble dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar, is prakaar se dengue kaa nidaan karne main un kshetron main vishesh rup se sakasham ho sakate hai jahaan par yah aam taur par hota he
 However, when dengue is in its early stages, it is difficult to distinguish it from other viral infections
 kisi vyakti ko sambhawatah dengue tab ho saktaa he jab usko bukhaar ho tathaa nimna main se do lakshan holematlee or ulti; laal chakatte; saamaanya dard ; shwet rakt kanikaon ko kii kam sankhya; yaa sakaaratmak turnicket pareekshan
 Any warning sign and fever in areas where this disease is common is a sign that a person has dengue
 chetavanee chihn aam taur par dengue ke gambhir hone ke pehle dikhne lagate hai
 Tourniquet testing is sufficient when no laboratory tests can be performed
 turnicket pareekshan main swasthya seva peshewar raktchaap naapane vaale upkaran kaa patta vyakti kii bahon ke chaaron ore 5 minute tak baandhta he
 If the person sees red spots on the person's skin, then the healthcare professional counts them
 dhabbon kii sankhya jitani adhik hogi vyakti ko dengue bukhaar hone kii sambhaavna utani adhik hogi
 Differentiating between chikungunya and dengue fever can be difficult
 chikangunia ek aisa viral sankraman he jisamen dengue jaise samaan lakshan hote hai tathaa yah bhi vishwa ke unhi hisson main hota he
 Symptoms of dengue may be other diseases such as malaria, leptopirosis, typhoid fever and meningococcal disease
 aksar, kisi vyakti main dengue kaa nidaan hone ke pehle, uske swasthya seva peshewar is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki vah vyakti inamen se kisi ek paristhiti se peedit na ho, kuch pareekshan karenge
 When a person has dengue, the first change can be seen in a laboratory test of a small number of white blood cells
 kam platelets sankhya tathaa chayapachay amlaraktata bhi dengue ke lakshan hai
 If the person has severe dengue then there will be other changes that can be seen by studying blood
 gambhir dengue ke kaaran rakt dhaaraon se taral kaa risaav ho saktaa he
 This can cause hemoconcentration
 yah rakt main albumin ke str ko bhi kam karata he
 Occasionally severe dengue also produces more pleural effusion or ascites
 yadi isaki maatra paryaapt ho to swasthya seva peshewar ise rogi ke pareekshan ke samay dekh saktaa he
 a healthcare professional may already notice dengue shock syndrome if he or she can use medical ultrasound to look for fluid within the body
 lekin bahut saare aise kshetron main jahaan par dengue aam he, adhiktar swasthya seva peshewaron tathaa chikitsaalayon main ultrasound mashine nahin hoti hai
 In 2009, the World Health Organization classified or divided dengue fever into two types: simple and severe
 iske pehle 1997 main WHO ne rog ko avibhedit tathaa dengue bukhaar main baanta tha
 The WHO decided that this old method of dividing dengue fever needed to be simplified
 isane yah bhi tay kiya ki purana tarika kaaphi simit tha: isamen ve sabhi tareeke shaamil nahin the jinase dengue apane ko prastut kar saktaa tha
 Although the method of dengue classification was officially changed, the old classification is still used
 WHO kii puraani paddati main dengue rakthasravi bukhaar ko chaar charnon main vibhakt kiya gaya tha, jinako grad I–IV kaha jaataa tha: Dengue fever can be diagnosed by laboratory testing of microbiology
 kuch bhinn pareekshan bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 a test in the culture of the cells isolates the dengue virus
 ek anya pareekshan virus se neucleic amlon kii pahchaan karata he, jisamen polimress chen riection kahi jane vaali takanic kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a third test identifies the virus's antigen
 ek anya pareekshan rakt main unpratirakshiyon kii pahchaan karata he jo dengue virus se sharir ko ladane kii kshamta dete hai
 Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection tests are better than antigen detection
 halanki in pareekshanon kii laagat adhik hoti he, isaliye ye adhik sthanon par uplabdh nahin hai
 All these tests can be negative when dengue disease is in its early stages

 However, immunological tests can confirm that a person is in a later stage of dengue infection
 sharir pratirakshiyon kaa nirmaan karata he jo vishisht rup se 5 se 7 dinon baad dengue virus se ladate hai
 No vaccine has yet been approved to protect people from dengue virus
 sankraman ko rokane ke liye vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne machharon kii jansankhya ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko machharon ke kaate jane se bachaane kaa suzav diya he
 The WHO has suggested a program for prevention of dengue which consists of 5 different parts: machharon ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko isse kaate jane se bachaane ke liye WHO kuch vishisht suzav bhi detaa he
 The best way to control the "aedes aegypti" mosquito is to get rid of its habitats
 logon ko pani ke khule paatro ko khaali rakhana chaiye 
 Pesticides or biological control agents can also be used to control mosquitoes in these areas
 vaigyanikon kaa yah maananaa he ki organophosphate yaa pirethyroid insecteside kaa chhidkaav koi sahaayta nahin karata he
 Stagnant water should be eliminated because it attracts mosquitoes and also because bacteria can be born in this stagnant water causing health problems
 machharon ke kaatane se bachane ke liye log aise kapade pahan sakate hai jo puri tarah se unki twachaa ko junk kar rakhen
 They can use insecticides, which will keep mosquitoes away
 log, aaraam karte samay masahari kaa bhi upyog kar sakate hai
 There is no vaccine present in the market at this time, although the experiments in Thailand have been largely successful
 dengue se bachaav kaa sabase prabhavi tarika machharon kii aabaadi pe kaabo karnaa he is ke liye yaa to larva pe niyantran karnaa hota he yaa vayask machharon kii aabaadi par
 Aedes mosquitoes breed in artificial water storage containers such as tires, bottles, coolers, bouquets
 These vessels should be emptied frequently
 This is considered the best method of larval control
 vayask machharon ko kaabo me karne hetu kitnashak dhuna kisi seemaa tak prabhavi ho sakate he, machharon ko kaatane se roak dena bhi ek tarika he kintu is prajati ke machhar din me katate he jisase maamla gambhir ban jaataa he
 a new method is to put an aquatic insect called Mesosaclopus that is a larval eater into stagnant water such as gambusia fish as an effective remedy against malaria

 pit fever kii vaikaseen ek sambandhit flavivyras ke viruddh he use dengue ke viruddh parivartit rup main prayog karne kii salaah di jaati he kintu is sambandh me koi vistrut adhyayan nahin kiya gaya he
 In 2006, a scientific group from Argentina discovered the breeding method of the virus, which is expected to find an effective drug against it
 dengue bukhaar ke liye koi vishisht upachaar nahin he
 Depending on the symptoms, there are different treatments for different people
 kuch log gharon par maatr taral pikar behatar ho sakate hai, jiske saath unke swasthya seva peshewar najdiki rup se unke swasthya kii nigaraanee karke yah sunishchit kar sakate hai ki ve behatar ho rahe hon
 Some others may require intravenous or blood transfusion
 yadi kisi vyakti kii pehle se jatil swasthya sthiti kii samasya he to, swasthya seva peshewar us vyakti ko aspataal main bhartee karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 When a person needs intravenous fluid, usually they may need it for a day or two
 swasthya seva peshewar taral kii maatra ko badhayega jisase ki vyakti mutr kii ek tay maatra nirgat kar sake
 The amount of fluid can also be increased so that a person's hematocrit and vital signs can return to normal
 raktasrav ke jokhim ke kaaran swasthya seva peshewar, nasogastric intubeshan, antahpeshiy injection tathaa dhamniyon main panchar karnaa jaisi aakraamak chikitsa prakriyaaon se bachate hai
 Acetaminophen can be given for fever and pain
 sujan-rodhi dawa kaa ek prakaar jise NSAID kehete hai, prayog nahin kii jaani chaiye kyonki raktasrav hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna hoti he
 If the vital signs of the person do not change or become normal and if the number of red blood cells in their blood is decreasing, then blood transfusion should be started early
 jab rakt aadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho to vyakti ko sampurna rakt yaa pack kii gayi laal rakt kanikaon ko diya janaa chaiye
 Platelets and freshly frozen plasma are generally not recommended
 jab vyakti dengue ke sudhaar vaale charan main hota he to aam taur par use or antah shira dravya nahin diye jate hai jisase ki uske sharir main taral kii maatra adhik na ho
 If there is an excess of liquor but the vital signs of that person are fixed, then it is enough to stop giving more money
 yadi vyakti rog kii jatil avasthaa main na ho to, use furosemide jaise loop mutrvardhak diye ja sakate hai
 This will help in removing excess fluid from the blood circulation of that person
 dengue se peedit adhiktar log thik ho jate hai or unako baad main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti he
 1 to 5% of people infected with dengue die due to lack of treatment
 achche upachaar ke baavjood 1% se kam logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 However, 26% of people suffering from severe dengue die
 dengue 110 se adhik deshon main aam he
 Each year, 50 to 100 million people around the world are affected by it
 prayek varsh, puri duniya ke iske chalate aadhe million log aspataal main bhartee hote hai tathaa lagbhag 12,500 se 25,000 logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Dengue is the most common viral disease spread by arthropods
 yah mana jaataa he ki dengue ke upar prati million jansankhya main se lagbhag 1600 viklaangata samyojit jivan varsh kaa bhaar he
 This means that dengue ends 1600 years of life per million population
 yah utana hi he jitna ki rog bhaar anya bachapan yaa tibi jaisi ushnkaribandheey bimariyon kaa he

 Scientists are working on making vaccines to protect people from all four types of dengue
 kuch vaigyanik is baat se chintit he ki vaxin, antibody-nirbhar vruddhi ke kaaran gambhir rog ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 The best possible vaccine will have somewhat different quality
 pehla, yah surakshit hoga
 Second, it will be functional after one or two injections
 teesraa, yah sabhi prakaar dengue virus se suraksha pradaan karegaa
 Fourth, it will not produce ADE
 paanchvaan, iskaa parivahan tathaa sangrahan aasaan hoga
 Sixth, it will be low-cost and cost-effective
 2009 tak kuch vaxinon kaa pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 Scientists hope that the first vaccine will be ready for commercial manufacture by 2015
 fi Scientists are working to make anti-virus drugs to treat the attack of dengue fever and to protect people from serious complications

 == sandarbh == No one can be punished for an offense if he has not directly or indirectly done any work which is invalid by law or has not committed an error in any mandatory work prescribed by law
 saadhaarant: kisi aparaadh kii purnataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vah 'doshapurn man' yaa 'aapraadhik manahosthiti' se kiya jaay
 But only if the offender is voluntary can his work be considered a crime
 swechha se kiya hua kaam yaa kaam kii avhelnaa vah he, jise karne yaa na karne kii ichha rahi ho
 Therefore, if a person has committed a crime in an unconscious state - that is, when sleepy, due to inertia or insanity - it would be presumed that his brain was not functioning in such a situation
 falat: us kaam ke karne yaa uski avhelnaa main uski ichha nahin thi
 Similarly, if a person commits a crime on being extremely bound, then there will be a lack of voluntary work in it
 koi kaam yaa isamen chyuti ichhapurna maani jaayegi, yadi kaaryakari upyukt saavdhaanee baratane par use nahin karata yaa uski avhelnaa se virat hota
 Do not consider any involuntary work or error of work voluntary

 Sometimes the desire to do something forbidden by law is considered to be a defective mind
 simit varg ke aparaadhon main doshapurn man aavashyak nahin he
 For illustration, if a person marries another with his wife, he cannot say in his defense that he believed with a pure heart that his first marriage has been severed
 is varg main kanoon dwaara nirdisht chote chote aparaadh hi aate hai
 In order to know whether a defective mind is necessary in such crimes, it becomes necessary to look towards the objective of the specified law
 jis aparaadh main vishesh ichha yaa maansik sthiti aavashyak he, uske liye koi vyakti apradhi nahin hoga, yadi uskaa man doshapurn nahin tha evam duusare vyakti ke aadesh se usne vah aparaadh kiya tha
 But the person whose order caused the crime, will be liable
 saadhaarant: koi vyakti kisi kaam yaa uski avhelnaa ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hoga, yadi usne swayan aparaadh nahin kiya he yaa nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat nahin hua he yaa kisi duusare vyakti ko aparaadh karne ke liye adhikaar nahin diya he or na use nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat hone kii prerana di he
 No owner can be punished for the malice, fraud or neglect of his servant or agent, because the mental state of the servant or agent cannot be called the mental state of the owner
 kintu simit varg ke kuch maamalon main jahaan maansik sthiti aparaadh ke liye aavashyak nahin he, apane sevak yaa agent ke saamaanya kaary ke dauraan main kiye gaye kaamon ke liye maalik uttaradaayi hoga, bhale hi use aise kaam kii jaankaree na rahi ho or ve kaam uske aadesh ke viruddh hi kyon na kiye gaye hon
 a corporation can work only through its servant or agent
 at: inke kaam yaa kanoon dwaara nirdisht kaam main truti ke kaaran nigam hi uttaradaayi ho saktaa he
 But the corporation shall not be liable for treason, gurudra crime, and minor offenses, which may be punished personally by violence or for crimes in which imprisonment or physical torture can be punished
 apane sevak yaa agent ke aparaadh ke liye use keval arthdand diya ja saktaa he

 ISO Code: gbk bhashaa kii utpatti se aashay us kaal se he jab maanav ne bolnaa armbh kiya or 'bhashaa' siikhnaa armbh kiya
 There are many concepts in this topic which are mostly based on inference
 maanav ke itihaas main yah kaal itnaa pehle armbh hua ki iske vikaas se sambandhit koi bhi sanket milane asambhav hai
 The origin of language is related to the time in which human beings first connected the sounds coming out of their mouths with objects, objects and emotions
 itihaas ke kis kaal main maanav ne samuhik str par yah nishchay kiya ki kis shabd kaa kya arth hoga
 The question of 'origin of language' does not come within the range of ideology of linguistics

 aajkal ke bhashaa vaigyanik bhashaa kii utpatti ke prashn ko bhashavigyaan kii seemaa main nahin maanate
 Regarding the origin of language, scholars have adopted two types of thought-paths, which are called direct path and indirect path - bhashaa kaa vikaas vibhinn kaalon or paristhitiyon main hota hua aaj drut gati se ho rahaa he atah uske vartmaan rup se peeche ke itihaas ko jaanane main anek prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan aa sakati hai
 No theory can be formed by observing the impracticality of this route
 balak ke bhashaa seekhney kaa prayaas or samaaj dwaara bhashaa kaa vikaas donon puri tarah bhinn baaten hai
 For this reason, some scholars have declared the indirect path as meaningless
 bhashaa kii utpatti ke pramukh siddhantah bhashaa ke vikaas yaa itihaas or uski utpatti ko lekar nimnlikhit siddhanth prachlit hai: Regarding the origin of languages, the most ancient belief is that while God has created many things in the world, all languages are also created by God

 The conclusion bhashaa kii utpatti ke sambandh main daivi siddhanth tarksangat nahin he
 It lacks scientific approach
 isamen bhashaa kii utpatti kii samasya kaa koi samaadhaan nahin miltaa
 Yes, even in this theory, the truth is that man has the power to speak from birth
 ise nirnay-siddhanth bhi kehete hai
 French thinker Rousseau is the first exponent of this theory
 sanket siddhanth ke anusaar praarambhik avasthaa main maanav ne apane bhaavon-vichaaron ko apane ang sanketon se prashit kiya hoga baad main isamen jab kathinaayee aane lagi to sabhi manushyon ne saamaajik samjhaute ke aadhaar par vibhinn bhaavon, vichaaron or padaarthon ke liye anek dhvanyatmak sanket nishchit kar liye
 All humans gathered and did this by exchange of ideas
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa kramik gathan hua or ek saamaajik prishthbhumi main sankethik sanstha dwaara bhashaa kii utpatti hui
 Later on the basis of this sign theory, scholars like 'rachai', 'rai' and Johansen, etc
, presented the indicated theory which, despite being somewhat more sophisticated than the hint theory, reveals almost this belief
 samiksha * yah siddhanth yah maan kar chalata he ki isse purv maanav ko bhashaa kii prapti nahin hui thi
 If this is so, like other languageless beings, humans should not have experienced the need for language
 nishkarsh In this theory, an attempt has been made to prove the origin of language by artificial means, and secondly, this theory is completely based on imagination
 atah tark kii kasuti par khara nahi utarataa
 The original thinker of this theory was 'plato'

 Then he started his work by making new words from these metals
 samiksha The conclusion apane purvavarti siddhanton kii bhanti yah siddhanth bhi tark kii kasuti par vifal ho jane ke kaaran bhashaa ke armbh kaa koi nishchit samaadhaan prastut nahin kar sakaa
 Therefore, there remained a need to rethink on this subject
 is siddhanth ko maanane vaale pramukh vidwaan hai- ‘hnitni’ ‘paul’, ‘harder’ aadi
 Max Müller ridiculed this theory, calling it the Bok Bob theory
 vaise angrreji bhashaa main iske liye onomotopethy yaa icoic shabd kaa prachlan he

 Analysis vidwaanon ne is siddhanth ke khandan ke liye nimnlikhit tark diye hai: The conclusion ‘auto jesperson’ naamak vidwaan ne kaha tha ki is siddhanth par bhashaa ke kuch shabdon kaa nirmaan hona mana ja saktaa he jo bhashaa kii utpatti kaa aanshik aadhaar maane ja sakate hen, purna aadhaar nahin
 This theory is called psycho-expressionism or 'psycho-expressionism'
 is siddhanth ke anusaar aadi yug ke bhavuk maanav ne bhavaveg main harsh, shok, krodh, vismay, ghrinaa aadi ko vyanjit karne ke liye jin ‘aaha’, ‘oho’, ‘phik’ ‘chhih’ puh, ‘pish ‘faai’ aadi dhvaniyon ko utpann kiya aage chal kar unheen se bhashaa kaa vikaas hua
 Just as the words 'dhikr', 'dhikrna', 'dhik-dhikk' have been formed from 'dhik', in the same way the whole language is made
 samiksha There are many types of shortcomings in this theory, such as- nishkarsh
