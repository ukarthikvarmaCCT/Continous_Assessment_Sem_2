 This is called sound extracted from celestial lightning

 To measure its distance, the distance between its brightness and sound is counted
 yah achaanak bade daab or taapmaana ke kaaran hota he
 This sound comes out when air is suddenly spread

 This is when two different types of clouds come around, one is hot and the other is cold
 isse achaanak se urja baahar nikalne lagati he or isi ke kaaran chamak or garaj ke saath bijli bhi girti he
 It is just like pouring cold water on a hot pot
 jisase urja nikalati he or aawaaj bhi aata he
 But as the temperature changes, the energy takes the form of electricity

 This causes a sudden change in temperature
 lekin jab yah shant ho jaataa he to bijli bhi dhire dhire shant ho jaati he
 Where there is only one type of weather and there are no clouds of other temperature, then there is no electricity nor thunder or glow

 This civilization dates back to 3150 BC
 Around, under the rule of the First Faroe, the political integration of Upper and Lower Egypt coincided and continued to develop over the next three centuries
 Its history is made up of a series of stable states, divided by periods of relative instability, known as intermediate periods
 pracheen misr navin samrajya ke dauraan apane chotii par pahaunchi, jiske baad isane mand patan kii avadhi main pravesh kiya
 During this latter period Egypt was conquered by many foreign powers, and the rule of the pharaoh officially came to 31 BC
 Ended when I, the early Roman Empire, conquered Egypt and made it a province
 pracheen misr kii sabhyataa kii safalataa, nil nadi ghati kii paristhitiyon ke anukool dhalane kii kshamta se aanshik rup se prabhavit thi
 In this fertile valley, due to the expected floods and controlled irrigation, there was more crop than required, which encouraged social development and culture
 Due to a plethora of resources, the administration has engaged in mineral exploitation in the valley and surrounding desert areas, early development of an independent writing system, organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding areas and defeating foreign enemies and Sponsored an army intended to strengthen the Egyptian dominion

 Many of the achievements of the ancient Egyptians included excavation, surveying, and construction techniques that helped build the giant pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective medical system, irrigation system and agricultural production technology, the first known vessel, Egyptian pottery and glass technology, new forms of literature and known, most early peace treaty
 Egypt left a lasting legacy
 Its art and architecture were widely adopted and its antiquities were transported to other corners of the world
 iske vishaal khandhiron ne yatriyon or lekhakon kii kalpana ko sadiyon tak prerit kiya
 a renewed respect for antiquities and excavations during the early modern period prompted the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural heritage for Egypt and the world

 5500 BC Till, small tribes living in the Nile Valley evolved into a range of cultures, which shows their control over agriculture and animal husbandry and can be identified by their ceramics and personal items such as combs, bracelets and beads
 upree misr kii in aarambhik samskritiyon main sabase vishaal, badaari ko isaki ucch gunvattta vaale chini mitti kii vastuon, pathar ke upkaran or tambe ke unke upyog ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In Northern Egypt, Badari was followed by the Amarshan and Garjean cultures, which demonstrated many superior techniques
 gargian samay main, praarambhik saboot kanan or biblos tat ke saath sampark hone ko siddh karte hai
 In southern Egypt, the Nakada culture, similar to the Badari, dates back to 4000 BC
 Expansion began along the banks of the Nile River
 nakada i avadhi ke samay se hi purv-rajvansheey misr, ithiopia se obsidian kaa aayaat karata tha, jiskaa prayog chingaari se blade or anya vastuon ko aakaar dene main kiya jaataa tha
 Over a period of about 1000 years, the Nakada culture evolved from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders had complete control over the people and resources of the Nile Valley
 satta ke kendra kii sthapana pehle hiraconpolis or phir baad main abidos main karte hue, nakada III ke shaskaon ne misr ke apane niyantran ko nil nadi ke uttar kii ore vistaar kiya
 They also traded with Nubia in the south, with oases from the Western Desert in the west and cultures from the eastern Mediterranean Sea in the east
 nakada samskruti ne bhautik vastuon kaa vividhta ke saath utpaadan kiya, jo kuleen varg kii badhati takat or sampatti ko pratibimbit karata he, jisamen shaamil the chitrit mitti ke bartan, ucch gunvattta vaale pathar ke sajaavati guladaste, cosmetic pattiyaan or sone ke gahane, lapis or hathi-daant
 unhone ek ceramic glez bhi viksit kiya jise fence ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jiskaa roman kaal main cap, taabeej or murtiyon ko sajaane main kaaphi istemaal hota tha
 During the late phase of the pre-dynastic period, the Nakada culture began to use written symbols that eventually evolved into a complete system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language

 He preferred to begin his official history with a king named "meni", who supposedly united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt
 The transformation into a unified state actually occurred more sequentially than the ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes
 tathaapi, kuch vidwaanon kaa ab maananaa he ki mithkeey meness vastav main ferro narmar ho saktaa he, jise vaidhik narmar rangapattica par ekikaran kii ek pratikatmak kriya ke rup main shahi rajchihn pahane hue dikhaaya gaya he
 3150 BC Around, in the early dynastic period, the First Dynastic pharaohs strengthened their control over Lower Egypt, establishing the capital in Memphis, from where they gained labor force and agriculture to the fertile delta region, as well as the profitable and important trade routes of the Levant
 Could control praarambhik rajvansheey kaal ke dauraan ferroon kii badhati takat or sampatti kii jhalak abidos main unke vistrut mastaba kabron or murdagharon se dikhti he, jiskaa prayog mrityu ke baad ferro ke devatv prapti kaa jashn manaane ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The strong institution of governance developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize the state's control over land, labor, and the resources that were necessary for the survival and development of ancient Egyptian civilization
 pracheen samrajya ke dauraan vaastushilp, kala or praudyogiki main ascharyajanak vikaas kiye gaye, jise purna viksit kendriya prashasan dwaara sambhav, vardhit krishi utpaadakta ne gati di

 The pyramids built by Josar, Khufu and his descendants are the most memorable symbols of ancient Egyptian civilization and the power of the pharaohs who controlled it
 ek kendriya prashasan ke badhate mahatv ke saath hi, shikshit lekhakon or adhikariyon kaa ek nayaa varg paidaa hua jinhen unki sevaaon ke liye ferro dwaara sampada pradaan kii gai
 The pharaohs also provided land to their morgue cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death
 By the end of the ancient empire, five centuries of these feudal practices gradually eroded the economic power of the pharaohs, now incapable of maintaining a vast centralized administration
 jaise-jaise ferro kii shakti ksheen hoti gai, nomark kahalaane vaale kshetreey governron ne ferro ke varchasv ko chunauti dena shuru kiya
 Along with these conditions, 2200 and 2150 BC
 The severe drought that eventually took place led to a 140-year famine and a period of conflict known as the First Intermediate Period
 pracheen rajvansh ke ant main misr kii kendra sarkaar ke dhahne ke baad, prashasan, desh kii arthvyavastha ko sthir karne yaa sahaara dene main asamarth tha
 Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and future food shortages and political disputes took the form of famine and small-scale civil war
 kathin samasyaon ke baavjood, ferro ke prati bina sammaan ke sthaneey netaaon ne apni nai praapt swatantraaa kaa istemaal, praanton main sampann samskruti kii sthapana ke liye kiya
 Once gaining control of themselves over their resources, these provinces became relatively prosperous economically - a fact demonstrated by larger and better funerals among all social classes

 Freed from their loyalty to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
 2160 BC Till, the rulers of Herakleopolis held control of Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt
 jaise-jaise intef kii shakti main vruddhi hui or usne apana niyantran uttar kii ore badhaayaa, to donon pratidwandvi rajwanshon ke bich sangharsh anivaary ho gaya
 Around 2055 BC, the Theban forces, under the command of Nebhepetre Mantuhotep II, eventually defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers and reintegrated the two territories to begin an economic and cultural renaissance period, known as the Middle Kingdom

 Wazir Amenemhat I, around power, transferred the capital of the country to the city of Iztawi in Fayum
 From Ijtawi, the pharaohs of the 12th dynasty planned land reforms and irrigation with foresight to increase agricultural production in the region
 In addition, the army reclaimed areas of Nubia enriched by mines and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the East Delta to protect against foreign attack, called "walls-of-the-ruler" " where did it go

 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asian settlers in the delta region to provide sufficient manpower for their particularly active mining and construction operations
 These ambitious activities of construction and mining, however, combined with the inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, made the economy tense and prompted a second intermediate period with a slow decline during the 13th and 14th dynasties

 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic relations with their neighbors
 The military campaigns waged under the command of Thutmose i and his grandson Thutmose III spread the influence of the pharaohs to Syria and Nubia, which strengthened loyalty and gave them access to important imports such as brass and wood
 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom began a massive construction campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak
 He also constructed monuments in glorification of his achievements, both real and imaginary
 The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to justify her claim to the throne

 Additionally, as Rome relied more heavily on Egypt for grain imports, the Romans took considerable interest in Egypt's political situation
 Continuing Egyptian revolts, ambitious leaders, and powerful Syrian opponents unbalanced this situation, resulting in Rome being forced to send forces to make this country a province of its empire

 pracheen misravasiyon ne kaaryaatmak prayojanon ko puraa karne ke liye kala kaa nirmaan kiya
 For more than 3500 years, artists followed artistic forms and iconography developed during the ancient empire in which they followed radical principles, which opposed foreign influence and internal change
 in kalatmak maanakon - saral rekhaon, aakaar or sthanik gaharaai ke bina akritiyon ke sapaat chithran ke saath sanyukt, rang ke sapaat kshetra - ne ek sanrachana ke bheetar kram or santulan kii bhaavana paidaa kii

 Despite the symmetry of ancient Egyptian art, the style of a specific time and place sometimes reflects a changing cultural or political perspective
 duusare madhyavarti kaal main hiksos ke akraman ke baad, minon style ke bhittichitra awaaris main paae gaye hai
 The most obvious example of a politically inspired change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were grossly altered to fit Akhenaten's revolutionary religious views
 amarna kala ke rup main jaani jane vaali is style ko akhenaten kii maut ke baad sheeghra or puri tarah se mitaa diya gaya or isaki jagah paaramparik style ne le lee
 Belief in divine and rebirth was deeply ingrained since the founding of ancient Egyptian civilization; The rule of the pharaoh was based on the divine right of kings
 misr ke devalayas un devataaon se aachhadit hai jinke paas alokik shaktiyaan thim or jinhen madad yaa sangrakshan ke liye aahvaan kiya jaataa tha
 However, the gods were not always seen as benevolent and the Egyptians believed that those gods had to be satisfied by offerings and worship
 padanukram main nae devataaon ko padonnat kiye jane ke kaaran, is devalayas kaa dhaancha lagaataar badalata rahaa, lekin pujaariyon ne vividh or kabhi-kabhi paraspar virdohi utpatti mithkon or kahaniyon ko ek susangat pranali main sangathit karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 These various conceptions of divinity were not considered antithetical, but rather layers of different aspects of reality
 devataaon kii puja panth mandiron main kii jaati thi, jise raja ke nimitt kaary kar rahe pujaariyon dwaara prashasit kiya jaataa tha
 There was a cult statue at a shrine in the center of the temple

 aam naagarik, apane gharon main nijee murtiyon kii puja kar sakate the or arajak shaktiyon ke khilaaf, taabeej suraksha pradaan karte the
 After the New Kingdom, the role of the pharaoh as a spiritual intermediary diminished, as the inclination of religious rites shifted to direct worship of the gods

 The ultimate goal of a deceased was to reunite with his ka and ba to become a "blessed deceased", who then won as an akh or "an effective"
 aisa ghatit hone ke liye, mritak ko ek mukademe main yogya ghoshit hona chahie, jisamen hriday ko "satya ke pankh" ke khilaaf tola jaataa tha
 If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form
 pracheen misravasiyon ne dafan kii ek vistrut pratha ko banaae rakhaa tha, jo unke vishwaas ke anusaar maut ke baad amartv ko sunishchit karne ke liye aavashyak thi
 These practices included the preservation of the body by mummification, the execution of burial rites, and the entry of the body as well as the objects used by the deceased after death
 Prior to the ancient empire, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally protected by desiccation
 banjar, registani paristhitiyaan, garibon kii antyeshti ke liye pracheen misr ke puure itihaas main ek vardaan bani rahi, jo kuleen varg ko uplabdh vyapak dafan aayojanon ko vahan nahin kar sakate the
 Wealthy Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and, as a result, they used artificial mummification to remove internal organs, wrap the body in flax and place it in a rectangular sarcophagus stone or wooden coffin
 Used to be buried
 kuch angon ko alag se canopic jaar main sangrakshit karnaa chauthe rajvansh main shuru hua
 Until the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; The best technique took 70 days to remove internal organs, remove the brain through the nose, and dry the body in a mixture of salt, called natron
 iske baad sharir ko san ke kapade main lapeta jaataa tha jisaki paraton ke bich suraksha tabeez ko daalaa jaataa tha or phir use ek susajjit maanav rup ke taabut main rakhaa jaataa tha
 Mummies of the late period were also placed in the shell of painted cartonage mummies

 The pharaoh was generally depicted riding in front of the military in art and literature, and there is evidence to prove that at least some pharaohs, such as Sequenener Tao II and his sons, did so
 sainikon ko aam janata se bhartee kiya jaataa tha, par naveen samrajya ke dauraan or khaskar baad main, nubia, kush or libya se bhaade ke ladaakuon ko misr ke liye ladane ke liye liya gaya
 In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt attained a relatively high level of productivity and sophistication

 misravasiyon ne apni khud kii varnmaala or dashamalav pranali viksit kii
 Even before the ancient empire, the ancient Egyptians developed a glass-like substance called fences, which they believed to be a type of artificial semi-precious stone
 fence, silica, chuunaa or soda kii alp maatra or ek ranjak, aamtaur par tamba se bana ek gaiyr mitti kaa ceramic he
 This material was used to make beads, tiles, sculptures and small materials

 By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment called Egyptian Blue, also known as Blue Frit, which was produced by mixing alkalis such as silica, copper, lime, and natron
 utpaada ko pisa ja saktaa he or ek varnak ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The ancient Egyptians could with great skill shield various objects from glass, but it is not clear that they developed this process independently
 yah bhi spasht nahin he ki unhone apane khud ke kachche shishe ko nirmit kiya yaa keval purv-nirmit silliyon kaa aayaat kiya, jise unhone baad main pighalaaya or swaroop diya
 tathaapi, vasteen banane main unhen nishchit rup se takneekee visheshgyata hasil thi, saath hi saath, taiyaar glass ke rang ko niyantrit karne ke liye sanket tatwon ko jodne main bhi kushal the
 Diverse colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque

 Physicians were trained in the eye on the "eye" or "house of life", notably those headquartered in par-bastet in the New Kingdom, and in Abidos and Sice in the Late Period
 chikitsa paapiri se sharir rachana vigyaan, choton or vyaavhaarik upachaar kaa anubhavjanya gyaan pradarshit hota he
 Wounds were treated with bandages, using raw meat, white flax, sutures, gauze, pads and honey-coated lint to prevent infection, while opium was given to ease the pain
 achche swasthya ko badhaava dene ke liye lahasun or pyaaj kaa niyamit rup se istemaal kiya jaataa tha or iske prayog ko asthma se chhutkaaraa kaa ek upaay mana jaataa tha
 Ancient Egyptian surgeons sewed wounds, fractured bones, and cut the diseased limb, but admitted that some injuries were so severe that they could only comfort the patient until he died
 aarambhik misravasiyon ko kareeb 3000 isa purv ke aas-paas yah jaankaree thi ki kaise lakdi ke pataron ko ek jahaaj peta banane ke liye ikatthe joda jaataa he
 The American Archaeological Institute reported that the oldest ships ever discovered, a group of 14 ships discovered in Abidos, were built by stitching together wooden rails
 neuyork vishvavidhyalay ke egyptologist david o'conor dwaara kii gai is khoj main paaya gaya ki gunthe gaye feeton ko pataron ko ek saath jode rakhane ke liye istemaal kiya gaya, or pataron ke bich bharaa paaya gaya narkat yaa ghaas jodon ko sil karne main madad karata tha
 Since all the ships are buried together and near the morgue of the Khasekhemi pharaoh, it is believed that they all originally belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dated to 3000 BC
 Is of, and the associated clay jars buried with the ship also suggest an earlier date
 3000 isa purv kii avadhi vaala jahaaj 75 feet lambaa he or ab yah mana jaataa he ki yah shaayad kisi pehle ke firo se sambandhit he
 According to Professor o'connor, this 5000 year old ship may have belonged to the Aha pharaoh
 aarambhik misravasi yah bhi jaanate the ki kaise lakdi ke gujjhon ke upyog se pataron ko ek saath baandha ja saktaa he or alakatre ke prayog se sandhiyon ko sandaband kiya ja saktaa he
 "khufu Ship", a 43
6-meter vessel called 2500 BC
 Around the Fourth Dynasty in the Giza Pyramid complex was buried in a pit under the Great Pyramid of Giza, a full-size living example that may have completed the symbolic work of the Solar Bark
 Early Egyptians also knew how to tie the sails of this ship together with mortise and groove joints
 Despite the ancient Egyptian ability to build huge boats to sail on the easily navigable Nile River, they are not known as good sailors and did not engage in extensive sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or the Red Sea 
 ganitiya gananaa kaa sabase aarambhik anupramanit udhaaharan, purv-rajvansheey nakada avadhi main miltaa he or ek puri tarah se viksit ank pranali ko darshata he
 The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is reflected by a fictional letter from the New Kingdom in which the author proposes a contest between himself and another writer concerning daily computation tasks, such as labor, grain, and land
 rind mathematical pepirus or moscow mathematical pepirus yah darshaate hai ki pracheen misravasi, chaar buniyadi ganitiya sankriyaaon ko kar sakate the - jod, ghataav, guna or vibhaajan - apurnank kaa upyog, bakse or pyramid ke pariman kii gananaa or aayaton, trikon, vrutt or yahan tak ki chakra ke tal-kshetrafal kii gananaa bhi kar sakate the
 He understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations
 ganitiya sanketan dashamalav tha or das lakh tak das ke prayek ghaat ke pratikatmak sanket par aadhaarit tha
 Each of these could be written as many times as needed to add up to the desired number; That is, to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the sign of ten or hundred was written eight times respectively
 chunki unki gananaa ke tareeke se ek se adhik ganak ke adhikansh apurnank ko sambhala nahin ja saktaa tha, pracheen misr ke apurnank ko kai apurnank ke jod ke rup main likhaa jaataa tha
 For example, the decimal number two over five was solved by adding one over three + one over fifteen; This was made easier by the standard list of values
 kuch aam apurnank, tathaapi, ek vishesh gliff ke saath likhe jate the; aaj ke aadhunik do tihaai ko dahini taraf dikhaaya jaataa tha
 Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had an understanding of the fundamentals of the Pythagoras theorem, for example, a triangle has a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides are in a 3–4–5 ratio
 ve ek vrutt ke kshetra fal kaa anumaan, uske vyas se nauven hisse ko ghataakar or parinaam ko duguna kar ke laga lete the

 Ancient Egyptian culture and monuments have left a lasting legacy on the world
 udhaaharan ke liye, devi isis kaa panth roman samrajya main lokapriy hua, jabaki obelisk or anya avasheshon ko, rome main waapas le jaaya gaya
 The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect structures in the Egyptian style
 Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Deodorus Sickleus studied this country, which came to be seen as a place of mystery
 During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period, Egyptian pagan culture began to decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam, but in the writings of medieval scholars, such as dhul-nun al-misri and al-makrizi of Egyptian antiquity
 The interest remained

 In the 19th century, the Egyptian government and archaeologists recognized the importance of cultural respect and unity in excavations
 The Supreme Council of Antiquities, now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than finding treasure

 Saint Dnyaneshwar Maharashtra was a great saint of the thirteenth century who composed Dnyaneshwari
 sant gyaneshwar kii gananaa bharat ke mahaan santon evam marathi kaviyon main hoti he
 These saints were contemporaries of Namdev and with him he traveled all over Maharashtra to introduce people to knowledge and devotion and preached Samata, Samabhav
 ve maharashtra-samskruti ke 'aadya-pravartakon' main bhi maane jate hai
 Sant Dnyaneshwar was born in 1275 AD on the Ashtami of the Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada in Apegaon near the Paithan in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra
 inke pita kaa naam vitthal pant evam mata kaa naam rukmini bai tha
 His father was a high-ranking Mumukshu and an exclusive worshiper of Lord Vitthalnath
 vivaah ke uparaant unhone sanyas diksha grahan kii thi, kintu unhen apane gurudev kii ajna se phir grihasthashram main pravesh karnaa padaa
 In this stage he had three sons named Nivrithinath, Gyanadev and Sopan and a girl named Muktabai
 sanyas-diksha-grahan ke uparaant in santanon kaa janm hone ke kaaran inhen 'sanyasi kii santan' yah apmanjanak sambodhan nirantar sahanaa padataa tha
 Vitthal Pant even had to commit suicide as per the command given by the society of that time
 pita kii chhatrachhaaya se vanchit se anaath bhai-bahan janaapvaad ke kathor aghat sehate hue 'shuddhipatr' kii prapti ke liye us samay ke suprasiddh dharmakshetra paithan main ja pahunche
 Kimvadanti is famous: Jnanadev got Vedicharan here with buffalo's face in front of the Brahmins who ridiculed him

 1400 varsh ke tapasvi changdev ke swaagat ke liye janaa tha, us samay ye diwaar baithe the, usee diwaar ko ukt sant ke paas chalaa kar le gayi

 "impressed by this supernatural miracle, the leading scholars of Paithan gave those four siblings 'shuddhipatra' in Saka Samvat 1209
 ukt shuddhipatr ko lekar ye chaaron pravara nadi ke kinare based nevaase gram main pahunche
 The eldest brother of Jnanadev had preached from Gahinath of Nath sect of Nivrithinath
 inhone us aadhyatmik dharohar ko gyandev ke dwaara apni choti bahan muktabai tak yathavat pahunchaa diya
 In this way, in the Paramartha Marg, Gyanadev, gratitude and socially wise, wrote a commentary on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita in Marathi with the aim of providing a simple introduction of spirituality to the elites
 isi kaa naam he bhavarthadipika athwa gyaneshwari
 The completion of this scripture took place in the temple of Mahalaya Devi of Saka Samvat 1212 village of Nevasse
 kuch vidwaanon kaa abhimath he- inhone abhang-vrutt kii ek marathi tikaa yogavasishth par bhi likhi thi, par durbhaagya se vah aprapya he
 Almost all the scriptures in those days were in Sanskrit and the general public did not know very much Sanskrit, Asu Tejaswi Balak Dnyaneshwar composed the gita-bhashya named 'dnyaneshwari' in Marathi on Gita only at the age of 15 years
 He preached in his own language as if he opened the bag of knowledge
 swayan tikaakar ne likhaa he- "ab yadi main gita kaa thik-thik vivechan marathi bhashaa main karun to is main aashcharya kaa kya kaaran he 


guru-krupa se kya kuch sambhav nahin ?" After the completion of this book, Dnyaneshwar produced another book called 'amritanubhav', which was an independent investigator of his political principles
 is granth ke purna hone ke baad ye chaaron bhai-bahan pune ke nikatavarti gram alandi aa pahunche
 From here, the letter he wrote in 65 ovis to Yogiraj Changdev is famous in Maharashtra as 'changdev Pasthi'
 gyandev jab tirthayatra ke uddeshy se alandi se chale us samay inke saath inke bhai, bahan, daadi, tathaa visova khechar, gora kumhaar aadi anek samakaleen sant bhi the
 In particular, the relationship between Namdev and Jnanadev was so affectionate that it seemed as if both the knowledge and the deeds had become identical in the disguise of the ascetics in the guise of this pilgrimage
 tirthayatra se lautate hue gyandev pangarpur maarg se alandi aa pahunche
 Scholars speculate that Jnanadeva may have composed his 'abhangas' during this period
 balak se lekar vridhon tak ko bhaktimaarg kaa parichay kara kar bhagwat-dharm kii pun:sthapana karne baad gyandev ne alandi gram main atyant yuva hote hue bhi jivit samadhi lene kaa nishchay kiya
 At the age of just 21 years, three months and five days, he renounced this mortal world and became a tomb
 gyandev ke samadhigrahan kaa vrittant sant namdev ne atyant hridayasparshi shabdon main likhaa he
 After finishing his last prayer to his Guru Nivrithinath, he sat in the Samadhimandir like a wisdom located at Gyanadev
 taduparant swayan guru ne samadhimandir kii dvarshila band kar di
 Dnyaneshwar, also known as Dhyaneshwar, took this living Samadhi in village Alindi Samvat to Margashirsha Vadi Triodashi of Sh 1217, which has now become a famous shrine, about 14 km from Pune
 gyaneshwar ji kii likhi 'gyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev pasthi' tathaa 'abhang' jaisi kai kritiyaan sarvamaanya hai
 a few years ago this theory was presented that the author of Dnyaneshwari and the author of Abhang, are two different persons of the same name
 kintu ab anek pusht aadhaaron se is siddhant kaa khandan hokar yah baat sarvamaanya ho chuki he ki ye rachanaaen hi vyakti sant gyaneshwar / dhyaneshwar kii hi hai
 Dnyaneshwar in his unbroken teachings of ethics to the common people with authority, not measuring the depths of the element of discussion
 fal yah hua ki baalkon se vridhon tak ke man par yah abhangavani purna rup se pratibimbit hui
 Gurukrupa, Namasramana and Satsang These are the three steps of Paramarthpath, which have been originally described by Saint Dnyaneshwar in his teachings
 gyandev jais shreshth sant the vaise hi ve shreshth kavi bhi the
 His spiritual practice is enlivened by poetry, his poetry has received the master-seriousness of philosophy
 yah satya he ki gyaneshwar kii abhangavani 'aap-beeti' jaisi hone ke kaaran usamen jagah jagah ras-strot drushtavy rahe hai, tathaapi unke gyaan kii purnataa gyaneshwari main hi hui he
 Both parts of poetry, rasa and ornamentation have a beautiful coordination in Dnyaneshwari
 tatvavichaar tathaa kavyasaundarya ke samaan hi maharashtra ke parmaarthik jivan main bhi gyaneshwar ne jo kaary kiye ve sabhi krantikari the
 In those days the ritual was dominated, the tradition of the pandits leading the society had become ineffective
 aisi avasthaa main aadhyatm-gyaan kii mahatta sthapit karte hue sarsaadhaaran maanav ke akalan yogya bhaktimaarg kaa pratipaadan gyandev ne kiya
 'dnyaneshwari' was composed keeping spiritual philosophy limited to the texts of the pundits and is easily accessible to the Shudradikas as well
 'neech' samajhe jane vaale kul main janm lene ke kaaran manushya ko saamaajik drushti se kitna hi 'nimna' kyon na mana jaataa ho, parantu ishwar ke yahan sabhi ko samaan aashray miltaa he, is siddhant ko pratipaadit karne kaa shrey gyaneshwar ko he
 His book Dnyaneshwari in Maharashtra is also called 'mauli' or Mother
 duusare upadesh evam aashwaasan ke kaaran us samay maharashtra kii sabhi jatiyon main bhagavadbhakton kii ek peedi hi nirmit ho gai or marathi bhavuk nar-nari apni apni bhashaa main pangarpur ke bhagwaan pandurang yaa vitthal kii mahima gane lage
 God is not only a harsh judge, but also a spontaneous father
 unki drushti main ek mata kii si karunaa he- yah baat sampurna maharashtra main gyaneshwar ne apni saadi-madhur-bhashaa main batalaai
 For this reason, once again the Bhagavata religion was established and 'dnyaneshwari' as the main scripture of this sect also gained prestige among the common people
 isi ke dwaara sphurti praapt kar anek bhagwat kaviyon ne marathi bhashaa main granth-rachana kii or bhakthi-maarg main ek samrudh kavy-parampara kaa nirmaan kiya isiliye gyandev maharashtra-samskruti ke aadya-pravartak maane jane lage

 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he parantu mukhyat vedavyas ji ko kai upanishdon kaa lekhak mana jaataa he
 s Upanishad's spokesperson was Acharya Pippalad who probably won by eating Peepal's dock
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas
 ye sarvaadhik pracheen hai
 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts
 inkaa rachanakaal samhitaon ke baad kaa he
 There is no definite opinion about the period of the Upanishads, the period of the general Upanishads is believed to have been composed from 3000 BC to 500 BC upanishdon ke kaal-nirnay ke liye nimna mukhya tathyon ko aadhaar mana gaya he— The composition of the various Upanishads has been considered by the following scholars in the following order: sukesha, satyakam, sauryayani gargy, kausalya, bhargav or kabandhi, in chah brahmajigyaasuon ne inase brahmanirupan kii abhyarthna karne ke uparaant use hridyangam karne kii paatrata ke liye acharya ke aadesh par varsh paryant brahmacharyapurvak tapasya karke pruthak-pruthak ek ek prashn kiya
 The names of these six questions, along with Piplad's detailed answers, are said to be complementary to the Upanishads
 iske pratham teen prashn aparaa vidya vishyak tathaa shesh para vidya sambandhi hai
 Acharya has represented the nature of life in the second question by showing Prajapati's chariot and life to Prajapati in the second question and has explained that he is the publisher of gross body and superior to all senses
 tisare prashn main praan kii utpatti tathaa sthiti kaa nirupan karke pippalad ne kaha he ki marankaal main manushya kaa jaisaa sankalp hota he uske anusaar praan hi use vibhinn lokon main le jaataa he
 In the fourth question, Pippalad has instructed that the soul remains awake when the brain of the senses is awakened in self-state, and in the state of sleep, the mind becomes a rhythm in the soul
 vahi drashtaa, shrota, manta, vigyaata ityadi he jo akshar brahm kaa sopaadhik swaroop he
 On knowing this, man himself becomes omniscient, omniscient, the ultimate alphabet
 paanchave prashn main onkaar main brahm kii ekanishtha upasna ke rahasy main batalaaya gaya he ki uski prayek maatra kii upasna sadgati pradaayini he evam sapurn kaa ekanishtha upaask cachul nirmukt sarp kii tarah paapon se niyukt hokar ant main paratpar purush kaa saakshaatkaar karata he
 In the last sixth question, Acharya Pippalad has shown that in the heart of this body Pundarikshan is the abode of a sixteen man
 brahm kii ichha, evam usee se praan, usase shraddha, akaash, vaay, tej, jal, pruthivi, indriyaan, man or ann, ann se veery, tap, mantra, karm, lok or naam utpann hue hai ja uski solah kalaayen or sopaadhik swaroop hai
 True Brahma is smooth, unique and pure
 nadiyaan samudr main milakar jaise apane naam rup kaa usee main lay kar detii hai purush bhi brahm ke sachche swaroop ko pahachaanakar namarupatmak in kalaon se mukt hokar nishkal tathaa amar ho jaataa he
 In the interpretation of this representation, Shankaracharya in his commentary has disproved the destruction of nihilism, nihilism, Nyaya Samkhya and the place of lokayatakas

 Aryabhata was a great astrologer and mathematician of ancient India
 inhone aryabhatiy granth kii rachana kii jisamen jyotishshastra ke anek siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 In the same book, he has written his birthplace Kusumpur and the birth term Saka Samvat 398
 bihar main vartmaan patna kaa pracheen naam kusumpur tha lekin aryabhat kaa kusumpur dakshin main tha, yah ab lagbhag siddh ho chukaa he
 According to another belief, he was born in the Ashmak country of Maharashtra
 unke vaigyanik kaaryon kaa samaadar rajdhani main hi ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, after a long journey, he completed his compositions in Rajsanidhi, located in Kusumpur near modern Patna
 yadhyapi aryabhat ke janm ke varsh kaa aryabhatiy main spasht ullekh he, unke janm ke vaastavik sthaan ke bare main vivaad he
 Some believe that they were born in the region between Narmada and Godavari, known as Ashmaka and they identify Ashmaka from central India, which includes Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, although the early Buddhist text called Ashmaka to the south , As Dakshinapath or Deccan, while other texts describe that the people of Ashmaka must have fought Alexander, according to Ashmaka should be further to the north
 ek taaja adhyayan ke anusaar aryabhat, kerala ke chamravattam ke nivasee the
 According to the study, Asmaka was a Jain region which was spread around Shravanabelagol and got its name Asmaka due to its stone pillars
 chamravattam is jain basti kaa hissaa tha, iskaa pramaan he bhartapuzha nadi jiskaa naam jainon ke puranic raja bharata ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Aryabhata also mentions King Bharata while defining the Yugas - the fifth verse of the Dasgeetika describes the time passed by the time of King Bharata
 un dinon main kusumpura main ek prasiddh vishvavidhyalay tha jahaan jainon kaa nirnaayak prabhaav tha or aryabhat kaa kaam is prakaar kusumpura pahunch sakaa or use pasand bhi kiya gaya
 However, it is fairly certain that at some point he went to Kusumpura for higher education and also lived there for some time
 bhaskar i ne kusumpura kii pahchaan patliputra ke rup main kii he
 He used to live there during the last days of the Gupta Empire
 yah vah samay tha jise bharat ke svarnim yug ke rup main janaa jaataa he, vishnugupt ke purv buddhagupta or kuch chote raajaaon ke samrajya ke dauraan uttar purv main hunon kaa akraman shuru ho chukaa tha
 Aryabhata used Sri Lanka as a reference for its astronomical systems and has mentioned Sri Lanka on several occasions in the Aryabhatiya
 aryabhat dwaara rachit teen granthon kii jaankaree aaj bhi uplabdh he
 Dasghatika, Aryabhatiya and Tantra
 lekin jaankaron ke anusaar unhone or ek granth likhaa tha- 'aryabhat siddhant'
 Only 34 verses are available at this time
 unke is granth kaa saatve shatak main vyapak upyog hota tha
 But no definite information is available about how such a useful text disappeared
 unhone aryabhatiy naamak mahatvapurn jyotish granth likhaa, jisamen vargamul, ghanmul, samaantar shrenee tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke samikarnon kaa varnan he
 In his treatise called Aryabhatiya, he also represented the mathematician theory in 33 verses which can contain a total of 3 pages, and the astronomical theory in 75 verses in 5 pages and also the instruments for this
 aryabhat ne apane is chote se granth main apane se purvavarti tathaa pashchaadvarti desh ke tathaa videsh ke siddhanton ke liye bhi krantikari avadharanaayen upasthit kin
 His major work, Aryabhatiya, is a collection of mathematics and astronomy, which has been extensively cited in the Indian mathematical literature and is still in existence in modern times

 Aryabhata has had a great influence on the astrological theory of India and the world
 bharat main sabase adhik prabhaav kerala pradesh kii jyotish parampara par rahaa
 Aryabhata holds the most important position among Indian mathematicians
 inhone 120 aryaalandon main jyotish shaastra ke siddhant or usase sambandhit ganit ko sutararup main apane aryabhatiy granth main likhaa he
 He on the one hand represented the value of pi more accurate and sure than the preceding Archimedes in mathematics, while on the other hand it was declared for the first time in astronomy with the example that the Earth itself rotates on its axis
 aryabhat ne jyotishshastra ke aajkal ke unnat sadhano ke bina jo khoj kii thi,yah unki mahatta he
 Aryabhata had discovered the discovery of Copernicus a thousand years ago
 "golpad" main aryabhat ne likhaa he "naav main baitha hua manushya jab pravaah ke saath aage badhata he, tab vah samajhataa he ki achar vriksh, pashaan, parvat aadi padaarth ulti gati se ja rahe hai
 In the same way, stable constellations also appear to be moving in reverse from the moving earth

 According to Aryabhata the relation of circumference and diameter of a circle comes to 62,832: 20,000 which is pure to four decimal places
 aryabhat ne badi-badi sankhyaon ko aksharon ke samooh se nirupit karne kityant vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya he
 The place-value numeral system, first seen in the Bakshali manuscript of the third century, was clearly present in his works
 unhone nishchit rup se pratik kaa upyog nahin kiya, parantu francisi ganitagya george iffrah ke matanusaar- rikt gunank ke saath, das kii ghaat ke liye ek sthaan dharak ke rup main shunya kaa gyaan aryabhat ke sthaan-mulya ank pranali main nihit tha
 However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Continuing the Sanskrit tradition dating back to the Vedic period, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities as mnemonic
 aryabhat ne pai ke sanniktan par kaary kiya or sambhawatah unhen is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya tha ki pai irreshnal he
 In the second part of Aryabhatiyam, he writes: iske anusaar vyas or paridhi kaa anupaat × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416 he, jo paanch mahatvapurn aankadon tak bilkul sateek he
 Aryabhata, interpreting the word imminent, coming immediately before the preceding word, states that it is not only an approximation, but that the value is incomparable
 yadi yah sahi he, to yah ek atyant parishkrut drushtikon he, kyonki europe main paai kii tarkheenata kaa siddhant lambert dwaara keval 1761 main hi siddh ho paaya tha
 This approximation was mentioned in Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi's book on algebra after Aryabhatiya's translation into Arabic
 ganitpad 6 main, aryabhat ne trikon ke kshetrafal ko is prakaar bataaya he- This translates to: The area of a triangle is equal to the result of half of the side with a perpendicular
 aryabhat ne apane kaam main dwijya ke vishay main charchaa kii he or usko naam diya he ardh-jya iskaa shabdic arth he "ardh-tantri"
 People started calling it sine because of the ease
 jab arabi lekhakon dwaara unke kaam kaa sanskrit se arabi main anuwaad kiya gaya, to unhone isko jiba kaha 
 Since, in Arabic writing, vowels are used less frequently, hence its more abbreviated name
 jab baad ke lekhakon ko ye samaj main aayaa ki jb jiba kaa hi sankshipt rup he, to unhone vaapis jiba kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Jiba means "koh" or "trench"
 baad main barahavin sadi main, jab krimona ke gheraardo ne in lekhanon kaa arabi se latin bhashaa main anuwaad kiya, tab unhone arabi jiba kii jagah uske latin samakaksh sinus ko daal diya, jiskaa shabdic arth "khoh" yaa khai" hi he
 And after that in English, the sinus itself became the sign

 Here gives an example from Bhaskara's interpretation on Aryabhatiya: arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity
 is tarah ke samikarnon kii vyapak rup se charchaa pracheen vaidic granth sulb sutara main he, jiske adhik pracheen bhaag 800 i

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm
 diophentine samikarnon kaa istemaal kryptolujee main hota he or aresae sammelan, 2006 ne apana dhyaan kuttak vidhi or sulvasutra ke purv ke kaaryon par kendrit kiya
 In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata has provided interesting results for the classes and ranges of cubes
 or Aryabhata's astronomy system was called the Auric system, his later writings on astronomy, which propose a second model, superficially, have been lost, but they can be partially reconstructed from the discussions in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka
 is
 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Aryabhata seemed to believe that the earth revolves around its axis
 yah srilanka ko sandarbhit ek kathan se gyaat hota he, jo taron kii gati kaa prithvi ke ghurnan se utpann aapekshik gati ke rup main varnan karata he
 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 He said that the moon and planets shine with the reflected light of the sun
 maujuuda brahmandavigyaan se alag, jisame grahanon kaa kaarak chhadam grah nispand bindu raahu or ketu the, unhone grahanon ko prithvi dwaara daali jane vaali or is par girane vaali chaaya se sambaddh bataaya
 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this Earth's shadow and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 This approximation was a significant improvement over the computation of the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, 200 AD), whose calculations are not known in modern units, but his estimate had an error of about 5–10%

 Similarly, according to them, the duration of the year of the Earth is 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds, according to the calculation of modern time there is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds

 Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and that some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun
 is prakaar aisa suzav diya jaataa he ki aryabhat kii sangannaayen anternihit surya kendrit model par aadhaarit thim, jisame grah surya kaa chakkar lagaate hai

 haalaanki kuch log yah sweekaar karte hai ki aryabhat kii pranali purv ke ek surya kendrit model se upji thi jiskaa gyaan unako nahin tha
 It has also been claimed that they considered the planets to be elliptical, although no primary evidence has been presented for this

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation he influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha,or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai

 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential

 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate

 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today

 satyavati ke chitrangad or vichitraveery naamak do putr huye
 Shantanu died in the childhood of Chitrangad and Vichitravirya, so Bhishma was nurtured
 bhishma ne chitrangad ke bade hone par unhen rajgaddi par bitha diya lekin kuch hi kaal main gandharvon se yuddh karte huye chitrangad maaraa gaya
 At this Bhishma handed over the kingdom to his Anuj Vichitravirya
 ab bhishma ko vichitraveery ke vivaah kii chintaa hui
 At the same time, the three girls of Kashiraj, Amba, Ambika and Ambalaika were about to be swayamvara
 unke swayamvar main jaakar akele hi bhishma ne vahaan aaye samast raajaaon ko parrast kar diya or teenon kanyaon kaa haran kar ke hastinapur le aaye
 The elder daughter Amba told Bhishma that she had given her body and heart to King Shalva
 uski baat sun kar bhishma ne use raja shalve ke paas bhijwa diya or ambika or ambalika kaa vivaah vichitraveery ke saath karvaa diya
 King Shalva did not accept Amba, so she returned to Hastinapur and said to Bhishma, "O Arya! You have made me do everything, so you marry me
 ” kintu bhishma ne apni pratigya ke kaaran uske anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Amba was angry and went to Parashurama and told him about his agony and asked for help
 parashuram ne amba se kaha, “he devi! aap chintaa na karen, main aapkaa vivaah bhishma ke saath karwaaungaa
 "parashurama sent a call to Bhishma but Bhishma did not go to him
 is par krodhit hokar parashuram bhishma ke paas pahunche or donon veeron main bhayanak yuddh chhid gaya
 Both were unprecedented warriors, so the victory and victory could not be decided
 aakhir devataaon ne hastkshep kar ke is yuddh ko band karvaa diya
 Disappointed, Amba went to do penance in the forest
 vichitraveery apni donon raniyon ke saath bhoga vilaas main rat ho gayi kintu donon hi raniyon se unki koi santaan nahin hui or ve kshay rog se peedit ho kar mrityu ko praapt ho gayi
 Now mother Satyavati one day said to Bhishma, fearing total destruction, “son! To save this dynasty from perishing, i command you to produce sons from these two queens
 ” mata kii baat sun kar bhishma ne kaha, “mata! main apni pratigya kisi bhi sthiti main bhang nahin kar saktaa
 " yah sun kar mata satyavati ko atyant dukh hua
 Suddenly he remembered his son Ved Vyas
 samaran karte hi vedavyas vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 Satyavati looked at them and said, "O son! All your brothers passed away childless
 atah mere vansh ko naash hone se bachaane ke liye main tumhen ajna detii hoon ki tum unki patniyon se santaan utpann karo
 Ved Vyas obeyed and said, "mother! You should tell both those queens that they will follow the fast for one year only then they will conceive
 ” ek varsh vyateet ho jane par vedavyas sabase pehle badi rani ambika ke paas gayi
 Ambika closed her eyes due to fear of his glory
 vedavyas laut kar mata se bole, “mata ambika kaa bada tejasvi putr hoga kintu netra band karne ke dosha ke kaaran vah andhaa hoga
 Satyavati was very sad to hear this and sent Ved Vyas to the younger queen Ambalika
 ambalika vedavyas ko dekh kar bhay se pili pad gai
 On returning from her room, Ved Vyas said to Satyavati, “mother! Ambalika will have a son suffering from Pandu disease from her womb
 ” isse mata satyavati ko or bhi dukh hua or unhone badi rani ambalika ko punah vedavyas ke paas jane kaa aadesh diya
 This time the elder queen did not go herself and sent her handmaid to Ved Vyas
 daasi ne anandpurvak vedavyas se bhoga karaayaa
 This time Ved Vyas came to Mother Satyavati and said, “mother! From this maid's womb, a very strategic son born in veda-vedanta will be born
 ” itnaa kah kar vedavyas tapasya karne chale gayi
 When the time came, Dhritarashtra was born from Ambika's womb, Pandu who was suffering from Pandu disease from Ambalika's womb, and Dharmatma Vidur from Maid's womb were born

 ankiy electronic yaa digital electronics electronics kii ek shakha he jisamen vidyut sanket ankiy hote hai
 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed

 In some systems, if a piece of digital data is lost or misappropriated, the vast amounts of related data can change its meaning completely
 kyonki clif effect ke kaaran, upyogkartaaon ke liye bataanaa mushkil he ki koi vishisht system vifaltaa ke kagaar par sahi tha yaa phir vah asafal hone se pehle bahut adhik shor ko sahan kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 Digital vulnerability can be reduced for robustness by designing a digital system
 udhaaharan ke liye ek parity bit yaa anya truti prabandhan paddati ko signal path main daalaa ja saktaa he
 This method helps the system detect errors and either correct the errors or at least ask for a new copy of the data
 ek state mashin main state transishan logic kaa aprayukt state ko pakadaney or ek riset anukram trigar yaa anya niyamit truti vasuuli ke liye dizin kiya ja saktaa he
 Embedded software design uses immunity aware programming, such as attempting to fill unused program memory with blocking instructions that point to an error recovery program
 is vifaltaa ke khilaaf raksha main madad karata he jo micro controlar anudesh suchak ko bigaad sakate hai, jo anyathaa yadrichhik code ke nishpadit kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Technologies such as digital memory and transmission system error detection and correction can use additional data to correct any errors in transmission and storage
 duusari ore digital pranali main kuch takneekon kaa istemaal un pranaaliyon ke ekal bit trutiyon ko adhik kamjor banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques are acceptable only when the underlying bits are significantly more reliable than those errors are unlikely to occur
 digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai
 Its design should ensure that the characteristics of analog components do not dominate the intended digital behavior
 Digital systems must manage noise and time margins, parasitic routing and capacitance, and filter power connections
 kharaab dizin main aantrayik samasya hoti he jaise gliches, gaayab hoti tej pulces jo ki dusron ko nahin lekin kuch logic ko gati pradaan kar sakate hai, "rant pulse" maanya seemaa voltage tak nahin pahunch pate hai yaa anpekshit logic stats kaa sangyojan hote hai
 Since digital circuits are composed of analog components, the digital circuit calculates slower than low-precision, which uses the same space and power

 a logic gate is an arrangement of electrically controlled switches
 ek logic get kaa output ek vidyut pravaah yaa voltage hota he jo adhikansh logic gates par niyantran or use mode saktaa he
 Often logic gates use the lowest number of transistors to reduce their size, power consumption and cost, and increase their reliability

 Lookup tables can function like logic gates based on machines but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the strings
 iskaa arth yah he ki diziner, aksar taron kii vyavastha ko badale bina hi dizin trutiyon kii marammat kar sakate hai
 Therefore small amounts of product programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution

 Some analysis methods only work with special representation
 logic geton ke samakaksh set ke saath digital circuit kaa pratinidhitiv shastreey tarika he
 Another approach is to construct a system often equivalent to electronic switches with minimal electronic
 sirf ek truth teble se yukt smriti aasaan tareekon main se ek hota he
 Inputs are inserted at the memory address and the data outputs of the memory become outputs
 swachaalit vishleshan ke liye in prativednon ke paas digital fil swaroop hote hai jise computer program dwaara process kiya ja saktaa he
 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines
 is tareeke se ejeeniyar ek system ke sakal vyavhaar ko dizin kar sakate hai or yahaan tak ki logic prakriyaayon ke vivaran par vichaar kiye bina satat anukaran main bhi iskaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, bina tark kaaryon ke sabhi vivaran par vichaar kiye
 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change
 tulykaalik anukramik system atulykaalik circuit kii visheshta se bana hota he jaise flip flop, jo clock jab parivartan karata he tabhi ye parivartan karata he or jisamen timming margin ko dhyaan se dizin kiya jaataa he
 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"
 har baar ek ghadi tik tik kii signal detii he or state register sangyojan logic ke pichley state se utpann pratikriya par kabja kar leti he or state mashin ke sangyojan bhaag main aparivertineeya input ke rup main phir se ise daal detii he
 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed
 has been done
 tej bhaagon ke upyog dwaara ek atulykaalik circuit nirmaan, apratyaksh rup se circuit ko tezi se "daudati" he
 Generally, many digital systems are data flow machines
 aksar inhen tulykaalik register hastantaran logic kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he or isamen VHDL yaa verilog hardware varnan bhashaaon ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers
 prayek register kaa output taron kaa bandal he jise ek "bas" kaha jaataa he jo anya akalan ke liye us nambar ko paas rakhata he
 This assessment is only a part of combination logic
 prayek akalan ke paas ek bas output hota he or ye kai input registeron se judaa ho saktaa he
 Sometimes a register has a multiplexer on its input so that it can store numbers from any one of several buses
 vaikalpik rup se kai chizon ke output ko baphers ke madhyam se joda ja saktaa he jo ek ko chhodkar sabhi upkarnon ke output ko band kar saktaa he
 The sequential state machine controls when new data from each register is accepted from the input
 1980 ke dashak main kuch shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki lagbhag sabhi tulykaalik register-transfar mashiinon ko first-in-first-out tulykaalan logic kaa upyog karke atulykaalik diginon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The digital machine, in this scheme, is identified as a set of data flows
 pravaah ke har kadam main, ek atulykaalik "tulykaalan circuit" nirdhaarit karata he jab us step kaa output thos or ek prastut sanket detaa he ki un stejon ko "data ko pakado" jisamen un stejon ke input main prayog hua he
 This requires some relatively simple synchronization circuits
 sabase saamaanya-uddeshy transfar-logic mashin ek computer he
 It is basically an automatic binary abacus
 aam taur par computer kii niyantran ikai kaa dizin ek micro program ke rup main kiya gaya he jise ek microsikvencer dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 This micro program is like a player-piano roll
 har talika pravishti yaa sookshm program ke "shabd" state ke har bit ko cmand detii he jo ki computer par niyantran karti he
 The sequencer then counts it and addresses this count in a memory or combinational logic machine that contains the micro-program
 microprogram se bits ankaganitiya logic ikai, memory or computer ke anya bhaagon or swayan microsicyonsar par niyantran karata he
 In this way, the complex task of designing computer control was transformed into a relatively simple collection of logic machines
 computer architekchar ek vishesh ejineering gatividhi he jo register, akalan logic, bason or computer ke anya bhaagon ko kuch prayojan ke liye sabase achche tareekon se shreneebaddh karne kii koshish karata he

 Many computers are serving detailed apprenticeships as Architech microprogrammers
 "vishisht computer" aam taur par ek vishesh uddeshy ke sookshm program ke saath ek paaramparik computer hai
 To avoid costly engineering efforts, efforts to design large logic machines have been heavily automated
 computer program ko "electronic dizine swachaalan upkaran" yaa bas "EDA" kaha jaataa he
 a simple Truth table-style description of logic, often optimized with EDA that automatically generates reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still give the desired results
 is prakaar ke software kaa sabase saamaanya udhaaharan aspreso huristic logic minimiser he
 Most practical algorithms for optimizing large logic systems, using algebraic manipulations or binary decision diagrams and experiments with genetic algorithms and thermal optimization, are full of possibilities
 mahangi ejineering prakriyaaon ko swachaalit karne ke liye, kuch EDA state teble le sakate hai jo state mashin kaa varnan karte hai or ek state mashin ke mishrit bhaag ke liye ek truth teble yaa ek function teble kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai
 The state table is a piece of text that lists each state with conditions, which control the transition between them and the corresponding output signals
 yah aise computer utpann state mashiinon ke function teble ke liye aam he ki unhen logic minimiraseshan software minilog ke saath anukulit kiya jaae
 Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using an "instrument flow"
 upkaran pravaah, aam taur par ek "script" hoti he, ek saral computer bhashaa jo sahi kram main software dizin upkarnon ko lagu kar sakati he
 Equipment flow for large logic systems, such as microprocessors, can be thousands of commands long and combine the work of hundreds of engineers
 upkaran pravaah kaa lekhan or dibging, digital dizin kaa utpaadan karne vaali companiyon main ek sthapit ejineering visheshta he
 The tool flow is usually erased into a detailed computer file or set of files that describes how to physically construct the logic
 isamen aksar ek ekikrut paripath yaa mudrit circuit board par transistor or taar khinchne ke nirdesh shaamil hote hai
 Parts of the instrument flow are debugged by verifying the output of the simulated logic against the expected input
 pareekshan upkaran, input or output ke set ke saath computer filon ko lete hai or nakli vyavhaar or apekshit vyavhaar ke bich visangatiyon par prakaash daalate hai
 Once the input data is considered correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness
 kuch upkaran pravaah, pehle ek dizine ke utpaadan dwaara dizin kii pushti karte hai or phir upkaran pravaah ke liye sangat input data ke utpaadan ke liye dizin kii scanning karte hai
 If the scanned data coincides with the input data, the instrument flow probably introduced no errors
 kaaryaatmak satyaapan data, aam taur par "pareekshan vector" kehalaate hai
 The functional test vector can be preserved and used in the factory to test whether the newly constructed logic works correctly
 haalanki, kaaryaatmak pareekshan pattern, aam nirmaan galatiyon kii khoj nahin karte

 These tests generate the vector, by examining the structure of logic and systematically generating tests for specific faults
 is tarah folt kawarej kareeb 100% tak pahunch saktaa he, basharte dizine ko thik tarah se pareekshan yogya banaaya gaya ho 
 Once a design exists and is verified and testable, it often needs to be processed to be product qualified

 digital logic kii ek pranali kii vyaavhaarikta kaa nirdhaaran kai chizein karti hai
 To achieve an ideal combination of fanout, speed, low cost, and reliability, engineers inspected several electronic devices
 ek logic get kii laagat mahatvapurn hoti he
 In the 1930s, early digital logic systems were made from telephone relays because they were cheap and relatively reliable
 uske baad, ejiniyaron ne hameshaa sabase sasta uplabdh electronic switch upyog kiya, jo abhi bhi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The early integrated circuits were a joyous coincidence

 dev rishi naarad purvajanm main gandharva the
 Once a meeting was convened in Brahmaloka in which many gods gathered for the Bhagavanam Sankirtan
 vahaan naarad bhi apni striyon ke saath padhaare
 Brahma cursed Narada to be a Shudra while leaving Bhagavannama in the Lord's Sankirtan Sabha and humiliate him
 is kaaran naarad ji kaa janm shudra kul main ho gaya
 The father died only after his birth
 mata daasi kaa kaary kar naarad ji kaa bharan poshan karti thi
 Once upon a time, some Mahatmas arrived in his village and he stayed there to spend his life
 naarad ji bachapan main bhi susheel the tathaa khel kud chhodkar un mahatmaon kii man se seva karte the tathaa vahiin apana din vyateet karte the, tanmaitapurvak bhagwatkatha suna karte the
 The sins of his previous birth were washed away by the service of the Mahatmas
 mahatmaon ne jate jate naarad ko bhagavannam sankirthan kaa upadesh diya
 Narada's mother also died of snakebite
 bhikshuk kii bhanti bhojan ke liye kisi ke ghar ke saamne khadaa rahata tab bhojan praapt hoti thi, panchavarshiya naarad in kashton ko bhagwaan kii ichha samajhakar taalte the
 Narada also used to harass other children
 naarad ne mahatmaon ke vidhi anusaar jaap kiya tab prabhu vishnu ne unhen apane chaturbhuj rup main darshan diya
 After that he did not see the Lord
 ant main unhone kathin tapasya kii tab jaakar bhagwaan vishnu nen unhen apane vishwaroop kaa darshan karaayaa or kaha ki "naarad! agle janm main tum brahma ke maanas putr tathaa mere parshad ke rup main janm loge, tab tum har din meraa darshan karoge
 "in the next life Narada was the honorary son of Brahma as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu
 bhagwaan ne bali ke upar krupa kar use bhi vishwaroop kaa darshan karaayaa
 In the previous birth, King Bali was a wicked dhutkarma who played yoke
 ek din jue se praapt dhan lekar ek vaishya ke ghar kii ore dauda ja rahaa tha, ek thokar se behosh ho bhoomi main gir padaa
 After this incident Shiva devotion was awakened in him and he worshiped Shiva

 In the end, Shukracharya sits as a pest in the pore of the Sankalpa Patra
 jab bali daan sankalp ke liye sankalp paatr se jal giraane kaa prayaas karata he tab usamen se jal kii ek buund bhi nahin girti
 Lord Vamana puts a piece of Kush in the hole through which Shukracharya becomes Kane and departs from there
 bali kaa daan sankalp purna hota he tatpashchaat bali vaaman se aagrah karte hai ki ve teen pag bhoomi naap len
 The size of God increases, in the end, God takes on a great form and extends one of his positions towards the sky

 There Brahma performed the plantation of whose water the river Ganges flowed
 bhagwaan kaa ek paad naglok, sutal, rasaatal aadi lokon ko paar kar pataal main pahunch jaataa he
 God gave the whole kingdom of sacrifice in two terms
 prabhu bali se prashn karte he, "he bali! ab tum mujhe bataao ki main apana ek pair kahan rakhun?" tab bali kahata he, "he paalanhaar! aap apane charankmal ko mere mastak par rakhkar mujhe anugrahit karen
 "and God placed one of his feet on the forehead of the sacrifice and placed it in the sutal lok
 bali prabhu kaa nit darshan karnaa chaahate the is kaaran ve bhi bali ke saath sutal lok chale gaye
 As of now, his share is established in Suthal Loka as the gatekeeper of King Bali

" " mata ne baldau se poocha to unhone mata ko satya se avgat karaayaa
 Mother asked Krishna to open his mouth
 anjaan krishna ne munh kholaa
 Mother Yashoda began to find earthen particles inside the mouth of Krishna, but in the face of that child, she began to see numberless universe, numberless Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, muni, deity, human, galaxy and many types of unseen objects
 bhagwat main likhaa he ki mata yashoda ne krishna ke mukh main swayan ko krishna ke munh ko dekhte dekha
 Even after the Lord had such a vision of the world, Mother Yashoda's innocent mother kept on raining Krishna
 is ghatnakram ke baad bhi paramatma shri krishna unhen ek balak hi prathit hota tha
 The Vishwaroopa philosophy of Duryodhana is described in the Mahabharata

 " parantu duryodhana ne pandavon ko sooyee kii nok ke baraabar bhoomi dene se inkaar kar diya
 He tried unsuccessfully to take God captive
 bhagwaan ne use bhaybheet karne hetu vishwaroop se saakshaatkaar karaayaa
 He felt the heat of thousands of suns, Karna, Dhritarashtra, Shakuni, Bhishma all started seeing Krishna in him and this made him extremely afraid
 is prakaar prabhu ne bhaagyashaalee duryodhana ko vishwaroop darshan karaayaa
 In the battle of Kurukshetra, Arjuna was also introduced by Lord to Vishwaroop
 arjuna ne yuddh main apane vipareet apane hi sambandhiyon ko paaya jisase asamanjas main pad gaya ki vah dharm kar rahaa he ki adharm
 Lord Krishna who was present there as his charioteer, narrated Arjuna as Bhagavad Gita
 prabhu ne kaha ki "he parth! tumhen apane priy janon kii mrityu kaa bhay he na? to sun lo, manushya kaa keval sharir hi nasht hota he parantu uske andar kii aatma na aag se jal sakati he na hi shastro se chhinbhinn hoti he
 Just as human clothing changes, the soul also changes body

 In the context of jurisprudence, Samya or 'suniti' is a set of legal principles that complement stringent provisions of law
 saadhaaran nyaay ke anusaar sab logon ke saath nishpaksh or samaan bhav se kiya janevaala vyavhaar
 In a proverbial sense, Samya is considered synonymous with easy justice, but it would be misleading to think that the court will give its decision on all the subjects covered under natural justice
 dayaa, karunaa aadi anek manvochit gun prakritik nyaay kii seemaa ke andar hai, par nyaayalay kisi ko dayaa kaa aacharan dikhalaane ko baadhya nahin kar saktaa

 In 195-96 it was said that this court is not a court of conscidence, that is, we cannot call this court investigating cases related to 'suniti'
 usee prasang main unhone kaha ki kanoon ne vihit un adhikaron ko hi yah nyaayalay karyanvit karegaa, jinke liye desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon paryaapt nahin he
 Thus, 'suniti' is that part of natural justice which, while still being enforceable by the courts, was implemented by the 'chancery' court due to historical reasons being implemented by the Courts of Common Law
 anyathaa tathy kii drushti se 'suniti' evam 'kaaman lau' main koi antar nahin
 In ancient times, morality and law were interlinked and embodied in the broader meaning of 'religion'
 hindu dharm ke chaar strot maane gaye hai-veda, smriti, sadachaar evam suniti
 The principles of Suniti have been inherent in 'justice'
 smriti ke vachan evam sadachaar kii vishad vivruti ke baavjood nyaay ke sabhi prashnon kaa nirnay dene ke liye maanya niyamon evam kanoon kii kalpanaaon kaa aashray liya jaataa rahaa he tathaa in par suniti kii chhap spasht he
 Smritiks had accepted that Sanatan Dharma could not by nature be widespread
 at: 'nyaay' ke siddhanton ko vibhinn paristhiyon main karyanvit karnaa hi hoga
 Yajnavalkya says that if the rules of law are incompatible with each other, justice, ie natural Suniti and tact will be recognized
 brihaspativaar ke anusaar keval dharm shaastra kaa hi aashray lekar nirnay dena uchit nahin hoga, kyonki yuktiheen vichaar se dharm kii haani hi hoti he
 Narada has also considered the importance of tact
 kanoon evam nyaay ke bich shaashvat dwandv ke prasang main smritikaron ne yukti evam suniti ko manyata di he
 After the establishment of British rule in India, the decisions of the courts of this country came under the jurisdiction of the Privy Council as a final appeal
 at: england main viksit suniti kaa prabhaav hindu vidhaan par parilakshith hone laga
 The Privy Council, in Kentchuva v Girimalapya 519 A, 368, decided that if someone kills someone, that person will not be entitled to the property of the deceased
 saarvajanik niti par aadhaarit ukt niyam hinduon ke maamle main nyaay evam suniti kii drushti se lagu kiya gaya
 In different countries of the world where English rule has been in place for the last several centuries, the influence of English Suniti on the decision of their courts is clear
 at: england main suniti ke aitihaasik vikaas par kuch shabd aavashyak hai
 In the Middle Ages, the Secretariat of the King of England was called 'chancery' and his authority was known as 'chancellor'
 desh main maamalon kaa nirnay karne ke nimitt nyaayalayon ke rahane ke baavjood nyaay kii antim thati 'chanceri' raja main hi ashrith thi
 Therefore, in Chancery, applications often came that the applicant was poor, old and sick; But his opposition is rich and powerful
 isliye use ashanka he ki vipakshi juri ko ghoose degaa; apni prabhutaa se unhen bhay dikhalayegaa; athwa chaalaaki se usne kuch aisi paristhiti paidaa kar di he ki desh kaa saadhaaran nyaayalay use nyaay nahin de sakegaa
 Such application often praises God and religion in compassionate words dekar likhaa jaataa tha
 Chancellor removed the order in the name of the king and started presenting the opposition to him
 use shapath lekar aavedan kii fariyaad kaa uttar dena padataa tha
 From 1474 AD, the Chancellor began to give decisions independently and Suniti's development in Chancery Court started from here
 chanceri kii lokapriyata badhane lagi
 The main reason for this was that the Chancellor started resolving such cases for which there was no legislation in the ordinary court
 drushtaant ke liye nyaas ko le sakate hai
 In the context of deceit, accident, missing 'chancery' documents respectively and betrayal also came under his jurisdiction
 satarahavin shatabdi ke aarambh main chanceri evam kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon ke bich apane-apane adhikarashetra kaa prashn lekar vivaad upasthit hua; par antat: is baat ko manyata di gai ki chanceri nyaayalay kaa nirnay sarvopari hoga
 It is worth remembering in this context that the Court of Chancery did not directly rule on the Courts of Common Law
 usne keval safal vaadi ko vaaran kiya ki vah aniatik nirnay ko karyanvit na kare
 With the development of both these types of courts, the Chancellor's powers also became limited
 suniti ke siddhant sthir hue, jin par kaaman lau kii paridhi se baahar ke adhikaar aadhaarit the or jinke liye nidaansh apekshit tha
 In the year 1873-75 AD, two different methods of 'suniti' and Common Law became one by the internal law
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki kaaman lau ke nyaayalay vyadesh jari karne lage evam chanceri nyaayalay sanvida ke skhalan ke kaaran kshatipurti karaane laga, jaisaa purv main sambhav nahin tha
 That is, in any court of the country, the diagnosis of both common law and Suniti started to be received simultaneously
 san 1775 i
 ke baad yadi kisi maamle main suniti evam kaaman lau ke niyamon main kisi ek hi vishay ko lekar vishmata upasthit ho to suniti ke niyam kii manyata hogi
 But it is worth remembering that Suniti did not aim to destroy the common law of the country, but its goal was to fulfill it sometime
 udaahranarth, nyaas vyadesh, sanvida kii purti, evam mrit vyakti ke estate kaa prabandh suniti ke hi avdaan hai
 There was no diagnosis in the Court of Common Law for these subjects
 yah niyam suniti kaa aadhaar he
 This means that if there is any action, for which the court should give morality to the moral point of view, then the court will surely give the loan
 chanceri nyaayalay kaa aarambh isi aadhaar par hua
 The law of trust is a suitable illustration in this context
 di samuel ellen and sans li
 1 chanceri 575 main ek company ne kiraaya-kharid kii shart par mashin kharidi
 It was decided that the owner of the machine would be the seller of the machine till the last installment was paid and he would have the right to pick up the machine if the installment broke
 company ke vyavsaay vaale makaan main mashin laga di gai, at: mashin kaa kaaman lau dwaara pradutt swatvadhikaar company kaa hua
 In the back, the company mortgaged the said house to a person who had no notice of 'hire-purchase' related to the machine
 ek maamla hua jisamen nyaayalay ne yah nirnay diya ki mashin hataakar le jane kaa adhikaar bhoomi main samyik swatvadhikaar tha
 Since it was first created in sequence, it has priority over the mortgagee's right to the house
 yadi koi vyakti is vishwaas main ki amuk jameen uski he, us par makaan banaata he evam jameen kaa vaastavik swatvadhikari makaan banate dekhakar bhi vaastavik sthiti se duusare vyakti ko avgat nahin karaata to makaan ban jane par bina isaki yathochit keemat die jameen kaa vaastavik maalik makaan praapt nahin kar saktaa
 The person who built a house with true trust, will have the right to the house related expenses on that property
 ek naaballig ne trustee ko thagne ke abhipraay se yah kahkar ki vah vayask ho chukaa he, usase rupye le liye
 She would get that amount only when she was an adult
 vayask hone par usne phir trustee se ukt rakam kii maang kii
 Although the receipt of the minor is not considered confirmed, the court said that the trustee is not responsible for re-awarding the said amount
 jahaan daawa bahut purana ho chukaa he evam koi paksh apane swatv ko pun: hasil karne ke liye prastut nahin hua he tathaa usne vipakshi ke anadhikaar ko apni akarmanyata ke kaaran sweekaar kar liya he, aisi sthiti main suniti koi sahaayta nahin karegi
 But shall recognize the period of prosecution prescribed by law
 par yadi vaadi kii gafalat ke kaaran vah sakshya, jiske dwaara prativaadee maamle kaa jawaab detaa, nasht ho chukaa he to vilamb ghaatak hoga
 Ignorance of the subject, legally inability, lack of willingness, etc
 are the answers to 'delay'
 yadi sampatti kaa vibhaajan is prakaar kiya gaya ho ki k ko ek bhaag, kha ko paanch bhaag or ga ko chah bhaag mili hon, par ga apana bhaag na le sake, aisi sthiti main ecruer claj ke anusaar ga ke bhaag samaan rup se k or kha ko praapt honge
 That is, each will get three-three additional parts and the concept of inequality of fundamental division will not apply, because parity is Suniti
 yah siddhant rehan, shaasti, jabti evam anunay ke shabdon par aadhaarit nyaas ke mul main he
 When the question arises whether a property has been in possession or has been sold with the option that the seller can repurchase it, Suniti sees that the price is sufficient for the sale or No
 tathakthith khariddaar kaa sampatti par kabja hua yaa nahin
 Similarly, in a contract, if there is a condition that the guilty party will have to pay full penalty if it is not fulfilled, then Suniti sees that the amount of penalty was kept for the fulfillment of the contract or it is the amount of compensation
 yadi vaadi ne kisi moulik sanvida main apana bhaag is vishwaas main puraa kar diya he ki prativaadee bhi apana bhaag puraa karegaa, aisi sthiti main nyaayalay bahutha aisa aadesh detaa he ki prativaadee bhi apana bhaag puraa kare chunki prativaadee kaa aisa na karnaa anyaaypurna hoga
 Similarly, this principle is also reflected in the core of conversion
 is siddhant kii prishthbhumi aitihaasik he
 The Chancery Court initially did not interfere with the defendant's property
 keval use nyyochit kaary karne ko aadesh detaa tha
 If the defendant did not follow the order, the court punished him for contempt
 uski sampatti bhi japt kar lee jaati thi
 Even now Suniti's original jurisdiction rests on the presence of the plaintiff
 yadi maamle kii sampatti nyaayalay ke kshetradhikaar se baahar bhi ho, kintu prativaadee kshetradhikaar main he yaa us par kshetradhikaar se baahar bhi maamle ke nimitt samman jari karaayaa ja saktaa he evam vaadi ke maamle main naitik adhikaar he to nyaayalay prativaadee ke viruddh maamla avashya chalaaegaa
 But if there is a question of title in the land and the land is outside the jurisdiction of the court, then the court will not decide the subject

 When Vinoba Bhave visited Orissa in 1963 during the Bhoodan Movement Padyatra in Orissa, his meeting led him on the path he needed to change the fortunes of his people
 us padayatra par tulsi ne vinoba se vaada kiya ki vah jivan bhar unke dishanirdeshon or siddhanton kaa paalan karegi
 a year later in 1964, he started working in Serenda, excited by Acharya's ideals and goals and equipped with his social service training
 vinoba bhaave ke aadarshon se prerit hokar ashikshit tulsi munda ne adivasee khadaan shramikon ke bacchon ke liye ek mahua vriksh ke tale ek skool kholaa
 Charity starts at home, but Basil also chose Serenda because "it was extremely backward and poor"
 aaj unke prayaason se na keval sarenda ke graminon ko, jahaan vah apni adivasee vikaas samiti ke saath aadhaarit he, lekin is adivasee belt ke lagbhag 100 kimi aasapaas rahane vaale logon ko bhi phayda hua he

 At first it was difficult for people to understand the need of education for Tulsi
 "mujhe har ghar janaa padaa
 "actually 'because the children of this area used to work in the mines during the day' Tulsi started a night-long school with the help of village Mukhi
 phir usne khadaan shramikon ko apane bacchon ko din ke liye uski dekhbhaal main chhodane kaa aashwaasan diya
 He began by telling them stories about the freedom movement and the works of our great scholars and national leaders

 " tulsi ne apana skool ek mahua vriksh ke neeche shuru kiya
 To raise funds 'he was in short supply' he sold vegetables and moori
 baad main jab 'usne unka vishwaas hasil karnaa shuru kar diya', graminon ne unhen bhojan or rahane ke liye jagah dena shuru kar diya

 "tulsidi hamaari maa kii tarah he or vah jivan main prerana kaa hamaara strot rahi he" shrenee chaar ko sikhaane vaale sharad kumaar perei kehete hai
 His colleague Abhay Kumar Mishra agrees' and really thinks that the school competes with any government school as far as standards of education are concerned
 "ham chaatro ko sab kuch dene kaa prayaas karte hai" ve kahata he
 Tulsi, convinced of her mission to educate, is expected to undertake other development programs through her tribal development committee
 "pehali cheez jo main karnaa chaahati hoon vah he adivaasiyon ke bich sharabnoshi kii rokthaam - vah niyamit rup se hadia lete hai
 i also want to create gram sabhas and women's organizations to discuss and find ways to improve their situation, ”she says
