 But we know that because the two sides of the DNA are in parallel, due to this, there are two types of duplicate, one side where the copy is continuous, we call it the dominant edge

 But on the other side, which is a mimicry of DNA in small pieces, we call it a slow moving edge

 Ancient Nyayasutras first ten sutras in Sanskrit
jpg Akshapada, the author of the Nyasutra
 prakhyat nyaysutron ke nirmaataa kaa naam padmapurana, skandapurana tathaa vishwanath kii nyaayavritti main maharishi gotam yaa tehraaya gaya he
 In contrast, Akshapad has been considered the author of these sutras in famous jurisprudential texts like Nyayabhayasya, Nyayavartika, Tatparyatika and Nyayamanjari
 mahakavi bhaas ke anusaar nyaayashastra ke rachayita kaa naam medhatithi he 
 a sentence of these different opinions can be proved
 mahabharat ke anusaar gautam medhatithi do vibhinn vyakti na hokar ek hi vyakti hai 
 Gautama is clearly a genealogical figure and medithi is a personal noun
 akshapaad kaa shabdaarth he - 'pairon main ankhwala'
 As a result, many stories have been devised to prove the meaning of this name, which are completely fictitious, baseless and proof zero
 naiyayik gautam ke bare main anek vidwaanon ne likhaa he
 Mahamahopadhyay Pt
 Harprasad Shastri states that Gautama, based on the translation of ancient Indian texts, composed in Chinese, preceded the Buddha, but the Nyasutra in his name is a second-century composition of Jesus
 satishchandra vidhyabhushan kaa mat he ki gautamiya dharmasutra tathaa nyayasutra kaa karta ek hi gautamanamdhari vyakti rahaa hoga
 They must have been contemporaries of Buddha and their time may have been 6th century BC
 parantu vidhyabhushan yah bhi maanate hai ki is gautam ne nyayasutra ke keval pehle adhyay kii rachana kii hogi
 The subsequent four chapters would have been written by someone else much later
 pro
 yakobi ke anusaar nyayasutra shoonyavad ke nagarjun dwaara pratishthapit ho jane ke baad or vigyaanavaad ke vikaas ke pehle likhaa gaya hoga kyonki isamen shoonyavad kaa to khandan he par vigyaanavaad kaa khandan nahin miltaa
 But Prof
 According to Sherwatsky, science has also been pointed out in the Nyasutra
 at: yah 500 i
 ke baad kii rachana hogi
 But Sherwatsky's view is confusing because of not understanding the Jurisprudence
 tarksangrah ke sampadak aathle tathaa boads ke anusaar gautam ke nyayasutra kanad se pehle ke hai
 Shabaraswamy quotes from Upvarsha which seems to suggest that Upvarsha was familiar with justice
 yadi yah upavarsh mahapadam nand ke mantri hi hai to gautam ko 400 i
pus
 kaa maananaa hi padegaa
 Pro
 According to Suali, these sutras date back to 300-350 AD
 richard garvey ke anusaar aastik darshanon main nyaay sabase baad kaa he kyonki isvi san ke aarambh ke pehle iskaa kahin koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 So these sutras must have been written between 100-300 AD
 in maton main koun sa sahi he yah kahana vartmaan sthiti main nitant asambhav he
 The composition of the Nyasutras and the period of Gautama should have different views on these two questions
 jahaan tak nyaysutron kaa prashn he, nishchay hi ye sutara buddhadarshan kaa vikaas ho jane par likhe gaye hai
 It can be said even more that amendments and additions have been made in this judicial from time to time
 paratu gautam kaa naam in sutron se isaliye sambandhit nahin he ki ye saare sutara apane vartmaan rup main gautam dwaara hi virachit hai
 We can only call Gautama the originator of jurisprudence, not the author of the sutras
 ho saktaa he, gautam ne kuch sutara likhe hon, par ve sutara anya sutron main itane ghulmil gaye hai ki unako alag nikaalnaa hamaare liye asambhav he
 From these points of view we find Vidyabhushan's opinion more valid
 gautam ko akshapaad bhi kehete hai
 Vidyabhushan considers Gautam as separate from Akshpad
 nyayasutra ke bhashyakaar tathaa anya vyaakhyaataaon ne akshapaad or gautam ko ek mana he
 The word 'akshapad' means 'one who has eyes in his feet'
 vyakaran mahabhashya gautam ke siddhanton se parichit he
 The Nyasutras have five chapters and this is the basic foundation of the Nyaya Darshan
 inaki samiksha se pataa chalata he ki nyaayadarshan aarambh main aadhyatm pradhan tha arthath aatma ke swaroop kaa yatharth nirnay karnaa hi iskaa uddeshy tha
 It used to take the support of logic and logic, but its main purpose was to introduce the nature of the soul through these means
 us yug kaa siddhant tha ki jo prakriya aatmatatv kaa gyaan praapt kara sakati he vahi thik tathaa maanya he
 It does not validate the distribution: parantu aage chalakar nyaay darshan main us tark pranali kii visheshtah udbhaavna kii gai jiske dwaara anatma se aatma kaa pruthak rup bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he or jisamen vaad, jalp, vitanda, chal, jati aadi sadhano kaa prayog hota he
 The creators of these rational jurisdictions appear to be Akshadapada
 vartmaan nyaysutron main donon yugon ke chintanon kii uplabdhi kaa spasht nirdesh he
 Gautama Medhatithi is the original author of the Nyayadarshan and the revisionist-akshapad of the original treatise by incorporating Sanskrit-new themes towards it
 ayurveda kaa prakhyat granth charakasamhita bhi isi sanskaar paddati kaa parinat adarsh he
 Maharshi Agnivesh is the originator of the original book, but is considered as the antidote Charak
 nyayasutra bhi isi prakaar akshapaad dwaara pratisanskrit granth he
 Gautama is the originator of jurisprudence
 pramaanon ke aadhaar par arth kii pariksha karnaa 'nyaay' kehalaata he, at: yah mukhyat: pramanshastra he
 The theorem is also considered in this philosophy but it has become secondary
 gyaan kya he, kaise utpann hota he, uski utpatti ke kitne strot hai, un stroton ke dosha koun koun se hai, inkaa vivechan nyaay kaa vishay he
 The word 'justice' in Indian tradition is synonymous with English logic or logic
 baudhon tathaa jainon ne bhi apni tarkpaddati chalaai he or unhen bhi buddhanyay tathaa jainanyaay kaha jaataa he
 But where only the word justice has been used, 'justice' implies only the principles propounded by the sect
 is sampradaay kaa mul granth nyayasutra he jisamen paanch adhyay hai tathaa prayek adhyay do ahnikon main vibhajit he
 The number of all sources is 530
 pratham adhyay main saamanyat: un 16 vishyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he jinka vistrut pratipaadan baad ke chaar adhyyon main hua he
 The second chapter discusses skepticism and evidence
 tisare adhyay ke pratipaadya vishay hai aatma, sharir, indriya, indriyon ke vishay, gyaan tathaa man
 The fourth chapter, while discussing the nature of desire, sorrow, tribulation and salvation, also sheds light on the nature of illusions and the relation between ingredients and ingredients
 paanchaven adhyay main jati or nigrahasthaan kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Proof, Theorem, Doubt, Purpose, Parable, Theory, Components, Logic, Judgment, Suit, Jalp, Vitanda, Hetabhasa, Trick, Caste, and Nirgasthana These 16 subjects have been considered in the Jurisprudence to derive from the philosophy of 16 subjects
 pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd in chaar pramaanon se gyaan utpann hota he
 The seven substances accepted in the Vaishika philosophy become in the theorem
 isiliye parvarti naiyayikon ne nyaay ko vaisheshik ke saath sambhddha kar diya he
 Justice mainly describes the method of debate
 kaise kisi siddhant kaa upasthaapan kiya jaataa he, siddhant ke prati kitne akshep ho sakate hai, unka parihaar kis tarah kiya ja saktaa he, ye hi nyaay ke mukhya pratipaadya hai, kaha jaataa he, ki gautam ne hi sarvapratham anumaan ke paanch avyavonvale vaakya kaa prachlan kiya
 According to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, the inference is concluded in only three sentences
 vidhyabhushan ke anusaar bhartiya nyaay main avyavaatmak vaakya kii kalpana arestu ke prabhaav se utpann hui he
 But Professor Keith maintains that there is no basis for assuming the influence of Greek ideology in the early stages of justice
 gautam kii panchavyav vaakya kii kalpana unke mastishk kii hi upaj he
 Justice has been perhaps the most influential departure of Indian philosophy
 nyaysutron main pratipaadit siddhanton kaa buddha acharya nagarjun ne khandan kiya
 To answer Nagarjuna, Vatsyayan composed a commentary on the Nyasutras
 vatsyayan ke upar buddha naiyayik dinnag dwaara kiye gaye akshepon kaa parihaar karne ke liye udyotkar ne nyaayavarthik likhaa
 Vachhaspati Mishra and Udayan, respectively, composed judiciary on the judiciary and commentary on it
 in granthon ke atirikt nyaayamanjari nyaysutron kii ek swatantra vyakhya he
 Gangeshopadhyay, the promoter of Navyanya, and his followers also wrote several texts following the path shown by Gautama
 nyaayadarshan ne anek bhartiya darshanon ko prabhavit tathaa tarkpaddati kii udbhaavna dekar prerit kiya he
 Justice is one such sect which is still being widely discussed among the pundits
 gautam ishwarwadi the yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he kyonki unke sutron main ishwar kaa spasht nirdesh kahin nahin he
 Later, the rendering of God became a feature of justice
 mokshavastha main nyaay ke anusaar aatma apane saare gunon se rahit hokar apane shuddh dravya rup main avasthit rahati he
 Beyond the intellect, happiness, sorrow, desire, malice, effort and samskara, when the soul becomes in a state of blissful form of sorrow, it is called liberated
 naav yaa nauka daand, kshepani, chappu, patavaar yaa paal se chalane vaali ek prakaar kii choti jalayaan he
 Nowadays, boats have started running with engines and are becoming so big that it becomes difficult to distinguish between vessel and boat
 vastav main pot or nauka donon samanarthak shabd hai, kintu praaia: nauka shabd chote ke or pot bade ke arth main prayukt hota he
 Some of the larger ships are seen in ancient paintings, some well painted, but even if there are pictures of boats, they are very rough and inadvertent
 keval kahin kahin khudaayiyon main prastaryugiya avasheshon ke saath inke bhi bhagnavshesh mili hai
 The legend of Manu, the Bible according to the Shatapatha Brahmana after the inauguration of the floods, according to the Bible, and the Apolodares of Greece, according to Apollodares, are told in several countries of the Ducallion's escape

 The Fibonacci sequence is prepared by adding s to a sample of n - 1 length, or by adding l to a sample of n - 2 length; And the scribes showed that samples of n length are the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence

 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference

 It is generally believed that the first rhythms of Bella Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta were structured using Fibonacci numbers
 chunki mile se kilometre ke roopantaran kaarak main 1
609344 sunahare anupaat ke qareeb he, fibonachi sankhya ke yoga main mile kii duuri kaa apghaton, lagbhag kilometre yoga ban jaataa he jab fibonachi sankhyaon ko unke uttarvartiyon dwaara pratisthapit kiya jaataa he

kilometre se mile main badalane ke liye, iske badale fibonachi anukram ke neeche suchak ko khiskaaen
 The Fibonacci sequences, in two successive Fibonacci numbers, appear in biological scenes, such as branches in trees, arrangement of leaves on the stalk, pineapple pods, a folded fern artichoke flower, and arrangement of cedar cones
 In addition, many popular sources of nature claim claims related to Fibonacci numbers or gold segments, such as breeding of rabbits, spiral circles of mussels and the curve of waves
 Fibonacci numbers are also found in the bee family tree

 Fibonacci numbers also appear in the reproduction description of a population of ideally spotted bees, according to the following rules: is prakaar, nar makkhi ke hameshaa ek janak honge or maadaa makkhi ke do
 If one discovers the evolution of the offspring of a male bee, then it will have 1 female parent
 a female will have 2 parents, a female and a male
 The female will have two parents, one male and one female and one male female
 Those two females each had two parents and one male
 This sequence of numbers of parents is a Fibonacci sequence

 The Fibonacci sequence has been generalized in many ways
 These include: bharat ke bahut saare logon ko shaayad is baat kaa gyaan bhi na ho ki vigat kuch varshon main unke apane desh main jyotish kii ek nai shakha kaa vikaas hua he, jiske dwaara vaigyanik dhang se kii janevaali sateek tithiyukt bhavishyavaanee jigyaasu buddhijiviyon ke madhya charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 First of all, it was kept by me in front of the intellectual readers of Astrology of Dynamic Astrology in various issues of 1994-1995-1996 of the magazine 'babaji' to be published from Delhi
 jansamanya kii jigyaasa ko dekhte hue 1997 main dilli ke ek prakaashak ‘ajay book sarvice’ ke dwaara meri pustak ‘gatyaatmak dasha paddati: grahon kaa prabhaav’ pehle parichay ke rup main pathakon ko pesh kii gayi
 While writing this book, Dr
 Vishwambhar Nath Pandeyji, former Principal of Rauchi College, praised the 'dynamic Condition Method' and the blessings that we had soon wished to be discussed in the country and abroad, are the first and second of this book
 It appeared to be complete as soon as the edition was published
 is pustak kii lokapriyata kaa anumaan isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sheeghra hi 1999 main is pustak kaa dwitiya sanskaran prakashit karwaanaa padaa
 After the publication of the book, 'dynamic astrology remained the subject of discussion everywhere
 kadambini patrika ke navambar 1999 ke ank main shri mahendra maharshiji ke dwaara is siddhant ko prastut kiya gaya
 This method was also discussed in Jain tv's Priya Gold Future Program
 dilli ke bahut se samachar-patron main is paddati par aadhaarit lekh prakashit hote rahen
 At the beginning of the discussion of the development of dynamic astrology, it will be necessary to introduce the scientific astrologer Shri Vidyasagar Mahatha, whose scientific approach led to the birth of dynamic astrology
 mahathaaji kaa janm 15 july 1939 ko jharkhand ke bokaro jile main sthit petarwar gram main hua
 While doing his b
sc at Mahathaji Rauchi College, Rauchi, famous as a talented student, his Astronomy paper's planets were so engrossed in the constellations that the eagerness to know the movement of planetary constellations and the effect they had on the Earth's roots Became the ultimate goal of
 unke man ko na koi naukari hi bhai or na hi koi vyavsaay
 He decided to discover the secrets of nature by staying in his native village in the lap of nature
 grah nakshatron kii ore gai unki utsukata ne unhen jyotish shaastra ke adhyayan ko prerit kiya
 Due to the sharpness of mathematics and strong hold on literature, his articles in erstwhile astrological journals made a mark
 1975 main unheen lekhon ke aadhaar par ‘jyotish-maartand’ dwaara akhil bhartiya jyotish lekh pratiyogita main inhen pratham puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 After that, the process of embellishing with titles like jyotish-vachaspati, jyotish-ratan, jyotish-manishi started
 1997 main bhi nabha main yojit sammelan main desh-videsh ke jyotishiyon ke madhya inhen swarna-padak se alankrita kiya gaya
 In order to find the reasons for the lack of uniformity in the predictions of various astrologers, his scientific mind had some weaknesses in astrology
 falit jyotish kii pehali kamajori grahon ke shakti-akalan kii thi
 The plethora of formulas related to planetary power determination were misleading, which hindered astrologers from reaching a conclusion
 hajaaro kundaliyon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad inhone grahon kii gatyaatmak shakti ko dhund nikaala
 There are six types of planetary motion - apane adhyayan main inhonen paaya ki kisi vyakti ke janm ke samay atishighri yaa shighri grah apane apane bhaavon se sambandhit anayas safalataa jataka ko jivan main pradaan karte hai
 The normal and dim planets at the time of birth give the level of the Jataka to their respective expressions
 iske vipareet vakri yaa ativakri grah apane apane bhaavon se sambandhit niraashajanak vaataavaran jataka ko pradaan karte hai
 In 1981, he got rid of a weakness in traditional astrology after he found a formula to extract the kinetic strength of that planet from the angular distance of the Sun and Earth
 falit jyotish kii duusari kamajori dashakaal-nirdhaaran se sambandhit thi
 Traditional methods of scheduling were flawed
 apane adhyayankram main unhone paaya ki jyotish ke pracheen granthon main varnit grahon kii avasthaa ke anusaar hi maanav-jivan par uskaa prabhaav 12-12 varshon tak padataa he
 Moon from birth to 12 years old, Mercury from 12 to 24 years old, Mars from 24 to 36 years old, Venus from 36 to 48 years old, Sun from 48 to 60 years old, 60 to 72 years old Jupiter by age, Saturn from age 72 to 84, Uranus from age 84 to 96, Neptune from age 96 to 108 and Pluto from age 108 to 120 have influence on humans
 vibhinn grahon kii ek khaas avadhi main nishchit bhoomika ko dekhte hue hi ‘gatyaatmak dasha paddati kii neenv rakhi gayi
 All the planets in their state give fruits according to their dynamic and static power
 uparokt dono vaigyanik aadhaar praapt ho jane ke baad bhavishyavaanee karnaa kaaphi saral hota chalaa gaya
 New experiences were added to the 'dynamic Condition System' and soon there was a time when it is possible to draw an account of the happiness and sorrow and level fluctuations of one's whole life with the information of mere birth date and time of birth
 Gone
 dhanatmak or rinatmak samay kii jaankaree ke liye grahon kii saapekshik shakti kaa aakalan sahyogi siddh hua
 The predictions continued to be accurate and it seemed possible to estimate the energy of the various references contained in the Jataka and its yielding period
 gatyaatmak dasha paddati ke anusaar janmkundali main kisi bhav main kisi grah kii upasthiti mahatvapurn nahin hoti, mahatvapurn hoti he uski gatyaatmak shakti, jisaki jaankaree ke bina bhavishyavaanee karne main andeh bana rahata he
 It is also important to know the dynamic and static strength of the planets in the calculation of transit
 is jaankaree pashchaat tithiyukt bhavishyavaanea kaaphi aatmavishvaas ke saath kar paane ke liye ‘gatyaatmak gochar pranali’ kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Astrology has become an objective science with the development of dynamic condition system and dynamic transit system, on the basis of which all questions can be answered in yes or no
 gatyaatmak jyotish kii jaankaree ke pashchaat samaaj main faili dharmik evam jyotishiya bhrantiyo dur kii ja sakati hai, saath hi logon ko apane grahon or samay se taal-mail bithaate hue uchit nirnay lene main sahaayta mil sakati he
 i definitely believe and wish that dynamic astrology will be effective in proving the importance of astrology in the coming dynamic era
 lekin sarkari, ardhsarkari or gaiyrsarkari sanghathanon ke jyotish ke prati upekshit ravaiye tathaa unase praapt ho sakanevaali sahyog kii kami ke kaaran is lakshya ko praapt karne main kuch samay lagegaa, isamen andeh nahin he

 It has been set up to criticize the culture of India and Greater India

 They reveal that Ketelaar wrote grammar of both Hindustani and Persian languages in Dutch

 As i said above, in these passages the initial form of the Hindi or Khadi dialect of Agra can be seen and the influence of Braj-language is also seen on it

 In its language, impure forms are found at some places like "in place of me", "in place of yours", "tommara" and "in place of you" Tom
