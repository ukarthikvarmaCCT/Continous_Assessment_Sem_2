 The first chapter of this book is based on political and geographical disputes related to the name of the "gulf of Persia", historical documents relating to the name of the Persian Gulf, and the controversy that arose a few days ago about the naming of the Persian Gulf

 In Iran, 30 April is celebrated as the National Day of the Persian Gulf
 is din puure iran main vibhinn prakaar ke kaaryakramon kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 The Persian Gulf is an extension of the Indian Ocean in the Middle East Asia region, extending between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula
 30 april 1622 ko shah abbaas kii sena hurmuz bandargah main portugaliyon ko parajeet karne main safal hui
 Iran's non-governmental organizations decided to celebrate 30 April in 2004 as "national Day of the Persian Gulf"
 iran kii sarkaar ne bhi is prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya
 In fact two important incidents took place on 30 April
 ek to desh se portugali upniveshkwaad kaa nishkasana hua or duusare yah ki is din yah nirnay liya gaya ki faras kii khadi ke aitihaasik tathaa pracheen naam ko dekhte hue har saal 30 april kaa din “faras kii khadi kaa rashtriya diwas” ke taur par manaaya jaae
 This name and word has been a government and international name in all languages of the world from 2400 years ago to 1964
 kintu arab deshon ne 1964 main gupt taur par nirnay liya ki faras kii khadi kaa naam badal kar arab kii khadi rakh diya jaae
 The Iranian people see this decision as a model of Arab discrimination and communalism
 un kaa maananaa he ki jamaal abdul nasir ke daur tak kisi arabi dastauez yaa patr main arab kii khadi shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he or arab duniya kii saanskrithik dharohar kahi jane vaali samast mahatvapurn pustakon main “faras sagar’’ yaa “faras kii khadi’’ jaise shabd hi paae jate hai
 That is why Iranians have named this day as the "national Day of the Persian Gulf" to prevent efforts to change this historical and ancient name
 iraniyon kaa kahana he ki yadi sagaron ke naam hi badale jane hai to phir arab sagar kaa naam badal kar makraan sagar kiya janaa chahie kyonki is ke chaaron ore lagbhag sau karod se adhik gair arab log aabaad hai or is naam kaa upyog bhi portugali upniveshwaad ke daur main hi shuru hua tha

 The ethics and ritual types of kauls are known as kaulachar
 shaktamat ke anusaar sadhnakshetra main teen bhaavon tathaa saat aacharon kii vishisht sthiti hoti he- pashubhav, veerabhaav or divyabhaav
 These are the signs of three expressions
 vedachar, vaishnavachaar, shaivachaar, dakshinchaar, vamachar, siddhantachaar or kaulachar ye purvollikhit bhavatray se sambhddha saat aachaar hai
 Among them, the seeker of divine feeling is related to Kaulachara
 jo sadhak dwaitabhaavna kaa sarvatha niraakaran kar detaa he or upasya devtaa kii satta main apni satta dubaa kar advaitanand kaa aswadan karata he, vah tantric bhashaa main 'divya' kehalaata he or uski maansik dasha 'divyabhaav' kehalaati he
 Kaulachar is considered to be the best among the Tantric ethos, as it is completely untouched and untouched by the divine seeker who is immersed in the perfect monotheistic spirit
 kinhin aacharyon kii sammati main samayaachaar hi shreshth, vishuddh tantric aachaar he tathaa kaulachar usase bhinn tantric maarg he

 Lakshmidhar, the commentator of Beauty Lahiri, has directed two distinct differences of the Kauls in the interpretation of verse 41
 unke anusaar purvakaul shri chakra ke bheetar sthit yoni kii puja karte hai; uttarkaul sundari taruni ke pratyaksh yoni ke poojak hai or anya makaaron kaa bhi pratyaksh prayog karte hai
 Due to these incestuous rituals of Uttarakaul, Kaulachara began to be known as Vamachara and became a part of the public's disinterest and disregard

 i do not get angry with asking more questions
 kyonki maine apane pita se suna he ki" kiyamat ke din hamaara anusaran karne vaale gyani logon ko unke gyaan ke anuroop moolyawaan vastra diye jaayenge

 tathaa apane pati kii saahayatarth apane praano kii aahuti de di
 When Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha died, Hazrat Ali said, "today i have lost my greatest supporter

 So you were asked what your father told you? You answered that i will not tell this secret to anyone in my father's life

 And said that my father told me that you will meet me first of my family
 or main isi kaaran harsith hui thi
 One day Hazrat Prophet was sitting in the mosque with his friends
 usee samay ek vyakti vahaan par aayaa jiske kapade fate hue the tathaa us ke chehre se daridrata prakat thi
 Due to old age, the strength of his body was reduced
 paigambar us ke sameep gayi tathaa usase uske bare main prashn kiya usne kaha ki main ek dukhifat bhikhaari hoon
 i am hungry, give me food, i am clothless, give me clothes to wear, i am a pauper, help me financially
 paigambar ne kaha ki is samay mere paas kuch nahin he parantu chunki kisi ko achche kaary ke liye rasta bataanaa bhi acha kaary karne ke samaan he
 Therefore the Prophet told him the address of the house of Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha
 kyoki unka ghar masjid se mila hua tha atah vah shighrata se unke dwaar par aayaa va saahayata kii guhaar kii
 Hazrat Fatimah Salamullah Alaiha said that at this time i have nothing that i can give you
 parantu mere paas ek maala he tu ise bench kar apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar saktaa he
 Saying this, take the garland from your neck and give it to him
 fih maala hazarat paigambar ke chachaa shri hamaza ne hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha ko uphaar swaroop di thi
 He came to the Prophet with this garland and said that Fatima had given this garland
 tathaa kaha he ki main isko bench kar apni avashyaktaaon kii purti karuun
 
 paigambar is maala ko dekh kar rone lage
 a friend of yours named Ammare Yasir was sitting near you
 unhone kaha ki mujhe anumati dijiye ki main is maala ko kharid lun paigambar ne kaha ki jo is maala ko kharidega allaah us par azaab nahin karegaa
 Ammar asked the poor, how much do you want to sell this garland? He replied that i will bench it at such a price, in which i get bread to eat clothes to wear and a dinar is left nearby so that i can go to my house
 ammaar yasir ne kaha ki main isko bhojan vastra sawari va bees dinar ke badale kharidta hoon
 He was quickly prepared
 is prakaar ammare yasir ne is maala ko kharid kar sugandhit kiya
 And gave it to his servant and said that by presenting this garland to the Prophet and i also presented the Prophet to you
 paigambar ne bhi vah maala tathaa das hazarat fatima salaamullah alaiha kii bhent kar diya
 Hazrat Fatima Salamullah Alaiha took the garland and told the slave that i freed you for Allah
 das yah sunakar hansane laga
 When Hazrat Fatima asked the reason for the hags, he said that he made me laugh by this garland because it fed a hungry, clothe a clothless, gave a ride to a pedestrian, made a poor man a freedman and In the end, i went to my boss

 But the British government could not bow to him and after his release from prison in 1910, he again started to intensify revolutionary activities
 is samay tak, dhaka samooh kalakatta samooh se alag ho chukaa tha
 But in the "dhaka Conspiracy Case" by the British Government, Pullin and his 46 accomplices were arrested again on July-1910
 baad main unke 44 anya saathiyon ko bhi pakad liya gaya
 In this case, Pullin was sentenced to Kalepani and sent to the notorious Cellular Jail

 is pustak kii mahatta isi se pratipaadit hoti hati he ki iskaa anuwaad vishwa kii lagbhag har bhashaa main ho chukaa he
 Panchatantra holds the first place in the fables
 panchatantr hi hitopadesh kii rachana kaa aadhaar he
 Narayan Pandit himself has accepted- vibhinn uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi ke aas-paas nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 In which period Panchatantra was composed, it cannot be said with certainty that the original copy of Panchatantra is not available yet
 kuch vidwaanon ne panchatantra ke rachayita evam panchatantra kii bhashaa style keadhar iske rachanakaal ke vishay main apane mat prastut kiye he
 According to Mahamahopadhyay Pt Sadasiva Shastri, the creator of Panchatantra was Vishnusharma and Vishnusharma was another name for Chanakya
 atah panchatantra kii rachana chandragupta maury ke samay main hi hui he or iskaa rachana kaal 300 i
pus
 mana ja saktaa he
 But westerners and some Indian scholars do not believe this, they say that Chanakya's second name was Vishnugupta, not Vishnusharma, and from the point of view of the available Panchatantra language, it seems to be a Gupta period
 mahamahopadhyaay pan durgaaprasad sharma ne vishnusharma kaa samay ashtamashtak ke madhya bhaag main mana he kyonki panchatantra ke pratham tantra main aathvin shatabdi ke damodar gupt dwaara rachit kuttinimat kii fparyghkah swastaranamya ityadi aryaa dekhi jaati he, atah yadi vishnusharma panchatantra ke rachayita the to ve ashtum shatak main hue honge
 But the composition of Panchatantra can not be considered in the eighth century only on the basis of the said verse, because this verse can also be projected in some version
 hartel or dow kith, isaki rachana 200 i
pus
 ke baad maanane ke paksh main he
 The influence of Chanakya's Arthashastra is also visible in the Panchatantra, on its basis also it can be said that the time of Chanakya is about the fourth century BCE, so the Panchatantra must have been composed before the third century
 is prakaar panchatantra kaa rachanakaal vishyak koi bhi mat purnataya sarvasammat nahin he
 Variant - Four versions of Panchatantra are available - pratham sanskaran mulgranth kaa pahalavi anuwaad he jo ab sirian evam arabi anuwaadon ke rup main praapt hota he
 The Panchatantra appears in the multiplied 'brihatkatha' as the second edition
 ‘brihatkatha kii rachana pashachi bhashaa main hui thi kintu iskaa mularoop nasht ho gaya he or kshemendrakrut ‘brihatkatha manjari' tathaa somdev likhit ‘kathasaritsagar’ usee ke anuwaad hai
 The third edition contains a collection of Tantrayakhika and related Jain stories
 ‘tantrakhyayika’ ko sarvaadhik pracheen mana jaataa he
 Its original place is Kashmir

 According to him, 'tantrayakhya' or Tantrakhya is the root of Panchatantra
 yahi aadhunik yug kaa prachlit ‘panchatantra’ he
 The fourth version is the origin of the southern 'panchatantra' and is represented by Nepalese 'panchatantra' and 'hitopadesh'
 is prakaar ‘panchatantra’ ek granth na hokar ek vishaal sahitya kaa pratinidhi he
 Panchatantra also has an important place in world literature

 In these translations, the translation of the Pahlavi language named 'kartakadmanak' is considered to be the oldest translation

 Similarly, the basis of the stories of Greek Greek and Arabian Nights of Arabia etc
 is the basis of Panchatantra
 aisa mana jaataa he ki panchatantra kaa lagbhag 50 vividh bhashaaon main ab tak anuwaad ho chukaa he or iske lagbhag 200 sanskaran bhi ho chuke he
 This is a sign of its popularity
 panchatantra main paanch tantra yaa vibhaag he
 The department has been called a system because it has given the methods of ethical governance
 ye tantra hai- mitrabhed, mitrasamprapti, kakolukkium, labdhpranash evam aparikshitkaarak
 In short, the content of these systems is as follows: nitikthaon main ek mukhya katha hoti he or usko pusht karne ke liye anek gaun kathaayen hoti hai usee prakaar ‘mitrabhed’ naamak is pratham tantra main angikatha ke purv dakshin main mahilaropya ke raja amarshakti kii katha di gai he jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki ve apane murkh putron ke liye kaaran chintit the or isliye ve vishnusharma naamak vidvan ko apane putron ko shikshit karne ke saunp dete he or vishnusharma unhen chah maas main hi kathaon ke madhyam se sushikshit karne main safal hote hai
 Thereafter, in the Angi-tale of the part called Mitrabheda, a wicked jackal describes the enmity of a bull named Sanjeevak with a lion named Pinglak whom Singh had saved from objections and even resisted his two ministers - Karkat and Damanak
 Had made my friend
 is tantra main anek prakaar kii shikshaayen di gai he jaise ki dhairya se vyakti kathin se kathin paristhiti kaa bhi saamana kar saktaa he atah praarabdh ke bighad jane par bhi dhairya kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie- In this system, how much happiness and joy one gets from the attainment of a friend is told through the story of Kapotaraj Chitragriva
 vipatti main mitra hi sahaayta karata he- It has been said that coming to a friend's house gives more happiness than heaven
 is prakaar is tantra kaa upadesh yah he ki upyogi mitra hi banane chahie jis prakaar kaua, kachua, hiran or chuha mitrataa ke bal par hi sukhi rahe
 In it, narrating war and treaty, the story of the cavities of owls being burned by crows is told
 isamen yah bataaya gaya he ki swarthsiddhi ke liye shatru ko bhi mitra bana lenaa chahie or baad main dhekha dekar use nasht kar dena chahie
 In this system, the crow befriends the owl and later sets the owl's fortress on fire
 isliye shatruon se saavdhan rahanaa chahie kyonki jo manushya aalasy main padakar svachhndata se badhate hue shatru or rog kii upeksha karata he- uske rokane kii cheshtaa nahin karata vah kramshah usee se maaraa jaataa he- This system has the main story of apes and crocodiles, and other interlude stories
 in kathaon main yah bataaya gaya he ki labdh arthath abhisht kii prapti hote hote kaise rah gai arthath nasht ho gai
 It teaches through the legend of apes and crocodiles that the wise man wins with his wisdom and the fool is deprived of what is in his hands
 panchatantra ke is antim tantra arthath bhaag main visheshrup se vichaar purvak suparikshit kaary karne kii niti par bal diya he kyonki acchhee tarah vichaar kiye bina evam bhaleebhanti dekhe sune bina kisi kaary ko karne vaale vyakti ko kaary main safalataa praapt nahin hoti apitu jivan main anek kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, one should not blindfold
 is tantra kii mukhya katha main bina soche samajhe andhanukaran karne vaale ek nai kii katha he jisko manibhadra naam ke seth kaa anukaran karjain-sanyasiyon ke vadh ke dosha par nyaayadhishon dwaara mrityudand diya gaya
 Therefore, one should not act unfairly like a barber without being tested
 isamen yah bhi bataaya he ki puri jaankaree ke bina bhi koi kaary nahin karnaa chahie kyonki baad main pachhataanaa padataa he jaise ki brahman patnine bina kuch dekhe khun se lathpath nevale ko yah sochakar maar diya ki is ne mere putr ko kha liya he vastutah nevale ne to saanp se bachche kii raksha karne ke liye saanp ko maaraa tha jisase uskaa mukh khun se sanaa hua tha
 That's why it was said- is prakaar panchatantra ek upadeshparak rachana he
 In this, the author has shown his practical skills, political intelligence and knowledge
 niti-kathaon ke manwetar paatr praayah do prakaar ke hote hai, sajiv praani tathaa achetan padaarth
 These two types of characters are also seen in the Panchatantra - Lion, Vyghra, Shrigal, Shashak, Taurus, Donkey, etc
 in animals, Kak in birds, Uluk, Kapot, Mayur, Chatka, Shuk etc
 and other animals include snake, Nakula, Pipilica etc
 inke atirikt nadi, samudr, vriksh, parvat, guha aadi bhi achetan paatr hai, jin par ki maanviya vyavhaaron kaa aarope kiya gaya he
 In the Panchatantra, efforts have been made to make human behavior efficient in a very simple and interesting style

 The Jat ruler of Bharatpur also merged his princely state into Rajasthan
 rajasthan shabd kaa arth he: 'raajaaon kaa sthaan' kyonki yahaan gurjar, rajput, maury, jat aadi ne pehle raaj kiya tha
 The creation of Rajasthan was an important achievement in the constitutional-history of India

 With the declaration of independence, the heads of the princely states of Rajputana were vying to retain their power in the independent state as well, from the perspective of the current state of Rajasthan at that time, a total of 19 native princely states in this territory of Rajputana, There were 3 bases and one union territory
 kendra shasit pradesh kaa naam ajmer merwada tha jo sidhe kendra yani agrejon ke adhin tha
 Among these, except for Ajmer Merwada province, the princely states were ruled by the native kings Maharajas
 ajmer-merwada praant par british shaskaon kaa kabja tha; is kaaran yah to sighe hi swatantra bharat main aa jaati, magar shesh 19 riyasaton kaa vilay hona yani ekikaran kar 'rajasthan' naamak praant banaaya janaa tha
 Due to the competition for power, it seemed very difficult because the rulers of these princely states were seeing the merger of their princely states into independent India as a second priority
 unki maang thi ki ve saalon se khud apane rajyon kaa shashan chalaate aa rahe hai, unhen iskaa dirghakaalin anubhav he, is kaaran unki riyasat ko 'swatantra rajya' kaa darja de diya jaae
 The process of unification of Rajasthan, which began on 18 March 1948 amidst a decade of experimentation, was completed on 1 November 1956 in a total of seven phases

 Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner pehla charan- 18 march 1948 The first Indian government, by merging the native princely states of Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur, and Karauli, in February 1948, used its privileges to form the first union called 'matsya Union'
 yah rajasthan ke nirmaan kii disha main pehla kadam tha
 Among them, Alwar and Bharatpur were accused that their rulers were involved in anti-national activities
 is kaaran sabase pehle unke raaj karne ke adhikaar chin liye gaye va unki riyasat kaa kaamkaaj dekhne ke liye prashaasak niyukt kar diya gaya
 Due to this, the first union was formed in the direction of unification of Rajasthan
 yadi prashaasak na hote or rajkaaj kaa kaam pehle kii tarah raja hi dekhte to inkaa vilay asambhav tha kyonki in rajyon ke raja vilay kaa virodh kar rahe the
 The Matsya Union was inaugurated on 18 March 1948 and the erstwhile Maharaja of Dhaulpur, Uday Singh, was celebrated as its head
 isaki rajdhani alvar rakhi gayi thi
 The area of this new state called Matsya Union was about thirty thousand kilometers, the population was about 19 lakhs and the annual income was one crore 83 lakhs
 jab matsay sangh banaaya gaya tabhi vilay-patr main likh diya gaya ki baad main is sangh kaa 'rajasthan' main vilay kar diya jayega
 Second phase 25 March 1948 rajasthan ke ekikaran kaa doosraa charan pachchis march 1948 ko swatantra deshi riyasaton kota, bundi, jhalawad, tonk, duungarpur, banswada, pratapgarh, kishangarh or shahpura ko milakar bane rajasthan sangh ke baad puraa hua
 Kota was a major princely state in the merged princely states of Rajasthan, due to which its then Maharaja Maharao Bhimsingh was made Rajpramukh
 bundi ke tatkaaleen maharav bahadur singh rajasthan sangh ke rajpramukh bhimsingh ke bade bhai the, is kaaran unhen yah baat akhri ki chote bhai kii 'rajpramukhataa' main ve kaam kar rahe he
 This jealousy culminated in the third phase
 teesraa charan 18 april 1948 Maharao Bahadur Singh of Bundi did not want him to work under the royalty of his younger brother Maharao Bhimsingh, but it was the compulsion of the then Government of India to make Bhimsingh as the head of the state
 jab baat nahin bani to bundi ke maharav bahadur singh ne udaipur riyasat ko pataya or rajasthan sangh main vilay ke liye raji kar liya
 The intention behind this was that the Maharana of Udaipur would be made the Rajpramukh due to being a large princely state, and Maharao Bahadur Singh of Bundi would be saved from the compulsion to be under his younger brother Maharao Bhim Singh and it would avoid being recorded in the pages of history that The elder brother acted under the rule of younger brother
 atharah april 1948 ko rajasthan ke ekikaran ke tisare charan main udaipur riyasat kaa rajasthan sangh main vilay hua or iskaa nayaa naam hua 'sanyukt rajasthan sangh'
 In its cabinet headed by Manikya Lal Verma, Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur was made the Rajpramukh, Maharao Bhim Singh of Kota was made the senior vice-president
 or kuch is tarah bundi ke maharaja kii chaal bhi safal ho gayi
 The fourth phase, thirty March 1949 isse pehle bane sanyukt rajasthan sangh ke nirmaan ke baad tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne apana dhyaan deshi riyasaton jodhpur, jaipur, jaisalmer or bikaner par kendrit kiya or isamen safalataa bhi haath lagi or in chaaron riyasto kaa vilay karwaakar tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne tees march 1949 ko vrihattar rajasthan sangh kaa nirmaan kiya, jiskaa udghaatan bharat sarkaar ke tatkaaleen riyasati or grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne kiya
 The princely state of Bikaner first merged with India
 yahi 30 march aaj rajasthan kii sthapana kaa din mana jaataa he
 For this reason, this day is celebrated every year as Rajasthan Day
 haalanki abhi tak chaar deshi riyasto kaa vilay hona baaki tha, magar is vilay ko itnaa mahatv nahin diya jaataa, kyonki jo riyaste bachi thi ve pehle charan main hi 'matsay sangh' ke naam se swatantra bharat main vilay ho chuki thi
 These princely states named Alwar, Bhatarpur, Dholpur and Karauli had the suzerainty of the Government of India and due to this, their merger in Rajasthan was to be only formal
 paanchavaa charan 15 april 1949 The Government of India also adopted the formalities of merging Matsya Sandh in Greater Rajasthan on 15 April 1949
 bharat sarkaar ne 18 march 1948 ko jab matsay sangh banaaya tha tabhi vilay patr main likh diya gaya tha ki baad main is sangh kaa rajasthan main vilay kar diya jayega
 For this reason also, this phase was considered as a formality
 chatha charan 26 janvari 1950 On 26 January 1950, the princely state of Sirohi was also merged into Greater Rajasthan on the day the Indian Constitution came into force
 is vilay ko bhi aupchaarikta mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan bhi bharat sarkaar kaa niyantran pehle se hi tha
 Actually, when the process of unification of Rajasthan was going on, the ruler of the princely state of Sirohi was a minor
 is kaaran sirohi riyasat kaa kaamkaaj dovagarh kii maharani kii adhyakshata main agency concil hi dekh rahi thi jiskaa gathan bharat kii satta hastantaran ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Due to the dispute over Abu Delwada, a part of the princely state of Sirohi, the Abu Delvada tehsil was merged with Bombay and the rest of the princely state in Rajasthan at this stage
 santava charan ek november 1956 The people of Rajasthan did not want to lose the separate Abu Delwada tehsil running till now, because in this tehsil also came the abupavarvat called the Kashmir of Rajasthan, the land of other Rajasthanis, relatives of the surviving Sirohi residents and many even in other states
 Had gone andolan ho rahe the, andolan kaariyon ke jaij kaaran ko bharat sarkaar ko maananaa padaa or abu delvada tehsil kaa bhi rajasthan main vilay kar diya gaya
 In this phase, geographical and social errors were also rectified
 iske tahat madhyapradesh main shaamil ho chuke sunel thapa kshetra ko rajasthan main milaayaa gaya or jhalawad jile ke up jila sirnauj ko madhyapradesh ko de diya gaya
 With this, the construction or integration of Rajasthan was completed from today

 Any question of water engineering, it will definitely depend on two of these basic facts
 swiss ejeeniyar, danniel barnuli ne 18veen shatabdi main yah pratipaadit kiya tha ki gati maarg main kisi bhi drav ke kanon main urja samaan rahati he athwa gati urja or sthitij urja kaa yoga ek hi hota he
 Many problems are solved with this principle
 udhaaharan ke liye ek papan ek ghanfoot pani prati senkad nikaalata he
 The velocity of water at one end of it is 10 feet per second and on the other side the velocity of water is 20 feet per second, the velocity of pressure is 1
56 feet at the first end and 6
24 feet at the other end
 at: pump dwaara pani ke upar atirikt dabaav 50
68 foot daalaa gaya
 The measurement appears to be only 46 feet, as the rest of the pressure velocity changes to pressure
 barnuli ke tathy se bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 There are many other things to be diagnosed in the flow of water, such as the distribution of water from small to large exits, the reduction of the flow of the drainage due to the narrowing of the drainage, the design of the drainage and its shape on the drainage
 , The formation of small big whirlpools in the road to Nikasa, all these things are attached to the canals, or to the means made for water distribution in the water-distribution centers
 naharon main in baton par vichaar karke hi bade bade kaaryon ke abhikalp banaae jate hai
 In fact, many such things are coordinated in water engineering, which is not possible to solve through mathematics
 at: bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chote praturup arthath chote aakaar ke namoonay banaakar kiya jaataa he
 By entering water into these samples or models and measuring their speed, it is determined what effect the practical flow of water will have on the works made from different designs
 in prayogon se yahi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki kitne pani ke dabaav se athwa kitni maatra main pani ke bahaavasey, kisi vishesh abhikalp se banaaya gaya kaary sthirataa se digne lagata he athwa sthir ho jaataa he
 Although the construction of water related works depends on the basic principles of fluid engineering, but the practical smoothness and prosperity and stability of those works are properly estimated using the model
 navik kaary main jahaan bade-bade jahaaj banaae jate hai, chote-chote modelon dwaara jahaajon kii kaaryakshmata evam yatayaat yogyata kaa anumaan kiya jaataa he
 a lot of pressure is lost by friction in the flow of water
 isi kaaran bahudhaa unche yaa duuri par sthit sthalon par jalapradaay sadhano main pani anukool dabaav se nahin nikal paata
 However, in open canals, there is also a loss of pressure by friction
 jal ejiniyari dwaara is prakaar bahut se saadhan prastut kiye jate hai ki dabaav kaa kshay kam se kam ho
 Therefore, means of paving or lubricating the waterways are used
 nalikaon main jahaan jod yaa mode aate hai athwa nalika jahaan badi se choti hoti he vahaan dabaav kaa kshay hota he
 This decay of pressure can be estimated by Bernoulli's equation
 bade-bade talabon yaa jalaashyon main athwa vishesh kaaryon kii purti main bhugarbha main sarpan dwaara pani kaa kshay hota he
 For this also, by the principles of water engineering, such means are collected, through which either the plantation is stopped at all, or the water flows by the surrender at such a speed, so that the particles of the land are not removed
 yadi bhoomi ke kan hatane lagate hai to parinaam yah hota he ki abhikalp par aadhaarit kaary ke andar pole hoti rahati he or kaary kii sthirataa jokhim main pad jaati he
 a lot of work has been done in this regard in different countries
 bilai dwaara nirdhaarit "sarpan" siddhant par aadhaarit bahut se kaam banaae gaye hai
 The core of this theory was that if the route of surrender was extended, the exit velocity would be reduced
 iske baad bhartiya ejeeniyar khosla ne ek or tathy ghoshit kiya, jiske aadhaar par bahut se kaam banaae gaye
 The important area of water engineering is to make big dams and rivers or to create barges
 jahaan pani sanchit karne ke liye baandh banate hai, vahaan baandhon kii sthirataa jaanchne ke liye badi khoj kerani padati he
 Generally, the height of the dam should be one-third the width of the floor

 By traditional belief, Lao Tsu was an official inscription in the Zhou Dynasty of China and wrote this text in the sixth century BCE, although the genuineness of its creation continues to be disputed

 The first sentence of the Tao Te Ching book is 'the path that can be talked about is not the eternal path'
 puure granth main baar-baar is 'maarg' shabd kaa prayog hota he or samikshakon main isko lekar aapasi bahes hazaron saalon se chalati ai he
 In response to the question of which path it is referring to - religious, philosophical, moral or political - critic Alan Chan has said that 'such categories are the same in the Taoist point of view and are fragmented only by Western ideologies'

 In Tao Te Ching it is often taught to do something contrary to it, in which the words 'path' and 'one' point towards the original truth - tao te ching main is baat kaa bhi kaafii byora he ki sachai ke ant main pakhand badhata he - Leaders and kings are taught that the best leadership is that which is not visible to the people: sajaad gani lone bharat ke jammu or kashmir praant ke ek raajnneetijna hai

 Pip originally believes that Miss Havisham is the one who gave her the money, has started trying to become a Gentleman, helping her from the now-developed Herbert Pocket, assigned as her companion
 is
 is samay ke dauraan, misses joi mar jaati hai
 However, in a twist of a plot containing Dickens's patents, Megwitch, who finances Pip, is the criminal who was helped by Pip, who has been sent to New South Wales, where he has become very wealthy
 meguich ne apana sara dhan pip ke liye chhod diya kyonki vah uski dayalutaa ke liye aabhaar prakat karnaa chahta tha or saath hi kyonki pip use uske apane bachche kii yaad dilaataa tha, jo use lagata he ki mar chukaa he
 Pip is shocked to learn about this money philanthropist

 pip, bahut hi anichhaa ke saath meguich ke saath rahane lagata he
 In England, Megwitch's arrest warrant goes out and if he is caught, he will be hanged

 in ghatnaon ke dauraan, pip ko yah pataa chalata he ki estela jegars kii naukaraani mauli kii beti he, jisane usehatya ke aarope se bachaaya tha or jisane apane kisi or graahak ko use god de diya, miss havisham, uski seva ke badale main, use aarope se mukt kar detii he
 Pip later discovers that Megwitch is Estella's father
 pip kii orlik ke saath muthbhed hoti he, jo yah bataata he ki vah un logon main se ek he jinhone pip kii bahan par hamalaa kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Estella is married to Bentley Drumal, but the wedding is traumatic
 isse pehle ki pip meguich ke saath chalaa jaye, vah aakhri baar miss havisham se milane ke liye jaataa he
 Miss Havisham realizes that she has made Estella a monster, who breaks Pip's heart and apologizes to him
 pip miss havisham se miltaa he, use estela ke ateet or naakhush shaadi kii vartmaan paristhitiyon ke bare main pataa chalata he
 He accuses Miss Havisham that she has given Estella such an education that she does not have a feeling of love at all

 Pip heroically saves her, but she is injured and eventually dies after being ignited by fire
 pip, herbert or ek or dost, startope, meguich ko batch kar bhaagane main madad karne kii koshish karte hai, lekin iske bajaay vah pakadaa jaataa he or use jail bhej diya jaataa he
 By now, Pip is devoted to Megwitch and feels that he has now become a good and noble man
 pip meguich ko mukt karne kii koshish karata he lekin mukt hone se kuch samay pehle hi meguich mar jaataa he
 Under English law, Megwich's property passes to the Crown, thus ending Pip's "great Expectation"
 iske baad vah kaaphi samay ke liye biimaar rahata he, is dauraan joi uski dekhbhaal karata he, uske baad vah acha ho jaataa he or waapas lautataa he taaki vah biddi se maafi maange or usase pyaar kii maang kare
 haalanki, jab vah aata he, use pataa chalata he kii biddi or joi kii shaadi ho rahi he
 He thinks it is good that when he was ill he did not say anything to Joey about his interest in Biddy, Pip congratulates the happy couple
 iske baad, pip herbert ke saath kaarobaar ke liye videsh chalaa jaataa he
 After 11 successful years abroad, Pip goes back to visit Joey and the rest of his family in Marshes
 Finally, Pip goes back to the ruined Miss Havisham's house, where he finds Estella wandering
 uski shaadikhatm ho chuki he, uske bachche hai or vah chaahati he ki pip use ek dost ke rup main apana le
 kitaab main dicans kehete hai "unhen alag karne vaali koi chaaya nahin thi" jisase janata ko yah vishvas ho jaye ki estela or pip ant main ek saath ho gaye
 'after over 50 chapters in his longing for him, they end up together at the end of the book' This is the basic logical explanation that people believe he was "more than a friend" at the end of the book
 pip sadakon par estela se miltaa he
 Her abusive husband Drumle is dead and has remarried with a doctor
 estela or pip choti choti khushiyon ko ek dusre ke saath baantate hai or pip kahata he ki vah use paa nahin sakaa lekin kam se kam vah yah jaankaar khush he ki ab vah badal chuki he, ab vah thande dil vaali ladki nahin rahi jaisi ki tab thi jab miss havisham ke saath thi
 At the end of the novel, Pip states that "the anguish prevailed over Miss Havisham's teaching, and her heart was finally able to understand what my heart wanted
 " In the revised, widely published ending, this paragraph is "my dear Biddy, i have forgotten nothing in my life, anything that has ever happened before and any little thing that has ever happened
" lekin wo garib sapana, jise main kabhi chahta tha, sab biddi ne khatm kar diya, sab khatm kar diya!' " or shuru hota he "jabaki main jaanata tha ki maine wo shabd kahe hai

 "and will continue friends apart"
 i took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, i saw no shadow of another parting from her

 Beginning in Punjab, the style of gimmick became increasingly popular and spread throughout North India
 samaaj ke ucch-darje ke log ise 'sasta' or 'ashleel' samajhate the lekin yah lok-kala panapati gai
 Most critics agree that 'nautanki is an evolved form of farce style'
 nautanki ki kathaayen aksar kisi vyakti par yaa mahatvapurn vishay par hoti hai, masalan aalha-oodal kii nautanki
 Similarly, 'sultana dacoit' gimmick tells the story of a dacoit in the Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh of the same name
 bharat ke swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan us vishay par bahut si nautankiyaan huin thi jinhonen jan-saadhaaran ko is sangram main shaamil hone kii prerana di
 Nowadays, gimmicks can be seen against dowry-malpractices, terrorism and communal fighting
 darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane ke liye nautankiyon main aksar prem-sambandh ke bhi kuch tatv hote hai jinka prayog ashleelata ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, many obscene gimmicks have also been going on for one and a half years, due to which the style of gimmick is often discredited
 parmparik rup se nautankiyon main paisa banane ke liye yah zaruri tha ki darshakon ko kabhi bhi oobane na diya jaae, isliye adhiktar nautankiyon main 10 minute yaa us se kam avadhi kii ghatnaon ko ek silsile main jodakar banaaya jaataa he jisamen har bhaag main darshakon kii ruchi banaae rakhane kii koshish kii jaati he
 To keep the story interesting, heroism, love, fun, song-dancing and religion are mixed and the narrator tries to keep the audience's feelings up and down constantly
 nautanki main kavita or saadhaaran bolchaal ko milaane kii pratha shuru se rahi he
 The characters talk among themselves but deep feelings and messages are often revealed through rhyme
 gane main saarangi, table, hormonium or nagaade jaise vaadya istemaal hote hai
 For example, in a form of 'sultana dacoit', Sultana explains to his girlfriend that he is born to help the poor and therefore robs the rich
 uski premika kahati he ki use sultanaa kii veerta par naaz he : Please note that traditional hindi-urdu words are often used in Nautanki
 'kairaat' or 'khuda' jaise shabdon main bindu-vaale 'kh' kaa uccharan bindu-rahit 'kha' se zaraa alag he or 'karaab' or 'kareed' jaise shabdon se miltaa-julata he
 Similarly, in words like 'poor' and 'gum', the pronunciation of the dotted 'g' is slightly different from the pointless 'g' and is found in words like 'wrong' and 'missing'

 inkaa naam bharat me vikhyaat he , In the field of medicine, the various causes of various types of diseases are called for scientific discussion
 manushya ko apni raksha, vruddhi tathaa vikaas ke liye virdohi paristhiti se niratar sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 Adversity has to be constantly contested
 pratikul paristhiti ko anukool banane kii cheshtaa main yadi manushya deh vifal hone lagati he, to vah swayan apane ang pratyangon kii raksha hetu unki rachana tathaa kriya main aavashyak her-pher kar virdohi paristhiti se yathasambhav saamanjasy sthapit karne kaa prayaas karti he, kintu jab paristhiti kii vikatataa deh kii sahan athwa samanjan shakti se adhik prabal, yaa vegavati ho jaati he to prasthaapit saamanjasy main ulat pher ho jaataa he, jiske falswaroop virdohi paristhiti kaa dushprabhav deh ke utakon ko vikrut kar peedaakaari lakshanon se yukt rog vishesh ko prakat karata he
 Human life has become very complicated due to facing all kinds of favorable, unfavorable and changing circumstances
 isliye rogon ke vibhinn kaarnon kii vaigyanik reeti se chaanbin kar kis rogvishesh kaa pradhan kaaran tathaa uske sahaayak gaun kaarnon kaa pataa lagaana ek gorakhdhandha he
 From the point of view of pathology, broad classification of all inherited diseases is possible in this way: rog ke kaaran bhi kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The predecessor or predecessor, despite not being self-pathogenic, reduces the immune power of human body and makes it sensitive or receptive
 taatkaalik athwa uttejk kaaran rog ke prakope ko sahasaa bhadkaa dete hai
 Parasitic microorganisms enter the body and grow and by producing a special type of organism, they themselves become aggressive and do the disease
 sabhi prakaar ke kaarnon kii shrunkhlaa kaa tathaa unke paraspar sambandh or apekshaakrit balaabal ke adhyayan dwaara vaataavaran kii rogesahayak pravritiyon ko vash main kar anek rogon kaa safal niyantran yaa unmoolan sambhav ho sakaa he
 Now not only disease is studied, but the human mind combined with the overall environment has a tendency towards physical study
 is kaaran samajamoolak chikitsavigyaan ke siddhantanusaar rog kii karanmala kii vibhinn ladiyon kaa gyaan manushya ke sharir, man tathaa samaajagat dosha ke adhyayan se praapt hota he or unke dur karne ke prayaas se hi rog ke nirodhan main sahaayta milti he
 One and a half hundred years ago, the predominance of bacterial infectious diseases in the world was so high that real attention could not be drawn to other physical or functional diseases
 viksit or samrudh deshon main sankramak rogon kaa safal niyantran ho jane par, anya rogon kii rokthaam kaa prayaas santoshpurn dhang se ho rahaa he or ab vriddhavastha ke rogon kii samasya par vishesh dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Due to the heterogeneous complexity of life, the number of mental diseases, occupational diseases due to industrialization and accidents by machines is increasing, which has become necessary to pay attention
 bharat main sankramak rogon kii kami avashya hui he, kintu unka puraa niyantran nahin ho paaya he
 Here, the prevalence of infectious diseases transmitted by pests, air, water and food, along with malnourished disorders and pediatric diseases is prevalent
 rog or maadhy main bhed he
 Both are unhealthy
 maadhy kii dasha main deh kii swaabhaavik kriyaaon main aisi baadha pad jaati he jisase manushya apane jivan kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti karne main asamarth sa ho jaataa he
 This is a functional defect of the body
 parantu rogavastha main sharir kii avyavasthit kriya ke dushprabhavon, athwa ghaatak padaarthon or durghatnaon, ke kaaran deh main asaadhaaran rup se kayik rog ho jaataa he
 For this reason, there is only a partial relationship between disease and depression
 rog se maadhy hona aavashyak nahin or maadhy bina rog ke bhi sambhav he
 Physiology, chemistry and zoology are unable to reveal all the complex causes of madhya
 yah ab spasht ho gaya he ki keval kriyaagat dosha se utpann maadhy hi nahin, apitu deh ke anek kayik rogon kaa mul saamaajik, paariwarik athwa audyogic dussamanjasy, aarthik arakshita, yaa aahaar sambandhi hinata dwaara sinchit hota rahata he
 For this reason, there should be a scientific empirical treatment of functional defects, fungal diseases, mental instability and social disorder for human health, comfort and efficiency
 sabhi praaniyon kii sabhi prakaar kii purna dekhbhaal se hi rog ke gunfit kaarnon ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Incomplete or monolithic measures are meaningless
 luob pakistan ke balochistan praant ke luob zile kii rajdhani he
 It is a small town situated on the banks of river Zhob
 mul rup se yah paas main sthit gaanv ke naam par appozai kehalaata tha
 In the British era, it was renamed Fort Sandman which was changed to Zhob in 1976
 pashto bhashaa main "luob" kaa arth "risataa hua pani" hota he
 Pay attention to the pronunciation of the letter 'jha' in 'zhob' as it is slightly different from 'jh' with no dot

 angreji 'id' kaa tulya hindi
 It is of innate nature and consists mainly of the basic desires, tendencies and repressed desires of the person

 Emergency was declared in India over a period of 21 months from 26 June 1975 to 21 March 1977
 tatkaaleen raashtrapati fairuddin ali ahamed ne tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke kehane par bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke adheen apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This was the most controversial and undemocratic period in the history of independent India
 apatkaal main chunaav sthagit ho gaye tathaa naagarik adhikaron ko samaapt karke manamaani kii gai
 Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and banned from the press
 pradhanmantri ke bete sanjay gandhi ke netritv main bade paimaane par purush nasbandi abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Jayaprakash Narayan called it 'the darkest period of Indian history'
 1967 or 1971 ke bich, pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne sarkaar or bhartiya rashtriya congress party ke saath hi sansad main baari bahumat ko apane niyantran main kar liya tha
 Instead of the Union Cabinet, central government power was concentrated within the Prime Minister's Secretariat
 sachivalay ke nirvaachit sadasyon ko unhone ek khatra ke rup main dekha
 For this he relied on his principal secretary PN Haksar, who was in the inner circle of Indira's advisors
 iske alaava, parameshwar narayan haksar ne sattarudh party kii vichaardhaara "patibaddh naukarshahi" ke vichaar ko badhaava diya
 Indira Gandhi cleverly alienated her rivals, causing the Congress to split and in 1969 — two parts, the Congress and the Congress that were on Indira's side, were split
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti or congress saansadon ke ek bade bhaag ne pradhanmantri kaa saath diya
 Indira Gandhi's party was stronger than the old Congress and a strong institution with traditions of internal democracy
 duusari or congress ke sadasyon ko jaldi hi samaj main aa gaya ki unki pragati indira gandhi or unke parivaar ke liye apni vafadari dikhne par puri tarah nirbhar karti he or chatukaarita kaa dikhaawati pradarshit karnaa unki dincharya ban gaya
 In the coming years, Indira's influence grew so much that she could establish self-elected loyalists as chief ministers of states, rather than members elected by the Congress Legislature Party
 indira kii us sarkaar ke paas janata ke bich unki karishmai apil kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Another reason for this was the decisions taken by the government
 isamen july 1969 main pramukh bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran va sitambar 1970 main rajbhate se unmoolan shaamil hai; ye faisle apane virodhiyon ko saarvbhaumik jhatka dene ke liye, adhyadesh ke madhyam se achaanak kiye gaye the
 Subsequently, unlike Syndicate and other opponents, Indira was seen as an "image of the poor pro, in matters of religion, with economics and secularism and socialism standing for the development of the entire country
" " pradhanmantri ko vishesh rup se vanchit virgon-garib, daliton, mahilaon or alpsankhyakon dwaara bahut samarthan mila
 For her, she was his Indira Amma
 1971 ke aam chunaavon main, "garibi hataao" kaa indira kaa loklubhaavan naaraa logon ko itnaa pasand aayaa ki puraskaar swarup unhen ek vishaal bahumat se jeeta diya
 "with regard to such a huge margin of victory, historian Ramachandra Guha later wrote that" Congress stands as the real Congress
 It does not require any suffix to show merit
 " In December 1971, under his active war leadership, India gave East Pakistan independence from its arch-enemy Pakistan
 agle maheene hi unhen bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya, vah us samay apane charam par thim; unki jeevani lekhak inder malhotra, ke liye 'bharat kii samraji' ke rup main unka varnan" upyukt lag rahaa tha
 Opposition leaders, who routinely accused him of being a dictator and promoting a personality cult, also considered him Durga Saman
 1975 kii tapati garmi ke dauraan achaanak bhartiya raajnneeti main bhi bechaini dikhi
 All this happened with the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in which Indira Gandhi was found guilty of rigging the election and she was banned from holding any position for six years
 lekin indira gandhi ne is faisale ko maanane se inkaar karte hue sarvocch nyaayalay main apil karne kii ghoshnaa kii or 26 june ko apatkaal lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 In her message broadcast on AIR, Indira Gandhi said, "ever since i have taken some progressive steps for the benefit of the common man and the women of the country, there was a deep conspiracy against me
 " As soon as the Emergency came into force, political opponents were arrested under the Internal Security Act, including Jayaprakash Narayan, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 maamla 1971 main hue loksabhaa chunaav kaa tha, jisamen unhone apane mukhya pratidwandvi raaj narayan ko parajeet kiya tha
 But four years after the election results came, Raj Narayan challenged the election result in the High Court
 unki daleel thi ki indira gandhi ne chunaav main sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog kiya, tay seemaa se adhik kharch kiye or matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye galat tareekon kaa istemaal kiy
 The court upheld these allegations
 iske baavjood indira gandhi tus se mas nahin huin
 Even the Congress party issued a statement saying that Indira's leadership is indispensable for the party
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya kyonki mana gaya ki yah sanghathan vipakshi netaaon kaa kareebi he tathaa iskaa bada sanghathanaatmak aadhaar sarkaar ke viruddh virodh pradarshan karne kii sambhaavna rakhata tha
 The police cracked down on this organization and thousands of its activists were imprisoned
 aresas ne pratibandh ko chunauti di or hajaaron swayamsevakon ne pratibandh ke khilaaf or moulik adhikaron ke hanan ke khilaaf satyagrah main bhaag liya
 The whole of India was in a state of shock after the leaders of all opposition parties and other outspoken critics of the government were arrested and sent behind bars
 apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi samay baad, sikh netritv ne amritsar main baithkon kaa aayojan kiya jahaan unhone "congress kii fasivadi pravriti" kaa virodh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 The first mass protest in the country was organized by the Akali Dal which is known as the "campaign for the Defense of Democracy"
 ise 9 july ko amritsar main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Nearly two years after the imposition of the Emergency, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution of the Lok Sabha and holding elections
 chunaav main apatkaal lagu karne kaa faisalaa congress ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Indira Gandhi herself lost the election to her stronghold Rae Bareli
 janata party baari bahumat se satta main ai or morarji desai pradhanmantri bane
 The number of Congress members in Parliament was reduced from 350 to 153 and after 30 years a non-congress government was formed at the Center
 congress ko uttar pradesh, bihar, punjab, haryana or dilli main ek bhi seat nahin mili
 The Shah Commission was constituted by the new government to investigate the decisions taken during the Emergency
 haalaanki nai sarkaar do saal hi tik pai or andruni antarvirodhon ke kaaran 1979 main sarkaar gir gai
 Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh raised the question of dual membership of some ministers who were also members of the Jana Sangh
 isi mudde par charan singh ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya or congress ke samarthan se unhone sarkaar banaai lekin chali sirf paanch maheene
 unke naam kabhi sansad nahin jane vaale pradhanmantri kaa record darj ho gaya

 The kings of Bharatpur have built many palaces, temples, rituals and umbrellas in this dham

 Mansadevi, Mansiganga and Haridev ji, these three divinity are sitting nearby
 shri haridev ji ke mandir ke shri vigrah kaa prakatya sant shri kashwacharya ji dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Subsequently, this temple was built by King Todarmal, one of the Navratnas of Emperor Akbar and demolished by Aurangzeb, despite this it is still a major center of devotion
 shastron kii aisi manyata he ki yadi parikrama karne ke baad shri haridev ji ke darshan na kiye jaay to parikrama kaa fal adhuraa rah jaataa he
 Mansi Ganga: - Mansi Ganga, sitting at the heart of Shri Giriraj Govardhan, is the most sacred and important site of the Parikrama, which is called Mukrbind, the crown of Lord Shri Krishna

 He became a calf and entered the cows and started killing them

 Temple of Shri Mansadevi: - Shri Mansadevi is very ancient goddess in Govardhan Dham
