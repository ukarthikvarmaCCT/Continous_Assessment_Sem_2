 Therefore, the main problem of education is how to make its process strongly effective and powerful

 samay-samay par is sambandh main sanstutiyaan bhi kii jaati rahi hai, parantu shodhakartaaon ne ise kabhi gambheertha se nahin liya
 One reason for this has been that no definite opinion could be formed regarding what should be the basis of priority
 tritiy anusandhan surveykshan ke antim adhyay main dow shiv ke
 mitra ne suzav diya he ki un samasyaon ko anusandhan hetu praathamikta di jaani chahie, jinaki rashtiy shiksha-nitiyon main uthaai gai samasyaon ke samaadhaan uplabdh karaane hetu tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 Earlier also in 1975 NCERT
 In a publication of 'educational Research and Innovation', the following problems were placed on the priority list of education-research- kuch anya shiksha-shastriyon ne bhi is sambandh main vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Keeping all these in mind, there seems to be a need for research in the following areas of education on priority basis in addition to the above- uparokt kshetra ati-vistrut evam vyapak hai

 Nadir Shah Afshar was the Shah of Persia and he established Iranian sovereignty over the region after centuries
 usne apana jivan daastaa se aarambh kiya tha or faras kaa shah hi nahin bana balki usne us samay irani samrajya ke sabal shatru osmani samrajya or roosi samrajya ko irani kshetron se baahar nikaala
 He established the Afshari dynasty and its rise came at a time when the Osmani Empire was under attack from the west in Iran and the Afghans had conquered the Safawi capital Isfahan from the east
 uttar se rus bhi faras main samrajya vistaar kii yojana bana rahaa tha
 Even under this circumstance he organized his army and due to his military campaigns he is awarded titles such as Napoleon of Persia or the last great general of Asia
 wo bharat vijay ke abhiyaan par bhi niklaa tha
 After defeating the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah Alam, who was in power in Delhi, he gained immense wealth from there, including the Kohinoor diamond
 iske baad wo apaar shaktishaalee ban gaya or uskaa swasthya bhi bigadataa gaya
 In the latter part of his life he became very tyrannical
 san 1747 main uski hatya ke baad uskaa samrajya jald hi teetar-bitar ho gaya
 Nadir was born into an ordinary family in the Afshar Qalbus clan in Khorasan
 uske pita ek saadhaaran kisaan the jinaki mrityu nadir ke balykaal main hi ho gai thi
 It is said of Nadir that his mother was enslaved by the Uzbeks with him
 par nadir bhaag sakane main safal rahaa or wo ek afshaar kabeeley main shaamil ho gaya or kuch hi dinon main uske ek tabake kaa pramukh ban baitha
 He soon emerged as a successful soldier and married two daughters of Baba Ali Baig, a local headman
 nadir ek lambaa, sajila or shokh kaali aankhon vaala noujvaan tha
 He was ruthless towards his enemies but generous towards his servants and soldiers
 use ghudsawaari bahut pasand thi or ghodon kaa bahut shauk tha
 His voice was very serious and it is also considered one of the many reasons for his success
 vah ek turkmen tha or uske kabeeley ne shah ismail pratham ke samay se hi safaviyon kii bahut madad kii thi
 At that time, the throne of Persia was ruled by the Safavis
 lekin nadir shah kaa bhavishya shah ke takhtapalat ke kaaran nahin bana jo ki praayah kai safal senanayakon ke saath hota he
 He supported the Safavis
 us samay saafavi apane patanonmukh samrajya main nadir shah ko paakar bahut prasann hue
 On one side, the Osmani Empire, on the other hand, the Afghan revolt had plagued the Safavis
 iske alaava uttar se roosi samrajya bhi nigahen gadaaye baitha tha
 Shah Sultan Hussain's son Tahmasya joined Nadir
 uske saath milakar usne uttari iran main mashhad se afgaanon ko bhagaakar apane adhikaar main le liya
 Impressed by his service, he received the title of Thamasya Quli Khan
 yah ek sammaan tha kyonki isse use shahi naam mila tha
 But Nadir was not a commander to be so satisfied
 nadir ne iske baad heraat ke abdali afagaanon ko parrast kiya
 After consolidating his position in the court of Tehmashp, he planned to attack the Afghans who had captured the capital Isfahan in 1729
 is samay ek unani vyapaaree or paryatak besile vatatzes ne nadir ke sainya abhyaason ko aankhon se dekha tha
 He made a note - Nadir bowed his head in acceptance of his generals' greetings after entering the practice area
 uske baad wo apana ghoda roktaa tha or kuch der tak sena kaa nirikshan ekadam chup rahakar karata tha
 He allowed the practice to begin
 iske baad abhyaas aarambh hota tha - chakra, vyuh rachana or ghudsawaari ityadi

 nadir khud teen ghante tak ghode par abhyaas karata tha
 By the end of 1729, he defeated the Afghans three times and took Isfahan back under his control
 usne afagaanon ko mahafooj tareeke se bhaagane de diya
 He then planned a massive military campaign
 jiske liye usne shah tahmaashp ko kar vasuulne par majaboor kiya
 Usmani Turks dominated from the west
 abhi tak nadir ke abhiyaan uttari, kendriya tathaa purvi iran or usase sate afghanistan tak simit rahe the
 He drove the Osmanis from the west and soon after that he moved east towards Herat where he took control of Herat
 uski sainya safalataa tahmaashp se dekhi nahin gai
 He feared a coup
 usne apni sainya yogyata sabit karne ke makasad se osmanon ke saath phir se yuddh shuru kar diya jiskaa ant uske liye sharmnaak rahaa or use nadir dwaara jite hue kuch pradesh osmanon ko lautaane pade
 Nadir was agitated when he returned from Herat
 usne janata se apana samarthan maanga
 At the same time, one day in Isfahan, he explained to Tehmashp in a state of intoxication that he was unfit for governance and at his behest, the courtiers installed the young son of Tahamashp, Abbas
 uske rajbhishek ke samay nadir ne ghoshnaa kii ki wo kandahaar, dilli, bukhaara or istambul ke shaskaon ko haraayega
 The people present in the court felt that this was nothing but extreme self-sufficiency
 par aane vaale samay main unako pataa chalaa ki aisa nahin tha
 He prepared an army to attack the Osman in the direction of the west
 par apane pehle akraman main use paraajay mili
 Usman sent a heavy army to protect Baghdad, which Nadir could not answer
 lekin kuch maheenon ke bheetar usne sena phir se sangathit kii
 This time he defeated the Osmanis near Kirkuk
 yerawan ke paas june 1735 main usne roosiyon kii madad se osmanion ko ek baar phir se haraa diya
 Under this agreement, the Russians also withdrew from the Persian territories
 nadir ne 1736 main apane senapatiyon, prantapalon tathaa kai samarthakon ke samaksh khud ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 Shia Islam and the atrocities perpetrated by the Sunnis are of great importance in Iran's religious history
 safavi shiya the or unke tahat shiya logon ko arabon ke julm se chhutkaaraa mila tha
 Today the people of Iran are Shia and there is a tradition of abusing the first three Caliphs
 nadir shah ne apni gaddi samhaalane vakt ye shart rakhi ki log un khalifaaon ke prati yah anadar bhav chhod denge
 It also benefited him
 iran main shiya sunni tanaav to kam hua hi saath hi iran ko islam ke duusare kendra ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Nadir also had a moderate religious relationship with the Armenians
 uskaa shashan yahudiyon ko liye bhi ek sukun kaa samay tha
 Within his empire, he made no attempt to inflict Sunni religion on the people, but outside the empire he became known as the Shah of the Sunni converted kingdom
 uski tulana osmani samrajya se kii jane lagi jo us samay islam kaa sarvesarva the
 Mecca was under the Osmanis at that time
 pashchim kii disha main santusht hone ke baad nadir shah ne purab kii ore apana dhyaan kendrit kiya
 The burden of military expenditure fell on the public
 usne kandahaar par adhikaar kar liya
 By making an excuse that the Mughals had given shelter to the Afghan fugitives, he traveled towards the Mughal Empire
 kabul par kabja karne ke baad usne dilli par akraman kiya
 In Karnal, there was a fight between the Mughal king Mohammad Shah and Nadir's army
 isamen nadir kii sena mughalon ke mukaable choti thi par apane barudi astron ke kaaran farsi sena jeet gai
 On reaching Delhi in March 1739, it was rumored that Nadir Shah was killed
 isse dilli main bhagdad much gai or farsi sena kaa katl shuru ho gaya
 To avenge this, he committed terrible bloodshed in Delhi and killed some 20,000 - 22,000 people in a single day
 iske alaava usne shah se vipul dhanrashi bhi lee
 Mohammad Shah also donated all the land west of the Indus River to Nadir Shah
 heere jawaharaat kaa ek zakhira bhi use bhent kiya gaya jisamen kohenur, dariyaa - nur or taj - e - meh shaamil the jinaki ek apni khooni kahani he
 The wealth that Nadir got was around 70 crore rupees
 yah raashi apane tatkaaleen saatvarshiya yuddh ke tulya tha jisamen france kii sarkaar ne austria kii sarkaar ko diya tha
 Nadir did not aim for empire expansion in Delhi
 uskaa uddeshy apni sena ke liye aavashyak dhanrashi ikaitha kerani thi jo use mil gai thi
 It is said that on his return from Delhi he had so much money that he did not tax the public for the next three years
 dilli se lautne par use pataa chalaa ki uske bete raza quli, jise ki usne apni anupasthiti main waisarai bana diya tha, ne saafavi shah tahamashp or abbaas kii hatya kar di he
 This gave him a clue that Raza is also plotting against him
 isi dar se usne raza ko vysarai se padchyut kar diya
 He then went on an expedition to Turkestan and then went on to suppress the rebellion of Dagestan
 par yahan par use safalataa nahin mili
 The Lezgo adopted the Khandak war policy and attacked Rashad's caravan and disturbed Nadir
 jab wo dagestan main tha to nadir ko khabar mili ki raza usko maarane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 This angered him and he blinded Raza
 raza ne kaha ki wo nirdosh he par nadir ne uski ek na suni
 But a few days later Nadir regrets his mistake
 is samay nadir biimaar ho chalaa tha or apane bete ko andhaa karne ke kaaran bahut kshubdh
 Nadir Shah ordered that the heads of the warlords be blown to see the blows of his son Raza Quli
 nadir shah ne un saradaaron kii galati yah tehrai ki unamem se kisi ne yah kyon nahin kaha ki raza quli ke bajaaye uski ankhen phod di jaayen
 Dagestan's failure was also eating him
 dhire-dhire vah or atyaachaari banataa gaya
 After he returned empty-handed from Dagestan, he regrouped his army for a much older goal - the Osmanian Empire of the West
 us samay jab sena sangathit hui to uski ginati thi - 3,75,000 sainik
 Hardly any army had such an empire at that time
 iran kii khud kii sena itani badi 1980 - 1988 ke iran - iraq yuddh se pehle fir kabhi nahin hui
 In 1743, he attacked the Osmanian Empire Iraq
 shaharon ko chhod kar kahin bhi use bahut virodh kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Kirkuk was captured but he did not succeed in Baghdad and Basra
 mosul main uske mahattvakanksha kaa ant hua or use osmanon ke saath samjhauta karnaa padaa
 Nadir understood that Usmani could not come under his control
 idhar nae osmani sainik uske khilaaf bheje gaye
 Nadir Shah's son Nasirullah defeated one of these, while Nadir defeated another in 1745 near Yerevan
 par yah uski aakiri badi jeet thi
 In this, the Usman gave him the right to rule at close quarters
 nadir kaa ant uski bimariyon se ghira rahaa
 He had become ill, persecuted and staunch for the day
 apane aakiri dinon main usne janata par baari kar lagaae or yahan tak ki apane kareebi rishtedaaron se bhi dhan kii maang karne laga tha
 His military expenditure had increased considerably
 uske bhattije ali quli ne uske adeshon ko maanane se manaa kar diya
 On 19 June 1747, he was killed by his own bodyguards near Mashhad
 nadir shah kii uplabdhiyaan adhik dinon tak tik nahin sakin
 Ali Quli declared himself Shah after he died
 usne apana naam adil shah rakh liya
 After Nadir died, the army dispersed and the empire began to rule independently by satraps
 europea prabhaav bhi badhata hi gaya
 Nadir had gained a reputation as a winner in Europe
 san 1768 main denmark ke chrishchiyan saptam ne sar wiliam jones ko nadir ke itihaaskaar mantri mirza mahadi astaraabdali dwaara likhi uski jeevani ko farsi se french main anuwaad karne kaa aadesh diya
 After his conquest of India in 1739, the British came to know about the weakness of the Mughals and tried to force the expansion of empire in India as an opportunity
 agar nadir shah bharat par akraman nahin karata to british shaayad is tarah se bharat main adhikaar karne ke bare main shaayad soch bhi nahin pate yaa itane bade paimaane par bhartiya shashan ko chunauti nahin dete
 The Pursuit of Happiness is an American biographical drama film directed by Gabrielle Muccino, made in 2006, based on the life of Chris Gardner

 This new relationship gives him a chance to become an intern share broker, but he almost rejects her when he finds that the job is unpaid

 Due to the demand for limited rooms, Chris had to run madly every afternoon to get a place in the line from his internship work

 ek pagal aadmi dwaara uske ek mahange haddi scinar kii chori ho jaati he or use kshatigrast bhi kar diya jaataa he, lekin kris ko vah antat waapas mil jaataa he or vah uski marammat kar letaa he

 The film was extensively filmed in San Francisco
 duboche park main ek nakli bart stesan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or film kii shooting ke baad use hataa diya gaya, traser island ke soundstejon kaa prayog set kaa nirmaan karne main kiya gaya jisamen kris kaa apartment shaamil he
 The film featured several local crew members
 san francisco chronical main mik lasaale ne yah mahasoos kiya ki, "is film kaa sabase mahaan aashcharya he ki yah bakawaas nahin he
 
 
 The beauty of this film is its honesty
 apni ruparekha main, yah parde par darshaayi gayi ek aam safalataa kii kahani nahin he, jisamen niraashaa ke ek uchit antaraal ke baad, safalataa ek sundar rup main saamne aati he
 Instead, this success story depicts the most common pattern in life - it depicts the failure and defeat that haunts the soul, the lost opportunities, the sure things that didn't happen, all of which, slowly coming into existence The barely anticipated victory comes with the corresponding accretion of victory
 anya shabdon main, yah sab vaastavik lagata he"
 Manohala Dargis of The New York Times said about the film that the film is a fairy tale in a realistic traction
 
 
 ek aisa manoranjan jo tab tak nirvigh rup se neeche utarataa jaataa he jab tak ki vah aapke galathaili main naa atak jaae 
 
 
 yah vahi puraani bootstrap kahani he, ek kalatmak rup se kaha gaya, kushalta se bechaa gaya america sapana
 us pariklit ant tak, film kaa nirmaan akhand, sada, paardarshee or mistar smith ke najuk abhivyanjaktaa ko behatar rup se pesh karne vaala tha
 
 
 How you react to this man's emotional story depends on whether you liked Mr
 Smith and his son's acting best that you would like to adopt the idea that poverty, misfortune and bad choices are the result and success is a heroic performance
 And dreams are the result
 " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three points out of four and remarked, "will Smith is heading to the Oscars
" 
 
 bhoomika ko aavashyaktaa he gurutv, smart, aakarshan, hasya kii or ek aisi aatma kii jo banaavati naa ho
 smith vaisaa hi darshata he
 That is a sure deal
 " At Variety, Brian Lovary said the film is "more inspirational than it is creatively inspired by - a kind of uplifting, post-school trait that can trigger massive toothache
" 
 
 smith ke bhavuk pradarshan kii prashansa karnaa sahaj he
 But the film's painful statement can leave its appeal to that section of the audience, who, of course, have made many debilitating TV films a hit
 
 
 In the final accounting, something ends up being like a self-assured salesman, Mr
 Gardner: easy to root for, certainly, but spending time with it is not as fun
 " Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times stated, "dramatically it does not have stages like Kramer vs Kramer, which it looks superficially similar to
 
 
 haalanki vishay gambhir he, film apane aap main maamuli he or yah kisi bhi urja ke liye apane abhinayta par ashrith he
 Even in a more humble inscription, Smith is a very attractive leading man and he makes Gardner's predicament compelling
 
 
 da parasyut of hepiness asaadhaaran abhinay vaali ek aam film he
 
 
 There are worse ways to spend the holidays and, at least, it is likely that it will force you to appreciate your circumstances
 " saint petersburg times main steve perasal ne film ko bi vargeekrut kiya or kaha, " chuttee ke samay main anivaary rup se acha mahasoos karaane ek vaala naatak he or yah us jimmedaari ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se letaa he
 

 This film places so many obstacles and solutions in front of its resilient protagonist that the amount of sentimentality and coincidence makes it feel suspicious
 
 
 naa to conred kii patakatha or naa hi muchino kaa anaavashyak nirdesan vah dikhaa paaya vaastavik kris ko behatar shikshit or adhik anbhavi namiton ke upar uthaa sake, lekin yah donon smithon ke gambheer abhinay ke madhyam se hua

 kharvel jain dharm kaa anuyaayi tha or sambhavtah uske samay main kaling kii bahusankhyak janata bhi vardhaman mahavir ke dharm ko apana chuki thi
 According to the inscription of Hathigumpha, the first fifteen years of Kharavela's life were spent in the study of learning
 is kaal main usne dharm, arth, shashan, mudrapaddati, kaanoon, shastrasanchalan aadi kii shiksha praapt kii

 Mr
 Jaiswal, assuming the name of the king of Magadha as mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription, is arguably synonymous with Pushyamitra Sunga and it is believed that Kalingaraja Kharavel attacked and defeated Sungavanshi Pushyamitra
 par anek aitihaasik hathigumpha main aaye naam ko na bahestimit sweekaar karne ko udyat hai or na hi pushyamitra ke saath milaane ko
 But there is no doubt that according to the Hathigumpha inscription, Kharavela had also conquered Magadha by invading Uttarapath and forced the king there to bow before him

 Kumarasambhavaam Mahakavi Kalidasa is an epic related to the birth of Virchita Karthikeya, which is counted in the Sanskrit ‘panch Epics’

 kuch logon kii dharna he ki kavy aath sargon main hi shivparvati samagam ke saath kumaar ke janm kii purvasuchana ke saath hi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Some say that Kalidasa got leprosy and could not write due to describing Shivparvati's sexual intercourse in the eighth canto
 ek mat yah bhi he ki unka sambhogvarnan janamanas ko ruchi nahin isliye unhone aage nahin likhaa
 The narrative described in it is summarized as follows - parvataraaj himalay ke mainaak naamak putr or gauri naamak kanya hui
 The girl also became famous by the name Parvati and Uma
 jab kanya hui to ek din uske ghar naarad aae or bhavishyavaanee kii ki kanya kaa vivaah shiv se hoga
 Hearing this prediction, the Himalayas were relieved
 udhar shiv himalay ke shikhar par tap kar rahe the
 The Himalayas sent Uma with a friend to take care of her and Uma began to serve Shiva with devotion
 unheen dinon tarakasur se yuddh main devtaa log parajeet ho gaye
 The monster started committing many kinds of tricks
 tab indra sahit saare devtaa brahri ke paas aae
 Demanded a commander worthy of Tarakasura
 tab brahri ne kaha ki shankar ke veery se utpann purush hi tumhaara yogya senapati ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you people should try and be enamored with Shiva Parvati
 yadi shiv ne parvati ko sweekaar kar liya to parvati se jo putr hoga to uske senapati banane par tumhaari vijay hogi
 Thereafter, Indradi gathered to think of a way to remove the deprivation of Lord Shiva
 jab madan us sabha main aae to indra ne unase annurodh kiya ki ve apane mitra vasant ke saath shiv ke tapasya sthaan par jaayan or shiv ko parvati ke prati aasakt karen
 Accordingly, Madan arrived at Shankar's ashram with his wife Rati and friend Vasant
 jab parvati kamalbies kii maala arpan karne shiv ke nikat pahaunchi or shiv ne use lene ke liye haath badhaaya, tab madan ne apane dhanush par mohanastra chadhaaya
 Immediately Shiva's mind was distracted
 shankar ne is prakaar man ke aksmaat vikrut hone kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye chaaron ore drushti daudai
 He saw Madan doing the grooming
 use dekhte hi shiv aag babula ho gaye; unke tritiy netra se agnijvaala prakat hui or madan usamen bhasma ho gaya
 On seeing her husband devouring like this, Rati started mourning and asked Vasant to prepare a pyre and agreed to give up her own life
 tab akashwani hui ki thodaa sabra karo tumhe tumhaara pati punah praapt hoga
 On the other hand, Shiva entered into an obstacle to avoid feminization
 madan ke bhasma hone or shiv ke antardhan ho jane se parvati ne apana sara manorath vifal hote dekha or yah sochakar ki yah rupasaundarya vyarth he, ve shiv ko prasann karne ke liye ek parvat shikhar par ja kar ugr tap karne lagi
 After sometime, Shiva's mind melted, he thought of accepting Parvati
 kintu isse purv unhone parvati kii pariksha karne kaa nishchay kiya or ve ek tapasvi ke ashram main pahunche
 Parvati received him as a guest
 tadantar us tarun tapasvi ne parvati se jigyaasa kii ki kiski prapti ke liye itani ugr tapasya kar rahi ho
 On hearing the question of the guest, Parvati was ashamed and hesitated to express her feelings, then her sakhi spoke of the desire to attain Shiva
 yah sunakar tapasvi veshdhari shiv, shiv ke durgunon or kurupata aadi kaa ullekh kar unki ninda karne lage
 Parvati did not condemn this Shiva and started scolding her
 tab shiv apane swaroop main prakat hue or unka haath pakad liya
 After that Shiva called Saptarshi and sent it to the Himalayas
 unhone unase jaakar bataaya ki shiv ne parvati kaa panigrahan karne kii ichha prakat kii he
 Then the marriage was decided and preparations for marriage started
 saptamatrikas duulhe ke yogya vastra lekar ai par shiv ne un sab ko sweekaar nahin kiya or nandi par savaar hokar hi chale
 After that, all the marriages took place
 vivaah sampann hone par shiv sahit parvati ne brahri ko pranaam kiya
 Brahma blessed
 tumhen vir putr ho
 The Apsaras came and presented a play in front of the bride and groom
 naatak samaapt hone ke baad indra ne shiv se madan ko jivit karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Finally the solitary union of Shiva and Parvati is discussed in detail

 The Himalayavarnas, the penance of Parvati, Shivninda of Brahmachari, the arrival of spring, the marriage of Shivparvati and the description of Rathikriya produce wonderful sensations

 Representation has an important place in Boorner's theory
 pratinidhitiv un niyamon kii vyavastha he jinke dwaara vyakti apane anubhavon ko bhavishya main aane vaali ghatnaon ke liye sangrakshit karata he
 This person represents his / her world / environment for a particular person
 pratinidhitiv teen prakaar se ho saktaa he - sankriyaatmak pratinidhitiv -, drishypratimaa pratinidhitiv ), or pratikatmak pratinidhitiv 
 This is the earliest form of representation that occurs in the latter half of the first year of life
 iske antargat vaataavaraniya vastuon par balak kii pratikriya aati he
 This type of representation is the hallmark of the sensory-vocal state
 yah vyakti par kendrit hota he
 Therefore, it can also be called self-centered
 yah pratyakshikaran ko kriya se alag karata he kriyaaon kii punrariti dwaara hi balak ke man main kriyaaon kii avadharana kaa vikaas hota he
 That is, it becomes easy to understand verbs in the spatial perspective
 is prakaar is pratinidhitiv main kriyamukt avadharana kaa vikaas hota he
 This representation is fully developed by the end of the first year
 yah kisi aparichit janmajaat pratikatmak kriya se prarambh hota he jo ki baad main vibhinn vyavasthaaon main roopantrit ho jaataa he
 Verbs and concepts may represent symbolic mechanisms
 lekin bhashaa pratikatmakakriya kaa sabase adhik viksit rup he
 These three representations are separate and independent from each other, but they can also be converted into each other
 yah sthiti tab hoti he jab balak ke man main koi duvidha hoti he or vah apni samasya ko sulajhane ke liye sabhi pratinidhitivon kii punrariti karata he
 This can happen in three ways - by matching, by matching and being independent from each other
 agar do pratinidhitiv aapas main milan karte he to vyakti ko duvidha nahin hoti he or vah saamaanya prakriyaaon ko karte hue apni samasyaon ko sulajhaa letaa he
 When two representations are unmatched, either one is corrected or suppressed
 purv kishoravastha main yah duvidha kriya or drishy vyavastha ke bich hoti he jinamein unhen ek yaa anya chunanaa hota he
 Repeated problems develop priority in solving problems
 kriya or pratinidhitiv ek duusare se swatantra nahin ho sakate hai kintu pratikaatmak pratinidhitiv un donon se swatantra ho saktaa he
 Language as a medium of representation differs from experience and when used on the basis of experience and thinking is capable of performing a high level of mental activity
