 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force

 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km
 isse kai guni adhik duriyon ke liye, kalenidr kii guruttvakarshan shakti samaan dravyaman vaale kisi bhi anya sharir kii guruttvakarshan shakti ke thik baraabar hoti he, bilkul surya ke samaan
 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5
5 karod prakaash vashon kii duuri par
 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox
 duusari ore, pramaatra gurutv ke bare main vichaar, yah suzav dete hai ki vahaan keval ek simit parimit utkram maap ho sakati he jo kshitij ke paas ke antariksh se sambandhit hogi: lekin kshitij ke utkram maap main parivartan or hawking vikiran kaa utkram maap sarvatha paryaapt hota he un padaarth or urja ke sabhi utkram maapon ko apane main samahit karne ke liye jo blike hole main gir rahen hon
 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood
 khaas kar, ek pramaatra str par, hawking vikiran kii pramaatra avasthaa nirdhaarit hoti he keval is baat se ki blike hole main purv main kya gir chukaa he; or itihaas ki blike hole main kya gira tha ekmaatr nirdhaarit hoti he blike hole or vikiran ke pramaatra avasthaa dwaara
 This determinism and centralization will be required
 lambey samay tak stephen hawking ne is vichaar kaa birodh kiya, apni mul 1975 kii sthiti par ve ade rahe ki hawking vikiran puri tarah se tapiya he isliye purnataya avyavasthit he, blike hole dwaara purv main nigle gaye padaarthon kii koi bhi jaankaree maujuud nahin rahati he; unhonen tark diya ki is jaankaree kaa lop ho chukaa he
 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary
 hawking kii nai gananaa kaa visheshgy vaigyanik samudaay dwaara moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki unke upyog kiye tareeke anjaane or sandigdh anurupata vaale hai
 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in
 leonard saskind or nobel puraskaar vijeta jerard tii hooft ne yah suzav diya he ki blike hole ke chaaron or ke triayami antariksh ko ghatana kshitij ke ek dwiaiami vyavhaar dwaara purna rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox
 is vichaar ko string siddhant ke arntagat samayik kiya gaya he, tathaa holographic siddhant ke taur par janaa jaataa he

 namakan prakriya : The scientific study of the traditional faith is a brief introduction to new discoveries on the sweet relation of human life and religion
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki paraprakritik vishwaas kaa logon ke jivan main lambe samay se mahatva rahaa he, shaaman yaa ojha ke punahnirmit itihaas ke aadhaar par yah avadhi 65000 varsh hogi
 Along with the development of civilization, the traditional belief took the form of religion, and influenced literature, art and society
 anumaan he ki puure vishwa main lagbhag 1 xxrep 4 0 dharm hai, or prayek dharm main anekon alokik tatv 
 Scientists think that, most of the deities are confined to small communities, but some deities must have started to develop in large religions from about 12000 years ago and spread in the world
 pichley kuch dashakon main, paraprakritik vishwaas ke jaivik or saanskrithik udvikas par nai khojon main vaigyanikon ne spasht kiya ki unka aashay kisi alokik tatv kii bhautik satta se nahin tha, unhone paaya ki devi-devataaon main vishwaas samooh ke sadasyon main sahyog, maansik swasthya tathaa sneh kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayak he
 Discoveries in literature and art show that they also have a deep penetration of the traditional faith, and a unique inclusion of supernatural elements, such as a Russell's teapot, flying saucer, spider-man, etc
 devi-devataaon main vishwaas par hue in adhyayanon ke chaar mukhya pahalu gramin parivesh, maansik swasthya, sahyog, or sneh kii bhaavana hai
 Countless articles related to the traditional belief fall into this aspect and reflect the lifestyle of local groups
 aise parichay vishwa, tathaa kshetreey, jaise pashchim himalay, str par, vistrut rup main uplabdh hai
 In these, a rural deity is said to have supernatural, jurist, physician, Mahavira, prophet, etc
 inkaa vistrut varnan bhi he, jaise bharat main, himachal pradesh ke kinnaur jile ke lok devtaa, or unase sambandhit, geet, kathaayen, lokoktiyaan, natya, bhashaa, tathaa paramparaayen, or inke abhipraay
 In another endeavor, the deity of Kinnaur is the main part of Aranyak sheep and goat farming, the main lifestyle there
 in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ek itihaaskaar kii raay he ki sthaneey vikaas ke kaaryakramon main, lok chetana kii nirnay lene main bhoomika ho
 Under the second aspect are the studies in which traditional belief, diversity of supernatural elements, and changes in them were linked to mental health
 ashis nandi ke lekh main bharat ke taintis karod devi-devtaa jo chote-chote samoohon kii jivan shaileyon ke pratibimb hai, jinamein is badlaav ke sakshya in devi-devataaon ke bahari pratikon or paramparaon, tathaa jan maanas kii gaharaai main dekhe gaye
 Taking another reference, Sudhir Kakad did not decide the role of supernatural elements in mental health, in a country like India, by bringing spirituality gurus engaged in exorcism and the message of liberation, according to the ideology of psychoanalysis

 Accurate knowledge of valency is the foundation of all chemistry
 pichley varsho main dravyon ke swabhaav tathaa gunon kaa adhik gyaan hone ke saath saath sanyojaktaa ke gyaan main bhi vruddhi hui he
 In other words, valency is a number that shows how many electrons an atom gains, or loses or shares when it binds to the atom of its own element or to the atom of another element
 19veen shatabdi ke lagbhag madhyakaal main angrej rasayanajna francland tathaa german rasayanajna colbe ne sanyojaktaa ke vishay main apni kalpanaayen vyakt kin
 Frankland demonstrated that a central element in inorganic compounds often coincides with fixed equivalents of other elements
 udhaaharan ke liye, nitrogen, phosphorus tathaa arsenic kaa ek parmaanu hydrogen tathaa chlorine ke teen athwa paanch parmaanuon se sanyog karke yogic banaata he
 Thus it appears that the combinatorial properties of the composite elements can always be satisfied by a fixed number of other atoms
 atev yadi hydrogen kii sanyojaktaa ko ikai maan liya jaae, to kisi tatv kii sanyojaktaa hydrogen parmaanuon kii un sankhyaon ke baraabar hogi jinke saath us tatv kaa parmaanu sanyog kar saktaa he
 For example, chlorine will equal the number of oxygen atoms with which the atom of that element can combine
 udaahranarth, chlorine, oxigen tathaa carbon kaa ek parmaanu hydrogen ke kramash: ek, do, teen tathaa chaar parmaanuon se sanyog karata he
 Therefore, the combinations of chlorine, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon are one, two, three and four respectively
 kuch tatv hydrogen ke saath sanyog nahin karte
 The valency of such elements can be derived by assuming one or two, respectively, of chlorine or oxygen
 udhaaharan ke liye thorium kaa ek parmaanu chlorine ke chaar tathaa oxigen ke do parmaanuon se sanyog karata he
 Therefore, the valency of thorium is four
 praaia: tatwon kii sanyojaktaa ko rekhaon dwaara dikhaaya jaataa he
 These lines can be called 'valence bonds'

 For example, in PCI3 and PCI5 compounds, the phosphorus valence is three and five, respectively
 iske vipareet carbonic yogicon main, jo adhiktar carbon, hydrogen, oxigen tathaa nitrogen ke sanyog se bane hote hai, in tatwon kii sanyojaktaa sthir or sab carbonic yogicon main kramash: chaar, ek, do tathaa teen, hoti he
 Their valence is usually never different

 The atomic weight of any element will be equal to the product of its equivalent weight and valency
 tatwon ke tulyanki bhaar prayogon dwaara saralata se nikaale ja sakate hai
 In the fourth part of the nineteenth century, when the Russian great scientist Mendeleev described the periodic table, he also explained the position of an element and its valency in that table
 tatwon ko unke parmanubhaar ke kram se rakhane par, prayek tatv apane se aathven tatv ke saath bhautik tathaa rasinic gunon main samanta pradarshit karata he
 Thus, after the invention of inert gases, the current periodic table is divided into nine groups
 inamen niskriy gaison, jaise helium, nian, agan, krypton, jinan tathaa redan kaa samooh shunya samooh kehalaata he, kyonki ye tatv kisi bhi anya tatv ke prati saadharantaya sangyojanashkti nahin pradarshit karte
 The next group is the first group of alkali or alkaline metals and their valency is also one against hydrogen, chlorine and oxygen sub
 isi prakaar dwitiya, tritiy tathaa chaturth samooh ke tatwon kii sanyojaktaa kramash: do, teen tathaa chaar he
 Elements of the fifth, sixth, seventh groups exhibit five, six and seven valencies, respectively, for oxygen, but the elements of these groups towards hydrogen and chlorine are three, two and one, respectively

 Accordingly, each atom has very small bodies in its center or navel, on which there is positive charge and the same number of electrons of this positive charge revolve in circles around the center
 antim paridhi ke electronon ko 'sangyojan electron' kaa naam diya gaya he, kyonki 'sanyojaktaa ke electron siddhant' ke anusaar, yahi electron tatv kii sangyojanashkti nirdhaarit karte hai
 For example, the composition of atoms of the first two groups of the periodic table is given below: uparyukt sarini main niskriy gaison ke parmaanuon kii antim paridhi main 8 electron hote hai
 This configuration seems to be so permanent that they themselves do not normally participate in any chemical activity, and other elements also try to gain their configuration by losing, or increasing, one, two, or three electrons
 udhaaharan ke liye, sodium kaa parmaanu ek electron khokar or fluorine kaa parmaanu ek electron kii vruddhi karke sodium fluoride banaate hai or is kriya main sodium tathaa fluoride donon aayan niskriy gas nion kaa electron vinyas praapt kar lete hai
 This type of valency is called electrical valency
 vidyutsanyojaktaa se bane yogic saadharantaya ucch galnaank or kvathanankwale hote he or jal main villin hokar ynit ho jate hai
 This type of electromechanical was first conceived by German chemist Causel in 1916
 iske atirikt amareeki rasayanajna luis ne kuch hi maas baad kalpana kii ki uparyukt vidhi ke atirikt kuch tatv ek anya vidhi se bhi niskriy gaison kaa electron vinyas praapt kar sakate hai
 According to this hypothesis, two atomic conjugates can sometimes get the configuration of both inert gases by sharing one, two, or three electrons
 is prakaar kii sanyojaktaa ko sahasanyojaktaa kaa naam diya gaya he or isamen bane sahasanyojak yogic saadharantaya nimna galnaank tathaa kvathanank pradarshit karte he or adhiktar carbonic vilaayakon main viley hote hai
 In addition to these two, another type of valency is envisaged, in which a compound or element gives its two empty electrons to another compound or element, giving the state of electron configuration of inert gases in both
 udhaaharan ke liye, ammonia apane do khaali electron hydrogen yaa boron chloride ko pradaan karke, unako kramash: helium tathaa nion kaa electron vinyas de detaa he
 This type of valency has been termed as sub-valency, since the concept of such valency has been shown to be very helpful in understanding the properties of sub-valence compounds, such as hexamine, cobaltic chloride, and potassium ferrocyanide, etc
 tatwon kii aavart sarini, jo unke electranik vinyas par aadhaarit he, kisi tatv ke parmaanu me sabase bahari kaksha me upasthit electrano kii sankhya hi us tatv kii sanyojaktaa hoti hai
 It gives an indication of the valency of the elements: prakaash kii chaal ek bhautik niyatank he
 Its exact value in vacuum is 299,792,458 meters per second, which is usually 3 lakh km / s

 By studying the change in distance between Earth's epochs during the eclipses of Jupiter's satellite, Eo, Roemer suggested a way to exclude the time it takes for light to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit
 Although the first to calculate that method was Christian Huygens, which equaled 2,14,300 kilometers per second, Roemer is the only person to find the speed of light

 ek myth yah he ki kerala kii utpatti ek sant yoddha parashuram dwaara kii gai
 The Brahminical myth claims that Parashurama, who was an incarnation of Mahavishnu, threw his furs into the sea
 As a result, the ground water of Kerala emerged
 vah vishnu ke das avtaron main se chathe the
 The Sanskrit word Parshu means Fursa and hence Parashurama means 'fursed Rama'
 His birth was intended to liberate the world from the arrogant repression of the ruling class, the Kshatriyas
 unhone prithvi ke sabhi purush kshatriyon ko maar daalaa or unke rakt se paanch jhilein bhar di
 kshatriya raajaaon ko nasht karne ke baad ve apane paapon ke pashchaatap ke liye vidwaan purushon kii ek sabha main gaye
 To save his soul from going to hell, it was advised that he should give all the conquered earth to the Brahmins
 He acted according to the advice and sat down in Gokarna to do penance
 vahaan samudr ke devtaa varun or prithvi kii devi bhoomi ne unako aashirwad diya

 goudpad yaa gaudpadacharya, bharat ke ek darshanik the
 He wrote a philosophical book called Mandukyakarika, which describes the principles of Advaita Vedanta using the terminology of secondary philosophy
 advait vedant kii parampara main gudpadacharya ko aadi shankaracharya ke 'paramguru' arthath shankar ke guru govindpad ke guru ke rup main samaran kiya jaataa he
 As a disciple of Shuk, Gaudapada should also be considered at the same time
 yadi yah sweekaar kar liya jaay to isa kii aathvin shatabdi main utpann shankar ke guru govindpad ke guru ke rup main goudpad ko kaise sweekrut kiya ja saktaa he? yadhyapi puranic log is dosha kaa marjan karne ke liye kehete hai ki goudpad himalay main samadhimagn the or govind ko "nirmaanchitt" main upasthit hokar advaitatv kaa upadesh diya tha
 Beliefs have no place in the field of cultivation of "nirmanachitta"
 haan, isse yah to siddh ho jaataa he ki yaa to goudpad shuk ke saakshaat shishy nahin the yaa phir ve govindpad ke saakshaat guru nahin the
 It is impossible to judge whether Gaudapada was an disciple of Shuk
 pracheenatar puraanon main goudpad kii aitihaasikta siddh karnaa uchit nahin jaan padataa
 Even if we consider Govindapada as an disciple of Godpada, there are many difficulties
 shankaracharya kaa samay praaia: 8 veen shatabdi isvi kaa uttarardh mana jaataa he
 If the normal lifespan of those days is also considered as 100 years, then Gaudapada will have to be considered in the seventh century
 parantu chhathi shatabdi ke ek buddha acharya bhavvivek yaa bhavy ne apane granth madhyamikahruy main vedant darshan kaa vivechan karte hue goudpad kii ek karika uddhrut kii he
 From this it is known that Gaudapada had already been revered as the Acharya of Vedanta before Bhavya
 at: goudpad kaa samay 500 i
 ke aasapaas hona chahie
 If this is true, then Gaudapada cannot be the master of Govindapada
 shankaracharya ne goudpad ko "vedantvidwavirachaayain:" kahkar samaran kiya he
 Prof
 Wallesar has written that the word "gaur" used in the word "gaudapada" is country-specific, it is not the name of the individual
 advait vedant ke do prasthaan the - pehla goud prasthaan jo uttar bharat main prachlit tha or doosraa dravid prasthaan, jisaki sthapana swayan shankar ne kii
 According to Valesar the word "gaudapada" means - the Vedic philosophical epistemological treatise prevalent in Gaud country
 parantu is prakaar kii durarudh kalpana ke liye koi drudh aadhaar nahin he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya has rightly said that if we receive a book, then someone should be an author of that book
 antarang pariksha ke aadhaar par yah dridhtaapurvak kaha ja saktaa he ki goudpad ke is granth ke chaaro prakaran ek hi lekhak ke hai
 Tradition The author of this book will have to consider a particular person named Gaudapada as the author of the book
 17 veen shatabdi ke baalkrishnanand saraswati ne "sharirak mimasaa bhashya vaarthik" naamak granth main likhaa he ki kurukshetra main hiranyavati nadi ke tat par kuch goud log rahete the
 Gaudapada was one of them
 parantu dwapar ke aarambh se hi samadhisth rahane ke kaaran unka asli naam logon ko gyaat na ho sakaa
 On the basis of this recommendation, Gaudapada should be in the vicinity of Kurukshetra
 'agadguru ratnamalastav' naamak granth ke anusaar goudpad kaa greek logon ke saath sampark tha
 Acharya worshiped him and Nishakishad Apalunya was his disciple
 apollonius bharat aayaa tha yaa nahin iske bare main greek itihasagyon main bada vivaad he or adhikansh vidvan maanate hai ki apollonius kabhi bharat aayaa hi nahin tha
 i had described India only on the basis of these heard things
 iske alaava greek granthon or apollonius ke bharatvarnan main goudpad kaa koi ullekh bhi nahin miltaa
 Nothing can be said about Gaudapada's personality other than that he was a yogi and a perfect man and the doer of Gaudapada karyakas
 goudpadakrit karikas hamaare saamne hai
 These karyas are divided into four episodes and are the work of a single person
 iskaa pehla prakaran aagam prakaran kaha jaataa he
 The reason for this is that the Karmakayam lecture of Mandukya Upanishad is present in this episode
 aagam arthath upanishad ke upar aadhaarit hone ke kaaran isko aagam prakaran kehete hai
 Some Acharyas call the karmis of this episode "agam" and do not consider them to be the works of Gaudapada
 kabhi-kabhi to in karikaon ko manducya upanishad ke saath jod liya jaataa he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya says that these karikas were written first and later the Mandukya Upanishad was formed on the basis of these
 par yah mat tarksangat nahin he
 The proof of this case comes only from the agencies of this case
 ye karikas vyakhyanatmak hai
 Therefore, only the Mandukya Upanishad appears before them
 duusare prakaran main sansar kii vitathata yaa mithyaatv siddh kiya gaya he, at: uskaa naam vaitathy prakaran he
 The third episode is called the Advaita episode due to the rendering of the Advaita element
 saare mithyaa vivaadon kii shanti kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran alaatshanti kaha gaya he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya is of the opinion that these four episodes are four independent works, not four chapters of a single book, as they are not interrelated
 saath hi chaturth prakaran ke aarambh main "tan vande dvipadambaram" kahkar buddha kii stuti ke rup main mangalacharan kiya gaya he
 Mangalacharan is done at the beginning of the scripture, Mangalacharan is not seen at the beginning of the episode in between
 at: chaturthprakaran ek swatantra granth he
 This opinion does not seem right because the first thing is that the four episodes are related to each other
 pratham prakaran main upanishad ke aadhaar par sthool rup se kuch siddhant upasthit kiye gaye hai or duusare tathaa tisare prakarnon main kramash: sansar kaa mithyaatv tathaa ek advay tatv kii sthiti kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 The fourth episode is subjunctive in which the Upanishads approved principles stated in the aforesaid three episodes are shown to be contradictory to the principles specified by Buddha
 is prakaran ke aadhaar par hi bhattacharya ne goudpad ko buddha kaha he parantu yadi ek prakaran ke aadhaar par hi unako buddha kaha ja saktaa he to pehle teen prakarnon ke aadhaar par unhen mahavedanti bhi ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 It is true that the principles of Gaudapada are close to Buddhists
 unka ajativaad madhyamik paddati par aadhaarit he
 The nature of the soul propounded by them seems like an imitation of Yogacharya's science
 unki tarkpaddati vahi he jo madhyamik shoonyavaadiyon kii he
 He has great respect for Buddha
 yah sab hote hue bhi goudpad shuddh vedanti hai, kyonki - In this context, it is important to note that Gaudapada is not only a follower of the Secondary Principles nor purely of the yogic philosophy
 jahaan unako tarksgant baat mili, unhone use grahan kiya
 He always tried to show that there is essentially no opposition between Buddhist ideology and formalist ideology
 jo virodh kiya jaataa he vah agyanamoolak he
 Gaudapada owes its Indian philosophy
 shankaracharya ne isi samanvay ke maarg ko apanaakar apana advait mat pratishthapit kiya par unka mul gudpadiya darshan rahaa
 For this reason, Gaudapada salutes the Buddha only to establish his non-opposition philosophy, so this salutation should be accepted as a propitious subject of the book, not as Mangalacharan
 aisa prathit hota he ki is darshan main tark ko utana sthaan nahin diya gaya he jitna saakshaatkaar or anubhav ko
 The path of yoga is the main path, so there should be no place for rational opposition in that path
 jaise sidhon- gunduripa, sarahapa aadi- ke naamon ke ant main "paad" shabd aata he usee prakaar goudpad ke namat main bhi paad shabd kaa prayog goudpad ke sidhon ke sath sambandh kii ore ingit karata he
 The similarity between the couplets of Sarhapada and the works of Gaudapada is also visible
 ho saktaa he goudpad buddha or bauddhetar rtaksampradaayon ke bich kii kadi hon
 In addition to this corpus, commentary above the numerology is also considered to be of Gaudapada

 baharhaal, maanav basti ke adhikansh avasheshon ko marusthal kii ret dwaara dafan kar diya gaya or bade paimaane par sadiyon se yah kshetra viraan rahaa
 In early 1923, a family of Al Dosari tribe and several families of Hovela settled here in Ad Dammam
 in pariwaron kaa netritv shaikh ahamed ebn abdullah ebn hasan al dosari karata tha jo bahrain se aayaa tha or in pariwaron ko echarem swargeey raja abdulajiz dwaara basane ke liye bhoomi chunane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Soon Ad Dammam was chosen to see that the island of Bahrain was close by and the clan was expected to return there soon, but as British rule was established in the region, it was very important for them to do so It became difficult and eventually he realized that it would be better for him to settle there permanently
 kai saal baad, shaikh ahamed kaa bhai dakshin chalaa gaya jahaan vah or uskaa parivaar al khobar main bas gaye jo ki us samay pehle se hi basaa hua tha
 This small episode, however, boosted the population in Khobar and led to closer ties with the big city of Dammam
 "dammam" kaa mul naam vivaadaaspad he, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah dhwani anukaranaatmak he or is ilaake ke nazadik hi ek drum rakhe hone ke kaaran is kshetra ko yah naam diya gaya, jab ise chetavanee ke liye bajaay jaataa tha to isse ek madhur dhwani nikalati thi jise "damdamah" kehete the, anya logon kaa maananaa he ki is naam ko arabi shabd "davama" ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he, jo paas ke ek samudri sthal ko ingit karata tha jisase dho logon ko aksar bachanaa hota tha
 When the modern state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932, the life of many settlements in the region depended on fishing and pearling
 sadi kii aadhe se adhik kii avadhi ke dauraan, is kshetra kaa vikaas udyog, vaanijya or vigyaan ke centre ke rup main hua or kareeb paanch lakh log yahaan rahane lage
 Changes started here with the discovery of commercial quantities of oil in the region
 purvi praant, duniya ke ek sarvaadhik bade tel maidan ke sheersh par sthit he or vah dahraan hi tha jahaan saudi arab kii rashtriya tel company, saudi aramko kii purvavarti aramko ne 1936 main prasiddh dammam number 7 kuan khoda jisane bina kisi shaq ke yah siddh kar diya ki is samrajya main hydrocarbon kaa ek vishaal aapurti bhandar he
 New oil fields in the south, west and north of Dammam were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, now known for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, and which encouraged building construction in response
 is desh or duniya bhar se visheshgy or takanisian nae tel ke kshetron kii khoj main madad karne ke liye or unhen dhara par laane ke liye ekatra hue
 nai pipelinon ko sthapit kiya janaa tha, bhandaaran suvidhaon kaa nirmaan karnaa tha or tankeron ko sanbhaalane ke liye jaiti kaa nirmaan kiya janaa tha
 The increasing number of specialists working in Dhahran required housing, construction of hospitals, schools for their children and other facilities
 bina adhik antaraal ke, dahraan, saudi aramko kaa korporate mukhyalay jo duniya main sabase badi tel company thi, registan main sabhi dishaao main failane lagi
 The development of the oil industry in the region had similar effects on the small fishing villages of Dammam and the village of Al Khobar
 Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mud houses of fishermen mostly built on the seabed and which were the only permanent dwellings in the area, soon turned into concrete buildings, modern dwellings, highways and orchard paths
 parasian gulf tat par dahraan ke purv main sthit al khobar sankshipt rup se saudi arab ke kachche tel ke liye bahrain main rifinary kaa ek shipping kendra ban gaya
 In the early years of World War II, oil production in Saudi Arabia was very limited and as the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent to Bahrain by small tankers
 bahrain tak ek pipe line ke nirmaan or yuddh ke baad ke varshon main tel udyog main vistaar ke baad shipping or tel udyog kaa dhyaan al khobar ke uttar kii ore dammam or raas tanura main sthanantarit hua, jo ki duniya bhar main ek sabase bada tel bhandaaran or shipping kendra he or dammam ke uttar 25 kimi duuri par sthit he
 As a result, Al Khobar gradually gained a new role as a commercial center for the entire region
 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh main purvi kshetra kii rajdhani dammam ek alag shahar tha, lekin al khobar or dahraan se vah itnaa kareeb tha ki ek yatri kuch hi minuton main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan main ja saktaa tha
 Dammam was more affected than any other city in Saudi Arabia by the discovery of oil in Dahran and its surrounding areas and the increasing importance of the entire region
 teen dashakon ke bheetar, machhlee pakadaney vaala yah chota sa gaanv eastern provins kii rajdhani ban gaya
 The simultaneous development of Dammam and Dahran and Al Khobar merged the three jurisdictions, the three cities were essentially merged into one and created a single municipality known as the Dammam Metropolitan Area, commonly known as the Dammam Area
 Is referred to as
 dammam kshetra kaa gathan karne vaale teenon shaharon ne apni khud kii visheshtaayen or kuch sthaneey prashasnic kaaryon ko banaae rakhaa he lekin kingdom main apni sthiti ke aadhaar par dammam kshetra ek ekal prashasnic ikai he
 The development of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in most parts of the world led to rapid development in the region
 jaise-jaise tel utpaadan main vruddhi hui, vaise-vaise is udyog ko chalaane ke liye adhik logon kii aavashyaktaa hui
 The growing population needed more housing and services
 uttam darje ke aspataalon or skulon ne logon ko is kshetra main aane ke liye prerit kiya
 The service industry flourished to assist the oil industry and to meet the needs of the people living in the Dammam area
 natijatan, ek aisa kshetra jahaan tees saal pehle kuch sau nivasee the aaj vahaan kii jansankhya badhkar das lakh ho gai he, yahaan jansankhya main vruddhi prativarsh paanch pratishat se bhi adhik raftaar se ho rahi he
 One of the main reasons for the immense success of the Dammam region is that unlike other oil cities in the world, it has developed in all areas
 vartmaan main yah ek aadhunik shahari or audyogic kendra he jo ki saudi arab ke tel udyog kaa mukhyalay hone vaala he

 The Daharan International Airport was established between Dhahran and Al Khobar to establish connectivity with the region and other parts of the world
 tel ke alaava anya udyogon ke vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye ek audyogic shahar ko teen shaharon ke bich khuli jagah main sthapit kiya gaya
 Where currently more than 124 factories are located, the industrial complex is completely surrounded by the urban population
 parinamswaroop, ek duusare audyogic shahar ko dammam kshetra se thodi duuri par riyaad rajmarg ke saath sthapit kiya gaya he

 hindi main isaki aavashyaktaa kaaphi samay tak nahin samajhi jaati thi; jabaki anya kai bhashaaon, jaise angreji va urdu main iskaa mahatva tha
 In English and Urdu, spelling was repeated even half a century ago, which is still in practice today
 hindi bhashaa kaa pehla or bada gun dhvanyaatmakataa he
 It is very easy to express the sounds pronounced in Hindi
 jaisaa bolaa jaae, vaisaa hi likh jaae
 This was possible due to the versatile feature of Devanagari script and still is today
 parantu yah baat shat-pratishat ab thik nahin he
 There are many reasons for this - the effect of regional regional pronunciation, diversity, confusion, continuity of tradition, etc
 jab yah anubhav kiya jane laga ki ek hi shabd kii kai-kai vartanee milti hai to inako abhivyakt karne ke liye kisi sarthak shabd kii talash hui 
 For this reason the need for standardization was felt

 He used the term Akshari, which could not come into vogue; Because at the same time the author fixed the use of syllable for syllabus in his doctoral treatise 'akshar' in Hindi language and 'limit of word'
 us samay tak bihar main ‘vivaran’ bengal main ‘banaan’ shabd hijje ssailing ke liye chal rahe the
 Apart from this, there were some other words in vogue - alphabet, syllable, description, character configuration, etc

 This is the character configuration

 Despite being opposed to the spelling word, Acharya Vajpayee's contribution to the upliftment of this word and Hindi spelling and word analysis are remarkable
 maanak hindi vartanee kaa kaaryakshetra kendriya hindi nideshaalay kaa he
 Many veterans have made their contribution in this direction, out of which the names of Acharya Kishori Dass Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable

 It is not necessary that the saint should be called the one who is a worshiper of Nirguna Brahma

 The word "saint" is the plural form of the first of the Sanskrit "sat", which means gentleman and religious person
 hindi main sadhu purushon ke liye yah shabd vyavhaar main aayaa
 The old poets like Kabir, Surdas, Goswami Tulsidas etc
 have used this word in the meaning of sage and philanthropist, masculine, and have given its symptoms
 lokopkaaree sant ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki yah shastrajna tathaa bhashavid ho
 His public interest is the only criterion of his saintliness

 Due to not having the basis of classical knowledge, such people were forced to say the same about their experience

 Being sainted, these saints have given importance to the subject and not the language
 inaki bhashaa praaia: angadh or pancharangi ho gai he
 If the importance of expressions in poetry is given importance, then because of the simple and simple expression of true and honest feelings, many of these saints' multifarious compositions can be considered as the right to get a place in the best quality poetry
 paramparaposhit prayek daan kaa aankh muundakar ve samarthan nahin karte
 The shape of his thinking is universalism
 ye maanav maanav main kisi prakaar kaa antar nahin maanate
 They say that no person is born with special features due to his clan
 inaki drushti main vaishishty do baton ko lekar maananaa chahie : abhimaantyagapurvak paroapkaar yaa lokseva tathaa ishwarbhakti
 Thus, in the field of independent thinking, these saints gave birth to an ideological revolution
 nirguniye santon kii vaani maanavkalyaan kii drushti se jis prakaar ke dharmik vichaaron evam anubhutiyon kaa prakaashan karti hai vaise vichaaron evam anubhatiyon ko puraani hindi main bahut pehle se sthaan milane laga tha
 In the ninth century of Vikrama, the works of Buddhist Siddhas presented the epithet of communal thoughts and practices related to Vajrayana and Sahajayana, as well as the repudiation of other sects
 uske ananthar nathpanthi yogiyon tathaa jain muniyon kii jo baniyaan milti hai, unamem bhi yahi bhaavana kaam karti dikhaai padati he
 The Buddhists did not have a place of God or God, the Nathpanthis revered divinity in their words

 They are seen preaching to people from place to place
 puraani hindi ke baad jab hindi kaa vikaas hua tab usapar bhi purvavarti sahitya kaa prabhaav anivaaryat: padaa
 That is why most of the compositions found in couplets in Hindi are preachy and ethical
 un dohon main katipay aise bhi he jinamein kavy kii aatma jhalkati si dikhaai pad jaati he
 But this cannot be called poetry
 pandrahavi shatee vikrami ke uttarardh se santaparampara kaa udbhav maananaa chahie
 Among the saints of these saints, the voice of ideology was predominant in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of Ramanuja, Ninevark and Madhva Vikram, the principal Acharyas of Vaishnavism
 inke madhyam se bhakthi kii ek vegavati dhara kaa udbhav hua
 The commentaries presented by these Acharyas on the departed trait is their major contribution in the development of devotion
 gorakhnath se chamatkarapradhan yogamarg ke prachaar se bhakthi ke maarg main kuch baadha avashya upasthit hui thi, jisaki ore goswami tulsidas ne sanket bhi kiya he : However, it continued to develop

 These saints were followed by the birth of the famous saint Ramanand, whose teachings had a wide impact on the masses
 yah itihassiddh satya he ki jab kisi viksit vichaardhaara kaa pravaah avaruddh karke ek duusari vichaardhaara kaa samarthan evam prachaar kiya jaataa he tab uske siddhanton ke yuktiyukt khandan ke saath uski katipay lokapriy evam lokopayogi visheshtaon ko athmiya bhi bana liya jaataa he
 Jagadguru Shankar, Raghavanand, Ramanuja, Ramanand etc
 have all had this vision
 srisampradaay par nathpanth kaa prabhaav pad chukaa tha, vah udaarataavaadi ho gaya tha
 Swami Ramanand's vision became even more liberal as a result of widespread public opinion
 isiilie unke pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh shishyon main julahe, raidas, nai, dom aadi sabhi kaa samavesh dekha jaataa he
 In this period, Satyabhiniveeshi devotees or sages also accepted the truth and attacked the untouchables
 pracheen kaal ke dharm kii jo pratik pradhan paddati chali aa rahi thi, saamaanya janata ko, uskaa bodh na hone ke kaaran, kabir jaise santon ke vyangyapradhan pratyakshparak vaagban aakarshak prathit hue
 Many of these saints understood the etishri of his sakatavya in extracting a new "creed" from his name
 unki samuhik maanavtaavaadi drushti sankeernata ke ghere main ja padi
 Thus from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century the Nana Panth came into existence one after the other
 sikhon ke aadi yug nanakdev ne nanakpanth, dadu dayaal ne dadupanth, kabirdaas ne kabirpanth, baawari ne baawaripanth, haridas ne niranjani sampradaay or malukadas ne malukapanth ko janm diya
 Later, Baba Lalji sect, Dhani sect, Saath sect, Dharniswari sect, Dariyadasi sect, Dariyapat, Shivnarayani sect, Garibpant, Ramasnehi sect, etc
 are credited to the saints who took the fast of Satyadarshan and philanthropists
 And later embraced parochialism
 jo sant nirgun brahm kii upasna kaa upadesh dete hue ram, krishna aadi ko saadhaaran manushya ke rup main dekhne ke agrahi the ve swayan hi apane aapako ram, krishna kii bhanti pujane lage
 The sampradayas created many different types of fables to prove their Adi Guru to be God or divine
 yahi kaaran he ki un sabhi nirguniye santon ke vrutt apane panth yaa sampradaay kii pitari main hi band hokar rah gaye
 Here, ever since the research work has gained strength in literature, they are discussed in certain pages of literature, they have no contact with the general public
 in sampradaayon main do ek sampradaay aise bhi dekh pade, jinhone apane jivan main bhakthi ko gaun kintu karm ko pradhanta di
 The Satnami sects raised the flag of rebellion against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb
 nanakpanth ke nawein guru shri govind singh ne apane sampradaay ko sena ke rup main parinam kar diya tha
 Later in this saint tradition, Radhaswami sect came into existence
 yah santaparampara raja rammohan raay, swami dayanand saraswati, swami ramtirth, tak chali ai he
 Mahatma Gandhi can be called the last link of this tradition
 jaisaa pehle kaha ja chukaa he, in sampradaayon or panthon ke bahusankhyak aadi guru ashikshit hi the
 Hence, they used to express their thoughts and feelings in verbal form
 shishymandal unhen yaad kar liya karata tha
 Later, the same preaching statements were transcribed by the disciples and became his scripture
 in kathanon evam vachanon ke sangrah main kahin kahin uttam or saamaanya kavy kii baangi bhi mil jaati he
 Therefore, there are certain saints among these poetical saints who, despite being mainly saints, are also poets, many of them have tried to overcome the lack of their classical education through polytheism, also in the field of philosophy, literature
 Not in the area
 inamen bahuton kaa sahitya ke swaroop se parichay tak nahin tha kintu unki anubhati kii tivrata kisi bhi bhavuk ke chitt ko prakrisht kar sati he
 Kabir is prominent among such saints

 Rabindranath Thakur presented an English translation of Kabir's Banias in harmony with Brahmasamaji ideas and was also influenced by his life
 kabir kii rachana mukhyat: saakhiyon or pardon main hui hai
 In this, his experiences have come in sharp form

 These are different from Geetovindakar Jaidev
 sadhana, trilochan, namdev, sen bhai, raidas, peepa, dhanna, nanakdev, amardaas, dharmadas, dadudayaal, bashana ji, baawari sahiba, garibadas, sundardaas, dariyaadas, dariyaa sahab, sahjo bai aadi is parampara ke pramukh sant hai

 That is why they have carved out words

 Because it became a religious language, even after fading away from the ordinary life of this language, it continued to be used to write new texts
 san 1500 isapurv ke yug kii keval do irani bhashaaon kii likhit rachanaayen mili hai
 There is an "ancient avastai" that was spoken in the northeast and an "ancient Persian" that was spoken in the southwest
 irani bhashaaon main yah purvi irani bhashaaon or pashchimi irani bhashaaon kaa ek bahut bada vibhaajan he
 There was only one "primitive indo-iranian language" at the beginning - all languages of the indo-iranian language family are born, including Sanskrit, Hindi, Kashmiri, Persian, Pashto
 pracheen avastai us yug kii bhashaa he jab purvi irani bhashaayen or vaidic sanskrit bahut milti-julati thim
 Some changes were taking place in the Western Iranian languages, due to which she was slightly different from Vedic Sanskrit
 kaha ja saktaa he ke pracheen avastai in donon ke bich thi - yah vaidic sanskrit se bahut milti-julati he or yah pracheen farsi se bhi milti julati he
 Compositions are less in Avastai language, so linguists seek first aid by studying Vedic Sanskrit to understand Avastai word-grammar as Avastai and Vedic Sanskrit have close links in this area

 In ancient times, people of Parsi community based in India also wrote Avastai in scripts based on Brahmi

 parinaam swaroop 1885 main alpaayu main hi mrityu ne unhen gras liya

 Shringar Ras Pradhanbharatendu ji has beautifully portrayed both the coincidence and disconnection aspects of Shringar

 That is why he is considered the father of modern Hindi
 keval bhashaa hi nahin, sahitya main unhone naveen aadhunik chetana kaa samavesh kiya or sahitya ko 'jan' se joda
 There is duplicity in Bharatendu's composition
 kavita jahaan ve braj bhashaa main likhte rahe, vahiin unhone baaki vidhaon main safal haath khadi boli main aajamaaya
 In the true sense, Bharatendu is the master of modern standing dialect prose

 He adopted the modified form of the Braj language, leaving out the obsolete words
 unki bhashaa main jahaan-tahaan urdu or angrezi ke prachlit shabd bhi jate hai
