 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main yah sankraman garbhpaat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai
 Of these six people, one was a pregnant woman, one had leukemia, one was suffering from Hodgkin disease and two were already healthy
 bhale hi yah pratyaksh maamle bahut kam lagen par vaastavik sankraman kii sahi dar isse kahin adhik ho sakati he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main yah saamaanya rog hi prathit hota he or is kaaran ise report hi nahin kiya jaataa
 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the
 The virus that came from Spanish flu was present in pigs
 iskaa sanchalan 20 veen sadi ke dauraan manushyon main bhi hua, yadhyapi yah varsh ke us samay hota he jab prativarsh hone vaali mahamariyaan failati hai, jisase 'saamaanya' influenza or shookar influenza main antar kar paanaa kathin he
 However, cases of infection from pigs to humans are rare and 12 cases have been reported in the US since 2005
 yahe == manushyon main shookar influenza yah shookar ke dwaara manushyon main failaa
 The disease spreads more in the cold
 din or raat kaa taapmaana yadi 25C se upar ho to iske vishaanu mar jate hai

 The development of future human beings depends on his proper upbringing and education
 at: manushya kii shiksha ko purna banane kii neenv shaishvavastha main hi pad jaani chahie
 Due to this, Shishuksha is given the most importance in today's era
 unnisvin shatabdi tak shishu ko shikshit karne kaa dhang bada hi kathor tha
 The teacher lacked sympathy for him
 shiksha main shaareerik dand kaa vidhaan pramukh tha
 The child also has a separate personality - he has his own needs, independent interests and aspirations - teacher's attention was not paid to it
 shishu saamaanya aparaadh par adhyaaapak kaa cruddh hona or use shaareerik dand dena swaabhaavik tha
 Parents also considered "dasavarshani Tadayet" as a Vedavakya and accepted the law of the punishment of the infant in education as a ploy

 Italy's famous female educationist Maria Montessori laid special emphasis on the cultivation of the Enlightenment which led to the beginning of a new era in infant-learning method and the education of the infant became mass-based
 prayek shishu kii pruthak ruchi evam maansik vikaas ke anuroop use shiksha dene kii vyavastha hui
 Mahatma Gandhi pioneered utilitarianism in child education and made a life-use business the basis of education, from which this education is called base education

 But the development of pediatric psychology has shown that each infant is different from the other
 at: uski shiksha dusron se pruthak dhang se honi chahie
 He should get opportunity to develop his innate powers and possibilities
 keval samuhik shiksha dene se uski bahut si shaktiyaan aviksit rah jaati hai
 Hence, the place of Balodyan is gradually being replaced by the Montessori method
 mantessori paddati ke mul aadhaar hai gyanendriyon kaa saadhan yaa vikaas tathaa shishu kii swatantraaa
 Through this method, children of three to six or seven years are made aware of the form, color, shape, etc
 of objects by a variety of educational instruments, apparatuses

 Without inspiration or punishment in education, the inspiration that comes from the environment is helpful in the development of the infant

 Therefore, having them in their course proves beneficial
 bacchon ke liye kavita evam sangeet ke mahatv ko shrimati mantessori bhi sweekaar karti hai
 Hence poems are taught to children in their schools - especially the nostalgic, rhythmic and actor poems
 prayaag geeton tathaa nrity ke saath chalanevaale geeton ko pradhanta di jaati he
 This means that in the current infant education system, by giving the child all kinds of freedom, full opportunity for soul-building is provided
 iske liye anukool vaataavaran evam upkaran prastut karnaa shikshak kaa mukhya kartavya hota he
 According to the above principles, the following requirements are required to be fulfilled for the proper dissemination of infant education - setting up of nurseries for children between two and six years and balodyan for children aged six to eleven years; Provision of refreshments and lunch in all the schools

 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Foreign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat and sell products at less than their normal price
 yah gharelu bazaar main samasyaayein paidaa kar saktaa he
 This makes it difficult for these markets to compete with the price set by the foreign market
 2009 main antarrashtriya vyapaar ayog ne damping virdohi kanoon par shodh shuru kiya he
 Dumping is often seen as an ethical issue and large companies are taking advantage of economically less advanced companies

 Both John Rawls and Robert Nozick have notable contributions to it
 vyavsaayik naitikta kii jaanch vibhinn pariprekshya main kii ja sakati he jisamen karmchaaree ke pariprekshya, vyavsaayik udhyam or puure samaaj ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Often a situation arises in which one or more parties have a conflict over welfare and loss of the other due to one

kuch naitiktaayen naitikta ke kshetra main mukhya bhoomika kaa nirvaah karti hui paraspar virdohi hiton ke bich saamanjasy sthapit kar unka samaadhaan prastut karti hai
 Philosophers and others do not agree with the objectives of business ethics in society
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch logon kaa suzav he ki vyavsaay kaa pramukh uddeshy apane maalikon athwa saarvajanik vyapaar company main apane shairdharakon ko adhiktam laabh dena hota he
 Thus, under this view, only those activities should be increased which would encourage profitability and shareholder value as any other function would be like a tax on profits
 Some believe that only those companies survive in a competitive market It is likely to remain, which above all considers growth in profit as paramount
 haalanki kuch kaa kahana he ki vyavsaay main kanoon ko maanane or buniyadi naitik niyamon kaa paalan karne main swayan kii ruchi honi chahie kyonki aisa nahin karne par jurmaana bharne, pratishtha main kami aane or company kii saakh ghatane jaise dushprinaam bhugatne padate hai
 Eminent economist Milton Freedman was a major supporter of this view
 kuch kaa rukh yah he ki sanghathanon main naitik agency banane kii kaabiliyat nahin hoti
unke anusaar vyakti ke aacharan main naitikta honi chahie naa ki vyavsaay yaa company main
 Other theorists argue that a business has a moral duty not to limit itself to serving the interests of its owner or stockholders and to not just follow the law
 They believe that a business has moral responsibilities Stakeholders, individuals interested in conducting the business, may also include employees, customers, vendors, local companies Right or a copy of the entire society
 hitdharakon ko bhi praathmik or madhyamik hitdharakon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Primary stakeholders are those who directly affect the stakeholders, whereas, secondary stakeholders are those who are not directly affected, such as the government
 They say that the stakeholders have some rights in relation to the operation of the business, whereas others
 They believe that they also have the right to rule

 The revival of contract theory in political philosophy became particularly popular later in its stance, a major contribution being John Ravels's 'A Theory of Justice' and the advent of a conscience-based approach to solving business problems
 The "quality movement" emerged in the 1980s
 Professors Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunphy proposed a version of contract theory for business, which they called Unified Social Contract Theory
 He has propounded that the best way to resolve conflicting interests is an impartial agreement between the two sides, which should co-ordinate these things: i) general principles, which all intellectuals agree on, and ii) general principles
 Formulation between interested parties by genuine agreements
 naitik mudde tab khadey hote hai jab companiyaan kanoonee yaa saanskrithik maamalon main paraspar virdohi maanak apanaati hai, jaisaa ki bahurashtriya companiyaan vibhinn deshon main alag-alag tareekon se kaam karti hai
 For example, the question arises whether a company should follow the laws of its own country or the laws of the developing country where it operates and where it has to follow less stringent laws? To illustrate this, the United States law prohibits companies in the matter of bribery, whether it is a country company or a foreigner, but in other parts of the world, bribery is an acceptable traditional way of doing business

 Sometimes it is claimed that Gresham's law of morality applies but good moral conduct excludes bad moral conduct
 yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki ek pratispardhi kaarobaari maahaul main log unheen companiyon ko jivit samajhate hai jinaki bhoomika adhiktam laabh arjeet karne kii rahati he
 As a more comprehensive compliance and ethics program, many companies have formulated policies relating to ethical conduct of employees in internal affairs
 yah nitiyon board main saamaanya sambodhan ke rup main ho sakati hai jinhen atyant samanyikrut bhashaa main prastut kiya jaataa he, athwa yah vistrut nitiyaan bhi ho sakati hai, jo vishesh vyavaharik aavashyaktaaon ho 
 ve aamtaur par shramikon kii company kii ummiido ko pahchaanane ke liye or vyapaar karne main pesh aa rahi kuch athwa adhik naitik samasyaon ko hal karne main maargdarshan dene ke liye hoti hai
 It is hoped that such a policy will create widespread moral awareness, stabilize their use and help to avoid moral disasters
 companiyon kii badhati sankhya ke saath-saath karmchaariyon kii bhi aavashyaktaa he jo kaarobaar sanchaalan se sambandhit seminar main hissaa len, jisamen aksar company kii nitiyon, vishesh maamle kaa adhyayan or kanoonee aavashyaktaaon kii charchaa hoti he
 Some companies even want their employees to sign an agreement that they will follow the company's rules of conduct
 kai companiyaan paryaavarniya karkon kaa akalan karti hai jo karmchaariyon ko aniatik aacharan main sanlagn kar sakate hai
 a competitive business environment can lead to unethical conduct
 jhooth bolne kii ummid vyapaar jaise kshetra main kii ja sakati he
 An example of this may be the immoral actions surrounding the Salomon Brothers
 har koi company kii nitiyon kaa samarthan karata he, jisase naitik aacharan sanchalit hota he
 Some claim that ethical problems may have a better basis for letting employees use their decisions
 anya logon kaa vishwaas he ki corrporate naitikta kii nitiyaan mukhya rup se upyogi chintaaon main nihit hai or ve mukhya rup se company ke kanoonee daayitv hai yaa ek bhala corrporate naagarik banakar uskaa dikhaava kar saarvajanik samarthan paaya ja saktaa he
 Ideally the company would like to avoid a lawsuit because its employees would follow the rules
 If there is a lawsuit, then the company can claim that this problem does not arise if the employees properly followed only the code
 kabhi-kabhi company kii naitikta ke code kaa sambandh company kii vaastavik prathaon se tut jaataa he
 Thus, this type of conduct is clearly adopted by management, which results in bad policies that create fraudulent policies, while it is one of the best marketing tools
 zyaadaatar nitikaar safal hone ke liye ek aachaar niti kaa suzav dete hai, jo is prakaar ho: Ethics officers were formally appointed by organizations in the mid-1980s
 is nayi bhoomika ek utprerak vah dhokhadhadi, bhrashtachar or durupyog se jude ghotaalon kii ek shrunkhlaa he jisase tatkaaleen samay main america kaa raksha udyog peedit tha
 This led to the formation of the Defense Industry Initiative, an initiative to promote and ensure ethical business practices in all industries
 DII ne armbh main companiyon ke liye naitikta prabandhan ke maanak tay kiye

sadsyta teji se badi or use jald hi ek swatantra sanghathan ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya
 Another important work ethic for companies was the decision to appoint a compliance / compliance officer, which required the approval of the Federal Penal Guidelines 1991 for organizations, which set the standard for an establishment that possessed federal felony convictions
 But had to apply for exemption in sentence

 In the wake of the scandals of many companies between 2001-04, even small and medium-sized companies began appointing ethics officers
 They often report to the CEO and to assess the ethical impact of the company's activities
 They are responsible for the company's ethical policies and provide information to employees
 ve vishesh rup se aniatik or avaidh kaary ko ujagar karne yaa un kaaryon ko rokane main ruchi rakhte hai
 This trend is partly due to the sarbanes-oxley Act of the USA, which was implemented in response to these scandals

 The influence of ethical executives in the market is not clear

 Only the establishment of monitoring of the state of ethics is insufficient to motivate ethical behavior, for that a systemic program with continuous support from the principal management is necessary
 naitik aacharan kii sthapana ek korporate samskruti or kisi nishchit company ke pare bhi sambhav he, jo kisi vyakti ke aarambhik naitik prashikshan par bahut nirbhar karata he, anya sansthaaen jo kisi vyakti ko prabhavit karti hai, vah he jis company main vah kaam karata he uskaa pratispardhi kaarobaari maahaul or vastav main puraa samaaj
 Religious views of historical and global importance on business ethics sometimes underestimate business ethics
 vishesh rup se asia or madhya purv main dharmik or saanskrithik pariprekshya ne vyavsaay ke aacharan par ek majboot prabhaav choda he or vyapaar mulyon kaa srijan kiya he
 Examples include: vyavsaayik naitikta ko vyavsaay ke darshan se pratishthit kiya janaa chahie, yah darshan kii vah shakha he, jiskaa sambandh vyavsaay or arthshaastra ke darshanik, rajnatik or naitik aadhaar se he
 Business ethics operates on the basis, for example, that ethical conduct is possible in a private business — people who have a dispute on grounds, such as libertarian socialists, have defined business ethics as going beyond the appropriate ideology
 kaarobaar kaa darshan bhi sawaalon se judaa hota hai jaise vyavsaay kii saamaajik jimmedaariyaan kya-kya hoti hai, vyavsaay prabandhan siddhant, vyaktvaad ke siddhant banaam samashtiwad; bazaar main pratibhaagiyon ke bich mukt ichha shakti, swa-hit kii bhoomika; adrishy haath siddhant, saamaajik nyaay kii aavashyaktaaon or prakritik adhikaar he, khaskar vyapaar udhyam ke sambandh main sampada adhikaar
 Business ethics also deals with political economy, which is economic analysis from a political and historical point of view

 He asks who benefits from economic activity and who has suffered, whether the result of distribution is justified or not, is a central moral issue

 Kinchello and Steinberg used many research and theoretical discourses for childhood studies based on different perspectives - historiography, ethnography, cognitive research, media studies, cultural studies, political economic analysis, hermeneutics, semiotics, content analysis, and so on

 Prior to kinderculture it was studied by some observers in the fields of psychology, education and to a lesser extent sociology and cultural studies that the knowledge explosion that characterized our contemporary era weakened traditional notions of childhood and early childhood education Has changed the field of

 The main purpose of kinderculture is to establish the changing historical status of childhood socially, culturally, politically and economically, and to specifically examine the methods that Kincheloe and Steinberg call "the new childhood", aided by diverse media

 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium
 is adhinium ne sarkaar ke ek nav pranali kii shuruuaat kii jise prantiy "dvishasan", ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, yani, kuch kshetron kii sarkaar ko prantiy vidhayika ke liye jimmedaar mantriyon ke haathon main rakhaa gaya jabaki anya ko british-niyukt prantiy governor ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ke haath main banaae rakhaa gaya
 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests
 is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke sansthaanon kii dhire-dhire bad rahi he bhartiyakaran ke chehre main, adhinium upyog ke liye nirnay or british niyukt vysarai ke haathon main suraksha upayon kii vaastavik prashasan or prantiy governron jo bharat ke liye rajya sachiv ke niyantran ke adheen tha
 'the vast powers and responsibilities that the Governor General must discipline according to his discretion or his personal decision, it is clear that he is expected to be like Superman
 uske paas vinamrata, saahas or kadi mehnat ke liye ek anant kshamta ke saath sampann hona chahie "hamane is bill main kai suraksha upayon ko daalaa he" sar robert horn ne kaha 


 "lekin ve saare suraksha upaay ek hi vyakti ke bare main vichaar karti he or vah he visarai he
 He is the lynch-pin of the entire system
 


 agar vysarai vifal hota he, kuch bhi aapke sthapit pranali ko bachaa nahin saktaa
 "this speech reflects the vision of the staunch Torridge who was frightened one day by the possibility of the Viceroy being appointed by the Labor Government
 adhinium ko thik se padhane se se pataa chalata he ki british sarkaar ne ise apane liye taiyaar kiya he, jab bhi unhen mahasoos hoga tab ve kisi bhi samay kanoonee upkaran ke saath is par puraa niyantran le sakate the
 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government 


 has presented a glimpse of responsible government
 lekin vaastaviktaa kaa abhaav he, maamle ke anusaar raksha or videshi maamalon main jaruri shaktiyon kii kami he, rajyapal general ko aavashyak taur mantri gatividhi ke liye seemaa pradaan kii gai he or bhartiya rajyon ke pratinidhitiv ke upaay ko nakaaratmak pradaan kiya gaya he or yahaan tak ki loktantric niyantran kii shuruyaat kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level
 i am on a climax
 " Lord Lothian, in a forty-five minute long conversation, gave his views about this bill: "main aatmasamarpan kiye hue kattaro ke saath sahamat hum
 ve jise kisi bhi samvidhan kii aadat nahin he unhen koun si mahaan shaktiyon kaa upyog karnaa he, mahasoos nahin kar sakate hai
 If you look at this constitution, it would seem that all the powers are vested in the Governor General and the Governor
 lekin yahaan puri shakti raja main nihit nahin he? raja ke naam par sab kuch kiya jaataa he, lekin kya raja usamen kabhi hastkshep karata he? ek baar satta vidhayika ke haathon main aa jaati he, rajyapal yaa governor general kabhi hastkshep nahin karte hai

 " Under the Act, UK resident British citizens and British companies registered in the UK should be treated like Indian nationals and companies registered in India unless UK law denies reciprocation
 is vyavastha kaa anauchity tab spasht hota he jab ek bhartiya aadhunik kshetra main british puunji kii sthiti ko adhik mahatv or sampoorn prabhutv diya jaataa he, anauchity vyavsaayik vyavastha ke madhyam se banaae rakhaa jaataa he, bharat ke anterrashtriya or tateey shipping yatayaat donon main britain ke shipping hiton or britain main bhartiya puunji ko bina mahatv ke nikaalnaa or britain ke bheetar shipping main bharatiyon ke gaiyr-maujuudagi hota he
 It requires a fairly elaborate provision for the Viceroy to intervene if, in his appeal-disqualified view, any Indian law or act demands, or indeed, discrimination against, British subjects resident in Britain, British registered companies and, in particular, British Shipping interests
 "sanyukt samiti ne ek suzav ko vichaaradhin kiya jiske tahat videshi deshon ke saath vyapaar kaa vaanijya mantri dwaara kiya janaa chahie, lekin yah tay he ki videshi deshon ke saath sabhi vaartaon videsh karyaalay yaa videsh mantralay vibhaag dwaara yojit kiya janaa chahie kyonki ve britain main hai
 In this form of compromise, the Foreign Secretary always consulted the Board of Trade and it was assumed that the Governor General would consult the Commerce Minister in India in a manner

 By 1935 a constitution established the Dominion of India, the British Indian provinces in which India may have been accepted although it would not pass the British Parliament

 In terms of political analysis, the governor could take total control of the provincial government under the supervision of the Viceroy

 haalanki, udaaravaadi or congress main bhi tatv kunkunepan ke saath ise jane ke liye taiyaar the: "linlithgow asked Sapru whether he thought the scheme of Act 1935 was a satisfactory option
 sapru ne kaha ki unhen adhinium ko teji se lagu karnaa chahie or sangheey yojana usamen sannihit he
 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect
 linlithgo kaaphi budhimaan, behad mehnatee, eemaandaar, gambhir or is adhinium ko safal banane ke liye drudh sankalp tha, haalanki vah bhi niras, aavegahin, vidhi sammat tha or apane tatkaal cirkil ke baahar logon ke saath "sharton ko lagu karnaa" bahut mushkil mahasoos kiya
