 It can also be said that software testing is the process that validates and verifies that a software program / application / product: karyrat pareekshan paddati ke aadhaar par, software pareekshan ko vikaas kii prakriya main kisi bhi samay lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 However, most test attempts begin when the requirements have been defined and the coding process is complete

 In a more traditional model, most testing efforts begin when the requirements have been defined and the coding process is complete
 apekshaakrit nae vikaas model, jaise Agile yaa XP, aksar vikaas sanchalit pareekshan kaa prayog karte hai or vikaas kii prakriya main pareekshan kaa zyada hissaa, develper ko saunpte hai
 Testing cannot identify all defects within the software as a whole
 iske bajaay, yah ek aalochana yaa tulana prastut karata he, jo pramanik- siddhant yaa vyavastha ke prati, jiske dwaara ek vyakti kisi samasya ko pahchaan saktaa he - utpaada kii sthiti or vyavhaar kii tulana karata he
 These authentications may include specifications, contracts, comparable products, previous versions of the same product, estimates of intended or expected objectives, user or customer expectations, appropriate standards, usability rules, or other criteria
 har software utpaada ke lakshith darshak hote hai
 For example, the viewer of video game software is completely different from banking software
 isliye, jab ek sanghathan kisi software utpaada ko viksit athwa usamen nivesh karata he, to vah yah akalan kar saktaa he ki software utpaada apane antim upyogkartaaon, apane lakshith darshakon, apane kharidaaron or anya hitdharakon ko sweekaarya hoga yaa nahin
 Software testing is the process of attempting this evaluation

 Although their focus was on breakage testing it confirmed the software engineering community's desire to separate basic development activities, such as debugging, from verification
 dev gelprin or wiliam si
 hetzel ne 1988 main software pareekshan main pravasthaon or lakshyon ko nimnlikhit charnon main vargeekrut kiya he: a primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures, so that faults can be discovered and corrected
 yah ek gaiyr-naganya khoj he
 Testing cannot establish that a product is working properly under all conditions, but can only establish that it does not work properly under what specific conditions

 In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may differ from the development team
 pareekshan dal ke sadasyon ke liye vibhinn bhoomikaayen hotin hai
 Information obtained from software testing can be used to correct the process by which software is developed
 functional pareekshan us pareekshan se sambandh rakhata he, jo code kii ek vishisht karrwai yaa prakaarya ko satyapit karata he
 This is usually found in the documentation of code requirements, although some development processes, use cases or user reports work
 functional test is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai ki "kya upyogkarta ise kar saktaa he" yaa "kya yah vishesh suvidha kaam karti he"
 Non-functional testing refers to aspects of software that may not be related to a particular function or user action, such as mounting or security
 Non-functional testing answers questions such as "how many people can log in at once", or "how easy it is to hack this software"
 software ke sabhi dosha, code kii trutiyon ke kaaran nahin hote hai
 a common source of costly faults arises due to the expectation interval, for example, unrecognized expectations, which result in deletion errors by the program designer
 apeksha interval kaa ek aam strot, gair-kaaryaatmak apeksha he, jaise pareekshan-kshamta, arohan-kshamta, anurakshan-kshamta, upyog-kshamta, nishpaadan or suraksha
 Software defects occur through the following processes
 programmer ek truti karata he, jo software ke sorce code main ek karaabi main falit hota he
 If this malfunction is performed, in some special cases the system will produce an erroneous result, which will cause a failure
 sabhi dosha aavashyak rup se vifaltaa main parinat nahin honge
 Defects in dead code, for example, will never result in failure
 jab parivesh badla jaataa he, tab ek karaabi vifaltaa main badal sakati he
 Examples of these environmental changes include running the software on a new hardware platform, changing source data, or interacting with different software
 a single error may result in extended symptoms of failure
 aam taur par yah mana jaataa he ki ek karaabi ko jitna pehle khoja jaae, use thik karnaa utana hi sasta hota he
 The following table shows the cost of fixing the malfunction, based on the stage of detection
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi apekshaaon main koi samasya sirf release ke baad saamne aati he, to iskaa kharchaa apekshaaon kii samiksha dwaara hi pataa laga liye jane ke kharche se 10-100 guna adhik hoga
 a common cause of software failure is compatibility with other applications, a new operating system, or, a growing web browser version
 pasch sangatta kii kami ke maamle main, yah isliye ho saktaa he, kyonki programmer ne apane program kii koding yaa software kaa pareekshan sirf, is-or-us oparating system "ke naveenatam sanskaran" par karne kaa vichaar kiya
 An unintended consequence of this fact is that: their latest work may not be fully compatible with the prior mix of software / hardware, or it may not be fully compatible with another important operating system
 kisi bhi sthiti main, ye matbhed, ve jo bhi hon, software vifaltaa main parinat hue honge, jaisaa ki computer prayoktaaon ke kuch mahatvapurn tabake ne mahasoos kiya
 One might consider this to be a "security-oriented strategy" that fits precisely with the latest testing phase suggested by Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel, as cited below
 
 a major problem with software testing is that testing is not possible under all combinations of input and pre-conditions, even with a common product
 iskaa matlab he ki software utpaada main dosha kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati hai or jo dosha kabhi-kabhi hote hai unhen pareekshan main khojna mushkil he
 More importantly, non-functional dimensions of quality - usability, mountability, performance, compatibility, reliability - can be highly subjective; Something that constitutes sufficient value for one person, unbearable for another
 software pareekshan ke liye kai drushtikon hai
 Review, cross-over, or inspection is considered static testing, while the actual executed program code with a given set of test cases is considered a dynamic test
 static pareekshan ko choda ja saktaa he
 Dynamic testing is used when the program itself is being used for the first time
 dinemic pareekshan, program ke 100% purna hone se pehle code ke vishesh hisson ke pareekshan ke liye shuru ho sakati he 
 Typical techniques for this are using stubs / drivers or execution from a debugger environment
 For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, mutually tested to a large extent, under which results are displayed immediately after each calculation or text operation
 software pareekshan kaa prayog satyaapan or pramanikaran ke saahchary se kiya jaataa he: The term verification and authentication are commonly used interchangeably in industry; It is also common to misinterpret these two words
 IEEE software ejineering kii maanak shabdaawalee ke anusaar: Software testing can be done by a software tester
 1980 ke dashak tak shabd "software tester" ko aam taur par istemaal kiya jaataa tha, lekin baad main ise ek alag vyavsaay ke rup main dekha gaya
 Various roles related to periods and different goals have been established in software testing: Manager, Test Lead, Test Designer, Tester, Automation Developer and Test Administrator haalanki vivaadaaspad, software pareekshan ko software quality ashurence prakriya ke ek mahatvapurn hisse ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 At SQA, software process specialists and auditors have a comprehensive view on software and its development
 ve software ejineering prakriya kii jaanch karte hai or pradutt software main maujuud dosha: tathakthith dosha dar kii maatra ko kam karne ke liye use hi badal dete hai
 What constitutes an "acceptable defect rate" depends on the nature of the software
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek arched video game main, jise ek hawaii jahaaj udaane kaa abhas dene ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, sambhawatah dosha ke prati apekshaakrit adhik sahansheeltaa hogi, us mishan critical software kii tulana main, jiskaa upyog ek airliner ko niyantrit karne main hota he, jo vastav main ud rahaa he
 Although there are close associations with SQA, testing departments often operate independently and may not have SQA functions in a company
 software pareekshan, ek computer program ke apekshit parinaamon ko, die gaye ek input set ke liye, iske vaastavik parinaamon se tulana karte hue, software main dosha kaa pataa lagane ke uddeshy se kiya gaya kaary he
 Paradoxically, QA is the implementation of policies and procedures aimed at preventing errors from occurring
 software pareekshan tareeqon ko paramparaagat rup se blike box pareekshan or white box pareekshan main vibhajit kiya gaya hai
 Both of these approaches are used to describe the approach that a test engineer adopts for designing test cases
 blike box pareekshan, software se ek "blike box" ke rup main vyavhaar karata he - bina kisi aantarik karyanvayan kii jaankaree ke blike box pareekshan tareekon main shaamil hai: equivelens partishning, boundry vailu enelysis, ol peyars pareekshan, faj pareekshan, model-besd pareekshan, tresebility metrics, exploretary pareekshan or spacification-aadhaarit pareekshan
 Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of "an unsympathetic opinion" on the one hand and a "blind search" on the other
 white box pareekshan tab hoti he jab pareekshak ke paas, aantarik data sanrachanaon or ise lagu karne vaale code sahit elgoridam tak pahunch sulabh hoti he
 They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage
 grey box pareekshan main shaamil he aantarik data sanrachanaon or elgoridam tak, pareekshan maamalon ko dizin karne ke liye pahunch, lekin upyogkarta, yaa blike box str par pareekshan
 input data kaa parivartan or output ko formet karnaa, grey box ke tahat nahin aata, kyonki input or output us "blike-box" se spasht rup se baahar he, jise ham pareekshan ke tahat system kah rahe hai
 This difference is particularly important when performing integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interface is presented for testing
 haalanki, ek data bhandar ko sanshodhit karnaa zarur grey box ke antargat aata he, chunki aam taur par upyogkarta pareekshan ke tahat system ke baahar data badalane main sakasham nahin hoga
 Gray box testing may also include reverse engineering, for example, to determine the bounding value or error message
 pareekshanon ko aksar, software vikaas prakriya main unke shaamil hone kii jagah ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, yaa pareekshan kii vishistataa ke str dwaara
 Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a particular section of code, usually at the process level
 ek object-unmukh parivesh main, yah aksar shrenee str par hota he or nunatam ikai pareekshan main shaamil hota he constructor or distractor
 These types of tests are typically written by developers when they are working on code to ensure that a particular process is working properly as expected
 code main corner caces yaa anya shakhaon ko pakadaney ke liye, ek prakriya main kai pareekshan ho sakate hai
 Unit testing, alone, cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but is used to ensure that the building blocks used by the software function independently of each other
 integration pareekshan kisi bhi prakaar kaa software pareekshan he, jo ek software dizin ke prati ghatakon ke bich interphes ko satyapit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Software components can be integrated iteratively or together
 aam taur par pehle vaale tareeqe ko ek behatar abhyaas mana jaataa he, chunki yah interfes muddon ko twarit rup se sthaneey hone or thik hone kii anumati detaa he
 Integration testing works to expose errors in interfaces and to show interactions between integrated components
 uttarottar, architektural dizin ke tatwon ke anuroop jaanche gaye software ghatakon ke bade samoohon ko ekikrut or tab tak jaancha jaataa he, jab tak software ek system ke rup main kaam naa karne lage
 System testing tests a fully integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements
 system integration pareekshan yah pushti karata he ki ek system, system aavashyaktaaon main paribhaashit kisi bhi bahari yaa anya paksh ke system se ekikrut he
 Regression testing focuses on finding faults after a major code change
 vishesh rup se, yah software pratigaman ko yaa puraane bag jo waapas aa gaye hai, unhen ujagar karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Such regressions occur whenever the software process, which was previously working correctly and now stops working as expected
 vishisht rup se, pratigaman, program parivartan ke ek anpekshit parinaam ke rup main ghatit hote hai, jab software kaa nav viksit hissaa, pehle se maujuud code ke saath takaraata he
 Common methods of regression testing include replaying previously run tests and checking if previously corrected errors have reappeared
 pareekshan kii gaharaai, jari prakriya main charan par nirbhar karti he or atirikt visheshtaon ke jokhim par
 ve yaa to purna ho sakate hai, release main kaaphi der se jode gaye parivartanon ke liye yaa phir jokhim bhare, bahut uthle tak, prayek suvidha par sakaaratmak pareekshan se bane hue, agar badlaav, relies main jaldi ho rahe hai yaa kam jokhim vaale samajhe jate hai
 Acceptance testing can refer to one of two: alpha pareekshan, sambhavit upyogkartaaon / graahakon yaa develper kii site par ek swatantra test team dwaara nakli yaa vaastavik sanchaalan pareekshan he
 Before the software went into beta testing, alpha testing is often used as a form of internal acceptance testing for off-the-shelf software
 beta pareekshan alpha pareekshan ke baad aata he
 The software version, known as the beta version, was released to a limited clientele outside the programming team
 software ko logon ke samoohon ke liye jari kiya jaataa he, taaki aage ke pareekshan yah sunishchit kar saken ki utpaada main nunatam kharabiyaan yaa bag hai
 Sometimes, the beta version is made available to the open public to increase the response area to the maximum number of prospective users
 software ke gair-kaaryaatmak pahaluon ke pareekshan ke liye vishesh tareeqe maujuud hai
 Unlike functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of software, non-functional testing confirms that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected input
 software folt injection, fajing ke rup main, ek gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan kaa udhaaharan he
 Non-functional testing, specifically for the sake of software, is designed to establish whether the construct under the test can tolerate invalid or unexpected input and thus the input validation routine as well as the error - Will be able to establish the strength of the handling routine
 vibhinn vanijyik gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan upkaran, software folt injection prishth se jude hote hai; kai khule strot ke or muft software upkaran uplabdh hai, jo gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan karte hai
 Performance testing, or load testing, checks to see if the software can handle large amounts of data or users
 aam taur par ise software scalebility ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as a capability test
 sthaitv pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software ek sweekaarya avadhi main yaa usase upar, lagaataar acchhee tarah se kaary karata saktaa he yaa nahin
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load testing
 prayojyata pareekshan kii jarurat yah jaanchane ke liye hoti he ki yuzar interfes kaa upyog karnaa or use samajhnaa aasaan he yaa nahin
 Security testing is required for software that refines confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers
 anterrashtriyakaran or sthaniyakaran kii jarurat software ke in pahaluon kii jaanch ke liye hoti he, jiske liye ek chhadmasthaniyakaran vidhi kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This will confirm that the application works even after being translated into a new language or adapted to a new culture
 vinaashak pareekshan, software yaa up-pranali ko isaki majbootee ke jaanch ke liye, vifal karne kaa prayaas karti he
 a common method of software testing is performed by an independent group of testers, before it is sent to the client and after its functionality is developed
 is abhyaas ke parinamswaroop aksar pareekshan charan kaa, pariyojna main hui deree kii kshatipurti ke liye pariyojna bafer ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he or is prakaar se pareekshan ke liye samarpit samay ke saath samjhauta hota he
 Another practice is to start software testing from the moment the project starts and it is a continuous process till the completion of the project
 jawaab main, kuch aise ubharate software vishay jaise extream programing or azeil software development andolan, ek "test driven software development" model kaa paalan karte hai
 In this process, unit tests are first written by the software engineer
 Of course these tests initially fail; As expected from them
 or phir jaise hi code likhaa jaataa he yah pareekshan sweet ke bade ansh ke sanwarddhit rup se gujarata he
 Test suites are constantly renewed and integrated with any developed regression test due to new failure conditions and corner cases
 baaki software sorce code ke saath unit test ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he or aam taur par bild prakriya main ekikrut kiya jaataa he 
 Although variation exists between organizations, there is a specific cycle for testing
 nimna namoona, water fall deveopment model ko apnaane vaale sanghathanon ke bich aam he
 Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially such groups that use jotest driven development
 test likhane ke kai fremawork hai or satat ekikaran software, pareekshan ko swatah chalaaegaa, jab har baar code ek varjan control system main parkhaa jayega
 While automation cannot build everything that a human can, it can be very useful for regression testing
 tathaapi, vastav main upyogi hone ke liye, isamen script pareekshan kii ek purna viksit test sweet kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Program testing and fault detection can be greatly assisted by test equipment and debuggers
 pareekshan / dibg upkarnon kii visheshtaon main shaamil hai: Some of these properties can be incorporated into an integrated development environment
 aam taur par, jin vishyon tak gunvattta simit hoti he, ve hai shuddhta, sampoornataa, suraksha, lekin ISO maanak ISO 9126 ke tahat varnit adhik takneekee aavashyaktaaen bhi shaamil ho sakati hai, jaise kshamta, vishwasaneeyata, dakshata, suvahyata, rakh-rakhaav, sangatta or 0}prayojyata
 Several common software measures exist, often called 'metrics', which are used to measure the software's condition or test adequacy
 software pareekshan prakriya kai artiffact ko utpann kar sakati he
 Several certification programs exist to bolster the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists

 kuch asut sharaab jaise ram or bijeeu main heads or tels ko nahin hataaya jaataa taaki iskaa adwitiya swaad or mukh-sukh bana rahe
 Whether repeated limits of distillation by statutory authority determine the extent of its hardness or not, its ethanol levels will rise higher than is acceptable to users

 Initially, only gas powered devices were made, but now some years electric powered refrigerators have become popular
 aajkal sab prakaar ke prashithitron kii almariyaan dekhne main ek si hi lagati hai
 They are coated with a layer of porcelain and a thick effluent coating on the outside
 bhinn bhinn maadlon kii keemat ke anusaar prashithitr kii deevaaron main laga ooshmaarodhak 2 se 4 inch tak motaa hota he
 The thicker the insulator, the more effective it will be, because the heat of most of the atmosphere is passed through the walls into the food
 prayek prashithitr main rakhe khadyapadartho ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam kisi prasheetak madhyam kii bhautik dasha main parivartan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, a good refrigerant must have the following qualities: ammonia gas, sulfur doiaksaide, carbon dioxide, dychlor-dyphlor-mithen pramukh gaisen hai, jinka upyog prashithan main hota he
 The principle of refrigerators operated only by ice and by the device is virtually the same, because in both of them the heat of the food is only absorbed by the physical change of the medium
 pehle main to barf pighalkar pani ban jaataa he, or duusare main prasheetak drav, yantra ke dwaara gas se parinat ho jaataa he
 Multifunctional refrigerators are made in such a way that air is transported from the underside of the ice blocks and the ice is at fault
 at: jab tak khaadya kaksh band rahata he uskaa taap 60 se 80 ke bich rahata he, chaahe barf kii silli kitni hi patali ho jaae
 Thus a sill lasts for 4-5 days
 svachlit prakaar ke yantric prashithitr do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sampeden ke siddhant par ore duusare avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale
 In the closed systems of these two, the refrigerant-medium keeps transporting

 There is also a heating instrument called by which the temperature of the food can be controlled
 sampeden ke siddhant par chalanevaale prasheetak yantron main athwa ashwashakti kii motor, yantra ke kriyachakra kaa aarambh karne ke liye lagaai jaati he, jiske dwaara sulfur dioxide athwa dochlordiflor mithen ke jaise gasiy prasheetak-madhyam vaashpitra main se sanghanan kundaliyon main prerit kiye jate hai
 Then one of these passes through the special valve and returns to the evaporator
 ye kapaat bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is the diffusion valve, by which the condensed refrigerant enters the evaporator, disintegrating as a fine spray and causing it to form, in part, the vapor
 duusare prakaar kaa plav kapaat he, jo vaashpitra ke bheetar kaaphi maatra main prasheetak-drav ikattha hone par apana kaam karata he or tabhi kriyachakra kaa punaravartan hota he
 In refrigerators operating on the principle of absorption, ammonia gas easily dissolves in cold water and also escapes easily when the water is heated
 at: pani ko garam karne ke liye tel yaa gas kii jwaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When separated from the water, the ammonia gas is liquefied in the condensation coils and flows into the evaporator, where the pressure of the condenser through hydrogen is reduced so much that the liquid starts evaporating again
 phir, vaashpitra se hydrogen or ammonia gas kaa mishran avasorak prakoshth main jyonhi pahunchataa he, usamen pani kii ek baarik phuhaar milti he
 This causes the ammonia gas to dissolve in water and return to the insoluble hydrogen vapor in water
 idhar ammonium hydroxide vashpajanitr main aakar kriyachakra ko pun: chaalu kar detaa he
 Due to the constant exchange of heat and coolness in this type of device, its design becomes very complicated, but the functionality of the device remains good

 The songs of his plays like 'himadri Tung Shring Se', 'arun Yeh Madhumay Desh Hamara' have been well known
 inke naatakon par abhinaeya na hone kaa aarope he
 The objection seems to be that they are not written according to the theater, which is attributed to their predominance of poeticity, the elaboration of personal statements, the interplay of singing and the flawed combination of visuals

 His plays have ancient antiquities and juicy Indian traditions, as well as a new path taken by the use of the dramatic craftsmanship of Parsi drama companies, Bengali and Bharatendeugan plays Away Shakespeare

 naatakon main itihaas ke aadhaar par vartmaan samasyaon ke samaadhaan kaa maarg prastut karte hue ve milte hai
 But the critical poetic vision with serious thought is at the core of their solution

 Philosophy in plays has a multiplicity of philosophies but it is succulent rather than proselytizing
 unhone kuch naatakon main swagat kaa bhi prayog kiya he kintu aise naatak keval chaar hai
 Believing in the Indian Natya tradition, he presented the play as 'kamna'
 ye naatak prabhaav kii ekta laane main purna safal hai
 Despite his few flaws, Prasad ji is unique in Hindi as a playwright

 do kos kii yatra ke baad uski gaadi kaa ek pahiyaa tut gaya
 From there both started the journey on foot
 On the way, when the wife is thirsty, the moneylender sits under a tree and goes to get water
 thodi der baad jab wo kahin se jal lekar waapas aayaa to vah buree tarah hairaan ho uthaa, kyonki uski patni ke paas uski hi shakl-surat kaa ek doosraa vyakti baitha tha
 The wife was also surprised to see the moneylender
 vah donon main koi antar nahin kar pai
 sahukaar ne us vyakti se poocha- tum koun ho or meri patni ke paas kyon baithe ho
 sahukaar kii baat sunakar us vyakti ne kaha- are bhai, yah meri patni he
 i have brought my wife away from her in-laws, but who are you who are questioning me like this? This is my wife
 main ise ped ke neeche baitaakar jal lene gaya tha
 On this, the person said- Oh brother, you are telling lies
 i went to get water when my wife was thirsty
 main to jal laakar apni patni ko pilaa bhi diya he
 Now you should not walk quietly from here or else you will call a soldier and catch you
 Both of them started fighting with each other
 Seeing them fighting, many people gathered there

 The wife also could not recognize her real husband from both of them
 raja ne un donon ko karagaar main daal dene ko kaha
 raja ke faisle ko sunakar asli sahukaar bhaybheet ho uthaa
 tabhi akashwani hui- sahukaar tuune mata-pita kii baat nahin maani or buudhvaar ke din apni sasuraal se prasthaan kiya
 All this is happening due to the wrath of Lord Buddha
 sahukaar ne bhagwaan budhdev se prarthana kii ki he bhagwaan budhdev mujhe kshamaa kar dijie
 mujhase bahut badi galati hui
 bhavishya main ab kabhi buudhvaar ke din yatra nahin karuunga or sadaiv buudhvaar ko aapkaa vrath kiya karuunga
 sahukaar kii prarthana se prasann hokar bhagwaan budhdev ne use kshamaa kar diya
 tabhi doosraa vyakti raja ke saamne se gaayab ho gaya
 The king and others were surprised to see this miracle
 bhagwaan budhdev kii anukampaa se raja ne sahukaar or uski patni ko sammanpurvak vidaa kiya
 On walking some distance, they found a bullock cart on the way
 baiylgaadee kaa tutaa hua pahiyaa bhi judaa hua tha
 Both of them sat in it and walked towards the city
 Both the moneylender and his wife began to live happily on Wednesday
 Due to the blessings of Lord Buddha, wealth and wealth started to rain in his house
 Soon there was happiness in his life
