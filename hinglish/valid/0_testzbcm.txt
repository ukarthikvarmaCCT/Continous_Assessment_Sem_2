 Fielding in the game of cricket is the art or mode where the fielder stops the ball struck by the batsman to save the run, catches him in the air to get the batsman out, or the batsman tries to run out
 'kshetrarakshak apane sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag se gend roak saktaa he
 But if he deliberately uses hat or any other thing to stop the ball, then the opposing team has to give 5 runs as penalty
 shart keval yah he ki ballebaaj ne gend ko balle se khilne kaa prayaas kiya ho naa ki use jane dene kaa
 kshetrarakshan ke adhiktar niyam cricket kanoonon kii dhara 41 main paribhaashit hai
 In the beginning of Test cricket fielding was not much attention, so most of the fielders were ordinary
 ek divasiy cricket ke aane se is kala main bahut sudhaar hua kyonki ran bachaana atyant mahatvapurn ho gaya tha
 a good fielder team can save up to 30 runs in a day
 team ke 11 kshetrarakshakon main se ek wicket keeper hota he or ek gendbaaj, tathaa anya 9 kahin bhi rakshan kar sakate hai
 Which places will be filled, which vacancies depends on the captain
 apane sahyogiyon se paraamarsh karke captain kabhi bhi rakshan sthaan badal saktaa he
 This is prohibited only during the ball throwing process
 cricket main kai kshetrarakshak sthaan niyat hai, jinamein se kuch kaa prayog saamaanya taur par kiya jaataa he jabaki anya kaa prayog kabhi-kabhaar hi kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a stone streak and there are other places other than this
 adhiktar kshetrarakshak sthaan ballebaaj ko kendra maan kar namit kiye gayi hai
 For example, words like cover, mid wicket and leg describe the direction and angle of the batsman from the defender
 saath hi inke purv lagane vaale shabd jaise long, sili, deep tathaa short ballebaaj se rakshak kii duuri bataate hai
 Using the words backward and forward, the preservation locations are better assigned
 chitra main aam prayog kii rakshan avasthaaon ko chinhit kiya gaya he uske baayin ore kii disha leg said yaa on said kehalaati he tathaa daayin ore of said 
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye yah vyavastha iske bilkul vipareet ho jaati he
 Some protection locations are known for extreme protection, such as slip
 The goal of the slip is to grab the 'edge' coming out of the corner of the batsman's bat
 anya ugr rakshan sthaan hai fli slip, gali, leg gali, leg slip tathaa short va sili sthaan
 iske atirikt bat pad vah rakshan avasthaa he jahaan gend bat or phir pad se lag kar ek meter ke andar hi girti he or vahaan khadaa rakshak use lapak letaa he
 All these positions are aimed not to stop runs but to get out
 anya pramukh kshetrarakshan sthanon main shaamil hai: Additionally, it is important that the bowler does not hit the pitch while throwing the ball
 Generally bowlers come up to silly mid off or silly mid on
 iske alaava camentataron ko anya shabd prayog karte bhi suna gaya he, jaise saamaanya gali se thodaa wide, athwa mid of se thodaa deep, use thodaa short aana chahie ityadi
 The fielder can be placed anywhere, as long as he follows the following rules
 At the time of throwing the ball: in niyamon main se kisi kaa bhi ullanghan hone par ampaire no bol qaraar de saktaa he
 No player should move until the ball reaches the striker from the bowler's hand, otherwise a dead ball is given
 ballebaaj ke nikat khadey khilaadi bhi lesh maatr hi hill sakate hai
 Yes, players standing at the boundary can come towards the pitch when the ball is thrown, but going towards the boundary is prohibited
 wicket keeper va gendbaaj ke alaava anya 9 rakshak kahaan tainaat honge yah captain ke liye ek atyant mahatvapurn samrik nirnay hota he
 It is very important for a captain to be able to create a perfect synergy between both attack and defense
 In aggressive fielding, the defenders are placed close to the batsman so that more catches can be caught
 For example, slip and short leg are aggressive fielding places
 rakshaatmak niti main rakshak dur seemaa par khadey rah kar ran bachaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Many situations affect fielding, such as match conditions, the bowler's skill, whether the batsman is new or frozen, the condition of the ball, the condition of the pitch, lights and the rest of the game
 kuch saamaanya siddhant: Where to field 9 players is an important decision for the captain
 yah sankhya donon ore ek si nahin ho sakati
 In the commentary, when '5-4 field' is said, it means 5 towards fielder off and 4 towards leg
 aam taur par of kii ore adhik kshetrarakshak rakhe jate hai kyonki adhiktar gendbaaj of stump par hi gend karte hai or vahiin zyaada shaat jate hai
 There can be 3 to 4 slips and 2 gully in case of abundant attack
 yani of par 9 me se 6 rakshak
 saath rahete hai mid on, mid wicket tathaa fin leg, yani 7-2 kii field
 leg kii ore lage donon rakshak adhiktar khaali rahete hai kyonki gendbaaji of stump par kendrit rahati he or adhiktar shaat bhi usee ore jate hai
 This attack structure forces the batsman to hit the empty positions towards the leg, which increases his chances of getting out
 jaise jaise match aage jaataa he, sanrachana fir 5-4 yaa 6-4 kii ho sakati he
 And the guards can leave the slip and lane and go to the far border
 duusari ore leg spinner adhiktar 4-5 kii sanrachanase kaam karte hai kyonki unka akraman leg stump par kendrit hota he
 Through this, he tries to catch in leg direction, out from behind legs and stump out
 kuch khaas maukon par 2-7 kii sanrachana kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 All bowlers keep the ball on the leg stump and the batsman has to take a threat to score runs
 leg stump ke baahar aakar shot khelen par stump puure dikhne lagate hai
 Playing reverse sweep or bridge and changing hands is also very dangerous
 iske vipareet 7-2 kii sanrachana main akraman of stump par rakhaa jaataa he
 The batsman either lets the ball go or takes the threat in an attempt to play the shot in the leg direction
 ek anya aakraamak sanrachana main leg kii ore seemaa par rakshak tainaat kar bounsar phenke jate hai
 The batsman catches in an attempt to hook or pull
 dhimi gati gend ke liye isamen rakshak 10-15 meter aage khadey kiye jate hai taaki leg glans tathaa sweep shot roke ja saken
 Except for the wicket-keeper, no other member of the fielding side can wear gloves or an external leg guard
 However fielders may wear shin protectors, groin protectors and chest protectors within their clothing
 wicket keeper ke atirikt koi anya kshetrarakshak haath yaa ungaliyon kii suraksha vaale upkaran tabhi pahan sakate hai jab ampaire iske liye sahamat ho
 Fielders are allowed to wear helmets and faceguards
 inhen saamanyat: sili point yaa sili mid wicket kii sthiti main pahana jaataa he, jahaan kshetrarakshak ko ballebaaj ke najadik hone kii vajah se itnaa samay nahin mil paata ki vah sidhe sir par lagane vaale gend se batch sake

 Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century
 is champu ke saat uchhvaason main nal tathaa damayanti kii vikhyath pranaykatha kaa bada hi chamatkaari varnan kiya gaya he
 In poetry, the Prasad of Shubhasa Sambhava Shlasa is targeted everywhere
 jain kavi somprabhasuri kaa "yashastilak champu" dasham shatee ke madhyakaal kii kriti he 
 The philosopher Rashtrakutnaresh was the synagogue of the son of Krishna's feudatory Chalukya Arikeshri
 is champu main jain puraanon main prakhyat raja yashodhar kaa charitra vistaar ke saath varnit he
 In the last three abuses of Champu by presenting a detailed account of the principles of Jainism, the poet has sufficiently propagated these principles
 granth main us yug ke naanavidh dharmik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik vishyon kaa vivaran somprabhasuri kii vyapak tathaa bahumukhi vandushi kaa parichaayak he
 Rama and Krishna
 aise champu kaavyon main bhojraj kaa ramayana champu, anantbhatta kaa "bharat champu", shesh shrikrishna kaa "parijataharan champu" kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Bhojraj had composed the Ramayana Champu till the Kishkindha scandal, which was completed by Lakshman Bhatt, "yudh Kand" and Venkatraj composed the "uttara Kanda"

 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka
 is bhavishya vaani ko sunakar raja shuddhodan ne apni yogyata kii had tak siddharth ko sadhu na banane dene kii bahut koshishen kii
 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat

 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha
 unka pahila dharmopadesh varanasi ke paas sarnath me tha
 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa
 Tripitaka is the main text of Buddhism
 yah palibhasha main likhaa gaya he
 This book is the biggest effort to formulate the teachings given by the Buddha after the consecration of the Buddha

 teachings to his followers
 tathagat buddha kaa pehla dharmopadesh, jo unhone apane saath ke kuch saadhuon ko diya tha, in chaar arya satyon ke bare main tha
 Buddha has told the four non-truths
 is duniya main dukh he
 There is sorrow in birth, in old age, in sickness, in death, in getting away from loved ones, in things with dislike, in not getting desire, in everything
 trishna, yaa chahat, dukh kaa kaaran he or fir se sasharir karke sansar ko jari rakhti he
 Freedom from craving can be found
 trishna se mukti ashtangik maarg ke anusaar jeene se pai ja sakati he
 Template: Main: Octagonal route buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4
 samyak karm : hanikaarak karmon ko na karnaa 5
 samyak jeevika : koi bhi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se hanikaarak vyapaar na karnaa 6
 samyak prayaas : apane aap sudharne kii koshish karnaa 7
 samyak smriti : spasht gyaan se dekhne kii maansik yogyata paane kii koshish karnaa 8
 samyak samadhi : nirvana paanaa or swayan kaa gaayab hona Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi
 mana jaataa he ki bodhi paane ke baad hi sansar se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation
 is duniya main sab kuch kshanik he or nashwar he
 Nothing permanent
 parantu vaidic mat se virodh he
 The soul means 'I'

 isliye, 'mai'arthath aatma naam kii koi sthaayee chiz nahin
 What people consider to be a soul is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness
 aatma kaa sthaan man ne liya he
 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he
 Ishwara or Mahabrahma does not create the universe because the world operates on the rule of Pratyatmasutpad i
e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable
 shoonyata mahayan buddha sampradaay kaa pradhan darshan he
 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism

 buddha bananaa hi bodhisattva ke jivan kii paraakaashtha he
 This identity is named Bodhi

 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva
 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"
 buddha dharm ke anuyaayi ashtangik maarg par chalakar na ke anusaar jikar agyanta or dukh se mukti or nirvana paane kii koshish karte hai
 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 sadiyon pehle isi sthaan se unhone dharm-chakra-pravartan prarambh kiya tha
 Buddhist followers also consider Sarnath's clay, stones and kankars as sacred
 sarnath kii darshneey vastuon main ashok kaa chaturmukh singh stambh, bhagwaan buddha kaa pracheen mandir, dhamek stupa, chaukhandi stupa, aadi shaamil hai
