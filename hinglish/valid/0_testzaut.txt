 92 is the atomic weight of uranium
 atah ye sabhi aavart sarini main uranium ke baad aate hai
 None of these elements are stable, and after radioactive decay they are converted to other smaller elements
 aavart sarini ko dekhne se gyaat hoga ki prakruti main paae janevaale tatwon main uranium sabase baari he or isaki parmaanu sankhya 92 he, parantu kuch aise manushyanirmit tatv bhi hai jinaki parmaanu sankhya 92 se adhik he
 These elements are called post-uranium elements, or parauranium elements
 ye saare tatv asthir tathaa radioactive gun ke hai
 They were discovered by immediate actions and were made from the uranium element
 rasinic gunon main inamen bahut samanta he, jisase inhen actenide shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 Plutonium has an important place in the post-uranium elements
 iskaa aarambh main hi upyog parmaanu bam main ho chukaa tha or 1950 i0 se purv hi iskaa utpaadan bhi adhik maatra main ho chukaa tha
 This makes the elements with higher atomic numbers more volatile, the isotopes of the elements are so unstable that their chemical application chemical properties are similar to those of sparse soils, or lanthanide elements

 Whose form is similar to that of the contract and according to which the obligation of the related parties in some form of mutual obligation arises
 antarrashtriya kshetra main sandhiyon kaa vah sthaan he jo deshiy kshetra main vidhiniyamon kaa hota he
 It is the means by which various states balance the behavior of their international life
 sandhiyaan naanaa prakaar kii hoti hai
 The treaty has many synonyms in the international language; They are also known by the names Treaty, Samjhauta, Protocol, Convenance, Accord and Memorandum of Understanding
 in alag-alag naamon ke baavjood antararashtriya vidhi ke anusaar sabhi sandhi hi hai
 Treaties can be considered as thick contracts
 sanyukt rashtrasang adhikaarptr rachana jiske dwaara anek deshon ne milakar antarrashrtiy vyavhaar ke mul niyam niojit tathaa ghoshit kiye; yaa kisi bhu pradesh kaa ek desh dwaara duusare desh ko sthanantaran, jaise oktober, 1954 i
 main france ev bharat ke madhya "samarpan" sandhi dwaara hua athwa koi samrik sambadh sthapana, jaisaa "uttari atlantic sandhi" dwaara hua yaa kisi desh vishesh ke tatasth rup kii ghoshnaa, jaise landan sandhi 1831 dwaara velgium ke sambandh main hui
 According to the rules of the treaty, the parties concerned are bound
 yah daayitv-abddhata hi sandhi kaa uddeshy hota he
 Once a country joins the treaty, it cannot be freed from its obligation until it gets permission from the other parties to the treaty
 sandhi anubandhanon kii apeksha kiye bina antarrashrtiy jivan nitant avyavasthit tathaa vidhiviheen ho jayega
 But unfortunately most often violate state treaties
 aashcharya kii baat yah he ki yah rajya sandhi ulanghan kaa arope kabhi sweekaar nahin karte
 Sometimes they say that their actions did not violate the treaties, sometimes try to make it clear that the treaty did not apply to them, sometimes they admit that they violated in the emergency
 kisi bhi prakaar koi antarrashtriya, sanstha yaa samudaay spashtatya sandhi kii upeksha sweekaar nahin karata, atev siddhant rup main sandhimanyata sarvatha sweekrut he
 To establish a treaty relationship it is necessary to first determine a representative
 is pratinidhi ko jo rajya niyukt karata he, vah use likhit rup main ek pratinidhitiv "adhikaarptr" pradaan karata he jiske anusaar vah desh kii ore se sandhi vaarta karne kaa adhikari ho jaataa he
 This charter is called "sovereign Authority" in the international language
 antaradeshy sandhivaarta sambandhi adhiveshan main sarvapratham ek "sampurna adhikaar samiti" banaai jaati he jo sammelan main aae sab pratinidhiyon ke "sampurna adhikaar" kii jaanch karti he
 The terms of the negotiations are then discussed confidentially
 gopneeyata sarvatha vaanchhneeya he, jisase sandhi kii aparipakvavastha kaa vadavivaad bahya jagat main prachaarit hokar sandhisthaapan main hanikar na ho
 All the representatives keep informing their states at every stage of this convention and keep consulting them
 pratinidhiyon ke hastakshron dwaara sandhivaarta kaa rup purna ho jaataa he
 Thereafter, according to the legislation of each respective state, if necessary, this treaty is sent for state confirmation of that country
 siddhantat: rajya ke pradhanadhyaksh athwa sarkaar dwaara pratinidhi ke hastakshar kaa samarthan hi pushtikaran mana jaataa he kintu aadhunik vyavharpranali ke anusaar yah pushtikaran bahut mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 The system of confirmation is beneficial because it gives the governments of the parties concerned a final reconsideration leave on the Convention and an opportunity to collect public opinion
 vishwa main jab rajtantrwaad kii manyata thi, tab sandhiprastaavon kaa anumodan swabhaavatya raja dwaara hota tha
 Even in the present era, kings in England and Italy, emperors in Japan, treaties in the name of the President in France, Germany and the United States are made and approved by them
 paashchaatya janatantrvaadi samvidhanon ke anusaar sandhi pushtikaran ke liye yah anivaary he ki kaaryakarini ke pradhan kii sweekruti ke atirikt kisi rup main vidhaayini sahmati bhi praapt kii jaae
 For example, in the United States, the treaty is ratified when the President's assent and 2 / 3 of the senators present is obtained
 france main sab sandhiprastaavon ke vishay main nahin kintu kuch vishesh mahatvapurn sandhiyon kii pushti ke liye niyam he ki "senetteron evam deputij" kaa bahumat praapt ho
 In Britain, in principle it is not mandatory for the emperor to obtain the approval of the Parliament in treaty ratification, but in practice there is some other practice
 saare mahatvapurn sandhiprastaav anumodan ke purv "house ov kaamanz" ke samaksh sahmati praapt karne ke liye rakh die jate hai
 In Switzerland some special treaties can also be placed before the general public for "public opinion" before confirmation
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik pranali ke anusaar sandhiprastaav sansad main keval suchnarth rakh die jate hai, anya koi kriya aavashyak nahin hoti
 Under monotony, confirmation is unilaterally performed by the executive
 pushtikaran ke purv kisi bhi sambandhit rajya kii karypalika yaa vidhanmandal kuch sanshodhan yaa sangrakshan upang prastaav main rakh sakate hai kintu inaki baadhyataa tab tak maanya nahin hoti jab tak anya sabandhit paksh unhen sweekaar na kar len
 By these protection measures, parties may exempt themselves from certain rules of special resolution, or may also accept a treaty by considering a particular rule in a modified form or in a particular sense
 pushtikaran purna ho chukne par pakshon main pushtikarnapatron kaa paraspar vinimay hota he
 When the treaty is multilateral, all the confirmation letters are placed in the foreign department of the country where the meeting of the treaty session is held
 yadi sandhi antarrashtriya sangh ke tatwadhan main hui ho to sab pushtikaranpatr sangh ke sachivalay main rakhe jate hai
 According to the manifesto of the union, it is mandatory that any member of the union make a treaty when it is registered and published by the Union Secretariat
 iskaa uddeshy keval yahi he ki rajyon main paraspar gupt samjhaute na hone paaen
 After the confirmation exchange, the treaty becomes fully effective

 Alha may have come from oral tradition, but Bundeli Bhumi is the first epic of culture and dialect, Jagnik is its author
 bhashaa kavy main bundeli boli kaa uttam mahakavy sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 The Bundeli dialect and its literature have a rich history and no written work is available in the language of poetry

 Sanskrit texts are the basis of all his poets, but in the poet Priya, Rasik Priya, Ramachandrika, Veerasinhadeva Charitra, Vigyan Gita, Ratan Vadani and Jahangir Raschandrika, the poet's extensive poetic language use and culture of the Bundel land are customary linguistic experiments of Keshav Bundeli
 He is a prominent poet

 The ritualist poet has presented the ritual element in Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Bhakti element in science Gita and Ramachandrika directly and indirectly

 After this period, the influence of typical localism starts to appear in Bundeli's compositions

 The more Aurangzeb pressed Chhatrasal, the more he emerged
 swatantra satta sthapit karne main chhatrasaal ne mughal adhikaar ke sabhi shaharon, rajyon ko lutaa

 The goal of both Lal Kavi and "bhushan" is the same
 puri shatabdi main saanskrithik kshetron main jaagarukta kaa parichay miltaa he
 The mixed poetic stream of ritualism continued to flow in disguised form, but the compositions of poets like Chhatrasal, Akshay Ananya, White "lal Lal" Bakshi Hansraj, Harisevak Mishra, had a favorable effect on the society
 ek drushti se samaaj kaa chaturdik vikaas is kaal main hua he

 gave the message of quadrennial unrest
 kaviyon kaa pradey is prakaar he ki bakhtbali mahacharya ne champatrai ke yudhon kaa varnan kiya to unke putr bhanubh ne bhi chhatrasaal ke yudhon kaa varnan or rashtriyata kii bhaavana kaa prasar kiya
 His second son Gulab was also a poet of this stream
 "laal' kaa pradey is kaal main isliye adhik he ki unhone chhatrasaal ko nayak banaakar ukne samast ghatnaon kaa yatharth chithran kiya he laal kii panktiyon ko tatkaaleen raajaaon ne dharmavakya ke rup main liya he
 Lal, who portrayed a serial of wars in Chhatraprakash, wrote- dhani champat ke autaro pancham shri chhatrasaal
 Whose permission should be done, the story is red
 
 Chhatrasal himself has also been a poet
 yuddh kala or kavyakala kaa adbhut mail unamem miltaa he
 He became engaged in great work by becoming the charit-nayak of Bundelkhand
 inke baad san
 1712 vi

 unhone kabir kii bhanti maanavdharm kaa pratipaadan kiya or samaaj kii buraaiyon ko dur karne main yogadan diya
 Similarly, Harisevak Mishra no
 1720 gave the message of exclusive love through the medium of "kamarup Katha" in the Premmargi Kavadhara
 deshi riyasaton main maharaj udotisingh ke aashray main kovidamishra ne bhashaa main hitopadesh, rambhushan muhoort dapann, nayika bhed aadi granth likhe
 Suvesh Kayastha of Sagar wrote Hitopadesh and Mitramilap
 bundeli muhaavaron or kavitaaon kaa uttam prayog kavi ne apane granthon main kiya he
 Maharaj Uditsingh himself has been a poet among the rulers of this time

 In the same period, Padmakar poet's father Mohanbhatt, Krishnakavi Sana Orchha, Gopakavi - court poet of Ransnidhi - Rupnarayan Mishra, Khandan Kayastha Datia, Kavindra Gyani Zoo, Gumanmishra - poetry period, Bodha poet's work is invaluable in the history of Bundeli poetry
 The gem hangs
 saanskrithik unmesh kavykaal bundelkhand kii chaturdik pratibhaaon se parichay hi nahin karata balki bundelkhand ke vikaas main yoga detaa he
 After this comes the Shringar poetry period in Bundelkhand
 bhaktikaal kii samruddhi brijbhoomi maani jaati he to reeti yaa shringaar kavy kaa purna unmesh bundelbhumi main hi hua he
 Acharya poet Keshavdas is considered the best poet of Reetikal

 With the coming of Padmakar, those hundred years of Bundelkhand passed which brought cultural unrest in this land
 chhatrasaal kii mrityu ke baad samgr bundelkhand choti-choti ikaayiyon main bant gaya
 There was a competition among these, but it was limited to makeup
 anek raajaaon ke aashray se prabhavit unki samast kritiyon main reetibaddh shringaar kramshah loktatv se judata gaya
 It was probably through Padmakar that the adornment of the makeup was done too much, so those compositions became more beautiful in which folk life has been
 isliye phag sahitya athwa ritukavy adhik aakarshak ban pade hai
 Padmakar has presented Bundeli culture, language and biography in sync with Shringar Ras

 They do not exist as much in folklorism as in the poetic coordinated poetry, a sample of the phage is sufficient- phag kii bhoren abhirain lai gahi govind bheetar gori

 isi prakaar gangalahari main "sudhar so ho to maang leto or duujo kahoon / jato ban kheti kari, khato ek har kii' main bundeli kii adbhut chata he
 Padmakar's euphemistic portrayal has sometimes become so superficial that it reaches the level of obscenity
 phag se padmakar ne bhi ekaadh sthaan par aisa abhidhaatmak prayog kar diya he
 After Padmakar, poets of Shringar period did not have the ability to give poetry
 rup saahi, damodar dev, manchit ne alankaar or nayika bhed ko mahatv diya he to navalsinh kysth ke krititv ""raas panchadhyaayi, aalha ramayana, ramachandra vilaas, rupak ramayana main kavi or chitrakaar donon kaa samanvay hua he
 Pratap Sahi Charkhari is considered the son of Ratnes Vandijan
 nayak-nayikaon or vyangy chithran main ye padmakar ke samaan pratibhashali hai
 He is also called the second Padmakar, based on his image depiction
 nares, orchha naresh tejsingh or sujansingh ke aashray main rahe hai
 He has tried to portray the queen of Jhansi with full history
 pajanera kaa krititv evam vyaktitv unka "pajness prakaash' he
 He is a poet of Bundeli entirely, but uses the words of Braj and Persian in place

 With regard to the prodigy of Shringar poetry period, it would be desirable to say that small native states rose up against the rulers of the Mughal period
 reetikalin kavi ne inke ashrith rahakar ek shatabdi tak jeevika kamai or bahoomoolya kritiyaan di
 The entire work of cultural excitement often ended with the departure of Chhatrasal's platform
 shringaar kavy kii charam seemaa dhore shrangaar'yaa yon kahen ki abhidhaatmak kavy main hui
 Some poets, however, produced characteristic texts
 padmakar, pratapsingh, navalsinh, kysth aadi ke kavy main swasth shringaar saamne aayaa
 The major rasa makeup of the entire period remained, but the valor and the shant rasa also got expression

 There were definitely good uses in terms of language

 The trends of Shringar poetry have been limited to the early decades

 These sacrifices became of national importance as they took on a personal role

 Names of revolutionaries like Bakhtabali, Mardansingh are named among his followers

 Bundelkhand was divided into Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh

 Something was revealed which is now coming Shani
 aadhunik kaal main chaar prakaar ke kavi milte hai
 The first class consists of poets who based on the characters of the past and created culture, religion, patriotic works
 dwitiya varg ke kaviyon ne aadhunik chetana evam swatantryonmukh vichaardhaara ko theth bundeli main prastut kiya
 Class III poets presented poetic compositions in sphutte verses

 In class IV, poets who adopted folklore style presented rural life

 The use of Khadi dialect and Braj is more common in the third class poets
 inamen bundeli ke shabd anayas aa gayi hai
 They have not been able to get away from Bundeli culture and soil
 chauthe varg ke kaviyon kii rachanaayen lokkavy kii praan hai

 Substantial delay in Bundeli culture, life and poetry stream contributed to the Bundelkhand territories being divided
 vikram kii 20 veen shatabdi main bundelkhand main bundeli or anya pradeshon main sthaneey boliyon ke sahitya kii vipul raashi drushtigat hoti he
 Sagar University Dr
 Balabhadra Tiwari from Bundelipith published three texts of the Bundeli poetry tradition that work in series in the ancient and new poetry stream
 aadhunik kavy-dhara kaa parichay bundeli kavy parampara bhaag 2 --aadhunik kavy-- main miltaa he
 Those poets of Bundeli have been given place in this work which after 1900 not only depict the life of Bundeli life but are also aware of the national and social environment
 hindi sahitya main dvivedi yug kii avsaan bela main pan ramanaresh treepathi or videshi bhashavidon ne pradeshik bhashaa, samskruti or sahitya par vishesh dhyaan diya he

 In essence, four types of poets are found in the modern period of Bundeli poetry
 1
 ateet ke charitron ko aadhaar banaakar rachanaayen likhane vaale samskruti-dharmi or deshbhakt kavi
 2
 Poets writing in the Bundeli of modern consciousness

 Overall, there is a certain tradition of Bundeli poetry that spans the last seven hundred years

 These five chapters of the Bhagavata Purana are considered to be the life of this Purana because in this chapter, the love and dedication of Shri Krishna through the divine leela has been established

 The summary of the five chapters of "ras Panchadhyayi" is summarized as follows - On the night of Shardiya Purnima, Lord Shri Krishna resolved to perform Rasamayi Rasakrida with the gopis
 unhone apni manohari kaambij vanshi kii dhwani bajaai
 On hearing the seductive sound of Vanshi, the gopis abandoned all their activity and reached Krishna in the Raas region
 shri krishna ne unhen pehle to samajha-bujhaakar apane ghar waapas jane ko kaha, kintu gopiyaan apane nishchay par arudh raheen or raasakrida ke liye krishna se aagrah karti raheen
 When the gopis were not ready to return to themselves, Shri Krishna, with a blissful state of mind, started Raslila with them
 is raasalila ko vaishnav bhakt divya krida maanate hai or iskaa aadhyatmik arth prastut karte hai
 Shri Krishna Chidanandaghan is the divine body, the gopis are the divine powers of the divine world
