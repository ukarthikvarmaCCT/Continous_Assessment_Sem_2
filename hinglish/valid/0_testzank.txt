 Kaushitaki Brahmanopanishad is the full name of Kaushitaki Upanishad
 yah ek rigvedic upanishad he
 The Kaushitaki Upanishad is part of the Kaushitaki Brahmin of the Rigveda
 isamen kul chaar adhyay hai
 This Upanishad highlights the worship of Jeevatma and Brahmaloka, Pranopasana, Agnihotra, Miscellaneous Worship, the glory of Pranaattva and the Chaitanya element existing in Sun, Moon, Electrical Cloud, Sky, Air, Fire, Water, Mirrors and Resonance
 ant main 'aatmatatva' ke swaroop or uski upasna se praapt fal par vichaar kiya gaya he
 In the first chapter, the Agnihotra and 'phalushruti' for 'brahm Gyan' are highlighted by the dialogues of the great grandson of Gautama Rishi and Garga Rishi
 jab mrityu ke uparant sadhak brahmalok pahunchataa hai, to uskaa saamana apsaraon or ek vicitra panlag par baithe brahmaji se hota he
 He talks to them
 is vaartalap ko 'paryank-vidya' bhi kehete hai
 Maharishi Chitra, the great grandson of the sage Garga, decides to perform the yagya and invites Arun's son Mahatma Uddālaka as the principal Ritvik, but Muni Uddālaka himself does not go and send his son तvetaketu to perform the yagna
 shwethaketu apane pita kii aagyaanusaar vahaan pahunchakar ek oonche asana par virajman hote hai
 Then the picture questions him - 'hey Gautamkumar! There is such a covered place in this world, where you can take me and keep it, or even there is such a completely separate and uniquely void position, knowing that you can establish me in the same world? aisa kahkar shwethaketu yajna kaa asana chhodkar chale gayi or apane pita se prashn kiya-'he pitashri! maharishi chitra ne jo prashn mujhase kiya he, uskaa uttar main kaise duun?' shwethaketu ne chitra kaa prashn apane pita ke saamne doharaa diya
 Then the sage Uddālaka said - ‘son! i do not even know the answer
 ham donon maharishi chitra kii yajyashala main chalakar va iskaa adhyayan karke hi is vidya ko praapt karenge
 'after that, both the father-son took the help of the famous Aruni Muni and went to Maharishi Chitra with curiosity and said that they have come to him for learning
 chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! aap brahmanon main ati poojaneey hai or brahmavidya ke adhikari he; kyonki mere paas aate hue aapke man main apni shreshthata kaa tanik-bhi abhimaan nahin he
 i will certainly make you understand this
 'maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he vipravar! jo vyakti agnihotradi satkaryon kaa anushthan karne vaale hai, ve sabhi is lok se chandralok, arthath swarglok kii ore gaman karte hai, lekin jo vyakti swargeey sukh ke prati aasakt hokar chandralok sweekaar kar letaa he, uske sabhi punya nasht ho jate hai or vah pun: is dharti par waapas aa girtaa he, arthath uskaa phir se punarjanm ho jaat he
 He cannot get salvation
 'maharishi chitra ke aisa kehane par gautam muni ne phir poocha-'he bhagwan! mujhe bataayen ki main koun hoon? mujhe is bhavasaagar se paar hone kaa vah upaay bataayen, jisase main samast bhav-bandhanon se mukt ho sakuun?' Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Gautam! The seeker going through the Devayana route is able to enter the 'brahmalok' through the six loks like Agnilok, Vayalok, Suryalok, Varunalok, Indralok and Prajapatilok respectively
 'brahmalok' ke pravesh dwaar par 'ar' naam kaa ek bada jalashay he
 This reservoir is directed by enemies such as work, anger, attachment etc
 yahaan pal-bhar kaa bhi ahankaar or kaam, krodh, lobh aadi kaa bandhan, sadhak ke sabhi punyon ko nasht kar daalata he
 This reservoir is the biggest obstacle in the attainment of 'ishta', but one who crosses it again reaches the bank of the holy Virja river
 uskaa samast shram or vriddhavastha, viraja nadi ke darshan maatr se hi dur ho jate hai
 Next comes a tree called 'ilai'
 yaheen par anek devataaon ke sundar upawanon, udyanon, baawali, coop, sarovar, nadi or jalashay aadi se yukt nagar he, jo viraja nadi or ardhachandrakaar parcote se ghira he
 All these appear to fascinate the mind again and again, but a seeker who does not indulge in them and moves forward, sees a huge shrine of Brahma Ji in front of him
 is devalayas kaa naam 'aparajita' he
 It is very difficult to conquer the Sun due to its bright colors
 isaki raksha megh, yajna se uplakshith vaayu tathaa akaash-swaroop indra evam prajapati dwaara kii jaati he, parantu jo unhen parajeet kar letaa he, vah brahmalok main pravesh kar jaataa he
 There, on the altar called 'vichakshana', in the midst of a huge splendid assembly-hall, Lord Almighty appears as an almighty soul sitting on a very beautiful throne
 vishwa janani amba or ambavayavi naamak apsaraayein unki seva main rat hai, jo brahmavetta sadhak kaa swaagat karti hai or use alankrita karke brahma ji ke sammukh upasthit karti hai
 'this Upanishad shows the way to reach Brahmaloka from the Devayana route by tying a very beautiful metaphor
 yaheen par rishi kahata he ki rath main baithkar yatra karne vaala purush, jis prakaar rath ke pahiyon ko daudte hue to dekhtaa he, parantu vah pahiyon kii gati ke bhoomi se hone vaale sanyog ko nahin dekh paata
 Similarly, a seeker who travels to Brahmaloka, sitting on a chariot, sees day and night, sees the movement of time, sees sin and virtue, but does not indulge in them
 vah unase dur rahakar hi 'brahm' ko praapt karata he
 Work, anger, greed, fascination and ego do not obstruct his path
 maharishi chitra aage bataate hai-'he gautam! brahmavetta ban sadhak apni sampoorn indriyon main brahmagandh, brahmaras, brahmatej, brahmayash tathaa brahmanad kaa anubhav karata he
 Then Brahma ji asks the Brahmist - 'who are you?' At that time, the question asked by Brahma ji should be answered by the Brahmandi in this way- is prakaar brahma ji ke sabhi prashnon kaa uttar dene ke uparant swayan brahma ji sadhak se kehete hai ki 'jal' aadi prasiddh paanch mahabhoot mere sthaan hai
 Therefore, my folk is also dominated by water etc
 tum mujhase abhinn mere upaask ho
 Therefore, this is also your world
 'is prakaar vah sadhak brahma kii 'jiti' or 'vyashti', donon ko praapt kar letaa he
 'maharishi Chitra overwhelmed Gautam Rishi thus preaching' Brahm Gyan '
 rishi gautam apane putr shwethaketu ke saath maharishi chitra ko pranaam karke waapas laut gayi
 This chapter highlights the worship of 'pranatattva' and the practical side of 'theosophy'
 iske atirikt apane paapon ko nasht karne ke liye 'suryopasna' putr kii kushal-mangal kaamana or suraksha ke liye, 'chandropasna,' achche swasthya ke liye 'somopasna,'moksh-prapti ke liye 'pranompasna' tathaa putr ko apane sampoorn jivan kaa daayitv-bhaar saunpte samay 'sampradaan karm' kaa bada hi sangopang varnan kiya he
 In the chapter on worship of nature, 'prana' is considered as the form of 'brahma'
 praan kii kalpana raja ke rup main kii gayi he
 'mana' is his messenger, 'vani' is his queen, 'chakshu' is his guardian minister, 'karnendriya' is the gatekeeper accepting the message
 praan ke aate hi samast indriyon kii seva praan-rupi raja ko swat: hi praapt ho jaati he
 The well-known Mahatma accepts dry arid 'life' as Brahma
 at: praan kii upasna hi isht siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 Excellence in life, happiness, prosperity, fame, glory and knowledge can be done through pranopasana
 suryopasnakaushitaki rishi ne apane anubhav se suryopasna teen baar-praat:kaal, madhyahnkaal or sanykaal- karne kii baat kahi he
 He has said that in the morning, keep the Yajnopavit in the morning and keep it on the left shoulder
 phir jalpaatr ko teen baar shuddh jal se bharkar, udai hote hue surya ko arghya pradaan karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen—' virgosi papmanan me vriddhi
 'thus in the mid-day, remember Lord Bhaskar and chant this mantra -' ॐ Vriddhidhi in udvargosi papamanam
 ' isi prakaar sanykaal main, ast hote hue surya kii upasna karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen- ' sanwargosi papmanan me sanvruddhi
 In this way, by performing Suryopasana, all the sins of a person day and night are eradicated, the power to not commit sinful deeds is generated
 chandropasnamavasya main, jab surya pashchim bhaag main sthit ho tathaa chandramaa sushumna naamak rashmi main chandramaa sthit ho, tab is vidhi se chandropasna kerani chahie
 Also keep two green sprouts in the pot offering arghya
 tab arghya dete hue is mantra kaa uccharan karen-'yatte susiman hridayamadhi chandramsishritan tenamritatvasyeshane maahan pautramadyan rudam
 With this kind of prayer, the worshiper keeps the son from mourning and in the event of no son, he gets the son-jewel
 somopasanarishi ne somopasna ko swasth sharir kaa kaaran mana he
 He prays to Mon - 'O woman-like Mon! You attain development through the sunlight in the form of men
 tum sabhi ore se ann kii prapti main sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You are full of gentle qualities
 tumhaara divya ras surya ke tej ko praapt karke purush maatr ke liye atyant hitkaari ho jaataa he
 Confirm the men who have consumed this divine juice and be fully helpful in defeating all their enemies
 he som! tum aagney tej se prasannataa ko praapt karte hue, amritv kii prapti main sahyog pradaan karo or swayan apane yash ko swarglok main sthir karo
 Hey Mon! i follow your right hand and rotate my right arm again and again
 ' rishi ne som ko paanch mukh vaala prajapati kaha he
 His mouth is 'brahmin', the second face is 'kshatriya', the third face is 'eagle' bird, the fourth face is 'agni'
 or paanchvaan mukh tum 'swayan' ho
 In this way, after praying to Som, before touching the woman ready for conception, touch her heart and recite this Mantra - 'yeat Sumime Hridaye Hitmant: Prajapatau Manyehan Maa Tadvidwansen Ten Mahan Pautramadhan Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii gayi prarthana se sadhak ko kabhi putr shok nahi jhelana padataa
 The sage refers to the mother who feeds her milk to her children
 uske doodh main somras-jaisi rakshaatmak shakti vidyaman hoti he
 The child remains healthy with that only
 mata kaa doodh balak ke liye naiysargik prakriya he
 Resistance to nature leads to many terrible consequences
 moksh hetu pranopasanamoksh ke liye prantatva kii upasna ke sandarbh main, rishi ne ek sundar roopak dwaara praanon ke mahatv ko darshaya he
 At one time, all the gods etc
, subjugated by ego, started to dispute each other to prove their importance
 praan ke saath sabhi ne sharir se bahirgaman kar diya
 As he left, the body slept like a wood without consciousness
 'vaani' ne apana varchasv siddh karne ke liye sharir main akele hi pravesh kiya
 As soon as Vani entered, the body started speaking to Vani, but he could not get up from his place
 iske baad 'netrendriya' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 Then he started speaking with speech and looking with eyes, but this time also he could not get up
 phir 'shrotendiy' devtaa ne sharir main pravesh kiya
 He started listening, speaking and seeing
 lekin is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa, nishcesht hi padaa rahaa
 Thereafter, the mind entered that body
 man ke dwaara vah sochane yogya to ho gaya, par is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then at the end 'prana' entered that body
 us prantatva ke pravesh karte hi vah sharir uthakar baith gaya
 With this, the importance of life became paramount, all other senses acknowledged the power of spiritual practice in salvation, salvation etc
 unhone janaa ki praanon ke dwaara hi amritv gun ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he or yah sharir upar uthakar swarglok kii ore ja saktaa he
 All the senses and senses of the body work through life
 at: praanon kii upasna dwaara hi brahm se sanyog kaa kaaran banataa he
 Only through life can one achieve the specific form of knowledge
 pita dwaara sampradaan-karm karnaa is adhyay main pita dwaara apane putr ko uttaradhikari banane kii prakriya kaa sangopang ullekh kiya gaya he
 The sage says that knowing that his last time has come, the father should be relieved of all his responsibilities and whatever he has, he should hand over to his son
 putr ko bhi apane pita dwaara chode gayi daayitv ko saharsha sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 The father should wear good clothes and call his son to him and say to him - 'O son! i give you my speech power, your soul, your eye, your ears, your taste, all your best deeds, your joys and sorrows, your copulatory power and kindness, your mobility, all your desires, your wisdom, your fame , Brahmatej and bestow my health and the power to digest food, etc
, or i covet within you
 ' pita dwaara aisa kehane par putr vinamrata se unhen sweekaar kare or apane baayen kandhe kii ore drushti karke haath se oot karke kahe-'pitashri! aap apni icchaanusaar kaamanayukta swarg ko tathaa vahaan ke samast bhogon ko praapt karen
 'after this, if the father is sick, then he can live with him by making or believing his son to be the master of the house or else abandon everything and leave the house to live a life of renunciation
 aisa pita uchit samay ke aane par divyalok ko gaman karne vaala hota he
 In fact, this is the correct rule of succession
 is adhyay main rishi ne praan, pragna or indriyon kaa vishad varnan karte hue unke parsparik sambandhon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 Dialogue-style has been used for this
 yahaan indra or divodas raja ke putr pratardan ke parsparik sanvaadon dwaara praan ko pragna kaa swaroop bataaya he or kaha he ki is pragna se hi lokhit sambhav he
 Once in the Devasur Sangram, Pratardan Swargalok, son of King Divodas, went to assist the Devatas
 vahaan unki adwitiya yudhkala evam shaury se prasann hokar indra ne unhen vardaan dena chaha tha
 On this, Pratardan said - 'hey Devraj! The best bridesmaid whom you consider to be the ultimate welfare for mankind, you should provide me any such best bridesmaid
 'pratardan kii baat sunakar devraj indra ne kaha-'rajan! is sansar main koi bhi aisa vyakti nahin he, jo dusron ke sukh ke liye var maangata ho
 You ask for a bridesmaid that is for you? ”on this, Pratidan refused to accept any groom
 raja pratardan ko satya kaa arudh dekhakar devraj indra ne kaha-'he rajan! tum mujhe hi, mere yatharth rup ko jaano? yahi maanav-jati ke liye shreshth vardaan he
 In this statement of Devraj, Pratardan recognized that Indra did not know how many astray Asuras and sages and punishments, but Indra's hair was not deterred due to being egoless and fruitless
 tab usne samajha ki nishkaam karm karte hue or ahankaar kaa sarvatha tyaag karte hue, jo jivan jiya jaataa he, vah maanav-kalyaan ke liye hi hota he
 Therefore, it is absolutely essential for a public welfare person to be selfless and selfless
 aisa vyakti hi indra, arthath pragna-rupi praan-tatva ke yatharth swaroop ko praptaj kar saktaa he or bade-se-bada paapakarm bhi use prabhavit nahin kar saktaa
 If a terrorist has to be killed to protect the divine instincts, then he also does not feel sin
 devraj indra ne pratardan ko upadesh dete hue kaha ki jo bhi mere satya swaroop ko pahchaan jaataa he, use kabhi paap nahin lagata; kyonki, 'main swayan hi pragna-swaroop praan hum
 'indra goes on to say that i am worshiped by the age and the nectar-form, famous to me, Indra, as a self-righteous being with that soul and superior knowledge
 vah spasht karata he ki aayu hi praan he, praan hi aayu he or praan hi amritatatv he
 As long as there is life in this body, then there is age
 is prantatva ke dwaara hi sadhak duusare lok main jaakar amritatatva ke vishesh sukh ko praapt karata he
 a person who worships Indra in the form of 'age' and 'amrit', he attains Purnayu in this world and enjoys the pleasures of heaven
 sharir main praan kaa mahatva hi sarvopari he
 If any part of the body is destroyed while still alive, the body remains alive, but if the life is not there, it is impossible for the body to survive even for a moment
 kriya shakti kaa bodh karaane vaala praan hi he
 Prana itself gives the power to be the instinct in knowledge
 ise hi 'pragna-swaroop praan' athwa 'aatma' kaha gaya he
 Therefore, for the upliftment of life, this life should be worshiped in the form of wisdom
 sharir main pragna or praan, donon saath-saath nivas karte hai tathaa jeevatma ke saath milakar ek saath hi is sharir ko chhodte hai
 This is the philosophy of pranamaya parabrahma and this is science
 isi kii upasna jan-kalyaan kaa mukhya strot he
 In a dormant state, when a human is asleep, then all senses and knowledge are absorbed in life
 lekin jab vah jaagta he, tab sabhi prakaar kaa gyaan, praan se nikalakar apni-apni indriyon main samaa jaataa he or sushupt indriyaan sajag ho jaati hai
 This is explained by the example of a dying person in the Upanishads
 ek vyakti, jo maranasann avasthaa main he, uski samast chetana shakti indriyon kaa saath chhodkar praan main samaa jaati he
 At that time, he neither hears nor sees, nor speaks, has been able to move his hands and feet, nor does his brain work
 yahi sthiti dhyansth yogi kii hoti he
 But when that moribund person resurrects after getting rid of diseases or that meditation practitioner returns to a comfortable life again, then all his senses become aware again according to their nature
 man ke dwaara nirdeshit hone lagati hai
 Prana first awakens the mind
 vahi sampoorn indriyon ko niyantrit or aniyantrit karata he
 Mind is directly related to 'pragya' and Pragya is related to Prana
 is prakaar praan, pragna or indriyon kaa anyonyashrith sambandh he
 Pragnya is the intelligence and all senses are governed by the same
 sharir se unmukt hone vaala 'praan' jab utkraman karata he, tab vah us samay in sabhi indriyon-sahit hi utkraman karata he
 Vani abandons all names, nose of all smells, eye of all forms, ears of all sounds and mind of all meditative subjects
 at: sharir main praan hi vah pragna he or pragna hi vah praan he, jo ek saath is sharir main nivas karte hai
 All the senses of the body are operated by them
 pragna ke dwaara hi vah samast indriyon ke swabhaav ke anuroop anubhuti ko praapt karata he
 In the absence of wisdom, the existence of all becomes negligible
 praan athwa pragna ke bina kisi bhi rup, vishay athwa indriya kii siddhi nahin ho sakati
 Just as the chariot's names are dependent on the arrows and the chariot's navel, all senses of the same kind exist by wisdom
 yah pragna athwa praan hi paramatma kaa anandaswarup or ajar-amar rup he
 It neither gets growth by good work nor shrinks from bad work
 yah samdarshi he
 He is the ruler of all the worlds and lord of all
 yah praan hi hamaara aatma he
 Knowing this, the presence of God can be experienced
 is adhyay main gargy naamak brahman rishi or kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke madhya hue vaartalap ko aadhaar banaakar samvaad-style main brahmand kii vividh shaktiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he tathaa 'aatma' ko hi 'brahm' sweekaar kiya he
 The son of Balaka Rishi, who originated in Garga gotra, was famous as Garga Rishi
 ve chaaron vedon ke prakand vidwaan the
 Ushinar Pradesh was his residence
 ve praaia: desh ke vibhinn pradeshon main bhraman karte rahete the
 Sometimes in Matsya country, sometimes he used to reach to live in kuru-panchal
 ek baar ve ghoomte-ghoomte kaashi ke vidwaan raja ajatshatru ke dabaar main pahunche
 There he spoke to the king in a very egotistical voice - 'O Rajan! i will teach you 'brahmatattva'
 ' gargy rishi ke aisa kehane par kaashi naresh ajatshatru ne kaha-'he vipravar! aapke is upadesh ke liye main aapako ek sahastra uttam kul vaali guaen pradaan karuunga
 i am happy that till now Mithila Naresh Janak was the name of the listener and donator of theology
 aaj aapane hamaare paas aakar videh raaj janak kii bhaanti hamaara gaurav badhaayaa he
 While preaching "brahmattattva", there was this kind of conversation between Rishi Gargya and Ajatshatru - Sage Gargya - "O Rajan! The God who is situated in this sunrise, i practice the same with my intellect
 'ajatshatru—'he brahman! aisa nahin he
 This white robed Sun is the greatest of all
 yah sabase ucch sthiti main kendrit, sabakaa sheesh he
 The person who worships this great man in this way, he reaches the highest position
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! chandra mandal main jo yah antaryami viraat purush he, main use brahmroop main maanakar uski upasna karata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! It's not like this
 yah to som raja he or ann kii aatma bhi yahi he
 i worship this in the same way
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah nishciya hi ann kii aatma ho jaati he tathaa dhan dhaany se bhar jaataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! i am a worshiper of this interim giant Virabh Parrahm under the Electricity Board
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 i worship this electricity as 'soul of light'
 jo bhi is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan prakaash-swaroop 'aatma' ho jaataa he
 'rishi Gargi-' o Rajan! i consider that transcendental God existing as a roar in the cloud
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa na kahen
 i worship this superior element only by understanding the soul of the word
 jo is prakaar isaki upasna karata he, vah swayan hi shabd kii aatma ke rup main parinat ho jaataa he
 'rishi Gargya then said -' o Rajan! i worship the iconic Parbrahm Parmeshwar in the sky as the imperishable Brahman
 'ajatshatru ne uttar diya-'he vipravar! main is vishay main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 This complete, trend-less Brahman is greater than all
 avashya hi main isi rup main isaki upasna karata hum
 One who worships such a divine Brahman, he becomes devoid of all beings
 samay se purv uski mrityu nahin hoti
 Similarly, while advancing the conversation, the sage Gargya called the Virat Purush in the atmosphere Brahm, but Ajatashatru called him Vaikuntha with great opulence of Indra, where the frustrations are destroyed and he is always undefeated
 uske baad rishi ne agni mandal main sthit viraat purush ko, jalmandal main upasthit viraat purush ko, darpan main pratibimbit viraat purush ko, pratidhwani main sthit dhwani ko, gatisheel viraat purush ke peeche uthne vaale dhvanyatmak shabd ko, sharirdhari kii chaaya ko, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko, pragna se yukt praan-swaroop aatma ko, daahine netra main sthit viraat purush ko, baayen netra main sthit viraat purush ko avinashi brahm ke rup main upasthit karke, uski upasna karne kii baat kahi
 But Ajatashatru, denying all, respectively, Agni, who endured the fire to strike others, is the nameless soul to Brahma in the water, the image to the image, the resonance lacks motion, the phonetic word is the 'life form', the body's shadow
 The form of death, the form of Prajapati to the great man in the body, the form of Yama to the soul with wisdom, the name to the man situated in the right eye, the fire Central and light of spirit, true man in the left eye, power and said high spirit and spoke to worship in the same way
 ajatshatru kii baat sunakar gargy rishi maun ho gayi or unhone ajatshatru ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya, parantu kshatriya hone ke kaaran ajatshatru ne brahman gargy ko shishy bananaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 Yes, in solitude, he made them aware of Brahm
 ve unhen lekar ek sote hue vyakti ke paas gayi or use anek naamon se pukaar kar jagaane kaa praytn kiya, parantu jab vah nahin jaagaa, to ajatshatru ne chadi se chot markar use uthaaya
 On his waking Ajatashatru said to sage Gargya - 'O Vipravar! Where did this person sleep unconscious like this and in which state was it and now after waking up, where has it come? ' The sage Gargya could not understand this secret, so King Ajatashatru said again - 'rishiwar! The place where this man used to sleep is life-like heart
 vahaan 'hita' naam kii prasiddh naadee he
 Through him, the heart extends to the entire pulse, which is even finer than the thousandth part of the hair
 in naadiyon main purush sote samay sthit rahata he
 The 'prana' situated in the heart of this sleeping man is possible with all the senses
 yah praan hi 'aatma' kaa khol he
 This intelligent soul sits in this shell in a subtle way, like a sword in a wooden sheath
 purush ke jaagane par yah 'aatma' sampoorn 'prantatva' ko sakriy kar detii he
 Then all the senses of that 'witness-form soul' follow like a permitted servant
 'isi 'aatma' ko jaanane vaala gyani, indra kii bhaanti apane sabhi shatru asuron athwa paapon ko nasht karke triloki kaa sarvshereshth pad praapt karata he
 Therefore, to know the 'soul', renunciation of ego is absolutely necessary
 tabhi vah apane paapon kon nasht kar saktaa he

 a section of critics are those who believe that Mahadevi's poetry is always personal
 unki pidaa, vednaa, karunaa, kritrim or banaavati he
 It is true that Mahadevi's poetic world comes under the purview of Shadowism, but to see her poetry completely unconnected with her era, one has to do injustice to her

 His contribution to the prosperity of Chhayavadi poetry is very important
 chhayavaadi kavy ko jahaan prasad ne prakrutitatva diya, niraala ne usamen muktchand kii avatarana kii or pant ne use sukomal kala pradaan kii vahaan chhayavaad ke kalevar main praan-pratishtha karne kaa gaurav mahadevi ji ko hi praapt he
 Emotionalism and intensity of feeling is the most prominent feature of his poetry

 She is remembered with respect for her speeches in Hindi speakers

 is avasar par diye gayi unke bhaashan main unke is gun ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Although Mahadevi did not write any novel, story or drama, the prose he wrote in his articles, essays, sketches, memoirs, roles and fine essays is an excellent example of the best prose
 usamen jivan kaa sampurna vaividhya samaaya he
 How much a creator can achieve in prose without resorting to imagination and poetic forms, it can be known only by reading Mahadevi
 unke gadhy main vaicharik paripakvata itani he ki vah aaj bhi praasangik he
 Her ideas related to social reform and women's freedom find a great harmony of perseverance and development
 saamaajik jivan kii gahari paraton ko chune vaali itani teevr drushti, nari jivan ke vaishamy or shoshan ko tikhepan se aankane vaali itani jaagruk pratibha or nimna varg ke nirih, saadhanheen praaniyon ke anuthe chitra unhone hi pehali baar hindi sahitya ko diye
 Apart from the original creator, he also has a form of creative translator whose philosophy appears in his translation 'saptaparna'
 apni saanskrithik chetana ke sahare unhone veda, ramayana, thergatha tathaa ashwaghosh, kalidas, bhawabhooti evam jayadev kii kritiyon se tadatmya sthapit karke 39 chaynit mahatvapurn anshon kaa hindi kavyanuwaad is kriti main prastut kiya he
