 The term fixed income also applies with an individual's income that does not vary with each period
 isamen niyat aay nivesh se vyutpann aay jaise ki band share variyata praapt stock yaa pension jo nirdhaarit aay kii guarantee hai, shaamil kar sakate hai
 When pensioners or retired individuals have to rely on pensions as the source of their principal income, the term "fixed income" can have the implication that it has relatively limited discretionary income or a small amount of expenditure for large types of expenditure
 There is also financial independence

 For a company to grow into a business, it must often raise money for acquisition financing, purchase of equipment or land
 Investors will only pay money to the company if they believe that they will be given something in return as per the risk profile of the company
 The company can either mortgage a part of it by giving equity in the company, or the company can make a promise to pay interest regularly and repay the principal of the loan taken

 While a bond is simply a promise to pay interest on borrowed money, there are some important terminology used by the fixed-income industry: niyat aay kii pratibhutiyon ke niveshak aam taur par apane nivesh par ek sthir or surakshit pratifal kii pratiksha karte rahete hai
 For example, a retired person would prefer to live on a regular dependable payment for the dependence of their livelihood, rather than consuming the principal
 This person can buy a bond with their own money and use the payment of dividends as regular fiduciary payments
 jab bond paripakv yaa punarvitt ho jayega, vyakti ko unka paisa unhen lautaa diya jayega
 Over time, interest rates vary, which are based on many factors, particularly the base rate that the central bank decides, such as a variety of factors, such as interest set by If the dividend on the bond is lower than the prevailing rate on the US Federal Reserve, UK Bank of England and the Euro Zone ECB, it lowers the price and vice versa, given the lower interest rate gains
 The attraction increases the height and hence the price increases

 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a 2005 book written by Malcolm Gladwell
 yah us anukoolneey avchetan par; vah maansik prakriyaayein jo saapekshik rup se alp jaankaree par tivrata or swachaalit rup se kaary karti hai, manovigyaan or vyaavhaarik arthshaastra se lokapriy vigyaan swaroop shodh ko prastut karti he
 It considers the strengths of both the adaptable subconscious, for example in expert judgment and its difficulties such as conservatism
 lekhak is pustak ke mul vishay ko "patala tukdaa karne kii kriya": maap karne kii hamaari yogyata, jo vastav main anubhav ke bahut najadik se hamaare liye mahatvapurn he, ke rup main varnan kiya he
 In other words, it is a presumption that automatic spontaneous decisions are often better or better than - carefully planned and considered
 gladwell vigyaan, vigyaapan, vikray, chikitsa or lokapriy sangeet se apane vichaaron ko bal dene ke liye udaahranon ko prastut karte hai
 Gladwell offers several examples of people's regular experiences with thin slicing
 gladwell bataate hai ki kisi visheshgy kii "patale tukade" kii yogyata unke pasand or naapsand, purvaagrah or rudhrivadita se kaise bhrasht ho sakati he or ve kaise adhik soochna se adhik bhari ja sakate hai
 Two particular forms of subconscious bias that Gladwell discusses are the implicit association test and psychological hygiene 


 Gladwell also tells us the ability of the senses to read our emotions, which is that we can only know this by looking at the face
 What feelings a man is experiencing ham apane nishkarsh par aane ke liye simit jaankaree kaa upyog karte hue ise us se karo "patali tukdaa karnaa" kaa upyog karte hai
 Gladwell says that this is an age of overloaded information, he finds that experts often make better decisions with quicker decisions than to do multiple analyzes
 gladwell, patala tukdaa karne ke kii vyapak shrinkhalaa kaa udhaaharan jua speed dating tennis, sainik yudhon ke khel, cinema, galat suits, lokapriy sangeet or bhavi talaak ke sandarbh main dete hai
 Gladwell also describes that sometimes more information can be in the frequency of judgment or the diagnosis of a doctor
 yah saamanyat: "vishleshan pakshaaghaat" kaha jaataa he
 The challenge is only to displace and focus on the most serious information to make the decision
 anya jaankaree nirnay nirmaataa ke liye apraasangik or bhramit ho saktaa he
 Storing as much information as possible in most cases only emphasizes our decisions but does not help to make it more accurate
 jaankaree kaa sangrah saamaanya rup se ek vyakti ke praarambhik vishwaas yaa durbhaavna kii pushti ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he
 Gladwell clarifies that better decisions can be made mostly by simplicity and information rather than the more general assumption that comprehensive information about a patient is proportional to a corrected diagnosis
 yadi badi tasviir nirnay karne ke liye adhik spasht he to sookshmdarshi yantra ke upyog ke bina badi tasviir se nirnay karen
 The book argues that intuitive judgment develops through experience, training, and knowledge
 udhaaharan ke liye, gladwell daawa karte hai ki un vyaktiyon main bhi jinaki chetan pravriti purvagrahit nahin he, purvaagrah sahaj avchetan str par sanchalit ho saktaa he
 An example in this is the halo effect, where a person who has the best in silent positive thinking in others respects unrelated
 gladwell 1999 ke amadu diyaalo kii hatya kaa upyog ek twarit sahaj nirnay ke rup main karata he jahaan neuyark ke chaar police vaale ek ek nirdosh aadmi ko uske ghar ke daravaaje par 41 goliyaan maarthe hai, iskaa daarun prabhaav ho sakate hai
 Richard Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago and a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Court, argues that Gladwell's blink is unable to follow his own recommendations in relation to a thin collision, and in illustrating the facts of this theory Many make unsupported estimates and mistakes

 Neutrophils usually make up 50–70% of the circulating white blood cells and serve as the body's primary immunity against infection by destroying bacteria present in the blood
 isliye, neutropania ke rogiyon ko bacterial sankramanon kii zyada ashanka rahati he or yadi sheeghra chikitsakeey suvidha na mili to yah rog jaanaleva ho saktaa he 
 Neutropenia can be severe or chronic depending on the duration of the disease
 yadi yah sthiti 3 maheene se adhik samay tak bani rahe to marij ko dirghakaalik neutropania se grast mana jaataa he
 Sometimes it is also used in place of the term leukopenia, as neutrophils are the most commonly found leukocyte, but it would be more appropriate to consider neutropenia a subclass of leukopenia
 neutropania ke kai kaarak ho sakate hai jinhen mote taur par do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he, asthi majja dwaara koshika ke utpaadan main samasya athwa sharir ke anya hisson main koshikaon kaa nasht hona
 upachaar kaarak kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he or upachaar ke dauraan sankraman ko rokane or uske ilaaj par jor diya jaataa he
 Three general guidelines are used to classify the severity of neutropenia based on complete neutrophil counts per microliter of blood: sambhav he ki neutropania kaa pataa naa chal paae, parantu saamanytah kisi rogi ko gambhir sankraman athwa sepsis ho jane par yah pakad main aa jaataa he
 Some common infections in patients with neutropenia may take unexpected forms; For example, the formation of pus may be significantly absent, as it requires the transmission of neutrophil granulocyte
 neutropania ke saamaanya lakshanon main bukhaar or baar-baar sankraman hona shaamil he
 These infections can cause conditions such as mouth ulcers, diarrhea, burning while urinating, abnormal redness around the wound, pain and swelling, or a sore throat
 kam neutrophil kii ginati, sampoorn rakt kii ginati hone par hi pataa lagati he
 Generally, other tests are also needed to reach the correct diagnosis
 jab nidaan anishchit hota he, yaa gambhir karkon kii sambhaavna hoti he, tab aksar asthimajja biopsy aavashyak ho jaati he
 Other tests that are usually performed are: sequential neutrophil counts if cyclic neutropenia is suspected, screening for antineutrophil immunity, autoantibody screen and systemic lupus erythematosus, screening for vitamin B12 and folate assays, and assidified serum test 
 karkon ko nimnlikhit samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Mild neutropenia can often occur during viral infections
 iske atirikt, morning sudonutropania naamak ek sthiti he jo sambhawatah kuch manovikar-rodhi dawaaon ke parshv prabhaav ke kaaran utpann hoti he
 There is no ideal treatment for neutropenia, but recombinant G-CSF can be effective in patients with chemotherapy and patients with congenital types of neutropenia

 Their demand was that Chandigarh should be the capital of Punjab only, Punjabi-speaking areas should be included in Punjab, Supreme Court opinion should be taken on the issue of river water, 'headworks of canals' and management of basic infrastructure for hydro-electricity generation
 Punjab should have, recruitment in the army should be on the basis of ability and in this the alleged limit on recruitment of Sikhs should be removed, and All India Gurdwara law should be made

 world-system thiyari ke mukhya janak emanuel wallrstine hai
 Wallerstein and other theorists of the global system believe that the world's capitalist economy suffers from four fundamental contradictions that make its end inevitable, even though the end of the Cold War and the emergence of the Soviet Union have dominated the world at present

 He termed this period as 'the Long sixty-first Century'
 isse pehle pashchimi europe saamanti daur main tha or aarthik utpaadan takreeban puri tarah khetihar paidaavaar par nirbhar tha
 According to Wallerstein, after 1300 there was a sharp decline in agricultural production on the one hand and on the other, due to the European climate, epidemics started spreading among the peasant population more than ever before
 solahavin sadi main hi europe poonjeewaadi vishwa-arthvyavastha kii sthapana kii taraf badha
 Under feudalism, production was for the consumption of the producers themselves, but in the new system the purpose of production was exchanged in the market

 In the new era, the process of economic growth moved the scope of the market towards geographical expansion, various forms of control over labor developed and powerful states emerged in Europe

 She could persist with more than one political dominion-center going beyond the borders of empires and her main feature was the only international division of labor between the center and the periphery

 On the other hand, due to the development in agricultural technology, the yield of agriculture also increased

 The expansion of skilled production based on banks, various trades, trade and manufactory created conditions for the continuation of wage based labor based economy

 Dr
 David C
 Lane, Professor of Philosophy in California, USA, expressed and referred to it as the new term 'chandian influence'
 radhaswami mat sahit nae dharmik andolanon ke shodhakarta mark jyargansameyer ne fakir kaa saakshaatkaar liya jisane fakir ke antartam ko ujagar kiya
 This interview became part of the autobiography of Fakir
 18 navambar 1886 main gaanv panjhaal, jila hoshiyarpur, punjab, bharat main unka janm hua
 He had a poor Brahmin family and a suppressed childhood against his background and was relieved in godly devotion
 kuch der maansaahaari rahane ke baad unka pashchaatap or prarthana unhen ek daivi drishy ke dwaara daata dayaal shiv brat laal ke zarie radha swami mat main le gaye
 He initiated the fakir into the Radhaswami Mat and read a book called 'saar-vyakha' written by the founder of Radhaswami mat Shiva Dayal Singh
 fakir ne paaya ki vah pustak uske hindu vishwaason or ruchi ke vipareet thi
 The references made to many religious movements in it did not match the views of the Fakir
 tathaapi daata dayaal ji main apane drudh vishwaas ke kaaran unhone pran kiya ki ve sachche ban kar apane guru dwaara dikhaae gaye maarg kaa anusaran karenge or apana anubhav duniya ko bataa jaayenge
 unhonen daata dayaal ji ke nidhan ke baad apane anuyaayiyon ko satsang karaane kaa kaary shuru kiya or tab apana anubhoot satya logon ko bataaya ki vishwasi sadhak main prakat hone vaale drishy, rup, rang or rekhaayen vastav main maaya hoti hai, satya nahin
 fakir ne paaramparik tareeke se 'naam-daan' dena bhi band kar diya
 The fakir said that the internal experience in satsang is the name given by him to describe the higher states of knowledge
 unhone guru bane bina guru ke sabhi kartavya puure kiye
 The literature of the miraculous and divine form of fakir is found in his followers in a situation of crisis and calamity
 lekin fakir ne saarvajanik rup se aise sabhi aise chamatkaaron ko yah kah kar apane se alag kar diya ki jo hua vah logon ke vishwaas ke kaaran hua na ki fakir ke kaaran
 unhone aise sabhi anuyaayiyon ko apana satguru ghoshit kar diya, kyonki unhen guru maanane waalon ke anubhav ne hi fakir ko man, aatma or shabd ke anubhavon se aage jane ke liye vivash kar diya
 This ultimately led to his ultimate peace and his search for truth and elimination ended

 The bones of the fakir have been carved in the premises of the humanity temple, on which the flag of 'be a Man' has been hoisted

 This can reduce the suffering of mankind
