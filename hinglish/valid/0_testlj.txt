 Chakeri is 20 km from Sawai Madhopur district headquarters and is well connected by road and rail
 yah dely mumbai railmarg par makholi railway stesan ke sanindhya me basaa hua gaanv hai, jahaan par shaam subah or der raat ko gaadiya mil jaati hai
 Jeeps are available here for road transport, but only in the evening and in the morning
 chakeri savai madhopur tehsil ,panchayat samiti ,jila parishad ,vidhansabha kshetra ke adheen aata hai ,loksabhaa ke liye tonk-savai madhopur nirvachan kshetra ke tahat aata hai
 Village is Panchayat in Chakeri
 gram panchaayat ke chunaav bhi chakeri main niyamit hote rahe hai or log apane gharelu muddo ko lekar apane pratinidhi chunate rahe hai
 Chakeri has a lot of political significance
 jab bhi koi bada chunaav hota hai to chakeri main jarur koi na koi badi sabhaae jarur hoti hai ,iske liye kaaran yah hai kii ek to isaki sthiti kaaphi gaanvo ko jodatii hai
 The second Chakeri has been influencing the political thinking of other villages
 chakeri ke log rajanithik taur par kaaphi jaagruk he
 They take all elections seriously
 yahan kaa rajanithik trend chunaavon kii pravriti par nirbhar karata hai jise ham is tareeke se samaj sakate hai
 Culturally, Chakeri has a distinct identity in Sawai Madhopur province, an organized center of many cultural activities
 yahan hone vaali vibhinn gatividhia nimna hai - Various types of religious activities take place at different times in the village
 chakeri kii saamaajik sthiti kai gaanvo ke liye preranyastrot rahi hai
 Chakeri is cited on many types of social conditions
 chakeri ke log jaagrukta ke madhyam se vibhinn kshetro main aage bade hai or gaanv kaa naam roshan kar rahe hai
 People of many castes live in the village, there is a saying that all the seven castes live
 meena jati ke log bahusankhyak hai
 Other castes include Nath, Bramhan, Jain, Bairwa, Dhobi, Gawariya, Nai, Chamar, Rager, Harijan, Koi, Gurjar, Khatik, Rao and Rajput etc
 sabhi log hindu dharm ko maanane vaale hai
 a small number of people also believe in Muslim religion
 meenaon kaa praathmik kaary kheti-baadi or pashupaalan hai
 Apart from the Meenas, Nath, Bairwa, Brahmins, Jains and Gurjars also cultivate
 jiname brahman or jain log duusare rojgaar praapt karke shahro main bas gaye hai or apni jameen main yaa to saajha de gaye hai yaa phir bech kar chale gaye hai
 Most of those who are living here have shared
 bairavaao ke bhi kai khet the par vahaan pani kii kami ke kaaran inhone bech die, haalanki inaki jameen SC ACT ke kaaran khate nahi lag sakati, par inhone jis tareeke se bechin hai ye lagbhag ab apana swaamitv kho chuke hai
 Some people of Nath community are engaged in farming due to the right availability of water on their land, yet many of them have left farming
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai kii kheti-baadi ke kaamkaaj meenaon ke dwaara hi kiye jate hai
 The education level of the Meenas was very low at first, due to this, the only means of earning their livelihood was agriculture and only nominal people used to work in them
 parantu aage chalakar pani kii kami ke kaaran kheti kam hone lagi, jansankhya vruddhi ke kaaran bhi kheto kaa batwaaraa ho gaya or utpaadan main kami ai, isse inhone naukari kii zarurat ko mahasoos kiya
 After this, he paid attention to the education and education of his children so that he could find employment by studying and leading a respectable life
 tab se kai yuva pard-likhakar ke naukari lage hai or kai ucch shiksha ke liye shahro main gaye hai
 Now many students of these farmers have even become doctors, engineers and government officials and the coming generations are also moving forward by being inspired by them
 ab kisaano ko lagane laga hai kii "hamane to jindagi dukh-dardo main kaat di par hamaare bete is tarah nahi jienge ,ham unki jindagi sudhaarney ke liye khun-pasinaa ek kar denge" kisaan lone le le lekar ke apane bacho kii skool, college, koching kii fees bhar rahe hai, unke baahar rahane kaa karcha uthaa rahe hai
 But the biggest thing is that in Chakeri, on average, one of the houses has become a servant
 is prakaar minaao ne bhi shiksha ko hathiyaar banaakar apane jivan-str main sudhaar laane kii kavayad shuru kar di hai
 The people of Chakeri are of progressive views
 jo mahilao ko bhi baraabar kaa darja dete hai
 The status of women in the village can be seen through the following quotes
 gaanv main kuch samaaj abhi bhi jajmaani pratha main lage hue hai
 The Jajmani system was formed during the time of the Mughals, in which some sections rendered their services in lieu of food grains, many of them continued their ancestral work as employment and lived their lives on the basis of that
 isse duusare varg ko bhi bina pareshaani ke sevaayen milti rahi
 Some of these classes are still active
 haalanki kai yah kaary is tareeke se band kar chuke hai or ab nakad bhugtan praapt karke karte hai
 Majority of the population of Chakeri are employed in farming
 adhik jansankhya vruddhi ke kaaran kheto ke aakaar chote huhe hai, or seemaant kisaano kii sankhya badi hai
 People from many communities have also engaged in their traditional work like ki-nai, Rao etc
 yah gram panchaayat dwaara kai kaary karaaye gaye hai, saath hi gaanv main rajanetao se achche vyavhaar ke kaaran vidhayak tathaa saansad cote se bhi kai kaary kiye gaye hai, yahaan ham inke bare main dekh sakate hai
 There has been a lot of awakening in the village through education, especially among the youth
 chakeri main uplabdh shaikshanik santhaan nimna hai - Chakeri is well connected to all the surrounding villages by road, and also has good connectivity to the district headquarters
 chakeri ke andar bhi sabhi maarg lagbhag cimentikrut ho chuke hai ,jisase gramvaasiyo ko barsh bhar sahi tareeke kii parivahanta praapt hoti hai
 Earlier people had to face increased problems especially during the rainy season, because of lack of paved roads, i used to have problem of slurry
 nikatavarti gaanvo ke saath sambandh tathaa judaav ham is tareeke se samaj sakate hai, in sabhi gaanvo ke saath chakeri apni bhu-rajasav seemaa saajha karata hai
 Therefore, the villagers who have fields around Kakad, seek help or help from farmers of other villages for their farming related things, such as water filling and need of water, holdings etc
 in sabhi sahyogo ke kaaran inke bich achche sambandh ban jate hai, or aapas main buaariban jate hai
 The emphasis is now on putting Chakeri in the modern atmosphere under this campaign
 taaki gaanv ke log duniya main aa rahe parivartanon ke saath kadam se kadam milakar ke chal sake
 The new generation of the village has moved ahead in education, if the facilities are not developed in the village according to them, then they will settle in the city
 is paridrishy se kuch kaary gaanv main ho chuke hai jaise kii - Apart from these, many facilities are yet to be developed inside the village
 or kai purv sthapit suvidhao main sudhaar karne kii aavashyaktaa hai
 The things proposed to be taken care of under this campaign are as follows - gaanv ko tatkaaleen badlaavon ke sang chalane ke liye kuch sarkari prayaason main sakriy bhagidaari nibhaane kii aavashyaktaa hai

 It is mainly spoken in Antarāt Mongol, the independent state of Inner Mongol, the Buryat Mongol state
 in kshetron ke aririkt iske bolanewaale manchuriya, china ke kuch kshetra or tibet tathaa afghanistan aadi main bhi paae jate hai
 It is estimated that there will be some 4 million Mongol speakers in all these areas
 in vishaal kshetron main rahanevaale mongol jati ke sab logon ke dwaara sweekrut koi ek adarsh bhashaa nahin he
 But within the so-called Mongolia, the Halha dialect of Democracy Mongol is gradually assuming the role of ideal language
 swayan mongolia ke log bhi is halha boli ko parishkrut boli maanate hai or isi boli ke nikat bhavishya main adarsh bhashaa banane kii sambhaavna he
 In ancient times, the literary Mongol written in the Mongol script was considered an ideal language among the educated people
 parantu ab yah mongol lipi janatantr mongolia dwaara tyaag di gai he or isaki jagah roosi lipi se banaai gai nai mongol lipi sweekaar kii gai he
 Thus, now the literary language written in Mongol script is less and the Halah dialect written in New Mongol script is considered more valid
 mongol bhashaa anek boliyon main vibhakt he
 Following are the main bids: purvi mongol Northern Branch - Burayat Dialects Northern Dialect Terti Dialect Eastern Dialect dakshini shakha- chahar boli Western mongol oirat shakha - Cobb's Oirat footkar boliyaan Dagor Heiler Boli; Chichihar dialect monguor boli Mogol dialect anya boliyaan The history of Mongol language can be divided into three periods, ancient, middle and modern

 There is not much difference between medieval and modern Mongol
 pracheen mongol ke bare main spasht gyaat nahin he
 The history of Mongol literature begins with the history of the mystery of Mongolia built in the middle of the 13th century
 tathakthith aadhunik sahitya 1921 main hui anakranti ke aasapaas se aarambh hota he parantu ab tak mahatv kii rachanaayen adhik nahin hai
 Three important texts were written in the seven centuries up to 1920 before the birth of modern literature - the history of the mystery of Mongolia, the story of Gezer Khan and the city "mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas" sheershak granth main mongol jati ke janm se lekar chinagis khan tak kaa itihaas he or chinagis khan par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 It is written in very simple and beautiful language and poems are also mixed in between
 isamen choti si kamjor jati ke mongol logon ke ikatthe hokar kendriya sattatmak desh banane, parivarapradhan samaaj se badalakar jagiradaari samaaj banane tathaa chote se jagiradaaron ke ikatthe hokar bahut prabal desh banane tak kaa itihaas varnit he
 "the story of Gesar Khan" is the story of a man based on mythology
 isamen jagirdaar ore pujari varg ke virudv ladanevaali janata kii prashansa kii gai he
 "jangar" is a historical tale made in western Mongolia
 isamen ek purush ke kaaryo ke madhyam se janata ke kalyaan or sukh par jor diya gaya he
 Golden history is very famous in historical texts, the gem of history
 donon chinagis khan or uske uttaradhikariyon ke itihaas hai
 These include ancient Mongol mythology, folklore etc
 aadhunik sahitya 1921 kii janakranti tathaa jagiradaari pratha ke viruddh janata ke sangharsh se prerit hokar viksit hua he
 The basic source of modern literature is based on the socialist realist ideas based on the history of this struggle

 Oidob aadi lekhakon ne jagiradaari shaktiyon ke virudv janata ke sangharsh main janata kii vijay tathaa nai or puraani vichaardhaaraon ke sangharsh par aadhaarit acchhee kritiyaan prastut kii hai
 In him, Naichgadorji is called the father of modern literature
 unka kavy naatak vishesh sambandh ke teen bahut prasiddh hen
 Damsdinsureng's "single" is also a very good work
 yah jagiradaari samaaj main du:khamay jivan vyateet kar rahi ek stri ke aadhunik samaajavaadee samaaj main hi anand praapt karne kii katha he
 In this way, some good creations have started coming out

 yah ek bhashaa he, jo ki bharat or bangladesh main 19 lakh logon dwaara vyapak rup se boli jaati he
 The word Kokborok is a combination of the two words 'kok' and 'björk', 'kok' meaning "language" and "björk" meaning "human", therefore, together Kokborok means the language of man or their language
 The Björk people but it was completely different before the early 20th century
 Instead of using the word Kokbarok as the language of the Bokok people, the language was also known as Tipra, also the language of Tipres
 tipra kuch anya bhashaaon kaa mishrit tha jo ki mul rup se tripura main boli jaati hai, ye halaam bhashaa, moke bhashaa, darlong bhashaa or vartmaan cokeborok bhashaa hai
 Tipra also had a script that has become extinct, known as Coloma

 Since then, many organizations have used the Latin script to publish books, articles, magazines, newspapers, and to express their views in media and social media, instead of using the Eastern Nagari script
 The use of Bengali scripts is also widely seen in writing as the Kokborok language is used in educational institutions for larger and larger institutions
 yah tab tha se 2010 ke liye maang cokeborok bhashaa kii apni lipi ban gaya he ke liye ek gambhir mudda cokeborok bhashaa developers
tab se kai develper kii koshish kar rahaa tha viksit karne ke liye ek behatar vishwasaneey strot ke liye cokeborok bhashaa bhashaa he

 1) Alindralal Debbarma, was one of the first to develop a script of their own Kokborok language, it is better known as Tripuri Script 2) vahaan the bhi anya developers viksit kiya he jo ek script cokeborok bhashaa he 
 It is clearly seen that Anant Debbarma, his dedication can be
 is script vichaar kar rahaa he ek sabase adwitiya script itani dur he
 3) Montrajoy Tripura, like other developers, is also a visioned script for the Kokborok language 4) vahaan the, yah bhi developers kii tarah hriday chandra Jamatia 5) There were also people from Bangladesh, who also contributed a script to develop the Kokborok language, one from Malek Fakir
 6) bangladesh main, sanghathan kii tarah tripura_jati_porichoy ke mustafa maajid bhi vikaas main yogadan diya cokeborok bhashaa 7) Like the developer Niranjan Debbarma, in his view Kokborok language scripts 8) un logon se sabase lokapriy yaa prasiddh script viksit kii he "eieme"
 cokeborok bhashaa script dwaara viksit Hiralal Debbarma
 script he, jo kuch hasil karne kaa avasar ke rup main aadhikarik darja dwaara cokeborok bhashaa vibhaag ke adhikari ke rup main script he 
 9) Another script which claims to be an identity developer with a very dark background as its own, but can be found is that of its social pages
 ke dwaara viksit kii he, anaam he 
 Yet this script is a powerful system of its own
 You can just say it's an Abugida-like "latin" or "roman" letter or logo graphics like "chinese characters" like this script-like characters - "UA" means UA, "AA" 
 " Which means A
 A
, but like the characters "e" is not really "e", its actually the word "emang", to bajaay likhane ke Emang ke sangyojan ke dwaara paatro kii tarah "i"+megawatt+e
 e
+wng", aap kar sakate hai bas rakhaa charitra "i" yah matlab hoga "emang" aap ke liye he 
 Like that as mentioned above, characters like "CHW" means "chwng", "KW" means "kwtwi", "LW" means "lwi", "PHW" means " Phwrwngmung "," BW "means" Borok "it is, in particular even the character looks like a human standing," MW "means" Mwtai "is actually this letter unique because it means God , There is a line of three with lines, we all know that has been done in three to express a symbolic figure
 a vast majority of God, means three things many religions that do sign symbol Christian cross or mean "shiva" Three Eye, etc
 , 
 "GW" means "gwdalmung," DW means "da", "THW" means "thwi", "NW" means "nwng", "RW" means "rwng", "yw-yes" means "yak"
 or aap jaanate hai ki baaki he 
 Well you might not notice that all characters logo graphics characters like some characters "U O" "O" "NG" "brave" "W" "JW" "SW" "KHW" "WW" " y "" AE "and" AENG "

 chunautiyaan- No means are available from all sides to the sub highway
 There is no way to reach the temple, the route is also not good

 All subways from the highway to the temple should be made free of pits and made accessible to the people
 2
 The temple is old, so it should be renovated
 3
mandir kaa parikrama maarg sudrudh hona chahie| 4

 There should be greenery around the temple, so that people can be affected
 7
mandir main koodaydaan kii vyavastha honin chahie,taaki mandir main gandagee na ho| 8
 There should be at least one or two shops near the temple, so that pure offerings can be made
 9

 There should be a temple sign board on the highway
