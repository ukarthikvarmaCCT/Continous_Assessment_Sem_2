 film kaa sangeet nirdesan bappi lahari ne kiya tha tathaa gayaki main suman kalyanpur, munna azeej or shairan prabhakar shaamil rahe
 The film begins with a young boy who is imprisoned in a huge cave cage
 jo kuch pujaariyon or gunde kism ke logon se ghira hua he
 He pleads for their release and asks what they want from him
 pujari bataata he ki unhen sirf uskaa khun or gosht chahie taaki nakita ko jivit kiya ja sake
 At the same moment a witch arrives in the form of a very beautiful woman and enters the cave
 phir vah apane gale se chamagadadnuma lacket utaarti he or ek daraavnee shakl main badalakar, us shaks ko maar daalati he
 Thakur Mahendra Pratap Singh then learns of the horror and devastation caused by the witch Nakita running in the nearby forest
 ek raat, unki choti beti unke yahaan aakar bataati he ki gaanv waalon ko vahaan ek laash mili he
 On reaching there, you can see the dead body of that unknown person surrounded by the people of the village
 puchhne par bataaya gaya ki aisa jangal main aksar rahasyamay dhang se vicharne vaali aurat kaa kaam ho saktaa he
 Whom people call witch
 magar samir thakur aise chudail va shaitanon ko ek kora andhvishwaas bataate hai
 But according to one of them, a few years ago when he was returning to the village from a nearby town, he lost his way and while walking in the forest, he sees a young woman wandering there
 jo ek chamagadad main badal jaati ho or uske chehre par hamalaa karti he
 Mahendra Pratap decides to investigate the matter
 unke chote bhai samir pratap is dian kaa shikaar karne kii thaante hai
 Here his wife Preeti stops his daughter and niece from leaving
 lekin abhi vah kuch hi seedhiyaan utre the or mahendra pratap bataate hai ki unhen apane bhai par puraa yakeen he or unke purvajon se jinase bhi logon ne nyaay maangi unka puraa sahyog diya
 He gives the word "ॐ" as a gift to his brother and wishes him good luck
 jyon hi samir apni car par ravaanaa hokar jangal se gujarata he, use ek behad khubasurat yuvati milti he jaisaa ki us dehati ne ullekh karaayaa tha
 She asks the girl Sameer for a lift on the car
 vah log ek puraani haveli pahonchte hai jiske peeche hi jangalon se ghira ek jhil maujuud he
 She traps Sameer with his intoxicating ways and she seduces the young woman to take a bath in the bathtub
 is tarah uskaa yah man bahalane vaala naatak uske saath shaareerik sambandh tak pahunchataa vah uski gardan se us chamagadadnuma lacket khinch daalata he
 With this comes a disgusting form of the girl who calls herself a witch Nakita
 samir chunki uski kamajori jaanata tha or isliye vah us "" ke jarie laachaar kara detaa he
 Sameer Pratap Singh brings the witch to the outskirts of the village and on Thakur's orders, the locals hang him
 vahiin ek tantric baba, apane anucharon saath kisi tarah der raat laash churaakar vaapis mandir le aate hai, jahaan use ek pathar ke nakkashidaar tabut main rakhte he or pran lete he ki use ve nayaa sharir dilaa kar rahenge
 That body is ultimately the victim of Thakur Mahendra Pratap's daughter
 kuch din unke khushnuma or shant samay guzarate rahete hai, donon bhai ghanton apni khushiyon main magn rahete or samir kii patni priti bhi apni nanhee bacchiyon unke devar kii beti yasmine or sagi beti sahila kii prempurvak samaan rup se parvarish karti
 Finally, one day in the morning, the younger Thakur goes to send his niece, Yasmin, to him at the Bordering School in Mussoorie
 par jab vah log sunsaan junglee viraane se guzarate he, car kaa engine garm pad jaataa he or band hota he
 Admitting that his uncle is talking, little Yasmin waits in the car and starts to fetch water for the radiator
 magar tabhi, vah tantric baba jhaadiyon kii oot se baahar aakar, bacchee ko sammohit karata he, or uski fraq kaa tukdaa or baalo kii lat se ek gudiya banaata he
 Then the doll takes the glass bottle to the witch's grave
 vahiin car main maujuud yasmine bhi sammohan ke prabhaav main us mandir kii ore chale jaati he
 Meanwhile, Sameer Pratap returns with a water filled kantar and the child is taken aback by missing a child in the car
 vah nishaanon kaa peechha karata he or baad main khud ko hairaan kar dene vaale aise ilaake pahunchataa he jo ghani jhaadiyon se dhakaa hua tha
 On the other hand, Yasmin enters the devils' den and reaches near the witch's coffin
 tabhi aarshchaychakit kshan main, vah dian jaag jaati he or yasmine ko apane bheetar khinch leti he
 Samir Pratap, who reached the spot, tries to save the girl but he has to delay in opening the casket
 utane hi vakt main, dian kii dushtatma ab yasmine ke sharir main samaa jaati he
 At the same time, Sameer Pratap is helpless at his failure to save his niece when the man of that tantric surrounds him
 use bandhak banaaya jaataa he or maar diya jaataa he
 The tantrik takes Yasmin back and takes her father Thakur Mahendra Pratap's mansion
 tantric apni managasaint khabar main mahendra pratap ke parivaar ko bataata he unka bhai jangal main aae bhayanak tufaan main funs nadi main bhatak kar maaraa jaataa he or swayan laapata ho jaataa he
 Yasmin is brought to their room and allowed to sleep, the elder Thakur Saheb assigns his 2–3 servants to him and stops at the bottom of the stairs and meets the Tantric Baba
 baba ab thakur se lautne kii ijaajat maangata he lekin thakur sahab unase rukne kii darkhaast karte he or yasmine kii jaan bachaane ke evaj main use uskaa sevak banaate he
 However, Yasmin's behavior to Sameer Pratap's wife, seems unnatural
 bacchee ke vyavhaar main aae badlaav ko lekar uski chachee hone ke naate vah apane bhaisur se unki beti main hue anokhe parivartan ke bare main bataati he or yasmine ilaj ke liye kisi jhaad-phunk vaale yaa doctor kii seva lene ko manaati he
 However, the witch, who was caught in the child, hears these things and in the late night kills her aunt Preeti by hanging them on the ceiling fan of Yasmin's room
 mahendra pratap thakur, is ghatana se dahal uthte hai, ve apni anaath ho chuki choti bhatiji sahila ko, mumbai uski nani ghar bhejne kaa nishchay karte hai taaki vahaan vah surakshit rah sake or is manahuus paristhitiyon se dur rahe
 After 12 years, the elder Thakur receives his letter from his niece
 unhen yah jaanakar behad khushi hoti he vah apane madhyavarti imtahaan main awwal shrenee main paas hui he
 With the passing time, Yasmin also grows up into a very beautiful woman who mostly stays in her closed room and sometimes wanders in the jungles
 uskaa swabhaav bahut mudi ho chukaa tha or apni hi duniya main khoi rahati, jisaki vajah se uske pita sara vakt chintit rahete
 Thakur Saab tells Baba about his niece succeeding in the examination and he is very keen to invite him to spend his summer vacation in Chandan Nagar
 baba duusari taraf apane daitya sareekhe vishwasi naukar zimbaaru ko unki bhatiji, sahila ko aguva karne bhejte hai taaki vah apane paitruk nivas pahunchane hi naa paaen
 And then Zimbaroo attacks Sahila's car and falls behind him
 uskaa doosraa chachera bhai satish, madad kii guhaar lagaataa he
 At the same time, like a hero, a young man named Hemant enters, and reaches to save the girl trapped in this trouble
 vah us zimbaaru or uske gundon ko khaded daalata he or sahila ko bachaa letaa he
 Back in the village, Yasmin meets a young mechanic of the City Patrol who is a skilled car mechanic and repairs the car with great efficiency
 vah usase behad prabhavit hoti he or puraani haveli kii peeche jhil kinare der raat picnic manaane kaa nyauta detii he
 When the man reaches there, she hides him and the two drink jam together and eat

 ) aadhi raat ke kuch vakt baad, us shaks kii chetana lautati he or jaag jaataa he
 He wakes up to see Yasmin's colorless eyes and finds that her eyelashes are not blinking as well
 vah bhaagane kii koshish karata he lekin vah dubaara bistar par gir padataa he
 Then the girl, under the control of the witch, takes her silver skewer and kills the man
 yasmine munh andhere hi jaldbaaji main ghar lautati he
 The man's body is recovered by the police the next morning and is not identified, and its investigation is also stopped
 udhar is safar main hemanth or sahila kareeb aate hai or donon saath hi haveli pahonchte hai
 Thakur Mahendra Pratap feels very happy to come to Sahila's house and when he comes to know that Hemant had come to save him in his trouble, he is unable to live without being impressed by this admiration of the charming and brave young man and he finds him in his wood
 Purses an important position on the factory

 Despite this, the sequence of mysterious murders continues
 aise hi ek shaam, yasmine ek nashe main dhut vyakti se car kii lift maangati he or tab, kuch faasale par, dian kii aatma us vyakti kii gardan faad kar maar daalati he
 One night, Sahila wishes to sleep with her sister Yasmin in their old room and soon realizes that something strange is happening there, she is frightened by her sister and refers to her Uncle Mahendra Pratap and Hemant
 Does
 thakur mahendra pratap tay karte hai ki vah apni beti yasmine ke, maansik moolyankan ke liye apane dost se milenge jo swayan ek manovaigyanik he
 The doctor, through her hypnosis, recounts the events in Yasmin's past and then she turns into a completely different person
 uski boli badal jaati he or dhamkee bhare lahaze main kahati he ki vah thakur khandaan ke harek sadsy ko markar apana badla lekar rahegi
 Thakur Mahendra Pratap does not initially believe the doctor's words, but upon hearing the recorder tapes recorded by the doctor, he is convinced that his daughter has been possessed by the demon
 baavjood, thakur ke khandaan se puraane sambandh or gahari dosti ke naate, doctor unase vaayada karata he ki vah jarur tehregaa or unki bacchee kaa ilaj karke rahegaa
 At the same time, the doctor first asks Sahila's friend Hemant to create a drama to get close to Yasmin so that the truth can be highlighted but this effort also goes in vain
 tathaapi, ek raat, unako yasmine ke kamare se ajibo garib saae or dhuen aate dikhte he, doctor us taraf chal padataa he or unako us dian kaa nihaayat hi khaufnak surat dekhne miltaa he
 He warns Thakur Saheb about this but he refuses to trust his words
 doctor tab apni jaan bachaane vaaste unke ghar se bhaag nikalate hai, magar usee raah main ghar kaa khansama raghu bhi uskaa majaak udaata karata he jab haveli chhod rahaa tha
 In this haste, Dr
 Raghu walks out of the mansion, removing even Raghu where Yasmin's face on the balcony flashes a strangely triumphant smile
 vahiin doctor gaanv ke raste apni car ko khatarnaak dhang se bhagaata he, is jaldbaaji ke uljhan main, vah ek ped se takaraata he or khud ko us jangal main akelaa paata he
 The witch, who was lying there waiting for her to arrive, suddenly appears like a dark shadow, and the doctor also senses that she is horrified to see him, then pierces her body and kills her ferociously
 
 udhar vah naukar raghu, bhi aglaa shikaar hota he
 When he is terrified of the witch, instead of going to the mansion, he decides to spend the night in the factory and he dies the same night
 tab hemanth or sahila va uskaa chachere bhai satish is musiibat ko khatm karne kaa vichaar karte hai, jisamen baba ke muddon ko bhi uthaaya gaya
 Hemant then decides to follow the Baba where he hides with Sahila
 is tarah peechha karte hue vah log viraane tak pahunch jate hai
 But soon they are caught and Sahila is happy to see her father Sameer Pratap alive
 satish, ain vakt main pahunch jaataa he, jo viraane tak peechha karata hua unki jaan bhi bachaata he
 And then, Sameer starts walking with his children to meet his brother Saab directly
 thakur mahendra apane priy bhai ko sahi salaamat paakar behad romanchit hote hai
 Then Sahila and Hemant narrate the conspiracies related to that Baba and Sameer informs his brother that Baba has only helped to shelter the soul of that evil Daran in Yasmin's body and now that night has become a dangerous nightmare
 is
 isi madhyantar main, baba amavasya kii raat yasmine kii jaan lene kii yojana banaate he taaki dian ko dubaara jivit kiya jaae or amar kiya jaae
 He picks up Yasmin from the mansion and takes it to the devilish den and arranges a havan-yagna to offer her sacrifice
 par jald hi uskaa parivaar us kshan tak pahunch jaataa he
 Then, in order to get the witch out of Yasmin's body, they destroy the wudu dolls locked in that bottle
 magar, is badakismati se, bade thakur ko apni beti kii khushiyon or lambey vakt tak chale jivan kii ladaai vah haar baithte he
 The family almost drowns in momentary mourning and then, not knowing, the witch wakes up with her body in a very insidious manner, but with the symbol of the holy '4', they also lock her in the tomb again
 tab thakur parivaar or saare gaanv vaale us tabut ko bhagwaan shiv ke mandir le chalate hai
 Tabut is brought into the courtyard inside the temple and Sameer Pratap opens it with Hemant's help
 donon ladakiyon ko baahar hi rakhaa jaataa he
 The witch comes out of her coffin and is frightened to find herself in front of Lord Mahashiva
 vah dard se cheekh padati he, or mandir se bhaagane kii koshish karti he magar apni sari shaktiyaan ganvaa baithti he or jameen par pachhadkar gir padati he
 a few moments later, she starts burning and is almost destroyed forever
 is tarah bache hue thakur parivaar or hemanth ek nai evam sukhad jivan kii shuruyaat karte hai

 use dar laga ki kustutuniya par rus kaa adhikaar ho jane par sthal maarg se bharat ke liye sthaayee khatra utpann ho jayega or yah aisa khatra hoga jiskaa kisi prakaar bhi saamana karnaa uske liye sambhav na hoga
 He stood up to help Turkey against Russia
 france ke liye to rusht hone kaa spasht kaaran tha hi
 Russia is interfering with the right to care for its shrines
 kintu isse bada kaaran yah tha ki jaar nicholas pratham ne france ke nae samrat ko ‘bhai’ sambodhit na kar ‘mitra’ sambodhit kiya tha
 Therefore, seeing the favor of the greek-christian sect of Russia, he saw a threat to his dynasty
 austria ko bhi balcon kii ore roosi badhaav se ghabrahat hui
 Although in 1849, Austria received his ancestral throne with Russian military aid, it did not seem appropriate to accept Russia's gratitude and remain silent on this occasion
 uskaa jhukaav france or england kii ore hone laga
 He turned down Russia's challenge at the behest of the British ambassador
 iskaa jo parinaam hona tha hua
 In July 1853, the Russian army marched and took possession of the provinces of Moldova and Balesia, the territory of Turkey north of the Danube River
 tatkaal england or france kaa sanyukt nausenic bedaa turki kii sahaayta ke liye bosphorus pahunchaa; kintu angareji or francisi yupoton ke dekhte dekhte sinope ke nikat roosi nausena ne turki ke bede ko nasht kar diya
 Then, in early January 1854, a joint fleet of England and France entered Kalasagar and the two countries soon declared war against Russia
 unhone apni rakshaatmak yuddh karne kii yojana banaai
 To protect Kustuntunia, he decided to build fortifications at Gallipoli
 kintu iske purv ki angl-french senaayen kalasagar ke pashchimi tat par varna main ekatra hon, austria ke amaitreepurn rukh ko dekhakar rus ne apni sena ko turki ke adhikrut pradeshon se waapas bula liya
 Thus ended the possibility of an invasion of Turkey by Russia
 falat: england or france kii sthiti visham ho gai
 Violent cholera spread in Varna
 sena vahaan chodi nahin ja sakati thi
 On the other hand, the return of his army to India without fighting was a sign of inferiority of the rulers of both the countries
 at: kuch karne kii dhun main unhone kreemia par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Russia had a naval base at Sevastopol on its southern coast
 use adhikaar main karnaa unhone apana lakshya banaaya
 The two countries took a harsh decision, but neither of them had any knowledge about the territory of Crimea
 utsaahi france ne jab is kathinaayee kaa anubhav kiya tab usne planchet par napolian mahaan kii aatma ko bulaakar usase salaah lene kii baat kii
 The maps Raffet prepared for Sevastopol and Balaklava were studied; Ranview-expert Gemini was consulted but no encouraging news came out
 asafalataa kii hi sambhaavnaayen jaan padi
 Here the British Cabinet did not see any need for serious thinking
 usne kreemia ke nakshe par saamaanya dhang se drushtipaat kiya or kaha ki topon ke bal par sthaldam degree ke avaruddh kar kreemia ke prayadweep ko mukhya bhubhag se kaat dena koi kathin kaam nahin he
 Till then he did not know that there is no more than two-three feet of water in the sea on either side of the degree of land
 unhone yuddh ke liye aadesh jari kar die
 The armies reached Eupotoria on 14 September
 17 sitambar ko unhone sevastopol kii or badhanaa aarambh kar diya
 On 20 September, he defeated the Russian army, but with no conclusive results
 roosi senapati tadelben ne sevastopol ke durg main ghuskar durg kii raksha kii puri taiyaari kar lee
 The anglo-french army laid siege to the fort
 aage koi karrwai ve kar paaen, iske purv jaada aa gaya; samuchit khanepine, vasradi kii vyavastha ke abhaav main sainik dayaneey sthiti main pad gaye
 The situation of the English army became worse
 jo jahaaj unke lise saamaan laa rahe the ve balklawa ke bandargah main bhayankar samudri tufaan main padakar nasht ho gaye
 By the end of the year, 8,000 soldiers fell ill
 aspataalon kii sthiti beemaari ko ghataane ke bajaay badhaanevaali thi
 Less than half of the men survived
 jab florence nite angel mahila swayansevikaon ko lekar pahaunchi or bimaaron kii sevasushrusha kii vyavastha kii tab kahin sthiti main kuch sudhaar hua
 When winter subsided, another problem arose
 taar ke avishkaar se twarit sampark sthapit karne kii suvidha ho gai
 Therefore, the orders which reached the headquarters of both the countries in ten days, now started arriving in 24 hours
 is suvidha kaa upyog england or france ne alag alag dhang se kiya
 For England, military failure meant nothing more than a rearrangement in the cabinet
 at: yuddh vibhaag ne uskaa upyog keval apane captain jevis ke swasthya ke prati chintaa vyakt karne main kiya
 But for the Emperor of France, defeat was a message of the destruction of the dynasty
 at: ve apane senapati ko danaadan suzav, salaah or aadesh bhejne lage
 As a result, the generals of both the countries were unable to get up from the table and think of anything else due to this kind of exchange of wires
 phir bhi april aate aate un logon ne sevastopol ke ghere kii gati teevr karne kii cheshtaa kii
 In June, the English army attacked Redan and the French army attacked Melekaf but the Russians thwarted both attacks
 kintu jab aangl-french sena ne kinberne par adhikaar kar liya tab rus ne yuddh jari rakhana vyarth samajha
 By this time, the French king Napoleon was also afraid of this war
 vah aage yuddh karne ke paksh main na tha
 But the British, who had failed in the attack of Sevastopol, were upset
 ve yuddh jari rakhana chaahate the kintu akele rus se yuddh kar sakna unke bas kii baat na thi
 The diagnosis occurred in Paris
 is sandhi main anya baton ke atirikt mukhya baat yah thi ki danube nadi main sabhi deshon ke jahaajon ke liye yatayaat khol diya gaya; kalasagar tatasth kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya; prayek desh ke yupoton kaa vahaan aana nishiddh kar diya gaya
 In other words, Russia had to withdraw its warship from Kalasagar; But within fifteen years these things of the treaty became meaningless
 vienna congress ke pashchaat kreemia yuddh europe itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana tha
 As a result of this war, on one side, Russia's Turkish plan failed, on the other hand, Turkey got new life
 italy or germany ke ekikaran rus kii raajnneeti balkan prayadweep ke purna nirmaan evam antarrashtriya raajnneeti par is yuddh kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 There were many reasons for this war
 jo is prakaar he
 Russian policy 19 veen shatabdi main turki samrajya kaa patan hota ja rahaa tha
 Taking advantage of this, various European nations wanted to divide it among themselves
 rus iske liye vishesh prayatnsheel tha
 He began to take a keen interest in Turkey's case
 rus chahta tha
 That Turkey be weakened so that it could expand its empire in the Balkan region
 at: usne balcon prayadweep ke praja ko turki ke khilaaf andolan ke liye bhadakaayaa
 Russia's objective was to end Turkey
 or turki samrajya ke khandhar par k vishaal rusi samrajya kaa mahal khadaa karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, whenever he got the chance, Russia proposed to split Turkey against the European
 britain kaa swaarth- England was a strong opponent of Russia's ambition
 kyonki bhumadhya sagar main rus kaa pravesh englad ke liye sankat utpann kar saktaa tha
 At the same time, the Indian Empire of England could also be in danger due to Russia's authority over Turkey
 isliye bhartiya samrajya kii suraksha ke liye turki ko rus ke adhikaar main jane se bachaane ke liye uski ahm bhoomika thi
 England never wanted it to expand eastward
 halanki rus ne england ko apni ore milaane kii cheshtaa kii lekin use safalataa nahin mil saki
 Even after various attempts, when England could not be in favor of Russia, he started planning to annex Turkey by the sword
 france kaa swaarth- France was also eyeing Europe's ailing nation Turkey
 lui nepolian yuddh niti ke dwaara france kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha
 He began to interfere in Turkey's case
 kreemia yuddh kaa shutrapat nepolian ke isi niti ke falswarup hua
 Mohammal Ali's Rebellion and European Nations Intervention in Turkey- mohammad ali mishra kaa governor tha
 Who was the suzerain of the Turkish Empire
 parantu mohammad ali ek swatantra shaasha tha
 Despite Turkey's aid in Greece's freedom struggle, it did not benefit her
 at: vah syria ke viruddh sainik kaarywahi kii
 The Turkish Sultan was terrified at this
 usne rus se sahaayatka praapt kii
 This led to disharmony among the various nations and the leading European countries began to pressurize Turkey to withdraw the Russian army to make a pact with Mohammad Ali
 samjhauta ke falswarup mohammad ali ko syria de diya gaya
 Here, Russia wanted some prize from Turkey in return for his help
 1832 main usne turki ke saath ek sandhi kii jiske dwaara turki par rus kaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 England was alarmed by the incident and called a conference of European states in London
 sabhi rashtron ne ek sandhi patr par hastakshar kiya
 As a result, Russia's influence on Turkey decreased somewhat
 iske pashchaat lagbhag das varshon tak shanti kaayam rahi parantu france main lui nepolian kaa jamaana aayaa to usne rus ke isaai kaa padriyon kaa paksh lekar purvi samasya ko ubhaarna shuru kiya cremia yuddh isaki kaa parinaam tha
 Religious reasons isaai kaa pavitra jerusalem turki samrajya ke adheen tha
 Saints of the Roman and Greek churches lived there
 unke saath turki sultan kaa vyavhaar acha nahin tha at: 1742 ke sandhi ke anusaar roman sanyasi kii raksha kaa bhaar rus par kar diya gaya
 But chaos erupted in France as a result of the French Revolution
 to unani padri ne roman carch par akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Louis Napoleon began to dedicate the Roman clergy, and Russia began to side with the Greek clergy
 at: purvi samasya bigadane lagi
 Diplomacy tension prevailed in Europe over this problem for three years
 rus europe main kutniti tanaav vyapt rahaa
 Russia wanted to invade Turkey by making religious pretext and seizing its territories
 1853 main rus ne turki par akraman kiya tathaa noladavia or belaysia par adhipaty kar liya
 On Russia, England and France assure Turkey of assistance; Turkey assures Turkey
 On 27 February 1854, England and France jointly warned Russia that Russia should vacate the territory of Turkey
 lekin santosh janak uttar na milane ke kaaran donon ne rus ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This war was the war of Crimea
 jisamen ek ore england, france or turki tathaa dusri rus oly bilkul akelaa tha yah yuddh do varshon tak chalata rahaa
 There was immense loss of money
 rus kii jabardast paraajay hui
 The war ended by the Treaty of Paris in March 1856
 is prakaar yuddh man mistra rashtron kii vijay or rus kii paraajay hui
 On 30 March 1856, the Paris Treaty was signed by representatives from England, France, Austria, Turkey, Servia and Russia
 jiske anusaar kalasagar kii tatasth kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya
 All the rivers were internationalized
 mol divia or bolegia par rus kaa sangrakshan samaapt kar diya gaya
 Servia's independence was guaranteed
 turki ko europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil kar liya gaya
 And accepted its integrity and independence
 kreemia yuddh europea itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 Two types of conceptions have been expressed about this war
 rabart merriott ne ise aadhunik yug kaa purn vyarth yuddh bataaya tha, unhone likhaa he
 "the only perfectly useless modern war that has been waged
" Lord Cromer says the opposite
 ‘yadi kreemia yuddh nahin hota to turki par rus kaa adhipaty kaayam ho jaataa’ da
 em
 kedelvi ne likhaa he
 As a result of the Crimea War, Russia's Turkish plans were halted
 rus kii jabardast paraajay hui
 Turkey got new life under the protection of Europe Napoleon's attack froze
 england kaa rashtriya rin bad gaya or austria ne ek mahaan desh kii shatru mol lee
 Robert Morritt's view seems to be in part excusable
 kreemia yuddh ke pashchaat turki kaa patan avashyabhanvi ho gaya
 Servia was granted independence
 yah anya paradheen deshon ke liye prerana strot sabit hua
 And foreigners became restless for their freedom
 kreemia yuddh kaa pramukh uddeshy rus ko kamjor bananaa tha
 But even this objective could not be successful
 yah sochna ki rus aage chajalkar shant ho jayega galat sabit hua
 As soon as he got the chance, he plunged into the former problem again
 The purpose of the Treaty of Paris was to curb Russian ambitions and to keep Turkey alive, but this could not be an angel either
 at: yah kaha ja saktaa he
 That the war was fought for the purposes for which it was fought
 us drushti se yah vyarth sabit hua
 England or France did not benefit anyone
 parantu itnaa hote hue bhi kreemia yuddh ko purna vyarth yuddh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In fact its indirect result proved to be far-reaching and important
 ketolavi likhaa he
 "it is indirect results were greater out of the mud of Cremica new Italy way made and less of obviously a new Germany" Indeed, this war had such a definite effect on the events of the 19th century that the importance built in Vienna in 1815
 His foundation was shaken
 turki par prabhaav- As a result of this war, Turkey got new life
 vah europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil ho gaya
 His integrity and independence were accepted
 rus kaa bhay samaapt ho gaya
 Effect on Russia is yuddh ne rus kii sainik shakti ko aghat pahunchaaya or jaar shahi kii kamajori ko ujagar kar diya
 He had to suffer even more damage, the idea of the historian Hojan
 ‘is rashtriya apmaan main bhavishya kii aashaaen nihit thi
 Just as the army was completely formed after the defeat of the army, so was the reconstruction of Russia, it is an important event of the historian of Russia
 kyonki is paraajay ke baad hi yahan vyapak sudhaar hua parantu kreemia yuddh kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parinaam yah hua ki iskaa kustuntuniya par adhikaar karne or kaala sagar ko rusi jhil banane kaa sapana bhang ho gaya
 Impact on England is yuddh main england kaa uddeshy pura ho gaya
 The expansion of Russia was banned but it caused huge loss of money to England and its national tax was given, which made it difficult to implement reform schemes
 france par prabhaav- The pride of France increased considerably in the wake of the war
 yuddh main rus kii paraajay hui
 Napoleon avenged France's defeat with Russia
 italy par prabhaav- This war also had an impact on Italy and Germany
 If this war had not taken place, Italy and Germany would not have been unified, in fact, Italy was greatly benefited by this war
 austria par prabhaav- England and France were unhappy with Austria's adoption of a policy of neutrality
 rus bhi naaraaz ho gaya
 Austria became friendless and no one was left with her

 Salahuddin Owaisi, father of Asaduddin Owaisi, was also a politician
 vah do dashak se bhi adhik tak hyderabad ke saansad rahe
 Owaisi was born on 13 May 1969 to Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi and Najmunessa Begum
 vah hyderabad ke ek raajnneetik parivaar se aata he
 His grandfather Abdul Wagh Owaisi reintroduced the political party majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen as All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen on 18 September 1957
 jail se reeha hone ke baad bhi vah party ke adhyaksh ke rup main kasim rajvi kaa pad sambhala
 His father Sultan Salahuddin was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1962
 1984 main pehali baar hyderabad nirvachan kshetra se bhartiya sansad ke liye chune gaye or 2004 tak chunaav jite rahe, jab unhone asaduddin ke paksh main pad chhod diya
 He died in 2008

 kai tippaneekaron ne ovaisi ko jinna kii tulana kii
 According to Patrick French, Owaisi appeals to a "non-sectarian Muslim identity" in a way similar to Jinnah's bid to be the sole spokesperson of the Muslim community
 unka rashtrawaad ke saath islamvaad kaa brands hyderabad puraane shahar or mumbai main muslim yuvakon ke kattarpanth ke sambhavit kshetron main panapata he
 Owaisi cited the fact that his fight was within the framework of the Indian Constitution
 unka kahana he ki bharat kii dharmanirpeksh partiyaan apane voton ko muslim ummidavaaron ko sthanantarit karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Of the 23 Muslim mps elected in 2014, 18 or 30% of the 19 constituencies were Muslim voters
 jabaki partiyaan musalamaanon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav nahin karne kaa daawa karti hai, ve pratha main musalamaanon ko "yahudee basti kii sthiti" main chhod dete hai
 Therefore, Muslims should develop their own political party, similar to obcs, Dalits and Yadavs
 2008 ke mumbai ke hamalon ke baad, ovaisi ne nirdosh logon kii hatya ke liye jackieur rahamaan lakhvi or hafiz said ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii unhone kaha ki desh ke dushman musalamaanon ke dushman hai
 Owaisi supports reservation for backward Muslims in government jobs and educational institutions
 vah yah bhi kehete hai ki vah hindutvvaadi vichaardhaara ke khilaaf hai lekin hinduon ke khilaaf nahin hai
 Owaisi says there is an argument to use the money for the education of Muslim women on religious pilgrimage to visit Mecca to eradicate the Haj subsidy to Indian Muslims
 july 2016 main, ovaisi ko yah sweekaar karne ke liye unke bhaashan ke liye prashansa kii gai ki islamic rajya iraq or levent musalamaanon ke bich ek samasya he or unhen narak ke kute kehete hai
 Owaisi said in his speech, which was given to monitor what is being said from some mosques after the 2016 Saudi Arabia bombing, and who is injecting radical poison

 Ram is highly revered and an ideal man, especially in North India

 Rama was the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya

 Sri Ram's father Dasharatha had pledged his step-mother Kaikeyi to fulfill any of his two wishes

 Many festivals of Hinduism, such as Dussehra, Ram Navami and Deepawali, are associated with the life story of Rama
 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened
 puraanon main shri ram ke janm ke bare main spasht pramaan milte ki shri ram kaa janm vartmaan uttar pradesh ke faijabad jile ke ayodhya naamak nagar main hua tha

 Rama was a brave man of quiet nature since childhood
 unhone maryaadaaon ko hameshaa sarvocch sthaan diya tha
 For this reason, he is known as Maryada Purushottam Rama

 As a technology, electronics is the field which deals with the construction of suitable electrical circuits using various electronic devices, etc
) and through them to convert the electrical signals in the desired manner
 isamen tarah-tarah kii yuktiyon kaa adhyayan, unamem sudhaar tathaa nayi yuktiyon kaa nirmaan aadi bhi shaamil he
 Historically, the field of electronics and electrical technology has been the same and both were not considered separate from each other
 kintu ab nayi-nayi yuktiyon, paripathon evam unke dwaara sampadit kaaryon main atyadhik vistaar ho jane se electranix ko vaidyut praudyogiki se alag shakha ke rup main padhaaya jane laga he
 In this view, the fields related to high electric power are considered under electrical technology, while the field related to the changes in low electric power and electric signals are called electronics

 But the foundation of electronics was laid long ago

 There are many methods of propaganda
 dushprachaar kaa uddeshy soochna dene ke bajaay logon ke vyavhaar or raay ko prabhavit karnaa hota he
 Propaganda literally means propaganda, propaganda or propaganda in Hindi
 propaganda kisi vishesh uddeshy se, vishesh taur se raajnneetik uddeshy ke tahat, kisi vichaar or najariye ko failaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But its foundation usually does not depend on truth
 propaganda kii shuruyaat yuddh ke dauraan dushman kii sena ko naitik rup se parajeet karne ke liye ek afawaah ke rup main hui thi
 Then it is mentioned that in 1622, the fifteenth Pope Gregory took over the propaganda work against the Protestant Reforms in the Vatican
 propaganda kii chhavi nakaaratmak us samay bani jab pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan british sarkaar ne apane raajnneetik hiton ke patr main vyavasthit rup se propaganda kiya
 Later, it was also used for campaigning
 prarambh main ise raajnneetik partiyon ke chunaav-prachaar ke dauraan pratyaashee ke hit main samarthan khinchne ke liye istemaal hota tha
 Subsequently, considering its usefulness, it expanded and became a part of advertising
 vigyaapan ke saath judane par propaganda main sakaaratmak paksh bhi aayaa
 He began to play the role of the bearer of a pleasant feeling that touched emotions and became creative in a particular context
 propaganda dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi soochna kaa aadhaar aitihaasik rup se sakaaratmak na hokar hameshaa se hi nakaaratmak rahaa he
 The information given through it is often one-sided and misleading in nature
 propaganda kaa upyog raajnneetik kaarnon se kisi drushtikon-vishesh ko badhaava dene ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 Today the pane of propaganda has become very widespread and it is deliberately being used to spread negative information about a person, institution, nation, product or any political party
 propaganda kaa doosraa paksh yah he ki ise ek vishesh prakaar ke sandesh ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 In the form of a message that is propagated through a slogan etc
 to propagate a particular culture, philosophy, idea or opinion in the market and society
 yuddh ke dauraan jhooth ko sach sabit karne ke liye propaganda kaa upyog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 America is considered the largest user of this propaganda
 vah yuddh ke dauraan hameshaa aisi khabar failaata he ki vah maanavtaa kii raksha or aatankwaad se ladane ke liye yuddh kar rahaa he, jabaki uskaa makasad kuch or hota he
 The biggest example of this is seen in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan in the last two decades
 america hameshaa yah bataata rahaa ki aatankwaad se ladane ke liye aisa karnaa zaruri tha jabaki sachai yah thi ki vah apane sainikon ke saath-saath aise patrakaron kii fuj bhi lekar chal rahaa tha jo uske paksh ke the yaa jinhen kareed liya gaya tha
 These journalists kept broadcasting information which was not true in the name of showing their news live
 aisi patrakarita ko hi jadit patrakarita yaa imbadid jarnalizam kaha jaataa he
 In such journalism, reporting is done as per the wishes of one party and the truth is lost
 kai baar is is patrakarita kaa upyog raajnneetik partiyon dwaara apane paksh main janamat banane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some communicators believe that propaganda originated after the development of mass media
 ve ise sanchaar ke hisse ke rup main dekh kar maanate hai ki janamat ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye kiya jane vaala sanchaar propaganda kaa ek prakaar he
 Here it is necessary to consider the relation of communication and propaganda
 ikkisvin sadi ke praarambhik daur main radio ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko ek vishesh oochaal diya
 Through the radio, your talk can be reached to a wider audience in a very short time
 radio ke vikaas ne swayan-prerit or pryojit soochna ko failaane kaa hi kaam nahin kiya, varan isane us vigyaapan kaa bhi sutarapaatr kiya jiske viksit rup aaj vibhinn roopon main hamaare saamne hai
 In such a short time before the development of radio, it was impossible to reach directly to a wider audience
 yah zarur he ki print madhyam dwaara bhi sidhe taur par soochna kaa sampreshan kiya ja saktaa tha, lekin samachar patron ke pathak kam hi the
 The condition of literacy was also associated with becoming a reader
 radio ne vigyaapan ke ek naveen sansar kaa anaavaran kiya jahaan padhane kii yogyata hona zaruri nahin tha
 This made the reach and influence of advertising unlimited
 vigyaapan ke saath-saath raajnneetik propaganda kaa bhi vistaar bahut teji se hua
 The arrival of TV to Propaganda after radio gave another new boom
 tivi ne radio ko apdasth to nahin kar paaya, lekin radio ke mukaable isaki vishwasaneeyata logon ko zyaada pramanik nazar aayi
 When big companies introduced their products exaggeratedly, people started seeing their image in that promotion
 isiilie vigyaapan guru alek padmasi ne ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke log jab kisi vastu ke graahak banate hai to vah tark se kam or bhaavana se zyaada banate hai
 He cites the example of Liril soap and said, 'what do you think this girl who is wearing a bikini bathing in a waterfall and feels refreshed like the smell of lemon smell, is it really possible in the villages and cities of real India The Where a bucket of water would have been destined to be bathed in a manner, how could it feel like the smell of lemon? On this basis, Padmasi says that through propaganda, advertising creates an image in front of the consumer in which consumers start seeing their image
 haal hi ke varshon main internet or i-mail ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko vaishvik vistaar diya
 Web-mediums, for example, have the power to make a local issue a global issue
 bhugolinta kii sari simaaon kaa web-madhyamon ne ulanghan karke sampoorn duniya ko ek chote se gaanv main tabdeel kar diya he
 In a moment, people have taken advantage of the Internet system to go from local to global
 ek sthaneey gayak or local sangeet kaise kuch samay main hi internet ke madhyam se sabase lokapriy sangeet ban jaataa he iskaa sabase shashakt udhaaharan he kolaberi di naamak geet
 In the language of marketing, what we know as viral marketing is actually propaganda in the language of media
 ek taraf to propegande ko nakaaratmak baat sakaaratmak dhang se pesh karne vaala madhyam kii tarah dekha jaataa he or duusari taraf propaganda prachaar kaa ek aisa hunar bhi he jisamen kisi vishay-vastu ko kuch is tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa he ki uski taraf log aakarshith ho jaaen
 The related subject should be presented through a language, rhythm and music that the common consumer feels connected to and associates with the product
 iske liye media ke vibhinya madhyamon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Such as: television, radio, banner, internet, billboard, leaflet, etc
 bhaawanaaon ko sparsh dene kii is bhoomika main nakaaratmak paksh sirf itnaa hi he ki aisa propaganda manushya kii taarkikta kaa sanhaar karke uski jagah par bhaavnaatmak paksh ko zyaada prabhavi bana detaa he
 Tristian Tolliver, an American advertising writer, has said about Propaganda: i always think of myself that people don't like what you did and did for them
 balki aapako hameshaa isliye yaad kiya jaataa he ki aapane apni baton ke madhyam se unhen kya mahasoos karaayaa
 For example, in Propaganda, it does not matter much how well you put something, but the most important thing is that the feeling and inspiration that comes out of it leaves a mark on people
 propaganda ke sukhad ehsaas main lambe samay tak yaad rakhe jane kii kshamta hoti he
 In this context, the use of propaganda in advertising has started giving it a positive form rather than just being negative
 is pahalu ke mutabik propaganda rachanaatmak prakruti kii avadharana par aadhaarit ek sampoorn prakriya kaa naam he
 How it is to be used - depends entirely on the user

 phisalane ke nishaan yaa skid nishaan vah nishaan he jab koi thos vastu jo duusare ke khilaaf chaalen
 Like a car
 skid sadakon par tair kii vajah se nishaan hote hai jab ek vaahan pahiyaa rolling band ho jaataa he or slide yaa sadak kii sataha par gumti he
 Skid points can be analyzed to find out the maximum and minimum vehicle speed before an impact or event

 The skid mark is called the "mark of acceleration" resulting from acceleration

 Skid scars can also come about when a car suddenly takes acceleration, or a hard corner, on a slippery surface
 skid nishaan vahaan bhi gathan kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan ek seedhi achaanak phisal jaataa he or upyogkarta jameen par gir jaataa he
 Such traces are important evidence for vehicle accident reconstruction
