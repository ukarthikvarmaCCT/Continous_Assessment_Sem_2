 It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the third largest planet by mass
 varun kaa dravyaman prithvi se 17 guna adhik he or apane padosi grah arun se thodaa adhik he
 According to the celestial unit, Varuna's orbit is at an average distance of 30
1 km from the sun, that is, Varun is about thirty times more than the sun in comparison to the Earth

 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"

 "neptune" was the god of the sea in the ancient Roman religion, the place of the god "varuna" in ancient India, so this planet is called Varuna in Hindi
 roman dharm main naptune ke haath main trishul hota tha isliye varun kaa khagolashastriy chinh ♆ he
 Where the planet Arun looks like just a sphere with no marks or spots on it, there is a clear cloud, storm and change of weather on Varun

 When the Voyager II vehicle passed by Varun in 1989, Varun saw a "big thick spot", which has been compared to Jupiter's "big red spots"
 kyonki varun suraj se itnaa dur he, isliye uskaa upree vayumandal bahut hi thanda he or vahaan kaa taapmaana -128 °centegrade tak gir saktaa he
 Due to its large size, the temperature of the planet reaches 5,000 ° c due to the severe pressure of its gravity in the center of the planet
 varun ke ird-gird kuch chhitare-se upgrahi challe bhi hai jinhen wayager dwitiya ne dekha tha
 The light blue color of Varuna comes from the methane gas present in its upper atmosphere

 On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first mass-centric En orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not show in its exact position in our skies, as the Earth was in a different location in its 365
25-day orbit
 Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 july Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011

 Just as darkness is cut off in front of the sunlight, similarly, hearing of Bhagavat Purana eliminates all the sufferings, diseases and inhibitions of human beings
 mahatmaon ne sutaji se bhagwat puraana ke sambandh main ye jigyaasaaen rakhin: By the combination of Maharishi Parashar and Goddess Satyavati, Anshvatar Dev Vyasji of Srinarayan was born
 vyasaji ne apane samay or samaaj kii sthiti pahachaanate hue vedon ko chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya or apane chaar patu shishyon ko unka bodh karaayaa
 After this, he created eighteen Puranas for the welfare of the male and female retarded women, who were deprived of the right to study, so that they too would be able to practice religion
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 shri krishna prasenjit ko dhundhane ke prayaas main kho gaye the jo shri devi bhagwati ke aashirwad se sakushal laut aae
 While narrating this account in detail with the wishes of the Maharishi, Mr
 Sutji started saying - Gentlemen Long ago, Bhojwanshi King Satrajit lived in Dwarka Puri
 surya kii bhakthi-aradhana ke bal par usne swamantak naam kii atyant chamakdaar mani praapt kii
 Due to the revolution of Mani, the king himself became sun-like

 The virtue of the self-styled gem was that the person holding it would receive eight kilos of gold per day
 us pradesh main kisi bhi prakaar kii maanviya yaa divine vipatti kaa koi chihn tak nahin tha
 Krishna himself aspired to receive the Swatantak Mani, but Satrajit rejected it
 ek baar satrajit kaa bhai prasenjit us mani ko dhaaran karke ghode par chadhakar shikaar ko gaya to ek singh ne use maar daalaa
 Incidentally, a bear named Jamwant killed Singh and he took Mani to his cave
 jamavant kii beti mani ko khilonaa samajhakar khilne lagi
 On Prasenjit's return, a rumor spread in Dwarka that Krishna was assassinated by Sranjith's refusal to grant Mani to Krishna and took possession of Mani
 krishna is afvaah se du:khee hokar prasenjit ko khojane ke liye nikal pade
 In the forest, Krishna and his companions found a lion dead along with Prasenjit
 unhen vahaan rich ke pairon ke nishaanon ke sanket bhi mili, jo bheetar gupha main pravesh ke suchak the
 With this Krishna speculated to kill Singh and near Mani's bear
 apane saathiyon ko baahar rahakar pratiksha karne ke liye kahkar swayan krishna gupha ke bheetar pravesh kar gaye
 After a long time, the returned companion, disheartened when Krishna did not return, falsely propagated the death of Krishna
 krishna ke na lautne par unke pita vasudev putr-shok main vyathit ho uthe
 At the same time Maharishi Narada came
 samachar jaanakar naradji ne vasudev se shrimad devi bhagwat puraana ke shravan kaa upadesh diya
 Vasudev was previously familiar with the grace of Mother Bhagwati
 unhone naradji se kaha-devarshi, devaki ke saath karagaravaas karte hue jab chha: putr kansa ke haathon maare ja chuke the to ham donon pati-patni kaaphi vyathit or ansatulit ho gaye the
 Then he consulted his clan priest Maharishi Garg and asked for a solution to get rid of trouble
 gurudev ne jagadamba maa kii gaatha kaa parayan karne ko kaha
 Being in prison was not possible for me
 at: gurudev se hi yah kaary sampann karaane kii prarthana kii
 Vasudev said - By accepting my prayer, Gurudev went to Vindhyachal mountain and worshiped the goddess with the Brahmins
 vidhi-vidhanpurvak devi bhagwat kaa nawahr yajna kiya
 On completion of the ritual, Gurudev informing me of this, said - Goddess has pleased this Akashvani - With my inspiration, Vishnu himself will incarnate the house of Vasudev Devaki to alleviate the suffering of the earth
 vasudev ko chahie ki us balak ko gokul gram ke nand-yashoda ke ghar pahunchaa den or usee samay utpann yashoda kii balika ko laakar aathvin santan ke rup main kansa ko saunp den
 Kans, as always, would throw the baby girl to the ground
 vah balika kansa ke haath se tatkaal chhootakar divya sharir dhaaran kar, mere hi ansh rup se lok kalyaan ke liye vidhyanchal parvat par vaas karegi
 On hearing this ritual fruit by Garga Muni, i expressed happiness and completed the following events according to Muni's statement and protected Krishna
 yah vivaran sunaakar vasudev naradji se kehane lage-muniver ! saubhaahgya se aapkaa aagaman mere liye shubh he
 Therefore, please oblige me by narrating the story of Goddess Bhagwat Purana
 vasudev ke kehane par naarad ne anugrah karte hue nawahr parayan kiya
 At the end of the ninth day, Vasudeva worshiped Naradji and when Krishna entered the cave from the Maya of Bhagwati's mother, he saw a girl playing with a gem
 jaise hi krishna ne balika se mani lee, to balika ro uthi
 Hearing the crying of the girl, Jamwant arrived there and started fighting with Krishna
 donon main sattaees din tak yuddh chalata rahaa
 By the grace of Goddess, Jamwant continued to suffer and Shri Krishna became powerful
 ant main unhone jamavant ko parajeet kar diya
 By the grace of Bhagwati, Jamwant had a prior memory
 treta main ravan kaa vadh karne vaale ram ko hi dwapar main krishna ke rup main avatarit jaanakar unki vandana kii
 Apologized for the crime committed in ignorance
 mani ke saath apni putree jambavati ko bhi prasantaapurvak krishna ko samarpit kar diya
 After the narrative ended in Mathura, Vasudev was taking blessings after the Brahmin banquet, at the same time Krishna reached there with Mani and Jambavati
 krishna ko vahaan dekhakar sabhi kii prasannataa kii koi seemaa na rahi

 In the revolutionary life of 11 years, he wrote many books and published them himself
 un pustakon ko bechakar jo paisa mila usase unhone hathiyaar kharide or un hathiyaaron kaa upyog british raaj kaa virodh karne ke liye kiya

 Due to family feud, Narayan Lal left his ancestral village with his wife Vichitra Devi and two sons - Muralidhar and Kalyanmal
 unke gaanv chhodane ke baad barbai main keval unke do bhai - amaan singh va samaan singh hi rah gayi jinke vanshaj aaj bhi usee gaanv main rahete hai
 Today, a statue of Ram Prasad Bismil has been installed by the Madhya Pradesh government in a park in Barabai village
 vahiin 'barbai' gram ko 'saansad adarsh gram yojana 'ke tahat bhi viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, a temple of Bismil in Morena and 'amar Shaheed Pt Ramprasad Bismil Museum' has also been built at the district headquarters, which provides information about the immortal martyrs of Chambal region and historical and ancient sites of the region
 kaalaantar main yah parivaar uttar pradesh ke aitihaasik nagar shahjahanpur aa gaya
 Narayan Lal got a job at an attar shop located near the gate of Munnuganj in Shahjahanpur for just three rupees a month
 itane kam paise main unke parivaar kaa guzaaraa nahin hota tha
 Bismil's grandmother, Vichitra Devi, started grinding grains to get her husband's hand
 yah silsilaa lagbhag do-teen varshon tak chalata rahaa
 Local people often addressed him as "pandit ji" due to his ethics, honesty and religious tendencies
 isse unhen ek laabh yah bhi hota tha ki prayek teej - tyohaar par daan - dakshina va bhojan aadi ghar main aa jaaya karata
 Meanwhile, Narayan Lal got a job in a school with the help of local residents for seven rupees monthly
 kuch samay pashchaat unhone yah naukari bhi chhod di or rejgaari bechney kaa kaarobaar shuru kar diya
 With this, they started earning five-seven daily

 After marriage, Muralidhar got a job in Shahjahanpur municipality at a monthly salary of Rs 15
 kintu unhen yah naukari pasand nahin aayi
 a few days later, he quit his job and started selling stamp paper in the court

 Three bullock carts started running on rent and also started lending money on interest

 "both the parents were of Leo zodiac and the child also looked like a lion-cub, so astrologers thought very carefully and suggested the name of Libra sign
 mata-pita donon hi ram ke aradhak the atah balak kaa naam ramprasad rakhaa gaya
 Mother Moolmati always said that she wanted a son like Rama
 balak ko ghar main sabhi log pyaar se ram kahkar hi pukaarte the
 Before the birth of Ramprasad, his mother had lost a son, so the use of witchcraft was also taken
 ek khargosh laayaa gaya or navjaat shishu ke upar se utaar kar aangan main chhod diya gaya
 The rabbit made two or four rounds of the courtyard and died instantly
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 Muralidhar had a total of 9 children, including five daughters and four sons
 aage chalakar do putriyon evam do putron kaa bhi dehant ho gaya
 From childhood, special attention was paid to the education of Ramprasad
 uskaa man khilne main adhik kintu padhane main kam lagata tha
 Because of this his father used to beat him a lot, but mother always used to explain with love that "son Ram! This is a very bad thing, don't do it
" " is pyaar bhari sikh kaa uske man par kahin na kahin prabhaav avashya padataa
 His father first made the letter sense of Hindi, but neither did he learn to read an owl from u nor showed it by writing
 un dinon hindi kii varnmaala main u se ullu hi padhaayaa jaataa tha
 He was opposed to this and in return also ate his father's body
 haar kar use urdu ke skool main bhartee kara diya gaya
 Perhaps this natural quality can make Ramprasad a revolutionary
 lagbhag 14 varsh kii aayu main ramprasad ko apane pita kii sandukchi se rupee churaane kii lat pad gayi
 With the stolen money, he started reading by buying novels etc
 and also got used to smoking cigarettes and offering cannabis
 kul milakar rupee - chori kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa or ramprasad ab urdu ke premuras se paripurna upanyaason va gajalon kii pustaken padhane kaa aadi ho gaya tha
 Incidentally one day Ramprasad was caught stealing because of cannabis being drunk
 khub pitayee hui, upanyaas va anya kitaaben faad daali gayin lekin rupee churaane kii aadat nahin chhuti
 Later, when he understood a little, only then could he be free from this badness
 ramprasad ne urdu middle kii pariksha main uteern na hone par angreji padhanaa prarambh kiya
 At the same time, a priest of the neighborhood got Ramprasad knowledge of the method of worship
 pujari ek sulajhe hue vidwaan vyakti the
 His personality also had an impact on the life of Ramprasad
 pujari ke upadeshon ke kaaran ramprasad puja-paath ke saath brahmacharya kaa paalan karne laga
 Ramprasad also started exercising after seeing the priest
 kishoravastha kii jitani bhi kubhaavnaayen evam buree aadaten man main thim ve bhi chhot gayin
 Cigarette smoking did not stop
 parantu vah bhi kuch dinon baad vidhyalay ke ek sahpaathee sushilchandra sen kii satsangati se chhot gayi
 After giving up cigarettes, Ramprasad's mind started studying
 bahut sheeghra hi vah angreji ke paanchaven darze main aa gaye
 There was an unexpected change in Ramprasad
 sharir sundar va balishtha ho gaya tha
 Time was spent in regular worship
 isi dauraan vah mandir main aane vaale munshi indrajit se uskaa sampark hua
 Munshi Indrajit told Ramprasad about the Arya Samaj and gave the book Satyarth Prakash written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 satyarth prakaash ke gambheer adhyayan se ramprasad ke jivan par ascharyajanak prabhaav padaa
 When Ramprasad was an eighth grade student at Government School Shahjahanpur, then by chance, Swami Somdev came to the Arya Samaj Bhavan
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko swamiji kii seva main niyukt kar diya
 It was here that changes in both the condition and direction of his life began
 ek ore satyarth prakaash kaa gambheer adhyayan va duusari ore swami somdev ke saath raajnneetik vishyon par khuli charchaa se unke man main desh-prem kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 At the Congress session of 1916, when Ramprasad took out the procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire Lucknow city, while disguising the order of the late Pt
 adhiveshan ke dauraan unka parichay keshav baliram headgavar, somdev sharma va mukundilal aadi se hua
 Later these same Somdev Sharma along with some Siddhagopal Shukla also published a book from the Nagari Sahitya Library, Kanpur titled - History of American Independence
 yah pustak babu ganeshprasad ke prabandh se kurmi press, lakhanu main san 1916 main prakashit hui thi
 Ramprasad published this book from his mother with two hundred rupees in two times
 iskaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 This book was confiscated as soon as it was printed and later when the Kakori case was prosecuted, this book was presented as evidence
 ab yah pustak sampadit karke sarfaroshi kii tamanna naamak granthavali ke bhaag-teen main sankalit kii ja chuki he or teen murti bhawan pustkaalay, nai-dilli sahit kai anya pustakaalayon main dekhi ja sakati he
 On hearing the news of the hanging of Bhai Parmanand in 1915, Ramprasad had pledged to destroy the British Empire, a book had come out in 1916, some young men had joined him, they had also received the blessings of Swami Somdev
 ek sanghathan unhone pan gendaalal dikshit ke maargdarshan main matruvedi ke naam se khud khadaa kar liya tha
 a commercial and a pledge were also published on behalf of this organization

 At the Congress session held in front of the Red Fort in Delhi from 26 to 31 December 1918, the youth of this organization started selling books as soon as they started raiding the police, but Bismil's intelligence saved all the books
 pandit gendaalal dikshit kaa janm yamuna kinare sthit may gaanv main hua tha
 He was a teacher in the DAV school of Auraiya, a famous town in Etawah district
 deshbhakti kaa junun savaar hua to shivaji samiti ke naam se ek sanstha bana lee or hathiyaar ekatra karne shuru kar diye
 He was caught bringing weapons to Agra

 After the merger of Bismil's maternal institution with the Shivaji Committee, the two worked together
 ek baar pun: pakade gayi, police peeche padi thi, bhaag kar dilli chale gayi jahaan unka praanant hua
 Bismil has given a very touching description of Pandit Gendalal ji in his autobiography
 mainpuri shadyantra main shahjahanpur se 6 yuvak shaamil hue the jinke leader ramprasad bismil the kintu ve police ke haath nahin aaye, tatkaal faraar ho gayi
 On 1 November 1919, Magistrate b s Chris pronounced the Mainpuri conspiracy

 ram prasad bismil ne yahan ke ek chote se gaanv rampur jaagir main sharan lee or kai maheene yahan ke nirjan jangalon main ghoomte hue gaanv ke gujaron kii gaay bhens charaayi
 He has described this very interestingly in the second volume of his autobiography: Swadesh Prem
 yaheen rahakar unhone apana krantikari upanyaas bolshevikon kii karatuut likhaa
 In fact, this novel is originally a Hindi-translation of the book nihilist-rahasya written in Bangla language, whose language and style are both very interesting
 aravind ghosh kii ek ati uttam bangla pustak yogic saadhan kaa hindi - anuwaad bhi unhone bhumigat rahete hue hi kiya tha
 In those days, the land on the banks of Yamuna was considered safe to escape from the police, so Bismil made full use of that safe place
 vartmaan samay main yah gaanv chunki greater noida ke beta van sector ke antargat aata he at: uttar pradesh sarkaar ne rampur jaagir gaanv ke kshetra main aane vaali van vibhaag kii arakshit bhoomi par unki smriti main amar shahid pan ram prasad bismil udyaan viksit kar diya he jisaki dekharekh greater noida prashasan ke vitt-poshan se pradesh kaa van vibhaag karata he
 a feature of 'bismil' was also that they did not stay at any place for long
 kuch din rampur jaagir main rahakar apni sagi bahan shastri devi ke gaanv kosma jila mainpuri main bhi rahe
 Interestingly, even his own sister could not recognize him
 kosma se chalakar bah pahunche
 After a few days, then from Pinhat, Agra, went to Barabai, his grandfather's village located in the princely state of Gwalior
 unhone vahaan kisaan ke bhes main rahakar kuch dinon hal bhi chalaaya
 While living in exile, he translated the English book The Grandmother of Russian Revolution published in 1918 in Hindi

 In September 1920, he joined the Calcutta Congress as an authorized representative of the Shahjahanpur Congress Committee

 When Lala ji saw the books written by him, he was very impressed with them
 unhone unka parichay kalakatta ke kuch prakashkon se kara diya jinamein ek umadutt sharma bhi the, jinhone aage chalakar san 1922 main ram prasad bismil kii ek pustak catherine chhaapi thi

 is kaaran ve yuvaaon main kaaphi lokapriy ho gayi
 The volunteers of Shahjahanpur played an important role in starting the non-cooperation movement throughout the country

 Gandhi always used to call the young men of rebellious ideology in the Congress general meetings due to their opposition
 ek baar to unhone jawaharlal nehru ko patr likhakar krantikari navayuvakon kaa saath dene par buree tarah fatkaar bhi lagaayi thi
 In January 1923, wealthy people like Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das formed a Swaraj Party
 navayuvakon ne tadarth party ke rup main revolutionari party kaa elaan kar diya
 In the special Congress session of Delhi held in September 1923, the disgruntled youths decided that they too would start interfering in politics by fixing their party's name and constitution etc
 Otherwise the loot system would dominate in the name of democracy in the country
 dekha jaye to us samay unki yah badi doordarshee soch thi
 The well-known revolutionary Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad Bismil since the time of Swami Somdev
 lala ji ne hi patr likhakar ram prasad bismil ko shachindranath sanyaal va yadu gopal mukherjee se milakar nayi party kaa samvidhan taiyaar karne kii salaah di thi
 Following the advice of Lala ji, Ram Prasad went to Allahabad and prepared the party's constitution at Shachindranath Sanyal's house
 navgathit party kaa naam sankshep main ech aar e rakhaa gaya va iskaa samvidhan pile rang ke parche par chhap karke sadasyon ko bheja gaya
 On 3 October 1924, an executive-meeting of this party was held in Kanpur, in which many prominent members of Shachindranath Sanyal, Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Ram Prasad Bismil etc
 attended
 is baithak main party kaa netritv bismil ko saunpkar sanyaal va chatarji bengal chale gayi
 Due to the difficulty of collecting funds for the party, the method of revolutionaries of Ireland was adopted and the first robbery was committed by the party in Bamrauli on 25 December 1924, which was efficiently led by Bismil
 iskaa ullekh chif court of avadh ke faisle main miltaa he
 Ram Prasad Bismil in the 4-page pamphlet "the Revolutionary", published by the revolutionary party from an anonymous place on 1 January 1925 and distributed to all the major places in India from 28 to 31 January 1925, under the pseudonym Vijay Kumar Disclosing in writing the ideology of the party, it was declared in clear terms that what kind of change in the governance system of this country can be revolutionized Want to run and what can they do for it? Not only this, while mocking Gandhi's policies, he also asked why the person who calls himself spiritual is afraid to talk openly to the British? He had given an open call to all the youth of India to join the revolutionary party by advising such pseudo-mahatma not to fall under the influence of the British
 di revolutionari ke naam se angreji main prakashit is krantikari main krantikariyon ke vaicharik chintan* ko bhalee-bhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 The infamous Hindi poetry of this paper is now also available on Hindi Wikisource
 di revolutionari naam se prakashit is 4 prishthiya ghoshnaptr ko dekhte hi british sarkaar iske lekhak ko bengal main khojane lagi
 Incidentally, Shachindra Nath Sanyal was arrested in Bankura when he was going to post this manifesto to a colleague
 isi prakaar yogeshchandra chatarji kanpur se party kii meeting karke jaise hi haavda stesan par train se utre ki ech aar e ke samvidhan kii dher sari pratiyon ke saath pakad liye gayi
 He was imprisoned in Hazaribagh jail
 donon pramukh netaaon ke giraftaar ho jane se ram prasad bismil ke kandhon par uttar pradesh ke saath-saath bengal ke krantikari sadasyon kaa uttardaayitv bhi aa gaya
 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa pehle bhi thi kintu ab to or bhi adhik bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money was not received from anywhere, he committed two political dacoities on 7 March 1925 in Bichpuri and on 24 May 1925 in Dwarkapur
 parantu unhen unamem kuch vishesh dhan praapt nahin ho sakaa
 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko apaar ksht hua
 Finally, he made sure that he would now only loot the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India
 shahjahanpur main unke ghar par 7 agast 1925 ko hui ek immergency meeting main nirnay lekar yojana bani or 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur railway stesan se bismil ke netritv main kul 10 log, jinamein ashfak ulla khan, rajendra lahidi, chandrasekhar aaazaad, shachindranath bakshi, manmathanath gupt, mukundi laal, keshav chakravarti, murari sharma tathaa banavaari laal shaamil the, 8 down saharanpur-lakhanu paisanger railgadee main savaar hue
 In addition to the pistols, all of them had four German-made Mauser pistols, with a butt in the butt that looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front
 in moujaron kii maarak kshamta bhi saadhaaran pistolon se adhik hoti thi
 In those days, these mausers were known like today's A-47 rifles
 lakhanu se pehle kakori railway stesan par ruk kar jaise hi gaadi aage badi, krantikariyon ne chen khinchakar use roak liya or guard ke dibbe se sarkari khajaane kaa baksaa neeche gira diya
 An attempt was made to open it but when it did not open, Ashfaq Ulla Khan grabbed his master Manmath Nath Gupt and took the hammer and broke the box
 manmathanath gupt ne utsukathavash moujar kaa trigar dabaa diya jisase chhuti goli ahamed ali naam ke musafir ko lag gayi
 He piled on the spot
 shighratavash chaandi ke sikkon va noton se bhare chamade ke thile chaadaron main baandhakar vahaan se bhaagane main ek chadar vahiin chhot gayi
 The next day this news spread through the newspapers through the whole world
 british sarkaar ne is train dakaiti ko gambheertha se liya or di ai ji ke sahaayak mistar aar e harton ke netritv main scotland kii sabase tej tarraar police ko isaki jaanch kaa kaam saunp diya
 The CID, after a serious investigation, confirmed to the government that the Kakori train robbery is a planned conspiracy by the revolutionaries
 police ne kakori kand ke sambandh main jaankaree dene va shadyantr main shaamil kisi bhi vyakti ko giraftaar karwaane ke liye inaam kii ghoshnaa ke vigyaapan sabhi pramukh sthanon par laga diye
 As a result of this, the police found that the sheet was found by someone from Shahjahanpur only because of the washer's mark on the sheet found at the scene
 shahjahanpur ke dhobiyon se poochne par maaloom hua ki chadar banarsi laal kii he
 The police obtained all the distinction by meeting Banarsi Lal
 yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur se uski party ke koun-koun log shahar se baahar gayi the or ve kab-kab waapas aaye? jab khufia taur se is baat kii pushti ho gayi ki ram prasad bismil, jo ech aar e kaa leader tha, us din shahar main nahin tha to 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat main bismil ke saath samooche hindustan se 40 se bhi adhik logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Only 10 people actually participated in the Kakori case, so all of them were nominated
 inamen se paanch - chandrasekhar aaazaad, murari sharma, keshav chakravarti, ashfak ulla khan va shacheendra nath bakshi ko chhodkar, jo police ke haath nahin aaye, shesh sabhi vyaktiyon par abhiyog chalaa or unhen 5 varsh kii kaid se lekar phaansi tak kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 Apart from the absconding accused, 16 of the revolutionaries who were arrested on suspicion of being active activists of H
R
A
 were released
 special magistrate anuddin ne prayek krantikari kii chhabi kharaab karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakkhi
 Not only this, before sending the case to the sessions court, all the witnesses and evidence were collected so that even if an appeal is made, not a single accused should be released without conviction
 banarsi laal ko hawalat main hi police ne kadi sajaa kaa bhay dikhaakar tod liya
 In the Shahjahanpur District Congress Committee, this Banarasi had a fight with Bismil over the party fund
 bismil ne, jo us samay jila congress cameti ke auditor the, banarsi par party-fund main gaban kaa aarope siddh karte hue use congress party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Later, when Gandhiji came to Shahjahanpur on 16 October 1920, Banarasi met him and made his stand
 gandhi ji ne us samay yah kahkar ki choti-moti hera-pheri ko itnaa tool nahin dena chaiye, in donon main sulah kara di
 But Banarsi was a very sly man
 usne pehle to bismil se maafee maang lee phir gandhi ji ko alag le jaakar unke kaan bhar diye ki ramprasad bada hi apradhi kism kaa vyakti he
 They neither believe anything about it nor allow anyone else to do it
 aage chalakar isi banarsi laal ne bismil se mitrataa kar lee or mithi-mithi baton se pehle unka vishwaas arjeet kiya or uske baad unke saath kapade ke vyapaar main saajheedaar ban gaya
 When Bismil formed his own party criticizing Gandhiji, Banarasi Lal was overjoyed and kept quiet in search of an opportunity
 police ne sthaneey logon se bismil va banarsi ke pichley jhagade kaa bhed jaanakar hi banarsi laal ko apruvar banaaya or bismil ke viruddh puure abhiyog main ek achook aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya
 Banarasi Lal, being a partner in trade, knew such secret things related to the party, which no one but Bismil could have known
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 The 11 district barracks of the Lucknow District Jail, which was then called the Central Jail of the United Provinces, housed all the revolutionaries together and built a temporary court in a luxurious building called Ring Theater near Hazratganj intersection
 ring theatre naam kii yah building kothi hayaat baksh or mallika ahad mahal ke bich hua karti thi jisamen british afasar aakar film va naatak aadi dekhakar manoranjan kiya karte the
 In the same ring theater for 18 consecutive months, the British government spent 10 lakh rupees when the value of gold used to be 20 rupees in a historic trial in the name of King Imperial Versus Ram Prasad 'bismil' and Others
 british hukmaranon ke aadesh se yah building bhi baad main dhaha di gayi or uski jagah san 1929-1932 main ji pi o lakhanu ke naam se ek doosraa bhavy bhawan bana diya gaya
 When India became independent in 1947, the Nehru government completed the true task of installing a grand statue of Gandhiji here
 jab kendra main gaiyr congresi janata sarkaar kaa pehali baar gathan hua to us samay ke jivit krantikariyon ke samuhik prayaason se san 1977 main yojit kakori shahid ardhshtabdi samaaroh ke samay yahan par kakori stambh kaa anaavaran uttar pradesh ke rajyapal ganapatirav devrao tapaase ne kiya taaki us sthal kii smriti bani rahe
 In this landmark case, Harkarnanath Mishra was appointed as the lawyer of the revolutionaries from government expenditure, while Jagatnarayan 'mulla', a well-known lawyer in relation to Jawaharlal Nehru, was made a government lawyer under a thoughtful strategy
 jagat narayan ne apni ore se sabhi krantikariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dilwane main koi kasar baaki na rakkhi
 It was the same Jagat Narayan against whose will Bismil organized a grand procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire city of Lucknow in 1916
 isi baat se chidh kar mainpuri shadyantra main bhi inhen mullaji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se kaaphi jor lagaaya parantu ve ram prasad bismil kaa ek bhi bal bankaa na kar paye kyonki mainpuri shadyantra main bismil faraar ho gayi the or do saal tak police ke haath hi na aaye
 On 6 April 1927, Special Sessions Judge A
 Hamilton, in a 115-page decision, considering the charges leveled against each revolutionary, wrote that this was not a simple train robbery, but a planned conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire
 haalaanki inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye is yojana main shaamil nahin hua parantu chunki kisi ne bhi na to apane kiye par koi pashchaatap kiya he or na hi bhavishya main is prakaar kii gatividhiyon se swayan ko alag rakhane kaa vachan diya he atah jo bhi sajaa di gayi he soch samaj kar di gayi he or is haalat main usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi chhot nahin di ja sakati
 However, if any of these accused expresses remorse in writing and pledges not to do so in future, the Upper Court may consider their appeal
 faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bahut baad main police giraftaar kar paayi
 An additional case of Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge J
 R
 Bennett and on 13 July 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged and sentenced to life imprisonment to Shachindranath Bakshi, repeating the same thing
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke si dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendra nath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad Bismil made his own defense because at the government expense he was given a big simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 On this reasoning ability of Bismil, Chief Justice Louis Shurtas had to ask him - "mr
 Ramprasad! From which university you have taken the degree of law?" At this he laughed and said- "excuse me sir! a kingmaker did not require Anne's degree
" " adaalat ne is jawaab se chidhkar bismil dwaara 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate
 use pard kar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the court allowed the same Laxmishankar Mishra to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 kakori kand kaa mukadmaa lakhanu main chal rahaa tha
 Pandit Jagatnarayan Mulla was a poet of Urdu along with the government lawyer
 unhone abhiyukton ke liye "muljiman" kii jagah "mulajim" shabd bol diya
 What was it then, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' blatantly lashed out at him with a sarcasm: "don't tell me, mooljim, we are very sorry; we have brought it here with the help of the court
" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant that he is not a servant, but a mullah who earns salaries from the government
 ve to raajnneetik bandi hai at: unke saath tameez se pesh aayen
 Along with this he also warned that they have the power to reverse even the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the big deal to overturn the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed in front of Bismil
 mullah ji ko paseene chhot gayi or unhone kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 They quietly slipped through the back door
 phir us din unhone koi jirah nahin kii
 All the revolutionaries, except Shachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal, appealed in the Chief Court
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendra nath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai pi si kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 = kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindra Nath Sanyal, while in jail, had expressed his remorse in writing and had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action
 iske aadhaar par unki umr-kaid barkaraar rahi
 Shachindra's younger brothers Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal had confessed to their crime and had already given the undertaking to face any punishment of the court, so they did not appeal and the order for imprisonment of 5-5 years remained unchanged
 chif court main apil karne ke baavjood yogeshchandra chatarji, mukundi laal va govindcharan car kii sajaayen 10-10 varsh se badhaakar umr-kaid main badal di gayin
 The decorations of Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and Vishnusharan Dublish also remained the same
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa 10 se badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Since the cartridges of the Mauser pistol used in the Kakori case were purchased on the arms license of Premkrishna Khanna, due to sufficient evidence, Premkrishna Khanna was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 5 years
 chif court kaa faisla aate hi samooche desh main sansani fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore informed the Central Legislative Council to submit a proposal to convert all the hanged prisoners of Kakori case to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya kintu unhone use asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council sent the then Viceroy and Governor General Edward Frederick Lindley Wood with a signed memorial in Shimla, prominently Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant , Etc
 had signed but they had no effect on the Viceroy

 The Chief Court in its decision also wrote this matter
 iske baavjood vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent the documents for clemency petition in the Privy Council to England's renowned lawyer SL Polak
 parantu landan ke nyaayadhishon va samraat ke vaidhanik salaahkaaron ne us par badi sakht daleel di ki is shadyantr kaa sutaradhar ram prasad bismil bada hi khatarnaak or peshewar apradhi he
 If he is granted pardon, he can commit a bigger and more terrible scandal in future
 us sthiti main sarkaar ko hindustan main shashan karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 The result of all this was that the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected
 16 disambar 1927 ko bismil ne apni aatmakatha kaa aakhri adhyay purna karke jail se baahar bhijwa diya
 Last met the parents on 18 December 1927 and on Monday 19 December 1927, they were hanged in the District Jail of Gorakhpur at 6

 bismil ke balidaan kaa samachar sunakar bahut badi sankhya main janata jail ke phatak par ekatra ho gayi
 The main gate of the jail was kept closed and Bismil's body was handed over to his family by breaking the wall in front of the gallows house

 Stunned by this incident, Bhagat Singh wrote the pseudonym 'rebel' in the character of January 1928: "while carrying on the gallows you said very loudly - 'vande Mataram! Bharatmata ki Jai!' And walking in peace, he said - 'O master, you are the one who remains, and you are the one, and neither can i live or be my father; as long as your body lives in blood, your mention and your good will remain!' Standing on the gallows, you said - 'I wish the downfall of the British Empire! That is, i want the fall of the British Empire!' After this the lion said - 'now there are neither Ahle-valvle nor the crowd of arrogance, the desire to eradicate one is now in the heart! Then prayed to God and started reading a mantra
 rassi khinchi gayi
 Ramprasad ji hanged
 " At the end of his article Bhagat Singh writes - "today that hero is not in this world
 use angreji sarkaar ne apana sabase bada khufanaak dushman samajha
 The general thought was that he had become a huge threat to the government even after being born in the slave country and was very familiar with the science of fighting

 All these events also had a huge impact on the Congress party
 subhaashachandr bose jaise navayuvak gandhi ji kii nitiyon kaa mukhar virodh karne lage the
 The Gandhis who had been completely invisible from the political arena from 1922 to 1927, now after the sacrifice of Ram Ji Prasad Bismil and his colleagues, again changed their attitude and started electing the President of their choice in the Congress and implementing the policies they wanted

 Seeing England getting badly entangled in the Second World War, as soon as Netaji gave the Azad Hind Fauj the slogan of "delhi Chalo", Gandhiji sensing the fragility of the occasion, "leave India" to the British from Bombay on the night of 8 August 1942
 And issued a "do or Die" order to the Indians and went to Aga Khan Palace in Yerwada under government protection

 Along with Gandhiji, the British Empire pretended to keep Kokila Sarojini Naidu in the Aga Khan Palace of Yerwada with all the facilities, to arrest Dr

 The term originated during 1987–1988 where indiscriminate freeway shooting occurred at 405, 110, and 10 friezes in Los Angeles
 shooting kii ye gatividhiyaan apane sadasyon ko AAA motor club se is baat par pratikriya paidaa karaati he ki sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa yaa aakraamak yuktiyon or bhaavon ke driver ke saath kaisaa vyavhaar karnaa he
 The following are common expressions of expressing anger on the road: america main AAA foundation adhyayan ke anusaar 300 se adhik sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke maamalon kaa parinaam gambhir chot or yahaan tak ki maut bhi rahaa he - prati varsh 1200 ghatnaon kaa record he or chah saal ke adhyayan ke anusaar yah vaarshik rup se bad rahaa he jisaki jaanch police rashtriya str par karti he
 In some jurisdictions there can be legal differences between "expressing fury on the road" and "aggressive driving"
 america main, kuch rajyon ne hi vishesh aakraamak driving kanoon adhiniyamit kiye he, jahaan sadak par rosh vyakt karne jaise maamalon main - prati varsh lagbhag 1200 - par saamaanya rup se hamalaa or bydaree, yaa "sawari sambandhi manushya hatya" ke mukademe chalaaye jate hai
 Already since 1997, physicians in the United States were working to certify road rage as a medical condition
 yah maansik vikaar ke naidanik or sankhyikee minial main pehle se hi ek pramanik maansik vikaar he
 According to an article published by the Associated Press in June 2006, the behavior usually associated with expressing road rage is the result of an explosive disorder caused by innings
 yah nishkarsh 2001 or 2003 ke bich rajya america main kuch 9200 vayaskon ke sanyukt surveykshan dwaara liya gaya tha or yah maansik swasthya ke rashtriya santhaan dwaara vitt poshit hua he
 The reason for the explosive disorder caused by the innings has not been written to date
 "sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa" ek maansik samasya he yaa nahin, is baat par bhinn vichaar rahe hai
 There are many alternative solutions to overcome this obstacle, whether it is or not
 sadak par rosh vyakt karnaa apekshaakrit ek gambhir kaary he: ise janata kii suraksha ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 However, investigation of intent by external observation is not always possible so "road razors" who are caught by police are charged with other offenses such as careless or inattentive driving

 It is likely that those who result in serious injury or death during "expressing fury on the road" events will suffer more severe penalties than simple negligence applied to similar consequences
 april 2007 main, ek colorado driver ko november 2005 main do vaahan chaalkon kii maut ke parinamswaroop pehle darje kii hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya gaya
 He will inevitably undergo two consecutive life terms
 chaudaa america rajyon ne aakraamak driving ke khilaaf kanoon paarit kar die he
 Only one state, California, has given it a special meaning to express indignation on the street, turning it into a legal term for art
 haalanki yah dhyaan dene yogya baat nahin he ki varjeenia main aakraamak driving ko laaparvaah driving kii tulana main ek kam aparaadh ke rup main sajaa di gayi he
 Expressing street fury in New Zealand is still technically legal and is still considered socially acceptable behavior
 kanoon kii samiksha ke liye kol ke baavjood bhi, newjiland sarkaar kaa australia jaise anya deshon kii tarah "sadak par rosh vyakt karne ke virdohi" kanoon prastut karne kii koi naveenatam yojana nahin he
 Although technically "chasing" motorists and willfully damaging their vehicles is a crime, the police generally do not consider such acts as a 'high priority' and called it an "insurance thing"
 It means that if a passenger has intentionally damaged his / her vehicle in the event of expressing anger on a road, then it is a case of insurance companies of both the parties rather than criminal cases
 Do depends on A
 So what will they solve it have short road rage in New Zealand is still legal and the police ignore such acts unless that person is killed

 Once when the English language was being translated into English by the English doctor, Cunain, described in the English Doctor Cullen's book, "clenis Materia Medica", Dr
 Hahnemann's attention turned to Dr
 Cullen's description, where Cunain It has been said that "although quinine cures malaria, it causes malaria-like symptoms in a healthy body
" kalen kii kahi gayi yah baat dow hanimen ke dimag main baith gayi

 ye kramshah utak vigyaan or sthaan hai
 Common category examples include: in main se adhikansh ganthen bacchon main aam hai
 The names of dormant knots typically use words such as -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as suffixes, with the Latin or Greek word for organ of origin as the root word
 udhaaharan ke liye, yakrut kaa karkat hepetocarcinoma kehalaata he; vasa koshikaon kaa karkat liposarcoma kehalaata he
 For common cancers, the English name of the organ is used
 udhaaharan ke liye stan cancer kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar stan kaa vahini parak carcinoma yaa mameri dakatal carcinoma kehalaata he
 Here the adjective ducktail is used to refer to the cancer seen in the microscope, which is similar to normal breast vessels

 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai
 Generally, the body tries to avoid against cancer through several methods, such as: apoptosis, accessory molecules, possibly chronicity, etc
 haalanki ye truti sudhaar vidhiyaan chote myanon main aksar asafal ho jaati hai, vishesh rup se aise vaataavaran main jahaan trutiyon ke utpann hone or badhane kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again

 Fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamine and multicomponent hydrocarbons, are found in tobacco smoking
 Tobacco is responsible for one in three cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five deaths worldwide
 darasal, sanyukt rajya america main phuffus kii cancer mrityu kii dar ne dhumrapan ke praturup ko pratibimbit kiya he, jiske anusaar dhumrapan main vruddhi ke saath phuffus cancer mrityu dar main vruddhi hoti he or adhik haal hi main darshaya gaya ki dhumrapan main kami se purushon main phuffus cancer mrityu dar main bhi kami hoti he
 Although the number of smokers is still increasing around the world, the situation caused by some organizations has been described as a tobacco epidemic

 Many cancers are caused by a virus infection; This is especially seen in birds such as animals, but also in humans, viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide
 maanav ke cancer se sambandhit mukhya virus hai maanav pepiloma virus, hepatitis bi or hepatitis si virus, epstin-baar virus or maanav tii -limphotropic virus
 Experimental and epidemiological data indicate a causative role of viruses and have emerged as the second most important risk factor for the development of cancer in humans, with the first factor being tobacco use
 virus-prerit ganthon ko do prakaaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale or dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale 
 In rapidly converting viruses, the virus carries a hyperactive oncogene called viral-oncogene and the infected cell quickly mutates with the expression of v-onc
 iske vipareet, dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale virus main, virus jinom, poshi ke jinom main ek proto-onkosin ke paas pravisht hota he
 Now viral promoters or other transcriptional regulation elements cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene
 isamen aniyantrit koshika vibhaajan shaamil he
 Because the location of insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes, and no proto-oncogene has a low chance of insertion, slow-converting viruses, as compared to fast-converting viruses, have a longer duration of infection
 Produce knots after time

 To convert a normal cell into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be transformed
 anuvanshik parivartan kai staron par ho sakate hai, ye pur gunasutra ke laabh yaa haani ke rup main ho sakate hai, jo utparivartan kaa hi ek rup he or ek maatr DNA neucliotoide ko prabhavit karata he
 There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes
 onkosin saamaanya jin ho sakate hai, jo anupyukt rup se ucch str par prakat hote hai, yaa parivartit jin jinamein noval gun hote hai
 In any case, expression of these genes promotes the malignancy pattern of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ve jin he jo cancer kii koshikaon ke koshika vibhaajan, astitv, yaa anya gunon ko sandamit karte hai
 Lump suppressor genes are often disabled by genetic changes that promote cancer
 aamtaur par, ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye kai jeenon main parivartan hone jaruri hai
 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis
 bade paimaane ke utparivartano main shaamil hai ek gunasutra ke ek bhaag kii kshati yaa vruddhi

 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny
 adhi-anuvaanshiki, DNA saranchana main rasinic, gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartanon ke madhyam se jin abhivyakti ke niyaman kaa adhyayan he
 The principle of over-genetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes in DNA cause changes in gene expression
 saamaanya rup se, onkosin shant hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye aisa DNA methilikaran ke kaaran hota he
 Damage in this methylation induces aberrant expression of oncogene, which is the cause of cancer pathogenesis
 adhi-anuvaanshik parivartan kii gyaat pranali main shaamil he diene methilikaran or gunasutra ke DNA par vishesh sthiti par jude hue histone protein kaa methilikaran yaa asitelikaran
 Classes of therapy known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyl transferase inhibitors may re-regulate over-genetic signaling in cancer cells
 onkosin kai prakaar se koshika vruddhi ko badhaava dete he
 Many hormones can be made, a chemical messenger between cells that induces mitotic division, the effect of which depends on signal transduction of receptor tissue or cells
 duusare shabdon main, jab ek praptakarta koshika par ek hormone grahi uttejit hota he, sanket koshika kii sataha se koshika ke kendrak ko sanvahit hota he, yah kendriya str par jin pratilekhan viniman main kuch parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps
 raas ko mul rup se harvey sarcoma virus jinom main pahachaanaa gaya tha or shodhakarta is baat se aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki na keval maanav jinom main yah jin upasthiti tha balki, ek utprerak niyantran tatv se judaa hua tha, jo koshika rekha sanvardhan main cancer ko prerit kar saktaa tha
 The knot suppressor gene encodes for anti-proliferation signals and proteins, which suppress mitosis and cell growth
 saamanytah, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin pratilekhan kaarak hai jo koshikeey tanaav yaa DNA kshati ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 Often DNA damage can result in the presence of free-radical genetic material as well as other symptoms that induce enzymes and pathways responsible for activation of knot-suppressing genes
 aise jeenon kaa kaary he DNA kii marammat ke liye koshika chakra ke aage badhane par niyantran, jo utparivartan ko putree koshika tak sthanantarit hone se roktaa he
 The p53 protein, one of the most studied knot suppressor genes, is a transcription factor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage
 p53 roopantaran main shaamil sabhi canceron ke lagbhag aadhe ke alaava, iske gaanth ke shaman kaary ko bhalee prakaar se samajha nahin gaya he
 Apparently p53 has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating cell cycle, cell division and apoptosis
 warburg pariklpana ke anusaar cancer kii vruddhi ke liye urja hetu glycolysis kaa adhimaanya prayog hota he
 p53 regulates the transfer of the glycolytic tract from respiration
 haalanki, ek utparivartan, khud "ise band karte hue" gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ko yaa is sanket maarg ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he, jo ise sakriy karata he, is kaa achal parinaam he ki DNA kii marammat baadhit yaa sandamit ho jaati he: marammat rahit diene kshati kaa sangrah nishchit rup cancer kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome
 anya vanshaagat gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin syndrome main shaamil he retino blostoma se sambandhit Rb utparivartan or adinopoliposis badi aant ke cancer se jude APC jin utparivartan
adinopoliposis badi aant kaa cancer bachapan kii avasthaa main badi aant main hajaaron polip se sambandhit hai, jo apekshaakrit kam umr main badi aant kaa cancer utpann karte hai
 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy
 yah ghatana prabhavi nakaaratmak prabhaav kehalaati he or kai p53 utparivartanon main dekhi jaati he
 Knudson's two-injury model has recently been challenged by several investigators
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale kuch jeenon ke ek elil kaa niskriyakaran tumor ko utpann karne ke liye paryaapt he
 This phenomenon is called haploid insufficiency and has been demonstrated by several experimental approaches
 agunit aparyaaptta se utpann hui gaanth kii shuruyaat aam taur par der se hoti he, jab isaki tulana ek ek do chot kii prakriya se kii jaati he
 Often, multiple genetic changes that result in cancer may take several years to accumulate
 is samay ke dauraan, purv durdam koshikaon kaa jaivik vyavhaar dhire dhire saamaanya koshika se badal kar cancer koshika kaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of microscope, differentiating properties can be seen in pre-treated tissue

 These initial tumor changes should be differentiated from overgrowth, which is a mutant increase in cell division due to an external stimulation, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation
 durvikasita ke sabase gambhir maamalon ko "swasthani karcarbud " kaha jaataa he
 In Latin, the word "in situ" means "in place", so the term carcinoma is in situ, the uncontrolled growth of cells that remain in their original place and have not shown any invasion of other tissues
 phir bhi, carcinoma swasthani ek aakraamak durdamata main viksit ho saktaa he or yadi sambhav ho to ise aam taur par shalya kriya ke dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 Just as the growth occurs in animal populations, so does growth in uncontrolled populations of cells
 yah avaanchhneeya prakriya kayik vikaas kehalaati he or isi tarah se cancer utpann hota he or adhik durdam ban jaataa he
 Most changes in cellular metabolism that cause irregular cell division are the cause of cell death

 Similarly, pathogens such as MRSA become antibiotic-resistant and this is why crop blight and pests become resistant to pesticides
 isi vikaas ke kaaran cancer punrariti main aisi koshikaayen hoti hai jo cancer kii dawaaon ke liye pratirodh praapt kar leti hai In a 2000 article by Hannahan and Weinberg, the biological properties of the sore knot cells were summarized as follows: in bahul padon kaa puraa hona nimna ke bina ek bahut hi durlabh ghatana hogi: These biological changes are predominant in carcinoma; Other hard knots may not be all that is needed to achieve them
 udhaaharan ke liye, utak akraman or dur ke sthanon par visthaapan shwet rakt koshikaon kaa saamaanya gun he; ye pad shwetarktata ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak nahin hai
 Different positions do not necessarily represent individual mutations
 For example, inactivation of a genus will cause codons for the p53 protein, genomic instability, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis
 cancer kii sabhi koshikaayen vibhajit nahin hoti hai
 Rather, a sub-set of cells in a knot is called the cancerous stem cells, which replicate on their own and form differentiated cells
 cancer kii rokthaam ko, cancer kii ghatnaon main kami laane ke liye sakriy upayon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 For this, avoiding cancer or altering their metabolism, adopting a lifestyle or diet that modifies cancer-causing factors and / or medical intervention may be useful
 "rokthaam" kii mahamari vigyaan avadharana ko saamanyatya yaa to un logon ke liye praathmik rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jinamein kisi vishesh rog kaa nidaan nahin kiya gaya he, yaa dwitiyak rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jo pehle se nidaan kiye gaye rog kii jatiltaaon ko kam karata he
 Most of the cancer risk factors are related to the environment or lifestyle in nature, claiming that cancer is a widely preventable disease

 According to a public health perspective, cervical cancer screening through pap smears is more beneficial in price than all other types of cancer, it is largely caused by a virus, there are obvious risk factors, such as cancer
 The natural way of spreading is that it usually spreads slowly over many years, so the screening program can quickly catch it
 To take more time

 Those who are suspected of cancer are examined by medical examination
 isamen saamaanya hai rakt pareekshan, eks kiran, siti scan or antahdarshan 
 Cancer can be suspected for a number of reasons, but the definitive diagnosis of most malignancies should be ensured by a pathologist through tissue scientific testing of cancer cells
 biopsy yaa shalya chikitsa ke dwaara utak ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Many biopsies can be performed in a physician's office
 anya angon kii biopsy ek nishchetak kii upasthiti main kii jaati he, iske liye shalya chikitsa ke kaksh main shalya kriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist explains the type of cell proliferating

 Also, this information is useful in evaluating the patient's prior diagnosis and choosing the best treatment
 koshika anuvanshiki or pratiraksha utak rasayan vigyaan pareekshan ke anya prakaar hai jo ek rog vigyaani ek utak ke namoonay par kar saktaa he
 These tests can provide information about the molecular changes that have taken place in the cancer cell and thus indicate the future behavior and best treatment of the cancer
 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness
 chemotherapy kii prabhaavashiltaa aksar sharir main anya utakon ke vishikaran ke dwaara simit ho jaati he
 Radiation can also damage normal tissues
 kyonki "cancer" kaa sandarbh rogon ke ek varg se he, aisa sambhav nahin he ki "cancer kaa hameshaa ek maatr upachaar" hi rahegaa, phir bhi sabhi sankramak rogon ke liye ek hi upachaar hota he
 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence
 is kaaran ke liye, rogavigyaani shalya kriya se nikaale gaye namoonay kii jaanch karte hai, yadi swasth utak kii seemaa upasthit he, to is baat kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he ki sookshm cancer kii koshikayen rogi ke sharir main rah gai hai
 In addition to the removal of the primary knot, surgery is often required for stage determination eg determining the extent of the disease and determining whether it has reached the regional lymph nodes via metastasis

 Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and compressed lumps
 vikiran chikitsa ko bahya kiran radiotherapy ke dwaara baahar se hi niyantrit kiya jaataa he yaa brekitherapy ke dwaara andar se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of radiation therapy is localized and limited to the area to be treated
 vikiran chikitsa, ilaaj kiye jane vaale kshetra kii koshikaon ko kshatigrast karti he yaa nasht kar detii he, is kriya main in koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth ko nasht kar diya jaataa he taaki koshikaon main aage vibhaajan or vruddhi na ho paae

 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells

 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
