 You can change behavior by using a harsh or soothing voice, by gesturing, that is, frowning; These are all suitable techniques
 purvaparichaalanaatmak : apane bhashaa sambandhi nae gyaan kaa istemaal karte hue baccha vastuon ko darshane ke liye sanketon kaa istemaal karnaa shuru karata he
 At the beginning of this phase he also humanizes things
 vah ab behatar dhang se un chizon or ghatnaon ke bare main sochane main sakasham ho jaataa he jo tatkaal maujuud nahin hai
 Being oriented towards the present, the child has difficulty in making his / her thoughts about time
 unki soch par kalpana kaa asar rahata he or vah chizon ko unheen roopon main dekhtaa he jin roopon main vah unhen dekhnaa chahta he or vah maan letaa he ki duusare log bhi un paristhitiyon ko usee ke nazariye se dekhte hai
 He obtains information and then he converts that information in his mind according to his thoughts
 sikhaane-padhaane ke dauraan bachche kii jwalanth kalpanaaon or samay ke prati uski aviksit samaj ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 The use of neutral words, body outline and tactile equipment helps in active learning of the child
 inkaa chintan jeev vaad par aadhaarit hota he, matlab yah nirjeev va sajiv sabhi vastu / praani ko jivit hi maanate he
 Tangible operational state ': During this phase, the adjusting capacity increases
 bacchon main anmane bhav se sochane or indriyon se pahchaanane yogya yaa dikhaai dene yogya ghatana ke bare main tarksangat nirnay karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas hota he jise samajhane ke liye ateet main use shaareerik drushti kaa istemaal karnaa padaa tha
 While teaching this child, giving him a chance to ask questions and explain things or things back to you, it makes him easy to use that information mentally
 amoort sankriyaatmak avasthaa': yah charan anubhuti ko uskaa antim rup pradaan karata he
 This person no longer needs recognizable items to make rational decisions
 apni baat par vah kaalpanik or nigamanaatmak tark de saktaa he
 The field of teaching and learning to adolescent girls can be quite wide because they are able to consider many possibilities from many perspectives
 vaigotski ek vichaarak the jinhone purv soviet sangh ke pehle dashakon ke dauraan kaam kiya tha
 He believed that children learn through practical experience like Piaget suggested
 haalanki, piyajet ke vipareet, unhone daawa kiya ki jab koi baccha koi nayaa kaam seekhney kii kagaar par hota he tab vayaskon dwaara samay par or samvedansheel hastkshep se bacchon ko nae kaaryon ko seekhney main madad mil sakati he
 This technique is called "scaffolding" because it builds on the knowledge children already have with new knowledge that can help an adult child learn
 iskaa ek udhaaharan tab mil saktaa he jab koi mata yaa pita kisi bacchee ko tali bajaane yaa pat-e-kek kavita ke liye apane haathon ko gol-gol ghumaane main tab tak "madad" karte hai jab tak vah khud apane haathon ko thapthapaanaa yaa tali bajaanaa or gol-gol ghumana sikh nahin leti he
 Vygotsky's focus was entirely on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development
 unhone tark diya ki bachche ke saanskrithik vikaas main har kaary do baar prakat hota he: pehali baar saamaajik str par or baad main vyaktigat str par; pehali baar logon ke bich or uske baad bachche ke bheetar 
 yah svaichhik dhyaan, taarkik smriti or avadharana nirmaan main samaan rup se lagu hota he
 All higher functions have their origin in the actual relationship between individuals
 bhaigatski ne mahasoos kiya ki vikaas ek prakriya thi or unhone bachche ke vikaas main sankat kii avadhiyon ko dekha jis dauraan bachche kii maansik kriyasheeltaa main ek gunatmak parivartan hua tha
 The theory of attachment or attachment is a psychological, evolutionary and character formation theory that originated in the creation of John Bowlby and developed by Mary Einsworth; It provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding the interpersonal relationships between humans
 anuraag siddhantkaron kaa maananaa he ki maanav shishu ke saamaanya saamaajik or bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke liye kam se kam ek dekharekh karne vaale ke saath uskaa sambandh hona jaruri he
 a follower of Freud named Erickson, who along with Freud synthesized his own theories, created the theory known as the "psychosocial" stages of human development; Its time frame is from birth to death and the "tasks" it focuses on at every stage are those tasks that must be completed to successfully guide life's challenges
 jon bi
 watasan kaa vyavahaarwad siddhant vikaas ke vyaavhaarik model kii neenv kaa nirmaan karata he
 He wrote a lot on the development of the child and did many research
 Watson was instrumental in the revision of William James's consciousness stream approach in building the stream of behavioral theory
 Watson also helped to bring a natural science perspective to the child's psychology by introducing purposeful research methods based on visible and measurable behavior

 skinner ne aage chalakar operent condishning or maukhik vyavhaar ko cover karne ke liye is model ko vistaarit kiya
 According to his view of a basic human motivation as being sexually driven, Sigmund Freud developed a psychoanalytic theory of human development beyond infancy and divided it into five stages
 prayek charan sharir ke vasanotejak kshetra yaa kisi vishesh kshetra ke bheetar kamechha kii santushti ke aasapaas kendrit tha
 He also argued that as humans develop, they become stable on different and specific objects through their stages of development
 prayek charan main matbhinnata he jise bachche ke vikaas ko sakasham banane ke liye hal karnaa jaruri he
 The use of the theory of dynamic systems as a framework for the idea of evolution began in the early 1990s and is still in use in the current century
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant arekhiy sambandhon or ek charan parivartan ke rup main phir se sangathit hone kii ek pranali kii kshamta par jor detaa he jisaki prakruti manch kii tarah hoti he
 Another useful concept for evolutionists is the position of attractor; This stage apparently helps to determine unrelated behaviors as well as related behaviors
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant ko motor vikaas ke adhyayan main bade paimaane par lagu kiya jaataa he; lagaav pranaaliyon ke bare main boulbi ke kuch drushtikonon ke saath bhi is siddhant kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 Dynamic systems theory also relates to the concept of the behavioral process, which is a reciprocal interaction process in which children and parents influence each other simultaneously leading to developmental changes in both over time
 kor nolej persepective bachche ke vikaas main ek vikasmoolak siddhant he jo yah prastaav detaa he ki "shishuon ke jivan kii shuruyaat sahaj or vishesh prayojan vaali gyaan pranaaliyon ke saath hoti he jise soch ke kor domen ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he"
 soch ke paanch kor domen hai jinamein se prayek astitv raksha ke liye bahut jaruri he jo ek saath aarambhik anubhuti ke pramukh pahaluon ke vikaas ke liye hamen taiyaar karte hai; ve hai: shaareerik, sankhyatmak, bhashaai, manovaigyanik or jaivik
 Although identifying developmental goals is an interesting task for researchers and child carers, many aspects of developmental change are persistent and do not reflect the visible milestones of change
 satat vikasaatmak parivartanon, jaise kad main vruddhi, main vayask visheshtaon kii taraf kaaphi kramik or purvanumey pragati shaamil hoti he
 However, when developmental change is discrete, researchers can identify not only the milestones of development but also the associated age periods often called stages
 ek charan aksar ek gyaat kalanukramik aayu seemaa se judi hui ek samyavadhi he jis dauraan koi vyavhaar yaa shaareerik visheshta gunatmak rup se anya charnon se alag hoti he
 When an age period is referred to as a phase, the term does not only mean a qualitative difference but it also means a predictable sequence of developmental events such as specific behavioral or physiological before and after each stage
 There are other specific periods associated with qualities
 vikaas ke charan ek saath ho sakate hai yaa vikaas ke anya vishisht pahaluon se jude ho sakate hai jaise bolnaa yaa chalanaa
 yahan tak ki ek vishesh vikasaatmak kshetra main bhi kisi charan main sankraman kaa matlab yah nahin ho saktaa he ki pichhlaa charan puri tarah se samaapt ho gaya he
 For example, in Erickson's discussion of stages of personality, this theorist suggests that life is spent working afresh on issues that were originally characteristic of the childhood phase
 isi tarah, sangyanatmak vikaas ke siddhantkaar piyajet ne un paristhitiyon kaa varnan kiya jinamein bachche paripakv soch-vichaar kaushal ke istemaal se ek prakaar kii samasya kaa samaadhaan kar sakate hai lekin ve kam parichit samasyaon ke liye ise puraa nahin kar sakate hai; is ghatana ko unhone kshaitij dicales naam diya
 Although developmental change goes on with chronological age, age itself does not contribute to development
 vikasaatmak parivartanon kii buniyadi kriyavidhi yaa kaaran, anuvanshik or paryaavarniya kaarak hote hai
 Genetic factors are responsible for cellular changes such as overall development, changes in the proportion of parts of the body and brain, and maturation of aspects of function such as vision and dietary needs
 kyonki genes ko "band" or "chaalu" kiya ja saktaa he isliye samay samay par vyakti kii praarambhik ginotip ke kaary main parivartan ho saktaa he jisase aage chalakar vikasaatmak parivartan main teji aa sakati he
 Environmental factors affecting development may include diet and disease risk as well as social, emotional, and cognitive experiences
 haalaanki, paryaavarniya karkon kii pariksha se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki yuva manushya paryaavarniya anubhavon kii ek kaaphi vyapak seemaa main bhi jivit rah sakate hai
 Rather than acting as independent mechanisms, genetic and environmental factors often influence each other, leading to developmental change
 bachche ke vikaas ke kuch pahalu unki namaneeyata ke liye yaa us had tak ullekhneey hai jis had tak vikaas kii disha kaa maargdarshan paryaavarniya karkon dwaara kiya jaataa he or saath hi saath anuvanshik karkon dwaara shuru kiya jaataa he
 For example, it appears that the development of allergic reactions is relatively due to exposure to some environmental factors of early life, and protecting against early exposure makes the child less likely to have a variable allergic reaction
 
 jab vikaas ke kisi pahalu par praarambhik anubhav kaa bahut zyada asar padataa he to kaha jaataa he ki isamen bahut zyada namaneeyata dikhaai detii he; jab anuvanshik swabhaav vikaas kaa praathmik kaarak hota he to kaha jaataa he ki namaneeyata kam he
 Plasticity may include endogenous factors such as hormones as well as exogenous factors such as guidance of infection
 vikaas ke paryaavarniya maargdarshan ke ek kism kaa varnan anubhav par nirbhar namaneeyata ke rup main kiya jaataa he jisamen paryaavaran se seekhney ke parinamswaroop vyavhaar main badlaav aata he
 Thus plasticity can occur over a lifetime and may involve a variety of behaviors, including some emotional reactions
 ek duusare prakaar kii namaneeyata, anubhav ashanvit namaneeyata main vikaas kii simit samvedansheel avadhiyon ke dauraan vishisht anubhavon kaa kaaphi prabhaav shaamil hota he
 For example, the coordinated use of two eyes and the experience of a single three-dimensional image instead of two-dimensional images produced by light in each eye depends on experiences with vision during the second half of the first year of life
 anubhav-ashanvit namaneeyata, anuvanshik karkon ke parinamswaroop ishtatam parinaamon ko praapt na kar paane vaale vikaas sambandhi pahaluon ko thik karne kaa kaam karti he
 In addition to the existence of plasticity in certain aspects of development, genetic-environmental correlations may function in many ways in determining the mature characteristics of an individual
 anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh aisi paristhitiyaan hai jinamein anuvanshik karkon se kaaphi had tak kuch anubhav milane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 For example, in the passive genetic – environmental correlation, a child is likely to experience a particular environment because his or her parents' genetic nature may lead them to choose or create such an environment
 vicharottejak anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh main bachche kii anuvanshik rup se viksit visheshtaon kii vajah se duusare logon ko kuch khaas tareekon se jawaab dena padataa he jisase unhen ek aisa alag maahaul miltaa he jo ki anuvanshik rup se alag bachche ko mil saktaa ho; udhaaharan ke taur par, down syndrome se grast bachche kaa ilaaj ek gaiyr-down syndrome grast bachche kii tulana main adhik surakshatmak rup se or kam chunauteepurn dhang se kiya ja saktaa he
 Finally, an active genetic – environmental correlation is a relationship in which the child chooses experiences that in turn influence them; For example, a strong active child may choose after-school sports experiences that build enhanced athletic skills but may hinder music education
 inamen se sabhi maamalon main yah pataa karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki bachche kii visheshtaon kaa nirmaan anuvanshik karkon yaa anubhavon yaa donon ke sanyog se hua tha
 Systematic inquiry about developmental events is needed to establish a useful understanding of the child's development
 vikaas ke vibhinn pahaluon main parivartan kii vibhinn paddatiyaan or kaaran shaamil hai, isliye bachche ke vikaas ko sankshep main prastut karne kaa koi saral tarika nahin he
 Nevertheless, answering a few questions about each topic can provide comparable information about various aspects of developmental change
 waters evam unke sahyogiyon ne is uddeshy se nimnlikhit sawaalon kaa suzav diya he
 Several methods can be used in empirical research to answer these questions
 shuru main, pehle varsh main parivarti pratikriyaaon main parivartan jaise vikasaatmak parivartan ke kisi pahalu ke vistrut varnan evam paribhaasha ko viksit karne ke liye prakritik paristhitiyon main paryvekshaniya shodh kii jarurat pad sakati he
 This type of work can be followed by certain types of development such as correlative studies, collecting information about chronological age, and vocabulary development; Correlative statistics can be used to describe the change
 is tarah ke adhyayan alag alag umr main bacchon kii visheshtaon kii jaanch karte hai
 These methods may include longitudinal studies in which a group of children is re-examined multiple times when they are older, or cross-sectional studies may include groups of children of different ages at once
 Are examined and compared with one another, or a combination of these methods may be involved
 bachche ke vikaas se sambandhit kuch adhyayanon main jaruri taur par kisi gaiyr-yadrichhik dizin main bacchon ke alag-alag samoohon kii visheshtaon kii tulana karke anubhav yaa anuvanshikta ke prabhaavon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 In other studies, randomized designs can be used to compare outcomes for groups of children who receive different interventions or educational treatments
 milastons vishisht shaareerik or maansik kshamtaaon main hone vaale parivartan hai jo ek vikasaatmak avadhi ke ant or duusari vikasaatmak avadhi ke armbh ko chihnit karte hai
 For phase theories, phase shifts are indicated by milestones
 kai vikaas kaaryon kii purnataa ke adhyayanon ne vikasaatmak milastons ke saath jude vishisht kalanukramik aayu ko sthapit kiya he
 However, there is considerable difference in the attainment of milestones even among children with developmental cycles within the normal range
 kuch milastons duusare se adhik parivartaneey hote hai; udhaaharan ke liye, grahanshil bhaashan sanketakon se saamaanya rup se sunne vaale bacchon main kaaphi bhinnata kaa pataa chalata he lekin arthpurna bhaashan milastons kaaphi parivartaneey ho sakate hai
 a common concern related to the development of the child is developmental delay including delay in an age-specific capacity for significant developmental milestones
 vikasaatmak deree kii rokthaam or usamen aarambhik hastkshep bachche ke vikaas ke adhyayan kaa mahatvapurn vishay he
 Developmental delay should be identified by comparing it with the specific variability of a milestone, not with respect to the mean age at achievement
 milastone kaa ek udhaaharan aankh or haath kaa samanvay ho saktaa he jisamen ek samanvit tareeke se vastuon main pherbadal karne se sambandhit bachche kii badhati kshamta shaamil he
 Increasing knowledge of age-specific milestones makes it easier for parents and others to monitor proper development
 bachche kaa vikaas kaa mudda koi ekaaki vishay nahin he balki yah kuch had tak vyakti ke vibhinn pahaluon ke liye alag dhang se pragati karata he
 Here the development of many physical and mental characteristics is described
 xxrep 4 = kya viksit hota he?janm ke baad 15 se 20 varsh kii aayu tak kad or vajan ke kshetra main shaareerik vikaas hota he; sahi samay par janm lene ke samay ke ausat vajan 3
5 kilo or ausat lambaai 50 semi se badhate-badhate vyakti apane purna vayask aakaar tak pahunchataa he
 As the height and weight increases, the physical proportions of the person also change, the head of the newborn is relatively large and the torso and the rest of the limbs are small which, when they are adults, have relatively small head and long torso and limbs
 Is transformed
 shaareerik vikaas kii gati janm ke baad ke maheenon main tej hoti he or uske baad dhimi pad jaati he isliye janm ke samay kaa vajan pehle chaar maheenon main doguna or 12 maheene kii umr main tiguna ho jaataa he lekin 24 maheene tak chauguna nahin hota he
 Growth continues at a slow pace until just before puberty, after which the pace of development becomes quite rapid
 sharir ke sabhi hisson main hone vaali vruddhi kii dar or samay main ekarupata nahin hoti he
 The head size at birth is already roughly the size of an adult's head, but the lower body is much smaller than the adult's lower parts
 uske baad vikaas ke kram main sir dhire-dhire chota hota jaataa he or dhad or baaki angon main teji se vikaas hone lagata he
 Genetic factors have a major role in determining the rate of growth and in particular the changes in the proportional feature of early human development
 haalaanki anuvanshik karkon kii vajah se keval tabhi adhiktam vruddhi ho sakati he jab paryaavarniya paristhitiyaan anukool hon
 kharaab poshan or aksar chot or beemaari kii vajah se vyakti kaa vayask kad ghat saktaa he lekin behtareen maahaul kii vajah se kad main bahut zyada vruddhi nahin ho sakati he jitna ki anuvanshikta se nirdhaarit hota ho
 Population differences in growth are largely related to adult stature
 vayask avasthaa main kaaphi lambey rahane vaale jatigat samoohon ke bachche chote vayask kad vaale samoohon kii tulana main janm ke samay or bachapan ke dauraan bhi lambey hote hai
 Males are also somewhat taller, although this is more pronounced in caste groups with strong sexual dimorphism in the adult stage
 visheshtya kuposhan ke shikaar log bhi jivan bhar chote yaa nate rahete hai
 However, the population difference in growth rate and pattern is not large, except that poor environmental conditions can cause delays in puberty and associated growth rates
 spasht rup se ladakon or ladakiyon ke yauvan kii alag-alag aayu kaa matlab he ki 11 yaa 12 saal ke ladke or ladkiyaan paripakvata ke maamle main kaaphi alag-alag str par hote hai or shaareerik aakaar ke maamle main saamaanya yon antar ke vipareet str par ho sakate hai
 In childhood, there is a considerable individual difference in weight and weight
 inamen se kuch antaron kii vajah paariwarik anuvanshik kaarak or anya antaron kii vajah paryaavarniya kaarak hai lekin vikaas ke kram main kahin-kahin prajnan paripakvata main vyaktigat antaron kaa un par bahut zyada prabhaav padataa he
 Changes in physical activity abilities during childhood are largely influenced by the variable activity patterns of the young infant in the highly skilled voluntary movement characteristic of childhood and adolescence
 motor vikaas kii gati praarambhik jivan main tej hoti he kyonki navjaat shishu kii parivarti gatividhiyon main se kai pehle saal ke bheetar badal jaati hai yaa gaayab ho jaati hai or baad main yah gati dhimi pad jaati he
 Like physical growth, motor development also predicts predictive methods of cephalocodal and proximodistal development, and controls the movements of the head and more central regions before the lower body or hands and feet
 gatividhi ke prakaaron kaa vikaas charan jaise kramon main hota he; udhaaharan ke liye, 6 se 8 maheenon kii harakat main donon haathon or donon pairon par rengna or uske baad khadey honi kii koshish karnaa, kisi chiz ko pakadte samay uske "chakkar" lagaana, kisi vayask kaa haath pakadakar chalanaa or ant main swatantra rup se chalanaa shaamil he
 Older children continue this sequence by walking side-by-side or backward, walking or running fast, jumping, skipping with one foot and walking with the other foot and finally skipping
 madhya bachapan or kishoravastha tak ek purvanumey kram ke bajaay anudesh yaa paryvekshan ke madhyam se nae motor kaushalon kii prapti hoti he
 The mechanisms or processes involved in motor development involve certain genetic components that determine the physical size of body parts at a specified age, as well as aspects of muscle and bone strength
 poshan or vyaayaam bhi takat kaa nirdhaaran karte hai or isliye ye aasaani or sateekta kaa bhi nirdhaaran hota he jiske saath sharir ke hisse ko hilaayaa-dulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Opportunities for movement help establish the ability to bend and stretch the body parts, both of which are essential for good motor ability
 abhyaas or seekhney ke parinamswaroop kushal svaichhik gatividhiyon kaa vikaas hota he
 The motor capacity of a normal person is normal and depends to some extent on the weight and build of the child
 haalaanki shishav kaal ke baad saamaanya vyaktigat antaron par abhyaas, paryvekshan or vishisht gatividhiyon ke anudesh kaa bahut zyada asar padataa he
 Abnormal motor development can be a sign of problems or developmental delays such as autism or cerebral palsy
 motor vikaas ke kshetra main kuch jansankhya antar bhi dekhne ko milte hai jinke tahat ladakiyon ko choti mansapeshiyon ke istemaal se kuch laabh miltaa he jinamein hothon or jeebh se dhvaniyon kaa uccharan bhi shaamil he
 There have been reports of racial differences in the variable activities of newborns, which suggests that some biological factors are also active
 saanskrithik antar motor kaushal ko seekhney main protsaahan de sakate hai jaise swatchta prayojanon ke liye keval baayein haath kaa istemaal karnaa or anya sabhi kaaryon ke liye daayen haath kaa istemaal karnaa jisase jansankhya antar kaa nirmaan hota he
 Cultural factors are also seen to be functional in practice voluntary activities such as using the foot to move the football forward or the hand to move the basketball forward
 chote bacchon main seekhney, yaad rakhane or jaankaree kaa pratik banane or samasyaon ko hal karne kii kshamta saamaanya str par hoti he jo sangyanatmak kaary kar sakate hai jaise chetan or achetan praaniyon main bhedbhaav karnaa yaa kam sankhya vaali vastuon kii pahchaan karnaa
 In childhood, the speed of learning and processing information increases, memory also increases, and the use of signal use and summarization develops until adolescence is almost reached the adult level
 sangyanatmak vikaas main anuvanshik or anya jaivik kriyavidhi hoti hai jaise ki maansik mandatha ke kai anuvanshik karkon main dekha gaya he
 However, despite assuming that brain functions are the cause of cognitive events, it is not possible to measure specific brain changes and show that they are the ones that cause cognitive changes
 anubhuti ke kshetra main hone vaali vikasaatmak unnatiyon kaa sambandh anubhav or shikshan se bhi hota he or yah mukhya rup se ucch stareey kshamtaaon kaa maamla he jaise sankshepan jo kaaphi had tak aupchaarik shiksha par nirbhar karata he
 Common individual differences are seen in those ages at which specific cognitive abilities are attained, but children's schooling in industrialized countries is based on the assumption that these differences are not very large
 sangyanatmak vikaas main asaamaanya vilamb se un samskritiyon ke bacchon ke liye samasyaayein paidaa ho sakati hai jo kaam ke liye or swatantra jeevanyaapan ke liye unnat sangyanatmak kaushalon kii maang karte hai
 There are very few population differences in the area of cognitive development
 ladakon or ladakiyon ke kaushal or variyataon main kuch antar dekhne ko miltaa he lekin samoohon main bahut kuch ek saath hota he
 It seems that the differences in cognitive achievement of different ethnic groups are the result of cultural or other environmental factors
 navjaat shishuon ko sambhawatah na to dar kaa anubhav nahin hota he or na hi ve kisi vyakti vishesh ke saath sampark sthapit karne ko variyata dete hai
 They change very rapidly for about 8 to 12 months and become fearful of known threats; They also start giving preference to acquaintances and when they are separated from them or in front of a stranger, they start feeling anxious and sad
 sahanubhuti or saamaajik niyamon ko samajhane kii kshamta purvaskuli avadhi main shuru ho jaati he or vayask kaal main inkaa vikaas jari rahata he
 Friendships with older children in middle childhood and feelings of sexuality in adolescence and romantic love begin
 balykaal or aarambhik prischuli avadhi or kishoravastha ke dauraan bahut zyada krodh kaa bhav rahata he
 Some aspects of social emotional development, such as empathy, develop slowly but other aspects, such as fear, may involve a relatively abrupt restructuring of the child's experience of emotion
 yon or romantic bhaawanaaon kaa vikaas shaareerik paripakvata ke sambandh main hota he
 Genetic factors appear to control some socio-emotional developments such as fear of predation and attachment to familiar people
 anubhav is baat ko nirdhaarit karne main ek mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki koun-koun se log parichit hai, kin-kin saamaajik niyamon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he or kis tarah krodh vyakt kiya jaataa he
 It is not common for individual differences to occur in the course of socio-emotional development, but there can be a huge difference in the intensity or expressiveness of emotions from a normal child to another
 vibhinn prakaar kii pratikriyaatmakataaon kii vyaktigat pravritiyaan shaayad swaabhaavik hoti hai or unhen swabhaavgat antar ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 The abnormal development of social emotional characteristics may be slightly different or may be so severe that it may indicate mental illness
 swabhaavgat lakshanon ko jivan kaal ke dauraan sthir or tikaoo mana jaataa he
 Hopefully, children who are active and angry in infancy can be as active and angry as older children, adolescents, and adults
 bade bacchon main jansankhya antar maujuud ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke taur par yadi unhone yah siikhaa he ki bacchon dwaara bhaavana kii abhivyakti karnaa yaa ladakiyon kii tulana main agal tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa uchit he, yaa agar ek jaateey samooh ke bacchon dwaara siikhe gaye reeti-rivaaj kisi duusare bachche dwaara siikhe gaye reeti-rivaaj se alag hai
 The social and emotional differences between boys and girls of a specified age may also be associated with the time differences of pubertal characteristics of both sexes
 bahut zyada boli jane vaali shabdaawalee ko hasil karne ke alaava aise chaar mukhya kshetra hai jinamein bachche ko boli jane vaali bhashaa yaa boli kii parvaah kiye bina yogyata hasil karnaa jaruri hota he
 These are referred to as phonology or sound, semantics or coded meanings, syntax or the way of combining words and knowledge of using language in real or different circumstances
 grahanshil bhashaa main kramik vikaas hota he jisaki shuruyaat lagbhag 6 maheene kii aayu main hoti he
 However, in the construction of expressive language and words, there is a considerable boom since its introduction at the age of about one year, with a "vocabulary explosion" of rapid word acquisition in the middle of the second year
 yah shabdaawalee vistaar bole gaye shabdon ko dohraane kii kshamta se kaaphi kareeb se judaa hua he or unke uccharan main kaushal ke teevr adhigrahan ko sakasham banaata he
 Grammatical rules and word combinations appear around the age of two
 shabdaawalee or vyakaran kii maharath purvaskuli or skool ke varshon ke madhyam se dhire-dhire jari rahati he
 Adolescents still have fewer vocabularies than adults and experience more difficulty with passive voice-like structures
 ek maheene kii umr vaale bachche "ooh" dhvaniyon kaa uccharan kar sakate hai jo shaayad kisi aapasi "baatcheet" main dekharekh karne waalon ke saath sukhad baatcheet se utpann hota he
 According to Stern, this process is the communication of influence between adult and child in a mutual, rhythmic interaction
 parvarti baatcheet ke lenden kii aashaa se surasmyojan or "gez-kapaling" par vichaar kiya jaataa he jinamein shishu or vayask kii alag-alag bhoomika hoti he
 Around 6 to 9 months of age, children begin to pronounce more vowel characters and some consonant letters and "vowel" or repeat sounds such as "dadadada" in which some phonetic features of the later dialect are present
 is
 aisa mana jaataa he ki boli ke vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa vah samay he jise dekharekh karne vaale yah "anumaan" lagane main bitaate hai ki unka shishu kya kehane kii koshish kar rahaa he or is prakaar bachche ko uske saamaajik jagat ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 The relation of ideology in Shishur's utterances is called "shared memory" and forms a complex series of actions, intentions, and reactions in an instantaneous form
 yah tark diya gaya he ki bacchon kii swar pranaaliyon kaa vikaas is tarah hota he ki ye vayask kii bhashaaon ke samaanaantar hoti hai bhale hi ve na pahchaanane yogya "shabdon" kaa istemaal kar rahe hon
 pehle shabdon main namakaran yaa labling kaa kaary hota he lekin iskaa arth bhi hota he jaise "doodh" jiskaa matlab he ki "mujhe doodh chahie"
 aam taur par 18 maheene kii umr main lagbhag 20 shabdon kii shabdaawalee badhkar 21 maheene kii umr main 200 shabdon ke aasapaas ho jaati he
 From about 18 months of age, the child begins to combine words into two-word sentences
 aam taur par vayask iskaa vistaar, arth ko spasht karne ke liye karata he
 By 24–27 months of age, the child begins to form three or four-word sentences using logical syntax even if not quite accurate
 iske peeche siddhant yah he ki bachche niyamon ke ek buniyadi samooh kaa istemaal karte hai jaise bahuvachan shabdon ke liye 's' jodna yaa bahut zyada kathin shabdon se saral shabdon kaa nirmaan karnaa jaise chocolate biscuit ke liye "choskit" kaa istemaal karnaa
 After this, there is a rapid development in the grammar rules and the correct order of sentences
 aksar tukbandi main ruchi hone lagati he or kalpanaatmak naatak main aksar baatcheet ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Children's recorded monologues provide insight into the development of the process of organizing information into meaningful units
 teen saal kii umr tak baccha relative close sahit jatil vaakyon kaa istemaal karne lagata he haalaanki abhi bhi vibhinn bhashaai pranaaliyon main sudhaar kaary jari rahata he
 By the age of five, the child has started using the language quite like an adult
 lagbhag teen saal kii umr se bachche bhashaa vigyaan kii drushti se bhram yaa kalpana kaa sanket kar sakate hai, armbh or ant ke saath susangat vyaktigat kahaniyon or kaalpanik kathaon kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 It is argued that children resort to storytelling as a way of understanding their own experience and as a means of explaining their meaning to others
 vistaarit bahes main shaamil hone kii kshamta samay ke saath vayaskon or saathiyon ke saath niyamit baatcheet se utpann hoti he
 For this, the child needs to learn how to integrate his or her point of view with others' perspectives and external events, and to learn how to use linguistic indicators to prove that he or she is doing so
 ve kisase baat kar rahe hai, iske aadhaar par ve apni bhashaa ko samyojit karnaa bhi sikhte hai
 Generally, by the age of about 9 years the author can describe stories other than his own experiences, from the characters of the story and his own perspectives
 bachche ke seekhney ke kaary ko sahaj banane main vayask vaartalap kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hone ke baavjood siddhantkaron main is baat ko lekar kaaphi asahmati he ki bacchon ke aarambhik arth or arthpurna shabd, bachche ke sangyanatmak kaaryon se sambandhit aantarik karkon kii tulana main kis had tak sidhe vayask vaartalap se utpann hote hai
 Many different conclusions have been reached about the initial mapping of new words, the ability to understand words beyond context, and refining meaning
 ek pariklpana ko vaakyatmak bootstrtping pariklpana ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo vaakya sanrachana se mili vyakaran sambandhi jaankaree kaa istemaal karke ishaare se arth kaa anumaan lagane kii bachche kii kshamta ko sandarbhit karti he
 Another hypothesis is the multi-way model in which it is argued that context-bound words and context relation words follow different paths; The former is depicted based on event performances and the latter is depicted based on mental performances
 is model main paitruk input kii atyant mahatvapurn bhoomika hone ke baavjood bachche shabdon ke parvarti upyog ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye sangyanatmak prakriya par nirbhar karte hai
 Nonetheless, natural research conducted on language development has indicated that preschool children's vocabulary is significantly associated with the number of words that adults refer to them
 
 Till now, there is no theory of language acquisition that is accepted by everyone
 jor dene ke maamle main vartmaan spashtikarnon main antar he, jahaan shikshan siddhant main sudrudhikaran or anukaran par jor diya jaataa he vahiin jaivik or swadeshvaadi siddhanton main sahaj anternihit kriyavidhiyon par or ek saamaajik prasang ke bheetar adhik parsparik drushtikon par jor diya jaataa he
 Behaviorists argue that any theory of language, based on the universal presence of the physical environment and the social environment in general, must pay attention to the effects of their cognitive relationships on the personal development of language behavior
 pinkar kaa tark he ki jatil bhashaa saarvbhaumik he or iskaa ek sahaj aadhaar hota he
 Pinker's argument is based on the development of languages from Pidgin to Creole
 pigin main vyakaranik sanrachanaon ke bina baat chit karne vaale mata-pita ke bacchon main apane aap creole bhashaa kaa vikaas ho jaataa he jo manakikrut shabd kramon or vartmaan, bhavishya or bhootkaal ke markaron or sabordinate cloj se paripurna hote hai
 This has received some support from the development of the sign language of young deaf children in special schools in Nicaragua, which spontaneously developed pidgins and was later developed as a creole by the younger generation of children attending schools
 Given
 
 Slow expressive language development, a delay in the use of words with common comprehension, is characteristic of a small proportion of children who later demonstrate general language use
 dislexia bachche ke vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn vishay he kyonki lagbhag 5% jansankhya par iskaa asar padataa he
 Essentially it is a disorder that causes children to fail to acquire the language skills to read, write and spell or pronounce according to their intellectual abilities
 dislexia grast bacchon ke bhashaa vikaas main sookshm bhaashan durbalata se lekar galat uccharan or shabd dhundne main mushkilon tak, kaaphi antar dikhaai detaa he
 The most common phonological difficulties are limitations of verbal short-term memory and sound awareness
 aise bacchon ko aksar varsh ke maheenon ke naam, pahaada seekhney jaise dirghakaalik maukhik shikshan ke saath kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he; isko samajhane ke liye mukhyatah 1980 ke dashak ke antim daur kii dhwani abhaav pariklpana kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Initial manipulations, basic sound skills, and difficulties in acquiring basic building blocks mean that children with dyslexia have to invest a lot of resources in encountering only basic things rather than acquiring new information or skills
 praarambhik pahchaan se bachche vifal hone se pehle sahaayta praapt karne main sakasham ho jate hai
 Abnormal delays in language development can be a symptom of autism and language regression may indicate severe disabilities such as Rhett syndrome

 1857 The first voice that comes to our memory as soon as the mention of Braj culture is the sound of the waves of the Yamuna hitting the ghats


 Yamuna playing with Shri Krishna along with the discourses of Mahatma Buddha and Mahavir Swami from his mouth
 Hearing his waves stop
 yamuna kii ye lehren raskhaan or rahim ke dohon par jhumi hai


 surdaas or mira ke padon par naachi hai
 Yamuna gave birth to the culture of Braj


 Along with the culture of Braj, the trend of the word 'braj' reached its peak during the Bhakti movement
 chaudaavin-pandrahavin shatabdi kii krishna bhakthi kii vyapak lahar ne braj shabd kii pavitrataa ko jan-jan main purna rup se prachaarit kar diya
 The hymns of Sur, Meera and Rasakhan continue to resonate in the atmosphere of Braj even today
 krishna bhakthi main aisa kya he jisane mira se rajasi rahan-sahan chhudvaa diya or surdaas kii rachanaaon kii gaharaai ko jaanakar vishwa bhar main is vishay par hi shodh hota rahaa ki surdaas vastav main drishtiheen the bhi yaa nahin
 It is said that answers to the questions of faith are not found in history, but faith gives birth to culture and Ganga and Yamuna have also given us civilization and culture
 yamuna kii dein he mahabharat kaaleen sabhyataa or braj kaa ‘pracheenatam prajatantr’ jiske liye buddha ne mathura pravaas ke samay apane priy shishy ‘anand’ se kaha tha ki 'yah aadi rajya he, jisane apane liye mahasammat chunaa tha

 Later in the early eighteenth century, the sport re-emerged in England as open-toed boxing, often referred to as prizefighting
 The first documented account of an open-toed battle in England appeared in the London Protestant Mercury in 1681, and in 1719 James Fig became the first winner of an open-toed game
 This is the time when the word "boxing" first began to be used
 is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chaiye yah ki aadhunik mukkebaazi kaa yah shuruyaat rup bahut adhik bhinn tha

 The rules of boxing, known as Broughton's Law, were introduced for the first time in 1743 by Jack Broughton, the winner of the high weight boxing box, in order to protect players in the ring, where death sometimes occurred

 Given
 aadhunik vyavsaayik mukkebaazi main, purushon ke liye ek kamarband pahananaa aavashyak hota he, jise unki jaangh ke upree hisse or qamar ke nichle hisse main lapeta jaataa he

 In boxing, no two players have the same styles
 Their style develops as boxers apply what they learn during their practice and whatever is appropriate for themselves
 phir bhi, aisi anek shabdaawaliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo mote taur par ek mukkebaaz kii style kaa varnan karti hai
 Note that to describe a boxer it is not necessary to be limited to one of these terminology
 a player can complete in both internal fighting and external fighting, a good example of which are Manny Pacquiao and Bernard Hopkins, and may also have a unique style of boxers that cannot be easily incorporated into any category, such as Naseem Hamid
 ek paaramparik "mukkebaaz" yaa shailikar tezi se, lambii duuri ke mukke maarthe hue, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se chubhaate hue or antat apane pratidwandvi ko neeche gira kar apane or pratidwandvi ke bich antar banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karata he
 Because of this dependence on weak punches, the out-fighter tends to win by the decision of points rather than knock-outs, although some out-fighters have notable knock-out records
 aksar unhen mukkebaazi ke sarvshereshth ranneetikaar bhi mana jaataa he kyonki unamem ladaai kii gati ko niyantrit kar paane or apane pratidwandvi kaa netritv karne kii kshamta hoti he, jiske dwaara ve yojanabaddh rup se use parajeet kar dete hai or kisi brollar kii tulana main adhik kushalta or yogyata kaa parichay dete hai
 Extraterrestrials require access, hand movements, reaction, and foot movements
 ullekhneey bahya-yoddhaon main mohammad ali, jin tanni, azard charles, vili pep, meldrik tailor, laire homes, roy jones junior, sugar re leonard, auskar de laa hoya or jo kalzeg shaamil hai
 a boxer-puncher is a fully fledged boxer who is able to fight short distances with a combination of technique and power, often defeating his opponent in a single box by a combination and in some situations
 unki gatividhi or kaushal ek bahya-yoddha ke samaan hi hote hai, lekin nirnay ke dwaara jeetne ke bajaay ve sanyojanon kaa prayog apane pratidwandvi se aage badhane or ek nock-out score praapt karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 To be able to use this style, a boxer must be fully developed
 ullekhneey pancharon main maini packveo, sam langford, henry armastrang, jo louis, sugar re robinsan, tony xel, archi moore, carlos monzon, alexis argvelo, erik morels, lennox levis, vladimir clitshko, terry noris or thomas harns shaamil hai
 a brawler is a player who lacks aptitude and foot movement in the ring, but who accomplishes this by his proficiency in boxing
 anek brollar gatishiltaa ko kam rakhane kaa prayaas karte hai, kam gatisheel rahane ko praathamikta dete hai, adhik sthir dharaatal chaahate hai or apane pairon ko tej gati se chalaane vaale khilaadiyon kaa muqabla kar paane main unhen kathinaayee mahasoos hoti he
 They may also have the tendency to ignore combination boxing and instead continue with one-handed boxing and lower-speed and more powerful boxing
 unki mand gati or purvanumey pattern ke kaaran aksar unhen pratikaarak mukkon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he, atah safal broleron ke liye yah anivaary he ki ve sazaa ko paryaapt maatra ko sah paane main sakasham hon
 shakti or sahansheeltaa ek brollar kii sarvaadhik mahatvapurn sampattiyaan hoti hai
 Notable broilers include David Tua, Ricky Hatton, Stanley Keuchel, Max Bayer, Jack Lamotta, Roberto Duran, Rocky Graziano, Sonny Liston and George Foreman, Juan Urango
 antahyoddha / swormar apane pratidwandvi ke nikat bane rahane kaa prayaas karata he or achaanak teevr akraman karte hue or hook tathaa apper-cat ke sangyojan kaa prayog karata he
 a successful injection often requires a good "chin" because in swarming one often encounters multiple jabs before getting close to their opponent, where they are more effective
 antahyoddha kam duuri par apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hai kyonki saamanytah ve chote kad ke hote hai or pratidwandvi kii tulana main unki pahunch kam hoti he or isaliye ve kam duuri par zyada prabhavi hote hai, jahaan unke pratidwandvi ko apane lambey haathon ke kaaran mukke maarane main kathinaayee hoti he
 However, there are some players who, despite being longer than their category, have adapted well to both inter-war and external war
 ek swormar kaa mul-mantra bina ruke hamalaa karte rahanaa he
 Many short-tempered legends take advantage of their stature and use the bob-and-weave defense to defend themselves by keeping their waist slightly bent, moving them down or next to the punches
 avrodh ke vipareet, yadi pratidwandvi ke mukka vyarth chalaa jaae, to isse uskaa taal-mail bighad jaataa he, jisase khilaadi ko aage badhkar pratidwandvi mukkebaaz kii tani hui baanh kii seemaa ke bheetar pahunch jane kaa mauka mil jaataa he or javaabi hamalaa karne ke liye uske haath khule hue hote hai
 One of the distinct advantages that the intuition receives when hitting uppercuts is that they can load their entire body with a punch; Mike Tyson was famous for destroyer uppercut
 kuch antahyoddha apane kathor waar ke liye kukhyat rahe hai
 Aggression, patience, tolerance and bobbing-and-weaving are the most important for a swarmer
 ullekhneey antahyoddhaon main mike tison, harry greb, jaik dempsy, rocky marciano, jo frezier, jack lamota or julio seizar shauez shaamil hai
 Respondent boxers are indecisive, defensive-style players who often rely on their opponent's mistakes to gain an advantage, whether it is on the score card or more preferably a knock-out
 ve hamalon se bachane ke liye apni purna viksit pratiraksha kaa prayog karte hai or phir sahi samay par ek sateek mukka maar kar apane pratidwandvi ko turant parrast kar dete hai
 Thus, fighting against a responding boxer requires constant deception and never letting his box be guessed, so that the responding boxer cannot make a good attack
 is style kaa prayog karke safal hone ke liye unamem acchhee pratikriya, buddhi, mukke kii achookta or haathon kii acchhee gati hona anivaary hota he
 Notable respondent boxers include Floyd Mayweather, Jr
, Jerry Quarry, Ricardo Lopez, Bernard Hopkins, Vitali Klitschko, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Evander Holyfield, Juan Manuel Marquez, and Pernell Whitaker
 anya shaileyon ke viruddh inamen se prayek mukkebaazi style se milane vaale laabh ke bare main ek saamanytah sweekrut niyam he
 In general, an intra-warrior gains more than an extraterrestrial, an extraterrestrial gains more than a puncture, and a puncture gains more than an intransigent; Thus each style is stronger than one genre and weaker than the other, creating a cycle of sorts and no one dominates the other like the rock-paper-scissors game
 Naturally, many other factors, such as the level of skill and the training of players, determine the outcome of the bout, but this belief is widely accepted in the minds of boxers and writers regarding the relationship between genres
 Is that "style wins the battle
" brollar swormaron yaa antahyoddhaon par haaavee hone kaa prayaas karte hai kyonki slogar ke nikat aane kaa prayaas karne par, antah yoddha ko nirapavaad rup se bahut adhik kathortapurvak akraman kar rahe brollar kii bandook kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, atah, jab tak antahyoddha main bahut adhik sahansheeltaa na ho or brollar kii shakti bahut kamazor na ho, tab tak brollar kii majboot shakti hi vijayi hogi
 jo frezier ke khilaaf jorge forman kii nock-out jeet is prakaar ke milan ke laabh kaa ek prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Although internal warriors struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy greater success against out-fighters or boxers
 bahya-yoddha ek dhimi ladaai pasand karte hai, jisamen unke or pratidwandvi ke bich kuch antar ho
 Intemperance attempts to bridge this gap and to uncover furious attacks
 bhitari bhaag main, bahya-yoddha apni ladane kii prabhavakaarita kaa bahut sara bhaag kho detaa he kyonki vah kathor mukke maar paane main sakasham nahin hota
 saamanytah is sthiti main antahyoddha safal rahata he kyonki apane pratidwandvi par laabh kii tivrata or acchhee dakshata ke kaaran use haraa paanaa kathin ho jaataa he
 For example, the swarmer who was easily defeated by slugger George Foreman was able to create many other problems for him in his three encounters with Frazier boxer Muhammad Ali
 sanyas ke baad jo louis ne yah sweekaar kiya ki unhen ghir jane se nafrat thi or mukt / aparajit vijeta rocky marciano jaise swormar louis ke sarvshereshth daur main bhi unke liye style kii samasya utpann kar paane main sakasham hue hote
 Boxers or out-fighters are the most successful, unlike a brawler whose slow pace and weak technique make him a simple target of a fast out-fighter attack
 bahya-yoddha kii mukhya chintaa sajag bane rahanaa hoti he kyonki brollar ko apana khel puraa karne ke liye keval ek acha mukka maarane kii zarurat hoti he
 If the extraterrestrial could survive those powerful blows, he could often defeat Brawler by his sharp punches
 yadi vah paryaapt rup se safal ho, to baad ke chakron main atirikt dabaav daalkar vah ek nock-out hasil karne kaa prayaas bhi kar saktaa he
 Most traditional boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers
 meldrik tailor, mukkebaaz yaa bahya-yoddha, ke khilaaf julio seizar shauez, ek swormar yaa antahyoddha, ke bich aitihaasik muqabla style milan kaa ek udhaaharan he 
 shauez kii jabardast mukkebaazi kshamta or tailor kii andhadhundh gati ke ek sanket ke rup main is mukaable ko "thander mits litening" kii sangya di gai thi
 Chavez was a symbol of the "mexican" style of boxing
 ve lagaataar peechha karte rahete the or duusare khilaadi kii seemaa main aage badhate rahete the, bhale hi unhen nikat duuri par aane ke kaaran kitni hi sazaa bhugatni pade, jiske baad ve apane pratidwandvi ko sazaa diya karte the, jo yaa to sharir par ek bhayankar akraman ke rup main hota tha, jiske parinamswaroop pratidwandvi yaa to dard or thakaan ke kaaran gir jaataa tha yaa atyadhik thakaan ke kaaran apana bachaav kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he or tab shauez uske sir par hamalaa karke use ek nock-out ke dwaara parrast kar dete the
 During the fight, Taylor's early motion with his hands and feet and his boxing abilities gave him an early advantage, which led to a huge lead in points, but in the end Chavez's punishment defeated Taylor and the final leg
 a gruesome punch punched by the right hand knocked him down, leading to his defeat

 Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and practice without wearing hand / wrist coverings and boxing gloves
 Hand coverings are used to protect the bones of the hands, and gloves are used to protect the hands from any fatal injury, giving boxers a chance to punch with more force than that, They would have been killed without using them
 Gloves have been essential to competition since the late nineteenth century, although modern boxing gloves are much heavier than gloves worn by early twentieth-century players
 mukkebaazi ke mukaable se purv, donon mukkebaaz mukaable main prayog kiye jane vaale dastaanon ke bhaar par aapasi sahmati bana lete hai, is samaj ke saath ki halke dastaane baari mukkebaazon ko adhik kshati pahunchaate hai
 The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so it is often agreed before a match
 daaton va masoodon ko chot se bachaane ke liye or thodhi kaa bachaav karne ke liye ek mukh-rakshak bhi aavashyak hota he, jisase nock-out kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags
 pratikriyaaon or doharaavpurn dhang se mukke maarane ke kaushal ko painaa karne ke liye ek choti, aansu kii boond ke aakaar kii "speed bag" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jabaki shaktishaalee dhang se mukke maarane or sharir par hone vaale bheeshan praharon kaa abhyaas karne ke liye ek badi belanaakaar "haivi bag" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo ret, ek sanshleshit padaarth athwa jal se bhari hui hoti he
 In addition to these specialized materials of equipment, boxers also use more common training equipment to increase their strength, speed and patience
 saamaanya prashikshan upkarnon main free wates, rowing mashin, jump rope or medicine balls shaamil hai
 Modern boxing postures differ significantly from typical boxing postures of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
 aadhunik mudra main haathon kii raksha ke liye ek zyada urdhv guard hota he, jabaki beesvin sadi ke praarambhik daur ke hook prayoktaaon, jaise jaik johnson, dwaara apanaaya gaya guard adhik kshaitij hota tha, jisamen anguliyon ke jod saamne kii ore hua karte the
 Honest approach arddh-jhukna Full bend ek purnatah khadi mudra main, mukkebaaz pairon ko apane donon kandhon ke baraabar kii duuri par rakhkar khadaa hota he or pichhlaa pair agle pair se aadha-kadam peeche rakhaa jaataa he
 The right-handed fighter or orthodox boxer puts forward his left leg and left fist
 donon pair samanaantar hote hai or dahini edi zamin se upar uthi hui hoti he
 The front fist is positioned vertically at a distance of about six inches in front of the face in the eyes
 pichhali mutthi ko thodhi kii bagal main rakhaa jaataa he or kohni pasaliyon ke dhaanche ke saamne hoti he, taaki sharir kii raksha kii ja sake
 The chin is tilted toward the chest to avoid punches on the jaw, which often lead to knock-outs, and the chin is often slightly off the center
 kalaaiyaan thodi jhuki hui hoti hai, taaki mukke maarthe samay hone vaali kisi sambhavit kshati se bachaa ja sake or pasaliyon kii suraksha ke liye kohniyon ko dabaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 Some boxers fight forward by leaning slightly forward and keeping their feet close together
 yahaan varnit mudra ko "textbook" mudra mana jaataa he or khilaadiyon ko is baat ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he ki ek baar isamen maharath hasil kar lene par ise aadhaar maanakar ve isamen badlaav karte rahen
 isi bindu kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, kuch tej mukkebaaz apane haathon ko neeche rakhte hai or unke pair lagbhag atishyoktipurna mudra main hote hai, jabaki brollar athwa buli mukkebaaz dhimi gati se apane pratidwandviyon kaa saamana karne kaa prayaas karte he
 Left-handed or southpaw players use the orthodox posture, which can cause problems in front of orthodox players who are not used to attack, hook or cross from the opposite direction
 This Southpaw pose, in contrast, proves to be weak against a straight right hand
 uttari amareeki khilaadi ek adhik santulit mudra ko pasand karte hai, jisamen ve lagbhag vargakar rup se pratidwandvi ke saamne khadey hokar uskaa muqabla karte hai, jabaki anek europea khilaadiyon kii mudra is prakaar kii hoti he ki unka dhad bagal main adhik muda hua hota he
 The position of the hands can also vary as some players prefer to keep both hands in front of the face, which increases the risk of body blows
 kabhi-kabhi aadhunik mukkebaazon ko apane gaalon yaa maathe ko apni mutthiyon se thapthapate hue dekha ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara ve swayan ko yaad dilaate hai ki unhen apane haath upar rakhane hai 
 mukkebaazon ko apane pairon ko gatisheel banaae rakhane kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, taaki ve prabhavi rup se apni chaal chal saken
 agr-gaman main saamne vaale pair ko uthaanaa or pichley pair se aage badhanaa shaamil hota he
 Posterior movement involves lifting the hind leg and moving backward from the next leg
 parshvik gati ke dauraan gati kii disha main sthit pair pehle badhata he, jabaki vipareet disha main sthit pair sharir ko hilaane ke aavashyak bal pradaan karata he
 There are basically four types of punches in boxing: jab, straight right / left hand, hook and uppercut
 If a boxer plays with the right hand, his left hand is the next hand and the right hand is the previous hand
 ek baayen haath vaale mukkebaaz yaa southpow ke liye, haathon kii yah sthiti ulti ho jaati he
 For clarity, the following discussion considers a right-handed boxer
 chubhaana Cross-counter in-punch with a looping ankuda cutting kam sidhe mukka - kam range main or kareeb range main Cross-counter aadhe se kaatna - ek vistrut kaatna kaa ek sangyojan / sidhe mukka Half Hook - a combination of a wide hook / straight punch mukkon ke ye vibhinn prakaar anek sanyojanon yaa "combo" kaa nirmaan karne ke liye teevr anukram main prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 The most common is the combination of jab and cross, which is named the "one-to-combo"
 yah saamanytah ek prabhavi sangyojan hota he kyonki jaib ke kaaran pratidwandvi cross ko dekh nahin paata, jisase iskaa prayog adhik safai or bal ke saath kar paanaa saral ho jaataa he
 a large, swinging circular punch starting from a rooster-like position, with the arm extended longer than the hook and with all the player's power behind it, sometimes a "roundhouse", " Also called "haemaker" or sucker-punch
 sharir ke bhaar or ek vyapak chaap ke bheetar kendrabhisari bal ke aadhaar par, roundouse ek shaktishaalee prahaar ho saktaa he, lekin yah aksar junglee or aniyantrit ghunsa hota he, jise maarane vaala khilaadi iske baad apana santulan kho detaa he or uskaa raksha-kavach khul jaataa he
 Another drawback of wide, cyclic punches is that they take too long to kill, giving the opponent sufficient warning to react and respond
 is kaaran, hemekar yaa roundouse ek paaramparik ghunsa nahin he or prashikshak ise kamazor takanic yaa hataasha kaa pratik maanate hai
 Due to its immense potential power, it is sometimes used to end the game of an opponent who is already wobbling and does not see the possibility or ability to take advantage of that weak position
 Ho, in which this punch brings the person using it
 durlabh avasaron par prayog kiya jane vaala ek anya aparamparaagat ghunsa "bolo panch " he, jisamen pratidwandvi apane ek haath ko ek chaude chaap main kai baar jhulaata he, saamanytah dhyaan bantane ke liye or iske baad usee haath se yaa duusare haath se ghunsa martha he
 a boxer can use a number of basic tricks to avoid or prevent punches, which are demonstrated and described below
 skhalan Jerk avaruddh cover up jakadna Footwork dur kheenchna There are many defensive positions, which are used in boxing
 prayek style ke bheetar, mukkebaazon ke bich paryaapt vividhta hoti he kyonki kuch mukkebaaz apane sir kaa bachaav karne ke liye rakshak ko oonchai par rakh sakate hai, jabaki anya mukkebaaz sharir par aane vaale ghunson se bachaav ke liye apane rakshak ko neeche rakh sakate hai
 Many players change their defensive style throughout the match to choose the most appropriate position to defend themselves according to the situation at that moment
 ek sidhi khadi mudra kaa prayog karne vaale mukkebaaz apni thodhi kaa bachaav pichley haath ke dwaara ek nichali yaa mishrit rakshak style main karte hai, jo ki neeche pradarshit he
 Battling players commonly use the "peak-a-boo" style, which is discussed below
 kam guard Mixed guard peak-a-bu Boxers generally try to use high, fast combinations and then immediately change their position, so as to avoid any possible reaction from the opponent
 ranneetik rup se, saamanytah is chakra ke centre main rahanaa vaanchit hota he kyonki aisa hone par mukkebaaz apane pratidwandvi ko unke chaaron ore sthit vrutt par jane par baadhya karke gatividhi ko ulat paane main sakasham ho jaataa he
 If the boxer is in the center, it is also less likely to be pushed backwards and dropped onto the ropes that surround the ring and seize it
 mukkebaaz kii style ke aadhaar par, kendriya sthiti vaanchit hoti he kyonki pratidwandvi par adhikaar kar lenaa sadaiv hi ek acchhee ranneeti he
 However, most players will not move around the boxer in the center as they become vulnerable to strikes at good angles
 gatishiltaa hi ring main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn saadhan he or yah khilaadi ko un mukkon se bachane kaa mauka detii he, jinka anumaan nahin kiya gaya tha
 If a boxer is standing still, his opponent has a better chance of striking him
 sthir rahakar kisi prahaar kaa purvanumaan kar rahe khilaadi ke batch paane kii sambhaavna gatisheel khilaadi kii tulana main kam hoti he
 Speak punch overhand Floyd Mayweather Jr
 used a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which resulted in Hatton's head hitting the corner pole and then knocking him down
 nocdown ke baad bhi haton punah apane pairon par khadey ho paane main safal rahe, lekin spasht rup se ve stabdh dikhaai de rahe the or kuch hi kshanon baad mewedar ne mukkon kii jhadi laga di, jiske kaaran haton canvas par gir pade or mewedar ko dasven chakra main ek tii ke o jeet tathaa haton ko unki aaj tak kii pehali haar mili
 In boxing, each player is given a corner in the ring, where he rests between the chakras and where the coaches stand
 vishisht rup se, kone main swatah mukkebaaz ke atirikt teen log khadey rahete hai; ye hai, prashikshak, sahaayak prashikshak tathaa katman
 saamanytah prashikshak va sahaayak mukkebaaz ko is bare main salaah dete hai ki vah kahaan galati kar rahaa he or yadi vah haar rahaa ho, to uskaa hausala badhaate hai
 Cutman is a skin doctor who is responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free from wounds and blood
 yah vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he kyonki anek mukaable aise ghaavon ke kaaran roak diye jate hai, jinase mukkebaaz kii ankhon par aghat hone kaa bhay ho
 Additionally, it is their responsibility to stop the game even if those in the corner feel that their player is in serious danger of a permanent injury
 kabhi-kabhi kone main khadey log ek safed tauliya bhi fekenge, jo ek mukkebaaz ke aatm-samarpan ko suchit karata he 
 ise diego corells or flid mewedar ke bich hui ladaai main dekha ja saktaa he
 In that fight, the people in Corrales 'corner surrendered despite Corrales' strong refusal
 kisi vyakti ko mukka markar behosh kar dene yaa yahaan tak ki kam gambhir aghat lagane par bhi sthaayee rup se mastishk ko kshati pahunch sakati he
 There is no clear division of how much force is needed to make a person fall, and how much force can cause a person to die
 1980 se, ring ke bheetar yaa prashikshan ke dauraan lagi choton ke kaaran 200 se adhik shaukia or vyavsaayik mukkebaaz or taffman khilaadiyon kii maut ho chuki he
 Hence, in 1983, the Journal of the American Medical Association sought to ban boxing
 iske sampadak doctor jorge lundaurg ne mukkebaazi ko ek "foohadataa" qaraar diya, "jise kisi bhi sabhy samaaj dwaara sweekaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
" tabhi se, british, canadai or australian medical associyeshan bhi mukkebaazi ko pratibandhit karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Proponents of this ban argue that boxing is the only sport that aims to harm another player
 british medical associyeshan ke mukkebaazi pravaktaa doctor bill o' nil ne mukkebaazi par bi em e ke prastaavit pratibandh kaa samarthan kiya he: "yah akelaa aisa khel he, jiskaa lakshya aapke pratidwandvi ko gambhir chot pahunchaana hota he or ham yah mahasoos karte hai ki hamen avashya hi mukkebaazi ko purna-rup se pratibandhit kar dena chahie
" 2007 main, shaukia mukkebaazon par kiye gayi ek adhyayan ne darshaya ki sir par pahane jane vaale rakshaatmak kavach ne mastishk ko hone vaali kshati se raksha nahin kii, or ek anya adhyayan ne paaya ki shaukia mukkebaazon main mastishk kii kshati kaa atyadhik khatra tha

 Language development is a process that begins much earlier in human life
 navjaat bina kisi bhashaa ke janm letaa he kintu maatr 10 maas main hi boli gayi baton ko anya dhvaniyon se alag karne main sakasham ho gaya hota he
 Generally, productive language is thought to begin with a phase of early communication in which infants use gestures and speech to make their intentions known to others
 According to a general theory of development, new forms Then move on to older tasks, so that children can learn words to express the same conversational function they have already expressed by erotic means Not
 saidhantik dhaanche sampadan Main article: Language acquisition bhashaa ke vikaas ko seekhney kii saadhaaran prakriyaaon ke dwaara aage badhanaa mana jaataa he jisamen bacchon ko bhashaai input se shabdon, arthon or shabdon ke prayog or bolne kaa upyog hota he
 The method in which we develop language skills is universal; However, the main debate is how the rules of syntax are acquired
 vaakyavinyas ke vikaas ke liye do pramukh drushtikon hai, ek anubhavvaadi khaataa jiske dwaara bacchon ne bhashaai input se sabhi vaakyavinyas niyam or ek naitikwaadi drushtikon praapt kiya he jiske dwaara kuch siddhant vaakyavinyas janmajaat hai or maanav jinom ke madhyam se preshit hai
 The consequentialist theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky, argues that language is a unique human achievement
 chomski kahati he ki sabhi bacchon ko ek sahaj bhashaa adhigrahan divaais kaha jaataa he
 Theoretically, LAD is a region of the brain that has universal syntax rules for all languages
 yah upkaran sikhi shabdaawalee kaa upyog karke upanyaas vaakya banane kii kshamta vaale bacchon ko pradaan karata he
 Chomsky claims that the idea that children listen — their linguistic input — is not enough to explain how they learn the language
 unka tark he ki paryaavaran se bhashaai input simit or trutiyon se bharaa he
 Therefore, nativists believe that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information from their environment
 haalanki, kyonki bacchon ke paas is lead he, ve vastav main, unke vaataavaran se apurna jaankaree ke baavjood bhashaa seekhney main sakasham hai
 This approach has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as seen by the number of articles in journals and books
 anubhavvaadi siddhant bataata he, chomski ke khilaaf, ki bhashaai input praapt karne vaale bacchon main paryaapt jaankaree he or isliye, ek sahaj bhashaa adhigrahan divaais ko grahan karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Compared to LAD was developed more specifically for language, empiricists believe that normal brain processes are sufficient for language acquisition
 is prakriya ke dauraan, bachche ke liye sakriy rup se apane paryaavaran ke saath sanlagn hona aavashyak he
 For a child to learn the language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of communicating appropriately with the child; This is known as child-directed speech
 sidies kaa prayog kiya jaataa he taaki bacchon ko unki bhashaa ke liye aavashyak bhashaai jaankaree di ja sake
 Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes with an interactionist view
 sankhyikeey bhashaa adhigrahan, jo anubhavvaadi siddhant ke antargat aata he, suzav dete hai ki shishuon ko pattern dharna ke madhyam se bhashaa praapt hoti he
 Other researchers accept an interactivist perspective, which incorporates socio-interactive theories of language development
 is tarah ke drushtikon main, bachche interactive or sanvadatmak sandarbh main bhashaa sikhte hai, sanchaar kii sarthak chaal ke liye bhashaa ke rup sikhte hai
 These theories focus primarily on caregivers' attitudes and attention to their children in order to promote productive language habits

 This perspective has not been widely accepted at any time, but by some accounts, is experiencing a resurgence from new studies
 This theory is now used to treat individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders
 iske atirikt, relational frem theory vyavahaaravaadi siddhant se bad rahaa he, jo ki swikaton or cametment therapy ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Some empirical theories nowadays use behavioral models

 The Planetary Society's mission is to explore in the solar system, search for and search for near-earth objects and non-earthly creatures
 saadharantaya logon kaa yah vichaar he ki falon kaa utpaadan laabhprad nahin hota
 There are several reasons for this belief: in sab kaarnon se pedo kii fasal acchhee nahin hoti or baag se koi laabh nahin hota
 If the garden is properly planted and properly cared for later, there is no reason for no benefit
 falon kaa baag ke liye sthaan chunate samay nimnlikhi baaten dhyaan main rakhni chahie : 1
 Always choose a place where the land is fertile
 kankad patharwali or unchi nichi jameen fal ke pedo ke liye upyukt nahin hoti
 Ksharwali, which contains nona and sandy land is also bad for fruit trees
 halaki damat bhoomi, jisamen pani kaa nikaas acha ho, sab prakaar ke falon ke pedo ke liye uttam hoti he
 2
 It is very important to manage the irrigation of trees
 keval nahar ke pani ke bharose bada baag laga daalana uchit nahin
 If the canal water is not available due to any reason, the crop, or other trees, suffer a lot of damage
 baag main kam se kam mithe pani kaa ek kuan hona atyant aavashyak he
 Saline water often damages fruit trees
 yadi 15 acre kaa baag lagaana ho or sinchai kaa prabandh keval chah acre kaa ho, to baag paanch paanch acre karke teen yaa chaar baar main lagaana chahie, kyonki jab ped or puraane ho jate hai, tab unako bahut adhik sinchai kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 3
 The garden should always be planted near a paved road or railway station, so that the produce of the garden can reach the market or mandi for sale conveniently and on time
 shahar se bahut dur gaanv ke andar baag lagane se fasalon ko mandi tak pahunchaane main bahut pareshaani hoti he or kharchaa tathaa samay bhi bahut lagata he
 Due to the time it takes to reach the market, the fruits start getting spoiled
 4
 jahaan tak ho, baag kisi jangal ke paas nahin lagaana chahie
 Being near the forest often causes damage to trees and crops due to indigo, pigs, deer and sparrows etc
 and there is a lot of difficulty in protecting them and costs more
 5
 baag lagane se pehle ek baat or dhyaan main rakhane kii yah he ki sthaan aisa ho ki aavashyaktaa padane par aasapaas se uchit manjuuri par majdoor mil saken
 Sometimes the garden crop is killed due to lack of laborers when needed
 ek baar baag ke liye bhoomi kaa chunaav kar lene par usamen lagaae janevaale pedo kii kismon kaa chunaav karnaa shesh rah jaataa he
 For this, the following things should be kept in mind: pedo kii kismein hameshaa bhoomi ke anusaar hi chunanaa chahie
 Kalmi should not be planted in less fertile soil
 aise sthaan main amaruud aadi kathor kismein hi lagaani chahie
 In the same way, trees of lisora, plum, amla, etc
 can be planted in slightly penniless and poor land
 pani thaharanevaale sthaan main turamile fal ke ped, jaise santara, malta, neembu aadi, nahin lagaana chahie, kyonki pani main turasile fal ke pedo kii jaden galkar kharaab ho jaati hai
 Guava can be found at such a place to some extent
 kankadavali jameen main aam nahin lagaana chahie
 By looking at the land, if the varieties of fruit trees were chosen without taking into account all these things, then there is always a possibility of loss due to planting of wrong type of trees
 kismon kaa chunaav us sthaan kii jalwaayu ke anusaar hi karnaa chahie
 Trees of cold regions, such as apples, apricots, pears, etc
, should be expected to bear fruit if planted in the warm plains
 isi prakaar gamar jalwayuvale fal, jaise kelaa, papeeta aadi, pahari thande pradeshon main nahin lag sakate
 Grapefruit does not occur in places with high rainfall
 isi prakaar bhinn kism ke fal ke ped bhinn prakaar kii jalwaayu chaahate hai or falon ke pedo kii kism hameshaa vahaan kii jalwaayu ke anusaar hi chunanaa chahie
 One thing should be kept in mind that it is beneficial to plant fruit trees whose demand is good in the market and varieties whose fruits are expected to get good prices in the market
 saste raddi kism ke fal ke ped lagaana laabhprad nahin hota
 It would be better to plant a garden with the opinion of the employees of the Horticulture Department for selection of varieties
 jis bhoomi main baag lagaana he yadi usamen pehle se kheti hoti rahi he, to use thik karne main adhik kathinaayee nahin hoti
 To know how the land below is, five or six feet deep pits should be dug in many places throughout the land
 sarvapratham bhoomi ke jangal kii safai karnaa chahie
 Wild trees and shrubs of Acacia etc
 should be cut
 keval upar se tana kaat dene se jhaadiyaan dobaaraa bad jaati hai, isliye prayek ped or jhaadi ko khodakar jad sahit nikaal dena chahie
 One can leave a tree of two shady places in such a place where the gardener's hut is to be built
 baad main aavashyaktaa na rahane par ve kaate ja sakate hai
 After cleaning the forest it is necessary to unify the land surface
 yadi sataha thik nahin hoti to sinchai karne main bhi asuvidha hoti he
 Not all trees have uniform water
 varshakaal kaa pani bhi neeche sthaan main bhar jaataa he or pedo ko haani pahunchati he
 The land surface should be repaired by seeing the facility of irrigation drains
 yadi puri bhoomi ko ek sa chauras karnaa sambhav na ho, to usko do yaa adhik bhaagon main baantkar har bhaag ko alag alag samtal kar lenaa chahie
 In mountainous areas, where there are no large flat plains, similar terraced fields are built
 iske baad sambhav ho to puure khete kii ek gahari jutai kar deni chahie
 This makes the ground brittle and rain water also reaches the ground properly
 sapaat jameen main adhiktar varsha kaa pani bah jaataa he
 If possible, by sowing green manure crop, such as linseed, etc
 in the entire letter, the land gets good manure
 iske baad puri bhoomi main ped lagane ke sthanon main chhri laga dena chahie
 If a map is drawn on paper before it is planted on the ground, it is easy to make the mark and there is no mistake
 rekhankan kii kai vidhiyaan hoti hai, jaise vargakar, shatbhujakar, ytaakar aadi
 The square method is simple and most common
 is vidhi main ped se ped kaa faasla or line se line kaa faasla ek samaan hota he or aas paas ke chaar pedo ko sidhi rekha se milaane par ek varg ban jaataa he
 Before starting the marking, it is necessary to insert a straight base row
 yah aadharbhuja aas paas kii pakki sadak, athwa imaarat yaa paas lage hue baag, ke samaantar daali ja sakati he, athwa bhoomi kaa aakaar dekhakar uske anusaar daali ja sakati he
 Then graphing can be done easily on the same basis
 pedo ko uchit faasale par lagaana atyant mahatvapurn he
 Often in the greed to plant more and more trees in the land, people used to plant trees nearby
 ped passh paas lagane se unako puraa failane kii jagah nahin milti
 As they grow, they are mixed together
 ghaney baag main dhoop or hawa nahin pahunchati or pedo main acchhee fasal nahin hoti
 Only in the crest, where little sun and wind reaches, some fruits are produced, which are both difficult to guard and break
 is kaaran ped sadaa uchit faasale par lagaana chahie
 Following are the distances of the main fruit trees: deshi aam - 40 foot Kalmi Mango - 35 feet amaruud - 25 foot Lemon - 20 feet lichi - 30 foot Hide and seek - 25 feet papeeta - 8 foot After putting the tree traces in the ground, three-foot wide and three-foot deep round pits should be dug there
 gadde khodne kaa kaam june tak kar lenaa chahie, taaki varsha prarambh hone se pehle gaddhon kii mitti ko kam se kam 15 din evam hawa lag jaae
 Remove the pebbles, stones etc
 from the soil of the pits and mix almost part of the rotten cow dung in it
 phir gadde main pani bharne se mitti baith jaati he, isliye gaddho ko bharte samay mitti kii sataha jameen se lagbhag do inch unchi rakhni chahie
 When there is good rainfall twice, then trees should be planted in the middle of the pits
 ped lagaate samay yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ped gadde main usee gaharaai tak lage, jitna vah pehle kyari yaa gamale main laga tha
 Due to deep planting, the trunk of the tree gets buried in the soil and it is expected to rot
 isi prakaar uthlaa ped lagane se uski jaden khul jaati hai or ped ko haani pahunchati he
 If there is no rain, then after planting the tree, water it immediately
 ped sadaa kisi vishwasaneey jagah se lenaa chahie, chaahe uskaa mulya kuch adhik hi dena pade
 If trees of the wrong varieties are planted initially, a lot of damage is likely
 phalne par jab maaloom padataa he ki kharaab or galat kismon ke ped lag gaye hai us samay sivaa un pedo ko nikaalkar nae ped lagane ke or koi upaay nahin rahata
 Thus, a lot of time and money is wasted
 isliye kaaphi khojbin karke or thik kism ke ped hi lagaana chahie
 The following things should be noted in garden care: garam hawaayen sadaa pashchim se or thandhi hawaayen uttar se chalati hai
 To prevent these strong, hot and frosty winds, a thick row of trees growing in the north and west direction of the garden should be planted
 is pankti ko wind brake kehete hai
 For wind break, apply rosewood, native mango, berries etc
 pedo kaa faasla lagbhag 10-15 foot tak rakhte hai, jisase ve ghaney hokar sidhe or lambey badhate hai
 In order to protect the small trees from heat and frost, in the summer and winter, a small straw that surrounds the tree is open in the east direction, so that the tree gets sunlight and wind
 tattiyaan keval pedo kii unheen kismon main bandhate hai jinako lu evam paale se marane kaa andeshaa rahata he, jaise aam, papeeta, lukath aadi
 Deep irrigation in summer and winter also prevents heat and frost
 baag main junglee jaanavar, choupaae aadi ko ghusane se rokane ke lae baag ke chaaron ore baadh lagaana aavashyak he
 One way to do this is to dig a ditch around three feet deep and deposit its soil in the form of a wide and high ridge on the side of the trench
 yah khai or unchi med acchhee roak bana leti he
 If euphoria or hawthorn etc
 are placed on this ridge, then there will be more protection
 baag ke chaaron or kantedaar ghani jhaadi, jaise karaunda, khatta, babul aadi bhi, laga sakate hai
 Nowadays there is a practice of barbed wire
 yadi chah foot unche khambhon main kantedaar taar kii chaar lard lagaakar baag ko gher diya jaae, to bhi baag kii raksha hoti he
 To protect fruits from harmful animals, such as birds and monkeys, etc
, a man has to be kept, who runs firecrackers, slingshot, etc
 to protect the crop
 jaade main pattee giraanevaale kuch pedo, jaise phalsa, anjir, shahatut aadi, kii salanaa kataai chhantai kerani padati he
 By pruning them, new branches grow out and produce good and considerable fruit
 salanaa kataai na karne se inamen keval gini chuni shakhaayen nikalati hai, jinamein keval thode se fal lagate hai
 They are harvested when they drop leaves in winter
 ped lagane ke baad prarambh ke do teen saal tak sabhi pedo ko sundar or sudrudh banane ke liye kataai, chhantai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The stem should be cleaned to a height of about two to three feet from the ground
 tane ke upree bhaag main teen yaa chaar majboot bhinn bhinn dishaao main badhati hui shakhaon ko chun lenaa chahie or keval unako hi badhane dena chahie
 Other branches should be cut off near the stem
 jaise jaise ped badhate jaaen, unke thale badhaate janaa chahie
 Every year, plots should be planted and fertilized in them
 yah kaary oktober tathaa november ke maheene main karnaa acha rahata he
 Cleanliness of the garden should always be taken care of junglee ghaas phoos saaf karte rahanaa chahie
 Proper care should be taken for proper irrigation, especially after summer and after planting
 kisi bhi beemaari athwa keedon ke lagate hi unako rokane ke liye uchit dawa kaa chhidkaav karnaa chahie

 Sutlej is a Sadanira river flowing in northern India
 iskaa puranic naam shatadru he
 The length of which is the highest among the five rivers flowing in Punjab
 yah pakistan main hokar bahati he
 At an altitude of 4,600 meters above sea level in southwestern Tibet, it originates from the demon Tal near Mansarovar, where it is locally called Logchen Khambav
 udgam sthal se himachal pradesh main pravesh karne se pehle yah pashchim kii ore mudakar kailash parvat ke dhaal ke paas bahati he
 From here, this river flows through deep ravines and the gradual elevation of the mountain ranges converges into plinths in the Sutlej valley
 himachal pradesh ke pahaado se apana rasta tay karaate huye yah nadi punjab ke nangal main pravesh karti he
 a dam is built on the Sutlej in Bhakra, Himachal Pradesh, a few kilometers above Nangal
 baandh ke peeche ek vishaal jalashay kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he, jo govind sagar jalashay kehalaata he
 The Bhakra Nangal Project produces hydroelectric power, which is supplied to Punjab and adjoining states
 punjab main pravesh ke baad yah nadi dakshin-purv ke ropar jile main shivalik pahadiyon ke bich bahati he
 In Ropar itself it descends from the mountain into the plain, from here it turns sharply towards the west and flows in the middle of Punjab, where it divides the Best Doab and Malwa
 harike main beas nadi sutluj main milti he, jahaan se yah dakshin-pashchim kii ore mudakar bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa rekha nirdhaarit karti he
 It then flows west of Fazilka in Pakistan for some distance leaving India
 bahawalpur ke nikat pashchim kii ore yah chanaab nadi se milti he
 The two rivers together form the Panchanad
 rugveda ke nadisukt main ise shutudri kaha gaya he
 In the Vedic period, Saraswati river was found only in 'shutudri'
 parvarti sahitya main iskaa prachlit naam 'shatadru yaa shatadru' he
 Valmiki Ramayana describes Bharata crossing Shatadru while coming from Kekay to Ayodhya
 mahabharat main punjab kii anya nadiyon ke saath hi shatadru kaa bhi ullekh he
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, it is mentioned along with Chandrabhaga and Marudavriddha etc
 - 'sushoma Shatadrushchandra Bharamadruvradha Vitasta' vishnu puraana main shatadru ko himavan parvat se nissruth kaha gaya he- 'shatadruchandrabhagadya himavatpadanirgtah'
 In fact, the source of Sutlej is a lake called Ravanahanad which is west of Mansarovar
 vartmaan samay main sutluj 'bias' main milti he
 But Reberti, author of 'the Mihran of Sindh and Its Trivities', holds that' Sutlej, before 1790 AD, was not found in Bias
 is varsh bias or satluj donon ke maarg badal gaye or ve sannikat aakar mil gai
 'shatadru' is a variation of the Vedic Shutudri and can be interpreted as a river with hundred streams
 jisase isaki anek upanadiyon kaa astitv ingit hota he
 Greek writers have called Sutlej a Hezidrus
 kintu inke granthon main is nadi kaa ullekh bahut kam aayaa he
 Because Alakshendra's forces had withdrawn from the Beas river and they had little knowledge of the country east of Beas
 punjab kii samruddhi ke peeche sutluj kaa bhi yogadan he
 The dam built at Bhakra on Sutlej not only supplies electricity, but it also saves a large part of the state from flooding
