 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be obeyed by law is called a contract
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Promotion, agreement or maintenance of Kaul has been given great importance in the whole world and especially in India
 bhartiya itihaas main vachanpaalan ke liye putr ko vanvaas or swayan mrityu kaa varan karanevaale dasharath kii gaatha lokprasiddh he
 The medieval history of Rajasthan is steeped in this bright tradition
 parantu is vachanpaalan kaa aadhyatmik or naitik mulya rahaa he, iske peeche kanoon kaa haath nahin tha or na isko koi vaidhanik manyata praapt thi
 But gradually, the experience of pledging in business relations and the need to give legal recognition to it, along with the decline of values and morals, the society has experienced this and that is why the pledge in moral and spiritual terms has become secondary, following the statutory recognized business utterances Importance gained prominence
 vyavsaayik or kanoonee drushti se is sambandh main rome kaa kanoonee itihaas rochak he
 The oldest form of contract was there
 apane mul rup main yah udhaar vastuvikray se sambandhit tha
 Gradually it started being used for loans too
 isaki katipay aupchaariktaayen thim jinke bina kii purnataa praapt nahin hoti thi
 In India also, there are references in Narada and Jupiter's texts about the relationship of commodity, debt, partnership and success
 kintu vartmaan sanvida kaa swaroop usase bhinn he, yadhyapi uske vikaas kii kadi unase bhi jodi ja sakati he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida he
 In ancient times, this legal recognition was not a special force but the emphasis was that if any formality was reduced from its formalities then the contract would not be completed
 yadhyapi apane vibhinn roopon main sanvida kaa prachlan samaaj ke vyavsaayik sambandhon main tha parantu "sanvida" shabd kaa anveshan bahut baad main hua
 The word contract is very broad
 sanvida ke hi ang vikray, rin, bandhak, nikshep, saajhedaari, abhikartrutv, vivaah aadi bhi hai
 But in its present form the contract has assumed new legal meaning
 bharatvarsh main iskaa adhinium san 1872 i
 main bana or sanvidaaon kaa niyaman usee bhartiya sanvida adhinium dwaara hota he
 Therefore, Indian courts are now bound to follow this written law in the case of contract
 vyavasthaaon kii vyakhya ke liye unhen isi adhinium kaa adhyayan karke upyukt arth or mantavya nikaalnaa chahie
 The Indian Contract Act is based on the British Contract Act, but the British Contract Act can be availed only if either the Indian Contract Act is silent on a question or its system is unclear and British law is not inconsistent with the Indian condition and social status
 apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ek vidhik vachan yaa kanoon dwaara pravartaneey qaraar he
 It has two essential elements - qaraar or Quality of making it effective by law
 jab kam se kam do vyakti kisi kaary ke karne athwa usase virat rahane ke sambandh main ekamat hote hai to use qaraar kaha jaataa he
 The agreement requires at least two parties
 yadi "a" na "ba" se prastaav kiya ki "ba" "a" kaa ek chitra bana de to vah "ba" ko is kaary hetu paanch sau rupe degaa
 This is proposed by "A"
 yadi "ba" yah sweekaar kar le ki paanch saura rupe main vah "a" ke liye uskaa chitra bana degaa to yah ek aisa qaraar hua jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey he or use prabhavakaari banaaya ja saktaa he
 That is, a person cannot make an agreement alone, it is necessary for the agreement to have the mental unity of the common side on the matters related to the agreement
 taatpary yah he ki qaraar sambandhi prayek baat ke sambandh main ubhay paksh uskaa ek hi arth samajhen
 It should not happen that one side understands one meaning and the other side understands the other meaning
 "a" ke paas do motorcarein hai, ek ford or duusari shevarlyt
 He wants to sell his Ford car for five thousand
 usne apni us car ko bechney kaa prastaav "ba" se kiya
 But "B", considering it a "chevrolet" car, agreed to buy it
 yah qaraar nahin hoga kyonki "a" or "ba" main motorcar ke sambandh main maansik ekaatmakataa nahin hui
 "A" from Motorcar understood Ford Motorcar and "B" as Chevrolet Car
 uparyukt kathan se spasht he ki prastaav hi sweekruti ke uparant qaraar banataa he
 There are different types of proposals but generally they are classified into five categories: 1
 vishisht prastaav, jab koi prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, tab use vishisht prastaav kehete hai
 Since the offer is made to a certain person or persons, the person accepting it will be called the acceptor
 isamen sweekruti kii soochna swikarta dwaara prastaavak ko dena aavashyak he
 2
 a general proposal is a proposal that is not made by a certain person or persons, but a person of the world can accept it
 isi liye vishisht prastaav kii bhanti isamen sweekruti kii soochna kaa prastaavak ko diya janaa anivaary nahin hota
 Approval of this proposal is considered to be the only thing that is revealed and desired in the proposal
 3
 spasht prastaav ve prastaav he jo maukhik yaa likhit rup main hri parantu spashtat: hri kiye jaaen
 4
 Indicative proposals These proposals are made not by words but by actions
 yatriyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko tikat ke badale le jane kaa prastaav, railgadee ko stesan par aana hi he
 It is also an example of a general proposition because its acceptor is not predetermined
 5
 anwarat prastaav is prastaav main nishchit dar se 5000 man gehun kii aapurti kaa prastaav
 Even after acceptance of this proposal, one party cannot be compelled to buy whole wheat immediately or the other party will sell it
 prastaav kii hi bhanti or uske anuroop sweekruti kii koi vishesh vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali dwaara sweekruti na ho to prastaavak ko usee pranali dwaara sweekruti dene par bal dena chahie
 But where there is no mention of any system or specific method of acceptance, acceptance can be done by any reasonable, relevant and appropriate system
 sweekruti bhi spasht arthath shabdon dwaara ho sakati he athwa sankethik rup main kaary dwaara
 The acceptance of the company's proposal by work is the seating of the passenger on the train going to the destination with the ticket
 keval maansik sweekruti maatr sweekruti nahin samajhi ja sakati
 Its expression in words or by action is also necessary
 prastaav main nirdisht kaaryon kaa karnaa bhi katipay prastaavon kii sweekruti maani jaati he
 But it is necessary that the acceptor knows the conditions of the proposer before doing this work
 yadi swikarta prastaav kii bina jaankaree ke hi vah kaary karata he jo prastaav main nirdisht he, to vah prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa
 a person Goridutt sent his bookkeeper Lalman to search for his nephew
 lalman ke jane ke uparant gauridatt ne apane bhattije ko khoj laanevaale ke liye 501 rupe puraskaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 Lalman discovered the nephew of Munim Gauridutt and demanded the award
 nirnay yah hua ki chunki lalman ko ladke kii khoj ke purv puraskaar kii shart kii soochna nahin thi, na puraskaar prapti kii baat hi gyaat thi, at: khoe hue ladke ko khoj laane kaa lalman kaa kaary gauridatt ke prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa Accepting the profit arising from the proposal is also considered to be acceptance of the offer in appropriate conditions
 varanasi se prayag kii bas main baithkar janaa hi bas maalik ke prastaav kii sweekruti he or swikarta bas kaa kiraaya dene ko baadhya he
 Approval should be in the case of the proposal being upheld
 yadi prastaav nishprabhav ho chukaa he yaa prastaavak dwaara khandit kiya yaa waapas liya ja chukaa he to sweekruti bhi nirarthak or prabhaavaheen hogi
 The information of the proposer is required to be accepted by the acceptor and the acceptance of the offer to the proposer
 prastaav kii soochna jab us vyakti ko praapt ho jaae jiske prati prastaav kiya jaataa he tab prastaav kaa sanvahan yaa sanchaar purna samajha he
 "A" sent the letter "B" in his watch 150) by offering to sell "B"
 jyonhi "k" kaa patr "kha" ko praapt hoga, "k" ke prastaav kaa sanvahan purna ho jayega
 Separation is separate for acceptance
 jab swikarta apni sweekruti prastaavak ke paas is prakaar preshit kar de ki uskaa waapas lenaa swikarta ke vash main na rahe, to prastaavak ke viruddh sweekruti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, convection of your acceptance by "B" will be deemed complete but not against the acceptor
 swikarta ke viruddh sweekruti ke viruddh sweekruti kaa sanvahan tab purna hoga jab swikti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, the acceptance of "B" by the letter "B" will be banned against the proposer named "A" but not against the acceptor "B"
 "kha" ke viruddh sanvahan kii purnataa tab hogi jab uski sweekruti kaa patr "k" ko praapt ho jaae
 When the proposer and the acceptor are present in front of each other, there is no complication in the convection, but when both are in two places, the medium of convection is by post or letter
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki prastaav kaa patr prastaavak dwaara chode jate hi vah purna nahin hota varan swikarta ke paas pahunchan par hi purna hota he
 This also leads to the conclusion that there is no complication in convection if the offeror and the acceptor are present before each other, but until the acceptor leaves their acceptance letter in the post because then the withdrawal of acceptance is outside the confessor's authority
 goes
 swikarta dwaara sweekrutipatr dak main chhodte har prastaav prastaavak ke viruddh purna ho jaataa he
 It has been said above that acceptance is complete against the acceptor when the proposer receives it
 prastaavak ko praapt hone ke purv swikarta apni sweekrutipatr daakkhaane main chode jate ho swikarta ke viruddh bhi purna ho jaataa he
 Acceptance is also effective if it arrives late or gets lost on the way, as it is believed that inadvertence or mistake of the Department of Posts does not justify any effect on the parties to the contract
 parantu yadi sanvahan ke liye patr dak main na daalkar postman ko de diya jaae to yah paryaapt sanvahan nahin kyonki prayek vyakti ke patr ko lekar dak main chhodana postman ke kartavyon main sammilit nahin he
 According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, all such agreements are considered contracts which qaraar karne yogya pakshon kii Be done with independent consent, jinka pratifal or uddeshy vaid ho or jo The Act should not have been declared by the said Act
 isi dhara main yah bhi spasht kar diya gaya he ki uparyukt paribhaasha kaa prabhaav aise kisi kanoon par nahin padegaa, By which a contract must be written, or with the testimony of registered witnesses
 aise sabhi vyakti sanvida karne yogya maane jate hai jo vyask hon, swasth mastishkvaale hon or kisi kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy na tehraae gaye hon
 As a result avyask, Persons with deformed minds or those who are frantic, stupid and drunk, or aise vyakti jo kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy tehraae gaye hon, yatha videshi shatru, videshi samrat athwa unke pratinidhi, desh ke shatru, apradhi aadi sanvida nahin kar sakate
 a non-practicing person cannot decide his own profit and loss with independent intelligence
 at: vah sanvida karne yogya nahin mana gaya he
 If the deformity is temporary in the person with deformed heart, or if the deformity is temporary in the person with brain, the brain is deformed and sometimes healthy, then such a person is not in the deformal but is a worthy party to the contract in the time of recovery of the brain
 1 The right of the offender to contract at the time of imprisonment is suspended but for the purpose of imprisonment or forgiveness Shchat her ability to contract is retrieving
 diwalia ghoshit vyakti bhi sanvida karne kii yogyata se vanchit mana jaataa he
 a key requirement of the contract is to have independent consent of the parties to the contract
 yadi sahmati swatantra nahin he to sanvida usase prabhavit hogi
 Consent is considered independent when it 1
 balpravartan yaa traas, 2
 unwanted effects, 3
 chhalkapat, 4
 Has not been influenced or received by a misleading statement, or fallacy
 balpravartan yaa traas kii paribhaasha bhartiya sanvida adhinium kii dhara main di gai he
 According to him, there are four forms of force or tragedy: bhartiya dand vidhaan dwaara varjit or dandaneey kaary karnaa yaa Threatening to do, whether or not the place where this act is done or not, kisi bhi vyakti kii sampatti avaidh rup se roak rakhana; athwa Threatening to stop
 is balpravartan yaa traas kaa uddeshy kisi vyakti ko sanvida kaa paksh bananaa hi hona chahie
 The definition of undue influence is given in Section 16 of the Contracts Act
 uske anusaar vah sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prerit kahi jaati he jiske pakshon ke sambandh aise hon ki ek paksh duusare paksh kii ichha se apni us vishisht sthiti kaa prayog kare
 The relationship between parents and children, guardians and parents, lawyers and clients, doctors and patients, gurus and disciples, etc
 are similar in that the first party inspires the other's wishes because of their specific relationship
 avaanchit prabhaav siddh karne ke liye yah bhi siddh karnaa aavashyak he ki vastut: vishisht sthitiwale paksh ke duusare paksh par apni vishesh sthiti kaa prayog apane anuchit laabh ke liye kiya
 If this is not proved, a contract will not be deemed to be affected or abandoned by undue influence only because of the specific situation
 yah sanvida adhinium kii dhara 17 main varnit he
 According to him, the following actions shall be called fraud in order to induce the other party or his agent to cheat or trick or join the contract by any party of the contract or by his agent or by his agent: k) kisi asaty baat ko, jisaki satyata main use vishwaas na ho, tathy batalaana, B) to hide a fact which he does not know or believe; ga) aisa vachan dena jise puraa karne kii ichha na ho; D) to do or be dissuaded from an act which the law specifically declares as treachery; ng) dhokhaa dene laayak anya kaary karnaa
 In relation to the agreement, it has been said that there is a need to have a mental consensus between the parties
 bhranti isi se sambandhit dosha he
 In this, one side understands an object or thing and the other side understands the other thing or thing
 falswaroop upree dhang se dekhne main to sanvida kaa nirmaan prathit hota he parantu bhranti ke kaaran vastut: koi sanvida hoti nahin he
 There are many types of these misconceptions
 vishaysaamagree ke sambandh main bhranti kaa udhaaharan purvaprasang main shevarlyt or ford motor kaaron ke dwaara diya gaya he
 Similarly, there is confusion in the identity of the parties to the contract
 "k" ne jise "kha" samajhakar sanvida kii yadi vah vastut: "kha" nahin varan "ga" tha to yah paksh kii pahchaan kii bhranti he
 The nature or meaning of the contract can also be confused
 agar kisi baad kaa ek paksh baad main avasar lene kaa aavedan patr bataakar kisi sandhipatr par duusare paksh kaa hastakshar kara letaa he to duusare paksh ko sanvida ke rup yaa prakruti ke vishay main bhranti hoti he
 In such a case, the signature maker's mind is not with his signature
 prasanvida ke liye pratifal ek aavashyak tatv he
 There can be no covenant without consideration; And even if it is, it is disarmed or illegal
 pratifal bhi vaid hona chahie
 For example "A", "B" are charged Rs 5000 for killing "S"
 And "B" pledge to kill
 yahan yah sanvida ni:satv he kyonki iskaa pratifal hatya kanoon dwaara varjit he
 Thus the following types of returns are invalid - 1
 aise pratifal jo kanoon varjit hai
 If any consideration is explicitly or symbolically forbidden by law, then the covenant made on the basis of it is void
 yah uparyukt udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega
 2
 If there is any consideration which disrupts or nullifies any arrangement of an act, then that consideration shall be deemed to be invalid
 3
 jo pratifal kapatpurna hote hai, ve avaidh samajhe jate hai
 4
 The reward by which a person's body or property is damaged is illegal
 udhaaharan ke liye a ek samachaarpatr ke sampadak ko paanch sau rupaya dene kaa vachan detaa he yadi sampadak ba ke sambandh main apmanjanak vivaran chaape
 The reward here is illegal because it hurts B's reputation
 5
 aise pratifal jo aniatik hote hai, avaidh hai
 6
 Returns against public policy are illegal, such as trading with the enemy
 lokseva ko haani pahunchaane kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, dandaneey aparaadhon se sambandhit mukademon kaa galaa ghotanevaali sanvida ni:satv hoti he
 Contracts tending to misuse statutory action, such a contract is against morality, or a trade contract or someone who is against morality, or a trade contract or a contract to prevent an individual from marrying, etc
 also against public policy And are non-existent
 uddeshy evam pratifal main se ek kaa bhi avaidh hona sanvida ko ni:satv kar detaa he
 If the purpose of the contract is partially invalid, the contract becomes void even if its illegal share can be separated from the valid part
 yadi pratifal yaa uddeshy kaa avaidh ansh vaid ansh se alag kiya ja sake to vaid ansh pravartaneey hoga or avaidh ansh ni:satv hoga
 Eg "B" pledged to give "A" 2000 rupees by a covenant, out of which Rs 1500 was an old loan and Rs 500 was a loss in gambling
 isamen vaid bhaag kaa avaidh bhaag se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he; atev yah pratigyaptr 1500 rupye ke liye maanya hoga kintu 500) ke liye ni:satv hoga

 If the cardiac arrest remains untreated for more than five minutes, there is a possibility of brain attack
 bachane or snaivik laabh ke sabase achche maukey ke liye tatkaal or nirnaayak ilaaj aavashyak he
 Complete heart attack is a medical emergency, in some cases it can potentially improve if treated prematurely
 jab apratyaashit purnahridarodh se maut ho jaati he to ise saden cardiek deth kaha jaataa he
 Treatment of cardiac arrest is cardiopulmonary regeneration by which circulatory support is provided, followed by defibrillation if a vibratory rhythm is present
 seepiaar or anya naidanik upayon ke baad agar kampan dene yogya lay vidyaman nahin he to maut anivaary he
 Complete cardiac arrest is classified into "vibrable" versus "non-vibrable" based on the ECG rhythm
 do kampan yogya lay hai nilay tantuvikson or spandan rahit ventricular texcardia jabaki do gaiyr-kampan yogya lay hai hrid-aprakunchan or spandan rahit vidyut gatividhi
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki gaiyr-layaatmakataa kaa koi khaas varg gaiyr-tantuvikson ke upyog se ilaaj yogya he yaa nahin
 Complete heart attack is a sudden blockage in the pump action inside the heart
 Early intervention can usually reverse cardiac arrest, but without such intervention it always results in death
 kuch maamalon main, yah kisi gambhir beemaari kaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 However, due to insufficient brain dilation the patient will remain unconscious and will stop breathing
 The main diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of cardiac arrest is the lack of circulation, but there are several ways to determine it
 coronary hriday rog, aakasmik purnahridarodh kaa pramukh kaaran he
 Many other cardiac and non-heart conditions also increase the risk
 lagbhag 60-70% kii SCD coronary hriday rog se sambandhit he
 Among adults, ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of cardiac arrest, with 30% of people showing signs of recent myocardial infarction
 kai anya cardiyak asaamanyataayen SCD ke jokhim ko badha sakati hai jisamen shaamil he: hriday-peshi rog, hriday lay vikaar, ucch raktchaap se grast hriday rog, raktasanlai hridpaat
 In a group of military recruits aged 18–35, cardiac anomalies contributed 51% to SCD cases, while the cause remained unknown in 35% of cases
 The underlying pathology includes: coronary artery abnormalities, myocarditis, and hypertropic cardiovascular disease
 Hemorrhagic heart failure increases the risk of SCD by 5 times
 35% maamalon main SCD dil kii samasyaon se sambandhit nahin he
 The most common non-cardiac causes are: stroke, non-stroke related bleeding, overdose, relapse and pulmonary embolism
 SCD ke jokhim ke kaarak vahi hai jo coronary hriday rog main dekhe jate hai jisame shaamil he: dhumrapaan, shaareerik vyaayaam kii kami, motopa, madhumeh or parivaar kaa itihaas
 h and t is cardiac arrest used to cause possible recall of heart causes
 purnahridarodh, naidanik mrityu kaa paryaay he
 The clinical diagnosis of a cardiac arrest is usually made with the absence of pulsation
 kai maamalon main purnahridarodh kaa nidaan karne ke liye manya spandan ek swarna maanak he, lekin spandan kii kami ho saktaa he anya sthitiyon ke kaaran ho, yaa bachaane vaale ke ore se kii gayi sirf ek truti ho
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki bachaav karne vaale apaat sthiti main manya naadee kii jaanch main aksar galati karte hai, chaahe ve swasthya peshewar hon yaa avijna jan
 Due to inaccuracy in this method of diagnosis, bodies such as the European Resuscitation Council have repeatedly emphasized its importance
 rissiteshan council ne iarsi or american heart association kii siforeeshon ke anuroop yah suzav diya he ki takanic kaa istemaal keval swasthya peshewaron dwaara kiya janaa chahie jinke paas vishesh visheshgyata or prashikshan he or iske baavjood ise anya sanketakon jaise asann shwasan ke saath sangyojan main dekha janaa chahie
 Various other methods have been proposed to detect circulation
 rissiteshan par antarrashtriya liesson kamity 2000 ke dishanirdesh ke anuroop siforeeshon main bachaav karne waalon ko "parisancharan ke sanket" dekhne ke liye kaha gaya, lekin vishesh rup se spandan nahin

 haalanki, in sabooton ke maddenzar ki ye disha nirdesh aprabhavi rahe hai, ILCOR kii vartmaan sifarish yah he ki purnahridarodh kaa nidaan un sabhi hataahaton main kiya janaa chahie jo behosh hai or saamaanya shwaas nahin le rahe hai
 Due to the incongruity of a positive outcome after a heart attack, attempts have been made to find an effective strategy to prevent complete heart attack
 jahaan purnahridarodh kaa mukhya kaaran he sthanik-araktata hriday rog hai, vahaan sampoorn aahaar ko badhaava dena, vyaayaam or dhumrapaan rokna kaaphi kargar he
 In people at risk of heart disease, blood pressure control, cholesterol lowering and other medical interventions are taken
 chikitsa kii bhashaa main, purnahridarodh ko ek "code" yaa ek "krash" ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 It usually refers to "code Blue" on the hospital emergency code
 jivan sanket maapan main ek naatakeey giravat ko "koding" yaa "craishing" ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he, yadhyapi koding kaa aamtaur par tab istemaal kiya jaataa he jab yah purnahridarodh main falit hota he, jabaki craishing nahin ho saktaa he
 Treatment for complete heart attack is sometimes called "calling a code"
 vyapak anusandhan se pataa chalaa he ki purnahridarodh hone se pehle general ward main rogi aksar kai ghante yaa dinon tak bigadate rahete hai
 This has been attributed to the lack of knowledge and skills in the staff of that ward, particularly the failure to measure breathing rate, which is often a major indicator of condition deterioration and often changes 48 hours before complete heart attack
 is
 iske jawaab main, kai aspataalon ne ab ward aadhaarit karmchaariyon ke liye prashikshan main vruddhi kii he
 Several "early warning" systems now exist that measure the amount of risk that patients have and are based on their life signs and thus provide guidance to staff
 iske atirikt, visheshgy staff ko adhik prabhavi dhang se upyog kiya jaataa he taaki pehle se hi ward str par kiya ja rahaa kaam achche se ho

 Please note that standalone icds do not have any pacemaker operations, but they can be combined with pacemakers and the modern version has advanced features such as non-tachycardia intervals as well as synchronized cardiac enlargement
 a recent study by Birney and others at the Ottawa University Heart Institute showed that icds are under-utilized in both Canada and the United States
 simpasan dwaara ek sampadakeey main iske liye aarthik, bhugolic, saamaajik or raajnneetik kaarnon kii padtaal kii gai he
 Patients who are most likely to benefit from an ICD are those with severe ischemic myocardial infarction as demonstrated by the MADIT-II trial
 aakasmik purnahridarodh ko punerjeevan ke prayaason dwaara upachaarit kiya jaataa he
 This is usually done on the basis of basic life support / advanced cardiac life support, pediatric advanced life support or neonatal resuscitation program guidelines
 seepiaar, purnahridarodh ke prabandhan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he
 It should be started as soon as possible and we should disrupt life as much as possible
 The component of CPR that potentially makes the most difference is chest compression
 shwaas sambandhi antargyaan ko, purnahridarodh maamalon main bachaav daron main sudhaar karte nahin paaya gaya
 a 2009 study found that supported ventilation can worsen results when an oral airway with passive oxygen supply is placed
 aspataal-purv paryaavaran main antargyaan ko jivit rahane kii aashaa ko kam karte paaya gaya he
 When edited correctly, bystander CPR has been found to be life-saving; Less than 30% of out-of-hospital edema was performed
 chikitsak samudaay purnahridarodh ke kaarnon ko kampan yogya or gaiyr-kampan yogya kaarnon ke rup main vargeekrut karata he - jo nilay sambandhi tantuvikson kii maujuudagi yaa uske abhaav par aadhaarit hota he yaa spandan rahit nilay sambandhi kshiprahridayata par
 kampan yogya lay ko seepiaar or tantuvikamphharan dwaara upachaarit kiya jaataa he
 Most complete myocardial infarction occurs outside the hospital with a rhythm of myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrosis initially
 isliye rogi sambhavit rup se tantuvikamphharan ke prati pratikraya karata he or yah hastkshep kaa centre he
 In addition, the use of public access fibrolysis is increasing
 iske tahat saarvajanik sthanon par swachaalit tantuvikampaharnak lagaaya jaataa he or inhen kaise istemaal kiya jaye iske liye karmchaariyon ko prashikshan diya jaataa he
 The arrival of emergency services does not take place before this fibrolysis allows deflation and has been shown to lead to increased chances of survival
 kuch tantuvikampaharnak seepiaar compresssont kii gunvattta par raay pradaan karte hai or agyani bachaav karmi ko rogi ke seene ko rakt ke sancharan ko shuru karne ke liye paryaapt dabaane ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 In addition, it has been shown that those in remote areas who have complete heart failure have worse outcomes after complete heart failure: these areas often have first responders, where community members are trained in resuscitation and given a fibroblast Goes are called for emergency medical services for a casual patient in their local area
 haalanki, aushadhi prayog ko disha nirdeshon main shaamil kiya gaya he, lekin dekha gaya he ki purnahridarodh ke baad ye aspataal mukti ke maamle main sudhaar nahin dikhaate hai
 This includes the use of epinephrine, atropine and amiodarone
 Studies, however, point out the ineffectiveness of these drugs in the context of outbreaks outside the hospital
 haalanki apane 2010 ke disha nirdesh main, american heart association ne sirf atropine ko chihnit kiya or sanket diya ki "uplabdh saboot sanket dete hai ki piie yaa hrid-aprakunchan ke dauraan atropine ke niyamit prayog se chikitsiya laabh hota he
 " purnahridarodh ke baad chetana kii vaapasi ke bina rogi ke sahaj rakt parisancharan kii vaapasi ke saath use saamaanya karne se parinaamon main sudhaar hota he
 This process is medically called hypothermia
 europe main kiye gaye pratham adhyayan main un logon par dhyaan diya gaya jinhen hryday rodh ke 5-15 minute baad punerjeevit kiya gaya
 Patients participating in this study experienced a spontaneous return of circulation after an average of 105 minutes
 rogiyon ko iske baad 24 ghante kii avadhi ke dauraan saamaanya kiya gaya, jahaan lakshyit taapmaana 32–34 °se
 tha
 Of the 137 patients in the hypothermia group, 55% experienced favorable results, compared with only 39% of the group receiving standard care after revival
 The hypothermia group had a 14% lower mortality rate, meaning that one out of every 7 patients treated had their lives saved
 vishesh rup se, donon samoohon ke bich jatiltaayen kaaphi alag nahin thi
 This figure was supported by a similar study that was conducted in Australia at the same time
 is adhyayan main purnahridarodh ke baad hypothermia se ilaaj kiye gaye 49% rogiyon ne achche parinaam anubhav kiye, jisaki tulana main maanak dekhbhaal waalon ke 26% ne aisa anubhav kiya
 a sporadic report of regeneration by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices has been published in recent years
 kai sanghathan "bachaav ke charan" ke vichaar ko badhaava dete hai, link he: If one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed, the chances of survival are significantly reduced
 in protocol ko aksar ek code blue se shuru kiya jaataa he, jo aamtaur par aane vaale yaa asann purnahridarodh athwa shwasan avrodh kaa sanket detaa he, haalanki vyavhaar main, code blue ko aksar kam ghaatak mana jaataa he jiske liye kisi chikitsak ke dekharekh kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In case of complete heart attack outside the hospital, the minimum survival rate is seen, whereas inside the hospital, the rate of complete heart attack is slightly higher
 The main determining factor is the initial documented rhythm
 nilay sambandhi tantuvikson yaa spandan rahit nilay sambandhi kshiprahridayata main spandan rahit vidyutiya gatividhi yaa assestole se peedit logon kii tulana main bachane kii 10-15 guna gunjaaish hoti he
 As mortality rates are higher in the case of OHCA, programs have been developed to improve survival rates
 haalanki ventricular tantuvikson ke maamle main mrityu dar adhik he, tantuvikampaharnak ke saath kiye gaye twarit hastkshep se bachaav dar main sudhaar aata he
 The chances of survival are mostly related to the cause of complete cardiac arrest
 vishesh rup se, jo marij hypothermia se peedit rahe hai uname jivit rahane kii dar adhik he, sambhawatah isliye kyonki thand kii vajah se, pramukh angon par utak main oxigen kii kami kaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 Survival rate after complete heart attack due to the venom is mainly dependent on identifying the toxin and administering an appropriate treatment
 ek marij jise bain coronary dhamni main rakt kaa thakka jam jane ke kaaran rodhgalan kaa saamana karnaa padataa he uname bachane kaa avasar kam hota he
 a study of survival rates in the case of outbreaks outside the hospital found that 14
6% of those who received resuscitation treatment by ambulance staff survived with hospital admission
 Of these, 59% died during admission, half of them within the first 24 hours, while 46% survived until discharged from the hospital
 This gives us an overall survival rate of 6
8% after cardiac arrest
 inamen se 89% main saamaanya mastishk kriya thi yaa halki snaivik viklaangata thi, 8
5% main madhyam vikaar tha or 2% gambhir neurological viklaangata se grasit the

 atharahavin sadi ke aate-aate nagar main badhati hui vyapaarik samruddhi ke kaaran vyapaaree, samant va prashasnic varg bahut dhan sampann ho gaya
 As a result, by the beginning of the 19th century, these people started constructing big havelis, bari temples etc
 for housing here
 jaisalmer durg sthapaty kala kii drushti se ucchkoti kii vishuddh sthaneey durg rachana he
 This fort is situated on a 250 feet triangular foot

 Rawal Jaisal established his independent capital
 sthaneey sroton ke anusaar is durg kaa nirmaan 1156 i

 But studies of contemporary evidence show that its construction started around 1178 AD
 5 varsh ke alp nirmaan kaary ke uparaant rawal jaisal kii mrityu ho gayi, iske dwaara prarambh karaae gaye nimarn kaary ko uske uttaradhikari shalivahan dwaara jari rakhkar durg ko moort rup diya gaya
 There is no archival evidence of works done by Rawal Jaisal and Shalivahana

 There are mainly three havelis in the havelis

 It seems as if passing through the inner and outer layers of any mansion, as if self-evidence is in sight, someone has peeped out of the window of the eyes wearing a pleasant yellow muffle or orbiting the sunshine of the sunshine Applying the eyelid may have killed the eyelids or have developed pudding in the eyes and become yellow mountains in dry sonic sandal sand

 The viewer's eyes are amazed at the unique craftsmanship of the buildings
 mughal satta ke paraabhav ke uparaant sindh, gujarat va malwa kii ore se kai hindu va muslim kalakaar yahan aakar basane lage tathaa unhone in haweliyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 But if these artisans had come from Gujarat and Malwa, they would have got some original examples of their art, which are not available
 parantu jaisalmer rajya se lage sindh praant main sthaneey kala ke dheron udhaaharan praapt hote hai, jo ki sindh nadi ko paar karte hue baluchistan kii seemaa tak praapt hote hai
 Therefore, it is possible that the craftsmen must have come from Sindh province towards Jaisalmer for the carving done here
 sambhawatah lakdi ke kaam ke liye kalakaar malwa va gujarat se aae honge, kyonki ye donon hi praant is kaary hetu prasiddh hai
 These havelis with sixty-six vents are undoubtedly the best example of art
 ye kul milakar paanch hai, jo ki ek-duusare se satee hui hai
 These havelis are built on a platform 8-10 feet high above the ground and have six floors above the ground and there are 7 floors in total with one floor inside the ground

 The half-and-half of the mansion was assigned to both artisans with the condition that the two would not mimic the artwork of each other, as well as the repetition of an artwork
 is baat kaa donon ne paalan karte hue iskaa nirmaan purna kiya
 Today, when we look at this mansion from a distance, this entire artwork looks the same, but if we look carefully, the artisans on both sides from the center center of the mansion have subtle frescoes, the immortal work of two craftsmen

 With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the establishment of communist rule in Russia, which gave the slogan of the best-ever revolution in the world and talked about the end of capitalism, since the birth of capitalist nations considered it their enemy, thus Soviet Union from the beginning
 Fallen from many enemies, Tanushree's harsh and fierce appearance was seen in Stalin's rule, under which the opponents of communism were suppressed and Nag Rick curbed freedom, the movement of people curbed the freedom of expression of newspapers and writers
 In this way, the system of governance of the Soviet Union as the ruler who enjoyed democracy, covered the spirit of the people and not just communist
 At the time of the establishment of the rule, it was said that the dictatorship of the proletariat would be established, but on a practical level, the dictatorship position on the proletariat
 Husband had the Soviet Union established the dictatorship of the party and those in government lentils and government There was no difference between the party and the system of governance
 It started losing public support
 The rigid system established during the rule of Stalin began to reveal the weaknesses of communist rule
 In fact in Eastern European countries where communist rule was present, the people were dissatisfied with their political economic structure and When opposition to the harshness of communist rule in the Soviet Union started increasing, so did the countries of Eastern Europe
 The mistrust of the communist regime began to increase and mass rebellion occurred
 The economic weakness of the Soviet Union also became the reason for its button
 It is a pathetic thing that the economic direction of the Soviet Union was weakened due to financial assistance to the weak countries and the performance of power in the Cold War
 Soviet funds started to be spent on the means of Cold War in place of developmental renovation of the structure
