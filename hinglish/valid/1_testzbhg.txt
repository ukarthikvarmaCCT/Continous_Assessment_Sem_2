 baudhon kaa sanskrit bhashaa main charitapradhan sahitya avdaan sahitya kehalaata he
 According to Amarkosh, "awadan" means - ancient charit, archaic circle
 "avdaan" se taatpary un pracheen kathaon se he jinke dwaara kisi vyakti kii gungarima tathaa shlaghneey charitra kaa parichay miltaa he
 Kalidasa has used the word "awadan" in this sense
 buddha sahitya main isi arth main "jataka" shabd bhi bahush: prachlit he, parantu avdaan jataka se katipay vishyon main bhinn he
 The "jatakas" are closely associated with the stories of Lord Buddha's previous birth in which Buddha is depicted as the protagonist in the previous birth
 "avdaan" main yah baat nahin pai jaati
 Contribution is often a characteristic character of a Buddhist

 Worshiping the Buddha in the stories of the first class creates miracles in the lives of human beings of different condition and they find enlightenment in the next life

 Divyavadaan has been particularly affected by the plot and poetic style of Avadanashaka

 Not a complete text, but some stories were translated into Chinese in the third century
 shunga vansh ke raja pushyamitra tak kaa ullekh yahan uplabdh hota he
 As a result, it would be appropriate to consider the creation of some portions of the second century, but the creation of the entire text is not later than the third century
 divyavdaan ke hi katipay avdaan maharaj priyadarshi ashok se sambhddha hone ke karna "ashokadaan" ke naam se pukaare jate hai
 The centerpiece of these stories, which are extremely important from the historical point of view, is Priyadarshi Ashoka, whose stories are intended to inform the personal household life, religious devotion and indomitable enthusiasm of propaganda
 is avdaan main do kathaayen apni rochakata ke kaaran vishesh mahatv rakhti hai
 The Karun Katha of Ashoka's son Kunal is very famous in the exciting stories of the Buddhist era
 buddha kaa rup dhaaran kar maar kaa acharya upagupt se shiksha ke liye prarthana karnaa bhi bada hi rochak aakhyaan he, naatak ke samaan hridayavarjak he

 lev trotsaki rus ke marxvaadi krantikari tathaa siddhantkaar, soviet rajaneta tathaa laal sena ke sansthaapak va pratham netaa the
 Trotsky commanded the Red Army, which was victorious in the fierce civil war that followed the Russian Revolution
 ek siddhantkaar ke rup main sthaayee kranti ke siddhanth ke jariye unhone marxvaadi vimarsh main yogadan kiya
 At the same time Trotsky also proposed a rule that the level of development of capitalism is not the same everywhere, which results in the simultaneous occurrence of two phases of social and historical development in backward countries
 beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak main marxvaadiyon ke bich chal rahe bahes-mubahise ke bich trotski kii is saidhantik uplabdhi ne rus jaise audyogic rup se pichde desh main kranti karne ke tark ko majbootee pradaan kii
 After Lenin's death, Trotsky opposed the principle of establishing socialism in a country promoted by Stalin, but he continued to fall alone in the struggle within the party
 pehle unhen party se nikaala gaya, or phir soviet rajya ke viruddh shadyantra karne ke aarope main desh-nikaala de diya gaya
 During the expulsion, Trotsky strongly criticized the Soviet Union being formed under Stalin, calling it a bureaucrat, autocratic and state capitalist state
 soviet sikret police se bachane ke liye sari duniya main bhatakate hue trotski ne 'permanent revolution', 'revolution bitrede' or teen khandon main 'da history of russian revolution' jaise clasik granth kii rachana kii
 In order to bring his dream of world revolution on earth, he also founded the Fourth Communist International, which did not get any special success
 nishkasana ke dauraan hi mexico main stallin ke ek agent ke haathon unhen jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Trotsky's followers have formed small communist parties in many countries of the world
 soviet style ke communism ke vikalp ke rup main unke vichaaron ko trotscvaad kii sangya mil chuki he
 Trotsky's real name was Lev Davidovich Bronstein
 bahut kam umr main hi ve marxvad ke prati aakarshith hue or bhumigat raajnneeti karte hue 'trotski' kaa gupt naam apana liya
 His life can be divided into three parts
 pehla hissaa vah he jab roosi marxvad ke ek swatantra hastakshar kii tarah ve krantikari andolan main bhaag lete hue pehle lenin ke najadik aaye or phir unka saath dene se inkaar kar diya
 The second part began from 1917 until 1923 when he pioneered the Soviet Revolution by joining shoulder to shoulder with Lenin
 iske baad unke jivan kaa teesraa daur shuru hua jab unhone kranti ke laabhon kii raksha karne ke liye stalinavaad ke kilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa
 Among Bolshevik leaders, Trotsky was the only one who was not seen as his follower despite being Lenin's main partner
 1903 main roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party jab bolshevikon or menshavikon main vibhajit hui, to trotski ne lenin kaa saath nahin diya
 In the beginning, he condemned Bolshevism by saying that it was not a proletariat but a formula of dictatorship over the proletariat
 us samay unhen shaq tha ki lenin robsprre jaise shadyantrkaari netaa hai jinke kaaran rus kaa samaajawaadee andolan pathbhrasht ho jayega
 At the time Trotsky was of the view that the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by commanding revolution in the hands of a disciplined party of professional revolutionaries doing secret political work
 ve ek adhik loktantric or khule charitra kii party banane ke paksh main the
 In 1905 he emerged as the Soviet leader of St
 Petersburg
 rus kii is pehali soviet ne 1905 kii kranti main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya tha, or trotski ise pramanik loktantr kaa namoona maanate the
 After the revolution failed, the Tsarshi arrested him and sent him to Siberia
 trotski vahaan se bhaag nikle or aglaa dashak unhone europe main bitaayaa
 During this period he remained with the Mensheviks organizationally
 1917 main ve rus laute tab farvari kranti ke kaaran zaarshahi kaa patan ho chukaa tha
 Now he joined the Bolsheviks because he felt that there was a lot of similarity between his and Lenin's ideas
 swayan lenin trotski kii raajnneetik or saidhantik kshamtaaon ke prashansak the
 Trotsky grew in stature in the Bolshevik party
 unhone videshi maamalon ke kamisar ke taur par germanon ke saath shanti- vaarta main bhaag liya
 Trotsky, as a military commissar, played a major role in the formation of the Red Army and led him brilliantly in the Civil War
 in safaltaaon ke kaaran trotski ko lenin ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon main ek ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Like Lenin, Trotsky had deep faith in the creative abilities of the Russian proletariat
 is vishwaas ke aadhaar main vishwa-poonjeewaad ke adhyayan se nikali unki ek vishesh tarah kii saidhantik samaj thi
 Trotsky was of the view that in order to get rid of its backwardness, no country needs to go through the steps that developed countries have gone through
 in deshon main pichhadepan ke saath-saath agadepan ke lakshan bhi ubharate hai
 Analyzing on the basis of this theory, Trotsky showed that much of Russia is backward and underdeveloped, but it has also been infiltrated by Western influences
 kai jagahon par aarthik utpaadan or sambandhon ke viksit taur-tareeke apanaae jane lage hai
 These moments of industrial development have created a considerable proletariat and a westernized intellectual elite in urban centers
 parinamswaroop raajnneetik pratirodh or sakriyata ke radical rup prachlit ho gayi hai
 Since industrialization is imposed from above, the local capitalist class is weak, but the proletariat is strong
 poonjeewaadi varg loktantric kranti karne se darataa he or apni aakshamata ke kaaran apana aitihaasik daayitv nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he, isliye yah jimmedaari sarvhaara varg ke kandhon par aa gayi he
 Taking the peasants under his leadership, the working class will have to move towards socialism by eradicating feudalism and all its remnants
 trotski ne apane siddhant ko sthaayee kranti qaraar diya
 In 1850, Marx used this position while addressing the General Council of the Communist League
 trotski ke mutabik praaq-poonjeewaadi maansikta vaale kisaan is krantikari prakriya main mazdooron kaa saath bahut dur tak nahin de paayenge
 Their interest will remain till they get the ownership of the land
 kisaanon ke saath banaaya gaya jo morcha kranti ke liye rasta saaf karata he, vahi samaajwaad kii rachana main baadhak sabit hoga
 Therefore, in one country, especially in Russia, the construction of socialism cannot be successful until the revolution takes place in other countries as well
 isliye rus kii kranti ko vishwa-kranti, khaas kar viksit deshon main kranti ke shuruaati charan ke taur par hi dekha janaa chahie
 Interestingly, there seems to be a lot of similarity between these things of Trotsky and many theories propounded by Lenin after World War I
 kuch trotskivaadiyon ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki 1917 kii kranti main lenin dwaara trotski ke hi siddhanton kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is another matter that Trotsky himself never said this after accepting Lenin's leadership in 1917
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne ek desh main samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii shodhpatr taiyaar kii
 Theorists like Bukharin were also with Stalin in this matter
 par trotski ne chetavanee di ki is siddhanth par amal karne ke nattejey rus ke liye vinaashkari niklenge
 He said that the time has not come for the collectivization of farming
 trotski lenin dwaara sthapit komintern ko soviet videsh niti ke aujaar main simit kar dene ke bhi viruddh the
 He argued that the Soviet Union must follow the path of industrialization and modernization, but these achievements cannot be considered synonymous with socialism
 samaajwaad kaa matlab he, shram kii unchi utpaadakta, uske parinamswaroop behatar jivan-str or apane poonjeewaad ke sarvaadhik viksit roopon jaisaa samaaj
 This can only happen when the proletariat has the reins of the world economy
 trotski kaa kahana tha ki stallin ke tahat jo soviet vyavastha he, use keval sankramanakalin samajha janaa chahie
 At present, it cannot be guaranteed that it will develop into socialism or it will degenerate into some version of capitalism
 trotski maanate the ki rus kii naukarshahi ek naye varg kii shakl leti ja rahi he
 Even though Soviet society has not reached the state of state capitalism, but its condition is like a lesser state of workers
 trotski ke vichaaron kii vishesh baat yah thi ki unamem marxvad ko har samasya kii achook aushadhi ke rup main dekhne kii pravritiyon kaa virodh nihit tha
 Similarly, he was also against pushing various fields of art-literature and knowledge in a particular direction in the name of Marxism
 apane in radical vichaaron ke baavjood ve party kaa bahumat apane paksh main nahin kar sake
 Within the party, he was seen as a leader who could provide charismatic leadership in case of a crisis, but was not interested in dealing with the everyday ups and downs within the party, and his intellectual brilliance i like to be alone
 jab trotski kii ummiido ke mutabik europe main kranti nahin hui, to unhone vishwa-kranti kaa lakshya chhod kar keval ek desh main samaajwaad kaa nirmaan karne main lag jane kii stalineey pariyojna ko iskaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Trotsky has never believed that the leninist-bolshevik idea of party and politics is at the root of the Stalinist mistakes, which has led to a single state-run state becoming its captive society
 darasal, trotski ne jivan ke tisare daur main nishkasana bhogate hue bhi 1903 se 1914 ke bich kii gayi lenin or bolshevikwaad kii apni kathor aalochanaon ko kabhi nahin doharaaya

 Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea and can only hunt continuously with sea ice, for which they spend most of the year on frozen seas
 dhruviya bhaaluu ko ek najuk prajati ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya he, jisaki 19 main se 8 up-jansankhya main giravat dekhi gai he
 For decades, unrestricted hunting raised international concern about the future of this species; After the introduction of quotas and controls, the population again took a positive stance
 For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a major center of the physical, spiritual and cultural life of the indigenous people of the Arctic, and polar bear hunting remains important in their culture

 The IUCN states, "if the climate continues, the polar bear will be eradicated from most of its territory within the next 100 years
" On May 14, 2008, the US Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act
