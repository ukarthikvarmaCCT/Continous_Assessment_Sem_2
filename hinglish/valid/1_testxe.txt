 The earliest Indian colony in the erstwhile Indochina peninsula was established in the Funan region around the first century AD
 lagbhag 600 varshon tak phunaan ne is pradesh main hindu samskruti kaa prachaar evam prasar karne main mahatvapurn yoga diya
 Subsequently, a great kingdom of Kambuj or Kambhoj was established in this region, whose glorious tradition of wonderful opulence continued till the 14th century AD
 is pracheen vaibhav ke avshesh aaj bhi angkorwat, angkorthom naamak sthanon main vartmaan hai
 According to the ancient legends of Kamboj, the foundation of this colony was laid by King Kambu Swayambhuva of 'aryadesh'
 vah bhagavan shiv kii prerana se kamboj desh main aae or yahan basii hui naag jati ke raja kii sahaayta se unhone is junglee marusthal main ek nayaa rajya basaaya jo nagaraj kii adbhut jaaduugari se hare bhare, sundar pradesh main parinat ho gaya
 Kambu married Nagaraj's daughter Mera and laid the foundation of the Kambuj dynasty
 yah bhi sambhav he ki bhartiya kamboj se bhi indochin main sthit is upnivesh kaa sambandh rahaa ho
 In the third century AD, an ambassador of Murunds who had settled on the northwestern border of India reached Funan and probably brought the horse of Kamboj with them
 kamboj ke pratham aitihaasik rajvansh kaa sansthaapak shrutvarman tha jisane kamboj desh ko phunaan kii adheenta se mukt kiya
 His son Shresthavarman settled the capital named Shresthapur in his name whose ruins are located near Watfu hill in Laos
 tatpashchaat bhavavarman ne, jiskaa sambandh phunaan or kamboj donon hi rajwanshon se tha, ek nayaa vansh chalaaya or apane hi naam bhavapur naamak rajdhani basaai
 The development of Kamboj begins with the time of Bhavavarman and his brother Mahendravarman
 phunaan kaa purana rajya ab jeernsheern ho chukaa tha or sheeghra hi is nae durgharsh samrajya main villin ho gaya
 After Mahendravarman's death, his son Ishaanavarman ascended the throne
 is pratapi raja ne kamboj rajya kii simaaon kaa dur-dur tak vistaar kiya
 He established diplomatic relations with India and Champa and built a new capital named Ishanpur
 ishanvarman ne champa ke raja jagaddharm ko apni putree byaahi thi jiskaa putr prakashdharm apane pita kii mrityu ke pashchaat champa kaa raja hua
 This suggests that Champa was under the political influence of Kamboj at this time
 ishanvarman ke baad bhavavarman dwitiya or jayavarman pratham kamboj nareshon ke naam milte hai
 This dynasty came to an end in 674 AD after Jayavarman
 kuch hi samay ke uparaant kamboj kii shakti ksheen hone lagi or dhire-dhire 8veen sadi i
 main java ke shailendra raajaaon kaa kamboj desh par aadhipatay sthapit ho gaya
 The Kamboj history of the 8th century AD is not very clear, but as soon as the beginning of the 9th century, the power of this ancient empire resurfaced
 iskaa shrey jayavarman dwitiya ko diya jaataa he
 He laid the foundation of Angkor dynasty and liberated Kamboj from the subjugation of Java
 usne sambhavat: bharat se hiranyadas naamak brahman ko bulawaakar apane rajya kii suraksha ke liye tantric kriyaayein karwaain
 This scholar Brahmin founded a sect called Devaraja which soon became the kingship of Kamboj
 jayavarman ne apni rajdhani kramash: kuti, hariharaalay or amrendrapur naamak nagaron main banaai jisase spasht he ki vartmaan cambodia kaa praaia: samast kshetra uske adheen tha or rajya kii shakti kaa centre dhire-dhire purv se pashchim kii ore badhata hua antat: angkore ke pradesh main sthapit ho gaya tha
 Jayavarman II was named Kambujarajendra and his Maharani under the name Kambujarajalakshmi during his time
 isi samay se cambodia ke pracheen naam kambuj yaa kamboj kaa videshi lekhakon ne bhi prayog karnaa prarambh kar diya tha
 Even after Jayavarman II, the empire of Kamboj continued to grow and grow and within a short time the empire of Kamboj spread throughout the Indochina peninsula
 maharaj indravarman ne anek mandiron or tadaagon kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 Yashovarman was a scholar of Hindu scriptures and Sanskrit poetry and he gave royalty to many scholars

 'angkore samskruti' kaa swarnakaal isi samay se hi pranrabh hota he
 In 944 AD, Rajendravarman was the king of Kamboj, whose large inscriptions of the time are found written in beautiful Sanskrit poetry

 tak kaa samay kamboj ke itihaas main mahatvapurn he kyonki is kaal main kamboj kii seemayen china ke dakshini bhaag chooti thim, laos uske antargat tha or uskaa raajnneetik prabhaav syam or uttari malaya tak failaa hua tha
 Suryavarman i established Kamboj's suzerainty over almost all of Siamese and also invaded the southern Brahmadesh
 vah sahitya, nyaay or vyakaran kaa pandit tha tathaa swayan buddha hote hue bhi shaiva or vaishnav dharmon kaa premi or sangrakshak tha
 He tried to reinvigorate the state by ending the civil war in the country at the time of his coronation
 uttari champa ko jitkar suryavarman ne use kamboj kaa karad rajya bana liya kintu sheeghra hi dakshin champa ke raja jayahari varman se haar manani padi
 At this time there was a lot of unrest in Cambog due to civil wars and conflicts with neighboring countries
 jayavarman saptam ke rajyakaal main pun: ek baar kamboj kii pracheen yash:pataakaa fahraane lagi
 He formed a large army which included the soldiers of Siamese and Brahmadesh

 main kambojon ko champa se hatana padaa
 But even then Jayavarman VII is counted among the great rulers of Kamboj as it was during that time that the expansion of the empire of Kamboj reached its extreme limit
 jayavarman saptam ne apni nai rajdhani vartmaan angkorthom main banaai thi
 Its ruins are still counted among the famous ancient relics of the world

 These Rajpaths were found near the Virat Hindu Temple in Beyoncé, which was located in the center of the city

 It is known from an inscription at this time that there were 789 temples and 102 hospitals and 121 hospital houses in Kamboj
 jayavarman saptam ke pashchaat kamboj ke itihaas ke anek sthal adhik spasht nahin hai
 In the 13th century, Kamboj lacked strong political power
 kuch itihasalekhakon ke anusaar kamboj ne 13veen sadi ke antim charan main china ke samrat kuble khan kaa aadhipaty maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 a messenger Angkorthom arrived from China in 1296 AD, a member of which shu-tan-kuan wrote a detailed and entertaining account of the then Kambos which was translated into French in 1902 AD
 14veen sadi main kamboj ke padosi rajyon main nai raajnneetik shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha tathaa syam or champa ke thai log kamboj kii ore badhane kaa nirantar prayaas kar rahe the
 The result was that there was a lot of pressure from two sides on Kamboj and it started to crush between the millstones of these two countries
 dhire-dhire kamboj kii pracheen mahatta samaapt ho gai or ab yah desh indochin kaa ek saadhaaran pichhadaa hua pradesh banakar rah gaya
 In the 19th century, French influence increased in Indochina; By the way, they came to this peninsula in the 16th century itself and were looking for an opportunity to increase their power
 vah avasar ab or 1854 i
 main kamboj ke nirbal raja ankaduong ne apana desh francisiyon ke haathon saunp diya
 Noordam i confirmed the deal on 11 August 1863 AD and for the next 80 years, Cambose or Cambodia remained a part of french-indochina

 Cambodia's influential King Noradam Sinhanuk continued his national movement against it
 inke praytn se cambodia sheeghra hi swatantra raashtra ban gaya or ye apane desh ke pratham pradhan mantri chune gaye
 Kamboj was an Indian colony in real sense

 Hinduism and the Vaishnava sect and then Buddhism were the kings of the Kambos and many Sanskrit inscriptions here would find it difficult to separate them from the Indian inscriptions due to their religious and mythological cultural background
 udhaaharan ke liye rajendravarman ke ek vishaal abhilekh kaa keval ek ansh yahan prastut he jisamen shiv kii vandana kii gai he : The old Arab tourists rightly named Kamboj as the Hindu country

 It is a country on the Indian China Peninsula which was freed from French occupation in 1955 AD

 This behavior first appears as an evolutionary paradox, because helping others gives them precious resources and reduces their fitness
 Earlier, many people interpreted as one aspect of group selection: the individual Doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole
 british vikasvaadi jeevigyaani dabludi hamiltan ne apane samanvit fitness siddhant main jin-frequency vishleshan kaa upyog karne ke liye yah dikhaaya ki kaise vanshanugat paropkaaree gun viksit ho sakate hai yadi aisi paropkaarita ke kalakaaron or praptakartaaon ke bich paryaapt anuvaanshik samanta he

sthiti main bhi simit samay ke liye vidyut kii samuchit aapurti sunishchit karata he jab aapurti ke mukhya strot se vidyut aaputi uplabdh nahin hoti
 upss are made in a variety of ways and apart from providing supplies for a limited time, they can do more things - such as voltage-control, frequency-control, power coefficient enhancement, and improve the quality of the device, and so on
 upies main urja-sanchay karne kaa koi ek saadhan hota he, jaise bydaree, tej gati se chaalit flihvil, aaweshit kiya hua sandharitra yaa ek atichaalak kundalee main pravaahit atyadhik dhara
 upss are different from auxiliary power sources such as standby generators, etc
 in the case that when power goes out they interfere with the power received by the concerned equipment for a negligible time, so that the work of that device is not interrupted or hindered
 upies kaa upyog computaron, aankada kendra, sanchaar upkarnon, aadi ke saath praaia: kiya jaataa he jahaan ki vidyut jane se koi durghatana ho sakati he; mahatvapurn aankade nasht hone kaa dar ho; vyapaar kaa nuksaan aadi ho saktaa ho
 UPS not only protects the computer from loss in case of over-voltage, but also provides power to the computer for some time after the power supply is gone, allowing users to save their work and keep the computer correct
 Ways to shut down
 yadi computer kii vidyut aapurti ekadam se chali jaae yaa asthir ho jaye to isse hard drive or ram kharaab hone kii sambhaavna rahati he tathaa madraboard bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 UPS must also have voltage control, so that UPS can protect the computer from this danger
 ye dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki upies ko bahari upkarnon se overlod na karen jaise anaavashyak printer, scinar or fax mashin aadi lagaana
 Never plug the printer into the battery back up system
 isi prakaar upies yaa to ofline prakaar kaa ho saktaa he yaa line-interactive prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 Offline UPS puts all the load on the battery
 swissover karne kaa rispance time, jise swimming time bhi kehete hai, 2 se 10 minute hota he
 Most switching-mode power supplies have a hold-up time of less than 16 minutes, which is higher than the ups's switching time, which will not cause computer shutdown
 vartmaan main milane vaale adhiktar upies line interective upies hote hai
 They control the input AC power to a limit and the battery is charged with AC power
 itnaa hi nahin, is tarah ke upies chote aakaar ke hote hai or adhiktar utpaadakon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Online UPS UPS are comparatively expensive
 is dizin main bydaree inwarter ke dwaara charge hoti he
 Since there is no direct connection to the AC line, it does not affect UPS in the line
 yadi ghar main computer prayog karte hai to iske liye tulanaatmak rup se saste standbai power system kaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 There are many types of UPS
 ek vargeekaran ke anusaar ye sthitik ho sakate hai yaa ghurni 
 UPS in which no rotating machine is used but only real semiconductor devices are called static UPS
 iske vipareet jinamein rotary mashiinon kaa upyog hota he unhen rotary upies kehete hai
 Were upies kii shakti kshamta adhik honi chaiye
 More upss are designed such that the devices connected to them can work up to 10 minutes after the power goes out
 iske liye ve
e
 reating dhyaan rakhni hoti he
 Ampere rating is written on computer / equipment, which can be multiplied by voltage
 aisa upies lenaa chaiye, jisaki ve
e
 reating 20 se 25 pratishat zyada ho
 a 600 volt-ampere rate UPS is enough for most pcs
 zyaadaatar upies byaap time ke aadhaar par liya jaataa he jisase uski puri kshamta kaa gyaan nahin ho paata he
 Battery backup depends entirely on how much energy the connecting device is consuming
 upkaran jitna shaktishaalee hoga, urja kii khapat utani zyada karegaa

 Property has been used by Eastern and Western societies as an essential item for social organization and social living
 sampatti shabd kaa aashay, isse sambandhit anya vichaaron se, jinhen "vastu" yaa "res", "domus" tathaa "swami" aadi shabdon se vyakt kiya gaya, viksit hua
 According to linguistics the term property is derived from the Latin adverb "possessor"
 iskaa vikaas "proprirts" naamak shabd se hua
 The word proprietis came to be used on an intellectual level by Roman legalists and was used in the colloquial language of France
 dhire dhire sampatti shabd kaa upyog bhoomi, dhan tathaa anya moolyawaan vastuon ke liye hone laga
 The meaning of the word "property" is definite when the term came to be used to express the relation of a family and objects belonging to its members
 baad main saamaajik paristhitiyon dwaara vyaktiyon kii vastuon ke abhigrahan or sangrakshan kii pravriti ko manyata praapt hui tathaa uske mul kaa auchity or aavashyaktaa dekhte hue sampatti kaa samarthan kiya jane laga
 It became an object of respect and its development started as an institution of social specialties
 aadim samaaj main dharm ke adhikari vidwaanon ne kanoon ko janm diya tathaa us samaaj main sampatti evam parivaar donon aviyojya shabd the kyonki donon kaa mul dharm hi tha tathaa donon ko dharm se hi manyata praapt thi
 Thus property, family and law were homogeneous or related terms in primitive society
 sanskrit shabd "grih" arthath ghar kii vyutpatti, "grah" shabd hui he jiske arth he, le lenaa, sweekaar karnaa, chin lenaa athwa vijay praapt karnaa
 It should be remembered that acquisition by winning by force or in war is a very ancient method
 manu ke anusaar, grih kii sthapana gruhasthi yaa parivaar kii neenv he
 The Latin word "domus", used for both "home" and "family", has its origin in "dominium", which in Roman jurisprudence is very important for explaining the meaning of property
 nyaaysanhita main "mensipium", "dominium" tathaa "propierts" kaa prayog sampatti athwa "swaamitv" ke liye samaan rup se kiya jaataa he
 Mancipium means acquisition, possession, especially land
 "mainsipium" shabd lagbhag sanskrit ke "grah" shabd ke hi samaan he
 In Roman, "dominium" or "propiratus" refers to a set of rights that signify ownership
 samay ke saath saath "swatv" kaa vikaas hua or dhire dhire iskaa aashay kisi vastu kaa swatantra upyog or use bhejne yaa de daalane kaa adhikaar samajha jane laga
 Religious feelings were also associated with property in primitive societies
 jahaan bhoomi or uske utpaadan jeevika ke pramukh saadhan the tathaa bhoomi abhigrahan kii vidhi atikaraman or vijay dwaara praapt karnaa tha, bhoomi tathaa kheti karne kaa adhikaar ek prakaar kaa dhan samajha jaataa tha or is prakaar yah ek jati athwa parivaar se sambadhit sampatti kaa pramukh ang tha
 Family property was only eligible for those who performed religious rituals for their ancestors
 purvajon ke liye dharmik anushthan karnaa nar vanshajon kaa hi pratham kartavya samajha jaataa tha
 Therefore, the right to cultivate, enjoy the land and purchase and sell it was obtained from birth
 putr kaa janmat: adhikaar mitakshra ne sweekaar kiya he
 According to Vijaneswar, birth is the cause of wealth
 hindu samaaj main kanoon kii yah nishchit sthiti he ki paitruk yaa purvajon kii sampatti kaa swatv janm se praapt hota he
 Gradually, the religious form of property disappeared
 mitakshra ke anusaar sampatti ihloki vastu he kyonki iskaa upyog sansaarik len dein ke liye hota he
 According to the commentators of Manusmriti, the meaning of property in the Aryans was related to the whole family, which included sons, daughters, wife and slaves
 samaaj ke vikaas ke saath putr, putree tathaa patni ko sampatti kii vastu yaa sampatti kaa ang na samajhakar unhen sampatti se pruthak astitv kii manyata di gai
 The legal suffix of flat in Indian law is the same as in English jurisprudence
 angreji kanoon bahut kuch roman kanoon se prabhavit he
 The word "property" can have many meanings, such as ownership or ownership, that is, the complete right of the owner
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth roman "res" hota he jise antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he jiske antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he arthath swayan vah vastu jo ukt adhikaar kaa vishay yaa paatr he
 The human meaning of "race" or "object" has helped in the development of the nature of property
 is prakaar "res" athwa "vastu" par adhikaar kaa sambodh or swayan "res" yaa "vastu" kaa sambodh sapatti sambandhi pratyay se jatil tathaa gahare rup se sambhddha he arthath donon ek duusare ke poorak or sahaayak he
 The meaning of "race" in Roman is extremely complex
 yah angreji kii tarah adhikaar kii thos vastu he
 But "race" is not exactly the same meaning as "object", it is more than that
 yadhyapi "res" kaa mul arth bhautik vastu he, parantu dhire dhire iskaa prayog aisi parisampatti ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi hone laga jo bhautik tathaa sthool hi na hokar amoort bhi ho sakati thi jaise bijli
 "race" is also used for exclusive rights and also for rights that arise, for example, from fame or fame
 is prakaar in do artho ke liye res kaa lagaataar prayog hone ke kaaran "res" ke do arth ho gaye : "res parthiv" arthath bhautik vastuen jo manushya ke adhikaron ke antargat aa sakati he tathaa "res aparthiv" arthath ve adhikaar swayan
 Thus, as a result of the final analysis, "object" will be taken to mean "race earth"
 roman bhashaa main "res" sampatti kii vastu tathaa adhikaar donon ke liye prayukt hota he, parantu "bona" shabd, jo saamaan yaa dhan ke liye prayukt hota he, sanskrit ke "dhan" shabd ke samakaksh he
 According to Arabic jurors the word "goods" can be used for property and any thing which has value or meaning in Arabic law or which can be in the possession of a person
 "dhan" shabd bhi sampatti ke liye bahudhaa prayukt hota he
 The object to be used in the sense of property must have the qualities of stability and physical unity
 ikaayiyon ke ek sangrah ko jisaki ikaiyaan swayan pruthak vastu hon or aisi ekal ikaayiyon ke sammilan se bani vastu ko bhi vastu kah sakate hai; jaise ek eent athwa eenton se nirmit ek makaan yaa ek bhend athwa kai bhedon se bana ek jhuden
 In law, the object is also used to express certain rights and duties
 bhautik gunon ke aadhaar par "vastu" do prakaar kii ho sakati he - chal athwa achal
 But according to the technical rules of English law, things are real and personal
 roman kanoon ke anusaar "res" ko isi prakaar "maincipebul" tathaa anamancipubul main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 In this way property is related to another "race" or "object" and on the other hand to human rights related to race or object
 isliye sampatti ke liye ek aisa vyakti aavashyak he jo kisi vastu par apana adhikaar rakh sake
 Property, according to the final analysis, expresses the relationship established between a person and an object or right, which he considers only his own
 apane aadhunik prayogon main sampatti un sabhi vastuon yaa sampada ke liye prayukt hoti he jo kisi vyakti se sambandhit ho yaa us vyakti ne kisi anya ko samarpit kar diya ho parantu apane laabh ke liye us vastu kii vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar surakshit rakhata ho
 The classification of property according to the nature of the race or object and the nature of the object or rights are classified in various ways, eg, earthly or non-living; Movable or immovable and real or personal
 sampatti ke saath anya vishisht shabdon jaise vyaktigat yaa saarvajanik, paitruk, daayayogy, sanyukt paariwarik, samadhikarik aadi ke sanyukt kar dene se sampatti ke swaroop ke saath sambandh vyakt hota he
 According to the statutory interpretation of property it has many meanings
 sampatti ke antargat kisi vyakti ke dwaara kiye gaye shaareerik tathaa maansik parishram ke fal bhi aate hai
 Any person gets whatever he gets in exchange for something he is given and whatever is considered by the law or given the right to use, enjoy and arrange it, All is called that person's personal property
 parantu kanoon dwaara manyata na praapt hone par use sampatti nahin kaha ja saktaa or tab vidhik parinaam kii drushti se vyakti or vastu ke bich koi sambandh nahin rah jaataa he
