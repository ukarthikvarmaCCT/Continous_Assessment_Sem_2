 Premchand is one of the greatest Indian writers in Hindi and Urdu
 mul naam dhanpat raay shrivastav, premchand ko nawab raay or munshi premchand ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Seeing his contribution in the field of novels, the famous novelist of Bengal, Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, addressed him as novel Samrat
 premchand ne hindi kahani or upanyaas kii ek aisi parampara kaa vikaas kiya jisane puri sadi ke sahitya kaa maargdarshan kiya
 Premchand laid the foundation of the realistic tradition of literature by deeply influencing an entire generation
 unka lekhan hindi sahitya kii ek aisi viraasat he jiske bina hindi ke vikaas kaa adhyayan adhuraa hoga
 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor
 beesvin shatee ke purvarddh main, jab hindi main takneekee suvidhaon kaa abhaav tha, unka yogadan athulaneey he
 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh
 premchand kaa janm 31 july 1880 ko varanasi ke nikat lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya
 At the age of 13, he read tilism-e-hoshruba and got acquainted with the novels of famous Urdu writers Ratananath 'sharasar', Mirza Hadi Ruswa and Maulana Sharr
 1898 main metric kii pariksha uteern karne ke baad ve ek sthaneey vidhyalay main shikshak niyukt ho gaye

 His early life was a struggle because his mother died at the age of seven and his father died at the age of fourteen
 unka pehla vivaah un dinon kii parampara ke anusaar pandrah saal kii umr main hua jo safal nahin rahaa
 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time
 unhone vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan kiya or 1906 main doosraa vivaah apni pragatisheel parampara ke anuroop bal-vidhwaa shivarani devi se kiya
 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di
 After this, he started writing in the name of Premchand
 unhone aarambhik lekhan zamana patrika main hi kiya
 He became seriously ill in the last days of his life
 unka upanyaas mangalsutra puraa nahin ho sakaa or lambi beemaari ke baad 8 oktober 1936 ko unka nidhan ho gaya
 His last novel Mangal Sutra was completed by his son Amrit

 bees varshon kii is avadhi main unki kahaniyon ke anek rang dekhne ko milte hai
 Before them, fictional, airy and mythological religious works were used in Hindi
 premchand ne hindi main yatharthwaad kii shuruuaat kii
 "much of the discussion of Indian literature that emerged from prominence later, whether it is Dalit literature or women's literature, has its roots somewhere deep in Premchand's literature
 " premchand ke lekh 'pehali rachana' ke anusaar unki pehali rachana apane mamaa par likhaa vyangy thi, jo ab anuplabdh he
 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he

 The problems of farmers, laborers, women, Dalits, etc
 have been depicted seriously in their stories

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness
 kahani or upanyaas dono main ugantarkari parivartan kiye
 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting

 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke

 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement

 The film goes back in time and comes from the Bhootnath village to the city of Kolkata in search of a job with a brother-in-law who lives in the residence of the relatives of this mansion

 At night, when Bhoothnath sees the activities going on in the mansion, he is taken aback

 He also secretly enjoys the running of the middle babu in the mansion
 bhootnath kaarakaane ke sheeghra chhapane vaale vigyaapan ko thik karaane ke liye subinay babu ke paas jaataa he lekin jabaa vahaan hoti he jo bhootnath ko vigyaapan padhane ko kahati he
 Such miraculous things are written in that advertisement that if the wife or girlfriend falls in front of her husband or lover wearing that vermilion, then the husband or lover will be fascinated on it
 us raat chote babu kaa naukar bansi bhootnath ke paas aata he or kahata he ki choti bahu use bula rahi he

 When Bhoothnath comes back after some time, he finds that the younger daughter-in-law is addicted to alcohol and the younger Babu is crippled
 vah jab jabaa ke paas jaataa he to pataa chalata he ki abhi-abhi subinay babu kaa dehant ho gaya he or jabaa mlech na hokar ek sambhrant parivaar kii ladki he or subinay babu jabaa ko gaanv se churaakar laaye the lekin ek saal kii umr main hi uskaa usee gaanv ke atuly chakravarti se vivaah kar diya gaya tha

 By lengthening the surface between the metal-installed shell of the high-voltage terminal and the spark plug, the physical shape of the ribs serves to improve electrical insulation and prevents electrical energy from seeping through the resistive surface into the metal shell

 The exact design and length of the insulator determines the heat range of the plug
 chote visanvahak "thande" plag hote hai
 The "hot" plug is made with a long passage attached to the metal body, for which the insulator is isolated from most of its length with an annular groove

 With the development of leaded petrol in the 1930s, lead deposition on asbestos became a problem and it reduced the gap required to clean spark plugs
 ise rokane ke liye nisaadit aluminium oxide ko germany main cemens dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 Since the spark plug also seals the combustion chamber or engine when installed, these seals ensure that there is no leakage from the combustion chamber

 The metal shell of the spark plug withstands the tightening of the plug, removing the heat from the insulator and sending it to the cylinder head and acting as a base for the spark which allows the spark to pass through the central electrode

 a plug that is 'cold' enough to cope with the demand for high-speed driving will not be able to stop the frozen carbon deposits caused by the urban conditions of stop-start and in these conditions will deteriorate, causing the engine not to turn on
 Will be able to do
 Similarly, a plug that was 'hot' enough to run smoothly in the city could actually melt when used at extended high speeds on long roads
 The answer to this problem, discovered by spark plug manufacturers, was a central electrode that carried the heat of combustion away from the nozzle more effectively than was possible by a solid nickel alloy
 is kaam ke liye tambe kaa chunaav kiya gaya or ek copper-cord kendriya electrode ke vinirmaan kii paddati ko floform dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 The central electrode is usually designed to throw out electrons because it is the hottest part of the plug; The emission of electrons from a hot surface is easy and the physical principles are the same which increase the emission of steam from the heated surface

 It is easiest to pull electrons from the pointed electrode but a pointed electrode is weathered only after a few seconds
 iske bajaay, electron, electrode ke chor ke tej kinaaron se utsarjan karte hai; jab ye kinare kharaab ho jate hai, to spark kamjor or kam vishwasaneey ho jaataa he
 There was a time when it was common to remove a spark plug and its edges were cleaned manually or with a special sandblasting device after which the sharp edges of the electrodes were remodeled, but this action has now reduced considerably
 Because spark plugs are now only replaced at very long intervals

 The belief that the plug gap is sent from the factory to the box fill is only partially true, proving that the same plug can be specified for many different engines
 Is where each requires a separate gap
 automobile main spark plag kaa gap aam taur par 
035"-0
070" ke bich hota he 
 But this may depend on the engine: the new spark plugs may already be gapped for the V-8 engine, where all 8 plugs are installed without converting; But if installed in a 6 cylinder engine, all plugs will require re-gapping

 Gap adjustment can be very important and if it is wrong then the engine will run poorly, or not at all
 a narrow gap produces a very small or weak spark that cannot effectively ignite the fuel-air mixture, while a gap that is too wide can prevent the spark from starting
 baharhaal, jo spark eendhan-hawa mishran ko prajvalit karne main yada-kada vifal hota he use ho saktaa he pratyaksh rup se naa dekha ja sake, balki vah ingine kii shakti or eendhan dakshata main kami ke rup main dikhaai degaa

 As the plugs become old and the metal grips of both the nozzle and hook, the gap widens, so experienced mechanics often place this gap at the minimum interval specified by the engine manufacturer and not between the specified allowable gaps
 , So that the duration between plugs can be prolonged
 duusari ore, chunki ek bada gap ek adhik "garm" yaa "moti" chingaari detaa he or eendhan-hawa mishran ke adhik vishwasaneey prajvalan ko badhaata he or chunki kendriya electrode par nukili kinari vaala ek nayaa plag puraane, ghise hue plag kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey tareeke se spark karata he, anbhavi meconic bhi yah maanate hai ki ingine nirmaataa dwaara nirdisht adhiktam gap sabase zyada hota he jo puraane plag ke saath bhi vishwasaneey rup se spark karegaa; isliye plag ko ek adhik chaudaai main nirdhaarit karnaa sambhav taaki adhik ucch nishpaadan anuprayogon main vishwasaneey prajvalan ko sunishchit kiya ja sake or jisase nok ke karaab hote hi plag ko baar-baar badalane se chhutkaaraa mil sake
 The design of the original spark plug has been undergoing tests for years to provide better ignition, longer life, or both features
 is tarah ke badlaavon main shaamil he do, teen, yaa chaar samaan antaraal par sthit ground electrode kaa upyog jo kendriya electrode ko ghere rahata he
 Other forms include the use of a recessed central electrode surrounded by a sparkplug thread, which effectively becomes the ground electrode
 iske alaava vahaan ground electrode kii nok par ve aakaar ke daant kaa istemaal bhi shaamil he
 Many ground electrodes typically provide longer life, because when the spark gap widens due to electrical current damage, the spark moves closer to another close ground electrode
 kai ground electrode kaa nuksaan yah he ki ingine dahan chember main ek parirakshan prabhaav utpann ho saktaa he jisase eendhan hawa ke mishran ke jalane par lau baadhit ho sakati he
 This may result in a less efficient combustion and increased fuel consumption

 In this modified form the free-end pipe tuned to the ground electrode is used, and one end closed pipe is used in the central electrode to generate ultrasound

 This has the physical effect of increasing the surface area of the exposed fuel droplets in the sub-micrometer area
 vardhit tal-kshetrafal se phir vardhit abhikriya or dahan dakshata falit hoti he
 a piston engine consists of a part of the combustion chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; And this area is where the traditional spark plug is located
 ek vankel ingine main ek sthaayee rup se alag dahan kshetra hota he or spark plag anivaary rup se nok kii sil dwaara nasht kar diya jaataa he
 Obviously, if a spark plug were to penetrate into the Wankel combustion chamber, it would deform the rotating nozzle; And if the plug is sunken to prevent this, the submerged spark can provide weak combustion
 isliye ek nae prakaar ke "surphace discharge" plag ko vankel ke liye viksit kiya gaya
 Such a plug presents an almost flat panel to the combustion chamber
 ek thunthdaar kendriya electrode sirf thodaa sa baahar niklaa rahata he; or plag kaa puraa dhansa hua bhaag said electrode kaa kaam karata he
 The advantage is that the plug is placed just below the tip seal that passes over it, making the fuel / air mixture accessible to the spark
 "plag gap" apane jivan bhar ek jaisaa bana rahata he; or spark maarg lagaataar badalata rahata he 
 While a conventional side electrode interrupts use and potentially damages the engine, this is impossible with a surface discharge plug, as there is nothing to break
 surphace discharge spark plag ko, paraspar rup se champion or bosch dwaara utpaadit kiya jaataa he
 Most spark plugs are sealed with a cylinder head with a hollow metal washer that is slightly pressed between the head and the flat surface of the plug, just above the thread
 plag ko sthapit karne ke liye prayukt bal agar atyadhik nahin he, to plag ko hathaaye jane or punah lagaae jane ke samay washar ko dubaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki is abhyaas kii, sakhti se bolaa jaae to sifarish nahin kii jaati he or pratisthaapan vashar uplabdh hai
 Ford engines, however, differed in that they used narrow brakes and had a threaded bottom of the plug above the thread that sealed the plug
 in plegon ko sthapit karne or nikaalane ke liye adhik bal lagata tha or agar rinch ko dhuree se aanshik rup se hataa kar lagu kiya jaataa use todna aasaan tha
 Recently, some variants of the Ford Fiesta and Ka had similar sealing arrangements

 In addition, they have been observed to deteriorate inside the cylinder head, especially if left for a long time
 In such a situation, a breakdown of the plug under the hexagonal nut has also been observed, and during this time the part of the cylinder head remains undrilled
 ford ne kai baar TSB jari kiya he or takanicianon ko yaad dilaayaa he ki ve sthapana ke sahi tareekon ko hi apanaaen
 The threaded portion of the plug must be closely matched according to the thickness of the head
 agar ek plag dahan chember main bahut andar tak jaataa ho, to ye piston se takaraa saktaa he or ingine ko aatanrik rup se nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Less dramatically, if the threads of the plug extend to the combustion chamber, the sharp edges of the thread serve as point sources of heat that can cause pre-ignition; In addition, deposition between open threads can make it difficult to remove the plug and damage the threads on the aluminum head in the removal process
 chember main tip kaa failaav plag ke pradarshan ko bhi prabhavit karata he, tathaapi, spark plag jitna adhik kendra main sthit hoga, vaayu-eendhan mishran kaa prajvalan aam taur par utana hi adhik behatar hoga, haalanki visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki prakriya vastav main or adhik jatil or dahan kaksh ke aakaar par nirbhar he
 On the other hand, if an engine is "burning oil", excess oil leakage in the combustion chamber can corrode the plug tip and prevent sparks; In such cases, a common plug with less dispersion than the engine will be used which often produces less malfunction and performs better over a longer period of time
 vastav main, vishesh "gandagee-virdohi" adapter bhi bikate hai jo plag or head ke bich feet ho jate hai or sirf isi kaaran ke liye plag ke failaav ko kam karte hai, inkaa istemaal gambhir tel dahan samasyaon vaale puraane ingine main hota he; isse vaayu eendhan mishran kaa prajvalan kam prabhavi ho saktaa he, lekin aise maamalon main, yah kam mahatv kaa hota he
 The operating temperature of a spark plug is the actual physical temperature of the tip of the spark plug within the running engine
 yah kai karkon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he, lekin mukhya rup se dahan kaksh ke bheetar vaastavik taapmaana se nirdhaarit hota he
 There is no direct relationship between the actual operating temperature and spark voltage of the spark plug
 haalanki, ingine dwaara utpaadit tork kaa vartmaan str, spark plag ke sanchaalan taapmaana ko joardaar rup se prabhavit karegaa kyonki adhiktam taapmaana or dabaav tab hota he jab ingine charam tork ke nazadik kaam karata he 
 The temperature of the insulator is exposed in the combustion chamber to thermal conditions but reacts to the contrary
 agar spark plag kaa tip bahut garm he to yah purv-prajvalan janit kar saktaa he yaa kabhi-kabhi dhadaaka / dastak or nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 If it is too cold, electrical conductive deposits may accumulate above the insulator, causing a loss of spark energy or actual shortening of the spark current
 ek spark plag ko us haalat main "garm" kaha jayega agar vah ek behatar taap visanvahak he or jo spark plag kii tip main adhik garmi rakhata he
 a spark plug will then be called "cool" if it conducts more heat than the spark plug tip and reduces the heat of the tip
 ek spark plag "garm" he yaa "thanda" is baat ko spark plag kii taap seemaa ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The heat range of a spark plug is usually specified as a number, where some manufacturers use the ascending number for hot plugs and others do the opposite, using ascending numbers for cold plugs
 ek spark plag kii taap seemaa spark plag ke nirmaan se prabhavit hoti he: istemaal kii gai saamagree, visanvahak kii lambaai or dahan chember ke andar plag kaa tal-kshetrafal
 saamaanya upyog ke liye, spark plag taap seemaa kaa chayan ek santulan he jiske tahat tip ko adarsh sthiti main garm rakhaa jaataa he taaki karaab naa ho jaae or adhiktam shakti par itnaa thanda bhi rakhaa jaataa he ki purv-prajvalan yaa ingine nalking naa ho
 By examining the "hot" and "cold" spark plugs made by the same manufacturer side by side, the principle involved can be clearly understood; The cold plug has a low enough ceramic central electrode and an insulator to fill the gap between the shell, which loads the gap, while the hot plug contains more ceramic material so that the tip remains isolated from the body of the plug and heat
 Keep it better
 dahan kaksh se garmi, nikaas gaison ke madhyam se nikalati he or silendar ke paksh deevaaron se or khud spark plag se bhi
 ek spark plag kii taap seemaa keval dahan kaksh or samgr ingine ke taapmaana par ek minute ke prabhaav padataa he
 a cold plug will not actually lower the temperature of a running engine
 balki, ek "garm" yaa "thande" plag kaa mukhya prabhaav, spark plag ke tip ke taapmaana ko prabhavit karnaa he
 It was common before the modern era of computerized fuel injection to specify a couple of different heat ranges for plugs for at least one automobile engine; a hot plug for cars that were mostly around the city operated slowly and a cold plug for continuous high speed use on the highway
 This practice, however, has largely become obsolete now and cars' fuel / air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are kept within a narrow range, for purposes of limited emissions
 ingine ko racing karnaa, tathaapi, abhi bhi ek uchit plag taap seemaa ke chayan se labhanvit hota he
 Very old racing engines sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just to start and the other just to be installed when the engine is overheated, to actually drive the car
 spark plag nirmaataa apane spark plag kii taap seemaa ko nirupit karne ke liye alag numberon kaa prayog karte hai
 The table below gives the equivalent spark plug numbers between different manufacturers

 spark plag ko nirikshan ke liye hataaya ja saktaa he, plag par dahan ke prabhaavon kii jaanch kii ja sakati he
 a test, or 'understanding' of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the spark plug can indicate the position within the running engine
 spark plag tip ke chihn ingine ke andar ho rahi kriyaaon kaa sakshya darshaaenge
 charam shakti par chal rahe ingine ke andar kya ho rahaa he yah jaanane kaa aamtaur par anya koi tarika nahin he
 Engine and spark plug manufacturers publish information about the characteristic markings in the plug reading chart
 is tarah ke chart saamaanya upyog ke liye upyogi he, lekin racing ingine spark plag kii reeding ke liye lagbhag kisi kaam ke nahin he, jo puri tarah se bilkul alag baat he
 If the color of the tip of the block deteriorates to light brown, it should be understood that proper action is going on; Other conditions can be a sign of malfunction

 Damage to the tip of the spark plug is also occurring inside the cylinder
 baari visphot se spark plag visanvahak or aantarik ingine hisse turant tut sakate hai jo sandblast ghisaav pradarshit hone se pehle sune ja sakate hai
 As another example, if the plug is too cold, there will be deposits on the nose of the plug
 Conversely if the plug is too hot, the ceramic part will look porous, almost like sugar
 The material that connects the central electrode to the insulator will boil
 Sometimes the end of the plug will appear flashing when the deposition materials are melted

 Thus, to obtain the most valuable information, the engine is run with high speed and full load and immediately ignition is cut off and the plug is removed for testing without stopping or slowing down the speed
 spark plag reeding vyler, jo maatr flashlit / aavardhak kaa sanyukt rup he, spark plag kii reeding ko sudhaarney ke liye uplabdh hai
 Their "indexing" when installing plugs is a matter of some debate, usually only for high performance or racing applications; This involves installing them so that the open area of the spark gap, not surrounded by the ground electrode, faces the center of the combustion chamber, rather than the wall, towards the intake valve
 Some engine fixers believe this will maximize the exposure of the fuel-air mixture to the spark, as well as ensuring that each combustion chamber is uniform in layout and therefore results in better ignition; Others, however, believe that its use is only useful in ultra high-compression ground electrodes out of the piston's path in the event of insufficient clearance
 kisi bhi ghatana main, ise plag ke baahar gap kaa sthaan ankan karne, sthapit karne or nishaan kii disha ko dhyaan main rakhane ke dwaara hasil kiya jaataa he; phir plag ko hataa diya jaataa he or atirikt vaasharon ko joda jaataa he taaki kase hue plag ke orientation ko badla ja sake
 This must be done individually for each plug, as the orientation of the gap relative to the shell thread is random

 In India, the Ambudsman is known as the Lokpal
 finland main 1918main, denmark main 1954main, norway main 1961 main va britain main 1967main ombudsman kii sthapana bhrashtachar samaapt karne ke liye kii gai
 Ombuds are known by different names in different countries
 england main ise sansadeey ayukta, seviyat sangh main ‘vaktaa‘ athwa prosicutor va denmark env nujiland main england kii tarah sansadeey ayukta ke naam se jaanate he evam bharat main ise lokapal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 By the middle of 1967, the Ombudsman organization had spread to 12 countries

 The Lokpal Bill was introduced in India in 1971, which could not be passed by the dissolution of the fifth Lok Sabha
 rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad lokapal vidheyak 26 agast1985 ko sansad main prastut kiya gaya or 30 agast 1985 ko sansad main is vidheyak ke praaroop ko punarvichaar ke liye sanyukt pravar samiti ko saunp diya, jo paarit na ho sakaa
 At present, social activist Anna Hazare is motivating the countrymen to bring Lokpal will and is meeting with politicians but due to the lack of consensus between Anna Hazare and Kapil Sibal, this bill is in the circle of churches
 prashan yah he ki bharat main lokapal vidheyak ke daayre main rashtapati, uparashtapati, pradhanmantri, kendriya mantriyo, sheersh nyaaypalika va loksabhaa adhyaksh aadi ko rakhaa jaae
 For this, after studying the circumstances of reference of ministers, public servants and judiciary, who are under the purview of Ombudsmen in different countries, we should place the civil servants and ministers etc
 under the purview of the Lokpal to suit Indian conditions
 videshon main praapt lokapal ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaale adhikariyon, mantriyon aadi ke bare main gyaan praapt karke bharat main bhrashtachar unmoolan ke liye vibhinn adhikariyon ko iske daayre main laana chahie
 In addition to the civilian administrative staff, judges and clergy have also been placed under the scrutiny of Sweden's Ombudsman, but the ministers are outside their jurisdiction so that parliamentary responsibility is not divided
 denmark main lokapal mantriyon tathaa lok karmchaariyon kii to jaanch kar saktaa he parantu nyaayadhishon ke kaary or vyavhaar par tippadi nahin kar saktaa
 In New Zealand, the Lokpal does not have the right to place direct control over a minister
 videshi sambandh, antardeshiy rajasav or pradhanmantreey vibhaag bhi uske kshetra ke baahar he
 Whereas in the UK, the investigation of the Lokpal comes under the purview of all the Ministries, Departments, Civil Services Commission, Central Information Office etc
 videsh sambandh, suraksha, karmchaaree prashasan, police kriya, nigam, sarkari theke aadi ko lokapal kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 The frequency at which a body vibrates in the absence of any external driving force or damping force is called the natural frequency of that body

 In practice, if a computer is defined, then we can call hardware as human body and software as its soul
 hardware computer ke hisson ko kehete hai, jinhen ham apni aankhon se dekh sakate hai, chhu sakate hai athwa aujaaron se unpar kaary kar sakate hai
 This is the real substance
 iske vipareet software koi padaarth nahin he
 These are the information, commands or methods on which the computer hardware works
 computer hardware software se parichit hote hai athwa software computer ke hardware se parichit evam unpar aadhaarit hote hai
 Earlier, there was only one computer system for a task and it was given programs at the mechanical level, which was economical to change
 takanic ke vikaas ke saath aise yantransh bananaa takneekee rup se sambhav or aarthik rup se laabhadaayak ho sakaa
 It was very difficult to program early computer systems because at that time the theory that software was also in the initial state of a set of information which was safe in the memory of a device
 tab 'panch card' naamak saadhaaran se yantransh par computer ke yantransh ko diye jane vaale kramadesh ke nirdesh sidhe likhe jate the
 All instructions were given to the computer software with the help of only two digits - '0' and '1'
 ise dwaidh nirdesh kehete he, dwaidh rup ke hi kramadeshon ko hi yantransh lagu kar saktaa he
 In technical terms, there are three types of software
 “system software” yah ek aisa program hota he, jinka kaam system arthath computer ko chalaanaa tathaa use kaam karne laayak banaae rakhana he
 System software adds life to the hardware
 oparating system, compiler aadi system sofyware ke mukhya bhaag hai
 'application software' is called programs that are written to perform core tasks based on our computer

 Three types of rights, ie copyright, trade secret, and patents, affect computer software

 We have discussed it separately in patents and computer software
 object code computer ko chalaata he or yah sadaa prakashit hota he, parantu kya yah kisi chiz kaa varnan he athwa nahin is bare main shankaa thi
 Under the TRIPS agreement, it was said that computer programs should be protected like copyright
 isaliye object code hamaare desh main tathaa sansar ke anya deshon main isi prakaar se surakshit kiya gaya he
 Object code of a computer program is published, but not everyone's source code is published
 jin kamputer program ke sorce code prakashit kiye jate hai unamem to ve copirite se surakshit hote hai
 But computer programs whose source code is not published are protected like trade secret
 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive
 is par reverse ingeneering kaa kanoon bhi lagu hota he
 That is why the source code is not published
 ise gopneey rakh kar, ise zyada aasaani se surakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reverse engineering is also an interesting subject, more on this sometime
 open sorce sauftware main sorce code hameshaa prakashit hota he
 What kind of authority its writers have over it depends on the terms of the licenses under which they are published
 open sorce sauftware main kuch license kii sharten use copileft karti hai
 It is also known as free software or GPOLD software
 in software ko koi bhi vyakti muft main downlod kar saktaa he, istemaal kar saktaa he, vitareet kar saktaa haievam isame apni jarurat ke mutabik badlaav bhi kar saktaa he

 The help, advice and guidance given to overcome a person's personal problems and difficulties is called counseling

 Counseling is a specialized service conducted under direction
 yah ek sahyagi prakriya he
 In this, the counselor approaches the servant through interview and observation, making him aware of his strengths and limitations
 sabhi samaajon main paraamarsh dene or paraamarsh praapt karne kii parampara paayi jaati he
 Counseling becomes necessary and unavoidable, whether it is a problem of selection of two options, any kind of confusion, or mental stress
 paraamarsh main kam se kam do vyaktiyon kii liptata avashya hoti he, ek paramarshak yaa paraamarsh daata or doosraa paraamarsh praapt karne vaala
 The person seeks counseling to solve their personal problems
 vyaktigat samasya shaareerik, maansik, vyavsaay sambandhi tathaa samaaj sambandhi ho sakati he jiske liye use paramarshak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Consultation is basically reciprocal

 a person seeks counseling from someone he believes in and if the counselor is honest, honest and conscientious, he counsels the person he thinks will accept the advice and follow it as soon as possible

 Counselor should be experienced, intelligent, alert and mature whose benefits can be met by the candidate
 samaaj-gathan ke aarmabhik dinon main paraamarsh na to vyavasthit tha or na vaigyanik
 There was no process
 iskaa koi swaroop bhi nahin tha
 The counselor did not make any kind of preparations before counseling and neither did he wish for consultative counseling keeping in mind the specific goal
