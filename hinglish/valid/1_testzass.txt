 iesao code: srx The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race
 british logon ne prachaarit kiya ki lagbhag 1700 i
pus
 main hind-arya janajatiyon ne europe se aakar sindhu-ghati main akraman kiya or bharat kii deshi sindhu ghati sabhyataa ko ujaad diya or uske nivaasiyon kaa narsanhaar kiya or baad main bache-khuche logon ko das bana liya -- jinako rugveda main das or dasyu kaha gaya he 
 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi
 Simultaneously, the big cities in the Indus Valley Civilization, the consumption of fish, 2000 B

 Before the complete absence of the horse and even later the very few remains of the horses, the pictures of their gods being different from those of the Vedic deities, their reverence for tigers and bulls whereas the Babbar-lion and cow are more mentioned in the Rigveda, in most of their cities
 The lack of Vedic yajna-fire-altar, etc
 indicate that its inhabitants were not Aryans

 tamil ek bhashaa he jo mukhyatah tamilnadu tathaa srilanka main boli jaati he
 It is the official language in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
 yah srilanka tathaa singapore kii kai rajbhashaon main se ek he
 Tamil is considered the oldest language in the Dravidian language family
 isaki utpatti ke sambandh main abhi tak yah nirnay nahin ho sakaa he ki kis samay is bhashaa kaa prarambh hua
 Like the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, etc
, the scholars of the world have considered Tamil as a very ancient and rich language
 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha tamil bhashaa kii visheshta yah he ki yah ati pracheen bhashaa hokar bhi lagbhag 2500 varshon se avirat rup se aaj tak jivan ke sabhi kshetron main vyavahrut he
 On the basis of the texts available in the Tamil language, it has been an undisputed decision that the Tamil language had become well-organized and well-organized several hundred years before Christ
 mukhya rup se yah bharat ke dakshini rajya tamil nadu, shri lanka ke tamil bahul uttari bhaagon, singapore or malaysia ke bhartiya mul ke tamilon dwaara boli jaati he

 is bhashaa kaa itihaas kam se kam 3000 varsh purana mana jaataa he
 Excellent literature has been composed in ancient Tamil to modern Tamil
 tamil sahitya kam se kam pichle do hazaar varshon se astitv main he
 The earliest inscriptions found are around the 3rd century BC
 tamil sahitya kaa aarambhik kaal, sangam sahitya, 300 ipu – 300 isvin kaa he
 The name of this language is pronounced as "tamil" or "tamil" in Hindi-language pronunciation
 tamil bhashaa ke sahitya tathaa nighantu main tamil shabd kaa prayog 'madhur' arth main hua he
 Some scholars have proved the origin of Tamil by showing the form of the word Dravid> Dravid> Dramid> Dramil> Tamil, etc
, from the Sanskrit word Dravid, but most of the Tamil scholars strongly disagree with this idea
 tamil main hindi tathaa kuch anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke vipareet ling-vibhed pramukh nahin hota he
 The same letter is used in Tamil for many letters of the Devanagari alphabet, namely - tamil bhashaa main kuch or varna hote hai jinka prayog saamaanya hindi main nahin hota he
 For example: ள, ழ, ற, ன
 tamil bhashaa vatt elttu lipi main likhi jaati he
 Compared to other Indian languages it clearly has fewer letters
 devanagari lipi kii tulana main isamen deergh e tathaa deergh o bhi hai
 Only the first and last letters of each class are present, not the middle letters
 r or l ke adhik teevr rup bhi hai
 There is also a soft form of neither
 sha, sha ek hi akshar dwaara nirupit hai
 a distinctive sound of the Tamil language is ழ, used in the Tamil word itself

 Sameer eventually expresses her
 jab uske mata-pita use sidney, australia main paariwarik vyavsaay ke liye kaam karne ke liye bhejte hai, to akaash ko pataa chalata he ki vah shalini ke bagal main sanyog se baitha he
 He asks her to rotate around the new city

 Akash tries to let her go, but then realizes that he is unable to do so
 vah bharat lautataa he or uski shaadi kii purv sandhya par usase pyaar kaa izhaar karata he
 Shalini's family accepts her with blessings
 tara ko liver serosis ke saath aspataal main bhartee karaayaa jaataa he or siddharth ke saath saamne bistar par mar jaati he
 Siddharth and Akash finally reconcile
 chah maheene baad teenon dost shalini or puja ke saath yaadon ko phir se uttejit karne ke liye goa jate hai

 This longitude is considered Greenwich Mean Time / Prime Meridian
 All 180 ° longitudes east of this line are called longitude and all 180 ° longitudes in the west are called western longitudes
 Normally the eastern longitude is directed by e and western longitudes are directed by W
 There is a difference of 4 minutes between the two longitudes, that is, the Earth takes 4 minutes to rotate 1 ° longitude
 At 15 ° the Earth takes 1 hour

 Multiple cpus can be combined into a single processing chip
 CPU kii pichhali pidiyon ke liye ek yaa adhik circuit bordon par asatat ghatakon or kai chote ekikrut circuit ke rup main lagu kiya gaya
 Microprocessors, on the other hand, are cpus built on a very small number of ics, usually just one

 The fundamental operation of most cpus, despite physically taking them, is to execute a sequence of stored instructions that are called in a program
 nirdesh kriyanvit kiya ja karne ke liye computer smriti ke kuch prakaar main rakhaa jaataa he
 Almost all cpus carry out, interpret and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as instruction cycles
 ek nirdesh ke nishpaadan ke baad, puri prakriya ko agle nirdesh chakra saamaanya rup se kaarykram counter main vruddhi hoti mulya kii vajah se agle -in- anukram anudesh dilkash saath doharaata he
 If a jump instruction was executed, the program counter would be modified to prevent the address that was jumped to and the program's address normally released
 or adhik jatil cpus main, kai nirdesh dilvaaya ja saktaa he, dicode, or ek saath maar daalaa
 This section describes what is commonly known as the "classic RISC pipeline", which is quite common among simple cpus used in many electronic devices
 yah kaaphi had tak sipiu cash kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he, or isliye pipeline kaa upyog charan dhyaan nahin detaa
 Some instructions manipulate the program counter rather than output the result data directly; Such instructions are typically called "jumps" and facilitate program behavior such as loops, conditional program execution, and existence of functions
 kuch procesar main, kuch anya nirdesh ek " jhande" register main bits ke rajya badal jate hai
 These flags can be used to influence how a program behaves, as they often indicate the result of various actions
 udhaaharan ke liye, is tarah ke procesar main ek " kii tulana" anudesh do mulyon or set kaa moolyankan karata he yaa saaf karata he jhande main bits sanket miltaa he jo ek adhik se adhik yaa ki kya ve baraabar hai register; in jhandon se ek to ek baad main kud anudesh dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa kaarykram pravaah nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 The first step involves fetching, retrieving an instruction program from memory
 kaarykram kii smriti main shiksha kaa sthaan ek kaarykram counter he, jo ek sankhya he ki agle nirdesh kaa pataa pahachaanati dilvaaya ja dukaanon se nirdhaarit hota he
 After an instruction is fetched, the length of the PC instruction is increased so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in sequence
 aksar, kaudi hona karne ke liye anudesh apekshaakrit dhimi gati se smriti se praapt kiya jaataa he, jabaki shiksha ke liye intjaar kar laut ja stall karne ke liye sipiu ke kaaran
 This problem is largely addressed in modern processors by cache and pipeline architectures
 anudesh ki sipiu smriti se laana nirdhaarit karata he jo sipiu karnaa hoga
 The decode step, performed by an electro-circuit mechanism known as the education decoder, is an indication of learning that other parts of the CPU are switched into control
 raste main jo shiksha vyakhya kii he sipiu anudesh set vaastukala dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Often, a group of bits within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates that the operation is being performed, while the remaining fields usually provide the supplementary information needed for operations such as operands
 un oparend ek nirantar mulya ke rup main nirdisht kiya ja saktaa he, yaa ek mulya ke ek procesar register yaa smriti pataa ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki kuch sambodhit mod dwaara nirdhaarit ke sthaan ke rup main
 In some cpus the design instruction decoder is implemented as a mechanical, inductive circuit
 anya logon main, ek micro program sipiu vinyas sanketon ke set he ki kai ghadi daalon ke upar kramik rup se lagu kar rahe hai main die gaye nirdeshon kaa anuwaad karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 In some cases the memory that the micro program stores is rewritable making it possible to change the CPU instruction decode
 laane ke liye or samajhaana kadam ke baad, nishpadit kadam kiya jaataa he
 Depending on the CPU architecture, it may consist of a single action or a sequence of operations
 prayek kaary ke dauraan, sipiu ke vibhinn bhaagon to ve sab yaa aam taur par ek ghadi naadee ke jawaab main pradarshan kar sakate hai vaanchit oparation kaa hissaa he or phir karrwai puraa ho gaya he, vidyut jude hue hai
 Very often the result is written by subsequent instructions to an internal CPU register for quick access
 anya maamalon main parinaam dhimi he, lekin kam kharchila he or ucch kshamta ke mukhya smriti ke liye likhaa ja saktaa he
 For example, if an additional instruction is being executed, the arithmetic logic unit inputs are connected to a pair of operand formulas, the ALU is configured to perform an additional operation, so that the sum of its operand inputs is in its output Will appear, and the ALU output that the amount will receive is connected to the storage
 jab ghadi naadee hoti he, yoga bhandaaran karne ke liye sthanantarit kar diya jayega or, agar parinamswaroop yoga he bahut badi he, ek ankaganitiya overflo dhvaj sthapit kiya jayega
 In a cpu's power-circuit system, a set of mechanically basic functions can be performed, called an instruction set
 is tarah ke aapareshnon udhaaharan ke liye shaamil ho saktaa he, jodne yaa do number ghataakar do numberon kii tulana, yaa ek kaarykram ke ek alag hisse ke liye kud
 Each basic operation is represented by bits, a special combination known as machine language sessioncode; Executing the instructions given in a machine language program, the CPU decided to perform the "decoding" sessioncode by operation
 ek puri mashin bhashaa anudesh ek seshancode ke hote hai or kai maamalon main, atirikt bits ki oparation ke liye tark nirdisht 
 Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program that executes CPU is a collection of machine language instructions
 prayek shiksha ke liye vaastavik ganitiya aaparishan ankaganitiya tark ikai yaa ALU rup main janaa jaataa he sipiu procesar ke bheetar ek sangyojan tark circuit dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In general, a CPU executes an instruction by fetching it from memory, performing an action using its ALU, and then storing the result to memory
 aise sipiu chal bindu ikai dwaara kiya jaataa chal bindu sankhya par smriti or ise waapas bhandaaran, sanchaalan shakhaon main banty, or ganitiya kaary se data lod ke liye un logon ke rup main purnank ganit or tark sanchaalan, vibhinn anya mashin nirdesh maujuud hai, ke liye nirdesh 
 The cpu's control unit electro-circuit system uses electrical signals to carry out stored program instructions to direct the entire computer system
 niyantran ikai kaarykram nirdeshon par amal nahin karata he; darasal, yah pranali ke anya bhaagon kaa nirdesan aisa karne ke liye
 The control unit communicates with both ALU and memory
 ankaganitiya tark ikai procesar he ki purnank ganit or tark bitwiz sanchaalan karata he ke bheetar ek digital circuit he
 To operate on the information data words to the ALU, status information from previous operations, and indicating which are a code from the control unit to perform the action
 anudesh nishpadit kiya ja rahaa he par nirbhar karata he, oparend aantarik sipiu register yaa bahya smriti se aa sakati he, yaa ve ALU khud ke dwaara utpann sthiraank ho saktaa he
 When all input signals are settled and propagated through the ALU electro-circuit mechanism, the result of the operation of the display appears on the output of the ALU

 Most high-end microprocessors are a memory management unit, providing translation memory protection and paging capabilities useful for virtual memory, translating logical addresses into physical RAM addresses
 saral procesar, vishesh rup se microcontrolar aamtaur par ek MMU shaamil nahin hai
 Each CPU represents numeric values in a specific way
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch jaldi digital computer sankhya ke rup main parichit dashamalav ank pranali mulyon kaa pratinidhitiv kiya, or dusron ko is tarah ke trigut ke rup main adhik asaamaanya abhyavedan karyrat he
 Nearly all modern cpus represent numbers such as binary, such as a "high" or "low" voltage, with each digit being represented by some two significant physical quantities
 sankhyatmak pratinidhitiv karne ke liye sambandhit aakaar or purnank sankhya he ki ek sipiu kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai ki sateek he
 In the case of a binary CPU, this is measured by the number of bits that the CPU can process in an operation, which is usually called "word size", "bit width", "data, path width", " Integer precision ", or" integer size "
 ek sipiu ke purnank aakaar nirdhaarit purnank kii seemaa mulyon yah sidhe par kaam kar sakate hai
 For example, an 8-bit CPU can directly manipulate integers represented by eight bits, which is a series of 256 discrete integer values
 purnank range bhi smriti sthanon sipiu sidhe sambodhit kar sakate hai ki sankhya ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 For example, if a binary CPU uses 32 bits to represent a memory address then it can directly address 2 ^ 32 memory locations
 is seemaa ko naakaam karne ke liye or vibhinn anya kaarnon ke liye, kuch sipiu upyog tantra he ki atirikt smriti kii anumati dene ko sambodhit karne kii
 cpus with larger word sizes require more electrical circuit systems and, consequently, are physically larger, cost more, and consume more power
 natijatan, chote 4 yaa 8 bit microcontrolar saamanytah aadhunik anuprayogon main istemaal kiya jaataa he, bhale hi bahut bada shabd aakaar ke saath sipiu uplabdh hai
 When higher performance is required, however, the benefits of a larger word size may outweigh the disadvantages
 ek sipiu aantarik data raaston shabd aakaar kii tulana main kam aakaar or laagat kam karne ke liye ho saktaa he
 For example, even though the IBM System / 360 instruction set was a 32-bit instruction set, the System / 360 Model 30 and Model 40 arithmetic logical unit had 8 bit data paths, so that the four required to add a 32-bit was Cycles, one for each 8 bit from the operand, and, even though the Motorola 68X instruction set was a 32-bit instruction set, the Motorola 68000 and the Motorola 68010, the math logical unit had 16-bit data paths then a 32-bit two cycles
 Add the required
 phaayde ke donon kam or ucch bit lambaai dwaara bardaasht ke kuch hasil karne ke liye, kai nirdesh set purnank or chal bindu data ke liye alag sa chaudaai, ki shiksha divaais ke vibhinn bhaagon ke liye alag sa chaudaai karne ke liye set ko lagu karne sipiu kii ijaajat di he
 For example, the IBM System / 360 instruction set was primarily 32 bit, but supported 64-bit floating point values to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating point numbers
 system / 360 model 65 dashamalav or achal bindu dwiadhari ankaganitiya ke liye ek 8 bit yojak or chal bindu ganit ke liye ek 60-bit yojak tha
 Many later CPU designs use the same mixed bit width, especially when the processor is for general purpose use where a proper balance of integer and floating point capability is required
 adhikansh sipiu tulykaalik circuit, jo ve ek ghadi sanket rojgaar unki anukramik sanchaalan gati kaa matlab kar rahe hai
 The clock signal is produced by an external oscillator circuit that produces a number of pulses corresponding to each other in the form of a periodic square wave
 ghadi daalon kii aavriti dar he jis par ek sipiu nirdesh nishpadit or iske parinamswaroop, teji se ghadi, or adhik nirdesh sipiu ek duusare par amal karenge nirdhaarit karata he
 In order to ensure proper operation of the CPU, the maximum time required for all signals to propagate the CPU through the clock period is greater
 acchhee tarah se upar sabase zyada maamle prachaar main deree ek mulya ke liye ghadi kii avadhi sthapit karne main, yah puri tarah se sipiu or uske chaaron ore badhati he or girane ghadi sanket ke "kinaaron " data chaalen dizin karne ke liye sambhav he
 This has the advantage of significantly simplifying the CPU, both from a design perspective and from a component count perspective
 haalanki, yah bhi nuksaan yah he ki puure sipiu apni dhimi tatwon par intjaar karnaa hoga vahan karti he, bhale hi iske bare main kuch bhaagon main bahut teji se kar rahe hai
 This limit has largely been compensated for by various methods of increased CPU parity haalanki, vaastu sudhaar akele vishwa str par tulykaalik CPU kii kamiyon ke sabhi kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 For example, a clock signal is subject to a delay of another electrical signal
 teji se jatil sipiu main ucch ghadi daron ise or adhik kathin puri unit bhar charan main ghadi sanket rakhane ke liye banaate hai
 This has led many modern cpus to require multiple identical clock signals that a single signal be provided to avoid enough delays to cause CPU malfunctions
 ek anya pramukh mudda he, ghadi daron naatakeey rup se vruddhi ke rup main, garmi kii raashi he ki sipiu dwaara chhitaraya hua he
 The continuously changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time
 saamaanya taur par, ek ghatak he ki switch kar rahaa he ek sthir rajya main ek tatv kii tulana main adhik urja kaa upyog karata he
 Therefore, the clock rate increases, so that the energy consumes, due to the CPU needing more heat dissipation as the CPU cools
 anaavashyak ghatakon kii swimming ke saath kaam karne kii ek vidhi ghadi gat he, jo anaavashyak ghatakon ke liye ghadi sanket band mode shaamil he kaha jaataa he
 However, this time is considered difficult to implement and therefore very little power is not seen in common use outside of design
 ek ullekhneey haal sipiu dizin vyapak ghadi gat kaa upyog karata he ki ibiem pover pi si aadhaarit xinan exbox 360 main prayog kiya jaataa he ; is tarah, exbox 360 kii bijli kii aavashyaktaaon ko bahut kam ho jaataa he
 Another way to address some of the problems with a global clock signal is to remove the clock signal altogether
 jabaki vaishvik ghadi sanket hataane kai myanon main dizin kii prakriya main kaaphi adhik jatil bana detaa he, atulykaalik dizin samaan tulykaalik dizin ke saath tulana main bijli kii khapat or garmi lanpatata main laabh chihnit le
 While somewhat unusual, the entire asynchronous CPU is built without the use of a global clock signal
 is ke do ullekhneey udhaaharan earem se shikaayat taabeej or maips r3000 sangat mini maips hai
 Rather than completely removing the clock signal, some CPU designs may have asynchronous portions of the device, using asynchronous alus in conjunction with such supper scalar pipelining to achieve some math performance gains
 Allow in form
 haalanki yah puri tarah spasht nahin he ki puri tarah se atulykaalik dizin unke tulykaalik samakakshon kii tulana main ek tulaneey yaa behatar str par pradarshan kar sakate hai nahin he, yah he ki ve kam se kam saral ganit sanchaalan main utkrushtataa praapt kar spasht he
 This, combined with their excellent power consumption and heat dissipation properties, makes them very suitable for embedded computers
 ek sipiu pichley anubhag main kii peshkash kii buniyadi aaparishan kaa vivaran saralatam rup he ki ek sipiu le ja sakate hai varnan karata he
 This type of CPU, usually referred to as sub-scalar, operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time, that is at least one instruction per clock cycle
 is prakriya uchhadish sipiu main ek antarnihit aakshamata ko janm detaa he
 Since only one instruction is executed at a time, the entire CPU will have to wait for that instruction to complete before proceeding to the next instruction
 natijatan, uchhadish sipiu nirdesh jo nishpaadan puraa karne ke liye ek se adhik ghadi chakra lene par " lataka " ho jaataa he
 Even adding a second execution unit does not improve performance much; Instead of one path being hung, two paths are now kept and the number of unused transistors has increased
 is dizin, jisamen sipiu ke nishpaadan sansadhano ek samay main keval ek nirdesh par kaam kar sakate hai, keval sambhawatah adish pradarshan pahunch sakate hai
 However, performance is almost always suboptimal
 prayaas adish or behatar pradarshan ko praapt karne ke dizin ke tareeke he ki CPU kam raikhik vyavhaar karte hai or samanaantar main or adhik karne ke liye paidaa kii ek kism main hui he
 When referring to similarities in cpus, two terms are typically used to classify these design techniques: prayek paddati donon tareeke jisamen ve lagu kar rahe hai, saath hi rishtedaar prabhaavashiltaa ve ek aavedan ke liye CPU ke pradarshan ko badhaane main kharch main alag he
 Depending on the performance or speed of a processor, among many other factors, there are clock rates and instructions per clock, which together are factors of instruction per second that the CPU can perform
 kai soochna di ipies mulyon kuch shakhaon ke saath kritrim anudesh drishyon par "peak" nishpaadan daron kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he, jabaki yathartwaadee varchlod nirdesh or anuprayogon, jinamein se kuch main lanbaa samay lag dusron kii tulana main nishpadit karne ke liye kii ek mishran se milakar banataa he
 Memory hierarchy performance also greatly affects processor performance, an issue rarely considered in MIPS calculation

 The processing performance of the computer is increased by using multi-core processors, which is essentially two or more individual processor plugs in an integrated circuit
 adarsh rup main, ek dohare kor procesar lagbhag do baar ke rup main ek single kor procesar ke rup main shaktishaalee hoga
 In practice, the performance gain so far is due to small, incomplete software algorithms and implementations, only about 50%
 ek procesar main kor kii sankhya badhaane se kaam kaa boj he ki niyantrit kiya ja saktaa bad jaati he
 This means that the processor can now handle many asynchronous events, interrupts, etc
 when overwhelmed which can take a toll on the CPU
 in kor har manzil ek alag kaam sanbhaalane ke saath, ek prasanskaran sanyantr ke rup main alag-alag manjilon ke bare main sochaa ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, these cores will handle the same tasks as adjacent cores if a single core is not sufficient to handle the information

 As a response, some cpus implement additional hardware logic that monitors the actual usage of different parts of a CPU and provides various counters accessible to the software; An example is Intel's performance counter monitor technology

 Prem does not want to break his brother's heart
 viki apni purv premika ke liye bahut lambey samay se dukhi rahaa he
 Prem no longer wants to get in her way
 vah sapana ko bataata he ki vah usko sirf bevakoof bana rahaa tha
 After breaking her heart, Sapna comes under pressure from her maternal uncle and uncle and agrees to marry Vicky
 haalanki, viki shaadi se pehle sachai jaan jaataa he
 Finally Sapna and Prem meet again

 Thermal efficiency is used to measure the efficiency of devices using thermal energy
 duusare shabdo main kaha ja saktaa he ki upkaran main urja kaa sthaanantaran kitni acchhee tarah se kiya ja paa rahaa he, isaki maap uski dakshata ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Generally, in the context of any body, the ratio of useful output energy and input energy is called energy efficiency
 jab ooshmiya urja kii baat karte hai tab kisi yukti ko di gayi ooshmiya urja yaa us yukti dwaara khapat kii gayi kul urja q i n { \ displaystyle Q_{in}} uskaa input hota he jabaki vaanchit output, us yukti dwaara kiya gaya yantric kaary w o u t { \ displaystyle W_{out}}, yaa q o u t { \ displaystyle Q_{out}}, yaa donon hote hai
 We know that energy is not available in the same way, it has some financial value, so the general definition of thermal efficiency is as follows- ooshmaagatiki ke pratham niyam ke anusaar, output urja kabhi bhi input urja se adhik nahin ho sakati
 Therefore saamaanya rup se kisi upkaran main urja kii khapat kaa anupaat uske dwaara utpaadit bal kii tulana main kitna he isko is tarah se samajha ja saktaa he ki kisi antardahan ingine main eendhan jalataa he to usase na keval jenerator chal kar bijli banati he balki is prakriya main ingine chalaane ke liye indhan ko jalaayaa jaataa he jisase ingine chalen ke saath jo garmi paidaa hoti he vah bhi uske ek utpaada ke rup main utpann hoti he, yah garmi jitani adhik hogi utana hi bijli banane kii kshamta ko kam karegi

 The auxiliary language Interlingua has no regulating body, as its vocabulary, grammar, and orthography are viewed as a product of ongoing social forces
 In theory, Interlingua therefore evolves independent from any human regulator
 Interlingua's vocabulary is verified and recorded by dynamically applying certain general principles to an existing set of natural languages and their etymologies
 Languages such as Esperanto and Ido have been constructed by a person or small group, before being adopted and developed by communities of users
 Bodies such as the Akademio de Esperanto look at questions of usage in the light of the original goals and principles of the language
 Whereas a number of the puristically motivated language societies have assumed de facto responsibility for language cultivation, the decisions of the academies have often had the force of law
 


 Since academies are so closely associated with the notion of purism, a brief word on their history may not be out of place
 The first academy to deal expressly and specifically with language matters was the Accademia della Crusca, 


 Its orientation was essentially conservative, favoring a return to the Tuscan language as cultivated in the fourteenth century over the innovations of contemporary renaissance poets like Torquato Tasso
 


 One of its first tasks - as with so many academies to follow - was to produce a large-scale prescriptive dictionary of Italian kisaan kanya bharat kii pehali swadesh nirmit rangeen film thi Intercity Express 9303 is a mail express train operated by Indian Railways
