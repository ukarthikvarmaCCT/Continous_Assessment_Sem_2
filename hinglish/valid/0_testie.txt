 His mind was always thinking about the bad condition of his society by the British rulers
 unhone munda logon ko angrejon se mukti paane ke liye apana netritv pradaan kiya
 The failure of the monsoon in Chhotanagpur in 1894 caused severe famine and epidemics
 birsa ne puure manoyog se apane logon kii seva kii
 On 1 October 1894, as a young leader, he gathered all the Mundas and started a movement for forgiveness of rent from the British
 1895 main unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or hazaribagh kendriya karagaar main do saal ke karawas kii sajaa di gayi
 But Birsa and his disciples were determined to help the famine-stricken people of the area and got the status of a great man in his lifetime
 unhen us ilaake ke log "dharti baba" ke naam se pukaara or puja jaataa tha
 After the increase of their influence, the consciousness of the whole region being organized among the Mundas awakened
 1897 se 1900 ke bich mundaaon or angrej sipaahiyon ke bich yuddh hote rahe or birsa or uske chaahane vaale logon ne angrejon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha

 Later, some of Birsa's disciples were arrested

 Kanhaiyalal Mishra 'prabhakar' was a Hindi storyteller, essayist, journalist and freedom fighter
 shri kanhaiyalaal mishra kaa janm uttar pradesh ke saharanpur jile ke devband gram main hua tha
 Padmashri Kanhaiya Lal Mishra 'prabhakar', who applied tilak of sandalwood words on the forehead of Hindi literature and Hindi journalism, definitely had the proven salt of a tantric-yogi
 tabhi to saadhaaran bol-chaal ke shabdon main us adbhut namak se ve aisa swaad paidaa kar dete ki pathak kii ankhen or man kumbh main gangasnan ke baad gangaghat par baith prasad grahan karne kaa sukh pate
 As a matter of fact, Prabhakar ji used to write life - sometimes in the name of essay, sometimes short story and sometimes in the name of foreword
 or likhte bhi kahaan the ! sidhe jaadu tona karte the - vichaaron par, jivan style par
 His literature arose from life and distributed life
 ek baangi prastut he - Patna's railway station
 jivan se tang aaye ek sajjan railgadee se cat kar mar jane ke liye stesan par tahal rahe hai
 The train is late
 pataa nahin kya soch kar saamne book stall se jeb main padi aakhri athnni dekar ’nayaa jivan’ patr kharid lete hai
 Prabhakar ji's article 'live slowly' as if he was looking for him
 padhate hi unki duniya badal jaati he
 His car returns to the track of hope and excitement
 ve ghar laut padate hai - safalataa ke shikhar chune kaa sankalp lekar
 This was the effect of the words derived from the writing of 'prabhakar'
 lekhan ’prabhakar’ ji ke liye lok ranjan kaa madhyam nahin tha
 He used to write - to develop the qualities of citizenship! He used to say - "it is not our job that we keep a barrage of amusing literature open all the time to spend a lot of time and peace in the vast country
 hamaara kaam to yah he ki is vishaal or mahaan desh ke kone-kone main faile jan saadhaaran ke man main vishrankhlit vartmaan ke prati vidroh or bhavy bhavishya ke nirmaan kii shramshil bhukh jagaayen
 " aise udaatt adarsh ko saamne rakh kar sahitya rachane vaale sahityakar kii kalam oche samjhaute nahin kar sakati
 He has to sharpen and sharpen his pen even while hanging on the cross - and Prabhakar ji did it as well
 unhone apni mishanri patrakarita ke bare main badi maarmik baat kahi he - "yah anaruke charan, anbujhe deep, anjhuke lalaat or anathke shiv sankalp kaa sangharsh tha
 " lekhak kii bhoomika ke prati unka daayitvabodh kitna gaharaa tha iskaa ek udhaaharan dekhiye
 On one occasion, Nehru asked him - "prabhakar, what are you doing these days?" He said - "I am working after you and myself
 " jab nehru ji ne chaunk kar poocha - "kya matlab hua iskaa ? " to prabhakar ji ne jawaab diya - "pandit ji, aaj desh kii shakti pul, baandh, kaarkaane or oonchi - oonchi imaaraten banane main lagi he
 Brick and lime are getting higher and man is becoming inferior
 bhavishya main aisa samay avashya aayegaa, jab desh kaa netritv oonche manushyon ke nirmaan main shakti lagaayegaa
 Then i am writing in writing the literature that will be required
 "vastutah sahitya ke madhyam se prabhakar ji gunon kii kheti karnaa chaahate the or apni pustakon ko shiksha ke khet maanate the jinamein jivan kaa paathyakram tha
 He considered his essays to be a journey of thought and said - "it is not the hymns, but the call of Sanmitra, who taps the reader's shoulder and leads him on the path of contemplation
" " He made literature and journalism for the upliftment of the individual and society
 har sansmaran, har niabandh is utthan yajna main samidha he, isaliye ek shabd bhi jaaya nahin hona chaiye, kamjor yaa phaltu na ho
 His journalism and literature are basically the writings of social concerns
 vahaan rayeesi ke antahpur main yaa manoranjan ke chauraahey par kisi rakkasa kaa naach - gaanaa nahin he, vahaan to aathon pahar aadmi ko badalane kii krantikari yojana he
 If there is dance, then it is orgy - against the frivolous mentality! If there is a song there is an anthem of high value hymns
 prabhakar ji ne magini kaa yah vaakya padhaa tha - "gulam desh main bina boye, bina seenche dosha kii kheti hoti he
 "that is when he pledged to create the ideal person and the literature that creates society
 unki yah yojana is prakaar puri hui - "zindagi muskuraai", "baaje paayaliya ke ghunghru", zindagi lahalhai" - ’ek anushaasit vyakti ke nirmaan kii pustaken
 a book called "mahake Aangan - Chahke Dwar" connecting the person with the family, a book connecting this family joint person with the nation - "deep jale-shankh pm"
 antatah is raashtra-sanyukt vyakti ko vishwa naagarik banane vaali pustak "maati ho gai sona"
 The ideals of which Prabhakar ji was blowing the conch, he himself adopted those ideals in his life
 29 may 1906 ko devband main janme brahman sanskari balak kanhaiya ne paanch varsh kii aayu main hi andh-vishwaas or roodhiwaadita kaa virodh karnaa aarambh kar diya tha
 Quitting studies at a young age, devoted himself to the freedom struggle and to the reform movements
 jail yatraaen or videshi shashan ke haathon yatnaaen sahin
 His book "padayatri on the hot trails" is an account of all this
 unki nirmam or yojanapurna dhang se pitayee kii gai taaki ve patrakarita ke yogya na rahen, kintu dekhiye, angrezi shashan kaa surya bharat main ast hua 15 agast 1947 ko or thik usee din prabhakar ji dwaara sampadit patr "vikaas" kaa punarjagran hua
 The tyrannical loser, the revolutionary won
 jivan sambandhi aankadon main jinaki ruchi he unke liye yahaan ullekh kar duun ki ve 1906 main devband, saharanpur main janme
 Edited "vikas", "gyanodaya" and "new Life"
 kavi, nibandhkaar, reportaz lekhak, laghukatha lekhak, sansmaran lekhak, patrkaar, jeevani lekhak ke rup main dheron pustaken likhin
 Wrote and wrote articles and commentaries on national questions, on social situations - several thousand letters! He was honored with the Padma Shri in 1990 by the President of India
 dheron sammaan or puraskaar un par barase
 His literature was researched in various universities
 9 may 1995 ko unka nidhan hua
 These things are only the outward lines of the life, which has enhanced the art of finding the path between the stubborn lines of the society
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki unka sahitya maatr do pratishat buddhijivi varg ke liye nahin he, vah to sabake jivan ko chune vaali mand samir he
 It was necessary for the literature surgeon with such inspiration that such a style is for everyone
 prabhakar ji kehete hai - "ek prashn mere man main ubhara
 Can there not be such a style of writing in which there are waves, there must also be plushness, flow, balance and beauty and depth
 maine sochaa - mai us style main likhuunga, jisamen yah sab ho
 In short, the knowledge should be of the Upanishads, the expression of the lullabies
 " prabhakar ji kii bhashaa or style ne pathak ke man ke bheetar jane kaa maarg khoj liya tha
 Someone said - his style has the scent of teal rose and the smoothness of Jaunpuri perfume
 unhen saharanpur kaa banbhatta bhi kaha gaya or hindi kaa khalil jibran bhi
 The adornment of words by coming to the tip of their pen would have rejuvenated the words
 unke vaakya choote hai, gudgudate hai, daantate hai, puchkaarte hai, kaan bhi umeth dete hai or kabhi lagata he ki jaise haule se mithai kaa tukdaa munh main rakh gaya koi vaakya
 Pay their sentences! Somebody is advising an old sentence like Grandpa, while somewhere a father-like sentence is worrying, somewhere a young man is taking fun-filled life to roam the lush life on a lake, and somewhere a teacher is teaching a sentence policy
 kahin koi vaakya naagarikta kaa savaiya ga rahaa he
 The words are the same - colloquially, but Prabhakar's pen has not touched that the horoscope of words changes as if Raja Yoga has sat down
 aadarshon kaa sahitya rachane vaale prabhakar ji eemaandaar lekhak the
 He has clearly stated - "I am a friend of all in my literature, but in journalism i have not become a friend of anyone - yes, not even an enemy! His journalism is neither entangled in parties, nor among individuals
" jo samaaj ke liye upyogi, uski saraahna or jo hanikaarak, uski aalochana
 He did not make his journalism the bard, supporter or adversary of politics, but "politics to advise and lead"
 isi liye, congress main rah kar azaadi kii ladaai ladane, jail jane or laathiyaan khaane ke baavjood desh azaad hone ke agle din unhone congress se tyaagptr de diya
 This was a true simulation of Gandhism
 vishesh taur par ullekhneey he ki ve reportaz vidha ke janak maane jate hai
 Today, in the telecast era of live telecast, their reports are remembered more
 jo drishy unhone khinche hai unka live telecast prabhakar ji ke shabdon main he
 How many congressional conventions saw the live telecast, live telecast of priceless scenes of the freedom struggle is safe in their reports
 unke likhe sansmaranon main kitni preranaaspad jivaniyon or balidanon ke abhilekh saras bhashaa main itihaas ke liye surakshit kar diye gayi hai or nibandhon main vyakti, parivaar, raashtra or vishwa ke liye aadarshon ke deepak path ke donon ore jala diye gayi hai, taaki raushnee hameshaa uplabdh rahe
 For this reason, they have remained dear to their generation and revered to the new generation

 Such changes are done by the Parliament of India
 inhen sansad ke prayek sadan se paryaapt bahumat ke dwaara anumodan praapt hona chahie or vishisht sanshodhano ko rajyon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 The details of this procedure are given in article 368, Part XX of the Constitution
 in niyamon ke baavjood 1950 main samvidhan ke lagu hone ke baad se is main 101 sanshodhan kiye ja chuke hai
 Controversially, according to the Supreme Court of India, it is not possible to allow every amendment to be made in the Constitution
 ek sanshodhan is prakaar hona chahie kii yah samvidhan kii "mul saranchana" kaa sammaan kare, jo ki aparivartaneey he
 The proposal for an amendment begins in Parliament where it is introduced as a bill
 iske baad ise sansad ke prayek sadan ke dwaara anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 In each House it should get a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting and a simple majority of all members
 iske baad vishisht sanshodhano ko kam se kam aadhe rajyon kii vidhayikaon ke dwaara bhi anumodith kiya janaa chahie
 Once all other stages are completed, the approval of the President of India is obtained for amendment, but this final phase is only a formality
 samvidhan paryaapt bahumat kii aavashyaktaa ke baavjood, yah duniya main sabase zyada baar sanshodhit kiya jane vaala prashaasak dastavej he; har saal main ausatan do sanshodhan kiye jate hai
 This is partly due to the length and breadth of the constitution
 It is the longest constitution in any of the world than a sovereign nation, with 395 articles and 117000 words
 yah dastavej sarkaar kii shaktiyon ko atyadhik vishisht rup se varnit karata he or isiilie sanshodhano ke liye aksar un maamalon ke saath deal kiya jaataa he, jinhen anya deshon main saamaanya darja diya jaataa he
 The second reason for this is that the Parliament of India is elected by a seat in the district, for this the plurality system used in the United States and the United Nations is used
 iskaa arth yah he ki empi ke samooh ke liye yah sambhav he ki ve do tihaai matdaan hasil kiye bina sansad main do tihaai siten jeet sakate hai

 prayek sanshodhan ko aamtaur par lambaa sheershak diya jaataa he "ek adhinium jo bharat ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karata he"
 The first constitutional amendment was made by the Supreme Court of India in 1967, in the case of Golak Nath Vs State of Punjab

 The most important reason for amending the constitution is the deduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
 ise samvidhan kii anusuchee 9 main moulik adhikaron ke praavdhaan ke vipareet kanoon banaakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Schedule 9 protects these laws by keeping such laws open only to limited judicial review
 pratibandh ke praroopik kshetron main sampatti ke adhikaron se sambandhit kanoon shaamil hai, isamen alpsankhyak samoohon jaise "anusuchit jati", "anusuchit janajati" or anya "pichde varg" ke paksh main sakaaratmak karrwai ko bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he
 In a landmark judgment in January 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed that all laws would be open to judicial review if they violated the basic structure of the Constitution
 mukhya nyaayadhish yogesh kumaar sabharwal ne kaha "yadi anusuchee 9 main die gaye kanoon mul adhikaron kaa sankshipteekaran karte hai, yaa unhen radd karte hai to iske parinamswaroop samvidhan kii mul saranchana main ulanghan hoga, aise kanoonon ko avaidh qaraar dena chahie

 Most authors and thinkers also agree that ethics is primarily concerned with norms and values, not the study or discovery of objects and these criteria should be used not only in the analysis of personal life but in the analysis of social life
 i also
 acha or bura, sahi or galat, gun or dosha, nyaay or jurm jaisi avadharanaon ko paribhaashit karke, nitishastra maanviya naitikta ke prashnon ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karata hai
 As a field of intellectual review, he also deals with the areas of moral philosophy, descriptive ethics, and value theory
 nitishastra main abhyaas ke teen pramukh kshetra jinhen manyata praapt hai: In this, the party works according to whatever advice is given to the lawyer and his party
 rashaworth keader kehete hai ki ""nitishastra" kii maanak paribhaashaon main 'adarsh maanav charitra kaa vigyaan' yaa 'naitik kartavya kaa vigyaan' jaise vaakyansh aam taur par shaamil rahe hai
 "ethics are a set of concepts and principles that, as Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define, guide us in determining what behavioral sensitivities help or cause harm"
 cambridge dictionari of philocyphi yah kahati hai ki nitishastra shabd kaa "upyog saamanytah vinemian rup se 'naitikta' ke saath hota hai' or kabhi-kabhi kisi vishesh parampara, samooh yaa vyakti ke naitik siddhanton ke arth hetu iskaa adhik sankeern upyog hota hai"
 Paul and Elder say that most people get confused between social practices, religious beliefs, and behavior, and ethics, and do not consider ethics alone as a concept
 "nitishastra" shabd ke kai arth hote hai
 This can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy
 manushya ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan anek shastron main anek drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Human behavior, like nature's trades, occurs in the form of a work-cause-chain and can be studied and interpreted causally
 manovigyaan yahi karata he
 But we do not characterize natural trades as good or bad
 raste main achaanak varsha aa jane se bhigane par ham badalon ko kuvachy nahin kehane lagate
 On the contrary, on the actions of fellow human beings, we pass judgment of good and bad
 is prakaar nirnay dene kii saarvbhaum maanviya pravriti hi achaardarshan kii janani he
 In ethics, we think systematically and try to know what is the wise basis of our good and evil decisions
 kaha jaataa he, achaarshastra niamak athwa aadarshanveshi vigyaan he, jabaki manovigyaan yatharthanveshi shaastra he
 Certainly there is some fact in this classification of scriptures, but it can also be misleading
 ukt vargeekaran yah dharna utpann kar saktaa he ki achaardarshan kaa kaam naitik vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa anveshan tathaa udghaatan nahin he, apitu kritrim dhang se vaise niyamon ko maanav samaaj par lad dena he
 But this assumption is wrong
 nitishastra jin naitik niyamon kii khoj karata he ve swayan manushya kii mul chetana main nihit hai
 Of course, this consciousness is seen taking different forms in different societies and ages
 is anekarupata kaa pradhan kaaran maanav prakruti kii jatilta tathaa maanviya shrey kii vividhrupatha he
 The thinkers of different countries explore the moral standards inherent in the prevailing laws of their societies
 hamaare apane yug main hi, anek nai puraani samskritiyon ke sammilan ke kaaran, vichaarkon ke liye yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki ve anginat roodhiyon tathaa saapekshya manyataon se upar uthakar vastut: saarvbhaum naitik siddhanton ke udghaatan kii ore agrasar hon
 Meta-ethics asks how we understand this, how we know about it and what it means when we talk of 'what is right' and 'what is wrong'
 yah man main chal rahi ulajhanon kaa ek sakaaratmak nichod he
 Critical ethics is the study of ethics
 yah nitishastra kii vah shakha hai, jo un prashnon ke sammuchay kii jaanch karti hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik rup se kisi ko kaise kaam karnaa chaiye
 Critical ethics differs from meta-ethics in that it examines the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 paramparaagat, mandandak nitishastra is baat kaa adhyayan tha ki vah kya hai jo kisi kriya ko kya sahi yaa galat banaata hai
 These principles provide broad moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 maanav kaa sadaiv se ek pramukh drushtikon upyogetavaad rahaa he
 This ideology reflects that aspect of human behavior, which states that ==naitik darshan== manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain Political ethics is the practice of making ethical ethical decisions about political action and political agents
 varnatmak nitishastra varnapat ke darshanik chor kii ore kam jhukta he kyonki uskaa uddeshy hai kaise log jite hai is bare main khaas jaankaree praapt karnaa or drusht pratimaanon ke aadhaar par saamaanya nishkarsh nikaalnaa
 In relation to what is the basic question of ethics, two important opinions are found
 ek mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kii pradhan samasya yah batalaana he ki maanav jivan kaa param shrey kya he
 On realizing the ultimate credit, we will say auspicious actions to those who are going to take that credit; Opposite actions will be called inauspicious
 duusare mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kaa pradhan kaary shubh yaa dharmasammat kii dharna ko spasht karnaa he
 In other words, the function of ethics is to clarify the form of a rule or rule according to which rituals are performed as auspicious or religious
 e do mantavya do bhinn kotiyon kii vichaarpaddatiyon ko janm dete hai
 The ultimate credit has been conceived in many ways; We will describe these fantasies or theories further
 yahan ham sankshep main yah vimarsh karenge ki naitikta ke niyam-yadi vaise koi niyam hote hai to-kis koti ke ho sakate hai
 The notion of a rule or law comes either from the penal law of the state or from the physical sciences, where the laws of nature are cited
 rajya ke kanoon ek prakaar ke shaskaon kii newnaadhik niyantrit ichha dwaara nirmit hote hai
 They are sometimes made for the benefit of some classes, they can be broken and some people may be harmed by their adherence
 iske vipareet prakruti ke niyam akhandaneey hote hai
 State laws are subject to change, but laws of nature are immutable
 niti yaa sadachaar ke niyam aparivartaneey, paalankarta ke liye kalyankar evam akhandaneey samajhe jate hai
 In these respects the rules of ethics are completely similar to the laws of health science
 aisa jaan padataa he ki manushya athwa maanav prakruti do bhinn kotiyon ke niyamon ke niyantran main vyaprut hoti he
 On the one hand, human beings are subject to laws which are inaugurated or represented in the physical sciences, chemistry, science, psychology, psychology etc
 and on the other hand the rules of ideal sciences, such as health science, logic, etc
, which they are not bound by, but which are followed It is necessary for its happiness and progress
 nitishastra ke niyam is duusari koti ke hote hai
 Following are the major problems of ethics- nitishastra kii samasyaon ko ham teen virgon main baant sakate hai : Many imaginations have been made in the East and West about the ultimate credit
 bharat main praaia: sabhi darshan yah maanate hai ki jivan kaa charam lakshya sukh he, kintu unamem se adhikansh kii sukh sambandhi dharna tathakthith saukhyavaad se nitant bhinn he
 In this second or prevailing sense, we can only call the Charvak philosophy a Soukhvadi
 charvak ke naitik mantavyon kaa koi vyavasthit varnan uplabdh nahin he, kintu yah samajha jaataa he ki uske saukhyavaad main sthool andriya sukh ko hi mahatv diya gaya he
 Other philosophies of India, the ultimate happiness which is called the goal of life, have been equated with class, liberation or salvation or nirvana
 nyaay tathaa sankhya darshanon main apvarg yaa mukti kii kalpana kii gai he, use bhavatmak sukhrup nahin kaha ja saktaa kintu upanishdon tathaa vedant kii muktavastha aanandarup kahi ja sakati he
 Both the liberation of Vedanta and the nirvana of Buddhists are indicative of the situation when the soul of a person goes beyond the duality of happiness, sorrow etc
 yah sthiti jeevankaal main bhi aa sakati he; bhagavadgita main sthitprajna kaha gaya he vah ek prakaar se jivanmukt hi kaha ja saktaa he
 In Western philosophies, many opinions regarding the ultimate credit are found: hamaare param shrey athwa shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa saadhan yaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhi vibhinn matvaad hai
 In the opinion of most suffragists, the perception of good and evil is through wisdom
 hegel, breadle aadi kaa mat yahi he or kaant kaa mantavya bhi iskaa virdohi nahin he
 Kant believes that ultimately our sense of action is the source of moral ideals
 anubhavvaadiyon ke anusaar hamaare shubh ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot anubhav hi he
 This view gives rise to moral ambiguity
 teesraa mat pratibhaanvaad athwa apyajhhvjj ) he
 According to this view, there is such a power within us that we know or know the auspicious inauspicious way
 pratibhaanvaad ke anek rup hai
 The British philosophers named Shaftesbury and Hutcheson thought that just like the senses accepting Roopa Rasa etc
, we also have a moral sense in us that directly sees good and evil
 bishap butler naam ke vichaarak ke mat main hamaare andar sadasadbuddhi naam kii ek prerak vritti hoti he jo swaarth tathaa pararth ke bich uthanevaale dwandv kaa samaadhaan karti hui hamen auchity kaa maarg dikhalaataa he
 There are many motivational circles of our conduct; One instinct is self-love, the other is self-interest
