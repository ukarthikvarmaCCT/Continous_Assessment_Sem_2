 Demographic analysis can be applied to whole societies or to groups divided by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity
 shikshan kshetra main, janasankhyikee ko aksar samajashaastra, arthshaastra athwa maanav-vigyaan kii ek shakha ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The goal of the study of formal demographics is limited to the measurement of population processes, while social demography analyzes the relationship between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes affecting a population, a more broad field of population studies
 janankiki shabd ko aksar galati se janasankhyikee ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin yah kisi khaas jan samudaay kii visheshtaon ko nirdisht karata he, jiskaa prayog sarkari, vipanan yaa abhimath anusandhan main yaa aise anusandhanon main istemaal janasankhyikeey profil main hota he
 There are two methods of data collection: direct and indirect
 Direct data comes from important registered data that recovers all births and deaths, as well as some specific changes in legal status, such as marriage, divorce, and migration
 In developed countries with better registration systems, registration statistics are the best way to estimate the number of births and deaths
 janasankhyikeey aankade ekatrit karne kii ek anya pratyaksh aam vidhi he janaganana
 ek janaganana aam taur par rashtriya sarkaar dwaara yojit kii jaati he or desh ke har vyakti ko ginaney kaa prayaas karti he
 However, unlike critical statistics data, which are usually collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, the census typically occurs only every 10 years and thus generally for birth and death statistics Are not the best source
 vishleshanon ko ek janaganana ke baad yah anumaan lagane ke liye yojit kiya jaataa he ki adhik gananaa yaa alp gananaa kitni hui he
 Apart from just counting people in the census, a lot happens
 ve aam taur par pariwaron yaa gharon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karne ke saath-saath, vyaktigat visheshtaon jaise umr, ling, vaivaahik sthiti, sakshartaa / shiksha, rojgaar sthiti or vyavsaay or bhugolic avasthiti se sambandhit jaankaree ikattha karte hai
 They can also collect statistics on migration, language, religion, nationality and citizenship
 un deshon main, jahaan mahatvapurn panjikaran pranali adhuri ho, janaganana kaa istemaal, mrityu dar or prajnan kshamta ke bare main jaankaree ke pratyaksh strot ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye janavaadee china ganraajya kii janaganana, aise janmon or mrityu kii jaankaree ekatra karti he, jo janaganana ke thik pehle 18 maheene main ghatit hui ho
 Indirect methods of data collection are needed in countries where complete data is not available, as in the case of most developing countries
 One of these techniques is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters died or how many children they had and how old they were
 in surveykshanon ke saath, shodhakarta tab paroksh rup se sampurna jansankhya ke liye janm yaa mrityu dar kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Other indirect methods include asking people about siblings, parents and children
 jansankhya prakriyaaon ko gadhane ke liye kai prakaar ke janasankhyikeey tareeke maujuud hai
 They include the model of death toll, fertility, marriage, disability, population estimates and population dynamics
 janasankhyikee kii mahatvapurn avadharanaon main shaamil he: The size of a permanent population does not necessarily remain fixed, it keeps increasing and decreasing
 dhyaan den ki ashodhit mrityu dar jise upar paribhaashit kiya gaya he or jise ek puri aabaadi par lagu kiya jaataa he, ek bhraamak dharna de saktaa he
 For example, the number of deaths per 1000 people may be higher for developed countries than less developed countries, despite the fact that health levels are better in developed countries
 aisa is vajah se he kyonki viksit deshon main anupatik rup se buudhe log zyaada hai, jinke kisi vishisht varsh main marane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, jiske kaaran kisi nirdisht umr main mrityu dar kam hone ke baavjood bhi samgr mrityu dar adhik ho sakati he
 a more complete picture of mortality is presented by a separate life table that summarizes mortality at each age

 Fertility rates may also present a misleading assumption that the population is growing rapidly while perhaps not in fact, since the measurement of fertility rate only includes the fertility rate of women and does not adjust for the sex ratio

 What will be the population size at time t + 1? samay t se t + 1 tak prakritik vruddhi Net migration from time t to t + 1 is buniyadi sameekaran ko up-jansankhya par bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the size of a population within ethnic groups or society or country is subject to the same source of change
 haalanki, jab jaateey samoohon par kaam kiya jaataa he to, "nival pravaas" ko, bhautik pravaas or jaateey punahpahchaan main upavibhajit karnaa pad saktaa he
 Individuals who change their ethnic labels or whose ethnic classification changes over time in government statistics may be considered migrant or moving from one subcategory of the population to another

 Therefore whenever the size or variation of the population is calculated, the error in the underlying data needs to be discounted

 The period 1860–1910 can be referred to as a period of transition when demography emerged as a distinct field from statistics
 Many great international demography scholars emerged during this period, such as Adolf Quettlet, William Farr, Luis Adolf Bertillon and his son Jack, Joseph Corosi, Anders Nicolas Kerr, Richard Bokh, Wilhelm Lexis, and Luigi Bodio, all of the tools of demography and methods
 And contributed to the development of techniques of demographic analysis

 Similar trends are now seen in more developing countries, so instead of going out of control, global population growth is clearly expected to slow in this century, which will eventually stagnate or even decline

 Migration researchers do not designate those transfers as 'migration' unless they are to some extent permanent
 Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travelers to be expatriates
 Although demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data, such as tax forms and labor force surveys, are also important

 Demography, being at the crossroads of disciplines such as geography, economics, sociology, or epidemiology, provides tools for the study of a broad field of population issues for which it combines a more technical quantitative approach that provides the core of the subject
 Indicating that many other methods are derived from sociology or other sciences

 inase hyperbolic tangent "tanh", hyperbolic kosecont "csch" yaa "cosech", hyperbolic secont "sech", tathaa hyperbolic kotangent "coth", vyutpann hue hai
 Hyperbolic functions are defined in many ways
 ek vidhi inako ixponential falan ke falan ke rup main paribhaashit karti he- Hyperbolic functions can also be defined as solutions of differential equations
 hyperbolic sin or hyperbolic kosine nimnlikhit tantra ke anany hal hai- such that s = 0 and c = 1
 ye falan nimanlikhit sameekaran ke annya hal bhi hai- f ′′ = f, { \ displaystyle f''=f,} such that f = 1, f ′ = 0, { \ displaystyle f=1,f'=0,} for the hyperbolic cosine, and f = 0, f ′ = 1, { \ displaystyle f=0,f'=1,} for the hyperbolic sine
 Hyperbolic functions may also be deduced from trigonometric functions with complex arguments: where i is the imaginary unit with the property that i 2 = − 1
 { \ displaystyle i^{2}=-1

 In general, taxes are levied on individual units as a mandatory levy for governance related operations
 karon ko saamanyat: rajasvvruddhi kaa hi saadhan mana jaataa he kintu raashtra kii arthniti ko bhi ye prabhavit karte hai
 The purpose of levying taxes is to collect funds for development works and to remove asymmetry of the nation as possible

 manu ne kaha he ki shastron ke anusaar raja kar laga saktaa he
 He suggested that taxes should be related to the income and expenditure of the subjects
 manu ne atyadhik karadhaan ke prati raja ko aagaah kiya he ki donon charam simaaon arthath karon ke purna abhaav or had se adhik karadhaan se bachanaa chahie
 According to him, the king should make such a system of collection of taxes that the subjects do not feel difficulty while paying taxes

 Taking his dead body, he threw it in the same pond in which Ghushma used to throw the earthly Shivling daily

 There was a furore in the whole house
 sudharma or uski putravadhu donon sir petakar foot-footkar rone lage
 But Ghushma, as usual, was engrossed in worshiping Lord Shiva
 jaise kuch hua hi na ho
 After finishing the puja, she started to leave the earthly Shivalingas in the pond
 jab vah talab se lautne lagi usee samay uskaa pyaara laal talab ke bheetar se nikalakar aata hua dikhalaai padaa
 He always came and fell at the feet of Ghushma
 jaise kahin aas-paas se hi ghumkar aa rahaa ho
 At the same time, Lord Shiva also appeared there and started asking Ghushma to ask for the groom
 vah sudeha kii ghanouni karatuut se atyant cruddh ho uthe the
 He was looking forward to cutting his throat with his trident
 ghushma ne haath jodakar bhagavan shiv se kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap mujh par prasann hai to meri us abhaagin bahan ko kshamaa kar den
 Surely he has committed a very heinous sin, but by your mercy i got my son back
 ab aap use kshamaa karen or prabho! My one more prayer is, for the welfare of the people, you should stay in this place forever
 ' bhagavan shiv ne uski ye donon baaten sweekaar kar leen
 Appearing as Jyotirlinga, he started living there

 'intaraashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan, jise adhiktar ISO kaha jaataa he, vibhinn rashtron ke maanak sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon se gathit ek anterrashtriya maanak-vinyas sanstha he
 It was established on February 23, 1947, to declare worldwide industrial and commercial standards
 iskaa mukhyalay geneva, switzraland main sthit he
 Although ISO calls itself an NGO, its ability to set standards, which often become law, either by agreements, or national values; This makes it more powerful than ngos
 vaise vyavhaar main yah ek sankaay yaa alpakaaleen sanghathan jaise karyrat he, jisaki sarkaron se majboot kaniyaan hai
 
 is sanghathan kaa logo yaa chihn do aadhikarik bhashaaon main he amareeki angreji evam french
 It also contains ISO characters, which it is often known as, which is its abbreviation
 balki yah sankshipti unani / greek shabd ἴσος se bana he, jiskaa arth he baraabar
 Assuming that the organization will have a different concatenation in different languages, it decided to run an all-encompassing universal name ISO
 yah swayan main is sanghathan kaa uddeshy siddh karata he
 The main products of ISO are international standards
 ISO dwaara hi prakashit hai : takneekee report, takneekee vishesheekaran, saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran, takneekee shuddhipatr, evam and pathpradarshak
 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included
 ASTM International ke sahyog se viksit maanakon main ASTM ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 The use of dates and iss is incompatible for incomplete or unpublished standards, and in some circumstances the title of a published work may also be omitted
 takneekee report jari hoti he, jab koi takneekee samiti yaa up-samiti ne saamanyatya prakashit anterrashtriya maanak se bhinn prakaar kaa koi aankana sangrahit kiya ho, jaise ki sandarbh yaa vyakhyaayein
 Their naming conventions are similar to the standards, only TR is applied instead of IS, before the report name
 udhaahrantah The technical specialization can be composed when "the subject concerned is still in development, or for some other reason there is a possibility of consent to publish an international standard in the future"
 saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran koi "madhyavarti vishesheekaran ho sakate hai, jo ki purna anterrashtriya maanak ke vikaas se purv hi prakashit hua ho", yaa, IEC main 'dwicihn' prakaashan, jo ki kisi bahari sanghathan ke sahyog se prakashit hua ho " donon ke hi namakaran takneekee report kii bhaanti hi kiya jaataa he
 For example ISO kabhi kabhi takneekee / paribhaashik shuddhipatr bhi jari karata he
 These are amendments to the current standards, which are made for petty technical / technical errors, usability improvements, or limited applicability
 praayah inhen is aashaa ke saath jari kiya jaat he ki prabhavit maanak yato uddhrut yaa waapas liya jayega, apane agle anusoochna panravlokan tak
 ISO guides are quasi-standard, with subjects related to international standardization
 in kaa namakaran "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : sheershak" main hota he, udhaahrantah ISO documents are copyright protected, and ISO values most copies
 vaise adhiktar ke mulya keval electronic roopakar main hi liye jate hai
 Although useful, but using these documents, it is worth noting that they are also likely to change in abundance, before it becomes a standard
 ISO evam iske aadhikarik sanyukt rajya pratinidhi evam anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog dwaara kuch maanak ni:shulk uplabdh karaae jate hai
 ISO has 157 national members, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO kii teen sadsyta shreniyan hai: Participating members are called "P" or p members, while the compliant members are called "O" or o members
 is tathy ne, ki kai iso-srujit maanak sarvgat, sarvyaapee hai; kai maukon par, "ISO" kaa saamaanya prayog prerit kiya he, us utpaada ko varnit karne hetu, jo ki maanakon ko maanata he
 There are many examples of this: maanakeekaran ke kshetron main, prachur aachhadan ke parinaamon se, evam soochna praudyogiki se sambandhit karyon se, nibatane hetu; ISO evam IEC yaa anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog se ek sanyukt takneekee samiti gathit kijise ISO / IEC JTC1 ke nam se janaa jaataa he
 This AC is the first committee, and is the same till date
 iskaa aadhikarik aadesh he, vishwavyaapee bazaaron main vyapaar evam upayokta kii aavashyaktaaon hetu, IT maanakon kaa vikaas, anurakshan, prachaar karnaa
 At present there are 18 sub-committees: - ISO / IEC JTC1 kii sadsyta bilkul va lagbhag apane donon mul sanghathanon kii bhaanti hi pratibandhit he
 a member can be either a participant or an observer
 donon main keval prastaavit maanakon evam anya utpaadon par matdaan kii kshamta kaa hi bhed he
 There is no need for a member institution to maintain a level / opinion on any or every sub-committee
 yadhyapi yada-kada, parantu nai parsesthitiyon se saamana karne hetu up-samitiyaan gathit kii ja sakati hai, yaa bhang bhi kii ja sakati hai, yadi unka kaary kshetra ab lagu nahin he
 International Workshop Agreement, such as ISO / TS, International Workshop Agreement is also another arsenal of isos, in areas where technical infrastructure and expertise have not yet been reached; Provides quick response to standardization requirements there
