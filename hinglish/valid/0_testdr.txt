 The spontaneity of homeostatic sleep needs to be balanced with the circadian element for satisfactory sleep
 sirkadian ghadi se praapt sandesh ke saath-saath yah sharir ko bataata he ki ise neend kii jarurat he
 The circadian rotation mainly determines wakefulness from sleep
 ek vyakti jo niyamit rup se jaldi uthta yaa uthati he, aam taur par vah apane saamaanya samay se adhik der tak soye nahin rah saktaa yaa sakati, yahaan tak ki bhale hi usne kam neend lee ho
 Sleep duration is influenced by the DEC2 gene

 ek vyakti kaa bada neend prakaran apekshaakrit nishphal or aparyaapt ho saktaa he agar yah din ke "galat" samay main hota he; vyakti ko sharir ke taapmaana ke nunatam hone se pehle kam se kam chah ghante sona chahie
 The correct timing is when the following two markers or markers appear after the middle episode of sleep and before waking up: maanav neend umr ke hisaab se or vyaktiyon ke bich bhinn ho sakati he or agar din main uneendaapan yaa dushkriya na ho to neend ko paryaapt mana jaataa he
 a psychiatric study of one million adults at the University of California, San Diego found that those who live the longest are self-motivated and sleep six to seven hours a night
 neend kii avadhi or mahilaon main mrityu dar ke jokhim par hue ek anya adhyayan main bhi aisa hi parinaam paaya gaya
 Other studies show that "increased mortality is consistently associated with those who sleep more than 7 to 8 hours per day", although this study also says that it may be due to depression and socio-economic conditions, Which become co-related in terms of data
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki alarm lagaakar jagane waalon kii tulana main, jo log prakritik rup se kam neend ke baad jag jaaya karte hai, sirf uname kam neend ke ghante or kam rugnataa ke bich sah-sambandh prakat hote hai
 Researchers at the University of Warwick and University College London found that sleep deprivation more than doubled the risk of death from heart disease, but too much sleep may also be associated with doubling the risk of death, although primarily Not from heart disease
 professor francisco capusio ne kaha, "choti neend ko vajan badhane, ucchraktchaap or tip 2 madhumeh ke liye or kabhi-kabhi mrityu ke liye ek jokhim kaa kaarak banataa dekha gaya he; lekin choti neend-mrityu dar ke vipareet lambii neend ko badhi hui mrityu dar se jod sakane ke liye koi sambhavit tantra saamne nahin aayaa he, abhi isaki jaanch hona baaqi he
 Some people are involved, but depression, low socioeconomic status, and cancer-related illness are the reasons for this 


 In terms of prevention, our findings suggest that sleeping around seven hours per night continuously is optimal for health Or is best and a continued decrease in sleep may predispose to ill health
 " In addition, sleep difficulties are intimately associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, alcoholism, and bipolar disorder
 avsaad se grast vayaskon ke 90% tak main neend kii kathinaaiyaan pai gayi hai
 Anomalies found in the EEG include disruptions in sleep continuity, decreased delta sleep, and altered REM patterns, including relation to latency, overnight splitting, and density of eye movements

 Neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have shown that the frontal regions of the brain are particularly responsive to homeostatic sleep pressure
 vaigyanik is baat par sahamat nahin hai ki kitna neend kaa karj jamaa hona sambhav he; kya yah kisi vyakti kii ausat neend ke hisaab se jamaa hota he yaa koi anya maandand he; na hi haal ke dashakon main audyogic vishwa main vayaskon main neend ke karj kii prabalata main koi ullekhneey badlaav aayaa he
 It has happened that children of western societies are sleeping less than before
 aisa andeh he ki kab or kitni der tak ek vyakti ko neend kii jarurat he, jaise neend se sambandhit vyavhaar kaa ek bada pariman, hamaare anuvanshiki dwaara viniyamit hota he
 Researchers have discovered some evidence that seems to support this notion
 neend ke prakaarya ke bare main anek siddhanton ne apni-apni vyakhya prastaavit kii he, lekin aisa pratibimbit hota he ki vishay ke bare main samajhadaari philhal adhuri he
 It is possible that sleep evolved to fulfill some fundamental function, and over time it took many functions
 yah mudda uthaaya gaya ki agar neend aavashyak nahin hoti, to yah jaanane kii apeksha kii jaaegi: To date no animal has been found that can meet these criteria
 anek main se neend ke kuch prastaavit kaary nimnlikhit hai
 Sleep has been shown to aid wound healing
 2004 main gumustekin at al
 dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki neend ke abhaav ke kaaran chuhon ke jaale ko thik hone main baadha aayi
 It has been found that sleep damage affects the immune system
 2007 main jager at al
 dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main, chuhon ko 24 ghante tak neend se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 a blood test of sleep deprived mice found a 20% decrease in white blood cell count when compared with a controlled group, a significant change in the immune system
 ab yah kaha janaa sambhav he ki "neend kii kshati rogksham kaary ko ksheen karti he or rogksham neend main herpher kii chunauti pesh karata he," or yah bataaya gaya ki standhari praani jo ki lambii neend main apana samay lagaaya karte hai ve rogksham pranali main nivesh karte hai, kyonki jin prajatiyon kii lambii neend hua karti he unamem adhik shwet rakt kan hua karte hai
 It is yet to be proven that sleep duration affects somatic development
 2007 main jeni at al
 dwaara ek adhyayan main 305 bacchon ke vikaas, oonchai or vajan ko darj kiya gaya, yah unke mata-pita ke saath sahasambaddh hokar kiya gaya, mata-pita dwaara bacchon ke sone ke samay kii jaankaree di jaati rahi or yah adhyayan nau varshon tak chalaa
 yah paaya gaya ki "bacchon main neend kii avadhi main badlaav kaa asar unke vikaas par hota nahin lagata he
 "it has been observed that sleep — and more specifically slow sleep — affects the increase of hormone levels in adult males
 aath ghante kii neend ke dauraan, vaan coutor, leprult or plat ne paaya ki jin logon main SWS kaa ooncha pratishat rahaa unamem hormone srav kii oonchi sanvruddhi bhi rahi, jabaki lam pratishat SWS waalon main hormone kii nimna vruddhi rahi
 There are many arguments in favor of the healthy work of sleep
 neend ke dauraan chayapachay charan sarjan kriya he; neend ke dauraan sanvruddhi hormone jaise sarjan kriya hormone jaise adhimaanya dhang se sravit hote hai
 In general, sleep duration in species is inversely related to animal size and directly related to basal metabolic rate
 ek bahut hi ucch aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath chuuhe rojaanaa 14 ghante tak kii neend liya karte hai, jabaki hathi or jiraph nimna aadhariya chayapachay dar ke saath maatr 3-4 ghante hi sote hai
 Energy conservation can be done by resting peacefully without shutting down the composition of the atmosphere, which is a potentially dangerous situation
 ek mand nahin sone vaala jaanavar kii shikariyon se bache rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he, jabaki tab bhi vah urja sangrakshan karata rahata he
 Sleep, sleep, seems to serve a purpose or purposes other than conserving energy; For example, hibernating animals go to sleep again after waking up from hibernation due to lack of sleep during the hibernation period
 ve nishchit rup se acchhee tarah se aaraam kar chuke hote hai or sheetanidra ke dauraan urja sangrakshan bhi kiya he, lekin kuch anya kaaran se unhen sone kii jarurat he
 Rats that are kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia and, eventually, fatal septicemia
 REM neend kii ontogenetic pariklpana ke anusaar, navjaat shishu sambandhi REM neend ke dauraan hone vaali gatividhi khaskar sharir ke vikaas ke liye mahatvapurn he 
 Studies on the effects of active sleep deprivation have shown that early in life this deficiency causes behavior problems, permanent sleep disruption, decreased brain mass, and death of neuron cells in an unusual magnitude
 mastishk ke vikaas ke liye REM neend mahatvapurn prathit hota he
 Most of the sleep of infants is occupied by REM sleep, babies spend most of their time in sleep
 vibhinn prajatiyon main, janm lenevaala shishu jitna adhik aparipakv hota he, vah utana hi adhik samay REM neend main bitaata he
 The proponents also state that rem-induced muscle inhibition in the presence of brain activation aids brain development by activating the chetopagam, although this may put the infant in difficulty without any operational consequences
 iske atirikt, REM neend ke abhaav se baad ke jivan main vikaas kii asaamanyataayen paidaa hoti hai
 However, this has not been explained why older adults still need REM sleep
 jaleey stanpayi shishu shaishvavastha main REM neend nahin lete; umr badhane ke saath aise pashuon main REM neend badhati jaati he
 Scientists have described many ways in which sleep has been shown to be related to memory
 turnar, drumund, salaamat or brown dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan main neend ke abhaav se karyrat smriti par prabhaav padataa dikhaaya gaya
 Working memory is important because it keeps information active for further processing and supports higher-level cognitive functions such as decision making, reasoning, and contextual memory
 adhyayan main 18 mahilaon or 22 purushon ko chaar dinon kii avadhi main prati raat sirf 26 minute hi sone kii anumati di gayi
 These individuals initially gave cognitive tests after complete rest and then were tested twice a day during four days of sleep deprivation
 antim pareekshan main, niyantrit samooh kii tulana main is neend-abhavagrast samooh kii ausat karyrat smriti vistaar main 38% kii giravat paayi gayi
 Memory seems to be affected differently by certain stages of sleep such as REM and slow sleep
 born, rasch or ges main uddhrut, ek adhyayan main anek maanav vishyon kaa upyog kiya gaya tha: jaagran niyantrit samoohon or neend pareekshan samoohon kaa
 neend or jaagran samoohon ko ek kaary sikhaaya gaya or phir sabhi pratibhaagiyon main santulit rup se raat ke kram main, raat kii shuruyaat or der raat donon hi samay pareekshan kiya gaya
 When those participants' brains were scanned during sleep, the hypnogram found that SWS dominated the sleep phase early in the night, representing an average of around 23% of sleep phase activity
 niyantrit samooh kii tulana main, ghoshnaatmak smriti pareekshan main aarambhik-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 16% behatar pradarshan kiya
 During late-night sleep, REM became the most active sleep stage, with approximately 24% and the late-night test group performed 25% better on the procedural memory test than the control group
 isse pataa chalata he ki der-raatri rem-sampann neend se prakriyaatmak smriti ko laabh miltaa he, jabaki aarambhik-raatri sws-sampann neend se ghoshnaatmak smriti ko laabh hota he
 a study conducted by Dutta has indirectly supported these results
 22 nar chuhon ko adhyayan kaa paatr banaaya gaya tha
 a box was constructed in which a rat could move freely from one end to the other
 dibbe kii tali ispaat kii jaali se banaayi gayi thi
 a light flashes in the compartment with a sound
 Five seconds later, an electric shock is applied
 As soon as the blow started, the rat would go to the other end of the box, then the blow would have ended immediately
 Rats could also go to the other end of the box using a five-second delay and thus avoid shocks altogether
 jatke kii avadhi kabhi bhi paanch second se adhik nahin rahi
 This was repeated 30 times on half the mice
 anya aadhe, niyantran samooh, ko usee pareekshan main rakhaa gaya, lekin unki pratikriya par dhyaan die bina chuhon ko jhatka diya gaya
 After each training session, the mice were kept in a recording cage for six hours for polygraphic recording
 This process was repeated for three consecutive days
 is adhyayan main paaya gaya pareekshan ke baad neend ki neend recording satr ke dauraan, chuhon ne niyantran pareekshanon ke baad kii tulana main, abhyaas pareekshanon ke baad REM neend main 25
47% adhik samay bitaayaa
 ye pareekshan born at al
 adhyayan ke parinaamon kaa samarthan karte hai, inase REM neend or prakriyaatmak gyaan ke bich sahasambandh kaa ek spasht sanket miltaa he
 An observation from the Dutta study is that the sleep exercise group spent 180% more time in the SWS than the control group during the recording session after the test
 This fact was supported by a study by Kudrimoti, Burns and mcnaughton
 is adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki sthanik khoj gatividhi ke baad, prayog main hippocample kii koshikaon kaa pattern SWS ke dauraan punahsakriy hota he
 Kudrimoti et al
 In one study, seven mice were run in a linear track using the reward at one end
 chuhon ko trek main anukool hone ke liye 30 minute tak rahane diya gaya, phir unhen inaam-aadhaarit prashikshan ke liye trek main 30 minute tak daudaya gaya or phir unhen 30 minute tak aaraam karne diya gaya
 During each of these three periods, EEG data were collected to inform the rats' sleep stages
 kudrimoti at al
 ne SWS ke purv-vyavhaar ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rates ko or saat chuhon ke ausatan 22 trek -daud dwaara SWS ke uttar-vyavhaar main teen baar rakhe das minute ke avkaash ko pariklit kiya
 The results showed that the ten minutes after the test race session showed a 12% increase in mean firing rate of hippocampal cells compared to prior levels; However, after 20 minutes, the mean firing rate rapidly returned to the previous level
 sthanik anveshan ke baad SWS ke dauraan hippocample kii koshikaon kii firing main vruddhi se samajha ja saktaa he ki aakhir kyon datta ke adhyayan main SWS neend kaa str bad gaya tha, kyonki yah bhi sthanik anveshan ke ek rup se sambhddha tha
 In order to increase the magnitude of slow oscillations during SWS, a study was conducted involving direct current stimulation in the puerperal cortex
 ekadish dhara uttejan ne agle din shabd-jodi samaran main bahut vruddhi kar di, isse yah pramaan mila ki praasangik smritiyon ke samekan main SWS ek badi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Various studies suggest that there is a correlation between complex functions of sleep and memory
 harvard ke neend shodhakarta sapar or stickgold kaa kahana he ki smriti or abhyaas kaa ek aavashyak hissaa tantrika koshika drumashm se yukt hota he, jo nae neuronal samparkon main sangathit hone ke liye koshika pind ko soochna bhejtaa he
 This process demands that no external information be presented to these drachms and it is also said that this is probably why memories and knowledge are solid and organized during sleep
 "parirakshan or sangrakshan" ke siddhant kaa maananaa he ki neend anukoolneey kaary karti he
 In those parts of the 24 hours of the day when the creature is protected, when it is awake and therefore moving around and when the person is at great risk
 jeev ko bhojan karne ke liye 24 ghante kii jarurat nahin hoti or vah anya jaruraton ko puraa karata he
 With this approach of adaptation, organisms stay out of harm's way, where they can fall prey to other potentially strong organisms
 ve usee samay neend lete hai jo unki suraksha ko adhiktam banaata he, unhen shaareerik kshamta or unka awaas pradaan karata he
 
 haalanki, yah siddhant isaki vyakhya karne main vifal rahaa kii aakhir kyon saamaanya neend ke dauraan bahari vaataavaran se mastishk kaa sambandh tut jaataa he
 Another argument against this theory is that sleep is not merely a passive consequence of separating animals from the environment, but rather a "drive"; the animal is late in its behavior in order to sleep
 isliye, gatividhi or niskriyata kii avadhi kii vyakhya ke liye sirkadian viniman paryaapt se adhik he, jo jeev ke liye anukoolneey he, lekin neend kii or bhi adhik ajeeb vishistataaen sambhawatah anya tathaa agyaat kaaryon ko puraa karti hai
 In addition, preservation theory needs to explain why carnivores such as lions, who are at the top of the food chain and who do not have much fear, tend to sleep too much
 yah kaha gaya he ki ve jab shikaar par nahin hote tab unhen urja ksharan ko kam karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Preservation theory also does not explain why aquatic mammals sleep while walking
 in samvedansheel ghanton ke dauraan niskriyata vahi karti he or adhik laabhprad ban jaati he, kyonki praani tab bhi shikariyon aadi kii tarah kii paryaavaran chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main sakasham hota he
 Sleep faults again after faulty adaptation to the sleepless night, but apparently for some reason
 apane sone ke samay kisi singh se apni jaan bachaane main laga hua ek zebra din ke samay neend se nidhaal hokar so jaataa he, jo shikaar banane se kam nahin, kahin adhik asurakshit he
 Dreaming is the feeling of sensory images and sounds during sleep, the dreamers in sequence feel more like a manifest partner than an observer
 sapane dekhnaa pons dwaara utprerit hota he or neend ke REM charan ke dauraan adhikanshtah sapane aayaa karte hai
 People have introduced many concepts about dream work
 sigmund frid ne nirvivaad rup se maan liya ki sapane un apurna ichchhaaon kii abhivyakti hai jo achetan man main daal yaa phenk di jaati hai or unhone in ichchhaaon kii khoj ke liye manovishleshan ke rup main sapanom kii vyakhya kaa upyog kiya
 See Freud: The Interpretation of Dreams frid kaa kaam sapanom kii manovaigyanik bhoomika se sambandhit he, jo spasht rup se kisi bhi shaareerik bhoomika ke ho sakane ko chhod nahin detaa
 isliye haal ke smriti or anubhav ke vyavasthaapan or samekan main badhati aadhunik dilchaspee dwaara isse inkaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Recent research claims that the overall role of consolidation and administration of Chetopagam contacts during exercise and experience is that of sleep
 jon alan hobsan or robert mccarle kaa sakriyan sanshleshan siddhantakahata he ki REM avadhi main dimagi valkal main hone vaali neuron kii andhadhundh firing se sapane aayaa karte hai
 According to this theory, the forebrain then weaves a story in an attempt to reconcile and draw meaning by presenting nonsensical sensory information; That's why many dreams are of strange nature
 prabhavi khuraaq kuch had tak purv main upyog par nirbhar karata he
 As its effects begin to wane, it may cause a rapid alertness
 kharaab neend ke kai kaaran hai
 The following principles of healthy sleep can solve physical or emotional problems

 bujrg vyakti maahaul main gadabadi se aasaani se jag jate hai or kuch had tak acchhee neend lene kii kshamta kho de sakate hai
 a variety of patents, products, and sleep techniques are available as sleep assistants, which allow a natural state during sleep to improve blood circulation and reduce body pain
 chunki maanav itihaas main khaat yaa palang kaa avishkaar apekshaakrit abhi haal hi main hua he, isliye is tarah ke tareeke waapas jameen par sone kii salaah dene se lekar aise utpaada jo aapke paanvon se kambal ko dur karata ho, se lekar anek prakaar ke "smriti fom" kii krambaddhata kii or le jaataa he, jo ek vyakti ko dharaatal ke anukool banaata he
 Also the difficulty of falling asleep or the urge to stop falling asleep can even activate a "second priority" for a moment, which can then become a bit painful after going temporarily
 shodh se pataa chalata he ki nidra kaa pattern vibhinn samskritiyon main alag-alag tarah kaa he
 The biggest difference in societies is that there are sources of artificial illumination on a large scale and nowhere else
 praathmik antar jo najar aata he vah yah he ki puraani sanskatiyon main nidra kaa pattern kahin adhik bhangur rahaa he
 For example, people may fall asleep soon after the sun sets, then wake up frequently throughout the night, sleep awake, and last for hours, lives
 sone or jaagane ke bich kii seemaa an samaajon main aspasht he
 Some observers believe that sleep is a nightmare in these societies where sleep is broken between two periods, the first part of deep sleep and the second part of REM sleep
 kuch samaajon main nidra kaa pattern khandit hota he, jisamen log puure din bhar sote hai or raat main thode samay ke liye
 In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people sleep throughout the day or night, depending on when something is happening
 kam se kam madhya 19veen sadi se audyogic pashchimi deshon main bade paimaane par kritrim roshni uplabdh hone lagi or prakaash vyavastha kii shuruyaat hone se sabhi jagah neend ke pattern main ullekhneey badlaav aayaa
 In general, people are in very deep sleep long after going to sleep at night, although this is not always true
 kuch samaajon main, aam taur par log kam se kam ek anya vyakti ke saath yaa phir jaanwaron ke saath sote hai
 In some other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except the most intimate family, such as a spouse

21 Modern trends prevailing The history of library classification shows that the schemes of classification have evolved from full numerical, such as Library of Congress and Rider International classification, to independent, analytical-syntactic, such as the third version of bipartite classification
 
 vargeekaran kii aadhuniktam prachlit pravritiyaan: maanakeekaran, siddhanton par aadhaarit atithy yojana or sanganakeekaran hai
 During the last few years, efforts are being made towards uniformity of classification ie 'international Classification Scheme'
 yah buddhijivi pathakon, visheshkar vidwaanon kii ant:shakti kii aavashyak bachat pradaan karegaa
 It has been felt that such a method should be developed which is based on principles
 gyaan vistaar bahut hi teevrgati se ho rahaa he
 New inter-control and external issues are arising
 is vistaar se prabhaavapurvak tathaa utpaadak rup se nipatane ke liye ek vargeekaran yojana aisi honi chahie jo apni mul sanrachana ko bina badale, naye vichaaron ko ek saraahneey str tak, suvidhapurvak samyojit kar sake
 The need for progressive principles of classification has been felt for guiding the development of classification scheme, method for preparing its structure and classification of documents
 yah kaary ranganathan dwaara pradutt vargeekaran ke siddhanton par aadhaarit aatithy janaa dwaara sambhav ho sakaa or vargeekaran yojana ko aadhuniktam banane main sahaayak siddh hua
 In today's era, there is a trend of computerization for the maintenance and retrieval of information
 hamen soochna ke pun: prapan tathaa uske sanghathan hetu shaktishaalee takneekon tathaa upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa he
 In computerized information retrieval of information systems, the need for classification has been felt, the importance of its classification increases
 ek duusari pravriti-saamaanya banaam vishesh vargeekaran kii he
 Because it is expected from all kinds of libraries, information centers, documentation centers that it will have a collection of all types of documents, but special importance has given them a very micro-level classification of the documents to which they belong
 Is necessary
 is prakaar sabhi prakaar ke pralekhon kaa vargeekaran hetu saamaanya banaal vargeekaran kaa hona paramaavashyak he
 It was Dr
 Ranganath who created a new type of taxonomy - the 'self-oriented, analytical-syntactic taxonomy', which was freely accepted not only for panel arrangement but also for preparing indexes, etc
 
 vargeekaran ke liye `swatantra-mukh, vishleshnatmak, sanshleshneey yojana' anya yojanaayen jaise--praaia: gananaatmak udhaahrant: dui dashamalav vargeekaran, praaia: falkit udhaahrant: sarvavyaapak dashamalvawargeekaran or drudh falkit
 For example, the first and second versions of bipartite classification provide much more modernity
 jo vargeekaran ke aadhuniktam prachlan tathaa samasyaon, ke hal karne kaa maatr upaay he
 Dr
 Ranganathan's highest contribution in the field of classification is the bipartite classification, which was first published in 1933
 dwitiya sanskaran 1939 main, tritiy 1950 main, chaturth 1952 tathaa pancham 1957 va shashtham 1960 main prakashit hue or saptam sanskaran abhi bhi anischitata ke mode par he
 Dr
 Ranganathan is known not only as a taxonomist, but also as a classographer
 san 1946-47 ke dauraan jab ve kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke granthalay vigyaan ke professor tathaa pustakalayadhyaksh the, unhone apni vargeekaran yojana ke anusaar vishvavidhyalay granthalay ke lagbhag ek lakh granthon kaa phir se vargeekaran lagbhag 18 mahinon ke alp samay main kiya
 For this work, he took the help of his own given rule of osmosis
 mahatvapurn baat yah rahi ki yah sab kuch unhone apane uttardaayitvapurn kaaryon jaise-pathan kaary, prashasnic kaaryon aadi kaa paalan karte huye apni 56 varsh kii avasthaa main kiya
 Dr
 Ranganathan introduced the first 'classification principle'
 yah siddhanth vargeekaran tantron kaa dhaanchaa taiyaar karne tathaa anya shabd-bhandar niyantrak upayon ke liye taratamyata, ekarupata or thospan pradaan karte hai
 In modern trends its use is as follows: `vargeekaran kaary ko teen falkon main vibhajit hona chahie', aisa anubhav kiya ja chukaa he
 This idea was first accepted by Dr
 Ranganathan in 1944
 san 1952 tak, ve is lakshya ko acchhee tarah samajhane main sakasham rahe tathaa vargeekaran kaary ko teen falkon arthath kalpana falak, maukhik falak or an kann falak main vibhajit kiya
 They found that the 'thought board' is probably related to analyzing and synthesizing joint and mixed subjects into their faces, sub-faces, and surprises, and providing auxiliary sequences
 `vaachik falak' main kaary paribhaashit shabdaawalee ke liye upasutron se kendrit hota he tathaa maanak paribhaashik-shabdaawalee se shabdon ke naveenatam prachlit swaroop ko vyakt karata he
 It will be very helpful if the international terminology-terminology is established and adopted for use
 `a nann falak' main saamaanya vichaaron ko adko dwaara prastut kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ranganathan used the framework of the mixed non-system to provide more hospitality
 unhone naveen vichaaron ko atyadhik aatithy pradaan karne ke liye tathaa a can kii dridhtaa ko todane hetu anek yuktiyon ko sammilit kiya
 These 'block devices', 'vacancy devices', 'empty marks', 'nilakaran-ak', and 'zero-zero factor ak', used to extrapolate and inject new ideas
 in sabake baavjood unhone or bhi yuktiyaan bahutayat rup se aatithy praapt karne ke liye di, ve hai: punjit yukti, varnmalee yukti, kalkram yukti, utkrisht yukti, saamaanya upmukh yukti, dashamalav ansh yukti, gananaatmak yukti, vaataavaran yukti, mukhit yukti, bhugolic yukti, samooh a can yukti, mishrit aadhaar yukti, sankhyatmak yukti, aslesh yukti, smriti-sahaayak talika yukti vishay yukt, ityadi
 He used variable power-provided coordinate symbols for the nuns, which later became known as indicator numbers
 yah sanganak ke prayog ko bhi aasaan banaate hai
 Indicators act like bolts and nuts in forming a variety of joint and compound subjects by connecting points, sub-faces taken from different tables
 dow ranganathan ne vargeekaran aacharyon tathaa vargeekaron ko ek disha pradaan karne ke liye abhidhaaranon, upasutron tathaa siddhanton kaa ek sangathit samooh samaveshit kiya
 These theories, thesis and sub-sources, documentation research and training centers have been tested in the Granthalaya and Department of Library Sciences of various universities of India during the actual library classification
 dow ranganathan ke `prolagomena tu librari classification' ke tisare sanskaran main, 11 maanakeey siddhanth, 40 upasutra, 13 abhidharanayen,4 siddhanth mukh-anukram ke liye tathaa 18 siddhanth sahaayak-anukram ke liye diye gayi hai
 He gave the idea of mulmukh, Submukh, and Specifiers
 ye upmukh, paanch moulik shreniyon: vyaktitv, tatv, urja, sthaan, tathaa samay main vibhakt hai
 Collectively these are pmes
 Is known as T
 ye ek yaa ek-duusare--or maatr ek kii abhivyakti hai, aisa abhidhaarit kiya gaya he
 Principles of its sequence: diwala-chitra theory, entire theory of organs, cow-calf theory, verb-verb-verb theory, classification are not only helpful in preparing the structure of the system but also in other vocabulary control devices
 dow ranganathan ne saiddhanthik vikaas par aadhaarit, bahut se vishyon ke liye vargeekaran tantra kaa dhaanchaa taiyaar kiya tha
 There are about 150 such subjects, for which intensive tables have been prepared on the basis of bipartite classification
 `enles pha librari scince tathaa `documentation and librari scince' main vargeekaran par prakashit unke lekh, gahan vargeekaran se sambandhit kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main paryaapt rup se sahaayak he
 In our view, Dr
 Ranganathan will be remembered in future not for two-point classification, but for its fundamental principles
 soochikaran granthalay vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jo anek krantikari parivartanon tathaa vikaason kaa haal hi kaa sakshi he

 Lake Hillier is a saltwater lake on the shores of the largest islands of the islands and islets that make up the Recherche Archipelago on the south coast of the goldfields-esperance region in Western Australia
 It is particularly notable for its pink color

 Flinders visited the Middle Island again in 1803; He intended to stop "in a day or two for the purposes of swan-island Bay, purchase some of our lamps for the sick people, oil seals for geese, and some casks from the middle island at Lake Salt"
 It is reported that Flinders was later named after Lake William Hillier, a crew member of the investigator who died of dysentery on 20 May 1803, departing from the first expedition to the central island

 Lev Trotsky was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist of Russia, a Soviet politician and the founder and first leader of the Red Army
 roosi kranti ke baad hue bheeshan grih yuddh main vijayi rahi laal sena kii kaman trotski ke haath main hi thi
 As a theorist, he contributed to Marxist discourse through the theory of permanent revolution
 iske saath hi trotski ne ek niyam kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya ki poonjeewaad ke vikaas kaa str sabhi jagah ek sa nahin hota jiskaa parinaam pichde deshon main saamaajik or aitihaasik vikaas ke do charnon ke ek saath ghatit ho jane main nikalataa he
 This theoretical achievement of Trotsky in the first decade of the twentieth century amid the ongoing debate among Marxists reinforced the logic of revolutionizing an industrially backward country like Russia
 lenin ke dehanth ke baad trotski ne stallin dwaara pravartit ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant kaa virodh kiya, lekin ve party ke bheetar hone vaale sangharsh main akele padate chale gayi
 He was first expelled from the party, and then deported for conspiring against the Soviet state
 nishkasana ke dauraan trotski ne stallin ke netritv main ban rahe soviet sangh kii kadi aalochana karte hue use naukarshah, nirankush or rajkeey poonjeewaadi rajya kii sangya di
 Wandering around the world to escape the Soviet secret police, Trotsky composed classic texts such as 'permanent Revolution', 'revolution Bitred' and 'the History of Russian Revolution' in three volumes
 vishwa-kranti ke apane sapane ko dharti par utaarne ke liye unhone chauthe communist international kii sthapana bhi kii jise koi khaas kamyaabi nahin mili
 During the expulsion, he lost his life at the hands of a Stalin agent in Mexico
 trotski ke anuyaayiyon ne duniya ke kai deshon main choti- choti communist partiyaan bana rakhi hai
 His ideas have been labeled Trotskyism as an alternative to Soviet-style communism
 trotski kaa asli naam lev davidovich bronstin tha
 At an early age he was attracted to Marxism and while doing underground politics adopted the secret name of 'trotsky'
 unke jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first part is when, like an independent sign of Russian Marxism, he came close to Lenin while participating in the revolutionary movement and then refused to support him
 doosraa hissaa 1917 se shuru ho kar 1923 tak chalaa jab unhone lenin ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar soviet kranti ko agrgati pradaan kii
 After this, the third phase of his life began when he waged a campaign against Stalinism to defend the benefits of the revolution
 bolshevik netaaon main keval trotski hi aise the jinhen lenin kaa pramukh saathi hone ke baavjood unke anuyaayi ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 In 1903, when the Russian Social People's Labor Party split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Trotsky did not support Lenin
 shuruyaat main unhone bolshavism kii yah kah kar ninda kii ki yah to sarvhaara kii nahin balki sarvhaara par taanaashaahee kaa formula he
 At that time he suspected that there were conspiratorial leaders like Lenin Robespierre because of which Russia's socialist movement would be misguided
 us samay trotski kaa vichaar tha ki gupt raajnneetik kaam karne vaali peshewar krantikariyon kii anushaasit party ke haath main kranti kii kaman dene se samaajwaad kaa lakshya nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 He was in favor of forming a party of a more democratic and open character
 1905 main ve saint petersburg kii soviet netaa ke rup main ubhare
 This first Soviet of Russia played a major role in the 1905 revolution, and Trotsky considered it a model of authentic democracy
 kranti vifal ho jane ke baad zaarshahi ne unhen giraftaar karke siberia bhej diya
 Trotsky escaped and spent the next decade in Europe
 is dauraan santhnik rup se ve menshavikon ke saath rahe
 When he returned to Russia in 1917, the Zarashahi had collapsed due to the February revolution
 ab ve bolshevikon ke saath aa gayi kyonki unhen laga ki unke or lenin ke vichaaron main kaaphi samanta aa chuki he
 Lenin himself was an admirer of Trotsky's political and theoretical abilities
 bolshevik party main trotski kaa kad teji se badha
 He participated in peace talks with the Germans as the commissioner of foreign affairs
 faujee kamisar ke rup main trotski ne laal sena ke gathan main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai or grih yuddh main uskaa shandaar netritv kiya
 These successes led to Trotsky being viewed as one of Lenin's possible successors
 lenin kii hi tarah trotski ko roosi sarvhaara varg kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon main gaharaa vishwaas tha
 Based on this belief, he had a special kind of theoretical understanding that came out of the study of world capitalism
 trrotski kaa vichaar tha ki apane pichhadepan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisi desh ko un charnon se kramvaar guzarane kii jarurat nahin hoti jinase viksit desh guzar chuke hote hai
 Symptoms of backwardness emerge along with backwardness in these countries
 is siddhanth ke aadhaar par vishleshan karte hue trotski ne dikhaaya ki rus kaa adhikansh bhaag pichhadaa or aviksit he lekin usamen pashchimi prabhaavon ne bhi ghuspaith kar lee he
 Developed methods of economic production and relations are being adopted in many places
 audyogic vikaas ke in mukaamon ne shahari kendron main ek acha-khaasaa sarvhaara varg or ek pashchimikrut bauddhik abhijan paidaa kar diya he
 As a result, radical forms of political resistance and activism have become prevalent
 chunki udyogikaran upar se thopa gaya he isliye sthaneey poonjipati varg kamjor he, lekin sarvhaara varg majboot he
 The capitalist class is afraid of carrying out a democratic revolution and is unable to fulfill its historical obligation due to its inability, hence this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat
 kisaanon ko apane netritv main lete hue unke saath morcha bana kar majdoor varg ko samantshahi or uske sabhi avasheshon kaa unmoolan karte hue samaajwaad kii taraf badhanaa hoga
 Trotsky called his theory a permanent revolution
 1850 main marks communist lig kii general concil ko sambodhit karte hue is pad kaa istemaal kar chuke the
 According to Trotsky, farmers with a pre-capitalist mindset will not be able to support the workers in this revolutionary process for very long
 unki dilchaspee jameen kaa malikana mil jane tak hi rahegi
 a front made with farmers that paves the way for revolution will prove to be a hindrance in the creation of socialism
 isliye ek desh main, visheshtah rus main, samaajwaad kaa nirmaan tab tak safal nahin ho saktaa jab tak anya deshon main bhi kranti nahin ho jaati
 Therefore, the Russian Revolution should be seen as the initial phase of the world revolution, especially in developed countries
 dilachasp baat yah he ki trotski kii in baton or pratham vishwayuddh ke baad lenin dwaara pratipaadit kai siddhanton main kaafii samanta prathit hoti he
 Some Trotskyists have also alleged that Trotsky's principles were used by Lenin in the 1917 revolution
 yah alag baat he ki khud trotski ne 1917 main lenin kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke baad kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 After Lenin's death, Stalin wrote a paper about the construction of socialism in a country
 is maamle main bukharin jaise siddhantkaar bhi stallin ke saath the
 But Trotsky warned that the implementation of this principle would have disastrous consequences for Russia
 unhone kaha ki kheti ke samuhikeekaran kaa samay abhi nahin aayaa he
 Trotsky was also against limiting the comintern established by Lenin to the tools of Soviet foreign policy
 unka tark tha ki soviet sangh ko udyogikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke raste par jarur chalanaa chahie, par in uplabdhiyon ko samaajwaad kaa paryaay nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Socialism means higher productivity of labor, consequently better standard of living and society like the most developed forms of its capitalism
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he ki jab sarvhaara ke haath main vishwa-arthvyavastha kii bagdor ho
 Trotsky maintained that the Soviet system under Stalin should only be considered transitional
 abhi is baat kii guarantee nahin kii ja sakati ki iskaa vikaas samaajwaad main hoga yaa yah patit ho kar poonjeewaad ke kisi sanskaran main badal jaaegi
 Trotsky believed that the bureaucracy of Russia was taking the form of a new class
 bhale hi soviet samaaj rajkeey poonjeewaad kii sthiti main na pahunchaa ho, lekin uski sthiti mazdooron ke ek kamatar rajya jaisi to he hi
 The special feature of Trotsky's ideas was that he was opposed to the tendencies of seeing Marxism as the infallible medicine of every problem
 isi tarah ve marxvad ke naam par kala-sahitya or gyaan ke vibhinn kshetron ko ek vishesh disha main dhakele jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 Despite his radical views, he could not do a majority of the party in his favor
 party ke bheetar unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha jo sankat aane par to karishmai netritv pradaan kar saktaa he, lekin party ke bheetar hone vaali rosemara kii uthaa-patake se nibatane main dilchaspee nahin rakhata, or jo apni bauddhik chamak-damak main akelaa rahanaa pasand karata he
 When there was no revolution in Europe as Trotsky had hoped, he blamed the Stalinian project of abandoning the goal of world revolution and trying to build socialism in only one country
 trotski ne yah kabhi nahin mana ki stalinkaaleen galatiyon kii jad main party or raajnneeti kaa leninist-bolshevik vichaar he jiske kaaran ek party dwaara sanchalit rajya puure samaaj ko apana taabedaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 Indeed, Trotsky never reiterated his harsh criticisms of Lenin and Bolshevism from 1903 to 1914, even though he suffered expulsion in the third period of life

 pata samskruti evam paaton ke saanskrithik sandarbh kii vyakhya karne se pehle samskruti ke arth evam samskruti kii sanrachana kii vivechna kerani hogi
 Pata is a fundamental feature of the historical and traditional city of Bikaner, which can be seen in public in various squares, guvados, mohallas on the basis of ethnically in the city of Parakotayukt
 saamaanya taur par pata lakdi yaa lohe se nirmit baithak yaa chaoupal he jis par mohalle ke nivasee baithkar apana sukh-dukh baantate hai
 But socially and culturally Pata is the regulatory unit of the city, which has many traditions and customs
 atah paaton ke arth ko do arthon main spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Pata is derived from the Sanskrit word Sanskrit: पत which means the distance between two banks i
e
 the distance between two banks of rivers is called PAT

 Pata is a part of culture but in the city of Parkotayukt it is a culture in itself
 saadhaaran bolchaal main is shahar kii samskruti ko pata samskruti kaha jaataa he
 In fact, Pata is a physical visible object that is publicly available and motionless but conscious as a silent spectator

 Their souls remain on the pats because they have spent their entire lives on these pats

 The tradition is abstract and unwritten

 Therefore, the tradition is eternal, which develops automatically and gradually becomes a social heritage and social paradigm
 pata or paaton kii parampara kii utpatti kaa pataa lagaana ek kathin kaary he
 In the history of Bikaner, a 500-year-old city of Bikaner, after finding historical evidence about the origin of the Pats, some historical evidence can be found on the basis of which the following conclusions can be drawn about the origin of the Pats
 1
 kavi shri udaichand khartargachh mathen kii ’’bikaner ghazal‘‘ 1709 naamak rachana main nagar va bazaar varnan kavy main chowk kaa sandarbh shaamil he, jisamen likhaa gaya he ki - That is, in the middle of the market there are chowks on which the Seth-moneyleaders come and sit and talk about business, family and the whole world
 usee prakaar goda chaowkee kaa bhi ullekh is rachana main hota he
 Goda was the architect who built the Bhandasar Jain temple and a beautiful stone outpost has been built in Rangadi Chowk in the city of Parkotiyukta in memory of him
 yah chaowkee sundar nakkashi ke liye us samay prasiddh thi
 This outpost was built in the shape of a pate, according to researcher Krishnakumar Sharma, there were seven pots in Pagodi style at this outpost
 prasiddh bhandasar jain mandir kaa nirmaan pagaudi style main hi banaaya gaya he
 Some people say that the temple was built after seeing this style of patas, while others believe that this tradition of Pagoda style patas was started in memory of architect Goda
 pichley 10 varshon se ek pate par saat pate rakhane kii pagauda style parampara samaapt ho gai he
 2
 In 1838, a letter from the Bikaner Jain Association was sent for invitation to Shri Saubhagya Suriji named Virajit Khatargachh in Azimganj, which describes the picturesque Bikaner city
 raja ke singhaasana kii jagah pata darshaya gaya he
 Similarly, it depicts Godai Chowki, Bothra Chowki, Maluwan Ri Chowki
 raste main logon kii bheed main paaton kaa chithran darshaya gaya he

 Under the rule of Joravarsingh ruler of Bikaner, Mohta Diwan is laid in front of the house of Bakhtawar Singh
 iskaa ullekh harsudas mohataa kii bahi main miltaa he
 Due to the mansion and pride of Diwan Sahab, the then Sardar Amarsinh and cousin of King Zoravarsinh became his opponents
 baad main dewan bakhtawarsingh ne amarsingh kii jagah, unke bhai gajsinghji ko santanheen shaasha kii mrityu ke baad bikaner kaa shaasha banaaya
 Based on these historical evidences, the tradition of the Pats has been going on in the city of Bikaner since 1708, but on the basis of public beliefs, the tradition of the Pats has been going on since the time of Rao Bika because the rulers themselves ruled the seats
 sthaneey bhashaa main singhasanasib hone ko ’’paat baithna‘‘ kaha jaataa he
 Local people say that in the beginning the Pate used to be in the tents of the Sardars
 jab raav bika ne apane pita raav jodha se raaj chihn maange to unhone apni mrityu ke baad dene kaa vaada kiya
 When he died, when he asked for his sign from his half-brother Rao Sujaji, he refused to give it
 tab raav bika ne jodhpur par akraman kar diya or majaboor hokar jodhpur naresh ko ve raaj chihn dene padey
 This was Rao Bika's first political victory
 in rajachihnon main chhatra, chanwar, dhaal, talwaar, kataar, naganechiji devi kii atharahabhuji murti, takht, karand, bhavardhol, bairissal nagada, dalcigaar ghoda or bhujai he
 In which Takht is the sacred throne of the court
 iskaa aakaar pate ke samaan he
 When Rao Bika sat on this throne, he told his chiefs that "we sit in our court, you all sit in your tent party", that is, today we have sat on the throne in the court and all of you also have the throne in your tent
 Sit on usee din se pate deron ke aage lagane lage
 Apart from this, there is also mention of establishment of Pats in the Bahi of ethnic panchayats
 jaise surdasani panchayat kii bahi main san 1809 main paaton ke nirmaan kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The Pata of the Panchayat was also present in the Lakhotis' panchayat book in the Chowk of Lakhotis in the 18th century
 is prakaar parkotayukta shahar bikaner main 18veen shatabdi se paaton kii parampara lok-jivan main chalati aa rahi he
 Whereas on the basis of folk beliefs, it has been prevalent in Bikaner for 500 years since the time of Rao Bika

 shahar bikaner ke jivan main paaton kii upadeyata apane aap main ek pratimaanakta he
 Which is being clarified based on the following factual details: - bikaner shahar, jise sthaneey log dharmanagar kehete hai, aazaadee se pehle isi shahar ko chota kaashi bhi kehete the kyonki yahan pratiroj koi-naa-koi dharmik aayojan, jaise yajna, anushthan, kathavachan hote rahete hai
 All the religious rituals are organized here, their special identity is the religious belief and use of the pats
 jivan main paaton kaa upyog har jagah kiya jaataa he
 Patas are considered sacred everywhere, whether in temples or houses or religious ceremonies
 kyonki shastron main lakdi, hawa, fal, bahata pani va agni ko pavitra mana jaataa he
 Patas are made of wood, so they are considered sacred in religious rituals

 For a gas composed of a single atomic species, the Saha equation is written: where: In the case where only one level of ionization is important, we have n 1 = n e { \ displaystyle n_{1}=n_{e}} and defining the total density n as n = n 0 + n 1 { \ displaystyle n=n_{0}+n_{1}}, the Saha equation simplifies to: where ε { \ displaystyle \ epsilon} is the energy of ionization
 The Saha equation is useful for determining the ratio of particle densities for two different ionization levels
 The most useful form of the Saha equation for this purpose is where z denotes the partition function
 The Saha equation can be seen as a restatement of the equilibrium condition for the chemical potentials: ganpeshwaran main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
