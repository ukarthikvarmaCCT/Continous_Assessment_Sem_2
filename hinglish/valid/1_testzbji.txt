 The situation has now improved somewhat, at least in the academic literature and it is now generally accepted that the 'stirling engine' will refer exclusively to closed-cyclic regenerative heat engines with permanent gaseous working fluids, where the closed- Cyclic is defined as a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently held within the system and the regenerator is a particular process
 In accordance with internal heat exchanger and thermal store which describes the use of what is known as Rijnaretr

 a Stirling engine system consists of at least one heat source, one heat sink, and five heat exchangers
 kuch prakaaron main ise sanyukt kiya ja saktaa he yaa ise choda ja saktaa he
 The heat source may be the combustion of fuel, and since the combustion products are not mixed with the working fluid and come into contact with the internal moving parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can be run on a fuel that is exposed to other internal parts of the engine

 In a Stirling engine, the regenerator is an internal heat exchanger and a temporary heat storage between hot and cold places, constructed in such a way that the working fluid passes through it, first in one direction and then the other
 Its function is to maintain the heat within the system that would otherwise change with the environment at maximum and minimum cyclic temperatures, and thus enable the thermal efficiency of the cycle to reach the limiting Carnot efficiency defined by the maximum and minimum is

 However, many engines can be described as Stirling engines even without a direct regenerator, in simple beta and gamma configurations with 'loose fitting' displacements, the surface of the displaces and its cylinders will undergo cyclic heat transfer in which the working fluid
 Provides significant regenerative effects, especially in low-pressure engines
 yahi baat alpha vinyasit ingine ke garm or thande silendaron ke jodne vaale maarg ke bare main sach he
 In small, low-power engines it can only be constructed from cold-space walls, but where larger forces require a cooler using a fluid like water in order to transfer sufficient heat

 Two types of Stirling engines can be identified based on the way they act between the hot and cold parts of the cylinder: ek alpha sterling main bhinn silendaron main do power piston shaamil hote hai, jisamen ek garm or ek thanda hota he
 The hot cylinder is inside the high temperature heat exchanger and the cold cylinder is located inside the low temperature heat exchanger

 beta sterling main ek ekal power piston hota he jo ki usee shaft par usee silendar ke bheetar ek visthaapak piston ke rup main sthit hota he
 The displacing piston is loosely fitted and does not receive any energy from the expanding gas but only carries the gas acting from the hot heat exchanger to the cold heat exchanger
 jab karyrat gas ko silendar ke garm vaale bhaag main dhakela jaataa he tab iskaa vistaaran hota he or power piston ko dhakelta he
 When it is pushed towards the cold part of the cylinder it is the contraction and impulse of the machine, which usually rises by the flywheel and pushes the power piston to the other side to compress the gas

 The main subject of the original Sterling patent was the heat exchanger, which he called an "economizer" in many applications due to its increased fuel savings
 This patent also describes a form of economizer function in its specialized closed-cycle air engine design in which this application is now commonly known as 'regenerative'

 parinamswaroop, ek bor or 55 mm x 27 mm ke stroke ko 200 w ke darje par MP1002CA naam diya gaya 
 Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not go to a competitive price and that the advent of transistor radios with ultimately lower energy requirements meant the disappearance of the original logic for the set
 
 It eventually produced about 150 sets

 In normal operation, the engines are sealed and the gas does not enter or leave the engine
 duusare piston injanon ki tarah vaalvon kii aavashyaktaa yahaan nahin padati
 sterling ingine, adhiktar ushmiya injanon kii tarah chaar prakriyaaon: shitalan, sankuchan, taapan, evam prasaran kriya se gujarata he
 This is done by transferring the gas back and forth between the hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and coolant
 garam ushniya yantra bahya garmi ke saadhan jaise eendhan jwalak dwaara thermal ke sampark main rahata he evam sheethal ushniya yantra bahya garmi ke hauz jaise hawa ke pankhe ke dwaara thermal ke sampark main rahata he
 a change in the temperature of the gas will also change the pressure of the optimized gas while the motion of the piston leads to alternating dispersion and pressure of the gas
 gas, gas ke siddhant ke vyavhaar kaa paalan karata he jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise gasiy dabaav, taapmaana or aaytan se sambandhit hai
 When the gas is heated, as it is in a closed chamber, the pressure increases which then causes the power piston to produce a power stroke
 jab gas thanda hota he or dabaav kam hota he tab iske maane hote hai ki piston dwaara gas ko vaapasi ke chot ke dauraan kam kaary karnaa hoga, natijatan shuddh urja kaa utpaadan praapt hota he
 The process is slightly different when one corner of the piston is open to the atmosphere
 kyonki kriyasheel gas kaa band aaytan garam hisse ke sampark main aata he, vah failata he tathaa piston or vaataavaran donon par kriyasheel hota he
 When the working gas comes in contact with the cold part, its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes the piston which acts on the gas
 sankshep main sterling ingine garam hisse or thande hisse ke taapmaana ke antar kaa istemaal niyat gas ke thakke ke garam hone or failane, thande hone or dabane ki prakriya ko sthapit karne ke liye karata he, natijatan tapiya urja ko yantric urja main badla jaataa he
 The higher the temperature variation between the hot and cold sources, the higher the thermal efficiency
 pariklpit upyogita carnot kriya ke baraabar he parantu vaastavik injanon kii upyogita gharshan or nuksaan ke kaaran is maan se kam hota he
 Very low energy use engines have been built that can run at a temperature difference of at least 0
5 K
 aksar adhik urja vaale sterling injanon ke kriyasheel taral padaarth ke nunatam dabaav evam or ausat dabaav donon vaataavaran ke dabaav se adhik hote hai
 Initial engine pressure can be edited by a pump or by filling the engine with a compressed gas tank, or only by sealing the engine when the average temperature is below the average implementation temperature
 ye sabhi tareeke ushnata sambandhi kriya main kriyasheel taral padaarth ke thakke ko badha dete he
 All thermal devices should be sized in a proper way so that heat transfers at the required rate
 agar ushmiya yantra acchhee tarah se abhikalpit kiya gaya ho or sanvahneey taap antaran ke liye aavashyak taap pravaah ko pradaan kar saktaa he to ingine pratham sanniktan main ausat dabaav ke anupaat main urja utpann karne main sakasham hoga, jiskaa purvanumaan west sankhya or bial sankhya main kiya gaya he
 In practice, the maximum pressure is limited to the safe pressure of the vessel
 sterling ingine ke banaavat ke anya ayaamon ke saamaan, ishtatmakaran bahuvividh hota he or isamen adhiktar paraspar-virdohi aavashyaktaaen hoti hai
 At high temperatures and pressures, oxygen in air-tight winding vessels, or hot air in working engines, can explode, consisting of smooth oil of the engine
 kam se kam ek vyakti is visphot ke kaaran mara he
 Smoothies can also freeze in thermodynamics, especially regenerators
 in kaarnon kii vajah se hi nirmaataa gaiyr-chiknayee evam saste gharshan kii vastuon ko pasand karte hai jo ki purjon ke sthantharan main saamaanya bal kaa prayog karte hai, visheshkar seelon ke phisalane main
 kuch dizin aise hote hai jo sil kiye hue pistano ke liye phislan ko purna rup se rokane ke liye jhilli kaa istemaal karte hai
 These are some of the reasons why the Stirling engine requires less maintenance and has a longer lifespan than inter-combustion engines
 antar-dahan vaale injanon ke vipareet sterling ingine main navinikaran taap strot ko aasaani se istemaal karne, adhik aawaaj nahin karne or kam laagat ke kaaran zyada bharosemand hone kii kshamta hoti he
 They are more preferred in applications where these special benefits are respected, especially the cost per unit of energy generated is more important than the capital per unit
 is aadhaar par sterling ingine 100 kw
 tak pratispardhaatmak hota he
 Compared to inter-combustion engines equating to the same electric power, the Stirling engines currently incur higher capital costs and are mostly larger and heavier
 phir bhi ve adhiktar antar-dahan vaale injanon se zyada kushal hote hai
 Due to their low maintenance costs, all energy costs can be equated
 thermal upyogita kii bhi samanta kii ja sakati he, jo ki 15% se 30% main shreneebaddh he
 In applications such as micro-chp, the Stirling engine is preferred over inter-combustion
 duusare udhaaharan jal pump, antarikshayaniki or bijli kaa nirmaan he jo un prachur urja ke sansaadhan jaise saurya urja evam jaev eendhan jaise ki krishi apshisht or anya apshisht jaise paaltu jaanwaron kaa mel aadi kaa istemaal karte hai jo antar-dahan ke ingine ke saath kaam nahin kar pate
 sterling kaa istemaal sweden ke gotland class pandubbiyon main bhi kiya gaya he
 Yet the Stirling engine is not price-competitive compared to a motor-vehicle engine due to higher energy costs per unit, lower energy density, and higher component costs
 buniyadi vishleshan, closed-form shmit vishleshan par aadhaarit he
 The gas used must have a low heat capacity, so that the amount of transferred heat can create the maximum pressure
 is mudde ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apni nune taap kshamta ke kaaran helium sabase uttam gas hogi
 Air is the right working fluid, but oxygen can be quite deadly in a high-pressure engine that can explode with lubricating oil
 aise hi ek durghatana kaa adhyayan karte hue philips ne duusare gaison ke istemaal kaa pravartan kiya taaki aise visphot ke khataron ko roka ja sake
 If supplied in the form of mechanical energy, the Stirling engine can work in the opposite role of hot pump and cooling
 vaayu urja kaa istemaal sterling chakra hetu prayog kiya ja chukaa he jiskaa upyog ham pump ko gharelu taap or air-condishning ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In the late 1930s, Philips Corporation of the Netherlands successfully used the sterling verb for frost-borne applications

 In the second case, high-grade fuel is used for low temperature applications
 thermodynamiks ke duusare niyamanusaar ek ushmiya ingine is taapmaana ke antar se urja kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 In a CHP, high temperature primary heat enters the Stirling engine's heater, then some of the energy in the engine shifts to mechanical energy and passes through the rest of the coolant, where it is at a lower temperature
 "apshisht" taap ingine ke mukhya shitalk se aati he, yaa sambhawatah duusare sroton se jaise ki nikaas ke burner se, agar vah usamen he to
 In a combined heat and energy system, mechanical and electrical energy is produced by the normal process, although the waste heat received by the engine is supplied for another thermal application
 yah vaastavik rup main kuch bhi ho saktaa he jo nune taapmaana kii garmi kaa prayog karata he
 It is often the use of already existing energy, such as heating commercial places, residential water heating or industrial processes
 ingine dwaara nirmit urja kaa prayog audyogic or krishi sambandhi prakriya ko chalaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki jaev eendhan ke rup main punah agrahya shesh ke rup main praapt hota he, iskaa istemaal ingine ke liye nickshulk eendhan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki is shesh ko nikalne ke kharche ko kam kar detaa he
 This entire process can be useful and beneficial

 The outer corner of the portion of the dispersion can be placed inside an anti-thermal chamber, such as a thermal flask
 In effect, heat is pumped from this chamber by the working gas of the cryocooler in place of pressure
 dabaav kaa sthaan aasapaas ke taapmaana se upar hoga aise main garmi paryaavaran main pravaahit ho jaayegi
 One of their modern uses is in cryogenics and to a lesser extent in coolant
 At ideal cooling temperatures, Stirling coolers are generally less competitive in cost than mainstream Rankin coolers, because they use less energy

 Like any Stirling device, heat flows from the location of the dispersion to the location of the pressure, yet in the isolation of the Stirling engine the location of the dispersion is at a lower temperature than the location of the pressure, so the work product is replaced by a mechanical one
 Action needs to be incorporated into the system
 jab taap pump ke liye duusare ingine dwaara yantric kriya ko pradaan kiya jaataa he tab use "ushnata sanchalit garmi ke pump" kaa jaataa he

 The basis of theoretical chemistry is the correct knowledge of the nature of atoms and the properties of bonding between them
 parmaanu sambandhi aadhunik manyata ke aadi purush dalton maane jate hai
 But 600 years before Christ, Kanad Muni's conception of atoms, which is very long ago, surprisingly matches Dalton's concept
 kanad ne na keval parmaanuon ko tatwon kii aisi laghutam avibhajya ikai mana jinamein is tatv ke samast gun upasthit hote hai balki aisi ikai ko "parmaanu" naam bhi unhone hi diya tathaa yah bhi kaha ki parmaanu swatantra nahin rah sakate
 Kanad's notion of atomicity is rooted in his Vaishyasika formula
 kanad aage yah bhi kehete hai ki ek prakaar ke do parmaanu sanyukt hokar "dvinuk" kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This dichotomy seems to be the "venereal mucule" of today's chemists
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke parmaanu bhi aapas main sanyukt ho sakate hai
 Here kanads are definitely pointing towards chemical bonding
 vaisheshik sutara main parmaanuon ko satat gatisheel bhi mana gaya he tathaa dravya ke sangrakshan kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 These things are also compatible with modern beliefs
 rasinic bandhata ko or adhik spasht karte hue jain darshan main kaha gaya he ki kuch parmaanuon main snigdhata or kuch main "rukshata" ke gun hote hai tathaa aisi bhinn prakruti vaale parmaanu aapas main sahajata se sanyukt ho sakate hai jabaki samaan prakruti ke parmaanuon main saamanyat: sanyog kii pravriti nahin hoti
 It is as if the ionic bondage is being interpreted
 praayogic rasayan main kaam aane vaale upkarnon par bhi pracheen bhartiya rasayan shaastra main vistaar se charchaa hui he
 For chemical experiments and drug preparation, the chemists used 32 types of equipment in their laboratory, with the help of which all kinds of actions such as distillation, condensation, sublimation, liquefaction etc
 could be performed
 inamen se bahuton kaa vyavhaar aaj bhi aushadhi virachan ke liye vaidya kar rahe hai
 The layout of the laboratories is also described in the Rasratna set
 granthon main anek prakaar kii kundiyon, bhatthiyon, dhaunkaniyon evam crusibilon ke vishad vivaran uplabdh hai
 Their differences were due to their ability to provide suitable heat for metallurgical or chemical experiments

 For example, 2000 for Mahagajput, but only 8 dupils were required for the lowest heat generating Kapotput
 inke dwaara utpann tapon kii bhinnata aadhunik takneekee dwaara siddh ho chuki he
 For more than 9000 heat, Vagbhata has described four furnaces - Angarkoshthi, Patalakoshthi, Gorkoshthi and Mushkoshthi

 By the 18th century, many British observers were so impressed with the ironworks and furnaces here that they wrote in detail about some of the iron making processes and sent them to England
 james franklin naamak britani ne bhartiya bhatthiyon or lauhanirmaan ke prayek paksh ke bare main vistaar se likhaa tha
 He has finally asked, "can any other furnace in the world compete with these furnaces?" Likewise, Madras-based Assistant Surveyor General Captain J
 Cambell wrote, "from what i have seen of Indian iron, the worst iron in India is like the best iron in England
 " The fame of ancient India in the world in the field of chemistry has been mainly for its metallurgical skills

 In Sanskrit literature, a proper description of the cinnabar ores of Parad and the Calabar ores of zinc are available
 arthshaastra main hi anekon ayskon main mishrit carbonic ashuddhiyon se mukti kii kriya bhi varnit he
 For this, there is a law to decompose by heating at high temperature
 acarbonic ashuddhiyon se mukti ke liye rasaratna samucchy main ayask ke saath bahr padaarth, flux ko milakar or is mishran ko garm kar unhen dhaatumal ke rup main alag kar dene kaa vidhaan he
 These fluxes have been found at all excavation sites of metalworking

 Wagbhatta has also recommended the use of the other three furnaces - Angaarchasti, Mushchasti and Garkoshthi
 vagbhatta ne hi louh dhaatukarm ke liye bharjan evam nispathan kriyaaon kaa bhi sangopang varnan kiya he
 Hingul was used for the disposal of iron ore and shallow brewery has been recommended for filling, which is purely scientific

 Surprisingly, six types of carbonized steel are mentioned in the Rasratna set
 brihatt samhita main lohe ke carbonikaran kii vidhi sampoorn rup se varnit he
 It is a historical fact that in the world copper metalworking first started in India
 mehrgarh ke utkhanan main tambe ke 8000 varsh puraane namoonay mili hai
 In the excavation itself, the remains of copper-fired furnaces have also been found and evidence of the separation of iron in the form of iron silicate using flux has also been found
 nagarjun ke rasaratnakar main ayask sinabar se paarad ko praapt karne kii aswan vidhi varnit he
 a similar method is also given in the Rasratna set and Sushruta and Charaka codes and the Dhenki device is recommended for distillation

 Apparently, the impurities of the bones acted as calcium flux and separated the impurities in the form of calcium silicate slag
 aaj bhi aadharbhoot prakriya yahi he yadhyapi calcium ko jaivik shrot ke rup main na prayog kar acarbonic yogic ke rup main milaayaa jaataa he
 Specific flora has been recommended for the reduction of cassiterite oxidized wood ore, which used to act as a source of carbon

 gailena ayask, jo rajat or sise kaa ek prakaar kaa elaay he, ko to bina baahar se sisa milaae hi galaaye jane kaa vidhaan he
 This method is surprisingly similar to today's cuflation method

 It is visible that the use of skull in place of iron latch is described in Kautilya's time
 yahaan yah khopadi bhi sanrandhra padaarth kaa hi kaary karti thi, jisamen sisa avashoshit ho jaataa hoga
 Kautilya has written that gold can be obtained in native form from the water or rocks of rivers

 It is also recommended to purify with lead which does not have any place in today's method
 china kii 1911 kii kranti ke falswaroop china ke antim rajvansh kii samaapti hui or chini ganatantr bana
 It was a very big event
 manchu logon kaa shashan china par pichley teen sau varshon se chalaa aa rahaa tha jiskaa ant ho gaya
 China was the first country in Asia in the twentieth century, where a democratic government was established
 china ke krantikariyon ne fransavaalon kaa anukaran kiya or rajtantr kaa sadaa ke liye ant kar diya
 China has always considered itself the best nation in the international world
 kintu do opium yudhon main paraajay ke baad china kaa sara atmabhimaan or garv girakar chakanachur ho gaya
 When European robbers forcefully opened the door to China and ever since, a fierce race started in various European countries to establish economic dominance over China
 china ke kuch deshbhakt naagarik apane desh kii is durdasha se bahut chintit rahete the
 They understood that until they get rid of foreigners, there will be no improvement in their condition
 ve manchu-shashan ko chini janata kaa videshiyon dwaara shoshan ke liye mukhya rup se uttaradaayi maanate the
 So they started forming their own organization to oppose foreigners and to end Manchu-rule
 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant main videshiyon dwaara shoshan is kadar bad gaya ki china kii janata ke samaksh videshi shoshan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye ab ek vyapak kranti ke sivaa koi doosraa vikalp na rahaa
 In such a situation, there is a way to save the country from revolution - improvement in governance
 china main sudhaaron ke liye kuch dinon se andolan ho rahaa tha, lekin samraji tjushi ek pratikriyaavaadi shasika thi or vah shashan vyavastha main kisi tarah kaa parivartan nahin chaahati thi
 In this condition the patriots of China were forced to think that a new revolutionary government should be established by ending Manchu-rule
 videshi shoshan ke desh kii raksha ke liye yahi ekmaatr upaay tha
 After the Boxer Rebellion, Chinese reformists forced the regime to implement some reform schemes
 isliye china main sudhaaron kii ek yojana lagu kii gai
 Many reforms were made in the organization of the army
 1905 i
 main china kii puraani pariksha paddati samaapt karne kii ajna jari kii gai or chini shashantantr ko aadhunik dhang par dhaalane kaa ytn kiya gaya
 The victory of Japan in Russia and Japan's war also gave a substantial boost to the reformist movement in China
 aisi sthiti main china main sudhaar andolan ne teevr rup dhaaran kar liya, lekin sarkaar kii ore se sudhaar-kaary atyant dhimi gati se karyanvit kiye ja rahe the
 The reformists wanted parliamentary rule and the establishment of a legitimate state in China
 kintu sarkaar ne sansadeey vyavastha kaayam karne kii maang thukraa di
 In this condition, revolution became inevitable
 china kii nai peedi main jaagran china kii kranti kaa ek aadharbhoot kaaran tha
 In 1905, the ancient examination system and state system came to an end in China and modern education was given importance for appointment to state posts
 isliye, 1905 i
 ke baad bahut se chini vidhyaarthee america or europe jane lage, lekin jo log europe yaa america nahin ja sakate the, ve japan main hi shiksha praapt karne lage
 In this way, Chinese people got in touch with foreign countries
 ve europe, america aadi deshon se bahut prabhavit hue or apane desh ke uddhaar ke liye paashchaatya deshon ke namoonay par sudhaar ke pakshpaati ho gaye
 At this time, there were many Chinese patriots living in Japan who were angry with the Chinese government and who were expelled from the country
 japan main in logon ke krantikari sanghathan kaayam kar liye the
 The Chinese students who went to Japan were essentially related to these revolutionary organizations and were filled with revolutionary ideas when they returned home
 1908 i
 main jo chini krantikari netaa japan main aashray grahan karne ke liye vivash hue the, ve in chini vidhyaarthiyon main bade utsaah se apane vichaaron kaa prasar kar rahe the
 Due to the influence of Japan, the tendency to strengthen the country and modernize the society was gaining momentum
 faltah, logon ke dimag main nae vichaar bhar gaye, jinhone kranti kii chinagaariyaan sulagaa deen
 The economic plight was another cause of China's revolution
 aarthik drushti se china kii janata main ghor ashaanti thi
 China's population was growing very fast and the government was not able to arrange its food
 desh main durbhiksh or baadhon kii prachurtaa thi, jiske kaaran kheti ko bahut adhik nuksaan pahunchataa tha
 In 1910-11, several rivers of China were severely flooded
 isse krishi to nasht hui saath hi sahasron gaanv bhi bah gaye
 Millions of people became homeless and had no means of livelihood
 sarkaar ne is sthiti main janata kii sahaayta kaa koi prabandh nahin kiyaan is tarah kii aarthik sthiti main kranti ke vichaaron kaa aana bilkul swaabhaavik tha
 Frustrated by the country's economic situation, the Chinese people started migrating abroad in search of livelihood
 sabase pehle ve sanyukt rajya america gaye
 The US government did not oppose it for a few days, but when Chinese people started reaching America in large numbers, the government made a law and stopped their arrival
 jab america kaa darwaja chiniyon ke liye band ho gaya to ve paas-pados ke anya desh malaya, philippins, hawaii dweep ityadi main jaakar basane lage
 Thus, a large section of the Chinese public came into contact with foreign countries
 yah bhaag padhe-likhe logon se bhinn tha or iske dwaara china ke nimna varg main kranti kii bhaavana ne pravesh kiya
 In the first decade of the twentieth century, the emphasis of revolutionary trends increased in China and the organization of revolutionary parties was widespread
 boxr vidroh ke daman ke baad china ke kai krantikari dal nasht kar die gaye the, phir bhi china main kranti kii bhaavana kabhi dabaai nahin ja saki
 Soon after the Boxer Rebellion, revolutionary parties began to organize in China again
 in krantikari sanghathanon main ek atyant mahatvapurn tha, jiskaa netaa dow sanyaat sen tha
 Dr
 Sun Yat Sen had a very important contribution in organizing the Chinese revolutionaries
 1884-85 i
 ke bich china ko france ke mukaable bada apmaan sahanaa padaa or ve sab milakar manchu rajvansh ke ant kii yojana banane lage
 Eventually, he proved to be the father of the Chinese Revolution
 1900 i
 ke boxr vidroh ke asafal hone par dow sen kii lokapriyata punah kaayam ho gai or chini log adhikadhik sankhya main uski ore aakrisht hone lage
 After these events, Sanayat Sen's fame increased significantly
 1911 i
 ke purv sahi picking kii kendriya sarkaar ke viruddh prantiy shaskaon main virodh kii bhaavana viksit ho rahi thi
 Several foreign firms were getting railway lines constructed in China after obtaining permission from the government of picking
 china ke kai praantapati chaahate the ki unke suubon main unhen hi railway line kaa nirmaan kaa adhikaar mili
 However, the government of picking did not want this
 vah swayan railway linon kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahati thi
 However, he lacked funds for this
 china kii sarkaar videshon se karj lekar is kaam ko puraa karnaa chaahati thi
 The influence of foreigners on China's central government was increasing due to taking foreign loans
 is kaaran praanton ke shaasha bade chintit ho rahe the or is baat par jor de rahe the ki unke apane pradeshon main railway nirmaan kaa bhaar unheen ke supurd kar diya jaae
 On this subject, differences between the Central and Provincial governments increased greatly
 praanton main kendriya shashan kii niti ke kaaran asantosh bahut garh gaya or isi samay jab ek videshi company ko ek railway line banane kaa adhikaar de diya gaya to kranti kii lahar chaaron ore fail gai
 Revolts against Manchu rule started at many places
 vidroh kii aag turant hi sampurna desh main fail gai
 The flame of revolution quickly spread up, down and southwards on the Yangtze coast
 dakshin main kuch samay ke liye shatung praant ne apni swatantraaa ghoshit kar di, yadhyapi vah sheeghra hi punah kendriya shashan ke adheen aa gaya
 a sense of rebellion spread, especially among the soldiers, in Chihali, but all the provinces, except Shansi province north of Yangtse, remained loyal to the central government and the rule remained strong there
 puraa andolan ekaek or swatantra rup se hue vidroh kii shrinkhalaa lagata tha, suniyojit kranti nahin
 One reason for this was that the revolutionaries first wanted to instill revolutionary sentiments in various centers
 in chhitput vidrohon kaa ek doosraa kaaran yah bhi tha ki kranti ke samarthakon ke gut anivarytah sthaneey str par banaae gaye the, rashtriya str par nahin or unki yojanaayen bhi sthaneey staron par bani thim
 It was also claimed that there was a plan to revolt all revolutionary groups together at a later date, but it became imperative to revolt due to bombings in the units and subsequent police action
 in ghatnaon se picking main ghabrahat fail gai
 The government appointed Yuan Shieh Kai as governor of Hoopel and Hunan
 usne yah pad sanbhaalane ke pehle shart rakhi ki agle saal sansad kii baithak bulaai jaaegi, uske prati uttaradaayi mantrimandal banaaya jayega
 The revolutionary party will be recognized and will be given full authority to reorganize the army
 27 oktober ko yuan ko sab senaaon kaa ucchadhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, on 22 October 1911, he called a meeting of the Central Legislative Assembly
 vidhansabha is samay manchu raja se sudhaar karne kaa prastaav kar rahi thi
 He demanded that the office bearers who are supporters of foreigners be ousted
 manchu raja ko baadhya hokar aisa karnaa padaa or videshiyon ke samarthak sabhi ragadhikariyon ko padchyut kar diya gaya
 This was undoubtedly a massive victory for Lokmat
 is samay badi aavashyaktaa is baat kii thi ki shashansutra kaa sanchaalan ek yogya vyakti ko diya jaae, jo avyavashtha or vidroh kaa daman kar desh main shanti kii sthapana kare
 This task was awarded to Yuan Shih Kai
 1 navambar, 1911 i
 ko use pradhanmantri ke pad par niyukt kar diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly prepared a constitution of nineteen sections, which was intended to establish a legal monarchy in China
 16 navambar ko yuan shih kaai ne apni sarkaar bana lee
 When the revolution exploded in China, Dr
 Sanayat Sen was in America
 24 disamabar ko vah shanghai pahunchaa
 He was welcomed by all the revolutionaries as a man away from factionalism and it was hoped that he would provide the right leadership to the unity of the revolution
 29 disambar ko krantikariyon ne use apni sarkaar kaa adhyaksh chun liya
 Representatives of sixteen provinces out of seventeen provinces took office on January 1, 1912
 Assumed him on the post of president
 is prakaar, ab china main do sarkarein ho gai
 One is the Democratic Government of Nanking and the other is the Manchu Government of Picking
 manchu sarkaar puri tarah yuan shih par ashrith thi
 The negotiations to hold Yuan Xih Kai to the presidency came to an end with the formation of Sanayat Sen's revolutionary government
 isse krantikari sarkaar or picking sarkaar ke bich chal rahi baatcheet kaa taar tuutane laga
 The Manchu government decided to crush the Nanking government
 lekin, ise liye uske paas shakti nahin thi
 Dr
 Sanayat Sen also felt that it is useless to continue the war with the Central Government
 donon paksh thake-maande the
 They all lacked money, leadership and unity
 saath hi, videshi hastkshep kaa bhi bhay tha
 That is why negotiations between the two governments of China began
 krantikari sarkaar ke netaaon kaa vichaar tha ki china ke navnirmaan tathaa uddhaar ke liye manchu rajvansh kaa ant hona aavashyak he; kyonki manchu darbar itnaa vikrut ho chukaa he ki usamen navajivan kaa sanchaar karnaa asambhav he
 Yuan Shih Kai accepted this and based on this, he entered into an agreement with Dr
 Sanyat Sen on 12 February 1912
 is samjhaute ke anusaar china se manchu rajvansh ke shashan kaa ant kar diya gaya or china main ganraajya kii sthapana kar di gai

 MCC is a private club based in London, England and Abu is not the official managing body of the sport; However, MCC retains the copyright to the rules of the game and only MCC can change these rules, although nowadays it is generally done only after consultation with the International Cricket Council, the game's global regulatory body
 
 'cricket un gine-chune khelon main se ek he jiske liye niamak siddhanton ko 'niyamon' yaa 'viniyamon' kii bajaay 'kaanoon' ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 However regulations may be agreed to supplement and / or vary the laws for special competitions

 The earliest rules were also framed in the context of regulating the game of big money stakes
 sabase praarambhik maujuuda cricket kii samhita kuch khaas 'amiron or sajjanon' dwaara taiyaar kii gayi thi jinhone 1744 main landan main artilari ground kaa prayog kiya tha
 There are other references to the rules being amended in 1755 by the "star and Garter in various cricket clubs, particularly the Pal Maal", followed by the "star and Garter" in 1774 and the rich of Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London and An amendment to the rules was made by "a committee of gentlemen"
 niyamon kaa ek mudrit swaroop 1775 main prakashit kiya gaya tha or iske baad kanoon main ek or sanshodhan kaint, hampshire, saare, sasex, middlesex or landan ke ek samaan nikaay dwaara 1786 main kiya gaya tha
 However these rules were not universally followed when different matches were played under different guidance
 30 may 1788 ko marilibone cricket club, jiskaa gathan sirf ek saal pehle is khel ko khilne vaale pramukh amiron or sajjanon dwaara kiya gaya tha, isane niyamon kii apni pehali samhita taiyaar kii thi
 While the MCC version of the rules was not immediately fully accepted or implemented with consistency, it is the subsequent version of these rules that governs today's game
 1809 main aglaa bada badlaav gend ke vajan kaa aglaa maanakeekaran 5 or 6 ounce se lekar 5
5 or 5
75 ounce tak karne ke rup main dekha gaya or cricket ke balle kii chaudaai ko pehali baar manakikrut kiya gaya
 The rule of scoring runs on the ball involving non-striker stumps was made redundant and the length of the stumps was increased from 22 to 24 inches and the length of the gillies by 6 to 7 inches to help bowlers and the importance of the umpires and more Was increased
 antat ballebaaj ko out karne kii ek nai paddati shuru kii gai thi
 Earlier, as a hard ball was used in cricket and leg-pads were not used, players naturally played with their feet away from the wicket
 jab ballebaajon ne pad pahananaa shuru kar diya, ve gend ko stamps par lagane se rokane or unhen gendbaaji karne ke kram main apane pairon se apane stump ko cover karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Therefore, a "leg before wicket" rule was introduced so that any batsman who tries to stop the ball from his feet on the stump will be out
 1829 main stump kii lambaai ko 24 se 27 inch se badha diya gaya or gilliyon kii lambaai 7 se 8 inch se badha di gayi, jo ek baar phir gendbaajon kii madad ke liye tha
 Stump thickness was first mentioned
 19 may 1835 ko emsisi samiti dwaara niyamon kii ek nayi samhita ko manjuuri di gayi or 21 april 1884 ko duusari samhita manjuur kii gayi
 The number of players was formalized for the first time in the 1884 rules and the size of the ball was also formalized for the first time
 phir follow-on niyam pesh kiya gaya tha
 This was done in response to a problem in which a team needed to get out its opposition team twice in order to win a game
 ek aisi team jisane pehle ballebaaji kii he or us match main bahut adhik ran banaakar puri tarah se apni pakad bana lee he use tab tak intjaar karnaa padataa tha jab tak ki use duusari baar out nahin kar diya jaataa isse pehle ki yah vipakshi team ko duusari baar out karne kii koshish kar sake
 Since cricket is a limited-time sport, this means that the team that dominates their opposition team may be forced to end the game rather than win
 praarambhik follow-on kaa niyam doshapurn tha kyonki iske liye jab ek team peeche rah jaati thi to use follow-on karnaa padataa tha
 a team could have intentionally lost their final wickets of the first innings in return for being able to bowl at the end on a deteriorating pitch
 baad main follow-on niyam ko badal diya gaya jise ki koi team jo apni vipakshi team se paryaapt rup se aage hai uske paas yah vikalp he ki ise lagu kiya jaae yaa nahin
 On 7 May 1947, a new code was approved by the MCC

 This is known as the 1980 code

 In 1992 a second version of the 1980 code was prepared
 san 2000 main ek nayaa code, jisamen pehali baar cricket kii bhaavana ko paribhaashit karne vaali ek prastaavna shaamil kii gayi thi, ise 3 may ko manjuuri di gayi
 This code was rewritten in simple English and is far more logical than the previous code

 In 2003, a second version of the 2000 Code was drafted which incorporated the amendments arising from the enactment of the 2000 Code
 gend phenkane ko sabase pehle 1829 main taiyaar kanoonon main viniyamit kiya gaya tha
 For the first time in 1860, bowling of underarm was allowed
 1889 main ek over kii lambaai chaar gendon se badhaakar paanch gendon kii kar di gayi
 In 1900, the length of an over was increased to six balls
 1922 main over kii lambaai main bhinnata kii anumati di gai 
 1947 ke code main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya ki captainon ke bich "purv samjhaute" ke anusaar ek over kii lambaai chah yaa aath gendon kii hogi

 Similarly, every cricket playing country has implemented the terms of the game to control domestic cricket
 ye niyam ek divasiy yaa simit over ke cricket ke liye yah nirdhaarit karte hue praavdhaan karata he ki prati team pariyon kii sankhya ek yaa do hogi or yah ki prayek pari overon kii ek adhiktam sankhya yaa ek adhiktam samay avadhi tak simit ho sakati he
 These rules retain Imperial units as they were originally specified, but now include metric conversions
 niyamon ko ek bhoomika, ek prastaavna, bayalis kanoonon or chaar parishishton main vyavasthit kiya gaya he
 The role is related to the history of Marylibon Cricket Club and rules
 prastaavna ek nayaa sangyojan he or yah "khel kii bhaavana" se sambandhit he; isaki shuruyaat asajjanatapurna aacharan ke badhati prachalanon ko rokane kii koshish main kii gayi thi
 Eight amendments were made to the rules which were drafted on 30 September 2010 to deal with poor lighting, toss, cricket spirit, practice sessions, agility in fielding and rare cases of dismissals and came into force from 1 October 2010

 Return creases, which are the lines within which the bowler must remain while throwing the ball, should be drawn at each end of each set of stumps on either side of the pitch
 The return creases are located perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease is parallel to the imaginary line connecting the centers of both middle stumps and 4 feet 4 inches on either side
 prayek ritern krij ek chor par popping krij par samaapt hota he lekin duusare chor kii lambaai aseemit maani jaati he or ise popping krij se kam se kam 8 feet par chihnit kiya janaa chahie
 Rule 10: Construction and maintenance of the playing field In cricket, when a ball is bowled it always bounces on the pitch and the way the ball will behave depends largely on the position of the pitch
 isliye swayan pich par vistrut niyamon kaa hona jaruri he
 This rule sets the conditions that govern how to prepare pitches, how to cut grass and how to roll
 niyam 11: pich ko cover karnaa pich ko cover karnaa is baat ko prabhavit karata he ki is par bouns karte samay gend kii pratikriya kisi hogi
 For example, a ball bouncing on a wet ground will react differently than a ball bounced on dry ground
 niyam yah nirdhaarit karata he ki pich ko cover karne ke viniyamon par pehle se sahmati bana lee jaani chahie
 The bowler's run-up should also be dry so that his chances of slipping are reduced
 Therefore, wherever possible, these need to be covered in the rules in the event of moist weather
 niyam 12 se 17 khel kii sanrachana kii ruparekha taiyaar karte hai
 Rule 12: Shift
 Prior to the game, teams agree on whether it should end in an innings or two innings and whether one or both innings will be limited by time and overs
 In practice, these decisions are likely to be determined by competition regulations rather than pre-game agreements
 do-pariyon ke khelon main donon paksh baari-baari se ballebaaji karte hai jab tak ki follow-on ke liye majaboor nahin kiya jaataa he
 An innings ends after all the batsmen have been dismissed, if no other batsman is fit to play, the innings is declared or its right is lost by the batting captain or when there is an agreed time or over

 Rule 17: Practice on the field
 There can be no batting or bowling practice on the pitch except before the start of the day's play and after the end of the day's play
 gendbaaj keval ran-ap kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai agar ampiron kaa maananaa he ki isse koi samay barbaad nahin hoga

 Once the ball is idle, no runs can be scored and no batsman can be dismissed
 gend kai kaarnon se bekaar ho jaataa he jisamen sabase adhik aam taur par jab ek ballebaaj out hota he, jab ek chaukaa maaraa jaataa he yaa jab gend antat gendbaaj yaa wicketiper ke paas pahunch jaataa he
 Rule 24: no-ball
 a ball can be a no ball for several reasons: if the bowler bowls from the wrong place; Or if he straightens his elbow while throwing the ball; Or if the bowling is dangerous; Or if the ball bounces more than two times or slides along the ground before reaching the batsman; Or if fielders are standing in illegal places
 ek no-ball is par banaae gaye anya ranon ke alaava ballebaaji karne vaali team ke score main ek atirikt ran jod detaa he or ballebaaj ko ran out ke jariye out karne, yaa gend kii handlling ke jariye, gend ko do baar maarane, yaa field ko baadhit karne ke alaava kisi bhi no-ball se out nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Rule 25: Wide ball umpire calls a ball "wide" if in his opinion the batsman did not have a fair chance of scoring from that ball
 kisi gend ko wide tab kaha jaataa he jab gendbaaj ek aisa bounsar phenkata he jo ballebaaj ke sir ke upar se guzar jaataa he
 Apart from any other runs scored on a wide ball, it adds one more run to the batting team's score and the batsman cannot be dismissed on a wide ball except that he is not run out or trumped out
 Go or he may not get out by handling the ball, hitting his wicket, or obstructing the field
 niyam 26: by or leg by
 agar koi gend jo ek no-ball yaa wide nahin he vah striker ke saamne se guzar jaataa he or us par ran banaae jate hai to use by ran kaha jaataa he

 haalanki leg-by ran us sthiti main nahin banaae ja sakate hai agar striker na to stroke lagane kaa prayaas karata he or na hi apane ko maare jane se bachane kii koshish karata he
 Byes and leg byes are added to the team's runs but not to the batsman's total runs
 niyam 27 se 29 tak un pramukh prakriyaaon kaa zikr karte he jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kisi ballebaaj ko kaise out kiya ja saktaa he
 Rule 27: Appeal
 If fielders believe the batsman is out, they can ask the umpire "how is that?", Usually by shouting loudly with both hands up, before throwing the next ball
 uske baad ampire yah faisla lete hai ki ballebaaj out he yaa nahin
 Strictly stated, the fielding side should appeal to be dismissed in all respects, including clear cases like boldness
 haalanki ek ballebaaj jo jaahir taur par out he vah kisi apil ke liye yaa ampire ke faisle kaa intjaar kiye bina saamaanya rup se pich ko chhod degaa
 Rule 28: The wicket is down
 out hone ke kai tareeke hote hai jab wicket ko neeche gira diya jaataa he

 The batsman can be run out or stumped out if he is out of his place
 ballebaaj apane sthaan par he, lekin agar uskaa yaa uske balle kaa koi bhaag popping krij ke peeche jameen par he
 If both the batsmen are in the middle of the pitch while the wicket is dropped, then the batsman who is close to that end is dismissed
 niyam 30 se 39 tak un vibhinn tareekon par charchaa karte hai jinke jariye kisi ballebaaj ko out kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from these 10 methods, the batsman can retire and go out
 yah praavdhaan niyam 2 main he
 Of these, catch out is usually the most common method followed by the number of bowled out, leg before wicket, run out and stumped out
 out hone ke anya swaroop bahut hi durlabh hai
 Rule 30: Bold
 a batsman is out in that situation if a ball thrown by the bowler drops his wicket
 yah apraasangik he ki wicket ko neeche giraane ke liye aage badhane se pehle gend ne balle, dastaane yaa ballebaaj ke kisi bhaag ko chuaa he, haalanki aisa karne se pehle yah kisi anya khilaadi yaa ampire ko chuaa nahin ho saktaa he

 The "body" also includes clothes and batter equipment
 niyam 36: leg bifor wicket 
 agar gend pehle balle se takaraae bina ballebaaj ko lag jaati he, lekin agar ballebaaj vahaan nahin hota to vah gend wicket ko lag jaati or agar gend wicket ke leg said par pich nahin karti he to ballebaaj out ho jayega

 The five appendices of the rule are as follows: mamata shankar ek bhartiya abhinetri he
 He is known for his work in Bengali cinema
 unka janm 7 janvari 1955 main nartkiyon udai shankar or amala shankar ke ghar hua tha
 She was the niece of Pandit Ravi Shankar
 or unka bhai anand shankar ek indo-western fusion sangeetkaar tha
 He has acted in films of directors like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Rituparna Ghosh, Buddhadev Dasgupta and Gautam Ghosh
 ek abhinetri hone ke alaava, vah ek nrutyaangna or koreographer he
 Mamta Shankar made her career debut in 1976 with the film Mrrigaya, directed by Mrinal Sen and the film also won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film for the year
 mamata shankar ne 1986 main ek mamata shankar dance company- udyaan chalaai jo puure vishwa main vyapak rup se yatra karata he, jisamen 'mamata shankar baile trup' bhi shaamil he
 Wisdom is the mental power that helps in understanding things and facts, finding interrelations between them and gaining rational knowledge
 yah 'bhaavana' or antavpragna se alag he
 Wisdom helps man to understand and adapt to new situations properly
 buddhi ko 'soochna ke prasanskaran kii yogyata' kii tarah bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 Wisdom has been the subject of discussion in cognitive activities since ancient times
 kaha jaataa he ki, 'buddhiryasy balantsya' arthath jisamen buddhi he vahi balavaan he
 Human being is considered superior to other beings because of intelligence
 manovigyaan ke kshetra main bhi buddhi charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 Since thousands of years ago, people were divided into different classes on the basis of intelligence
 kuch vyakti budhimaan kehalaate hai, kuch kam buddhi ke, kuch mooth buddhi ke to kuch jad buddhi kehalaate hai
 But it is very difficult to understand the nature of intelligence
 buddhi ke swaroop par pracheen kaal se hi matbhed chale aa rahe hai tathaa aaj bhi manovaigyanikon tathaa shikshavidon ke liye bhi buddhi vaad-vivaad kaa vishay bana hua he
 From the latter part of the 19th century, psychologists started making efforts to understand the nature of the intellect, but they were not successful in it and could not give a unanimous definition of intelligence
 vartmaan main bhi buddhi ke swaroop ke sambandh main manovaigyanikon ke vichaaron main asamanta he
 Different psychologists defined the nature of intelligence differently
 manovaigyanikon ne buddhi kii paribhaashaon ko teen virgon main rakhaa he- The way the intellect is defined under these three classes is mentioned as follows: is prakaar kii vichaardhaara ko maanane vaale manovaigyanik terman, ambigas, staoot, bart galton stern aadi hai
 According to these psychologists, intelligence is the common ability of a person, which is found in every action
 in manovaigyanikon ne buddhi kii paribhaasha is prakaar prastut kii he- Therefore, according to Terman, intelligence is the ability to solve problems
 is prakaar kii vichaardhaara ko maanane waalon main stenford bine kaa naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 According to Binay, intelligence is the ability and ability of reasoning, judgment and self-criticism
 buddhi ke is varg kii paribhaashaon ke antargat manovaigyanikon ne vibhinn prakaar kii vishisht yogyataon ke yoga ko buddhi kii sangya di he
 Those who hold these views are Thorndike, Thurston, Thomson, Wessler and Stoddard
 situations
) economy adaptations to a goal social value and commergence of originals under such conditions that demand aconcentration of energy and resistance to emotional forces
) buddhi ke swaroop evam buddhi ke siddhanth - donon hi buddhi ke vishay ke bare main vichaar prakat karte hai parantu phir bhi donon main bhinnata drushtigat hoti he
 The principles of the intellect make its structure clear while the forms throw light on its functions
 gat shatabdi ke pratham dashak se hi vibhinn deshon ke manovaigyanikon main is baat kii ruchi badi kii buddhi kii sanrachana kisi he tathaa isamen kin-kin karkon kaa samavesh he
 As a result of these questions, the structure of intelligence started to be explained on the basis of various factors
 america ke tharston, tharnadik, thomson aadi manovaigyanikon ne karkon ke aadhaar par 'buddhi ke swaroop' vishay main apane-apane vichaar vyakt kiye
 Similarly, Alfred Binne in France, Spearmen in Britain also presented their ideas about the nature of intelligence
 is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan france ke manovaigyanik alfred bine ne 1911 main kiya tathaa america ke manovaigyanik terman tathaa germany ke manovaigyanik ambigas ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 According to this theory, intelligence is the power that affects all mental functions
 is siddhanth ke anuyaayiyon ne buddhi ko samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karne vaali ek shakti ke rup main mana he
 They have also believed that intelligence is a holistic form and leads a person to do a specific task
 yah ek ekatv kaa khand he jiskaa vibhaajan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory, if a person is proficient in one particular area then he will be proficient in other areas also
 isi ek kaarkiya siddhanth ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bine ne buddhi ko vyakhya-nirnay kii yogyata mana he
 Terman considered this an ability to consider, and Stern considered it an ability to adjust to new circumstances
 is siddhanth ke pravartak britain ke prasiddh manovaigyanik spear main hai
 He proposed this two-element theory of intelligence based on his experimental studies and experiences
 unke matanusaar buddhi do shaktiyon ke rup main he yaa buddhi kii sanrachana main do kaarak hai
 He called one of these 'general intelligence' and the other factor as 'specific intelligence'
 saamaanya kaarak se unka taatpary yah he ki sabhi vyaktiyon main kaary karne kii ek saamaanya yogyata hoti he
 Therefore, each person can do some work to some extent
 ye kaary uski saamaanya buddhi ke kaaran hi hote hai
 Common factor is found in the whole mental and intellectual activities of a person, but it occurs in different quantities
 buddhi kaa yah saamaanya kaarak janmajaat hota he tathaa vyaktiyon ko safalataa kii ore ingit karata he
 The particular actions of a person are by a particular factor of intelligence
 yah kaarak buddhi kaa vishisht kaarak kehalaata he
 a specific factor of intelligence works in one type of specific action, then another specific factor in another action
 atah bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii vishisht kriyaaon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vishisht karkon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 These specific factors vary from person to person
 isi kaaran vaiyaktik bhinnataayen pai jaati hai
 Common factors of intelligence are innate while specific factors are mostly acquired
 buddhi ke is do-kaarak siddhanth ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii maansik kriyaaon main buddhi ke saamaanya kaarak kaary karte hai jabaki vishisht maansik kriyaaon main vishisht karkon ko swatantra rup se kaam main liya jaataa he
 a single action of a person requires one or several specific factors
 parantu prayek maansik kriya main us kriya se sambandhit vishisht kaarak ke saath-saath saamaanya kaarak bhi aavashyak hote hai
 For example, general factors are considered important for knowing and understanding subjects like general science, social studies, philosophy and science studies, while specific factors are mainly to know and understand specific subjects like mechanical, handicraft, art, music arts
 Is required
 isse spasht he ki kisi vishesh vishay yaa kala ko seekhney ke liye donon karkon kaa hona atyant anivaary he
 Spearman, in 1904, revised the doctrine of intelligence by amending the doctrinal principle of his former intellect and proposing the fundamental principle of intelligence
 buddhi ke jis tisare kaarak ko unhone apane siddhanth main joda use unhone 'samooh kaarak' kaha
 Therefore, there are three factors in this theory of intelligence - sammilit kiye gayi hai
 In Spearman's view, in addition to general and specific factors, group factors also co-exist in all mental activities
 kuch vishesh yogyataayen jaise yantric yogyata, aankik yogyata, shabdic yogyata, sangeet yogyata, smriti yogyata, taarkik yogyata tathaa bauddhik yogyata aadi ke sanchaalan main samooh kaarak bhi vishesh bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The group factor itself does not have an independent existence in itself, but rather it forms its own group with a mixture of various specific factors and common factors
 isiilie ise samooh kaarak kaha gaya he
 According to psychologists, there is no novelty in this theory
 tharnadike jaise manovaigyanikon ne is siddhanth kii aalochana karte hue kaha he ki samooh kaarak koi naveen kaarak nahin he apitu yah saamaanya evam vishisht karkon kaa mishran maatr he
 Thornadike in his theory considers intelligence to be a mixture of various factors
 jisamen kai yogyataayen nihit hoti hai
 According to him, for any mental function, various factors work together
 tharnadike ne purv siddhanton main prastut 'saamaanya karkon' kii aalochana kii or apane siddhanth main saamaanya karkon kii jagah mul karkon tathaa sarvanishtha karkon kaa ullekh kiya
 Basic factors include basic mental abilities
 ye yogyataayen jaise- shabdic yogyata, aankik yogyata, yantric yogyata, smriti yogyata, taarkik yogyata tathaa bhaashan dene kii yogyata aadi hai
 According to him these abilities affect all mental functions of a person
 tharnadike is baat ko bhi maanate hai ki har vyakti main koi na koi vishisht yogyata avashya paayi jaati he
 But he also believes that it is difficult to estimate one's ability from one subject to another
 jaise ki ek vyakti yantric kala main praveen he to yah aavashyak nahin ki vah sangeet main bhi nipun hoga
 According to him, when positive correlation is found in the rendering of two mental actions, then it also means that there are several factors in the person
 ye ubhaynishth kaarak kitni maatra main hai yah sahasambandh kii maatra se gyaat ho saktaa he
 According to Thurston's group factor theory, intelligence is neither the performance of common factors nor the various specific factors, but it has certain mental functions that are normally included in basic factors
 ye maansik kriyaayein samooh kaa nirmaan karti hai jo manovaigyanik evam kriyaatmak ekta pradaan karte hai
 Thurston presented his theory based on factor analysis
 unke anusaar buddhi kii sanrachana kuch moulik karkon ke samooh se hoti he
 Two or more basic factors combine to form a group that demonstrates a person's intelligence in a given area
 in moulik karkon main unhone aankik yogyata, pratyakshikaran kii yogyata, shabdic yogyata, daishik yogyata, shabd pravaah, tark shakti or smriti shakti ko mukhya mana
 Thurston made it clear that intelligence is a mixture of many types of abilities that are found in different groups
 unke anusaar maansik yogyataayen kriyaatmak rup se swatantra he phir bhi jab ye samooh main kaary karti he to unamem paraspar sambandh yaa samanta pai jaati he
 Some special abilities belong to the same group and there is correlation among them
 jaise vigyaan vishyon ke samooh main bhautik, rasayan, ganit tathaa jeev-vigyaan bhautikee evam rasayan aadi
 Similarly, there is a correlation between playing tabla, harmonium, sitar etc
 to showcase the musical art
 thomson ne buddhi ke pratidarsh siddhanth ko prastut kiya
 According to him, every work of a person is a reflection of certain abilities
 kisi bhi vishesh kaary ko karne main vyakti apni samast maansik yogyataon main se kuch kaa pratidarsh ke rup main chunaav kar letaa he
 In this theory, he has given importance to the practicality of common factors
 thomson ke anusaar vyakti kaa bauddhik vyavhaar anek swatantra yogyataon par nirbhar karata he parantu pariksha karte samay unka pratidarsh hi saamne aata he
 Raymond V
 Kettle describes two types of general intelligence
 ye hai flud tathaa crystallijd 
 According to him Fluid general merit of intelligence depends on hereditary factors while crystallized competence as earned factors
 flud saamaanya yogyata mukhya rup se samskruti yukt, gati-sthitiyon tathaa nai sthitiyon ke anukulata vaale pareekshanon main pai jaati he
 Crystallized general aptitude is measured as a factor in tests related to acquired cultural achievements, skills, and new status
 flud saamaanya yogyata ko sharir kii vanshanukram vibhakta ke rup main liya ja saktaa he jo jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon dwaara sanchalit hoti he
 While crystallized general competence is governed by social learning and environmental influences
 kettl ke anusaar flud saamaanya buddhi vanshanukram se sambindhat he tathaa janmajaat hoti he jabaki crystallijd saamaanya buddhi arjeet he
 Burt and Vernon proposed this theory
 buddhi siddhanton ke kshetra main yah naveen siddhanth mana jaataa he
 In this theory, Burt and Vernon have given gradual importance to mental abilities
 unhone maansik yogyataon ko do staron par vibhikt kiya- Even among the general mental abilities, he divided the abilities into two classes on the basis of levels
 pehle varg main unhone kriyaatmak, yantric evam shaareerik yogyataon ko rakhaa he
 He named this main square as km
 yogyataon ke duusare samooh main unhone shabdic, aankik tathaa shaikshik yogyataon ko rakhaa he or is samooh ko unhone v
ed
 naam diya he
 At the final level, he placed specific mental abilities that are related to various cognitive functions
 is siddhanth kii naveenta evam apni vishesh yogyataon ke kaaran kai manovaigyanikon kaa dhyaan isaki ore aakarshith hua he
 Guilford and his colleagues presented an explanation of intelligence structure based on three mental abilities
 gilford kaa yah buddhi sanrachana siddhanth tri-vimiya bauddhik model kehalaata he
 He has divided the intelligence factors into three categories, namely mental abilities into three dimensions
 ye hai- These three dimensions of intelligence differ substantially from factor analysis
 in sabake alaava buddhi kaa ek siddhanth he jise 'howard gardenar' ne pratipaadit kiya, ise bahubuddhi siddhanth kaha jaataa he
 According to this, every human being has a different type of intelligence, such as someone who can be proficient in music, someone in acting or writing, logical reasoning etc
 inhone buddhi ke is siddhanth ko samajhane ke liye ise aath kshetron me vibhajit kiya he jo is prakaar hai-1-bhashaagat2-taarkik-ganitiya3-deshik4-sangitatmak5-shaareerik-gatisanvedi6-antarvaiyaktik7-antah vyakti8-prakrutivaadee Gardner in his book "frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence" explains it very well in detail

 Since most state athletic commissions respect the restrictions imposed by other states, this made Tyson effectively unable to boxing in the United States
 The revocation was not permanent, since after a little more than a year, on October 18, 1998, the Commission restored Tyson's boxing license by voting 4–1
