 hamaari prithvi or surya jis gallexi main avasthit hai, raatri main ham nangi aankh se usee gallexi ke taaraon ko dekh pate hai
 So far, there are estimated to be about 19 billion galaxies in every part of the universe that has been detected

 a hundred billion galaxies exist in the universe
 jo badi maatra main taare, gas or khagoleey dhul ko samete hue he
 Galaxies began their lives millions of years ago and gradually regained their present form

 Gravity binds the stars together, and in this way many galaxies live together in a cluster of stars

 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form
 shaayad yah gallexiyon ke ghurnan ke veg or usame sthit taron ke banane ki gati par nirbhar karata he
 The width and brightness of our Galaxy is not universal
 dhanu taramandal main yah sabase adhik chaudee or chamakili he

 vibhinn chamak ke taron kii sankhya ginakar, unki duuri kii gananaa kar or unki gati naapakar jyotishiyon ne gallexi ke vaastavik rup kaa bahut acha anumaan laga liya he
 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years
 centre ke paas kii motaai lagbhag 15,000 prakashavarsh he
 The stars in our Galaxy are not evenly distributed
 bich bich main anek taraguchh hai or isaki bhi sambhaavna he ki devayani niharika ke samaan hamaari gallexi main bhi sarpil kundaliyaan hon

 Somewhere black clouds have formed due to thick cloud of dust
 kahin gas ke badal paas ke taron ke prakaash se uddipt hokar chamakati niharika ke rup main dikhaai padate hai
 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle
 isamen ek vrutt ke bheetar hi ve sab taare hai jo hamen akaash main pruthak-pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit
 kuch teevr gativale taare or goleey targuch hamaari gallexi kii seemaa ke baahar hai, kintu ye bhi hamaari gallexi se sambhddha hai or usee ke ang maane jate hai lagbhag 100 goleey taraguchh gyaat hai
 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center
 rup or vistaar main gallexi bahut si agong niharikaon se milti julati hai

 Nowadays, bread is being used in almost all the countries of the world

 It is said that 3000 years before Christ, double bread was introduced in Egypt
 vahaan ke log gundhe hue aate main khamir mili tikia ko bhatti main pakaakar dableroti banaate the
 Specimens of bread making are thus found in Egyptian tombs
 alag-alag deshon main alag-alag padaarthon se dableroti taiyaar kii jaati he
 Somewhere with salt flour or maida, somewhere, potato, pea, rice or barley flour is tried to make it very tasty
 dableroti ke aate main mila khamir pakaae jane par gas banaata he, jo bulbule ke rup main fatkar baahar nikalati he
 This is why there are holes in the bread
 aadi maanav gehun ke daanon ko bhigokar, pathar par pis letaa tha
 Then used to bake the pulp on coals or hot stones
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath-saath roti ne bhi apana rup badla or lugdi kii roti kii jagah, aaj khamir yukt dabl roti ne le lee he
 The process of making wheat flour for making bread is also very entertaining
 badi-badi kothiyon main gehun jamaa kiya jaataa he or shaktishaalee pampon se ek minute main lagbhag dhai ton gehun upar khinch liya jaataa he
 This stored wheat is not used as it is, but passes through several thick and fine channels in a towering structure in a large flour mill
 is prakriya se gehun ke kankad or tinke aadi saaf ho jate hai
 Now the wheat passes through the washing room and stops for some time to dry in the hot air
 sookhne par nirdhaarit maap ke belanon se isko motaa-motaa dala jaataa he
 It is then grinded with fine cylinders
 us maheen aate ko bhi paanch-chha moti, baarik chalaniyon se guzarana pasta he
 These magnets have strong magnets, so that they can pull out the iron impurities in the flour
 ab yah shodhit aataa maida banakar bazaar main aa jaataa he
 Just this flour is made of double loaves
 sarvapratham ek bade bartan main yantra dwaara maida daalaa jaataa he
 It is kneaded by mixing the solution with clean water and the prescribed quantity of sugar and yeast
 gundhai ke baad aate ko dhaatu kii sataha vaali lambii mej par rakhkar ek maheen kapade se dhank diya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, due to yeast, there is sourness in the flour and its flavor is also different
 saath main carbon daai oxide gas banati he, jo samooche aate ko phulaakar spanj kii tarah halkaa kar detii he
 When double bread sinks in the furnace, due to the heat, the gas flies away, sieving the roti
 yah visheshta sirf gehun ke aate main hi hoti he
 Now this dough is made with the help of fine flour and it is divided into pieces of fixed measure
 ye loiyaan mashin dwaara dableroti ke aakaar kii banaai jaati hai
 At the bottom is a metal vessel, from which double bread falls
 in paatro ko 450 degree fahrenheit se 500 degree farenite tak ke taapmaana vaali bhatthi main rakh diya jaataa he
 After about 40-50 minutes, the bread is ready
 is taiyaar dableroti ko kaatane ke liye bahut saavdhaanee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If it is packed in an overheated state, it is feared to be sealed if it gets cold and fungus may rise
 isliye ise praaia: 90 degree fahrenheit se 95 degree fahrenheit ke taapmaana par hi pack kiya jaataa he

 naag panchami hinduon kaa ek pramukh tyohaar he
 According to Hindu Panchang, Panchami of Shukla Paksha of Sawan month is celebrated as Nag Panchami
 is din naag devtaa yaa sarp kii puja kii jaati he or unhen doodh se snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 But at some places, the tradition of feeding has gone on
 naag ko doodh pilaane se pachan nahin ho paane yaa pratyurjata se unki mrityu ho jaati he
 In the scriptures, Nagas have been asked not to give milk but to bathe with milk
 nagpanchami ke hi din anekon gaanv va kasbon main kushti kaa aayojan hota he jisamen aasapaas ke pahalwaan bhaag lete hai
 On this day, animals like cows, bulls etc
 are taken to the river, pond and bathed
 is din ashtnaagon kii puja kii jaati he
 - hindu samskruti ne pashu-pakshi, vriksh-vanaspati sabake saath athmiya sambandh jodne kaa praytn kiya he
 We have cow worship here
 kai bahanen kokila-vrath karti hai
 It is such a fast if the cuckoo is seen or its food is on the ear
 hamaare yahan vrishabhotsav ke din bail kaa pujan kiya jaataa he
 In a fast like vat-savitri, Banyan is worshiped, but when we worship Nag on a day like Nag Panchami, then the uniqueness of our culture reaches its culmination
 gaay, bail, koyal ityadi kaa pujan karke unke saath atmiyata saadhane kaa ham praytn karte hai, kyonki ve upyogi hai
 But what is the use of our snake, on the contrary, if cut, then without knowing it, do not remain
 ham sab usase darate hai
 Many people believe that this fear of Nag may have started Nagpuja, but this belief does not seem to be compatible with our culture
 naag ko dev ke rup main sweekaar karne main aaryon ke hriday kii vishalata kaa hamen darshan hota he
 The Aryans had to come in contact with many groups worshiping different people, proceeding with this roar
 vedon ke prabhavi vichaar unke paas pahunchaane ke liye aaryon ko atyadhik parishram karnaa padaa
 If the dispute arising due to the difference in worship method to various groups is removed, then the human will only accept the brilliant and grand ideas of the Vedas, on which the Aryans had unwavering devotion
 isko safal banane ke liye aaryon ne alag-alag punjon main chalati vibhinn devataaon kii puja ko sweekaar kiya or alag-alag punjon ko unhone aatmsaat karke apane main mila liya
 It is only because of accepting these various pujas that we would have received Nagpuja, it seems
 bharat desh krishipradhan desh tha or he
 The snake protects the fields, so it is called Kshetrapala
 jeev-jantu, chuuhe aadi jo fasal ko nuksaan karne vaale tatv hai, unka naash karke saanp hamaare kheton ko harabhra rakhata he
 The snake also gives us many silent messages
 saanp ke gun dekhne kii hamaare paas gungrahi or shubhagrahi drushti honi chahie
 Lord Dattatreya had such an auspicious vision, that's why he got to learn something from everything
 saanp saamanyatya kisi ko akaaran nahin katata
 He stings only those who harass him or tease him
 saanp bhi prabhu kaa sarjan he, vah yadi nuksaan kiye bina saralata se jaataa ho, yaa nirupadravi banakar jeeta ho to use maarane kaa hamen koi adhikaar nahin he
 When we try to take his life, how can he be called a wicked if he bites us to save his life or to live his life? Don't we try to take the life of our souls? saanp ko sugandh bahut hi bhaati he
 He lives by clinging to the Champa plant or he lives on a sandalwood tree
 kevade ke van main bhi vah phirata rahata he
 She loves fragrance, so she loves Indian culture
 prayek maanav ko jivan main sadgunon kii sugandh aati he, suvicharon kii suvaas aati he, vah suvaas hamen priy honi chahie
 We know that a snake does not bite anyone without reason
 varshon parishram sanchit shakti yani jehar vah kisi ko yon hi katkar vyarth kho dena nahin chahta
 If we also do some tenacity in life, it will also give us power
 yah shakti kisi par gussa karne main, nirbalon ko hairaan karne main yaa ashakton ko dukh dene main vyarth na kar us shakti ko hamaara vikaas karne main, duusare asamarthon ko samarth banane main, nirbalon ko sabal banane main kharch karen, yahi apekshit he
 Some divine snakes have gem on their brain
 mani amuly hoti he
 We should also offer priceless things in life to the brain
 samaaj ke mukutamani jaise mahapurushon kaa sthaan hamaare mastishk par hona chahie
 We should lift their palanquin out of love and try to build our life according to their thoughts
 sarv vidyaon main manirup jo aadhyatm vidya he, uske liye hamaare jivan main anokhaa aakarshan hona chahie
 Do not be helpful in self-development, how can that knowledge be called knowledge? saanp bill main rahata he or adhikanshtah ekaant kaa seven karata he
 Therefore Mumukshu should avoid public gathering
 is bare main saanp kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 By becoming a tool in the ocean churning done by the Devas and demons, Vasuki Nag has opened the way for the wicked to become instruments in the Lord's work
 durjan maanav bhi yadi sachche maarg par aae to vah saanskrithik kaary main apana bahut bada yoga de saktaa he or durbalata satat khatkati rahane par aise maanav ko apane kiye hue satkarya ke liye zyada ghamand bhi nirmaan nahin hoga
 If Durjan too gets involved in the Bhagavad work, then the Lord also accepts him, this is supported by Shiva holding the snake in his neck and Vishnu by resting
 samgr sristi ke hit ke liye barasate barsaat ke kaaran nirvasit hua saanp jab hamaare ghar main atithi banakar aata he tab use aashray dekar kritagya buddhi se uskaa pujan karnaa hamaara karttavya ho jaataa he
 In this way, our sages have shown a lot of justification by keeping the festival of Nag Panchami in the month of Shravan itself
 puure shravan maah vishesh kar nagpanchami ko dharti khodna nishiddh he
 On this day, Kheer is fed and milk is fed to snakes
 kahin-kahin sawan maah kii krishna paksh kii panchami ko bhi naag panchami manaai jaati he
 On this day white lotus is kept in worship
 pracheen kaal main ek sethji ke saat putr the
 Seven were married
 sabase chote putr kii patni shreshth charitra kii vidushi or susheel thi, parantu uske bhai nahin tha
 One day, the elder daughter-in-law asked all the daughters-in-law to go home to bring yellow soil to the house, and all the dug and dug started digging the soil
 tabhi vahaan ek sarp niklaa, jise badi bahu khurpy se maarane lagi
 Seeing this, the younger daughter-in-law stopped her and said- 'don't kill it? This poor innocent ' Hearing this, the elder daughter-in-law did not kill her, then the snake sat on one side
 tab choti bahu ne usase kaha-'ham abhi laut kar aati hai tum yahaan se janaa mat
 Having said this, she went home with all the soil and stuck in the work and forgot the promise made to the snake
 use duusare din vah baat yaad ai to sab ko saath lekar vahaan pahaunchi or sarp ko us sthaan par baitha dekhakar boli- sarp bhaiya namaskara! sarp ne kaha- 'tu bhaiya kah chuki he, isliye tuje chhod detaa hum, nahin to juthi baat kehane ke kaaran tuje abhi das letaa
 She said - Brother, i have made a mistake, ask for his forgiveness, then the snake said - OK, you are my sister from today and i am your brother
 tuje jo maangana ho, maang le
 She said - Brother! i have no one, it is good that you become my brother
 kuch din vyateet hone par vah sarp manushya kaa rup rakhkar uske ghar aayaa or bolaa ki 'meri bahin ko bhej do
 'everyone said that' he had no brother, so he said - i am his brother in a distant relationship, had gone out only in childhood
 uske vishwaas dilaane par ghar ke logon ne choti ko uske saath bhej diya
 On the way he told that 'I am the snake right there, so you do not be afraid and where there is difficulty in walking, take my question
 usne kahe anusaar hi kiya or is prakaar vah uske ghar pahunch gai
 She was surprised to see the riches there
 ek din sarp kii mata ne usase kaha- 'main ek kaam se baahar ja rahi hoon, tu apane bhai ko thanda doodh pilaa dena
 He did not mind this and gave him hot milk, in which his face burned without any reason
 yah dekhakar sarp kii mata bahut krodhit hui
 But upon the explanation of the snake, he became silent
 tab sarp ne kaha ki bahin ko ab uske ghar bhej dena chahie
 Then the serpent and his father gave him a lot of gold, silver, jewels, clothes and clothes etc
 to his house
 itnaa dher sara dhan dekhakar badi bahu ne irsha se kaha- bhai to bada dhanwaan he, tuje to usase or bhi dhan laana chahie
 When the snake heard this promise, he brought all the things with gold
 yah dekhakar badi bahu ne kaha- 'inhen jhaadne kii jhaadu bhi sone kii honi chahie'
 Then the snake also brought the broom with gold
 sarp ne choti bahu ko hira-maniyon kaa ek adbhut haar diya tha
 The queen of that country also heard her praise and she said to the king that the necklace of the younger daughter-in-law of Seth should come here
 ' raja ne mantri ko hukum diya ki usase vah haar lekar sheeghra upasthit ho mantri ne sethji se jaakar kaha ki 'maharaniji choti bahu kaa haar pahanengi, vah usase lekar mujhe de do'
 Sethji gave defeat to the younger daughter-in-law due to fear
 choti bahu ko yah baat bahut buree lagi, usne apane sarp bhai ko yaad kiya or aane par prarthana kii- bhaiya ! rani ne haar chin liya he, tum kuch aisa karo ki jab vah haar uske gale main rahe, tab tak ke liye sarp ban jaae or jab vah mujhe lautaa de tab hiron or maniyon kaa ho jaae
 The snake did exactly that
 jaise hi rani ne haar pahana, vaise hi vah sarp ban gaya
 Seeing this, the queen screamed and started crying
 yah dekh kar raja ne seth ke paas khabar bheji ki choti bahu ko turant bhejo
 Sethji was afraid that what would the king not know? He himself appeared with the younger daughter-in-law
 raja ne choti bahu se poocha- tune kya jaadu kiya he, main tuje dand duungaa
 Younger daughter-in-law said- Rajan! Forgiveness, this necklace is such that diamonds and beads are in my neck and a snake becomes in the other's neck
 yah sunakar raja ne vah sarp bana haar use dekar kaha- abhi pahinakar dikhaao
 As soon as the younger daughter-in-law wore her, so did the diamonds
 yah dekhakar raja ko uski baat kaa vishwaas ho gaya or usne prasann hokar use bahut si mudraaen bhi puraskaar main deen
 Younger she returned home with her necklace and these
 uske dhan ko dekhakar badi bahu ne irsha ke kaaran uske pati ko sikhaaya ki choti bahu ke paas kahin se dhan aayaa he
 Hearing this, her husband called his wife and said - Tell me exactly who gives you this money? Then she started remembering the snake
 tab usee samay sarp ne prakat hokar kaha- yadi meri dharm bahin ke aacharan par andeh prakat karegaa to main use kha loonga
 Hearing this, the husband of the younger daughter-in-law was very happy and he gave great hospitality to the serpent god
 usee din se nagpanchami kaa tyohaar manaaya jaataa he or striyaan sarp ko bhai maanakar uski puja karti hai
 Antoine Laurent Lavacze, a renowned chemist from France
 attharahavin shatabdi ke rasayan kranti kaa vah kendra tha
 He had a great influence on the history of both chemistry and biology
 adhikansh log use aadhunik rasayan kaa janak maanate hai
 He first proved that the main components of air are nitrogen and oxygen
 lavasiye kaa janm paris ke ek dhani vyapaaree parivaar main hua tha, inhone college maazaaren main kanoon ke saath saath ganit, khagoliki tathaa vanaspati vigyaan or rasayan shaastra kii shiksha pai
 Due to excessive attraction in chemistry, he left the profession of law and made scientific research the purpose of his life and in 1765 he presented his first article in the Scientific Council of France
 isi parishad se, san 1766 main ek bade nagar kii sadakon ko prakashit karne kii sarvottam reeti par lekh likhakar, ek swarnapadak praapt kiya
 Thereafter, he engaged in geological survey of France for two years and in 1768, France prepared the first geological map of the country
 isi varsh aap vaigyanik parishad ke sahakaari sadsy namankit hue
 Lavazze is considered the father of modern chemistry
 rasayan ke kshetra main inkaa vahi sthaan he jo bhautikee ke kshetra main newton kaa he
 For two thousand years it was believed that water can be converted into earth
 san 1770 main lavvaazye ne apane un prayogon tathaa unke falon kaa varnan kiya, jinase yah vishwaas mithyaa siddh ho gaya
 After five years of continuous experimentation, he discovered that air is a mixture of two gases
 inamen se ek kaa naam 'oxigen' inhen kaa diya hua he
 You showed that oxygen is required to burn things and this gas is also used for breathing
 is prakaar aapane siddh kiya ki dahan or shwasan mukhyatya ek hi prakaar kii prakriyaayein hai tathaa vaayu ke oxigen ke saath dhaatuon ke sanyog se dhatubhasmen banati hai
 In 1783 you declared that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen
 tatv aise padaarth maane jate the jinase sansar ke anya sab padaarth bane hai, kintu ve swayan kisi anya padaarth se nahin banate
 Thus the traditional belief that water is an element is broken
 lavvazye ne rasinic tatwon kii suchi sarvapratham taiyaar kii
 With the help of other scientists, you also devised a method to name chemical substances, which are still used
 lavvazye ne swayan tathaa anya rasayanagyon, jaise blike, pristli, cavendish aadi, dwaara kiye gaye prayogon se praapt gyaan kaa sankalan kar, ek nae rasyanshastra kii ruparekha taiyaar kii, jisane shanai: shanai: aadhunik rasayan kaa rup liya
 You have written many excellent texts on the topics of chemistry etc
 lavvazye ne paris ke saarvajanik jivan main bhi mahatv ke kaam kiye
 His views in politics were liberal
 us samay ke france main, ve saamaajik sudhaar ko aavashyak sweekaar karte the, kintu is uddeshy kii purti ke liye avaidhanik upaay apnaane ke paksh main ve na the
 For the purpose of providing assistance to the government, you did a detailed investigation on many questions related to hospitals, prisons etc
 aap un mahaan vaigyanikon main se sarvapratham the jinhone apane jivan kaa bada bhaag raashtra kii seva main samarpit kiya he
 But these were the days of the state revolution in France and it was the result of the ideas of the revolution that though you had made significant improvements in the imposition of rent after being appointed the chief monopoly of the state in 1768, his post on guillotine in 1793 was his life
 The reason was taken

 daminic "daam" kaab or arthur khud ko "extrector" kehete hai, jinka ek khufia sanghathan he jo ek praayogic sainya takanic dwaara apane 'torget' ke antarman main send lagaakar or ek-duusare kii saajha sapanom ke anubhavon ke jariye unase judi jaankariyaan baahar nikaalte hai
 His most recent target is a Japanese businessman named Sayto
 lekin saito ke raaj churaane ke dauraan unheen sapanom main kaab ko apni marhoom bivi mail kii yaadon kii dakhlandji se ve naakaam hote he
 But according to Sayto, he was merely examining them, so that he could carry out the difficult task of "inventing" an idea within another's heart
 uskaa ek biimaar pratispardhi marish fiqar he jo ek urja utpaadan ke ekikrut maalik he; saito chahta he ki kaab us fiqar or uske bataur vaaris bete, rabart fiqar, ke bich takaraar kaa phayda uthaakar uske pita kii company bikher de
 In return, Sayto promises that he will eradicate the accusation of killing the cab on the strength of his power, so that the cab can go back home to visit its children
 kaab vah prastaav manjuur karata he or apni team ikatthi karata he, jiname se vah: ams, ek shaatir thag or jaalsaaj baharoopiya; yusuf, ek chemist jiske paas ek behad tej nashili dawa he jo "sapane ke bheetar ek or sapana" dekhne kii kshamta badhaata he; ariadne, ek architekchar kii chaatra jise sapanom ke dauraan bhulabhalaiya jaisi rachanaayen banane kaa jimmaa miltaa he,jiske intjaam kii sifarish kaab ke sasur, professor stephen miles karte hai
 Sayto remains attached to the team to ensure their success
 par jab ariadne saajhe sapanom ke saath kaab ke antarman main jhaankne kii koshish karti he, to use ehsaas hota he ki mail uske antarman main dakhlandji karanevaale par aksar hamalaa kar baahar kar detii he
 At the same time, Robert Fisher takes him on a ten-hour flight to get him cremated in Los Angeles after Maurice Fischer arrives in Sydney, with his team keeping the occasion solemn and Fisher's shared dream in every possible way Plan outlines
 sapanom kii tah main lagbhag harek level main ghuskar vaapis aane ke liye, un sabhi sadasyo ko gahari neend se ekasaath jagaane ke liye lagbhag ek hi "jatke" ke jarurat he
 According to the plan, at the first level Yusuf drops the car from the bridge, at the second level, Arthur resorts to the elevator and at the end of the third level, Aims, taking out everyone together through an explosion
 lekin sapanom kii duniya main marane ke baavjood ve us tej dawa ke asar se jaag nahin paayenge jinase unhone anginat level ke sapanom ko der tak banaae rakhane kaa seven kiya tha
 Here, they will be caught in a "limbo" or almost coma-like situation with death, where there will be infinite and infinite gaps of inner being which are very difficult to escape
 pehle sapane kii tah main, team yusuf ke sapane ke jariye barsaat bhare las angeles main daakhil hoti he
 Here the team arrives to abduct Fischer, but his bodyguard composed in his rescue system shoots there and injures Sayto
 surakshit thikaane par ams fiqar ke hi gadfadar ankal peter browning kaa rup dharkar, rabart ko uske apane pita ke vasiyat par dubaara gaur karne kii salaah dete hai
 Eventually the team escapes with Yusuf on the van, escaping those badguards, during which the team is now ready to enter the second level
 yahaan duusare sapane kii tah main, arthur ke banaae khyalaati hotel main, kaab tab fiqar ko yakeen dilaataa he ki uske ankal browning ne hi apharan kii sajeesh rachi he or vah ek antarman kii suraksha visheshgy hone ke naate yah baat jaanata he
 Cobb persuades him to enter Browning's heart to go to the next level
 tisare tah main ve log ams kii rachit barfili pahadiyon ke bich based durg par pahunchati he
 Here, the team of CAB tries to break into pieces and move inside to remove the guards so that the fissure can be coordinated
 yusuf, apane pehle level ko anusaran karte hue, gaadi drive karte hue pul se giraata he or jald hi pehla jhatka shuru karata he
 This removes gravity from Arthur's level, causing ice to slide at Ames' level
 ams, fouran vine ke pani se takaraane se purv ek saath jatke se ubarne kii taiyaari main jute jaataa he
 But in the projecting of the cab, Mel then shoots Fischer, and as soon as the severely wounded Sayto dies, both of them are lost in that uncertain world
 is darmyaan ams jatke kii taiyaari ke durg main jagah-jagah visphotak lagaataa he, kaab or ariadne tab fiqar evam saito dundhane ke liye coma main jate hai
 The cab then tells Ariadne about going into limbo through her and Mel's shared dreams
 jahaan donon ne takreeban pachaas saal apni yaadon se duniya banaate hue vakt guzaara tha
 But Mel refuses to return to reality, as Kaab unwittingly puts his mind into thinking that his world is not true, and that his early lessons were shaped
 haalaanki, jab wo neend se jaagi, to mail ko yahi yakeen hone lag gaya ki wo vaastavik duniya main nahin he
 To "wake up" in her real world, she commits suicide, forcing her to die with the cab
 katl ke aarope se bachane ke liye, kaab america se faraar hota he, or bacchon kii dekhbhaal professor miles ke jimme saunpta he
 With this cousin confessing, Cobb succeeds in his atonement, and departs from the conscience in the final endless world to find Sayto, leaving him relaxed
 ariadne bhi fiqar ko khoj nikaalte use jhatka dilaakar jagaati he
 Fisher is alive again in the mountain fortress where the safe room is to be found, through the dying father present in it, to motivate him to the idea: in which his father asks him to be his own
 udhar kaab or saito ke alaava baaki sabhi sadsy ek hi vakt main bhinn jhatkon se vaastaviktaa ko lautati he: jaise ariadne kaa balakani par se kud janaa, ams ke lagaae visphotak jo durg ko tabah karte he, arthur dhamaake ke jariye alevator main maujuud soyi hui team ko takaraav se jagaata he, or vine bhi tab tak pani kii sataha se takaraata he
 The cab finally reminds her of her accolades, having found the aged Sayto in that interim world
 donon phir usee hawaizhaj main jaagate hai, jahaan pehle hi baaki kii team or rabart fiqar jaag chuke the
 At the Los Angeles airport, Cab receives clearance at the US Immigration Detection Center and takes her father-in-law to her children while they wait
 kaab mej par ek choti lattunuma cheez nachaata he, jo usne ekal sapane ke satyaapan ke liye rakhaa tha, par use chhod apane parivaar sang garden kii ore badhata he

 In the early period of Aryan civilization and culture, the position of women was very strong

 In the Rigveda, Saraswati has been called the goddess of speech, which signifies the woman's mastery in the field of scripture and art at that time

 Present Indian woman: As a result of spreading education and technical promotion, the situation of Indian woman has improved now and she is no longer working with men
 kuch mahaan bhartiya naariyon udhaaharan hai :- Aesop's Fables or Ispika is a collection of legends attributed to a slave and Kathak, a slave living in ancient Greece between 620 BCE to 520 BCE
 uski dantakathaayen vishwa kii kuch sarvaadhik prasiddh dantakthaon main se hai
 These legends remain a popular choice of moral education for Ajkal's children
 isap kii dantakthaon main shaamil kai kahaniyaan, jaise lomadee or angoor 
 kachua or hiran, uttari hawa or suraj, ladkaa jo chillaaya bhediya aayaa or cheentee or tidde kii dantakathaayen puure vishwa main atyant prasiddh hai
 In the first century AD, the philosopher Apollonius of Tiana mentions this about Aesop: 


 ve log jo sabase sada khaane ko bahut acchhee tarah khate hai, usee tarah usne mahatvapurn sachchaaiyon ko sikhaane ke liye choti-choti ghatnaon kaa upyog kiya or kahani sunaane ke baad vah kisi baat ko karne yaa na karne kii salaah bhi jod detaa he
 Even then, he was actually more attached to truth than poets, because poets use force to make their own stories possible, but by telling a story that everyone knows is not true , With the fact that he did not claim that they were true events
 unani itihaaskaar herotods ke anusaar ye dantakathaayen isa purv paanchavin shatabdi main pracheen yunaan main rahane vaale ek isap naamak gulam dwaara likhi gai thim
 Isip is also mentioned in many ancient Greek texts — Aristophanes in his comedic The Wasps portrayed the protagonist Philoclione as having learned the absurdity of Aesop from conversations at banqueting ceremonies; Plato wrote in Fido that Socrates spent some of his prison time by converting some of Aesop's legends into "verses he remembered"
 baharhaal, do mukhya kaarnon se - kyonki isap se sambandhit dantakthaon ke andar di gai bahut si shikshaaon main paraspar vipodhabhas he or kyonki isap ke jivan ke sambandh main pracheen vivaranon main paraspar virodhabhas he, atah adhunik drushtikon yah he ki sari kii sari dantakathaayen, jinka shrey usko diya jaataa he, sambhawatah keval isap ne nahin rachi thim, yadi kabhi vastav main uskaa astitv rahaa tha
 Modern studies suggest that fables and proverbs of the "christian" form first existed in the time of both Sumer and Akad in the third century BCE
 isliye, isap kii dantakthaon ke saahitiyik rup main rache jane kaa sarvaadhik pracheen ullekh pracheen yunaan, pracheen bharat yaa pracheen misr main nahin balki pracheen sumer or akad main prakat hua tha
 The Indian traditions described in the Aesop legends and the Buddhist Jataka legends and the Hindu Panchatantra have about a dozen legends, though their descriptions often vary widely
 isliye is par kuch vivaad he ki unaniyon ne ye dantakathaayen bhartiya kathkon se sikhin yaa uskaa ulataa hua yaa yah parsparik prabhaav tha
 Ben E
 Perry, the editor of the Lobe and author of a definitive list of Aesop's legends, has taken the extreme position in his book Babrias and Phaedrus
 haalanki isap or buddha lagbhag samakaleen the, un kii kahaniyaan tab tak nahin likhi gai thim jab tak ki unki mrityu ke baad kuch shatabdiyaan nahin guzar gayi or kuch udasin vidwaan ab paraspar virdohi or abhi tak ubhad rahe saakshyon ke pariprekshya main itnaa charam ravaiya apnaane ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 When and how these legends came from ancient Greece remains a mystery

 This follower of Aristotle listed all the legends used by the earlier Greek writers as separate quotations, keeping them in prose
 kam se kam yah iskaa ek saboot to tha jiskaa shrey dusron ke dwaara isap ko diya gaya tha; lekin isamen pashu dantakthaon, kaalpanik laghukthaon, kaary-kaaran siddhant yaa vyangyatmak mithkon ke jariye maukhik parampara se un tak pahunchi koi kahawat yaa majaak, jise in lekhakon ne sanchaarit kiya ho, shaamil hone kaa un par aropan ho saktaa tha
 This is more evidence of the power of his name than the actual authorship of Aesop, who drew such stories to himself

 a compilation of fifty-five legends in the Colombic tetrameter by a pastor Ignatius in the 9th century is also notable for its inclusion of stories from Eastern sources
 pehali shatabdi isvi ke talmud or midrashik sahitya par yahudee vyakhyaaon main ispi nitiyon ke prakatikaran ne unamem purvi sroton se kahaniyon ke pravesh par kuch prakaash daalaa he
 There are some thirty fables among them, twelve of which are similar in both Greek and Indian sources, six which are only in Indian sources and the other six are in only Greek sources
 While similar legends exist in Greece, India and the Talmud, their Talmudic form is more closely related to the Indian approach
