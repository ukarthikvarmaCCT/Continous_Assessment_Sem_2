 The eastern problem or oriental problem in the history of diplomacy refers to the strategic competition and political position among the superpowers of Europe when the Osmani Empire weakened
 18veen shatabdi ke ant se lekar 20veen shatabdi ke ant tak osmani samrajya rajnatik evam aarthik asthirataa se jujh rahaa tha
 It was called the 'rogue of Europe'

 The Eastern problem was the problem of the independence of the Christian people of the Turkish Empire in the southeastern part of Europe
 vastutah patanonmukh turki samrajya ne europe ke itihaas main 19veen shatabdi main jis samasya ko janm diya use purvi samasya kehete hai
 It was very complex, complicated and related to conflicting interests of different countries
 is samasya ne pratham yuddh kii prishthbhumi kaa kaary kiya
 Historian C
D
 According to Heijn, "the Eastern problem was primarily the fate of the Turkish Empire, located in the European region
 " isi prakaar itihaaskaar liston ne kaha ki, "purvi samasya sadaiv se ek anterrashtriya samasya bani rahi jo kisi na kisi rup main sadiyon se europea raajnneeti kii prishthbhumi ko prabhavit karti rahi he
 By the 16th century, the Ottoman or Ottoman Empire occupied all the countries of the Balkan Peninsula located in the southeast of Europe
 isi europea balcon pradesh main romania, bulgaria, macedoniya, albania tathaa yunaan ke pradesh shaamil the or in par turkon kaa aadhipaty tha
 The majority of the people of the Balkan region were of Slavic species who belonged to Christianity and followed the principles of the Greek Church
 automan samrajya in isaayiyon par atyaachaar karata tha
 Until the 18th century Turkish society was very vast and remained powerful, but due to the luxuriant tendency, tyranny of the Turkish sultans, this vast empire was on the decline
 balcon pradesh main rahane vaali vibhinn jatiyaan apni swatantraaa ke liye aandolan karne lagi
 In the 19th century, the process of empire's decline progressed
 dhire-dhire turki kii haalat itani kharaab ho gai ki use "europe kaa marij" kaha jane laga
 As a result, major nations of Europe, such as Russia, France, etc
, tried to benefit from its decadent state
 europe ke pramukh rashtron- rus, britain, austria, france kii automan samrajya main vividh kaarnon se ruchi thi- Russia's business interests and expansionist profits were linked to the Ottoman Empire
 rus ke paas vyapaar karne ke liye samudri tat nahin tha
 The coastline of its northern border was almost always buried throughout the year
 atah vahaan nauka chaalan sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, Russia wanted to influence the Black Sea
 saath hi turki samrajya main sthit dardenles evam bassfosar ke jaldmarumadhya par adhikaar chahta tha
 For this reason Russia wanted to disintegrate the Turkish Empire
 iske alaava balcon kshetra ke slav-prajati ke nivasee greek carch ke anuyaayi the or rus kaa rajdharm bhi greek carch tha or vahaan slav jati kaa bahulya tha
 In this way Russia had a deep species and religious relationship with the Balkan inhabitants
 vah inhen turki ke viruddh bhadakaakar apana prabhaav jamaana chahta tha
 In 1844, Tsar Nicholas i of Russia told the Foreign Minister of Britain, Lieburdin, that "turkey is the sick man of Europe
" atah uske marane se pehle sampatti kaa bantwaaraa kar lenaa chahie
 " turki samrajya ko rus ke prabhaav kshetra se dur rakhana hi britain kii pramukh niti rahi
 Therefore, he wanted to maintain the territorial integrity of the Turkish Empire
 britain bhaleebhanti jaanata tha ki yadi rus kaa prabhaav turki par padataa he to usase britain ke africa sthit upnivesh tathaa bhartiya upnivesh ko khatra utpann ho saktaa he
 This is the reason why Britain on most occasions opposed Russia and supported Turkey
 england kii najar main bhartiya samrajay kii suraksha ke liye automan samrajya ke astitv kaa bana rahanaa aavashyak tha
 For this reason England was determined to keep the "patient of Europe" alive at any cost
 austria purvi kshetra main rus ko apana pratidwandvi maanata tha
 The Kingdom of Austria was surrounded by land
 samudri vyapaar ke liye uske paas adriatic sagar kaa chota-sa konaa tha
 Austria, like Russia, wanted its authority over the waterways of the Dardenleys and Basphorus
 france ko do kaarnon se turki samrajya main dilchaspee thi
 France, a Catholic follower, wanted control over Catholicism centers in the Ottoman Turkish Empire
 doosraa turki samrajya evam uske adhikaar kshetron main aane vaale pradeshon main france apane vyapaar kii vruddhi chahta tha
 France was keen to increase trade mainly in Egypt and Syria
 in pradeshon main turki sultan ke pratinidhi rajya karte the jo pasha kehalaate the
 France always strengthened these pasha by giving aid and support against Turkey
 pasha kaa saath dene kaa matlab tha, turki samrajya ke vighatan ko badhaava dena
 The unification of Germany was completed in 1871

 Bismarck used to say that i did not open the post coming from Turkey but in 1878 in Berlin Congress he tried to find a solution to the eastern problem and said "I have played the role of" honest broker in it "
 italy ke kavur ne purvi samasya main ruchi lee tathaa kreemia ke yuddh main france kaa saath diya or is tarah ke ekikaran main anterrashtriya samarthan hasil kiya
 Inspired by the spirit of democracy and nationalism, the Greek people raised their voice against Turkey and demanded their independence
 unaniyon ne 1821main turki ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 This event was the beginning of the Greek freedom struggle
 is sangram main unaniyon ko england or rus kaa samarthan mila
 Greece was declared an independent state in 1832
 kreemia kaa yuddh bhi purvi samasya se sambandhit tha
 In fact, Russia wanted to disintegrate sick Turkey and get a large part of it on its own
 1740 i
 ke ek samjhaute ke anusaar jerusalem ke pavitra sthal ke roman carch ko france ke sangrakshan main rakhaa gaya tha
 But in violation of this agreement, the clergy of the Greek Church took away the rights of the Roman clergy
 greek carch kaa sangrakshak roosi jaar tha
 For this reason Napoleon III interfered in the matter, favoring the Roman clergy
 vastutah france ke nepolian tritiy kaa uddeshy france ko europe kaa sarvshereshth raashtra banaakar gaurav or kirti hasil karnaa tha
 Napoleon's time in France was aimed at achieving glory and fame by making France the best nation in Europe
 france main nepolian tritiy ke prabal samarthak roman catholic carch ke log the jinhen vah har keemat par khush karnaa chahta tha
 Moreover, Napoleon III did not forget the Moscow defeat of his ancestor Napoleon i and wanted to avenge this defeat
 in sabhi kaarnon se france ne rus ke viruddh yuddh kiya
 Under these circumstances, Nopolyan III favored the Roman clergy and demanded the return of their overlord from Jerusalem to the Turkish Sultan to take appropriate action in this regard as Jerusalem fell under the Turkish Empire
 rus ne is maang kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki greek padariyon ke adhikaron main koi katautee na ho tathaa turki sultan apni sari isai prajaaon kaa sangrakshak roosi jaar ko maan le
 Britain also became involved in this dispute
 britain kaa protsaahan paakar turki ne roosi maangon ko asweekrut kar diya
 On this, Russia invaded Turkey and Britain and France also joined the war, taking the side of Turkey

 " This war is considered futile and useless because it could neither save the Turkish Empire from disintegration nor control the imperialist plan of Russia forever

 The Berlin Congress of 1878 was the result of the disintegration of the Turkish Empire and the socialist policy of Russia and Austria
 'europe kaa marij' turki samrajya aantarik kalah evam vidroh kaa shikaar tha jisase samrajyavaadee desh laabh uthaanaa chaahate the
 Russia intervened during the rebellion of the Balkan region and imposed the Treaty of Sanstifeno on Turkey, but this treaty was not accepted by other imperialist countries of Europe and consequently forced Russia to accept the Berlin system
 1870 i
 ke france-prasha yuddh se laabh uthaate hue rus ne paris kii us vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya jiske dwaara kaala sagar main uski sainik gatividhiyon par pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha
 Now Russia decided that it would turn the Black Sea into a Russian lake
 abhi tak austria balcon kshetra kii raajnneetik main koi dilchaspee nahin le rahaa tha kintu jab italy or germany kii raajnneeti se use alag kar diya gaya tab usne balcon kshetra main samrajyavaadee prasar karnaa chaha
 In such a situation, a new rival was raised against Russia in the Balkan region
 faltah takaraav kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 Russia, after losing in the Crimea war, tried to gain the support of the Slavic caste to strengthen its position
 usne balcon rajyon ke sabhi slaavon ko sangathit karne ke uddeshy se masco main ek sarv-slav sammelan 1867 i
 main yojit kiya, iskaa uddeshy sabhi slav logon ko sangathit kar turki samrajya ke viruddh vidroh karwaanaa tha
 Influenced by this movement, in 1875 AD, the people of Bosnia, Bulgaria revolted against the Turkish rule
 faltah turki ne nirdayatapurvak is vidroh ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 In such a situation, Russia intervened in Bosnia's favor and declared war
 rus ne turki ko parajeet kar saan-steffinon kii sandhi lad di
 Under this, Russia occupied some territories of Turkey
 srbija or romania ko purna swatantra rajya maan liya gaya or ek nae swatantra rajya bulgaria kaa nirmaan hua
 But the terms of the sa-stephan treaty were not acceptable to England and Austria as it hurt their interests
 atah unhone is sandhi ko radd karne kii maang is aadhaar par kii ki kisi ek raashtra ko balpurvak paris kii sandhi dwaara sthapit vyavastha ko samaapt karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Therefore, a conference of the concerned states should be called to consider the entire problem
 rus ne is maang ko asweekaar kar diya
 The conference was finally convened in Bismarck in mid-june 1878 in Berlin
 is sammelan main hui sandhi ke nimnlikhit praavdhaan the- The Berlin Congress claimed to solve the Balkan problem and prevent war between European states, but their claim was false
 vastutah britain ke pradhanmantri disraeli ne ghoshnaa kii “"berlin se main sammaan sahit shaanti laayaa"
 Disgraeli said such a statement on the basis that the treaty prevented Russia's growing influence in the Balkan region

 The Empire of Turkey gained renewal in Europe
 lekin disraeli kaa yah kathan satya se bahut dur tha
 The Berlin Congress ignored the nationalist will of the people of the Balkans and sacrificed them in front of the selfishness of the superpowers
 bosnia tathaa harjegovina ke sarb bahul praanton ko austria ke adheen kar diya gaya
 Whereas on the basis of the principle of nationality, these territories should have been given to Serbia

 The Christians in the Balkan region were again pushed back into Turkish slavery, which Russia had freed by the san-stephenes

 Each Balkan state was dissatisfied with Berlin's decisions
 bulgaria ke asantosh kaa kaaran yah tha ki uskaa aakaar chota kar diya gaya tha
 Serbia regretted that the territory of Bosnia was given to Austria
 yunaan ko bhi unani bahul kshetra nahin mili
 In this way, Berlin was not able to solve the treaty problems, but it gave rise to new problems which put not only Europe but the whole world in crisis
 berlin kangeras main bhaag lene vaale desh apane samrajyavaadee hiton ke ke liye andhe ho chuke the or ve kisi bhi haalat main rus par pratibandh lagaakar apane hiton kii purti karnaa chaahate the

 itihaas gavaah he ki maatr das varsh baad balcon pradesh punah ashaant ho gaya or yah ashaanti badhati hi gai jisane pratham vishwa yuddh ko avashyambhavi bana diya
 Bismarck's claim that he played the role of an 'honest broker' proved to be false

 Also worked against Russian interest to strengthen its position

 Alum is in fact a double compound of both potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate
 san 1754 main margraph ne yah pradarshit kiya ki jis mitti ko alumina kaha jaataa he, vah chooney se bhinn he
 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification

 ek prasiddh pracheen manyata ke anusaar mata vaishno ke ek param bhakt shridhar kii bhakthi se prasann hokar maan ne uski laaj rakhi or duniya ko apane astitv kaa pramaan diya
 According to the Hindu epic, mother Vaishno Devi was born in the south of India to Ratnakar Sagar
 unke loukik mata-pita lambey samay tak niqusantan the
 One night before the birth of the divine girl, Ratnakar vowed that whatever the girl wants, they will never come in the way of her wish
 Mother Vaishno Devi was called by the name Trikuta in childhood
 baad main bhagwaan vishnu ke vansh se janm lene ke kaaran ve vaishnavi kahalaain
 When Trikuta was 9 years old, she asked her father for permission to do penance on the seashore
 Trikuta prayed to Lord Vishnu in the form of Rama
 sita kii khoj karte samay shri ram apni sena ke saath samudr ke kinare pahunche
 Her eyesight fell on this divine girl absorbed in deep meditation
 Trikuta tells Sri Rama that she has accepted him as her husband
 shri ram ne use bataaya ki unhone is avatar main keval sita ke prati nishthavan rahane kaa vachan liya he
 But God assured him that in Kali Yuga he would appear as Kalki and marry her

 Over time, many stories about the Mother Goddess emerged
 One such story is from Sridhar
 shridhar maa vaishno devi kaa prabal bhakt the
 He lived in Hansli village, 2 km from present-day Katra town
 ek baar maa ne ek mohak yuva ladki ke rup main unako darshan die
 The young girl asked the humble Pandit to conduct 'bhandara'
 The Pandits went to the village and nearby places to invite people
 He also invited 'bhairav nath', a selfish demon
 bhairav nath ne shridhar se poocha ki ve kaise apekshaaon ko puraa karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 He reminded Sridhar of the bad consequences in the event of failure
 As Panditji drowned in worry, the divine girl appeared and said not to disappoint, all arrangements have been made
 unhone kaha ki 360 se adhik shraddhaluon ko choti-si kutiyaa main bitha sakate ho
 According to him, a smooth event was held at Bhandara with additional food and seating arrangements
 bhairav nath ne sweekaar kiya ki balika main alokik shaktiyaan thim or aage or pariksha lene kaa nirnay liya
 He followed that divine girl to the Trikuta hills
 9 maheenon tak bhairav nath us rahasyamay balika ko dhoondhata rahaa, jise vah devi maa kaa avatar maanata tha
 Running away from Bhairava, the goddess fired an arrow on the earth, from which water burst forth
 yahi nadi banganga ke rup main jaani jaati he
 It is believed that by bathing in Banganga, all sins of those who believe in Mother Goddess are washed away
 nadi ke kinare, jise charan paduka kaha jaataa he, devi maa ke pairon ke nishaan hai, jo aaj tak usee tarah vidyaman hai
 After this Vaishno Devi took shelter in the womb June near Adhakavari, where she meditated for 9 months and attained spiritual knowledge and powers
 His practice disintegrated when Bhairav sought him
 jab bhairav ne unhen maarane kii koshish kii, to vivash hokar vaishno devi ne maha kaali kaa rup liya
 Mother Goddess appeared at the entrance of the holy cave in the court
 The goddess beheaded Bhairava with such power that his skull fell 2
5 km from the holy cave to a place called Bhairav valley
 bhairav ne marate samay kshamaa yachana kii
 Devi knew that Bhairava's main intention behind attacking her was to attain salvation
 unhone na keval bhairav ko punarjanm ke chakra se mukti pradaan kii, balki use vardaan bhi diya ki bhakt dwaara yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki tirth-yatra sampann ho chuki he, yah aavashyak hoga ki vah devi maa ke darshan ke baad, pavitra gupha ke paas bhairav nath ke mandir ke bhi darshan karen
 Meanwhile, Vaishno Devi assumed the shape of a rock with three bodies and became eternally meditated
 is bich pandit shridhar adheer ho gaye
 They headed the same way towards the Trikuta mountain, which they saw in the dream
 antat ve gupha ke dwaar par pahunche
 He made the worship of 'bodies' his routine by many methods

 ve unke saamne prakat huin or unhen aashirwad diya

 vyakti-kendrit kutark tarkshastra main aise mithyaa tark ko kehete hai jisamen kisi daawey kii nihit sachai ko jhuthalane kii koshish us daavedaar ke charitra, vichaardhaara yaa kisi anya gun kii ore dhyaan bantaakar kii jaae
 For example, saying that 'corruption of Varma saheb should not be taken into account as he always quarrels with his wife' is a person-centered sophist because corruption of Varmaji's personal problems is true or false
 There is no relation to being
 aise kutark main kabhi-kabhi kisi daawey ko sachcha jatalane kaa praytn bhi uske kehane vaale ke gunon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a famous film actor appears in a soap advertisement, it is being presented that 'if you like this actor, then you will also like this soap', although the soap has no special relation with the actor

 Note that simply abusing someone without argument is not a person-centered sophist
 kuch udhaaharan: It is an attempt to break one's logic based on one's circumstances
 isamen kaha jaataa he ki bolne vaala apane paristhitiyon kii vajah se koi tark de rahaa he
 This is a false argument because one wants to give an argument in its own circumstance does not disprove that argument: 'tum bhi' prakaar ke kutark main vipakshi ke tark ko kamazor karne ke liye kaha jaataa he ki vah swayan apane tark kaa paalan nahin karata
 This can prove that the opposition is hypocritical but this does not prove his argument wrong: isamen vipakshi ke tark ko is bahaane kamazor karne kii avaidh koshish kii jaati he ki bura samajhe jane vaala koi anya vyakti yaa samooh bhi vahi kahata he
 Examples: web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 ek shaddashamalav triplate hota he ek chah ank, teen bite shaddashamalav sankhya, jo ki HTML main prayukt hoti he rangon ke pradarshan hetu
 The three bytes represent the red, green, blue components of a single color
 ek bite hoti he 00 se FF tak, yaa 0 se 255 
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red = 36, green = 104, blue = 160
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit 
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows: These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F,BC,8B 
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 saanchaa:color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue 
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
the lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: Purple color is the name after a vegetable brinjal
 angreji main ise woylate kehete hai, jo ki isi naam ke phool ke naam par rakhaa he

 kisi thi atlantis sabhyataa : atlantis ko us samay dharti kii sabase khushhaal jagah mana jaataa tha
 There were lots of precious stones along with gold and silver
 dweep par dur-dur tak hare-bhare maidan faile the
 The land was very fertile
 badi taadaad main pashu-pakshi the, to falon ke bageeche bhi the
 The city was divided into five regions

 plato ne bhagwaan kii ek murti kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, jo puri tarah se sone kii bani he
 Six horses pulling the chariot are also shown
 murti ko samudr ke devtaa ke rup main puja jaataa tha
 Even in heaven, it is said about human Fitrat Plato that he was a very good judge of human nature
 unhone atlantis ko dharti kaa swarg to qaraar diya, lekin saath hi vahaan kii nakaaratmak baaten bhi likhi hai
 Plato mentions at one place that the kings of the Atlantis civilization attacked other kingdoms to expand their empire
 unhone badi sankhya main narsanhaar kar duusare ilaakon par kabja kiya
 They could not overcome Athens only bhagwaan kii sajaa : plato ke mutabik, is kaam ke liye bhagwaan ne atlantis waalon ko sajaa bhi di
 This punishment was in the form of storms, floods, earthquakes and volcanoes
 in prakritik aapadaaon se atlantis ko samay-samay par baari nuksaan pahunchaa
 One such catastrophe came one day and the whole civilization became history
 kya sahi tha plato : plato kii is kahani par itihaas ke kai jaankaron ne sawalia nishaan uthaae hai
 Their question is, on what basis should Plato's statement be accepted as true? tatariyaa eta jila ke aliganj prakhand ek gaanv he
