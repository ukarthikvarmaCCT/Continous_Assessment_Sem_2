 virus ke alaava, shodhakartaaon ne jeevanu or kuch vishesh prakaar ke karkat ke bich sambandh paaya he
 The most prominent example is the relationship between chronic cancer of the stomach and Helicobacter pylori of the stomach wall
 Although Helicobacter pylori infection develops in very rare cases, as this pathogen is very common, it is probably responsible for most of this type of cancer
 isi prakaar se kuch hormone gaiyr-utparivartajanik karsinogence kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, ve atirikt koshika vruddhi ko uttejit kar sakate hai
 a good example is the role of hyper estrogenic states in developing cancer of the endometrium
 HIV kai prakaar kii durdamataaon se sambandhit he jisamen shaamil he kaposi sarcoma, gaiyr-hojakins limphoma or HPV -sambandhit durdamataayen jaise guda cancer or garbhashay greeva kaa karkat 
 AIDS - ko paribhaashit karne vaali bimariyon main lambe samay se ye nidaan shaamil hai
 The increased incidence of malignancy in HIV patients points to the breakdown of immune surveillance as a possible etiology of cancer
 anya vishisht pratiraksha kii kami kii avasthaaen bhi durdamata ke jokhim ke badhane se sambandhit hai
 Most forms of cancer are radiated, meaning they have no genetic cause
 haalanki, aise kai syndrome hai jinamein cancer ke liye anuvaanshik rup se praapt purv pravriti yaa vishesh sugrahyata hoti he, aisa aksar ek jin main dosha ke kaaran hota he jo gaanth ke nirmaan ke viruddh raksha karata he
 Famous examples are: garbhadhaaran ke saath or keval ek seemaant rup main kuch ang daataaon ke saath is rog kaa sancharan kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he, anyathaa cancer samanyatya ek sankramak rog nahin he
 The main reason for this is tissue tissue graft rejection due to major tissue homology complex incompatibility or incompatibility
 In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells, as these antigens are different in each individual
 jab gaiyr swa pratijanon kaa saamana hota he, to pratiraksha tantra upyukt koshika ke khilaaf pratikriya karata he
 Such reactions protect against knot cell grafting by destroying transplanted cells
 In the United States, malignancy is found in approximately 3500 pregnant women annually, transmission of acute blood cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and carcinoma from mother to fetus via placenta
 Has been seen ang pratyaropan ke dwaara daata se vyutpann gaanth bahut kam paayi jaati he
 The main cause of the knot related to organ transplantation is Durdam melanoma, which was not known at the time of removal of the organ, although other cases were present
 vastav main, ek jeev se cancer aamtaur par usee prajati ke duusare jeev main tabhi vruddhi karata he jab un donon main samaan utak asangati ke jin hon, chuhon kaa upyog karke aisa siddh kiya gaya he; haalanki upar varnit sthiti ke alaava vaastavik duniya main aisa kabhi nahin hota he
 Some types of cancer have been found in organisms other than humans, which are caused by transmission of knot cells themselves
 yah ghatana stikar sarcoma se yukt kutton main dekhi gayi he, jo kenayan transmicible veneral tumor or tasmanian devil main devil chehre ke tumor kii beemaari ke rup main bhi jaani jaati he
 Cancer is basically a disease regulating tissue development
 ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye, koshika vruddhi or vibhedan ko niyamit karne vaale jeenon main roopantaran hona chahie
 Genetic changes can occur at many levels, as an advantage or disadvantage of the whole chromosome, which is a form of mutation and only affects DNA nucleotides
 jin kii do vyapak shreniyan hai, jo in parivartanon se prabhavit hoti hai
 Oncogenes may be normal genes, which appear at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties
 kisi bhi maamle main, in jeenon kii abhivyakti cancer kii koshikaon ke durdam lakshan praaroop ko badhaava detii he
 Lump suppressor genes are genes that inhibit the cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin aksar cancer ko badhaava dene vaale anuvanshik parivartanon ke dwaara aksham ho jate hai
 Typically, many genes need to be transformed to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell
 vibhinn jinomik parivartanon ke liye ek vividh vargeekaran yojana he, jo cancer koshikaon ke utpaadan main yogadan kar sakati he
 Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in nucleotide sequencing of genomic DNA
 anyuploidi, gunasutron kii ek asaamaanya sankhya kii upasthiti, ek jinomik parivartan he, jo ek utparivartan nahin he or isamen samasutri vibhaajan main truti ke dwaara ek yaa adhik gunasutron kaa laabh yaa haani shaamil ho sakati he
 Large-scale mutations include damage or growth of a part of a chromosome
 Genomic amplification occurs when a cell acquires multiple copies of a small chromosomal locus, typically containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material
 sthanikaran tab hota he jab do alag alag gunasutri kshetra asaamaanya rup se, ek vishisht sthaan par sangalit ho jate hai
 a well-known example of this is the localization of the Philadelphia chromosome or chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in acute marrow-induced blood cancers, resulting in the production of the bcr-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase
 chote paimaane ke utparivartanon main shaamil hai bindu utparivartan, kami yaa badhotari, jo ek jin ke pravartak main ho sakati he, yah isaki abhivyakti ko prabhavit karti he
 Or can occur in the sequence coding of a gene and alter the stability or function of its protein product
 ekmaatr jin kaa vighatan, ek DNA virus yaa ritro virus se jinomik saamagree ke ekikaran ke parinamswarup ho saktaa he or is prakaar kii ghatana ke parinamswaroop prabhavit koshika or uski santati main viral onkosin kii abhivyakti ho sakati he
 Over-genetics is the study of the regulation of gene expression through chemical, non-mutagenic changes in DNA architecture
 cancer rogajanan main adhi-anuvaanshiki kaa siddhant he ki DNA main gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartan jin abhivyakti main parivartan kar dete hai
 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive
 cancer anusandhan main paribhaashit kiye jane vaale pehle onkoseenon main se ek he raas onkosin
aadya-onkosin ke raas parivaar main utparivartan bahut aam hai, ye sabhi maanav ganthon ke 20% se 30% main paae jate hai
 Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised to find that it not only had this gene presence in the human genome, but was also linked to a catalytic control element that induced cancer in cell line culture

 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaala jin prachurodabhavan virdohi sanketon or proteinon ke liye anukoden karata he, jo samasutri vibhaajan or koshika vruddhi kaa shaman kar dete hai
 In general, knot suppressor genes are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage
 aksar DNA kshati ke kaaran mukt-utplavi anuvanshik padaarth kii upasthiti or saath hi anya lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai, jo aise anzimon or maarg ko prerit karte hai jo gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke sakriyan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors
 gaanth ke prakaar gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale utparivartan ke prayek prakaar ke liye praroopik hote hai, kuch utparivartan vishesh prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai, jabaki anya utparivartan anya prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai
 The type of inheritance of a mutant tumor sedative is that an effective member inherits a defective copy from one parent and the normal copy from another parent
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vyakti jo ek utparivarti p53 elil ko vanshaagat rup se praapt karata he vah melanoma or agnashyi cancer viksit kar saktaa he jo lee-frameni syndrome kehalaata he
 Other hereditary knot suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations related to retino blastoma and APC gene mutations associated with adenopolyposis large intestine cancer
 Adenopolyposis large intestine cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in the large intestine in childhood, which is relatively Produce cancer of the large intestine at an early age
 ant main, BRCA1 or BRCA2 main vanshaagat utparivartan stan cancer kii praarambhik shuruyaat kaa kaaran banate hai
 In 1971, it was proposed that the development of cancer depends on at least two mutation events
 nudsan kii do chot kii pariklpana ke anusaar ek gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin main ek vanshaagat janan str utparivartan cancer ko keval tabhi utpann karegaa jab jeev ke jivan main baad main koi anya utparivartan ghatit hota he, yah us gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke anya elil ko niskriy kar degaa
 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
 nudsan ke do chot ke modal ko haal hi main kai jaanchakartaaon dwaara chunauti di gai he
 Deactivation of one allele of some genes that suppress the knot is sufficient to produce a tumor
 yah ghatana agunit aparyaaptta kehalaati he or ise kai prayogtmak drushtikonon ke dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The onset of a knot resulting from haploid insufficiency is usually late, when it is compared to a two-injury process
 aksar, bahul anuvanshik parivartan jinka parinaam cancer hota he, unhen sanchit hone main kai saal lag sakate hai
 During this time, the biological behavior of pre-malignancy cells gradually changes from normal cell to cancer cell
 sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se purv durdam utak main vibhedak gun dekhe ja sakate hai
 Differential features include increased number of dividing cells, variation in nucleus size and shape, differentiation in cell size and shape, decrease in the properties of specialized cells and loss of normal tissue organization
 Dyspepsia is an unusual type of extra-cell proliferative building that is reflected by normal tissue system and loss of cell structure in pre-malignant cells
 ye praarambhik arbudeey parivartan ativardhan se vibhedit kiye jane chahiyein, jo ek bahari uddipan ke kaaran koshika vibhaajan main ek utparivarti vruddhi he, jaise hormoni asantulan yaa puraani jalan
 The most severe cases of malignancy are called "in situ carcinoma"
 latin main, "swasthani " shabd kaa arth he "sthaan main", isliye carcinoma swasthani shabd kaa arth he koshikaon kii aniyantrit vruddhi jo apane mul sthaan par hi bani rahati he or jisane anya utakon par koi akraman nahin darshaya he
 Nevertheless, carcinoma in situ can develop into an aggressive malignancy and is usually removed by surgery if possible
 jis tarah se jaanwaron kii aabaadi main vikaas hota he, thik usee tarah koshikaon kii aniyantrit aabaadi main bhi vikaas hota he
 This undesirable process is called somatic development and in this way cancer arises and becomes more painful
 koshikeey upaapachay main adhikansh parivartan jo koshika main aniyamit tareeke se vibhaajan kaa kaaran hai, ve koshika mrityu kaa kaaran hote hai
 However once the cancer starts, the cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: some cells with new genetic changes that multiply continuously to promote their life and reproduction and develop quickly
 The knot becomes dominant, as cells with less adapted genetic changes are out of competition
 isi prakaar se MRSA jaise rogajanak pratijaivik-pratirodhi ban jate hai or yahi kaaran he ki fasalon ke blit or keet kitnashak pratirodhi ban jate hai
 Due to this development, cancer recurrence consists of cells that acquire resistance to cancer drugs

 prostate cancer kaa nidaan karne ke liye prayukt prakriyaayein parshv prabhaavon kaa kaaran ho sakati hai jinamein rakt pravaah or sankraman shaamil he
 Prostate cancer treatment can be the cause of incontinence and sexual dysfunction
 isi prakaar, stan cancer ke liye, haal hi main yah aalochana di gayi he ki kuch deshon main stan screening kaarykram samasyaon ko hal karne ke bajaay badha detaa he
 This is because screening in women in the general population can produce a number of virtual positive results, which require advance screening, due to which a large number of women are required to detect and treat only one case of breast cancer
 Treatment is done
 ek saarvajanik swasthya pariprekshya ke anusaar pap smear ke madhyam se greeva cancer screening, anya sabhi prakaar ke cancer kii tulana main keemat kii drushti se adhik laabhakaari he, yah bade paimaane par ek virus ke kaaran hota he, isamen spasht jokhim kaarak hai, is cancer ke prakritik prasar kaa tarika yah he ki yah saamanyatya dhire dhire kai varshon main failata he, isliye screening kaarykram ko ise jaldi pakad main le lene ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa he
 Furthermore, the test itself is cheap and very easy
 inhen kaarnon se, cancer screening ke liye vichaar karte samay naidanik prakriya or upachaar ke laabh tathaa jokhim par dhyaan dena mahatvapurn he
 Equally problematic is the use of medical imaging for cancer in people with no clear symptoms
 haal hi main khoje gaye incidentaloma kii jaanch main bahut jokhim he- ek saumy ghaav jise durdam samajha ja saktaa he or ho saktaa he ki iske liye sambhavit khatarnaak jaanch kii jaae
 Recent studies of CT scan-based screening for lung cancer in smokers have yielded equivocal results, since July 2007, systematic screening is not recommended
 sade-film ke chaati ke eks re ke yadricchik naidanik pareekshan, jo dhumrapaan karne waalon main fefdon ke cancer ke liye screen karte hai, is drushtikon ke liye laabhakaari sabit nahin hue hai
 Canine cancer screening has accurate results, but it is still in the early stages of research
 adhikansh cancer yaa to apane lakshanon or sanketon ke dwaara praarambhik rup se pahachaane jate hai yaa screening ke dauraan prakat hote hai
 None of these are definitive diagnoses, which usually require the advice of a pathologist, this pathologist must be a type of physician who specializes in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases
 jin logon main cancer kaa andeh hota he unki chikitsa pareekshan ke dwaara jaanch kii jaati he
 Common tests include blood tests, x rays, CT scans, and observation
 kai kaarnon se cancer kaa andeh ho saktaa he, lekin adhikansh durdamataaon kaa nishchit nidaan ek rog vigyaani ke dwaara cancer kii koshikaon ke utak vaigyanik pareekshan ke dwaara sunishchit kiya janaa chahie
 The tissue can be obtained by biopsy or surgery
 kai biopsy ek chikitsak ke karyaalay main hi kii ja sakati hai
 Biopsy of other organs is performed in the presence of an anesthetic, which requires surgery in the surgical chamber
 rog vigyaani ke dwaara die gaye utak nidaan prachurodbhavan karne vaali koshika ke prakaar ko bataate hai
 At the same time, the tissue scientist category of the knot also clarifies genetic abnormalities and other symptoms
 saath hi, yah jaankaree rogi ke purv nidaan kaa moolyankan karne main tathaa sarvottam ilaaj kaa chayan karne main upyogi he
 Cell genetics and immune tissue chemistry are other types of tests that a pathologist can perform on a tissue sample
 ye pareekshan un anvik parivartanon ke bare main jaankaree uplabdh kara sakate hai jo cancer kii koshika main hue hai or is prakaar se cancer ke bhavi vyavhaar or sarvottam upachaar ko bhi ingit karte hai
 Cancer can be treated by surgery, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy or other methods
 therapy kaa chayan gaanth kii sthiti or shrenee tathaa rog kii avasthaa par nirbhar karata he, saath hi rogi kii saamaanya avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karata he 
kai prayogtmak cancer upachaar bhi viksit ho rahe hai
 The purpose of treatment is to eliminate cancer completely without harming the body
 kabhi kabhi ise shalya chikitsa ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he, lekin cancer kii aas-paas ke utakon par akraman karne kii pravriti yaa sookshm metastasis dwaara dur ke sthanon par fail jane kii pravriti aksar isaki prabhavita ko simit kar detii he
 The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by the toxicity of other tissues in the body
 vikiran saamaanya utakon ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Because "cancer" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that "cancer will always be the only treatment", yet there is only one treatment for all infectious diseases
 saidhantik rup se gaiyr hemetological cancer kaa ilaaj kiya ja saktaa he yadi ise puri tarah se shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa diya jaae, lekin yah sadaa sambhav nahin he
 When the cancer reaches other parts of the body by metastasis before surgery, it is usually impossible to completely remove it by surgery
 cancer kii pragati ke halsted namoonay main, gaanth sthanik rup se babbti he, fir lasika parvon tak fail jaati he or fir sharir ke anya sabhi bhaagon main
isi kaaran se chote canceron ke liye sthanik upachaar jaise shalya chikitsa kii lokapriyata bad gai he
 Even small localized tumors have a very high capacity for metastasis
 cancer ke liye shalyachikitsa kii prakriyaaon ke udaahranon main shaamil hai- stan cancer ke liye stanochhedan or prostate cancer ke liye prostate-chhedan 
 shalya chikitsa kaa lakshya hota he yaa to keval gaanth ko hataanaa yaa puure ang ko nikaal dena
ek cancer koshika nagn ankhon ke liye adrishy hoti he, lekin fir se vruddhi kar ke nayi gaanth bana sakati he, yah prakriya punrariti kehalaati he
 For this reason, pathologists examine surgically extracted specimens that, if healthy tissue limits are present, reduce the likelihood that microscopic cancer cells may remain in the patient's body
 praathmik gaanth ko nikaalane ke alaava, aksar shalya kriya avasthaa nirdhaaran ke liye aavashyak hoti he udhaaharan rog kii seemaa kaa nirdhaaran or is baat kaa nirdhaaran ki yah metastasis ke dwaara kshetreey lasika parvon tak pahunch gaya he yaa nahin
 Conditioning is the main determinant of pre-diagnosis and the need for collaborative therapy
 aksar, meru rajju sampeedan yaa antra baadha jaise lakshanon ko niyantrit karne ke liye shalya chikitsa jaruri hoti he
 This is known as mitigation treatment
 vikiran chikitsa main cancer kii koshikaon or sankuchit ganth ko nasht karne ke liye ynikaran vikiran kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be controlled externally by external ray radiotherapy or can be controlled internally through brachytherapy
 vikiran chikitsa kaa prabhaav sthanikrut hota he or chikitsa kiye jane vaale kshetra tak hi simit rahata he
 Radiation therapy damages or destroys the cells of the area to be treated, in this action the genetic material of these cells is destroyed to prevent further division and growth in the cells
 And destroy both normal cells, most normal cells recover from the effects of radiation and begin to function properly Are
 vikiran chikitsa kaa lakshya he adhik se adhik cancer koshikaon ko nasht karnaa, jabaki aas-paas ke swasth utakon ko hone vaale nuksaan ko simit karnaa
 Therefore, it is given in many parts, which gives healthy tissues a chance to recover in the intervening period
 vikiran chikitsa, kaa upyog lagbhag har prakaar kii thos ganth ke upachaar ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen mastishk, stan, garbhashay greeva, galaa, fefde, agnyashay, prostate, twachaa, pet, garbhashay, yaa komal utak sarcoma ke cancer shaamil hai
 Radiation therapy may also be used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma
 prayek site ke liye vikiran kii khuraaq kai karkon par nirbhar karti he, ye kaarak hai, har prakaar ke cancer kii radio samvedansheeltaa or aas-paas ke utak yaa ang vikiran se nasht ho sakate hai yaa nahin
 Thus, in every type of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects
 rasochikitsa main un dawaaon se cancer kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he jo cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht kar sakati hai
 In current usage, the term "cookery" is used for cytotoxic or cytotoxic drugs that, unlike targeted therapies, affect rapidly dividing cells in general
 
 rasochikitsa dawaaen bhinn sambhav tareekon se koshika vibhaajan main baadha daalati hai, udhaaharan DNA kii pratikruti se yaa nav nirmit gunasutron ke pruthakkaran se
chemotherapy ke adhikansh rup tezi se vibhajit hoti hui sabhi koshikaon ko lakshya banaate hai, ye keval karkat kii koshikaon ke liye vishisht nahin hai, yadhyapi kuch vishistataa is vajah se aa jaati he ki adhikansh karkat kii koshikaayen diene kshati kii marammat main sakasham nahin hoti hai jabaki saamaanya koshikaon main aam taur par par ye kshamta hoti he
 Therefore, the cook has the potential to damage healthy tissues, especially tissues that have a high replacement rate
 These cells usually repair themselves after the surgery
 kyonki kuch dawaaen akele kii tulana main ek saath behatar kaary karti hai, isliye ek hi samay par do yaa adhik dawaaen di jaati hai
 This is called "combination cookery"; Most cook regimen regimens are given in combination only
 kuch prakaar ke leukemia or lasicarbud ke upachaar ke liye chemotherapy kii ucch khuraaq kii yaa puure sharir ke vikirnan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This treatment separates the bone marrow and hence the ability of the body to recover and reconstitute blood is severed
 is kaaran se, therapy ke pruthakkaran prabhaav se pehle asthi majja, yaa paridhiy rakt stambh koshika harvesting kii jaati he taaki upachaar ke baad "bachaav" sambhav ho
 This is known as autologous stem cell transplantation
 vaikalpik rup se, ek milan kiye gaye asambandhit daata se lee gayi hemetopoctic stem koshikaayen pratyaropit kii ja sakati hai
 Targeted therapy, which first became available in the late 1990s, had major effects in the treatment of several types of cancer and is currently a much more active research area
 isamen aise karkon kaa upyog shaamil he jo cancer koshikaon ke protein ko aniyamit karne ke liye vishishtikrut hote hai
 Small molecule targeted treatment drugs are usually inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, over-expressed, or other complex proteins within cancer cells
 pramukh udhaaharan hai thyrosine kynej sandamak imaatinib or jefitinib 
 Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the treatment factor is an antibody that binds exclusively to a protein on the surface of cancer cells
 udaahranon main shaamil hai stan cancer main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti- HER2 / neu pratirakshi trastucumeb or kai prakaar kii B-koshika durdamataaon main prayukt kiya jane vaala anti CD-20 pratirakshi rituximeb
 Targeted therapy may also include small peptides as a "homing device", which can form dams with the affected extracellular matrix around the knot or with receptors on the cell surface
 radio newclid jo in papteedon se jude hote hai, antat cancer koshika ko maar dete hai yadi newclid koshika ke aas paas apaghatit ho rahaa he
 In particular, oligo- or multimers of these bound materials are very important, as they increase the specificity and elongation of the knot
 prakaash gatik chikitsa cancer ke liye tihara upachaar he jisamen prakaash samvedak, utak oxigen, ore prakaash shaamil hai
 PDT is used for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma or lung cancer; PDT can also be useful in removing residual tissue residues after a large tumor is surgically removed
 cancer pratiraksha therapy bhinn chikitsa ranneetiyon kaa ek samooh he jise rogi ke apane pratiraksha tantra ko prerit karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he taaki vah gaanth se lard sake
 There are several methods to induce an immune response against the knot, these are intercostal BCG immunotherapy for superficial cystic cancer, and the use of interferone and other cytokines to induce immune responses in patients with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
 Intensive research is being conducted on the vaccines to produce an immune response specific to several types of lumps, particularly malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
 sipulukal-t prostate cancer ke liye aadhunik naidanik pareekshanon main ek vexine kii tarah kii ranneeti he, jisamen rogi se lee gayi drumashmi koshikaon ko prostetic amla phosphetege peptids ke saath lod kiya jaataa he, taaki prostate-vyutpann koshikaon ke khilaaf vishesh pratiraksha pratikriya ko prerit kiya ja sake
 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of immune therapy, as donor's immune cells frequently invade the knot under a graft-versus-knot effect
 isiilie, elloginenic HSCT, kai prakaar ke cancer ke liye autologus pratyaropan kii tulana main upachaar kii ucch dar kaa kaaran banati he, yadhyapi parshv dushprabhav bhi adhik gambhir hote hai
 The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking specific hormones
 hormone samvedi ganthon ke kuch saamaanya udhaaharan hai- vishesh prakaar ke stan or prostate cancer
estrogen yaa testosterone ko hataa dena yaa avaruddh kar dena aksar ek mahatvapurn atirikt upachaar he
 In certain types of cancers, the administration of hormones is relaxing, such as progestogen may be beneficial in medical terms
 vahikajanan jo tumor ko jivit rahane ke liye jaruri he
 Some, such as bevacizumab, have been recognized and are being used in medical use
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaon ke saath ek mukhya samasya yah he ki kai kaarak saamaanya or cancer yukt koshikaon main rakt vahiniyon kii vruddhi ko uttejit karte hai

 anya samasyaon main shaamil hai prashasan kaa maarg, sthirataa kaa rakh-rakhaav or tumor vahika sanrachana par kriya or lakshyikaran
 Although control over cancer symptoms cannot be considered a treatment for cancer, it is an important determinant of cancer patients' quality of life and plays a major role in the decision as to whether a patient is capable of other treatments
 haalanki doctoron ke paas, cancer ke rogiyon main dard, matlee, ulti, diaria, raktasrav or anya aam samasyaon ko kam karne ke liye chikitsakeey kaushal hota he, rogiyon ke is samooh kii lakshan niyantran kii aavashyaktaaon ke liye pratikriya main prashamak dekhbhaal kii bahul anushaasanamak visheshta kaa vikaas hua he
 Pain medications, such as morphine and oxycodone, and antiemetics to prevent nausea and vomiting, are commonly used in patients with symptoms related to cancer
 parishkrut antiemetics jaise ondencetron or ainalogus, saath hi aprepitint ne cancer rogiyon main ugr upachaar ko adhik sambhav bana diya he
 Chronic pain due to cancer is always due to continuous tissue damage that is related to the disease or treatment process
 Although effective disturbance also plays a role in the production of environmental factors and pain behaviors, patients with cancer pain are generally prominent
 Etiological reasons are not
 iske alaava, cancer se sambandhit bhayankar dard se yukt adhikansh rogi apane jivan kii antim avasthaa main hote hai or unhen prashamak chikitsa kii zarurat hoti he
 Issues such as social stigma of drug use, work and functional status and health care are not more important in overall case management
 atah, cancer dard prabandhan ke liye vishisht ranneeti he nashile padaarthon or anya dawaaon, shalya chikitsa or bhautik tareekon ke upyog ke dwaara rogi ko adhik se adhik aaraam pahunchne kii koshish karnaa
 Doctors do not want to use narcotics for pain in patients with end-stage cancer because they may be addicted to it or obstruct their breathing

 It is well known that Pandit Nehru and Mountbatten had a special relationship, which was not in common with any Indian Congressman or Muslim leader

 Mountbatten lived in India from 24 March 1947 to 30 June 1948
 in pandraa maheenon main vah na keval sanvaidhanik pramukh rahe balki bharat kii mahatvapurn nitiyon kaa nirnaayak bhi rahe
 Pt
 Nehru always considered him as his friend, guide and greatest advisor
 vah bhi pan nehru ko ek "shandaar", "sarvada vishwasaneey" "kalpanasheel" tathaa "saidhantik samaajawaadee" maanate rahe
 On the question of Kashmir too, Pandit Nehru gave utmost importance to Mountbatten's views

 Sheikh Abdullah did his msc in 1932 from Aligarh Muslim University

 shaikh abdulla ne 1940 main neshnal kfrons ke sammelan main mukhya atithi ke rup main pandit nehru ko bulaayaa tha
 Pandit Nehru's blind friendship with Sheikh Abdullah grew deeper
 shaikh abdulla samay-samay par apni shabdaawalee badalte rahe or pan nehru ko bhi dhokhaa dete rahe
 Later, Sheikh Abdullah's family's friendship with the Nehru family continued

 He was also aware that through the "quit Kashmir Movement", Sheikh Abdullah Maharaja was anxious to take over the rule himself

 Sheikh Abdullah invited Pandit Nehru to come to a conference in Srinagar
 is kfrons main mukhya prastaav tha maharaja kashmir ko hataane kaa
 Maharaja was forced to ask Pandit Nehru not to come to this conference
 par na maanane par pan nehru ko jammu main hi srinagar jane se purv roak diya gaya
 Pt
 Nehru considered it an insult and he did not forget it throughout his life

 Sheikh Abdullah was doubly pleased with this incident

 There are many instances when he was not ready to listen to the advice of the central administration in the case of Kashmir, the then Foreign Secretary YD

 He sent his military secretary three times to meet Maharaja Kashmir
 tatkaaleen kashmir ke pradhanmantri kaak ne bhi unase milaane kaa vaayada kiya tha
 But the Maharaja repeatedly postponed the conversation as an excuse for illness
 jinna ne garmiyon kii chuttee kashmir main bitaane kii ijaajat chaahi thi
 But the Maharaja politely avoided this request and said that he would not be able to complete the formalities of accommodating the Governor General of a neighboring country

 Pandit Nehru also felt humiliated

 Perhaps they wanted Kashmir to be merged with Pakistan, because they told Mehrchand Mahajan that it was appropriate for Kashmir to become part of Pakistan, given the "geographical location"

 After all, Mountbatten held a "security Committee" meeting on 24 October

 The committee met again on 26 October

 Finally, on 26 October, Sardar Patel sent his secretary V
P
 Menon was asked to bring the merger document containing the Maharaja's signature

 Thirdly, on the advice of Mountbatten, Pandit Nehru took the matter of Kashmir to the UN Security Council on January 1, 1948

jpg samudr par durghatana ke samay logon kii jaan bachaane yaa maal bachaane uddhaar ko kehete hai
 To save lives or goods from fire on the land can also be called salvation, but this word is not very popular in this regard
 samudr par uddhaar ke do vibhaag hai : naagarik, sainik For the salvation of life and property, the British Government grants reward from British ships and hence the matter often reaches the courts
 england main navik kachhariyon main ye maamle tay kiye jate hai

 bhoomi par agni se jaan yaa maal bachaane par sarkaar paritoshik nahin dilaati; haan, maalik se sanvida ho gaya ho to baat duusari he
 The rule is that the remaining money can be spent on other subjects only by giving a reward of salvation before salvaged goods
 jab bachaaya gaya maal paritoshik ke liye paryaapt nahin hota to british sarkaar marakentine marine fund se anshat: yaa purnataya paritoshik dilaa sakati he
 Also, there is a rule that the ship's officer who does not help in saving life is punishable

 Inadvertently, the reward may be partially or completely stopped
 yadi ek jahaaj duusare ko bachaata he to bachaanevaale jahaaj ke maalikon ko paritoshik kaa lagbhag teen chauthai miltaa he
 The captain gets about one third of the remainder
 iske baad bachaa bhaag adhikariyon or karmchaariyon main unki sthiti ke anusaar baant diya jaataa he
 But where there is any damage to the rescuing ship, the owners get more

 Rewards can be found up to an eighth or sixth part of the value of the ship

 Hunger is experienced when there is a desire to eat food
 paritripti bhukh kaa abhaav he
 The feeling of hunger begins with the hypothalamus when it releases hormones
 yah hormone yakrut ke abhigraahak par pratikriya karti he
 However, a normal person can live for several weeks without food
 bhukh kii anubhuti bhojan ke kuch ghanton baad shuru ho jaati he or vyakti asahaj mahasoos karne lagata he
 The word hunger is used to describe the social level of a person
 jab amashay main marod dene lagata he
 Hunger cramps often begin no earlier than twelve to twenty-four hours after a meal
 bhukh kaa ek marod kareeb 30 second tak rahata he
 And this lasted for 30–45 minutes
 iske baad bhukh 30-150 minuton tak kam ho jaataa he The fluctuation of leptin and ghrelin hormone levels results in the motivation of an organism to consume food
 When an organism eats, adipocytes trigger the release of leptin into the body
 Increasing levels of leptin results in a reduction of one's motivation to eat
 After hours of non-consumption, leptin levels drop significantly
 These low levels of leptin cause the release of secondary hormone, ghrelin, which in turn reinitiates the feeling of hunger
 Some studies have suggested that an increased production of ghrelin may enhance appetite evoked by the sight of food, while an increase in stress may also influence the hormone's production
 These findings may help to explain why hunger can prevail even in stressful situations
 Hunger appears to increase activity and movement in many animals - for example, an experiment on spiders showed increased activity and predation in starved spiders, resulting in larger weight gain
 This pattern is seen in many animals, including humans while sleeping
 It even occurs in rats with their cerebral cortex or stomachs completely removed
 Increased activity on hamster wheels occurred when rats were deprived not only of food, but also water or vitamins such as thiamine
 This response may increase the animal's chance of finding food, though it has also been speculated the reaction relieves pressure on the home population
 On June 19, 2009, it was reported that world hunger hit one billion people, about a sixth of the world's total population
 There were 923 million hungry people in the world in 2007, an increase of 80 million since 1990
 The world already produces enough food to feed everyone - 6 billion people - and could feed the double - 12 billion people
 The Meals On Wheels Association of America Foundation has found that hunger is a serious threat facing millions of seniors in the United States, and that understanding the problem is a critical first step to developing remedies
 In 2007, MOWAAF, underwritten by the Harrah's Foundation, commissioned a research study entitled The Causes, Consequences and Future of Senior Hunger in America
 The report was released at a hearing of the U
S
 Senate Special Committee on Aging in March 2008 in Washington, D
C
 The study found that in the United States, over 5 million seniors ,, experience some form of food insecurity
 Of these, about 2
5 million are at-risk of hunger, and about 750,000 suffer from hunger due to financial constraints
 Some groups of seniors are more likely to be at-risk of hunger
 Relative to their representation in the overall senior population, those with limited incomes, under age 70, African American, Hispanic, never-married, renters, and seniors living in the Southern United States are all the more likely to be at-risk of hunger
 While certain groups of seniors are at greater-risk of hunger, hunger cuts across the income spectrum
 For example, over 50% of all seniors who are at-risk of hunger have incomes above the poverty threshold
 Likewise, it is present in all demographic groups
 For example, over two-thirds of seniors at-risk of hunger are Caucasian
 There are marked differences in the risk of hunger across family structure, especially for those seniors living alone, or those living with a grandchild
 Those living alone are twice as likely to experience hunger compared to married seniors
 One in five senior parties with a grandchild present is at-risk of hunger, compared to about one in twenty banks without a grandchild present
 Seniors living in non-metropolitan areas are as likely to experience food insecurity as those living in metropolitan areas, suggesting that food insecurity cuts across the urban-rural continuum
 Those living alone are twice as likely to experience hunger compared to married seniors
 One in five senior parties with a grandchild present is at-risk of hunger, compared to about one in twenty banks without a grandchild present

 a food craving is an intense desire to consume a specific food, as opposed to general hunger
 Similarly, thirst is the craving for fluids
 Withdrawal craving is a "hunger" for administering addictive drugs
 Found cycle: World cinemaworld cinema is a term used primarily in English language speaking countries to refer to the films and film industries of non-english speaking countries
 It is therefore often used interchangeably with the term Foreign film
 However, both World Cinema and Foreign film could be taken to refer to the films of all countries other than one's own, regardless of native language
 Technically, foreign film does not mean the same as foreign language film, but the inference, particularly in the U
S
, is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used
 As such, the use of the term foreign film for films produced in the UK, Australia, Canada or other English speaking countries would be uncommon
 In other English speaking countries, it would be extremely unlikely to class films made in the US as foreign films, or related to world cinema, as American films are reasonably effective in all English-language markets
 World cinema has an un-official implication of films with "artistic value" as opposed to "hollywood commercialism
" Foreign language films are often grouped with "art House films" and other independent films in DVD stores, cinema listings etc
unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English speaking regions usually have English subtitles
 Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas
 As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood blockbusters
 The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "world Cinema" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers
 Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales
 Foreign language films can be commercial, low brow or B-movies, so to automatically assume that World Cinema is "arty" or intellectual is erroneous
 Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings
 Films of this ilk are becoming more common, and recent examples such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Amélie and Brotherhood of the Wolf enjoyed great success in Western cinemas and DVD sales
 The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American box office was Hero in the fall of 2004
 This is a list of recent successful world cinema films in United States cinemas
 Foreign language films that are particularly successful in international markets may be taken on by the large film distribution companies for DVD releases
 At the other end of the scale, many foreign language films are never given a DVD release outside of their home markets
 The majority of those dvds that are given an international release, come out on specialist labels

 The Government Sanskrit College was the first college in Varanasi
 isaki sthapana 1791 main hui thi
 Many eminent teachers came out of this college
 san 1958 main yah sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay main mila liya gaya
 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favor of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed,

 teesri putali chandrakala ne jo katha sunai vah is prakaar he- ek baar purusharth or bhagya main is baat par than gai ki koun bada he
 Purushartha would say that nothing is possible without hard work, whereas fate believed that whoever gets by luck has no role of hard work
 unke vivaad ne aisa ugr rup grahan kar liya ki donon ko devraj indra ke paas janaa padaa
 The fight was very complicated, so Indra too got confused
 purusharth ko ve nahin maanate jinhen bhagya se hi sab kuch praapt ho chukaa tha
 On the other hand, if fortune was said to be big, then Purushartha would provide an example of those who had earned everything through hard work
 asamanjas main pad gaye or kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunche
 After much thought he remembered Vikramaditya
 unhen laga saare vishwa main is jhagade kaa samaadhaan sirf vahi kar sakate he
 He told Purushartha and Bhagya to go to Vikramaditya
 purusharth or bhagya maanav bhesh main vikram ke paas chal pade
 Coming to Vikram, he spoke about his quarrel
 vikramaditya ko bhi turant koi samaadhaan nahin soojha
 He asked for an extension of six months from both of them and asked them to come after six months
 jab ve chale gaye to vikramaditya ne kaaphi sochaa
 Unable to reach any conclusion, he started walking in disguise among the general public
 kaaphi ghoomane ke baad bhi jab koi santoshjanak hal nahin khoj paae to duusare rajyon main bhi ghoomane kaa nirnay kiya
 Even after going astray, when no solution was found, he got a job with a businessman
 vyapaaree ne unhen naukari unke yah kehane par ki jo kaam duusare nahin kar sakate hai ve kar denge, di
 a few days later, he loaded his goods on a merchant ship and started by sea to trade in other countries
 anya naukaron ke alaava uske saath vikramaditya bhi the
 The ship must have gone a little too far that a terrible storm arrived
 jahaaj par savaar logon main bhay or hataasha kii lahar daud gai
 Somehow the ship came to an island and was anchored there
 jab tufaan samaapt hua to lungar uthaaya jane laga
 But the anchor could not be lifted by anyone
 ab vyapaaree ko yaad aayaa ki vikramaditya ne yah kahkar naukari lee thi ki jo koi na kar sakegaa ve kar denge
 He asked Vikram to lift the anchor
 lungar unase aasaani se uth gaya
 As soon as the anchor was lifted, the ship moved at such a speed that Vikram was left on the island
 unki samaj main nahin aayaa kya kiya jaae
 Wandered around the island
