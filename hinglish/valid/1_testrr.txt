 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 fatima jinnah maadar-e millat yani janata kii maan, qaayade aazam ke jivan main maadar-e millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen
 Our expert historian Ausajya has given a very high position to Maadar Milat as the sister who takes care of quaid-e-azam's house, but he has not paid much attention to the amazing effects he has left on the political map of Pakistan and especially after 1965
 yah ek sarthak baat he ki kaayade ajam ke jivan main maadar millat unke hammer uh prabhavi rup se 19 saal rahen yani 1929 se 1948 tak or mrityu shuukravaar ke baad bhi itnaa hi samay jivit raheen yani 1946 se 1967 tak lekin is duusare daur main unki apni vyakti kuch is tarah ubhari or unke vichaaron bhoomika kuch is tarah nakhre kar saamne aae ki unhen baja liye kaayade ajam kii loktantric 'be baak or paardarshee raajnneetik mulyon ko aazasar nau jivit karne kaa shrey diya ja saktaa he jinhen shaasha bhul chuke the
 In this connection, the prayers expressed by Madar Miltat show his strong hold on contemporary political science and affairs to the extent of unswerving faith
 1965 ke raashtrapati chunaav ke maukey par ayyub khan kii aalochana ke jawaab main maadar millat ne khud kaha tha ki ayyub sainya maamalon kaa visheshgy ho saktaa he lekin raajnneetik samaj or fraasat maine kaayade ajam sidhe praapt he or yah aisa kshetra he jisamen amar bilkul naa deshaantar he
 The events arising after 1965 are enough to corroborate this statement of madamalat
 udhaaharan ke maadar millat ne jin khataron kii baar baar pahchaan kii unamem se kuch hai: The details that Madarmalat gave to warn Noah of other national and international affairs and warn of the threat posed by the government and the public represent his distant eyes and political visionaries
 agar ham ni maadar millat ke rubaru kat anatabah par kaan dhare hote or khataron se bachane kaa aayojan kiya hota jo unki nigahen saaf taur par dekh rahi thim to aaj ham kattarpanthi raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik bahraanon kii chapet main na hote jo hamaare raashtra raat or din saamana kar rahi he or yah baat to sunishchit maaloom hoti he ki purvi pakistan kaa daliraash ghatana site vikasshil na hota
 Regardless of the manner in which he spent nights and days and the sacrifices he made for the nation and Muslims, Madar Miltat's political life is certainly a factor in his ideal role
 in karkon main paanch vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai:pehla: vah ek adarsh garillo mahila thim
 a home full of wasteful spending and simple but necessary assurances and facilities
 a system of food and rest for the quaid-e-azam
 When i returned home, i would find a sister and sister present for my reception
 yahi vah santoshjanak or aa soda swadeshi maahaul tha jiske fel apni beemaari ke baavjood kaayade ajam apni puri lagan or ek sui ke saath andolan pakistan kaa mayaabi dilaane kar sake
 Two: One important lesson from Mather Millat's life is that women should have a path to pro-professional education so that they are financially self-sufficient and can also increase the national income
 maadar millat ne daanton ke ilaaj chikitsak main krasis hasil kii or kai saal tak par acts or is dauraan garibon kaa muft ilaaj kiya
 Swayamsevak: Madarmalat has spent almost part of his life in the uncountable social and economic institutions of the head, Sati only and has been instrumental in helping their progress and development, providing services to Kashmiri immigrants with little help
 chauthaa: maadar millat kaa sabase mahatvapurn uplabdhi pakistan ko loktantr ke raste par phir chalane karnaa he unhone 1965 ke raashtrapati chunaav main bhaag lekar andolan pakistan ke hamaa padaarth saarvajanik bhagidaari kii yaaden tazaa kar or purvi or pashchimi pakistan ke bich ek jahati or igaangat ke bhaawanaaon ko jaagruk kiya
 Although he was defeated by rigging, it resulted in the end of Ayub Khan's military ruler within a few years
 madarmalat raajnneetik sangharsh main pakistan kii mahilaon ke liye yah sandesh mazamar he ki raajnneetishastra se sambandhit nahin rahanaa chahie
 Political consciousness should be created within itself and by taking full participation in elections, the country and honest people should be made successful
 pancham: ucch halkonaor satta ke galiyaaron main ghoomane ke baavjood maadare irani islamic shayre ke anusaar rahane or apane aap ko har prakaar ke ghotaale se surakshit rakhaa
 She was very self-respecting and respected like quaid-e-azam
 She was an admirer of Ekta Islami and was keenly interested in teaching Qur'an Majeed's education for a young student
 mahilaon or khaskar chaatraon yah kartavya lagaaya he ki vah kaayade ajam kii priy bahan kii hayaat or sevaaon kaa adhyayan karen or apane bheetar kam se kam vah gun paidaa karen jinka upar ullekh kiya gaya he
 It is through these characteristics that women can contribute in a great way in national development and construction
 maadare irani kuch naye afaroz vichaaron: maadare millat kii hayaat or sevaaon ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki pakistan ke samaaj kaa nirmaan or nirmaan or vikaas nitiyon ke bare main spasht vichaar rakhti thim
 As stated earlier, it would not be right to consider them merely a domestic woman
 vah kaayade ajam kii mrityu ke baad 19 saal tak jivit raheen or desh ke raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik or shaikshik samasyaon ke bare main tawaatur ke saath apni aara detii raheen
 The Punjab University Research Society of Pakistan has more than two hundred Takahari and its new Afro comments on internal and external matters have been found in other books
 in vichaaron or bayanon maargdarshan ke liye kaayade ajam maujuud na the
 Mather Miltat was very fond of books and studies and thought independently of various matters
 unke vichaaron or vichaaron ke bare main abhi tak koi vishleshiki lekhan nazar nahin lagi
 Here four of his statements are recorded in sample form which reveal the problematic hold of problems: islamic shikshaaon: is samay duniya ajeeb daur se guzar rahi he or yah kahana mushkil he ki kashmakash kaa kya nateeja hoga
 is samay sabase badi samasya jo sari duniya ke liye dard sir bana hua he vah yah ki bani noi insaan main kis tarah igaangat or samanta sthapit kii xxrep 9 
 Kashmir: Then Pakistan faces various issues and it is proven immortal that Kashmir is the most important among them
 pratirohak bindu drushti se kashmir pakistan ke jivan or aatma kii haisiyat rakhata he
 Economically, Kashmir is our source of time
 pakistan ke bade nadi usee rajya kii seemaa se guzar kar pakistan main daakhil hote or hamaari khushhaali main dete iske bina pakistan ke marafi samay khatre main pad jaaegi
 If God does not stop himself, we will be deprived of a large part of the status given to nature by depriving us of Kashmir
 kashmir hamaari madafit kaa pramukh bindu he
 If the enemy gets a chance to form a front in Kashmir Sundarrat valley and mountains, then it is immortal that we will try to interfere in our affairs and run a custom
 so apane aap ko majboot or sachmuch shaktishaalee raashtra banane ke liye yah bahut zaruri he ki pakistan ko dushman kii aisi gatividhiyon kii chapet main na aane diya jaae
 is lihaaj se kashmir kii hamaara pehla kartavya ho jaataa he
 Internal stability: what is the situation today? Internally we are deprived of the nexus of the objective process, externally we do not have the respect and respect we deserve
 aap aasshab nafs or sochen ki uski jimmedaari kis par he nishchit rup se aapako vah adchane pesh nahin jo azaadi se pehle do mahaan shaktishaalee kii tulana main dar pesh thim kiya isaki vajah yah he ki aap ab tak kaa netritv paidaa karne main asafal rahe jo aapke vichaaron or samanta kii sidak dilli se samarthan ho?kayaas vajah yah he ki aap azaadi kaa matlab mehnat or sangharsh ke bajaay aaraam or tan aasaani samaj liya he kya isaki vajah yah he ki apane dushmano ko mauka diya jaae ki vah doston ke bhes menaap kii safon main araajaktaa paidaa karenaor in vichaaron se aapako bahakaayenjan ke liye pakistan samajharaz astitv main aayaa tha
 These are questions that you should answer yourself
 aajkal videsh niti or videsh maamalon par yahaan badi baaten ho rahi hai lekin mere raay he ki in baton main sachai parichit ko bahut kam dakhal he
 It is most welcome that if we rectify the situation, if the vote gets political and economic stability, then it is also considered a privilege abroad
 uski videsh niti to shaayad kisi ko pasand aae yaa na aae lekin sammaan se dekha jaataa he
 Democracy: Internal and external problems are in our way
 ham vibhinn azatishon se guzare hai ham pareshaan kin kshan aae hai, lekin hamaara vishwaas matzalsal nahin hua or ham niraash nahin hue
 Today, ten years later, we should survey how successful we were in getting public meetings
 pakistan kuch jaah pasand logon kii shikaar sthal banane ke liye sthapit nahin hua tha jahaan vah lakhon logon ke aansoon, paseene or khun par pul kar mote hote rahen
 Pakistan was for the attainment of social justice, equality, distillation, collective good, peace and bliss
 aaj hamen is uddeshy se dur phenk diya gaya he
 You must know whose hidden hand is it that has poisoned in public life, there are increasing conspiracies and bargains for private interests and power

 You must unite to protect the constitution and stop the trend of non-democracy, demand for early elections is the only solution to this situation

 Kumbh festival is an important festival of Hinduism, in which crores of devotees take bath in Kumbh festival at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik
 inamen se prayek sthaan par prati barahawein varsh or prayag main do kumbh parvon ke bich chah varsh ke antaraal main ardhakumbh bhi hota he
 The 2013 Kumbh took place in Prayag
 2019 main prayag main ardhakumbh meley kaa aayojan hoga
 According to astronomical calculations, this fair starts on the day of Makar Sankranti, when the Sun and Moon enter Scorpio, and Jupiter, Aries
 makar sankranti ke hone vaale is yoga ko "kumbh snaan-yoga" kehete hai or is din ko vishesh mangalik mana jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki is din prithvi se ucch lokon ke dwaar is din khulte hai or is prakaar is din snaan karne se aatma ko ucch lokon kii prapti sahajata se ho jaati he
 Bathing here is considered to be a heavenly vision

 The last Kumbh in Haridwar took place in 1998
 haridwar main 26 janvari se 14 may 2004 tak chalaa tha ardh kumbh mela, uttaranchal rajya ke gathan ke pashchaat aisa pratham avasar tha
 During this, 14 April 2004 was considered the most auspicious day for the holy bath
 puranic vishwaas jo kuch bhi ho, jyotishiyon ke anusaar kumbh kaa asaadhaaran mahatv brihaspati ke kumbh raashi main pravesh tathaa surya ke mesh raashi main pravesh ke saath judaa he
 The position of the planets medicates the Ganges water at Har ki Pauri place on the banks of the Ganges flowing from Haridwar and it becomes nectaric in those days
 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation
 haalaanki sabhi hindu tyohaar samaan shraddha or bhakthi ke saath manaae jate he, par yahan ardh kumbh tathaa kumbh meley ke liye aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya sabase adhik hoti he
 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell
 mahakumbh 2013 snaan ke liye kumbh main jo din vishesh hai wo is prakaar hai - There is a village in Anilapur district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India in Valichlimal

 Model construction was successfully applied in 1951 by Linus Pauling in explaining the structure of the alpha helix
 In fact, he based his model on Franklin and Gosling's data which still had sufficient specific knowledge
 do prayogshaala nirdeshkon ke ghere main ek samjhaute ke parinaam ke rup main, unke eks-re vivartan data shaamil he jo wilkins or franklin, dwaara lekh, maaloom hota he keval crik ke samarthan main, sanshodhit or phir prakruti kaa ek hi ank main duusare or tisare prakashit kiye gaye the or watasan diene ke bi farm ke liye ek model kaa prastaav he jo saidhantik kaagaj
 Weeks later, on April 10, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see his model
 franklin bhi watasan-crik model ko dekhne ke baad samay se pehle model ke nirmaan ke liye use andeh barkaraar rakhaa, or khush nahin bana rahaa
 She is reported to have commented, "it's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in the production of more and more evidence before proven publication — as a proposed model
 jaise, watasan-crik model ke liye uski pratikriya vigyaan ke liye uski satark drushtikon ke saath dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya tha

 Just before the end of the war, he proposed to Germany and his surrender to the Western Allies, provided he was spared the trial
 After being arrested by the British Army, he committed suicide before being questioned
 henrik himalar kaa janm munich main ek roman catholic bavarian madhya-vargeey parivaar main hua tha
 His father Joseph Gebhard Himmler was a secondary school teacher and principal of the prestigious Wittelbecker Gymnasium
 unki maa anna maaria himalar, ek dharmanishth roman catholic thim
 He had an older brother, Gebhard Ludwig Himmler, born July 29, 1898; And a younger brother, Ernst Hermann Himmler, who was born on 23 December 1905
 henrik kaa naam unke dharmpita bavaria ke shahi parivaarake prince henrik of bavaria ke naam par padaa tha, jinhen gebhard himalar padhaayaa karte the
 In 1910, Himmler was admitted to the Gymnasium of Landshut, where he studied fine literature

 Throughout his youth from his adult years, Himmler was never comfortable in relationships with women

 He pleaded with his father to use his royal contacts to get him the post of an officer candidate
 uske mata-pita ne antat baat maan lee or unhen 11veen bavarian regiment se prashikshan lene kii anumati de di
 Since he was not an athletic, he had to struggle a lot during his military training
 The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany, thus ending Himmler's aspirations to become a professional army officer
 1919 se 1922 tak himalar ne munich technisk hokshul se krishi vigyaan kii padhai kii, uske baad kuch dinon tak ek farm main prashikshan lene ke baad ve biimaar pad gayi
 In his diary he claims to be a devout Roman Catholic and has written that he can never leave the Roman Church
 However, he was a member of a fraternity and later joined the Thule Society and felt that both of these relations did not coincide with the principles of the Church
 Biographers define Himmler's theology as Eriosophy, his own Aryan racial superiority and the theological hegemony of Germanic meso-paganism, partly from his own interpretation of the folklore of northern Europe and the mythology of ancient Teutonic tribes

 Himmler at that time became friends with Hedwig Potthast, a secretary
 jisane 1941 main apni naukari chhod di or unki shrimati ban gayi
 With this he became the father of two children - a son Helge and a daughter Nanette Dorothia

 At that time, the SS had 280 members and the very large Sturmabteilung was just one elite battalion
 agle saal, himalar ne sanghathan main ek bada vistaar shuru kiya or 1930 main, unhen pronnati dekar eses-gruppenfuharer bana diya gaya 
 By 1933, the SS had 52,000 members

 In July 1932, black SS uniforms were replaced by SA brown shirts, and by 1934 enough uniforms were ready for the general use of all
 1933 main, himalar ko padonnati dekar eses-obergruppenfuharer bana diya gaya
 This made him the equivalent of the senior SA commander, who now hated the SS and was jealous of its power
 himalar, harman goring or general varnor won blomberg is baat par sahamat the ki ese or uske netaa ernest roham german sena or naji ke samaksh ek khatra ban rahe hai
 Röhm was of socialist and populist views and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki ese ko desh kaa ekmaatr astradhari sainya dal hona chahie
 For this reason some Nazi, military and political leaders felt that Rohm wanted to overthrow the use of SA
 himalar or goring ke uksaane par, roham ke khatme ke liye hitler sahamat ho gayi
 He entrusted this task to Reinhard Hedrick, Kurt Daluage and Warner Best, who ordered the extermination of Rohm and other senior officials; Also ordered to eliminate some of Hitler's personal enemies, these works were done on 30 June 1934, which is known as Night of the Clove Knife
 agle din, eses ek swatantra sanghathan ban gaya, jo sirf hitler ke prati javabdeh tha or himalar kaa rikhfuharer-eses kaa khitaab eses kaa aupchaarik sarvocch pad ban gaya
 On 20 April 1934, Göring formed a partnership with Himmler and Hedrick
 goring ne gestapo, prashia kii jasusi sanstha, ke praadhikaar kaa sthanantaran kar uskaa jimmaa himalar ko saunp diya, jinhen prashia ke baahar german police kaa pramukh bhi bana diya gaya
 On 22 April 1934, Himmler appointed Hedrick as head of the Gestapo
 hedrick esady ke bhi pramukh bane rahe
 On 17 June 1936, Himmler was made head of the German police after Hitler announced his decision to "consolidate the police control of the Reich"
 paramparaagat rup se, germany main kanoon pravartan ek rajyastareey or sthaneey maamla tha
 In this role, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick
 However, the decree effectively merged the police with the SS, making it almost independent of Frick's control
 germany kii sabhi vardidhari kaanoon pravartan agenciyon ke ek nae ordanugspolizi main ek hone se himalar kii takat badhi, is nayi sanstha kaa mukhyalay eses kii ek mukhyalay shakha ban gaya
 Despite his title, Himmler gained only partial control of the uniformed police

 In 1943, when Himmler was appointed interior minister, the transfer of ministerial power was completed

 This merger was never completed within the Reich, Kripo remained mainly under the control of his civil administration and later became a party tool
 Although the occupied territories were not included in the original Reich, Sipo's integration within the ss's command line proved mostly effective
 sitambar 1939 ko, dwitiya yuddh ke aarambh ke baad, himalar ne rikhassikarheitshauptamt kaa gathan kiya, jahaan sipo tathaa shricherheitsdienst hedrick kii kaman ke vibhaag ban gayi
 Himmler oversaw the system of the entire torture camp
 Once World War II began, new detention camps not formally classified as torture camps were established, with no control of Himmler and the SS
 1943 main, stalingrad tabaahi ke parinamswaroop shashan kii lokapriy maukhik aalochana kii aalochana ke prakope ke baad party ne in aalochanaon ko roak paane main gestapo kii vifaltaa par niraashaa jaahir kii, polithische staffeln ke rup main apane raajnneetik police ang kii sthapana kii, is tarah is kshetra main gestapo ke ekadhikaar ko tod diya gaya
 During these years the SS developed its military arm ss-verfügungstruppe, which later developed into the waffen-ss
 naam ke liye himalar ke maatahat hone ke baavjood wafphen-eses ko puri tarah se ek sainya dhaanche main dhaala gaya or veharmat ke samanaantar yuddh prayaas main shaamil hone laayak viksit kiya gaya
 Many contemporary commentators refused to recognize the waffen-ss as a respectable military organization
 isaki ikaiyaan nagarikon or nihathe kaidiyon kii hatya kii kukhyat ghatnaon main shaamil thim
 This was also one of the reasons that the International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization
 nit of da nives ke baad, eses-totancopaverbande ne germany ke yatnaa shiviron kii sthapana kii or prashasit kiya, 1941 ke baad, poland main sanhaar shivi bhi banaaye
 The SS, through its Intelligence Branch Security Service, began putting Jews, Gypsies, Communists, and other cultural, racial, political or religious individuals whom the Nazis considered either Antarmensch or anti-regime, into concentration camps
 22 march 1933 ko himalar ne dachaau main aise pehle shivi kaa aarambh kiya
 He was the main architect of the Holocaust, he used elements of mysticism and a staunch belief in racist Nazi doctrine to justify the killing of millions
 Himmler had a similar plan for the Poles; The intellectuals were to be killed and they believed that the other Polish people were merely literate to understand the traffic signals
 himalar ke mulaakaat pustika se pataa chalata he ki 18 disambar 1941 ko himalar kii bhent hitler ke saath hui thi
 In the Indraj of that day the question was raised "what should be done with the Jews of Russia?" And then the answer to the question was "als partisanane oszurotan"

 Himmler wanted a ruling breed of Nordic Aryans in Germany
 ek murgipalak kisaan ke rup main unhone apane anubhav se pashu prajnan ke mul tatv ko siikhaa tha, jise ve maanav jati par prasthaapit karnaa chaahate the
 They believed that they could replace the German population by selective breeding with excellent progeny, which would become completely "nordic" several decades after the war
 4 oktober 1943 ko, himalar ne pojnan shahar main eses kii ek gupt baithak main spasht rup se yahudee janata ke khatme kaa ullekh kiya
 The following is an excerpt from an transcript of an audio recording of speech: i am now referring to the evacuation of the Jews, to the extermination of the Jewish People
 This is something that is easily said: 'the Jewish People will be exterminated', says every Party member, 'this is very obvious, it is in our program — elimination of the Jews, extermination, a small matter
' And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew
 They say the others are all swine, but this particular one is a splendid Jew
 But none has observed it, endured it
 Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000
 To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of
 Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war
 If the Jews were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and '17 
 
 
 
 —heinrich Himmler, 4 October 1943 Bricha Surviving Remnant Displaced persons In 1939 Himmler planned Operation Himmler, controversially it was the first World War II operation in Europe
 1941 main soviet sangh par akraman ke pehle himalar ne apane eses ko "judeo-bolshevvaad" kii takaton ke khilaaf sanhaar yuddh ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 Himmler was always happy by comparing Nazi Germany and the Middle Ages, comparing the invasion to the Crusade
 They collected volunteers from all over Europe, especially Nordic people who were considered racially closest to the Germans, such as Dens, Norwegians, Swedes and Dutch
 After the invasion, Ukrainians, Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonian volunteers were also reinstated, attracting non-german volunteers by declaring an all-european crusade to protect the traditional values of Old Europe from the "atheist Bolshevik gang"
 hajaaron swechha se bhartee hue or usase bhi kahin zyada log jabariyaa bhartee kiye gayi
 The natives of the Baltic states were ready to act against the Red Army, as the persecution aroused hatred after being annexed by the Soviet Union
 in logon ko jabaran wafphen-eses main bhartee kiya gaya tha, inhen soviet sena ke khilaaf laga diya gaya, tab ye kushi ke saath is kaam main jute gayi
 Western and Nordic Europe found very few people to recruit the waffen-ss, but several waffen-ss army units were established, such as the Vallonian military contingent led by Leon Degrelle, who regained Nazi territory after the war Himmler had plans to become Chancellor of Burgundy
 1942 main, himalar ke daahine haath reinhard hedrick kii praha ke kareeb ek hamale ke baad check vishesh sena ke haathon maare gayi, check sena ko british kufia vibhaag tathaa checkoslov vidrohiyon se sahaayta mil rahi thi
 Himmler immediately retaliated, killing the entire population of Lidice village, including women and children
 1943 main, himalar ko us frick kii jagah rikh kaa aantarik mantri niyukt kiya gaya, jiske saath ve ek dashak se bhi adhik samay se sangharshrat the
 For example, Frick had tried to limit the widespread use of "defensive detention" to send people to concentration camps for the purpose of merely confessing to Himmler
 yatnaa shiviron ko frick bhinnmtavalambiyon ko dandit karne ke ek upkaran ke rup main dekha karte, jabaki himalar kii raay main in shiviron ke jariye logon ko aatankit karke naji shashan ko sweekaar karana tha
 Himmler's appointment effectively merged the interior ministry with the SS
 himalar ne apane nae karyaalay kaa istemaal lok seva se party upkaran ke sangyojan ko ulatney main kiya or jila-kshetreey str ke party netaaon ke adhikaron ko chunauti deni shuru kii
 Hitler's personal secretary and party chancellor Martin Bormann's blow to his ambition came as a shock
 khud hitler se bhi ise kuch naaraazgi jhelni padi, jinke naji prashasan kii soch kii ek neenv paaramparik lok seva ke prati lambey samay se ghrinaa rahi
 After becoming the chief of the Reserve Army, Himmler made the situation worse, he transferred policemen to the waffen-ss and tried to use the powers of both the army and the police
 apane satta ke aadhaar ko himalar chunauti dete rahe, lekin borman ne unhen teji se aage badhane kaa mauqaa nahin diya, haalanki virodh shuru hone ke pehle tak shuruyaat main ve chup rahe the
 Then, as Bormann began opposing the plan, Himmler began to be disgraced, especially in the party, whose goliators, ie local leaders, began to see Bormann as their protector
 yah nirdhaarit hua tha ki german sena ke kufia vibhaag ke bade adhikari or khud uske pramukh admiral wilhilm canaaris hitler kii htya kii 20 july 1944 kii sajeesh main shaamil the
 For this reason Hitler decided to dissolve Abwehr and make Himmler's security service the only intelligence service of the Third Reich
 isse himalar kii vyaktigat shakti main vruddhi hui
 The commander-in-chief of the Reserve Army, General Frederick Fromm, was implicated in a conspiracy
 sena ke prati hitler ke andeh or fromm kii barkhaastagi se himalar ke fromm kaa uttaradhikari banane kaa rasta khul gaya, wafphen-eses ke vistaar ke liye unhone is pad kaa durupyog kiya, jisase german sashastr sena kii pehle se teji se karaab hoti haalat or bhi badtar hone lagi
 Unfortunately for Himmler, the investigation soon revealed the involvement of SS officers in the conspiracy, including some senior officers who used to follow Borman's struggle against SS at his behest, as very few party workers gave officers Was implicated
 isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn baat yah he ki eses ke kuch varisht adhikari khud himalar ke viruddh shadyantr karne lage, kyonki unka maananaa tha ki borman ke khilaaf satta sangharsh main unki jeet nahin ho sakati
 in dalbadaluon main hedrick ke uttaradhikari rikhsicherheitsahauptamt ke pramukh ernest kaltembrunner or gestapo ke pramukh gruppenfuharer henrikh mular bhi the
 In late 1944, Himmler became the commander-in-chief of the newly formed Army Group Upper Rhine
 rin ke pashchimi tat par alsaas kshetra main aage badhati hui america 7veen army or francisi 1lee army se ladane ke liye is army group kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The American 7th Army was under the command of General Alexander Patch and the French 1st Army, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny
 1 janvari 1945 ko, himalar ke army group ne americanyon or francisiyon ko peeche dhakelne ke liye oparation north wind shuru kiya
 In late January, Himmler was moved eastwards after some limited initial success
 24 janvari tak, rakshaatmak hone ke kaaran army group apper rin ko niskriy kar diya gaya
 Operation North Wind officially ended on 25 January
 duusari ore, german sena laal fuj ke vistula-odher aakraamakata ko roak paane main vifal rahi, tab hitler ne himalar ko ek anya navgathit sainya group kaa kaman saunpa, is army group vistula ko berlin kii ore badhati soviet sena ko rokna tha
 Despite the failure of the Army Group Upper Rhine and his complete lack of experience and inability to lead the Army troops, Hitler entrusted Himmler to the Army Group Vistula
 yah niyukti martin borman ke uksaane par hui ho sakati he, taaki pratidwandvi ko badnaam kiya ja sake, yaa phir sainya adhikariyon kii "vifaltaa" par hitler ke badhate gusse kii vajah se hui ho sakati he
 As commander-in-chief of the Army Group Vistula, Himmler established his command center at Schneidemühl
 ve apni vishesh train, sonderzug stearmark, ko apane mukhyalay ke rup main istemaal karte
 train main sirf ek telephone line hone or koi signal vilgan nahin hone ke baavjood himalar ne aisa kiya
 Eager to show his tenacity, Himmler quietly accepted the military officers' quick-attack urge
 oparation jald hi daldal main funs gaya or himalar ne ek niyamit army commander ko barkhaast kar diya or naji henge lammerding ko niyukt kiya
 His headquarters were also forced to retreat to Falconburg
 On 30 January, Himmler issued a brutal order: Todd und Straफेe für Flichtwergesensheit - "death and punishment for those who forget their obligations," to encourage their army
 bigadati sthiti ke kaaran himalar par hitler kaa dabaav badhata gaya; ve sammelnon main anishchayatmak or baichaiyn rahane lage
 Himmler's forces launched Pomeranian aggression in mid-february, under the direction of General Walther Venk, under the tremendous pressure of General Heinz Guderian on Hitler
 march ke aarambh tak, himalar kaa mukhyalay odher nadi ke pashchim le jaaya gaya, haalanki unki sena kaa naam ab bhi vistula ke naam par hi rahaa
 In conferences with Hitler, he continued to support Hitler's policy of increasing the tighter with those who retreated
 13 march ko, himalar ne apane cmand ko chhod diya, ve beemaari kaa daawa karne lage or hohenlichen ke ek aspataal main bhartee ho gayi
 Guderian met him there and took his resignation from the commander-in-chief of the Army Group Vistula and handed it over to Hitler that same night
 20 march ko, himalar ke sthaan par gotthard henriki ko general banaaya gaya
 In the winter of 1944–45, Himmler's waffen-ss had a membership number of 910,000, as well as about two million members of the allgomen-ss
 haalanki, 1945 kii shuruyaat main german jeet par se himalar kaa vishwaas uth gaya, khaskar apane maalisia felics karston or walter shelenberg ke saath baatcheet se
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki agar naji shashan ko bachaana he to iske liye britain or sanyukt rajya america ke saath shanti vaarta jaruri he
 He also believed that Hitler made himself helpless by staying in Berlin to personally defend the capital against the Soviet Union
 isliye unhone danish seemaa ke paas lubek main sweden ke count pholk barnadot se sampark kiya
 He introduced himself as the immediate leader of Germany and told Bernadotte that Hitler would almost certainly die within two days
 unhone barnadot kaha ki ve general dwit ijanhaavar se kahen ki germany pashchim ke saamne aatmasamarpan karnaa chahta he
 Himmler hoped that the British and Americans would fight the Soviet Union along with the remaining Wehrmacht
 barnadot ke anurodh par, himalar ne apana prastaav likhakar diya
 On the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempts to negotiate with the Western Allies
 jab hitler ko is samachar ke bare main bataaya gaya to vah gusse se agbabula ho gayi
 a few days ago, Herman Göring sought permission from Hitler to take the lead of the Reich - Hitler's provocation was interpreted as if he was being threatened by a chair or a coup
 haalanki, himalar ne anumati ke liye anurodh karne kii bhi parvaah nahin kii
 Hitler was also severely shocked by this news because he considered Himmler to be his second greatest loyalist after Joseph Goebbels; In fact, Hitler often called Himmler "der true Heinrich"
 shant ho jane ke baad hitler ne apane saath bunker main tab bhi maujuud logon se kaha ki unki jaankaree main himalar kaa yah krity vishwasghaat kaa sabase kharaab udhaaharan he
 In addition to Himmler's betrayal, the news that the Soviet army was only 300 meters from the Chancellory forced Hitler to write his last will and testament
 aatmahatya karne se pehle ke din puraa kar liye vasietname main unhone himalar or goring ko gaddaar ghoshit kiya
 He removed Himmler from all his party and government positions: he was removed from the posts of the reichführer-ss, the chief of the German police, the commissioner of the German Nationhood, the interior minister of the Reich, the Supreme Commander of the Volksström, and the Supreme Commander of the Home Army
 ant main, unhone himalar ko naji party se nishkasit karte hue unki giraftaar kaa aadesh diya
 Himmler's negotiations with Count Bernadotte failed
 iske baad unhone grand admiral karl donitz kii sharan lee, ve tab pion ke paas pashchimi morche par uttari hisse ke sabhi german sena kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Donitz returned Himmler, saying that he had no place in the new German government
 haalanki, baatcheet se baaqi bache yatnaa shiviron se koi 15,000 scandavian kaidiyon kii rihaai sambhav ho paayi
 After this Himmler approached the Americans like a defection, by contacting the headquarters of Eisenhower, claiming to surrender to the Allies of Germany, and conditioned them to be spared
 He asked Eisenhower to make him "police minister" of the Germany government post-war
 He reportedly began to ponder on how he would hold the first meeting with the commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Force and salute him or shake hands with him
 ailanhavar ne himalar se kisi prakaar ke samjhaute se inkaar kar diya or saath hi unhen ek bada yuddh apradhi ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Undaunted by his former allies and the search by the Allies, Himmler wandered around Flenberg near the Danish border for several days
 giraftaar se bachane ke liye, unhone khufia sainya police ke sargent-major kaa vesh dhaaran kiya, apana naam henrikh hitjinger rakhaa, apni moonch kaat lee or apni baayin aankh par ek pattee laga lee, is ummid main ki ve bavaria waapas ja paayenge
 unhone apane liye jaali dastavejon kaa puraa ek set bana rakhaa tha, lekin kisiike paas ke kagajaat itane kram se hone ko asaamaanya samajha gaya or bramen sthit british army unit ko shaq hua
 On 22 May, Major Sydney Axel was arrested and detained soon after
 anya german netaaon ke saath himalar par bhi ek yuddh apradhi kii haisiyat se neuramberg main mukadmaa chalaaya janaa tha, lekin 23 may ko poochtacha shuru hone se pehle hi potashium cynaid capsule khaakar unhone luneburg main aatmahatya kar lee
 His last words were Ich bin Heinrich Himmler! 
 Another statement is that when a British doctor was searching, Himmler had chewed the cyanide pill hidden in his teeth, upon which the doctor shouted, "it has done its job!" Several attempts to rescue Himmler failed
 sheeghra hi baad main, luneburg hith main ek achihnit kabr main himalar kaa shav dafna diya gaya
 The exact location of Himmler's tomb is unknown
 may 2008 ko, ek british police jaanch ne "29 jaalsajiyon kii pahchaan kii jo 2000 ke baad 12 filon main gum thi", jinka istemaal haal main himalar ke shadyantron or anumaanon ko sabit karne main kiya gaya
 The Financial Times report further states "fraudsters are cited as sources by a historian who wrote three books on World War II
" lekhak martin alan kaa vyapak rup se sansanikhej aarope lagane kaa itihaas he, jo anya ullekhneey naajiyon par likhte samay managasaint saamagree par nirbhar rahe hai
 "when he was challenged about a letter from the Duke of Windsor to Hitler, Ellen replied that it was given to his late father by Albert Spear, which was later found in the writer's attic
 itihaaskaar himalar ko sanchalit karanevaale manovigyaan, iraadon or prabhaavon ke bare main vibhajit hai

 jabaki anya logon kaa maananaa he ki himalar satalobhi the, jo apni shakti or prabhaav badhaane main jute rahe
 According to Robert S
 Wistrick, Himmler's decisive innovation was that he transformed a racial-like question from "a negative view based on anti-semitism" to "an organizational task for the creation of the SS"

 The wartime cartoonist Victor Weisz depicts Himmler as a giant octopus, holding the afflicted nations in its eight arms
 california vishvavidhyalay, barkali ke itihaaskaar volfgang souer ne mahasoos kiya ki "haalanki ve panditau, kattar or sust kism ke the, phir bhi asli satta main himalar hitler ke baad duusare number par ja pahunche

" Himmler told his personal masseur Felix Kirsten that he always kept a copy of the Bhagavad-gītā with him, so that it would not give him a sense of sin in implementing the final solution; They felt that they were only doing their duty like the warrior Arjuna, without having any attachment to their actions
 himalar ke vichaar sambhawatah gita kii apni vyakhya se vyutpann jacob vihelm hauer ke vichaaron se prabhavit thi
 In an excerpt from Norman Brooke's book War Cabinet Diaries, Winston Churchill advised Himmler to assassinate him during the war, given his wide share in the war
 brooke ke anusaar, naji netaaon ko prandand die jane kii ek salaah kii pratikriya main, "churchill ne poocha ki kya unhen himalar se baaten kerani chahie or baad main unhen dhakka maar diya jaay, ek baar shanti sharten puri ho jane ke baad

 'aisa karne kaa puraa hakdaar he', baithak kii likhit vivarani main kii tippanee darj he
" The main issue of a recent work is that for which he kept competing and to what extent Himmler went to grab Hitler's attention and get respect
 yuddh ke antim dinon kii ghatnaayen, jab unhone hitler ko chhod diya or mitra rashtron ke saath alag se vaarta shuru kii, is sambandh main spashtatah mahatvapurn hai
 Himmler seems to have had a distorted view of how they are viewed by the Allies; He hoped that he would meet American and British leaders and talk with them "like a gentleman"
 antim kshanon main apane viruddh unke pratishodh kii bhaavana ko samaapt karne kii cheshtaa main unhone yahudiyon or mahatvapurn kaidiyon ke dand sthagit rakhe
 unhen giraftaar karne vaale british sainikon ke anusaar, himalar is baat par sahi myne main hairaan the ki unke saath kaidiyon jaisaa vyavhaar kiya jaayegaa
 In 2008, Himmler was dubbed "the greatest massacre of all time" by the German news magazine Der Spiegel, reflecting his role as the architect of the demolition
 jabaki aadhunik germany main unki satat saarvajanik abhigyata pratibimbit ho rahi he, lekin demosida par sankhyikeey shodh darshaate hai ki ye daawey bahut hi adhik atiranjak hai, yahaan tak ki jab unki nijee jimmevary ko hitler or unke anya sahaayakon ke saath samuhik rup se mana jaataa he

 Award eses ke pramukh ke rup main, himalar main ansi adwitiya kshamta thi ki ve anek naji sena, naagarik or raajnneetik padakon se "khud ko puraskrit" karne kii sthiti main the
 However, Himmler's official awards and accolades qualified him primarily for service medals and merit cats, apparently under the scheme
 kai sheersh naji netaaon kii tarah himalar khud ke liye bhavy puraskaar or alankaranon kii zarurat mahasoos nahin karte the, balki in oopaadhiyon ko andolan ke kanishtha sadasyon ke liye bachaakar rakhte, jo aise puraskaron ko ek prerana ke rup main dekha karte the
 For this purpose, Himmler was not awarded the Iron Cross and even the War Merit Cross, while he was almost certain to be awarded for his work as SS and Chief of Police
 himalar ke adhikrut alankaar nimnlikhit hai: Himmler also received many foreign awards from friends of Germany, the most notable among them being the high ranking honors given to Himmler from Romania and Italy
 Himmler was decorated with several German state adornments, the most important being the honors he received from Bavaria, where he had previously served as police chief

 The Hijrah or Hijrat Hazrat Muhammad, with his followers, migrated from the city Mecca to the city Medina, whose old name was Yasrib, in 622 AD
 In June 622 i main, shahar makka main hazarat mohammad ko pataa chalaa ki unki hatya kaa prayaas kiya jaarha he, is sandarbh main, shahar makka chhod kar yasrib pravaas kiye
 He was accompanied by his friend and Sahabi Abu Bakr
 yasrib ko 'madinat-an-nabi' kaa naam diya gaya
 That is, the city of pressure
 baad main an-nabi bolnaa kam hogaya, sirf madina kahalaane laga
 Medina means "city"
 hijri or hijrah main antar he, aksar yah donon shabdon ko lekar ek hi shabd samaj jate ham, jab ki aisa nahin he, donon alag alag shabd hai
 If Hijri is an Islamic calendar, then Hijrat Muhammad is to travel to Medina
 musalamaanon kaa pehla pravaas 615 yaa rajab 613 ko hazarat mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon se kaha ki makka ke log musalamaanon ko sataane lage hai, makka main din dubhar hogaye hai, is liye ithiopia ke negus jo isai dharm kaa maanane vaala sachcha isai he, vah akeshwaropeskon kii qadra karata he, vahaan chale jaayen
 Then the followers went to Abyssinia
 laqin makka vaale ithiopia ke badshaah ke paas jaakar musalamaanon ko unke hawaale karne ko kaha
 But the king did not agree, and allowed the Muslims to stay there
 nagar makka tha, 620 i tirthayatra kaa mausam tha, madina se aaye "banu khazraj" ke chh logon se mulaaqaat kii, unhe islam ke bare main bataay or quran ke chand aayaat padh kar sunaaya in baton se khush hokar unhone islam qabool kiya
 And in 621 AD, five of them brought seven people with them
 yah baarah ne hazarat mohammad ko bataaya ki shahar madina main islam fail rahaa he, or pratigya kii ki vah mohammad ko preshit maanate hai, tohid par vishwaas laate he, or buraaiyaan jaise chori, vyabhichaar or qatl se dur rahenge
 This antiquity is called "the first antidote of the Akba"
 in kii darkhwaast par hazrat mohammad ne "musaab ebn umair" ko madina bheja ki madeene waalon ko islam kaa paath padhaayen
 People came under the umbrella of Islam in Medina
 agali saal 622 i ke tirthayatra main, madina se banu aas or khajaraj jaati ke 75 musalmaan makka aae or hazrat mohammad ko apana saath diya, or madina aane par sampooran sahyog kaa aashwaasan diya
 He also invited an invitation to come as a messenger to remove conflicts between various castes of Madina
 is ko al-abibah kaa ahad kehete hai yah ek raajnneeti va dharmik kaamiyabi thi jo nabi ko or unke anuyaayiyon ko madina hizrat karne kaa mauka mila

 The most important musical scales are usually written using eight notes, and the interval between the first and last notes is one octave
 For example, the c major scale is usually written CDEFGABC, with the initial and final CS being a different octave
 The two notes have an octave separated by the same letter name and are the same pitch square
 antaraal ke bich pehle or duusare harmonics ke hormonic shrinkhalaa he ek saptak
 Octave is sometimes referred to as a scale
 karne ke liye jor he ki yah ek sahi antaraal, saptak he nirdisht P8

 For example, if a note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note is above one octave at 880 Hz, and the note has an octave below it at 220 Hz
 The two notes of the frequencies of the ratios are a different octave hence 2: 1
 aage octaves ke ek note par hote hai 2en baar kii aavriti he ki dhyaan den, is tarah ke rup main 2, 4, 8, 16, aadi
 or us ke parsparik shrinkhalaa he 
 For example, 55 Hz and 440 Hz are one and two octaves away from 110 Hz because they are: 1 / 2 and 4 times the frequency, respectively
 saptak range = log ucch aavriti kam aavriti ]play sahaayta·soochna]]ke baad ek sur, saptak saralatam antaraal main sangeet he 
 The same goes for the human ear, being heard as both notes being essentially "," adding an octave "ring" separated by closely related harmonics notes for the same reason, making a soothing sound Music for For this reason, the notes are also given an octave
 There is also a note of the name of the musical notation of the Western system of the same name, a single octave above a single A
 It is called the octave equivalence, the assumption that the pitches are One or more octaves are distinct musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention that "scales are uniquely defined by an octave within the specified interval
" As being a pitch, two dimensions, pitch height and pitch, are inherently octave circles
 is prakaar sabhi c ♯es, yaa sabhi 1s, kisi bhi saptak kaa hissaa he, ek hi pich varg 
 a part of the equivalence of octave, in most "advanced musical cultures", but far from universal is "primitive" and early music
 The language which is tuned to the oldest existing written documents is written, Sumerian and Akkadi, "octave" for no known word
 However, it is believed that a set of spherical tablets that collectively describe the nine-stringed instrument of tuning, a Babylonian litter, tunings for the seven strings, the remaining two strings tuned to the seven octaves of the tunneleon Crickmore Hall In itself it is proposed that "the octave may not be thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day supply
