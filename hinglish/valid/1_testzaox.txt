 madhwacharya, madhavacharya vidyaarany se bhinn hai
 Madhvacharya was one of the most important philosophers of the time of the Bhakti movement in India
 ve purnaprajna va aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the originator of elementalism which is known as dualism
 dwaitvaad, veydant kii teen pramukh darshanon main ek he
 Madhvacharya is considered the third incarnation of Vayu
 madhwacharya kai arthon main apane samay ke agradoot the, ve kai baar prachlit ritiyon ke viruddh chale gayi hai
 He presented the dvaita philosophy
 inhone dwait darshan ke brahmasutra par bhashya likhaa or apane vedant ke vyaakhyaan kii taarkik pushti ke liye ek swatantra granth 'anuvyaakhyaan' bhi likhaa
 Commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, the treatise on the Mahabharathataparyanryanay and the Shrimad Bhagwatpuran are his other treatises, explaining the meaning of the Mahabharata

 parantu ye granth acharya ke prati lekhak ke shraddhalu hone ke kaaran atiranjana, chamatkaar or avishwasaneey ghatnaon se purna hai
 Therefore, on the basis of these, no precise details can be presented regarding Madhavacharya's life
 shri madhwacharya ne prasthaantrayee granthon se apane dwaitvaad siddhant kaa vikaas kiya
 It is also called 'sadvaishnav', because it is different from Sri Ramanujacharya's Sri Vaishnavism
 shri madhwacharya ne `'panch bhed' kaa adhyayan kiya jo `atyant bhed darshanam ́ bhi kaha jaataa he
 He has five characteristics: `atyant bhed darshanam ́ kaa vargeekaran padaarth rup main is prakaar bhi kiya gaya he : An independent is one who is completely independent
 jo bhagwaan yaa sanathan satya he
 But Jeevatma and Jagat are dependent on God
 isaliye bhagwaan unka niyantran karte hai
 God is independent
 isliye unka vargeekaran asambhav he
 Dependent elements are divided into positive and negative forms
 sakaaratmak ko bhi chetan or achetan main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Before defining the unconscious element, Madhvacharya talks about the independent and dependent who are eternally free from the world
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar `vishnu` swatantra hai jo viveki or sansar ke niyanta hai
 Her Shakti is Lakshmi who is eternally free
 kai vyuhon evam avtaron ke roopon main ham vishnu ko paa sakate hai 
 Similarly, the very dependent Lakshmi is also the power of Vishnu and can take many forms only for the physical body
 vah dukh-dard se pare hai
 His sons are Brahma and Vayu
 `prakruti ́ shabd pra = pare + kriti = sristi kaa sangam he
 Madhvacharya considered creation and Brahma separate
 unke anusaar vishnu bhautik sansar ke kaaran karta hai
 God empowers nature by Lakshmi and transforms her into a visible world
 prakruti bhautik vastu, sharir evam angon kaa bhautik kaaran he
 Three powers emerge from the three aspects of nature: Lakshmi, Bhu and Durga
 avidya bhi prakruti kaa hi ek rup he jo paramatma ko jeevatma se chhipaati he
 Madhvacharya ji believes that the earth made of nature is not Maya, but is a separate truth from God
 yah doodh main chhipi dahi ke samaan parivartan nahin he, na hi paramatma kaa rup he
 Therefore, it is special dualism

 pichley karmo ke anusaar jeevatma ksht jhelte hai, jisase unki aatma pavitra ho jaati he or jivan-maran se mukt hokar anand kaa anubhav karti hai jo aatma kii sahajata he
 The soul is different in enjoyment

 On the path of devotion, the soul attains salvation by the grace of God

 He is a product of the British writer and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
 landan kaa ek pratibhavan 'paramarshdaata jasoos ", homes apni bauddhik kushalta ke liye mashhoor he or mushkil maamalon ko sulajhane ke liye apane chatur avlokan, anumiti tark or nishkarsh ke kushal upyog ke liye prasiddh he
 Conan Doyle has written four novels and fifty-six short stories depicting Holmes
 pehali do kathaayen kramshah 1887 main bitans christmas enual main or 1890 main lipinocots manthali megsine main ain
 1891 main da strand megsine main choti kahaniyon kii pehali shrinkhalaa kii shuruuaat ke saath hi charitra kii lokapriyata main atyadhik vruddhi hui
 Later a series of short stories and two serial novels were published till 1927
 The stories cover the period from about 1875 to 1914, with the last case being 1914
 chaar kahaniyon ko chhodkar baaki sabhi kahaniyaan homes ke dost or jeevani lekhak dow jon ech
 watasan dwaara sunai gai hai, do kahaniyaan khud homes dwaara sunai gayi hai or do anya tisare vyakti dwaara
 In two stories, Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memory, while Watson Frame narrates the story
 conan doyal ne kaha ki homes kaa charitra dow joseph bel se prerit tha, jinke liye doyal ne ek lipic ke rup main edinburgh royal infrmari main kaam kiya tha
 Like Holmes, Bell was known to draw large conclusions from small observations
 maaikel harrison ne 1971 ke ek lekh elleri queens mistry magazine main tark diya he ki yah charitra, vendale sherer se prerit tha jo ek hatya ke maamle main ek "paraamarsh jasoos" the jo kathith rup se england main 1882 main akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main chaaya rahaa
 Outside of the adventures recorded by Dr
 Watson, little is known about the biography of Sherlock Holmes and not even in the original stories of Conan Doyle; Nevertheless, relevant information about his early life and detailed family form an outline of this detective's life
 kahani hiz last bo main homes kaa janm andazan 1854 ke aas-paas lagata he; aam taur par, tarikh ko 6 janvari ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Holmes says that when he was in the pre-graduation class, he first developed the permissions method
 Author Dorothy L
 Shares suggested that according to the information of the two exploits, Holmes would have been in Cambridge rather than Oxford and that "of all the colleges in Cambridge, Sydney Sussex probably offered the most benefits to someone with a Holmes-like situation and more accurate information
" In the default, we can tentatively place it there
 uske praarambhik maamle, jinhen usne ek shaukia ke taur par anjaam diya, uske vishvavidhyalay ke saathi chaatro ke madhyam se aae the
 According to Holmes, a visit to the father of one of his classmates prompted him to take up espionage as a profession and he spent six years as a consulting detective after university work, until financial difficulties led him to Watson Not forced to take it as his room mate, at which point the narration of the stories begins
 1881 se, varnan he ki 221B baker street, landan, homes kaa thikaana tha jahaan se vah apni nijee jasusi agency chalaata he
 221B seventeen steps up is a flat which in an old manuscript has been called the "upper end" of the road
 dow watasan ke aane tak, homes akele kaam karata tha, kabhi-kabhaar hi shahar ke chote tabake se agenton ko niojit karata tha, jisamen dher saare mubir or bazaaru bacchon kaa ek samooh tha jise vah baker street irregulars kahata tha
 Irregulators appear in three stories, "the Sign of the Four", "A Study in Scarlet" and "the Adventure of the Crooked Man"
 homes ke parivaar kaa thodaa hi varnan kiya gaya he
 The stories do not mention his parents and he merely states that his ancestors were "rural chieftains"
 "da adventure of da greek interprator" main homes daawa karte hai ki uske mahaan-chachaa francisi kalakaar vernett the
 He has an older brother, Mycroft, a government official, who appears in three stories; He is mentioned in many other stories
 smaranshakti yukt vyakti yaa sarkaar kii nitiyon ke sabhi pahaluon ke chalate-phirte database ke rup main microft kaa prashasnic seva main ek anoothaa pad he
 It has been reported that Mycroft has far more capacity than Sherlock in terms of observation and permissions
 haalanki, usamen sherl vaali urja or junun kii kami he or jo bade aaraam se apana samay diogenus club main bitaana pasand karata he, jise "landan ke sabase zyaada gaiyr-milansaar logon kaa ek club" kaha gaya he
 It is not clear whether Holmes has other siblings
 "da adventure of da copper biches" main homes kahata he,"main kabool karata hum ki yah, vah paristhiti nahin he jisamen main apni bahan ko dekhnaa chaahunga", jisase kuch logon ko unke astitv kaa andeshaa hota he
 But in such a case, he asks a woman to warn him as his sister, so it can only be a figurative language
 homes apana adhikansh vyavsaayik samay apane achche mitra or kalkram se abhilekhan karanevaale watasan ke saath saajha karte hai, jo 1887 main apni shaadi hone se pehle or apni patni kii mrityu hone ke baad punah kuch samay ke liye homes ke saath rahata he; uskaa ghar, uski makaan malkin, shrimati hadsan sambhalati hai
 Watson has two roles in Holmes's life
 pehali, vah uske maamalon ke sanchaalan main vyaavhaarik sahaayta detaa he; vah jasoos kaa dahinaa haath he, jo khoji, jhansa dene vaala, sahyogi or doot ke vibhinn roopon main kaary karata he
 Second, he is a historian of Holmes
 Most of Holmes's stories are phenomenological narratives, written from Watson's point of view as a summary of the detective's most interesting cases
 homes ko aksar watasan ke lekhan ko sansanikhez or loklubhaavan kehete hue ullikhit kiya gaya he, yah sujhaate hue ki lekh uski kala ke shuddh gananaa "vigyaan" kii nishpaksh or sateek report pesh nahin karte
 Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is undoubtedly his most important relationship
 kai kahaniyon main, watasan ke liye homes kaa sneh- aksar uske thande, bauddhik bahya swarup ke peeche chipa hua- ujagar ho jaataa he
 "in The Adventure of the Three Garidebs, Watson is injured in a confrontation with a villain; although the bullet wound proves to be" very superficial ", Watson is elated by Holmes' response: kul milakar, homes ke taees saal sakriy rup se kaary karte rahane kaa varnan he jis dauraan watasan ne uske satraa maamalon ko lipibaddh kiya
 Holmes retires in 1903-04 to a Bee Farm in Sussex Downs where he takes the hobby of beekeeping as his primary occupation and eventually "practical Hand Book of Bee Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen "
 keval ek maamla, jo homes dwaara swayan varnit he or jisaki vah ek shaukia taur par chaan-been kar rahaa tha, jasoos kii sevanivritti ke dauraan ghatit hota he
 Holmes describes himself as "faked" in terms of habits and lifestyle
 watasan ke anusaar, homes ek sanakee he, jise saafe-safaai yaa suvyavastha ke samakaleen maanakon se koi lagaav nahin he
 In an early story, Watson describes Holmes as: jo chiz dusron ko avyavashtha-si lagati he, vah homes ko upyogi jaankariyon kaa bhandar dikhti he
 Holmes in the stories dips into his shattered web of random documents and artifacts to find exactly the specific document or anything he is looking for
 vyaktigat swatchta ke maamle main, virodhabhas swaroop, homes ko "da hound of da baskeravilles" main vyaktigat safai se ek "billi-jaisaa" pyaar karne vaala varnit kiya he
 In no way does this seem to impede the very practical pursuit of his profession, however; Holmes's first story, "A Study in Scarlet," has his hands dirty with acid stains, while Holmes later uses his own blood drops for chemical experimentation
 watasan aksar homes ke khaane kii anishchit aadaton ko chihnit karata he
 Detective is often described as starving himself during times of intense intellectual activity, as during The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, where Watson states: homes kaa itihaaskaar uske pipe upyog karne kii aadat, yaa uske cigarette or cigar, ke apekshaakrit kam prayog ko bura nahin maanata
or na hi watasan, homes dwaara ek muvakkil ke liye sach modane yaa kanoon todane kii tatparta kii ninda karata he jahaan uskaa maananaa he ki yah naitik rup se uchit he
 Holmes is depicted as a patriot, who in many stories is working on behalf of the government in matters of national security
 vah hiz last bo main counter-intelligence kaa kaary bhi karata he jo WWI kii shuruuaat main avasthit he
 As a shooting exercise, the detective has decorated the wall of his Baker Street hideout with a "VR" mark made from his pistol bullets
 homes kaa abhimaan yada-kada ghamand kaa rup le letaa he; yadhyapi auchity ke saath; vah police nirikshakon ko apane utkrisht nishkarshon se uljhaakar anand praapt karata he
 He does not aspire to fame and is generally satisfied by allowing the police to take public credit for his work
 yah aksar hi hota he ki jab watasan apni kahaniyon ko prakashit karata he, to maamle main homes kii bhoomika spasht ho jaati he
 Holmes's conduct is rendered neutral and cold
 phir bhi ek saahasik kaary ke bich, ullekhneey junun ke saath, homes chamak dikhaa saktaa he
 He has a tendency to perform and has a wide net to catch a criminal and unleash his crime, often to impress Watson or one of the Scotland Yard inspectors
 homes kabhi-kabhi nashili dawaaon kaa upyog karata he, khaas kar jab uttejk maamalon kii kami rahati he
 He is addicted to cocaine, which is pierced by the use of a special needle in a seven percent solution that he holds in a leather shell
 homes opium kaa bhi yada-kada upyog karata he, lekin ek opium adde par jane kii baat par usne ghor asweekruti vyakt kii
 All three were justified in England in the late 19th century
 homes dwaara nashili dawaaon ke prayog se koi chikitsakeey aapatti naa dikhaakar, dow watasan, victorian chikitsa kattarpanthi ko darshaate he
 Naively, he denounces his friend's habit, describing it as "the only evil" of the detective, and expressing concern about Holmes' mental health and its potential impact on excellent intelligence
 baad kii kathaon main, watasan homes ko drugs se dur karne kaa daawa karte hai
 Nevertheless, according to his medical friend, Holmes remains an addict whose habit was "not dead, but sleeping only
" " Although he initially needs Watson to share the rent of his comfortable residence at 221B Baker Street, in "the Adventure of the Dying Detective", Watson reveals, "I have no doubt when Holmes lived alone" That the house would probably have been bought at the price that Holmes pays for his room, "pointing out that he generated a good income from his behavior, though it was properly He did not know how much he charged for his services
 vah "da problem of thor brij" main yah zarur kahata he ki "meraa peshewar shulk ek nishchit str par he
 i don't change them, only when i forgive them completely 


 " yah ek aise sandarbh main kaha gaya he jab ek graahak ne usko uski fees kaa duguna dene kii peshkash kii; lekin, yah sambhav he ki dhani graahak homes ko uske maanak shulk se kaafii zyaada paarishramik pradaan karte hai: "da adventure of da final problem" main homes kahata he ki france kii sarkaar or scandenevia ke shahi nivas ne uski sevaaon ke liye use paryaapt dhan diya he jisase vah aaraam se ritair ho saktaa he, jabaki "da adventure of blike peter" main watasan ne ingit kiya he ki homes, amir or taqatvar logon kii madad se inkaar kar detaa tha yadi usko unka maamla pasand nahin aata, jabaki atyadhik vinamr graahakon ke maamalon ke liye vah puure saptaah kaa samay samarpit kar detaa tha
 In "A Case of Identity", Holmes also tells Watson that after "A Scandal in Bohemia", the King of Bohemia gave him a golden snuff box and received a magnificent ring from the Dutch royal family; In "the Adventure of the Bruce - Partington Plans", Holmes receives an emerald tie-pin from Queen Victoria
 homes ke maamalon ke anya smriti chihn hai ireni edler se praapt sone kii ginni or france ke raashtrapati kaa ek hastakshrit dhanyavad patr or huret naam ke ek hatyare ko pakadvane ke liye lejan of honor da adventure of da golden pins-nez "da adventure of da priari skool" main homes ullas ke saath apana haath malataa he" jab holdernes kaa duk raashi ko likhata he, jisase watasan ko bhi aashcharya hota he or uske baad check ko thapki detaa he, yah kah kar ki "main ek garib aadmi hum," ek ghatana jise homes kii vidambnaapurna hasya kii pravriti ke rup main kaarij kiya ja saktaa he
 Certainly, during his career, Holmes worked for both the most powerful kings and governments of Europe and various wealthy nobles and industrialists and was also approached for advice by poor moneylenders and humble teachers of the lower ranks of society
 apane kharchon ke liye homes, graahakon se paise vasuulata he or samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye prastaavit kisi bhi inaam kaa daawa kar saktaa he: vah "da adventure of da specold band" main kahata he ki miss stoner uske dwaara kiye gaye kharche ko de saktin hai or anurodh karata he ki "da red-heded lig" bank, uske dwaara maamle par kiye gaye kharche kii bharpai kare
 "da adventure of da beril coronet main chori hue ratna ko punah praapt karne main ai laagat kaa bhugtan karne ke liye homes ke paas uskaa amir banker graahak he or vah us inam par bhi daawa karata he jo us banker ne khojane vaale ke liye ghoshit kiya tha
 The only woman to influence Holmes was Irene Adler, who was always referred to by Holmes as "the woman"
 homes ko khud is shabd kaa sidhe prayog karte hue uddhrut nahin kiya gaya he- bhale hi vah anya maamalon main uskaa asli naam kai baar letaa he
 Adler is one of the few women cited in all of Holmes's stories, although she actually appears in only one story, "A Scandal in Bohemia
" ek kahani main, "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" shaadi ke liye homes kii mangani ho jaati he, lekin keval apane maamle ke liye jaankaree jutaney kii ichha se
vah raste main aane vaali bahut adhik aakarshak mahila graahakon ke prati spasht ruchi darshata he, 
 homes ne anivaary rup se "apane graahak main aage koi ruchi nahin dikhaai jab vah uski ek samasya ke centre se baahar chali gai
 "holmes found his youth, beauty and energy distinct from any romantic interest, appealing
 aise prakaran homes ke aakarshan ko darshaate hai, abhi tak edler ke maamle ke alaava, kisi gambhir yaa dirghakaalik lagaav kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Watson wrote that Holmes "hates women" but "has a bizarre way of finding favor", with Holmes saying, "I am not a fan of the feminine heart"; In fact, he finds "the intention of women 


 so cryptic 


 how can you build on such a deceptive object? Their smallest action can cost a lot
" 

 unka sabase asaadhaaran vyavhaar baalo ke ek pin par nirbhar kar saktaa he
 "however, Doyle recalled Joseph Bell saying," Holmes Babbage is just as inhuman as the calculating machine and with all the possibility of falling in love
 " Another interesting aspect of Holmes's relationship with women is that the source of the pleasure he gets from his company is the problems he brings
 sin of da four main, watasan ne homes ko "ek yantra maanav, ek gananaa mashin," ke rup main uddhrut kiya he or homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he,"yah sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ki apane faisle ko vyaktigat gunon dwaara purvaagrahagrast hone kii anumati nahin deni chahie
ek graahak mere liye maatr ek ikai he, - samasya main ek kaarak

 i can assure you that the woman i found the most attractive to date was hanged for poisoning three young children for insurance money
 

" yah saamaanya rup se mahilaon ke saath or vishesh rup se muvakkil ke saath homes kii sambandh banane main anichhaa ko sanderbhit karata he, jaisaa ki watasan ne kaha "kabhi-kabhi tumhaare andar ek sakaaratmak amanviyata dikhti he
 At the end of "the Adventure of the Devil's Foot," Holmes says: "I have never loved Watson, but if i did, and if the woman i loved had an end, i might have been one of my willing lions Behaves like a hunter
 "in the story, investigator Dr
 Sterndale kills the man who killed his girlfriend, Brenda Tragenis, in order to exact an exact revenge that the law could not provide
 La
 "in The Adventure of the Dying Detective, Watson writes that Mrs
 Hudson likes Holmes in her own way, despite her cynical eccentricity as a tenant, due to her remarkably gentle and courteous behavior with women
" In The Sign of the Four, Watson once again quotes Holmes as saying, "I won't tell them too much
" Never trust women completely, homes kii praathmik bauddhik tahakikat vidhi he ek aparaadh ke samaadhaan kaa anumiti tark "pani kii ek boond se", vah likhata he, "ek taarkik vyakti atlantic yaa niagara kii sambhaavna kaa anumaan laga saktaa he bina ek ko dekhe yaa duusare ko sune
"homes kii kahaniyaan aksar uski "anumiti" kii sahaspurn pratibha ke pradarshan ke saath shuru hoti hai
 It is of little interest to logicians and those interested in logic to try to analyze what Holmes is doing during his permissions
 prathit hota he ki homiya anumiti, nishkarsh nikaalane se nirmit he jo praathmik rup se yaa to sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton par aadhaarit he jo satark aagamanaatmak adhyayan kaa parinaam he jaise ki vibhinn prakaar ke cigar kii raakh kaa homes kaa adhyayan athwa sarvottam vivaran se prasphutit nishkarsh he
 The form of Holmes's straight-line pragmatics is generally, "if 'p', then 'q', where 'p' is the visible proof and 'q' is what the evidence indicates
 lekin vahaan madhyavarti siddhant bhi hai, jaisaa ki nimna udhaaharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 In "A Scandal in Bohemia" Holmes permits that Watson was very wet recently and that her "maid girl was very clumsy and careless"
 When surprised, Watson asks how Holmes knows this
 Holmes answers: is maamle main, homes ne kai jude siddhanton kaa prayog kiya: By explicitly applying such principles, Holmes is able to infer that: "watasan ke juute ke kinare, kai saamanantar kataav se chhile hue hai"; se "watasan kii naukaraani foohad or laaparvaah he"; or "watasan haal hi main bahut geela rahaa he or gande mausam main baahar gaya tha
 " anumiti tark homes ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se ek ajanabi ke vyavsaay kaa khulaasa karne main sakasham banaate hai, jaise ki a study in skarlet main marine ke ek sevanivrutt sargent; da red-heded lig main ek jahaaj kaa purv badhai jo mahajan ban gaya; or ek billiard-marker or da adventure of da greek interprator main ek topakhane kaa sevanivrutt NCO
 isi tarah, nirjeev vastuon kaa adhyayan karke, homes unke maalikon ke bare main ascharyajanak vistrut nishkarsh nikaalane main sakasham he, jisamen shaamil he da sin of da four main watasan kii jeb-ghadi or saath hi saath anya kahaniyon main ek topi, ek pipe, or ek chadi
 Once he has accumulated a lot of evidence and allowed possible interpretations and to present a solution, Holmes moves to one interpretation that matches all the facts of the case
 jaisaa ki homes watasan ko bataata he, "jab tumne asambhav ko hataa diya, to jo bhi bachaa, haalanki asambhavit, avashya sach hona chahie
" Holmes demonstrates a keen interest in acting and making pseudo-vests
 kai kahaniyon main, vah saboot ikattha karne ke liye itnaa swaabhaavik chhadam vesh dhaaran karata he ki watasan bhi use nahin pakad paata, jaisaa ki "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" main, da main wyeth da twisted lip or a scandle in bohemia main
anya karnaamon main, homes apane maamle ko prabhavi banane ke liye ghayal hone kaa yaa biimaar hone kaa bahaanaa karata he, yaa shaamil logon ko doshi tehraata he, jaise "da adventure of da daaing detective" main
 Pistol Holmes and Watson carry pistols with them; Often his old service revolver in Watson's case
 haalanki, watasan keval saat maukon par in hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii charchaa karata he
 'stick Holmes as a gentleman, often walking with a stick or stick
 watasan dwaara use lakdi kii talwaar main visheshgy varnit kiya gaya he or vah do baar apni chadi kaa upyog ek hathiyaar ke rup main karata he
 In Talwar a Study in Scarlett, Watson describes Holmes as an expert in swordsmanship — though in no story Holmes has used the sword
 "gloria scot" main isaki charchaa he ki homes ne talwaar kaa abhyaas kiya he
 Whip In many stories, Holmes appears armed with a whip
 da adventure of da specold band main iskaa prayog vah ek jahrile saanp ko maarane ke liye karata he or a cese of aaidentity main usase ek thag ko maarane ke liye kareeb aata he
 Holmes, using a "whip" in "the red-headed League", drops a pistol from John Clay's hands
 mukkebaazi homes nangi ungaliyon se ek vikat ladaaku ke rup main varnit he
 In The Sign of the Four, Holmes introduces himself to a professional boxer as: kahaniyon main kai avasaron par homes, ubharate hue apane pratidwandviyon ke saath guttham-guttha ladaai main uljhe, jahaan ve anivaary rup se vijeta rahe
 "gloria scot" main yah doharaaya gaya he ki homes ek mukkebaaz ke rup main prashikshit he
 In the martial arts The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes tells Watson how he overcame Professor Moriart by using martial arts and slamming his adversary on the Raishenbach Falls
 vah kahata he ki "haalanki, mujhe kuch gyaan he, baritsu, kaa yaa kushti kii japani pranali kaa, jo kai baar mere liye bahut upyogi sabit hui he
 The name "baritsu" appears to be a reference to real-life martial arts Bartitsu
 pehali hi kahani a study in skarlet main, homes kii prishthbhumi ke bare main kuch diya gaya he
 In the first half of 1881, he was introduced as an independent student of chemistry with many diverse inquisitive interests, almost all of which appeared to him to be better at solving crimes
 An early story, "the Adventure of the" Gloria Scott "", provides more background for who influenced Holmes to become a detective: The father of a college friend gave him a brownish appreciation of his permissiveness skills
 Holmes strictly follows the scientific method and emphasizes the power of arguments and observation and permissiveness
 a study in skarlet main, homes kaa daawa he vah nahin jaanata ki prithvi surya ke chaaron ore gumti he, chunki is tarah kii jaankaree uske kaam ke liye apraasangik he
 After hearing this fact directly from Watson, he says that he will immediately try to forget her
 He states that he believes that the brain has a limited capacity to store information and therefore learning redundant will only reduce its ability to learn useful things
 Dr
 Watson later assesses Holmes' ability to is: yahaan tak ki a study in skarlet ke ant main, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki homes latin jaanata he or mul roman sukhtiyon ke anuwaad kii koi jarurat nahin padati, haalanki jasusi kaary ke liye bhashaa ke gyaan kii pratyaksh upyogita ndehpurn he
 Later stories also refute the list
 homes kii raajnneeti se sambhavit agyanta ke baavjood "a scandle in bohemia" main vah tathakthith "count won kram" kii asli pahchaan ko turant bhaanp jaataa he
 In relation to non-sensational literature, his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, even Goethe
 iske alaava, da adventure of da bruce- partington plance main watasan suchit karata he ki navambar 1895 main, "homes khud ko ek vinibandh main dubaa letaa he jo usne poliphonic motets of lasus se liya tha"- ek atyadhik gudh kshetra, jiske liye homes ko apni smriti ko jaankaree ke ek vishaal bhandar se, jiskaa kii aparaadh kii ladaai se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, avyavasthit karnaa hoga- itnaa vyapak gyaan ki uske vinibandh ko is vishay par "antim alphaz" mana jaataa he
 Later narratives refute the notion that Holmes is unwilling to know anything unless it is immediately relevant to his occupation; In the second chapter of The Valley of Fear, Holmes would rather declare that "all knowledge is useful to the detective" and at the end of The Adventure of the Lions Men he calls himself "an all-in-one of memory with bizarre conception
" The subject reader defines as "
 " Holmes is also a competent code specialist
 vah watasan ko sambodhit karata he,"main kuta lekhan ke sabhi roopon se kaaphi parichit hum or is vishay par ek tuchh vinibandh kaa main khud lekhak hum, jisamen main ek sau saath alag sankethik shabdon kaa vishleshan kar rahaa hum
" aisi hi ek yojana aavriti vishleshan ke prayog se da adventure of da daancing main main hal hoti he
 Holmes's analysis of physical evidence is both scientific and accurate
 uske tareekon main shaamil he avyakt print kaa prayog jaise pairon ke nishaan or khur print or cycle patariyaan, ek aparaadh sthal par karrwai kii pahchaan karne ke liye, aparaadhiyon ko pahchaanane ke liye tambaakoo kii raakh or cigarette ke turron kaa prayog, ek dhokhadhadi kaa pardaafash karne ke liye tip patron kii tulana, do hatyaron ko benakaab karne ke liye barood avasheshon kaa prayog ", do aparaadh sthalon se praapt goli kii tulana or yahaan tak ki ungaliyon ke nishaan kaa shuruaati prayog 
 a scandle in bohemia main homes ne manovigyaan ke gyaan kaa bhi pradarshan kiya he, jahaan usne ireni edler ko tasviir chhipaane ke sambandh main dhokhaa dene ke liye phuslaaya, jo is "aadhaar" par tikaa tha ki aag lagane kii sthiti main ek avivaahit mahila apni sabase keemtee chiz chaahegi jabaki ek shaadishuda aurat apane bachche kii taraf jhapategi
pehali kahani, a study in skarlet main, homes puraane khun ke daag kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek rasinic prakriya kii khoj kaa daawa karata he- haalanki vibhinn prakaar ke rakt kai saal baad tak pahachaane nahin jate the
 Despite the excitement of his life, Holmes retires to beekeeping Sussex Downs and writes a book on the subject, "practical Hand Book of Be Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen
 His search for relaxation in his music
 Can also be seen in love, especially in The red-headed League, where Holmes, taking leave from the case one evening, heard the violin of Pablo de Saraste Is obtained

 Finally, dedergene and Gobbett review the literature on the psychology of specialization, taking Sherlock Holmes, a fictional expert as a model

 There are fifty-six short stories written by Conan Doyle and four novels called Law by Homian
 is kanoon ke praarambhik vidwaanon main britain ke ronaald nox or neuyork ke christopher morle shaamil hai
 As a tribute, more or less the authors have created many pop culture references from Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle, or the characters in the stories
 is tarah ke sanket ek kathanak ke vikaas kaa kaary karte hai, hisse ke bauddhik str ko badha sakate hai yaa ek chaukas darshak ke liye easter andey ke rup main vyavhaar kar sakate hai
 Some have been outspoken who presented Holmes as a character in a new setting, or a slightly more subtle hint, such as building a logical character while living in an apartment number 221B
 a well-known example of this is Gregory House's character in the House MD show, whose name and apartment number both refer to Holmes
 sabase aasaan sandarbh aksar yah hota he ki jo bhi kisi tarah kaa jasusi kaam karata he use shikari topi or clok kii poshak pahana dena
 pop samskruti ke sandarbh main ek or samrudh kshetra he homes kaa vansh or santaan, lekin vastav main lekhak kii kalpana keval seemaa he
 a third major reference is a quote, "this is easy, my dear Watson,"
 Another erroneous credit is generally given that Holmes is not explicitly described in the entire novel series, wearing a hunter hat
 " haalanki, homes ne ek kaan tak latakati yatra topi "da adventure of silver blez" main zarur pahani he
 Sidney Paget first depicted Holmes in The Hunters Hat and Inverness Cap in The Boscombe Valley Mystery and many other later stories
 homes ke prashansak 1891 se 1894 tak kii avadhi ko- "da adventure of da final problem main homes ke gaayab hone or sambhavit maut or phir "da adventure da adventure of da empti house" main punah prakat hone ke bich kaa samay- "mahaan antaraal" ke rup main ullikhit karte hai
 It is notable, however, that a later narration of a story in 1892 is described
 conan doyal ne kahaniyon kaa pehla set ek dashak ke dauraan likhaa
apane aitihaasik upanyaason ke liye or adhik samay dene kii ichha se unhone "da final problem" main homes ko maar daalaa, jo 1893 main prakashit hui
aath saal janata ke dabaav kaa saamana karne ke baad, lekhak ne da hound of da baskeravilles likhaa, jo 1901 main prakashit hua, aspasht rup se ise homes kii "mrityu" se pehle sthapit kiya 
 haalanki janata kahani se prasann hui, lekin ek maranoparant homes se vah santusht nahin thi or isliye conan doyal ne do saal baad homes ko punerjeevit kiya
 Many considered Doyle's intention to bring Holmes alive, most notably writer-director Nicholas Meyer, who wrote an essay on the subject titled "the Great Man Takes a Speech" in the 1970s
 The real reason is not known
 Are, apart from the obvious: publishers offered to pay generously
 Whatever the reason, Conan Doyle continued to write Holmes stories for a quarter century
 kuch lekhakon ne antaraal ke liye anya spashtikaran die hai
 In Meyer's novel The seven-per-saint Solution, the interval is shown as a secret sabbatical when Holmes treats Sigmund Freud's cocaine addiction and presents Holmes with the pleasing suggestion that Watson do it

 Acharya Keshavdas was born in 1546 AD in Orchha

 His father's name was Pt Kashinath
 orchha ke rajdurbar main unke parivaar kaa bada maan tha
 Keshavdas himself was the court poet, minister and guru of Indrajeet Singh, brother of Orchha Naresh Maharaj Ramsingh
 indrajit singh kii ore se inhen ikkis gaanv mili hue the
 He lived a luxurious life with self-respect
 keshavadas sanskrit ke udbhat vidwaan the
 Sanskrit was also promoted in his family
 naukar-chaakar bhi sanskrit bolte the
 In his family too, leaving Sanskrit and poetry in Hindi language, he found it somewhat humiliating - keshav bade bhavuk or rasik vyakti the
 It is said that once in old age he was sitting at a well
 vahaan pani bharne ke liye ai hui kuch striyon ne unhen baba kahkar sambodhan kiya
 On this, he said the following couplet - samvath 1608 ke lagbhag jahangir ne orchha kaa rajya vir singh dev ko de diya
 Keshav stayed in the court of Veer Singh for some time, then went to the Gangat and started living there
 1618 isvi main unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 The nine authentic texts composed by Keshavdas are: Rasikapriya, Kavipriya, Nakhshikh, Chandmala, Ramachandrika, Veerasinghdeva Charit, Ratanbavani, Vigyanagita and Jahangir Jaschandrika
 rasikapriya keshav kii praudh rachana he jo kavyashastra sambandhi granth hai
 Symptoms of rasa, vritti and kavyadoshas are given in it

 Kavipriya is a poetry-related treatise which was presented for Indrajit Singh's Rakshita and Keshav's disciple Pravinaray

 Ramachandrika is his most famous epic, in which the content has been taken from many texts like Prasannaraghava, Hanumannakataka, Kadambari etc

, he has more mood
 sanvaadon kii yojana main, naatakeey tatwon ke sannivesh ke kaaran, inhen vishesh safalataa mili he
 Their simplicity has been expressed at more places in the Muktakas than in the arrangements
 keshav darbari kavi the
 Like other courtly poets, they have also celebrated their refugee kings
 vir singh dev charit or jahangir jas chandrika unki aisi hi rachanaaen hai
 The second form of Keshava is that of Acharya
 kavi-priya or rasik-priya main inhone sanskrit ke lakshan, granthon kaa anuwaad kiya or udhaaharan swaroop apni kavitaaon kii rachana kii
 The theme of Ram Chandrika is Rama-bhakti but Keshava poets were first, devotees later
 atah unamem bhakthi-bhaavana kii apeksha kavy-chamatkaar ke pradarshan kii bhaavana adhik he
 In the Science Gita, Keshav expresses feelings related to asceticism
 rajdarbaron kii saaj-sajja ke bich rahane ke kaaran keshav kii pravriti prakruti main nahin rahi
 His nature-portrayal is flawed
 usamen parampara kaa nirvaad adhik he, moulikta or naveenta kam
 Keshav has not even taken care of time and place in narrating
 alankaaron ke boj se dabi prakruti apana sahan saundarya kho baithi he
 Keshav's fantasies regarding nature have become very inconsistent and uninteresting at some places
 arun surya ko kapalik kaal kaa rakt se bharaa kapaal bana dena kase kaa chakar prathit hoga - Being a court poet, the eloquence of the courts was present in Keshav
 atah sanvaadon kii yojana main unhen asaadhaaran safalataa mili
 His dialogues are very attractive
 unamem rajdarbaron jaisi haazir-javaabi or shishtataa he
 The characters are inaugurated beautifully by them

 See an answer and answer under 'angad-ravana-dialogue' - ravan- Angad- acharya keshavadas ucchkoti ke vidwaan the
 Therefore, there is more yoga in his poetry and imagination
 unka dhyaan jitna paanditya-pradarshan kii ore tha utana bhav-pradarshan kii ore nahin
 Due to this trend of erudition, some critics have called Keshav a heartless poet, but this allegation is not completely true, because along with the performance of erudition, there are many places in Keshav's poetry where his sentimentality and warm-heartedness came true
 is
 ashok vatika main hanuman ji sita ji ko ramchandra ji kii mudrika dete hai
 How expressive Sita ji's statement towards the ring is- keshav ne apane kavy kaa madhyam brajabhasha ko banaaya, parantu brajabhasha kaa jo dhalaa hua rup sur aadi asht chhap ke kaviyon main miltaa he vah keshav kii kavita main nahin
 Keshav was a Sanskrit scholar, so his language is heavily influenced by Sanskrit
 unhone sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon ko hi nahin, sanskrit kii vibhaktiyon ko bhi apanaaya he, kahin-kahin to unke chhandon kii bhashaa sanskrit hi jaan padati he- There is also a lot of mixture of Bundelkhandi language in Keshav's language
 khaarak, thorila, dugai, gauramadine aadi jaise bundeli shabdon kaa prayog baraabar unke kavy main hua
 Words of the period language are also used
 jaise - ihaan, uhaan, dikhau, rijhaau aadi
 Keshav has coined the words at some places
 jaise - chaap se chaapkeey
 Even in the use of obsolete words, he worked with complete freedom
 jaise - alok, laanch, nari aadi
 The use of the word poison in the meaning of water is found only in the language of Keshava - sanskrit or bundelkhandi ke atyadhik prabhaav, lambii-lambii shabd-yojana aprachlit shabdon ke prayog aadi ke kaaran keshav kii bhashaa main kahin-kahin atyant vilshtataa aa gai he
 The general form of Keshav's language is relatively intelligible
 usamen kahawaton or muhaavaron kaa bhi yatha-sthaan prayog hua he
 Look at the use of the phrase Lajna die - keshav kii style par unke vyaktitv kii chhap spasht drushtigochar hoti he is sambandh main unhone apane kisi purv kavi kaa anusaran nahin kiya
 His poetry can be easily identified among the poems of many poets
 sankshep main keshav kii style praudh or gambhir he
 Because of erudition, she has become somewhat arrogant
 keshav das ji ne apane kavy main anek sthalon par vividh rason kii utkrisht vyanjana kii he, kintu mukhyatah ve shringaar or vir ras ke kavi hai
 They have adopted both sides of the makeup
 virochit utsaah ke maarmik varnan main to ve apni sani nahin rakhte
 How encouraging is Kush's statement to Sita, lamenting Shatrughan's arrows for unconscious love
 chhandon ke vishay keshav kaa gyaan apaar tha
 No one in Hindi literature has used all the types of verses
 ramchandrika main to chhandon kii vividhta is seemaa tak pahunch gai he ki vidwaanon ne use shabdon kaa ajaayabaghar kah diya he
 Keshav himself wrote - keshav kii chand yojana sanskrit sahitya kii chand yojana he
 He has also successfully used verses like Kavita, Savaiya, Doha etc
 keshav ko alankaaron se vishesh moh tha unke anusaar - Hence, the use of different figures of speech in his poetry appears everywhere
 alankaaron ke boj se kavita ke bhav dab se gaye hai or pathak ko keval chamatkaar haath lagata he
 Where Keshav does not have a strong request for the alankar-yojana, his poetry is extremely heartwarming and succulent
 upama-alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- dasharath-maran ke uparaant bharat jab mahal main pravesh karte hai to ve maataaon ko vriksh viheen lataaon ke samaan pate hai
 Keshav Dasji is the first teacher of Hindi literature
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi kavy ke vibhinn angon kaa shastreey paddati se vivechan kiya
 It is fitting that in his poetry, the art aspect is more important than the emotional aspect and because of his erudition, he is called as the phantom of difficult poetry, but his importance does not disappear at all
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke shabdon main keshav kii rachana main sur, tulsi aadi kii si saralata or tanmayata chaahe na ho par kavyangon kaa vistrut parichay kara kar unhone aage ke liye maarg kholaa

 Dashakumarcharit is a Sanskrit prose written by Dandi
 isamen dash kumaron kaa charit varnit hone ke kaaran iskaa naam "dashakumarcharit" he
 The discovery of the prose called "avantisundari Katha" composed by Dandi has further compounded the problem of Daskumarcharit
 ye vikalp upasthit hote hai ki kya dashakumarcharit or avantisundari katha donon ke rachayita dandi ek hi hai athwa bhinn-bhinn hai; or yadi in donon ke lekhak ek hi dandi maan liye jaaen, to kya ye donon gadhykavy ek duusare ke poorak hai athwa do swatantra gadhykavy hai

 vidwaanon kii dharna he ki dandi ne pehle avashya purna granth kii rachana kii hogi, kintu baad main karanvash ve bhaag nasht ho gaye
 In the eight extracts of the original book of Dandi, only eight kumaras are told

 Similarly, the incomplete Vishrit Charit mentioned in the eighth extract of the original book is completed in the Uttarapeethika

 So this part was in the eleventh century

 uttarpithika ke kari sanskaran hai- ek chakrapani kaa, doosraa narayan kaa, or kuch bhaag padmanabh ke
 Because the things mentioned in the main story have found opposition at many places in the antechamber and antechamber, it is easy to prove the antecedent and antecedent
 udhaahrant: mukhya bhaag main arthpal tathaa pramati kampal ke putr hai jinaki maataaon ke naam kramash: kantimati tathaa taravali he, parantu purv-peethika main arthpal, taravali kaa putr he or pramati, sumati naamak mantri kaa

 dandi ke padlaalitya ke udhaaharan rup prastut hai- Or is prakaar ke udhaaharan praaia: prachurya se milte hai or 'dandinah padlaalityam' kii ukti ko siddh karte hai
 Dandi's design is a matter of pride

 On reading Dasakumarcharit, the reader realizes that he is tasting some succulent composition
 jivan kii anubhutiyaan aankhon ke samaksh utar aati hai or vah kavi ko apana ek atarang mitra sa anubhav karata he
 There is neither a plan for 'pratyakshalya' like Subandhu nor an artificiality of the 'sarsasirvarnapada' like the arrow in Dandi's poetry

 Short words and sentences are visible, playing like novices and they suddenly attract the heart

 Pt
 Nehru did not agree with the letters written in the context of Nepal in 1950

 Such thoughts did not dissolve even after the knowledge had become light, but these began to be considered superstitions
 adikaal main manushya kaa kriya kshetra sankuchit tha isliye andhvishwaason kii sankhya bhi alp thi
 As the human actions expanded, the web of superstitions also spread and many distinctions were discerned
 andhvishwaas sarvadeshik or saarvkalik hai
 They remain hidden even in the light of science

 Generally, each spoken language has a complementary sign language such that each linguistic population consists of deaf members, which produce sign language
 thik usee prakaar jaise bhugolic yaa saanskrithik bal jansankhya ko alag karte hai or vibhinn or pruthak maukhik bhashaaen banati hai, vahi bal sanket bhashaaon ko bhi parichaalit karte hai or isliye ve sthaneey maukhik bhashaaon ke samaan hi lagbhag unheen kshetron main samay ke saath apni pahchaan qaayam rakhane kii ore pravrutt hote hai
 This occurs even if the sign languages have no relation to the terrestrial oral language where they originated
 However, there are notable exceptions to this pattern, as diverse, unrelated sign languages exist in geographical regions that speak the same oral language

 Sign language in linguistic context, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages", is as rich and complex as any oral language
 Professional linguists studied several sign languages and found that each linguistic component needed to be classified as the correct language
 sanket bhashaaen mim nahin hai - duusare shabdon main, sanket paaramparik hai, aksar yadrichhik or zaruri nahin ki unke nirdeshy se drishy sambandh rakhte hon, thik usee prakaar jaise ki maukhik bhashaa anukaranmulak nahin hai

 There is a common misconception that sign languages are dependent on oral languages in some form, that is, they express verbal language in a gesture, or were invented by those who can hear
 thomas hopkins galoudette jaise badhir vidyalayon ke shravan shakti vaale shikshakon ko aksar galat tareeke se sanket bhashaa ke "avishkaarak" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Handwriting alphabets are used in sign languages, mostly for proper nouns and technical or specific vocabulary derived from oral languages
 The use of finger spelling was once considered to be evidence that sign languages are simple forms of oral languages, but in fact it is only one of many tools
 anguli vartanee kabhi-kabhi nae chihnon kaa strot bhi ho sakati he, jinhen shabdic sanket kaha jaataa he
 Overall, deaf sign languages are independent of oral languages and follow their own path to development
 udhaahrant:, british sanket bhashaa tathaa america sanket bhashaa bahut bhinn tathaa paraspar aspasht hai, jabaki britain tathaa america ke shravan shakti vaale log ek hi maukhik bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai
 Similarly, in countries where the same oral language is used everywhere, there may be two or more sign languages; Whereas in an area where there is more than one oral language, they may possibly use only one sign language
 dakshin africa, jahaan 11 maukhik rajbhashaayen or itani hi sankhya main anya vyapak rup se prayukt maukhik bhashaaen maujuud hai, iskaa ek acha udhaaharan he
 Due to its history of two major educational institutions of the deaf serving various geographical areas of the country, only one sign language is in circulation

 However, the story required only 122 signs, while 210 words were needed; Hence, it took equal time to narrate the story in both ways
 ursula ne phir yah dekhne ke liye pareekshan kiya ki kahin ASL main koi mahatvapurn jaankaree chhot to nahin gai
 a story in ASL was given to a bilingual person for translation
 ek or dwibhashi sanketakarta, jo keval sanket dekh saktaa tha, usne phir us kahani ko waapas angreji main anudit kiya: sanket bhashaa main suchit jaankaree mul kahani ke samaan hi thi
 Although the scope of this study is limited, it shows that ASL signals have more information than oral English: 1
5 argument sentences per second compared to 1
3 in oral English
 sanket bhashaaen drishy madhyam kii anuthi visheshtaon kaa dohan karti hai
 Oral language is straightforward; Only one sound can be produced or received at a time
 duusari ore, sankethik bhashaa drishyaatmak hoti he; at: ek hi baar main puure drishy ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Information can be loaded and expressed in multiple channels simultaneously
 bataur udhaaharan angrezi main ek vaakyansh bolaa ja saktaa he, "main vaahan se yahaan pahunchaa"

 " haalanki, america sankethik bhashaa main, sadak ke aakaar ke bare main jaankaree yaa yatra kii sukhad prakruti ko haath kii gati se kriya rup main prastut karte hue yaa shaareerik yaa chehre ke haav-bhav jaise bina hastchaalan ke sanketon kaa laabh uthaate hue, usee samay jab 'yatra' shabd kaa sanket diya ja rahaa ho, ek saath vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, while the English phrase "I came here by vehicle and my journey was pleasant" can be longer than the American sign language "I arrived here by vehicle", both have the same length

 Although sign languages have emerged naturally with or away from oral languages in deaf communities, they are not related to oral languages and have a distinct grammatical structure at their core

 Due to the establishment of deaf schools, or due to political domination, languages may be broadened through migration

 One author has speculated that the vocabulary of the adamorobe sign language and regional distinctions, including verses and sound, are associated with "a particular dialect of the symbolic business-class spoken throughout the markets of West Africa"
 bhashaaon ke saamaanya soochikaran se hat kar, is anukram main ekmaatr vyapak vargeekaran 1991 main kiya gaya tha
 This classification is based on the 69 sign languages of the 1988 edition of the Ethnologue known at the time of the Sign Languages conference held in Montreal in 1989, and 11 more languages added by the author after the conference

 prototype-a category languages include all sign languages that are not necessarily derived from any other language
 prototip-r bhashaaen ve hai jo "prerak vistaar" naamak croabar prakriya dwaara prototip-a bhashaa par mote taur par aadhaarit he
 Classes of BSL-, DGS-, JSL-, LSF- and lsg-derived languages represent "new languages" derived from prototype languages by linguistic processes of cryolization and lexical substitution

 Linguistic classification is based on word structure and distinguishes into morphological categories such as grouping / hierarchical, inflective, multicomponent, contiguous, and discrete
 sanket bhashaaen vaakyatmak vargeekaran main bhinn hote hai chunki vibhinn bhashaaon main shabd kaa kram alag-alag hota he
 For example, OGS is the doer-karma-verb, while the ASL is the doer-karma-verb
 aas-paas boli jane vaali bhashaaon ke saath anurupata asambhav nahin he
 Morphologically, syllable is the essential component
 pramanik shabdaakaar, yatha aksharatmakataa or rupagramta, do visheshtaon ke binary maanon ke vyavasthit yugman kaa fal he
 Brentary classify sign languages as a group by communicating as a group consisting of monosyllabic and polymorphic features
 iskaa matlab he, ek akshar ke zarie kai rupagraamon ko vyakt kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki kriya ke karta or karm, kriya kii gati kii disha nirdhaarit karte hai
 This is necessary for sign languages to ensure a comparative production rate for verbal languages, because the production of a sign takes longer than saying a word — but compared to sentence by sentence, signic and verbal languages have roughly the same speed

 sankethik bhashaa lekhan ke maamle main maukhik bhashaa se alag he
 Phonographic systems of oral languages are primarily sequential: meaning most phonemes are generated sequentially one after the other, although many languages have random aspects such as vowels
 parinamswaroop, paaramparik dhvanigramic lekhan pranaliyaan bhi anukramik hai, jahaan bal or swar jaise kramarahit pahaluon ke liye uttam dhwani-nirdeshak maujuud hai
 Sign languages have highly randomized components, where multiple "phonograms" are generated simultaneously
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanketon main ungliyaan, haath or lagaataar hilne vaala cheharaa yaa do alag dishaao main gatisheel do haath shaamil ho sakate hai
 Traditional writing systems are not designed to deal with this level of complexity
 aanshik rup se is kaaran, sanket bhashaaon ko aksar likhaa nahin jaataa he
 In countries where good educational opportunities are available for the deaf, many deaf indicators can adequately read and write their country's oral language to such a level that they are considered "functionally literate"
 However, in many countries, the education system for the deaf is quite poor and / or very limited
 falswaroop, adhikansh badhir log apane desh kii maukhik bhashaa main bahut kam sakshar yaa sakshartaa rahit hai
 However, several attempts were made to develop a script for sign languages
 stoco ankan wiliam stoco dwaara apane 1965 dictionari of american sin language ke liye abhikalpit swanim varnmaala he
 Built specifically for ASL, it is limited in the way that it has no way of expressing facial expressions

 On the other hand, the Hamburg notation system is an elaborate phonetic system not designed for any signaling system and is intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than experimental scripts

 However, because it is pictorial and not phonetic, it does not have the direct compatibility of signs and can often be written in many ways

 One of the first demonstrations of telecommunications's ability to help signal language users communicate with each other was presented when at&t's videophone was publicly launched at the 1964 New York World's Fair — two fair and two deaf in the other city Users were able to communicate with each other easily
 Various organizations have also conducted research on signals through videotlephony

 In VRS, the user of the sign language, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three different locations, thus the two parties are able to talk to each other over the phone through the interpreter
 aise maamalon main vyakhya pravaah saamanytah sanket bhashaa or maukhik bhashaa ke bich hota he jo aam taur par ek hi desh main prayukt hota he, jaise maukhik french ke liye francisi sanket bhashaa, maukhik spanish ke liye spanish sanket bhashaa, maukhik angrezi ke liye british sanket bhashaa, maukhik angrezi ke liye america sanket bhashaa bhi aadi
 mul bhashaaon ke bich anuwaad bhi karne main sakasham bahubhashi sanket bhashaa dubhashiye bhi uplabdh hai, lekin kam
 is tarah kii gatividhiyon main dubhashiye ko paryaapt prayaas karnaa padataa he, kyonki desh main prayukt maukhik bhashaa se sanket bhashaa apni hi rachana or vaakyavinyas sahit bhinn sahaj bhashaa hone ke kaaran, alag hai
 With video interpretation, sign language interpreters work remotely, including live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf and interact with the hearing impaired and vice versa
 Similar to telephone interpretation, video interpretation can be used on occasions when interpreters are not available at the same location
 However, video interpretation cannot be used in situations where all parties are only talking through the telephone
 VRI and VRS interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment
 kuch aadhunik upkaran dubhashiyon ko duurastha video camera niyantrit karne main sakasham banaata he, taaki sanket karne vaale paksh par camera zum-in or zum-out yaa ingit kar saken
 Signal systems sometimes develop within the same family
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab bina sankethik bhashaa kaushal ke shravan shakti vaale mata-pita kii santan badhir ho, swaabhaavik taur par sanketon kii ek anaupchaarik pranali viksit hoti he, basharte ki mata-pita iskaa daman na karen
 in laghu-bhashaaon ke liye prayukt shabd he home sin 
 Domestic signals are caused by the absence of any other mode of communication
 ekal jeevankaal main or samudaay ke samarthan ke bina, baccha apane sampreshan kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye swaabhaavik rup se sanketon kaa avishkaar karata he
 However this type of system is grossly inadequate for the intellectual development of the child and does not, in general, in any way meet the standard set by linguists to define a complete language
 gharelu sanket kaa kisi bhi prakaar ko aadhikarik bhashaa ke rup main manyata praapt nahin he
 Gesture is a special component of oral languages
 hastchalit sampreshan kii vistrut pranaliyaan aisi jagahon yaa paristhitiyon main viksit hui hai, jahaan baatcheet praayogic yaa anumat nahin he, jaise ki dharmik samudaayon ke math, scuba diving, television recording studio, kolahalapurna kaarysthal, share bazaar, besabaal, shikaar, yaa sharad khel main
 rugby union main reffri darshakon ko apane nirnay sampreshit karne ke liye simit lekin paribhaashit sanketon kaa upyog karata he
 Recently, there has been a movement to teach and encourage sign language before young children learn how to speak it, as some children would have been able to communicate effectively through sign languages before they started speaking orally
 Huh
 ise aam taur par baby sin ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In addition, children with other causes such as speech impairment or delay who are not deaf or hearing impaired have also agitated the use of sign languages for the benefit of effective communication rather than relying on speaking
 aise avasar par, jahaan bahere logon kii maujuudagi kaaphi adhik he, ek sampurna sthaneey samudaay dwaara badhir sankethik bhashaa ko apanaaya gaya he
 Famous examples of this include Martha's Vineyard Sign Language in the United States, Kata Coloc in the Village of Bali, Adamorobe Sign Language in Ghana and the Yucatec Maya Sign Language in Mexico
 Deaf people do not remain socially deprived in such communities
 kai australian adivasee sankethik bhashaaen, shok yaa diksha sanskaar jaise avasaron par bolne sambandhi vyapak nishedh ke sandarbh main utpann huin
 ve varlpiri, vaarumungu, deiri, ketet, arante or varlmanpa ke bich vishesh rup se atyadhik viksit hai yaa thim or apni sambhddha maukhik bhashaaon par aadhaarit hai
 a mixed sign language flourished among the tribes of the American Indian in the vast plains of North America
 It was used for communicating between tribes with different oral languages
 aajkal vishesh rup se kro, cheyen or arapaho ke bich upyogkarta hai
 Unlike other sign languages developed by people with hearing power, it resembles the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages
 sanket siddhant kahata he ki mukhar maanav bhashaa kaa vikaas ishaaron kii sanket bhashaa se hua he
 Significance theory has an important question as to what is the reason for changing the recitation
 maanvon se samvaad karne ke liye vaigyanikon dwaara gair-maanav vaanron ko buniyadi sanket sikhaane ke kai ullekhneey udhaaharan maujuud hai
 Notable examples are: badhir samudaay duniya bhar main vyapak rup se faile hai or unke bich maujuud samskruti bahut samrudh he
 Due to different barriers for deaf people to understand audio information, sometimes it does not integrate with the hearing culture
 kuch sanket bhashaaon ne kisi na kisi rup main kanoonee manyata hasil kii he, jabaki anya ko koi mahatv hasil nahin he
 This Sunni Muslim is highly acclaimed by Sunni Muslims as well as Zaidi Shia Muslims in Sahih Muslim Sunni Islam
 or sahih al-bukaari ke baad doosraa sabase pramanik haddees sangrah mana jaataa he
 It was collected by Muslim Ibn al-hajjaj, also known as Imam Muslim
 is tathy ke kaaran kabhi-kabhi isaki pramanikta par sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki yah islamic paigambar, mohammad ke 250 saal baad likhaa gaya tha
 Despite this, Sunni Muslims believe that it is genuine and authentic
 sahih muslim, sahih al-bukaari ke saath sahihain ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Muslim Ibn al-hajjaj, the collector of Sahih Muslim, was born into a Persian family in 204 Hijri in Nishapur and died in 261 Hijri
 unhone vyapak rup se iraq, arab prayadweep, syria or misr ke kshetron sahit ahadis ke sangrah ko ikattha karne ke liye vyapak rup se yatra kii
 Out of 300,000 hadiths they evaluated, only about 4,000 were removed for inclusion in their collections based on stringent acceptance criteria
 unke sangrah main prayek report kii jaanch kii gai or ullekhakartaaon kii shrinkhalaa kii satyata ko dridhtaa se sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Sunni Muslims consider it the second most authentic Hadith collection after Sahih al-bukhari
 sahih muslim 43 kitabon main baanta gaya he, jisamen kul 9200 kathaayen hai
 However, it is important to realize that the Muslim Ibn al-hajjaj never claimed to collect all authentic traditions because his goal was simply to gather traditions that all Muslims should agree about accuracy
 munsiri ke anusaar, sahih muslim main kul 2,200 haddees hai
 According to Muhammad Amin, there are 1,400 authentic hadiths which can be seen in other books, mainly in six major hadith collections
 kai muslim is sangrah ko chah pramukh haddees sangrahon main se duusare sabase pramanik maanate hai, jisamen keval sahih haddees hote hai
 And the collection of this hadith is considered to be the stuff with Sahih al-bukhari, both of which are called Do Sahih
 shiya muslim kuch kathaon kii sandigdh vishwasaneeyata ke kaaran apni kuch saamagree ko avishwasaneey rup se khaarij kar dete hai
 Despite the book's high standard, and the scholarly consensus that Sahih is the second most valid classified book of hadith after al-bukhari, it is agreed that this does not mean that every element in it is true, other than the hadith
 This book is considered authentic when compared to books
 praathmik rup se is kitaab ko sahih al bukhari ke saamaan mana jaataa he, is kaa yah bhi matlab nahin ki sahih al bukhari main sahih muslim se bhi zyaada pramanik haddees hai
 Noted Islamic scholar Amin Ahsan Islamahi summarized some unique features of Sahih Muslim: sahih muslim kii tippaniyon ke anuwaad angreji, urdu, bangla, tamil or bosnian samet kai bhashaaon main uplabdh hai

 vidyutsakti ko janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak le janaa preshan kehalaata he
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd k vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 janitrasthalon kii sthapana, vastut:, sadhano kii uplabdhi tathaa aarthik auchity ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 There is no question of making hydroelectricities in a specific place, because their location depends on natural resources which are usually far from densely populated areas
 tapiya bijligharon kii sthapana bhi bhaarakentre ke saath-saath koyale kii uplabdhi tathaa iske parivahan kii samasya par nirbhar karti he
 Hence, the distance of the generator places can be several hundred miles by weight and in such cases the power has to be carried by the transmission lines to the load
 atev preshan bhi vidyut udyog kaa utana hi mukhya or mahatvapurn ang he jitna swayan vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 upree line bhumigat se kam se kam 20 foot kii oonchaai par honi chahie or inkaa koi bhi bhaag isse kam oonchaai par nahin hona chahie
 Their height from the ground is even higher in case of high voltage
 atev ye line polon par le jaai jaati hai or porcylen ke vidyutrodhiyon par aropit hoti hai
 The lines of thicker conductors, which transmit more power, are diverted to larger towers in place of poles, which are made of different shapes according to the driver number and the forces applied to them
 vidyutarodhi bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai or mukhyat: apni sthiti tathaa voltata ke anusaar vibhinn virgon ke hote hai
 Thus the insulators range from low voltage of 440 volts to 11 kilovolts, 33 kilovolts, 66 kilovolts, etc
 and are of an insulated shackle, pin, disc and suspension type depending on the condition used in different situations
 vidyutarodhi saadharantaya pole par kanchi main lage hote hai or is prakaar vinyasit hote hai ki kisi bhi dasha main chaalak jhulakar, duusare chaalak se, athwa pole, athwa uske kisi bhi sanrachana anshak se na chhu jaaen
 Their shape and composition are also such that under any circumstances, it is possible to maintain the conductor between the conductor and any structural fraction of the pole
 cabile, vastut:, kisi bhi vidyutarodhi chaalak ko kaha ja saktaa he, parantu vidyut ke preshan main prayukt honevaale cabile kaa upyog mukhyat: bhoomi ke andar hota he
 Therefore, the composition of cables is also such that they can be protected from the influences falling under the ground
 saamanyat: preshan cabile trikleey hote hai
 Therefore, there are at least three cores in them, which are electrically isolated and then they are also insulated from the top
 yah vidyutrodhi, saadharantaya, vyaapt kaagaj, athwa rui kii tepe kaa hota he, jo cabile kii kaaryakari voltata ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 The conductor core and dielectric lead are incorporated into the lead pipe, which does not allow moisture to enter, so that the insulator does not deteriorate
 is nalee ko yantric haani se bachaan ke liye jute kaa feeta diya jaataa he or upar se lohe kii pattee kaa kavach chadha diya jaataa
 For this reason, they are also called poetic cables
 ati ucch voltata preshan ke cabile, tel se bhare cabile bhi hote hai
 Oil is, in effect, the best dielectric medium
 parantu aise cabilon kii banaavat kaaphi jatil hoti he or inaki dekhbhaal bhi kathin hoti he
 Due to this their use is limited
 vidyutpreshan kii mitvyayita bahut seemaa tak chaalak ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 The size of the driver mainly depends on the carrying current
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara, mukhyat: voltata par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, it is only appropriate to use the highest voltage for transmission so that the current flowing through it can be reduced for that power and small size conductors can be used
 parantu ucchtam voltata kii bhi apni seemayen hai
 At voltages greater than 36 km, the size of the conductor depends not only on the magnitude of the current, but in fact, the effect of the korana
 corona ucch volttaaon par chaalak ke aasapaas kii vaayu ke ayanit hone kaa prabhaav hota he
 Due to this, the sound and brightness of Him Him is produced and it finally manifests as a power loss
 is kaaran chaalak ke aakaar kaa abhikalp is shakti haani tathaa uske prabhaavon ko drushti main rakhte hue karnaa hota he
 Interference of transmission lines at high voltages to communication lines is another important problem
 ucch voltata preshan karne vaali line samipsth sanchaar linon main ek vyatikaran voltata prerit kar detii hai, jiske kaaran sanchaar main gadabadi hoti he, par yah vyatikaran, sanchaar linon kii vidyut linon se dur rakhkar, kam kiya ja saktaa he tathaa duusare bhi bahut se upachaar kiye ja sakate hai
 The third difficulty is the proper structure of high voltage conductors and towers, so that faulty conditions do not arise
 saath hi saath unki uchit dekhbhaal bhi ek samasya ban jaati he
 In addition, power stability is a significant problem at the highest voltages
 ati ucch voltata kii lambii linon main, shaktipravaah, vastut:, shakti sthayitv dwaara simit hota he
 Because of this the rated power can only be transmitted to a specific distance at a specific voltage
 saath hi saath preshit shakti tathaa duuri ke anusaar ek vishisht voltata par preshan hi sabase adhik mitavyayi ho saktaa he
 These problems are very important in big plans and design of dispatch system is a major part of the plan
 preshnatantr kii yojana kaa aadhaar bhaar surveykshan hota he
 First the proposed load is calculated in different places and then according to them the position of the sub-centers is determined
 bhaar tathaa duuri ke anusaar preshan kii voltata tathaa paripath kii sankhya nishchit kii jaati he or prastaavit linon kaa path nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The form and design of line design, the type of insulation and the mechanism of their installation and protection mechanism is the most important economic aspect for any scheme
 preshnatantr kaa safal abhikalp bhi aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system also depends on economic criteria
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke preshan ke teen mukhya sanghatak he : shakti, duuri tathaa voltata
 Successful design of any remittance scheme depends on the appropriate coordination of these three components
 line abhikalp kii disha main mahatvapurn shodh ho rahe hai, jinke parinamswaroop ab vidyutrodhon ke str ko utana unchaa nahin rakhaa jaataa jitna 10 varsh pehle rakhaa jaataa tha
 In this way huge savings in the value of lines have been possible
 atyucch voltata kaa preshan, saadharantaya, 100 mile se adhik kii duuri ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 Often dispatch has to be done in two order
 atyucch voltata par preshan saadharantaya bijlighar ke upakentre se upyogkshetra ke bhar centre ke nearesth upakedron tak kiya jaataa he, jahaan se kisi madhyam voltata par upyogsthal ke upakentre tak shakti kar preshan kiya jaataa he
 Thus it is called as primary and secondary dispatch
 antim upakentre se bhaar tak vitarak athwa sambharan line le jaai jaati hai, jahaan se vyaktigat bhaaron kaa sambharan kiya jaataa he
 To transmit the generated voltages normally, transforms to very high voltages
 atev parinamit bhi preshnatantr ke mahatvapurn ang hote hai
 In addition to this, many protection devices and circuit trots are also a specific part of the system
 parinamitra ke donon ore tel paripath trot kii vyavastha rahati he, jisase parinamitra ke donon ore kaa paripath kholaa ja sake
 Similarly, there is a provision to disable any line or its division, so that the line can be maintained in case of defect
 vastut: sangrakshan yuktiyaan dosha kii sthiti main doshi prabhag ko apane aap kholkar alag kar detii he
 Several types of relays are used in the sub-station for line protection
 based saamaanya riley atibhaar riley or bhoomi ksharan riley hai
 Overload relays, in the event of overload, open the circuit by introducing a circuit trotter and thus protect the line and its associated damage from overload damage or harmful effects
 bhoomi ksharan riley bhumidosh kii avasthaa main kaary karte hai or doshi line ko yojit kar dete hai
 There are many different types of relays used
 bahut se riley dosha kii duuri kaa vyavastha ke aadhaar par kaary karte hai or bahut se ek pilot taar kaa prayog karte hai, tathaapi aadhuniktam sangrakshan tantra karier sangrakshan tantra he
 The carrier is, in effect, a high-frequency wave, which is impeded on the pilot wires along with the power frequency
 dosha kii sthiti main usase sanyojit riley tatkshan kaary kar, line ko viyojit kar dete hai
 The carrier protection mechanism is more rapid and more reliable than other systems
 parantu yah keval ucch voltata linon ke liye hi aarthik rup se uchit ho saktaa he
 Provision of lightning protection is also very important in the design of transmission lines
 tadit line par girakar use tathaa usase sanyojit sabhi saajasja ko nasht kar sakati he
 To avoid this, many tips are used, mainly the provision of ground wires and lightning resistant
 bhoomi taar saamaanya rup se line ko tadit ke hanikaarak prabhaavon se bachaata he or tadit ko line par yathasambhav girane se roktaa he
 Lightning plugs are placed on the sub-center or end structures, and when the lightning falls on the line, it is directly positioned, so as not to damage the line or decoration
 sabhi minar thik se bhooyojit hote hai or unka bhoomirodh vividh prakaar kii vyavasthaayen karke atyant kam rakhaa jaataa he
 From the point of view of preservation, more class dielectric also has to be used, but nowadays there is no need to keep the level of dielectric high due to research on lightning prevention
 preshantantron ko bahudhaa grid ke rup main antarbandhit kar dete hai, jisase grid ke andar shakti kaa swatantraapurvak pravaah ho sake
 Such grids operate at very high voltages and the voltage and frequency of the entire system is the same
 isamen niyantran kii kathinaaiyaan to avashya hi bad jaati hai, parantu tantra main kisi bhi sthaan kii phaltu shakti duusare sthanon par, jahaan uski aavashyaktaa ho, prayukt kii ja sakati he
 Thus, it is no longer necessary to keep additional installed power in power stations
 vastut:, bade gridon main kisi ek bijlighar, athwa mashin, kii shakti sampurna tantra kii shakti kii tulana main naganya hoti he or sampurna tantra ke kaary ko vishesh rup se prabhavit nahin kar paati
 There are many such grids in India too, such as Bhakra Grid, Ganga Hydroelectric Grid, Sharda Grid, DVC Grid, Hirakud Grid, Madras Grid, Bombay Grid etc
 sabhi badi badi yojanaayen grid ke rup main hai
 Now all these grids are being tied up and the outline of the All India Grid is being made, which is probably 350 kv
 Or even higher voltage
 alp voltata se ucch voltata main tathaa ucch se alp voltata main parinamitron dwaara roopantaran kii suvidha ke kaaran lagbhag sabhi vidyut preshan prayavarti dhara par hi hote hai
 But recently there is a profound change in this ideology and direct current transmission at very high voltages is being considered more suitable than both practical and technical forms
 aise tantra main janan tathaa upbhog donon hi pra
