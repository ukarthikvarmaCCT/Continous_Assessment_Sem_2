 magar waha bhi unhe maar dalaagaya
 Then by re-establishing the kingdom of "nagar-sthal" by Ratan Sen's eldest son Zay Sen who had escaped, this Vansh was called Jayanagar Kshatriya, which later became Jinnagar Kshatriya which is still prevalent till date

 ukt granth me prasht sankhya 2466 me likha he ki "zinagar jati kii khaas utpati kshatriya kul se hi he
 But these people, due to fear of Bhagwan Parashuramji, started counting in another caste

 Irrigation is the act of artificially watering the soil to increase the amount of water available in it and is commonly used during crop growing, to meet the water requirement of plants in dry areas or in the event of insufficient rainfall

 These addresses are typically used for home, office, and enterprise local area networks when remittable addresses via a global route are not required or unavailable for the required network applications
 privet ypi paton ke sthanon ko mul rup se ipivi4 paton ke shunyikaran ko vilambit karne ke ek prayaas main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha lekin inhen agali peedi ke internet protocol, ipivi6 main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 These addresses are defined as private because they are not delivered globally, meaning that they are not allocated to a specific organization and IP packets addressed by them are not transmitted over the public Internet

 Private addresses are also commonly used in corporate networks that are not directly connected to the Internet for security reasons
 network ke aantarik upyogkartaaon ko internet kii simit pahunch pradaan karne ke liye aksar ek proxi, socks getwe yaa isi tarah ke anya upkarnon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In both cases, private addresses are often seen as better security for internal networks because it is difficult for an Internet host to directly connect to an internal system
 kyonki kai nijee network ek samaan ypi pate kaa istemaal karte hai, is tarah ke networkon ko ek saath milaane main ek aam samasya paidaa hoti he, paton ke sthanon kaa takaraav yani kai upkarnon par paton kii nakal kaa taiyaar ho janaa
