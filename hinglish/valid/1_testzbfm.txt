 Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist from England
 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher

 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711

 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe

 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought

 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation

 pramaatra sanganak aisa sanganak he jo apane kaary ke liye adhyaropan evam pramaatra uljhaav jaisi pramaatra yantric parighatnaon kaa sidhe upyog karata he
 The basic premise of quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on them
 pramaatra sanganak tronsister par aadhaarit paramparaagat sanganakon se bhinn hote hai
 It has a theoretical perspective - Quantum Touring Machine, which is also known as Universal Quantum Computer
 pramaatra sanganakon kii saiddhanthik samanta, non-diterministic tathaa prayikta aadhaarit automaton ke saath he
 An example of such equality is the ability to be together in more than one state

 Both experimental and theoretical research are in progress
 bahut si rashtriya sarkarein tathaa sainya vittaposhak agenciyaan bhi pramaatra abhikalan par anusandhan ko sambal detii hai, taaki naagarik tathaa rashtriya suraksha uddeshyon se ) pramaatra sanganak kaa vikaas kiya ja sake
 An algorithm running in polynomial time is known to factorize integers on a quantum computer
 par bahut prayaas ke vabjood bhi iske liye gaiyr-kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin mil paaya he
 This has cast doubt on the Strong Church Turing thesis, an important hypothesis of theoretical computer science
 strong carch turing thisis ek darshanik tark he jo kahata he ki - jis computesnal problem ke liye kisi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm ban saktaa he, us problem ke liye ek clasical computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga; or jis problem ke liye ek clasical computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he, us problem ke liye kisi bhi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he
 Since a quantum computer for the factorization of integers is an algorithm running in polynomial time, according to the Strong Church Turing thesis it would require an algorithm running in polynomial time on a non-quantum computer as well
 isliye, agar koi ye sabit kar detaa he ki purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye ek gaiyr-kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he, to iskaa arth hoga ki strong carch turing thisis galat he
 Around 1700 AD, there was a new twist in Hindi poetry
 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskrit sahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic texts of rasa, ornamentation etc
, the poetry of this time has been called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 There have been many poets in this period who were also Acharyas and who wrote texts giving the characteristics of various Kavyangas
 is yug main shringaar kii pradhanta rahi
 This era was the era of liberation
 mukhyatya kavitt, savaiye or dohe is yug main likhe gaye
 Poets were kings-based, so the poetry of this era was mostly courtier, as a result of which special amount of miraculous euphemism is available in it, but the poem also became alienated from ordinary people
 reetikaal ke adhikansh kavi darbari the
 Keshavdas, Pratap Singh, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Chintamani, Dev, Bhikharidas, Raghunath, Beni, Gang, Tikaram, Gwal, Chandrashekhar Bajpai, Harnam, Vice Chancellor Mishra, Nevaaz, Surti Mishra, Kavindra Udayanath, Rishinath, Ratan Kavi, Beni Bandijan , Beni Praveen, Brahmadatta, Thakur Bundelkhandi, Bodha, Guman Mishra, etc
 and many poets were kings, such as Maharaj Jaswant Singh, Bhagwant Rai Kheichi, Bhupathi, Rasnidhi, Maharaj Vishwanath, Dwijdev
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika
 kavipriya main alankaar or rasikapriya main ras kaa sodaaharan nirupan he
 Symptoms are in couplets and examples in Kavitasvaiya
 lakshan-lakshya-granthon kii yahi parampara reetikavy main viksit hui
 Ramachandrika is Keshava's anthology in which the vigorous Kalacheta of a vigilante artist emerged in place of devotion to devotion
 keshav ke kai dashak baad chintamani se lekar atharahavin sadi tak hindi main reetikavy kaa ajasr strot pravaahit hua jisamen nar-nari-jivan ke romantic pakshon or tatsambandhi saras samvednaaon kii atyant kalatmak abhivyakti vyapak rup main hui
 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love
 maatra or kavyagun donon hi drushtiyon se is samay kaa nar-nari-prem or saundarya kii maarmik vyanjana karanevaala kavyasahitya mahatvapurn he
 Veerakavya was also written at this time
 mughal shaasha aurangzeb kii kattar sampradayikta or aakraamak raajnneeti kii takaraahat se is kaal main jo vikshobh kii sthitiyaan ai unhone kuch kaviyon ko virakavy ke srijan kii bhi prerana di
 Among such poets, Bhushan is prominent, who, despite adopting the ritual style, described the valor of valor vigorously
 is samay niti, vairaygy or bhakthi se sambandhit kavy bhi likhaa gaya
 a number of notebooks were also produced
 idhar ke shodhakarya main is samay kii shringaretar rachanaayen or prabandhkavy prachur pariman main mil rahe hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider ritual poetry as absolutely one-sided and consistent
 is samay ke kavy main purvavarti kaalon kii sabhi pravritiyaan sakriy hai
 This main stream is that of Shringarakavya, which has been considered as a real demonstrator of the poetic wealth of this time
 shringaari kavy teen virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first category is of the poets whose representatives are Keshava, Chintamani, Bhikharidas, Dev, Matiram and Padmakar etc
 in kaviyon ne dohon main ras, alankaar or nayika ke lakshan dekar kavitt savaie main prem or saundarya kii kalapurna maarmik vyanjana kii he
 The classical discussion represented in Sanskrit literature has more following them
 par kuch ne thodi moulikta bhi dikhaai he, jaise bhikharidas kaa hindi chhandon kaa nirupan
 The second category is of recited poets
 in kaviyon ne lakshan nahin nirupit kiye, keval unke aadhaar par kavyrachana kii
 Bihari is the best among them, presenting his "satsai" in couplets
 vibhinn mudraonvaale atyant vyanjak saundaryachitron or prem kii bhavadashaon kaa anupam ankan inke kavy main miltaa he
 In the third category, Ghanananda, Bodha, Dwijdev Thakur, etc
 are free poets who have given expression of free love
 inaki rachanaaon main prem kii tivrata or gahanta kii atyant prabhaavshaalee vyanjana hui he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke romantic pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals increased and the Hindi poetry became narrower
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 History testifies that this era was a period of splendid development even in its defeat period
 mughal darbar ke haram main paanch-paanch hajaar rupasiyaan rahati thim
 Meena used to be a marketer, there was a free trade of sura-sundari
 dow nagendra likhte hai- "vaasana kaa sagar aise prabal veg se umad rahaa tha ki shuddhivaad samraat ke sabhi nishedh praytn usamen bah gayi
 amir-umrao garrisoned his prohibition papers in the liquor jug
 vilaas ke anya saadhan bhi prachur maatra main the
 "padmakar has outlined the outline of the then courts in one verse - ahalokikta, shringaarikta, nayikabhed or alankaar-priyata is yug kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Almost all poets have adopted Braj language
 swatantra kavita kam likhi gai, ras, alankaar vagairah kavyangon ke lakshan likhte samay udhaaharan ke rup main - visheshkar shringaar ke alambanon evam uddipano ke udhaaharan ke rup main - saras rachanaaen is yug main likhi gayi
 The Bhushan poet also gave compositions of Veer Ras
 bhav-paksh kii apeksha kala-paksh adhik samrudh rahaa
 Special attention was not given to word-power, nor to the drama of drama
 vishyon kaa sankoch ho gaya or moulikta kaa hraas hone laga
 There were many poets at this time - Keshav, Chintamani, Dev, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Ghanananda, Padmakar etc
 inamen se keshav, bihari or bhushan ko is yug kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Bihari fully developed the possibilities of the couplets
 aapako reeti-kaal kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Poets of this period can be divided into three categories - reetibaddh kavi Free poet ritisiddh kavi Scholars are also of the opinion that poets of this period have fully adhered to dignity in poetry
 ghor shringaari kavita hone par bhi kahin bhi maryaada kaa ulanghan dekhne ko nahin miltaa he

 According to the divine account, he is the last of the seven snakes and is believed to have originated from the tongue
 atri kii patni anusuya thi, jinhen saat mahila patharaavon main se ek mana jaataa he
 When instructed to do penance by divine voice, Atri immediately agreed and performed severe austerities

 He sought all three to be born to him

 The incidents of the same sage occurring at different times in the Puranas, are actually not a person but a sage tradition
 Just as all the successors of Adi Shankaracharya are called Shankaracharya, in the same way the successor of a great sage was considered to be his own form

 And the general public knew the chancellor of that ashram as the founder Rishi

 There are many types of transformers, from the point of view of work, from the point of view of the core and from the size-type, but depending on the design, they can be divided into three categories - croadwale parinamitra - iskaa crode nirantar chumbakeey path kaa hota he
 Primary and secondary coils are located in different segments of the core
 kabhi-kabhi praathmik or dwitiyak ghatak ek ytaakar crode ke bhinn bhinn parshvon par hote hai
 Armored Transformers - These are different from core transformers

 These transformers provide stable voltages, even though the variance of the input voltages varies between wide ranges
 yah swaniyantran praathmik or dwitiyak donon paripathon main ek bahugun kundalan se hota he
 One of the secondary coils is made resonant by connecting its capacitor across
 dwitiyak ke is bhaag or dwitiyak kundali ke avshisht bhaag main voltata main 180 degree kaa kalantar hota he
 Therefore, the resulting voltage across the entire secondary coil remains constant
 iske atirikt ucch chumbakeey flux ghanata swat: kshatipuran main sahaayak hota he
 When the primary voltage varies from 95 to 135 volts, the secondary voltage varies only by percentage

 Commercial stationary-voltage transformers are available and widely used in laboratories and industries
 inamen praathmik or dwitiyak ke bich kii duuri ko kisi upyogi yukti se banaae rakhte hai
 This produces a steady current, which is not affected by the changes in input voltage

 The caliphs after the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD were considered political leaders of the entire Muslim region
 caliphaaon kaa silsilaa ant main jaakar osmani samrajya ke patan par 1925 main hi khatm hua
 The word 'khalifa' in Arabic means 'representative' or 'successor'
 pigambar mohammad kii 632 isvi main mrityu ke baad puure muslim jagat kii rajnatik bagdor sanbhaalane waalon ko 'caliph rasul allaah' kaha jaataa tha, yani 'allaah ke rasul kaa uttaradhikari'
 Just as the kingdom of 'nobles' was called 'princely', the kingdom of 'rich' was called 'emirate' and the kingdom of 'khan' was called 'khanat', similarly the rule of 'khalifa' was called 'khilafat'
 'caliph' main 'kh' akshar ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah bina bindu vaale 'kha' se zaraa bhinn he
 It is pronounced with 'khab' and 'kha' for 'khad'
 pigambar mohammad ke dehanth ke baad ke pehle chaar caliphaaon ko sunni mat ke anuyaayi 'raashidi caliph' kehete hai, jise arabi lahaze main 'caliph ur-rashidun' or farsi lahaze main 'caliph-e-raashidin' bhi kehete hai
 'rashid' means 'one who walks on the right track' in Arabic
 yah chaar caliph is prakaar the: abu bakar as-siddiq, umr ebn al-khattab, osman ebn affaan or ali ebn abu talib
 These four were his companions during Muhammad's lifetime
 pigambar mohammad ke guzarane ke turant baad aapasi baatcheet se abu bakar ko caliph chunaa gaya or mohammad ke saathiyon ne unase vafadaari kii shapath lee
 Some people were angry with this election because they thought that Ali was the closest relative of the Prophet, so he should have become the Khalifa
 abu bakar kaa shashan 632 se 634 keval do saal hi chalaa tha ki ve biimaar pade or mrityodasha par aa pahunche
 Before his death, he made Umar Khalifa without consulting him
 umr se vafadaari kii shapath keval unhi saathiyon ne lee jo us samay madina main the, jis se kuch anya saathiyon ne unhen caliph maanane se anakani kerani shuru kar di
 At that time, the Arabs attacked Iran for spreading Islam, and enraged by this, some Iranians killed Omar on November 7, 644, about 10 years after taking power
 umr ne pehle hi chah logon kaa ek gut banaaya tha jisamen se aapasi samjhaute se unhone ek ko chunakar caliph bananaa tha
 This included Ali and Usman
 osman ko chunaa gaya or ve 11 navambar 644 tisare caliph bane
 About 12 years later, on 17 July 656, he was also murdered by some rebels and Ali was elected the fourth Khalifa
 shiya anuyaayion kaa mat he ki pehle teen caliphaaon kaa raaj najayas tha or shuru se hi ali ko caliph hona chahie tha kyonki ve pigambar ke paariwarik rishtedaar bhi the or unki beti fatima ke pati bhi
 When Ali became Khalifa, there was a lot of disturbance and stigma
 sabe badi chunauti damishq ke rajyapal muawiyah se ai jo osman ke rishtedaar the or jinaki bahan se pigambar mohammad ne vivaah kiya tha
 Mu'awiyah said that Ali is not catching the slaves of his relative Usman
 unhone furaat nadi ke kinare ali kii faujon ke saath 'sifin kaa yuddh' chhedaa jisamen kisi kii jeet-haar na hui
 Ali agreed to negotiate with Mu'awiyah to stop the bloodshed
 ali kii faujon main 4,000 kattarpanthi logon kaa gut tha jo 'kaariji' kehalaate the or jinka yah kadaa mat tha ki haar-jeet kaa nirnay keval ishwar ke haath main he or marate dam tak yah yuddh nahin rokna chahie
 They split from him, accusing Ali of deviating from the right path
 lagbhag do saal baad 'naharvaan ke yuddh' main ali ko kaarigiyon se ladanaa padaa jisamen ali kii jeet hui
 After this, one day he was offering prayers in the mosque of Kufa when he was attacked by a Khariji named 'ibn Muljam' with a poisoned sword
 ve guzar gaye
 One of his two sons - Hasan and Hussain - was to be elected the Khalifa, as Prophet Muhammad was the maternal grandfather of both, and Ali instructed that the latter Khalifa should belong to the Prophet's household
 hasan ko chatha caliph banaaya gaya lekin unke caliph banate hi muawiyah ne unki faujon ko unke viruddh bhadakaana shuru kar diya
 The war between Hasan and Mu'awiyah became a condition
 muslim samudaay ko bantane se rokane ke liye hasan ne samjhauta kiya ki ve caliph kii gaddi tyaag denge or muawiyah ko caliph sweekaar lenge basharte muawiyah kii mrityu ke baad gaddi waapas hasan yaa unke uttaradhikari ko mili
 Mu'awiyah became the seventh Khalifa, but she wished that her son Yazid would become Khalifa
 kaha jaataa he ki muawiyah ne hasan kii kisi patni ko uksaakar hasan ko zehar khilvaaya jis se hasan kii mrityu ho gai
 When Mu'awiyah died in 680, his son Yazid declared the eighth Khalifa
 ali ke dusre bete hossain ne yah maanane se inkaar kar diya
 On 10 October 680, the 'war of Karbala' took place in which Husain was beheaded
 phir unke 6 maheene kii umr ke bete ko maaraa gaya or unke parivaar kii striyon kaa apmaan kiya gaya
 Every year Shia people consider these incidents in Muharram as mourning
 muawiyah or yazid ke saath umayyad kilaafat shuru ho gai

 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 After this Sir Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the "inverse square law of gravity"
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The value of the force f acting between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravitational constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 maan lijie prithvi kii sanhati m he or iske dharaatal par m sanhati vaala koi pind padaa hua he
 If the Earth's body is to be condensed at its center and the radius of the Earth is r, then the attraction force acting by the body on that body: newton ke dwitiya gatinium ke anusaar kisi pind par laganevaala bal us pind kii sanhati tathaa twaran ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Thus, the force of gravity acting on a body falling freely under the influence of the attraction of the Earth: jahaan g us pind kaa gurutvajanit twaran he, at: That is, g = the force acting on the unit code of the body
 kintu sameekaran se Hence gravitational acceleration g is also often called the intensity of gravity of 'earth'
 newton dwaara gurutvkarshan ke niyam kaa pratipaadan hone ke baad hi gurutv niyatank g kaa maan gyaat karne kii samasya ne vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht kiya
 The reason for this was that it is one of the basic determinants of nature and is completely different from country, time and situation
 isliye ise saarvatrik niyatank kehete hai
 Also, it can also be related to the Code of the Earth
 at: prithvi kii sanhati evam ghanatv gyaat karne ke liye bhi iske maan ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This will be clear from the following deliberation: sameekaran or main tulana karne par But the amount of earth jahaan d prithvi kaa madhya ghanatv he
 g = g p r3 d / r2 = g pr d arthath G
 D
 = 3 g / It is clear from this formula that to find the value of one of the g or D, the value of the other must be known
 atev prithvi kaa ghanatv gyaat karne se purv g kaa thik maan gyaat kar sakane kii vidhiyon kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hona swaabhaavik hi tha
 We can divide the scientific efforts made to find the value of gravity constant in three categories: is vidhi kaa avlamban karanevaalon main bugar nevil meskeline airi tathaa phon sternek ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Its principle is summarized as follows: maan lijie m sanhati kaa koi pind prithvi dwaara aakarshith ho rahaa he
 It is obvious that this attraction force will be equal to the weight w of that body

 In 1740 AD, Booger conducted two types of experiments and tried to find the length of the second pendulum and the value of g at different heights
 ek sthaan to dakshini america ke piru naamak desh main quito naamak pathaar par chunaa
 For the difference in the altitudes of these two places, he revised the value of g obtained at sea level: for this he assumed that there was only air in between the two heights
 is prakaar gananaa dwaara pathaar ke liye praapt g ke maan or prayog dwaara praapt maan main 1 / 6983 gune kaa antar paaya
 Booger concluded that this difference was due to the attraction of the Bhupadartha contained in the 9400 feet high plateau
 is prayog ne yah sanket diya ki sampurna prithvi kaa aakarshan us pathaar ke aakarshan kaa 6983 guna he
 By calculating the attraction of the plateau, Booger estimated that the density of the Earth is 4

 If the quantities of the small and large bodies are m and m respectively and for the unit deflection, the force of the spasm of the wire is, then in the equilibrium state, the gravitational force of the wire is the spasm of the wire spasm

 In refrigeration devices operating on the principle of compression, or a motor of horsepower is employed to initiate the device's mechanism, by which condensation from a gaseous refrigerant-medium vaporizer such as sulfur dioxide or dichlorhydrofluor methane is induced into the coil

 The second type is the plasma valve, which performs its work when a large amount of refrigerant-fluid is collected inside the evaporator and only then the action cycle is repeated

 Then, as soon as the mixture of hydrogen and ammonia gas from the evaporator reaches the absorber cell, a fine spray of water is found in it
 isse ammonia gas to pani main ghul jaati he tathaa pani main aviley hydrogen vaashpitra main waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the ammonium hydroxide enters the evaporator and restores the action cycle
