 Behaviorism in psychology began in the first decade of the twentieth century by J
B
 By Watson in 1913 at John Hopkins University
 un dinon manovaigyanikon se maang kii ja rahi thi ki ve aatm-vishleshan kii takanic viksit karen
 Watson said that there is no need because a person's behavior is not based on his inner and personal feelings
 vah apane maahaul se nirdeshit hota he
 It is enough to observe a person's response to an external stimulus to find out the mental state
 watasan ke is sutrikaran ke baad vyavahaarwad america manovigyaan main pramukhataa praapt karata chalaa gaya
 Edward Hudry, Clark Hull and B
F
 Skinner gave a more sophisticated form to the theory of behaviorism
 in vidwaanon kii prerana se manochikitsakon ne vyavahaarmulak therapy kii vibhinn takneekein viksit kin taaki manorogiyon ko tarah-tarah kii bheeton or unmaadon se chhutkaaraa dilaayaa ja sake
 This community was founded by Watson in opposition to sects such as structuralism and functionalism
 yah skool apane kaal main adhik prabhaavshaalee rahaa jiske kaaran ise manovigyaan main 'dwitiya bal' ke rup main manyata mili
 Watson published a special title in Psychological Review in 1913 under the title "psychology in the Sight of the Practitioners"
 yaheen se vyavahaarwad kaa aupchaarik armbh mana jaataa he
 JV Watson pioneered revolutionary ideas in psychology through behaviorism
 watasan kaa mat tha ki manovigyaan kii vishay-vastu chetan yaa anubhuti nahin ho saktaa he
 Such behavior cannot be observed
 inkaa mat tha ki manovigyaan vyavhaar kaa vigyaan he
 Behavior can also be observed and measured
 unhone vyavhaar ke adhyayan kii vidhi ke rup main prekshan tathaa anubandhan ko mahatvapurn mana
 Watson adopted the method of literal report to study the behavior of human applications, which is almost the same as the internal inspection method
 watasan ne siikhnaa, samveg tathaa smriti ke kshetra main kuch prayogtmak adhyayan kiye jinaki upyogita tathaa manyata aaj bhi shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra main adhik he
 This positive aspect of behaviorism is called empirical behaviorism
 watasan ke vyavahaarwad kaa rinatmak pahalu vunt tathaa tichanar ke sanrachnawad ko tathaa angil ke prakaaryawad ko asweekrut karnaa tha
 In 1919, Watson explained the fundamental position of his behaviorism in which consciousness or the existence of mind was not accepted
 ise tathvik vyavahaarwad kaha gaya
 What Watson studied in the areas of learning, language development, thinking, memory and emotion is very important for education psychology
 watasan vyavhaar ko anuvanshik na maanakar paryaavarni balon dwaara nirdhaarit maanate the
 He was a prominent advocate of environmentalism
 unka kathan, "mujhe ek darjan swasth bachche den, aap jaisaa chahen main unako us rup main bana duungaa
 "this is a statement proving the usefulness of their environment
 watasan kaa maananaa tha ki maanav vyavhaar uddipak-anukriya sambandh ko ingit karata he
 Every behavior of an animal is a response to some kind of stimulant
 watasan ke baad bhi vyavahaarwad ko aage badhaane kaa prayaas jari rahaa or is silsile main hal skinar, taalman or gathri dwaara kiya gaya prayaas kaaphi saraahneey rahaa
 The research conducted by Skinner on functional contracting emphasizes the importance of reinforcement in turning and maintaining learning and behavior in a particular direction
 koi bhi vyavhaar jiske karne ke baad praani ko punarbalan miltaa he yaa uske sukhad parinaam vyakti main utpann hote he, to praani us vyavhaar ko phir dobaaraa karne kii ichha vyakt karata he
 Gathri told that among other things, effort is not required to learn and a person learns in a single effort
 ise unhone ikharaa prayaas siikhnaa kii sangyaan di
 Explaining this, Gathri said that a person learns a simple response such as holding a pencil, lighting a match, etc
 in a single effort
 iske liye use kisi abhyaas kii jarurat nahi hoti
 But to learn complex tasks, practice is required
 gathri ne ek or vishesh tathy par prakaash daalaa jo shiksha ke liye kaaphi laabhprad sabit hua or vah tha buree aadaton se kaise chhutkaaraa paaya jaae
 For this, Gathri proposed the following three methods - pi0 simond ne shikshan va adhigam ke kshetra main vyavahaarwad kii upyogita bataate huye kaha ki seekhney main puraskaar kii mahati bhoomika he, jisaki jaankaree ek adhyaaapak ke liye hona aavashyak he
 Reinforcement provided by the teacher serves as a direction in the implementation of the children's future activities
 adhyaaapak dwaara maatr sahi yaa galat kii sweekruti hi bachche ke liye puraskaar kaa kaary karti he
 Following is the contribution of behaviorism in the field of education - 7

 prithvi apni dhuree par 231⁄2° jhuke hue surya ke chakkar lagaati he, is prakaar varsh main ek baar prithvi is sthiti main hoti he, jab vah surya kii ore jhuki rahati he, va ek baar surya se duusari ore jhuki rahati he
 Similarly, a situation occurs twice a year when the earth is neither inclined towards the sun nor the other side of the sun, but in the middle

 In view of this definition in relation to the rise and setting or orbiting of the Sun on the Earth, equinox is the time in the orbit of a planet, in which the Sun in the orbit and specific position of the planet passes directly above the equator

 iske saath hi bumadhya rekha ke thik upar antariksh main ek kaalpanik akashiya rekha bhi hoti he
 At equinox, the sun is directly in the equator
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi koi vyakti bumadhya rekha par khadaa ho to surya use sidhe apane sir ke upar dikhaai degaa
 It also means that half the planet is fully illuminated and at this time the day and night are almost equal
 uttari dhruv par rahane vaale logon ke liye equinox ke agle chah maheene lagaataar din vaale hote hai jabaki dakshini dhruv ke logon ke liye chah maheene andheri raat vaale

 boul, andhon or pakshaaghaat se grast logon dwaara khelaa jaataa he
 Blind bowlers are very efficient

 In most opinion polls, Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf is ranked first and the nearest Pakistan Muslim League is ranked second
 pitiai ke paksh main or piemail ke khilaaf, chunaav parinaamon main dhokhadhadi karne ke liye nyaaypalika, sainya or khufia agenciyon ke upar chunaav matdaan purv aarope lagaae gaye hai
 According to preliminary, official results, Imran Khan's PTI was leading the election, although his opposition party, mainly PML-N, had alleged massive vote rigging and administrative misconduct
 pakistan ke chunaav ayog dwaara in aaropon ko spasht rup se asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 Later, Michael Gahler, Chief Supervisor of the European Union Election Supervision Mission, confirmed that the overall state of the general election was satisfactory
 28 july ko ginati ke samaapan par, chunaav ayog ne ghoshnaa kii ki pitiai ne 270 siton main se 116 siten jiti hai, piemail kul 64 siten, or pipipi 43 siten, jisamen 34 siten choti partiyon or 13 nirdaleey ummidavaaron dwaara jiti gai hai
 After the elections held in 2013, the Pakistan Muslim League, led by Pakistan's two-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, emerged as the largest party with 166 seats out of a total of 342 in the National Assembly
 yadhyapi yah bahumat se kam tha, phir bhi kai swatantra partiyon se gathbandhan ke baad sharif sarkaar banane main sakasham rahe
 During the election campaign, the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf led by prominent cricketer and politician Imran Khan was expected to make a big success in the election
 lekin party in apekshaaon main khari nahin utari, or use keval 35 siten hi praapt raheen
 It emerged as the third largest party in the National Assembly and formed a coalition government in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

 According to the ICIJ, Sharif's children Maryam Nawaz, Hasan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz were the "owners" of these companies or had the authority to authorize transactions for several companies
 sharif ne istipha dene se inkaar kar diya
 Instead, he attempted to form a judicial commission
 haalanki, aisa nahin kiya gaya tha, jiske baad vipakshi netaa imran khan ne 29 agast ko pakistan ke sarvocch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kar, premiership or rashtriya vidhansabha ke sadsy pad se sharif ke ayogyata kii maang kii

 khan ne ek baar phir, apane samarthakon ko islamabad kaa gheraav karne kaa aavahan kiya, jab tak sharif istipha na de de, haalanki unhone baad main aavahan radd kar diya
 On 20 April 2017, with a 3–2 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled against Sharif's disqualification: instead he formed a Joint Investigation Team, which would investigate these allegations
 10 july 2017 ko, jeiti ne sarvocch nyaayalay main 275 pej kii report prastut kii
 The report requested NAB to file a complaint against Sharif, his daughter Maryam and his sons under Section 9 of the National Accountability Ordinance

 On 28 July 2017, following the presentation of the JIT report, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Sharif was dishonest, therefore not meeting the requirements of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution for which 'sadiq and Amin' holding public office is needed
 
 Therefore, he was disqualified as Prime Minister and member of the National Assembly
 adaalat ne rashtriya uttardaayitv beuro ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon par sharif, unke parivaar or unke purv vittamantri ishaak daar ke khilaaf ek shikaayat darj karne kaa bhi aadesh diya

 yah dal udaarataavaad ke siddhant par kaam karata he or canada ke raajnneetik halkon main saamanyat: centre vaale dal ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Historically, the Liberals have been ranked to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party
 The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 69 years in the 20th century—more than any other party in a developed country—and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's "natural governing party"
 The party's signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, restoring balanced budgets in the 1990s, and making same-sex marriage legal nationwide
 During the beginning of the 21st century, the party lost a significant amount of support, to the benefit of both the Conservatives and the NDP
 In the 2011 federal election, the Liberals had the worst showing in its history, capturing only 19 percent of the popular vote and 34 seats — becoming the third-place party in the House of Commons for the first time
 In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2000 election, winning 39
5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, thus regaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons

 The Paris Commune of 1871 was a revolutionary movement whose main importance lies in the efforts of the proletariat of Paris to free themselves from the communal hegemony of France
 san 1793 i

 On 2 September 1870, the political circumstances resulting from the defeat of the Third Napoleon further aggravated the conflict between Paris and feudal France

 But even after the passage of the month, when the enclosure was not removed, the people of Paris, distraught with hunger and cold, started discussing Levi and Mas in the monopolistic Paris
 sitambar main hi nai sarkaar ke paas swaittshasit commune kii sthapana kii maang bhej di gai thi
 Here, the powers of the proletariat of Paris were also increased as a result of the organization of new military groups, recruitment of people of the working class and the right to nominate their officers to meet the requirements of war

 On 28 January, the German Army and the Government of National Security signed an agreement to postpone the war for a short period of time with the aim of allowing France to elect a national parliament that would decide on peace or continuation of the war
 parantu samantshahi france kii bhaawanaaon kaa pratinidhaan karne vaali is sansad ne sarvhaara varg ko or adhik cruddh kiya
 He not only accepted the end of the war in expensive prices, but also insulted the Parisians by moving to the capital of France, Varsai, and passed some resolutions which were fatal to the interests of the Parisians

 As a result, many leaders of the government side were called and the rest fled to Warsai and took refuge

 The revolution of 18 March was not only against the national security government and the same parliament, but against the entire system of centralization due to which not only the local administration was controlled by the central authority, but the reactionary government charged by the provinces of Paris and other big cities social and Political development was blocked
 krantikariyon ke anusaar in sabakaa keval ek upachaar tha : kendriya satta ke kaaryon ko nunatam karnaa taaki sthaneey sanghathanon ko na keval apane prabandh ke liye varan apane samaaj ke sampurna sanghathan evam vikaas ke liye bhi sarvaadhik sambhavit shaktiyaan praapt ho saken; duusare shabdon main, france kii swashasit communon ke sangh main badalanaa
 According to the manifesto of the Paris Commune published on 19 April, the commune had the rights - passing the budget; Fix tax; Directing local business; Organization of Police, Education and Courts; Managing the property of the commune; Election, control and removal of all officers; Permanent protection of personal freedom; Organization of civil defense etc
 is drushti se yah adhikaarptr aise samaajwaad kii ghoshnaa karata he jo puure andolan kaa vaastavik aadhaar he
 The commune doctrine was fully formulated in the interests of Paris, Lyon and one or two other large cities and therefore could not apply in most of France
 iske peeche yah vichaar tha ki graamon ke krishak tathaa chote nagaron ke nivasee abhi itane yogya nahin hai ki ve apana saamaanya sthaneey prabandh bhi swayan kar saken
 Therefore, they cannot be immediately entrusted with the responsibility of finance, police, education and general social development
 isse spasht he ki france par paris kaa aadhipaty krantikariyon ke kam se kam ek bhaag kaa uddeshy avashya tha; duusare commune siddhant main pranrabh se hi ek antarvirodh vidyaman tha
 This doctrine declared the autonomous provinces of Paris and Anru progressive cities free from the control of non-state provinces and declared them local autonomous, but the provinces were not progressive enough to accept this principle, as described in the preamble of the doctrine itself
 falat: unhen is andolan main sammilit hone ke liye paris kii adheenta sweekaar kerani padi
 In other words, it was imperative for the establishment of the commune doctrine to be destroyed first

 From the beginning, the commune had announced the adoption of socialist principles; But in practice, it was impossible to get a revolutionary economic organization done in a short period of two months for a government which had spent almost all its powers mainly in destroying its enemy
 commune ne saidhantik rup se sthaneey swaittashasan ko sweekaar kiya tha, parantu vyavhaar main uski pravriti samast france par paris kii sarkaar aropit karnaa tha
 For example, in April, the Paris Commune considered independence as the first principle of the French Republic and accepted that the budget for religious opinions was contrary to this principle because it obliged citizens to provide financial assistance to propagate the religious faith that their Is not, and considering that the Pope has been instrumental in the crimes committed by the monarchy against the ideal of freedom, or Order should be issued that are separated from the church and the state declared the property of the Orthodox monasteries of property country

 The main reason for the commune's short life and its failure to translate administrative and economic reforms into action was the lack of leaders who could determine the interconnected and creative programs of the various elements

 Nevertheless, this revolution of March 18 was accepted by the then socialist organizations as a proletarian class revolution for the socialist ideal and thus commune theory became a part of socialist philosophy
 isamen andeh nahin ki commune siddhant ne vargsangharsh evam samaajawaadee vichaardhaara ke prachaar main yathesht yoga diya
 The spirit of readiness, valor and sacrifice with which the Paris Commune took a 'barricade' on the streets of Paris from the foreign conquerors and the French traitors they met, inch by inch, has become immortal in indigenous wars

 Siddhartha's father was Shuddhodana, the king of the Shakyas
 paramparaagat katha ke anusaar, siddharth kii mata mahamaya unke janm ke kuch der baad mar gayi thi
 It is said that 8 sages were invited to name him, all told 2 possibilities, they will become a great king, they will become a monk or parivrajaka
 is bhavishya vaani ko sunakar raja shuddhodan ne apni yogyata kii had tak siddharth ko sadhu na banane dene kii bahut koshishen kii
 The Shakyas had their own union
 bees varsh kii aayu hone par har shakya tarun ko shakyasang main dikshit hokar sangh kaa sadsy bananaa hota tha
 When Siddhartha Gautam was twenty years old, he too joined the membership of Shakyasangh and according to the rules of Shakya Sangha, Siddhartha had spent eight years as a member of Shakya Sangha
 ve sangh ke atyant samarpit or pakke sadsy the
 He was very interested in the affairs of the Union
 sangh ke sadsy ke rup main unka aacharan ek udhaaharan tha or unhone swayan ko sabakaa priy bana liya tha
 In the eighth year of the membership of the Sangh, an incident occurred which became tragic for Shuddhodan's family and a critical situation was created in the life of Siddhartha
 shaakyon ke rajya kii seemaa se sata hua coliyon kaa rajya tha
 The Rohini River was the dividing line of the two states
 shakya or coliya donon hi rohinee nadi ke pani se apane-apane khet sinchate the
 They used to dispute between each crop on who would use Rohini's water first and how much
 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat
 ve ek pipal ke ped ke neeche baith gayi pratigya karke ki ve satya jane bina uthenge nahin
 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha

 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3

 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists

 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he

 Madhavacharya was the pioneer of his time in many ways, he has gone against the prevalent practices many times
 unhone dwait darshan kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He wrote a commentary on the Brahmasutra of Dvaita philosophy and also wrote an independent text 'anuvayakhyana' for logical confirmation of the lecture of his Vedanta

 He received his education from Acharya, a follower of Shankara Matha, Achutpreksh, and after making a discussion with the Guru, he formed his own separate opinion, which is called "dvaita darshan"

 Mr
 Madhwacharya studied the 'panch Bhide', which is also called the 'extreme Bhed Darshanam'
 uski paanch visheshtayen hai : Classification of the 'utmost bhed darshanam' in substance form has also been done in this way: swatantra vah he jo purna roopen swatantra he
 Which is God or eternal truth
 lekin jeevatma or jagat bhagwaan par ashrith hai
 That's why God controls them
 paramatma swatantra hai
 Therefore their classification is impossible
 ashrith tatva sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak rup main vibhajit kiye jate hai
 Positives can also be classified into conscious and unconscious

 We can find Vishnu in many forms of arithmetic and avatars

 He is beyond suffering

 According to him Vishnu is the doer of the material world
 bhagwaan prakruti ko lakshmi dwaara shashakt banaate hai or use drishy jagat main parivartit karte hai
 Nature is the physical cause of physical objects, bodies and organs
 prakruti ke teen pahaluon se teen shaktiyaan aavirbhoot hai : lakshmi, bhu or durga
 Avidya is also a form of nature that hides the divine from the soul
 madhwacharya ji kaa vishwaas he ki prakruti se bani dharti maaya nahin, balki paramatma se pruthak satya he
 It is not the same change as the curd hidden in milk, nor the form of God
 isliye yah avishesh dwaitvaad hi he
 Madhvacharya accepted Ramanujacharya's classification of souls
 jaise :-- Madhvacharya added two more classes with him which is worthy of salvation and which is not worthy of salvation: is vargeekaran ke anusaar jeevatma kaa ek alag astitv he
 Thus one soul is different from another soul
 iskaa arthatma anek hai
 The Jeevatma is dependent on the divine instructions from God and being different from nature
 unke pichley janmon ke aadhaar par paramatma unhen prerit karte hai
 According to the previous deeds, the living beings suffer, due to which their soul becomes pure and freed from life and death and experiences the joy which is the spontaneity of the soul
 anandanubhuti main jeevatma bhinn hoti he
 But there is no disharmony in them and they become holy and attain Parabrahma
 lekin ve paramatma ke baraabar nahin ho saktin
 They become worthy of serving God

 vimaa se nimnlikhit kaa bodh ho saktaa he- Arthur Schopenhaver was a famous philosopher from Germany
 ve apane 'naastik nirashavad' ke darshan ke liye prasiddh hai
 At the age of 25, he presented his paper, The Four Roots of Reasoning Reasoning, in which it was meticulously that only logic can cover the deep mysteries of the world? Like Buddhist philosophy, Schopenhaver also stressed the need for mitigation of Ichhaas
 shopenhavar kaa kahana tha ki ve upanishdon, cont evam plato se prabhavit the
 Indian philosophy appears repeatedly in Schopenhaver's writings
 ve buddha kii shikshaaon ko maanate the or swayan ko baudhdhadharmi kehete unka yahan tak kahana tha ki yadi ye shikshaayen nahin hotin to unka darshan bhi nahin hota
 Regarding the Upanishads, he said - "in my life there has been peace from the Upanishads; from them i will get peace even at the time of death
" " Schopenhaver's analysis of desire and consideration of his human will and motivations influenced famous philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Ludwig Wittingstein and Samuel Freud
 unke pashchavarti vichaarkon par unka gaharaa prabhaav padaa, yadhyapi yah prabhaav darshan kii apeksha kala ke kshetra main zyada he
 Schopenhaver read a Latin translation of the Upanishads which were translated from sire-akbar in Persian by Dara Shikoh by the French writer Anketil du Peron
 vah upanishdon ke darshan se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone kaha ki upanishdon ne maanav kaa sarvocch gyaan utpann kiya he
 It is the most satisfying and elevating reading which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death
 opnikhat naamak pustak sadaa unki mej par padi rahati thi or sone ke pehle ve use jarur padhte the
 He called Sanskrit literature the best gift of his century
 unhone bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki upanishdon kaa gyaan or darshan hi pashchim kaa dharm ban jaayegaa
 Due to his philosophy, Schopenhauer became very sensitive to the rights of animals

 Archaeological research and excavations have seen the ruins of Crete, Mycenae and the Triad city of Minoritya, which are considered contemporaries of Egyptian, Sumeri and Sandhav civilization
 vahaan kii sabhyataa unheen sabhyataaon kii bhanti kaansyayugin thi, louhayug kii purvavarti
 The ruins of the palaces and buildings have been found in all these places
 kritiya sabhyataa kaa pracheenatam centre or us rajya kii rajdhani greece ke dakshin ke us dweep ke uttari tat par basaa knosus tha
 The ruins of the palace of Knossus reveal that it was inhabited by prosperity and had large halls ornamented with lavish frescoes and serpentine steps leading to the upper floors
 snanagaron or anya kamaron main nal lage the jinamein nirantar jal pravaahit hota rahata tha
 This civilization is also called Mykini because of its Minos title kings belonging to the city of 'minoi' or Mykini

 While the basis of that civilization is the local stone age civilization, archaeologists speculate that the blood and language of its creators was related to the Western Basques on the one hand, the Berbers and the ancient Egyptians on the other
 unke mixriyon sareekhe kativesan tathaa shesh bhaag kii nagnata se panditon kaa anumaan he ki ve sambhavat: misr se hi jaakar kriit dweep main bas gaye the
 This inference is also partially confirmed by the account of the illustrious Egyptian sailor written in the paintings
 kriit ke un pracheen nivaasiyon kaa uttar kii europea shwet jatiyon se kisi prakaar kaa raktasambandh parilakshith nahin hota
 First the Christians used pure metal, copper, etc
, then mixed metal bronze, which was made from a mixture of copper and tin
 yah tin bharat se jaataa tha jahaan uske sanskrit naam 'bang' se bengal prasiddh hua
 From there, this mixed bronze also went to Babylon and Egypt
 ijian sabhyataa main lipi kaa bhi prayog hota tha par bhartiya saindhav lipi kii hi bhanti vah bhi abhi tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 If we read this, then a deeper mystery of that civilization will be revealed
 is sabhyataa ke prakaashan kaa shrey puratathvik vigyaan ke janak shliman or sar arthur evans ko he
 Schleiman excavated the trilogy described in Homer's epic 'iliad', and Evans then dug up Knossus to save the palaces of Minos
 sar arthur ne ijian sabhyataa ko nau staron main vibhajit kiya he--pracheen minoi yug, madhya minoi yug, uttar minoi yug
 Then each of them has its own three three-first, second and third-yugas
 misri sabhyataa ke staron se milan karke is sabhyataa ke yugon kii unase samasamyikta or bhi pusht kar lee gai he
 It seems, 1400 BC Nearly this great and prosperous civil civilization came to an end when the fierce attacks and earthquakes of the Asiatic Greeks ended it together
 pracheen or madhya minoi yugon main dhaatuon kaa upyog prabhoot maatra main hua
 Daggers and swords were made of bronze and copper

 Gold and silver utensils are also found in the excavations
 mitti ke bartan banate avashya the, parantu unki kaaya adhiktar dhaatu ke bartanon kii nakal main hi sirji jaati thi
 The art of pottery itself was of a high standard
 ijian dwipon main kriit ne sabase pehle bhaandon ko chitrit karnaa shuru kiya
 The second distinct progress took place in the first phase of the Minoi era, in which different types of buffalo began to be made
 suraahiyaan tontidaar yaa chonchnuma banane lageen, phir unamem atyant aakarshak damakham die jane lage
 Then in the next ancient era, there was a flood of rotting sheep

 Schleiman has dug out six mini-triads in a miniature Asia
 pracheen minoi sabhyataa ke tritiy charan ke samanaantar pramaan traay kii khudaayiyon main mili hai
 There are also found items made of precious metals - gold pins and chains, gold and silver utensils, from which the archaeologists have aptly given the name 'treasury of Priyam'
 vahaan ke bartanon main pradhan kaale rang ke or ulukashirsh hai
 Similarly, scattered symbols, artistic utensils etc
 of the same civilization have also been found in the islands under Crete and Tri
 vahaan bhi shavsamadhiyon kii style pradhan sabhyataa ke anuroop he
 The style of statues buried in the cremation grounds of Kriti and these islands is often the same as that of the Egyptian tombs
 pracheen minoi yug ke antim charan kii visheshta pathar kii korkar banaai vastuon main he
 The flowers cut in stone and the motives of sea creatures were used in the art of the time
 inke nirmaan main pradhanat: sangemarmar yaa chuunaa mitti kaa upyog hua he
 As far as metal utensils are concerned, it seems that the goldsmiths of the triad imitated the Babuli metallurgy
 vahi digine baad main pathar or mitti ke bartanon par baniin
 Egypt also used the same style over time
 bartanon kaa itnaa aakarshak nirmaan us pracheen kaal ke do avishkaron kaa vismayakaarak parinaam tha
 Certainly those inventions have extraordinary significance in the history of buffalo art

 It was probably invented in the east, in Elam, or in the Indus Valley of India, or both, probably in 4,000 BC

 The ruins of the stone houses preceding the palaces of Knoosus are of the same era
 minoi raajaaon kii rajdhani kriit ke uttari tat par based knosus main thi
 In the Middle Minoi era the Minos kings often took control of the entire Crete and adjacent islands

 Fistus is described as a colony in folk traditions and rituals

 The northern palaces of Quossus and the southern palaces of Phaistas were built around the same time
 kriit ke dakshini tat par fistas ke mehalon ke khandhar hai or unke paas hi aagia triyada ke rajaprasaad ke bhagnavshesh bhi hai, yadhyapi ve bane uttar-minoi-yug main the
 It seems that the palaces of Knossus had been built for ages and changed as needed
 raajaaon kii badhati hui samruddhi, kala kii pragati or suruchi ke parishkar ke anukool samay samay par unamem parivartan hote gaye
 Such changes took place in some medieval times also, but in the previous era, the form of these palaces were changed
 jis rup main unke khandhar aaj puraavidon ke prayatnon se prastut hue hai unase pragat he ki in mehalon main asaadhaaran bade bade haal the, ghumaavdaar sopanmarg the, dhalaan par utaranevaale lambey kaksh the or bahari prasaad se sanlagn bhawan the-or phir dur, kriti sabhyataa kaa naagarik vistaar pashchim ke parvaton ke upar tak chalaa gaya tha
 The Principal Rajprasad looks very modern with its high level of living facilities

 The Egyptian pharaohs and the Periklizian Athens had no houses of theirs
 haan, yadi prasadanirmaan kii shaleenta main iskaa koi paraabhav kar saktaa he to ve nineve ke asurabanipal ke sachitr prasaad hai
 Yet there is a great difference between the two
 jahaan asurabanipal ke mahal suune hai or thande tathaa jaadon ke liye asuvidhajanak lagate hai vahaan minoi rajaprasaad garam or aaraamdeh hai or unki chitrit deevaaron se lagata he ki unamem bharaapura jivan lehren martha tha
 His frescoes reveal that the king's court was full of the palaces of Knoosus, and there were large numbers of male and female attendants
 raja or uske darbari sabhi prasann or jivan ko nirbadh bhogate hue chitrit hue hai
 The shapes of the paintings have become rigid and stilted at times, some are even vulgar, but their lines are very strong
 unke khaake nishchay asaadhaaran kalavanton ne khinche honge
 It is evidenced by the frescoes that women used to participate in the pleasure of the court with the same freedom as men
 nar or nari donon samaan adhikaar se saamaajik jivan main bhaag lete the or prathit to aisa hota he ki rajmahal or samaaj ke jivan main nari kaa hi prabhutv adhik tha
 There is no doubt that in that ancient world, the rights given to the woman by the civilization of Crete, the concurrent place of the man was given to her was not possible anywhere else in her life
 bhittichitron main nari kii twachaa shwet or purush kii raktim chitrit hui he, praaia: misri reeti ke anusaar
 The court beard kept the face clean with a mustache and long hair, which he used to decorate in the same way as the women
 anek baar to saandon kii ladaai dekhte ladakon main ladakiyon kaa pahchaanana kathin ho jaataa he or yadi unki twachaa rudhigat rangon se spasht na kar di gai hoti to donon kaa darshan nitant samaan hota
 There was no curtain in the women, this is allowed by the painted scenes of that period, anyway, the shapes of the women sitting without veil in the windows give light to their unorganized condition
 naariyaan gardan or baahuon ko niraavrit rakhti thim, haaron se dhak leti thim, vastra kati par kas leti thim or neeche apane ghaghare kii chunten kii chunten aakarshak rup se pairon par gira leti thim
 In the paintings of the bygone era, the women, at least of the palace, are also wearing kirits on the forehead
 purushon kaa vesh unase bhinn tha, atyant saadhaaran
 They wore panties down to the waist, like tahmatis at times to the knees of the men of the Egyptian paintings, but were enchanted by the use of colors
 misri purushon kii bhanti unke sharir kaa urdhvardh nanga rahata tha or jab tab ve kondaar topi pahante the
 Men's hairs were tied or dangled up to the waist or when they tied a knot above the head
 knosus ke purush bhi pichley yug ke khattiyon kii bhanti pairon main unchi sandels yaa boot pahante the
 The look of the Naranaris of the Minoi civilization was often similar to that of the present day Italians
 unke netra or kesh kaale the, naariyon kaa rang sambhavat: dhoomilashwet or purushon kaa chatkh tamra
 Life was happy, happy and happy

 But they probably had little means of defense, at least not in armor excavations
 talwaar kaa upyog ve nishchay karte the
 In the life of Amod, naturally, the rigid stereotypes of religion could not terrorize the society and they were also lacking in Minoi society
 parantu unke devtaa the, yadhyapi unako spashtat: pahchaan paanaa kathin he
 Yet it can be clearly said that people believed in deities related to trees, rocks, rivers etc
 and they did at least worship the mother of at least one specific serpent
 is prakaar kii matrudevi kii akritiyaan jo sarp dhaaran karti hai vahaan chitrit mili hai
 It is evident from the frescoes of the palaces that the painting was developed especially by the Kalavantas and the predominance of colors in them also gives the impression of a technique
 pathar ko korkar murti banane athwa uski prishthbhumi se ubharkar drishy likhane kii kala ne ni:andeh asian deshon ke anupaat main prashray nahin paaya tha or unki uplabdhi atyant nune sankhya main hui he
 Some of the engraved scenes found from Agia Triada are certainly such that even today, Kalaparkhi would not be able to remain admired

 He spread his empire over the surrounding seas and islands, and also his empire over Greece and Minor Asia where he built his colonies around the cities of Micini, Tri, etc
 parantu sambhavat: samrajyanirmaan unke boote kaa na tha or unhone us praytn main apane aapako hi nasht kar diya
 It is true that their income increased as they occupied the land area of greece, but the maintenance of the colonies themselves was a task of great labor, which could not be possible for them to sustain
 parinamat: jab baahar se akramanakari aae tab amodapriy minoi naagarik unki choton kaa safal uttar na de sake or unhen aatmasamarpan karnaa padaa
 But this passive surrender was not accepted by the conquerors and they killed it only by destroying it
 yah kahana kathin he ki ye akramanakari koun the
 There are many opinions of scholars in this regard
 kuch unhen mul greek maanate hai, kuch asian, kuch dorian, kuch khatti, kuch anatolia ke nivasee
 But almost all of them, at least in part, believe that the Akrantas were of the Aryan race and probably came from the north who destroyed their Minoan enemies and settled in their own settlements

 The story of Homer has a direct connection with the destruction of the city of Troy, the Aegean colony of Asia, and it would not be inappropriate to point it here

 Not surprisingly, the Ekian castes have destroyed the Aegean civilization
 parantu ekian jatiyon ke baad bhi lagaataar uttar se aanevaali arya greek jatiyon ke akraman greece par hote rahe
 Among those castes, there was a distinct Dorian caste that probably dated to the 12th century BC
