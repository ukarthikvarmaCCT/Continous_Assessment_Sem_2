 pramod muthalik shri ram sena namak hinduvadi sanghathan ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 Born in Bagalkot in north Karnataka, Muthalik spent his early days with the Hindu right-wing organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 He started going to the branch from the age of 13
 1996 main aresas main unke varishtho ne muthalik ko apane sahyogi sanghathan bajrang dal main bhej diya
 It took Muthalik less than a year for the party to become the convener of South India
 muthalik ko jaanane vaale inhen mahatvakankshi, samarpit or tikhaa vaktaa kehete hai
 In his 23-year association with the RSS and its other organizations, Muthalik has been confronted with the law several times and has been jailed several times due to accusations of making inflammatory speeches

 With reference to this picture- atah, For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use
 As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed
 Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit
 Also for given circuit, Therefore, The common-emitter current gain of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor
 It is denoted as β on this page
 Therefore we can obtain Ic as well
 In this manner, operating point given as can be set for given transistor
 Benefit: alaabh: Use: Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits 
 Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch
 However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage
 This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point
 In this form of biasing, the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source v cc { \ displaystyle v _ { \ text {cc}}} 
 So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the RC { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {C}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage v r b { \ displaystyle V_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} is By the Ebers – Moll model, i c = β i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}} = \ beta i _ { \ text {b}}}, and so From Ohm's law, the base current i b = v r b / r b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}=v_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b}}} / R_{ \ text{b}}}, and so Hence, the base current i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}}} is If v be { \ displaystyle V_{ \ text{be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} increases
 However, a larger i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor r c { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage v r b { \ displaystyle V_{{ \ text{r}}_{ \ text{b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} 
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}}, which results in less collector current i c { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}} 
 Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable
 Benefit: alaabh: which is the case when upyog:the negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous
due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted
 The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter
 This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is From Ohm's law, the base current is The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows
 If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases
 However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = iere, which in turn reduces the voltage vrb across the base resistor
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β Ib
 Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable
 Similarly, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic 
 By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable
 For the given circuit, Advantages: The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and β-value
 Disadvantages: which is approximately the case if upyog: The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved
 collector-stabilized Biasing The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2
 The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction
 By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β
 In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is larger than the base current
 However, even with a fixed base voltage, the collector current varies with temperature so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor
 The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns
 By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much
 In this circuit the base voltage is given by: VB = { \ displaystyle V_ {B} = \ } voltage across r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {2} \ } = v cc r 2 - i b r 1 r 2 { \ displaystyle = V_ {cc} { \ frac {R_ {2}} {}} - I_ {b} { \ frac {R_ {1} R_ {2}} {}}} Also v b = v b e + i e r e { \ displaystyle v_{b}=v_{be}+i_{e}r_{e} \ } For the given circuit, laabh: Advantage: which is approximately the case if where R1 || R2 denotes the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 connected in parallel
 upyog: The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits
 The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback – AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain
 This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram
 The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the ac-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of r c / r e { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}} / R_{ \ text{e}}} without the capacitor
 When a split supply is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load
 The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re
 The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse-bias the collector junction
 Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage
 We know that, Vb - Ve = Vbe If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero
 Therefore, emitter current is, Ie = / Re The operating point is independent of β if Re >> Rb / β Advantages: Disadvantages: This type can only be used when a split power supply is available
 Class b and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow
 Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal
 Class b bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just conducting 
 class-ab bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1 / 4 of maximum possible value
the class-ab push–pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier
 Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices
 The output pair are arranged in class-ab push – pull, also called a complementary pair
 The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized
 That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-ab mode
 This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond
 The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors
 If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage
 a common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so
 Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier

 According to the Shakta devotees "there is an explanation of a truth contained in the ten forms - Mahavidya" which explains the ten cosmic personalities of Jagadamba
 mahavidhyaayein tantrik prakruti kii maani jaati hai jo nimna hai- Shakta Darshan associates ten Mahavidyas with the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu and explains that Mahavidyas are the sources from which the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu originated
 mahavidhyaon ke ye dason rup chaahe ve bhayanak hon athwa saumy, jagajjanani ke rup main puuje jate hai
 According to Sri Devi Bhagwat Purana, the Mahavidyas originated due to a dispute between Lord Shiva and his consort Sati, who was the former birth of Parvati
 jab shiv or sati kaa vivaah hua to sati ke pita daksh prajapati donon ke vivaah se khush nahin the
 He organized a huge yagna for the purpose of insulting Shiva, in which he invited all the gods and goddesses, but in spite of this he did not invite his son, Lord Shankar and his daughter Sati
 sati, pita ke dwaara yojit yajna main jane kii jid karne lageen jise shiv ne ansuna kar diya, is par sati ne swayan ko ek bhayanak rup main parivartit kar liya
 Seeing which Lord Shiva was determined to run away

 This causes all three valves to swell and close with blood pressure, which does not reverse the direction of blood circulation and the blood cannot return from the aorta to the left ventricle
 haan, kapaticaon main jab rog ke kaaran shoth aadi utpann ho jaataa he, us dasha main valve thik kaary nahin karte tathaa unka mukh khulaa rah jane se raktasanchaaran vipareet disha main hota he
 This causes the blood to re-enter the left ventricle from the aorta, due to which the blood circulation becomes distorted and disease starts to occur

 is par tapasvi ne kaha ki bas yah shart puri honi chahie
 Whether he is asking for his hand or for another, it does not matter
 usne raja ko vishwaas dilaane kii koshish kii ki is rajkumaari ko kunari hi rahanaa padegaa
 When Vikram told him that he himself was ready to jump into a bitter for this young man, the ascetic's face was open with awe
 ve baat hi kar rahe the ki rajkumaari apni saheliyon ke saath vahaan ai
 She was actually more beautiful than Apsaras
 agar yuvakon ne khaulate kadaah main kudakar praan ganvaae, to koi galat kaam nahin kiya
 Vikram asked the ascetic to arrange a bitter oil
 jab tel ekadam khaulane laga, to maan kaali ko samaran kar vikram tel main kud gaye
 As soon as he jumped in the boiling oil, his life went out and the body roasted and became dark
 maan kaali ko un par dayaa aa gai or unhone betaalon ko vikram ko jivit karne kii ajna di
 The hospitals put drops of nectar in their mouth and brought them to life
 jivit hote hi unhone vasu ke liye rajkumaari kaa haath maanga

 In law, a lien or lien is a type of approval of an interest protection to secure payment in exchange for a debt refinance or discharge of any other liability in lieu of an asset
 sampatti kaa maalik, jo lian yaa grahanadhikaar pradaan karata he, ko lianor or jis vyakti ko lian kaa laabh miltaa he use liyani kaha jaataa he
 The anglo-french lien, Loyen "bond", "restrant", from the Latin ligamen, the word "to bind" from the ligare is the origin of the etymology
 sanyukt rajya america main, shabd lian aamtaur par shulk bhaar kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ko darshata he or isamen anya prakaar ke bandhak yaa shulk shaamil hote hai
 In the United States, lien is singularly referred to non-proprietary security interests or interest securities
 anya samaan kanoon vaale deshon main, lian shabd ek bahut hi vishesh prakaar ke byaji pratibhuti ke liye sanderbhit he; iske tahat karj yaa anya daayitv se mukt hone tak sampatti par pratidhaaran kaa niskriy adhikaar praapt hota he
 In other countries there is a purely self-interest form of securities interest; In contrast, in the USA, the term is definitely used when the property is not intrusive and then the lien is released
 haalanki, samaan kanoonvaale deshon main isaki pahchaan pratibhuti vyaaj ke jaraa asangat prakaar ke rup main bhi kii jaati he, "nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar" kehalaata he, jo kuch durlabh maamalon main saamne aata he
 Despite the differences in terminology and its implementation, there are a number of similarities between the various liens in the USA and countries with common law
 grahanadhikaar sahmatijnya yaa asahmatijnya ho sakate hai ; sahmatijnya grahanadhikaar rindaata or rini ke bich ek anubandh dwaara lagaaya jaataa he: Non-consensual lien arises exclusively by act or by proceeding with similar law
 ve kanoon rindaata tathaa rini ke bich ke sambandh ke banaaye rakhane ke dwaara rindaata ko sthavar sampada athwa chal-sampatti ke mad par grahanadhikaar adhiropit karne kaa adhikaar dete hai
 Those liens include liens "doshahin" yaa "doshapurn" bhi hote hai 
 doshahin liens wo liens hote hai jinke liye ek rindaata tisare paksh ke rindaataaon kaa sammaan karte hue rinbhargrast sampatti par ek praathamikta adhikaar sthapit karata he
 Completeness is certified by taking the steps required by law, usually by sending the lien notice to the third party
 asal baat yah he ki sampatti kii ek cheez yaa ansh rindaata ke haathon main ho to aamtaur par purnataa sthapit ho jaati he
 When the property remains in the hands of the debtor, then some action should be taken, such as recording of the notice of interest security in the appropriate office
 kisi lian kii purnataa sampatti main rindaata ke hit ko surakshit karne ke kaam kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he
 The flawless lien is valid for the real purchaser of the property and even in the case of a bankrupt trustee, while the defective lien may not
 sanyukt rajya america main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar vah adhikaar he jo keval equity par hi lagu hota he or jo bagaiyr kosh athwa sampitt par kabja kiye kisi kosh vishesh athwa kisi khaas sampatti kii maang ko puraa karata he
 In US law, such lien arises specifically under four circumstances: USA ke baahar, ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ko saamaanya shabdon main kanoon dwaara pradutt chal sampatti ko roke rahane ke niskriy adhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Modern law usually waives a legal lien when a case is historically established without any real effort to enforce in modern circumstances
 tappenden banaam arts 2 QB 185 diplock LJ main ek "swayan seva" upaay kaa lian sanderbhit he, jaise ki "updrav kii samaapti, aatm-suraksha yaa atikaramiyon ko jameen se baahar nikaalane jaise anya puraane upaay"
 nyaaysangat liens sampatti ke adhikaar kaa ek asaamaanya prakaar hai, jinhen aamtaur par sui genaris mana jaataa he
 Special lien and general lien are divided into a common law lien
 a special lien, which is of a very common type, requires a close relationship between the property and the service rendered
 tatkaal lenden se sambandhit fees ke sambandh main keval ek vishesh lian yaa grahanadhikaar kaa hi prayog kiya ja saktaa he; saath hi puraane rinon kii pratibhuti ke rup main roak rakhi gayi sampatti kaa prayog liyani yaa rini nahin kar saktaa
 ek saamaanya grahanadhikaar rini kii un sabhi sampatti par prabhaav daalata he jo rindaata ke kabje main he or rini ko rindaata dwaara die gaye sabhi karj kii suraksha kii guarantee karata he
 a special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract and is usually done in the case of carriers
 ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar sirf pratidhaaran kaa ek niskriy adhikaar hi detaa he; samaan kanoon main bikri karne kaa adhikaar nahin hota he, haalanki kuch pariniyamon main bikri karne ke atirikt adhikaar bhi pradutt hote hai, or anubandh ke jariye ek alag adhikaar pradutt karnaa sambhav he
 Similar law liens closely align with so-called "common callings", but are not co-extensive
 ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ek bahut hi simit prakaar kaa pratibhuti byaaj he
 a lien cannot be transferred, despite the fact that it gives only passive rights of possession; It cannot be asserted by any third party, who has the goods in possession, for services which should be done by the original party; And if the movable property is surrendered to the lender, the entitlement of the lien ceases forever
 Any debtor who illegally sells the movable property may be responsible for the conversion, as well as the surrender of the lien
 samaan kanoon vaale deshon main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar yaa equitable liens ne anuthe or kathin muddon main vruddhi kii he
 An equitable lien is a non-possessive security right conferred by the proceeding of law, which in effect is similar to an equitable charge
 yah kisi charge se alag hota he tab yah gaiyr sahmati-janya he
 It is given in very limited circumstances, the most common of which is in relation to the sale of land; An impregnated seller has an equitable lien on the land for the purchase price, even if the purchaser has occupied the property
 This is seen as a counter-charge to the Aquitable Rule, which confers a beneficial interest on the land to the buyer after exchange of contracts for purchase
 yah anumaan kii baat he ki abhukt vikreta grahanadhikaar ke baahar nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kaa kitna vistaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In many cases involving active things, an equitable lien has been withheld, but not yet in relation to movable property
 Australian courts are most receptive to equitable lien cases related to personal property 57 (see ALJR 211), but the lack of clarity of principles concerning who to impose an equitable lien was seen in the cases reviewed
 lekin kul milakar, abhi bhi kendriya talmail main ek kami mahasoos kii jaati he
 Although the argument as to the lien discussed may not be practicable, two other forms of debt burden are also sometimes referred to as liens
 kuch vidhiyaan dayitvon ke liye ek suraksha ke rup main uske maalik ke khilaaf sampatti ke pratidhaaran kaa niskriy adhikaar pradaan karti hai
 For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom allows the airport to halt an aircraft for impaired airport charges and aviation fuel
 haalanki is adhikaar ko UK diwalia kanoon ke tahat grahanadhikaar ke rup main mana jaataa he, lekin tark he is tarah ke vaidhanik adhikaar darasal grahanadhikaar nahin hai, lekin ye adhikaar grahanadhikaar ke anuroop hai; haalanki kuch log kah sakate hai ki bagaiyr kisi antar ke yah bhed he
 It is said that a contract entered into by an agreement is not a lien, in which one party can hold the other party's goods until payment is made, because the lien is not a non-consensual lien under a common law
 so may
 However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as lien even if they are not expressed as lien
 samudri grahanadhikaar vah grahanadhikaar he jo pot par us rindaata ke daawey ko sunishchit karne ke liye diya jaataa he jo pot par samudri sevaayen pradaan karata he athwa pot kaa upyog karne main ghayal hua ho
 samudri grahanadhikaar kabhi kabhi suchit drushti bandhak ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Maritime liens are similar in most jurisdictions under the laws of other liens
 samudri grahanadhikaar "bahut hi anokhe nausena kanoon kii vishistataaon main se ek" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 a maritime lien creates a securities interest of this nature on ships that are unknown to the Uniform Law or Equity
 yah shuddh rup se kanoon kii kaarywahi se saamne aata he or sambandhit sampatti par ek daawey ke rup main vidyaman rahata he, gupt tathaa adrishy donon tarah se, jise aksar parinium dwaara panjikrut byaaj suraksha ke anya roopon par praathamikta di jaati he
 However these characteristics differ under the laws of different countries, which can be described as: duniya bhar main, badi sankhya main liens ke vibhinn prakaar or iske bahut saare up-vibhaajan hai

 Raja Bhoj had built a sea-like pond near Bhojpal Nagar, which went to the huge Shiva temple of Bhojpur in the east and south
 aaj bhi bhojpur jate samay, raste main shivmandir ke paas us talab kii pattharon kii bani vishaal paal dikhti he
 At that time the water of that pond was considered very holy and curing diseases
 kaha jaataa he ki raja bhoj ko charm rog ho gaya tha tab kisi rishi yaa vaidya ne unhen is talab ke pani main snaan karne or use pine kii salaah di thi jisase unka charmrog thik ho gaya tha
 The huge Shiva Linga installed in the Shiv temple was also anointed with the water of that huge pond

 Like his uncle Munj, he also wanted to establish an empire in western India and to fulfill this desire, he had to fight with his neighboring states in every direction
 munj kii mrityu shokajanak paristhiti main ho jane se parmaar bahut hi uttejit the or isiliye parmaar bhoj chalukyon se badla len ke vichaar se dakshin kii ore sena lekar chadhaai karne ko prerit hue
 He attacked the treaty with Kalburi Gangaideva of Dahl and Rajendra Chola of Tanjore as well as the south, but the then king Chalukya Jaisingh II bravely confronted and saved his kingdom

 san 1018 i
 ke kuch hi pehle bhoj ne indrarath naamak ek vyakti ko, jo sambhavat: kaling ke gang raajaaon kaa samant tha, haraaya tha After ending the war with Jai Singh II and Indrath, Bhoja moved his army towards the countries bordering the western border of India and first attacked the kingdom called Lat, which extended south to Surat under the Bombay state
 vahaan ke raja chalukya kirtiraj ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or bhoj ne kuch samay tak usapar adhikaar rakhaa
 After this, in about 1020 AD, Bhoja attacked Konkan, located south of Lat and extending from Thana district to Malagar beach and defeated the king of Shilharas named Arikeshri
 konkan ko parmaron ke rajya main mila liya gaya or unke saamanton ke rup main shilaharon ne yahan kuch samay tak rajya kiya

 Bhoja also once marched against Kalachuri Gangaideva of Dahl, who had supported him at the time of the invasion of the south
 gangeyadev haar gaya parantu use aatmasamarpan nahin karnaa padaa
 Shortly before 1055 AD, Ganga's son Karna entered into a treaty with Chaulukya Bhima i of Gujarat and attacked the Malavas from the east and the west
 bhoj apana rajya bachaane kaa prabandh kar hi rahaa tha ki beemaari se uski aakasmik mrityu ho gai or rajya sugamawa se akramanakariyon ke adhikaar main chalaa gaya
 In the north Bhoja also invaded the country of the Chandelas where a king named Vidyadhar ruled
 parantu usase koi laabh na hua
 The Bhoja's attempt to conquer Gwalior did not have any good result because the king of Kachhapaghat Kirtiraj faced his attack firmly
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki bhoj ne kuch samay ke liye kannauj par bhi vijay paa lee thi jo us samay pratihaaron ke patan ke badwaale parivartan kaal main tha
 Bhoja also declared war against the Shakhambari's Chahmanas in Rajasthan and defeated the then King Chahaman Seenram

 usne bhoj ke viruddh ek badi sena taiyaar kii or bhoj par akraman kar diya, parantu durbhagyavash raste main hi chechak se uski mrityu ho gai
 After this, Vallabhraj's younger brother Rare Raj took the reins of power in his hands
 kuch samay baad bhaaj ne use bhi yuddh main haraaya
 During the reign of Bhima's successor Bhima, Bhoja sent his commander Kulchandra to wage war against Gujarat
 kulchandra ne puure pradesh par vijay praapt kii tathaa uski rajdhani anhilapattan ko lutaa
 Bhima once invaded Abu and defeated his king Parmar Dhandu when he had to flee and seek refuge in Bhit in Chitrakoot

Nana Saheb was the architect of the first struggle of Indian independence of 1857
 unka mul naam 'dhondupant' tha
 Nana Saheb led the rebels against the British in Kanpur in the freedom struggle
 
 Nana Saheb was born in 1824 to Madhavnarayan Rao, a resident of Venugram
 inke pita peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke sagotra bhai the
 The Peshwa accepted the child Nanarao as his adopted son and made adequate arrangements to initiate his education
 unhen hathi ghode kii sawari, talwaar va bandook chalaane kii vidhi sikhaai gai or kai bhashaaon kaa acha gyaan bhi karaayaa gaya
 Peshwa died on 28 January 1851
 nanarav ne badi shaan ke saath peshwa kaa antim sanskaar kiya
 The question of the succession of the late Peshwa arose
 company ke shashan ne bithur sthit kamishnar ko yah aadesh diya ki vah nanarav ko yah soochna de ki shashan ne unhen keval peshwai dhan sampatti kaa hi uttaradhikari mana he na ki peshwa kii oopaadhi kaa yaa usase sanlagn rajnatik va vyaktigat suvidhaon kaa
 In connection with obtaining the throne of Eadadarth Peshwa and do not perform any function or performance
 parantu mahatvakankshi nanarav ne sari sampatti ko apane haath main lekar peshwa ke shastraagaar par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 Within a few days Nanarao took over all the titles of the Peshwa
 turant hi unhone british sarkaar ko aavedanpatr diya or peshwai pension ke chaalu karaane kii nyyochit maang kii
 Along with this, he also sent kharita etc
 with his lawyer, which the Collector of Kanpur returned and informed him that the government does not accept his professional titles
 nanarav dhundhupant ko isse bada ksht hua kyonki unhen anek ashriton kaa bharan poshan karnaa tha
 Nana Saheb wrote to Lord Dalhousie to get a pension, but when he refused, he appointed Azimullah Khan as his advocate and sent it to Queen Victoria
 ajimullah ne anek praytn kiye par asafal rahe
 On his return, he traveled to France, Italy and Russia etc
 waapas aakar ajimullah ne naanaa sahab ko apni vifaltaa, angrejon kii vaastavik paristhiti tathaa europe ke swadhinata andolanon kaa gyaan karaayaa
 Nanarao Dhundhupant suffered greatly from the attitude of the British Government
 ve chup baithanevaale na the
 He started the pilgrimage at this time
 naanaa sahab kaa is umr main tirthayatra par nikalnaa kuch rahasyatmak sa jaan padataa he
 In 1857, he went to Kalpi, Delhi and Lucknow
 kalpi main aapane bihar ke prasiddh kunwar singh se bhent kii or bhavi kranti kii kalpana kii
 When the revolution began in Meerut, Nana Saheb led the armies of the revolution in secret and overtly with great valor and efficiency
 kranti prarambh hote hi unke anuyaayiyon ne angreji khajaane se saadhe aath lakh rupaya or kuch yudhsaamagree praapt kii
 The British of Kanpur were imprisoned in a stronghold and the revolutionaries hoisted the Indian flag there
 sabhi krantikari dilli jane ko kanpur main ekatra hue
 Nana Saheb led them and prevented them from going to Delhi because they would have taken more danger there
 kalyanpur se hi naanaa sahab ne yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii
 He divided his troops into several troops
 jab sab angrej kanpur ke satichaura ghat se naavon par ja rahe the to krantikariyon ne unpar goliyaan chalaayin or unamem se bahut se maare gaye
 British historians blame Nana only for this, but there is no sufficient evidence in his favor
 
 On 1 July 1857, when the British left Kanpur, Nana Saheb declared complete independence and also assumed the title of Peshwa
 naanaa sahab kaa adamya saahas kabhi bhi kam nahin hua or unhone krantikari senaaon kaa baraabar netritv kiya
 In the places of Fatehpur and Aang etc
, there were fierce battles with Nana's team and the British
 kabhi krantikari jite to kabhi angrej
 However, the British kept on growing
 iske ananthar naanaa sahab ne angrejon senaaon ko badhate dekh naanaa sahab ne ganga nadi paar kii or lakhanu ko prasthaan kiya
 Nana Saheb returned to Kanpur once again and when he came there and the English army took the route between Kanpur and Lucknow in his possession, then Nana Saheb left Awadh and went towards Rohelkhand
 ruhelkhand pahunchakar unhone khan bahadur khan ko apana sahyog diya
 By now the British had understood that unless Nana Saheb was caught, the rebellion could not be suppressed
 jab bareli main bhi krantikariyon kii haar hui tab naanaa sahab ne maharana pratap kii bhanti anek ksht sahe parantu unhone firangiyon or unke mitron ke sanmukh aatmasamarpan nahin
 The British government declared great prizes for the capture of Nana Saheb, but he failed
 sachmuch naanaa sahab kaa tyaag evam swatantry, unki veerta or sainik yogyata unhen bhartiya itihaas ke ek pramukh vyakti ke asana par bitha detii he

 antytah ise 1973 ke samvidhan se badal diya gaya, jo ab bhi lagu he
 After the constitution was changed in India in 1950, Pakistan's lawmakers stepped up efforts to establish their constitution
 pradhanmantri mohammad ali or unki sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne desh main vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke saath pakistan ke liye ek samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Finally, because of this joint work, the first set of constitutions was implemented

 samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years
 17 farvari 1960, ko ayub khan ne desh ke bhavishya ke raajnneetik dhaanche par report karne ke liye ek ayog kii niyukti kii

 yah samvidhan nihit 250 lekh baarah bhaagon or teen kaarykram main baanta gaya tha
 Like the previous constitution, it also talked about building Pakistan on Islamic values and keeping a unicameral legislature
 parantu 1956 ke samvidhan ke mukaable is samvidhan kii pariyojnaon ke mutabik pakistan ke raashtrapati ko anek karyadhikaar diye gaye the, or multah ek adhyakshiya vyavastha gathit kii gai thi
