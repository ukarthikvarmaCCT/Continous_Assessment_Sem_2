 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically

 Logotherapy has given it the name of existential frustration
 The word 'existence' can be used in three ways
 The basis of life
 The meaning of existence, the pursuit of concrete meaning in personal existence
 This frustration can also result in neurosis
 Victor E
 Frankel dies They raise a very big question through the suffering of people, which has become the cause of everyone's weakness in today's life, that is the migration of meaninglessness in life
 Such suffering is seen mostly in those who escaped from the death camp
 There was no eagerness to live
 There was hollowness in their mind because they go through internal loneliness
 Victor E
 Frankl gave him the name of existence existence

 Frankel says that the real meaning of life is its own Not in the psyche but in the world
 In the same way, the real purpose of human existence is not through self-introduction
 Its essence comes from self-excellence
 Frankel Number thing that self-introduction arguments bring it to perfect justice could ever become the basis of life, as human as will try to get him as he lost i sansar ko swayan ki abhivyakti kabhi nahin samajhnaa chahie, naa hi sansar ko ek maatr saadhan yaah aatm parichay ko praapt karne kaa upaychiisse yahi aashay spasht hota hai ki jivan kaa arth sthir nahin he, par iskaa koi chor bhi nahin handi logotherapy ke antargat ham jivan ke arth teen tareeke se dhund sakate hai: karm ke madhyam se; kisi ke yaah kisi vaastu ke mulya ko anubhav karke; pidaa sekhi pehle tareeke ko purna karnaa atyant laabhadaayak haii dusre or tisare tareeko main punah vistaar ki aavashyaktaa handidusraa tarika jisase jivan main arth kaa pravesh hota hai wo anubhavon se hi praapt hota hai, yah shiksha hamen prakruti se ho sakati hai yaa phir samskruti se yaa phir kisi ko anubhav karke bhi yani prem ke dwarai prem hi vah ek dhaal hai jisase manushya ke antaratmik vyaktitv ko sinchaa ja saktaa handi koi bhi kisi manushya ko tab tak nahin jaan saktaa yaa samaj saktaa jab tak prem bhav ki utpatti nahin hotiji prem ko aadhyatmik rup ke anusaar agar daalaa jaae to usase vah dusre manushya ke mahatvapurn lakshan ko dekh saktaa hai, vahi manushya jisase vah prem karata hoi isse bhi adhik vah apane samarthy ki pushti ho jaati he jo aatm parichay ke raah par bahut bada kadam haii isse donon vyakti apane samarthy ko pahchaan jate handi The third way that helps a man discover the meaning of his life is suffering
 Whenever a man is helpless or goes through a situation that does not result in his hand such as: an incurable disease, then a person realizes his identity
 There is a lot of opportunity to do it, that is, you have the opportunity to get the biggest meaning of life by facing the pain
 In this, the attitude of the person towards the suffering is also strong to withstand the suffering

12694 Nannayya Bhatt: is called the 'adikavi' of Andhra literature because the original portion of the Andhra Mahabharata composed by him is considered to be the first poem in the available literature of Telugu
 inke pehle ke jo footkar geet mili, ve bhashaa or chand kii drushti se 'deshi paddati' ke anusaar hai jo sanskrit main pratipaadit lakshan ke anusaar nahin hai or is kaaran panditon ke aadar par paatr nahin hue
 Nannayya created the epic epic, which is mainly of the 'marg' method
 jab jain dharm kaa prachaar dakshin main joro se ho rahaa tha chod raja vaidic dharm kii raksha ke liye katibaddh hue
 Mahabharata began to be paralyzed in Tamil associations
 isi bhav se prerit hokar andhra ke pratapi raja rajraj narendra apane aasthaan ke kulguru tathaa mahakavi nannayy se prarthana kii ki vyasakrut mahabharat kaa andhra bhashaa main parivartan kiya jaae
 Accordingly, Nannayya initiated the creation of the Andhra Mahabharata, based on the Sanskrit Mahabharata, as a multiple translation
 nannayy ne apni rachana main sanskrit shabdon kaa prayog usee reeti se kiya jo us samay andhra praant main hota tha
 Tadbhav and indigenous words which were in the behavior of the public, also assumed them as a refined form
 kuch sanskrit chhandon ko lekar yatimaitri tathaa prasmaitri ke niyamon ke anusaar likhaa or kannada kaavyon main paae janevaale anek prashast chhandon ko bhi liya
 In the creation of the Mahabharata, Nannay got great help from a friend named Narayan Bhatt, who Nannayya himself mentioned in the preface of his treatise

 The vehicle that is used to go into space or vyom is called a spacecraft
 antariksh yaan anek kaaryon ke liye upyog kiye jate hai, jinamein pramukh hai : Many subsystems are provided in spacecraft according to the need and purpose
 kuch mukhya pranaliyaan ye hai: They are called Ahle Sunnah or Sunni, who consider the way of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad Sahab as a way of passing on their lives
 These names are also used to describe themselves as separate from the Shia alias Rafaziyo, officially the elder in the Ahle Sunnah in South Asia
 Generally, three gangs come: Barelvi, Deobandi, Ahle Hadith or Salafi
 barelvi muhim dakshin asia main sufi andolan ke antargat ek up-andolan ko kaha jaataa he yah ahale sunnat val jamaat se nikali ek muhim hai jise unnisvin evam beesvin sadi ke bharat main rohelkhand sthit bareli se sunni vidwaan ahamed raja khan kadri ne prarambh kiya tha,
 Barelvi Sunni Hanafi is a large section of Barelvi Muslims who are now condensed in large numbers in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa and Britain
 aalaa hazarat imam ahamed raza kadri ne apni prasiddh fatwa rajavia ke madhyam se bharat main paaramparik or roodhiwaadee islam kaa bachaav karte hue apana mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Deobandi Muheem was actually presented as a Sufi campaign by Ismail Dehlavi, the elder of the Deobandis, Alimo Qasim Nanotvi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Khalil Amethvi, who presented the Wahabiyat of Saudi Arabia to the South Asian Muslims
 dakshin asia ke zyaadaatar sunni barelvi hote hai
 Deobandi Sunni is also in large number
 ahale haddees vah sunni hai jo sufism main vishwaas nahin karte inhen salfi bhi kaha jaataa hai kyon kii ye islam ko us tarah samajhane or manane kaa daawa karte hai hai jis tarah salf ne quran or sunnat ko samajha, salfi sunni urf ahale haddees zayaadaatar saudi arab or qatar main hai
 They do not trouble any Imam
 aisa kaha jaataa hai ki puure vishwa ke musalamaanon main kattarpanth failaane kaa kaam deobandi or wahabi vichaardhaara ne kiya he haalanki kashmir or chechanya main ugravad kii shuruyaat sufi panth ke maanane waalon ne hi ki thi
 The name was changed to Saudi Arabia in 1925 after the third and decisive occupation by Ala Saud over Arabia, and the heritage of religious and historical importance was demolished by the name of idolatry, including the tomb of Syeda Fatima and the tomb of Osman Gani
 barelvi ek naam diya gaya he sunni musalmaan ke giroh ko jo sufism main vishwaas rakhte hai or saikadon barason se islam suniyat ke maanane vaale hai
 People speak Barelvi because of the attachment of Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Khan to Barelwio! They are also called Rajokhani, there are many reasons for the Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat to be called Barelvi by the Wahhabi Deobandi ideology, in which it can also be a goal to call ourselves Sunni! In Sunni Jamaat, Ahmad Raza was the first to crack down on the mischievous books of Deobandi Aalim and make common Muslims aware of their false record! By writing Hasmul Haramain, he clarified that Darul Uloom Deoband is a school of false ideology in reality

 Modern electromagnets are based on vacuum nozzles or solid state electronic devices and are capable of measuring currents up to 1 femtoampier
 vidyutdarshi bhi samaan siddhanton par kaary karata he kintu adhik saral upkaran he kintu yah keval aavesh yaa vibhavaantar ke saapeksh pariman kaa gyaan detaa he
 by is upkaran se do aaweshit chaalkon ke bich aakarshan bal ke maapan dwaara aavesh, vibhav ityadi kaa maapan hota he
 It consists of a protector ring capacitor consisting of a protector ring and two metal plates
 pehali pattica ek kamaani dwaara sookshmmapi pench se judi hoti he or upar neeche chalaai ja sakati he
 The protector ring remains fixed in its place and the second plaque can be moved up and down with another micrometer screw
 pehali pattica kaa prishth sarvada ek sookshmdarshi se dekha ja saktaa he
 After attaching all the plates to the earth, a low weight whose mass, say m, is placed on the first plate which causes it to slide down, now bringing it up with a screw and leaving it in the plane of the protector ring
 bhaar ko hataate hi kamaani kii lachak ke kaaran pehali pattica upar chali jaati he
 It is clear that to bring the first plaque protector valve to the level of the first plate, the same force will have to be applied from the bottom as the load was
 ab pehali pattica or sangrakshak valay ko ek bydaree yaa dianemo se nishchit vibhav dekar us bindu se sambhddha kiya jaataa he jiskaa vibhav gyaat karnaa ho
 Due to the difference in the two plates, there is attraction in them, the value of which is changed by changing the distances of both plates equal to mg and the reading of the micrometer is read
 vibhavaantar kaa mulya sthir vaidyut maatrak main napata he
 The value of the difference originates in length and mass, and these are fundamental quantities
 isi kaaran is upkaran ko nirpeksh vidyunmapi kehete hai
 Calvin also made a vidymometer more sensitive than the attractor plate, which is called the circle-pediometer

 a spherical mirror is placed in this sutra
 jab pattee gumti he tab is sutara main anthan aa jaati he or vikshep kone ko is darpan or deep tathaa paimaana kii sahaayta se napa ja saktaa he
 The entire device is enclosed in a metal box, thereby avoiding the impact of the external electric field
 is baks main ek khidki hoti he jiske dwaara darpan kaa vikshep dekha ja saktaa he
 If there is some difference between the two circle legs and there is a certain potential on the needle, a forcemaking acts on the needle and rotates the needle due to the effect of the electric field
 latakaanewaale sutara main anthan ke kaaran sooyee ek nishchit vikshep ke baad ruk jaati he
 The deflection is proportional to the difference or square of the foot
 yah vidyunmapi do prakaar se prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this case, the deflection is proportional to the square of the difference, so it can also measure the reciprocal difference
 isi vidyunmapi se aavesh, vibhav, dharita or paravaidyuthank niyatank ityadi naape ja sakate hai
 When the difference between two points is measured with an ordinary voltmeter, the current flows in them and the voltage decreases due to the internal resistance between the points
 at: saadhaaran voltmapi vibhav sarvada kam naapega
 Especially when there is a high resistance between the points
 yah dosha vidyunmapi main nahin he, parantu iskaa prayog bahut kathin he
 This cannot be measured quickly

 The gridbyes should be such that the triode acts as a tube detector
 ucch vibhav or usase sambanddh hue pratirodhakon ko aisa samanjit kiya jaataa he ki disht dharamapi main shunya vikshep ho
 After this, there is some deflection in the scale when the unknown potential is connected to the grid and the ends of the fiber
 us vikshep ke mulya se vibhav kaa mulya gyaat ho jaataa he
 In fact, the calibration of the deflection of the measured is already done by the known potential

 Sugar is the basis for vinegar formation because sugar is first fermented by enzymes to form alcohol and then fermented into acetic acid from appropriate bacteria
 angoor, seb, santare, ananas, jamun tathaa anya falon ke ras, jinamein sharkara paryaapt he, sirka ko taiyaar karne ke liye bahut upyukt hai kyonki unamem jeevanuon ke liye poshan padaarth paryaapt maatra main hote hai
 The chemical change of fructose and vinegar into acetic acid can be characterized by the following formulas: ye donon hi kriyaayein jeevanuon ke dwaara hoti hai
 Alcohol fermentation in yeast fermentation is half the percentage of fermented sugars and theoretically the acetic acid must be higher than the alcohol, as oxygen is added to the second action, but it is the same in use because some alcohols are bacteria
 And some are destroyed by evaporation

 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan bharat ke pratham up-raashtrapati or dwitiya raashtrapati rahe
 He was a pioneer of Indian culture, an eminent educationist, a great philosopher and a devout Hindu thinker
 unke inhen gunon ke kaaran san 1954 main bharat sarkaar ne unhen sarvocch sammaan bharat ratna se alankrita kiya tha
 His birthday is celebrated as Teachers' Day in India
 dow radhakrishnan kaa janm tamilnadu ke tirutani gram main, jo tatkaaleen madras se lagbhag 64 ki me kii duuri par sthit he, 5 sitambar 1888 ko hua tha
 The family he was born into was a Brahmin family
 unka janm sthaan bhi ek pavitra tirthasthal ke rup main vikhyath rahaa he
 Radhakrishnan's ancestors had previously lived in a village called 'sarvepalli' and in the mid-18th century they had migrated towards the village of Tirutani
 lekin unke purakhe chaahate the ki unke naam ke saath unke janmasthal ke gram kaa bodh bhi sadaiv rahanaa chaiye
 That is why his family started wearing 'sarvapalli' before his name
 dow radhakrishnan ek garib kintu vidwaan brahman kii santaan the
 His father's name was 'sarvepalli Veeraswamy' and mother's name was 'sitamma'
 unke pita rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 He was responsible for the maintenance of a very large family
 veeraswami ke paanch putr tathaa ek putree thi
 Radhakrishnan's place was second among these descendants
 unke pita kaafii kathinaayee ke saath parivaar kaa nirvahan kar rahe the
 Due to this, the child Radhakrishnan did not get any special pleasure in childhood
 radhakrishnan kaa balykaal tirutani evam tirupati jaise dharmik sthalon par hi vyateet hua
 He spent the first eight years in Tirutani
 yadhyapi unke pita puraane vichaaron ke the or unamem dharmik bhavanaayen bhi thim, iske baavjood unhone radhakrishnan ko chrishchiyan mishanri sanstha luthern mishan skool, tirupati main 1896-1900 ke madhya vidyadhyayan ke liye bheja
 Then for the next 4 years he was educated in Vellore
 iske baad unhone madras chrishchiyan college, madras main shiksha praapt kii
 He was brilliant since childhood
 in 12 varshon ke adhyayan kaal main radhakrishnan ne bible ke mahatvapurn ansh bhi yaad kar liye
 For this, he was awarded the honor of special merit
 is umr main unhone vir saavarkar or swami vivekananda kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 He passed the matriculation level examination in 1902 and also received a scholarship
 iske baad unhone 1904 main kala sankaay pariksha pratham shrenee main uteern kii
 He also received special merit remarks in psychology, history and mathematics due to his high scores
 iske alaava chrishchiyan college, madras ne unhen chaatravrutti bhi di
 After doing his MA in Philosophy in 1916, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Madras Residency College
 baad main usee college main ve praadhyaapak bhi rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan introduced the Indian philosophy to the world through his writings and speeches
 saare vishwa main unke lekhon kii prashansa kii gayi
 At that time, in the Brahmin families of Madras, marriage was completed at an early age and Radhakrishnan was no exception
 1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa
 At this time, he was only twenty years old
 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India

 When he became the vice-president, the first President of independent India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad ji, in 1954 gave him the country's highest decoration Bharat Ratna for his great philosophical and educational achievements

02 barhaara sultanganj, bhagalpur, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 In the very ancient times, man imagined the sun in the morning, afternoon, evening and night on the basis of different states
 ye samay sthool rup se pratyaksh hai
 After that, the moment would have been imagined
 isi prakaar usne surya kii kakshagatiyon se pakshon, maheenon, rituon tathaa varshon kii kalpana kii hogi
 To measure time minutely, first cones and solarium were used
 raatri ke samay kaa gyaan nakshatron se kiya jaataa tha
 Thereafter water and sand ghatyantras were made
 ye bharat main ati pracheen kaal se prachlit the
 Their description is found in ancient books of astrology such as Panchasiddhantika and Suryasiddhanta
 pani kaa ghatiyantra banane ke liye kisi paatr main chota sa chhed kar diya jaataa tha, jisase paatr ek ghanti main pani main dub jaataa tha
 Moments were marked on its exterior
 isliye palon ko paneey pal bhi kehete hai
 The sand gland was also like water ghat, in which the time of sand falling from the hole was known
 kintu ye sabhi ghatiyantra sookshm na the tathaa inamen vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan bhi thim
 With the evolution of science, the pendulum watches and then the new watches, which we use today, went unnoticed
 jaisaa pehle bataa diya gaya he, samay kaa gyaan surya kii drishy sthitiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Generally, there is a day from sunrise to sunset and night from sunset to sunrise again, but day and night together for tithinna is called day
 kisi sthaan par surya dwaara yamyottar vrutt ke adhobindu kii ek parikrama ko ek drishy din kehete hai, tathaa surya kii kisi sthir nakshatra ke saapeksh ek parikrama ko nakshatra din kehete hai
 According to this constellation convention, the initial point of measurement, that is, the spring coincident point of the ecliptic and equatorial circle is taken
 yadhyapi nakshatra din sthir he, tathaapi yah hamaare vyavhaar ke liye upyogi nahin he, kyonki yah drishy din se 3 minute 53 second kam he
 The value of visible day is not always the same
 at: kisi ghadi se drishy surya ke samay kaa bataaya janaa kathin he
 There are two reasons for this: one, the apparent motion of the Sun is not always the same, the other is that the apparent Sun is seen moving in the eclipse
 hamen samaysoochak yantra banane ke liye aise surya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo madhyam gati se sadaa vishuvatvrutt main chale
 Such astrologers call astrology astrology-mean-sun or simply mean sun
 vishuvatvrutt ke madhyam surya tathaa krantivrutt ke madhyam surya ke antar ko bhaskaracharya ne udayantar tathaa krantivrittiya madhyam surya tathaa spasht surya ke antar ko bhujaantar kaha he
 If the astrology-mean Sun performs Udayantar and Bhujantar rites, then that scene will become Surya
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar ke ek saath sanskaar ko samay samikar kehete hai
 This is similar to the difference between the time of our clocks and the time of visible sun
 samay samikar kaa prati din kaa maatr ganit dwaara nikaala ja saktaa he
 In the Sailor Almanac published today, its daily value is given
 is prakaar ham apni ghadiyon se jab chahen drishy surya kaa samay gyaat kar sakate hai
 It is used a lot in astrology
 vilomat: ham surya ke udhrv yamyottar bindu ke langhan kaa vedh karke, usamen samay samikar ko jod yaa ghataakar, vaastavik madhya-surya kaa samay gyaat karke apni ghadiyon ke samay ko thik kar sakate hai
 2500BC
 hamane samay naapane ke liye aadhunik ghadiyaan banaain, tab yah paaya gaya ki sardi tathaa garmi ke kaaran ghadiyon ke dhaatunirmit purjon ke sikudne tathaa failane ke kaaran ye ghadiyaan thik samay nahin deteen
 Now we had this problem, how do we know the subtle impurities of our mechanical watches? Although we could know the inaccuracy of our clocks by the method of skipping the sun's transcendental meridian, the perforation of the sun's meridian meridian itself is somewhat unique, and the sun's magnum opus is more likely to cause the observer's personal error
 duusari kathinaayee yah thi ki hamaari madhya-surya-ghadi ke samay kaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se koi pratyaksh sambandh na tha
 The constellation clock was created to fill this gap, which indicated the constellation time
 iske 24 ghante prithvi kii apane aksh kii ek parikrama ke, athwa vasantapaat bindu ke udhrv yamyottar bindu kii ek parikrama ke, samay ke tulya hote hai
 Around the 21st of March, the spring point skips over and over with our visible sun
 us samay nakshatra ghadi kaa samay shunya ghanta, shunya minutes, shunya second hota he
 It is 12 in our time
 duusare din dopaher ko nakshatra ghadi kaa samay 4 minute hoga
 On any other fixed day, we can change the mean-sun time in proportion to the nakshatra even, or the nakshatra time to mean sun time
 navik panchangon main is prakaar ke samayparivartan kii saraniyan di rahati hai
 Thus, if we find a sidereal clock giving pure time, then we can keep the time of our mean clock pure
 yadhyapi nakshatra ghadi bhi yantric hoti he tathaa usamen bhi yantric truti ho jaati he, tathaapi ise pratidin shuddh kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki iskaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se pratyaksh sambandh he
 It goes like this: The angle that a planet and star makes from the north-easterly point towards Pachim on the celestial pole is called a black angle
 is prakaar nakshatra sam basantpaat kaa kalkon he
 The equinoctial distance of a star or planet from its equatorial spring is equinox
 chunki kalkon vishuvadvrutt ke chaap dwaara hi janaa jaataa he, isliye jab grah yaa tara urdhv yamyottar bindu par hoga, us samay uskaa vishuvaansh nakshatra samay ke tulya hoga

 jisase police use iesai agent or dange kii sajeeshkarta kaa aarope madhti hai
 Arrested Ansari is summoned to the Mumbai Special Court, but he is attacked by an unknown party despite being evicted from a police siege from Chandangarh
 police kisi tarah use bachaa to leti hai par tab tak kaaphi gambhir nuksaan ho chukaa hota he
 The Chief of Police, ACP Naidu, gets the responsibility of appointing five policemen to bring Ansari from Chandangadh on hearing on a special court hearing

 He agrees to this campaign so that in some way if he is successful in his career, he gets promotion to Additional Commissioner so that his services and efforts can get due respect
 ab uski team main sammilit hai varisht inspector shekhar verma jo ek bhrasht pulicekarmi hai, sah-inspector aswin gupte or do hawaldaar kamalesh saavant or gajanan mhatre
 But before his departure from Mumbai, he is caught by a photographer who was secretly taking pictures of him, but he does not get anything out of him
 darasal vah yashavanth ongre ke kehane par team kii jasusi kar rahaa tha
 But as the police take some action on the thread between them, Angre kills the photographer and his family with an explosive attached to their telephone receiver
 anant apni team saath chandangarh pahunchataa hi he ki police ko mahalakshami naam se ek skool teacher kii ore se uske skool sampada main kuch sandigdh gatividhiyon ke khulaase kii khabar milti he
 Anant and his team, along with the local police, find the bodies from the terrorists' room
 jab kamare main chhapemari jari hi rahati he tabhi phone kii ring baj uthati he, lekin anant sabhi ko phone resiver uthaane se pehle saavdhaanee se sunishchit karata he jiske parinaam main unhen resiver se jude visphotak kaa pataa chalata he, use hataakar phone risive karne par koi jawaab nahin miltaa
 Anant's faith is confirmed that there is a gang that is aware of each of his activities and this campaign, in which he has to decide to change the plan immediately
 police stesan main vaapasi dauraan anant se milane ansaari kii maa yah fariyaad lekar aati hai ki use bich raah main na markar sidhe adaalat le jaae or sahi nyaay karaae
 Anant assures her that she will definitely introduce him to her son
 vahiin ongre kii ore se anant ko anjaan kaal milti he, lekin vah pahchaan nahin paata or kaal tres karne kii koshish bhi naakaam rahati he
 But then the voice of his wife and daughter is heard on the same line
 anant fouran ghar ko phone kaal lagaataa hai lekin sthiti saamaanya paakar samaj jaataa he ki ongre ne mahaj use daraane ke liye ricarding tepe kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Anant leaves Mahalaxmi with his team and leaves for Mumbai that he has to stop on the long jam on the highway
 is jam se pare nikalakar ek kachche raste dwaara chalate hi he ki unka saamana pashu-meley ke taur par baari bheed kaa saamana hota hai
 While removing the cattle and people from the road, Anant gets a call from Angre only to realize that he is around
 par anant use khoj hi letaa he or aswin ke saath peechha karata hai
 Shekhar Verma gets down from the gypsy to board Ansari's big van so that both sides can be protected
 ongre meley main jabardast bhagdad machaakar anant ke pakad se batch jaataa hai
 As Anant moves in with his team, Shekhar realizes that the jeep was left unsafe due to the van's care
 jeep rokkar shekhar fouran gaadi neeche jhaankta he or tab use visphotak dikhaai padataa he
 He then runs away, telling everyone to retreat that the jeep collides with the explosion, but his tremendous impact on the engine of the van
 anant tab team ke saath haive se alag vine ko dhakke lagaataa sunsaan raste hote hue ek makaan par pahunch vine marammat kar rukne or phir aage kaarywai karne kaa faisla karti hai
 Anant now calls Naidu to explain the current situation and asks for additional police assistance by giving him the location of the location
 anant us ghar par meley main dikhe anjaan vyakti ko pahchaanane kii koshish karata he, use tab ongre kii yaad aati he jo uske vibhaag kaa hi ghor bhrasht or nirmam purv-officer hai
 Whom, in the crime of killing five innocents, Anant sends him to jail and dismisses him from the police department
 phir tab team ko police vine najar aati he, par jise wo apni sahyog team maan rahi thi asal main ve ongre ke hatyare sabit hote hai
 In a few minutes, heavy firing goes on and all the bullet and cartridges of Anant's team fall short in retaliation
 vahiin ongre ke aadmi police ke hawaldaar driver ko phenk ansaari ko reeha karne ko kehete hai
 When Shekhar does not understand any other option, he tries to pull Ansari out that Anant stops his path
 or tab donon ke bich takaraar machati hai, jisamen shekhar ke anusaar uske pramukh anant ek mahatvaheen pulicekarmi hai jo sabaki jivan kii upeksha kar apane naitik aadarshon ko bachaane kaa hi paksh legaa
 Confusing the debate, Anant and Ashwin finally point their pistols at Shekhar, but Ansari then refuses, saying that the terrorists have come here to kill, not for his release
 uske mutabik vah to mahaj chandangarh kaa saadhaaran doctor he jo eemaandaaree se apane peshey or parivaar ke bich saamanjasy bithaae tha
 At the same time, during the treatment of the riot victims, a journalist named Bhaskar Joshi meets who is aware that the only responsible for this communal riots is MLA Deodhar who wants to hide his crime by killing these social activists standing against him
 bhaskar isi pukhta saboot kii taiyaari main doctor ansaari ke paas aata he kyonki jin mritkon kii vah jaanch kar rahaa he uskaa nishkarsh devdhar ke virodh hi jayega
 Ansari submits the report to Bhaskar, but even before it is published Bhaskar is killed in a fatal attack and is threatened with giving Deodhar's file over the phone
 ansaari file dene se inkaar karata he or natijatan dangai or bhrasht police kii mileebhagat se uskaa ghar tabah karne saath samooche parivaar ko bhi maar diya jaataa he or jhuthe sabooton kii bina par aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya jaataa hai
 Meanwhile, Angre and his men arrive at the house and shoot the gun at Anant and the others, except Shekhar and Ashwin who immediately take advantage of the darkness to hide Ansari in the backyard
 jab tak ongre ke aadmi ghar kii talaashi karte, ongre anant se uske haathon bezjaati kaa badla lene ke tareeke bataata hai kyonki uske mutabik anant ko apni jaan se zyada apane kartavya or aadarshon kii hi parvaah hai
 At the same time, the men of Angre reach the warehouse while investigating the house
 ongre unke saath pravesh hi kar paata ki vahaan rakhe jvalansheel gas se bhare silindaron par baahar khadaa aswin us par goli daag ek jaanaleva dhamaakaa karata he jisase kuch gunde maare jate hai
 In this chaos, the team rushes to the police van as soon as Ansari is badly injured by the bullet fired by Angre
 tabhi anant ko naidu se ansaari ko goli lagane kii khabar puchha jaataa hai
 Anant understands that Naidu is also a corrupt policeman who works as a deodhar and informs Angre of all the activities of Anant
 anant apni team ke saath ghayal ansaari ko sthaneey aspataal main bharti karaate hai, doctor uski jaan to bachaa lete hai magar uski sthiti or bigadane kii bhi andeshaa karte hai
 Anant asks his team members to get rid of this campaign because the people who asked to go on this mission do not want to let it succeed
 ve bataate hai ki ve aakhir tak ise anjaam dekar rahenge
 Shekhar then apologizes for the mischief that happened last night and he insists on walking with them to the end so that he can prove himself honest police once more
 or phir anya sadsy bhi apni yahi raay dete hai
 At the same time, the local police takes Anant's team to the police station where they are said to have orders to rest them and be freed from Ansari's responsibility
 officer ko mili is jimmevary par anant apana rosh jaahir karata hai ki kis kadar bhrashtachar main dubi pulicekarmi devdhar jaise beyimaan raajnneetijna logon kii unheen ke vibhaag kaa afasar naidu hukmauduli karata he
 The officer looks at them and assures them of his help and on the call met Naidu misunderstands the arrest of the wrong people
 vahiin ongre or naidu kii naakaami par mantri devdhar anant kii team ke khilaaf samachar-samooh kii mantranaa par janata ko prachaarit karata he ki yah team bik chuki hai or iesai ke sambandh se jud chuki hai
 a mass group misled by Doordarshan and other news channels pelted Ansari at the same hospital to deliver them
 anant bina virodh kiye unke madhya jaakar kahata he ki jo log sachai se avgat nahin hote to aise hi bhrasht rajaneta unako bhramit kar apana hit sadhate hai
 Here Anant's team gets a caretaker train facility to leave for Mumbai
 lekin unki saavdhaanee baratane se pehle hi usee train par ongre apane hathiyaarband aadamiyon ke saath stesan pahunchataa he
 But when Havildar sees Kamlesh driving the police van out of the station, Angre and his men get caught in the blasts of bullets and while shooting the Shekhar train behind their back, Anant fires at the remaining terrorists while rescuing the other members hidden there
 kamalesh patariyon ke sameep vine roak train pakadaney kii koshish karata he par antat ongre ke chalaai goli se vah maaraa jaataa
 On reaching Mumbai, when Ansari is brought to the hospital for treatment, the doctors declare him dead after seeing his critical condition
 vahiin ansaari kii maa ko lagata hai ki anant ne jaanboojhkar unki prarthana kii upeksha kii hai or uski javabdehi se pehle hi gusse main patrakaron ke bich unhen tamaacha maarthi hai
 Despite this, the next morning, Anant holds a funeral with Ansari with his team, and proclaims the case to be re-processed before the media
 media main anant ke die bayaan se baukhalaayaa devar use apni seemaa main rahane kii dhamkee detaa hai lekin anant uske bahekaave main nahin aate
 Here Anant finds his team in some way through the son of journalist Bhaskar
 shekhar or mahalakshami us fil ko talashne grend post-offis pahonchte hai jahaan pehle hi ghaat lagaae ongre se unka saamana hota he
 Before the situation worsens, Shekhar gives the file to Mahalaxmi to hand over to Anant and Shekhar then confronts Angre's men
 kisi tarah shekhar ko najdiki stadium tak pahunchaane baad vah samaj jaataa hai ki mahalakshami ongre kii hi garlfrand he jo unki hi soochna par is fil ko kabja chuki he
 Shekhar calls Anant before he dies, revealing that Mahalakshmi is Angre's spy and then martyred in the shootout of Shekhar Angre's killers
 agle din anant or aswin mahalakshami kaa peechha karte hue ongre ko dundh nikaalte hai
 But in a gunfight, Angre kills Mahalakshmi and kills her as well
 anant tab ongre kaa peechha karte huue anya pulicekarmiyon ke sahare use gher letaa he or giraftaar se pehle anant aaveg main andre kii khub pitayee kar use bedam kar police ke hawaale karata he
 In view of the concrete evidence of the recovered file, the court punishes Angre, Deodhar and Naidu for their involvement in various serious crimes
 karawas ko le jane dauraan ongre ko jis vine se le jaaya gaya uski hathkadi fansaane vaali frem ko vah dhilaa paata he
 Immediately redeeming himself, Angre stops the van, attacking the sergeant, snatching the rifle
 tab tak aswin ke vine se baahar aate hi ongre usapar raifal tanta hai
 Angre pulls the trigger, but cannot fire when the bullet is not fired
 bandook rakhkar jaise hi ongre samarpan kar uski bevakoofi samaj hansata aswin do goliyaan ongre par daag detaa hai or unheen bolts ko dikhaate hue pehle se hi jaanboojhkar khole jane kaa ujagar karata he
 Ashwin then gives the necessary instructions to the sergeant for the entire incident and informs his superior officer over the phone that Angre had escaped from custody and was badly injured in a gunshot accident in self-defense

 Qur'an's 2: 101, 2: 143, 2: 151, 3:32, 3:81, 3: 144, 3: 164, 4: 79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7: 157, 8: In verses 01, 9: 3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09, Muhammad is called by various names, including bearers of good news, cautioners, and "who invite people to a just God Are, included

 allaah kuran ke surah al-ambia 21:107 main kahata hai :to be according to kanjul iman Muhammad is mentioned in the Qur'an as "pressured", "negotiator", "god messenger", "god servant", "proclaimer", "witness", "eloquent", "warner" "reminding" " Callers are called with names like "god," "stunning", and "kanti Giver"

 The name Muhammad appears four times in the Quran
