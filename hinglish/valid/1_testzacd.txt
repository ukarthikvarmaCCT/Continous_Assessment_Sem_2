 According to Sunni Muslims, there was no dispute regarding the struggle against Abu Bakr Siddiq, but all of them had accepted the Khalifa, according to Sunni beliefs, Hazrat Muhammad Sahab himself tried to impose Abu Bakr Siddiq in his place before his exile
 Abu Bakr Siddiq had indicated to be the Khalifa by taking charge of the work, in 632, Muhammad Sahab in his last Haj i had addressed his teammates near the lake

 On 4 August 2008, Zuma appeared in court
 On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson stated that the corruption charges against Zuma were illegal on procedural grounds because the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions did not give Zuma the opportunity to submit a representation before deciding to press charges and pay the state legal
 Instructed to do
 nikholson ne yah bhi kaha ki, unka maananaa tha ki raajnneetik hastkshep ne zuma ke khilaaf punah aarope daayar karne ke nirnay main ek bhoomika nibhaai, yadhyapi unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kyon unhone zuma par lage aaropon ko avaidh bataaya
 Nikholson also emphasized that his decision was not related to Zuma's guilt or guilt, but was only on a procedural basis
 vibhinn media reporton ne yah galat soochna di ki zuma ke khilaaf aarope khaarij kar die gaye hai
 This was not the case
 NDPP, zuma par punah aarope lagane main sakasham bana hua tha, haalanki, sirf ek hi baar unhen NDPP ke samaksh abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya wo bhi NDPP ke aisa karne ke nirnay ke aadhaar par
 nirnay ke 47 paragraph main, nyaayadhish nikholson ne likhaa, The compulsion to listen to representations is a part of the principle of audi alteram partem
 aavashyaktaa yah he ki ek vyakti jo ho saktaa he ki ek nirnay ke kaaran pratikul rup se prabhavit ho rahaa he, use ek anukool parinaam praapt karne kii drushti se ek abhyavedan prastut karne kaa avasar diya janaa chahie
 prabhavit vyakti ko aamtaur par us maamle ke saar yaa tatwon ke vishay main suchit kiya janaa chahie, jis par use jawaab dena he
 The court determined that the ndpp's failure to follow the procedure outlined in section 179 of the constitution invalidated the ndpp's decision to re-charge Zuma
 nyaayadhish nikholson ne paaya ki zuma par lagaae gaye aaropon ke samay par vibhinn anumaan lagaae ja sakate hai jo is nishkarsh kii pushti karata he ki isamen sarkaar kii kaaryakari shakha dwaara raajnneetik hastkshep kaa kuch ansh shaamil he
 Judge Nicholson writes in paragraph 210 of his decision, raashtrapati kii polokavane main hui raajnneetik haar ke baad, 28 disambar 2007 ko shriman emse dwaara chalaae gaye abhiyog kaa samay, sabase adhik durbhagyapurna tha
 This aspect, combined with the incident of Mr
 Piccoli who should have been independent and immune to the suspension of executive intervention, convinced me that the most true conclusion is that the damaging political influence continues
 nirnay ke anuchhed 220 main nyaayadhish nikholson ne aage likhaa he, There is a worrying structure in the behaviors i have set out above signs of political interference, pressure or influence
 yah mantri maduna dwaara shri ngakuka ko die gaye "raajnneetik netritv" se shuru hua, jab unhone aavedak par mukadmaa chalaane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa aparaadh tha unka thint pratinidhiyon se vaarta karnaa or milanaa or anya maamle jiskaa ullekh main kar chukaa hum
 sakshya ke niyam die jane ke kaaran adaalat is nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya he jo us paksh ke hit ke liye sabase kam anukool he jinke paas tathyon kaa vishesh gyaan he
 This is certainly more prevalent than the political interference of "clues or suggestions" mentioned in the Yengeni case
 yah ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he ki is tarah kii prakriya, nae dakshin africa main ghatit hui or isane rangabhed shashan ke antargat vinaash ko prerit kiya
 " sunwaayee se pehle zuma ke samarthakon kii ore se dakshin africa nyaaypalika kii khub aalochana kii gai
 In this context, the irony was that the South African judiciary was found in favor of Zuma for the third time, including acquittal of the rape charges leveled against him
 NDPP ne jald hi is nirnay ke khilaaf apil karne ke apane iraade kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court to appeal the decision of Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson: mujhase sambandhit aise doorgaami "afasosjanak, pariwadaatmak or pratikul" nishkarsh nikalnaa or zuma maamle ke un nishkarshon ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa or ninda karnaa adaalat ke liye anuchit tha
 My absolute request is that the defense of the interests of justice is in improving the matter
 in pratikul nishkarshon ne mere ANC party dwaara meraa naam waapas liye jane ko falit kiya - yah ek aisa nivedan tha jise maine pichley 52 varshon se ANC kaa ek patibaddh or vafaadaar sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya

 pehla pahalu tha ki kya zuma ko is baat kaa adhikaar tha ki ve NPA ke samaksh abhyavedan karne ke liye aamantrit kiye jaayen wo bhi unke khilaaf rishwat or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko waapas liye jane kaa nirnay liye jane se pehle
 doosraa pahalu yah tha ki kya nyaayadhish nikholson zuma par ilzaam lagaae jane ke NPA ke nirnay ke sandarbh main tatkaaleen raashtrapati thabo mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ko samajhane main sahi the
 On the question of inviting representations during the review of the npa's decision, Harms DP found that the interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution given by Nicholson was incorrect because the NPA had no such obligation and was therefore free to accuse Zuma, He has done
 nikholson ke mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ke vishay main die gaye tark ke sawaal par, harms deepi ne paaya ki "nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he"
 On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority, in light of the new revelation of serious flaws in the prosecution, withdrew all charges against Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thint
 yah rahasyodghatan phone vaarta ke tukdon ke rup main the jo yah dikhaate the ki scorpian ke adhyaksh, lionard maikaarthi or saarvajanik abhiyojan ke purv rashtriya nideshak, bulilani ngakuka ne zuma par abhiyog chalaae jane ke samay ko lekar saazish rachi thi, jo sambhavyatah zuma ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi, raashtrapati thabo mabek ke raajnneetik laabh ke liye tha
 The withdrawal of the charge was announced by the acting president of the NPA, Mokothedi Empshe, who insisted that the withdrawal of the charges was due to abuses that made the legal process "tainted" and not equal to acquittal
 NPA kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad, haalanki, kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon ne suchit kiya ki aaropon ko waapas liye jane kii sthiti main ve apane se kanoonee karrwai par vichaar karenge
 The Democratic Alliance subsequently filed an appeal to conduct a judicial review of the npa's decision, with reference to his party leader Helen Zilla clarifying that Ampshey "did not make decisions based on the law, but was bound by political pressure" 
 On 9 June 2009, the day of hearing of the case was fixed
 jabaki zuma ne apni pratikriya ko kalochit rup se daayar kiya, ampshe ne maamle kii sunwaayee main deree kii, jisamen unhone NPA kii pratikriya ko pesh karne ke liye do vistaaran kaa anurodh kiya
 NPA spokesman Muthunzi Mahaga said they would not file papers because there are "outstanding cases" that are yet to be resolved
 democratic elliance party pramukh jile ne tark diya ki zuma kii pratikriya moulik rup se galat he or "unamem koi sanvaidhanik aadhaar nahin hai"
 jabaki kanoonee chunautiyaan jari rahi, june 2009 ko hue ek surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki, aadhe se zyada dakshin africa yah maanate hai ki raashtrapati jacob zuma acha kaam kar rahe hai
 The poll conducted by TNS Research Studies in late June 2009 showed that Zuma's approval level had steadily improved
 surveykshan main shaamil logon main se lagbhag 57% ne kaha ki ve sochate hai ki zuma ek sakasham netaa hai - yah taadaad april 2009 main raashtrapati ke naam udghaatan ke mukaable 3% tak adhik thi
 In November 2008, just a few months after former President Thabo Mbeki was withdrawn and Zuma faced corruption charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him

 The alleged victim belonged to an important ANC family, was the daughter of a close associate of Zuma's struggle days and was an AIDS activist believed to be HIV positive
 zuma ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya or daawa kiya ki yah yon sambandh aapasi sahmati se bana tha
 Even before the charges were filed, as rumors about rape allegations erupted in November, Zuma's political prospects seemed to be on the decline
 unke ucch str ke adhikansh raajnneetik samarthakon ne in nae aaropon ke sandarbh main us tarah se pratikriya nahin di jis tarah se unhone bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf di thi
 In a hearing before the rape trial, crowds of thousands of his supporters gathered before the court, while small anti-rape groups demonstrated for the alleged rape victim
 jaise kii zuma ne mukademe ke dauraan kiya, ve bheed ke saath lethu masini vami gaate rahe or ANC yuva lig or balm panthi party yuva lig ke pravaktaa ne zuma ke samarthan main baat kii
 As the rape trial progressed, reports surfaced that the South African left wing contingent differed on how to address Zuma's case and the sacp's relationship with him
 Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while other members of the SACP were skeptical about the value of performing for a particular person against important principles of governance
 kuch purv samarthakon ke dalbadal lene ke baavjood, kai zuma samarthakon ne adaalat ke baahar pradarshan karnaa jari rakhaa, abhiyokta kii akhandta or naitikta par nirantar pratighaat karne, abhiyokta ke ek kareebi dost par apshabd oochhaalane or abhiyokta samaj kar kisi anya mahila par pathar phenkane jaise krityon ne balaatkaar virdohi samoohon kii aalochana ko badhaava diya
 Zuma's defense team presented evidence relating to the victim's sexual past and insisted that the physical relationship was with both consent
 abhiyojan paksh ne is baat par jor diya ki us mahila kaa pratirodh naa karnaa uske sadame kii sthiti main hone ke kaaran tha or un donon ke bich kaa sambandh pita putree ke sambandh jaisaa tha
 The lawsuit also sparked a political controversy when Zuma, who at the time was heading the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman accused of rape, knowing that Also that she was HIV positive
 unhone adaalat main yah kaha ki "HIV sankraman ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye" uske turant baad unhone snaan kar liya
 The statement was condemned by the judge, health experts and AIDS activists
 dakshin africa kii lokapriy comic strip, madam or eve or jane maane raajnneetik cartoonist zapiro ne is maamle kaa mazaaq udaaya
 HIV kii shiksha dene waalon ne jor diya ki yah HIV sankraman ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar paayegaa
 On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma innocent and Zuma agreed that the sexual act surrounded by the questions was consensual
 nyaayadhish vine dar marave ne abhiyokta ko adaalat main jhooth bolne ke liye buree tarah se fatkaaraa, lekin zuma ko bhi apni laaparvaahee ke liye doshi tehraaya
 When his rape case ended, many South Africans wondered how to fill the gaps created by Zuma's trial in his political system
 An analysis by Mel & Guardian described these incidents as particularly disturbing: phir bhi, balaatkaar mukademe ke khatm ho jane ke baad, bijness de kii krima brown ne di gargian ko bataaya "jacob zuma waapas aa gaye hai
 This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership
 ab zuma waapas luthuli house kii ore agrasar hai
 ] They will demand to be reinstated back to the post of vice president and others will find it difficult to block their way 


 This is a major victory for Zuma's political career
 " The prospect of Zuma's return as a contender for the presidency became a cause for concern for international investors
 ek swatantra vishleshak ne suzav diya, "haalia surveykshanon ke anusaar, zuma or unke mashin gan chalaanevaale kafile ko union building kii ore badate hue dekhnaa mukhyatah madhyam varg or vyapaariyon ko hatotsahit karne vaala he

 The support of these organizations remained even when Zuma was facing allegations of corruption

 Zuma's dismissal was interpreted in two ways
 kai antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ne iskaa swaagat ek spasht sanket ke rup main kiya ki dakshin africa sarkaar apane bhitari rankon se bhrashtachar ko ukhaad fankne ke liye samarpit he
 On the other hand, some people in South Africa highlighted the fact that Zuma and Mbeki represent two different constituencies in the African National Congress
 kuch vampanthi samarthakon ne daawa kiya ki mabek or unka bazaar-unmukhi paksh ANC main apana varchasv kaayam rakhane ke uddheshy se zuma ko baahar nikalne kii sajeesh kar rahaa hai
 In 2005, each of Zuma's court appearances related to corruption was crowded by a large number of his supporters

 On the next court date in November, thousands of Zuma supporters gathered to support him; Zuma addressed the Durban crowd in the Zulu language and appealed to them to maintain the unity of the party and sang the song Lethu Machines Vami of the apartheid struggle, which literally translates to the words "meri machine me la" It is understood in the context of machine guns
 oktober main ANC yuva lig ke liye ek daure main desh main kisi anya jagah zuma ne ek badi bheed kii vaahvahee jiti
 While at least a partial of his political power is based on inter-party relations, one analyst argued that the loyalty of his supporters was rooted in the Zulu approach to loyalty and mutual aid

 In November 2005, a panel of assembled analysts agreed that it would be difficult for any other possible ANC candidate to defeat Zuma in the country's presidential race in 2009, if Zuma is found innocent on corruption charges

 However, the Balm section of the party and additional party organizations such as the ANC Youth League, South African Balm Panthi Party and South African Trade Union Congress have advocated a strong stand on Zimbabwe

 Zuma's stance on Zimbabwe was mixed
 2006 main german patrika der spigel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone mugabe ke prati bhaavnaatmak sahanubhuti vyakt karte hue kaha ki "europea aksar is tathy kii andekhi karte hai ki mugabe africaiyon ke bich bahut lokapriy hai
 In his eyes, he got the blacks back to their country after centuries of colonialism
 "he added that" people love them, so how can we condemn them? Many in Africa believe that there is a racist aspect in the criticism of Mugabe by Europeans and Americans
 angola, congou ganraajya or rwanda main lakhon ashwet maare gaye
 Western countries have already become dissatisfied due to the unfortunate death of some Europeans in Zimbabwe
 " However, until December 2007, he was more forthright in criticizing the leadership of Zimbabwe, under which he defined his policies in more contrast with Mbeki's policies: yah or bhi dukhad he ki anya vishwa ke anya netaaon jinhonen daman dekha he yah bahaanaa karte hai ki aisa kabhi hua hi nahin, yaa yah atishyoktipurna he
 When history finally discusses the dictators, then those who stand by the side and see the spectacle should also bear the consequences
 a shameful quality of the modern world is to look back on injustice and ignore the difficulties of others

 Rebuffing the rabid media behind her rape lawsuit, Zuma filed a defamation suit against South African media on June 30, 2006 for smearing her public image in the form of cartoons, comments, photos and parodies

 main use maar kar gira detaa
" The Joint Working Group questioned Zuma's leadership skills and said that a "true leader reigns with wisdom and wisdom - not by popularity or favor
 To lead such a narrow minded person to lead our nation" How can i expect? "zuma later apologized to everyone he offended by his statement, saying," i belong to those gay brothers and sisters

 " It was not even long before the NPA withdrew the charges against him that Zuma was once again surrounded by controversies

 ghatnakriyashastra ke anusaar agar in karkon ko anubhav se alag kar diya jaae to gyaan ke dharaatal par ek vishuddh aatmanishthata praapt kii ja sakati he
 German philosopher Edmund Husser was the founder of this philosophy
 unka kahana tha ki sabhi tarah kii chetana hameshaa sabhipraay yaa iradatan hoti he
 That is, we are not only conscious, but conscious of something
 zaruri nahin ki us vastu kaa bhautik vajood ho hi
 For example, if someone feels that an oasis is present in front of her, then she can also be a patient
 asal main vah nachlistaan vastav main nazar ke saamne na hone ke baavjood dekhne vaale ke liye uske saath banaaye gayi sarthak sambandh ke kaaran abhasith hota he
 Therefore, whether it is oasis or its malaise, the object is able to fulfill the expectations made by her observer
 isse hasar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki vyakti kaa anubhav vastu ke saath kaary-kaaran sambandh kaa mohataaj nahin hota
 The development of phenomenology greatly influenced sociological and artistic thinking along with philosophy
 hasar ke sahaayak or mahaan darshanik martin hidagar is avadharana ko astitv ke taatpary or maanviya vajood kii sanrachana ko samajhane kii disha main le gayi
 In addition to Heidegger, the thinking of Maurice marli-ponty, jean-paul Sartre was also influenced by phenomenology
 isi aadhaar par alfred shuz dwaara finomenoljical sosiolji kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Phenomenology has developed by communicating with the basic principles of natural sciences

 To say that Dekart and Hassar had the same intellectual project
 donon hi gyaan ke muladharon ko anischitataaon se mukt karnaa chaahate the
 But this interpretation of Hassar took the philosophy from Dekart towards the next stage
 unka uddeshy anubhavgat vastuon ko dekhne kaa ek anivaary or nishchit tarika viksit karne kaa tha
 Dekart believed that the existence of God and self cannot be doubted, but it is logically possible to doubt everything else
 lekin hasar kisi vishwaas yaa aasthaa par sanshay karne cabajaay uski prakruti main nihit asandigdh tatva kii shinaakht karne kii taraf gayi
 He tried to find out what is the pre-conceived component of the experience of an object by examining every action of consciousness
 is purv-kalpit hisse ko bina uske sahi yaa galat hone kaa faisalaa kiye agar kinare rakh diya jaae to us anubhav kii sachai par koi fark nahin padegaa
 Hassar termed the act of keeping the edge in his language as 'bracketing' and not taking the decision of right or wrong
 unhone ek vriksh kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki agar kisi vriksh ke hone se judi rozmarra kii purvadhaaran ko multavee kar diya jaae to usase vriksh-sambandhi us anubhav main tabdili nahin aayegi jo chetana ke madhyam se praapt kiya gaya he
 Dekart's thesis stops at the place where they consider the existence of 'I' to be at least a definite basis of doubt or knowledge
 hasar ne kisi ke hone ke anubhav ko usamen nihit purv-kalpanaaon se mukt karne kii tajaviz kii
 This was a radical step in the field of contemplation
 vastu ke anubhav ke saath judi pehle se bani samaj ke aadhaar main aitihaasik, saanskrithik or bhautik kaarak hote hai jinaki pramanikta hameshaa andeh ke daayre main rahati he
 If a true understanding of an object or person is to be made, it should not be understood as a historical shay, because in that case that understanding will be filtered through the filters of preconceptions and pre-conceptions
 is tarah ghatnakriyashastra ke rup main ek vishuddh or aparivartaneey aatmanishthata kaa nishchit gyaan praapt karne kii vidhi saamne aayi
 Hassar's two works, Logical Investigations and Ideas Protecting to a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy, published between 1901 and 1913, are considered to be the major texts of this philosophy
 gyaan ke is prabhaavshaalee siddhant kii pramukh samasya yah thi ki use darshanikon kaa mohataaj hone kii seemaa se kaise nikaala jaae
 It was difficult to establish as a natural tendency to create knowledge in the world of everyday community life and culture
 1938 main prakashit apni antim rachana chrysis of european science and trancedental finominolji main hasar ne is samasya kaa hal khojane kii koshish kii
 He strongly criticized the principled approach of natural sciences and kept it against the subjective attitude
 unka kahana tha ki prakritik vigyaan kaary-kaaran sambandh or maatraatmakataa par itnaa jor dete hai ki vyakti kii bhinn-bhinn preranaon, aasthaaon or kaamanaayon kaa unke liye koi mahatva hi nahin rah jaataa
 He further developed the thesis of being aware of consciousness, that on the basis of different attitudes people make sense of their world
 saundaryashastra ke kshetra main hasar or ghatnakriyashastra kaa prabhaav roman ingarden ke sutrikarnon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Enggarden refuses to identify the literary work as an intentional object on the basis of its physical element
 is vichaar ke anusaar saahitiyik kriti apni vividh vyakhyaaon se swatantra ek tikaoo kism kii asmita se sampann hoti he
 Criticizing the work, the reader pays attention to its essence and in the process draws concrete conclusions from the content of the imagined elements that have been left undetermined by the author
 ghatnakriyashastra ke buniyadi thisis se prabhavit hasar ke anuyaayiyon ne unke bhavvaadi ravaiye ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Heidegger and then Sartre focused their attention on an observer who was concerned with a real, physical and tactical world, compared to the more or less intangible existence of the observer whose experience centered on philosophy
 hasar anubhav ke taatpary ko ek anivaary or saarvbhaum saar ke rup main dekhte the, jabaki hidagar ne us taatpary ko zindagi kii vyaavhaarik samasyaon se guzarane ke dauraan hone vaale anubhav kaa nateeja bataaya
 Heidegger said that humans make sense of the hammer according to what they use

 unhen unke jeevankaal ke dauraan sabase mahaan jivit kalakaar mana jaataa tha, uske baad se unhen sarvakaleen mahanatam kalakaaron main se ek ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 His versatility in many disciplines is considered to be of a very high level, which is why he is often considered a prime example of Renaissance Yugi thinkers with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici stakeholder, Leonardo da Vinci, despite having few influences outside the field of art
 Let's go

 In fact, two of his biographies were published during his lifetime; One of them, written by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Mikelangelo's work is beyond that of any other dead or living artist and "not only in one art, but superior in all three"
 apane jeevankaal main,maaikel angelo ko aksar "al divino" kaha jaataa tha
 Later artists' attempts to emulate Michelangelo's emotional and highly personal style led to Ménerism, the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance

 During her mother's prolonged illness and after her death in 1481, Michelangelo came to live with her husband in Satagino, who used to carve stones
 satgino main hi unke pita kii ek sangemarmar kii khadaan thi
 In those days, Michelangelo got interested in marble, which Giorgio Vasari quotes: ek yuva ladke ke rup main, maaikel angelo ko florence ke maanavtaavaadi francis da urabino ke tahat vyakaran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Michelangelo showed no interest in his schooling and preferred to copy paintings from churches and live in the association of painters

 In 1488, at the age of 13, he became an apprentice to Grimmandadao
 agle saal, unke pita ne grimandadaao ko ek kalakaar ke rup main maaikel angelo ko bhugtan karne ke liye prerit kiya, jo ek chaudaa varsh ke kalakaar ke liye durlabh tha
 When Lorenzo de 'medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, asked Grimmandao for his two best pupils, Grimmandao sent Michelangelo and Francesco Granacci
 1490 se 1492 tak maaikel angelo ne human academy main bhaag liya jise ki medici ne nav-platonic kii tarj par sthapit kiya tha
 At the academy, both Michelangelo's approach and his art were influenced by many contemporary philosophers and writers, including Marsilio Fascino, Pico della Mirandala and Poliziano
 inhi dinon me maaikel angelo ne "madonna af da steps" va " batal of da sentors" ko gadhaa
 After the death of Lorenzo de 'medici on 8 April 1492, Michelangelo returned to his father's house leaving the Medici House
 1493 or 1499 ke bich unhone sangemarmar kaa ek khand kharida va roman nayak harculis kii pratimaa gadhi, jise france bheja gaya
 On 20 January 1494, after heavy snowfall, Lorenzo's heir, Piero de Medici, ordered an ice sculpture to be made
 is murti ko banane ke liye maaikel angelo medici rajsabha me waapas aaye
 In the same year, the Medici was expelled from Florence as a result of the increasing dominance of Girolamo Savonarola
 maaikel angelo ne raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke ant se pehle shahar chhod diya or pehle venice phir bolona chale gaye
 In Bologna, he was tasked to make several small burnts to complete the tomb of St
 Dominic
 1494 ke ant tak florence kii raajnneetik sthiti shant ho chuki thi
 Michelangelo returned to Florence, but he did not get any new work from the government of Savonarola and started working for the Medici again
 is dauraan unhone "saint jon di baptist" va sote hue "cupid" naam kii do murtiyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Lorenzo asked Michelangelo to make "st

 murti ke graahak refaile riario ko murti ke nakli hone kaa pataa chalane par usne maaikel angelo kii rachana se prabhavit ho kar unhai rome aamantrit kiya
 Michelangelo arrived in Rome on 25 June 1496 at the age of 21
 usee varsh 4 july ko, unhone refaile riario ke liye ek ayog par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya, jo roman wine ishwar baikas kii ek badhi murti thi
 In November 1497, Jean de bilhares-lagrulas entrusted him with the task of producing "pieta"
 "pieta" me "virgin meri" ko yishu ke shav ke saamne shok manaate huai dikhaaya gaya he
 Michelangelo was 24 years old when "pieta" was released
 ise sheeghra hi murtikla kii duniya kii mahaan kritiyon main se ek mana jane laga
 Vasari summarized contemporary opinion: yah ab "saint peter kii basilica" main sthit he
 Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499

 1505 main, maaikel angelo ko nae nirvaachit pope julius dwitiya dwaara rome main waapas aamantrit kiya gaya tha or pope ke makbare ke nirmaan kaa aadesh kiya gaya tha, jisamen chalis murtiyon ko shaamil karnaa tha or paanch varshon main puraa karnaa tha
 Under the pope's patronage, Michelangelo faced frequent interruptions to his work at the tomb to carry out many other tasks
 haalanki maaikel angelo ne makbaraper 40 saal tak kaam kiya tha, lekin yah unki santushti ke liye kabhi bhi samaapt nahin hua tha
 It is located in the Church of San Pietro Church in Vincoli in Rome and is most famous for the central figure of the mosses built in 1516
 usee avadhi ke dauraan, maaikel angelo ne cystin chapel kii chat ko chitrit kiya, jisane puraa karne ke liye lagbhag chaar varsh puure kiye 
 According to Condivi, Bramante, who was working on the construction of the Basilica of St
 Peter, disagreed with the work of the Pope's mausoleum for Michelangelo
 usne pope ko ek madhyam main maaikel angelo ko kaam karne ke liye aashwast kiya gaya jiske saath maaikel angelo aparichit tha
 Michelangelo inspired Pope Julius to let him work independently and proposed a different and more complex plan composed of "creation", "the Fall of Man," and "genealogy of Christ"
 yah kaam chapel ke andar sajaavat kii ek badi yojana kaa hissaa he jo catholic carch ke siddhanton kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 a digital signature or digital signature scheme is a mathematical scheme to denote the authenticity of a digital message or document
 ek maanya digital hastakshar, praptakarta ko yah vishwaas dilaataa he ki sandesh kisi gyaat preshak dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha or use pargaman main badla nahin gaya tha
 Digital signatures are commonly used in software distribution, financial transactions, and other such cases where counterfeiting and tampering detection is more important
 digital hastakshar kaa istemaal aksar electronic hastakshar karyanvit karne ke liye hota he, jo ki ek aisa vyapak shabd he jiskaa sandarbh aise kisi electronic data se he, jo hastakshar ke uddeshy ko saath liye hota he, lekin sabhi electranik hastakshron main digital hastakshar kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa
 sanyukt rajya america sahit kuch deshon or europea sangh main, electronic hastakshron kaa kanoonee mahatv he
 However, the laws relating to electronic signatures do not always clarify whether they are used here in the sense of digital seed-writing signatures and, therefore, their importance, to some extent, is misleading, aside from the legal definition
 digital hastakshar ek prakaar kii asamamit kryptographi lagu karte hai
 a properly implemented digital signature, transmitted from an unsecured channel, assures the recipient that the message was sent by a well-known sender
 kai myanon main digital hastakshar paaramparik hastlikhit hastakshar ke baraabar hai; uchit rup se karyanvit digital hastakshar ke saath jaalsaaji, hastlikhit qism kii tulana main kathin he
 In the sense used here, digital signature systems are secretly based and can only be effective if implemented properly
 digital hastakshar gair-asveekaran bhi pradaan kar sakate hai, yani hastaksharkarta safaltaapurvak yah daawa nahin kar saktaa he ki usne sandesh par hastakshar nahin kiye hai, jabaki saath main yah daawa ho ki unki nijee kunjee gopneey he; saath hi, kuch gair-asveekaran pranaliyaan digital hastakshar ke liye samay kii muhar pesh karti hai, taaki nijee kunjee ke ujagar ho jane par, hastakshar phir bhi maanya rahata he
 Digitally signed messages can be anything representable as bitstrings: Examples include messages transmitted via electronic mail, contracts, or any other secret protocol
 ek digital hastakshar pranali main vishishtatah teen elgoridam hote hai: Two main features are required
 pehle, ek nishchit sandesh or nirdhaarit nijee kunjee se utpann hastakshar dwaara, sandesh tathaa anuroop saarvajanik kunjee ko satyapit karnaa chahie
 Secondly, it should be impractical to generate a valid signature for a party that does not compute a private key
 1976 main, whitefield difphi or martin hellman ne sabase pehle ek digital hastakshar pranali kii dharna ko varnit kiya, haalanki unhone keval anumaan lagaaya ki aisi pranali kaa astitv ho saktaa he
 Soon thereafter, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Edleman invented the RSA algorithm, which could be used for primitive digital signatures
 sarvapratham vyapak rup se bazaar main digital hastakshar ke liye software package bechney kii peshkash karne vaala tha lotus nots 1
0, jo 1989 main jari hua, jisamen RSA elgoridam kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The basic RSA signatures are computed as follows
 RSA hastakshar kunjee utpann karne ke liye, bas modulus n yukt RSA kunjee yugma ko janit karnaa hoga, jo do badi abhajya sankhya kaa gunanfal ho, jiske saath purnank e or d kuch aise hon ki e d = 1 mod φ, jahaan φ ular faai-phalnak he
 The signer's public key will include n and e and the signer's secret key will include d
 sandesh m par hastakshar karne ke liye, hastaksharkarta pariklit karata he σ=m d mod n 
 satyapit karne ke liye praptakarta jaanchataa he ki σe = m mod n he
 As mentioned earlier, this basic system is not very secure
 hamalon ko rokane ke liye, pehle sandesh m ko gopneey hesh phalnak lagu kar sakate hai or phir fal ke liye upar varnit RSA elgoridam lagu kar sakate hai
 This access can be proven to be safe in so-called randomized authentic models
 RSA ke baad anya digital hastakshar pranaliyaan viksit kii gai thim, jinamein praarambhik tha lamport hastakshar, merkal hastakshar or robin hastakshar
 In 1984, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Ronald Rivest first defined the security requirements of digital signature schemes as accurate
 unhone hastakshar pranaaliyon ke liye aakraamak modelon ke padanukram ko varnit kiya or GMR hastakshar yojana ko prastut kiya, aisa pehla, jo kisi chuninda sandesh hamale ke prati ek astitvatmak jaalsaji ko bhi rokane main samarth ke rup main sabit ho saktaa tha
 The earliest early signature systems were the same: they included the use of decoding permutations, such as the RSA function, or in the case of the Rabin signature scheme, square relative joint n calculations
 a codewise permutation family is a family of permutations, specified by a parameter that is easy to calculate in the posterior direction, but difficult to calculate in the reverse direction
 tathaapi, prayek prachal ke liye ek "kuutadwar" maujuud he, jo ulti disha main aasaan pariklan ko sakasham banaata he
 The encryption sequence can be seen as a public-key encryption system, where the parameter is the public key and the encryption is the secret key, and where encryption corresponds to the calculation of the serialization in the forward direction, while the decryption is from the opposite direction
 Corresponds
 kuutadwara kram-parivartanon ko digital hastakshar pranaaliyon ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan gupt kunjee ke saath vipareet disha main pariklan ko hastakshar mana jaataa he or aage kii disha main pariklan hastakshar ko satyapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Because of this compatibility, digital signatures are often described as based on public-key confidential systems, where signature is equivalent to decryption and verification is equivalent to encryption, but digital signature is not the only method of calculation
 sidhe prayukt kiye jane par, is qism kii hastakshar pranali, kunjee-maatr astitvatmak jaalsaji hamale ke prati asurakshit he
 To commit forgery, the attacker chooses a random signature σ and uses the validation process to find out the message m that matches that signature
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, is prakaar ke hastakshar kaa sidhe prayog nahin kiya jaataa, balki, hastakshar kiye jane vaale sandesh ko pehle laghu sankshep utpann karne ke liye khandit kiya jaataa he
 This forgery attack, then, issues only hash functions, which correspond to σ, and not a message, leading to a value that does not lead to an attack
 yadrichhik pramanik model main, hastakshar ke is hesh or dicript rup ke saath astitvatmak taur par jaalsaji nahin kii ja sakati, bhale hi chuninda-sandesh hamalaa hi kyon naa ho
 There are several reasons for signing this type of hash, rather than the entire document
 apane moolbhoot dastauez main, goldvasar, mikaali or revest ne digital hastakshar ke khilaaf aakraamak modelon ke padanukram ko pesh kiya: He also described a hierarchy of attack outcomes: isliye, suraksha kii kadi dharna, ek anukuli chuninda sandesh hamale ke antargat astitvatmak jaalsaji ke khilaaf suraksha he
 Some common reasons for implementing digital signature for communication are presented below: haalanki sandeshon par aksar sandesh bhejne vaale ke astitv kii jaankaree shaamil ho sakati he, lekan vah jaankaree sahi nahin bhi ho sakati he
 Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of a message
 jab kisi digital hastakshar kii gupt kunjee kaa swaamitv kisi vishisht prayokta ko preshit hota he, to vaid hastakshar se pataa chalata he ki sandesh us upyogkarta dwaara bheja gaya tha
 The importance of high confidence in the sender's authenticity is particularly evident in the financial context
 udhaaharan ke liye, maan len ki kisi bank kii shakha dwaara kendriya karyaalay ko khate main sheshrashi main parivartan karne kaa anurodh karte hue anudesh bheja jaataa he
 If the central office is not convinced that such a message has actually been sent from an authorized source, then action on such a request could be a big mistake
 kai sthitiyon main, sandesh ke preshak or praptakarta ko is baat ke vishwaas kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he ki preshan ke dauraan sandesh ko badla nahin gaya he
 Although encryption hides the content of the message, it may be possible to change it without understanding the encrypted message
 phir bhi, agar sandesh par digital hastakshar kiya gaya he, to hastakshar ke baad sandesh main kiya gaya koi bhi badlaav, hastakshar ko amaanya karegaa
 Furthermore, to generate a new message with a valid signature, no efficient way to modify the message or its signature exists, as it is still not considered legibly legible by most confidential hash functions
 sabhi saarvajanik kunjee / nijee kunjee gopneey pranaliyaan, nijee kunjee ko gupt rakhane par puri tarah nirbhar karti hai
 a private key can be stored on a user's computer and protected by a local password, but has two disadvantages: ek adhik surakshit vikalp he smart card par nijee kunjee ko sangrahit karnaa
 Many smart cards are designed to be interference-resistant
 ek theth digital hastakshar karyanvayan main, dastauez se pariklit hesh, smart card ko bheja jaataa he, jiskaa CPU upyogkarta ke sangrahit nijee kunjee kaa upyog karte hue hesh ko ancript karata he or phir ancrypted hesh ko lautaata he
 Typically, the user must activate their smart card by entering a personal identification number or PIN code
 yah vyavastha kii ja sakati he ki nijee kunjee smart card se kabhi naa hate, haalanki yah hameshaa lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 If the smart card is stolen, the thief will still need a PIN code to generate a digital signature
 yah pranali kii suraksha ko PIN kii suraksha main gata detaa he, haalanki tab bhi ek hamalavar ke paas card kaa hona zaruri he
 a comforting aspect is that the private key, if generated and stored on a smart card, is generally considered difficult to copy and assumes only one copy exists
 is prakaar, smart card kii gumshudagi ke bare main maalik pataa laga saktaa he or tatsambandhi pramaan-patr ko turant radd kiya ja saktaa he
 Private keys that are protected only by software may be easier to duplicate, and such risks are more difficult to detect
 smart card sakriy karne hetu PIN code darj karne ke liye saamanytah ek sankhyatmak kii-pad kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some card readers have their own numeric keypads
 yah PC main ekikrut card reader or phir us computer ke kii-board kaa upyog karte hue PIN pravisht karne se kahin zyaada surakshit he
 Readers with a numeric keypad are designed to avoid latent hearing distress, where the computer can run a keystroke logger, potentially putting the PIN code at risk
 vishesh card reader bhi unke software yaa hardware main chhedchhad ke prati kam asurakshit hai or aksar EAL3 pramanit hote hai
 Smart card design is an active area and there are smart card systems aimed at avoiding these special problems, although very little evidence of security is in front of them
 ek digital hastakshar or likhit hastakshar ke bich ek mukhya antar yah he ki upyogkarta "dekh" nahin paata ki vah kis par hastakshar kar rahaa he
 The user application introduces a hash code to be encrypted by a digital signing algorithm using a private key
 ek hamalavar jo upyogkarta ke PC par niyantran hasil karata he, sambhawatah upyogkarta ke anuprayog kii jagah kisi videshi anuprayog ko pratisthapit kar saktaa he, yani upyogkarta ke apane sanchaar kii jagah hamalavar ke sanchaar se badal saktaa he
 This can cause a malicious application to trick the user into signing any document, displaying the user's original document on-screen, where the attacker presents their document signing application
 is paridrishy main suraksha ke liye, upyogkarta ke anuprayog or hastakshar kiye jane vaale anuprayog ke bich, ek pramanikaran pranali ko sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 The general intention is to provide a means for both the user application and the signing application to verify each other's integrity
 For example, the signing application might expect all requests to come from digitally signed binaries
 takneekee rup se kahen, to digital hastakshar bits kii string par lagu hota he, jabaki maanav or anuprayog "vishwaas" karte hai ki ve un bits ke arth kii vyakhya par hastakshar kar rahe hai
 To be interpreted semantically the bit string needs to be converted into a form that is meaningful to humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes in a computer system
 samasya yah he ki bits ke arth kii vyakhya, bits ko arth saamagree main badalane kii prakriya ke phalnak ke rup main parivartit ho saktaa he
 It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by applying changes to the computer system on which the document is being processed
 arth ke pariprekshya main isse anischitata saamne aati he ki vastav main kis par hastakshar kiye gaye
 WYSIWYS means that the interpretation of the meaning of a signed message cannot be changed
 vishesh rup se iskaa yah bhi matlab he ki kisi sandesh main aisi gupt jaankaree nahin ho sakati jisase hastakshar karne vaala anjaan he or jo hastakshar lagu kiye jane ke baad zaahir kiya ja saktaa he
 WYSIWYS is a desirable feature of digital signatures, which is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems
 digital hastakshar pranaaliyon main saajha moolbhoot purvapekshaayen yah hai ki - gopneeyata siddhant yaa kanoonee praavdhaan kaa lihaaj kiye bina - unka sarthak hona zaruri he: If all of these conditions are followed, then only the digital signature will actually be a proof of who sent the message, hence their consent to their contents
 maujuuda ejineering sambhaavnaaon kii is sachai ko kaanoon badal nahin saktaa he, haalanki vastav main inamen se kuch parilakshith nahin hue hai
 Legislatures have authorized authority for digital signatures enacting enactments and / or regulations in many areas, by soliciting businesses or technically advanced people who support new solutions to chronic problems, hoping to benefit from pki's operations
 , With confirmation, support and permission, has made arrangements for its legal effect
 kuch udyogon ne, udyog ke sadasyon or niamakon ke bich digital hastakshar ke upyog ke liye saamaanya antar-sanchaalan kshamta maanakon ko sthapit kiya he
 These include the Automotive Network Exchange for the automobile industry and the SAFE bio-pharma Association for the Health Industry
 kai deshon main, digital hastakshar kii sthiti, kuch had tak ek paaramparik kalam or kaagazi hastakshar ke samaan he
 Generally, these provisions mean that digital signatures legally bind the document's signatory to the conditions stated therein
 is kaaran se, praayah yah uchit samajha gaya ki encripting or hastakshar ke liye alag-alag kunjee yugma kaa upyog kiya jaae
 ancripshan kunjee yugma ke upyog dwaara, koi vyakti ek ancrypted vaartalap main bhaag le saktaa he, lekin ancripshan uske dwaara preshit prayek sandesh par kanoonee taur hastakshar nahin karata he
 Only when both parties reach an agreement can they sign the agreement with their signature key and only in that case are they legally bound by the terms of the specific document
 hastakshar karne ke baad, dastauez ko ancrypted link par bheja ja saktaa he

 Some groups of glowing stars divide the sky into different parts
 in taron ke samooh ko taramandal kehete hai
 The entire sky has been divided into 89 constellations and the names of those constellations have been named
 raashichakr ke taramandal bahut prasiddh hai, inaki sangya mesh, vrish aadi he
 The strings of a single constellation are selected in descending order of their visual radiance
 phir taramandal ke naam ke aage greek bhashaa ke akshar rakhkar taron kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, jaise mesh raashi ke sabase chamkile taare kaa namakaran alfatareez kiya gaya he
 In some constellations the number of strings is so high that the number of letters of the Greek alphabet falls short for them
 aise taron ke namakaran ke liye taramandal ke purv latin akshar tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par sankhyaayein likh dete hai
 Some stars are famous for being over-illuminated and their names can be known without reference to the constellations, such as Lubbhak, Magha, Chitra etc
 is prakaar ke namakaran se taron ko pahchaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Some stars appear more bright and some less bright when viewed with empty eyes
 inaki kanti ke unadhiky ke anusaar ham taron ko kai kantimanon main vargit kar lete hai
 The stars are located far away from us
 duuri ke badhane se kam chamkile taare ham dikhaai nahin dete
 Without the aid of a machine, our eyes can see the stars up to the sixth milestone

 From the 200-inch diameter reflecting telescope of Mount Palomar Observatory, we can see up to 23 radiant stars
 kantimaan maapan kaa arth he taare ke prakaash kii tivrata kaa maapan
 Earlier this work was done by the eyes with the help of special types of photometers
 is prakaar gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko drishy kantimaan kehete hai
 Eyes are sensitive to yellow light, so visible yellow and green are the measure of light

 The difference between photographic and visual parameters on yellow sensitive plates with yellow color filters is called character indicator
 isse taron kaa taap gyaat hota he
 The intensity of light is measured by accepting and multiplying the light on current photographic cells
 kantimaan ko maapte samay hamen vayumandal ke prabhaav tathaa taron kii antarvarti dhul tathaa gaison ke prabhaav ko bhi drushti main rakhana padataa he
 Accurate knowledge of radiance helps us to know the distances of stars and many physical substances
 bahut se taron kaa nijee prakaash bahut adhik he, kintu atyaadhik duuri par sthir hone ke kaaran unka drishy kantimaan adhik dikhalaai padataa he
 The true scale can be known only if they are located at equal distance from the subsurface
 samast taron ko 10 parsek kii duuri par kalpit karke gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko nirpeksh kantimaan kehete hai
 If we know the visible radius of the star and its distance, then we can know the absolute radius from the following formula: nirpekshkantimaan drishyakantimaan 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri, parsekon main he
 Opposite: If we know the absolute record, then we can also know the distances of stars
 surya kaa nirpeksh kantimaan 4
7 he
 The radius of a star relative to the sun is called relative radiance
 isamen surya kii kanti 1 maan lee jaati he
 With this type of study, we study the energy obtained by stars, which helps in studying their physical conditions
 na8na In the perfectly clear sky, we do not see more than 3,200 stars of vision aids
 chunki ham akaash ke keval aadhe hisse ko hi dekh pate hai at: chakshudrishy taron kii sankhya 6,500 ke lagbhag he
 In these 1,5 kantimaan se adhik chamkile 20 taare 50 stars up to 2 radiant 3 kantimaan tak chamkile 150 taare hai 4 stars up to 500 radiant tara 5 kantimaan tak chamkile 1500 taare hai The rest of the image is of the sixth record

 This relationship is limited to more bright stars
 kam gallexi main vishaltam doordarshee dwaara gyaat taron kii sankhya lagbhag 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000 he
 To find the true speed and movement of a star, we divide its speed into two parts
 drushtisutra par lamb disha kii gati ke koniya maan ko taare kii nijee gati kehete hai
 Personal speeds of stars are less
 unhen gyaat karne ke liye hamen bahut doorvarti kaalon main liye gaye taron ke photographon kii tulana kerani padati he
 The stars that are closest to us move back and forth relative to distant stars
 is koniya maan ko kaal ke antaraal se bhaag dene par nijee gati gyaat ho jaati hai
 The asterisks of the direction of this angular sight is called the radial velocity
 traigy veg jaanane ke liye ham varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se taare kaa varnakram le lete hai
 If the spectral lines move towards the blue end, then we know with the help of the Doppler principle that the star is coming towards us and, if the spectral lines are towards the red end, it is moving away from us
 rekhaon kaa sthanantaran unke tragyveg kaa anukramanupati hota he
 Benard has known the personal speed of the star of a dashing radius of the Ophiucus planetarium at 10
3 per year, which is the largest
 nijee gati kaa gyaan tarapunjon ke adhyayan main sahaayak hota he tathaa isse ham yah bhi jaan jate hai ki adhik neeli gati ke taare apekshaakrit hamaare nikat hai
 To understand the radius of the velocity relative to the Sun, we also have to take into account the speed of the Earth
 nijee gati tathaa traigy veg ke gyaan se bal-samaantar-chaturbhuj ke siddhant dwaara vaastavik gati tathaa uski disha gyaat ho jaati he
 Trigonometric methods are used to find distances of stars
 hamase ati sameep tara bhi itani duuri par he ki yadi ham prithvi ke vyas ko aadhaar maanakar uski dishaao ko dekhen to ve samaantar prathit hotin hai, arthath taare kaa lamban shunya hi aata he
 Therefore, to find the parallax of stars, we need a larger base
 at: prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas ko ham aadhaar banaate hai
 If we observe a star's direction six months after its perforation, we get the basis of the diameter of the earth's orbit
 is prakaar ke vedh se samipsth taare duurastha taron ke saapeksh thodaa dik parivartan dikhalaate hai
 While extracting this, we also have to consider the effect of the personal motion of the star
 to bhi yah itnaa kam he ki nikatatam taare kaa lamban 76 he
 If a star has a parallax of 1, it is 2,06,265 times the radius of the Earth's orbit from Earth
 is duuri ko ek parsek kehete he
 Another unit used to measure distance is the light year
 prakaash kaa veg 1,86,000 mile prati second he
 The distance that light travels in a year with this velocity is called a light year, this distance is about 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 miles

 By trigonometric method we can only find the distances of the most proximal wires
 at: doorvarti taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye hamen anya vidhiyon kaa aashray lenaa padataa he
 If we can somehow know the absolute record of stars, then we can find their distances with the help of the formula given in the title Absolute Record
 saubhaahgya se hamen sefiid tathaa lira varg ke taare uplabdh hai, jinke nirpeksh kantimaan ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 The following are other methods of finding the perpendiculars of stars: in vargikarnon kaa nijee mahatv he or inase hamen taron ke vishleshan main vishesh sahaayta milti he
 The following is a brief introduction to these classifications: surya hamaara nikatatam tara he, jiskaa ham bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kar sakate hai
 Most stars are available to us by studying the elements of stars, which were born around the same time as our Sun
 ye taare taap, aakaar tathaa kanti ke avaroh anukram main hai
 This class is called the main sequence
 isamen atyaadhik taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar kaa lagbhag dashamansh hoga
 The Sun is a medium-sized star of this sequence, whose mass and temperature are below average
 mukhya anukram ke vakr main upar kii ore taare atyant viral hai
 Most of the stars in this sequence are smaller than the Sun and warmer
 inamen uplabdh tatwon kii maatra surya jaisi he
 From the study of the Sun, we have two more main classes of stars in addition to this class: there are three main differences of the Danvar stars
 daanavaakar, tathaa vamanakaar taare
 The three main differences of donor stars - demonetisation, extreme donor and donor
 atidanavaakar taare aakaar main bahut vishaal hote hai
 For example, the diameter of Jyestha is about 300 times the diameter of the Sun
 daanavaakar taron main khagaashv ke dwitiya beta pigasi kaa vyas surya ke vyas se 170 guna tathaa brahmahruday kaa, surya ke vyas se, 12 guna he
 The sublingual stars lie between the main sequence and the star of the demon class
 vamanakaar taron ke bhi vaaman, upwaman, lalarang vaaman tathaa shwet-vaaman bhed hai
 White left-wing stars have special significance in these sections
 inaki visheshta yah he ki inaki dravyamatra madhya shrenee kii tathaa kanti kam hoti he, kintu inkaa aakaar bahut chota tathaa inkaa ghanatv atyant adhik hota he
 Of the many stars we see, there are a large number of stars, which are members of our Galaxy
 hamaari gallexi apane main ek vishwa he
 Its shape is spiral
 bahut se anya taravishwa bhi hai, jinka aakaar sarpil he
 To study their composition and shape, we get help from the study of some special types of stars of our Akashganga
 in taron ke gukhyat: do varg hai
 Some stars are always available in the spiral arms of the Galaxy and others are found near the nucleus of the Galaxy
 inamen pratham varg ke taare hamaare surya ke nikat padosi hai tathaa duusare varg ke taare surya se dur hai
 Walter Wade named the stars of the first class as the first star series, or population first, and the stars of the second class named the second star series, or population second
 in donon prakaar ke taravargo ke varnakram-kanti-vakron main bhinnata hoti he
 The very bright stars of the first star are blue and have an absolute radius of 7 or 8, while the bright stars of the second star are red and have an absolute radius of 3 or more
 pratham tarashrenee ke taron main taron kii antarvarti gas tathaa dhul atyadhik maatra main he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke taron main yah atyant kam maatra main he
 The study of these stars gives us not only to determine the spiral arms and nuclei of galaxies, but they also help us to study the origin and evolution of stars
 taron kii dravyamatra ke anu, jo mulavastha main udasin rahete hai, taap main uttarotar vruddhi hone ke kaaran ynikrut hokar apane rin vidyutkanon ko adhikadhik maatra main khone lagate hai
 Due to this effect, there are variations in the bright and black lines formed in the spectrum of such stars
 duusare shabdon main rekhaayen taron ke prakaash vikeern karanevaale anuon ke taap kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii dyotak hai
 Thus, their main 10 distinctions have been made by the study of the spectrum of stars, which are expressed by the capital letters O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and s of the Roman script
 chunki varnakram vargeekaran kaa taap se sambandh he, at: ek hi varg ke taara ke taap main uttarottar hraas bataane ki liye o varnakram ke taron ke liye o ke baad angraji varnmaala ke chote e se i tak ke varna rakh die jate hai tathaa o, oba aadi
 To express a similar intent, the digits from b to m are numbered from 0 to 9, followed by their indicator letters
 ye ynikrut helium vaale taare hai
 The lines of ionized helium and double triple ionized oxygen and nitrogen are found in their spectrum
 is ynikrut avasthaa ke anusaar iskaa prishthiya taap 30, xxrep 4 0 se lekar 40, xxrep 4 0 sein0 tak athwa isse bhi adhik hona chahie
 o The number of known stars of the spectrum is not more than hundred, in which most cannot be seen with naked eyes
 is varg ke teen taare, gamma belorum oe,, jita papsis oe tathaa jitaorin, oi5 chakshu drukshya hai
 These are neutral helium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 25,000° se 12,000° sein0 tak rahata he
 Although this heat is unable to ionize helium, ionized oxygen lines are available in its spectrum
 bi5 taare se lekar nimnatar taap ke taron main helium tathaa ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen kam hone lagati hai or varnakram ke begni bhaag kii or hidrogen rekhaayen tathaa hidrogen kii chaudee kaali avasorana rekhaayen ubhar aati he
 There are many stars in our stars

 Their surface temperature ranges from 12,000 ° c to 8,000 ° C
 inaki sankhya atyaadhik he
 Some astrologers called them calcium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 8,000° se lekar 6,000° se0 tak hota he
 These are the stars of the Sun's range

 As their number increases, two or three letters may also have to be placed in place of one letter, such as RR Lira etc
 lagbhag 20,000 chal taare gyaat hai tathaa unka niyamit rup se vegh kiya jaataa he
 There are two huge classes of wires: first running outward and second running automatically
 bahyahetuk chal taare grahauakari yugma taare hote hai
 Among them Alugula Tara is famous
 iskaa saamaanya kantimaan 2

 Automatic moving stars can be placed in three categories: vibratory moving, explosive moving and other moving stars
 inamen kuch taron kaa aavartan kaal ek din se bhi kam hota he
 Such stars belong to the RR Lira class
 kuch kaa aavartan kaal 1 se lekar 50 din tak kaa he
 Such stars are stars of the Cepheid class
 kuch taron kaa aavartankaal 100 se lekar 1000 din tak kaa he
 These are called long-term stars
 is varg ke taare laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Some stars are semi-regular, their cycle ranges from 40 to 150 days
 ye taare bhi laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Among these, RR Lyra and Cepheid stars are very important
 aar lira taron kaa yah naam isliye padaa ki ye sab gunon main lira taramandal main varnit us chal taare ke samaan hai, jiskaa naam aar aar lira rakhaa gaya
 It should not be understood from the name that such stars occur only in Lyra constellations, but stars in this category are everywhere in our galaxy and other constellations etc
 in taron kii mahatta kii kaaran he inkaa durisuchak hona
 Even when the period of rotation of the stars of RR Lira class does not differ in their absolute value
 iskaa arth yah he ki kisi ek taraguchh tarapranali main aar aar lira taare hon, to ve samaan nirpeksh kantimaan ke honge or yah samaan nirpeksh kantimaan lagbhag shunya ke tulya he
 In such a state, their distance from knowledge of their visual radiance can be known by the following formula
 nirpeksh kantimaan = drishy kantimaan + 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri He got this name because his nature is similar to Delta Cepheus, or Charuth Kapish
 chaturth kapish sefiod varg kaa sarvaadhik chamkila tara he, jise chakshu se dekha ja saktaa he
 The periodicity of cephaid wires ranges from a few days to more than 45 days
 hamaari gallexi ke sefiid taron main 7 din kaa aavartankaal praaia: hota he
 The biggest feature of cepheid stars is to be consistent with the periodic-radius-associative rule
 iskaa arth he ki sefiid taron ke aavartan kaal main jaise jaise vruddhi hoti he vaise vaise unke nirpeksh kantimaan main vruddhi hoti jaati he
 This relationship is very important
 isaki sahaayta se sefiid taron kaa nirpeksh kantimaan jaanakar purv sutara dwaara inaki duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he
 With the help of cepheid stars, the distances of galaxies and starfish are determined
 taapajanit rang ke parivartan kaa kaaran saamanyat: spandan siddhant kalpit kiya gaya he, jiskaa aashay he ki sefiid taron ke tal main aavartan se vruddhi tathaa hraas hota he, jisase tara krmanusaar failata tathaa sikudta rahata he
 In fact, the flutter theory does not provide an accurate answer to all situations
 at: aajkal jyotishi samajhane lage hai ki sefiid taron kii vibhinn sthitiyaan inke taap ke parivartan ke kaaran hai, jiskaa sway ek punrariti chakra he
 More than 1,000 cephoid stars are known
 aise taron main niyamit athwa aniyamit rup se visphot hota he
 These stars are usually extremely foggy, but their radiance increases very exceptionally after an explosion
 yah sthiti kuch din rahane ke baad taare apni kii si saamaanya kanti main aa jate hai
 These types of stars are called Navtara
 1918 i0 ke ekvilla tarapunj ke navtare kii chamak chaar hi din ke bheetar pehle se chalis hajaar guna bad gai thi
 Other famous navataras are: Navtara of the Percuss planetarium, 1925 Victorian Navtara and Navtara of the Hercules planetarium of 1934
 jo navtare visphot ke baad atyant asaadhaaran rup se chamkile ho jate he, unhe atinavtara kehete hai
 In 1885, the supernatural of the Andromeda nebula radiated so much light in six days that the sun would be able to radiate as much light in 10 million years
 anya prakaar ke chal taare praaia: aniyamit aavartankaal ke hai
 On a clean night, some blurred light spots appear in the sky
 yadi ham inhen shaktishaalee yantron se dekhen to inamen teen prakaar kii vastuen milti hai: taare ke guchchhe, niharikas tathaa gallexiyaan
 The nebulae are made up of luminous gases and glaciers are independent galaxies like our Galaxy
 taron ke guchchhe do prakaar ke hai, ek to ve jo akashgangeey samtal main, yaa akashgangeey sarpil bhujaaon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Such flakes are called celestial flakes
 inamen taron kii sankhya apekshkrit kam rahati hai
 In this type of class, the diamond cluster is very bright and large
 golakaar taraguchh sarpil bhujaaon se dur tathaa nabhik ke paas hote hai
 Spherical galaxies have relatively more stars
 ye praaia: ghundle se dikhaai dete hai
 They are seen only through visionaries
 omenga centari tathaa 47 tukane panchal kantimaan ke, chakshudrishy, golakaar taraguchh kaa population dwitiya se sambandh he
 Of course, they have knowledge of the stages of development of stars
 in taron main vidyaman aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taron kii sahaayta se gucchh kii duuri gyaat kii jaati he
 Their study helps a lot in studying the appearance of the Galaxy

 Such stars are called double stars
 aise taare kam hai
 Most stars are actually with one or more stars
 do taare, jo paraspar aakarshan se ek nishichat prakaar ke dirdhavritakar maarg main bhraman karte hai, tara-yugma kehalaate hai
 Having determined that a star is actually a pair, we can know many things about its relationship, because its, or its companion star's, motion follows a broader gravitational law
 yugma taron kii gati tathaa dravyamatra ko nishchit rup se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are mainly three types of pairing: visual, receptive and spectral
 drishy yugmataron kii kaksha kaa gyaan karne ke liye unki duuri tathaa sthiti kone kaa vegh karnaa padataa he
 Most visual pairings have a long rotation period, which requires hundreds of years of weights to detect
 isiilie yadhyapi 25,000 se bhi adhik drishy yugmatare gyaat ho chuke hai, tathaapi 200 se adhik kii kaksha kaa gyaan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 The orbit of the eclipse of the receptive pair often tends to tilt a little in the direction of our line of sight, so that one star covers the other completely or partially, and the light of one star is not visible to us
 isse yugmatare kii pahchaan ho jaati hai, kyonki saamaanya sthiti main is taare kaa jitna prakaash rahata he grahan ke samay pehle kii apeksha kam ho jaataa he
 These eclipses occur from the appointed time
 is tarah ke taron main beta parasyus, arthath algul, ati prasiddh he
 In the normal state, its record is 2
2, leaving 3
4 at the time of eclipse
 grahan ke pashchaat iskaa kantimaan pun: 2
2 ho jaataa he
 The level of the orbit of some of the couriers does not go near the Earth, so we cannot see the position of its eclipse
 kintu uske varnakram kii rekhaon ke parivartan se hamen pataa chal jaataa he ki yah tara kabhi hamaari ore aata tathaa kabhi hamase dur jaataa he, jisase spasht he ki yah kisi adrishy taare ke chaaron ore dhooma rahaa he
 Such stars have a shorter rotation period for spectral pairs
 lagbhag 309 varnakrameey taron kii kakshaayen gyaat ho chuki hai
 The sizes of stars are often known by three methods: nirpeksh kantimaan tathaa taap se, From the eclipse of the receptive couriers and vyatikaranmaapi se
 The first method is based on Planck's following formula: drishy nirpeksh kantimaan Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 Where r = radius of the star
 grahauakari taare ke grahan ke kaal ke vegh se uski kaksha ke saapeksh uski trigya gyaat ho jaati he
 The angular diameter of the star is known by the telemetrometer and by knowing its distance, its simple linear diameter is also known
 taron ke vyas ke aadhaar par hi unke daanavaakar tathaa vamanakaar aadi naam pade hai
 Direct methods for determining the mass of stars are obtained by studying the speed of association of pair wires
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kii sahaayta se in taron kii dravyamatra gyaat kii jaati he
 The drafts of any Vamana star have not been available less than the tithe of the Sun's Drayaamatra, and stars of more than 10 times Drayaamatra from the Sun are also rare
 kisi taare kaa ghanatv = dravyamatra / aaytan
 Thus, it is seen that the density of the Danvar wires is very low and the left side wires are very low
 jyeshta jaise vishaal taare kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa 480 guna he, to bhi isaki dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke 20 gune se adhik nahin
 As a result, its density is less than 
 xxrep 7 0 2 of the Sun's density
 yah saadhaaran hawa ke ghanatv se bhi bahut kam he
 The density of the Svetavaman star Cerium B, whose radius is 
034 of the radius of the Sun and 86 of the mass of the Sun, is so high that one cubic inch of its mass would weigh one ton
 saamanyata photometer kii sahaayta se, taron ke prakaash ke vibhinn rangon ke ghanatv kii prayogshaala main pehle se gyaat tapon ke rangon ke ghanatv se tulana kar, taron ke prishth kaa taap gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But the best method to determine this is spectral analysis of their light
 isi ke aadhaar par taron kaa varnakrameey vargeekaran he, jo vastut: unke taap kaa dyotak he
 Stars derive their energy from nuclear reactions
 taron ke nabhik ke taap ke kaaran taron ke hydrogen ke parmaanu nabhikriya se helium ke parmaanuon main parivartit hote rahete hai
 As a result, excessive heat is produced in the stars, which they radiate as light
 bahut adhik urja utpann karne ke liye inhen atyalp vidyutkan khone padate hai
 Therefore, there is no significant decrease in their volume and their life also becomes millions of years
 taron ke vayumandal kaa adhyayan bhi varnakram kii rekhaon se kiya jaataa he
 We have come to know from the study of the atmosphere of the Sun that it contains excessive amounts of hydrogen
 doosraa sthaan helium kaa he
 Other elements are in small quantities, however magnesium and oxygen atoms certainly exist
 gyaat rasinic tatwon main 61 tatv surya ke vayumandal main pahachaane ja chuke hai
 The atmosphere of most stars is like the Sun, however the atmosphere of all stars is not exactly the same
 inamen carbon tathaa oxigen kii matraaon main antar he
 The basic elements of stars are known by the study of their spectral lines
 prayogshla main vibhinn mul tatwon ke varnakram le liye jate hai tathaa taron ke varnakramon kaa unase milan karke taron main upalabadh mul tatwon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 This type of study has shown that the average stars have about 70 Hydrogen, 28 Helium, 1
5 Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Niran and 0
5 iron group and other heavy elements
 baari tatv population pratham ke taron main lagbhag 3 hote hai tathaa population dwitiya waalon main 1 se bhi kam
 The stars originate from the interstellar gas and dust particles of the stars
 gas ke badalon ke vidyutkan saamanyatya udasin avasthaa main rahete hai, kintu jab koi atyadhik ushn tara inke sameep se jaataa he to ye ynikrut hokar gatisheel ho jate hai tathaa inamen ek nabhik ban jaataa he, jo aasapaas ke gas tathaa dhul ke dravyakanon ko aakrisht karke vishalaroop dhaaran karne lagata he
 When the temperature of the nucleus increases due to speed and shrinkage, the nuclear reaction starts in them, which causes them to radiate light energy and show us the appearance of new stars
 vibhinn prakaar ke taron kii urja vikeernata ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki population dwitiya ke taare bahut pracheen hai tathaa papulation pratham ke taare apekshaakrit baad main nirmit hai
 The life of stars refers to their luminous life
 taron ke prakaash kaa aadhaar he, unka hydrogen kaa bhandar, jisaki nabhikeey abhikriya se ve ooshmaa urja praapt karte hai
 The stars which are very bright, naturally consume more of their hydrogen reserves and convert them to helium more quickly
 yadhyapi hydrogen kaa bhandar samaapt hone par bhi taare sankochan dwaara apni ooshmaa urja ko bahut varshon tak praapt kar sakate hai, tathaapi unke jivan kaa mukhya aadhaar unke hydrogen ke upbheg par hi nirbhar rahata he
 The stars that appear bright enough have a lifetime of about 109 years and the main sequence of blurred stars has a life of about 1013 years
 surya kaa jeevankaal lagbhag 1010 varsh hai
 Our desire to unravel the mystery of the starry world around us is very old
 taron ke adhyayan se hamane vishwa ko gallexi jaisi anek tarapranaliyon purna paaya he
 We have learned so much by studying the spectrum of stars by moving the lines towards red color that our world is expanding
 tathaapi apane simit sadhano ke kaaran ham vishwa ke vaastavik rup ko nahin jaan sake hai
 To what extent does our world expand, to what extent can the spreading world, how is the curvature of the world, and what is the radius of curvature? sabase bada mount palomar veghashaala kaa, 200 inch vyas kaa hell doordarshee ek arab parsek, athwa lagbhag 20, xxwrep 2 00, 00 mile ke lagbhag, duriyon ke drishy tak hi pahunch paaya he

 This unique phenomenon of the sky is most concerned with astrology as a result of predictive belief, in which its fruit is constituted

 According to predictive beliefs, a meteor is somewhere auspicious and elsewhere auspicious
 kintu adhiktar bhavishya main honevaali kisi durghatana ke daivi sanket ke rup se yah ashubhasuchak hi samajha jaataa he
 According to Pliny, if the magistrate of the Sparta, the city of Sparta, ancient Greece, in 1200 BC, after the reign of eight years, meteorites were seen in a lunarless clean night, he would take the throne as a divine sign of the ruler's sin

 This belief is the basis for the interpretation of the future life of a person in the horoscope based on the imagination of the form, nature, location and motion of the constellations, which has been given a mathematical or scientific method
 bhagya se inkaa sambandh ukt bhubhag kii abhivyakti main prachlit 'tara' or 'nakshatra' shabd ke arthon main sugamawapurvak khoja ja saktaa he
 Similarly, the color and sharpness of a star also represents the nature and fate of a human being on the earth; Also, his breakdown means the person dead

 As the Virginia delegation first proposed, the Constitutional Convention in 1787 made the Virginia Plan the basis for discussions
 virginia plan ke anusaar, raashtrapati kaa chunaav congress ko karnaa tha
 Delegates in most of the states agreed with this method of election
 haalanki, ek samiti jiskaa gathan vibhinn baarikiyon ko hal karne hetu hua tha, jis main raashtrapati ke chunaav kii vidhi bhi sammilit thi, usne varan yah suzav diya ki chunaav ek logo ke samooh dwaara ho, jo rajyon ke bich usee sankhyaon main prabhajit ho jitne us rajya ke congress main pratinidhi ho, with its varied distribution of voter rights and powers, would countervail against factions
 Madison further proved in Federalist Number 10 that the larger the population of the republic and the greater its spread, the more difficult it would be for the factions to organize due to issues such as sectarianism

 Hazrat Umar ibn al-khatab, E
 Muhammad Saheb's chief was among the four Sahaba
 vah hazarat abu bakr ke baad musalamaanon ke duusare khalipha chune gayi
 Muhammad was named as Farooq
 jiskaa arth satya or asaty main fark karne vaala
 His status among the followers of Muhammad sahab comes after Hazrat Abu Bakr
 umr khulpha-e-raashidin main duusare calipha chune gaye
 Omar proved to be the most successful caliph in the khulafa-e-rashidin

 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble
 makka waalon ne kamazor musalamaanon par sitam tej kar diye jisko dekhakar mohammad sahab ne allaah se dua kii to allaah ne madeene jane kaa hukum diya
 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i
e
 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili
 "nobody dared to stop Omar
 umr ne elaan karke hizrat kii
 Medina had become a new center of Islam

 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui

 At the same time, society can get the glory of Raj
 Peethagaur gave birth to great Virat kings like Chandragupta Maurya, Harshavardhana
 usee tarah daguru ke vichaaron ne aalaa udal, raja gopichand jaise mahaan yoddha wo ko nirmit kiya
 From the 12th century to the 17th century, Gaur became a great warrior in Banjara
 jaise maharana pratap ke senapati jaimal fantiha or raja ratansingh ke sar senapati or raani rupmati ke sage bhai gore banjaaraa gaura badal
 The 16th and 17th century Gaur were the great merchants of the Banjara society, the Lakshios Banjaras in the north and the Bhagandaras Vadatiya of Jangi, Bhangi and Madhya Bharata in the south
 ye sabhi vyapaaree bharat ke bade raja-maharaajaaon ko rasad pahunchane kaa kaam karte the
 But the common public was concerned with Saint Sevala Maharaj of this Gaur Banjara society, so he formed and led his ideas for the service and good of the general public, the same great Satguru, social reformer, revolutionary, economist, Ayurveda and Sant Sevlal, a religious leader of Bahujans, was born on 15 February 1739 in Golal Dodi village in Guthhi taluka of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh
 abhi wo gaanv sevagarh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Due to the geographical and historical information, the Gore Banjara society was mostly on the borders of the state, they used to get the benefit of these conditions in the business and they were also profitable from the point of view of the same thing
 sevaalaal ke pitaaji raamji nayak ke suputr bhima nayak bahut bade vyapaaree the
 He had knowledge of almost all Indian languages
 unki kul sampatti main 4000 se 5000 tak gaay or belon kaa samavesh tha
 Which was used for grain traffic and was the hero of 52 tandas
 unhen nayakda kaha jaataa tha ek gaanv kii aabaadi lagbhag 500 ke aasapaas hoti thi
 For every tande, a man and a woman worked as Gore preachers, calling them Bawan Bheru and 64 Jogani
 in 52 bheru or 64 jogni kaa ek sangh hota tha
 And they were established under the main Naikada
 isiilie sant sevaalaal ke dadaji ko ramsangh nayak kehete the
 Bhima Nayak was also the chief of 52 Tandas
 aitihaasik dastavej se pataa chalaa he kii, bhima nayak ne angrejon ke saath mulya 2 lakh ru
 kaa vyapaaree qaraar kiya tha
 This clearly shows that Sevlal was born in Vaibhav Sapna
 iske alaava unke janm ko lekar kaaphi sari mithyaa kahaniyaan sunne main aati he
 Sevlal's mother's name was Dharamani, who was the daughter of Jairam Badatiya
 bhima nayak ke vivaah ke uparaant lagbhag 12 saal tak unhen koi santan nahin thi baad main mariya maan ke aradhana ke baad sant sevaalaal kaa janm hua aisi astha he
 According to the traditional policy of the Sangh, wars were made to protect the self-defense and grain
 usee ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sevaalaal ne 7 sanghatnayakon kaa ek sanghatan banaaya jisamen khud sevaalaal, unke teen bhai, hapa badu, pura or dharmi, dhaka, ramsang saath bhiya the
 This union was later adopted by 6 Sangh Nayaks
 is tarah 13 logon kaa ek mahasang bana? jo 700 tando kaa netritv karata tha jisamen madhyabhaarat, dakshinbharat kaa samavesh tha
 Bhagandaras Vadatiya Kulasampati 2 lakh bulls, merchants of Madhya Bharat) and merchant Jangi of Dakshibharatha, joined the union of Bhangi Bhukiya Seva Lal

 The gore of the British rule was increasing pressure on the Banjara merchant against shipping logistics to the kings
 or angrej prabhavit ilaakon main gore banjaaraa vyapaareeyon se kar vasuli kaa fermaan nikaale ja rahe the jo kii, gore banjaaraa ke vyapaaree niyamon ke khilaaf tha
 Taking a proposal against this tax collection, Sevlal along with all his Sangh heroes went to meet the Nizam
 angreji hukumat ke dar se nizaam ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya iske maddenjar sevaalaal ne nizaam ke viruddh yuddh kaa elaan kiya
 Then there was a war in Hyderabad and as a result, the Nizam accepted all the conditions of Sevlal and advised the King of Delhi, Ghulam Khan, for the taxation of other states of India
 sevaalaal ne nizaam kii salaah maan lee or nizaam kii ore se diye hue sammaan ko sweekaar kiya
 As a mark of respect, the Nizam gave Tamrapatra, Talwar and Bhetwastu

 The emperor of Delhi Ghulam Khan rejected the proposal, as a result Sevlal declared war, 900 Ghulam Khan's 25000 soldiers were confronted by Sevlal's 900 warriors
 gulam khan kii baari haar hui itihaaskaaron ne is yuddh kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 Ghulam Khan approved the waiver of the tax system
 vyapaar drushticon se sevaalaal kii ye bahut badi rajnatik jeet thi
 Due to this victory, Sevlal's name became famous throughout India
 lahore ke gaurbanjaraa ne sevaalaal ko sammanit kiya
 At the call of the Banjara traders and Bahujan people of Jaipur, Sevlal decapitated the dreaded Bhumia and liberated the Rajasthanis from Bhumia
 aaj bhi isi nishaani ke taurapar jaipur main savai maansingh hospital main sevaalaal kaa mandir he
 Raisina Hill, Delhi-based Lakshon Banjara is present at the Chhatri Nehru Planetarium, New Delhi, made to welcome Sevlal

 Similarly, the port named Dharamtar is present near Pen in the Raigad district
 usee tarah mumbai sthit bhaauchaa bhi naa hote hue wo sevabhaaya kaa dhakka he
 At this place, the ship of Portuguese was stranded by Sevlal, and as a result, they were given beads of pearls, which is why Sevlal is also known as Motilavo
 raigarh jilhe main pen ke paas gagode naamak gaanv main sevaalaal kaa vyapaaree centre tha vahaan par aaj bhi unke naam kaa mandir maujuud he
 Sevlal was a very big businessman, warrior, Sangat, economist, but he was a big social reformer with him

 Fatehabad was founded by the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb on 29 May 1658 after the victory over his brother Dara Shikoh
 aurangzeb kaa baadashahi baag yahan se 3 kimi kii duuri par sthit he
 After that, Fatehgarh came under the jurisdiction of Daulat Rao Scindia, the Maratha ruler of Gwalior

 Thermochemistry also includes the study of the physical changes that occur as a result of energy exploitation or emission, etc
)
 iske saath-saath ushma dharita, jvalan kii ushma, nirmaan kii ushma, inthalpi evam mukt urja kii gananaa bhi kii jaati he
 Typically, a reaction expresses the heat absorbed or absorbed by its equation
 udhaaharan ke liye : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories dwaara pakat hota he ki 1 gram-anu hydrogen gas tathaa 1 gram-anu chlorine gas se sangyojan se jab 2 gram-anu hydrochloric amla gas banati he, to 44,000 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 Similarly, see the following equation: H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories It is revealed that if 256 grams of hydrogen iodide gas is made by combining 2 grams of hydrogen and 254 grams of iodine gas, 11,860 calories of heat will be absorbed in this reaction
 yah to spasht he ki kisi bhi kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra usamen bhaag lenevaale padaarthon kii bhautik avasthaa par nirbhar rahegi; isiilie bhi likh jaati he
 The effect of the physical state on the reaction heat will be clear from the following example: tathaa In the second equation, the amount of heat dissipated is higher than in the first equations because it contains the amount of heat dissolved in 18 grams of steam being dissolved
 jin pratikriyaaon main pratikaarakon ke aaytan main bhi parivartan hota he, unke liye pratikriya-ushma is baat par bhi nirbhar hogi ki pratikriya sthir aaytan par kii gai he athwa sthir daab par
 If the volume is kept constant while reacting, the board does not have to do anything against the external pressure
 atev sthir aaytan par pratikriya kii yatharth urja kshepit yaa shoshit hoti he
 But if the volume is allowed to increase or decrease while keeping the pressure constant while performing the action, the exact value of the reaction heat will not be known
 udhaaharan ke liye; aaytan badhane main mandal bahya daab ke viruddh kaary karata he, jisamen urja vyay hogi; atev yadi pratikriya ushmakshepak he to is avasthaa main kshepit kii maatra kam ho jaaegi
 Normally the heat of reactions is measured at a constant volume
 ushmarsayan ke drushtikon se abhikriyaaon ko praaia: kai virgon main baant lete hai or abhikriya swabhaav ke anukool abhikriya-ushma ko naam de diya jaataa he - jaise vilyan-ushma, tanukaran-ushma, utpaadan-ushma, dahan-ushma tathaa shithilikaran-ushma 
 Heat dissipation often occurs when a solute is dissolved in a solvent
 jo lavan jal se kriya karke jalyojit lavan banaate hai unke ghulne par adhiktar ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The amount of heat absorbed in dissolving other salts is very small
 kisi padaarth ke ek gram-anu ko vilaayak main gholne par kshepit yaa shoshit urja kii maatra ko vilyan-ushma kehete hai
 In addition, there is also a change in heat in diluting the concentrated solution and this is called dilution-heat of the solution
 tanukaran-ushma kii maatra vilyanon kii tanuta ke saath kam haati jaati he or adhik tanu vilyanon ke liye ise shunya mana ja saktaa he
 In the thermochemistry of such dilute solutions, it is called "aqueous"
 udhaaharan ke liye; potacium nitrate jal main villin hokar ati banu vilyan banaata he, to uski vilyan ushma 8,500 calories hoti he
 This fact can be expressed by the following equation: avyav tatwon ke sanyog se kisi yogic ke ek gram-anu banane main jitani ushma shoshit yaa kshepit hoti he, use us yogic kii utpaadan-ushma kaha jaataa he
 For example, it is clear by the following equations that the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitric acid is thermally 94
4, 18
8 and 42
4 calories: utpaadan ushma rinatmak bhi ho sakati he, jaise : The compounds that heat dissolves in the formation of essential elements are called exothermic compounds, and the compounds in which heat is absorbed in formation are called thermodynamic compounds
 adhiktar yogic ushmakshepak hote hai, jaise hydrogen, chloride, jal, hydrogen salafid, salfar dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride aadi sab ushmakshepak yogic hai
 Examples of thermodynamic compounds can be given such as hydrogen iodide, carbon disulfide, acetylene, ozone etc
 ushmashoshak yogic ushmakshepak yogicon kii apeksha bahut kam sthaayee hote hai or sugamawa se apane avyaviya tatwon main vichchhedit ho jate hai
 The above distinction of durability of exothermic and exothermic compounds is due to the difference of energy inherent in them
 udhaaharan ke liye; 1 gram-anu carbon tathaa 1 gram-anu oxygen ke sanyog se jab 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide banataa he, to 94,300 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 It is clear that 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide will have 94,300 calories less energy than its constituents
 isi prakaar carbon dicelphide jaise ushmashoshak yogic main apen avyav tatwon kii apeksha 22,000 calories urja adhik hogi
 If the intrinsic energy of all elements is taken to be zero, then it is clear from the appropriate interpretation that the inherent energy of the compounds will be equal to their production heat; But if the output energy is negative then the underlying energy will be positive and conversely if the output is heat positive, the underlying energy will be negative
 udhaahrant: carbon dioxide tathaa carbon dicelaphid kii antarnihit urjaayen krmanusaar - 94,300 tathaa 22,000 calories ke baraabar hongi
 The amount of heat that is absorbed by burning one gram-molecule of an element y compound completely at a constant volume in oxygen is called combustion-heat of that element or compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnlikhit sameekaran se spasht he ki methen kii dahan-ushma 2,12,800 calories he : On burning carbon in oxygen, it is possible to form two compounds - yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki carbon kii dahan-ushma 94,300 calories he, 26,000 calories nahin, kyonki pratham kriya main hi carbon purnataya jalataa yaa oxykrut hota he
 In the second process, carbon is converted to carbon monoxide, but its combustion is not complete yet because carbon monoxide can be further combusted and oxidized to carbon dioxide
 dahan-ushma gyaat karne ke liye ek vishesh prakaar ke calorimapak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise bam-calorimapak kehete hai
 Scientific Barthels first built it in 1881
 yah ganmetal ispaat kaa bana rahata he or belan ke aakar kaa hota he
 a special type of enamel is placed on its inner plane, due to which there is no action of oxygen on it
 dhakkan dha ko dridhtaa se band karne ke liye isamen majboot pench lage rahete hai
 a certain amount of the substance to be combusted is taken into the platinum cup "P" and the oxygen is filled at about 20-25 atmospheric pressure in the bomb
 iske baad vam ko dridhtaa se band karke use saadhaaran calorimapak main rakhte hai
 a certain amount of water is taken in an ordinary colorimeter and by experiment it is already determined how much heat is required to increase the temperature of the water in this colorimeter by 1 degree centigrade
 bahya calorimapak main jal kaa taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now platinum wires a and a conduct electricity through a fine wire of iron
 vidyutpravaah se taar t garam hokar laal ho jaataa he or pyaali pa main rakhaa padaarth oxykrut hone lagata he
 In the burning of iron wire and in this process of oxidation, heat is absorbed, the amount of which is determined by an increase in the temperature of the water present in the external colorimeter
 is prayog se praapt ushma-maatra main se lohe ke jvalan main kshepit ushma ko ghataakar padaarth ke dahan dwaara kshepit ushma kii maatra gyaat kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that in this experiment the volume of the circle is constant; Therefore, combustion-heat of a substance can be determined by this method

 If acid and alkali are taken up in such dilute solutions that they are completely decomposed into ions, the action of relaxation will be the formation of undissociated molecules by simply combining hydrogen and hydroxyl ions
 atev tanu vilyanon main sab prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshaaron ke shithilikaran kii ushma samaan hogi
 The value of this heat is 13,700 calories by experiment
 at: prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshar ke shithilikaran ko nimnlikhit samikarnon dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : Where x is a radical and m is a metal, arthath Ie parantu yadi amla yaa kshar durbal ho, to vah tanu vilyan main bhi purnataya vighatit na hoga
 Therefore, the relaxing heat of such acids or bases will not yield 13,700 calories
 udhaaharan ke liye ammonium hydroxide kii ynikaran-ushma -1,500 calories he, atev ammonium hydroxide tathaa kisi prabal amla kii shithilikaran ushma 12,200 calories hogi
 To determine the heat dissipated by the experiment, a certain amount of alkali diluted solution in a thermos flask is then immersed into the flask with constant heat, so that radiation does not alter the temperature of the solution within the flask
 ab banu vilyan main amla kii samatuly maatra lekar uskaa taap kshar ke taap ke baraabar sthir kar lete hai
 Once the temperature of the acid is stable, it is quickly added to alkali
 kaach ke ek vilodak dwaara vilyan ko chalaakar uskaa ucchtam taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now if the quantity of the alloy solution, its specific heat, heat, the heat dissipation of the flask used, is known, then the amount of heat absorbed in the relaxation process can be easily determined
 isi vidhi dwaara lavenon kii vilyan-ushma bhi sugamawa se nikaal sakate hai
