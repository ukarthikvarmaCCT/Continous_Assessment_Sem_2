 chunki rajya sarkarein berogari bhatta detii hai, unhen shramikon ko rojgaar pradaan karne ke liye baari protsaahan diya jaataa he
 However, it is up to the state government to fix the amount of unemployment allowance, which is subject to the condition that it is not less than 1 / 4 of the minimum wage for the first 30 days and then less than 1 / 2 of the minimum wage
 No prati parivaar 100 dinon kaa rojgaar sakasham or icchhuk shramikon ko har vittiya varsh main pradaan kiya janaa chahie

 The scheme was launched on 2 February 2006 in 200 districts, which was expanded to another 130 districts in 2007–2008 and was finally implemented in all 593 districts of India by 1 April 2008
 2006-2007 main parivyay 110 bilian rupye tha, jo 2009-2010 main tezi se badhate hue 391 bilian rupe ho gaya

 Jean Dreze and others suggested that it could be financed through improved tax administration and reforms, while the tax-gdp ratio has actually been declining so far
 aisi ashanka he ki is yojana kii laagat jidipi kaa 5% ho jaayegi
 Another important criticism is that the end products of public works schemes are unsafe which the rich sections of society can occupy

 Catholicism or Roman Catholicism is a main branch of Christianity whose followers consider the Pope located in the Vatican city of Rome as their bishop
 isai dharm kii duusari mukhya shakha protestant kehalaati he or uske anuyaayi pope ke dharmik netritv ko nahin sweekaarte
 There are even greater differences in religious beliefs between Catholics and Protestants

 Notwithstanding all this, today, more than half of Christians around the world are members of the Roman Catholic Church

 The original meaning of Kathlik is broad
 katholic carch kaa daawa he ki vah yugaugantar tak arthath 'sab samay' 'sabhi deshon' ke manushyon ke liye khulaa rahata he or isa dwaara prakat kii gai 'sabhi' dharmik sachchaaiyaan sikhalaataa he

 Catholics believe that their religious organization continues the custom of the early Christian organization and is its sole heir
 ve maanate hai ki unki prarthana ritiyon main jo roti or madiraa kaa paan kiya jaataa he vah dharmik arth main isa messiah kaa maas or rakt ban jate hai jinhen prarthana karne vaale grahan karte hai

 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth were included
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview
 iske anusaar lokapal ek samiti hogi jiske adhyaksh vartmaan yaa sevanivrutt nyaayadhish honge
 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 India's 65th Independence Day celebrations were held in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would go on a fast
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given
 antat 13 agast ko anna hajaare ne ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di gai to ve jail baro andolan shuru karenge
 He also announced to abandon water
 dilli police ne jepi park main anshan karne kii anumati 22 pratibandhon ke saath di
 Anna Hazare refused to accept 6 of these conditions
 inamen pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya 5000 tak simit rakhane, anshan 3 din tak hi karne, anshan sthal par laudspikar kaa prayog na karne, tent na lagane aadi kii sharten shaamil thim
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the 65th Independence Day celebrations of India, expressed his desire to end corruption on the one hand, but at the same time termed any demonstration for him as unconstitutional
 anna hajaare sara din rajghat par chintan karte rahe or shaam ko anshan ke jari rakhane kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said, "we will go to JP Park for a fast in the morning
 We have come to know that there is Section 144 there but if we refuse to go there, then we will sit in the same place where we have to go
 prashasan unhen jahaan bhi le jaae unka anshan vahiin hoga, "ham jail main anshan par baithenge, vahaan le gaye or agar phir chhod diya to waapas jepi park par aakar baith jaayenge
 " 16 agast bhartiya satta or janata kii shakti kii pariksha kaa din tha
 The police was all set to tackle the hunger strike
 anshan shuru karne ke liye taiyaar hote hue anna evam unke saathiyon ko police ne dilli ke mayur vihaar sthit supreme inkalev se kareeb saadhe saat baje anshan shuru karne se pehle hi giraftaar kar liya
 The police told the people present there that they were taking Anna to the fast
 unhone jivan anmol aspataal ke paas media or anna samarthakon ko aage badhane se roak diya
 Shortly after being arrested and taken to the Civil Lines Police Mess in Delhi, he started his fast there and refused to take water
 dilli kii ek vishesh adaalat main aage andolan na karne or apane samarthakon ko andolan karne ke liye na kehane jaisi sharton vaale nijee muchalaka na dene ke baad adaalat ne anna hazareor unke sahyogiyon ko saat dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya

 "unhone logon kaa aahvaan kiya ki ve apane kshetra ke saansadon ke gharon par jaaen or unki sadbuddhi ke liye dharna den
 People should sing Bapu's beloved bhajan Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram and ask the mps what their opinion is on Lokpal
 ve sarkari lokapal ke saath hai yaa jan lokapal ke
 Because you have voted for them
 yah aapkaa adhikaar he
 Arvind Kejriwal wanted to know that the Prime Minister should tell where and where to talk to the government

 The government negotiators took time till morning the next day for this
 dow naresh trehaan ne mangalvaar 23 agast kii shaam ko anna hazaare ke swasthya kii jaanch karne ke baad unhen drip lagane kii salaah di thi lekin iske liye bhi unhone inkaar kar diya
 Addressing the people at night, Anna said that after noon, the doctors had said that there was some problem in the kidney and they would have to give the medicine through drip
 maine doctoron se kaha tha ki main apni antaratma kii awaz sun kar bataaungaa ki main kya karungaa
 My conscience is saying what you are saying that the heart has given, will give life and is afraid to die
 

 to maine doctoron se kah diya he kimeri antaratma kah rahi he ki koi dawa nahin leni he
 i don't care if i die, how many Anna have stood after me
 agar unki kidney ko kuch ho jaataa he to hazaron logon main se koi na koi unhen kidney de degaa
 After the doctor's report, the government too will start thinking and if there are efforts by the government to forcefully take them away, then people stand at all the doors and do not let me take them
 "raat bhar main hi sarkaar kaa rukh puri tarah badal gaya or 24 agast ko vah kal hui sahmati se peeche hat gai
 He refused to present the Jan Lokpal Bill in Parliament and described Anna's fast as his problem
 anna ko jabardasti anshan sthal se uthaane kii sambhaavna bhi bad gai
 Addressing supporters on Wednesday evening of 24 August, Anna Hazare said- "hinsa mat karo

 And everyone has to go to jail Bharo movement from tomorrow
 desh ko ahimsa ke maarg se bachaana he
 This is the second battle for independence

 This is a big danger for the Lokshahi, but i request that if the government raises me from here, no one should stop it
 ab mujhe sarkaar kii chaal samaj aa gai he
 The government wants you to commit violence to break the movement
 isliye ham sabhi ko sanyam rakhana he
 "on the 10th day of the fast on August 25, Anna Hazare said at Ramlila Maidan" that my weight has reduced by just 6

 i feel that i will not die till the Jan Lokpal Bill is passed
 mujhe aapse kaaphi urja mil rahi he
 " anna hajaare ke samarthan main lagaataar dasven din desh bhar main pradarshan jari rahaa
 For the second consecutive day, people demonstrated outside the Prime Minister's residence
 unamem se 50 ko hiraasat main le liya gaya

 The issue of corruption was discussed in the Lok Sabha
 pradhanmantri netaa vipaksh or loksabhaa adhyaksh sahit loksabhaa ne ek swar se anna hajaare se anshan khatm karne kii apil kii
 After this, Union Science and Technology Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh went to Ramlila Maidan and sent a letter to Anna Hazare from all parties and Parliament and requested him to end the fast
 jan lokapal sahit aruna raay ke vidheyak or sarkari vidheyak par sadan main charchaa karaane ke prastaav par anna ne kaha ki- "sansad main jan lokapal vidheyak par charchaa shuru ho to ham apana anshan todane par vichaar karenge
 But we have three main demands
 rajyon main lokayukta kii niyukti, nichle str ke adhikariyon ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main laana or naagarik charter bananaa
 All three are for the poor
 in muddon par satta paksh or vipaksh main jab tak sahmati nahin banati he tab tak unka anshan jari rahegaa
 Responding to the Prime Minister and the entire Parliament expressing concern over his health, Anna Hazare said that "we thank him for this
" lekin mere swasthya kii chintaa aaj unhen hui
 He is worried about Anna's health, where was he for 10 days
 darasal, chintaa un logon ko he jo yahaan aae hue hai
 Those in air condition are not worried about Anna's health
 "anna ne vilasarav ko die gaye patr main pradhanmantri ko likhaa ki- "hamaare man main hamaari sansad ke prati apaar sammaan he, hamaari sansad hamaare janatantr kaa pavitra mandir he
 i am not sitting on hunger for any of my selfishness, just as you are working for the good of the country, in the same way, i also keep thinking about the people of the country
 mere paas kisi prakaar kii koi satta nahin he
 i am a very normal person and have a feeling of doing something for the society and the poor people
 hamaara andolan kisi vyakti yaa party ke kilaaf nahin he
 We are against corruption
 ham bhrasht vyavastha main parivartan chaahate hai
 If during my movement some words have been uttered by me or any of my companions that have hurt you or any other person, i express my heartfelt gratitude to all of us
 kisi ko aahat karnaa hamaara maqasad nahin he
 Lokayuktas should also be created through this law in every state, Citizens Charter should be made for public problems in every department, which should be acted upon by the concerned officer if they do not agree, and thirdly, all employees from the top to the bottom of the central government and all the employees of the state Be brought under its purview
 kya in teen baton par sansad main prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he? mujhe ummid hi nahin yaqiin he ki hamaare sabhi saansad desh kii janata ko bhrashtachar ke rose-rose ke zillat se nijaat dilaane ke liye shuru main raji ho jaaenge
 meri antaratma kahati he ki in baton par agar sansad main sahmati hoti he to main apana anshan tod don
 " janalokapal bill kii baaqi baaten, jaise chayan prakriya aadi bhi bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye atyant mahatvapurn hai
 i will be sitting in Ramlila Maidan with my people till all the other issues are decided in Parliament because this is the voice of the people
 mere saath desh bhar main itane log is ummid se jude hai ki unhen bhrashtachar se nijaat milegi
 For this, it is necessary that the law should be passed for the formation of Lokayukta in the states as well
 aam logon ko rojaanaa jin adhikariyon ke bhrashtachar se do-chaar hona padataa he, unke bhrashtachar se ladane kii vyavastha ho
 Similarly, the deadline for all government services is fixed and the officer who does not complete them on time should be fined
 anna hazaare pradhanmantri awaas main anna kii is chitthee par vichaar-vimarsh bhi kiya gaya kintu agle din sarkaar kaa ravaiya pehle jaisaa hi bana rahaa
 
 iske saath hi sarkaar ne vigyapanon evam anya sadhano se sanchaar madhyamon kaa ek varg taiyaar kar liya tha jo ab unke paksh ko thik tehraane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 Many media channels were starting to raise issues among the Anna team, among the exhibitors, less understanding of the Lokpal
 iske baavjood yah andolan nirantar jari tha or sarkaar par dabaav bad rahaa tha
 The public was adamant on the decision to stay with Anna after watching the proceedings of the Parliament live and seeing the statements and faces of the leaders
 26 agast ko 11 dinon tak chup rahane ke baad loksabhaa main congress ke bhavi karnadhaar maane jane vaale rahul gandhi ne kaha ki- "loktantr kii garima ko kam karnaa ek khataranaak chalan he
 Personally, many people have contributed significantly to the country but it is important to understand that democratic process has its own importance, democratic process is long but it gives everyone a chance to express their views
 

pichley dinon main ye samaj banaai ja rahi he ki ek lokapal kaanoon aane se bhrashtachar se nijaat mil jaaegi lekin ye galat he, sirf ek lokapal qanoonlane se bhrashtachar nahin khatm hoga, balki iske liye kai or chunautiyon ke hal dhundhane honge"isaki pratikriya main kiran bedi ne twitor par likhaa ki, "aisa ho saktaa he ki ek lokapal kaafii naa ho, par shuruyaat tokariye
 "annoyed by Rahul Gandhi's statement, supporters of Anna Hazare protested and shouted slogans outside his Tughlaq Road residence on Friday

 Rahul Gandhi sent cold drinks and samosas to the Anna supporters performing outside his house
 27 agast ko sarkaar ne sansad main anna kii pramukh teen maangon par bahes karai
 
 raat 8 baje tak sansad ke donon sadanon ne dhvanimat se in sharton ke paksh main vichaar karne ke liye use sthai samiti ke paas bhejne kaa prastaav paarit kar diya
 Union Science and Technology Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, MP Sandeep Dixit and former Union Minister Vilas Muttemwar took Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's letter on Saturday after both the houses of Parliament agreed in principle on the proposal brought in accordance with Anna Hazare's demands on the Lokpal issue
 Gives Anna to Ramlila Maidan
 iske baad anna hajaare ne samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, "jan lokapal kii yah aadhi jeet hui he
 The complete victory is yet to come
 yah puure yuva shakti kii jeet he
 This is the victory of the people
 yah saamaajik sanghathan kii jeet he
 This is a victory of the media
 " kal sabere 10 baje aap sabhi kii upasthiti main main apana anshan khatm karnaa chahta hum, vah bhi aapaki anumati se
 You must celebrate, but keep in mind that it does not disturb peace and does not cause any trouble
 anna ne 28 agast ko sundarangari kii dalit samudaay kii paanch varshiya bacchee simran or turkman get kii rahane vaali muslim samudaay kii ikraa ke haathon shahad mishrit nariyal pani pikar anshan samaapt kiya
 Before Anna's postponement of his fast, his key aide Arvind Kejriwal addressed the people from the stage in his long statement, saying that he thanks all the political parties as well as people whose streets came under pressure on the government 
 partiyon ke sahyog ke bina ye prastaav paarit nahin hota
 ham unka dhanyavad karte hai
 


 The Constitution is made by the people and above all it is the people followed by the Constitution, Parliament and mps
 sansad main kaanoon janata kii ichha ke anusaar bane
 Anna or Anna's movement is not against the Constitution as is being propagated about the team
 anshan todane ke baad anna ne andolan ko safal banane main desh kii janata, khaastaur se yuvaaon, media, police or unki dekh-rekh main lage chikitsakon ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha ki- "unhone apana anshan sirf sthagit kiya he lekin unki ladaai jari rahegi
 The real fast will break after winning the entire battle
 ladaai puri hone tak puure desh main ghumoonga
 He is confident that the Parliament will not deny the public issues brought through him
 lekin yadi sansad ne inkaar kar diya, to jan sansad ko taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Today it has been proved that the Jan Sansad is bigger than the Parliament of Delhi
 jan sansad jo chaahegi, dilli kii sansad ko use maananaa hoga
 We have to bring change in this country under the constitution made by Babasaheb Ambedkar
 aaj yah sabit ho gaya he ki parivartan laayaa ja saktaa he
 We can build a corruption-free India
 abhi yah shuruyaat he
 The long battle is ahead
 kisaanon kaa sawaal he, mazdooron kaa sawaal he
 There are many issues like environment, water, oil
 garib bacchon kii shiksha kaa sawaal he
 We also have to do electoral reforms
 puri vyavastha badalani he
 Our real fast will break only after this complete change
 aaj desh main itnaa bada andolan hua, lekin puri tarah ahimsak
 All of you have set an example in front of the world how the movement should be done
 is andolan kii yah sabase mahatvapurn baat rahi he
 On 22 August, the Prime Minister announced Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Defense Minister A
K
 After discussions with Antony and Home Minister P
 Chidambaram, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee as the interlocutor and wrote a letter to Anna informing him about this government initiative
 iske baad kendriya kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid or anna ke sahyogi arvind kejariwal or akhil gogoi kii congress saansad sandip dikshit ke awaas par mulaakaat hui
 After this, Arvind Kejriwal said that the government has agreed to negotiate
 iske liye pranav mukherjee ko niyukt kiya gaya he
 Mukherjee and Salman Khurshid participated in the first round of talks on the night of 23 August
 naagarik samaaj kii ore se kiran bedi, arvind kejariwal va prashanth bhushan shaamil hue
 The government described the talks as satisfactory
 sarkaar ne anna kii sehat par chintaa jataai auki kaha ki buudhvaar subah phir vaarta kii jaaegi
 Anna Dal member Arvind Kejriwal said that there is disagreement between the government and us on three issues
 sarkaar ne in par vichaar ke liye buudhvaar subah tak kaa samay maanga he
 Prashant Bhushan said that the government has also appealed to Anna to break his fast
 lekin aaj jo baatcheet hui usamen aansa kuch nahin niklaa ki ham annaji se anshan todane kokehen
 In the talks, the government agreed on some issues
 kintu abhi kai vishyon par sahamati nahin ban pai thi
 Along with this, Anna's colleagues also wanted government approval on certain conditions
 subah anna ke sahyogiyon ke saath punah vaarta ko dhyaan main rakhkar der raat pradhanmantri ne anna masale ko lekar apaat baithak bulaai or varisht mantriyon ke saath charchaa kii
 The Congress Core Group met soon after
 magar in sari kavayadon kaa parinaam 24 agast ko apeksha ke ulte rup main saamne aayaa
 The government's attitude had changed completely
 pranab mukherjee ke saath baatcheet ke baad prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki mangalvaar ko hui vaartaon main sarkaar kaa rukh kaafii sakaaratmak tha lekin buudhvaar ko sab kuch badla-badla sa nazar aayaa
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the government has made it clear that it will not introduce the Jan Lokpal Bill
 kiran bedi ne kaha ki pranab mukherjee buudhvaar ko baithak shuru hote hi gusse main dikhe or wo kah rahe the ki jo aapako karnaa karte raho
 Regarding Anna's fast, the government said that it is his problem ie civil society and Anna Hazare
 ye ek din or raat main sarkari ravaiye main fark kyon aayaa, mujhe nahin maaloom
 On Tuesday, he was listening to us, today he was listening to us
 kal wo hamaari baton kii izzat kar rahe the
 There is a difference of day and night between yesterday and today
 " After this stalemate, on 25 August, the Prime Minister sent a letter to Vilasrao Deshmukh and sent it to Anna
 anna ne teen baton ke sweekrut hone par anshan chhodane kaa aashwaasan diya
 Along with the proceedings of Parliament on 27 August, there was a continuous talk with Anna's colleagues
 magar sarkaar apana rukh spasht nahin kar rahi thi
 By the end of the evening, the outcome of these negotiations came in the form of a proposal to support Parliament on three of Anna's demands
 jisaki soochna dene ke liye phir se vilaas raav deshmukh pradhanmantri kaa patr lekar ramlila maidan aae
 After which Anna announced to postpone the fast on 28 August
 13 dinon tak chale anshan ke kaaran anna ke vajan main saadhe saat kilo kii kami aa gai thi
 His blood pressure was significantly reduced
 13 dinon se anna ke swasthya kii lagaataar jaanch karne vaale doctor trehaan ne bataaya ki anna ke sharir main pani kii kami ho gai he or ve kaafii kamazor ho gaye hai
 He was admitted to a hospital in Gurgaon for a few days to monitor his health
 27 agast ko sansad main anna kii maangon par sahmati banane or 28 agast ko anna dwaara anshan samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi puraa desh jashn main dub gaya
 a Diwali-like atmosphere was created across the country including the capital Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Patna, Ranchi, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Shimla, Jaipur, Raipur, Gandhinagar
 dilli main anna hajaare samarthak apni khushi kaa izhaar karne ke liye tirangaa laharaate or naare lagaate hue india get pahunche
 People were seen swinging on patriotic songs
 kai vyakti kaaron se nikalakar juluus main shaamil ho gaye
 Anna Hazare supporters also burnt firecrackers and shouted slogans to commemorate Vijay in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur, Korba, Raigad including the capital Raipur
 patna ke vibhinn mohallon main logon ne pataakhe chode to kai logon ne mithaiyaan banti
 For the last 12 days at Kargil Chowk, people sitting on a sit-in and fasting in support of Anna got busy celebrating late Saturday evening
 kai logon ne mandir main jaakar bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kiya or anna hajaare ke swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhane kii prarthana kii
 Along with Patna, the victory of this people was celebrated in many districts of the state including Darbhanga, Purnia, Saharsa, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur
 yah vastav main keval naitik jeet thi
 History was definitely made, but something concrete was yet to come out on paper
 haan isane uske liye rasta jarur bana diya tha
 Parliament's proposal to support Anna's three terms was sent to the Standing Committee which Parliament was not legally bound to believe
 aage sthaayee samiti ko i sabhi sujhaavon kaa vishleshan karne or yah bhi tay karne kaa adhikaar tha ki ve kitne vyaavhaarik hai
 Parliament had in principle upheld the basic logic of the government that the role of Parliament is paramount in framing the law and cannot be questioned
 sansad main din bhar chali bahes ke baad diemke, bahujan samaaj party, marxvaadi communist party, bhartiya communist party, samaajawaadee party or biju janata dal ne yah saafe kar diya tha ki lokayukta kii niyukti main sansad kii bhoomika nahin honi chahie kyonki isse rajyon kii swaittata prabhavit hogi
 Some of these parties had also cleared their intention to oppose any such move
 nichali naukarshahi ko bhi lokapal ke antargat laane ko congress ne sweekaar to kar liya lekin yah bhi kaha ki iske liye kanoonee or sansthagat dhaanche main moolbhoot parivartan abhi kiya janaa he
 The mps had unanimously opposed the section of the Jan Lokpal Bill to bring the behavior of the MP inside the Parliament to the Lokpal's work area, in a voice above partyism
 kai dalon ne nyaaypalika ko bhi iske daayre main laane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Some parties advocated the creation of a National Judicial Commission instead and some insisted on a strong accountability bill
 pradhanmantri ko bhi isamen shaamil kiye jane ke mudde par bhi sarkaar ne koi vachan nahin diya
 Several parties, including the BJP, certainly supported the Prime Minister's inclusion in it with some precaution
 do or mahatvapurn maangon, sibiai kii bhrashtachar virdohi ikai ko lokapal ke antargat laane or bhrasht naukarshahon ko barkhaast kiye jane ke tareeqe par antim nirnay bhi sthaayee samiti par chhod diya gaya
 This mass movement made clear the selfish, anti-people and anti-people character by removing the anti-social mask on the faces of political parties
 vipakshi dalon ke saath hi isamen sabase vikrut cheharaa centre ke sattadhari dal bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa najar aayaa
 His lawyer ministers Kapil Sibal, p Chidambaram etc
, issued the Tughlaqi orders and statements as a slave to the ruler and Anna Hazare's team
 14 agast ko congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne anna hazaare par vyaktigat rup se akshep lagaate hue kaha ki anna bhrasht hai
 For this, he had referred to Justice Sawant's report constituted by the Congress government, in which Anna was convicted
 unhone yah nahin bataaya tha ki nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat ke baad is mudde par sukhtankar ayog ne jaanch kii thi or anna ko aropamukt kar diya tha
 The movement also reduced the stature of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Congress General Secretaries Rahul Gandhi, Ambika Soni etc
 as well as Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani, Sitaram Yechury etc
 manmohan singh ne sansad main is andolan ke peeche videshi shaktiyon kaa haath hone kii chetavanee di
 Ambika Soni exposes America's name by cleaning it up
 sabhi netaaon ne baar-baar sansad kii sarvocchata kii duhai di or logon ke prayaason ko arajak kaarywai tehraane kii koshish kii
 They forgot that the preamble of the Indian Constitution begins with the people of India who will make India sovereign, democratic, socialist and secular
 sarkaar or sarkaar main baithe logon ke hitaishiyon evam chatukaaron ne pratyaksh or paroksh rup se is aandolan ko dabaane or todane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi
 She went
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim ke rashtriya janandolan kaa rup lene ke peeche andolan ke netritvkarta anna hajaare kaa vyaktitv or krititv ke saath hi ek kushal team ke sahi or samyochit liye gaye nirnay bhi shaamil the
 Teams of able people like Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Vedi, Prashant Bhushan etc
 kept this movement continuously on the right path and ended the scope of its misguiding
 haa, yadi koi hamaare samarthan main aata he to uskaa swaagat he
 BJP workers are actively participating in this, so they said, 'we are not denying any party worker and leader, they are welcome
 ve yahaan aakar anya samarthakon ke bich baith sakate hai
