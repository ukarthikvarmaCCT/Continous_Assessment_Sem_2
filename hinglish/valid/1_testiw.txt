 Due to the facility status on Mars, UAC can conduct its activities outside of legal and ethical boundaries
 jaise jaise khiladi game main aage badhata he, use gyaat hota he ki aadhaar par karmchaaree asthir hai
 a large number of incidents are due to this instability such as hearing noises, obscuring visuals, and increasing cases of dementia and paranoia, often leading to fatal accidents from the facility's machinery
 euasi kii delta leb divijan main prayogon kii prakruti ke bare main afvaahen vishesh rup se aadhaar ke karmchaariyon main prachlit hai
 Doom 3 has five main characters
 khiladi ko ek anaam antariksh marine korporal kii bhoomika nibhaani hoti he jo euasi ke mangal base par abhi pahunchaa hi he
 The player's non-commissioned officer in charge is master sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who tells the player his objectives and advises the player on the radio in the first half of the game
 kahani main doctor mailkam betrugar ek maanavtaa virdohi bhoomika main hai, jo euasi ke rahasyamayi delta leb prabhag ke pramukh vaigyanik hai, jo maanavtaa kaa virodh karne ke liye nark ke balon ke sahyog main kaam karte hai
 Betruger's Damon-like voice, Philip L
 Given by Clarke, who taunts the bar player as the game progresses
 antim do pramukh paatr iliyat swaan or jaik campbell hai
 Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC Board of Directors, sent him to investigate Betruger's research and an increasing number of accidents at the Mars base following a request for assistance from Wistleblower goes
 lagbhag puure samay ke dauraan campbell ke dwaara unka saath diya jaataa he, ek or antariksh marine jo swaan ke angrakshak kaa kaam karata he or uske paas bienji 9000 hathiyaar he
 Campbell is voiced by Andy Chenley
 swaan or campbell aksar game main khiladi se kuch kadam aage rahete hai, lekin game ke ant tak bhi un tak pahunchaa nahin ja saktaa or unase baatcheet nahin kii ja sakati he
 Some minor characters have also been included in the game which give details of the story and help the player at particular locations
 bhinn anusandhanon or vikaas prograamon or nirmaan kaaryon main lage hue kai vaigyanikon se khiladi kii muthbhed euasi ke madhyam se hoti he, saath hi saathi marine or suraksha gardon se bhi mulaakaat hoti he

 duum 3 kii kahani main game main aane vaale samvaad or cat drishy shaamil hai, saath hi puure game ke dauraan i-mail, audio log or video filein bhi maujuud hai
 Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell arrive at Mars at the beginning of the game, primarily as they arrive at uac's Mars base, using the Earth's means of transportation, with the player's anonymous Marine following them right behind
 suvidha ke bare main shikayaton or ghatnaon kii jaanch ke pehle hisse ke rup main swaan or campbell melkom betrugar ke saath ke sammelan baithak bulaate hai, jabaki marine master sargent thomas keli ke aadesh ke anusaar chalati he
 Kelly instructs the marine to find a scientist at Delta Lab who has gone missing
 marine ko vaigyanik paas hi kii dikmishan sanchaar suvidha main mil jaataa he, jahaan vah betrugar ke teleportesan prayog ke bare main dharti par euasi ko chetavanee bhejne kii jabardast koshish kar rahaa he
 However, as he tries to clarify the Marines about the situation, another tele portation test is performed and control is lost, at which point the entire Mars base is shaking with unnatural shocks, most of the base's staff zombies
 , As the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal
 ab base ke zombis main badal chuke karmchaariyon or nark ke damens ke hamale ko rokane ke liye, marine mangal shahar main lautati he, jahaan keli remote se marine ko duusari marine ke saath link banane ke aadesh detaa he or kahata he ki mukhya sanchaar suvidha par kol karne ke liye ek sancharan card praapt karne ke liye kahata he
 As the marines move through the base, they find that Swan and Campbell are alive, they are also heading to the communications facility to prevent sending a message according to the state of Mars
 marine daste par damens ke dwaara hamalaa kiya jaataa he, unhen maaraa jaataa he, or yadhyapi marine sancharan card praapt kar leti he, lekin itani der ho jaati he ki sanchaar suvidha main upkarnon ko campbell ke dwaara nasht kiye jane se nahin roka ja saktaa
keli, haalanki, marine ko ek byaap system kaa nirdesh detaa he, marine ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki vah yaa to keli ke aadesh ko maan le yaa mangal ko alag rakhane ke liye swaan ke tark ko sweekaar kare, jab tak akraman kii sahi prakruti ko samaj na liya jaye, taaki dharti ko koi khatara naa ho
 Depending on whether the transmission is sent, the Marines are asked by Kelly or Swann to go to the Delta Lab
 delta leb ke raste main, marine betrugar se milti he, jo ab prithvi par akraman karne ke liye spasht rup se nark ke sahyog main kam kar rahaa he
 If the Marines did not send a call of distress to Earth, Betruger himself would have done so and presumably with the help of the ships the daemons would have been brought to Earth
 Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marines using toxic gases at the base's recirculation facility
 delta leb pahunchane paramareen teleportesan prayogon main chupe vivaran ko jaan leti he, saath hi mangal kii sataha main puratathvik khudaai, betrugar kaa pareekshanon ke prati badhata junun or nark se namoonay praapt karne ke abhiyaanon ke bare main bhi ise pataa chalata he
 The excavation finds ruins of an ancient civilization on Mars and from it a relic is known as the Soul Cube
 ek vaigyanik ke anusaar marine leb main zindaa paayi jaati he, sol kyub ek hathiyaar he jise nark ke balon se suraksha karne ke liye pracheen sabhyataa ke dwaara banaaya gaya he
 The scientist also states that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal at the beginning of the game and deposited it in Hell
 marine leb ke madhyam se betrugar ko pakad leti he, lekin betrugar ko jaal main fansaae jane ke baad use mukhya teleportesan portal main khinch liya jaataa he
 Portal leads the Marines directly to Hell, where he fights through a large number of Daemons for the Soul Cube and defeats his Daemonic Guardian
 iske baad marine nark main shodh abhiyaanon ke dwaara chode gaye teleportesan upkarnon ko phir se shuru karne main sakasham ho jaataa he or delta leb main laut jaataa he
 Betruger, however, tells the Marines that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hell's Gate on Mars, capable of bringing several million daemons to Mars
 iske baad delta lebs main, marine kii muthbhed ek ghayal swaan se hoti he
 Swan informs the Marine that Kelly has been working with Hell the whole time and has been transformed by the Daemons
 marine ko bataate hue ki campbell keli ke peeche gaya he, swaan marine ko apana pidie detaa he, jisamen mangal kii sataha ke neeche nark ke dwaar kii sthiti kii jaankaree hoti he or use vishvas dilaataa he ki vah akele base se bahaar nikalne kaa rasta dhundne kii koshish karegaa
 However, when Campbell is caught up with Campbell in the central computer processing sector of the Marine Base, Campbell is badly injured and is only able to say that Kelly is carrying Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before he dies
 iske baad keli demen kii aawaaj main marine par taana kasne lagata he
 Kelly is eventually confronted by the Marine in the Central Computer Corps, who describes Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base
 marine keli ko marane main safal ho jaataa he or marine kii sataha ke neeche or gaharaai main sait 3 tak jane se pehle bienji 9000 le letaa he, yah vahi puratathvik khudaai he jahaan sol kyub tha
 At the primary excavation site, the Marine discovers Hell's Gate, which is guarded by Hell's mighty warrior, Cyberdemon
 sol kyub kaa upyog karte hue, marine siberdeman ko ladaai main haraa detaa he or iske baad sol kyub nark ke dwaar ko sil kar detaa he
 The final cut scene shows the forces arriving at the base from Earth in search of a massacre
 ve marine ko jivit pate hai, lekin unhen pataa chalata he ki swaan mar chukaa he
 They, however, are unable to locate Betruger, who is shown in Hell in the final scene, who has incarnated a dragon-like demon

 However, following the positive reception of Return to Castles Wolfenstein and the modern improvement in technique rendering, most employees agreed that the remake was a right idea and that both owners were offered an ultimatum: allowing them to remake Doom To be given or fired
 After a fairly amicable confrontation, an agreement was made to work on Doom 3

 ID Tech 4, the game engine for Doom 3, is so successful that other developers may not be licensed for use, such as Human Head Studios' Pre and Splash Damage
 Enemy Territory: Quake Wars Doom 3 received favorable reception from critics, with its PC version scoring 87 percent and 88 percent on review compilation Metacritic sites and in gameranking, respectively
 duum 3 ' ke graphics or pregentation kii gunvattta kii bahut prashansa kii gayi; game spot ne game ke vaataavaran ko "anukool rup se sajiv, ghanaa vayumandaleey or ascharyajanak rup se mahangaa" kahkar varnit kiya, jabaki pisi gemer euke ne graphics or gaiyr-khiladi paatr modling or anemeshan ko bahut "pravaahee" bataaya
 ign's Dan Adams noted that the game's presentation included a very high proportion of the game, adding that "without the atmosphere, Doom 3 is a simple shooter, similar to the '90s
" "iske alaava, kai samikshakon ne kam graphics str par game ko itnaa acha banane ke liye ai di software kii prashansa kii he
 Many critics have also praised the game's premises and settings; Greg Kaswin of Game Spot described "the feeling that is in Doom 3 is completely in the real world" while IGN notes that "UAC Base also has a very realistic sense of being, which gives a feel of reality
" vishesh rup se eurogemer ne kaha ki game kaa shuruuaati anukram valve software ke half life ko paribhaashit karne vaale "utkrisht vichaaron par feet baithta he"
 Many reviewers stated that Doom 3 was a "run and gun" game genre that was successful with its predecessors, and the game was alternately praised and criticized for this component
 kuch samay ke baad game main upasthit sincranizeshan kii kai jatil samikshaayen kii gayin
 In addition, the game's artificial intelligence was not considered particularly challenging, with gamespot noting that "the enemy follows the same type of predictable patterns that might be remembered from previous Doom games" while gamespy stated that The way enemies attack the player is "bizarre"; According to critics, players feel that by lifting a weapon many types of zombies are released from hidden chambers in the dark
 iske alaava, kai samikshakon ne kaha ki game kaa kahani kaa sandesh dene kaa tarika "aprabhavi" he, khiladi paatr ke liye pahchaan kii kami ise jatil banaati he
 Lastly, the game's multiplayer is lacking in upgrades, as its player limits are low and the game's mode is low, a fact particularly in contrast to id Software's Influential Quake III Arena

 zahir ud-din mohammad babar jo babar ke naam se prasiddh hua, ek mughal shaasha tha, jinka mul madhya asia tha
 He was the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India
 wo taimur langs ke parpote tha, or vishwaas rakhte tha ki changez khan unke vansh ke purvaj tha
 Babur is believed to be the creator of the verse style called Mubaiyan
 babar kaa janm fargana ghati ke andithan naamak shahar main hua tha jo ab uzbekistan main he
 He was the eldest son of his father Omar Sheikh Mirza, the ruler of the Fargana Valley, whom he described as a man of a stout body, muscular face and round beard, and mother Kutlugh Nigar Khanam
 haalaanki babar kaa mul mongolia ke berlas kabeeley se sambandhit tha par us kabeeley ke logon par farsi tathaa turk janajivan kaa bahut asar rahaa tha, ve islam main parivartit hue tathaa unhone turkestan ko apana vasasthaan banaaya
 Babur's mother tongue was Chagtai language, but he was also proficient in Persian, which was the common language of the place at that time
 usne chagatai main babarnama ke naam se apni jeevani likhi
 Despite being of Mongol caste, his people and followers were Turks and Persians
 uski sena main turk, farsi, pashto ke alaava berlas tathaa madhya asian kabeeley ke log bhi the
 It is said that Babur was very strong and powerful
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki sirf vyaayaam ke liye wo do logon ko apane dono kandhon par ladakar unnayan dhaal par daud letaa tha
 According to folklore, Babur swam across all the rivers that came in his way
 usne ganga ko do baar tair kar paar kiya
 Babur's cousin Mirza Muhammad Haider wrote that at that time, when the Chagatai people were rude and un-cultured, they found it difficult to pronounce Zahir-ud-din Muhammad
 is kaaran unhone iskaa naam babar rakh diya
 When he became the Mughal ruler of India, he named his full name Zahiruddin Mohammad Babur
 babar mughal kaal kaa mahaan shaasha tha
 In 1494, at the age of 12, he was appointed as the ruler of the Fargana Valley
 uske chaachaaon ne is sthiti kaa faaydaa uthaaya or babar ko gaddi se hataa diya
 For many years he spent his life in exile when he was accompanied by some peasants and his relatives
 1496 main usne uzbek shahar samarkand par akraman kiya or 7 maheenon ke baad use jeet bhi liya
 Meanwhile, when he was attacking Samarkand, one of his military leaders captured Fargana
 jab babar isapar waapas adhikaar karne fargana aa rahaa tha to uski sena ne samarkand main uskaa saath chhod diya jiske falswaroop samarkand or fargana donon uske haathon se chale gaye
 In 1501, he regained Samarkand, but was soon defeated by Uzbek Khan Muhammad Shaibani, and thus Samarkand, which was the great wish of his life, withdrew from his hands
 fargana se apane chand vafaadaar sainikon ke saath bhaagane ke baad agle teen saalon tak usne apni sena banane par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In this order he recruited a large number of Tajik provinces in his army
 san 1504 main hindookush kii barfili chotiyon ko paar karke usne kabul par apana niyantran sthapit kiya
 With the advent of the new empire, he dreamed of opening the stars of his destiny
 kuch dinon ke baad usne heraat ke ek taimurvanshi hossain baikarah, jo ki uskaa dur kaa rishtedaar bhi tha, ke saath mohammad shaibani ke viruddh sahyog kii sandhi kii
 But this did not happen due to Hussain's death in 1506 and he established his control over Herat
 par do maheenon ke bheetar hi, sadhano ke abhaav main use heraat chhodana padaa
 In his biography he describes Herat as "a city full of intellectuals"
 vahaan par use yuigur kavi mir ali shah navai kii rachanaaon ke bare main pataa chalaa jo chaagatai bhashaa ko sahitya kii bhashaa banane ke paksh main the
 Perhaps Babar would have got inspiration to write his biography in Chagatai language
 kabul lautne ke do saal ke bheetar hi ek or sargana ne uske kilaaf vidroh kiya or use kabul se bhaagna padaa
 Soon he regained control of Kabul
 idhar san 1510 main faras ke shah ismail pratham, jo safivi vansh kaa shaasha tha, ne mohammad shaibani ko haraakar uski hatya kar daali
 Seeing this situation, Babur re-established control over Herat
 iske baad usne shah ismail pratham ke saath madhya asia par milakar adhipaty jamaane ke liye ek samjhauta kiya
 In return for Shah Ismail's help, he accepted the superiority of the Safavis and considered himself and his followers under the sovereignty of the Safavis
 iske uttar main shah ismail ne babar ko uski bahan khanazada se milaayaa jise shaibani, jise shah ismail ne haal hi main haraa kar maar daalaa tha, ne kaid main rakhaa hua tha or usase vivaah karne kii balaat koshish kar rahaa tha
 The Shah gave full support to Babur for ash-o-aram and military interests, which Babar himself adapted to the Shia tradition
 usne shiya musalamaanon ke anuroop vastra pahananaa aarambh kiya
 During the reign of Shah Isma'il, Persia became a stronghold of Shia Muslims and considered himself a descendant of the seventh Shia Imam Musa al-qazim
 vahaan sikke shah ke naam main dhalate the tathaa maszid main khutabe shah ke naam se padhe jate the haalaanki kabul main sikke or khutabe babar ke naam se hi the
 Babur Samarkand ruled as an associate of Shah Ismail
 shah kii madad se babar ne bukhaara par chadhaai kii
 Babur, being a Timurvanshi, was seen by the people as a savior of the Uzbek and the villagers in the village vacated to congratulate him
 iske baad faras ke shah kii madad ko anaavashyak samajhakar usne shah kii sahaayta leni band kar di
 In October 1511 he marched on Samarkand and once again subjugated it
 vahaan bhi uskaa swaagat hua or ek baar phir gaanv ke gaanv usko badhai dene ke liye khaali ho gaye
 There he looked completely different in Shia clothes among Sunni Muslims
 haalaanki uskaa shiya huliya sirf shah ismail ke prati samyata ko darshane ke liye thi, usne apana shiya swaroop banaae rakhaa
 Although he did not massacre the Sunnis to appease the Shah of Persia, he did not give up his faith in the Shia, which caused widespread disbelief in the public
 iske falswaroop, 8 maheenon ke baad, uzbekon ne samarkand par phir se adhikaar kar liya
 After the fall of the Khilji dynasty on the Delhi Sultanate, there was a state of anarchy
 temurlang ke akraman ke baad saiyyadon ne sthiti kaa faaydaa uthaakar dilli kii satta par adhipaty kaayam kar liya
 This dynasty was founded by Khizr Khan after Timur Lang was made the ruler of Punjab
 baad main lodi rajvansh ke afagaanon ne saiyyadon ko haraa kar satta hathiyaa lee thi
 Babur felt that the Sultanate of Delhi should be ruled by the Timurvans again
 ek taimurvanshi hone ke kaaran wo dilli sultanate par kabza karnaa chahta tha
 He made Sultan Ibrahim Lodi aware of his wish
 ibrahim lodi ke jabaab nahin aane par usne chote-chote akraman karne aarambh kar die
 First he captured Kandahar
 idhar shah ismail ko turkon ke haathon baari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this war, both Shah Ismail and Babur realized the military importance of landmines and started using it in their army
 iske baad usne ibrahim lodi par akraman kiya
 This battle fought in Panipat is known as the First Battle of Panipat
 yah yuddh babarnama ke anusaar 21 april 1526 ko ladaa gaya tha
 Babur's army in this was very small in front of Ibrahim Lodi's army
 par sena main sanghathan ke abhaav main ibrahim lodi yah yuddh babar se haar gaya

 Numerous mythological quotations are available for the expansion of the Varanasi region
 krityakalpataru main diye tirth-vivechan va anya pracheen granthon ke anusaar: It is known from the above quotes that the expansion of ancient Varanasi was very far
 varuna ke pashchim main rajghat kaa kila jahaan pracheen varanasi ke based hone main koi andeh nahin he, ek mile lanbaa or 400 gaj chaudaa he
 The river Ganges protects its southeast mouth and the Varuna river protects the north and north-east mouths as a shallow trench, an empty drain on the west side through which the river Varuna once flowed
 raksha ke is prakritik sadhano ko dekhte hue hi shaayad pracheen kaal main varanasi nagar ke liye yah sthaan chunaa gaya
 During the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, the British also fortified the city by raising the walls of raw mud on the high ground behind Varuna to protect the city
 puraanon main aayi varanasi kii seemaa rajghat kii ukt lambaai-chaudaai se kahin adhik he
 From those accounts, it seems that not only the boundary of the city is described, but the entire region has been included
 varuna ke us paar tak pracheen basaavaton ke avshesh kaaphi dur tak milte hai
 So it is possible that all those parts found in the Puranas have also come
 is kshetra ko yadi nagar main judaa hua maane, to puraanon main varnit nagar kii lambaai-chaudaai lagbhag sahi hi bataayi gai he
 Varanasi was the capital of Kashi district in the Mahajanapada era before the birth of Gautama Buddha
 kintu pracheen kaashi janapad ke vistaar ke bare main yatharth aadi se anumaan lagaana kathin he
 300 plans have been given to Kashi in the natives
 kaashi janapad ke uttar main kosal janapad, purv main magadh janapad or pashchim main vatsa tha
 According to the historian Dr
 Altekar, the district of Kashi extended to 250 miles towards the north-west, because its east was the neighboring district of Magadha and the north-west neighboring district was Panchal
 jataka ke anusaar kaashi or kosal kii simaaen mili hui thi
 The correct description of the southern boundary of Kashi is not available, probably because it went to the Vindhya range and there was no further population
 jaatakon ke aadhaar par kaashi kaa vistaar vartmaan baliya se kanpur tak failaa rahaa hoga
 Here Mr
 Rahul Sankrityayan says that the modern Banaras Commissionerate was the ancient Kashi district
 sambhav he ki aadhunik gorakhpur kamishnari kaa bhi kuch bhaag kaashi janapad main shaamil rahaa ho
 Ancient Varanasi must have been very different from the present Varanasi
 aaj ke banaras jile ke jin bhaagon main ghani basti bases hai un bhaagon main gahadwal yug tak van faile the
 There are also descriptions of innumerable ponds and Pushkarini in the ancient city, many of which survived till the 19th century, but now almost all have been destroyed
 ek samay varanasi kii bhoomi ko katate rahane vaale naale bhi ab pat chuke hai
 Brahmanal once used to reach the Chowk, there is a dense population of the city and only names of drains have survived
 jaatakon se gyaat hota he ki banaras ke aasapaas ghaney jangal faile the
 Most of the villages etc
 mentioned in Kashi district, belonged to the modern Banaras tehsil or Jaunpur, which was part of the ancient Kashi district
 pracheen mrigadaav or isipattan jiskaa vartmaan naam sarnath he, banaras tehsil main he tathaa machhikakhand or kitgiri jonpur main he
 The Chandauli tehsil may have been inhabited in the medieval period, but at least this tehsil has not yet found the ruins of the Gupta or earlier periods, but the Chandauli tehsil was completely settled in the Gahadwal era
 banaras jile main ramnagar kii bhootpurv deshi riyasat bhi sammilit he- ganga ke donon kinaaron par 25 0 80' or 25 0 35' uttari akshansh tathaa 78 0 56' or 79 0 52' purvideshaantar tak failaa he
 The entire Banaras district is situated in the Ganges valley and nothing is left of the soil from its geomagnetic levels, as the hills of Vindhyachal are limited to Mirzapur district
 jile main mitti kii gaharaai gyaat nahin, par gahare kuon kii khudaai se 35 foot tak lom, uske baad 27 foot jami mitti or uske neeche pani ke soton vaali laal baaluu milti he
 Depending on the natural texture, Banaras can be classified into two parts: ye donon bhaag ganga ke oonche-neeche karaaron se vibhajit he
 Variations of these agreements are also dependent on the ground nature and the flow of the river
 banaras ke donon bhaag mukhyat: jameen kaa tala or dhaal main ek-duusare se bhinn hai
 The western part of the district consists of Banaras tehsil and Gangapur and Bhadohi and these are neglected highs from the Chandauli tehsil of the east
 banaras tehsil main jameen kii sataha purv or dakshin-purv kii taraf dhalwan he
 The flow of water sources is towards the Ganges, which is why the western part of the district is a low-lying plateau
 jonpur va azamgarh kii sadaken jahaan uttar se banaras paar karti hai vahaan unki oonchai kramash: 238 or 250 foot he
 The height of Banaras is 252 feet above sea level and it is the lowest height of Ganges at 197 feet
 uttar-purv arthath pargana jaloopur main yah sataha kramash: chhalati hui nadi ke us paar baaluon main aakar 238 foot rah jaataa he
 Due to this elevation of the surface, the flat land of the western part of the district is excellent
 jal vibhaajakon ke paas yah moore sabai kehalaati he, baad mal yah moore arthath balui ho jaati he
 The lower land of the district is called Matiyar and irrigating lakes and ponds produces good paddy yield
 banaras tehsil kii prakritik banaavat ke uparyukt vivaran dwaara aaryon ke aane par is sthaan ko apana kendra banane kaa kaaran spasht ho jaataa he
 The main reasons for this were good land, access to water and means of import and export
 pracheen yug kaa rajmarg bhi varanasi se gajipur hokar bihar kii ore jaataa tha kyonki vartmaan grand trunk maarg par us samay ghanghor van the
 Due to low land in the present Chandauli tehsil in the areas across the Ganges, the rainy water causes major damage by flooding small rivers and lack of proper flow of water caused irrigation difficulties
 yahaan kii jameen nichi hone ke kaaran yahaan malaria kaa bhi adhik prakope hota rahaa he
 Atharva asks the non-residents settled in Varanasi in the Pappalad branch of the Veda to attack Takma on the Suktakal Kashi district
 sambhavat: pracheen kaal main takma arthath malaria se log bahut darate the or unka darana swaabhaavik bhi tha kyonki kunain ke avishkaar ke pehle malaria baari praan sanhaarak hota tha

 Reiki mikaao usui ke dwaara san 1926 main viksit kii gai ek aadhyaamik kriya he
 Usui claimed to have the ability to "heal without losing energy" after fasting and meditating for three weeks at Mount Kurama, Japan
 is kriya ke hi ek bhaag, tenohira yaa hatheli ke dwaara kiye jane vaale upachaar ko ek poorak or vaikalpik upachaar yani complimentry and alternetive medicine ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he

 Template: Energy therapy "rahasyamay vaataavaran, aadhyatmik shakti" reki 霊気 ek japani shabd he jo chini bhashaa ke lingki 靈氣 shabd se uddhrut he, kuch chini-angrezi shabdkoshon ke hisaab se iskaa arth he: " aadhyatmik prabhaav or vaataavaran";"1 budhimatta; samajhane kii shakti 2 pari kathaon main maujuud alokik shakti yaa takat; chamatkaari shakti yaa takat";"1 aadhyatmik prabhaav 2 chaturaai, chaalaaki"
 This Japanese compound has two different single words, ray "ghost, divine, soul; supernatural, divine, ethereal body" and ki "gas, air; breathing; energy; strength; atmosphere; mood; intention; emotion; meditation" here The meaning is composed of qi "spiritual energy; vital energy; vitality; energy of life"
 japani-angrezi shabdkoshon main se reki ke kuch samakakshi anuwaad hai: "rahasy kaa anubhav", "rahasyayukt vaataavaran ", or 'ek vivy vaataavaran ; kisi aatma kii maujuudagi hona

 The term Reiki is used as a noun, verb or adjective for grammar
 kuch pashchimi lekhak reki kaa halke dhang se anuwaad karte hue use sansaarik jivan urja kah dete hai
 The translation from this rhyme becomes partially erroneous: ki means "life energy" - but ray does not mean "worldly"
 san 1922 main mikaao usui ne mount kuramaa par 21 dinon tak sadhana karke, jis dauraan unhone dhyaan lagaaya, upwas kiya or prarthana kii, reki kii utpatti kii
 Usui said that he had acquired the necessary knowledge and spiritual power to apply and adapt others to what we call Reiki by revealing the mystery
 san 1922 ke april maheene main, usui tokyo chale gaye or vahaan unhone usui reki rioho gakkai kii sthapana kii
 Usui was an admirer of Emperor Meiji's literary works and in the process of developing his Reiki system, he adapted some of the emperor's literary works into ethics, which would later be called Reiki principles
 reki ke anek shikshak or uskaa abhyaas karne vaale in paanch siddhanton kaa paalan karne kaa lakshya rakhte hai, inamen se ek kaa anuwaad nimnlikhit he: Usui taught over 2000 disciples to use Reiki
 un shishyon main se solah ne shinpden str tak pahunchane tak apana prashikshan jari rakhaa, yah str pashchimi deshon kii third degree, yaa snatakottar str ke baraabar hota he
 Usui died in 1926
 usui ke dehavsaan ke baad, chuziro hayashi naamak usui ke ek purv shishy ne usui reki rioho gakai ko chhodkar apana ek alag sanghathan bana liya
 Hayashi simplified Reiki lessons by emphasizing physical healing and using a more simple and simpler set of Reiki techniques

 Takata stressed the importance of being charged by Reiki for healing and teaching him
 san 1976 main, takaata ne shinpden charan padhaanaa shuru kar diya or pehali baar is str ko reki master naam diya
 He also set a price of $ 10,000 for master training
 takaata kii mrityu san 1980 main hui thi
 By then she had trained 22 Reiki masters
 japan ke baahar jitna bhi reki sikhaaya gaya usamen se adhiktar kaa shrey uske kaary ko jaataa he
 Today, many Reiki systems exist, but the number of major systems is only 2, which are known as traditional Japanese Reiki and Western Reiki respectively
 paramparaagat japani reki shabd kaa upyog saamanyat: keval us vishesh pranali kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jiskaa nirmaan usui kii shikshaaon se hua tha or jiskaa prasar japan se baahar nahin hua tha
 Around the 1990s, some Western teachers traveled to Japan to discover this particular system of Reiki, although they did not find anything there
 at: unhone reki skulon ko sthapit karnaa or japaniyon ko reki sikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 Soon after this happened, the Japanese who were practicing the Reiki verb and who kept the matter a secret came out to the world and started spreading their knowledge
 tab se lekar aaj tak, paramparaagat japani reki kii kai pranaliyaan astitv main aa chuki hai, inamen kuch pramukh pranaliyaan neeche soochibaddh kii gai hai
 Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakai is the name of the society of teachers who established their own Usui
 yah style keval ushida kii vajah se aadhunik samay tak bachi hui he kyonki ushida hi ve shaks the, jinhone apni mrityu ke samay, sangh ke adhyaksh kaa uttaradhikari usui ko bana diya tha
 This society had been a secret for many years and currently, the teacher named Masaki Kondoh is the president of Gakai
 unki anek shikshaayen aaj bhi ek rahasy hai, haalanki aajkal thodaa thodaa karke, is sangh ke sadsy sansar ke baaki hisson ke saath apane gyaan ko saajha kar rahe hai, in sadasyon main ek naam he master hiroshi doi kaa
 Despite all this, this society remains a closed society even today which is difficult to reach
 reedo reki gakai naam ek aisi pranali ko diya gaya he jo gakai ke mastaron ke dwaara banaaya gaya he or iskaa netritv fuminori aoki kar rahe hai
 Fuminori Aoki added his talk to Gakai's education, though the difference in teaching is very small
 is pranali main, fuminori aoki se prerit chihn koriki ko aatmsaat kiya gaya tha
 The Komyo Reiki Kai was named after the system that took the name of a school of Japanese traditional Reiki and was founded by Hyakuten Inamoto Sensei
 yah anya pranaaliyon se is tarah se alag he ki iskaa udgam gakai se nahin, balk chiyoko yagamuchi ke dwaara hayashi vansh se hua tha jo japan main hi rahaa tha
 This includes greater knowledge and specialized skills as well as the fundamental symbols of Usui include Zui-un, Fukuyu, Honja-ze-shनेnen and Dai-ko-meo
 vartmaan main, mikaao usui kaa uttaradhikari hyaakuten inaamoto sensei ko mana jaataa he kyonki uski aadhyatmik vikaas str kaafii ooncha he
 Jikidane Reiki is named after a system that resembles Komyo Reiki Kai and was developed by Tadao Yamaguchi, the son of Ms
 Yamaguchi
 pashchimi reki, yaa oxidental reki, ek aisi pranali he jiskaa vikaas sushri havaayo takaata ne kiya tha
 The system spread from Hawaii to California and then spread to other Western countries
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke parinamswaroop, shrimati takaata ne pranali main aise sanshodhan karne kaa nirnay kiya jisase yah pranali pashchimi deshon kii maansikta ke hisaab se samajhane main adhik saral or vishwasaneey ban jaae
 As with traditional Japanese Reiki, a number of different systems also came into being from the style of Mrs
 Takata, the main ones listed below
 reki usui shiki rioho reki kii pashchimi pranali ko diya gaya naam he, jiskaa arth he "prakritik upachaar kii usui kii pranali," or yah ek aisi pranali he jisane havaayo takaata kii moulik kriyaaon ko banaae rakhane kaa eemaandaaree se prayaas kiya he
 It is a basic system established by Mrs Takata and still trained today, as with the Reiki Alliance, led by Mrs Takata's granddaughter Phyllis Lee Furumoto
 jaise reki kii adhiktar pashchimi pranaaliyon main he vaise hi is pranali main bhi str maujuud hai, is pranali main in staron kii sankhya teen he, inke naam kramash: is prakaar hai pehali degree, duusari degree or master
 Four elemental symbols are used in this system, although these symbols are of the Takata version, namely Cho-ku re, Se-hee-kai, Hou-sha-ze-show-nan and Dai-ku-meo Usui
 tibeti reki us pranali ko diya gaya naam he, jise wiliam el
 rand naamak ek america sajjan dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This is another system based on the teachings of Takata, although there are more symbols in this system and Rand added to this system the philosophy of mental surgery - and this happened for the first time in any system
 yah naam pranali main hi maujuud do tibeti pratikonkh or kuch buddha shikshaaon se uddhrut he, haalanki, reki usui shiki rioho ke teen staron kii bajaay isamen chaar str hai, jinhen kramash / pehali degree, duusari degree, teesri degree or master kehete hai
 There are a total of seven symbols in this system
 isamen baaki sab kuch pashchimi reki ke jaisaa hi he, haalanki isamen nimnlikhit atirikt pratik maujuud hai; tibeti dai-ko-myo, raaku, agni sarp, aag kaa dragon or tumo
 In addition, there are independent educators and small organizations that feel the need to spread Reiki as it is, and in the way Takata's system continues, these teachers are still free from the restrictions that Reiki is concerned with
 Organizations remain tied
 kuch varshon tak reki ke kuch skulon main iske uttaradhikari hone ko lekar vivaad rahaa, yah vivaad isiilie tha ki unamem se har skool yah kahata tha ki ve hi reki ke asli vanshaj hai or baakiyon ke daawey managasaint hai, haalanki adhiktar jagahon par yah mana jaataa he ki reki kii vishwavyaapee kriya kisi ek skool kii bapauti nahin ho sakati
 The name Jendi Reiki Ho is given to the system which is a mixture of both the above mentioned systems
 chunki hiroshi doi upachaar ke kai kaushalon main pehle se hi nipun tha or sushri miko mitsui, jo "tejaswita takanic" kii ek master thim, ke dwaara prashikshit pehla shishy tha, at: usne is pranali kii sthapana kii
 He was awarded the membership of Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakai in 1993
 yah pranali paramparaagat japani reki or pashchimi pranali ko ek duusare kii poorak bataati he, lekin mulat: yah abhi bhi ek pashchimi reki hi he, kyonki doi sensei kisi paramparaagat japani master kii upyukt yogyata nahin rakhata
 Theoretical differences exist between traditional Japanese Reiki and Occidental Reiki, for example the hand posture during Reiki action; Hayashi Sensei and Ms
 Takata's hand posture occupies a special place in Western Reiki, with no posture of these hands in traditional Japanese Reiki to apply the entire treatment
 iske bajaay, paramparaagat japani reki main upachaar kaa satr reki-ho se shuru hota he, jo aisa sahaj kaushal he jiske antargat "yah janaa jaataa he ki haathon ko kahaan rakhana he
 "in addition, in traditional Japanese Reiki, light massages, pats, and light punches are performed in certain areas of the body, with hand movements used only to treat difficult diseases
 iske vipareet, paramparaagat japani reki kii pakad urja kii charanbaddhata, vyaktigat vikaas or aadhyatmik parivartan main prakaash, gaisho dhyaan or shwasan takneekon ke sambandh ke rup main sudhaar kii anumati detii he
 On the other hand, Western traditions of Reiki emphasize more on healing of diseases
 iske atirikt, ek ore jahaan pashchimi style main shishy corson ko puraa karte hue or aage shuruuaat karte karte staron kii seedhi chadhataa jaataa he, vahiin duusari ore paramparaagat japani reki main, tarakkee kii yah seedhi krmanusaar or dhire dhire chadhi jaati he or is tarakkee kaa yah nirnay reki master lete hai ki agle samaayojan praapt karne kaa upyukt samay koun sa hoga
 Currently, some teachers of Western Reiki have developed their own systems of information and symbols and use the symbols as well as the hand postures that are trained in Reiki or as a task 
 pashchimi pranaaliyon main se kuch kii sthapana pichley kuchhek varshon main hi hui he or ve mikaao usui kii pranaaliyon kii vanshaj nahin he
 These systems include Karuna Reiki, Sechim or SKHM, Reiki Satori, Rainbow Reiki, Saltic Reiki, Kundalini Reiki, Karuna Kai, Ninth Kai's Reiki, Bioreiki, Shambala Reiki, Tera Mai Reiki, and tibetan-tantric Reiki
 maje kii baat yah he ki uparyukt pranaaliyon main se adhikansh reki usui se behatar urja kaa upyog karne kaa daawa karti hai or adhik shaktishaalee pratikon kaa upyog karti hai
 It is very important to keep in mind that among all the masters who developed Reiki systems, only Mikao Usui is a known name that is believed to have reached the Satori state
 usne ahan, aadhyatmik vikaas or upachaar ke bare main ek ni:shulk pranali banaai, jo ek saral pranali he, jisamen atyant upyogi upkarnon kii ek sarani he or saath hi prem or aadar par aadhaarit ek darshan he
 Of all the above mentioned Reiki systems, five are widely recognized and globally recognized; The details of Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakai, Tibetan Reiki, Karuna Reiki, Reiki sechim-sekhem and Comyo Reiki and the other three widely recognized among these systems are given below
 karunaa reki Compassion is a Sanskrit word used in Hindu, Tibetan Buddhist and Zen Buddhism and means any kind of sympathetic act
 yah pranali catherine milanar ke dwaara sanyukt rajya america main sthapit kii gai thi or ise aaj "tera maai" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This system was introduced to Spain in 1995 by Antonio Moraga, who, after doing research in India, incorporated other symbols and techniques into it and thus compassionate nature
 The system consists of the prakriti-karuna Reiki symbols that have been phased out for different Reiki masters at different times
 uski pranali ne shuruuaaton ko charanbaddh kiya he or yah antonio moraaga ke dwaara viksit kii gai he or isamen shakti ke 21 nae pratikon kaa adwitiya maan shaamil he, jise usui pranali or jaapni-tibeti tantric ke saath joda ja saktaa he
 Part of the nature energy was given by the symbol owner Prem Anand, who in turn handed over the symbols to Master Kiram, who handed them over to Antonio Moraga
 karunaa-prakruti ke pratikon ne, apni teevr urja ke kaaran rahasyamayi upachaar karne ke atirikt, prem or mitrataa, swabhimaan main vruddhi, bhaavnaatmak santulan ko phir se kaayam karnaa, karm kaa tyaag karnaa, jaagrukta or shuddhta main vruddhi karnaa, chakron ko ekarup bananaa, hamaare astitv ke bare main spashtataa pradaan karnaa or shanti or param shanti kii rachana karnaa, jaise gunon ko bhi viksit kiya
 tibetan-tantric Reiki tibeti-tantric reki, jise tibeti reki bhi kaha jaataa he, ek aisi pranali he ki jisamen shakti ke 11 pratik shaamil hai
 According to the teachings, using these symbols can be used to diagnose diseases that are caused by deeds
 in daavon main kuch main cancer or aids kaa nidaan karne kaa daawa kiya gaya he or chaitanya ke vibhinn bhaagon or staron ke bich anurupata ko bhi phir se sthapit karne kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 Four of these symbols are named "tibetan symbols" and the other seven symbols are called "tantric symbols"
 shiksha ke anusaar, ye pratik padmasambhava naamak shakyamuni buddha ke ek gupt uttarvarti avatar kii shikshaaon se aae hai, inhone tibet kaa buddha dharm se parichay karaayaa tha
 Symbols and Tibetan tantrik aims to provide vital strength to the seeker and awaken his Kundalini power
 ye pratik chakron par bhi kaam karte hai
 Reiki sekhem-sechim reki sekhem-sechim misr ke sekhem shabd se uddhrut he, jiskaa arth "shaktiyon kii shakti"
 It was founded by Patrick Ziegler
 SKHM us vidhi kaa dyotak he jisamen aaj patric urja ke saath apane kaam ko sandarbhit karata he
 In 1979, Patrick Ziegler entered the accelerated energy of SKHM in the Pyramids of Schiops, and after that he was educated with Sheikh Mohammed Osman Brahani
 san 1984 main, zigler christine garbar jisane maraat, jo ek 2500 saal puraani aatma thi or saath hi master sechim bhi thi jisane jaankaree aage saunpi, ko saunpa, jisase zealgar sechim reki main shuruyaat kar sakaa
 In 1984, Tom Seeman taught Sechim Reiki to Tom Seaman, which today is a major contributor to the expansion of this system
 san 1985 main, finics samarfild ne saat atirikt pratikon kii rachana kii or sechim kaa prashikshan dene laga
 Between 1985 and 1987, Summerfield started training in Sechim in Australia, and the system continued to spread throughout the world
 san 1995 main, shumekar reki kaa master ban gaya or usne shechim ke rup main apana pehla charan praapt kiya
 In 1996 Schumaker became a Shachim Master and started training Sechim Reiki
 san 1997 main ek aakasmik shuruuaat die jane ke baad shumekar ne sekhem kaa duusare paksh pradaan karnaa shuru kar diya or sekhem-sechim reki kaa nirmaan kiya
 Schumaker and Marsha Burac are members of similar trainings and finally
 reki shikshaaon kaa daawa he ki ek atoot, saarvajanik "jivan shakti" aadhyatmik urja kaa astitv he, jiskaa paupyogupachaar kaa prabhaav daalane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Believers on this say that anyone can access this energy through the adjustment process done by the Reiki Master
 aisi urja ke liye kiye gaye daavon kaa koi saidhantik yaa jaivbhautik aadhaar nahin hota
 Followers of Reiki have described it as a sacred healing that is healing at physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels
 aisa mana jaataa he ki jab bhi chikitsak ke haath kisi sambhavit praptakarta par rakhe jaaenge yaa uske sameep rakhe jaaenge, jise vastra pahanaae ja sakate hai, tab urja kaa sanchaar uske haathon ke madhyam se hoga
 Some teachings emphasize the intent of the practitioner or the importance of his or her presence in the process, while others claim that energy is drawn from the Reiki recipient's wound to activate or move natural healing processes
 in sabake saath hi yah bhi mana jaataa he ki urja "budhimaan" he, at: rog kii pahchaan karnaa aavashyak nahin hota
 It is said that in the second stage of training, with another start, the practitioner is prepared in such a way that he can perform Reiki treatments remotely
 yah kaha gaya he ki is vidhi main chikitsak or praptakarta ke bich, sthano kii vibhinnata ke baavjood ek asthaayee conection banane or reki urja bhejne ke liye vishesh pratikon kaa upyog kiya janaa shaamil he
 Such techniques are also taught by which Reiki can be sent at a certain point in time, or in the past or in the future
 kisi sampurna sharir ke reki upachaar main chikitsak praptakarta ko, aksar kisi maalish kii mez par, letkar aaraam karne ko kahata he
 Usually, loose, comfortable clothes are worn during treatment
 chikitsak ko apane mastishk ko ek shant or dhyanayukt sthiti main pahunchane or swayan ko upachaar hetu maansik rup se taiyaar karne main kuch kshan lag sakate hai, or yah aksar bina kisi anaavashyak baatcheet ke kiya jaataa he
 The treatment proceeds by placing the physician in various postures on the recipient
 haalanki, ho saktaa he ki chikitsak aisi sparsharahit takanic kaa upyog karen, jisamen haath kuch yaa sabhi sthanon ke liye praptakarta ke sharir se kuch centimetre dur rakhe jate hai
 It is kept for 3 to 5 minutes before hand is moved to the next location
 samagrata main, haath ke sthaan saamaanya rup se sir, dhad ke agr bhaag or peeth, ghutanon or pairon tak aksar hote hai
 Approximately 12 to 20 locations are used, with the entire treatment lasting from 45 to 90 minutes
 kuch chikitsak haath ke sthanon ke ek nishchit samooh kaa upyog karte hai
 Others use their intuition to find out where treatment is needed, sometimes scanning the recipient to initiate treatment to detect such areas
 apane antargyaan ke upyog kii vidhi ke kaaran alag alag sthanon ke upachaar main bahut kam yaa bahut adhik samay bhi lag saktaa he
 It has been reported that the recipient often feels a rash or a tickle at the place where treatment is being performed, despite the use of the touchless method
 upachaar ke foran baad aksar in prabhaavon ko sabase adhik mahasoos kiya gaya he purna aaraam kii sthiti ke saath thik hone jaisaa mahasoos karnaa, haalanki isse bhaavnaatmak nirgaman bhi ho saktaa he
 As the Reiki treatment is called provoking natural healing procedures, it is usually not seen to treat specific health problems immediately
 yadi kisi puraane rog kaa upachaar ho rahaa he to uske liye teen yaa adhik upachaaron kii shrunkhlaa kii anushansa kii jaati he jisamen in upachaaron ke bich 1 se 7 din ke viraam hote hai
 Regular treatment can be used to maintain good health
 aise upachaaron ke bich antaraal visheshkar 1 se 4 saptahon ke bich rahata he, yah antaraal keval usee paristhiti main nahin hota, jab swayan kaa upachaar ho rahaa hota he or jab dainik kriya saamaanya baat hoti he
 Reiki treatments of a particular area include the practitioner placing his or her hands in or close to a specific area of the body
 tazaa zakhmon kaa ilaaj aksar isi tarah kiya jaataa he, or haathon ko zakhm ke sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he
 The duration of such treatments varies considerably, although a duration of 20 minutes may be common
 kuch chikitsak nishchit rogon ke liye in vishesh kshetra ke upachaaron kaa upyog karte hai or kuch prakashnon ne haath ke upyukt sthanon ko talikabaddh kiya he
 However, other physicians prefer to treat the entire body for all chronic diseases, the basis being that its effect is more pure
 ek or tarika yah he ki puure sharir kaa upachaar karne ke baad, vishesh kshetron kaa upachaar kiya jaae
 Reiki training outside of Japan is usually divided into three levels, or degrees
 reki course kii pehali degree main buniyadi siddhant or prakriyaayein sikhaai jaati hai
 The four "attunements" the teacher has given to the student include teaching the pupils places to place their hands on the recipient's body, which are considered the best facilitators of the whole body healing process
 pehali degree puri karne ke baad iskaa sahabhaagi apana or anya logon kaa reki ke zarie upachaar kar saktaa he
 Traditionally the duration of this course is four sessions, which are often offered for 2,3 or 4 consecutive days
 reki ke duusare degree course main, shishyon ko un teen pratikon kaa upyog karnaa sikhaaya jaataa he jinke bare main yah mana jaataa he ki ve takat badhaate hai or us duuri ko badhaate hai jisase prabhaav par jor lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The pupil is given another adjustment, which is said to further enhance the ability of Reiki to communicate through the pupil and also enable him to use symbols
 doosraa str paar karne ke baad, shishy praptakarta ke paas shaareerik rup se upasthit na rahete hue bhi apana kaam kar saktaa he
 Through the third degree or "master training" the student becomes a Reiki Master
 ek yaa adhik samaayojan kiye jate hai or shishy dai ko myo naamak ek agle master-stareey pratik ke bare main sikhta he
 After completing the master training, the new Reiki master can adjust others to Reiki and teach three degrees of Reiki
 master prashikshan kii avadhi, reki ke skool or us reki master ke darshan par nirbhar jo yah prashikshan de rahaa he, ek din se lekar ek saal yaa usase adhik kuch bhi ho sakati he
 There are many variations in training methods, speeds and costs
 na to reki kaa koi aadhikarik sanghathan he or na hi is kriya kaa koi niyam maujuud he
 Reiki courses can also be taken on the Internet, although conservatives believe that adjustments must be made individually to gain influence, as a master / teacher adjusting Reiki must be able to touch the energy field of the adjustable person it happens
 kuch paramparawaadiyon kaa yah maananaa he ki prayek vidhi jo reki ko "jaldi" sikhaati he, vah utana adhik prabhaav nahin chhod sakati, kyonki anubhav or is kala kii rogi mastary kaa koi vikalp maujuud nahin he
 Reiki's scientific studies are complicated by the fact that to perform a placebo-controlled study, it is necessary to make the placebo such that it looks like a treatment in every way
 san 2008 main kiya gaya sabase bada shodh reki ko sabhi paristhitiyon main ek prabhavi upachaar ke rup main darshane main vifal rahaa he
 This systematic review evaluated this evidence base and found nine studies that met their selection criteria
 ankhe band kiye hue chikitsakon kii kathinaayee ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vidhiyukt gunvattta ke ek sanshodhit jadd score kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 Studies that were not randomized were excluded from the study, as such studies are more likely to have intentionally or unintentionally prejudiced, making it impossible to analyze the results
 kul milakar, pramaan aadhaar kii vidhiyukt gunvattta kii ichha mahasoos kii gai thi, kyonki ucch-stareey adhyayan bhi placebo prabhaavon ko niyantrit karne main purna rup se vifal rahe or adhikansh adhyayanon main "chote aakaar ke namoonay adhyayan hetu aparyaapt dizine or garastareey reporting jaisi vidhiyukt trutiyaan" pai gayi
 Tests involving such errors are more likely to show exaggerated healing effects, so evidence is insufficient to indicate that Reiki is effective as a self-sustaining or adjunct therapy for each medical condition, or beyond the potential placebo effects
 Any benefits also exist
 reki main suraksha ke bare main chintaaen anya apramanit vaikalpik aushadhiyon ke samaan hi hai
 Medical doctors and allied health workers believe that patients in serious situations may abstain from officially certified treatments in favor of unproven alternative medicines
 reki chikitsak yah kehete hue apane graahakon ko gambhir paristhitiyon main medical doctor se milane ke liye protsaahit kar sakate hai ki reki ko ek paramparaagat poorak chikitsa ke rup main prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 No significant adverse effects have been reported with the use of Reiki in clinical trials
 swasthya ke naam par jaalsaji ke viruddh sanchalit rashtriya parishad neshnal council against health frod ne yah suzav diya he ki reki kaa prayek naidanik prabhaav suzav ke kaaran aayaa ho saktaa he, or reki ko ek "fil-good" upachaar kaa naam diya jaae, jisase praptakarta swayan hi kisi mahatvapurn upachaar prabhaav kii apeksha na karen
 Since there are many different ways to teach Reiki, there exist emerging points of controversy between different groups, teachers and practitioners
 vishyon jaise reki urja kii prakruti, paathyakramon or upachaaron ke liye liya jane vaala shulk, prashikshan vidhiyon, pratikon kii gopneeyata or samaayojan vidhiyaan, par vivaad maujuud hai
 Since the death of Hawayo Takata, until the mid-1990s, there have been contradictory claims about who created the post of "grandmaster" of Reiki
 baharhaal, jab yah paaya gaya ki takaata ne swayan hi is shabd kii rachana kii thi, tab yah vivaad bahut had tak samaapt ho gaya
 In March 2009, a Committee on the Doctrine of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued an order that prohibited the practice of Reiki by Catholics, including prohibiting the use of Reiki treatment in some Catholic monastic centers and hospitals
 Was
 aadesh ke nishkarsh main kaha gaya tha "chunki reki upachaar na to isai shikshaaon se sangat he or na hi iskaa koi vaigyanik pramaan maujuud he, at: catholic sansthaaon jaise catholic swasthya seva suvidhaon or ekal kendron, athwa carch kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale vyaktiyon jaise catholic padariyon ke liye yah upyukt nahin he ki ve reki upachaar kaa prachaar karen yaa use samarthan den

 They will shoot in one direction, by having cameras installed there
 Then i would like all the cameras to move in the other direction and shoot again and then shout that there is a delay
