 - SONAL CHAUHAN (@ sonalchauhan7) April 18, 2019 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha he kinyaaypalikaki jimmedaari he ki vah dharmanirpekshata kii raksha kare
 He also urged the security forces to stay away from religious appeals
 unhone dharmanirpekshata ko samvidhan kaa moulik swaroop bataate hue kaha he 'sarvapratham, ek sanstha ke rup main nyaaypalika ke liye yah behad jaruri he ki vah samvidhan main nihit dharmanirpekshata ke swaroop kaa sangrakshan karne kii apni praathmik jimmedaari ko najrandaaj na kare
 'defense of Secularism is the responsibility of the judiciary
 singh ne mangalvaar ko commeredabi vardhanasmriti vyakhaan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'samvidhan ke dharmanirpeksh swaroop kaa sangrakshan karne ke makasad ko puraa karne kii maang pehle ke mukaable maujuuda daur main or bhi adhik jaruri ho gai he
 The presence of religious elements, symbols, myths and prejudices in political protests and electoral battles has also increased considerably
 'dow
 Singh said that military forces also need to keep themselves untouched by religious appeals
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya sashastr bal desh ke shandaar dharmanirpeksh swaroop kaa abhinn hissaa hai
 It is therefore important that the armed forces keep themselves untouched by communal appeals
 purv piem ne bhakpa dwaara 'dharmanirpekshata or loktantr kii raksha' vishay par yojit duusare abi bardhan vyaakhyaan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'hamen nisandeh yah samajhnaa chahie ki apane ganatantr ke dharmanirpeksh swaroop ko kamjor karne koi bhi koshish vyapak rup se samaan adhikaaravaadi soch ko behaal ke prayaason ko nasht karegi
 He said that the success of these efforts lies in all constitutional bodies
 purv pradhanmantri ne babari masjid maamle kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki 1990 ke dashak ke shuruaati daur main raajnneetik dalon or rajanetaaon ke bich bahusankhyak or alpsankhyakon ke sah astitv ko lekar shuru hua jhagada asanyat str par pahunch gaya he
 He said, 'the feud of politicians over the Babri Masjid ended in the Supreme Court and the judges had to reinstate the secular form of the constitution by restoring it
 'babari masjid dhwans dardanaak ghatnadow
 Singh described the demolition of Babri Masjid as a tragic event
 unhone kaha kaha, 'chah disambar 1992 kaa din hamaare dharmanirpeksh ganatantr ke liye dukhadaayi din tha or isse hamaari dharmanirpeksh patibaddhtaon ko aghat pahunchaa
 He said that the Supreme Court, in the SR Bommai case, described secularism as part of the fundamental nature of the Constitution
 congress netaa ne kaha ki durbhagyavash yah santoshjanak sthiti kam samay ke liye hi kaayam rahi, kyonki bommai maamle ke kuch samay baad hi 'hindutv ko jeevanstyli' bataate vaala nyaayamurti je es verma kaa mashhoor kintu vivaadit faisla aa gaya
 This had a decisive impact on the ongoing debate between political parties about secular principles in the democratic system
 samaaj kii jimmedaariunhone kaha ki nyaayadhishon kii sajagata or bauddhik kshamtaaon ke baavjood koi bhi sanvaidhanik vyavastha sirf nyaaypalika dwaara sangrakshit nahin kii ja sakati he
 Ultimately, the responsibility of preserving the Constitution and its secular commitments rests with the political leadership, civil society, religious leaders and the enlightened class
 dow
 Singh cautioned that it is not easy to achieve the goal of preserving secularism in this country with centuries-old stereotypes of inequality and discrimination
 unhone kaha ki aakhirkaar, saamaajik bhedbhaav kaa ekmaatr aadhaar dharm nahin he
 Sometimes the helpless people who have been marginalized on the basis of caste, language and gender become victims of violence, discrimination and injustice

 There is perfection in imperfection and that is the beauty and the challenge of this human life

 '' teen rajyon main chunaav main mili haar ke baad, yogi adityanath bhi virodhiyon ke nishane par he koi unhen bajrang bali kii jati bataane ke liye haar kaa jimmedaar maan rahaa he to koi ali or bajrangbali tippanee ke liye unhen kos rahaa he, lekin in teen chunaavon ke aankde kuch or hi kahani bayaan kar rahe hai
 Talking about the figures, Yogi Adityanath has the highest strike rate among the star campaigners who won the mlas
 yogi adityanath ne apane 69 fisadi un ummidavaaron ko jita liya, jinke paksh main unhone chunaav prachaar kiya
 In four states, Yogi Adityanath held a total of 74 gatherings, in separate assemblies and BJP won 51 of these 74 seats
 strike rate ke hisaab se yogi adityanath kaa pradarshan sabase shandaar rahaa
 Explain that despite the bad defeat in Chhattisgarh, there are 8 such seats where Yogi Adityanath campaigned in bjp's 17 seats
 yani chhatisgarh main bhi yogi apane prachaar ke 50 fisadi se zyada seat jita le gaye
 Yogi Adityanath had the most impressive record of 25 candidates in the 26 assembly elections in Rajasthan where 25 candidates won in Yogi Adityanath's 26 assembly elections
 madhyapradesh main bhi yogi 17 ummidavaaron ko jitaane main kaamyaab rahe, jinke paksh main unhone chunaav prachaar kiya
 After the results of these elections, the opponents are imposing the responsibility of defeating Jahan Yogi
 vahiin yogi ke samarthak unhen bhavishya kaa cheharaa maan rahe hai
 Tell us that many leaders of these states, aware of Yogi's strike rate, wanted their meetings directly in their constituencies, but if sources close to Yogi Adityanath, Yogi Adityanath kept his political meetings according to the instructions given by the BJP high command, ever Yogi Did not decide his choice and never refused meetings
 yahi vajah he ki ankhon main infections or sujan ke baavjood yogi adityanath kaala chashma lagaakar ek din main chaar-chaar sabhaayen karte rahe

 india today anti phek news waar rum (AFWA) kii jaanch main yah saamne aayaa ki general bakshi ke daawey main kai khamiyaan hai
 None of the jawans involved in this incident were ever sent to Tihar Jail

 "who authorized the prosecution of our army jawans who in 2014 shot at a Maruti car which smashed through three check points without stopping?" That person is responsible for this latest SUV to get near the convoy killing 37 CRPF jawans
 The army jawans are still in jail— Subramanian Swamy (@swamy39)february 16, 2019general bakshi ne ek tivi sho ke dauraan kaha, “mahabuuba mufti ke kaarykaal main srinagar ke baahar sena ke teen checkpost lage the
 One day a Kashmiri gentleman came and got very angry that why he was being stopped? Angry, they broke the first barrier, then the second barrier while they were being warned
 jab rokane ke baad bhi vah nahin ruke to sipaahi ne goliyaan chalaa deen or unki maut ho gai
 After this incident, a ruckus erupted
 mahabuuba mufti ne ye sunishchit kiya ki wo jawan jisane goliyaan chalaayin wo aaj tihaad jail main he or us vakt ke commander general the general hooda sahab
 He had to apologize publicly and all those barriers were removed
 ”yahaan general bakshi ke daawey main do tathyaatmak galtiyaan hai
 The incident that General Bakshi and Subrahmanyam Swamy is referring to took place on 3 November 2014 in Chhatargam area of budgam district
 indian express akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabiksham ke kareeb sava 5 baje paanch ladke chhatargam se naugam ke mukhya maarg par ja rahe the jab unki car par 53 rashtriya rifles ke javaanon ne firing kar di
 Two boys died in this firing
 sena or police ne is ghatana ke chashmadidon ke bhi alag-alag bayaan darj kiye ki aakhir aisa kya hua jisase bairicade par goliyaan chalaani padin
 But General Bakshi denied the fact that Mehbooba was in government at that time
 sach ye he ki november 2014 main us vakt umr abdulla jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri the na ki mahabuuba mufti
 The PDP formed the government in April 2015 and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed became the Chief Minister, following his death, Mehbooba took the oath of Chief Minister in April 2016
 jis ghatana kaa zikr ho rahaa he, uske baad puri ghati main sena ke khilaaf jabardast virodh pradarshan or hinsa hui
 In this case, an FIR (no
 231 / 14) was registered in the Chadura police station
 sena ne mana ki ghatana main 53 rashtriya rifles ke javaanon kii galati thi
 According to media reports, orders of the Court of Inquiry were made against the nine jawans
 haalanki is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin he ki is maamle main javaanon ko sajaa hui or unhen tihaad bheja gaya
 a detailed report in this bar also appeared in The Quint, which said that the then lieutenant general DS Hooda made it clear that the reports of the court martial of the youth were false
 sena ne bhi india today ko conform kiya ki javaanon ko kabhi bhi jail nahin bheja gaya tha
 When we asked General Bakshi about his claim, he admitted that the fact that the soldiers were still in jail was wrong, although he insisted that the PDP government was responsible for relaxing the security check rules in the valley

 To make children aware of education, they go to their home and request parents to send children to school because poor children cannot take education in private school, so they are being given all the facilities here
 apni mehnat ke dam mamuna khatun ne is sarkari skool ko ilaake kaa number van skool bana diya he
 She wanders from village to village alone to make parents aware of education
 logon ko samajhaati hai ki wo bacchon ko skool bheje
 It is the result of such hard work that education is going from computer to sports in small town school
 itnaa hi nahin cultural activij par bhi khaas dhyaan diya jaataa he
 She says that she got this inspiration in view of her poverty, because when she was like these children, her parents had risen from above and she fought for poverty and educated herself and the whole family
 is prayaas ke liye principal mamuna khatun kokai awordaur sarkari afasaron se prashasti patr mil chuke hai
 She was also named for the Presidential Medal of Honor, but for some reason she was not selected for it
 inke mutabik sarkari skool main teacher agar bacchon ko mehnat se padhaaen to gaanv ke skool bhi shahar ke kanvent skool ko maat de sakate hai
 There will be no such media institutions, which will have a permanent representative in Chhattisgarh and the news of the situation there will reach you daily
 sukama hamale ke baad aapane tivi screen par ek shabd dekha hoga ground reporting, ground zero se report
 The red color is usually written as Gross Zero
 jahaan se reporting zero he, vahaan ke ground zero se reporting ho rahi he
 For what Ground Zero means, we took the help of two dictionaries, Max Webster and Oxford Dictionary
 inke anusaar jis sataha par yaa thik uske neeche parmaanu visphot hota he, use ground zero kehete hai
 The place where an activity starts or the place where it is called is ground zero
 2001 main neuyark ke world trade tower ko aatankwaadi hamale main gira diya gaya, use ground zero kaha jaataa he
 Many times we should ask ourselves whether we know the exact meaning of the word we are using
 aksar ham nahin jaanate hai
 We mean media
 aap to sab jaanate hai
 Mentioned the words because the words which are being used after the Naxal attack, look carefully at it
 sukama hamale ke baad kis tathy or tark ke aadhaar par kai channelon ne naksal samasya ke khatme kaa elaan kar diya he, hairaani hoti he
 It is being presented as if the last fort or the last fortress is left which is about to collapse after the road is built
 kya sab kuch itnaa aasaan he ki patrkaar ek din kii ground reporting se ye jaan gaya he
 Even if you do not care about these things, there is no harm to you, because even after this, private schools will continue to take arbitrary fees and will buy 2000 shoes from you instead of 800
 naksali hamale ke baad ham channelon kii duniya main phir se bhavuk or josh se bhar dene vaale shabd laut aae hai
 As the sacrifice will not go in vain, the lion of Naxalite attack, brave knight, son of Mother India, shaheedon kaa parivaar maange badla, kab lenge balidaan kaa badla, badale kii tarikh bataao
 
 
 We media people have neither more understanding nor any other way through which we can bring the events of Chhattisgarh to you
 ab aapaki bhi training aisi hi ho gai he ki balidaan, bahaduree or badla se aage samajhane kaa na to vakt he na hi dilchaspee
 There are two problems of two words in India
 do shabdon kii in do samasyaon ke peeche lakhon kii sankhya main sena or ardh sainik bal lage hai
 Their names are Kashmir problem and Naxal problem
 naksal samasya ke kaaran kya hai, ab kya nayaa ho rahaa he, kahaan se log aate hai, kahaan se bandook aati he, kahaan se inke paas military training he ki siarpief ke javaanon ko ghaat lagaakar maar dete hai, barudi surang bicha dete hai, ye sab kisi ko kuch nahin maaloom he
 It is said that demonetisation has reduced terrorism and Naxalism
 yah sari baaten public main chal bhi gayi
 What i mean to say is that neither does it reach us that why the Naxalite problem is there even after so many years, nor what is being done to overcome it
 bandook hi samaadhaan he to bandook ko itnaa vakt kyon lag rahaa he
 It is obvious that time and patience are needed to understand and hear all this which neither we nor you have
 isliye tivi screen par is tarah kii panktiyaan uchhal rahi hai ki kab liya jayega badla, balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 The same thing was said on March 11, when a major attack on the CRPF was carried out by Naxalites in Sukma itself
 din ke sava nau baje hamalaa hua jab siarpief ke 112 jawan gasht par the
 Were emptying the road
 100 se adhik naksaliyon ne javaanon par hamalaa bol diya or baari maatra main hathiyaar lut liye
 12 CRPF personnel were killed in this attack
 media ne 11 march ke hamale ko 2017 kaa sabase bada naksali hamalaa bataaya tha
 Even on 11 March, the media wrote that the CRPF does not have a permanent head, even after the April 24 attack, the media said why the CRPF does not have a permanent head
 yah sawaal to thik he, lekin sthaayee mukhiya hone se hamalaa nahin hota yaa sthiti main sudhaar ho jaataa, isaki kya guarantee he
 In this Sukma, 76 years ago, Naxalites killed 76 soldiers
 is baar 25 javaanon ko maar diya he
 If justice would have been obtained or retaliated by sentimental words, then the problems of these two words would have ended
 media to balidaan kaa badla kii taarikh bhi puch rahaa he
 The date asker can be asked whether everything is sacrificed or revenge or the policy-strategy of fighting the Naxalite problem will also be reviewed sometime
 itnaa badlaav to aa hi gaya he ki ab in hamalon ke baad kisi se istipha nahin maanga jaataa he, kisi kii javabdehi tay nahin hoti he
 Even during the Sukma attack, the Prime Minister spoke to the Home Minister, took stock of the situation and went to Sukma
 ghatana kii ninda kii gai thi or tab bhi kaha gaya tha ki javaanon kaa balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 Reporting of all incidents is also becoming a permanent reaction of leaders
 badla le liya jayega to kya naksal samasya dur ho jaaegi or badla 24 april kii ghatana kaa hi kyon liya jayega, kya 11 march ko maare gaye 12 javaanon kaa badla nahin liya jayega
 Why were they not replaced? main bas itnaa kah rahaa hum ki tivi or raajnneeti ne jo aapako bhashaa di he, usamen aap funs gaye hai, aap hi nahin ham bhi funs gaye hai
 This is the language of illusion, which only creates perception, not information and review
 siarpief ke bahadur javaanon ko suniye
 Then think how after all the patrols, 300 Naxalites came out in front of the common tribal people and shielded them
 wo bhi din ke vakt
 This is the second major lapse within a month
 doosraa bada hamalaa he
 In a month, 38 of our soldiers have been martyred
 kya ham yah sawaal puch sakate hai ki jo teen sau naksali kaale libaas main aae the jinhone baari maatra main hathiyaaron ko lutaa, javaanon ko maaraa or media main kya dikh rahaa he, unke chode hue kapade, pani kii bottlen or goliyon ke khokhe
 Where did these Naxalites come in such large numbers and disappeared after killing so many soldiers
 ab drone servilans, upgrah se lee jane vaali tasveeron kii baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
 At the time of the attack, our soldiers will be equipped with information technology, then why do we not know how these Naxalites who attacked the soldiers become so successful
 us paksh ke bare main koi mukammal khabar kyon nahin hoti he
 Don't you find it frightening, soldiers have been under attack for so many years, we and you have been talking the same things for so many years
 100 ke kareeb siarpief javaanon par hamalaa hua he
 They are also trained to go to war and Naxal-affected areas
 hamale ke bare main adhikariyon ke varnan bataate hai ki naksaliyon kaa palada baari tha
 Purse and mobiles of Naxalite jawans have also been looted in the attack
 unhen itnaa vakt kaise mila
 Even after these statements of the officials, many times it seems that the incident is not being accurately estimated
 kya 100 hathiyaarband javaanon ko gher lenaa itnaa aasaan hota he
 25 soldiers have died
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kuch naksali bhi maare gaye hai, jab ve 300 kii sankhya main aae the tab kuch hi naksali kyon maare gaye, par ek baat he, siarpief ke javaanon ne sadak nirmaan ke kaam main lage 40 logon ko bachaa bhi liya
 This side of his bravery is no less spectacular
 shahadat bekaar nahin jaaegi, har baat isi par khatm hoti he, isse shuru nahin hoti he ki shahadat hui hi kyon
 This is how someone will surround our soldiers and kill them
 naksaliyon ne siarpief ke javaanon se jo lutpaat kii he, uski suchi is prakaar he- kul 22 hathiyaar luute gaye, 12 eke 47 rifl (inamen se paanch par under bairal grenade launture the), ekeem - 4, insaas lite mashinagan- 2, insaas rifl- 3, wireles set - 5, binocular - 2, bullate pruf jacket-22, dsemdi - 1 ( deep search metal detector) , eke 47 - 59 magazine, ekeem - 16 magazine, insaas lmaji - 16 magazine, insaas rifl - 15 magazine, goli-barood, eke / ekeem - 2820 round, insaas - 600 round, upijiel - 62 round
 The comments chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha he ki sukama kii ladaai desh kii sabase badi ladaai he

 What does such talk mean that we are fighting the biggest battle of the country without any strategy

 us paksh ke bare main koi mukammal khabar kyon nahin hoti he
 Don't you find it frightening, soldiers have been under attack for so many years, we and you have been talking the same things for so many years
 100 ke kareeb siarpief javaanon par hamalaa hua he
 They are also trained to go to war and Naxal-affected areas
 hamale ke bare main adhikariyon ke varnan bataate hai ki naksaliyon kaa palada baari tha
 Purse and mobiles of Naxalite jawans have also been looted in the attack
 unhen itnaa vakt kaise mila
 Even after these statements of the officials, many times it seems that the incident is not being accurately estimated
 kya 100 hathiyaarband javaanon ko gher lenaa itnaa aasaan hota he
 25 soldiers have died
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kuch naksali bhi maare gaye hai, jab ve 300 kii sankhya main aae the tab kuch hi naksali kyon maare gaye, par ek baat he, siarpief ke javaanon ne sadak nirmaan ke kaam main lage 40 logon ko bachaa bhi liya
 This side of his bravery is no less spectacular
 shahadat bekaar nahin jaaegi, har baat isi par khatm hoti he, isse shuru nahin hoti he ki shahadat hui hi kyon
 This is how someone will surround our soldiers and kill them
 naksaliyon ne siarpief ke javaanon se jo lutpaat kii he, uski suchi is prakaar he- kul 22 hathiyaar luute gaye, 12 eke 47 rifl (inamen se paanch par under bairal grenade launture the), ekeem - 4, insaas lite mashinagan- 2, insaas rifl- 3, wireles set - 5, binocular - 2, bullate pruf jacket-22, dsemdi - 1 ( deep search metal detector) , eke 47 - 59 magazine, ekeem - 16 magazine, insaas lmaji - 16 magazine, insaas rifl - 15 magazine, goli-barood, eke / ekeem - 2820 round, insaas - 600 round, upijiel - 62 round
 The comments chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne kaha he ki sukama kii ladaai desh kii sabase badi ladaai he
 The time has come to move forward with a strategy
 kya ek ranneeti ke saath aage badhane kaa samay 25 javaanon kii maut or 7 ke ghayal hone ke baad hi aayaa he, agar sukama kii ladaai desh kii sabase badi ladaai he to uskaa samay kya 25 april ko aayaa he
 What does such talk mean that we are fighting the biggest battle of the country without any strategy
 kahana aasaan he, jinke ghar main balidaan kii khabar pahunchati he un par jo bitati he use ham lachchhedaar shabdon se kya bayaan karen
 Want you to hear the voice
 mahasoos kiijie ki jinhen ham sirf shahadat balidaan ke frem main dekhte hai unhen ghar main pati, bhai, pita, bhatija na jane kis-kis frem main dekha jaataa hoga
 In this Sukma, 76 years ago, Naxalites killed 76 soldiers
 is baar 25 javaanon ko maar diya he
 If justice would have been obtained or retaliated by sentimental words, then the problems of these two words would have ended
 media to balidaan kaa badla kii taarikh bhi puch rahaa he
 The date asker can be asked whether everything is sacrificed or revenge or the policy-strategy of fighting the Naxalite problem will also be reviewed sometime
 itnaa badlaav to aa hi gaya he ki ab in hamalon ke baad kisi se istipha nahin maanga jaataa he, kisi kii javabdehi tay nahin hoti he
 Even during the Sukma attack, the Prime Minister spoke to the Home Minister, took stock of the situation and went to Sukma
 ghatana kii ninda kii gai thi or tab bhi kaha gaya tha ki javaanon kaa balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 Reporting of all incidents is also becoming a permanent reaction of leaders
 badla le liya jayega to kya naksal samasya dur ho jaaegi or badla 24 april kii ghatana kaa hi kyon liya jayega, kya 11 march ko maare gaye 12 javaanon kaa badla nahin liya jayega
 Why were they not replaced? main bas itnaa kah rahaa hum ki tivi or raajnneeti ne jo aapako bhashaa di he, usamen aap funs gaye hai, aap hi nahin ham bhi funs gaye hai
 This is the language of illusion, which only creates perception, not information and review
 siarpief ke bahadur javaanon ko suniye
 Then think how after all the patrols, 300 Naxalites came out in front of the common tribal people and shielded them
 wo bhi din ke vakt
 This is the second major lapse within a month
 doosraa bada hamalaa he
 In a month, 38 of our soldiers have been martyred
 kya ham yah sawaal puch sakate hai ki jo teen sau naksali kaale libaas main aae the jinhone baari maatra main hathiyaaron ko lutaa, javaanon ko maaraa or media main kya dikh rahaa he, unke chode hue kapade, pani kii bottlen or goliyon ke khokhe
 Where did these Naxalites come in such large numbers and disappeared after killing so many soldiers
 ab drone servilans, upgrah se lee jane vaali tasveeron kii baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
