 Hypertension or hypertension, sometimes called arterial hypertension, is a chronic medical condition in which blood pressure in the arteries increases
 dabaav kii is vruddhi ke kaaran, rakt kii dhamniyon main rakt kaa pravaah banaaye rakhane ke liye dil ko saamaanya se adhik kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Blood pressure involves two measurements, systolic and diastolic, depending on whether the heart muscle is contracting or in tension between beats
 aaraam ke samay par saamaanya raktchaap 100-140 mmhg systolic or 60-90 mmhg diastolic kii seemaa ke bheetar hota he
 Hypertension is present if it persists at or above 90 / 140 mmhg
 hisertension praathmik ucch raktchaap tathaa dwitiyak ucch raktchaap ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 90–95% of cases are classified as "primary hypertension", meaning hypertension without a clear underlying medical cause
 anya paristhitiyaan jo gurde, dhamniyon, dil, yaa antahsravi pranali ko prabhavit karti hai, shesh 5-10% maamalon kaa kaaran hotin hai
 Hypertension is a risk factor such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arterial artery dilatation, peripheral artery disease and is a cause of chronic kidney disease
 dhamniyon se rakt ke dabaav main madhyam darje kii vruddhi bhi jivan pratyaasha main kami ke saath judi hui he
 Diet and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure control and reduce the risk of related health complications
 haalanki, dawa ke madhyam se upachaar aksar un logon ke liye jaruri ho jaataa he jinamein jivan style main parivartan aprabhavi yaa aparyaapt hai
 Hypertension in people aged 18 years or older is defined by the systolic and / or diastolic blood pressure measurement being consistently higher than the accepted normal value)
 yadi mapank 24 ghante albyulence yaa ghar kii nigaraanee se liye gayi hai, to kam seemaantar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 To illustrate the continuum of risk with hypertension in the normal range, international hypertension guidelines have recently been enacted which are below the hypertension limit
 JNC7 hisertension shabd ko 120-139 mmhg systolic or / yaa 80-89 mmhg diastolic raktchaap kii paraas ke liye upyog karata he, jabaki 140 mmhg systolic or 90 mmhg diastolic dabaav ko pratibhaag karne ke liye ESH - ECS ke disha nirdeshon or BHS IV ishtatam, saamaanya or ucch saamaanya shreniyon kaa upyog karata he
 Hypertension is also subclassified as: JNC7 distinguishes hypertension as stage I, hypertension stage II, and isolated systolic blood pressure
 pruthak systolic raktchaap saamaanya diastolic dabaav ke saath oonche systolic dabaav ke rup main janaa jaataa he or bujurgon main aam he
 The ESH - ESC guidelines and BHS IV prescribe a third stage for those with systolic blood pressure 179mmhg or diastolic pressure 109 mmhg
 agar dawaaen raktchaap ko kam karke saamaanya str tak nahin laati hai to ucch raktchaap "pratirodhi" ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Hypertension is rare in newborns and occurs in 0
2 to 3% of newborns
 swasth navjaat main raktchaap niyamit rup se nahin mapa jaataa he
 Hypertension is more common in high-risk newborns
 gastitational umr, postconceptional umr or janm ke samay vajan jaise karkon ko dhyaan main rakh kar yah tay kiya jaataa he ki kisi navjaat shishu main raktchaap saamaanya he athwa nahin
 Hypertension in children and adolescents is quite common and is associated with long-term risk of poor health
 ab yah sifarish kii jaati he ki teen saal kii umr se adhik bacchon main niyamit chikitsa dekhbhaal ke samay raktchaap kii jaanch kii jaani chaiye
 After several visits it is confirmed that a child has symptoms of high blood pressure
 bachapan main umr ke saath raktchaap bad jaataa he or bacchon main ucch raktchaap ko ausat systolic yaa diastolic raktchaap kii teen yaa chaar baar kii maap ke ausat ke hisaab se tathaa bachche ke ling, umr va oonchai ke liye upyukt maan kii 95 pratishtata ke baraabar yaa ucchtar nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Pre-hypertension in children is considered equal to or greater than 90 percent of systolic or diastolic blood pressure but less than 95 percent
 kishoron main, aam taur par ucch raktchaap or purv-ucchraktchaap kaa nidaan vayask maapdand kaa upyog kar vargeekrut kiya jaataa hai
 High blood pressure rarely shows any symptoms and is usually identified through screening or when care is needed for a health problem unrelated to it
 ucch raktchaap se peedit kuch log sirdard tathaa saath hi chakkar aane kii, vertigo tinitus, drushti parivartan tathaa behoshee kii shikaayat karte hai
 In physical examination, hypertension is suspected when hypertensive retinopathy is detected when examining the optic fundus on the back of the eye using ophthalmoscopy
 pratishthit rup se, ucch raktchaap se grast retinopathy main parivartan kii gambhirtha ko i se IV tak kii shrenee main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, haalanki iske adhik halke prakaaron kaa ek duusare se bhed karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Ophthalmoscopy findings may also indicate how long a person has been suffering from hypertension
 kuch atirikt sanket or lakshan dwitiyak ucch-raktchaap, kaa sanket de sakate hai jo kisi pahchaan yogya kaarnon jaise gurde kii bimariyon yaa antahsravi rog ke ke kaaran hone vaala ucch-raktchaap he
 For example, chest and flatulence, glucose intolerance, moon countenance, "buffalo hemp" and purple stripes indicate Cushing's syndrome
 thyride rog or atikayata bhi ucch raktchaap kaa kaaran ho sakate hai or inke vishisht lakshan or sanket hote hai
 Abdominal sound can be a sign of renal artery disease
 pairon main raktchaap main kami yaa jaangh kii dhamniyon ke spandan main vilamb yaa anupasthiti, mahadhamani nisankuchan kaa sanket ho sakati he
 Hypertension that decreases widely with headache, numbness, pallor, and sweating should be considered a sign of suspicion of pheochromocytoma
 gambhir rup se ucch raktchaap "ucch raktchaap sambandhi sankat" ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Blood pressure above these levels indicates a high risk of complications
 is shrenee main raktchaap se grasit logon ke saath koi lakshan nahin bhi ho saktaa he, lekin aise logon ko sirdard yaa chakkar aane kii shikaayat kiye jane kii sambhaavna aam logon se adhik hoti he
 Other symptoms of a hypertensive crisis may include a loss of vision or shortness of breath due to heart failure, or a general feeling of discomfort due to kidney failure
 ucch raktchaap se grast sankat se grast adhikansh logon kaa raktchaap ooncha hota he, lekin achaanak vruddhi ke liye atirikt kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 "hypertensive emergencies", previously called "fatal hypertension", occur when there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs as a result of severely elevated blood pressure
 is kshati main mastishk main sujan or shithilataa ke kaaran hone vaala ucch raktchaap se grast insefolopathy, shaamil ho saktaa he jo sir dard or chetana ke parivartit str dwaara ise pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Retinal papelodema and fundal hemorrhage and slow secretion are other signs of target organ damage
 seene main dard hriday kii mansapeshiy kshati yaa kabhi-kabhi mahadhamani vichchhedan, mahadhamani kii bhitari diwaar main faton kaa sanket ho saktaa he
 Shortness of breath, cough, phlegm and blood-spitting sputum are symptoms of pulmonary edema
 yah sthiti, dil ke baayen ventrical kii aakshamata ke kaaran fefde ke utakon main sujan kii he jo hriday ke baayen ventrical dwaara fefdon se dhamniyon kii pranali main paryaapt rup se rakt pump karne kii aakshamata he
 Rapid deterioration of the renal function and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may also occur
 in sthitiyon main, angon kii kshati ko rokane ke liye raktchaap main teji se kami aavashyak hoti he
 In contrast, there is no evidence that rapid hypertension is required in hypertensive exacerbations where there is no evidence of damage to the target organs
 raktchaap kii kami main ati-aakraamakata kisi jokhim ke bina nahin hoti he
 In hypertension-related exacerbations, oral medication is advocated to reduce blood pressure gradually over 24 to 48 hours
 garbhadhaaran ke lagbhag 8-10% maamalon main ucch raktchaap kii samasya hoti he
 Primary hypertension is already present in women with pregnancy hypertension
 garbhavastha main ucch raktchaap purv-eklanpashia, kaa pehla sanket ho saktaa he jo ki garbhavastha kii duusare aadhe bhaag kii tathaa prasav ke kuch hafto baad kii gambhir sthiti he
 Diagnosis of pre-eclampsia includes increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine
 purv-eklanpashia garbhadhaaran ke lagbhag 5% maamalon main hota he or vishwa str par sabhi matra mrityu ke lagbhag 16% maamalon ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of death of children
 aamtaur par purv-eklanpashia kaa koi lakshan nahin hota hai or yah niyamit jaanch se hi pataa chalata he
 When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur, the most common are headaches, visual disturbances, vomiting, epigastric pain, and edema
 purv-eklanpashia kabhi-kabhi jivan ke liye ek khatarnaak sthiti eklanpashia tak pahunch jaati he
 Eclampsia is a hypertension-related emergency
it includes many serious complications
 in jatiltaaon main drushti kaa khona, mastishk main sujan daure yaa kanpakpi, gurde kii vifaltaa, fefde kaa adema or ek yaa adhik rakt vahikaaon main khun kaa jamana shaamil hai
 In newborns and young infants, a decrease in growth, seizures, irritability, loss of energy and difficulty in breathing can be associated with hypertension
 bade shishuon or bacchon main, ucch raktchaap, sirdard, aspasht chidchidapan, thakaan, badhat main kami dhundhlee drushti, nakseer footnaa, or chehre kaa pakshaaghaat ho saktaa he
 Hypertension is the most important preventable risk factor for premature death worldwide
 yah ischemic hriday rog stroke, paridhiy sanvahani rog, or anya hriday rogon jisamen dil kii vifaltaa, mahadhamani dhamneevisphar, dfus atheroscliroses or phuffusiya ant: shalyata shaamil he, ke jokhim ko badhaava detaa he
 High blood pressure is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, dementia, and complex kidney disease
 anya jatiltaaon main shaamil hai: Primary hypertension, the most common form of hypertension, accounts for 90–95% of all cases of hypertension
 lagbhag sabhi samakaleen samaajon main, umr badhane ke saath raktchaap badhata he tathaa baad ke jivan main ucch raktchaap se grast hone kaa khatra kaaphi bad jaataa he
 a complex combination of genes and environmental factors leads to hypertension
 raktchaap par halkaa prabhaav daalane vaali kai aam jeenon kii pahchaan kii gayi he saath hi raktchaap par adhik prabhaav daalane vaali kuch durlabh jin bhi pataa chali hai lekin ucch raktchaap kaa anuvanshik aadhaar abhi bhi behad kam samajha gaya he
 Several environmental factors affect blood pressure
 jivan style se sambandhit kuch kaarak hai jo raktchaap kam karte hai jinamein aahaar main namak kii maatra kam karnaa, fal or kam vasa vaale utpaadon ko aahaar main badhanaa shaamil hai
 Exercise, weight loss and low alcohol consumption also help in lowering blood pressure
 anya karkon jaise tanaav, caffeine kii khapat, or vitamin di kii kami kii sambhavit bhoomika, kam spasht he
 Insulin resistance, which is common in obesity and a component of syndrome X, is also believed to contribute to hypertension
 haal ke adhyayanon se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki praarambhik jivan kii ghatnaayen aavashyak ucch-raktchaap ke liye jokhim kaarak hoti hai
 However, the mechanisms linking these risks to the problem of hypertension in adults are unclear
 dwitiyak ucch raktchaap kisi pahachaane ja sakane vaale kaaran kaa parinaam he
 Kidney disease is the most common among the secondary causes of hypertension
 ucch raktchaap, antahsravi sthitiyon jaise kushing syndrome, hyperthyradism, hypothyradism, echromigeli, con syndrome yaa hikereldostronism tathaa hyperparathyrirodism yaa fiochromocytoma ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, aortic shrinkage, excessive licorice consumption and some prescription drugs, herbal remedies, and illicit drugs
 sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap vaale zyaadaatar logon main, cardiyak output saamaanya rahete huye rakt pravaah kaa badha hua pratirodh ucch dabaav ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 There is evidence that some young people with pre-hypertension or "borderline hypertension" have higher cardiac output, higher heart rate, and general peripheral resistance
 is sthiti ko hyperkainetic simavarti ucch raktchaap kaha jaataa he
 Typical symptoms of established hypertension develop in these individuals later in life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance increases as they age
 yah vivaad kaa vishay he ki yah pattern un sabhi logon par lagu hota he nahin jinamein antat ucch raktchaap kaa vikaas ho jaataa he
 The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly due to the structural narrowing of the small arteries and arteries
 keshikaon kii sankhya yaa ghanatv main kami bhi paridhiy pratirodh main yogadan kar sakati he
 High blood pressure is also associated with a lack of flexibility in peripheral nerves, which can increase the return of blood to the heart, increase cardiac preload, and eventually lead to diastolic abnormality
 rakt vahikaaon kaa sakriy sankuchan sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap main bhoomika nibhaataa he yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 The pulse pressure is often increased in the elderly with hypertension
 is sthiti main aisa systolic dabaav ho saktaa he jo ki asaamaanya rup se ucch ho, lekin diastolic dabaav saamaanya yaa kam ho saktaa he
 This condition is called isolated systolic blood pressure
 bujurg logon main ucch raktchaap yaa pruthak systolic ucch raktchaap ke saath ucch naadee dabaav ko badi huyi dhamneey kathorta dwaara samajha ja saktaa he jo aam taur par umr badhane ke saath juda hua he or ucch raktchaap ke dwaara or bighad saktaa he
 Several mechanisms have been proposed to increase the resistance seen within the arterial system in hypertension
 adhikansh sakshya in kaarnon main se ek yaa donon kii ore ishaara karte hai: These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that both are responsible to some extent in most cases of basic hypertension
 yah bhi sujhaayaa gaya he ki endothelial asamaanyata or sanvahani sujan bhi bade huye paridhiy pratirodh or ucch raktchaap main sanvahani kshati ke liye yogadan kar sakate hai
 Hypertension is diagnosed when the patient is suffering from persistent hypertension
 paramparaagat rup se, nidaan ke liye ek maheene ke antaraal par teen alag raktadabamapi maap kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Initial evaluation of hypertensive patients includes a complete history and physical examination
 24 ghante chal raktchaap monitor or ghar par raktchaap naapane vaali mashiinon kii uplabdhta ke saath, white kot ucch raktchaap vaale rogiyon ke galat nidaan se bachane ke mahatv ne protocol main parivartan kar diya he
 In the United Kingdom, currently the best practice is the follow-up of single reading clinics with ambulatory measurements
 saat din kii avadhi main ghar par raktchaap naapane vaali mashiinon ke madhyam se bhi kam adarsh rup se folsop kaa paalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Once the diagnosis of hypertension is confirmed, physicians attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present
 kishoravastha se purv bacchon main aamtaur dwitiyak ucch raktchaap adhik hota he tathaa adhiktar maamle gurde kii bimariyon se sambandhit hote hai
 Primary or basic hypertension is more common in adolescents
 There are several factors including obesity and family history of hypertension
 dwitiyak ucch raktchaap ke sambhavit kaarnon kii pahchaan karne ke liye tathaa yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye ki kya ucch raktchaap ne hriday, aankhon tathaa gurde ko kshati pahunchaayi he, prayogshaala pareekshan bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 Additional tests are performed for diabetes and high cholesterol levels as these conditions are risk factors for developing heart disease and may require treatment
 serum cretnin kii maap gurde kii beemaari kii upasthiti kaa aankalan karne ke liye kii jaati he, jo yaa to ucch raktchaap kaa kaaran yaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 Serum cratinine alone can significantly exceed glomerular filtering rates
 haal ke disha nirdesh glomerular chanan dar ke aankalan ke liye gurda rog main khuraaq main sanshodhan sutara jaise bhavishyasuchak samikarnon ke upyog kii vakaalat karte hai
 egfr can provide a basic measurement of renal function that can be used to monitor the side effects of some antihypertensive drugs on renal function
 protein ke liye mutr ke namoonon kaa pareekshan bhi gurde kii beemaari ke ek dwitiyak suchak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Electrocardiogram tests are performed to obtain evidence that the heart is under stress due to high blood pressure
 yah hriday kii mansapeshi kaa motaa hona bhi dikhaa saktaa hai yaa yah bataa saktaa he ki kya hriday ko pehle koi maamuli gadabadi jaise mook dil kaa daura hua he
 a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram may be performed to look for heart enlargement or heart damage
 bahut se log ucch raktchaap se grast hai, lekin unako iskaa ehsaas nahin he
 Measures need to be taken to reduce the consequences of hypertension of the entire population and to reduce the need for antihypertensive drug therapy
 raktchaap kam karne ke liye, dawaaon ke madhyam se upachaar shuru karne se pehle jivan style main parivartan kii sifarish kii jaati hai
 For the primary prevention of hypertension, the 2004 guidelines of the British High Blood Pressure Society propose the following lifestyles that conform to the guidelines outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002: prabhavi jivan style sanshodhan bhi raktchaap ko utana hi kam kar sakati he jitani ki koi raktchaparodhi dawa
 Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications may also produce better results
 ucch raktchaap ke liye ilaaj kaa pehla prakaar anumodith bachaav jivan style parivartanon ke samaan hi hai tathaa inamen aahaar sambandhi parivartan, shaareerik vyaayaam tathaa vazan main kameen shaamil hai
 These changes have shown to significantly reduce hypertension in people suffering from hypertension
 agar ucch raktchaap itnaa adhik he ki aushadh upachaar turant karnaa sahi hoga, to bhi jeevanstyli main parivartan anumodith he
 To reduce high blood pressure, various programs designed to reduce psychological stress such as biofeedback, stress relief or meditation are advertised
 haalanki, aam taur par vaigyanik adhyayan, inke prabhaav kaa samarthan nahin karte hai kyonki adhyayan aamtaur par kam gunvattta vaale hai
 Dietary changes such as a low sodium diet are beneficial
 ucch raktchaap vaale logon main or saamaanya raktchaap vaale logon main cokeciens main ek lambii avadhi tak kam sodium aahaar raktchaap ko kam karne main prabhavi he
 In addition, the DASH diet, a diet rich in almonds, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables, which is promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, lowers blood pressure
 yojana kii ek pramukh visheshta sodium kii maatra simit karnaa he, haalanki aahaar potacium, magnesium, calcium or protein main bhi samrudh he
 Several classes of drugs, collectively known as antihypertensive drugs, are currently available for the treatment of hypertension
 vyakti ke hriday sambandhi jokhim or raktchaap paath kaa dhyaan rakhte huye dawaaen likhi jaati he
 If treatment is started with medication, the Joint National Committee on Seventh Hypertension of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends that physicians monitor treatment response and assess adverse effects from medications
 5 mmhg raktchaap kii kami daure ke khatre ko 34% se kam kar detii he tathaa ischemic hriday rog ke jokhim ko 21% tak kam kar detaa he
 Reduction in blood pressure can reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and death from heart disease
 adhiktar logon ke liye upachaar kaa uddeshy raktchaap ko 140 / 90 mmhg se kam karne kaa hona chaiye tathaa madhumeh yaa gurde kii beemaari se peedit logon ke liye or kam hona chaiye
 Some medical professionals recommend keeping levels below 120 / 80 mmhg
 yadi raktchaap lakshya nahin hasil ho pate hai to or adhik upachaar kii jarurat hoti he
 Guidelines on drug selection and best determination of treatment for different subgroups have changed over time and depending on countries
 sarvshereshth dawa par visheshgyon main sahmati nahin he
 Guidelines from the Cockron Cooperation, World Health Organization, and the United States for early treatment consider a low-dose thiazide-based diuretic to be superior
 britain ke dishanirdesh 55 yaa adhik umr ke logon ke liye yaa tathaa africa yaa carabian mul ke liye calcium channel bloker par jor dete hai
 These guidelines recommend angiotensin-variable enzyme inhibition to be used as the preferred initial treatment for youth
 japan main, shuruyaat main nimna dawaaon ke chah virgon main se kisi ek ke saath: CCB, ACEI / ARB, thiyajid diauratics, beta blowers or alpha blowers ko uchit samajha jaataa he
 In Canada, all these drugs except alpha blockers have been recommended as the first possible option
 bahut se logon ko unke ucch raktchaap ko niyantrit karne ke liye ek se adhik dawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The JNC7 and ESH-ESC guidelines advocate starting treatment with two drugs when the systolic blood pressure is greater than 20 mmhg or 10 mmhg above the diastolic target
 pasandida sangyojan renin - angiotencin pranali avarohak tathaa calcium channel blowers, yaa renin - angiotencin pranali pratirohak or diauratics ke hai
 Acceptable combinations include the following: asweekaarya sangyojan nimnlikhit hai: Avoid combining ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, a diuretic and an NSAID, due to the possibility of a high risk of severe renal failure
 australian swasthya sahitya main is sangyojan ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main "tripal vaimi" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Tablets with fixed combinations of two classes of medicines are available
 jabaki ve suvidhajanak hai, ve un logon ke liye sabase acchhee tarah se arakshit hai jo log vyaktigat ghatakon par sthapit kiye jate hai
 Treatment of moderate to severe hypertension in people aged 60 and older reduces mortality and cardiovascular side effects
 80 saal se adhik umr ke logon main upachaar sampurna mrityu dar ko mahatvapurn rup se kam nahin prakat karata he, lekin hriday rog kaa khatra kam kar detaa he
 Thiazide diuret is the preferred drug in the United States and the recommended blood pressure target is less than 140 / 90 mm Hg
 sanshodhit british disha nirdeshon main, calcium channel bloker pasandida upachaar he jisamen lakshya clinics reeding 150 / 90 mmhg se kam athwa chal yaa ghar raktchaap kii nigaraanee main 145 / 85 mmhg se kam he
 Resistant hypertension is hypertension that persists above the target blood pressure despite the use of three antihypertensive agents belonging to different antihypertensive drug classes simultaneously
 pratirodhi ucch raktchaap ke ilaaj ke liye dishanirdesh britain or america main prakashit kiya gaya he
 In 2000, about one billion people, or about 26% of the world's adult population, had hypertension
 yah viksit or aviksit donon prakaar ke deshon main aam tha
 However, its rates vary with regions such as the minimum with 3
4% and 6
8% rates in rural India and the maximum with rates of 68
9% and 72
5% in Poland
 san 1995 main yah anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki sanyukt rajya america main 43 lakh logon ko ucch raktchaap tha yaa ve ucchraktchaparodhi dawa le rahe the

 There are three famous poets in Hindi named 'thakur' - Asniwale Puranik Thakur, Asniwale 2nd Thakur and 3rd Thakur Bundelkhandi

 The first two of these were Brahmabhatta, a resident of Thakur Asni

 vaise teenon thakuron kii rachanaayen paraspar itani ghul mil gai hai ki sahaj rup se unamem antar kar paanaa kaaphi kathin he
 Asniwale was the son of the second Thakur Rishinath Kavi and according to his grandson Kavi Sevak's nephew Sri Krishna, his ancestor poet Devakinandan Mishra was a Saryupari Brahmin Piyasi Mishra of Gorakhpur, who had to be castigated as a poet in his marriage to the king of Majhauli

 As a poet, he came in this lineage
 thakur kaa janm, ramanaresh treepathi ke anusaar, san0 1792 main hua tha
 Babu Devkinandan Thakur, a well-known nobleman of Kashi and a relative of Kashiraj, was the patron of the poet whose beloved poet made 'bihari Satsai' as 'devakinandan Tika', 'satasai Baranarth'
 unki kavita main bhav or bhashaagat laalitya, chamatkaar or sarasata dekhne yogya hoti he
 Sukumar Bhavabyanjana, enchanting rhetoric and uninterrupted visualism are the main qualities of the second Thakur's poem

 The King of Bijawar honored him by giving him a village

 Thakur was also to be visited equally by Himmat Bahadur Gosain of Banda, who was among Padmakar's chief refugees

 Thakur by nature was a free-spirited, capricious, fearless, forthright, self-respecting, aesthetic, passionate, 'fiery opponent and sympathetic to allies', generous and visionary of wisdom, skillful, approachable, and well-recognized of the pace of the nation
 
 darbari hote hue bhi unhone kisi ashrayadata kii atiranjit prashansa kabhi nahin kii
 Beginning with the words 'servant soldier', the poet presents a good tableau of the poet's inner nature which Thakur read with a sword drawn in a gathering to answer the courage of Himmat Bahadur
 kavy main saras, sachche or umang bhare anubhoot bhavchitran ke kaayal hone ke kaaran thakur reetibaddh kaviyon kii paramparayukta kavy-srijan kii ratant paripati se utane hi chidhate the jitne gorakhpanthiyon or kabirpanthiyon se tulsidas
 The poem ending with 'logan Kavitta Kivo Khelo Kari Jaano Hai' is a direct evidence of the said statement and a poignant sarcasm of the poet's anger, reprimand and recessive decadent poetry of that period
 bahut dinon tak anek pracheen kavyasangrahon main thakur kii rachanaayen sfoot rup main hi dikhti raheen parantu kaaphi baad main 'thakur shatak' or 'thakur thasak' naam ke do sangrah taiyaar kiye gaye
 The 'thakur Centenary', comprising poems of the three Thakurs, was the poet of Nakhedi Tiwari, resident of Dumraon, and whose publication was published in 1904 AD under the direction of Babu Ramakrishna Varma 'veer' from Kashi's 'bharat Jeevan Press'

 Lala ji took 104 verses in 'thakur Thasak' and 'thakur centenary', the remaining 88 verses were found new
 thakur sahaj or swaabhaavik anubhuti ke kavi the
 This simple and immaculate sentiment is found everywhere in his poems
 kala kaa aagrah puri tarah se sweekaar karte hue bhi bhavakshetra main ve swatantraaa ke pakshpaati the
 The poet also had unique language with a sense of life and unique expressions
 yadhyapi thakur ke kavy kaa varnya vishay bhi ritimargi kaviyon kii bhanti shringaar, bhakthi or niti hi he tathaapi prayog kaa prakaar usase paryaapt bhinn he
 Even after adopting the 'cult of love', the poet did not get involved in heroism
 saamaanya vyavhaar kii chalati hui brajabhasha kaa prayog hi usne kiya he
 Artificial language style, Sukumar is sufficiently capable of emotional expression
 lokokti, muhaavarey or lokprachlit tadbhav shabdon kaa jaisaa yuktiyukt or sateek upyog is kavi ne kiya he vaisaa anya kisi ne nahin
 This has made the expression natural, charming, lively and euphemistic
 savaiya chand main kavi kii sahaj gati thi jiskaa spasht prabhaav bhaaratendu par padaa tha
 Due to these characteristics, many critics have praised the poetry of the poet and wrote - 'premishikas such truthful and stereotypical verses are often not found in the composition of any poet
 is mahakavi ne maanushiya prakruti or hridyangam bhaavon evam chitasagar kii tarangon ko badi hi safaltaapurvak chitrit kiya he' 
 'language, sentiment, flow, Madhuri with any thought, take any poet or Savaiya of Thakur, the heart will dance as you read
