 Since needle biopsy is often a reliable diagnostic test, some doctors may not decide to remove the wound and instead use clinical examination and mammography to periodically inspect the wound periodically to determine the growth rate of the wound
 You can opt for clinical follow-up

 unhone ghar par hi rah kar sanskrit, urdu, farsi or angreji aadi kaa adhyayan kiya or 1884 main nizamabad ke middle skool main adhyaaapak ho gaye
 While working in the same position, he passed the normal examination in the first class
 inkaa vivaah anand kumari ke saath sampann hua
 In 1889, Hariudhji got a government job

 He then returned to Nizamabad
 is adhyaapan kaary se mukt hone ke baad hariudh ji apane gaanv main rah kar hi sahitya-seva kaary karte rahe
 Hariyodh ji earned a lot of fame due to his literary service
 hindi sahitya sammelan ne unhen ek baar sammelan kaa sabhapati banaaya or vidyavachaspati kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 He died in 1945 in Nizamabad
 hariudh ji ne theth hindi kaa thaath, adhkhila phool, hindi bhashaa or sahitya kaa vikaas aadi granth-granthon kii bhi rachana kii, kintu multah ve kavi hi the unke ullekhneey granthon main shaamil hai: - Dear Migration, is the most famous and important text of Hariyodh ji
 yah hindi khadi boli kaa pratham mahakavy he
 It has received the Mangalaprasad Award
 varnya vishay- hariudh ji ne vividh vishyon par kavy rachana kii he
 It is his specialty that he has taken up modern problems along with topics related to krishna-radha, rama-sita and presented his views on them in a new way
 pracheen or aadhunik bhaavon ke mishran se unke kavy main ek adbhut chamatkaar utpann ho gaya he
 Disconnection and Vatsalya-narration- There is a poignant description of Krishna's Mathura movement in the beloved sojourn and then the condition of Braj
 krishna ke viyog main sara braj dukhi he
 Radha's position is inexplicable
 nand yashoda aadi bade vyakul hai
 Hariudh has drawn a compassionate picture of Yashoda distressed in the son-separation, it liquefies the reader's heart- lok-seva kii bhaavana- hariudh ji ne krishna ko ishwar rup main na dikhaa kar adarsh maanav or lok-sevak ke rup main chitrit kiya he
 He himself is called by the mouth of Krishna- krishna ke anuroop hi radha kaa charitra he ve donon kii bhagini anashriton kii maan or vishwa kii premika hai
 Even after suffering the disconnection of his beloved Krishna, she wishes for the public's good-dear creatures to be awake, no matter where they are
 prakruti-chithran- hariudh ji kaa prakruti chithran saraahneey he
 In his poetry, he has depicted nature wherever he has the opportunity
 or use vividh roopon main apanaaya he
 The nature-portrayal of Hariodh ji is alive and favorable to the circumstances
 sambandhit praaniyon ke sukh main prakruti sukhi or dukh main dukhi dikhaai detii he
 Braj trees also cry in the disconnection of Krishna- jahaan hariudh ji ne vrikshon aadi ko ginane kaa praytn kiya he, vahaan unka prakruti-varnan kuch neeras kshor paramparaagat-sa lagata he, kintu aisa bahut kam hua he
 Most of his nature depiction is simple and natural and heartwarming
 :sandhya kaa ek sundar drishy dekhie- Hariudh ji has written poetry both in Brajbhasha and Khadi Boli, but most of his compositions are in Khadi Boli
 hariudh kii bhashaa praudh, pranjal or aakarshak he
 At some places, urdu-persian words have also come in it
 naveen or aprachlit shabdon kaa prayog bhi hua he
 There is so much of Sanskrit words that in some places their poetry seems to be Sanskrit and not Hindi
 radha kaa rup-varnan karte samay dekhie- Hariyod ji had wonderful authority over the language
 ek ore jahaan unhone sanskrit-garbhit ucch saahitiyik bhashaa main kavita likhi vahaan duusari ore unhone saral tathaa muhaavareydaar vyaavhaarik bhashaa ko bhi safaltaapurvak apanaaya
 The language of his chaupadas is similar to this
 ek udhaaharan lijie- In the poetry of Hariyodh ji, almost all the rasas are found, the complete euphemism of Runa Vioga, Shringar and Vatsalya Rasa
 hariudh ji kii chand-yojana main paryaapt vividhta milti he
 Initially, he used the ancient verses of Hindi Kavita Sabaiya, Chappay, Doha etc
 and Urdu verses
 baad main unhone indravajra, shikharini, malini vasant tilka, shardool, vikreedit mandakrantha aadi sanskrit ke chhandon ko bhi apanaaya
 Ornate - Hariyodh ji is adored due to the ritualistic effect, but his poetry is not burdensome with Kamini ornaments
 unki kavita main jo bhi alankaar hai, ve sahaj rup main aa gaye hai or ras kii abhivyakti main sahaayak siddh hue hai
 Hariudh ji has successfully used both the word and the meaning of the word
 anupras, yamak, upama utpreksha, roopak unke priy alankaar hai
 Hariudh ji served Hindi in both prose and poetry
 ve dvivedi yug ke pramukh kavi he
 He first proved that by composing poetry in Khadi dialect, it can prove that even in the poetry of Khadi dialect like Brajbhasha, there can be succulence and sweetness
 hariudh ji main ek shreshth kavi ke samast gun vidyaman the
 The epic 'his beloved sojourn' is considered a 'mile-stone' in Hindi epics due to its poetic features

 ganit main sankhyaon kaa nimnlikhit anukram hemchandra shrenee yaa fibonachi shrenee kehalaata hai: By definition, the first two Hemachandra numbers are 0 and 1
 iske baad aane vaali prayek sankhya pichley do sankhyaon kaa yoga he
 Some people omit the initial 0, replacing the sequence with two 1's
 ganitiya sandarbh main, fibonachi sankhya ke f n anukram ko aavartan sambandh dwaara darshaya ja saktaa he- And, fibonachi anukram kaa naam pisa ke leonardo fibonachi ke naam par rakhaa gaya, jo fibonachi ke naam se jane jate the
 The 1202 book Liber Abeki, written by Fibonacci, introduced this sequence in West European mathematics, although this sequence has already been described in Indian mathematics
 fibonachi anukram pracheen bharat main bahut prasiddh tha, jahaan ise europe main prachlit hone se bahut samay pehle hi chand vigyaan main lagu kiya gaya tha
 The credit for its development is given to Pingala, Virhanka, Gopal, and Hemachandra
 fibonachi anukram, n -1 lambaai ke namoonay main s ko jod kar, yaa n -2 lambaai ke namoonay main l ko jod kar taiyaar kiya jaataa he; or chand-shastriyon ne darshaya ki n lambaai ke namoonay, anukram main pichhali do sankhyaon kaa yoga hai
 Donald Knuth reviewed this work in The Art of Computer Programming
 pashchim main, pisa ke leonardo ne apane liber abek main fibonachi ke rup main gyaat is anukram kaa adhyayan kiya
 He considered the development of an ideal rabbit population, assuming that: iskaa niyam yah he ki khargoshon kii ek jodi apane jivan-kaal main 2 jodi paidaa karti he or mar jaati he
 Suppose the population is f in n months
 is samay, keval ve khargosh, jo n - 2 maheene main jivit rahe the, prajnanksham hai or santan paidaa karte hai, to f jode maujuuda aabaadi f main jud jate hai
 Thus, the total is f = f + F
 n = 0, 1, 2, 


, 20 ke liye Fn ke rup main bhi suchit kii jane vaali pehali 21 fibonachi sankhyaayein hai: Using the rotation relation, the sequence can also be extended to negative index n
 The result satisfies the equation is prakaar puraa anukram he Each third number of the sequence is even and typically, each kth number of the sequence is a multiple of Fk
 Thus the Fibonacci sequence is an example of a divisibility sequence
 Indeed, the Fibonacci sequence satisfies the apparent divisibility property
 raikhik aavartan dwaara paribhaashit prayek anukram kii tarah, fibonachi sankhya kaa ek purna-sutara hal he
 yah binet sutara ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki use pehle abrahim di moivre ke rup main janaa gaya tha: 
 fibonachi prayaavartan The determinant of the golden ratio is similar to the following equation jise prayaavartan ke utpaadak bahupad ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The solution of the above equation is x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin {matrix} x ^ {2} = x + 1, \ end {matrix}} \ ,} and xn - 1 { \ 
 Multiplying by displaystyle x ^ {n-1} \ ,} shows the following: paribhaasha ke anusaar φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, sameekaran kaa mul he or doosraa mul he 1 − φ = − 1 / φ 
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ ,=-1 / \ varphi \ ,
} 
 isliye: And donon φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} tathaa n = n { \ displaystyle ^{n}=^{n}} aisi jyamitiya shrinkhlaayein hai, jo fibonachi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan karti hai
 pehali shrinkhalaa ghaataanki rup se badhati he; duusari, ghaataanki rup se, ekantar chihnon sahit, shunya kii ore le jaati he
 chunki fibonachi prayaavartan raikhik he, in do shrinkhalaaon ke kisi bhi raikhik sangyojan se bhi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 ye raikhik sangyojan, ek do-aiami raikhik vector antar taiyaar karte hai; mul fibonachi anukram is antar main paaya ja saktaa he
 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known
 Despite that, the inverse Fibonacci constant richard andre-jianin dwaara aparimey sabit kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci prime number is a Fibonacci number that is prime
 The first few are: hazaron ankon ke saath fibonachi abhajya sankhya pai gai hai, lekin yah gyaat nahin he ki kya kai aparimit sankhyaayein maujuud hai
 un sabamein ek abhajya ghaataank hona chahie, sivaay f 4 = 3
 f kn can be divided by f n and therefore joint Fibonacci numbers are also arbitrarily in vogue due to the arbitrary number of joint numbers in circulation
 1, 8 or 144 ke apwaad sahit prayek fibonachi sankhya kaa ek abhajya gunak he, jo ki kisi chote fibonachi sankhya kaa gunak nahin he
 Only 144 are non-negligible squares Fibonacci numbers
 Ettila Petho proved in 2001 that only a limited number of perfect power Fibonacci numbers exist
 In 2006, Y
 Beugaud, M
 Mignot and S
 Siksek proved that only 8 and 144 are non-negligible perfect powers
 f 6 = 8 se mahattar koi fibonachi sankhya, abhajya sankhya se na to ek adhik yaa ek kam he
 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}
} for example, yah gyaat nahin he ki koi abhajya p aise maujuud he ki f p − ≡ 0 { \ displaystyle F_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p^{2 xxrep 4 } is tarah kii abhajya sankhyaon ko waal-san-san abhajya sankhya kaha jayega
 Also, if p ≠ 5 is an odd prime number, then: sabhi maamalon ke udhaaharan: For odd n, all odd prime divisors of f n are ≡ 1, indicating that all odd divisors of f n are ≡ 1
 udhaaharan ke liye, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2 × 17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2 × 5 × 61 ∑ k = n n + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=n}^{n+9}f_{k}=11f_{n+6}} For example, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11×13n = 2:F2+F3+


+F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11×21n = 3:F3+F4+


+F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144= 374 = 11×34 In fact, the identities are not only positive, but are true for all n integers: n = 0: F0 + F1 + 


 + F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11 × 8n = −1: F−1+F0+


+F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11×5n = −2: f − 2 + f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11 × 3 yah aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he ki agar fibonachi anukram kii ikaayiyon ne mod n liya he, to adhik se adhik n 2 aavartan sahit parinami anukram aavartak honi chahie

 Beginning with 5, every other Fibonacci number is the length of the hypotenuse of an even triangle with integer sides, or, in other words, the largest number in the Pathagorean triangle
 The length of the long foot of this triangle is equal to the sum of the three sides of the previous triangle in this series of triangles, and the short foot is equal to the difference between the Fibonacci number taken in the preceding calculation and the short foot of the preceding triangle

 Example 1: Suppose the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 2, 3 and 5
 Then: udhaaharan 2: maan len fibonachi sankhyaayein 8, 13, 21 or 34 hai
 tab: Since f n { \ displaystyle F_ {n}} for उप n / 5 { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n} / { \ sqrt {5}}}, f n { \ displaystyle F_ {n} \ ,} The number of digits in n log 10 ⁡ φ ≈ 0

 Consequently, each d> 1 { \ displaystyle d> 1 } For integers, d contains 4 or 5 Fibonacci numbers with decimal digits

 Since the conversion factor from miles to kilometers is close to the 1
609344 golden ratio, the decomposition of miles into the sum of Fibonacci numbers becomes approximately the sum of kilometers when the Fibonacci numbers are replaced by their successors
 In the transfer of base मू, the radix is equal to the number 2 indicator

 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center
 It is often said that in sunflowers and similar systems 55 rotations are only in one direction and 89 in the other direction, but this is only true for a sphere of diameter, especially the outermost and thus spontaneously visible

 Saraswati Kantabharan is an honorable treatise of Sanskrit-literature-literature discussing poetry, written by Maharaja Bhojraj of Dhareshwar
 maharaj bhojraj kaa samay isvi san 1010-1055 tak itihaaskaaron dwaara sweekrut kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the creation period of Saraswati Kantha Bharan can be considered to be mid-eleventh century AD
 iske praneta kavyprakash ke rachayita mammat se kinchit purvavarti hai
 Although the sound of doctrine was established by Anandavardhana, the recognition of sound as Kavyatma was disputed till that time; Therefore, neither Bhojdev nor Bhatt Mammat adopted the determination to give voice as a soul in the definition of poetry in a literal sense
 donon aacharyon ne kavy main doshabhaav tathaa gunvattta ko pradhanta di he
 It is the specialty of Bhojdev that he has accepted the utility of ornaments and has considered it necessary for poetry to be restored
 yon bhojdev ke saraswatikanthabharan ne anshat: mammat ko evam vishwanath ko prabhavit kiya he
 Saraswati Kantha Bharan is a long text containing five passages
 pratham pariched main rachayita ne kavyasaamanya kii paribhaasha dene ke pashchaat sarvapratham kavy ke deergh evam gun kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this context, Bhojdev has given verse, sentence and syntactic defects
 har prakaar ke dosha kii sankhya solah he
 According to Bhojdev, qualities, words and sentences are known and each has twenty-four distinctions
 pratham pariched ke ant main katipay dosha kahin kahin gun ban jate hai
 By illustrating this poetry, he has accepted the routine of poetry
 dwitiya pariched main shabdalankar kaa nirnay karte hue unhone sarvapratham auchiti par bal diya tathaa jati, reeti, vritti, chaaya, mudra, ukti, yukti, bhaniti, gunfna, shayya evam pathiti kaa sodaaharan vivechan kiya he
 Except for the custom of these twelve elements, detailed explanation of the remaining elements is not found in any other available literature in Sanskrit
 banbhatta ne kavyasaushthav ke vishesh tatv, shayya kaa ullekh kiya he parantu uski paribhaasha keval saraswatikanthabharan main hi uplabdh hoti he
 Thereafter, an example is given of the vulgar distinctions of puns, puns, alliteration, pictures, pralica, esoteric and q & As
 is ansh main bhi saraswatikanthabharan kii sarvatha nijee visheshta he
 Subsequently, Bhojdev, discussing the causes of poetry, presents three distinctions of poetry in the form of audio, visual and pictorial
 drishykavy ke antargat unhone dasharupakon kaa ullekh nahin kiya he varan nritt evam nrity par hi unka vibhaajan simit he
 In the third passage, there is a discussion of the difference between the form and the type of economists, which take different forms than other literatures
 chauthe pariched main ubhayalankaron kaa vivechan he jisamen upama aadi alankaaron ke bhedopabhedon ko savistaar samajhaayaa he
 The last passage is rasvivechan
 isamen naikadi kaa tathaa vibhaavon, bhaavon evam anubhaavon kaa vistaarpurvak swaroop nirnay kiya gaya he; saath hi saath kavypaak, vividh ratiraag ke swaroop kaa bhi nirdesh he
 At the end there is a epilogue with a discussion of vrittis like Bharati, Kaishiki etc
 saraswatikanthabharan main rassidhant kii vivechna praaia: vishay par ek vihangam drushtimaatr he
 Poetic poetry is a serious matter, with a view to doing justice to it with dignity, Bhoja completes the chapter of Rasavivechan by composing an independent book called Shringarprakash
 saraswatikanthabharan kii visheshta yah he ki yah itar sahityashastreey granthon kii apeksha vyapak evam vyutpaadak granth he
 Its creator Bhojdev is not going to be afraid of Granthavistar, he always makes a generous effort to explain many subtle differences and strains by giving examples
 yadhyapi unke dwaara upasthaapit bhedopabhedon kii manyata parvarti granthkaaron ne sweekrut nahin kii he tathaapi unke tathvik vivechan se sahasaa asahmat hone kii dridhtaa bhi kutraapi drushtigochar nahin hoti

 Data models are progressive; No data model is ever final for any business or application
 Instead a data model should be considered a living document, which will change as a reaction to the changing business
 Ideally, the data model should be kept in a repository so that it can be retrieved, expanded, and edited over time
 Whiten defined two types of data modeling: data modelling kisi database ke liye vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon ke varnan ke liye bhi ek takanic he
 Sometimes this is called database modeling because a data model is eventually implemented in a database

 ek mukhya kaaran yah he ki pranaaliyon or interpheson main lagu kiye gayi data modelon kii gunvattta kam hoti he
 The reason for these problems is the lack of a standard, which will ensure that the data models will also meet business needs and be compatible

 is taarkik data model main dizine ko ek data paribhaasha bhashaa main nirmit karne ke liye aavashyak sabhi taarkik or bhautik dizine chayan or bhautik bhandaran maapdand hote hai, jinka prayog tab ek database ke nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 a data model with all the attributes has detailed attributes for each unit
 database dizine shabdaawalee kaa prayog ek sakal database pranali ke dizine ke vibhinn bhaagon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Primarily and most accurately, it can be understood as a logical construct of the basic data structures used for storing data
 ek sambandhparak model main ye talikaayen or vyuu hote hai
 Units and relationships in an object database are directly associated with object classes and named relationships
 haalanki, database dizine shabdaawalee kaa prayog dizining kii sakal prakriya, na keval mul data sanrachanaon, balki ek database prabandhan tantra yaa DBMS main ek sakal database anuprayog ke bhaag ke rup main prayukt forms or qveries bhi, ko lagu karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This process costs 25% to 70% of the current system development and support costs on the system interface
 is laagat kaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki ye system ek saamaanya data model kaa prayog nahin karte
 yadi data modelon ko ek pranali-dar-pranali aadhaar par viksit kiya jaae, to aachhadit kshetron main na keval samaan vishleshan doharaaya jaataa he, balki unke bich interphes kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aage or vishleshan karnaa bhi anivaary hota he
 Most systems have the same basic components, which are redeveloped for a specific purpose
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit main samaan buniyadi vargeekaran model kaa prayog ek ghatak ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he: The same components are redeveloped because we have no way of telling that they are identical
 data model ruchi ke soochna kshetron kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Although there are many methods for building data models, according to Lane Silverstone, only two of these methods are the best, top-down and bottom-up: kabhi-kabhi model in donon vidhiyon ke mishran ke rup main nirmit kiye jate hai: kisi anuprayog kii sanrachana or data aavashyaktaaon or sanrachana par vichaar karke or ek vishay-kshetra model kaa satat sandarbh dete hue
 durbhaagya se, anek vaataavaranon main, ek taarkik data model or ek bhautik data model ke bich antar aspasht hota he
 Additionally, some CASE tools do not differentiate between logical and physical data models
 data modelling kii anek sanket-paddatiyaan hoti hai
 The real model is often called the "entity relationship model" because it portrays the data in terms of the entities described in it and their relationships
 ek ikai-sambandh model sanrachanabaddh data kaa ek sankshipt vaicharik pradarshan hota he
 Entity-relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, which is used in software engineering to construct a type of conceptual data model of a system, usually a relational database, in a top-down form
 Huh
 in modelon kaa prayog soochna-tantron ke nirmaan ke pehle charan main aavashyaktaa vishleshan ke dauraan soochna aavashyaktaaon yaa us soochna ke prakaar ko bataane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jise kisi database main rakhaa janaa he
 The data modeling technique can be used to describe any element for a specific dialog-world, ie area of interest
 data modelon ke nirmaan ke liye anek takneekein viksit kii gayi hai
 While these practices guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with two different results
 Most notable are: saamaanya data model paaramparik data modelon ke samanyikaran hote hai
 They define standardized general relationship types as well as those types of objects that may be associated with such relation-types
 ek saamaanya data model kii paribhaasha ek prakritik bhashaa kii paribhaasha ke samaan hi hoti he
 For example, in a general data model the types of relations, regardless of the types of objects concerned, are a 'classification relation', which is a binary relation between a single object and a type of objects, and a 'part-full relationship'
 ', Which can be defined as a binary relationship between two objects, one of which is in the role of the numerator and the other in the role of the whole
 
 shreniyon kii ek vitanya suchi kisi ekal vastu kaa vargeekaran karne or kisi ekal vastu ke liye ansh-purna sambandh vinirdeshit karne kii anumati detii he
 By standardizing a canonical list of relationship types, a general data model provides the ability to express an unlimited number of types of facts and will use the capabilities of natural languages
 On the other hand, the domain scope of traditional data models is fixed and limited because the establishment of such models only allows the interpretation of the types of facts that are pre-defined in the model
 kisi DBMS kii taarkik data sanrachana, chaahe vah padanukramik ho, network ho, yaa sambandhaatmak ho, data kii ek vaicharik paribhaasha kii awashyaktaaon kii puri tarah purti nahin kar sakati kyonki iskaa dayera simit hota he or yah us DBMS dwaara prayog kii gai kriyanvayan ranneeti kii ore jhuki hui hoti he
 Hence the need to define data from a conceptual point of view has resulted in the development of semantics data modeling techniques
 arthath, data ke arth ko anya data ke saath aapasi sambandhon ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karne kii takneekein
 jaisaa ki chitra main pradarshit he, sansadhano, vichaaron, ghatnaon ityadi ke sandarbh main vaastavik-vishwa ko sanket-rup main bhautik data bhandaron main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 An econometric data model is an abbreviation that defines how these symbols are related to the real-world
 is prakaar anivaary rup se yah model vaastavik-vishwa kaa ek satya pradarshan hona chaiye
 An econometric data model can be used for many purposes, such as: kritrim budhimatta ke kshetra se gyaat shaktishaalee sankshepan avadharanaon ke saath sambandhaatmak avadharanaon ke ekikaran ke dwaara adhik data kaa arth grahan karnaa arth-vigyaan data model kaa sakal lakshya he
 The idea here is to provide archaic elements of high-level modeling as an integral part of the data model to aid in the performance of real-world conditions

 It is similar to other indo-chinese styles of kickboxing, namely these styles are Pradal Serre from Cambodia, Tomoi from Malaysia, Lethawei from Myanmar and Mu Laos from Laos
 may boron se viksit hua, may thai thailand kaa rashtriya khel he
 The word maye is derived from the Sanskrit word mavya and the word thai is derived from the word tai
 may thai ko "aath angon kii kala" yaa "aath angon ke vigyaan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he kyonki isamen panch, kik, kohni or ghutane se prahaar kiya jate hai, is prakaar se isamen "sampark ke aath binduon" kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, iske vipareet pashchimi boxing main "do binduon" kaa or khel unmukh marshall arts main "chaar binduon" kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a professional practicing in Muay Thai is known as Nasal Muay
 pashchimi peshewaron ko naak may farang arthath videshi boxr kaha jaataa he
 This type of boxing is more than 1000 years old
 haalanki, 400 saal pehle thailand kii purv rajdhani, ayuthaya main iske paae jane ke pramaan milte hai
 Many forms of kickboxing have long been observed throughout Northeast Asia
 chini or bhartiya marshall arts ke sangyojan ke aadhaar par, peshewar daawa karte hai ki yah kala do hajaar saal puraani he
 Muay Thai evolved in Thailand from Muay Boran, a type of unarmed boxing that was probably used by Symese soldiers when they lost their weapons in battle and remained unarmed
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki pracheen syamiz sena ne krabi crabong kii hathiyaar-aadhaarit kala se may boron kaa nirmaan kiya, lekin kuch anya logon kaa maananaa he ki in donon shaileyon kaa vikaas sambhavatya ek saath hi hua he
 Yet Krabi Krabong has greatly influenced Mu Boran and Muay Thai, an influence that can be seen in the many kicks, holds, and motions at Wai Khru that developed into armed conflict
 may boron ko or isiilie may thai ko mul rup se toi may yaa sirf may kaha jaataa tha
 As well as being a practical combat technique used in actual warfare, Muay became a game in which opponents fought in front of spectators who would watch this battle for entertainment
 may ke ye pratiyogi dhire dhire sthaneey utsavon or tyohaaron kaa ek abhinn hissaa ban gaye, vishesh rup se un utsavon kaa hissaa ban gayi jinka aayojan mandiron main kiya jaataa tha
 It was even used to entertain kings
 pehle is khel ke dauraan hatheliyon par kuch bhi nahin pahana jaataa tha, ant main yoddha apane haathon or bhujaaon ke agle hisse par san kii rassi ko lapet kar pahanane lage
 This type of match was called Maya Khat Chueck
 may dhire dhire vyaktigat unnati kaa ek sambhav saadhan ban gaya, kyonki is kala ke peshewaron ke sammaan main vruddhi hui, chaynit peshewaron ko shahi mehalon main rahane ke liye aamantrit kiya jane laga, ve shahi parivaar ke sadasyon, sainikon, rajkumaron yaa raja ke vyaktigat sangrakshakon ko yah kala sikhaane lage
 This "royal may" was called May Luang
 kabhi kabhi ayuthaya avadhi ke dauraan, in shahi sangrakshakon kii ek palaton ko niyukt kiya jaataa tha, ye sangrakshak raja or desh kii raksha ke liye niyukt kiye jate the
 These were known as chrome nose muay
 kik may kaa yah shahi sangrakshan ram v or VII ke shashan kaal main bhi jari rahaa
 In 1868, when King Chulalongkorn ascended the throne, this era became a golden era not only for Muay but for the entire Thailand country
 ram v ke shashan kaal ke dauraan may kii bahut adhik pragati hui, kyonki raja khud pratyaksh rup se is kala main vyaktigat ruchi letaa tha
 The country was in a state of peace and Muay served as a means of physical exercise, self-defense, recreation and personal advancement
 is kala main maahir logon ne prashikshan shiviron main is kala ko sikhaanaa shuru kar diya, yahaan vidhyaarthiyon ko bhojan or aashray bhi uplabdh karaayaa jaataa tha
 The instructors were considered to be a family and it became a custom by the students to adopt the camp name as their surname

 lampini kickboxing stadium ke pratiyogiyon ne prashikshan or videshiyon ke khilaaf boxing match ke dauraan aadhunik dastaane pahananaa shuru kiya
 The war between the Thais was still customary to tie the rope, but after a death in the ring, it was determined that contestants would wear cotton covers around the legs and ankles and gloves in their hands
 yahi vah samay tha jab shabd may thai kaa upyog bahut prachlit ho gaya tha, jabaki is style ke puraane rup ko may boron ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 With Muay Thai's success in mixed martial arts, it became the de facto style of choice for competitive stand-up competitors
 iske parinamswaroop, pashchimi peshewaron ne boxing se adhik shaktishaalee haath kii strike takneekon ko shaamil kiya, haalanki kuch thai peshewaron kaa aarope he ki ye takneekein is kala ko kamjor banaati hai
 The most popular folklore related to Maya Boron is the story of Nai Khanomtom
 1767 main ayuthaya kii pracheen siam rajdhani ke patan ke samay, akramanakari burmese sainya dalon ne hazaron thai logon ko bandhak bana liya or unhen kaidi bana kar burma le gaye
 These included a large number of Thai kickboxers, who were taken to the city of Ava
 1774 main, burma ke rangoon shahar main, burma ke raja haseenbushin ne buddha ke avasheshon ke sammaan main saat din or saat raat ke ek dharmik utsav ke aayojan kaa faisla liya
 The festival featured a variety of entertainment aids, such as plays in special costume called likées, comedic performances and matches of slapstick and sword fighting
 ek bindu par, raja haseenbushin yah dekhnaa chahta tha ki may boron kii tulana kaise burmese kala lethevei ke saath kii ja sakati he
 Nai Khanomtom was chosen to fight against the Burmese champions
 boxing ring ko singhaasana ke saamne banaaya gaya or naai khanomathome ne apane shikshakon or purvajon ke prati sammaan prakat karne ke liye ladaai se pehle ek paaramparik vaai kru nrity kiya, saath hi apane pratidwandvi ke aas paas nrity karke darshakon ke prati bhi sammaan kaa pradarshan kiya
 This surprised the Burmese people, they were confused, they thought it was black magic
 jab ladaai shuru hui, nai khanomathome ne panch, kik, kohni or ghutane kaa prayog karte hue apane pratidwandvi par tab tak prahaar kiya, jab tak vah post nahin ho gaya
 However the Burmese referee stated that the Burmese champion was too distracted by the kick and the knockout was declared invalid
 tab raja ne kaha ki nai khanomathome ko apane aap ko sabit karne ke liye burma ke nau champiyanon se ladanaa hoga
 He agreed and fought each other one by one without resting in between
 uskaa antim pratidwandvi raakhine se kickboxing kaa ek mahaan shikshak tha
 Nai Khanomtom injured him with his kicks, after which no one else dared to challenge him
 raja mangara itnaa prabhavit hua ki usne kathith taur par tippanee kii, "thai kaa har hissaa vish se paripurna he
 Despite being unarmed, he can beat nine to ten rivals
 lekin unka swami aksham tha or usne dushman ke liye apane desh ko kho diya
 Had he been able, it could not have happened that Ayutthaya city would have collapsed
 raja mangara ne nai khanomathome ko swatantra kar diya, saath hi use apane liye dhan yaa do sundar patniyon main se ek vikalp chunane ke liye bhi kaha
nai khanomathome ne patniyon ko chunaa kyonki usne bataaya ki dhan to aasaani se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 After this he went to Siam with his wives
 is kahani ke anya sanskarnon ke anusaar uski jeet ke parinamswaroop uske saathi thai kaidiyon ko bhi reeha kar diya gaya tha
 In honor of him and Mu Boran, the celebration of his victory is celebrated every year on March 17 as Boxer Day or National Muay Boran Day
 vartmaan main kuch log nai khanomathome kii is prasidd katha ko raja naresoun se sambandhit karte hai, jise ek baar burmese le gaye the
 However, Nai Khanomtom and King Naresoun took place in two different centuries
 aupchaarik may thai takneekon ko do samoohon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he: mei maai yaa mukhya takneekein or look maai yaa laghu takneekein
 Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, in which opponents exchange currencies with each other
 yah nishchit rup thailand main paaramparik khiladiyon main prachlit he, lekin samakaleen vishwa main kam lokapriy kala he jahaan mudra ke liye mudra ke aadan pradaan kii thai style adhik anukool nahin he
 Almost all of Muay Thai's techniques use full body movements, rotating the hips with every kick, punch, elbow and block
 may thai main panch takanic mul rup se kaaphi simit he, jisamen sidhi bhujaa se lanbaa gol prahaar kiya jaataa he or hatheli kii hill se landing kii jaati he
 a full range of western boxing punches are now used by hybridizing with western boxing and western martial arts: lead job, straight / cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punch and overhands, as well as hammer fists and back fists
 adhikansh anya striking marshall arts kii tulana main, may thai main bodi panching kaa upyog ek ranneeti ke rup main kam kiya jaataa he, taaki prahaar karne vaale ke sir ko ghutanon or albo ke counter praharon se bachaaya ja sake
 In order to use the range of target points, in keeping with the central line principle, the competitor may use Western or Thai currency, which helps to effectively make long or short range strikes without compromising protection
 is
 kohni kaa upyog kai tareeke se prahaar karne vaale ek hathiyaar ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he: diagonal apwards, diagonal-downwards, aprakat, downward, baikward-spinning or flaaing
 From the side it can be used as a finishing move or to cut an opponent's eyebrow in such a way that blood can block his or her vision
 diagonal albo kisi anya prahaar se tej hoti hai lekin kam shaktishaalee hoti hai
 There is a clear distinction between a single elbow and a follow-up elbow
 single albo ek aisa prahaar he jo kisi anya prahaar se swatantra he, jabaki pholo-ap albo samaan bhujaa se kiya jane vaala doosraa prahaar he, jisamen pehla prahaar hook yaa street panch hota he, jiske baad albo pholo-ap kaa prahaar kiya jaataa he
 Such elbow strikes and other elbow strikes are used when the distance between the opponents is too short and there is too little space for the hook to strike the opponent's head
 kohni ke prahaar kaa upyog pratidwandvi ke prahaar ko block karne, usase apni raksha karne or uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye spring ni, said bodi ni, bodi kik yaa panch
 The two most common kicks in Muay Thai are called thip and te chiang or angle kick
 may thai kii angel kik main puure sharir kii ek ghurnan gati kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or ise anya marshall arts ke peshewaron ke dwaara bhi vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya he
 It is superficially similar to karate's round house kick, but does not have the rotation of the lower leg from the knee, which is used in most karate and other striking martial arts such as taekwondo
 kyonki kukushin, goju or kenpo main ise ek gol mudra main kiya jaataa he, jisamen peeche vaali taang, apper bodi fiting kii tulana main thodi si peeche hoti he
 This increases the risk in contrast to karate and taekwondo, with the exception of a few moments after a kick, for example
 angel kik main bal puri tarah se sharir; kulhon kii ghurnan gati ke dwaara lagaaya jaataa he
 It is thought that many opponents use counter rotation of the arm to intensify the ability of this kick, but the potential actually comes from the hips and the arms are placed in the stated position
 agar ek pratidwandvi ke dwaara round house kik maari gayi he, thai boxr aamtaur par kik kii jaanch karegaa or apni shin se is kik ko block karegaa
 thai boxr ko hameshaa shin se jude rahane kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 The foot has many small bones and is weak
 ek pratiyogi agar apane pair se yaa inastep prahaar karne kii koshish karata he to vah apane aap ko chot se bachaa saktaa he
 Muay Thai also includes many other types of kicks, such as side kicks and spinning back kicks
 This type of kick is used by some competitors only in bouts
 ek likhit strot ke anusaar, yah takanic khao dot yaa khao loi kii tulana main adhik aadhunik he
 It is believed that when Thai boxers fought with rope-tied hands instead of modern boxing gloves, this particular technique was used viciously in cutting, slicing and sawing by a conscious opponent
 jabaki saamne vaala pratidwandvi "rassi ke dastaane" ke tej kinaaron se is prahaar ko roktaa tha, kabhi kabhi rassi ko pani main bhigo kar geela kar liya jaataa tha taaki rassi or adhik majboot ho jaye
 yah vivaran neeche die gaye kuch ghutanon ke praharon ke liye bhi satya he
 Foot-thrust or literally foot-jab is one of Muay Thai's techniques
 iskaa upyog mukhya rup se hamalon ko block karne arthath rokane ke liye or duuri ko niyantrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The foot-thrust should be thrown very fast but at the same time it should be strong enough to disturb the opponent's balance
 pashchimi boxing main donon pratidwandviyon ko us samay alag kar diy jaataa he jab ve ek duusare ko jakad lete hai; may thai main, haalanki, aisa nahin kiya jaataa he
 Knee and elbow techniques are used in this tightness or clinch
 aakraamak or rakshaatmak donon prayojanon ke liye pratidwandvi par prahaar karne or use rokane ke liye, clinch main kam maatra main stand-ap grapeling kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The front clinch is used with the palm of one hand on the back of the other
 is baat ke teen kaaran hai ki anguliyon kaa istemaal kyon nahin kiya janaa chahie
1) ring main pratidwandvi dastaane pahane hote hai, isliye ve apni anguliyon kaa upyog nahin kar sakate
 2) thai front clinch main pratidwandvi ke sir ko neeche kii ore dabaaya jaataa he, yah tab aasaan hota he jab haath gardan ke peeche naa hokar sir ke peeche band hon
 iske alaava bhujaaon ke dwaara gardan par jahaan tak sambhav ho sake adhiktam dabaav daalaa janaa chahie
 3) agar koi pratidwandvi anguliyon kaa istemaal karata he to uski anguliyon par chot lag sakati he or saamne vaale pratidwandvi ke sir par teji se kohni kaa prahaar karne ke liye pakad bananaa adhik mushkil ho jaataa he
 In a correct clinch the contestant presses the opponent's collar bone with the front of his arm, this time with his hands not around the opponent's neck but around his head
 is clinch se baahar nikalne kaa ek saamaanya tarika he, pratidwandvi ke sir ko peeche kii ore dhakka dena yaa kohni kaa prahaar karnaa, kyonki clinch ke liye donon pratiyogiyon kaa ek duusare ke bahut paas hona jaruri hota he
 Additionally, an ineffective clincher may try to "float" its arms downward and into the opponent's clinch, making the ineffective clincher an effective clincher
 may thai main clinch yaa chep khao ke kai anya prakaar hai, inamen shaamil hai: In Muay Thai, defense or defense is classified into six groups: udhaaharan ke liye, rakshak aakraamak kii lo kik se bachane ke liye apni aage vaali taang ko peeche kii taraf le jaataa he or iske baad turant ek angel kik ke saath javaabi prahaar karata he
 Or the defender retracts his head with the high angle kick of the aggressor and strikes back with a side kick
 bachaav ke liye, "raksha kii diwaar" kii avadharana kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jisamen kandhon, bhujaaon or taangon kaa upyog karke aakraamak ko takanic kaa kriyanvayana karne se roka jaataa he
 Blocking or blocking is a complex element in Muay Thai and includes the level of rules a successful professional must have
 Low and mid bodied roundhouse kicks are usually prevented from the top of the raised shin
 unche bodi praharon ko agrabhuja, dastaane, kohni yaa shin se roka jaataa he
 Midsection roundhouse kicks can also be caught / stopped, helping to force or counter-attack the remaining portion of the opponent's leg
 panch ko ek saadhaaran boxing guard yaa aisi hi milti julati takanic se roka jaataa he, milti julati takanic kaa prayog naa kiya ja sake to boxing kii mul takanic kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 To prevent a punch, the hand is usually used from the side of the punch
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar ek rudhivaadee pratiyogi ek jaib daalata he, to rakshak apane daayen haath se panch ke kone kii disha main halkaa sa tepe daalega
 vikshepan hameshaa ek chota or sateek hona chahie ki isamen urja kaa anaavashyak vyay naa ho or jitani jaldi ho sake haath guard tak laut aaye
 hook ko aksar ek aisi gati se roka jaataa he, jiskaa varnan "baalo main kanghee karne" ke rup main kiya jaataa he, arthath, kohni ko aage kii or uthaanaa or prabhavi rup se sir ko agrabhuja, lacheelee bicepse or kandhe kii madad se bachaana
 More advanced Muay Thai blocks are usually counters, which are used to damage the aggressor to prevent the next attack
 adhikansh pratispardhi purna sampark vaale, ladaai ke khelon kii tarah, may thai bodi condishning par bahut adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Muay Thai is specifically designed to promote the level of body fitness and complexity required for ring competition
 is jatil khel ke prashikshan ke dauraan kai vyaayaam karwaae jate hai jaise daudna, shedoboxing, rassi kudana, sharir ke bhaar ko rokane vaale vyaayaam, dawa gend vyaayaam, udar ke vyaayaam or kuch maamalon main vajan prashikshan
 may thai ke peshewar aamtaur par apane gahan prashikshan satr ke pehle or baad main udaartaapurvak namman may ko lagu karte hai
 The training which is special for Muay Thai contestants includes training with Thai pads, focus mitts, heavy bags and sparring etc
 abhyaas kii bhinn vidhiyon main, dainik prashikshan main kai round hote hai 
 thai pad prashikshan may thai condishning kaa ek mahatvurna hissaa he, jisamen panch, kik, ni or albo ke prahaar kaa abhyaas ek aise prashikshak ke saath kiya jaataa he, jisane apni bhujaaon or agrabhujaaon par mote pads pahane hote hai
 These special pads are used to reduce the impact of the aggressive hit, and this allows the aggressive pad holder to respond to the blow
 prashikshak aksar apane udar kshetra ko cover karne ke liye baili pad bhi pahentaa he, jisase round ke dauraan aakraamak kisi bhi samay sidhi kik yaa ghutane kaa prahaar uske sharir par kar saktaa he
 Focus mitts are used for training the aggressor's hand movements, punch combinations, timing, punch ability, defense or defense, and counter-attacks
 or iskaa upyog kohni ke prahaar kaa abhyaas karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Heavy bag training is a conditioning and strength exercise related to the technique of exercise on the pad
 spering vah takanic he jisamen sahyogi ke khilaaf kushalta, range, ranneeti or samay nirdhaaran kii jaanch kii jaati he
 Sparring is often a mild to moderate contact exercise as competitors are not advised to risk any injury through difficult sparring
 vishishtaspering ke saath vishisht takneekon or ranneetiyon kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he jisamen najdiki ladaai, clinching, keval ghutanon kaa prahaar, ring ko kaatna shaamil he, yaa ek ugr aakraamak se duuri banaaye rakhane ke liye pahunch or duuri kaa upyog bhi kiya jaataa he
 Professional Muay Thai contestants spend relatively little time in the ring due to rigorous training exercises
 kai peshewar thai pratiyogiyon kii agali peedi ko prashikshan dene ke liye sevanivrutt ho jate hai
 Most professional Thai boxers come from weak Aarti economic backgrounds and remain in the region for funds to support their families
 bahut kam ucch aarthik str ke thai log peshewar may thai rank main pahunchate hai; ve aamtaur par ve is khel ko keval shaukia may thai boxr ke rup main hi khelte hai
 
 may thai ko kai alag deshon main khelaa jaataa he or desh ke aadhaar par iske niyamon main bhinnata he
 These rules also depend on the institution in which it is organized

 Boxing and other forms of kickboxing, such as Muay Thai, are considered an effective basis of assault within MMA, and mma's competitors are extensively trained
 pratiyogi jaise anderson silva, vanderlei silva, marisio rua, thongo silva, elister ovream, jose eldo, paul daale, gina karano ko unki thai boxing prishthbhumi ke liye behatar janaa jaataa he
 Countless other mixed martial artists have trained in Muay Thai and are often taught in MMA gyms as BJJ and wrestling
 may thai se sambandhit kai takneekon ko aksar meme main dekha jaataa he, jaise panch, albo, clinch fiting, leg kik or ni
 The trend towards Muay Thai has increased in the last ten years, as films and television have popularized martial arts

 Subhash Chandra Bose, who is also known as Netaji, was the pioneer and most leader of India's freedom struggle
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan, angrezon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye, unhone japan ke sahyog se azaad hind fouj kaa gathan kiya tha
 The slogan of Jai Hind given by him has become the national slogan of India
 "tum mujhe khun do main tumhe aazaadee duungaa" kaa naaraa bhi unka tha jo us samay atyadhik prachlan main aayaa
 Some historians believe that when Netaji tried to get help from Japan and Germany, the British government ordered his spies to end them in 1941
 netaa ji ne 5 july 1943 ko singapore ke toun haal ke saamne 'supreme commander' ke rup main sena ko sambodhit karte hue "dilli chalo!" kaa naaraa diya or japani sena ke saath milakar british va kamanwealth sena se burma sahit imphal or kohima main ek saath jamkar morcha liya
 On October 21, 1943, Subhash Bose, as the supreme commander of the Azad Hind Fauj, formed a temporary government of independent India, which was recognized by Germany, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Italy, Manchuko and Ireland
 japan ne andaman va nicobar dweep is asthaayee sarkaar ko de diye

 On 6 July 1944, he released a broadcast in the name of Mahatma Gandhi from Rangoon radio station in which he sought his blessings and best wishes for victory in this decisive war
 netaji kii mrityu ko lekar aaj bhi vivaad he
 While his martyrdom day is celebrated every year on August 18 in Japan, his family members living in India still believe that Subhash did not die in 1945
 ve uske baad rus main nazarband the
 If this is not the case, why has the Indian government not yet made documents related to his death public? 16 janvari 2014 ko kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang vaali janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh diya
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha
 unke pita kaa naam janakinath bose or maan kaa naam prabhavati tha
 Jankinath Bose was a famous lawyer of the city of Cuttack
 pehle ve sarkari vakil the magar baad main unhone nijee practice shuru kar di thi
 He worked for a long time in the monarchy of Cuttack and was also a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly
 angrez sarkaar ne unhen rhibahadur kaa khitaab diya tha
 Prabhavati Devi's father's name was Ganganarayan Dutt
 dutt parivaar ko kolkata kaa ek kuleen kysth parivaar mana jaataa tha
 Prabhavati and Jankinath Bose had 14 children in all, with 6 daughters and 8 sons
 subhash unki nauveen santaan or paanchaven bete the
 Of all his brothers, Subhash was most fond of Sharad Chandra
 sharadbabu prabhavati or janakinath ke duusare bete the
 Subhash used to call him Mejda
 sharadbabu kii patni kaa naam vibhavati tha
 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination
 gave
 49veen bengal regiment main bhartee ke liye unhone pariksha di kintu ankhen kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen sena ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Somehow he got admission in the Scottish Church College, but the mind was asking to join the army
 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921
 ek patr deshvandhu chittaranjan das ko likhaa
 But soon after getting the letter from his mother Prabhavati that "father, family members or anything else, they are proud of their son's decision
" " subhash june 1921 main maansik evam naitik vigyaan main trypass kii degree ke saath swadesh waapas laut aaye
 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 In order to force the government to release him, Subhash did not start committing death in prison 
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey

 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention

 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India

 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha
 It was an unprecedented salute given by one Krantivir to another Kranti Veer

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript

 The initial plan was to publish 'samagra Sahitya' in 10 volumes, but later the scheme was reduced to 12 sections
 april 1980 main sarvapratham bangla main iske pratham khand kaa prakaashan hua tha or november 1980 main angreji main
 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published
 iskaa antim khand 2011 i0 main chap kar aa paaya; haalanki isaki saamagree pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke pratham khand main unki 'aatmakatha' ke saath kuch patron kaa prakaashan hua he or dwitiya khand main unki suprasiddh pustak 'bharat kaa sangharsh' kaa prakaashan hua he

 They find a girl named Sandhya or 'sandi' who is like a Shantipriya and a 'O K' addict
 or phir unki yojana shuru hoti he-- om mukesh ke saath khel kheltaa he
 Sandi comes in front of Mukesh in the form of Shanti
 mukesh sochataa he ki vah shanti kii aatma he or bhaybheet rahane lagata he
 But then one day Mukesh knows that this woman is someone else, not peace
 vah satark ho jaataa he
 Finally, Om and Mukesh scramble on the set
 om kahata he ki vah purvajanm main mukesh dwaara shanti kii hatya kaa gavaah tha
 Mukesh challenges him that no court will believe in the matter of previous birth
 tabhi shanti ke vesh main ek yuvati vahaan aakar kahati he ki set par lage jhumar ke thik neeche hatya kaa subut dabaa hua he-- uskaa sharir, jise mukesh ne jivit hi bhoomi ke neeche dafna diya tha
 She stops Om from attacking Mukesh

 Sandy enters the room with Pappu from the other side
 tab om ko samaj aata he ki subut kii baat bataane vaali sandy nahin, asli shantipriya kii aatma thi, jisane apane hatyare se badla le liya
 The soul of peace, seeing Om with compassion, smiles and disappears
