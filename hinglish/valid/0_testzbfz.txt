 At present, fingerprint is considered the best among methods of identification
 jeev jantuon, manushyon main vishesh sanrachanayukta vah rasayan jo use vishisht pahchaan pradaan karata he, use diene kehete hai
 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA
 sharir ke kuch hisson main inaki sankhya alag-alag hoti he
 The activity of the trillions of cells present in the body is determined by DNA
 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species
 is prakriya ko genetic fingerprinting or diene profiling bhi kaha jaataa he
 It was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, scientist at the University of British Leicester
 forencik vigyaan main diene fingerprint kaa upyog hota he
 Forensic examination no longer requires actual fingerprint

 These images look quite different from each other and each image is unique
 ek hi parivaar ke teen sadasyon ke gel pratichitra gailaree main dikhaae hai
 Here the images of mother and father are different, but the image of the son bears some resemblance to the images of mother and father
 yahaan samaan judawaan bacchon ke pratichitra ko dekhenge, to dikhataa he; ki ye donon purnataya ekasmaan hai
 Thus different individuals can be identified by DNA finger printing, the mother or father of the offspring can be identified; But it is not possible to identify identical twins
 tritiy charan Fourth phase pancham charan Parent and child prints judwaaon ke print Inability to print identities of twins di en e finger printing ek nutan evam shashakt takanic he, jo nimnlikhit kshetron main prayog main laayi ja sakati he:- Through DNA sealing, positive identification can be done at the individual level through blood semen, hair, mutilated dead body remains, teeth or bone fragments etc

 Because each person has a DNA of both the parents, this can be confirmed on the basis of the impression of the DNA
 forensik jaev praudyogiki abhi ek nayaa kshetra he, jo jangalon main hone vaale aparaadhon ko sulajhaayen ke liye ek hathiyaar kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Indian judicial system has accepted DNA finger printing as concrete evidence
 mritak ke sharir ke bikhare hue tukdon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bhi is takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique was used for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh

 is vidhi ko pashuon kii vishesh jati ke sudhaar ke liye prayukt karke is kshetra main vaanchit safalataa praapt kii ja sakati he
 In the field of agriculture and horticulture, the correct caste of seeds can be tested by DNA finger printing
 yah adhik uttam or vaanchit jatiyon ke vikaas main sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he
 This method can be helpful in the selection of the same type of male or female plants
 jaise amaruud, khajur aadi, jinamein maadaa paudhe hi vaanchit hai, tathaa ling kaa pataa ek lambey samay ke baad hi chalata he
 In such cases, time, labor and money can be saved by using this method

 Variables in mathematics can be continuous or discrete
 yadi koi char, do vaastavik maanon ke bich ke sabhi vaastavik maan grahan kar saktaa he to kaha jaataa he ki vah char in do maanon ke bich satat he
 But if a variable cannot accept all real values between two values but only a few values, then that variable is called discrete variable
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki koi char sankhya rekha ke kuch bhaag main satat ho jabaki kisi anya bhaag main asatat

 The term "supernatural" or "otherworldly" is also used for this
 chunki inke astitv ko siddh kar paanaa sambhav nahin hota, isliye aamtaur par log inke bare main asahmat rahete hai
 Scientists believe that we should speak on the subject rather than the natural, because we cannot prove that the natural subject is real
 kuch anya logon kaa maananaa he ki yadhyapi paraprakritik vishyon kaa vaigyanik pramaan nahin hota, lekin ye vaastavik hai
 Many subjects such as religion, magic, miracles, soul, ghost, angel, devil, god and god are divine or otherworldly

 Construction of Sudarshan Lake - The most important event of the reign of Skandagupta was the construction of the dam of the Sudarshan Lake
 The history of this lake is very old
 First of all, Chandragupta built the lake from the public interest center by stopping the water of a river, later Emperor Ashoka
 For irrigation, the canal was removed from it
 Once in 150 AD, the dam was broken; Rudradaman restored it with a personal puff
 In 456 AD, the barrier of that hole was broken again, which caused the people of Sorastra to be destroyed, then Skandagupta made a lot of money with his money and got him built again
 As a result, he built a temple of Vishnu at the same place, unfortunately
 That lake and temple is not located, Skandagupta used to take full care of the means of irrigation

 Mihirbhoj is considered the greatest king of the Gurjara Pratihara dynasty
 inhone lagbhag 50 saal tak rajya kiya tha
 Their empire was very vast and under it came the Thetras which are the states of modern India, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Gujarat, Himachal etc
 mihir bhoj vishnu bhagwaan ke bhakt the tathaa kuch sikkon me inhe 'adivarah' bhi mana gaya he
 a place called Mehroli was named after him
 rashtareey rajmarg 24 kaa kuch bhaag gurjar samraat mihirbhoj maarg naam se janaa jaataa he
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja ruled for 49 years from 836 AD to 885 AD
 mihir bhoj ke samrajya kaa vistaar aaj ke multan se pashchim bengal tak or kashmir se karnataka tak phela hua tha
 He was an ardent devotee of the protector Emperor Shiva
 skandh puraana ke prabhas khand main samraat mihir bhoj ke jivan ke bare main vivaran miltaa he
 After ruling for 50 years, he handed over the throne to his son Mahendra Pal and went to the forest for retirement

 Baghdad historian al-masoodi, who came to India in 915 AD, has also written about the mighty army of 36 lakh soldiers of Mihir Bhoja in his book Maruzul Mahan
 inaki rajshahi kaa nishaan “varah” tha or muslim akramanakariyon ke man main itani bhay thi ki ve varah yani boar se nafrat karte the
 People of all classes and castes in Mihir Bhoja's army took up arms to fight the nation and fought the Islamic invaders
 samraat mihir bhoj ke mitra kabul kaa laliya shahi raja kashmir kaa utpal vanshi raja avanti varman tathaa nepal kaa raja raghavdev or assam ke raja the
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja at that time was the enemy, Palavanshi king Devpal, the nation of the south, Katu Maharaj Amodhavarsha and the Khalifa of Arabia, Matsim Sim Wasik, Mutvakkal, Muntashir, Mautamidadi
 arab ke khalipha ne imran bin musa ko sindh ke us ilaake par shaasha niyukt kiya tha
 Which had the right of the Arabs
 samraat mihir bhoj ne bengal ke raja devpal ke putr narayanalal ko yuddh main parrast karke uttari bengal ko apane samrajya main sammilit kar liya tha
 The king of the south defeated the king Amodhavarsha and merged his territory with his empire
 sindh ke arab shaasha imran bin musa ko puri tarah parajeet karke samast sindh gurjar pratihaar samrajya kaa abhinn ang bana liya tha
 Only Mansura and Multan remained in Sindh near the two Arabs because the Arabs had built caves called Anmahfuz in order to escape the stormy fierce invasions of the Gurjara Pratihara emperor in which Arabs hid their lives
 samraat mihir bhoj nahi chaahate the ki arab in do sthanon par bhi surakshit rahen or aage sankat kaa kaaran bane isliye usne kai bade sainik abhiyaan bhej kar imran bin musa ke anamhafooj naamak jagah ko jeet kar gurjar pratihaar samrajya kii pashchimi simaaen sindh nadi se sainkadon mile pashchim tak panhucha di or isi prakaar bharat desh ko agali shatabdiyon tak arabon ke barbar, dharmandh tathaa atyaachaari akramanon se surakshit kar diya tha
 In this way, the boundaries of the kingdom of Emperor Mihir Bhoj from Kabul to Ranchi and Assam, from the Himalayas to the Narmada River and Andhra, from Kathiawar to Bengal, were strong and secure
 arab yatri suleman or masudi ne apane yatra vivaran main likhaa he ’jinka naam barah he

 Mihir Bhoja spent fifty years of his life engaged in wars on horseback in the battlefield
 uski chaar sena thi unamem se ek sena kanakapaal parmaar ke netritv main gadhwal nepal ke raghavdev kii tibet ke akramanon se raksha karti thi
 Similarly, an army under the leadership of Alkan Dev was stationed near the present Gujraj city of Punjab, which protected the Lalia Shahi kings of Kabul from invasions on behalf of Turkistan
 isaki pashchim kii sena multan ke musalmaan shaasha par niyantran karti thi
 The army of the south fought the battle of the king of Balhara and the other two forces in two directions
 samraat mihir bhej in chaaron senaaon kaa sanchaalan, maargdarshan tathaa niyantran swayan karata tha
 Like his ancestor Gurjara Pratihara Emperor Nagabhat I, Emperor Mihir Bhoja, like his ancestors, raised a standing army which was necessary to compete with the Arab invaders! If other emperors after Nagabhatta had not kept a permanent, trained and skilled and patriotic army, then the history of India would have been different and nothing called Indian culture and civilization would have survived
 jab arab senaayen sindh praant par adhikaar karne va usko muslim raashtra main parivartit karne ke baad samast bharat ko muslim raashtra banane ke liye senapati mohammad juned ke netritv main aage badi, to unhen sindh se mili gurjar pradesh ko jeetna jaruri tha
 So they started terrible attacks
 ek taraf arab, syria va iraq aadi ke islamic sainik the, jinka makasad puri duniya main islamic hukumat kaayam karnaa tha or duusari taraf mahaan arya-dharm va samskruti ke pratik gurjar ! arabi dharmaandh yoddha ’allaah hoon akbar” ke udghosh ke saath yuddh main aate to mihir bhoj kii sena jai mahadev jai gurjeshwar, jai mahakaal kii lalkaar ke saath takkar lene or kaatane ko teyar thi
 The Hindu warriors considered the attack on the sleeping soldiers in the night against religion, but the Muslim invader would attack at any time during the night, such terrible wars continued in Arabs and Gurjaro
 kabhi rankshetra main bhinmaal, kabhi hakadaa nadi kaa kinaaraa, kabhi bhadauch va vallabhi nagar tak arabon ke prahaar ho jate the
 Some cities were damaged and some cities were destroyed

 For twelve years, many famous cities like Bhinmal etc
 were badly destroyed and many dynasties were destroyed and the condition of many was greatly deteriorated, but the brave heroes of Arya religion and culture did not lose courage
 kashmir kaa samraat shankar varman mihir bhoj kaa mitra tha
 At the time of Mihir Bhoja, the Arabs tried hard to increase their power in India, but the brave Hindu emperor drove the Arabs out of Kutch where they started moving
 is vir samraat ne apane baahubal se khalipha kaa adhikaar sindh se bhi hataa liya
 Mihir Bhoja's official, Alakhan Kabul, continued to help King Lalip of Hindushahi dynasty against the invasions of the Arabs, because Kabul Kandhar was part of India at that time

 ye saamanyat: 16,000 athwa 25,000 volt kii veltata par pravartit hote hai
 The motors used for electrification must initially provide the maximum traction torque, as a lot of power is initially required to pull a vehicle, but as the velocity increases, less power is required

 For this reason it is possible to use a high voltage system, which can save enough in the traction system

 In traction systems, it is also possible to use a tripost induction motor, taking a phase line from the normal triplet phase, by turning it into a triplet system by phase shift
 is prakaar saamaanya motaron kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he or pravastha santulan kii samasya kaa bhi sahaj samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 In fact a similar traction mechanism has been used in Hungary, but due to the not so suitable traction induction motors for traction, this mechanism has not been in common use

 bharat kii panchayat raaj pranali main gaanv yaa chote kasbe ke str par gram panchayat yaa gram sabha hoti he jo bharat ke sthaneey swashaasan kaa pramukh avyav he
 The sarpanch is the elected supreme representative of the gram sabha
 pracheen kaal se hi bharatvarsh ke saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik jivan main panchayat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan rahaa he
 Every aspect of public life was governed by this
 vaidic kaal main bhi panchayaton kaa astitv tha
 The head of the village was called Gramani
 uttar vaidic kaal main bhi yah hota tha jiske madhyam se raja gram par shashan karata tha
 The "village elders" were included in the Buddhist village councils
 inke pramukh ko "grambhojak" kehete the
 The council or panchayat used to arrange the land of the village and help the village collector in maintaining peace and security in the village
 janhit ke anya kaaryon kaa sampadan bhi vahi karti thi
 Panchayat is also mentioned in Smriti texts
 kautilya ne gram ko raajnneetik ikai mana he
 The "grammarian" of "economics" was the head of the village, which had so many rights
 apane saarvajanik kartavyon ko puraa karne main vah gramvaasiyon kii sahaayta letaa tha
 Cooperation of villagers in other public interest works was also desirable
 gram kii ek saarvajanik nidhi bhi hoti thi jisamen jurmaane, dand aadi se dhan aata tha
 Thus the rights and duties of the Gramikas and Grampanchayats were included, whose violation was punishable
 guptkaal main gram shashan kii sabase choti ikai tha jiske pramukh ko "graamic" kehete the
 He ruled the village with the help of "panchamandal" or Panchayat
 "gramvriddh" is panchayat ke sadsy hote the
 Harsha also adopted this system
 uske samay main rajya "bhukti", "vishay" or "gram" main vibhakt tha
 The Madhuban inscription of Harsha mentions Samakundaka village which was under the theme "kundaghani" and "ahichhatra" Bhukti
 grampramukh ko graamic kehete the
 The Chola and North Mallur inscriptions of the ninth and tenth centuries show that there was a panchayat system in the south as well
 graamy swashaasan kaa vikaas chol shashan kii mukhya visheshta thi
 These communal governance units were called "kurrum", which included several villages
 kurrum ek swaitshasi ikai thi
 Governance was vested in a Mahasabha, the people of the district village were elected and the assembly used to run the work of governance through its committees

 She also used to do justice related work

 Some kind of panchayat system continued in Muslim and Maratha periods too, and each village remained self-supporting
 angreji shasankaal main panchayat-vyavastha ko sabase adhik dhakka pahunchaa or vah yah vyavastha chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Nevertheless, Panchayats remained in the social life of the villages
 prayek jati athwa varg kii apni alag-alag panchayatein thim jo uske saamaajik jivan ko niyantrit karti thim or panchayat kii vyavastha evam niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaale ko kathor dand diya jaataa tha
 The government did not interfere in the actions of these panchayats
 aarambh se hi angrejon kii niti yah rahi ki shashan kaa kaam, yathasambhav, adhikadhik rajya karmchaariyon ke haathon main hi rahe
 As a result, due to the establishment of foreclosure and civil courts, new revenue policy, policing, development of means of swapping, etc
, the self-reliant life and local autonomy of the villages gradually ended
 parantu aage chalakar angrejon ne bhi yah anubhav kiya ki unki kendrikaran kii niti se shashanbhaar din prati din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the demand for autonomous governance was also increasing due to national awakening
 atev unhen vikendrikaran kii disha main kadam uthaane ko baadhya hona padaa
 Initially district boards and municipal boards were established
 san 1907 ke vikendrikaran sambandhi shahi kamishan ne panchayaton ke mahatv ko swikar kiya or apni report main likhaa ki kisi bhi sthaayee sanghathan kii neenv, jisase janata kaa sakriy sahyog prashasan ke saath ho, graamon main hi honi chahie
 The commission recommended that in a few selected villages, which are free from mutual penalties and quarrels, panchayats should be established and initially given limited powers
 tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne 1915 i
 main kamishan kii siforeeshon ko siddhantat: to swikar kar liya parantu vyavhaar main unki purnataya upeksha kii gai
 Panchayats were formed in very few villages; Those who remained were also fully controlled by the government
 bharat sarkaar ke 1919 main adhinium ke anusaar prantiy sarkaron ko swashaasan ke kuch adhikaar die gaye or 1920 ke aasapaas sabhi praanton main gram panchayat adhinium banaae gaye
 About 4700 gram panchayats were established in the United States under the Panchayat Act of 1920
 sabhi praanton main panchayaton ko simit adhikaar die gaye
 She took care of public health, sanitation, medicine, development, roads, ponds, wells etc

 They are maximum Rs 200
 Could take cases related to movable property and Rs
 50 in criminal cases
 Could be fined till
 inaki aay kaa mukhya saadhan jurmaana yaa daan tha
 But the reality was that these panchayats were totally ineffective compared to the ancient panchayats, their panches were nominated by the government without being elected by the people and their economic condition was bad due to lack of income
 duusari ore rashtriya andolan ke karnadhaar yah anubhav karte the ki gaanvon kaa aarthik or naitik patan keval panchayaton kii pun: sthapana dwaara hi roka ja saktaa he
 In the Dasutri program for Gandhi's villages, the main thing was to strengthen the panchayats
 ve panchayaton ko swantatra bharat kii shashanvyavastha kii aadharshila bananaa chaahate the
 This was the norm in 1937 in front of the Congress governments established in seven provinces
 uttar pradesh main anek graamon main jeevansudhar samitiyaan banaai gai jinhen gramvikas ke kaary saunpe gaye
 Thus until 1947 AD, there was lack of proper panchayat system in the villages
 swatantraprapti ke pashchaat is vyavastha ko punerjeevit karne ke sakriy prayaas aarambh hue
 Panchayat Raj Act was enacted in Uttar Pradesh in 1947
 samvidhan ke antargat "raajnneeti ke nideshak tatwon" main rajya kaa yah pramukh kartavya batalaaya gaya ki "vah gram panchayaton kaa sanghathan karne ke liye agrasar ho" tathaa "unako aisi shaktiyaan or adhikaar pradaan kare jo unhen swytt shashan kii ikaayiyon ke rup main kaary karne yogya banane ke liye aavashyak hon"
 According to this directive, steps were taken to implement the panchayat system in each state and a panchayat was established in each village or village group
 panchayat ke sadasyon kaa chunaav gaanv ke matadhikarprapt vyaktiyon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Gram Panchayats arrange village cleanliness, lighting, roads, dispensaries, wells cleaning and repair, public land, penetration, markets and fairs and pastures, accounts for births, deaths and farming, advancement of industries and businesses, diseases Also maintains cremation and cemeteries
 vriksharopan, pashuvansh kaa vikaas, gramsuraksha ke liye gramsevak dal kaa gathan, sahakaarita kaa vikaas, akaal peedito kii sahaayta, pulon or puliyon kaa nirmaan, skulon or aspataalon kaa sudhaar aadi inke aichhik kartavya hai
 Nyaya Panchayats are the other part of the panchayat system in the villages
 graamon main mukademebaaji kam karne tathaa janata ko sasta nyaay sulabh banane kii drushti se nyaay panchayaton kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 They have been given some rights in civil, criminal and goods matters
 prayek rajya main panchayaton ke adhikaar or daayitv newnaadhik rup se samaan he
 More steps have been taken towards fully implementing the decentralization regime
 panchayaton ke adhikaron or kartavyon kaa kshetra vistrut ho rahaa he
 In this way gram panchayats have again become an integral part of the life of our country

 micro-computer ek aisa computer he jisamen micro-procesar iske central processing unit ke rup main hota he
 They are smaller in size than mainframes and mini computers
 kai micro-computer personal computer bhi hote hai 
 The abbreviation "micro" was common during the 1970s and 1980s, but is no longer commonly used
 "micro-computer" shabd mini computer ke aane ke baad aam upyog main lokapriy hua he, haalanki ijac asimov ne apni laghu katha "da daaing nite" main 1956 main "micro-computer" shabd kaa prayog kiya tha
 Most notably, the micro-computer had replaced many of the individual components that make up the mini-computer's CPU with an integrated microprocessor chip
 sabase praarambhik modelon jaise ki oltare 8800 ko aksar kit ke rup main bechaa gaya tha jinhen upyogkarta dwaara ekatrit kiya jaataa tha or yah kam se kam 256 bits ke ram main aata tha, saath hi isamen indicater liton or swichon ke alaava anya koi bhi input / output upkaran nahin hota tha; yah is avadharana kaa pradarshan karne ke pramaan ke rup main upyogi tha ki is tarah kaa saral upkaran kya kuch kar saktaa he
 However, just as the memory of microprocessors and semiconductors has become somewhat cheaper, with them, microcomputers have become much cheaper and easier to use: laagat or upyogita main in sabhi sudhaaron kaa parinaam 1970 ke dashak ke uttararddh or 1980 ke dashak kii shuruyaat ke dauraan inaki lokapriyata main jabardast oochaal ke rup main saamne aayaa
 a large number of computer manufacturers packaged micro-computers for use in small business applications
 1979 tak kai companiyon jaise ki chromemko, procesar technology, mesaai, northstar, southwest technical products corporation, ohio scientific, oltose, moro dizin or anya ne chote vyavsaayon ke liye accounting, database prabandhan or ward processing jaisi vyavsaayik pranaliyaan pradaan karne ke liye ek sansadhanyukt antim upyogkarta yaa salaahkaar form ke liye dizin kiye gaye systamon kaa utpaadan kiya
 This allowed for businesses unable to hire micro-computers or time-sharing services to automate business activities without recruiting full-time staff operating computers

 "micro-computer" shabd kaa dainik upyog 1980 ke dashak ke madhya se kaaphi kam ho gaya or ab yah aam upyog main nahin he
 It is most commonly associated with all-in-one 8-bit home computers and first wave of small business computers
 haalanki, yaa shaayad, kyonki aadhunik microprocesar-aadhaarit upkarnon kii teji se vividhtapurna ho rahi shrinkhalaa "microcomputer" kii paribhaasha main feet hoti he, unhen ab dainik samvaad main us tarah sandarbhit nahin kiya jaataa he
 In common usage, the term "microcomputer" is largely used as a description of "personal computer" or "PC", suggesting that it has been designed for use by one person at a time
 ibiem ne sabase pehle "personal computer" shabd ke prayog ko badhaava diya, jiskaa uddeshy anya micro-computaron, jinhen aksar "home computer" kaha jaataa tha or saath hi ibiem ko apane menfrem or mini-computaron se "personal computer" ko alag karnaa tha
 Unfortunately for IBM, the microcomputer and the term were widely copied
 ghatak ke bhaag nirmaataaon ke liye saamanytah uplabdh the or bis ko clinroom dizin takneekon ke madhyam se reverse ejeeniyar kiya gaya tha
 IBM pc-friendly "clones" became commonplace and the term "personal computer" and especially "PC" settled in the minds of the common man

 Other devices that make up a complete micro-computer system include batteries, a power supply unit, a keyboard, and various input / output devices used to transmit information to or from a human operator
 micro-computero ko ek samay main keval ek upyogkarta ke prayog ke liye dizin kiya gaya he, haalanki inhen aksar ek saath, ek se adhik upyogkarta ke prayog ke liye software yaa hardware ke saath sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he

 haalanki kuch micro-computer akele ram kaa upyog kar kaaryon ko nishpadit karte hai, lekin secondary storage ke kuch swaroop aam taur par vaanchhneeya hote hai
 In the early days of Home Micro it was often a data cassette deck
 baad main secondary storage ko micro-computer cese ke andar hi banaaya gaya tha
 Although they did not include any microprocessors but were built around transistor-transistor logic, hewlett-packard's calculators of 1968 had different levels of programmability so that they could be called micro-computers

 The Datapoint 2200, produced by CTC in 1970, is possibly the best candidate for the title of "first micro-computer"
 haalanki isamen koi microprocesar shaamil nahin he, isamen 4004 programing anudesh set kaa upyog kiya gaya he or iskaa custom titiel intel 8008 kaa aadhaar tha or vyaavhaarik uddeshyon ke liye yah system kuch aisa vyavhaar karata he jaise ki isamen ek 8008 maujuud he
 This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of building Datapoint's CPU but CTC eventually rejected the 8008's design because it required 20 support chips
 ek anya praarambhik system kenbek-1 ko 1971 main jari kiya gaya tha
 Like the Datapoint 2200, it used discrete transistor-transistor logic instead of a microprocessor, but it functioned like a micro-computer in most ways

 sugriv ramayana kaa ek pramukh paatr he
 He is a follower of the person
 hanuman ke kaaran ram se uski mitrataa huyi
 In Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindhandaka, Sundarakanda and Yudhkanda describe Sugriva as Vanararaj
 jab ram se uski mitrataa huyi tab vah apane agraj wali ke bhay se rishyamook parvat par hanuman tathaa kuch anya vafaadaar rich tathaa vanar senapatiyon ke saath rah rahaa tha
 Sugriva had arranged for the monkey and the army to climb Lanka
 dundubhi ke bade bhai mayavi kii wali se kisi stri ko lekar badi puraani shatruta thi
 Mayavi came to Kishkindha one night and challenged Vali to a duel
 lalkaar sweekaar kar wali us asur ke peeche bhaaga
 Sugriva was also with him
 bhay ke kaaran bhaagate huye mayavi zamin ke neeche bani ek kandara main ghus gaya
 Vali also followed him
 jane se pehle usne sugriv ko yah aadesh diya ki jab tak vah mayavi kaa vadh karke lautakar nahin aata, tab tak sugriv us kandara ke muhane par khadaa hokar paharaa de
 After a gap of more than a year, blood came out from the mouth of the cane
 sugriv ne asur kii chitkaar to suni parantu wali kii nahin
 Realizing that his forehead was killed in the battle, Sugriva closed the mouth of that candra with a rock and returned to Kishkindha where he told the news to everyone
 mantriyon ne salaah kar sugriv kaa rajbhishek kar diya
 After some time, Vali appeared and was very angry when he saw his brother-in-law
 sugriv ne use samajhane kaa bharsak praytn kiya parantu wali ne uski ek na suni or sugriv ke rajya tathaa patni rumaa ko hadapkar use desh-nikaala de diya
 Due to fear, Sugriva took refuge in Mount Rishimuk where Vali could not go due to the curse
 yaheen sugriv kaa milaap hanuman ke kaaran ram se hua
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but the face and body composition of both brothers was the same, so Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antat wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Desperate Sugriva again walked towards Kishkindha's gate to dare Vali
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys Rama's patronage because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare him again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 donon bhaaiyon main phir se dwandv shuru hua lekin is baar ram ko donon bhaaiyon ko pahchaanane main koi galati nahin huyi or unhone wali par ped kii oot se baan chalaa diya
 The arrow pierced Vali's heart and he fell down to the ground
 wali ke vadh ke pashchaat tara ne yahi uchit samajha ki sugriv ko swami sweekaar kare kyonki usne angad ke hiton kii raksha bhi to kerani thi
 When Sugriva got engrossed in Rajollas and forgot the promise of Rama to find Sita, Rama sent Lakshmana to remind him of his promise
 lakshmana vaise bhi kaafii gussell the
 He almost invaded Kishkindha's capital, Pampapur
 sugriv ko apni galati kaa ahsaas ho gaya lekin lakshmana kaa saamana karne kii uski himmat na huyi
 He urges Tara to calm Laxman
 tara ranivas se madonmatta nikali or lakshmana ko shant kiya
 He gave the example of Maharishi Vishwamitra that even such Mahatmas were helpless in front of sensual pleasures, then what is the status of Sugriva and also that he is not a man but a monkey
 tara ne yah bhi varnan kiya ki sugriv ne chaaron dishaao main sena ekatrit karne ke liye doot bhej diye hai
 In the Valmiki Ramayana and other language adaptations, it is mentioned that Lakshman, after hearing the arguments of Madanamatta Tara with half-baked nayanas, went a little silent and after that he went back after assuring Sugriva's arrival and finding Sita from him
 ramayana ke kuch kshetreey roopantaranon main yah bhi darshaya gaya he ki jis samay lakshmana ne kiskindha kii rajdhani ke rajmahal ke garbhaagrih main krodhit hokar pravesh kiya tha us samay sugriv ke saath madiraa-paan karne vaali uski pratham patni rumaa nahin apitu tara thi or bhoga vilaas main vah donon tallin the
 It is appropriate to remind here that while befriending Rama, Sugriva regretted the loss of his wife Ruma by more than the loss of his kingdom
 kuch sanskarnon main lakshmana ko shant karne ke liye tara nahin varan sugriv swayan lakshmana ke saamne aata he tathaa unako yah aashwaasan dilaataa he ki usne sena ekatrit kerani shuru kar di he
 On receiving this assurance from Sugriva, Lakshmana becomes a little calm
 lanka yuddh ke dauraan sugriv ne kumbhkarna ko lalkaar kar qareeb-qareeb apni maut ko daavat de di thi
 Seeing Kumbhakarna destroy the monkey army in the war, Sugriva uprooted a year tree and attacked Kumbhakarna
 lekin vah vriksh kumbhkarna ke sir se takaraakar tut gaya
 Kumbhakarna again dragged Sugriva and killed him, but Lakshmana arrived at a time and saved Sugriva

 Netburst differed from the earlier P6 by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds that were limited by tdp's access to 115 Watt Prescott and Prescott 2M cores at 3

 2004 main paintium 4 microprocesar ke praarambhik 32-bit x86 nirdesh set ko 64-bit x86-64 set dwaara vistaarit kiya gaya tha
 The first Pentium 4 core, codenamed Willamette, was produced from 1

 paintium 4 kii ullekhneey visheshta iskaa 400 megahertz ennesabi tha
 It actually operated at 100 mhz but the FSB was quad-pumped which means that the maximum transfer rate was four times the base clock of the bus, hence it was assumed to run at 400 mhz
 eemdi athlon kaa dohare pump vaala ennesabi us samay 200 megahertz yaa 266 megahertz par chal rahaa tha

 2005 main paintium 4 ko paintium di or paintium extream adishan dual-kor sipiu dwaara sampoorit kiya gaya tha
 The advantages of netburst microarchitecture in benchmark evaluations were not clear
 saavdhaneepurvak anukulit aplication code ke saath pehle paintium 4 ne ummid ke mutabiq intel ke sabase tej paintium III se behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 But with legacy branching or x87 floating-point instructions in legacy applications, the Pentium 4 was just on par with or even behind its predecessors

 For example, amd's lower-clocked Athlon in mathematical applications outperformed the Pentium 4 by simply activating software only when it was recompiled with SSE2 support

 Two traditional metrics of CPU functionality are IPC and clock speed
 While IPC is difficult to quantify, clock speed is a simple measurement in which a single absolute number is accepted
 avyaavhaarik kharidaar sidhe taur par sabase tej clock speed vaale procesar ko sarvshereshth utpaada maanate the or paintium 4 nirvivaad rup se megahertz champion tha
 As AMD was unable to compete with these rules, it countered Intel's marketing superiority with the "megahertz myth" campaign

 At the start of the Pentium 4, Intel stated that netburst-based processors were expected to be at a scale of 10 ghz, but should be achieved)
 However, the netburst microarchitecture finally hit frequency ceiling far below that expectation - the fastest clocked Net Burst-based models reached a peak clock speed of 3

 At that time the Willamette core was expected to operate at frequencies around 1 ghz
 haalanki villamet kii relies main deree ke kaaran iske puraa hone se pehle paintium III ko pesh kiya gaya
 Due to fundamental differences in the P6 and netburst architecture, Intel could not market the Willamette as the Pentium III, which is why it was marketed as the Pentium 4
 20 navambar 2000 ko intel ne 1

 Most industry experts considered its initial release to be a stop-gap product that was introduced before it was actually produced

 The Willamette on the test bench was somewhat disappointing for analysts in that it was not only unable to outperform Athlon and the supreme-cloaked Pentium III in all test-related situations, but also from the affordable-grade AMD Duran

 This was particularly the case when amd's 130 nm production process changes in the summer of 2002 did not help the Thoroughbred-based Athlon XP CPU clock to accelerate to the extent that it ran the Pentium 4 in the 2

 kyonki us samay agypi praathmik graphics vistaar port tha, is chhuti hui visheshta ne opteron ko paintium 4 ke market segment main ghuspaith karne se vanchit kar diya
 With the introduction of the Athlon XP 3200+, AMD increased the FSB speed of the Athlon XP from 333 mhz to 400 mhz but that was not enough to weaken the grip of the new 3 ghz Pentium 4 HT

 The mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor was released to deal with the problem of putting an entire desktop Pentium 4 processor in a laptop, as some manufacturers were doing
 mobile paintium 4 main desktop paintium 4 ke vikaas ke baad ek 533 megahertz ennesabi kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Oddly increasing the bus speed to 133 mhz led to a drastic increase in TDP as mobile Pentium 4 processors generated 59

 iskaa aljie 775 sanskaran bhi uplabdh he
 Although Intel stated that the extreme version was aimed at game play, critics saw it as an attempt to end the explosion of the release of Athlon 64 and nicknamed it the "emergency Edition"
 999 dollar kii keemat ke saath ise "mahangaa sanskaran" yaa "atyant mahangaa" ke rup main bhi nirdisht kiya gaya
