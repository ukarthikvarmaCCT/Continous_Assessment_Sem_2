 Ahura Mazda is not a person, but is a sattva, a force, an energy
 zarathustra ke darshananusaar vishwa main do aadya atmaaon ke bich nirantar sangharsh jari he
 One of them is the soul of Ahura Mazda, 'spenta Menu'
 duusari he dusht aatma 'angharaa manu'
 To destroy this evil spirit, Ahura Mazda created this material world with his seven works namely sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, humans and fire
 ve jaanate the ki apni vidhwanskaari prakruti tathaa agyaan ke chalate angharaa manu is vishwa par hamalaa karegaa or isamen avyavashtha, asaty, dukh, krurta, rugnataa evam mrityu kaa pravesh kara degaa
 Man, the masterpiece of Ahura Mazda, has a central role in this struggle
 use swechha se is sangharsh main buree aatma se loha lenaa he
 In this war, his weapons will be goodness, truth, strength, devotion, ideal and immortality
 in siddhanton par amal kar maanav antat vishwa kii tamaam buraai ko samaapt kar degaa
 Some more scientific interpreters interpret religion's 'spenta menu' differently
 iske anusaar 'spenta manu' koi aatma nahin, balki sanvriddhishil, pragatisheel man athwa maansikta he
 That is, it is a quality of Ahura Mazda, the quality that creates and enhances the universe
 ishwar ne spenta manu kaa srijan isiilie kiya tha ki ek aanandadaayak vishwa kaa nirmaan kiya ja sake
 The progressive mindset divides human beings into two classes on earth
 sadaachari, jo vishwa kaa sanvardhan karte hai tathaa duraachaari, jo isaki pragati ko rokte hai
 Zarathustra wants that every person should be like God, adopt life-giving energy and be the carrier of creation, enrichment and progress
 paigambar zarathustra ke upadeshon ke anusaar vishwa ek naitik vyavastha he
 This system has not only to maintain itself, but also to develop and enhance itself
 jarathosti dharm main jadta kii anumati nahin he
 Evil forces hamper the process of development, but man is not to be distracted by it
 use sadachaar ke path kar kaayam rahete hue sadaa vikaas kii disha main badhate rahanaa he
 Each moment of life has a definite purpose
 yah koi anayas shuru hokar anayas hi samaapt ho jane vaali cheez nahin he
 Everything is according to God's plan
 sarvocch achchhai hi hamaare jivan kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 Man has to live with goodness, through goodness, for goodness
 'humat', 'huukt' tathaa 'huvarshat' jarathosti jivan paddati ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Zoroastrianism prohibits monasticism, celibacy, fasting, self-suppression etc
 aisa mana gaya he ki inase manushya kamjor hota he or buraai se ladane kii uski takat kam ho jaati he
 Pessimism and depression have been given the status of sin
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki maanav is vishwa kaa puraa anand uthaae, khush rahe
 Whatever he does, just be sure of one thing and that never deviate from the path of virtue
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon se sampann jivan kii manaahi nahin he, lekin yah bhi kaha gaya he ki samaaj se tum jitna lete ho, usase adhik use do
 To get something by killing or exploiting someone is a misdemeanor
 jo hamase kam sampann hai, unki sadaiv madad karnaa chahie
 In Zarathosti religion, death is considered a temporary victory of evil
 iske baad mritak kii aatma kaa insaaf hoga
 If she is virtuous, then she will be inhabited by joy and light, and if misdemeanor, she will go into the depths of darkness and despair, but this state of vicious soul is also temporary
 aakhir jarathosti dharm vishwa kaa antim uddeshy achchhai kii jeet ko maanata he, buraai kii sajaa ko nahin
 Hence it is believed that eventually many liberators will come and complete the victory of good over evil
 tab ahura majadaa aseem prakaash ke rup main sarvasamarthyavan honge
 Then the spirits will have the final say
 iske baad bhautik sharir kaa punarotthana hoga tathaa uskaa apni aatma ke saath punarmilan hoga
 Time will cease to exist and the seven works of Ahura Mazda will come together in eternal blessedness and attain blissful, eternal existence

 ise radio-aavriti vyatikaran bhi kehete hai
 Electromagnetic radiation can occur in two forms - electromagnetic induction and electromagnetic radiation
 aise vikshobh se paripath kaa kaary thodaa bahut prabhavit ho saktaa he yaa kabhi-kabhi puri tarah bighad jaataa he
 The source of electromagnetic interference can be any natural or artificial object in which a rapidly changing electric current is flowing
 vidyutchumbakeey vyatikaran kaa upyog radio sambaadhan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jaisaa ki kuch prakaar ke electranik yudhon main kiya jaataa he
 But it is mostly unintended
 kisi car ke paas se guzarane yaa bijli chamakane par eem radio main aane vaali ghargharaahat vastav main vidyutchumbakeey vyatikaran ke kaaran hi hota he
 This also affects cell phones, FM radio and Doordarshan, but in relatively small amounts
 yadhyapi vyatikaran or rav dono hi upyogi sanket ke liye anaavashyak vikshobh hai, phir bhi donon alag-alag hai
 The nature of both is different
 vyatikaran ek vahya strot se hota he jise hataane par vyatikaran hat jaataa he
 It can also be reduced by taking appropriate measures
 kintu kisi yukti yaa tantra kaa rav uske apane andar se utpann hota he
 The noise is of a very random nature while the nature of electromagnetic interference is associated with the frequency, amplitude etc
 of the signal flowing in the source
 ashwavansh khuravaale choupayon kaa ek vansh he jise latin main equidi kehete hai
 Due to the odd number of hooves among all the members of this dynasty - one or three - they are called poisonous
 ashwavansh main keval ek prajati he, jisamen ghode, gadahe or zebra hai
 Apart from this, this species also has all the extinct animals that are considered ancestors of the horse
 anya vishmangul jeevon - gandon or tapeiron - kii apeksha ashwavansh ke jantu adhik charhare or furtile sharir ke hote hai
 Scientists believe that initially horses were also slow-witted and leaf-eating creatures
 jaise-jaise nichi pattiyon kii kami padati gai vaise vaise ghode adhikadhik ghaas khaane lage
 Then their teeth developed in such a way that they could chew the hard grasses well

 The oldest stone horse is found in the form of fossils in the stones of the early Pradinutan era
 tab ghode aajkal kii lomadee ke baraabar hote the, unke agle pairon main paanch anguliyaan hoti thim, pichley main teen
 The squares were small in proportion to the size of the body and the front teeth were also small and simple
 pradinuthan kaal ke aarambh se aaj tak lagbhag saadhe paanch karod varsh biit chuke hai
 Many fossils of horses have been found during this long period, which shows how the evolution of today's beautiful, athletic, fast and grassy horse has arisen due to the gradual development in the teeth and legs of the horses and in the hooves
 madhyapradinuthan yug main agle pair kii paanchavin anguli bekaar nahin hui thim, parantu chaubhad kuch chaude avashya ho gaye the
 In the early modern era, the teeth adjacent to the Chaubhad had also become wide like the Chaubhad
 saamne ke taang kii anguliyon main keval teen hi anguliyaan kaam kar paati thim, agal bagal kii anguliyaan itani choti ho gai thim, ki ve bhoomi ko chhu bhi nahin paati thim
 The middle finger was very thick and athletic

 The middle finger of the front foot turned into a hoof, and no side finger could touch the ground
 adinuthan yug main daant or lambey ho gaye or unki akruti aadhunik ghodon ke daanton kii tarah ho gai
 The front hoof became even larger and the side fingers became smaller and useless
 pradinuthan yug main ghoda aadhunik ghode kii tarah ho gaya
 Its fossils are found in the stones of that era in America
 is kaal se peeche ke pattharon main ghode ke jeevashm bharat tathaa asia ke anya bhaagon or africa main bahutayat se mili hai
 As the teeth and hooves continued to develop, the body size also increased
 greeva kii kasheruka or mukh kii ore kii khopadi bhi badhati gai; isliye ghode kii akruti bhi badalati gai
 In the above description, the word horse has been used everywhere, but scientists have given special names to the equine animal of each era, or major section of the era
 vikaas ke kram main kuch naam ye hai: iyohipus, orohipus, apihipus, mesohipus, myohipus, parahipas, protohipus, plyohipass, placipal or ichwas
 These names are of the simple genealogy of evolution, all of which have been found in North America
 protohipus kii ek shakha dakshin america pahaunchi or duusari shakha asia main pahaunchi
 These branches came to an end in some time
 ichwas kii ek shakha asia main pahaunchi jisase zebra, gadaha or ghoda viksit hue
 America's original equus disappeared
 yadhyapi falan / x shunya par paribhashit nahin he lekin jaise hi x shunya kii ore agrasar hota he vaise hi / x yadrichhik rup se 1 kii ore agrasar hota he
 In other words, the marginal value of function / x at x = 0 gives 1
 ganit main falan kii seemaa kalan kii ek moolbhoot avadharana he or vishleshan vishesh rup se nivisht maan ke parivesh main falan kaa vyavhaar kii jaankaree detaa he
 Formally its first definition is from the first half of the 19th century as follows
 anaupchaarik rup se, ek falan f prayek nivisht maan se sambandhit ek nirgat f praapt karata he
 The specified value of the function is the limit l of p if the value of f is adjacent to l when x is leading to p

 He used to narrate stories of valor and virtue from childhood to his mother and encouraged Manoj that he should not always be afraid of challenges at any point of his life and always care about respect and fame
 intermediat kii padhai puri karne ke baad manoj ne pratiyogita main safal hone ke pashchaat pune ke paas khadakwasla sthit rashtriya raksha academy main daakhila liya
 After completing training, he became the officer of the first Corps of 11 Gorkha Rifles Regiment
 “jis samay rashtriya raksha academy ke chwis vaale kalam jahaan yah likhnaa hota hai ki vah jivan main kya bananaa chaahate hai kya paanaa chaahate hai vahaan sab likh rahe the ki, kisi ko chif of army staff bananaa chahta hai to koi likh rahaa tha ki use videshon main posting chahie aadi aadi, us farm main desh ke bahadur bete ne likhaa tha ki use keval or keval paramveer chakra chahie” After training at the National Defense Academy, he was posted as a commissioned officer to the 1st Battalion of the eleventh Gorkha Rifles

 Similarly, when his battalion was to be stationed in Siachen, Manoj was on a training of young officers
 vah is baat se pareshaan ho gayi ki is training kii vajah se vah siachin nahin ja paayenge
 When this contingent had a chance to carry out the difficult task, Manoj wrote to his commanding officer that if his contingent was going towards the northern glacier, they should be given a 'bana Outpost' and if it traveled towards the Central Glacier, So they got ‘wrestler posts’

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"

 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them

 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part

 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities

 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production

 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark

 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire
 kisaanon ko sthaneey rup se koi kar nahin dena padataa tha, hanlanki iske badale unhen kadai se par vaazib maatra main kar kendriya adhikariyon ko dena padataa tha

 Chandragupta Maurya had renounced his throne and converted to Jainism
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chandragupta ne apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath karnataka ke shravanbelagola main sanyasi ke rup main rahane laga tha
 In later inscriptions, it is found that Chandragupta died at the same place by fasting fast as a true devoted Jain

 Ashoka adopted Buddhism after the Kalinga war
 iske baad usne dhamm ke prachaar main apana dhyaan lagaaya
 Here Dhamma meant "moral principles", not religion or religion or religion
 us samay na to islam kaa janm hua tha or na hi isiyat kaa
 Therefore, those moral principles were not to oppose any religion outside, but to provide a moral law to man
 apane duusare shilaalekh main usne likhaa he - " dhamm kya he? alp dushkarm tathaa adhik satkarm
 Avoiding evils like fury, cruelty, anger, pride and jealousy, and observance of virtues such as mercy, generosity, truth, self-control, simplicity, attachment to morality, purity of heart, and internal and external purity
 " After adopting Buddhism, he also tried to bring it into life

 The Quran, the Quran or Koran is the holiest book of Islam and its foundation
 musalmaan maanate hai ki ise allaah ne farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko sunaaya tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran is the last and supreme book sent by Allah
 yah granth lagbhag 1400 saal pehle avataran hui he
 According to the beliefs of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad was revealed by the Qur'an Allah's angel Jibril until his death in 61032
 haalanki aarambh main iskaa prasar maukhik rup se hua par pigambar mohammad kii maut ke baad san 633 main ise pehali baar likhaa gaya tha or san 653 main ise manakikrut kar isaki pratiyaan islamic samrajya main vitarit kii gayi thi
 Muslims believe that the last of the holy messages sent by God are written in the Quran

 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faintly washed-out underlying text still appears from Mu Shkil and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"

 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 quran kaa sandesh vibhinn saahitiyik sanrachanaon or upkarnon ke saath vyakt kiya gaya he
 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed

 stephen wild ke anusaar, quran sancharit hone vaale shabdon ko samajhane, vargeekrut karne, vyakhya karne or nyaaysangat karke is metatextility ko darshata he
 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm

 Main article: Tafsir quran ne quran ke chhandon ke arthon ko samajhane, unke aayaat ko spasht karne or unke mahatv ko jaanane ke uddeshy se tippanee or vyakhya kaa ek vishaal nikaay udaaya he
 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab
 un dinon main akjejesis kavita ke saahitiyik pahaluon, iske prakaashan kii prishthbhumi or kabhi-kabhi, duusare kii madad se ek kavita kii vyakhya ke spashtikaran tak hi simit tha
 If the poem was about a historical event, some traditions of Muhammad were sometimes described to illustrate its meaning
 chunki quran shastreey arabi main boli jaati he, baad main kai islam main parivartit nahin hote the, ve hameshaa kuranik arabi ko nahin samajhate the, unhone un musalamaanon ko nahin pakadaa jo musalamaanon ke arabi main dharapravaah the or ve sulajhane se chintit the quran main vishyon ke spasht sangharsh
 Commentators who commented in Arabic explained the signs, and perhaps most importantly explained that the Quranic verses were revealed in Muhammad's prophetic career, which was appropriate for the earliest Muslim community, and which was later revealed Was done, canceling or "abrogating" Nasakh) earlier text
 haalanki, anya vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main koi nirasan nahin hua he
 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Quran 7: 143 says: jab musa us vakt aayaa jab hamane niyukt kiya, or uske allaah ne usase baat kii, to usne kaha, 'he mere allaah, mujhe apane aap ko dikhaao! mujhe tumhe dekhne do!' usne kaha, 'tum mujhe nahin dekhoge, lekin us pahaad ko dekho, agar yah drudh rahata he to aap mujhe dekhenge

 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 Baghdad, a 10th-century Muslim scholar from Ibn Mujahid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable recitations of the Quran
 unhone vibhinn qaraat or unki bharosemandata kaa adhyayan kiya or makka, madina, kufa, basra or damishq ke shaharon se saat 8 veen shatabdi ke qareeyon ko chunaa
 Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers instead of six or ten, but it may be related to a prophetic tradition that the Quran was revealed in the seven "arufs"
 aaj, sabase lokapriy kaari haafiz or warsh dwaara preshit hai jo ebn mujahid ke do pathakon, aasim ebn abi al-najud or naphi al ke anusaar hai -madani kramshah

 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted

 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language
 quran yahudee or isai pavitra kitabon or bhakthi sahitya main sunai gai kai logon or ghatnaon kii kahaniyon ko yaad karata he, haalanki yah kai vivaranon main bhinn he
 Adam, Idris, Noah, Eber, Saleh, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Shoaib, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Yunus, Aaron, Moses, Zacharias, John Jesus, mention of Rasool in the Quran And has been performed as a prophet

 Jesus is more frequently mentioned in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran and not in the Gospel

 Unitarian Universalists also draw inspiration from the Quran

 One scholar has suggested that diatesiron as a gospel harmony may have given rise to the notion that the Christian gospel is a text
 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered

 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds Muslims among themselves 
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued

 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 ek jap maala yaa maala aamtaur par hindu, buddha, jain or kuch sikhon ke dwaara aadhyatmik abhyaas jise sanskrit main jap ke rup main janaa jaataa hai use prarthana main upyog kii jane vaali prarthana manakaa kii taar kii ek maala he
 It is usually made up of 108 beads, although other numbers are also used
 maala kaa upyog, mantra yaa devtaa ke naam yaa naamon ko doharaate hue, jap karte hue yaa maansik rup se dohraane ke samay ginati rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa hai
 The mantras are usually repeated a hundred or thousands of times
 maala kaa upyog isliye kiya jaataa he taaki koi apane duharaav kii gananaa karne ke bajaay mantra ke arth yaa dhwani par dhyaan kendrit kar sake
 There is usually a repetition for each bead rotating the thumb clockwise around each bead, although some traditions or practices may call for counterclockwise motion or the use of a specific finger
 jab koi mukhya manake par pahunchataa hai to maala ko ghumaakar phir se vipareet disha se sharu karte hai
 There are usually knots between each bead
 yah maala ke upyog ko aasaan banaata he kyonki upyog karte samay manake taar par tang nahin honge 
 If more than 108 repetitions are to be performed, sometimes in Tibetan traditions a grain of rice is counted before chanting and a grain is placed in the bowl for every 108 repetitions
 prayek baar puri maala kaa doharaav puraa hone par katore main se chaaval kaa dana nikaala jaataa hai
 Often practitioners add additional counters to their rosary, usually in ten strings
 parampara ke aadhaar par inhen alag-alag sthaan par rakhaa ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye kuch paramparaayen har 10wein manake ke baad in taron ko rakhti hai
 This is an alternative way of taking care of large numbers, sometimes going into the hundreds of thousands and even millions
 maala par 109ve manakaa ko sumeru, bindu, stupa yaa guru manakaa kaha jaataa he 
 The count should always begin with a bead next to Sumeru
 hindu, vaidic parampara main, yadi ek se adhik doharaav kii maala kii janevaali ho, to vyakti ise paar karne ke bajaay sumeru tak pahunchane par disha badalata hai 
 There are several explanations as to why there are 108 beadas, with the number 108 beadas having special religious significance in many Hindu and Buddhist traditions
 is prakaar jab ham sankhya 108 padhate yaa sunaate hai, to ham vastav main puure brahmad ko yaad kar rahe hai 
 It reminds us of the fact that the universe itself is omnipresent, it is the innate nature of itself
 kuch hindu paramparaon kaa maananaa he ki ek maala kaa upyog karne kaa sahi tarika daaen haath ke saath he, anguuthe ke saath ek manakaa ko dusre se dhakka maarake aage badhaayaa jaataa hai or maala ko madhya ungali par lapeta jaataa hai
 The index finger represents the ego, the biggest obstacle to self-realization, so it can best be avoided while chanting the rosary
 purvottar bharat main vishesh rup se pashchim bengal or assam main shakta paramparaon main, maala aksar daahine haath kii anamika ungali par lapeta jaataa he, saath hi manakaa anguuthe kii sahaayta se madhya anamika se ghumaakar aage badhaayaa jaataa hai or tarjani ungali kaa upyog taalte hai
 However it is also acceptable in these areas to put a garland on the middle finger and use the thumb to rotate the bead
 maala ke manakaa banane ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii samagriyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Pearls made from the seeds of the Rudraksha tree are considered sacred by devotees of Saiva, Shiva, while pearls made from the wood of the Tulsi plant are used and revered by the Vaishnavites, followers of Vishnu
 anya aam manakaa main chandan ke ped kii lakdi yaa bodhi ped, or camel ke paudhe ke beej shaamil hai
 Some Tibetan Buddhist traditions use animal bones that are the most valuable of previous lamas
 carnellian or amethist jaise arddh keemtee pattharon kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 In Hindu tantra as well as Buddhist tantra, the material and bead colors can be related to a specific practice
