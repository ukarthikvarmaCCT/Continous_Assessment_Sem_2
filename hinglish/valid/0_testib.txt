 The langar refers to the free, vegetarian food provided in Sikh Gurdwaras
 lungar, sabhi logon ke liye khulaa hota he chaahe ve sikh ho yaa nahin
 The word langar is used in Sikhism from two perspectives
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "lungar" shabd ko niraakaari drushtikon se liya gaya he, par aam taur par "rasoi" ko lungar kaha jaataa he jahaan koi bhi aadmi kisi bhi jati kaa, kisi bhi dharm kaa, kisi bhi pad kaa ho ikatthe baith kar apane sharir kii bhukh athwa pani kii pyaas mitaa saktaa he

 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries
 
 plate vivartaniki main vivartaniki shabd unani bhashaa ke τεκτονικός se bana he jiskaa arth nirmaan se sambandhit he

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue

 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented

 Durud Sharif or Salwat or as-salatu alan-nabi is a special Arabic phrase, in which salutation is sent to the last Prophet of Islam, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and Ahl al-bait
 While mentioning Prophet Muhammad, Durud Sharif is uplifted by Muslim people
 Numerically, the number of Durud Sharif is in thousands or millions, but the original meaning of each Durud Sharif is to seek blessings and blessings from Muhammad Allaah for Muhammad and his family
 salwat, salaat kaa bahuvachan rup hai| mukhya rup se salaat main teen mul arabi shabd he- "saad, laam, vaav" | durud kaa arth prathana, bandagi,nivedan,vinati,prashansa or stuti hai | Arabic linguists believe that the meaning of salwat depends on who uses it and for whom it is used

 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include

 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 Swami Ramanand is considered the great saint of the medieval devotional movement
 unhone rambhakti kii dhara ko samaaj ke nichle tabake tak pahunchaaya
 He was the first such Acharya who preached devotion in North India
 unke bare main prachlit kahawat he ki - dwavid bhakthi upjau-laayo ramanand
 That is, the credit of propagating devotion in North India goes to Swami Ramanand
 unhone tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon jaise chuaachhut, oonch-neech or jaat-paat kaa virodh kiya
 Swami Ramanand was born in a Brahmin family in Prayag
 unki mata kaa naam sushila devi or pita kaa naam punya sadan sharma tha
 In the early period, he started showing many supernatural miracles
 dharmik vichaaron vaale unke mata-pita ne balak ramanand ko shiksha paane ke liye kaashi ke swami radhvanand ke paas shrimath bhej diya
 While living in Srimath, he studied the Vedas, Puranas and other scriptures and became a scholar
 panchganga ghat sthit shrimath main rahete hue unhone kathor sadhana kii
 There are many misconceptions about his birthday, but most scholars believe that Swamiji was born in 1300 AD
 yani aaj se koi saat sau das saal pehle
 Swami Ramanand made the door of Rama Bhakti accessible to all
 unhone anantanand, bhavanand, peepa, sen, dhanna, nabha das, narharyanand, sukhanand, kabir, raidas, sursari, padamavati jaise baarah logon ko apana pramukh shishy banaaya, jinhe dwadash mahabhagwat ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Among them, Kabir Das and Raidas later gained considerable fame
 kabir auki ravidaas ne nirgun ram kii upasna kii
 In this way, Swami Ramanand was such a great saint under whose shade both saguna and nirgun saints and worshipers found rest
 jab samaaj main chaaro ore aapasi katoota or vaimnasy kaa bhav bharaa nua tha, vaise samay main swami ramanand ne naaraa diya-jaat-paat puche naa koi-firi ko bhajai so hari kaa hoi
 unhone survey prapattedhikarinon matah kaa shankhanaad kiya or bhakthi kaa margh sabake liye khol diya
 He also gave women equal place in the canopy of devotion
 unke dwaara sthapit ramanand sampradaay yaa ramavat sampradaay aaj vaishnavon kaa sabase bada dharmik jamaat he
 Of the 52 gates of the Vaishnavas, 36 gates belong to the Ramanandis only
 is sampradaay ke sant bairangi bhi kahe jate hai
 They also have their own arenas
 yun to ramanand sampradaay kii shakhaaen auki upashakhaayen desh bhar main faili hai
 But there are hundreds of monasteries of this sect in Ayodhya, Chitrakoot, Nashik, Haridwar
 kaashi ke panchganga ghat par avasthit shrimath, duniya bhar main faile ramanandiyon kaa mul gurusthaan he
 In other words, the Shrimath of Kashi is the original Acharya Peetha of the Saguna and Nirgun Rambhakti tradition and the Ramanand community
 vartmaan main jagadguru ramanandacharya swami shriramnareshacharyaji maharaj, shrimath ke gaadi par virajman hai
 He is a learned scholar of jurisprudence and is acclaimed in the Sant Samaj
 swami ramanand ne bhakthi maarg kaa prachaar karne ke liye desh bhar kii yatraaen kii
 He went to many religious places in Puri and South India and preached Rambhakti
 pehle unhen swami ramnuj kaa anuyaadi mana jaataa tha lekin srisampradaay kaa acharya hone ke baavjood unhone apni upasna paddati main kaam or sita ko variyata di
 He made them his worshipers
 ram bhakthi kii paavan dhara ko himalay kii paavan oonchaiyon se utarkar swami ramanand ne garibon or vanchiton kii jhopadi tak pahunchaaya
 ve bhakthi maarg ke aise sopan the jinhone vaishnav bhakthi sadhana ko nayaa aayam diya
 Their sacred feet are still safe in Shrimath, Kashi, which is the center of faith of crores of Ramanandis
 swamiji ne bhakthi ke prachaar main sanskrit kii jagah lokbhasha ko praathamikta gi
unhone kai pustakon kii rachana kii jisamen anand bhashya par tikaa bhi shaamil he
 Vaishnavamtabha Bhaskar is also his major work
 bhartiya dharm, darshan, sahitya or samskruti ke vikaas main bhagwat dharm tathaa vaishnav bhakthi se sambhddha vaicharik kranti kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 Swami Ramananda emerged about seven hundred and nine years ago in the same superior tradition of great saints of Vaishnava devotion
 unhone shri sitaaji dwaara prithvi par pravartit vishishtadvait siddhant tathaa rambhakti kii dhara ko madhyakaal main anupam tivrata pradaan kii
 He is acknowledged as the proponent of the modern Bhakti path in Uttarabharata and the original promoter of Vaishnava cultivation
 ek prasiddh lokokti ke anusaar- In the erstwhile society, by removing the extreme animosity and bitterness among the various sect-sects, Hindu society did an important work of formulation
 swamiji ne maryaada purushottam shriram ko adarsh maanakar saral rambhakti maarg kaa nidarshan kiya
 In his disciple circle, while on the one hand there were casteist, untouchable, Vedic rituals like Kabirdas, Raidas, Sennai and Pipanresh, anti-virtue saints of idolatry, on the other side, archanavatar, a full-fledged supporter of avatarism, considered idolatrous masters Swami Anantananda, Bhavananda, Sursurananda, Sagunopasak Acharya like Narahariyananda was also a devotee
 usee parampara main krishnadutt payohari jaisaa tejasvi sadhak or goswami tulsidas jaisaa vishwa vishrut mahakavi bhi utpann hua
 It is famous about Acharya Ramanand that he preached Tarak Ramantra by climbing trees so that people of all castes can fall in ears and get maximum welfare of people
 unhone naaraa diya tha- Acharyapada independently enforced the Sreesapradaya
 is sampradaay ko ramanandi athwa vairaagi sampradaay bhi kehete hai
 He described the distinction of caste-line in the path of devotion with the feeling of strengthening the society, shattering and falling down, and said that the path of refuge of God is equally open to all- kahkar unhone kisi bhi jati-varan ke vyakti ko ramamantra dene main sankoch nahin kiya
 Raidas, born in tanner caste and raised in Kabul's home, Kabirdas are unique examples of this
 madhyayugin dharm sadhana ke centre main swami ji kii sthiti chatushpath ke deep-stambh jaisi he
 He protected society and culture with great vigor by initiating unprecedented social revolution
 unheen ke chalate uttarbharat main tirth kshetron kii raksha or vahaan saanskrithik kendron kii sthapana sambhav ho saki
 According to the circumstances of that era, Vairagini organized an active idolized form of Dharma to protect the pilgrimage by organizing the Sadhu Samaj as a prostitute equipped with weapons
 tirthasthanon se lekar gaanv-gaanv main vairaagi saadhuon ne akhaade sthapit kiye
 Even in this asymmetrical state of depreciation, all the monasteries, saints, Ramgunagans, Akhand Ramnath Sankirtans of the Ramanand Sampradaya are still organized throughout the world and are spreading spiritual light everywhere
 vaishnavon ke baawan dwaaron main sarvaadhik santis dwaare isi sampradaay se jude hai
 Apart from this, its branch, prashaka and avantara branches such as Ramsnehi, Kabirdasi, Ghisapanthi, Dadupanth etc
 have become the conduits of the origin of this sect
 yah swami ramanand ke hi vyaktitv kaa prabhaav tha ki hindu-muslim vaimnasy, shaiva-vaishnav vivaad, varna-vidwesh, mat-matantar kaa jhagada or paraspar saamaajik katutaa bahut had tak kam ho gai
 Impressed by the miracle of his own compound power, the then Mughal ruler Mohammad Tughlaq came to the shelter of Swami Ramanandacharya through Sant Kabirdas and issued a directive to remove all restrictions on the Hindus and Jaziyakar
 balpurvak islam dharm main dikshit hinduon ko phir se hindu dharm main waapas laane ke liye paravartan sanskaar kaa mahaan kaary sarvapratham swami ramanandaarch ne hi prarambh kiya
 History testifies that thirty-four thousand Rajputs under the leadership of King Harisingh of Ayodhya had inspired Swamiji to adopt Swadharma from a single platform
 aise mahaan sant, param vichaarak, samanvayi mahatma kaa pradurbhaav tirthraj prayag main ek kanyakubj brahman parivaar main hua tha
 The Ramananda sect, despite differences over the date of birth, holds that Adya Jagadguru was born on the Magh Krishna Saptami Samvat 1356
 inke pita kaa naam pandit punya sadan sharma or mata kaa naam sushila devi tha
 The father, who was blessed with religious rites, sent Ramananda to Srimath, Kashi, to study at Guru Raghavanand's school
 Ramananda of Kushagrabuddhi attained proficiency by studying all the scriptures and Puranas in a short span of time
 guru raghavanand or mata-pita ke dabaav ke baavjood unhone grihasthashram sweekaar nahin kiya or aaajeevan virakt rahane kaa sankalp liya
 In this way, Swami Ramanand was given the initiation of Ramatarak Mantra
 ramanand ne shrimath kii guhya sadhanasthali main pravisht ho ramamantra kaa anushthan tathaa anyaanya tantric saadhnaaon kaa prayog karte hue ghor tapascharya kii
 He completed the Ashtanga Yoga practice while solving all the hurdles of Yogamarch
 dderghaayushya praapt karne ke kaaran jagadguru raghavanand ne apane tejasvi or priy shisht ramanand ko shrimath peeth kii paavan peeth par abhishikt kar diya
 In his first address, Jagadguru Ramanandacharya expressed his resolve to overcome the evil practices and superstitions prevalent in Hindu society and to build a vast organized power for the protection of religion through mutual affection and affectionate behavior
 kaashi ke param paavan panchganga ghat par avasthit shrimath, acharyapad ke dwaara pravaahit shriram prapatti kii pavandhaara ke mukhyakendre ke rup main pratishthit hokar usee ojasvi parampara kaa anwarat pravartan kar rahaa he
 Even today, according to the vision of Srimath Acharyacharan, he is lighting the public with a lamp lit by him
 yahi vah divyasthal he, jahaan virajman hokar swamiji ne apane parampratapi shishyon ke madhyam se apni anugrahshakti kaa upyog kiya tha
 The holy center of Ramanandcharcha Peeth is the headquarters of the Ramanand sect spread across the country
 shrimath main avasthit ramanandaarch kii charanpaduka duniyabar main bikhare ramanandi santon, tapasviyon evam anuyaayiyon kii shraddha kaa anyatam bindu he
 It is a matter of absolute good fortune and satisfaction that Swami Ramnareshacharyaji, the present presiding teacher of Srimath also seems to be an icon of Swami Ramanandacharach
 unki kalpanaaen, unka gyaan, unki vagmita or sabase acchhee unki udaartaa or sangyojan chetana aisi he ki yah vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki swami ramanand kaa vyaktitv kaisaa rahaa hoga
 The present Jagadguru Ramanandacharacha post is the result of the well-known efforts of the eminent Swami Ramnareshacharya Ji Maharaj that Kabiradasi, Ravidasi, Ramasnehi, Prabhriti traditions, which have been separated from Srimath, are in harmony with Vaishnava and establish uniformity with Srimath
 kai paramparawaadi math mandiron kii ikaiyaan shrimath main villin ho rahi hai
 Aditya Jagadguru Ramanandacharya's Praktidham located in Daryaganj, Tirtharaj, Prayag, has again appeared in a grand form with his inspiration
 swami ramanand ko ramopasna ke itihaas main ek yugpravartak acharya mana jaataa he
 He organized the Ramavat sect based on the distinctive philosophy of Sreesapradaya and the philosophy of Pratapisiddhanta
 shrivashnavon ke narayan mantra ke sthaan par ramtarak athwa shadakshar ramamantra ko sampradayik diksha kaa bijmantra mana
 bahya sadachaar kii apeksha sadhana main aantarik bhav kii shuddhta par jor diya, chuaachhut, oonch-neech kaa bhav mitaakar vaishnav maatr main samta kaa samarthan kiya
 Credited the Para and Premashakti to Navadha
 saath-saath siddhanton ke prachaar main paramparaposhit sanskrit bhashaa kii apeksha hindi athwa janabhasha ko pradhanta di
 Swami Ramananda composed the Vishayadvaita Siddhantanuguna independent Ananda Bhashya on the departure
 tatv evam acharbodh kii drushti se vaishnavamtabj bhaskar, shrirampatal, shriramarchanapaddati, shriramarakshastrotam jaisi anek kaaljayi moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 These invaluable services to the nation-religion offered by Swami Ramananda established his importance in the hearts of Vaishnavas of all sects
 bharat ke sampradayik itihaas main paraspar virdohi siddhanton tathaa sadhana-paddatiyon ke anuyaayiyon ke bich itani lokapriyata unke purv kisi sampradaay pravartak ko praapt na ho saki
 The Nathpanthis of Maharashtra worshiped him as Guru of Gyandev's father Vitthal Pant, Advaita matawalambi adopted him as Brahmachari of Jyotirmath
 The saints of Babaripanth worshiped him as the originator of their sect and he was the Guru of Kabir, hence his reverence among the Kabirists is natural
 swami-ramanand ke vyaktitv kii is vyapakta kaa rahasy, unki udaar evam sargrahi pravriti or samanvayakaari vichaardhaara main nihit he
 Certainly, according to his great personality and great importance, the description of his Ramaavatar mentioned in certain scriptures and saint literature is literally proved
 ramnand: swayan ram: pradurbhuto mahitle
 The list of books composed by Swami Ramanandacharya is as follows: vaishnavamtabj bhaskar:, shriramarchanapaddatih, ramarakshastotra, siddhantapatal, gyanalila, gyanatilak, yogachintamani satnami panth Jagadguru Ramanandacharya ji has written the commentary of the departed traitor by the name ‘anandabhashya’
 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european
 hind europea parivaar kii kai shakhaayen hai
 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches
 sanskrit isi varg main aati he
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 hind-arya kabeelon kaa bhartiya upmahadweep main pravaas dhire-dhire or shantipurvak hua tha or british itihaaskaaron kii "koon-kharabe" vaali baton kaa koi pramaan nahin he
 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued
 adhiktar bhashavidon ke anusaar "aadim-hind-europea" bhashaa ke punarnirmit shabd yahi ishaara karte hai ki pracheen arya janmasthan ek vishaal, shitoshna ghaas kaa charaagaah tha
 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 Along with Pashto, it is one of the two constitutional official languages of Afghanistan
 yah afghanistan ke lagbhag 50% logon kii maatrubhaasha he or desh kii sabase adhik boli jane vaali bhashaa bhi he
 It is also used as a liaison language among communities speaking different languages in Afghanistan
 irani farsi or dari farsi bolne vaale ek dusre ko aasaani se samaj pate hai or inamen sirf lahaze or kuch shabdon kaa antar he
 According to many linguists, there are many elements of old Persian in Dari which are lost in modern Iranian Persian
 dari main shabdon kaa uccharan aksar irani farsi se alag or hindi-urdu se miltaa-julata hota he - Among them, the pronunciation of Dari is said to be similar to that of ancient Persian, and the Iranian Persian was changed
 suprasiddh darshanik george vilhem fredrick hegel kai varsh tak berlin vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak rahe or unka dehavsaan bhi usee nagar main hua
 There are eight books written by him, including Encyclopedia of Prapanchastra, Theory of Justice and Philosophical Principles, these three texts are particularly notable
 hegel ke darshanik vichaar german-desh ke hi kaant, phicte or shaling naamak darshanikon ke vichaaron se vishesh rup se prabhavit kahe ja sakate hai, haalaanki hegel ke or unke vichaaron main mahatvapurn antar bhi he
 Hegel's philosophy is called Absolute Suffixism or Chidism or Objectual Consciousness; Because in his opinion, soul-soul, seer-view, and nature-male are all different manifestations of the ultimate element or essence in the same absolute knowledge
 unke anusaar vishwa na to achetan prakruti yaa pudgalon kaa parinaam he or na kisi parichhinn vyakti ke man kaa hi khel
 root-conscious-quality-defect-maya is the same infinite, infinite and infinite conscious element in the whole world, which we can call Parbrahma
 usase pruthak kisi bhi padaarth kii satta nahin
 That absolute bird or parabrahma, by its own natural action, manifests itself in the form of various objects or natural phenomena
 use apane se pruthak kisi anya saadhan yaa saamagree kii aavashyaktaa nahin
 According to Hegel, the primordial world and our bodies, even when they are mutually distinct, are intimately related to and inseparable from each other, being manifestations of the same absolute active parabrahma
 hegel ke vichaar main sansar kaa sara hi viksaatmak kriyalap sakriy brahm kaa hi kriyalap he
 What is the root, the conscious, all matter and living being are limited or distinct forms of the same absolute squid
 jadibhoot prakruti, pranayukt vanaspatijagat, chetan pashupakshi tathaa swachetan manushyon ke rup main vahi ek parabrahm apane aapako kramash: abhivyakt karata hai or uski abtak kii abhivyaktiyon main aatmsanvittiyukt maanav hi sarvocch abhivyakti he, jiske darshanik, dharmik tathaa kalatmak uttarottar utkarsh ke dwaara brahm ke hi nijee prayojan kii purti hoti he
 In other words, Brahma develops itself by manifesting itself as the diverse substances of the world
 is prakaar, hegel kaa nirpeksh brahm ek sakriy moort saarvbhaum yaa gatyaatmak evam thos saarvbhaut tatv he, amoort saarvbhaum nahin
 He is neither calm or pseudostatic nor discriminative like the Brahma of Shankaracharya
 hegel ne shaling ke bhedashunya brahm ko ek aisi andhkarpurn raatri ke samaan bataakar, jisamen vividh rangon kii sabhi gauen kaali dikhaai padati hai, sabhi bhedashunya brahmavaadiyon kii katakshapurn aalochana kii he
 Even after accepting the invention of the whole world, Chailing, the characharaka was considered devoid of all kinds of distinctions and beyond nature
 parantu bhedashunya agatyatmak, tatv se bhedpurn tata gatyaatmak sristi ke udai yaa vikaas ko sweekaar karnaa hegel ko yuktiyukt nahin prathit hua
 He did not consider Brahm to be transcendent
 hegel kaa brahm kisi had tak shriramanujacharya ke ishwar se miltaa julata he
 They, like Sriramanujacharya, do not accept the homogeneous exogamous distinction of Brahm, but accept self-discrimination in it
 unhone use bhedatmak abhed yaa anektaagat ekta ke rup main sweekaar kiya he, shuddh abhed yaa kori ekta ke rup main nahin
 Similarly, the principle of Sriramanujacharya is also specific, not Shuddhavaita or Advaita
 hegel chhandogopanishad ke "sarv khalvidan brahm", rugveda ke "purush avedan sarvam" tathaa shrimadbhagavadgita ke "sarvat: parinpavan" aadi siddhant ke anumodak to avashyamev kahe ja sakate hai
 But not the followers of Mandukyopanishad's "amatashturtho% Viable: Prapanchopashma 


" principle
 hegel ne kriyaatmak evam gatisheel vishwa ke vibhinn roopon main honevaali brahm kii atmabhivyakti ko ek vishesh yauktik yaa bauddhik niyam ke anusaar ghatit honevaali mana he
 He said that truth is rational and rational is truth
 duusare shabd main, unke anusaar bauddhik vichaar kaa niyam or sansar ke vikaas kaa niyam ek hi he or unhone yah niyam virodh yaa virodh kaa niyam batalaaya he
 According to this, there is only internal opposition or distraction of that element for the development of the Absolute Brahman, both in the form of inertial world and individual mind
 hegel ke anusaar do virdohi yaa paraspar vyaghaatak vichaaron yaa padaarthon kaa samanvay ek tisare vichaar yaa padaarth main hua karata he
 For example, the idea of "sat" first arises in our mind, or rather the state of all things in the world is "sat"
 parantu "keval sat" yaa "sanmaatr" vastut: asat sadrush he
 Therefore lies or lack of truth is embedded in the site of truth
 or sat asat kii yah vipratipatti hi sat ke bhavi vikaas kaa mul hetu ban jaati he
 Since opposition or opposition is not tolerant of rational thought, it leads to its removal by nature itself and executes the coordination of opposing suffixes named satt and asat in a suffix called "bhava"
 hegel praarambhik pratyay ko paksh yaa nighaan, uske virdohi pratyay ko pratipaksh yaa pratidhaan tathaa unke milaanevaale pratyay ko samanvay yaa samaadhaan kehete hai or unki yah paksh se samanvayonmukhi puri prakriya virodh samanvay nyaay yaa dwand-samanvay vidhi athwa trikvaav naam se jaani jaati he
 In the above example, "sat" aspect, "asat" counterpart and "bhava" are co-ordinates
 is prakaar hegel ke virodh-samanvay-nyaay main paksh, pratipaksh, evam samanvay teenon hi kaa samaahar hota he
 To understand it more clearly, let us take our external knowledge and see how this rule applies in it
 hegel ke kathananusaar, kisi ko bhi bahya gyaan tabhi hota he jab pehle gyey padaarth kaa vishay dwaara gyaata yaa vishayi kaa virodh hota he or tatpashchaat vah vishayi us vishay se vishisht hokar apane aapmen samavisht hota he
 Here there is the "subject" aspect and the "subject" counterpart and they are coordinated with the subject's knowledge gained by the subject
 vastut: hegel ke mat main vichaar evam vishwa ke saare hi vikaas kii pragati, anivaary rup se, isi virodh samanvay nyaay ke anusaar hoti he
 He has made a sad but laudable attempt to demonstrate the utility of this justice in the interpretation of almost all areas of experience or the world
 unka kathan he ki vishwa main jo kuch bhi hota he vah sab is niyam ke anusaar hota he or iske parinamswaroop uttarottar naveen bhedprabhed yaa padaarthon kaa aavirbhaav hota rahata he
 No distinction is ever made out of absolute suffixes or Parbrahms, nor is Brahm itself separated from prepossessing substances, but in the world there is never an end to the potentialities of Brahm, and from this point of view, we can also call it worldly
 hegel ne isi brahm yaa nirpeksh pratyay main samast bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavi bhedon kaa samanvay karne kaa praytn kiya he
 "hegel's Brahma is a person or not?" This question is disputed
 hellden aadi pandit use vyakti maanate hai; parantu pro
 mekatagart aadi vidwaanon kii sammati main vah vyakti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hegel was, no doubt, a staunch satirist thinker
 unke anusaar kaary apane kaaran main apni abhivyakti se purv bhi maujuud rahata he
 In fact, they considered cause and action and virtue and quality as integral and interdependent to each other
 jis prakaar kaarnon ke abhaav main kaary nahin ho saktaa athwa gun bina guni ke nahin rah saktaa, usee prakaar, hegel ke mat main, kaary ke abhaav main bhi koi ghatana yaa vastu kaaran nahin kahala sakati, thik vaise hi jaise bina gun ke guni nahin
 Hegel's absolute suffix or Brahman, sometimes referred to as God, is not agnostic like the thorn's "orthodoxy or objects of its own
" vah hamaare chintan kaa vishay ban saktaa he, kyonki ham or hamaari chintanashkti, buddhiparichhinn hone par bhi, usee ke anuroop hai
 In other words, since the laws of our limited thought are the same as those of the universal God or his thought world, he can be aware of us through wisdom
 hegel ke is vichaarrup praytn se nihsandeh hi us chaudee khai ko paatane kaa shlaghneey kaary kiya jo kaant ne parmaarthik or vyaavhaarik vastuon ke bich main, unhen kramash: agyeya evam gyey bataakar, khod daali thi
 Hegelian philosophy, despite being an extremely important, excellent and keen intellectual endeavor, is not free from objections

 Related Census Code: ayurveda main chikitsa armbh karne ke pehle rogapariksha tathaa rogipariksha karne kaa praavdhaan he
 That is, pre-medical examination is very important
 pariksha kii jahaan tak baat aati he to pariksha rogi kii bhi hoti he or rog kii bhi
 Successful treatment can be done only by examining both the patients and by knowing their strength
 ayurvedacharyon ne rog kii pariksha hetu nidaanpanchak kaa varnan kiya he
 According to Ayurveda, the disease is tested by these five measures - in paanch upayon ko nidaanpanchak kehete hai
 Diagnosis - The cause of the disease is called diagnosis
 purvarup - rog utpann hone ke pehle jo lakshan hote hai unhen purvarup kaha jaataa he
 Roop - The signs of diseases that are caused are called symptoms or forms
 upshay - aushadh, ann va vihaar ke parinaam main sukhprad upyog ko upshay kehete hai
 Acquisition - From the earliest stages of the disease to the complete manifestation of the disease, there are six stages of the disease
 nidaanpanchak se rog ke bal kaa gyaan hota he
 Along with this, knowledge of the strength of the patient is also necessary for the treatment
 jisase yah nirnay hota he ki rogi chikitsa sahan karne yogya he athwa nahin
 For this, the description of the Daswadhi examination has come under which the rest of the examination is to know the strength of the patient, except for the pathology examination
 agyaat vyaadhi main vyaadhi ke gyaan ke liye, tathaa gyaat rog main chikitsa ke liye, upshay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are six types of appendages
 aushadh, ann va vihaar se guneet hone par upshay ke 18 bhed ho jate hai, jo 18 prakaar kii chikitsa paddatiyaan hai
 Among these types are Naturopathy, Homeopathy and HIV
 Principles of different medical practices exist
 jaise, upshay ke ek pramukh bhed 'vyaadhivipareet' par aadhaarit chikitsa paddati allopathy he jo multah lakshanon ke vipareet chikitsa he
 The only symptom is immediate suppression of the disease with the opposite drug, but the goal of the therapy, the accomplishment of 'dhatusam Satya' is uncertain
 ayurveda main bhi vyaadhivipareet chikitsa kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he, jaise atisar ke veg ko rokane ke liye stambhan aushadhi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he parantu mahatvapurn baat yah he ki uskaa koi hanikaarak said effect nahin hota
 Allopathy would have been acceptable even if it was only symptomatic treatment, but it is harmful and harmful, so it is destructive and Ayurveda does not consider such a side effect therapy as 'medicine'
 rog kii ati praarambhik avasthaa se lekar rog ke purna rup se pragat hone tak, rog ke kriyaakaal kii chah avasthaayen hoti hai- Accumulation of doshas, outbreaks, pranks and location contamination are the complete condition of diseases
 abhivyakti main rog ke lakshan utpann ho jate hai or rog prakat ho jaataa he
 Distinction is a chronic state of disease
 arthath dosha kaa sanchay, prakope, prasar, sthansanshray, vyakti or bhed ko jo jaanata he vahi yatharth vaidya he
 Tridosha imbalance is diagnosed at the earliest stage of the disease by following measures, without any blood test or X-ray, etc
 The disease is diagnosed by pulse test, stool, urine, eye, tongue, tone, touch and shape test
 yathasambhav purv-purv avasthaaon main hi chikitsa karne ko uttam mana jaataa he kyonki yadi sanchay 
 If treatment is done within the period, then the defect will not progress nor will disease arise
 maahi ek jat gotra he
