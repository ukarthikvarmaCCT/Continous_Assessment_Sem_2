 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke haripur adhiveshan main buniyadi rashtriya shiksha yojana kii sweekruti ke baad san 1938 se hi buniyadi shiksha main anek prayog aarambh ho gaye the kintu ve alag alag or simit str par kiye gaye
 The Second World War broke out in 1939, when another difficulty was present
 congress mantrimandal ko raajnneetik kaarnon se istipha dena padaa
 They were expected to be instrumental in the development of basic education
 kintu unke istife ke parinamswaroop, kuch praanton main prayog bilkul band kar die gaye or anya praanton main prayog ke prati udaseenta dikhaai dene lagi
 Only after independence, basic education was seriously accepted as the national method of education
 buniyadi shiksha nirantar pragati karti rahi he kyonki basic skulon kii sankhya baraabar badhati rahi he
 But there has been a decrease in the growth rate of the number of basic schools compared to ordinary elementary and middle schools
 basic skulon main pravesh kaa jahaan tak sambandh he sthiti santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 The goal was to provide basic education for all boys and girls in the age group of 6 to 14 years in basic education
 kintu pratham do yojanaon main koi mahatvapurn pragati is shiksha main nahin hui
 During this period, the progress of the spread of basic education was not as much as that of the promotion of ordinary elementary education, although the progress of simple elementary education is also not satisfactory
 adhyaaapak shikshan kii sthiti bhi bilkul santoshjanak nahin he
 The 1960 AD report of the First National Seminar on the Education of Elementary Teachers in India and the recent 1963 AD report of the Committee on Plan Projects regarding Teacher Training proves that there are many errors in the teacher training program
 isamen na keval uchit evam yogya karmchaariyon, bhawanon, upkarnon or anya sthool sadhano kii kami rahi he balki aparyaapt paathya vishay or shikshan kii prabhaavaheen vidhi tathaa style kaa bhi dosha rahaa he
 There is no clear definition of basic education by which people generally agree
 buniyadi shiksha ke vaastavik mul tatv evam nishchit lakshya ke sambandh main bahut hi gadabadi dikhaai detii he
 Gandhiji envisaged a certain social order while formulating the principles of basic education
 vah utpaadak kaary ko shiksha kaa centre maanate the kintu vaastavik prayog main utpaadak kaary dwaara shiksha ke siddhant ke bhinn bhinn arth ho gaye hai
 Some academics, who claim to be followers of Gandhiji, insist on the actual production of usable goods in schools
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki iskaa arth khel vidhi dwaara shiksha ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 The question of self-sufficiency in basic education is even more controversial
 gandhi ji aatmanirbharta ko shiksha kaa vaastavik maapdand samajhate the
 By self-sufficiency, he meant that basic schools should be self-sufficient to the extent that teachers' salaries could be paid by selling goods produced by children in schools
 isliye aarambh main buniyadi shiksha ke samarthakon kaa bahut bada varg is baat kii aashaa karne laga ki yadi buniyadi shiksha ke liye samuchit vaataavaran paidaa kiya jaae to iskaa adhik maatra main kharch nikal jayega or avshesh kharch sarkaar de degi jisase basic skool dakshatapurvak chal sakenge
 But from experience this conjecture proved to be wrong
 bharat sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay dwaara niyukt pieres-lakhni samiti ne is samasya kaa adhyayan kiya or bataaya ki 1950-1951 main bihar main, jo buniyadi shiksha kaa pramukh pradesh samajha jaataa tha, koi bhi vidhyalay 41
09 pratishat se adhik swaavlambee nahin tha
 The basic school of Sevagram, which was under the guidance and supervision of Hindustani Talimi Sangh, was self-supporting by 63 percent
 isanan is disha main basic vidyalayon kii suchi main sarvapratham sthaan praapt karne kaa gaurav praapt kiya tha
 In the year 1949-1950, 100 basic schools of Bihar state, including 18 senior basic schools, were able to be self-supporting only 15 percent
 tab se saadhaaran taur se, paristhiti main achchhai kii ore koi parivartan nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The evaluation committee appointed by the Government of India at the end of the first five-year plan for basic education also reached the same conclusion
 bharat sarkaar ne 'buniyadi shiksha kii sankalpana' sheershak pustika main swaavlamban kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya
 Even Vinoba Bhave, the great nutrient of the ideals of Gandhism, now has the idea that the benefit of the sale of the goods produced by children should not be used to reduce the reasonable expenditure on education, but it should be given to the parents by which they should get their To compensate for the loss caused by not being able to benefit from the help of your children at work
 aisa lagata he, sarkaar bhi siddhant rup se yah sweekaar karti he ki bacchon ke utpaadak kaaryan se praapt laabh unheen ke hit main kharch kiya jaae, jaise vidhyalay ke paridhaan yaa madhyanh ke bhojan ke prabandh par
 Therefore, it can be concluded that as per Gandhi's imagination, the cost of basic education cannot be reduced to a large extent by starting productive businesses in basic schools
 isliye buniyadi shiksha ko yadi desh bhar main praarambhik shiksha kii saarvbhaum paddati bananaa ho to iske liye prachur maatra main badhaai gai arthvyavastha aavashyak he
 The question of making basic education universal should be considered at the level of reality
 bharat ne samaajawaadee adarshavaale samaaj kii sthapana kaa sankalp kiya he
 One of the essentials of such a society is that all its members are well-educated so that they can contribute more and more to the common interest and properly benefit from the fruits of their combined efforts
 isliye kam se kam samay ke andar saarvbhaum, ni:shulk or anivaary shikshapradaan kaa prabandh sabase pehle hona chahie
 According to the 45th section of the constitution, by 1960 AD, the free and compulsory education of all children in the age of 14 years should have been arranged by the state
 yah ek vishaal samasya he or iske samaadhaan ke liye maanviya or bhautik donon prakaar ke mahan sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is estimated that if the country spends only two percent of its national income on elementary education, the necessary resources can be obtained in such a quantity that all the children of 14 years of age can get education facilities from 1980 to 1981
 ab yadi buniyadi shiksha sabhi bacchon ko di jaae to saarvbhaum shiksha ke str tak pahunchne main bahut adhik samay lagegaa
 Basic education is more expensive due to its high quality
 buniyadi shiksha kii rashtriya samiti dwaara niyukt sahaayak samiti kii siforeeshon se spasht he ki ek saadhaaran praarambhik vidhyalay ko basic skool main parivartit karne main kam se kam jitne sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue praarambhik shiksha ke saath saath hi buniyadi shiksha kaa vikaas hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The need is that a visionary plan should be made according to which the expansion of basic education should be equal so that in the end it will develop into an improved method of elementary education at the national level
 kuch baaten jinke karne kii aavashyaktaa he, neeche prastaavit kii jaati hai : Basic schools working on traditional principles should be made true basic schools, at least fulfilling the mandatory conditions
 jin vidyalayon kaa purna vikaas nahin ho sakaa he unako adhik se adhik sahaayta deni chahie taaki ve adarsh basic skool ban saken or duusare unka anukaran karen
 Continue to expand the expansion of basic education
 saadhaaran vidyalayon ko basic skulon main badalen or nae basic skool kholen
 Most states may increase the number of basic schools by at least 5 percent per year
 basic skulon ke liye udyog chunate samay yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki udyog shaksha kii drushti se samrudh hon tathaa saamaajik vaataavaran or bacchon kii avasthaa ke anukool hon
 To prevent waste of raw materials, industry related work should not be done in the following categories of basic schools till the children are mature enough that they can use it profitably
 mitti kaa kaam, praarambhik bagwani yaa kuch kam kharchavaale haath ke kaam neeche kii kakshaon main karaae ja sakate hai
 There is a need to make changes in the curriculum of basic education on this basis
 sabhi praarambhik vidyalayon main buniyadi shiksha ke kuch tatv saraltapurvak apanaae ja sakate hai, jaise swasthya sambandhi kriyaayein, saamaajik seva ke kaarykram, saanskrithik kaaryaklap ityadi
 a school that has sufficient land and adequate irrigation facilities can undertake the production of fruits and vegetables
 yah aavashyak he ki jin vidyalayon main ye kriyaayein aarambh kii jaaen, unka bhalee bhanti niyojan kiya jaae or saath hi, unase puraa puraa shaikshik laabh uthaaya jaae
 Answer: The basic school should be considered as a branch of the multipurpose higher secondary school where emphasis should be placed on qualifying in the industry which a student has been pursuing from the basic school
 1957 main central adwiseri board ov ajukeshan kii raay se kendriya shiksha mantralay dwaara is maamle main savistaar adhyayan ke liye niyukt kii gai samiti ne uttar buniyadi shiksha ke desh kii prachlit madhyamik shiksha paddati kaa ek ang bane rahane par jor diya he
 In order to run the basic educational plan of the basic school, it is necessary that teachers have a high educational background and are proficient in their work
 praarambhik vidyalayon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karanevaali sabhi prashikshan sasthayen basic dhang kii honi chahie
 An ideal training school should be established in every district of each state
 is prashikshan vidhyalay ke saath chaar paanch basic skool sanlagn hone chahie
 This center should have adequate teachers and equipment and the entire program of basic education should be completed by this
 yah ek prashikshan ke bahugrahi mahavidhyalay kaa abhinn ang ho jisamen kai prashikshan sansthaayen hon jo shiksha ke sabhi staron evam vidhyalay ke kaarykram kii bhinn bhinn shakhaon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karen
 In 1938, the basic plan of basic education was prepared by the Zakir Hussain Committee
 isamen yah sifarish kii gai thi ki prayek praant main shiksha kii ek samiti sthapit honi chahie jiske kaaryon main buniyadi shiksha main khoj or sanghathan kaa kaary bhi sammilit kiya jaae
 The state institution of education established in each state should study and research various problems of basic education
 rashtriya shaikshanik anusandhan or prashikshan parishad ko rashtriya str ke mahatv vaali samasyaon kaa anusandhan karnaa chahie
 The research should make the methodology comprehensible and accessible to the teacher
 buniyadi shiksha sambandhi kuch aisi mukhya samasyaayen hai jinhen sulajhane ke liye sheeghra dhyaan diya janaa aavashyak he, jaise ek hi shikshak dwaara anek kakshaon ke padhaane kii samasya, aisi kakshaon ko padhaane kii samasya, jinamein bacchon kii sankhya bahut adhik ho, bhinn bhinn udyogon kii shaikshik sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa lagane or unki paddati tathaa utpaadan kshamta kaa vikaas karnaa jinke dwaara jaanch kii ja sake ki kahan tak buniyadi shiksha kii pragati uske uddeshyon ke anusaar ho rahi he taaki in vidhiyon or upkarnon se buniyadi shiksha ke adhyak evam prashaasak aavashyaktaanusaar laabh uthaa sake, basic skulon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karanevaali prashikshan sansthaaon kii samasyaon kii ore dhyaan dena taaki prashikshan kaarykram ko prabhaavshaalee banaaya ja sake or chatradhyaapakon ke liye upyukt sahitya kii taiyaari par dhyaan dena ityadi

 Then King Jai Singh, after consulting with many great priests, made the idol Uttarabhim-oriented as per his advice, so that no other disturbance was present in the construction of Jaipur, because the sight of the idol was reading diagonally
 tab is murti ko vartmaan garbhagrih main pratishthit karavaaya gaya he, jo uttarabhimukhi he
 This idol is made of black stone and is built on a rock

 The reason for this is that after killing Bhairav, in his last wish, he had asked for a boon from his mother that after your darshan, devotees should also worship me so that people will remember the name of Bhairav along with mother's name and mother gave this wish of Bhairava He was granted this blessing after completing it

 He was successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in 1914
 san 1912 main rus or france main yah samjhauta ho gaya ki yadi balcon prayadweep ke prashn par germany athwa austria rus se yuddh karenge to france rus ke saath rahegaa
 After assuring French aid, Russia began to intervene in the Balkan peninsula
 rus ke uksaane par chaar balcon rajyon ne milakar san 1912 main gupt rup se ek samjhauta kiya
 These states were Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Servia
 is samay turki nirbal ho gaya tha or vahaan aantarik ashaanti faili hui thi
 The objective of the agreement of the Balkan states was to end their rule in Europe by fighting with Turkey, then to divide the territories they had conquered
 mysidonia par in rajyon kii lolup drushti vishesh rup se thi
 Therefore, it was also made clear in this agreement how the territories of Macedonia would be divided after the defeat of Turkey
 yah nishchit ho gaya tha ki mysidonia kaa pramukh bhaag balgeria ko diya jayega tathaa albania, servia ko de diya jayega
 After this agreement was reached, the Balkan states declared war on Turkey on 17 October 1912 with an excuse
 in rajyon kaa kahana tha ki mysidonia main isaayiyon ke saath bada krur atyaachaar ho rahaa he
 Therefore, they want to free Macedonia from the despicable regime of Turkey
 unhone turki se mysidonia main sudhaar karne ko kaha par turki ke inkaar karne par yuddh prarambh ho gaya
 The Turkish army was badly defeated and the Balkan states were an unlikely success
 motinigro tathaa servia kii senaaon ne albania par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Greek forces snatched the famous fortification of Adrienople from the Turks

 The terms of the treaty of the Balkan states were very expensive for Turkey

 On this, Turks again waged war under the leadership of Tarun Turk Dal

 Desperate, the Sultan of Turkey proposed the treaty
 ek baar pun: donon pakshon ke pratinidhi 1913 main sandhi karne ke liye landan main ekatrit hue
 The Treaty of London was signed on 30 May 1913, which ended the First Balkan War
 turki ko kreet tathaa anya europea kshetron se vanchit kar diya gaya or automan samrajya keval constantinopel tathaa uske aasapaas ke kuch bhaag tak hi simit rah gaya
 But there was a difference of opinion among the Balkan states regarding the partition of the territories thus snatched
 yah kahana jaraa kathin he ki dwitiya balcon yuddh kaa uttardaayitv kis par tha
 There is no doubt that big countries like Austria and Italy were involved in this war
 balcon yudhon se purv jo samjhauta hua tha uske anusaar srbija ko albania mil janaa chahie tha
 But Austria did not want to let Albania be held under Serbia at any cost
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki bosnia tathaa harzegovina kii aabaadi mukhya: yugoslav tathaa sarbon kii thi
 Together with Serbia, these regions wanted to build a powerful Yugoslav state
 yadi aisa ho jaataa to srbija kii shakti bad jaati jo austria ke liye ahitkar thi
 Then, gaining authority over Albania would have reached Serbia to the Adriatic
 vastav main austria kii drushti swayan albania ko ek pruthak rajya ghoshit karvaa diya
 As a result of Albania's isolation, the partition of Macedonia began to seem even more difficult
 ab srbija ne yah ichha prakat kii ki albania na milane par use mysidonia main adhik bhaag milanaa chahie
 But Serbia and Balgeria could not agree mutually in this regard
 jab yah maamla shantipurvak na sulajh sakaa tab donon shaktiyon ne balaprayog karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 29 June 1913, Balgeria waged a war against Serbia
 is yuddh ko dwitiya balcon yuddh kii sangya di jaati he
 In this war, Greece, Roumania and Montenegro supported Serbia against Balgeria
 apane khoe hue pradeshon kaa kuch bhaag mil jane kii aashaa main turki ne bhi balgeria ke viruddh balcon rajyon kii sahaayta kii
 Forced, Balgeria prayed for the treaty

 This treaty led to great defamation of Balgairia
 sandhi ke dwaara srbija tathaa mantinigro ne bahut se pradesh praapt kiye
 Greece also gained authority over the territory of Salonika
 is vibhaajan ke baad mysidonia kaa bachaa hua bhaag hi balgeria ko mil sakaa
 Thus the Second Balkan War ended
 bucharesti kii sandhi dwaara balcon rajyon main kuch samay ke liye shanti sthapit ho gai
 Serbia and Greece benefited most as a result of the Balkan Wars
 in yudhon kaa ek bada parinaam yah hua ki europe main turki samrajya lagbhag samaapt ho gaya or balcon prayadweep main isai rajyon kaa parivardhan prarambh ho gaya
 It would be unfair to say that the above mentioned wars calmed the Balkan problem
 dwitiya balcon yuddh ke dwaara balcon rajyon main rashtriya pratispardhaa utpann ho gai jiskaa visphotak parinaam tha pratham mahayuddh
 The Second Balkan War ended with the Treaty of Bucharest
 balgaria ne yah sandhi greece, srbija, romania or turki ke saath kii
 The following things were decided in this treaty - iske mukhya parinaam nimnlikhit hue- These wars led to the destruction of the European states of Turkey

 Among all these states, Serbia and Greece received the most benefits
 inke rajya pehle se dugune ho gaye
 The kingdom of Montenegro already doubled
 romania kaa bhi vistaar hua
 Bulgaria gained the least in these wars, although it participated the most in these wars and suffered great losses in its wealth and mass
 yadhyapi in yudhon ke dwaara isai praja ko turki ke samrajya se mukti mil gai thi, kintu in yudhon ke kaaran in rajyon kii shakti main bada vistaar hua or unamem parsparik irshyaa or dwesh main bahut adhik vruddhi hui
 Bulgaria began to see envy and envy of other states
 srbija, austria se bada asantusht ho gaya, kyonki uske kaaran hi albania ke naye rajya kaa nirmaan hua jisase vah adriatic sagar se dur ho gaya
 Austria was also angry with Serbia, because its expansion hindered its path to reach the Aegean Sea
 austria ko greece va romania se bhi asantosh tha
 Germany also considered Serbia as its enemy because it hindered the way for Germany to reach Kustuntunia

 Mithila was a kingdom in ancient India
 mana jaataa he ki yah vartmaan uttari bihar or nepal kii tarai kaa ilaaka he jise mithila ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The folklore of Mithila has been going on for many centuries, which is known for its intellectual tradition outside India and India
 is kshetra kii pramukh bhashaa maithili he
 In Hindu religious texts, the first indication of this is found in Shatapatha Brahmin and explicit mention in Valmiki Ramayana
 mithila kaa ullekh mahabharat, ramayana, puraana tathaa jain evam buddha granthon main hua he
 According to mythological references, Mithila is the most ancient name of this region; Also it has been addressed by the name Videha
 tirbhukti naam praapt ullekhon ke anusaar apekshaakrit kaaphi baad kaa siddh hota he
 The most ancient connection of naming Videha and Mithila connects with Videha Mathava mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana
 mithila ke basane ke aarambhik samay kaa sanket ukt katha main praapt hota he
 Videgh Mathava and his priest Gautam Rahugan walked east from the arrow of the river Saraswati
 unke aage-aage agni vaishwanar nadiyon kaa jal sukhaate hue chal rahe the
 Agni could not dry the Sadanira river and on being asked by Videgh Mathava where my residence is now, Agni replied that you live on the east side of this river
 shatapath brahman main spasht roopen ullikhit he ki pehle brahman log is nadi ko paar nahin karte the tathaa yahan kii bhoomi upjau nahin thi
 There was a lot of swamp in it because Agni Vishwanar did not taste it
 parantu ab yah bahut upjau he kyonki brahmanon ne yajna karke uskaa aswadan agni ko kara diya he
 It is also mentioned about the Gandaki river that in the later days of summer, that is, during the summer months, this river flows a lot
 is videgh shabd se videh kaa tathaa maathav shabd se mithila kaa sambandh prathit hota he
 In the Shatapath itself, the word Videha is also mentioned explicitly, referring to the Gandaki River
 vahaan kaha gaya he ki ab tak yah nadi kosal or vidah deshon ke bich kii seemaa he; tathaa is bhoomi ko maathav kii santan kaha gaya he
 In Valmiki Ramayana and various Puranas, the name Mithila has been associated with Mithi, son of King Nimi
 newnaadhik antaron ke saath in granthon main ek katha sarvatra praapt he ki nimi ke mrit sharir ke manthan se mithi kaa janm hua tha
 Valmiki Ramayana mentions the descendants of Mithi as Maithil, while in the mythological texts, it is clearly said that Mithila was settled by Mithi
 shabdaantaron se yah baat anek granthon main kahi gayi he ki swatah janm lene ke kaaran unka naam janak hua, videh pita se utpann hone ke kaaran ve vaideh kahalaaye tathaa manthan se utpann hone ke kaaran unka naam mithi hua
 Thus, the name of the state ruled by him has been considered Videha and Mithila
 mahabharat main pradesh kaa naam 'mithila' tathaa iske shaskaon ko 'videhavansheey' kaha gaya he
 Both Mithila and arrowheads have been called in the mithila-mahatmya of the Brihadvishnupurana
 mithi ke naam se mithila tathaa anek nadiyon ke tir par sthit hone se tiron main bhoga hone se tirbhukti naam maane gayi hai
 In this book, the position of the main 15 rivers in Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been considered and their names have also been counted
 mithila kaa mahatmaya batalaate hue vrihadvishnu puraana ke mithila-mahatmaya khand main kaha gaya he ki ganga se himalay ke bich 15 nadiyon se yukt param pavitra tirbhukti he
 This arrowhead is Mithila Sita's Nimikanan, the field of knowledge and the back of grace
 janaki ki yah janmabhumi mithila nishpapa or nirpeksha he
 It is pleasing to Rama and Mangaladayini
 prayag aadi tirth lokon main punya dene vaali he parantu ram kii prapti karwaane main samarth nahin he; parantu yah mithila sab prakaar se nishchit rup se ram ko tusht karne vaali hone se vishesh he
 Just as Saket is a form due to the city of the world, similarly Mithila is the cause of all bliss
 isliye maharshigan samast parigrahon ko chhodkar ram kii aradhana ke liye prayatnpurvak yaheen nivas karte hai
 Dev-powers like Srisavitri and Srigauri took this birth
 swayan sarveshvareshvari shrisita ji kii janmabhumi yah mithila ytnpurvak vaas karne se samast siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 In the Mahabharata, the position of Mithila has been considered after Magadha
 shrikrishna, arjuna tathaa bhim kii magadh-yatra kaa varnan karte hue pehle sarayu nadi paar karke purvi koshal pradesh tathaa phir mahashon, gandki tathaa sadanira ko paar karke mithila main jane kaa ullekh hua he
 It is said that once again crossing the Ganges and the Mahashon to Magadha
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki us samay magadh ke uttar main mithila kii hi sthiti maani gayi he
 The kingdom of Vajji was included only under Mithila
 mahabharat ke is ullekh main bhi mithila ke seemaa kshetra ke bare main anyatra ullikhit pashchim main gandaki tathaa dakshin main ganga tak ke kshetra yathavat sanketit hote hai
 Mentioning the boundary of Mithila in the Brihadvishnupurana clearly states that- arthath purv main kosi se aarambh hokar pashchim main gandaki tak 24 yojan tathaa dakshin main ganga nadi se aarambh hokar uttar main himalay van tak 16 yojan mithila kaa vistaar he
 Mahakavi Chanda Jha has written the above mentioned verses as Maithili, while explaining the extent of Mithila
 is prakaar ullikhit seemaa ke antargat vartmaan main nepal ke tarai pradesh ke saath bihar rajya ke pashchimi champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, sitamarhi, mujffarpur, vaishali, samastipur, begusarai, darbhanga, madhubani, supaul, madhepura, saharsa, or khagadiya jile kaa praayah puraa bhubhag tathaa bhagalpur jile kaa aanshik bhubhag aata he
 This range is according to ancient mentions, possibly due to the immense fame and uncontrolled spread of Kosi, the eastern border has been considered as Kosi
 band banane se purv kosi kaa koi niyat maarg nahin rahaa he

 atah mahananda nadi se pashchim arthath pashchim bengal aarambh hone se pehle kaa puraa purvi bihar mithilanchal kaa hi swaabhaavik bhaag rahaa he
 The state of the 15 major rivers under Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been reported in the Vriddhivasupurana
 unke naam is prakaar hai:- These are the names of the relatively larger rivers then; But in addition to these, many small rivers in Mithilanchal flow continuously from ancient times till today and are making the name of 'mithila' arrowhead
 shriram-sita se sambandhit vishesh sthaan hone ke atirikt mithila devadhidev mahadev ke pujan-sthal ke rup main vishesh prasiddh rahi he
 According to the great Vishnupuran, the names of the major Shivalingas herein are as follows: - mithila parikrama ke kram main simavarti shivlingon kaa ullekh karte hue singheshwar mahadev tathaa kameshwar ling kaa naam atyadhik shraddha purvak liya gaya he
 Thus the names of the eleventh Shivlingas are enumerated here
 purv main singheshwar mahadev ko pranaam kar parikrama aarambh karne tathaa punah ghumkar singheshwar mahadev ke paas pahunchakar niyam-vidhi purna karke hi ghar jane kii baat kahi gayi he
