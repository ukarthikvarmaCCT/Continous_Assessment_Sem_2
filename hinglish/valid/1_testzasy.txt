 Mahavat Khan was a mansabdar and courtier of the Mughal state
 mahavat khan kaa prabhaav tab badhane laga jab parvaiz or mahavat khan ne khurramako unhone parajeet kiya tha,isse noorjehan chintit ho gai or uskaa prabhaav samaapt karne ke liye use bengal kaa soobedaar bana kar bengal bhej diya
 Apart from this, Nur Jahan made many allegations against him for insulting the Mahavat and demanded the accounts of the elephants from Bengal and Bihar and the income and expenditure of the province
 noorjehan ne aarope lagaaya ki mahavat khan ne samraat kii ajna ke bina hi apni putree kii shaadi khwaja umr nakshabandi ke putr se kar di he,is par us yuvak ko apamaanit kar jail main daal diya tathaa wo sara dhan va vasteen us yuvak se jabt kar lee thi jo mahavat khan ne use di thi
 Mahawat Khan was very sad due to this
 ant march 1625 isvi mahavat khan apane chune hue 4-5 hazaar raaj put sainiko ko lekar jahangir ke shivi ke paas panhucha
 At that time Jahangir was returning from Kashmir and going to Kabul
 mahavat ne jahangir ko saralata se bandi bana liya or noorjehan ko bhi bandi bana liya
 Nur Jahan, with his wisdom, broke the army of Mahavat Khan and freed Jahangir and himself
 mahavat khan dakshin main bhaag gaya or khurram ke sarankshan main rahane laga
 Template: Redirect-acronym oxford uniwarsity press duniya kii sabase badi vishvavidhyalay press he
 It is a department of the University of Oxford and is run by a group of 15 academics appointed by the Vice Chancellor, known as the Press Representative
 unka netritv pratinidhiyon ke sachiv dwaara kiya jaataa he jo oupi ke mukhya kaaryakari or anya vishvavidhyalay nikaayon ke pramukh pratinidhi kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The University of Oxford has been using a similar system to oversee the press since the seventeenth century
 vishvavidhyalay ne 1480 ke aasapaas mudran vyapaar main kadam rakhaa or bible, prarthana pustakon or adhyayansheel rachanaaon kaa pramukh mudrak ban gaya
 a project initiated by its press became the Oxford English Dictionary in the late nineteenth century and continued its expansion to cope with rising costs
 natijatan apane shaikshanik or dharmik sheershakon se mail sthapit karne ke liye oxford ne pichley sau saalon main bacchon kii pustakon, skool kii paathya pustakon, sangeet, patrikaon, varlds clasix siries or sabase zyada bikne vaali angreji bhashaa shikshan paathya pustakon kaa prakaashan kiya he
 Beginning in New York in 1896 as a result of its foray into the international market, the press began to open its offices outside the United Kingdom
 computer praudyogiki ke aagaman or uttarottar badhati vyapaarik dashaon kii vajah se 1989 main oxford main sthit press ke chhapekhane ko band kar diya gaya or volverkot main sthit uski purv kagaz kii mil ko 2004 main dhwast kar diya gaya
 The modern press publishes around 6000 new titles every year by contracting its printing and binding work and has about 4000 employees worldwide
 ek dharmarth sanghathan ke hisse ke rup main oupi apane mul vishvavidhyalay ko adhik se adhik vittiya sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye or iske alaava apni prakaashan gatividhiyon ke madhyam se chaatravrutti, anusandhan or shiksha main behtareen pradarshan karne main vishvavidhyalay ke lakshyon ko puraa karne main uski sahaayta karne ke liye patibaddh he
 The OUP was first exempted from US corporation tax in 1972 and then by UK corporation tax in 1978
 ek dharmarth sanghathan kaa ek vibhaag hone ke naate oupi ko adhikansh deshon main iskar or nigam kar se mukt kar diya gaya he lekin ise apane utpaadon par bikri or anya vanijyik karon kaa bhugtan karnaa padataa he
 With a pledge to transfer at least £ 12 million per year, this press currently transfers 30% of its annual surplus to the remaining parts of the university

 OUP publishes a range of reference, professional and academic works, including the Oxford English Dictionary, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, the Oxford World's Classics, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and the Concise Dictionary of National Biography
 iske kai sabase mahatvapurn sheershak ab "oxford reference online" naamak ek package ke rup main internet par uplabdh he or inhen euke kii kai saarvajanik pustakaalayon ke pathak card dharakon ko muft main pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Books published by Oxford contain International Standard Book Numbers starting at 0–19 which makes the press one of several small publishers with a two-digit identification number in the ISBN system
 aatanrik samjhaute dwaara vyaktigat sanskaran sankhya kaa pehla ank ek vishesh prabhag kaa sanket de saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye: sangeet ke liye 3 ; neuyork karyaalay ke liye 5; cleyarendon press prakashnon ke liye 8
 The first printer associated with Oxford University was Theoderic Rude
 wiliam kakston ke ek vyavsaayik sahyogi rud sambhawatah ek nae udhyam ke rup main apni lakdi kii printing press ko colon se oxford lekar aaye the or lagbhag 1480 or 1483 ke bich shahar main kaam kiya tha
 In 1478, the first book printed in Oxford, a version of Rufinus's Expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum, was printed by another anonymous printer
 yah baat sab ko maaloom he ki ise roman ankon main galati se "1468" ke rup main dinaankit kiya gaya tha jo jaahir taur par kakston se pehle kaa samay he
 Rood's printing included John Ankyville's compendium Totius grammatica that set new standards for the study of Latin grammar
 rud ke baad vishvavidhyalay se judi chapai lagbhag aadhi sadi tak chhitput rup main hoti rahi
 Records or lively works are simply a few numbered forms, and the printing of Oxford did not gain a strong foothold until the 1580s: it followed the efforts of the University of Cambridge which licensed its press in 1534
 crown or stationurs company dwaara landan ke baahar chapai karne par lagaai gai baadhyataaon ke pratikriyasvarup oxford ne vishvavidhyalay main press chalaane kaa aupchaarik adhikaar praapt karne ke liye elizabeth pratham se yachana kii
 Chancellor Robert Doodley, Earl of Leicester, advocated the Oxford case
 printer joseph barns dwaara kaam shuru karne ke baad se kuch shahi anumati praapt kii gai or star chembar ke hukmanaame main 1586 main "uniwarsity of oxford" main press ke kanoonee vajood kaa ullekh kiya gaya
 The Chancellor of Oxford, Archbishop William Laud, consolidated the legal status of university printing in the 1630s
 laud ne ek vishwastareey ekikrut press kii pariklpana kii
 Oxford will establish it on university property, control its operations, appoint its staff, determine its printing work, and take advantage of the proceeds from it
 To this end, he petitioned Charles i for the rights with which Oxford would be able to compete with the Stationers' Company and the King's Printer, and received a succession of royal grants to aid it
 in sabkon 1636 main oxford ke "great charter" main shaamil kiya gaya jiske tahat vishvavidhyalay ko "har tarah kii kitaaben" chhapane kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Laud also received from the Crown the "privilege" of printing the King James or Authorized Version of Scripture at Oxford
 is "visheshadhikaar" se agle 250 saalon main kaaphi pratifal praapt hua haalanki shuru main yah prasuptavastha main tha
 The Stationers' Company was deeply concerned with the threat of its trade and wasted some of its time in establishing a "tolerance rule" with Oxford
 iske tahat stationurs ne vishvavidhyalay ko apane sampoorn mudran adhikaron kaa istemaal na karne ke liye ek vaarshik kiraye kaa bhugtan kiya - oxford ne un paison kaa istemaal chote prayojanon ke liye nae mudran upkaran kharidne ke liye kiya
 Laud also developed the internal organization of the press
 pratinidhi pranali kii sthapana karne ke alaava unhone "arqitypographes" naamak ek vyapak or vistrut paryvekshi pad kaa bhi nirmaan kiya: is shikshavid par chhapekhane ke prabandhan se lekar prufreeding tak vyavsaay se sambandhit prayek kaary kii dekharekh karne kii jimmedaari thi
 The post was largely an ideal rather than a practical reality but continued to exist in the loosely structured press until the eighteenth century
 vyaavhaarik drushti se oxford kaa warehouse-keeper hi bikri, lekhankan or chhapekhane ke karmchaariyon ko kaam par rakhane or unhen kaam par se nikaalane kaa kaam karata tha
 However, Laud's plans hit deep at both personal and political odds
 raajnneetik sajeesh main beyimaani kii vajah se 1645 main unhen maar daalaa gaya jis samay tak agrezi grihayuddh chhid chukaa tha
 Oxford became a stronghold of royalists during the conflict and many of the city's printers began to focus on political propaganda or the creation of sermons
 is dauraan kuch utkrisht ganitiya or praachya vidya vishaarad rachanaaen saamne ai jinamein hebrew ke rejius profesar edward pokoke dwaara sampadit pustaken ullekhneey hai lekin 1660 main rajshahi kii bahaali se pehle laud ke model vaala ek bhi vishvavidhyalay press sambhav nahin tha
 It was eventually founded by vice-chancellor John Fell, President of Christ Church, Bishop of Oxford and Representative Secretary
 fail laud ko ek shahid maanate the or unhone press se jude unke sapane ko sammaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Using the provisions of the Great Charter, Fell persuaded Oxford to refuse to accept any further payments from the stationers and established the functioning of all university printers in a set of campuses
 is vyavsaay ko nae sheldonian theatre ke tahkhaanon main sthapit kiya gaya jahaan fail ne 1668 main printing presun ko adhishthapit kiya or ise vishvavidhyalay kaa pehla kendriya chhapaakhana banaaya
 When Fell took over a large stock of typographical punches and matrices from Holland, a type foundry was added here named "fell Typees"
 He also persuaded two Dutch typefounders Herman Hermanz and Peter de Valpurgen to work in Oxford for the press
 ant main stationurs kii maaghon ko nakaarte hue fail ne vyaktigat rup se brasenoj ke principal thomas yet or jisas college ke principal sar leoline jenkins ke saath partnership karke 1672 main vishvavidhyalay ke chapai ke adhikaar ko patte par de diya
 Fell's plan was ambitious
 shaikshik or dharmik kaary sambandhi yojanaon ke alaava 1674 main unhone ek broadshit calendar ko chhapana shuru kiya jise oxford almanak ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Initial editions reflected the symbolic ideas of Oxford, but paved the way for realistic study of the city or university in 1766
 almanak ko fail ke samay se aaj tak bina kisi rukawat ke lagaataar har saal chapa jaataa he
 After the beginning of this work, Fell began the first formal program for university printing
 1675 se is dastavej ne saikadon rachanaaon kii pariklpana kii jisamen unani main bible, coptic gospells ke sanskaran or carch fadars kii rachanaaen, arabi or siriyak main paathya pustaken, shastreey darshan ke vyapak sanskaran, kavita, ganit, dher sari madhyayugin chaatravritiyaan or "ab tak prachlit anya kisi bhi rachana se adhik paripurna keedon kaa ek itihaas" bhi shaamil he
 Although some of these proposed titles were seen in Fell's lifetime, the printing of the Bible was the first on his mind
 scripchar kaa sampoorn bhinnrup unani paathya pustak asambhav sabit hua lekin 1675 main oxford ne fail ke shabdic parivartanon or vartanee ke saath aath prishthon vaale ek king james sanskaran ko mudrit kiya
 This work increased conflict with the Stationers Company
 javaabi karrwai main fail ne teen dusht stationurs moses pit, peter parker or thomas gaai ko vishvavidhyalay ke bible ko chhapane kaa kaam patte par de diya jinaki tikshn vanijyik pravritiyaan oxford ke bible vyapaar ko uttejit karne main kaaphi mahatvapurn sabit hui
 His involvement, however, led to a long legal battle between Oxford and the Stationers, and the litigation continued for the remainder of Fell's life
 1686 main unka dehanth ho gaya
 Yate and Jenkins had died before Fell, leaving no clear heir to oversee the raid after his death
 natijatan unki vasiyat ke anusaar trust main bhagidaaron kaa stock or patta oxford vishvavidhyalay ke liye chhod diya gaya or un par ek saath "mere press kii sansthaapak samagriyon" kaa bhaar daal diya gaya
 Fell's chief trustee was Delegate Henry Aldrich, Dean of Christ Church who took a keen interest in the decorative work of Oxford's books
 unhone or unke sahyogiyon ne parker or gaai ke patte ke ant or 1691 main ek nae samjhaute kii adhyakshata kii jiske dwaara stationurs ne apane na bike hue adhyayansheel stock sahit oxford ke sampoorn mudran visheshadhikaar ko patte par de diya
 This ended the friction between Oxford and the Stationers, despite the violent opposition from some of the Sheldonian printers, and effectively led to a stable university printing business
 1713 main eldrich ne cleyarendon bhawan main press ke sthanantaran kaa prabandh kiya
 It was named in honor of the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Edward Hyde, First Earl of Clarendon
 oxford vidya dwaara banaae rakhe jane vaale iske nirmaan kaary kaa vittaposhan unki pustak *da history of da rebelion and civil wars in england se praapt raashiyon se kiya gaya
 In fact, most of the money came from Oxford's new Bible printer John Baskett, and vice-chancellor William Dallon did not pay much of the proceeds from Clarendon's work
 kisi bhi paristhiti main iskaa vparinaam broad street main sheldonian ke alaava nicholas hoxmoor kii sundar lekin avyaavhaarik sanrachana thi
 The press worked here until 1830 and its functions were divided into different parts of the building between the so-called Learned Side and the Bible Side
 aam taur par kaha jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke armbh main press ke vistaar par viraam lag gaya tha
 This time there was a lack of a celebrity like Fell and it was the time of ineffectual or quarrelsome people like Archetypographus and the archivist Thomas Hieron, and the first Bible-like flawed plans of the basket which was a brilliantly crafted but misprinted section and called St
 The wine became known as the Bible after Luke noticed a typing error
 is samay ke anya mudran main richard olestery ke manansheel granth or thomas hanmar ke shakespeare kaa chah khandon vaala sanskaran shaamil tha
 Looking back, it all proved to be a relatively minor victory
 ve sab ek vishvavidhyalay press ke utpaada the jinamein badhati gadabadi, kshay or bhrasht pratha kaa samavesh tha or jo khud ko jivit rakhane ke liye zyada se zyada apni bible or prarthana pustak sambandhi kaaryon ko patte par dene par nirbhar tha
 This business was saved by the intervention of only one delegate, William Blackstone
 press kii arajak sthiti se naaraaz hokar or vaais chancelar jorge hadesford se dushmani mol lekar blackstone ne chhapekhane kii baariki se jaanch karwaai lekin iske uljhangrast sanghathan or dhoort prakriyaaon ke nishkarsh ke rup main unhen apane sahyogiyon ke keval "udhaas or tiraskaarpurn chuppi" yaa "zyada se zyada nistej udaseenta" kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 gusse main aakar blackstone ne may 1757 main hadesford ke uttaradhikari thomas randolf ko likhe gaye ek lambey patr ko prakashit karke vishvavidhyalay ko apni jimmedaariyon ko puraa karne ke liye majaboor kiya
 Here, Blackstone presented the press as a congenital institution that had omitted all the false pretense of serving a scholarship "while spending time in a slurry of lazy oblivion 


 overbearing mechanics"
 in sharmnaak maamalon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye blackstone ne andhadhundh sudhaar kii maang kii jo dailygeton kii shaktiyon or dayitvon ko sakhti se sthapit karegaa, aadhikarik rup se unke vichaaron or karypranali ko record karegaa or chhapekhane ko ek kushal aadhaar pradaan karegaa
 However, Randolph ignored the document and the change did not begin until Blackstone threatened to take legal action
 vishvavidhyalay ne 1760 tak blackstone ke sabhi sudhaaron ko apnaane kii disha main kadam uthaaya tha
 By the late 18th century, the press had gained more attention
 aarambhik copirite kaanoon ne stationurs ko kamjor bananaa shuru kar diya tha or vishvavidhyalay ko anbhavi printeron ko apana bible kaary patte par dene main ksht hone laga
 The lease became a very risky proposition when the American War of Independence deprived Oxford of its biblical significant market and forced delegates to offer press shares to those who "traded for mutual benefit" Take care and manage troubles "
 adtalis sheyaron ko jari kiya gaya jiske saath vishvavidhyalay ke paas ek niyantrak hissaa tha
 At the same time, traditional scholarship revitalized the works of Jeremiah Markland and Peter Elmsley, as well as texts edited by many academics in mainland Europe in the early nineteenth century - with August Emanuel Becker and Karl Wilhelm Dindorf being the most prominent
 donon ne 50 saalon tak ek dailygat ke rup main kaam karne vaale unani vidwaan thomas gasford ke aamantran par sanskarnon ko taiyaar kiya
 In his time, the developing press established distributors in London and employed bookseller Joseph Parker in Turl Street in Oxford for this purpose
 parker ne bhi press main apane share kharid liye
 The expansion pushed the press out of the Clarendon building
 1825 main dailygeton ne vorcester college se jameen karidaa
 dainiel robertson or edward balor dwaara nirmit yojanaon ke aadhaar par imaaraton kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or 1830 main press ko vahaan sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 Situated at the corner of Walton Street and Great Clarendon Street, northwest from Oxford City Center, the site retains the oup's main office in the twenty-first century
 press ne ab baari badlaav ke yug main pravesh kiya
 Even in 1830, it was a joint-stock printing business in the backward field of education offering scholarly creations to a relatively small group of readers, such as scholars and clerics
 ek itihaaskaar ke mutabik yah press "sharmile rogabhramiyon ke ek samaaj" kaa utpaada tha
 Its trade depended largely on the sale of cheap bibles and its delegates were symbols of Gasford or Martin Ruth
 ve lambey samay se kaam kar rahe paramparawaadi the jo har saal 5 yaa 10 sheershakon ko chhapane vaale ek vidvatapurna vyavsaay kii adhyakshata kar rahe the jaise lidele or scots greek english lexican or iske vyapaar kaa vistaar karne main unki ruchi bahut kam yaa nahin thi
 The 1830s must have seen a restless departure of steam power for printing
 is samay thomas combay press main shaamil hue or 1872 main apni maut tak vishvavidhyalay ke mudrak bane rahe
 Coombe was a better businessman than most of the delegates but still no promoter: he failed to materialize India's vast commercial potential of paper which turned out to be one of Oxford's most profitable trade secrets in later years
 phir bhi, combay ko vyavsaay main apane sheyaron ke madhyam se kaaphi dhan praapt hua or volverkot ke diwalia paper mil kaa adhigrahan or naveekaran kaa kaam bhi mila
 He funded schooling in the press and the renewable fund of St
 Barnabas Church in Oxford
 combay kaa dhan itnaa bad gaya ki ve pre-rafelit broorahud ke pehle sangrakshak ban gaye or unhone or unki patni martha ne is samooh ke aarambhik kaaryon ke adhikansh hisse ko kharid liya jinamein wiliam holman hunt kaa da lit of da world bhi shaamil tha
 Coombe however had little interest in the production of a beautifully printed composition in the press
 unke chhapekhane se judaa sabase janaa mana granth elices adventures in vanderland kaa trutipurna pratham sanskaran tha jise 1865 main iske lekhak levis carol ke kharch par oxford dwaara mudrit kiya gaya tha
 The Royal Commission of 1850 and a new secretary Bartholomew Price were imposed on the functioning of the university to make radical changes in the press
 1868 main niyukt hone vaale price ne pehle hi vishvavidhyalay ko suzav diya tha ki vyavsaay kii "chaukas adheekshan" ke liye ek kushal kaaryakari adhikari kii jarurat thi jisamen alexander macmillan ke saath kii jane vaali saudebaaji bhi shaamil thi jo 1863 main oxford kii chapai ke prakaashak ban gaye or 1866 main saste or praathmik schuli pustakon kii cleyarendon press shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan karne main price kii madad kii - shaayad aisa pehali baar hua tha jab oxford ne cleyarendon chapai kaa istemaal kiya
 Under Price's leadership, the press began to take its modern shape
 1865 tak dailygasi kaa sarvakalik hona band ho gaya or isaki jagah paanch sarvakalik or paanch kanisht padon kaa vikaas hua jinhen vishvavidhyalay kii taraf se hone vaali niyukti ke madhyam se bharaa jaataa tha or iske saath hi saath vaais chancelar ek paden dailygat hota tha: jo gutbaji ke liye ek kaanchagrih tha jisaki rakhwali or niyantran price ne badi chaturaai se kii
 The university repurchased its shares because its holders either retired or died
 khaaton ke paryvekshan kaa kaam 1867 main navnirmit vitt samiti ko de diya gaya
 Major new lines of work started
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1875 main dailygeton ne fredrick maiks mular ke sampadakatv ke tahat secred books of da east shrinkhalaa ko anumodith kiya jisase ek vyapak pathakatv ko dharmik vichaaron kii ek bahut badi shrinkhalaa praapt hui
 Price similarly moved OUP toward publication in its own right
 1863 main parker ke saath press kaa rishta khatm ho gaya or 1870 main kuch bible rachanaaon ke liye landan main ek chote se jildasajikhana ko karidaa gaya
 Macmillan's contract expired in 1880 and was not renewed
 is samay tak, landan ke patternoster ro main bible ke bhandaran ke liye oxford kaa ek godaam bhi tha or 1880 main iske prabandhak henry fraud ko vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak kaa aupchaarik kitaab diya gaya
 Froud benefited from the book trade, not the university, and remained a conundrum for many
 oxford ke staff magazine "da cleyarendanian" ke ek mrityulekh ke anusaar "yahan oxford main hamamen se kuch logon ke paas hi unka vyaktigat gyaan tha"
 uske baavjood, vyavsaay main pustakon kii nai linon ko shaamil karke, 1881 main new testament ke sanshodhit sanskaran ke vishaal prakaashan kii adhyakshata karke or 1896 main britain ke baahar neuyork main press kaa pehla karyaalay sthapit karne main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaakar fraud oupi ke vikaas ke liye bahut mahatvapurn ban gaye
 Price converted OUP
 1884 main jab ve sachiv ke pad se ritair hue tab dailygeton ne vyavsaay ke antim sheyaron ko waapas kharid liya
 The press was now wholly owned by the university, including a paper mill, a raid, a bindbank and a warehouse
 schuli kitabon or aadhunik vidwaanon ke granthon jaise james clerk maxwell ke e treetaise on electricity and magnetismo ke shaamil hone se iskaa utpaadan bad gaya tha jo oinstin ke vichaar kaa mul siddhant sabit hua
 By simply establishing it without abandoning its tradition and quality of work, Price began to transform OUP into a cautious and modern publisher
 1879 main unhone prakaashan kaa kaam bhi apane haath main le liya jiske falswaroop vah prakriya apni charam seemaa par pahunch gai arthath vishaal pariyojna kaa aagaman hua jo oxford english dictionari bana
 The "new English Dictionary" provided to Oxford by James Murray and the Philological Society was a brilliant academic and patriotic work
 lambii baatcheet ke falswaroop ek aupchaarik anubandh kii sthapana hui
 Murray had to edit a composition that would take about 10 years and cost around £ 9000
 donon aankade bahut zyada ashaavadi lag rahe the
 The dictionary began to appear in printed form in 1884, but the first edition was not completed until 1928, 13 years after Murray's death, costing around £ 375,000
 yah vishaal vittiya boj or iske nihitarth price ke uttaridhikariyon ke kandhe par aa gaya
 The next secretary had to suffer a lot to solve this problem
 Philip Lightton Gayle was appointed in 1884 by Vice Chancellor Benjamin Jowett
 belleole main apni shiksha or landan prakaashan main apni prishthbhumi hone ke baavjood press ke kaary gail kii samaj se baahar the
 Delegates began working around him and eventually the university fired Gail in 1897
 sahaayak sachiv charles kannan ne thodi bahut pareshaani ke saath or apane purvavarti ke prati bahut kam sneh ke saath is kaam ko apane haath main liya: "gail hameshaa yahan the lekin mujhe samaj main nahin aata ki unhone kya kiya
 " kannan ko apni nai bhoomika main saarvajanik buddhi kaa bahut kam avasar mila tha
 As a highly talented classist, he became the head of business which was traditionally successful but now moving into unknown territory
 khud-ba-khud visheshgy shaikshik rachanaaon or anirbharsheel bible vyapaar dictionari kii badhati laagat or uniwarsity chest ke liye press ke yogadanon se judi jaruraton ko puraa na kar sakaa
 OUP needed too much revenue to meet these demands
 kannan ne is lakshya ko paane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 vishvavidhyalay kii raajnneeti or jadta ko chaunkaate hue unhone fraud or landan karyaalay ko sampoorn vyavsaay kaa vittiya ingine banaaya
 In 1906, Froude acquired Oxford's World Classics and began to drive Oxford on the path of popular literature
 usee varsh unhone bacchon ke sahitya or chikitsa pustakon ke prakaashan main madad karne ke liye hoder and stafaton ke saath ek tathakthith "sanyukt udhyam" main pravesh kiya
 Cannan as Froude's assistant, his Oxford protégé Assistant Secretary Humphrey S
 Ensuring the continuation of these efforts by appointing Milford
 1913 main fraud ke ritair hone ke baad mileford prakaashak bane or 1945 main ritair hone tak aakarshak landan vyavsaay or ise report karne vaale shakha karyaalayon kaa shashan kaary sambhala
 press kii vittiya sthiti ko dekhte hue kannan ne vidwaanon ke pustakon yaa yahaan tak ki dictionari ko asambhav deytaon ke rup main mahatv pradaan karnaa band kar diya
 He commented that "I don't think the university can produce enough books to ruin us"
 unke prayaason ko chhapekhane kii kushalta se kaaphi madad mili
 Horace Hart was appointed to the post of Comptroller of the Press in Gayle's own time, but proved more effective than the Secretary
 With extraordinary energy and professionalism, he improved and expanded Oxford's printing resources and developed Heart's Rules as the first style guide for Oxford's proof-readers
 iske baad ye duniya bhar ke chhapekhane main maanak ban gaye
 In addition, he suggested the creation of the Clarendon Press Institute as a social club for employees in Walton Street
 jab 1891 main yah santhaan khulaa tab press ke paas isamen shaamil hone ke liye prashikshuon sahit 540 karmchaaree the
 Finally, his general interest in printing led Hart to list "failed types" and then used them in a series of Tudor and Stuart facsimile volumes for the press before his death in 1915 due to ill health
 tab tak oupi ek sankeern mudrak se vishvavidhyalay ke swaamitv vaale ek vyapak prakaashan pratishthan main badal chukaa tha jisaki antarrashtriya upasthiti badhati ja rahi thi
 Froud had no doubt that the press business in London had grown substantially and was appointed on contract with the start of the sale
 saat saal baad vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak ke rup main fraud ek chhap ke rup main apane khud ke naam ke saath-saath 'oxford uniwarsity press' kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 This style persisted until recent times and two types of impressions were originating from the London offices of the press
 'vishvavidhyalay ke prakaashak' ke naam se jane jane vaale antim vyakti jon gilbert newton brown the jo apane sahakarmiyon ke bich 'bruno' ke naam se jane jate the
 The differences implied by the impressions were subtle but important
 kamishan par landan dwaara jari kiye jane vaale pustakon kii style par 'henry fraud' yaa 'hamphri mileford' kii chhap thi jis par oupi kaa koi ullekh nahin tha maano prakaashak unhen apane aap jari kar rahe the jabaki vishvavidhyalay ke sheershak ke adheen prakashkon dwaara jari kiye jane vaale pustakon par 'oxford uniwarsity press' kii chhap thi
 Both of these categories were mostly controlled by London, while the Oxford Clarendon Press looked after the books
 kamishan kitabon kaa makasad landan vyavsaay ke upree kharchon ko vittposhit karne ke liye kamdhenu gaay kii tarah kaam karnaa tha kyonki press ne is prayojan ke liye alag se kisi sansaadhan kii vyavastha nahin kii thi
 Yet Froud particularly noted that all commission books published by him received the approval of the delegates
 yah vidwaanon yaa puraavidon ke preson ke liye koi asaamaanya vyavastha nahin thi
 Price immediately prioritized Froud's joint publication with the Cambridge University Press of a revised version of the Bible to the extent that it was likely to be a 'bestseller' to keep all the resources of the press to keep pace with demand Work is required
 It was a complete revival of the Bible text from the earliest original Greek and Hebrew versions superseding the Authorized Version of 1611
 fraud kii agency ko thik samay par sanshodhit sanskaran ke liye sthapit kiya gaya jise 17 may 1881 ko prakashit kiya gaya or prakaashan se pehle or tab se ek khatarnaak dar par isaki ek million pratiyon kii bikri hui haalanki atyadhik utpaadan kii vajah se ant main laabh main kami aa gai
 Although Fraud was by no means an Oxford man and had no social pretense to be so, he was still a good businessman capable of striking the magic balance between vigilance and enterprise
 unke man main bahut pehle se hi press ke videshi vyapaar ko sabase pehle europe main or uske baad lagaataar america, canada, bharat or africa main unnat banane kaa vichaar hilor maar rahaa tha
 He was largely responsible for setting up depots in Edinburgh, Toronto and Melbourne along with the US branch
 fraud ne lekhakon se nipatane, jildasaji, vitaran or vigyaapan sahit oupi kii chhap vaali kitabon ke liye adhikansh prachaalan tantron ko niyantrit kiya or keval sampadakeey kaary or chapai kii dekharekh kaa kaam oxford dwaara kiya gaya
 Froud regularly sent money to Oxford but felt privately that the business had little capital and would soon vacate the university's resources if it did not find a commercial base
 unhen khud ek nirdhaarit seemaa tak vyavsaay main paison kaa nivesh karne kii adhikaar tha lekin paariwarik pareshaaniyon kii vajah se ve aisa nahin kar paa rahe the
 Hence his interest in foreign sales arose because there was an opportunity to make money in India during the decades of 1880s and 1890s, while the European book market was facing a recession
 lekin press ke faisle se fraud kii duuri kaa matlab tha ki jab tak koi pratinidhi unki tarafdaari nahin karata tab tak ve is niti ko prabhavit karne main asamarth the
 Froud spent most of his time working under the mandate given by the delegates
 In 1905, while applying for pension, he was the then Vice Chancellor, J
D
 R
 Wrote to mcgrath that during his seven-year tenure as manager of the Bible Warehouse, the London business had an average sales of around £ 20,000 and a profit of £ 1887 per year
 1905 tak prakaashak ke rup main unke prabandhan ke tahat bikri kaa pariman 2 xxrep 5 0 pound prati varsh pahunch gaya tha or unke 29 saal ke kaarykaal main laabh ke pariman kaa ausat 8242 prati varsh pahunch gaya tha
 Price, trying to modernize the press against resistance to the historical inertia of the press in his own way, was overworked and by 1883 he was so tired of his work that he began to demand to retire
 1882 main benjamin jovet vishvavidhyalay ke vaais chancelar ban gaye the
 Impatient with the infinite committees that undoubtedly took part in the appointment of Price's successor, Jowett obtained permission from the delegates and persuaded his alumni assistant Philip Lightton Gayle to become the next secretary of the delegates
 gail pratinidhiyon dwaara nindaatmak tareeke se ek vanijyik form maane jane vaale kaisel, petter and galpin naamak ek prakaashan form main khud ke liye ek naam kaa nirmaan kar rahe the
 Gail was an aristocrat himself unhappy with his work where he found himself catering to the taste of 'one class: the lower middle' and took advantage of the opportunity to work with readers and texts attracted by OUP 
 jovet ne gail ko sunahare avasar pradaan karne kaa vaada kiya jinamein se kuch avasar pradaan karne kaa adhikaar unhen bhi tha
 He scheduled Gayle's appointment at the time of long leave and Mark Pattison's death so potential opposition could not attend important meetings
 jovet ko acchhee tarah maaloom tha ki gail kaa virodh kyon kiya jayega kyonki unhone kabhi press ke liye kaam nahin kiya tha or na hi ve koi pratinidhi the or unhone shahar main vaanijya sambandhi apane kachche gyaan se khud kaa kariyar mitti main mila diya tha
 Their fear was overcome
 gail ne chaaturya kii ek chihnit kami ke saath turant press ke sampoorn aadhunikeekaran kaa prastaav rakhaa or apane liye sthaayee dushmano ko janm de diya
 Nevertheless he worked closely with Froud and by 1898 expanded the reach of publishing programs and OUP
 uske baad pratinidhiyon ke asahyog kii vajah se unke saamne aane vaali asambhav kaary paristhitiyon main unki sehat kharaab ho gai
 The delegates then sent a notice of termination of their service which was a breach of their contract
 haalanki unhen mukadmaa nahin karne or chupchaap chale jane ke liye raji kiya gaya
 Initially the delegates were not opposed to his efforts but his manner of executing them and his lack of sympathy with the educational way of life
 unke vichaar se press vidwaanon kaa ek sangh tha or yah hameshaa aisa hi rahegaa
 gail kii 'kushalta' kaa vichaar us samskruti kaa ulanghan karata hua dikhaai diya haalanki baad main andar se kaaphi had tak isi tarah ke sudhaar kaarykram ko vyavhaar main laayaa gaya
 Charles Cannan, who played a key role in Gayle's expulsion, was replaced by Gayle in 1898 and his younger colleague Humphrey S
 in age
 Milford effectively replaced Froud in 1907

 In fact in 1927 the plan of the essays presented by Foss to Milford for publication appeared as the Heritage of Music
 Likewise, Percy Scholes's Listeners Guide to Music was introduced to the new department as the first of a series of books based on music appreciation to be heard by the public

 According to Hinnel's proposal AK, the music department's initial "mix of scholarship and cultural nationalism" in the field of music with largely unknown commercial possibilities was motivated by its sense of cultural philanthropy and its desire to promote "national music outside the German mainstream"

 In the context of what the press called "the most durable gentleman's agreement in the history of modern music", Foss guaranteed the publication of any music that Vaughan Williams would like to offer him
 In addition, Foss took steps towards securing not only oup's rights to music publishing and live performances, but also the "mechanical" rights to recordings and broadcasts
 It was not entirely clear how important all this would have proved at that time

 The London office "remained a source of money for the Clarendon Press to fund the promotion of education
" In addition, OUP considered its book publications to be short-term projects: any unsold book was recalled from the market within a few years of its publication
 In contrast, the music department's pressure on music for performance was relatively long-term and sustained, particularly because income from it would come from repeated broadcasts or recordings, and because it was associated with new and upcoming musicians Was engaged in building their relationship

 Jinnah joined the Indian National Congress in 1896
 tab tak congress bhartiya raajnneetik kaa sabase bada sanghathan ban chukaa tha
 Like ordinary moderates, Jinnah did not demand any time for the independence of India, instead he kept demanding from the British for better education, law, industry, employment etc

 Jinnah believed that freedom can be achieved only by constitutional struggle
 
 congress ke duusare netaaon se alag, gandhiji videshi kapade nahin pahante the, angreji kii jagah zyada se zyada hindi kaa prayog karte the or sanathan hindu chintan kaa hi prayog raajnneeti main karte the
 These were some of the reasons that Gandhiji gained immense popularity
 gandhi ji ne khilaafat andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha jabaki jinna ne iskaa khulkar virodh kiya
 Jinnah believed that this would promote religious fundamentalism
 1920 main jinna ne congress ke istipha de diya
 Along with this, he also warned that the principle of mass struggle of Gandhiji will not reduce the division between Hindus and Muslims
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki isse donon samudaayon ke andar bhi jabardasht vibhaajan paidaa hoga

 His personal life, especially his marital life, was affected due to overwork in political work
 haalanki unhone apane vaivaahik jivan ko bachaane ke liye europe kii yatra bhi kii, lekin 1927 main pati or patni alag ho gayi
 In 1929, his wife died after a serious illness, after which Jinnah continued to remain unhappy

 Jinnah invited Congress for alliance
 pehle to donon ne faisla kiya ki ve angrejon se milakar muqabla karenge, lekin jinna ne shart rakkhi ki congress ko musalamaanon ke liye pruthak nirvachan kshetra or muslim lig ko bharat ke musalamaanon kaa pratinidhi maananaa hoga, jise congress ne asweekaar kar diya
 There were many Muslim leaders in the Congress at that time, so it was not easy for him to consider the League as representative of Indian Muslims
 jinna ne kai congress netaaon se baatcheet bhi kii or congress ne lig ko congress main vilay karne kaa prastaav bhi pesh kiya parantu vaarta phir bhi vifal ho gayi
 Jinnah was roaming around India and giving speeches
 1930 main muslim lig ke ek bhaashan main mohammad ikbaal ne uttar pashchim bhartiya rajya aar jur diya tha na kii pakistan desh kii
 In 1933, Rahmat Ali printed the pamphlet and renamed the country as Pakistan
 congress ke saath vaarta vifal hone ke baad jinna ko bhi yah vichaar aayaa ki musalamaanon ko apane adhikaron kii raksha ke liye ek alag desh milanaa hi chaiye bina iske kaam nahin banegaa
 Later, Jinnah became absolutely convinced that both Hindus and Muslims are citizens of different countries, so they should be separated
 unka yahi vichaar baad main jaakar jinna ke dvirashtrawaad kaa siddhanth kahalaaya
 Jinnah said that injustice would be done to Muslims in India and in the end civil war would spread
 yah baat jinna ne ikbaal ke saath patrachaar main bhi uthaayi
 a resolution passed in the 1940 Lahore session stating that the main objective of the Muslim League is the creation of Pakistan
 congress ne is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 Leaders like Maulana Abbul Kalam Azad and organizations like jamaat-islami strongly condemned it
 26 july 1943 ko khaksaar ugravadiyon ke hamale main jinna ghayal ho gayi
 Jinnah founded the Don newspaper in 1941, through which he propagated his idea
 jinna ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan britain kii madad kii thi or 1942 main unhone bharat chodo aandolan kaa virodh kiya tha

 For a vector field v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v}}, divergence is usually written as follows: kisi tencer t { \ displaystyle { \ stackrel { \ mathbf { \ mathfrak {T}} }{}}} ke liye, divergence praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se likhaa jaataa he: For a vector field v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v}}, curl is written as: kisi sadish kshetra v { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {v} } ke liye, gradient praayah is prakaar likhaa jaataa he: For a scalar field, ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi}, the gradient is written as: The curl of the gradient of any scalar field φ { \ displaystyle \ \ phi } is always zero: One way to establish this identity is to use three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates
 According to the article on curl, where the right hand side is a determinant, and i, j, k are unit vectors pointing in the positive axes directions, and ∂x = ∂ / ∂ x etc
 For example, the x-component of the above equation is: where the left-hand side evaluates as zero assuming the order of differentiation is immaterial
 The divergence of the curl of any vector field a is always zero: The Laplacian of a scalar field is defined as the divergence of the gradient: Note that the result is a scalar quantity
 In simpler form, using Feynman subscript notation: where the notation ∇A means the subscripted gradient operates on only the factor A
 a less general but similar idea is used in geometric algebra where the so-called Hestenes overdot notation is employed
 The above identity is then expressed as: where overdots define the scope of the vector derivative
 In the first term it is only the first factor that is differentiated, while the second is held constant
 Likewise, in the second term it is the second factor that is differentiated, and the first is held constant
 As a special case, when a = B: where the Feynman subscript notation ∇B means the subscripted gradient operates on only the factor b
in overdot notation, explained above: The gradient of the product of two scalar fields ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi} and φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} follows the same form as the Product rule in single variable Calculus

 azaad hind fuj sabase pehle raja mahendra pratap singh ne 29 oktober 1915 ko afghanistan main banaayi thi
 Originally it was the army of 'azad Hind Sarkar', which was formed with the goal of liberating India by fighting the British
 kintu is lekh main jise 'aaazaad hind fouj' kaha gaya he usase is sena kaa koi sambandh nahin he
 Yes, both name and purpose were the same
 rasbihari bose ne japaniyon ke prabhaav or sahaayta se dakshin-purvi asia se japan dwaara ekatrit qareeb 40,000 bhartiya stri-purushon kii prashikshit sena kaa gathan shuru kiya tha or use bhi yahi naam diya arthath azaad hind fuj

 In such a situation, Subhash had to migrate to Tokyo and it is said that he died in an air crash
 yadhyapi unka sainik abhiyaan asafal ho gaya, kintu is asafalataa main bhi unki jeet chhipi thi
 Of course, Subhash was an extreme nationalist
 unke man main fasivadi adhinaayakon ke sabal tareekon ke prati bhaavnaatmak jhukaav bhi tha or ve bharat ko shighratisheeghra swatantrata dilaane hetu hinsaatmak upayon main aasthaa bhi rakhte the
 That is why they formed Azad Hind Fauj
 yadhyapi azaad hind fouj ke senaniyon kii sankhya ke bare main thode bahut matbhed rahe hai parantu zyaadaatar itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki is sena main lagbhag chalis hajaar senaanee the
 This number has also been approved by Colonel GD Andersen, who was in British Intelligence

 Maharashtra's largest district by area is "ahmednagar"
 kshetrafal - 17,413 varg ki

 Population - 45,43,080 ahmednagar jile main 14 tehsil he
 Two Lok Sabha constituencies in Ahmednagar district; Shirdi and Ahmednagar

 Kammaddi is a village in Kadap district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 jataka yaa jataka pali yaa jataka kathaayen buddha granth tripitak kaa suttapitak antargat khuddakanikaay kaa 10waan bhaag he
 These stories contain the stories of Mahatma Buddha's earlier births
 jo manyata he ki khud gautamabuddha ji ke dwaara kahe gaye he, haalanki kii kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kuch jataka kathaayen, gautamabuddha ke nirvana ke baad unke shishyon dwaara kahi gayi he
 The oldest written stories in the world are Jataka tales in which about 600 stories have been collected
 yah isvi samvath se 300 varsh purv kii ghatana he
 These stories attempt to explain policy and religion through entertainment
 jataka khuddak nikaay kaa dasavaan prasiddh granth he
 It would be more appropriate to call Jataka as the book of texts rather than as a text
 uskaa koi-koi kathanak puure granth ke rup main he or kahin-kahin uski kahaniyon kaa rup sankshipt mahakavy-sa he
 The word Jataka is made of mass metal
 iskaa arth he bhoot athwa bhav
 This word is formed by adding the suffix 'kat' to the 'jan' metal
 dhaatu ko bhoot arth main prayukt karte hue jab arth kiya jaataa he to jatbhoot katha evam rup banataa he
 jat-jani-janan-janam meaning is used when used in the Bhava sense
 is tarah ‘jataka’ shabd kaa a rth he, ‘jaat’ arthath janm-sambandhin
 'jataka' is the stories related to the pre-birth of Lord Buddha
 buddhatv praapt kar lene kii avasthaa se purv bhagavan buddha bodhisattva kehalaate hai
 They are candidates for enlightenment at that time and practice the ten perfections or perfections of charity, piety, friendship, truth, etc
 bhoot-dayaa ke liye ve apane praanon kaa anek baar balidaan karte hai
 In this way, they perform the ability of intelligence
 bodhisattva shabd kaa arth hi he bodhi ke liye udyogshil praani
 For Bodhi, Sattva, which is also said by some scholars
 pali sutton main ham anek baar padhate hai, ‘‘sambodhi praapt hone se pehle, buddha na hone ke samay, jab main bodhisattva hi tha‘‘ aadi
 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ‘‘pannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo ‘jataka’ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh but it does not seem to be right
 sambhavtah ve chaturth shatabdi isvi ke kavi the
 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE
 isamen se kuch pali jataka ke samaan hai or ku chha aisi bhi hai, jo pali jataka main nahin pai jaati
 Raees Davids states that the collection and execution of the Jataka took place on the basis of ancient folklore in the middle country
 vinternitj ne bhi praayah isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 Most of the people are Buddhakalins
 sanchi or bharhut ke s tupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par unke drishyon kaa ankit hona unke purv ashokakaleen hone kaa paryaapt sakshya detaa he
 In relation to the time and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the past is linked with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter who hunted from the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 Jatakathakatha's Nidan Katha tells about three Nidas of Buddha life, Dure Nidan is the story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part under Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the plot is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All of this leads to the conclusion that the Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant

 Many types of descriptive narratives are filled in the Jataka, whose literary characteristics cannot be mentioned here in very brief form
 buddhakalin bharat ke samaaj, dharm, raajnneeti, bhugol, loukik vishwaas, aarthik evam vyapaarik avasthaa evam sarvaadhik jivan kii puri saamagree hamen jataka main milti he

 The woman is praised as "sachse Tees Sudullabhum" but Bhariya and is described as the ultimate Sakha, "bharia Naam Parama Sakha"

 While comparing the Jataka with Ramayana and Mahabharata, we should keep in mind that not all the portions of these two texts belong to the pre-buddha era
 ramayana ke vartmaan rup main 2400 shloke paye jate hai
 It has been said in the Ramayana, 'chaturvinsh Sahasrani Shlokanam said vaan sage
 kintu buddha mahavibhasha-shaastra se siddh he ki dwitiya shatabdi isvi main bhi ramayana main keval 12,000 shloke the

 The Buddhist adjective Chaturmaharajik has also come there
 romak logon kaa bhi varnan he

 It is indeed very difficult to put their conclusions here in the briefest form
