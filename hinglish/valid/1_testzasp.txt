 'frenchise' kii vyutpatti angl-francisi shabd frank se hui he - jiskaa arth he mukt, iskaa prayog sangya va kriya donon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Franchises provide franchisors with the option to create 'chain stores' for distribution of goods and avoid investment and liability on the chain
 frenchizi kii safalataa main frenchiser kii safalataa he
 It should be noted, however, that apart from the US, where there are now clear federal laws relating to franchise in China, most countries in the world recognize 'franchise' but rarely make legal provisions for it
 jahaan koi vishisht kanoon nahin he, frenchise ko ek vitaran pranali mana jaataa he, jiske liye vishisht anubandh ke antargat shasit trademark niyam lagu hote hai
 Businesses with the following characteristics are compatible with franchising: jaisaa ki khudara bikri main prachlit he, frenchizing se frenchizi ko vishesh laabh yah hota he ki vah uplabdh trademark par jaldi shuruuaat kar saktaa he or use sansaadhan or aadharbhoot sanrachana ko viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 It can be said that there are three types of franchises: small, medium and very large franchises
 Although franchises are based on products - for example major cosmetics such as Shanal - most franchisees belong to service firms

 There are also large franchises - hotels, spas, hospitals, etc
 - which are discussed further in technical alliances

 a franchise is only a temporary business investment, not a purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership, but simply an opportunity to hire or lease

 Franchise can be specific, non-specific or 'sole and exclusive'

 National or international advertising, training and other support services such as tangible and intangible are usually made available by the franchisor

 There is also a main 'master franchisor' which has the rights to sub-franchisees in a particular area
 antarrashtriya frenchise association ke anusaar sanyukt rajya america kaa lagbhag 4% vyavsaay frenchizi dwaara sanchalit he
 It is to be understood that franchising is the only means through which venture capital investment can be achieved and a disbursement system can be created for its services without losing control over the operations of the chain
 brands or sutara kii rachana or nishpaadan ke baad, frenchiser frenchise bech sakate hai or jokhim ko nune karte hue, apane 'frenchizi' kii puunji or sansadhano kaa upyog karte hue desh-videsh or mahadwipon main tezi se vistaar kar sakate hai
 Normally, the rules implemented by the franchising authority in the US are very stringent and important and most countries need their study to help protect small or early franchises in their country
 In addition to trademarks, there are proprietary service marks governed by copyright and similar regulations
 ek frenchise ke prayek paksh ke paas raksha karne yogya kai hit hote hai
 Most important for the franchisor is the protection of its trademark, control of the business concept and protection of technical information
 This requires the franchise to provide services for which the trademark has been made and became famous
 bahut adhik maanakeekaran sammilit hota he
 The prominent place in the service has to display the mark, symbol and trademark of the franchisor

 Franchises must deal with licensing carefully
 He must form a marketing plan or business plan with the franchisor
 The fee should be fully disclosed and there should be no indirect charge
 The current cost and cost and operating capital should be known before taking a license
 There must be an assurance that there will be no rush of additional licensees in the "area" if the franchisee works as planned
 The franchise should be seen as an independent businessman
 Any infringement of the trademark by third parties should protect the franchisor
 It is necessary to have a franchise lawyer to assist the franchisee during negotiations
 
 Often the training period - the cost of which is mostly included in the initial fee - is lower for operating the complicated equipment and the franchise has to learn from the books on its own

 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai

 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he

 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 It is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister to welcome and host the Heads of State and Delegations of various countries

 He represents India in international organizations such as United Nations, G20, BRICS, SAARC, non-aligned Movement, Commonwealth, etc
, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he

 Thirteenth pupil Kirtimati told the story in this way- ek baar raja vikramaditya ne ek mahabhoj kaa aayojan kiya
 In that banquet, innumerable scholars, Brahmins, merchants and courtiers were invited
 bhoj ke madhya main is baat par charchaa chali ki sansar main sabase bada dani koun he
 Everyone singled out Vikramaditya as the world's best dancer
 raja vikramaditya logon ke bhav dekh rahe the
 Just then, he looked at a Brahmin who was not giving his opinion
 lekin uske chehre ke bhav se spasht prathit hota tha ki vah sabhi logon ke vichaar se sahamat nahin he
 When Vikram asked him the meaning of his silence, he said fearing who would listen to him if he gave a different opinion
 raja ne uskaa vichaar poocha to vah bolaa ki vah asamanjas kii sthiti main padaa hua he
 If he does not tell the truth, he feels the sin of lies and in the event of telling the truth, he fears that the king will have to be angry
 ab vikram kii jigyaasa or bad gai
 He praised her candor and told her fearlessly
 tab usne kaha ki mahraaj vikramaditya bahut bade dani hai- yah baat satya he par is bhuulok par sabase bade dani nahin
 Everyone was shocked as soon as he heard this
 sabane vismit hokar poocha kya aisa ho saktaa he? us par us brahman ne kaha ki samudr paar ek rajya he jahaan kaa raja kirkittadhvaj jab tak ek lakh swarna mudraayen pratidin daan nahin karata tab tak ann-jal bhi grahan nahin karata he
 If this thing proves to be untrue, then that Brahmin was ready to get any punishment
 raja ke vishaal bhoj kaksh main nistabdhta chaa gai
 The Brahmin said that he stayed in the kingdom of Kirkittadhvaja for several days and went to take the gold currency every day
 sachmuch hi kirkittadhvaj ek lakh swarna mudraayen daan karke hi bhojan grahan karata he
 That is why he did not mix all the people present in the banquet
 raja vikramaditya brahman kii spashtvaadita se prasann ho gaye or unhone use paritoshik dekar sadar vidaa kiya
 After the departure of the Brahmin, King Vikramaditya disguised himself as an ordinary man and recalled the two daughters
 jab donon vetaal upasthit hue to unhone unhen samudr paar raja kirkittadhvaj ko rajya main pahunchaa dene ko kaha
 The hospitals took them there in a blink of an eye
 kirkittadhvaj ke mahal ke dwaar par pahunchakar unhone apana parichay ujjayini nagar ke ek saadhaaran naagarik ke rup main diya tathaa kirkittadhvaj se milane kii ichha jataai
 After some time, when he appeared in front of Kirkittadhwaj, he asked for a job with him
 kirkittadhvaj ne jab poocha ki ve koun sa kaam kar sakate hai to unhone kaa jo koi nahin kar saktaa vah kaam ve kar dikhaayenge
 King Kirkittadhwaj liked his answer and Vikramaditya got a job with him
 ve dwarpal ke rup main niyukt hue
 He saw that King Kirkittadhwaj literally does not take food and water every day until he donates one lakh gold currencies
 unhone yah bhi dekha ki raja kirkittadhvaj rose shaam main akelaa kahin nikalataa he or jab lautataa he, to uske haath main ek lakh swarna mudraon se bhari hui thili hoti he
 One day in the evening, he secretly chased Kirkittadhvaj
 unhone dekha ki raja kirkittadhvaj samudr main snaan karke ek mandir main jaataa he or ek pratimaa kii puja-archana karke khaulate tel ke kadaah main kud jaataa he
 When his body is roasted, some jognis come and take out his burnt body from bitter and eat it, and go away satisfied
 joganiyon ke jane ke baad pratimaa kii devi prakat hoti he or amrit kii boondein daalkar kirkittadhvaj ko jivit karti he
 With his own hands, one million gold coins trap in the bag of Kirkitadhvaja and Kirkittadhwaja is happy and returns to the palace
 praat:kaal vahi swarna mudraayen vah yaachakon ko daan kar detaa he
 Under Vikram's understanding, the secret of donating one lakh gold currencies daily came
 agle din raja kirkittadhvaj ke swarna mudraayen praapt kar chale jane ke baad vikram ne bhi naha-dho kar devi kii puja kii or tel ke kadaah main kud gaye
 When the Jognis scratched their burnt bodies and went away, Goddess resurrected them
 jivit karke jab devi ne unhen swarna mudraayen deni chaahin to unhone yah kahkar manaa kar diya ki devi kii krupa hi unke liye sarvopari he
 He repeated this action seven times
 saatvin baar devi ne unase bas karne ko kaha tathaa unase kuch bhi maang lene ko kaha
 Vikram was looking for this opportunity
 unhone devi se vah thili hi maang lee jisase swarna mudraayen nikalati thim
 As soon as Devi handed over that bag to him - a miracle happened
 mandir, pratimaa- sab kuch gaayab ho gaya
 Now only the beach was visible
 duusare din jab kirkittadhvaj vahaan aayaa to bahut niraash hua
 His rule of donating one lakh gold currencies for years was broken
 ann-jal tyaag kar apane kaksh main asahaay padaa rahaa
 His body began to fade
 jab uski haalat bahut adhik bigadane lagi, to vikram uske paas gaye or uski udaasi kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha
 When he told everything to Vikram himself, Vikram gave him the pouch containing the goddess and said that every day he was moved by seeing him lose his life by jumping in Kadah, so he got that bag from Goddess forever
 vah thili raja kirkittadhvaj ko dekar unhone us vachan kii bhi raksha kar lee, jo dekar unhen kirkittadhvaj ke darbar main naukari mili thi

 The common adulteration for profit is inactive sugars, usually of mannitol, creatine, or glucose, so the introduction of active adulteration gives the illusion of purity and 'dispersion' or a dealer may sell more products without adulteration to make it so
 Huh
 is prakaar shuddhta ke bhram ke kaaran, sharkara kii milawat dealer ko ek ucch keemat par utpaada ko bechney kii anumati detii he, saath hi us ucch keemat par utpaada ko adhik bechney kii bhi anumati detii he, jisase dealer kam laagat kii milawat ke saath atyadhik rajasav banane main sakasham ho jate hai
 Most jurisdictions incur large fines for the cocaine trade, so there is a cheating from the user about the purity and consequently higher profit rules for dealers
 2007 main european monitering centre for drugs and drug ediction dwaara ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki nukkad se khride gaye kokene kii shuddhta str aksar 5% se kam thi or ausatan 50% ke andar
 The first synthesis and description of the cocaine molecule was made in 1898 by Richard Willstetter
 vilstator ke sanshleshan ne tropinon se kokene praapt kiya
 Since then, Robert Robinson and Edward Leete have contributed significantly to this synthesis process
 jaivasanshleshan, L-glutamin ke saath shuru hota he jo paudhon main L-ornithin banataa he
 The major contributions of L-ornithine and L-arginine as precursors to the tropane ring were confirmed by Edward Leete
 iske baad ornithin putracin nirmaan ke liye ek pyridoxl phosphate ke nirbhar dicarbozilation ke tahat jaataa he
 In animals, however, the urea cycle receives putrescine from ornithine
 L-ornithin, L-arginin main badla jaataa he, jo tab agamatin nirmaan ke liye PLP dwaara dicarbozilet hota he
 Hydrolysis of imine receives n -carbamoyl putrescine followed by hydrolysis of urea to form putrescine
 paudhon or pashuon main ornithin ko putrusin main badalane ke alag-alag raste ek ho gaye hai
 a sam-dependent n -methylation of putrescine gives the n -methylputrasin product, which then undergoes oxidative deamination to produce aminoaldehyde by the action of dimine oxidase
 shif aadhaar gathan n -mithail Δ-1-pirolinium dhanayan ke jaivasanshleshan kii pushti karata he
 The additional carbon atoms required for the synthesis of cocaine are obtained from acetyl-coa by adding two acetyl-coa units to the n-methyl-δ-1-pyrrolinium cation

 The second sum is through Clasen condensation
 yah classen sanghanan se theoster ke pratidhaaran ke saath, 2-pratisthapit pirolidine kaa ek resmik mishran utpann karata he
 There is no preference for any stereo isomer in the manufacture of tropinone from 4 -3-oxobutanoate from racemic ethyl
 kokene ke jaivasanshleshan main, tathaapi, kokene ke ring pranali gathan ke liye keval -inentiomar ko cyclise kiya ja saktaa he
 The stereo selectivity of this reaction was further investigated through a prokaryl methylene hydrogen dissociation study
 iskaa kaaran he C-2 par atirikt kiral centre
 yah prakriya oxikaran ke madhyam se hoti he, jo pirolinium dhanayan ko or ek inolet runayan ke gathan ko or ek intramolicular manish pratikriya ko punerjeevit karti he
 The tropane ring system undergoes hydrolysis, sam-dependent methylation, and also under reduction for the formation of methyllegonine via NADPH
 The portion of benzoyl required for the formation of cocaine dysters is synthesized from phenylalanine via cinnamic acid
 iske baad benzoyal-coa donon ikaayiyon ko kokene ke nirmaan ke liye jodta he
 The biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids, however, is still uncertain
 hemshid kaa prastaav he ki robinsan kaa esetaedycarbozilate is pratikriya ke liye ek sambhavit madhyavarti ke rup main ubharta he
 Condensation of N-methylpyrrolinium and acetonidicarboxylate produces oxobutyrate
 dicarbojailation, tropen alcoloid kaa gathan karata he
 nadph-dependent reductase enzymes mediate tropinone deficiency, which has been characterized in many plant species
 paudhon kii in sabhi prajatiyon main do prakaar ke ridctez anzime hai, tropinon ridctez i or or tropinon ridctez II
 TRI tropine ko or TRII sudotropine ko utpann karata he
 Due to differing kinetic and ph / activity, enzyme characteristics, and 25-fold higher activity of TRI at TRII, the majority of tropinone deficiency results from TRI for tropine formation
 apane shuddh rup main kokene ek safed, moti ke rang kaa utpaada he
 Cocaine appearing in powder form is a salt, usually cocaine hydrochloride
 aam bazaar vaali kokene aksar milavati hoti he yaa iskaa vazan badhaane ke liye powder jaise vibhinn padaarthon ke saath ise "cat" kiya jaataa he; is prakriya main upyog kiya jane vaala sabase adhik aam padaarth he baking soda; lactose, dextros, inocetol or menitol ke rup main sharkara; or sthaneey chetanashoonyata, jaise lidokin yaa benzokine jo shleshm parade par kokene ke sunn karne ke prabhaav kii nakal karte hai yaa use badhaate hai
 Cocaine can also be "cut" with other stimulants such as methamphetamine
 milavati kokene aksar safed, halki-safed yaa gulabi powder hoti he
 The color of "cracked" cocaine depends on a number of factors, including the origin of the cocaine used, the method of preparation - along with ammonia or baking soda - and the presence of dirt, but it is usually white to yellow cream and There is a light brown color
 isaki banaavat milawat, utpatti or powder kokene ke prasanskaran or aadhaar ko badalane kii vidhi par bhi nirbhar karti he
 Its structure ranges from granular, sometimes very oily and hard, to almost crystalline in nature
 kokene, kai anya alcoloid kii tarah vibhinn prakaar ke lavan bana saktaa he, jaise hydrochloride or sulphate 
 Solvents of different salts have different solubility
 iskaa hydrochloride, anya alcoloid hydrochloride kii tarah dhruviya he or pani main ghulansheel he
 As the name suggests, "freebase" is the base form of cocaine, as opposed to the salt form
 It is practically insoluble in water, while hydrochloride salt is soluble in water
 freebase kokene kaa dhumrapaan karne se upyogkarta ke tantra main mithailegonidain jari hone kaa atirikt prabhaav hota he or iskaa kaaran he padaarth kaa pirolysis 
 Some research suggests that smoking of freebase cocaine may be more cardiotoxic than other routes of administration because of the effect of methylgonidine on lung tissue and liver tissue
 shuddh kokene ko kshareey ghol se uske prashaman lavan ko prabhaavaheen karke taiyaar kiya jaataa he, jo gaiyr-dhruviya buniyadi kokene hokar taal main baith jaataa he
 It is further refined through aqueous-solvent liquid-liquid extraction
 crack, freebase kokene kaa ek nimna shuddh rup he or isamen ashuddhta ke rup main sodium bikarbonit shaamil hota he
 Freebase and crack are often ingested by smoke

 Visitors are welcome to the city of Cajco in Peru and La Paz in Bolivia by presenting the essence of the coca leaf to help newcomer travelers overcome high-altitude sickness
 coca chaay pine kaa prabhaav ek halki uttejnaa or mood acha karne main dikhataa he
 It does not numb the mouth, nor does it impulse like snorting cocaine
 is utpaada ke vikrut upyog ko rokane ke liye, iske pairokaar, us apramanit avadharana ko prachaarit karte hai ki coca pattee ke saar ke seven kaa adhikansh prabhaav doum darze ke alcoloid se aata he, chunki yah naa keval shuddh kokene se maatraatmak rup se bhinn he balki gunatmak rup se bhi bhinn he
 It has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence
 ek vivaadaaspad adhyayan main, coca pattee ke aasav kaa prayog kiya gaya - paraamarsh ke alaava - coca paste kaa dhumrapaan karne vaale 23 logon kaa lima, peru main ilaaj kiya gaya
 The alternation dropped from an average of four per month before treatment with coca tea to an average of one during treatment
 sanyam kii avadhi upachaar se pehle 32 dinon ke ausat se, upachaar ke dauraan badhkar 217 din ho gai
 These results suggest that using coca leaf extract as well as counseling would be an effective way to prevent recurrence during the treatment of cocaine addiction
 mahatvapurn rup se, in parinaamon se yah bhi dridhtaa se pataa chalata he ki coca pattee saar main aushadhiy rup se praathmik sakriy metabolit, vastav main kokene hai or naa ki madhyamik alcoloid he
 The cocaine metabolite benzoylgonine can be found in people's urine, hours after drinking a cup of coca leaf extract
 kai prayokta is powder ko masoode kii pankti par ragadate hai, yaa ek cigarette filter ke madhyam se saanson main khinchate hai, jo masoodon or daanton ko sunn kar detaa he - isliye is prakaar ke seven ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main angrezi main "namiz", "gammers" yaa "cocoa pafs" kaa naam diya jaataa he
 This is mostly done with small amounts of cocaine left on the surface, after elution
 ek anya maukhik vidhi he gol kagaz main lapet kar thodi si kokene ko nigal janaa
 ise kabhi-kabhi angrezi main "snow bam" kaha jaataa he
 Coca leaves are typically mixed with an alkaline substance and are chewed as a bead by placing it between the cheeks and gums in the mouth and its juice is sucked
 ras ko aahista-aahista gaal ke bhitari shleshma parde dwaara avashoshit kiya jaataa he or jab niglaa jaataa he to jathrantra path dwaara
 vaikalpik rup se, coca kii pattiyon ko pani main bhigo kar chaay kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Eating coca leaves is generally an ineffective method of cocaine consumption
 coca pattee ke seven kii tarafdaari karne vaale kehete hai ki coca pattee ke seven ko aapraadhik ghoshit nahin kiya janaa chahie kyonki yah vaastavik kokene nahin he or falswaroop yah sateek taur par avaidh drug nahin he
 Because cocaine has an aqueous fusion and is inactive in the acidic stomach, it is not easily absorbed when eaten alone
 keval jab ise ek ucch kshareey padaarth ke saath mishrit kiya jaataa he, to yah pet ke madhyam se khun main avashoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The absorption capacity of orally consumed cocaine is limited by two additional components
 pratham, dawa kaa apachay aanshik rup se jigar dwaara hota he
 Second, the capillary and esophagus inside the mouth shrink after contact with this drug and reduce the surface area on which this drug can be absorbed
 phir bhi, kokene metabolites ko us vyakti ke mutr main paaya ja saktaa he jisane coca pattee ke aasav kaa ek hi cap piya he
 Therefore, it is a real additional form of cocaine use, albeit an inefficient method
 maukhik rup se seven kiya gaya kokene, lagbhag 30 minute main khun ke pravaah main miltaa he
 Generally, only a third of the oral dose is absorbed, although absorption has been shown to reach 60% in controlled conditions
 avasorana kii dhimi dar ko dekhte hue, adhiktam shaareerik or maadak prabhaav kokene lene ke lagbhag 60 minute baad haaavee ho jaataa he
 While the onset of these effects is slow, the effect lasts for approximately 60 minutes after reaching its peak
 aam dharna ke vipareet, khaanaa or pradhaman, donon ke parinamswaroop lagbhag dawa kaa samaan anupaat avashoshit hota he: 30 se 60% tak
 khaane kii tulana main, pradhaman kar kokene kaa teevr avasorana, drug ke adhiktam prabhaav ko jaldi praapt karne main parinat hota he
 Cocaine, when inhaled by the nose, produces a maximum physiological effect within 40 minutes and a maximum narcotic effect within 20 minutes, however, a more realistic activation period is 5 to 10 minutes, which is equivalent to eating cocaine
 naak se pradhaman kiye gaye kokene kaa shaareerik or maadak prabhaav, charam asar praapt kar lene ke baad lagbhag 40 - 60 minute tak bana rahata he
 Met de coca or coca leaf extract is also a traditional method of consumption and is often recommended in coca-producing countries, such as Peru and Bolivia to reduce the symptoms of altitude sickness
 seven kaa yah tarika, dakshin america ke mul janajatiyon dwaara kai shatabdiyon se apanaaya jaataa rahaa he
 a specific purpose of ancient coca leaf intake was to increase energy and reduce fatigue among the messengers who traveled for several days in search of other settlements
 1986 main jarnal of da american medical association main chape ek lekh se pataa chalaa ki america ke swasthya khaadya dukaanon main "health inka tii" ke rup main saar ke rup main banane ke liye coca ke sookhe pattey bik rahe hai
 While the packaging claimed that it had been "decocanized", no such process actually took place
 lekh ne kaha ki pratidin chaay ke do cap pine se halki uttejnaa, vardhit hriday dar or man main utsaah miltaa he or chaay anivaary rup se hanirahit he
 Despite this, the DEA seized several consignments in Hawaii, Chicago, Illinois, Georgia and several locations on the east coast of the US and the product was removed from the shelves
 pradhaman, manoranjan powder kokene ke seven kaa pashchimi duniya main sabase aam tarika he
 This drug diffuses and is absorbed through the mucous membrane surrounding the weaver
 kokene ke pradhaman ke vakt, naak ke parde ke madhyam se avasorana lagbhag 30-60% hota he, jahaan ucch khuraaq, vardhit avasorana kshamta ko prerit karti he
 Any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membrane is collected in the mucosa and swallowed
 kokene kaa seven karne waalon par kiye gaye ek adhyayan main, vyaktiparak charam prabhaav par pahunchane kaa ausat samay 14

 Any damage inside the nose occurs because cocaine shrinks blood vessels - and therefore stops blood and oxygen / nutrient flow - in that area
 pradhaman se pehle, kokene powder ko bahut baarik kanon main pis liya janaa chahie
 High-purity cocaine is very easily granulated, unless it is moist, which then takes the form of lump and reduces the effect of absorption by the nose
 kokene pradhaman ke liye, ghume hue banknote, khaali kalam, kate tinke, chaabiyon kaa nukila chor, vishesh chammach, lambey nakhun or tempons aplicator kaa prayog aksar kiya jaataa he
 Such devices are often called "tooters" by users
 kokene ko aam taur par ek sapaat, kadi sataha par daalaa jaataa he or ise "bamps", "lines", yaa "rail" main vibhajit kiya jaataa he or phir iskaa pradhaman kiya jaataa he
 Since stamina increases rapidly in the short term, many lines are often sniffed through the nose to produce greater impact

 Subjective effects that are not commonly shared with other methods of intake include ringing in the ear a few moments after injection that lasts 2 to 5 minutes, including tinnitus and auditory distortion
 ise bolchaal kii bhashaa main "bel ringer" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In a study conducted on cocaine users, the average time to reach peak subjective effects was 3
1 minutes
 ullasonmad jaldi hi utar jaataa he
 In addition to the toxic effects of cocaine, there is a risk of circulatory emboli from insoluble substances that can be used to cut the drug
 jaisaa ki chubhaaye jane vaale sabhi avaidh maadak dravyon ke saath hota he, upyogkarta ko rakt aadhaarit sankraman kaa jokhim bana rahata he agar sui lagane ke liye kitanurahit upkaran kaa prayog naa kiya gaya ho to
 a prickly mixture of cocaine and heroin, known as a "speedball", is a particularly popular and dangerous combination, as the opposite effects of the drug are actually complementary to each other, but at the same time a higher dose

 As an experiment, cocaine injections can be given to animals such as flies to study the mechanism of cocaine addiction
 saans main bharna yaa dhumrapaan karnaa, kokene ke seven karne kii kai vidhiyon main se ek he
 The rising steam of solid cocaine is smoked by heat
 brukeheven neshnal leboratory chikitsa vibhaag ke 2000 ke ek adhyayan main, jo adhyayan main hissaa lene vaale 32 nashediyon ke khud ke anubhav par aadhaarit thi, "charam shikhar" 1
4 minute + / - 0
5 minute ke madhya par paaya gaya Freebase or crack cocaine is often smoked with a pipe made of a small glass tube, often taken from the "love Roses", a glass tube containing a rose and as a loving gift Is offered
 inhen kabhi-kabhi "stams", "horns", "blasters" or "street shooters" kaha jaataa he
 a clean heavy piece of copper or sometimes a small clean pad of stainless steel - often called "brillo", or "chow", named after the Chow Boy brand of copper clear pad - is a reducing base
 And the flow acts as a modulator in which this "stone" can be melted and boiled to form steam
 crack kaa dhumrapaan karne vaale, kabhi-kabhi ek soda dabbe kii pendi main chota chhed karke bhi dhumrapaan karte hai
 Cracks are drunk by placing them at the end of the pipe; Keeping a small flame of fire near it creates steam, which the smoker then draws in breaths
 dhumrapaan karne ke lagbhag turant baad mahasoos kiye jane vaale prabhaav bahut teevr hote hai or lambey samay tak nahin chalate – aamtaur par paanch se pandrah minute tak
 When it is smoked, cocaine is sometimes mixed with other drugs such as cannabis, which is often twisted and rounded
 powder kiye gaye kokene kaa bhi kabhi-kabhi dhumrapaan kiya jaataa he, haalanki taap ke kaaran adhikansh rasayan nasht ho jaataa he; dhumrapaan karne vaale aksar ise marijuana par chhidakte hai
 The language referring to cocaine smoking equipment and methods differs, as does its packing method in market sales
 kokene aushadhgatiki main neurotransmeter ke jatil sambandh shaamil hai kokene kaa kendriya tantrika tantra par sabase adhik gahan adhyayan kiya gaya asar he dopamin transporter protein kii rukaawat
 tantrika sanket ke dauraan jari dopamin transmeter aamtaur par transporter ke madhyam se navinikrut hota he, yani, transporter transmeter ko baandhta he or use syneptic phank se baahar karte hue waapas priseneptic neuron main bhej detaa detaa he, jahaan ise bhandaaran putica main le liya jaataa he
 Cocaine binds tightly to the dopamine transporter and forms a cluster that blocks the transporter's functions
 dopamin transporter ab punah seven kaa apana kaary nahin kar saktaa or is tarah dopamin, syneptic phank main jamaa ho jaataa he
 This enhances and prolongs the synaptic postoperative effects of dopaminergic signaling on dopamine receptors on the receiving neuron
 lambey samay tak kokene kaa sampark, jaisaa ki aadi ho jane ke maamle main hota he, dopamin receptors or vardhit sanket transdaction ke down-regulation ke madhyam se, saamaanya dopaminargik sanketan ke homeostatic disregulation ko prerit karata he
 Low dopaminergic signs following chronic addiction to cocaine use can produce disorders such as depressive disorder and sensitize this important reward circuit of the brain to this strong effect of cocaine
 yah samvedansheeltaa, lat kii duhsadhay prakruti or punah patan ko prerit karti he
 Dopamine-rich brain regions, such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and anterior cortex, have often been targets of cocaine addiction research
 vah maarg khaas ruchi kaa he jo ventral tegmental kshetra main utpann dopaminargik neurons se bana he or jo nabhik ekambence main samaapt ho jaataa he
 This projection can act as a "reward center", in that it shows activation in response to a bad drug such as cocaine, in addition to natural rewards such as food or copulation
 jabaki inaam ke vyaktiparak anubhav main dopamin kii sateek bhoomika tantrika vaigyanikon ke bich behad vivaadaaspad he, nabhik ekambence main dopamin ke nikalne ko vyapak rup se kokene ke shandaar prabhaavon ke liye kam se kam aanshik rup se jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 The hypothesis is based primarily on laboratory data involving trained rats who consume cocaine on their own
 yadi dopamin pratirodhi ko sidhe nabhik ekambence main sanchaarit kiya jaataa he to acchhee tarah se prashikshit chuuhe jo swayan kokene khate hai, vilupt ho jaayenge is prakaar yah sanket dete hai ki kokene, drug-maang ke vyavhaar ko sahaara nahin detaa he
 The cocaine effect on serotonin shows multiple serotonin receptors and has been shown to inhibit the re-intake of 5-HT3, particularly as an important contributor to the effects of cocaine
 The excess of 5-HT3 receptors in cocaine adapted mice to demonstrate this characteristic, although the exact effect of 5-HT3 in this process is unclear
 5-HT2 receptor kokene seven main pradarshit ati-sakriyata ko utpann karne main prabhaav dikhaate hai
 In addition to the mechanism shown in the chart above, cocaine is shown to bind directly to the open extrinsic structure by stabilizing the DAT transporter while other stimulants stabilize the closed structure
 iske alaava, kokene is tarah se baandhta he taaki DAT main antarjaat hydrogen bandhan ko roka ja sake, jo anyathaa tab bhi banataa he jab amcatemin or isi prakaar ke anu baddh hote hai
 The binding property of cocaine is such that it combines so that it does not form hydrogen bonds and is blocked from formation due to the tightly closed orientation of the cocaine molecule
 anusandhan adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki transporter ke liye sambandh vah nahin he jo padaarth ke aadi ho jane main shaamil he, balki sanrachana or baadhya gun hai ki kab or kahaan transporter par anu bandhate hai
 Sigma receptors are affected by cocaine, since cocaine acts as a sigma ligand-governing muscle
 iske alaava vishisht receptors jin par ise kaary karte hue dikhaaya gaya he, NMDA or D1 dopamin receptor hai
 Cocaine also blocks the sodium channel, thereby interfering with the propagation of action potentials; Thus, like lignocaine and novocaine, it acts as a local anesthetic
 yah dopamin or serotonin sodium aadhaarit vaahak kshetron ko lakshya banaate hue, un vaahakon ke punah udgrahan se alag tantra ke rup main yojak sthalon par kriya karata he; apane sthaneey chetanashunya karanevaali aushadhi kii adwitiya upyogita ke kaaran, vah apni hi vyutpatti phiniltropens anuroop, jisamen unhen hataa diya jaataa he, tathaa emphatmin varg ke uttejk, jahaan unka puraa abhaav he, donon se alag kaaryashiltaa kii shrenee main he
 In addition, cocaine also has some binding targets at the kappa-opioid receptor site
 kokene, vahikasankirnan kaa bhi kaaran banataa he, is prakaar laghu shalyachikitsa kii prakriyaaon ke dauraan rakt bahaav ko kam karata he
 The properties of cocaine to increase speed can be attributed to the increase of dopaminergic transmission from its substratum nigra
 haal ke shodh kokene ke prabhaavon main circadian tantra or clock jin kii ek mahatvapurn bhoomika ko ingit karte hai
 Since nicotine increases the level of dopamine in the brain, many cocaine users feel that using tobacco products during cocaine use increases the excitement
 is tareeke ke tathaapi, avaanchhneeya parinaam ho sakate hai, jaise kokene ke istemaal ke dauraan bekaabu satat dhumrapaan, jo tambaakoo kii vajah se swasthya par hanikaarak prabhaavon or hriday pranali par atirikt jor ke alaava hota he
 In addition to irritability, mood disturbances, restlessness, paranoia and hearing hallucinations, cocaine use can lead to a number of dangerous physical conditions
 yah hriday gati or dil ke daure main gadabadi paidaa kar saktaa he or saath hi saath seene main dard yaa saans ko tod saktaa he
 In addition, paralysis, seizures, and headaches are common in heavy users
 kokene aksar bhojan kii khuraaq ko kam kar detaa he, kai puraane upyogkartaaon kii bhukh kho jaati he or gambhir kuposhan or vajan main ghataav kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 Also under the influence of cocaine, an increase is seen for the user, when used in conjunction with new surroundings and stimuli, in other words new environments
 kokene kaa bade paimaane par upaapachay hota he, mukhya rup se jigar main, mutr main keval 1% aparivartit hokar nikalataa he
 Metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage, so the depleted metabolites consist mostly of the major metabolite benzoylegonin, and to a lesser extent other important metabolites such as igonin methyl ester and igonin
 Further, small metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine, p-hydroxycokine, m-hydroxycokine, p-hydroxybenzoylegonone, and m-hydroxybenzoylegonone
 These do not include metabolites made in the human body beyond the standard metabolism of the drug, for example by the pyrolysis process, as in the case of methylgonidine
 jigar or gurde kii kriyaaon ke aadhaar par, kokene metabolites mutr main khoje ja sakate hai
 Benzoylegonine can be found in urine within four hours after cocaine intake, and in concentrations greater than 150 ng / ml, typically up to eight days after cocaine intake

 If consumed with alcohol, cocaine combines with alcohol to form cocaethylene in the liver
 adhyayan se pataa chalata he cocaithalin, ullasonmad prerak or khud kokene kii tulana main isamen hriday sambandhi vishaaktata adhik he
 a study done on mice has shown that capsaicin found in pepper spray can cause fatal results when combined with cocaine
 jis vidhi ke madhyam se ve parsparik kriya karte hai vah gyaat nahin he
 Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant
 iskaa prabhaav seven karne kii paddati ke aadhaar par 15-30 minute se lekar ek ghante tak rah saktaa he
 Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of happiness and excitement, energy and dynamic activity, feelings of ability and sexuality
 khel-kud ke pradarshan ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Anxiety, paranoia and restlessness are also found
 atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, kaanpana, akshep or sharir main taapmaana vruddhi dekhi jaati he
 The health problems caused by the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are far greater than the health problems caused by cocaine use
 kokene kaa kabhi-kabhaar istemaal, aam taur par gambhir yaa maamuli shaareerik athwa saamaajik samasyaon ko prerit nahin karata he
 With excessive or prolonged use, this drug can cause itching, tachycardia, hallucinations, and paranoia
 Excessive doses cause rapid heart rate and a significant increase in blood pressure
 yah praan ghaatak ho saktaa he, khaskar yadi upyogkarta ko hriday kii maujuuda samasya he
 The LD50 of cocaine when given intraperitoneum to mice is 95
1 mg / kg

 Heat loss is controlled by rapid vasoconstriction
 kokene prerit atitaap, mansapeshi koshika kaa vinaash kar sakati he or myoglobinuriya ko badhaakar gurde kii vifaltaa ko prerit kar sakati he
 Emergency treatment often involves a benzodiazepine analgesic agent, such as diazepam, to lower the elevated heart rate and blood pressure
 shaareerik thandak or peracetamol ko atitaap ke ilaaj ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki anya jatiltaaon ke liye vishisht upachaar viksit kiye jate hai
 There is no officially approved antidote for the treatment of cocaine overdose, and although some drugs such as dexmedetomadine and rimcazole have been found to be useful in animal studies in the treatment of cocaine overdose, no formal human trials have been conducted
 aise maamalon main jahaan ek rogi ilaaj main asamarth yaa anicchhuk he, kokene adhimaatra se hone vaale halke-maamuli kshiprahridayata kaa upachaar, shuru main maukhik rup se 20 mg diagepam yaa uske samakaksh ke benjodigepine ko khilaa kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Acetaminophen and physical coolant can likewise be used to reduce mild hyperthermia

 It would probably not be wrong to say that Graham Bell spent his entire life working for deaf people

 kuch samay tak ve spich technology vishay ke teacher bhi rahe the
 During this time, he continued his efforts and was successful in creating an instrument that was capable of sending not only musical notes, but also articulated speech
 yahi telephone kaa sabase purana model tha
 As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father
 ek kam umr main, haalanki, unhone kaha ki vah keval pehle chaar roopon ko puraa karne, skool 15 saal kii umr main chhod diya he jo royal hai skool, edinburgh, scotland, main namankit kiya gaya tha
