 Puranpoli is made from sweet pitti made by boiling gram lentils in sugar syrup
 yah pitthee hi bharaavan hota he jisamen jaifal, ilaychi, kesar or yathasambhav mewa daal kar suswaadu banaaya jaataa he
 a pinch of turmeric can also be added to it
 chunki ise hi maida yaa aate kii loi main puraa yaa bharaa jaataa he isliye pooran naam mila
 The word Pooran is made from the complete metal of Sanskrit which means to fill up, complete, etc
 chunki upar tak bharaa hona hi sampoorn hona he so pooran main santushtikaarak bhav bhi hai
 Marathi is the word for bread
 bhav hua bharwaan roti
 The word 'poli' is derived from the pul metal which contains a sense of expansion, dispersion and protection, thus the meaning of the word 'poli' is spread

 Netscape Communications is an American computer services company, originally known for web browsers
 jab yah ek swatantra company thi, iskaa mukhyalay mountain vyuu, california main tha
 The name Netscape was a trademark of Cisco Systems, which was given to the company
 ek samay khapat hisse kii drushti se netscape kaa web brouzar kaaphi prabhavi tha, lekin pratham brouzar yuddh ke dauraan usne adhikansh hisse ko internet explorer ke haathon ganvaa diya
 By the end of 2006, the consumption share of the Netscape browser had been exhausted and decreased from more than 90% to less than 1% in the mid-1990s
 online sanchaar ke liye netscape ne secor socket layer protocol kaa vikaas kiya tha, jiskaa istemaal abhi bhi vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he, saath hi web pejes ke client-site scrypting ke liye vyapak rup se istemaal kiye janaa vaala javascript ko bhi viksit kiya tha
 Later, Netscape stock was traded between 1995 and 2003 as a subsidiary of AOL
 haalanki, eoel ke 1998 main netscape ko kharid lene ke baad yah ek holding company ban gai
 The Netscape brand is still largely used by AOL
 vartmaan main web broujar ke alaava kuch sevaayen netscape brands ke tahat pradaan kii jaati hai, jisamen discount internet seva pradaata or ek lokapriy saamaajik samachar website shaamil he
 In December 2007, AOL announced that the Netscape browser would no longer be updated
 aol's director of Netscape Tom Drapeau announced that by March 1, 2008, the company would discontinue support for the Netscape software product
 The decision received mixed reactions by communities, although many argued that the decision to terminate product support was taken too late
 internet suraksha kii site, security watch ne kaha ki eoel ke netscape ke liye viral suraksha adhyatan kii pravriti ke kaaran yah broujar "suraksha daayitv" ban gaya, vishesh rup se 2005-2007 sanskaran, netscape brouzar 8

 Others petitioned Aeol to continue providing critical security for its software to loyal users
 netscape aisi duusari company thi jisane navjaat world wide web ko bhunaane kaa prayaas kiya
 It was originally founded on April 4, 1994, under the name of Mosaic Communications Corporation, with Jim Clarke, who in his mind recruited Mark Andreeson as co-founder, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as an investor Had
 clark ne SGI or NCSA mosek se praarambhik netscape team ke anya sadasyon kii bhartee kii jisamen rosanne sino shaamil the jo vaais president of communications bane
 The company's first product was a web browser, called Netscape Mosaic 0
9, and was released on 13 October 1994
 is brouzar kaa naam baad main netscape nevigator rakhaa gaya or company ne NCSA ke saath trademark swaamitv samasyaon se bachane ke liye 14 navambar 1994 ko netscape naam grahan kiya jahaan praarambhik netscape karmchaariyon ne NCSA mosek web broujar kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The Mosaic Netscape web browser with NCSA permission used some NCSA mosaic code, as noted in the application's "about" dialog box
 netscape ne 9 agast 1995 ko bahut hi safal ipo nikaala
 stock ko prati share 14 dollar main pesh kiya janaa tha
 However, a last minute decision was made to double the initial offer to $ 28 per share
 share kaa mulya pratham din $75 badha diya gaya, pehle din ke laabh ke liye lagbhag ek ricard ban gaya
 The company's revenue doubled per quarter in 1995
 netscape kii safalataa se anderson ko time patrika ke cover par nange paanv dikhaaya gaya
 Netscape advertised "the web is for everyone" and stated one of its aims as "level the playing field" by providing a consistent web browsing experience between operating systems
 kisi bhi computer par netscape web brouzar antarfalak ek samaan tha
 Netscape later experimented with prototype of a web-based system that would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere within the network, no matter which computer or operating system they use
 
 is chiz par microsoft kaa dhyaan gaya, jisane oparating system ko utpaada banaae jane ko ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha, yani, windos ko chhodkar anya oparating system ko apnaane se samaan browzing anubhav hasil honge or is prakaar badalane ke liye baadhaaen kam hongi
 aarope he ki kai microsoft ke adhikariyon ne market ko vibhajit karne ke saude ke liye june 1995 main netscape parisar kaa daura kiya jo ki windos ke liye microsoft ko web broujar software banane kii anumati degaa jabaki netscape ke liye anya sabhi oparating system ko chhod degaa
 Netscape refused the offer
 microsoft ne windos 95 plus pack aid on ke hisse ke rup main internet explorer ke 1
0 sanskaran ko jari kiya
 According to former telescope developer Eric Sink, Internet Explorer was not generally considered to be based on the NCSA mosaic, but is believed to be on a version of the mosaic developed on the telescope
 microsoft ne jaldi se internet explorer ke lagaataar kai sanskarnon ko jari kiya, unhen windos ke saath baandh diya or uske liye kabhi koi keemat nahin lee, company ke anya kshetron ke rajasav se unke vikaas or vipanan ko vittposhit kiya
 This time period is known as browser warfare, with Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer adding several new features and releasing multiple version numbers in an attempt to outdo each other
 lekin internet explorer kaa palada baari tha, kyonki jitani janashakti or puunji isamen lagaai gai thi usne antat netscape ke puure kaarobaar main uplabdh sansadhano ko paar kar diya
 By version 3
0, IE was almost identical in terms of features to Netscape Communicator, and by version 4
0, it was generally considered to be stable on Windows rather than on the Macintosh platform
 microsoft ne muft samanta ke saath netscape ke anya utpaadon ko bhi lakshith kiya, jaise internet information sarwar ke rup main, ek web sarwar jo ki windos anti ke saath judaa hua tha
 Netscape could not compete with this strategy
 vastav main, isane pratispardhaa karne kaa prayaas hi nahin kiya
 Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998, while Internet Explorer and IIS were always free or associated with an operating system and / or other applications
 is bich, netscape ko apane utpaadon main badhate hue bag ke liye kaaphi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa; aalochakon ne daawa kiya ki 'company jatilta se peedit he - nae suvidhaon ko jodne ke prayaas ko prathamikta di ja rahi thi lekin unke thik se kaam na karne par dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This was especially true with Netscape Navigator 2, the only product available on the market for the first five months of 1996 that was replaced with Netscape Navigator 3
 janata kii raay main, jisane microsoft ke goliath kii tulana main netscape kii david ke rup main saraahna kii thi, use teji se nakaar diya, khaskar jab netscape ne 1997 main pratham kharaab timahi kaa anubhav kiya or janvari 1998 main naapsand ke daur se guzar rahaa tha
 Netscape Chief Financial Officer Peter Curry described the mid-1990s as tuberculosis and paranoid and destroyed the company both internally and externally
 janvari 1998 maah main bhi netscape ne open sorce mozila pariyojna kii shuruuaat kii
 Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 4
0 in the hope that it would become a popular open source project
 This allowed the code to publicly continue under the Netscape Public License, which was similar to the GNU General Public License but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing publicly issued code
 haalanki, is tarah se communicator 4
0 code jari rahaa, netscape communicator 4
5 main kaary karne laga jisamen email main sudhaar or udhyam kaaryakshmata par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya tha
 It eventually became clear that the Communicator 4
0 browser was difficult to develop and open source development was halted on this codebase
 iske bajaay, open sorce vikaas ko scrtch dwaara nirmit ek agali peedi ke broujar ke liye sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 Using the newly built Gecko layout engine, this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 4
0 and was therefore easily developed with a large number of programs
 saath hi isamen ek XML upyogkarta interphes bhashaa shaamil thi jiskaa naam XUL tha jo ki windos, messintosh or linaks main ek upyogkarta interphes ke ekal vikaas kii anumati detii he
 The United States Department of Justice filed an anti-trust case against Microsoft in May 1998
 is maamle main netscape ek abhiyojak nahin tha haalanki iske adhikariyon ne samman jari kiya tha or yah maamle main isse sambandhit kaaphi maatra main saamagree kaa yogadan kiya jisamen bure manovriti aatanrik charchaa forum kaa samgr saamagree shaamil tha
 In October 1998, Netscape acquired the web directory site newhoo for $ 1 million and renamed it the Open Directory Project and released its database under an open content license
 24 navambar 1998 ko america online ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah is ghoshnaa ke samay netscape communications ko tex-free stock-swap ke tahat $4
2 billian main adhigrahan karegaa
 The merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures would probably not fit; a prominent critic in its criticisms was longtime Netscape developer Jamie Zawinski
 is adhigrahan ko eoel dwaara internet explorer web brouzar par kam nirbhar banane ke ek maarg ke rup main microsoft ke khilaaf ek saudebaaji chip hasil karne kaa zariyaa dekha gaya
 Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter or the Netscape Web property, which had the most traffic worldwide
 aakhirkaar, netscape ke sarwar utpaadon or uske vyavsaayik sevaayen samooh iplanet kaa ek hissaa ban gai, jo ki ek sanyukt vipanan or eoel or san microsystems ke bich gathbandhan or vikaas tha
 On November 14, 2000, AOL released Netscape 6 based on Mozilla 0
6 source code
 
 Unfortunately, 0
6 Mozilla was not stable and so Netscape 6 drove people a bit further away from the Netscape brand
 yah agast 2001 tak netscape 6
1 jari hui jo ki mozila 0
9
2 par aadhaarit thi or kaaphi adhik majboot thi
 a year later came Netscape 7
0 which is based on Mozilla 1
0 core
 microsoft antitrust maamle main is khulaase ke baad ki microsoft ne ekadhikaar shakti kaa durupyog kar rahaa tha, eoel ne kshatipurti ke liye iske khilaaf mukadmaa daayar kiya
 The case was settled in May 2003 when Microsoft paid AOL $ 750 million and agreed to share some of the technology with a license to use and further distribute Internet Explorer royalty-free for seven years to AOL
 Is included
 ise netscape ke liye maut kii soochna dene ke rup main mana gaya tha
 On 15 July 2003, Time Warner terminated Netscape
 adhikansh programmeron ko naukari se nikaal diya gaya or netscape logo ko imaarat se hataa diya gaya
 However, the Netscape 7
2 web browser was released by AOL on 18 August 2004
 red hat ne 30 sitambar 2004 ko ghoshit kiya ki inhone netscape enterprise suite ke adhikansh bhaag kaa adhigrahan kar liya he or red hat enterprise linaks ke saath ek open sorce utpaada se judane main parivartit karne kii yojana kar rahi thi
 On June 1, 2005, Red Hat released Fedora Directory Server
 12 oktober 2004 main lokapriy website develper netscape davees ko eoel dwaara band kar diya gaya
 devedge was a core resource for Internet-related technology, maintaining definitive documentation on the Netscape browser, documentation on assistive technologies such as HTML and javascript, and popular articles written by industry and technology authors such as Danny Goodman
 davees ke kuch saamagree ko mozila website par punarprakashit kiya gaya he
 The Netscape brand name continued to be used extensively
 company ke paas ek baar phir se apni hi programing karmchaaree the jo ki web brouzaron ke shrinkhalaa kii sahaayta or vikaas ke liye patibaddh the
 Additionally, Netscape maintained the Propeller Web Portal, a popular social-news site similar to Digg, which was given a new shape in June 2006
 eoel ne netscape brands ke tahat ek discount aiespi seva kaa vipanan kiya
 Netscape Navigator 9, a new version of the Netscape browser based on Firefox 2, was released in October 2007
 isamen ek chikne hare or slate antarfalak kii visheshta thi
 In November 2007, IE had 77
4% of the browser market, Firefox 16
0% and Netscape 0
6%, according to Net Applications, an Internet metrics firm
 28 disambar 2007 main eoel ne ghoshnaa kii ki 1 farvari 2008 ko yah netscape web brouzar ke liye samarthan chhod degi or ab nayi relies ko viksit nahin karegi
 The date was later extended to 1 March to include major security updates and a tool to help users migrate to other browsers
 in atirikt suvidhaon main netscape nevigator 9 ke antim sanskaran ko 20 farvari 2008 main jari karnaa shaamil tha
 Netscape Navigator was a web browser from versions 1
0–4
8 of Netscape
 pehla beta sanskaran ko 1994 main jari kiya gaya tha or use mosek kaha gaya or baad main mosek netscape
 uske baad, neshnal centre for superkamputing aplikeshan se ek kanoonee chunauti ke kaaran netscape ke kai sansthaapakon jo ise viksit karte the, netscape nevigator naam ko apnaane kii ore bade
 company kaa naam bhi mosek communications corporation se netscape communications corporation kar diya gaya
 This browser was the most advanced available at the time and so it became an instant success, causing it to become the king of the market but still in beta
 1
0 sanskaran ke jari hone ke baad netscape ke feechar-count or market share nirantar teji se badhata rahaa
 Version 2
0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a mere web browser to an Internet suite
 email client kaa mukhya visisth feechar tha HTML ko dikhaane kii isaki kshamta
 is avadhi ke dauraan is suut ko netscape nevigator kaha jaataa tha
 Netscape's version 3
0 was the first version to face any serious competition from the creation of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3
0
 lekin netscape aasaani se kuch samay ke liye number ek brouzar bana rahaa
 Netscape also released a gold version that included javascript RSA security and an Apple Inc
 quicktime decoder
 netscape 4 ne netscape nevigator kii samasya ko sambodhit kiya jise suut ke dono naam main istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha or suut kaa punah namakaran netscape communicator karne ke dwaara broujar iske bheetar shaamil tha
 After five preview releases in 1996–1997, Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997
 yah sanskaran kam yaa zyada netscape nevigator 3 code par aadhaarit tha or iskaa adhyatan rup tha or nai suvidhaon ko isamen joda gaya tha
 The new suite was successful despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer 4
0 and problems with older browser cores
 IE, 4
5 sanskaran tak mike platfarm par dhimi or asthir tha
 Despite this, Apple agreed to an agreement with Microsoft to make Eye the default browser on the new Mac OS installation, another blow to Netscape's reputation
 netscape nevigate, netscape mail and newsgrup, netscape adress book or netscape compoger se komunicator suut ko banaaya gaya tha
 In January 1998, Netscape Communicator Corporation announced that all possible versions of its software would be available for free and developed by the open source community, Mozilla
 Netscape Communicator 5
0 was announced
 haalanki, isaki relies ko kaaphi der se kiya gaya tha or isi bich internet explorer ke nae sanskaran jari hue the, jisaki shuruuaat sanskaran 4 se kii gai
 These had more features than the old Netscape, including support for HTML 4, CSS, DOM and ecmascript
 or adhik unnat internet explorer 5
0 market main leader ban gaya
 In October 1998, Netscape Communicator 4
5 was released
 isamen vibhinn kaaryakshmata main sudhaar kiya gaya, vishesh kar mail and newsgrup ghatak main, lekin broujar kor ko adhyatan nahin kiya gaya tha jisaki kaaryakshmata us 4
08 sanskaran ke liye anivaary thi
 a month later, Netscape Communications Corporation was purchased by AOL
 navambar main, netscape 5
0 par kaam ko radd kar diya gaya or scrtch se puri tarah ek nae kaam ke vikaas par jor diya gaya
 In 1998, an informal group called the Mozilla Organization and largely funded by Netscape was actually to coordinate the development of Netscape 5, which was based on communicator source code
 haalanki, aging communicator code saath kaam karne ke liye mushkil sabit hua or scrap netscape 5 ke liye or sorce code ko phir se likhane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 The re-written source code was in the form of Mozilla web browser which was Netscape 6 based with some additional features
 is faisle kaa matlab tha ki netscape kaa agle mukhya sanskaran kaa kaaphi der se jari hona
 isi bich, netscape ko eoel dwaara le liya gaya tha jo web maanak pariyojna se kaaphi dabaav main kaam kar rahi thi, jiske chalate 2000 main iske nae divijan ko netscape 6
0 ko jari karne ke liye baadhya thi
 In addition to the built-in AOL instant messenger client, Netscape Instant Messenger, the suite once again included Netscape Navigator and other Communicator components
 However, it was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly
 yah mozila 0
6 par aadhaarit thi, jo ki kai gambhir bags ke chalate saamaanya janata dwaara abhi tak istemaal ke liye taiyaar nahin thi jiske chalate aksar cras yaa web prishthon kaa dhire-dhire rendor hona ho saktaa tha
 Later versions of Netscape 6 were much better, but still struggled to make a browser impact on the depressed community
 netscape 7
0 ko agast 2002 main jari kiya gaya jo ki bahut hi samaan ghatakon ke saath netscape 6 kaa sidhi nirantarata thi
 It attracted some users, but was still a minority browser
 haalanki yah lokapriy radio@netscape internet radio client ke saath ai
 eoel ne netscape 7

 netscape ne bhi browder suut kii ek nayaa eoel-muft-sanskaran kii shuruyaat kii
 Netscape 7

 2003 main, eoel ne apni netscape divijan ko band kar diya or netscape ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko naukari se nikaal diya yaa punah saunpa
 Mozilla
 org jari rahaa, haalanki ek swatantra mozila foundation hone ke naate netscape ke kai purv karmchaariyon kii bhartee karne laga
 AOL continued the development work of the in-house Netscape, but with little to no committed staff, the improvement was minimal
 ek saal baad mozila par aadhaarit antim sanskaran agast 2004 main jari hua: mozila 1
7
2 ke aadhaar par netscape 7
2
 The Netscape 7 Series speculation of the suit came out after an official election was advertised on the Netscape Community Support Board in late 2006, supported and updated by Netscape's in-house development team
 aisa nahin hona tha
 Between 2005 and 2007, the released version of Netscape is known as Netscape Browser
 eoel ne apekshaakrit safalataa praapt mozila fyrafox ko netscape brouzar ke liye aadhaar ke rup main chunaa, yah mozila foundation dwaara ek punarlikhit mozila sanskaran he
 It is not a complete Internet suite as before but only a web browser
 anya vivaadaaspad faislon main keval microsoft windos ke liye is brouzar ko bananaa or purv main jari hue donon geko rendoring ingine kii suvidha or internet explorer main trident ingine kaa istemaal shaamil hai
 The Netscape Communications acquisition of AOL in November 1998 was less of a surprise when the company fired the Netscape team and outsourced development to Mercurial Communications
 netscape brouzar 8

 windos, linaks or mike oes eks ke bich browder ko multi-platfarm samarthan par vaapasi karte hue bhi dekha gaya
 Like the 8
x version of Netscape, the new release was based on the popular Mozilla Firefox and presumably provided full support for all Firefox add-ons and plugins, some of which already provided Netscape
 saath hi 2004 ke baad se pehali baar ke liye apane swayan ke karmchaariyon ke saath brouzar kaa utpaadan in-house kiya gaya
 a beta of the program was first released on 5 June 2007
 antim sanskaran ko 15 oktober 2007 ko jari kiya gaya
 AOL officially announced that Navigator Netscape will conclude on March 1, 2008 and recommends that its users download the Flock or Firefox browser, both based on the same technology
 11 june 2007 main netscape ne ghoshnaa kii ki nevigator 9 ke saath-saath hone vaala ek stand-alon email / samachar client netscape mercury he
 Mercury was based on Mozilla Thunderbird
 is utpaada ko baad main punah namakaran karte hue netscape massenger 9 rakhaa gaya or ek alpha sanskaran ko jari kiya gaya
 In December 2007, AOL announced the development of Netscape with Messenger 9, as well as Navigator 9 being canceled
 netscape ke praarambhik utpaada shrinkhalaa main shaamil hai: Later Netscape products include: netscape ne javascript web pej scrypting bhashaa banaaya
 It has also been a pioneer in the development of "push technology", which effectively allows the Web site to continuously send information directly to the user's desktop; This implementation of Netscape is called Netcaster
 durbhaagya se, kaarobaar ne jaldi hi upyogkarta kii sahaayta ke liye push praudyogiki ke upyog kii manyata praapt kar lee thi or naaraaz upyogkarta is suvidha ko band kar diya, isliye netcaster alpakaalik hi rahaa
 Netscape was notable for its cross-platform effort
 isaki client software windos messintosh, linaks, OS / 2, beos unics ke kai sanskaran sahit DEC, san solaaris, BSDI, IRIX, IBM AIX or HP-UX ke liye uplabdhta jari he
 Its server software was generally only available for Unix and Windows NT, although some of its servers were made available on Linux and a version of Netscape fasttrack Server was made available for Windows 95 / 98
 aaj, netscape ke adhikansh sarwar san java system, jo ki purv main san van branding ke tahat tha, ke rup main live on pesh kar rahi he
 Although Netscape Browser 8 was Windows only, multi-platform support exists in the Netscape Navigator 9 series of browsers
 netscape aiespi ek 56 kbit / s-dial-ap seva he jise $9
95 prati maheene par seva pradaan kii jaati he 
 The company serves web pages in a compressed format for incremental effective speeds of up to 1300 kbit / s
 netscape brands ke tahat eoel dwaara internet seva pradaata ko chalaaya jaataa he
 The low-cost ISP was officially launched on 8 January 2004
 iskaa mukhya pratidwandvi netgero he
 The general purpose of Netscape isp's advertising is a small demographic, eg, college students and people who have passed away immediately from school, a common affordable way to use the Internet
 web exilrator text ko uske mul aakaar se lagbhag 4% purv-sampeedit kar detaa he or is prakaar prabhavi thruput ko 1300 kbit / s kar detaa he
 Also, this accelerator precompresses Flash executables and images by about 30% and 10% respectively
 netscape ise "niyamit phone line par dsel gati" ke rup main vigyaapit karata he haalanki aise hi gati keval web browzing main simit hoti he jisamen filon kii dowloding nahin hoti he
 Another drawback of this approach is the loss in quality, where the graphics become heavily solid and stained, but the speed increases dramatically so that web pages load in less than 5 seconds
 netscape hameshaa iske web propaties ke liye broujar menu main shaamil kai linkon se kaaphi treffic ho jate hai
 Some people say that it was late to capitalize on this traffic which later became the beginning of the major online portal war

 The Hindu people consider the Ganges river as sacred as mother and goddess
 hinduon dwaara devi rupi is nadi kii puja kii jaati he kyonki unka vishwaas he ki isamen snaan karne se saare paap dhul jate hai or jivan-maran ke chakra se mukti mil jaati he
 Pilgrims travel long distances to immerse the ashes of their families in the waters of the Ganges so that their loved ones can go directly to heaven
 haridwar, ilahabaad or varanasi jaise hinduon ke kai pavitra sthaan ganga nadi ke tat par hi sthit hai
 During Thailand's Loy Krathong festival, candles are burnt in boats in honor of Buddha and Goddess Ganga to get good luck and wash away sins
 ganga kii utpatti ke vishay main hinduon main anek manyataayen hai
 According to one belief, the water of Lord Brahma's kamandal appeared in the form of a woman named Ganga
 ek anya katha ke anusaar brahmaji ne vishnuji ke charnon ko aadar sahit dhoyaa or us jal ko apane kamandal main ekatra kar liya
 According to a third belief, Ganga is the daughter of King Himwan of the mountains and his wife Meena, thus she is also the sister of Goddess Parvati
 prayek manyata main yah avashya aata he ki unka paalan-poshan swarg main brahma ji ke sangrakshan main hua
 Many years later, a king named Sagara magically had sixty thousand sons
 ek din raja sagar ne apane samrajya kii samruddhi ke liye ek anushthan karavaaya
 An horse was an integral part of the ritual which Indra stole enviously
 sagar ne us ashv kii khoj ke liye apane sabhi putron ko prithvi ke chaaron taraf bhej diya
 He found it near the meditative Kapil sage in Patalalok
 yah maanate hue ki us ashv ko kapil rishi dwaara hi churaayaa gaya he, ve unka apmaan karne lage or unki tapasya ko bhang kar diya
 The sage opened his eyes for the first time in many years and saw Sagara's sons
 is drushtipaat se ve sabhi ke sabhi saath hajaar jalakar bhasma ho gaye
 The souls of the sons of Sagara started wandering as ghosts due to not performing the last rites
 jab dilip ke putr or sagar ke ek vanshaj bhageerath ne is durbhaagya ke bare main suna to unhone pratigya kii ki ve ganga ko prithvi par laayenge taaki uske jal se sagar ke putron ke paap dhul saken or unhen moksh praapt ho sake
 Bhagirath did penance of Brahma to bring Ganga to earth
 brahma ji maan gaye or ganga ko aadesh diya ki vah prithvi par jaye or vahaan se patallok jaye taaki bhageerath ke vanshajon ko moksh praapt ho sake
 Ganga found it very humiliating and decided that she would fall from heaven to earth with full speed and take it away
 tab bhageerath ne ghabaraakar shivaji se prarthana kii ki ve ganga ke veg ko kam kar den
 Ganga started falling on Shiva's head with arrogance
 lekin shiv ji ne shanti purvak use apni jataaon main baandh liya or keval uski choti-choti dhaaraon ko hi baahar nikalne diya
 Ganga became more sacred by receiving the touch of Shiva
 patallok kii taraf jaati hui ganga ne prithvi par bahane ke liye ek anya dhara kaa nirmaan kiya taaki abhaage logon kaa uddhaar kiya ja sake
 The Ganges is the only river that flows in the three worlds - heaven, earth, and hell
 isliye sanskrit bhashaa main use "tripathga" kaha jaataa he
 Due to the efforts of Bhagiratha as Ganga came to earth, she is also called Bhagirathi; And the term "bhagirathi endeavor" is used to describe adventurous efforts and difficult achievements
 ganga ko jahnavi naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is said that when Ganga was moving towards Bhagiratha after her arrival on earth, the velocity of her water caused quite a stir and destroyed the cultivation of Jahnu and his fields
 isse krodhit hokar unhone ganga ke samast jal ko pi liya
 The gods then prayed to Jahnu to release Ganga so that he could proceed for his work
 unki prarthana se prasann hokar jaahnu ne ganga ke jal ko apane kaan ke raste se bah jane diya
 Thus Ganga got the name "jahnavi"
 aisi manyata he ki saraswati nadi ke samaan hi, kalyug ke ant tak ganga puri tarah se suukh jaayegi or uske saath hi yah yug bhi samaapt ho jaayegaa
 After that, the golden age will rise
 skanda puraana jaise hindu granthon ke anusaar, devi ganga kartikeya kii sauteli mata hai; kartikeya vastav main shiv or parvati kaa ek putr he
 Parvati created the image of Ganesha through her physical defects, but Ganesha came alive after drowning in the holy waters of the Ganges
 isliye kaha jaataa he ki ganesh kii do maatayen hai-parvati or ganga or isiilie unhen dvimatra tathaa gangey bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to Brahma Vaivarta Purana 2
6
13-95, Vishnu has three wives who are always at loggerheads, so in the end he only kept Lakshmi with him and sent Ganga to Shiva and Saraswati to Brahma
 
 hinduon ke mahakavy mahabharat main kaha gaya he ki vashishtha dwaara shraapit vasuon ne ganga se prarthana kii thi ki ve unki mata ban jaaen
 Ganga descended on Earth and became the wife of King Shantanu on the condition that she would never question him, otherwise she would leave him
 The seven Vasus were born as their sons and Ganga poured them all one by one into their waters, thus liberating them from their curse
 is samay tak raja shantnu ne koi aapatti nahin kii
 Ultimately the birth of the eighth son did not stop the king and he opposed his wife, so Ganga left him
 is prakaar aathven putr ke rup main janma dyos maanav rupi nashwar sharir main hi funskar jivit rah gaya or baad main mahabharat ke sarvaadhik sammanit paatro main se ek bhishma ke naam se janaa gaya
 The mention of Ganga definitely comes in the Rigveda, the most ancient and theoretically most sacred book of Hindus
 ganga kaa ullekh nadistuti main kiya gaya he, jisame purv se pashchim kii ore bahane vaali nadiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 The Ganges is also mentioned in RV 6
45
31, but it is not clear that the river itself is referred to here
 rugveda 3
58
6 main likhaa gaya he "aapkaa pracheen ghar, aapaki pavitra mitrataa, he veeron, aapaki sampatti jahnavi ke tat par he"
 This verse probably points to the Ganges
 aarvi 1

18-19 main jahnavi tathaa ganga kii dolfan kaa ullekh lagaataar do chhandon main kiya gaya he
 Many mythological stories are associated with the river Ganges
 inamen raja sagar kii katha or mithkon ke anusaar brahma ne vishnu ke pair ke paseenon kii boondon se ganga ke janm kii kathaon ke atirikt anya kathaayen bhi kaafii rochak hai
 According to another legend, King Sagar magically acquired sixty thousand sons
 ek din raja sagar ne devloak par vijay praapt karne ke liye ek yajna kiya
 The horse was necessary for the yagna which jealous Indra stole
 sagar ne apane saare putron ko ghode kii khoj main bhej diya ant main unhen ghoda pataal lok main mila jo ek rishi ke sameep bandhaa tha
 Sagara's sons insulted the sage, thinking that the sage was the reason for the horse's disappearance
 tapasya main leen rishi ne hajaaron varsh baad apni ankhen kholi or unke krodh se sagar ke sabhi saath hajaar putr jal kar vahiin bhasma ho gayi
 The souls of the sons of Sagar started wandering as ghosts because they were not cremated
 sagar ke putr anshuman ne atmaaon kii mukti kaa asafal prayaas kiya or baad main anshuman ke putr dilip ne bhi
 Bhagiratha was the son of King Dileep's second wife
 unhone apane purvajon kaa antim sanskaar kiya
 He pledged to bring the Ganges to Earth so that the ashes of his rites flow into the Ganges water and the wandering souls can go to heaven
 bhageerath ne brahma kii ghor tapasya kii taaki ganga ko prithvi par laayaa ja sake
 Brahma was pleased and agreed to send Ganga to earth and ordered Ganga to go to earth and then to Hades so that the souls of the sons of Sagara could be liberated
 tab ganga ne kaha ki main itani oonchai se jab prithvi par giruungi, to prithvi itnaa veg kaise sah paaegi? tab bhageerath ne bhagwaan shiv se nivedan kiya or unhone apni khuli jataaon main ganga ke veg ko roak kar, ek lat khol di, jisase ganga kii aviral dhara prithvi par pravaahit hui
 The stream followed Bhagiratha to the Ganges Sagar Sangam, where the sons and sons were saved
 shiv ke sparsh se ganga or bhi paavan ho gayi or prithvi vaasiyon ke liye bahut hi shraddha kaa kendra ban gayin
 According to the Puranas, Ganga is called Mandakini in heaven and Bhagirathi in Patala
 bharatvansh main shantanu naamak bade pratapi raja the
 One day while playing the game on the banks of the Ganges, he was seen Ganga Devi
 shantanu ne usase vivaah karnaa chaha
 Ganga accepted it on the condition that the king would not ask any question about what she would do
 shantanu se ganga ko ek ke baad ek saat putr hue
 But Ganga Devi threw them all into the river
 raja ne is vishay main unase koi prashn nahin kiya
 Later, when he was born the eighth son, Shantanu objected to throwing him into the river
 is prakaar ganga ko diya gaya unka vachan tut gaya or ganga ne apana vivaah radd kar swarg chali gayin
 While passing by, he promised Shantanu that she would raise her child and return to Shantanu
 ek prafullit sundari yuvati kaa janm brahmadev ke kamandal se hua
 There are two thoughts about this special birth
 ek kii manyata he ki vaaman rup main rakshas bali se sansar ko mukt karaane ke baad brahmadev ne bhagwaan vishnu kaa charan dhoyaa or is jal ko apane kamandal main bhar liya
 The second is related to Lord Shiva who saved the raga-ragini suffering from the misuse of music
 jab bhagwaan shiv ne naarad muni brahmadev tathaa bhagwaan vishnu ke samaksh gaanaa gaaya to is sangeet ke prabhaav se bhagwaan vishnu kaa pasinaa bahakar nikalne laga jo brahma ne use apane kamandal main bhar liya
 Ganga was born from the water of this kamandal and she started living in heaven under the protection of Brahma
 ganga, ek nadi hi nahin, bhartiya samskruti kii ek gauravshaalee sarita he
 Some 108 names like Devanadi, Jahnavi, Vishnupada, Shivashishadharini are of this river
 ‘mahabhagwat’ main ‘ganga ashtottarashat namavali’ milti he
 It is due to the virtue of this river that from Patki to Patki, there is immersion in this river from death to death
 yah aisi nadi he jiskaa zikr rugveda se lekar vartmaan sahitya tak main mil jaataa he
 Due to the influence of the tenacity of King Bhagiratha, it became a rage from Alaknanda and washed the Kalikalush of India
 ganga dashahra yaa gangadashami kaa parv 10veen sadi purv se hi manaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Bhojraj has commemorated this day in 'rajmandand' as a festival for the prevention of decapacities
 jo das paap hare, vah yah parv he
 These sins have been first mentioned by Manu in his memory, which have been cited by other Puranas, sub-writers as well as 'skanda Puranakara'
 murtikla main ganga kii abhivyakti nai nahin he
 As a woman, the river began to be engraved in the form of Kalashdharini heroine
 visheshkar dwarshakha ke neeche murtimay rup main ganga kaa nyaas miltaa he
 This river form in many forms and in many expressions, indicates the presence of the devotees of the temple to sin-free, Kalushaharini
 ek ore yamuna, duusari ore ganga
 These are also considered to be a confluence of western and eastern cultures
 koi bhi bhashaa, dharm-vichaar ho, yahaan antat: ekta kaa darshan hota he
 Therefore, the culture of India is also called ganga-jamni
