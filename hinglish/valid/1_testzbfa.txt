 The show returned eight years later with its second season
 jahaan pehle sizan main yah sho kanya bhrun hatya par aadhaarit tha, is baar kahani main mahilaon kii kareed-farokht or unke shoshan jaise gambhir muddon ko uthaaya gaya tha
 Talking about the story, the masculine thinking was still dominant in Veerpur
 vahaan balavant singh kii hukumat chalati thi, jo ladakiyon kaa apharan kar unhen bech detaa tha
 No girl was safe in Veerpur
 haryana ke ilaakon main sthit, sho 6 navambar 2017 ko waapas aa gaya tha or isi tarah sakht or kathor ammaji bhi waapas laut ain thim, jo samay ke saath naram ho gayi thim

 balavant yuva ladakiyon kaa apharan kar unhen baari laabh ke liye bech detaa tha
 The show took a leap after the end of the first season's story and many things had changed in Ammaji's Veerpur, now ruled by Balwant Singh, whose terror spread throughout the village
 jabaki naa aana is desh lado main mahila bhrun hatya or sree jati se dwesh prachlit tha, haalaanki lado 2 main virpur main sthiti or kharaab ho gai thi, kyonki gaanv main shaayad hi koi aisi ladkiyaan thim jinke upar atyaachaar nahin hua tha, jisase yuva ladakiyon kaa apharan or mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh main vruddhi hui thi
 Ammaji, who had now gone to Delhi with her two ships, wanted to keep them away from Veerpur simply because Veerpur was not safe for young girls
 avika gore, jo ammaji kii badi potee anoushka kaa kirdaar nibhaati thim, ek swatantra or nidar vyakti thim
 While Anushka was fearless and ready to fight for what was right, her younger sister Jahnavi was a homely girl and the exact opposite of Anushka
 dilli main paidaa hui, anoushka ko unke jivan kaa sadame tab mila jab virpur main unki bahan jahnavi kaa apharan kar liya gaya, jo unke purvajon kaa gaanv bhi tha
 Meghna Malik, who reprized the role of Ammaji in Na Na Aana Is Desh Lado, was a flawless performance because of her flawless performance
 avika, jise hamane balika vadhoo or sasural simer kaa main dekha tha, ne is sho main majboot kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 As Anushka, we saw her in a new avatar and got excited
 virpur kii sthiti hamen kuch had tak 2003 kii film mathrubhumi kii yaad dilaati thi, jisamen pichley kuch varshon main mahila bhrunahatya kaa bhavishya chitrit kiya gaya tha
 The show was concerned with relevant issues, as human trafficking is on the rise and gender imbalance in the states of Haryana and Rajasthan has led to many criminal activities in these areas
 dharawahik kii kahani main uthaae gaye mudde or usase judi bhayavahata ko ham kai filmon or krime besd shos main dekh chuke the
 This cannot be denied, but the issue is timely
 kai rajyon main ladke-ladakiyon kii sankhya main antar ne ladakiyon ke prati aparaadh kii ghatnaon ko badhaava diya he isliye aise muddon ko jitna hilite kiya jaae acha he
 The story was not pulled in the initial episodes of the show, but only after a few episodes had the show moved back to its original story
 har episod main kuch na kuch hota rahaa, jisase sho darshakon ko anges karne main kaamayaab rahaa
 Talking about acting, Meghna Malik was once again able to impress with her character, although this time her role in the show was not that of a eater but a protector
 unako abhinay karte dekhnaa is baar bhi kisi treet se kam nahin tha
 Avika's intense style was special
 unhone apni pratibha ke saath ek baar phir nyaay kiya tha
 Palak Jain also did not disappoint with her role
 rituraj balavant singh ke kirdaar main nafrat jagaane main kaamayaab hue the
 The rest of the characters had taken the story well with their performances
 dharawahik haryana, dilli or chandigarh ke balldrop par tha
 This was done very well by the artists in dialogue delivery
 sho ke luk main bhi is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya tha
 Overall, Lado - Veerapur's Mardaani was different from TV shows and lived up to the expectations due to its concept and powerful performance

 That vacuum tube is called x ray tube or 'x-ray tube' which produces x ray
 eksre nalikaaon kaa vikaas crooks kii nalika se hua jisase sarvaprathamexre khoja gaya tha
 x rays obtained from these tubes have many uses, such as radiography, CAT scanners, airport baggage scanners, X-ray crystallography etc
 vibhav ke kaaran electron ko urja e×v praapt hoti, jahaan = electron kaa aavesh, tathaa vibhav
 If such total energy is transferred to the molecules of the cube and this energy changes to x-ray, then the frequency of the emitted x-ray will be obtained by the following equation: e × v = plank kaa sthiraank x aavriti 
 
 
 The equation has been proved in many experiments
 plank ke sthiraank kaa maan 6
62×10-27 arg-second he
 For electromagnetic waves, frequency and wavelength have the following relationship: targadairghy × aavriti = vidyuttarang kaa veg = 2
99×108 me
 prati senkad If the voltage is known in volts, the wavelength of the x-ray produced can be easily extracted in Angastrum units by the following equation: tarangadairghy = 12403 / volt 
 
 
 The wavelength of the x-ray obtained according to the equation is based only on the assumption that the entire portion of the energy received by the electron in reaching from the negative to the positive is converted into electromagnetic waves giving the same quantum of radiation according to the equation
 kintu sab electranon ke liye yah thik nahin he
 There is a very high probability of the electron's energy being partially or completely destroyed before electromagnetic radiation is produced
 iske anek kaaran hote hai
 The electrons move within the bottom of that metal when it is first hit by the metal atoms of the metal
 in parmaanuon se electranon kii gati main pratirodh hota he, kyonki ve parmaanu bhi anya electranon se pariveshtit hote hai
 Each metal has metallic electrons due to which the metals are electronegative
 dhanagar main pravesh karte samay runagra se aanevaale electranon tathaa dhanagar ke aantar electranon main anek sanghaat hote hai or prayek sanghaat main bahya electranon kii urja kam hoti jaati he
 Therefore, when the electromagnetic waves are generated from external electrons, the energy of these electrons is not uniform
 vibhavantar se mahatam urja hongi, kintu is mahattam urja ke electron–arthath ve jinase ek bhi sanghaat nahin hua hai atyant alp hote hai; adhiktar electranon kii urja isse kam hoti he
 Therefore, the x-ray produced is not monotonic; We get a different spectrum of X-rays

 The types of devices that Rantzen invented with the help of X-rays were used for some years in the beginning

 This defect was removed in Coolidge's X-ray tube
 1913 main kulij ne vibhinn tatwon par electranon kaa utpaadan karke eksre nalika banaayi jo 'kulij nalika' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Coolidge used thermal ions in exchange for electrification in the air to obtain electrons
 dhaatu ke tantu main vidyut dhara pravaahit karne se tantu garam ho jaataa he or dhara adhik badhaane se usase prakaash kaa utsarjan hone lagata he main hota he)
 Along with light, electrons are also released from this fiber and if a strip of metal is placed near the heated fiber in a vacuum, it will be seen to have positive electrical current
 kintu is reeti se electron praapt karne ke liye ati ucch nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Coolidge took a huge bulb of glass and placed a piece of high melting point in its center and completely vacuumed the entire bulb by setting up enough circles of tinted fiber to orient it
 yadi tantu ke is sarpil main paryaapt vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaae to tantu tapt ho jaataa he tathaa usase electron praapt hote hai
 Appropriate energy can be given to these electrons by increasing the potential
 atyucch nirvaat hone ke kaaran vaayu ke parmaanuon ke sanghaat nahin hote, at: electron sampurna urja ke saath dhaatu se sanghaat karte hai or eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 The main feature of Coolidge's x-ray tube is that the intensity and hardness of the x-ray produced can be changed at will
 vibhav ko sthir rakhkar tantu main yadi adhik vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaae to tantu kaa taap badhane ke kaaran richardsan ke sameekaran ke anusaar electranon kii sankhya bhi badhati he, at: sthir rakhkar yadi vibhav badhaayaa jaae, to sameekaran ke anusaar nunatam tarangadairghy kam ho jayega or utpann eksre kii kathorta adhik ho jaaegi
 Based on this Coolidge tube, but many types of X-ray tubes with the necessary transformations carry the required alternating current from a catabolic transformer and the required reversible high potential from a high transformer
 kulij nalika swayan rujukari he
 In the X-ray tube, only less than two percent of the energy contained in the electrons is converted into X-ray and the remaining 98 percent is spent in generating heat
 lakshya kaa, arthath us dhaatu ke tukade kaa jisapar alpavadhi main electranon ke asankhya sanghaat hote hai, taap itnaa adhik ho jaataa he ki uske gal jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 a continuous flow of water is conducted to keep the target cool
 lakshya main utpann hui ushma ko is prakaar baraabar hataate rahane se eksre nalika se adhik samay tak kaary lene main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 The study of X-rays was very important from the point of view of physics, but gradually X-rays were used, as mentioned above, in medicine and industry
 in sab kaaryo ke liye adhik teevr tathaa kathor eksre ke utpaadan kii aavashyaktaa badhati gai
 To solve this problem, many scientists working in the field of X-rays have used different types of tubes and devices
 tivrata badhaane ke liye electranon kii sankhya main vruddhi hona aavashyak he
 Increasing the electronegative in the fiber certainly increases the number of electrons, but increasing the temperature of the fiber leads to the evaporation of its metal and it is likely to erode and break down
 saath hi, electranon ke sanghaton se lakshya main jo ushma utpann hoti he vah badhati jaati he, isse lakshya ke galane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Different efforts were made to overcome both these difficulties and some of them were also successful
 oxide villepit tantuon se nimna taap par adhik electron dhara praapt ho sakati he; phir, paryaapt lambaai kaa tantusrpil lekar isht dhara praapt ho sakati he
 X-ray tubes typically use 10 to 150 milliampere electrons; In current times, 1 umpire or more electron current can be easily obtained from proper fibers and accessories
 is teevr electron dhara se lakshya main jo prachand ushma utpann hoti he usko kam karne ke liye philips, general electric, machalet ityadi eksre upkarnon ke nirmaataaon ne sthir lakshya ke sthaan par ghurnan karanevaale mandalak kaa aayojan kiya he
 The electrons are not in the same place due to rotation, and the heat is spent by the radiation before the place where the heat is generated is reintegrated
 ghurnit lakshya kii eksre nalikaaon main se jo eksre praapt hota he uski tivrata sthir lakshya se utpann eksre kii tivrata kii apeksha anek guni adhik hoti he, arthath photo khinchne main prakashdarshan ke samay main bahut bachat hoti he
 There is another way to increase the intensity and hardness of X-ray
 nalika kaa vidyudvibhav badhaane se bhi tivrata tathaa kathorta donon hi badhati he
 According to the equation, increasing the potential decreases the minimum wavelength, and increasing the voltage sufficiently can produce x-rays of gamma rays similar to wavelengths in laboratories
 vibhav badhaane se eksre kii tivrata bhi badhati hai; tivrata vidyuddhibhav ke ghan kii samaanupati hoti he
 Although simple high voltage transformers were available, there were many difficulties in obtaining sufficiently high voltage for x-ray production
 general electric, machalet ityadi nirmaataaon ne anek anusandhanon ke pashchaat ek karod anusandhanon ke pashchaat ek karod volt tak tak ke vibhaag dwaara eksre utpann karanevaale upkarnon kaa nirmaan kiya he
 More progress has been made by Illinois professor Karst using betatrine
 betatron se 40 karod volt tak ke vibhav dwaara eksre kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 These x-rays produced by the volatile potential are extremely fast and penetrating
 atyant tivratavaale eksre utpann karne ke liye anya sadhano kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, jinamein ullol-janitr vishesh ullekhneey he
 Just as movies are taken with light, they can also be taken with X-rays and in order to be scientifically suitable, these pictures need to be taken in a very short time
 ullol-janitr ke visarjan se atyant ucch utsarjan dhaaraon ke niyantrit visphot utpann kiye jate hai
 Here electrons are not produced by thermal current, but cold electrons emit electrons due to the intense electric field

 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her

" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers

 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas

 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold

 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha

" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he
 Newton's memorial can be seen at Westminster Abbey, just north of the entrance to the choir opposite the choir screen

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
