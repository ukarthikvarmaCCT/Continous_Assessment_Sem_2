 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of the linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1

 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays

 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed

 hindu dharm ke anusaar, khatu shyaam ji kaliyug main krishna ke avatar hai, jinhone shri krishna se vardaan praapt kiya tha ki ve kalyug main unke naam shyaam se puuje jaayenge
 Shri Krishna was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that as Kali Yuga descends, you will be worshiped in the name of Shyam
 tumhaare bhakton kaa keval tumhaare naam kaa sachche dil se uccharan maatr se hi uddhaar hoga
 If they worship you with their true mind and love, then all their desires will be fulfilled and all their work will be successful
 shri shyaam baba kii apurv kahani madhyakaalin mahabharat se armbh hoti he
 They were formerly known as Barbaric
 ve ati balashaali gadadhari bhim ke putr ghatotkach or naag kanya mauravi ke putr hai
 He was a very brave and great warrior since childhood
 unhone yuddh kala apni maan tathaa shri krishna se sikhi
 Pleased Lord Shiva by doing severe penance and obtained three unbroken arrows; In this way, he got the famous name of three gunadhis
 agnidev prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiya, jo unhen teenon lokon main vijayi banane main samarth the
 The war of Mahabharata had become unavoidable between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, when they received the news of Barbaric, their desire to join the war was also aroused
 jab ve apni maan se aashirwad praapt karne pahunche tab maan ko haare hue paksh kaa saath dene kaa vachan diya
 He rode on his blue horse with three arrows and a bow to the battlefield of Kurukshetra
 sarvyaapee shri krishna ne brahman bhesh dhaaran kar barbaric ke bare main jaanane ke liye unhen roka or yah jaanakar unki hansee udaayi ki vah maatr teen baan se yuddh main sammilit hone aayaa he; aisa sunakar barbaric ne uttar diya ki maatr ek baan shatru sena ko parrast karne ke liye paryaapt he or aisa karne ke baad baan waapas tunir main hi aayega
 If the three arrows are used, then the entire universe will be destroyed
 yah jaanakar bhagavan krishna ne unhen chunauti di kii is vriksh ke sabhi patton ko vedhakar dikhalaao
 They were both standing under the Peepal tree
 barbaric ne chunauti sweekaar kii or apane tunir se ek baan nikaala or ishwar ko samaran kar baan ped ke patton kii ore chalaaya
 The arrow momentarily pierced all the leaves of the tree and began to circle around the feet of Shri Krishna, as he hid a leaf under his foot; Barbaric said that you remove your leg, otherwise this arrow will pierce your leg as well
 tatpashchaat, shri krishna ne balak barbaric se poocha ki vah yuddh main kis ore se sammilit hoga; barbaric ne apni maan ko diye vachan ko doharaaya or kaha yuddh main jo paksh nirbal or haar rahaa hoga usee ko apana saath degaa
 Kष्णवोंवोंa knew that the Kauravas were sure to lose in the war, and because of this, if Barbarik supported them, the result would go to the wrong side
 at: brahmanroopi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se daan kii abhilaashaa vyakt kii
 Barbaric pledged them and asked for donations
 brahman ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Veer Barbarik was astonished for a moment, but could not stand by his word
 vir barbaric bole ek saadhaaran brahman is tarah kaa daan nahin maang saktaa he, at: brahman se apane vaastivak rup se avgat karaane kii prarthana kii
 Shri Krishna came into his real form as a Brahmin
 shri krishna ne barbaric ko sheesh daan maangane kaa kaaran samajhaayaa ki yuddh armbh hone se purv yubhumi pujan ke liye teenon lokon main sarvshereshth kshatriya ke sheesh kii aahuti deni hoti he; isliye aisa karne ke liye ve vivash the
 Barbaric prayed to them that they wanted to see war to the end
 shri krishna ne unki yah prarthana sweekaar kar lee
 Pleased with this sacrifice, Shri Krishna decorated Barbarik with the title of Best Hero in War
 unke sheesh ko yubhumi ke sameep hi ek pahari par sushobhit kiya gaya; jahaan se barbaric sampoorn yuddh kaa jayja le sakate the
 On the Dwadashi of the month of Falgun, he donated his head, thus he was called the donor of the head

 He was seen only walking in the battlefield with his Sudarshan Chakra which was cutting the enemy army
 mahakali, krishna ke aadesh par shatru sena ke rakt se bhare pyaalon kaa seven kar rahi thim
 Shri Krishna Veer was very pleased with the great sacrifice of Barbareek and gave a boon that in Kali Yuga you will be known by the name Shyam, because in that age, the one who supports the loser is able to bear the name Shyam
 unka sheesh khatu nagar main dafanaaya gaya isliye unhen khatu shyaam baba kaha jaataa he
 a cow came to that place and was automatically pouring milk from her breasts
 baad main khudaai ke baad vah sheesh prakat hua, jise kuch dinon ke liye ek brahman ko soopurd kar diya gaya
 Once the king of Khatu city was inspired to build the temple in a dream and to beautify it in the head temple
 tadantar us sthaan par mandir kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or karthik maah kii ekadshi ko sheesh mandir main sushobhit kiya gaya, jise baba shyaam ke janmdin ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The original temple was built in 1027 AD by Roop Singh Chauhan and his wife Narmada Kanwar

 The temple took its present shape at this time and the idol was replaced in the sanctum sanctorum

 Khatushyam is the family deity of a large number of families
 shri khatu shyaam ji kaa balykaal main naam barbaric tha
 His mother, Gurujan and relatives knew him by this name
 shyaam naam unhen krishna ne diya tha
 He got this name because of his curly hair
 inaki kahani madhya kaaleen mahabharat se shuru hoti he 
 Khatushyam ji was earlier known as Barbarik
 He was the son of Ghatotkach, son of the super-powerful Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Hidimbi
 khatu shyaam ji bal avasthaa se bahut balashaali or vir the unhone yuddh kala apni mata hidimbi tathaa bhagavan krishna se sikhi 
 He worshiped Lord Shiva and received three unique arrows from Lord Shiva
 is tarah unhen teen baan dhari ke naam se janaa jane laga 
 Agni Dev was pleased and provided him with a bow that could give him victory in all three locos
 When the war of Mahabharata was going on between Korvo and Pandavo, when Barbarik came to know about this, he also wished to do battle
 ve apni mata ke paas gaye or bole mujhe bhi mahabharat kaa yuddh karnaa he to unki mata boli putr tum kiski taraf se yuddh karoge 
 Then he said he would fight on behalf of the loser
 jab vah yuddh karne ja rahe the unhen raste main unhen ek shri krishna mili 
 He asked where are you going
 tab barbaric ne sari baat bataai 
 Shri Krishna ji said in Kalyug, people will come to know you as Shyam
 Because you are with the loser
 Kuki Barbarik's head was buried in Khatu city, so he is called Khatushyam rishi vedavyas dwaara rachit skanda puraana ke anusaar mahabali bhim evam hidimba ke putr vir ghatotkach ke shastrarth kii pratiyogita jeetne par inkaa vivaah pragajyotishpur ke raja daityaraj moore kii putree kamkatankakata se hua
 Kamakatankakata is also known by the name "morvi"
 ghatotkach va mata morvi ko ek putr ratna kii prapti hui jiske bal babbar sher kii tarah hone ke kaaran inkaa naam barbaric rakhaa gaya
 These are the same heroic barbaric who are known today by Shri Shyam of Khatu, Avatar of Kaliyug, Shyam Sarkar, Three Bandhari, Sheesh Ka Dani, Khatu Naresh and countless other names
 barbaric ke janm ke pashchaat mahabali ghatotkach inhen bhagavan shri krishna ke paas dwarka le gayi or unhen dekhte hi shri krishna ne vir barbaric se kaha— he putr morvey! jis prakaar mujhe ghatotkach pyaara he, usee prakaar tum bhi mujhe pyaare ho
 After that Veer Barbarik asked Shri Krishna - Lord! What is the best use of this life? On hearing this innocent question of Veer Barbarik, Shri Krishna said - o son, the best use of this life is to always support religion by being a companion of benevolence and the weak
 jiske liye tumhen bal evam shaktiyaan arjeet kerani padegi
 Therefore, you worship Navdurga in the Mahisagar region and earn powers
 shri krishna ke kehane par balak barbaric ne bhagavan ko pranaam kiya
 Seeing his simple heart, Shri Krishna decorated Veer Barbarik with the name "suhridaya"
 tatpashchaat barbaric ne samast astr-shastr, vidya hasil kar, mahisagar kshetra main 3 varsh tak navadurga kii aradhana kii, sachhee nishtha evam tap se prasann hokar bhagwati jagadamba ne vir barbaric ke sammukh prakat hokar teen baan evam kai shaktiyaan pradaan kin, jisase teenon lokon par vijay praapt kii ja sakati thi
 Here he got the name "chandil"
 maan jagadamba ne vir barbaric ko usee kshetra main apane param bhakt vijay naamak ek brahman kii siddhi ko sampoorn karwaane kaa nirdesh dekar antardhyaan ho gayin
 When Vijay Brahmin arrived, Veer Barbarik completed the yagna of Pingal, Replender, Duhadruha and nine types of carnivorous Palasi demons by consuming them like fire
 us brahman kaa yajna sampoorn karwaane par devi-devtaa vir barbaric se ati prasann hue or prakat hokar yajna kii bhasmarupi shaktiyaan pradaan kin
 Once upon a time, Barbareek turned down the offer of snake girls on the road between Earth and Hades, saying that he had pledged to be a lifelong celibate
 mahabharat yuddh prarambh hone par vir barbaric ne apni mata morvi ke sammukh yuddh main bhaag lene kii ichha prakat kii
 Then mother ordered them to participate in the war with the promise that you will play the side of the loser in the war
 jab vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lene chale tab bhagwaan shri krishna ne mahabharat yuddh ke pehle hi inako purv janm ke brahma ji dwaara praapt alp shraap ke kaaran evam yah sochakar ki yadi vir barbaric yuddh main bhaag lenge to kauravon kii samaapti keval 18 dinon main mahabharat yuddh main nahin ho sakati or pandavon kii haar nishchit ho jaaegi
 Thinking this, Shri Krishna decapitated the heroic Barbaric and denied the Mahabharata war
 unke aisa karte hi ranbhumi main shok kii lahar daud gayi, tatkshan ranbhumi main 14 deviyaan prakat ho gayin
 The goddesses disclosed the curse received by Brahma ji before the present birth of Veer Barbarik to all the warriors present as follows- deviyon ne kaha: "dwaparayug ke armbh hone se purv moore daitya ke atyaacharon se vyathit hokar prithvi apane gauswarup main dev sabha main upasthit hokar boleen— “he devgan! main sabhi prakaar kaa santaap sahan karne main sakasham hoon
 Bearing the burden of mountains, rivers, streams and all mankind, i continue to tolerate my daily activities with great pleasure, but i am deeply saddened by the atrocities of the Moore monster
 aaplog is duraachaari se meri raksha kiijie, main aapke sharan main aayi hoon
 " gauswarupa dharaa kii karun pukaar sunakar sari devsabha main ekadam sannata-sa chaa gaya
 After a while of silence, Brahma Ji said- "now the only way to get rid of it is that all of us should walk in the shelter of Lord Vishnu and pray to him to get rid of this crisis of the earth
 ” Then Yaksharaj Suryavarcha, who was seated in the assembly, said in his powerful speech - "O Gods, the Moor monster is not so glorious, which only Vishnu can destroy
 har ek baat ke liye hamen unhen ksht nahin dena chahie
 If you give me permission, then only i can kill him
 ” On hearing this, Brahma Ji said- “silly! i know your might, your ego has challenged this deity
 iskaa dand tumhen avashya milegaa
 Ignorant considering myself superior to Vishnu! You will fall from this deity to the earth now
 tumhaara janm rakshas yoni main hoga or jab dwaparayug ke antim charan main prithvi par ek bheeshan dharmayuddh hoga tabhi tumhaara shirochhedan swayan bhagwaan vishnu dwaara hoga or tum sadaa ke liye rakshas bane rahoge
 " brahmaji ke is abhishaap ke saath hi yaksharaj suryavarcha kaa mithyaa garv bhi chur-chur ho gaya
 He immediately fell at the feet of Brahma ji and said in a polite manner - “god! Forgive me for these words which came out by mistake, i am your refuge
 trahimam! trahimam! raksha kiijie prabhu!” Hearing this, Karuna sentiment in Brahma, he said - “watts! You have proudly insulted the Devas, so i cannot take this curse back
 haan, isamen sansodhan avashya kar saktaa hoon ki swayan bhagavan shri krishna tumhaara shirochhedan apane sudarshan chakra se karenge, deviyon dwaara tumhaare sheesh kaa abhisinchan hoga
 As a result, you will receive the boon of being worshiped like the gods in the Kali-yuga from the Lord Krishna
 ” After this, Lord Shri Hari also said to Yaksharaj Suryavarcha in this way- tatsatatheti tan praah keshwa devsansadi ! shiriste pujayishyanti devyah pujyo bhavishyasi !! Bhaartarth: "at that time in the assembly of the gods, Shri Hari said - o heroic! Okay, your head will be worshiped and you will be worshiped in the form and you will get fame
" " Devi Chandika again told all the people present there, "after seeing his curse culminating in the boon, Yaksharaj Suryavarcha became invisible from that deity, and in the course of time, in this earth, Ghatotkacha, son of Mahabali Bhima and barbaric form of Morvi
 Took birth in isliye aap sabhi ko is baat par koi shok nahin karnaa chahie or isamen shri krishna kaa koi dosha nahin he
 " ityukte chandika devi tada bhakt shiristivdam ! abhyukshya sudhaya sheeghra majran chaamran vyaadhaat !! Such as Rahu Shirshadwad Tachhira: Pranamam Tana! Bhaartarth: "after saying this, Chandika Devi quickly displayed the devotee's head with nectar and made it immortal and immortal like the head of Rahu and this newly awakened head bowed to them all and said-" i want to see war , You approve it
 " So Krishno Vach: Prah Meghagambhirvak Prabhu :! Yavanmahi sa Nakshatra Yavachandradivakarau! Tvatvam Sarvolokanam Vats! Pujyo Bhavasi bhavarth: tatpashchaat megh ke samaan gambheerabhashi prabhu shri krishna ne kaha— " he vatsa! jabatak yah prithvi, nakshatra he or jabatak surya, chandramaa he, tabatak tum sabhi ke liye poojaneey hooge
 Goddess Lokeshu Sarveshu Goddess Vad Vichrishyasi! Situation from self devotee Lokeshu Devinam Dasya !! bhavarth: "tum saidav deviyon ke sthanon main deviyon ke samaan vichrate rahoge or apane bhaktaganon ke samudaay main kul deviyon kii maryaada jaisi he waisi hi banaae rakhoge" Balānān this prophecy is aphrodisiac Kfodbwa :! Pitakasta: Driedenave Shamayyasasi Pujaat !!

Bhaartarth: "and look at the war as you climb on the top of this mountain, all the goddesses penetrated the sky at the behest of Vasudeva Shri Krishna
 " Barbaric headdress Girishrungambap Tatt! The world is not a cult of peace Tato war mahdbhut kuru pandava senyo: !! Bhaartarth: "veer Barbarik's sheesh reached the top of the mountain and his torso was cremated with classical method but the sheesh was not done after that there was a fierce battle between the Kaurava and Pandava forces
 " Yogeshwar Lord Shri Krishna made the head of Veer Barbarik irrigated with nectar by 14 goddesses who appeared in the battlefield and made that head immortal by granting it divinity, and Lord Krishna worshiped the head of Veer Barbarik in the form of God in Kali Yuga
 Blessed to fulfill the wishes of the devotees
 vir barbaric ne bhagavan shri krishna ke samaksh mahabharat ke yuddh dekhne kii apni prabal ichha ko bataaya, jise shri krishna ne vir barbaric ke devatv praapt sheesh ko unche parvat par rakhkar purna kii evam unke dhad kaa antim sanskaar shastrokt vidhi se sampoorn karavaaya


 At the end of the Mahabharata war, a mutual debate broke out among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war
 shri krishna ne kaha barbaric ke sheesh se poocha jaae ki usne is yuddh main kiskaa parakram dekha he
 Then Sheesh of Veer Barbarik replied that this war has been won only because of Lord Shri Krishna's policy and in this war only Lord Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra was going on
 vir barbaric ke dwaara aisa kehete hi samast nabhmandal udbhashit ho uthaa evam us dev swarup sheesh par pushp kii varsha hone lagi or devataaon ne shankhanaad kiya
 After that, Lord Shri Krishna again bowed down the head of Veer Barbarik and said, "O Veer Barbarik, you will be worshiped everywhere in Kali Yuga and complete the desired work of all your devotees
 atev, aapako is kshetra kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie, hamalogon se jo aparaadh ho gayi hai, unhen krupa kar kshamaa kiijie
 " itnaa sunate hi pandav sena main harsh kii lahar daud gayi
 The soldiers re-irrigated the head with the water of holy shrines and hoisted their victory flag near the shisha
 is din sabhi ne mahabharat kaa vijay-parv dhoomdhaam se manaaya
 The character of Veevar Morveenandan Shri Barbarik is elaborated in the "second Subdivision 'qomarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand" of Skanda Purana
 rishi vedavyas ji ne skanda puraana main "maheshwar khand ke dwitiya upkhand coumarika khand" ke 66 wein adhyay ke 115ve evam 116ve shloke main inaki stuti is alokik strotra se bhi kii he
 When Shri Krishna demanded his head from him, he offered his head to him without any hesitation and the devotees started calling him as the donor of the head
 shri krishna pandavon ko yuddh main vijayi bananaa chaahate the
 Barbarik had already pledged to support his mother with the loser and before the war, the head of a brave man had to be offered for the battle of worship, so Shri Krishna asked him to donate the head
 bhakton kii manyata rahi he ki baba se agar koi vastu maangi jaati he to baba lakhon-baar dete hai isiilie unhen lakhadaataar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 As mentioned in this article, Baba pledged to support the loser, hence Baba is also called the loser
 haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karne kii pratigya v daadi maan hidimba se mili aadesh ke kaaran hi
 Barbarik and Baba's head were asked by Lord Vasudev due to the problem arising in the mind of Lord Shri Krishna
 kyonki ek to kuru sena atharah dinon se pehle khatm nahi ho sakati thi
 And the other fact was that Mahabali Barbarik fought on behalf of the loser, so in the end there is no one left except Mahabali Barbarik
 kyonki jis taraf se vah yuddh karte to saamne vaala kamjor ho jaataa
 Then according to their vow they would have to fight on behalf of the loser
 atah ant main keval mahabali barbaric hi jivit rahete
 Baba always keeps a stick made of peacock feathers, so he is also called a mustard
 veeravar morviinandan shri barbaric ji kaa charitra skanda puraana ke "maheshwar khand ke antargat dwitiya upkhand 'comarik khand'" main suvistaar purvak diya hua he

 The spleen or spleen is usually located in the left upper quadrant of the human abdomen
 yah hypersplenism ke chaar pramukh sanketon main se ek he, anya teen sanket hai - cytopenia, saamaanya yaa hyperplastic asthi majja or splenectomy kii pratikriya
 splanomegali kaa sambandh aam taur par bade hue kaam ke boj se hota he jisase pataa chalata he ki yah hyperfunction kii ek pratikriya he
 It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is related to any pathological process under which abnormal red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen
 anya saamaanya kaarnon main portal hisertension kii vajah se hone vaala sankulan or leukemia or limphoma kii vajah se hone vaala antajspandan shaamil he
 Thus the presence of an enlarged spleen along with caput medusa is an important sign of portal hypertension

 viksit deshon main splanomegali ke sabase aam kaarnon main sankramak mononeucleosis, hematological malignancy se cancer koshikaon ke saath pleeha antajspandan or portal hisertension shaamil hai
 Factors of excessive splenomegaly are quite low, such as: agar spanomegali main hypersplenism anternihit ho to ek splenectomy kaa sanket miltaa he or isse hypersplenism thik ho jayega
 haalanki, hypersplenism ke anternihit kaaran ke bane rahane kii bahut zyada sambhaavna he isliye ek sampoorn naidanik prakriya kii jarurat padati he kyonki leukemia, limphoma or anya gambhir vikaron kii vajah se hypersplenism or splanomegali kii samasya khadi ho sakati he
