 prayavarti shrenee pareekshan kisi anant shrenee ke padon ke abhisaran ke liye kaam main lee jane vaali vidhi he
 It was first derived by Gatfried Labnitz, so it is sometimes called the 'labnitz test or Labnitz criterion
 nimna prakaar kii shrenee Or, jahaan an ek dhanatmak sankhya he ko prayavarti shrenee kehete hai
 According to the recursive series test, if {an} is a descending norm and its marginal value is leading to zero, the recursive range is convergent
 iske atirikt, mana l shrenee ke yoga kaa kul man he tab aanshik yoga Approximately equal to l and the error is equal to the sum of the terms left: mana hamen nimna rup kii ek shrenee di gai he ∑ n = 1 ∞ n − 1 a n { \ displaystyle \ sum _{n=1}^{ \ infty }^{n-1}a_{n} \ !}, jahaan lim n → ∞ a n = 0 { \ displaystyle \ lim _{n \ rightarrow \ infty }a_{n}=0} or a n ≥ a n + 1 { \ displaystyle a_{n} \ geq a_{n+1}} jahaan n ek praakrit sankhya he
 nan { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} ^ {n} a_ {n} \ !} is followed in a negative state
 ) We have to prove that the odd-order terms s 2 m + 1 = ∑ n = 1 2 m + 1 n - 1 an { \ displaystyle S_ {2m + 1} = \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ {2m + 1 } ^ {n-1} a_ {n}} and even order terms s 2 m = ∑ n = 1 2 mn - 1 an { \ displaystyle S_ {2m} = \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ {2m} The partial sum of ^ {n-1} a_ {n}} leads to the same value L
 atah saamaanya aanshik yoga s k = ∑ n = 1 k n − 1 a n { \ displaystyle S_{k}= \ sum _{n=1}^{k}^{n-1}a_{n}} bhi l par abhisrit hoga
 The odd partial sum is typically decreasing: jabaki sam aanshik yoga ekadishtatah vardhaman he: Because an number n is uniformly decreasing simultaneously
 iske atirikt, chunki an dhanatmak s 2 m + 1 − s 2 m = a 2 m + 1 ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle s_{2m+1}-s_{2m}=a_{2m+1} \ geq 0} hai
 Hence we can demonstrate the following inequality with the help of these effects: yahan a1 − a2 ekadishtatah hrasman anukram kaa S2m+1 nimna paribandh he, ekadisht abhisaran prameya ke anusaar m ke anant kii ore agrasar hone par anukram abhisarit hota he
 Similarly, even partial sum also leads to zero
 antatah donon samaa maan par abhisarit hote hai kyon ki Where l is called the marginal value, then for each m according to a specified convergence theorem praapt hota he
 This means that the partial sum of the recursive range also changes above and below the result range
 yadi yahan visham sankhya main pad hai to antim pad dhanatmak he or aanshik yoga parinami seemaa ke upar praapt hota he
 This gives us an error in partial sum constraint
 ham | s k − l | ≤ a k + 1 { \ displaystyle \ left|s_{k}-l \ right| \ leq a_{k+1} \ !} kaa do sthitiyon main adhyayan karte hai
 When k = 2m + 1, which is odd, then jab k = 2m, jo sam he, tab As intended donon hi paristhitiyaan hamen us asamanta kii ore le jaati hai jo hamane pichley siddh kii he

 Consequently, miners have taken the form of elaborate engineers

 In many countries of the world, of which India is also one, mining has been practiced since ancient times

 There are three main parts of exploration: planar exploration, drilling and underground exploration
 khanikarm ko mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya hai : In this type of mining, minerals are obtained by breaking the mountains etc
 above the ground, such as limestone, sandstone, granite, iron ore etc
 is vidhi main mukhya kaary pathar ko todna hi hai
 The rocks differ in hardness, firmness and firmness
 jo shilaayein komal hoti hai, unako todane main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 Examples of such rocks are gypsum, ceramic, cellar etc
 jin shilaon main dhaatuen milti hai ve atyant kathor hoti hai, jaise granite, diorite aadi
 These rocks are broken by explosive materials
 pracheen tathaa madhyakaalin yugon main khanan kii vidhiyaan nitant anupyukt thim
 Gradually mining methods evolved and gunpowder etc
 started being used in them
 vigat ek shatabdi main dianemite, jelignite, nitroglisreen aadi anek prakaar ke anyaay visphotak padaarthon kaa vikaas hua
 In order to use explosive materials in mining, holes are first made in the rocks and these explosives which are found in the form of cartridges, are kept and they are set on fire by electrocution or fuses
 visphot ke saath hi pathar ke tukade tukade ho jate hai
 These are then broken down and reduced by money, which facilitates their removal
 pattharon main chhidr banane ke liy jaik haimer aadi anek prakaar ke vedhanyantron kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 These devices are powered by compressed air or any liquid fuel
 chhidron kii gaharaai 3-4 foot tak tathaa vyas 1-1 / 2 inch se lekar 2 1 / 2 inch tak hota he
 Sometimes many such holes are made on the ground, and all are filled with explosive cartridges and all are burnt together by electricity, it breaks the whole mountain

 baadhak platon ke sameep baari dhaatuen ekatrit ho jaati he tathaa dhatukanon se vihin pani vicchhinn shila ko liye aage bah jaataa he
 The major requirement in alluvial mining method is the huge amount of water
 pani kaa dabaav 50 se 600 foot tak ho saktaa he
 The value of mining is also low, as it does not require any power other than water-generated power
 is prakaar khanit padaarthon kii maap ghan gajon main kii jaati he
 The use of mechanical means is also used in the mining of large deposits and sometimes up to 30 feet thickness deposits are mined by this method
 bharat main jalopha khanan vyavhaar main nahin he; kuch kshetron main ret chaanakar tathaa dhokar sona aadi praapt kiya jaataa he

 These boats can scratch sand up to a depth of 20 feet
 inamen prayukt baltiyon kaa samaveshan 1 1 / 2 se 14 ghanfoot tak kaa hota he
 The mining of many types of minerals and ores has to be resorted to underground mining whose mining in the form of open mines, being located at depth, is economically unsuitable or impossible
 yadhyapi bhumigat khanan main bhi badi puunji kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tathaapi in nikshepon ke khanan ke liye koi anya vikalp nahin he
 Underground deposits can be of two types: in donon prakaar ke nikshepon kii prakruti nitant bhinn hoti he, isaliye inke khanan kii vidhiyaan bhi suvidhanusaar alag alag hoti he
 Prospecting and exploratory works are carefully finished before commencement of work in the mines
 iske pashchaat khan kaa vikaas kaary prarambh hota he
 First wells are made
 inkaa vyas 10-12 foot tak ho saktaa he
 If the thickness of the deposits is less, then the proneers are manufactured
 yadi aavashyaktaa hui to bhumigat maarg tathaa gailariyaan bhi bana lee jaati hai jin shilaon se hota hua coop jaataa he, yadi ve sudruth nahin hoti to ispaat, cement aadi ke astr kii bhi aavashyaktaa padati he
 The wells are of great importance in underground mining, as these are operated by the workers to come to the mine, exhaust the miners, operate the air and pump the water out of the mine
 kisi bhi khan main kam se kam do coop avashya hote hai
 Shovels, spades, and sabbles or instruments or explosives are used to break minerals and ores
 praytn is baat kaa kiya jaataa he ki khanij kii adhikadhik maatra nikaal lee jaay
 But this causes the balance of rocks in the mine to deteriorate
 yah bahut kuch anshon tak shilaon ke lacheelepan tathaa unki shakti par nirbhar karata he
 The walls and roof of the mine need to be supported to keep the rock balance in the mine from deteriorating
 iske liye jis str par kaary chal rahaa he usamen stambh chhod die jate he or aasapaas se khanij nikaal liya jaataa he
 However, a significant amount of mineral is lost in it
 isaliye aajkal praytn yah kiya jaataa he ki khaali sthanon main baaluu athwa vaisaa hi koi anya padaarth bhar diya jaay tathaa un stambhon kaa khanij bhi nikaal liya jaay
 This method is used in most Indian coal mines
 iske atirikt, lakdi, loha, kancreet, pathar, eent aadi bhi prayukt hote he
 a cage-shaped swing, steel rope and winding engine are needed to bring the mineral material above the mine
 khaanon ke andar khanij ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak laane ke liye traliyaan prayukt hoti hai, jo adhiktar lohe kii patariyon par chalati hai
 Khan's employees also descend through the same swing in the mine through the well
 kuch khaanon main seedhiyaan bhi kaam main aati hai, jaise koderma kii abhrak khaanon main
 Provision of suitable light and pure air movement in underground mines is very important
 adhikansh khaanon main ab vidyut prakaash uplabdh he

 kashmiri, jammu praant ke banhaal, ramban tathaa bhadravaah main bhi boli jaati he
 The principal dialect is "kashtwadi" of Kishtwar
 kashmir kii bhashaa kashmiri he ye kashmir main vartmaan samay main boli jane vaali bhashaa he
 Various scripts have been used for the Kashmiri language, with the main scripts being Sharda, Devanagari, Roman and parasho-arabic
 kashmir vaadi ke uttar or pashchim main boli jane vaali bhashaaen - dardadi, srinya, kohwaad kashmiri bhashaa ke ulat thim

 The Sharda script was used to write the Kashmiri language, around the tenth century
 puranic kashmiri lipi ko keval sharada main likhaa gaya he
 The way of writing Sharda language is indigenous, which was developed from the original Brahmi
 vidwaanon, shaskaon or hindu, muslim, buddha aadi jaise sabhi dharmon ke log sharada lipi main likhte the
 Lalda, Rupa Bhavani, Nand Rishi and other devotional poems were written in the Sharda script itself and can still be read in the library

 Historically, the first instructions of this name follow Amir Khusro's nuh-script with Sindhi, Lahori, Tilangi and Mabri etc
 spashtat: yah disha vahi he jo punjabi, sindhi, gujarati, marathi, banglaa, hindi or urdu aadi bharatarya bhashaaon kii rahi he
 The arguments on which Grierson conceived Kashmiri to be "dard" need to be re-examined; Because even Kashmiri language kills are not solved
 ghosh mahapraan ke abhaav main jo daarad prabhaav dekha gaya he vah to sindhi, pashtu, punjabi, dogri ke atirikt purvi banglaa or rajasthani main bhi dikhaai padataa he; par kriyaapadon ke sanshleshan main karta ke atirikt karm ke purush, ling or vachan kaa jo sparsh paaya jaataa he usapar daarad bhashaayen koi prakaash nahin daalatin
 Perhaps the Kashmiri language is influenced by "dard", but not the origin
 15veen shatee tak kashmiri bhashaa keval sharada lipi main likhi jaati thi
 Later the Persian script became popular and now a customized form of this has become stable
 siraampur se bible kaa sarvapratham kashmiri anuwaad sharada lipi hi main chapa tha, doosraa farsi lipi main or kuch sanskaran roman main bhi nikle

 ophidiophobia yaa sarpbhiti ek tarah kaa dar he jisamen manushya ko saanp se bhay lagata he
 The word comes from two Greek words
 ophis kaa arth "saanp" he or phobos kaa matlab "dar" hota he
 This phobia is the most common subcategory of herpetophobia
 kuch shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki yah dar vikasvaadi ho saktaa he jo hamaare purvajon dwaara viksit ek astitv tantra kaa rup letaa he
 Psychologists generally believe that the phobia is the result of a traumatic experience
 kai baar yah bhay ateet se juda hua bhi nahin hota
 Symptoms can vary widely among patients with phobias
 jis mariz ko saad phobos he use bade or vishaiylla saanp kaa saamana karne main atyant bhay mahasoos hoga
 If this phobia is even stricter, then a human snake may be afraid of even a small snake
 vah manushya kisi saanp ke chitra yaa doordarshan pe dikhaaye jane vaale kaarykram ko bhi dekhne se dar jaataa he
 It is necessary to explain the difference between Ophidiophobia and Herpetophobia because the person who is afraid of lizards or small geckos is 100% herpetophobia
 is phobos ke lakshan kai he jaise ki bhaagna, ronaa, kaanpna yaa phir saans lene main takalif mahasoos karnaa
 Ophidiophobia can be fraudulent
 kuch samay ke baad mariz ko un chizo se dar lagane lagata he jo saanp se sidhe sambandhit bhi nahin hai
 An example of this is this: Man will also be frightened by the pet shop that sells snakes in the cell
 mariz ko anya sarisrupon ke ek madhyamik dar vikaas ho saktaa he
 Example: At the age of six, Jenny and Roxy are playing in the backyard
 roxi pattiyon ke dher par kuudati he or achaanak dard main baahar chillaati he
 Jenny looks at a snake's mouth around Roxy's leg, and feels frightened to see blood coming out of her leg
 roxi aspataal main chali jaati he or samay kii ek vistaarit avadhi ke liye use vahaan rahanaa padataa he
 After the incident, she never goes to play in the yard
 vah pattiyon ke dher ke paas jane ke liye ghabara jaati he or giravat ke mausam main baahar khilne ke liye babhi manaa kar detii he
 At the age of 20, Roxy is diagnosed with Ophidiophobia, due to which he has never been afraid of a snake
 vah aakhir main paraamarsh ke liye jaati he
 Usually because of a deeply negative experience from the past or the person's mind may also feel this fear without any basis
 aparichit jaanwaron ke aasapaas rehane par yah tantrika yaa anishchit hona saamaanya he
 In addition, there have been many common myths about snakes
 mariz pareshaan bhi ho saktaa he ki vah ghinauna, ghrunit yaa daraavana hoga or ve ek constrictar dwaara kuchal diye jaaenge
 All these apprehensions are common and can be removed by gaining more personal knowledge about animals
 yah beemaari kaa sabase saarvajanik ilaaj sangyanatmak vyavhaar takanic par aadhaarit he
 You are encouraged to speak about your fears in this and new messages can be taught
 iskaa ilaj sammohan dwaara bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This therapy often shows symptoms of oophidiophobia
