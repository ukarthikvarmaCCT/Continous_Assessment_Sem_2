 Dr
 Stolman is considered the father of the GNU Public License

 From the mid-90s, Stallman spends most of his time advocating for free software and agitating against software patents, digital rights, and other technical legal systems that take away their freedom from users
 iname software license agreements, non disclozar agreement, acteveshan kees, donglls, copy restriction, proprietary formats or bina sorce code ke binary executables bhi shaamil hai
 It was Dr
 Stallman who put the idea of copyleft in front of the people, using the same principles of copyright, allowing the user to use the software, modify its source code, and distribute that software and its source code
 
 2012 tak inhe 14 anareri doctoret or professorships mili hai
 Stolman was born in 1953 in New York City
 stollman kii mata kaa naam elis lippman, vah peshey se skool shikshika thi, stollman ke pita danniel stollman printing press brokar the
 From childhood, Stallman was very interested in computers
 jab stollman ek pre - tin samar camp main the tab unhone IBM 7094 ke manuels padhe the
 Between 1967 and 1969, Stallman attended a Saturday program for Columbia University high school students
 1967 se 1969 ke bich stollman colombia uniwarsity ke hai skool students ke liye chalaaye jane vaale shanivaar ke program main jate the
 Stolman also served as a Voluntary Laboratory Assistant in the Biology Department at Rockefeller University
 unki ruchi ganit evam physics kii taraf zyaada thi lekin rockfilor uniwarsity main unke shikshak ke anusaar ve achche biologist bhi ban sakate the
 His first experience with computers was at IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school
 hai skool ke senior year ke baad unhen 1970 ke greeshm kaal ke liye liya gaya tha taaki vah Fortran language istemaal karke ek newmerical analysis kaa program likhe
 He finished the job in a few weeks, and the rest of the time he wrote a text editor program using the APL language and a preprocessor program using the PL / 1 programming language for which he used an IBM System / 360 machine
 harvard vishvavidhyalay ke first year main, stollman ko unke MATH55 main majboot pradarshan ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 By 1971, by the end of his first year, he had become a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
 ve haikar community main bhi jane jate the vahaan unhen RMS naam se janaa jaataa tha 
 In 1974, he graduated in Physics from Harvard
 apane grajuation ke baad stollman ne mitgrejueta student ke taur pe jwine join kiya
 He gave up his desire to do his doctorate in physics, after a year, he wanted to concentrate on programming in MIT AI LABORATORY
 1975 main ve MIT main gerri sussamen ke neeche research associat ke taur par kaam kar rahe the
 At that time Stollman published a research paper with Susman, this paper was on AI Truth Maintenance
 iskaa sheershak dependency directed backtracking tha
 This paper was an early work in intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems
 2003 tak stollman or sussamen dwaara die gaye takanic ko sabase shaktishaalee intelligent backtracking kaa tarika mana jaataa hai
 While working as a hacker at mit's AI Laboratory, Stollman worked on some software projects such as TECO, EMACS for ITS and LISP machine operating systems
 ve leboratory main computer ke simit uplabdhta ke kade aalochak the, us samay leboratory kii funding dephence advanced research project agency se hoti thi
 When mit's Laboratory for Computer Science installed the password control system in 1977, Stallman figured out a way to decrypt the password
 stollman ne sabhi yugeras ko mail bheja jisame unka dicript kiya hua password tha or is mail main unhone yugeras ko apana password badal kar nal string karne kaa suzav diya taaki computer system main phir se anonemas acces suru ho
 About 20% of the users followed him, but in the end the password system remained intact
 kai saal baad stollman ne apane is andolan ko safal bataaya
 At the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s, the hacker culture that Stallman lived in began to crumble
 software ko pratidwandiyon ke computaron par chalane se rokane ke liye companiyon ne sorce code dena band kar diya or copirite evam restrictive software licensos kaa istemaal karnaa suru kar diya taaki software ko copy yaa distribute karnaa simit yaa band kiya ja sake
 Such proprietary software existed before, and it was becoming clear that all software in the future would be proprietary software
 stollman ke MIT ke mitra brooster kahel ke anusaar software ke kanoonee charitra main yah badlaav US copirite act of 1976 ke kaaran hua tha
 When Brian Raid introduced software time bombs to control unlicensed access to the scribe markup language and word processing systems, Stallman rated it a "crime against humanity"
 kai varsho baad stollman ne yah safai di kii yujar ke swatantraaa ko rokane vaale karm ko ve aparaadh maanate hai, software ke liye paise lene ko nahin
 In 1980 Stallman and a few other hackers were not allowed to access the source code of the software for the new XEROX 9700 laser printer installed in AI Lab, with Stollman slightly changing the source code of its earlier laser printer
 is parivartan se yah hua tha kii printer driver printing job ke hone par log in kiye hue yujar ko yah massej bhejtaa tha kii "unka job ho chukaa hai " or agar printer main paper jam ho jaataa to yah software sab log in kiye hue yugeras ko isaki jaankaree dete ek massej bhejtaa tha
 It was not possible to add these features to this new printer, which caused a lot of problems for most of the users as the printer was on a different floor than most users
 is anubhav ke baad stollman nishchit ho gaye kii yugeras ko software main koi bhi parivartan karne kii azaadi honi chahie
 Richard Greenblatt was also a hacker in the AI lab and started Lisp Machines, Inc
 to sell Lisp machines
 yah Lisp mashine unhone or tom nite ne AI lab main dizine kiya tha
 Greenblatt had refused to seek external funding
 unka yah maananaa tha kii kuch mashin banaakar bechney se jo munafa hoga use company main phir se nivesh kar company ko or bada kiya ja sakegaa
 In contrast, other hackers thought that the venture capital approach would be better
 kisi agreement par naa pahuchane par vah havers jo venture fundad rasta lenaa chaahate the unhone saath main milakar Symbolics kii sruvaat kii ras noftskar kii madad se jo AI lab main administrator the
 Symbolics recruited all the other hackers, including well-known hacker Bill Gossaper, who left the AI lab
 cimbolics ne MIT ke policys kaa hawala dete hue greenblot ko istipha dene par majaboor kiya
 Both companies made proprietary software, with Stollman believing that LMI did not harm the lab community compared to Symbolics
 1982 se 1983 ke ant tak stollman cimbolics ke programmers ke output ko clon karne kaa kaam kiya karte the taaki cimbolics ko lab ke computaron par ekadhikaar karne se roka ja sake
 According to Stolman, software users should have the freedom to share software, along with that users should have the freedom to study and distribute the software's source code
 unke anusaar swatantraaa samaaj evam yugeras ke liye zaruri hai or yah ek naitik mulya hai
 Stallman quit his MIT job in February 1984 so that he could devote all his time to the GNU project, which he had scouted in September 1983
 sitambar 1983 main stollman ne GNU oparating system ke yojana kii ghosna kai ARPANET meling lists or USENET main kii thi
 Stollman had initiated the project himself, stating that "being an operating system developer i had the right skills for this task
 main yah maanakar to nahin chal saktaa tha kii is kaary main mujhe safalataa milegi, lekin mujhe aisa laga kii mujhe is kaam ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 i decided to make my system compatible with UNIX, so that it is portable and UNIX users can easily adopt it
 " In 1985 Stollman released the GNU Manifesto
 isamen unhone apane GNU naamak free oparating system banane kii ruparekha likhi thi
 It was supposed to be compatible with the GNU operating system UNIX
 yah naam GNU ek ricorsive echronim hai iskaa phul form "GNU is note UNIX" hai

 In 1991, Linus Trovalds created an open source monolithic Linux kernel with the help of gnu's development tools
 trowalds ne ne yah karnal free software license ke tahat release kar diya
 The GNU system and the Linux kernel were created together to create a new free operating system that we know as GNU / LINUX
 lekin aam chalan main GNU / LINUX ko linaks hi kaha jaataa hai
 It is unfair to call this operating system just Linux because it is the GNU system in which Linux kernels are used
 haikar culture main stollman ne POSIX naam or Emacs editor ko prabhavit kiya hai
 The popularity of Emacs in UNIX systems gave a tough competition to vi
 isse editor war suru ho gaya
 Stollman used to say that he considered himself st
ignucius of the Church of Emacs and said "vivivi is the editor of Satan" while "using the free version of vi is not penance"
 1992 main Lucid Inc jo apane khud kaa Emacs bana rahe the, unka stollman ke saath vivaad hua, aakhir main unhone apane software ko xemacs ke rup main fork kiya
 Stollman has written several essays on free software
 ve 1990 ke dasak se hi free software movement ke liye andolan karte rahe hai
 His given title is titled The GNU Project and Free Software Movement, Dangers of Software Patents and Copyright and Society in the Age of Computer Networks
 2006 or 2007 jab 18 mahino tak public kansalatesan chal rahaa tha GNU general public license varshan 3 ko draft karne ke liye, us samay unhone ek chauthaa shirsak jod diya jo prastaavit badlaavon ko vistaar se samajhaati thi
 Stallman's strong advocacy of free software inspired developers to create Virtual Richard m Stallman software
 yah software dibian GNU / LINUX system ke haal ke packages kaa vishleshan karata hai or un packejon ko report karata hai jo saath main non -free tree ban rahe ho
 Stollman does not agree with Debian's definition of free software
 1999 main stollman ne inacychlopedia banane kii baat kii thi jisame log articals banaaenge

 stollman puri duniya main safar karte hai or ve free software or GNU project par bhasana dene kam se kam 65 deshon main gaye hai
 Stollman claims that there are many similarities between the Free Software movement and the movement of Mahatma Gandhi
 stollman ne kai baar GNU / LINUX naam ke liye vyavhaar karne kaa aagrah kiya hai us oparating system ke liye jo GNU system or linaks karnal ko saath main jod kar banaaya gaya hai
 Stollman considers this operating system a variant of GNU and tells GNU, the main developer of this operating system
 unke anusaar is software ko ko keval maatr linaks kehane se GNU project kaa darshan or is software ke bich kaa sampark tut jaataa hai
 From the beginning of 2003, they started using the name GNU + Linux so that no one could call it GNU / LINUX or GNU LINUX
 It may be that people mistakenly think that Linux kernels are maintained by GNU project
 stollman julian asanje or edward snowden jaise vishlablowers ke prashanshak hai

 Stollman does not consider Christmas, they celebrate "grav-mass" on 25 December
 yah naam or din sar isac newton par rakhi gayi hai, unka janam puraane calendar ke anusaar 25 disambar ko hua tha
 When asked who they were influenced by, the answer was Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ralph Nadar and Dennis Kusiniyech and with it said - "I am Franklin D

 kavismay se taatpary he - kavi samudaay main prachlit manyataayen jo pracheen parampara ke anusaar prayojanvishesh ke liye kavy main prayukt hoti ai hai
 Like the social tradition, due to imitation and excessive use in the field of literature or poetry, literature of every country or class has some literature related intentions and they are used mechanically
 in abhipraayon ko kavismay kii sangya se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 Vamana first used the word 'kavyasamay' to make sense of the distinguished poetess in relation to grammar, verses and gender
 kintu yah shabd adhik prachlit na ho sakaa
 Rajashekhar presents the definition of Kavisamay as follows- is vishay main aage chalakar unhone yah bhi likhaa he– Rajasekhar's later Sanskrit Acharyas Hemachandra, Amarchandra, Keshavamishra, and Hindi Acharyas Keshavdas and Jagannathprasad "bhanu", etc
 The discussions on Kavisamaya are almost all based on Rajashekhar
 dow hajariprasad dvivedi ke anusaar "kavismay shabd kaa arth he kaviyon kaa aachaar yaa sampradaay
 The flowering of Ashoka, Mandar, Bakul, Mango, Qurbak etc
 by various actions of pramada; Lotus blossom in rivers; Eating fire of chukor; Drinking only Swatijal of Chatak is some of the major "kavisamay"
 inhen "kaviprasiddhi' bhi kaha jaataa he or ye adhikansht: kaviklpanashrith tathaa ek seemaa tak sambhaavnashrith vaastaviktaa par aadhaarit hote hai
 It is also necessary to mention here the fact that in art any imaginary or real object is used as a motive for ornamentation, whereas in poetry, the idea or poetry is mainly the traditional idea which is supernatural and unnatural
 Notwithstanding, due to usability and adulation, poets are assimilated and later on become rigid
 rajasekhar ne "kavismayon" ko teen pramukh kotiyon main rakhaa he : Related to heavens; For example, consider the black spots seen in the moon as stigma, rabbit or reindeer; Describing the shape of Pisces or Capricorn in Kamdev's flag; Presenting Kamadeva in both tangible or intangible forms; Assuming the birth of Chadrama with Samudramanthan or with the eye of Atri Rishi; Believing Balachandra etc
 on Shiva's forehead
 patallok sambandhi; yatha, naag or sarpon ko ek maananaa tathaa isi prakaar daitya, daanav or asur ko bhi ek maananaa
 Earthlings is koti ke kavismay chaar virgon main baante gaye hai : Caste, Form, Form and Form
 inamen se bhi prayek ke teen teen bhed hai : asat, jo vidyaman nahin he uskaa varnan karnaa, sat, vidyaman hone par bhi jiskaa varnan na kiya jaae tathaa niyam, kisi vastu kaa sthanvishesh ke prasang main hi varnan karnaa tathaa uske anyatra milane par bhi us sthaan ke prasang main varnan na karnaa
 Therefore, there are 12 distinctions of the Bhoomi Kavisams: - vastut: kavigan pracheen kaal se hi kavismayon kaa upyog jane anjaane apane-apane kavy main karte aa rahe the
 Rajashekhar first presented his nomenclature, classical interpretation and classification and then he was included in poetry education

 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming
 dakshin main kapaas, ganna evam tambaaku kii kheti bahut bade paimaane par hoti thi jisamen das majdoor ke rup main kaary karte the
 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves

 State industries in North America were predominant, so budding entrepreneurs there sought protection to avoid foreign competition

 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life
 dakshini rajyon ke maamlen main das pratha kaa mudda sadaiv samvedansheel bana rahaa
 Whenever other states arose to implement the ban on slavery in these southern states, these states considered it an attack on their sovereignty

 He argued that there was no fear of labor organizations, strikes etc
 in the slavery system and that they provide more facilities to slaves than workers of northern states
 is manovruti evam tarkon ke aadhaar par dakshini rajyon ne das pratha ko aavashyak bataaya
 Slave trade was abolished in North America and slavery ceased in the north to the southern border of Pennsylvania
 is seemaa rekha ko “mesum-dikson” seemaa kaha jaataa tha
 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given
 is tarah das rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho jane se vyavasthapika main das rajyon kaa varchasv bad jane kaa khatra tha
 Therefore, in the context of the merger of the new states, North America wanted to include it as a free state, while the southern states as a slave state
 yah vivaad mizori rajya ke vilay ko lekar or bhi gaharaa gaya
 So in 1820, the Missouri-settlement was concluded with the arbitration of Henry Clay

 This was followed by a proposal to merge Texas into the Union
 ant main texas das rajya ke rup main sangh main 1845 main shaamil ho gaya
 Then the issue of California was disputed and California was finally annexed as an independent state in 1850

 Now to satisfy them, a "fugitive slave" law was brought under which the runaway slave could be caught again

 Sameer is a very romantic but confused boy
 jab bhi vah kisi ladki kii ore aakarshith hota he to vah sochta he ki use sachcha pyaar mil gaya he
 An artist by profession and the most mature of the three, Siddhartha is not interested in romance and is very serious, mature and devoted to his work

 Sameer finds that his parents have chosen a possible marriage partner for him
 vah pehle virodh karata he lekin jis kshan vah ladki ko dekhtaa he vah use pasand karne lagata he
 Unfortunately, Pooja is in a relationship with someone and hence Sameer has to be satisfied by becoming her only friend
 siddharth usase badi or talakshuda tara ke saath pyaar main padataa he
 He decides to suppress his feelings because he knows that he, like most others in society, views the relationship as abominable
 jab uske parivaar or doston ko pataa lagaana shuru hota he, to sabakuch galat ho jaataa he
 Siddharth's mother is frightened
 akaash siddharth kaa majaak udaata he
 That is why he slaps her, causing a rift in their friendship
 tara sunati he ki siddharth ne uske kaaran mitron or parivaar ke saath jhagada kiya he or mahasoos karti he ki usne uskaa jivan barbaad kar diya he
 She refuses to see him
 is bich, puja apane premi kaa saath chhod detii he or samir or puja antat ghoomana shuru kar dete hai
 Sameer eventually expresses her
 jab uske mata-pita use sidney, australia main paariwarik vyavsaay ke liye kaam karne ke liye bhejte hai, to akaash ko pataa chalata he ki vah shalini ke bagal main sanyog se baitha he

 Akash tries to let her go, but then realizes that he is unable to do so
 vah bharat lautataa he or uski shaadi kii purv sandhya par usase pyaar kaa izhaar karata he
 Shalini's family accepts her with blessings
 tara ko liver serosis ke saath aspataal main bhartee karaayaa jaataa he or siddharth ke saath saamne bistar par mar jaati he
 Siddharth and Akash finally reconcile
 chah maheene baad teenon dost shalini or puja ke saath yaadon ko phir se uttejit karne ke liye goa jate hai
 There, Siddharth meets a beautiful girl, who is also spending a holiday in Goa
