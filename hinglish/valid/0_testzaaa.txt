 It was night reaching on the hut
 brahmani ne soncha ab ye chane raat me nahi khaauungi praat:kaal vasudev ko bhoga lagaakar tab khaauungi
 Thinking this, Brahmani kept the chanas tied in the cloth

 Sudama ji thought! Guru Mata has said that both these people should share food equally
 lekin ye chane agar maine tribhuvanpati shri krishna ko khilaa diye to sari sristi daridr ho jaayegi
 No, i will not do this, my lord should be impoverished while i am alive, i will never do such a thing
 mai ye chane swayan kha jaaounga lekin krishna ko nahi khaane doongaa
 And Sudama ji ate all the gram himself
 daridrata kaa shraap sudama ji ne swayan le liya

 Blast furnaces are considered to be different from bloomery in that the purpose of a blast furnace is to produce molten metal that can be extracted from the furnace through the tap, while the purpose of blumery is to keep it from melting so that the carbon does not dissolve in the iron
 Go Blumery also artificially blows air using a blower but the term "blast furnace" is generally reserved for furnaces where iron is refined from the ore

 aadhunik bhattiyaan bahut zyada kushal hoti hai jinamein blast hawa ko pehle se garm karne ke liye couper stove bhi shaamil he or bhatti se nikalne vaali garm gaison se garmi praapt karne ke liye isamen recovery system lagi hoti hai
 The competition of the industry leads to excessive production
 sabase badi blast bhattiyon kaa aaytan lagbhag 5580 ghan me hota he or louh utpaadan kshamta lagbhag 88,000 ton prati saptaah hoti he
 This is a major increase of eighteenth-century typical furnaces with an average iron production capacity of about 360 tons per year
 blast bhattiyon ke bhinn roopon jaise swedish electric blast fernes, ko un deshon main viksit kiya gaya he jahaan koi swadeshi koyala sansaadhan nahin he
 Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of auxiliary facilities such as ore storage yard where the barges are evacuated to increase efficiency
 kachche maal ko ayask pulon yaa rail hoparon or ayask sthanantaran kaaron kii sahaayta se stochouse complex main sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 Rail-mounted scale cars or computer-controlled wet hoppers measure various raw materials to produce the desired hot metal and sintered chemical
 kachche maal ko ghiraniyon yaa vaahak belton dwaara chaalit ek skip car ke madhyam se blast fernes ke upar le jaaya jaataa he
 a variety of methods are used to charge raw materials in blast furnaces
 kuch blast ferneson main ek "dabl bel" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jahaan blast fernes main kachche maal ke pravesh ko niyantrit karne ke liye do "belon" kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these two bales is to reduce the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace
 sabase pehle kachche maal ko upree yaa choti ghanti main khaali kiya jaataa he
 The bell is then rotated to a predetermined magnitude to more accurately distribute the charge
 uske baad bade bel main charge ko khaali karne ke liye choti bel ko kholaa jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then closed to close the blast furnace while the larger bell distributes the charge to the blast furnace
 ek adhik haal kii dizin main "bel rahit" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In these systems multiple hoppers are used for each raw material which is then released through the valve into the blast furnace
 milaae jane vaale prayek ghatak ke pariman ko niyantrit karne main skip yaa vaahak system kii tulana main ye valve adhik sahi sabit hote hai jisase fernes kii kaarykushalta bad jaati he
 In some of these bellless systems, shoots are also used to precisely control the location of the charge
 loha banane vaali blast bhatti khud durdamy eenton vaali ek lambii chimney jaisi sanrachana ke rup main bani hoti he
 Coke, limestone flux and iron ore are charged in the upper part of the furnace in a precise fill order which helps to control the gas flow and chemical reaction within the furnace
 chaar "aptekon" se garm or gande gas ko bhatti ke gumbad se nikalne main madad milti he jabaki "bleader valve" gas ke dabaav main hone vaali achaanak vruddhi se bhatti ke upree bhaag kii raksha karata he
 After plug-in the bleeder valves have to be cleaned with a bleeder cleaner
 gas main maujuud mote kone "dust kachar" main funs jate hai or nishkasit karne ke liye unhen ek railroad car yaa trek main daal diya jaataa he jabaki gas khud saafe gas ke taapmaana ko kam karne ke liye ek venchuri scrubar or ek gas cooler se hokar guzarati he
 The "casthouse" of the lower half of the furnace consists of basal pipe, ture and casting equipment of liquid iron and sintered
 "nalchhidr" ko durdamy mitti ke plag ke madhyam se kholane ke baad lohe or dhaatumal ko alag karne vaali ek "skimar" opening ke madhyam se ek naand main taral loha or dhaatumal nikalne lagata he
 Modern and large blast furnaces may have a maximum of four tapholes and two casthouses
 nal ke madhyam se kachche lohe or dhaatumal ke nikalne ke baad nalchhidr ko phir se durdamy mitti se band kar diya jaataa he
 Toure is used to implement hot blast which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace
 garm blast ko aadhaar ke paas tour ke naam pani se thanda kiye jane vaale tambe kii tontiyon ke madhyam se bhatti main le jaaya jaataa he
 The hot blast temperature can range from 900 ° c to 1300 ° C, depending on the design and condition of the stove
 unke taapmaana sahane kii kshamta 2000 degree celsius se 2300 degree celsius tak ho sakati he
 Oil, alkatara, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can be added to the furnace at the tier level to release the additional energy required to increase productivity
 pighale hue lohe kaa utpaadan karne vaali mukhya rasinic pratikriya is prakaar he: This reaction can be divided into multiple phases of which the preheated blast air flowing into the furnace as the first phase reacts with carbon in the form of coke resulting in the production of carbon mono oxide and heat: garm carbon mono oxide louh ayask ko kam karne vaala kaarak he or yah aayran oxide ke saath pratikriya karke pighale hue lohe or carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan karata he
 Iron is converted into several phases depending on the temperature of different parts of the furnace
 bhatti ke sabase upree bhaag main jahaan taapmaana aam taur par 200 degree celsius or 700 degree celsius ke bich hota he, aayran oxide ko aayran aayran oxide, fe3o4 main badal diya jaataa he
 At a temperature of about 850 ° C, the iron is converted to iron oxide in a bit more like below: taji bhojya saamagree ke rup main bhatti se hokar guzarane vaali hawa main maujuud nitrogen, garm carbon dioxide or apratikriya vaali carbon monooxide pratikriya kshetra main pravesh karti he
 When these gases move downstream, the unfavorable-current gases heat the feed charge as well as convert limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: jab aayran oxide 1200 degree celsius tak ke ucchtar taapmaana vaale kshetra main pravesh karti he to yah aage chalakar louh dhaatu main parinat ho jaataa he: The carbon dioxide produced in this process converts to carbon mono oxide again with the help of coke
 bhatti ke gasiy vaataavaran ko niyantrit karne vaali mukhya pratikriya ko baudward pratikriya kaha jaataa he: The process of limestone decomposition in the central areas of the furnace proceeds according to the following reaction: apghaton dwaara nirmit calcium oxide lohe main maujuud vibhinn amleey ashuddhiyon ke saath pratikriya karke ek faiyalitic dhaatumal kaa nirmaan karti he jo anivaary rup se calcium silicket, casio3 he: The "pig iron" manufactured by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of about 4 to 5 percent, making it very brittle and used for limited and immediate commercial purposes
 kuch pig aayran kaa istemaal cast aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Most pig iron manufactured by blast furnaces undergo an additional process to reduce carbon content and to manufacture various level steel used for tools and construction materials
 haalanki blast bhattiyon kii kaarykushalta main lagaataar vikaas ho rahaa he lekin phir bhi blast bhatti ke andar hone vaali rasinic prakriya main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 According to the American Iron and Steel Institute: "blast furnaces will exist for millennia because large and efficient furnaces can manufacture hot metal at a lower cost than other iron manufacturing technologies
 " blast bhattiyon kii sabase badi khaamiyon main se ek khami yah he ki inamen anivaary rup se carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan hota he kyonki carbon dwaara aayran oxide ko parivartit karke loha praapt kiya jaataa he or iskaa koi kifayati vikalp nahin he - ispaat nirmaan duniya main carbon daai oxide utsarjan ke aprihaary audyogic yogadanakartaaon main se ek he 
 The challenge established by the blast furnace's greenhouse gas emissions is being addressed at ULCOS, an ongoing European program
 kam se kam 50% tak vishisht utsarjan main katautee karne ke liye kai nae prakriya margon kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he or unki baariki se jaanch kii gai he
 Some insist on storing CO2 after it is acquired while others suggest decontamination of iron and steel production through hydrogen, electricity and biomass
 filhal khud blast bhatti prakriya main sisies ko shaamil karne vaali or top-gas ricycling blast fernes naamak ek praudyogiki kaa vikaas kiya ja rahaa he or iske saath hi saath vanijyik prayojan vaali ek blast bhatti ke nirmaan kii yojana ban rahi he
 This technology should be fully demonstrated by the EU by the late 2010s, like developments scheduled to significantly reduce emissions
 vyapak pariniojan 2020 se shuru ho saktaa he

 On October 2, the day of Gandhi Jayanti, the police presented Ted to Carol, and Carol quickly identified him
 Since there was no concrete evidence against Ted in other cases, his mother and his stepfather rescued him with a $ 15,000 bail

 chunki musalmaan duniya ke vibhinn ilaake, maaliq or bazaar main based hai or jo samskruti pai jaati he vah kshetreey he na ki islamic
 But the truth is that no matter where the Muslim is in any region, it is on religious grounds
 duniya ke musalmaan saanskrithik aadhaar par ek duusare ko alag mahasoos nahin karte
 Religion Islamic which is a common tradition is found in all Islamic culture
 isamen quran se siddh or upadeshik vaastu jaise namaaz or gaiyr kurani vasatu jaise muslim samudaay or samaaj dekhe ja sakate hai
 In the history of Islam reestablished by Hazrat Muhammad, since the languages of Muhammad Sahab and Sahaba in the city Medina were Arabic, the same language was given the status of Islamic language
 kuran, hadison, sirat or anya gyaan sabhi arabi bhashaa se sambandh rakhte hai
 And this Arabic has proved to be the language of Muslim society
 banu umayya ke daur main bhi yahi bhashaa har khaas or aam main chaalu thi
 And non-religious traditions in distant languages also started
 jaise kitaab k lilah jo duniya har muslim samaaj main khyaati he, likhi gai
