 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha
 Some Indian films of the 1930s are known as "multilingual"
 in filmo ko milti julati lekin asmaan roopaantar main vibhinn bhashaaon main shoot kiya gaya tha

 isaki doorabeen madhya bindu par kursi se ek kshaitij dhuree dwaara fasi rahati he, jisase vah urdhv tal main thodi dwaara fasi rahati he, jisase vah urdhv tal main thodi dhooma sake
 To keep it stable, the visual lens has a snug under it and the ophthalmic lens rests on a screw
 pench ghumaane se doorabeen kshaitij aksh par urdhv tal main gumti he, jisase bulbula kendrit ho jaataa he! Some adjustments are necessary before observation with all types of meteorites, such as focusing, erasure, erasure, etc
 uparyukt samanjan, jaisaa naam se vidit he, prayek prakshan se pehle hone chahie
 Only then will the real work be done
 sandhan rekha pansal aksh ke samaantar honi chahie
 This adjustment is also done when necessary
 magar pansal or tantupat doorabeen se dridhtaa se kase hone ke kaaran yah samanjan lambii avadhi main shaayad hi karnaa pade
 For this reason, it is called permanent adjustment
 ye nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Focusing - The telescope rotates the ophthalmic lens in such a way that the crucible fibers of the fibrils become visible
 taduparant doorabeen par lage hue focus pench ko aise ghumaate hai ki dekhe janevaale maap ke vibhaajan spasht dikhaai den
 2
 Eradicate the establishment - If the reflection of the object is removed from the crucifix by moving the eyes slowly up and down while looking at the reflection of the object in the telescope, the focus is rotated again in such a way that the reflection does not seem to move away from the crucible
 3 kshaitijikaran - talekshan gaj par pathan lene se pehle drushtirekha kshaitij karnaa aavashyak he
 For this, measures are given in every machine, consequently its parallel line of sight becomes horizontal
 haal main ek talamaapi kaa avishkaar hua he jo swat: kshatijakaari he
 While taking the reading from the telemetry, it is believed that by focusing the panasal bubble, the vision became horizontal
 yadi aisa ho to do binduon par rakhe ankit gajon par kahin se bhi pathan lekar unka batar donon biduon ke bich saapeksh oonchaai batayega
 If this is not the case, ie if there is a concordance, then the readings for the device will cause an error
 kyonki drushtirekha pansal ke aksh ke samaantar na hone ke kaaran, jab pansal kaa aksh kshaitij ho jayega to drushtirekha kshaitij samtal se hati hui hogi
 This removal will increase in direct proportion to the distance of the machine
 at: asmaan duuri par rakhe maapon par liye pathnon main asmaan truti hogi
 Their difference will not indicate the correct relative height
 is kaaran yantra maapon ke madhya main rakhaa jaae to donon pathan samaan rup se galat honge or antar lene par truti radd ho jaaegi
 This will be clear from the above picture

 Being a significant part of the Mahavastu, it is placed under Vinaya and the Bodhisattvas are said to pay special attention to following the four discussions independently for the philosophy of the Ten Lands: mahavastu pali granth "mahavagg" ke bahut anshon main samaan he jaisaa ki windish ke shodhon se gyaat he
 According to the Madhyamaka philosophy, the Sravakayana, the Suddhakaran in each Buddhayan and Sambuddha Yana, is the best known, indicating the culmination of the Dasbhumis

 iskaa mul kaam hota he ki sharir ke upaapachay ko niyantrit kare
 To control metabolism, the thyroid makes hormones that tell the body's cells how much energy is to be used
 yadi avatugranthi sahi tareeke se kaam kare to santoshjanak dar par sharir ke upaapachay ke kaary ke liye aavashyak hormone kii sahi maatra bani rahegi
 As the hormone continues to be used, the thyroid continues to replace it
 avatugranthi, rakt kii dhara main hormone kii maatra ko pituitary granthi ko sanchalit karke niyantrit karata he
 When the pituitary gland, located in the middle of the skull under the brain, detects that the thyroid hormone is deficient or in excess, it adjusts its hormones and tells the thyroid what to do

 Ice skating means ice skating, walking on ice with the help of ice skates
 This can be done for a variety of reasons including vacation, travel and many sports
 aais skating bhitari or bahari donon tarah ke khel maidaanon ke saath hi jame hue pani ke prakritik barfile maidaanon jaise jhiilon or nadiyon par bhi hoti he
 According to a study by Federico Formanti of Oxford University, the first ice skating took place in southern Finland about four thousand years ago
 multya skates keval tikhe chapati haddiyaan thim jinhen paanv ke talon se baandh liya jaataa tha
 During that time the skaters did not actually skate on ice, instead it was in most cases slipping on the ice surface
 sahi myanon main skating kii shuruyaat tab hui jab sake liye tikhe kinaaron vaali ispati pattiyon kaa istemaal shuru hua
 Now the skates were cutting it instead of sliding over the ice
 13 veen or 14 veen shatabdi main dach nagarikon ne isamen tikhe kinaaron ko jod diya
 ye aais skates ispaat ke bane hote the or inhen gati dene ke liye inke neeche ke kinare tikhe hote the
 The construction of modern skates has remained roughly the same since then
 netherland main aais skating sabhi virgon ke logon ke liye samaan rup se uchit maani jaati rahi he, jaisaa ki old masters ke kai chitron main dikhaaya gaya he
 James II of England arrived in the Netherlands during his exile and became a fan of the game
 jab ve vaapis england laute to unhone british rajpariwaar ko is nae khel se parichit karavaaya or jald hi yah jivan ke sabhi kshetron se sambaddh rakhte logon main lokapriy ho gaya
 Queen Victoria is said to have known her potential husband, Prince Albert, better during similar ice skating tours
 is dauraan finland ke krishi kaamgaar teevr skating ke maharathi ho gaye the
 However, in other places, participation in ice skating was limited to upper-class people only
 pavitra roman samrajya ke samraat rudolph
 
 aais skating ko bahut pasand karte the or unhone is khel ko lokapriy banane ke liye apane darbar main ek bada barf kaa maidan bhi banwaaya tha
 The 16th King Louis of France brought ice skating to Paris in his time
 Other royal, upper-class fans of ice skating and ice hockey included Madame de Pompadour, Napoleon I, Napoleon III, and the House of Stuart
 barf par skates isliye kaam karte hai kyonki skates juuton ke neeche kii dhatvik pattiyaan barf kii sataha par behad kam gharshan ke saath phisal sakati hai
 However, by bending lightly on the leaf, increasing the pressure and slipping one of these edges into the ice, the skater can gain the ability to increase friction and control the speed at will
 iske saath hi, ghumaavdaar raste ko chunakar or is dauraan prithvi ke kendra ke anusaar khud ko jhukaa kar or apane ghutanon ko mode kar scater apni gati badhaane or niyantrit karne ke liye gurutvkarshan kaa upyog bhi kar sakate hai
 They can also create momentum by pushing the leaves in a winding path opposite to where there is snow erosion
 jhukaav or dhakelne kii in donon kriyaaon ko sujh boojh bhari yogyata ke saath upyog- jise takniki taur par drawing ke rup main janaa jaataa he- karne par scater barf par bina kisi prayaas ke purna gauravamayi tareeke vakrarekhiy pradarshan kar saktaa he
 Although the exact cause of how this low friction surface is formed is not known, yet much information is available about it
 ise neeche vistaar se samajhaayaa gaya haih prayogon se pataa chalata he ki barf kaa nunatam gatiman gharshan -70 celsius par hota he or adhikansh antargrihiy skating rinks apana tantra isi taapmaana ke anuroop vyavasthit karte hai
 In fact, it is difficult for physicists to explain such a low amount of friction, especially at such low temperatures
 At any temperature above -20 ° C, there is always a thin film of liquefied water on any surface of ice, the thickness of which can range from a few molecules to thousands of molecules
 or yah isliye hota he kyonki is prakaar kii crystalia sanrachana kii sataha ek dam rukhi hona sambhav nahin hota
 is dravit parat kii motaai lagbhag puri tarah se barf kii sataha ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he, jahaan oonche taapmaana kaa arth moti parat hoga
 haalanki skating -20 degree celsius se kahin kam taapmaana par sambhav he
 That is, the temperature where the natural layer of fluid is not produced
 When an ice skate leaf passes over the ice, there are two types of changes in the ice, the melting of ice due to kinetic friction and heat of energy changes its physical nature and the other changes its temperature
 aais skating kaa praathmik khatra to barf par girane kaa he
 The probability of a fall depends on the roughness of the ice, the size type of the ice skates, and the skater's experience and abilities
 haalanki gambhir chot aane kaa khatra bahut kam hota he, par kai chote khel maidaanon main scaters bords se takaraa kar lakwagrast ho chuke hai
 Another danger of falling is also the injury from the blades of one's own skates or the blades of others' skates
 yadi sir kii chot se bachane ke liye helmet nahin pahana ho to girnaa bahut ghaatak ho saktaa he
 Although accidents are rare, they are more likely to occur during a couple skating or skating together, face to face race
 doosraa or adhik gambheer khatra tab hota he jab koi khule main kisi prakritik taur par jame hue pani ke barf ke maidan par skating ke dauraan barf ke hote hue jame hue pani main gir jaae
 isse gambheer chot pahunchane ke saath hi sadame, hypothermia or pani main doobane ke kaaran mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 Due to the frequent breaking of ice, skates and heavy clothing worn to avoid winter, it is very difficult and in many cases impossible for the skater to come out of the ice
 saath hi is prayaas main scater achetan bhi ho saktaa he yaa phir vah jis chhed se pani main gira hota he use dhund paane main bhi asafal ho saktaa he
 The result of which can result in drowning or hypothermia, but by rapid cooling, such an environment can be created that one can survive for hours after falling into the water
 suraksha ke liye kisi ko bhi andhere main akele sket nahin karnaa chahie, jab bhi koi kisi jhil yaa nadi par jaae to apane saath keelein or barf kii hathaudi hameshaa rakhane kaa niyam bana lenaa chahie
 ye kisi bhi bhatke hue scater ko pani main girane ke baad barf par pakad banane main madad kar sakate hai
 With their help, unfortunate skaters can get themselves out of the water
