 Recycling is the primary component in modern waste reduction and the third component of the tradition of "reducing, reusing, recycling" waste
 punaravartaneey padaarthon main kai kism ke kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, plastic, kapade, evam electronics shaamil hai
 Although similar in effect, but generally not considered suitable for recycling or for other reuse - such as food and garden waste - from the waste of biological deformities
 punaravartaneey samagriyon ko yaa to kisi sangrah shaala main laayaa jaataa he athwa ucchhist sthaan se hi uthaa liya jaataa he, tab unhen nae padaarthon main utpaadan ke liye chantai, safai tathaa punarvinikaran kii jaati he
 In true terms, recycling the material will provide a fresh supply of the same material, for example, used paper will produce more paper, or used foam polystyrene will produce more polystyrene
 haalanki, yah kabhi-kabhaar yaa to kathin athwa kaaphi kharchila ho jaataa he, isiilie kai utpaadon athwa samagriyon ke punaravartan main anya samagriyon ke utpaadan main badale main unken hi apane hi punah upyog shaamil hai
 Another method of recycling is to reuse viable products from alloy products, either because of their personal cost, or because of their risky quality
 punaravartan kii prakriya main ai laagat ke kaaran aalochakon main nival aarthik or paryaavarniya laabhon ko lekar matbhed hai or unke suzav ke anusaar punaravartan ke prastaavak padaarthon ko or bhi badtar bana dete hai tathaa anubhodan evam pushtikaran ke pakshpatpurna purvagrah jhelana padataa he
 In particular, critics argue in this case that the costs incurred in the collection and transportation and the costs saved in the energy production process and energy would be reduced, as well as the jobs generated in the recycling industry in the lumber industry, mines and other Jobs in industries associated with basic products are infested; And materials such as paper pulp, etc
 can be recycled just a few times before the material is impeded for further recycling
 punaravartan ke prastaavkon ke aise prayek daawey main vivaad he or is sandarbh main donon hi pakshon se tark kii pramanikta ne lambe vivaad ko janm diya he
 Recycling has been a common practice in the history of human civilization, with plato-like advocates dating back to 400 BCE
 ansi avadhiyon main jab sansadhano kaa abhaav rahaa he apshisht kooday karkaton ke pracheen puratathvik adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki gharon ke kooday karkat kam hoten the — jisase yah pramanit hota he ki nae ke abhaav main zyada se zyada kooday-karkat ko punaravartit kar liya jaataa tha
 There is also evidence that in pre-industrial times, clippings of bronze and other metals in Europe were painted and melted to be used again
 britain main kooda-karkat batorne waalon ko koyale kii aag se ikaitha kii gai raakh or dhul ko mul saamagree ke rup main istemaal kar it banane main punraritt kar liya jaataa tha

 In the year 1813, Betley, Yorkshire Benjamin Law, developed the process of converting rags into "thick clothes" and "mango" woolen garments
 is padaarth main punraritt reshon ke saath shuddh oon ko mishrit kar diya gaya
 The cities of West Yorkshire die thick rough clothing industries, for example Betley and Dewsbury, from the early 19th century to at least the First World War

 The largest investment in recycling occurred during the 1970s, due to the increase in energy costs
 aluminium ke punaravartan main shuddh utpaadan hetu keval 5 pratishat urja kii hi aavashyaktaa hoti hai; kaanch, kagaz tathaa dhaatuon main naatakeey rup se kam kintu bahut hi ullekhneey rup se urja kii bachat hoti he, jab punaravartit jame sansaadhan ke stock ko upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Woodbury, New Jersey was the only city in the entire United States to mandate recycling

 This method was followed by other towns and cities, and today many cities in the United States gather the necessary materials for recycling
 varsh 1987 main, mobro 4000 jalayaan kooda-karkat ke bhandar ko neuyork se dakshini kerolina dho kar le gaya; jahaan use lene se manaa kar diya gaya
 It was then shipped to Belize; It was likewise refused to be taken there
 jalayaan neuyork laut aayaa or kooda-karkat ke us ambar ko jalaakar bhasma kar diya gaya
 The incident sparked a heated debate in the media over waste disposal and recycling
 yah aksar 1990 ke dashakon kii punaravartan ke "paagalpan" ko prajjwalit karne vaali ghatana ke rup main maani jaati he
 In order to streamline the recycling project, broadly, the continuous supply of recyclable material is difficult
 aisi aapurti kii sristi ke liye teen vaikalpik vidhaan prayog main laae jate hai: anivaary punaravartan sangrahan, paatr main jamaa karne kaa kanoonee aadesh, tathaa apshisht par pratibandh
 anivaary sangrahan kanoonon ne saharon main paravartan ke uddeshyon ko aamtaur par nishchit tithi tak sahar ke kachare kaa nirdhaarit pratishat avashya hi visthapit kar die jane ko lakshya banaaya
 The city then became responsible for accomplishing this goal
 sangraahak paatr main jamaa karne ke kanoon main kuch contenron ko lautaane ke evaj main kuch raashi lautne kii peshkash kii gai, khaastaur par kaanch, plastic or dhaatu
 aise container main jab koi utpaada karidaa jaataa tha, ek alp atirikt shulk uske mulya par dhary hota tha
 If the container was returned to the collection center, this additional charge could be withdrawn by the consumer
 ye pariyojnaayen aksar 80% punaravartan ke parinaam ke dar se kaaphi safal raheen
 Despite such results, such schemes faced strong resistance in some areas as collections shifted from regional governments to industry and consumers
 punaravartaneey padaarthon kii aapurti main vruddhi kii teesri padyati kuch padaarthon ko apshisht ke rup main kooda-karkat main nishpaadan par pratibandh lagaana he, jinamein aksar istemaal ho chuke tel, puraani batariyaan, tyrs tathaa baag-bagichon ke kooday-karkat shaamil hai
 The main objective of this method is to generate viable economic conditions for proper execution of banned products
 is bare main saavdhaanee baratani chahie ki aisi paravartaneey sevaayen adhikadhik sankhya main maujuud na hon, athwa aise pratibandh gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kooday-karkat kaa bahut bada ambaar na khadaa kar de
 The law was also used to increase and maintain demand for recycled materials
 aisi chaar kanoonee paddatiyaan maujuud hai: kam-se-kam punaravartit maatra ke adhidesh, upyogita kii daren, adhiprapti kii nitiyaan, punaravartit utpaada ke vargeekaran evam namakaran
 At least recycled quantity mandates and utility rates directly compelled producers to include reflection in their operations
 maatra ke adhideshon main yah saafe-saafe jaahir he ki nae utpaada ke kuch nishchit pratishat main punaravartit padaarth kaa hona aavashyak he
 Utility rates are a more flexible option; Industries have also been allowed to contract at any point of operation or even to achieve the goal of reflection in exchange for marketable debts
 in donon hi paddatiyon ke virodhiyon kaa nishaanaa unli aavashyaktaaon ko baadha-chadhaakar pesh karne or yah daawa karne kii ki ve udyogon se unke jaruri lacheelepan ko jabardastee le lete hai
 The way governments have used their own purchasing power to increase reflective demand is called a "procurement management" policy
 in nitiyon ko yaa to "dar kinar" kar diya gaya he, jo punraritt utpaadon main puri tarah kharch karne ke ek nishchit pariman par apni chhap chodta he, athwa "mulya kii praathamikta" kii pariklpanaaen karata he jo punraritt samanon ke kharid jane par bade bajet kaa praavdhaan karata he
 Additional Acts may set their goals for specific cases only: In the United States, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency issues mandates on the purchase of oil, paper, tires and insulation used in recycled or as revamped housing as possible
 antim rup se sarkari adhinium punraritt utpaada kii labling kii badhati hui bhaag ko lekar he
 Consumers can make the right choice when labeling producers on packaging with the result of the product of their recycled materials
 kray karne kii prachur kshamta vaale upabhokta tab adhik paryaavaranneey sachetan vikalp kaa chunaav kar sakate hai, utpaadakon ko unke utpaadon main punraritt padaarth ke pariman main vruddhi ke liye tatpar karte hai, tathaa paroksh rup se maang main vruddhi karte hai
 Separation of reflections and stratification of nomenclature may also have a positive effect of recursive supply if the labeling also includes information about how and where products can be recycled
 punaravartiya padaarthon ko aam apshisht kii bikhri hui silsilewar qatari se sangrah kar ekatrit karne kii kai alag-alag pranaliyaan lagu kii gai hai
 These systems create a business image between the convenience of the general public and government ease and expense
 ekatrikaran kii teen pramukh shreniyan "kachra phenke jane vaale centre", punah kharide jane vaale centre evam niyantrit kshetra ke ekatrikaran hai
 In such centers where waste is dumped, the waste producers have to carry recycled materials to the central area, either to an established or non-replenished collection station or to a self-operating plant
 ekatrikaran ke sabase aasaan tareeke to ye maan liye gaye hai, lekin apekshit kaaryaklap se anbhigya or kam hone ke kaaran sahanaa padataa he
 The repurchase centers are distinct in terms of purchasing and cleaning recyclable materials, hence providing a clear incentive for continued supply and use
 tab sansadhano parant padaarth ko bechaa ja saktaa he, is aashaa ke saath ki isse laabh hoga
 Unfortunately government subsidies are necessary to make repurchase centers a fruitful profitable industry, which, according to the United States Nation Solid Waste Management, costs an average of around US $ 50 to process a ton of material, Which can only be resold at US $ 30
 pratibandhit kshetra se ekatrikaran main kai pranaliyaan hai jinamein sookshm antar visheshkar is baat ko lekar he ki punaravartiya padaarthon ko kahaan alag-alag kar saafe kiya gaya he
 The major categories of aggregation of mixed waste are mixed recyclables and segregation by source
 apshisht ko ekatrit kar dhone vaali gaadi aamtaur par kooda-karkat uthaati he
 At one end of this image is the aggregation of mixed waste, in which all the recyclable material is collected in a mixed form with the rest of the waste, and then separated into a central sorting convenient location of the leftover material
 Is cleaned
 iske falswaroop ek badi maatra main punaravartaneey apshisht, khaskar kagaz itane adhik sad jate hai ki phir se sansaadhit ho hi nahin sakate, batch jate hai, lekin iske phaayde bhi hai; shahar ko punaravartanee padaarthon ko alag se ekatrit karne ke liye na to kuch bhugtan hi karnaa padataa he, nahin iske liye aam logon ko kuch sikhaane kii zarurat hi padati he
 It is easy to apply any change in the material that is recyclable because the sorting process takes place at a fixed central location
 ek mishrit athwa ekal-dhara vaali pranali main, ekatrit kiye jane vaale sabhi punaravartaneey padaarthon ko ek saath mila diya jaataa he lekin duusare apshisht se alag hi rakhaa jaataa he
 This reduces the need to be cultivated after aggregation, but the general public needs to be taught which substances are recyclable
 duusari padyati strot se alag-alag kar dene kii he, jisamen ekatrikaran se purv hi prayek padaarth ko alag-alag kar saafe kar liya jaataa he
 This method requires the least sorting after aggregation and produces the best recyclable materials, but each individual sorted material has an additional operating cost
 isamen vishad rup se logon ko prashikshit karne kii pariyojna kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he jiskaa safal hona avashya hi anivaary he agar punaravartaneey padaarth main milawat se bachanaa he to
 Sorting method from source itself has been given the highest priority because it takes a lot of cost to separate into mixed aggregation

 Once mixed reflective materials are collected and delivered to the central aggregation facility, different types of materials must be sorted separately
 yah kai staron kii shrinkhalaa main kii jaati he, jisamen kai swachaalit prakriyaayein bhi shaamil hai jaise ki padaarth se bhari ladi trek kii ek ghante se bhi is samay main chantai kar lee ja sakati he
 There are some plants that can sort materials spontaneously, which can be called single-cycle recycling
 punaravartan dar main 30 pratishat kii vruddhi un kshetron main dekhi gai he jahaan ye sanyatra maujuud hai
 Initially, recyclable materials are separated from aggregation vehicles and spread in a level on the carrier belt
 gatte ke bade-bade tukade or plastic ke theliyon ko haath se is charan main alag kar liya jaataa he kyonki ve baad main chalakar mashin ko jam kar sakate hai
 Later, the automatic machine separates the reflective materials by weight, separating light-weight paper and plastic from heavy-weight glass and metal
 gatton ko mili-jule kaagajon se alag kar liya jaataa he or sabase adhik saamaanya prakaar ke plastic, PET or HDPE, ekatrit kiye jate hai
 This sorting is usually done by hand, but in some sorting centers it is now automated: a variety of papers and plastics are separated by spectroscopic scanner instruments based on assimilation wavelengths, as well as Together each material is accordingly routed in the correct channels of aggregation in different directions
 lohamay dhaatuon ko alag karne ke liye shaktishaalee chumbakon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaisaa ki loha, isyat evam tin-ke pattar lage ispaat ke paatr 
 Non-ferrous metals are ejected by the force of magnetized cyclonic flows that cause the aluminum characters' variables and rotational magnetic fields to trigger a valid wave, which, in turn, produces a magnetic cyclonic wave within the letters
 ye chumbakeey chakrawathiya tarang ek bade chumbakeey kshetra ke dwaara vikarshith ho jate hai or paatr baaki bache paravartiya pravaah se rikt ho jaataa he
 Finally, the glass is also hand-sorted separately in brown, kahuruva, green or clean transparent colors
 paravartan kya aarthik drushti se prabhavi he yaa nahin, is bare main kuch virthak hai
 Municipalities often see fiscal benefits in implementing a recycling project, largely due to the cost of landfill sorting
 a study conducted by the Technical University of Denmark showed that recycling is the most effective method for disposing of household waste in 83% of cases
 haalanki, danish inviranmental assesament institute dwaara varsh 2004 main kiye akalan ke aadhaar par yah nishkarsh niklaa ki jalaakar bhasmeekaran kar dena hi peya paatro, yahaan tak ki aluminium tak ko nipta kar nast kar dene kaa sabase kargar tarika he
 Fiscal efficiency is completely different from economic capacity
 paravartan ke aarthik vishleshan ke arthshaastriyon kii bhashaa main bahimorkhataa yaa bahripan samavisht hai, jo nijee len-denon se baahar vyaktiyon ke labharth nahin aanki gai laagat he
 Examples include: emission of greenhouse gases from the process of decreasing air pollution and incineration, removal of hazardous waste from landfills, decreasing energy consumption, decreasing waste and resource consumption, which ultimately lead to mining and woodworking activities
 Reduces environmental damage

 Without maximum recycling, it is possible to have zinc by the year 2037, Indian and hafnium will be fully spent by the year 2017 and the turbium will have already passed by the year 2012
 mekanitoms ke bina jaise ki kar evam aarthik sahaytaaen bahypan ko aantarik karne main agar lagaayee jaati hai to samaaj par lagaae gaye laagton ke baavjood vyapaar unki andekhi karenge
 In order to make such non-financial benefits economically relevant, the supporting advocates have asked for emphasis on academic action to increase the demand for recurring materials
 sanyukt rajya america paryaavaran sangrakshan agency ne punaravartan ke paksh main nishkarsh nikaala he, yah kehete hue ki punaravartan ke prayaason se desh ke carbon utsarjan main 2005 main nival 49 million metrictan tak kii kami aa gai he
 In the United Kingdom, Great Britain's recycling efforts have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 10 to 15 million tons per year, as stated by the Waste and Resources Action Project
 ghani aabaadi vaale ilaakon main punaravartan adhik prabhaavshaalee he, kyonki vahaan kii aarthik vyavastha paimaane par aadhaarit he
 Certain requirements must be met to make recycling economically viable and environmentally artisan
 inamen punaravartaneey padaarthon kaa paryaapt strot, kachare kii qatari se punaravartaneey padaarthon ko baahar nikaalane kii pranali, aasapaas hi kaarkaane kii avasthiti jo punaravartaneey padaarthon ke punarsansaadhan main sakasham ho, tathaa punaravartit utpaadon kii sambhavit maang shaamil hai
 These last two requirements are often overlooked - recycling is incomplete without the industrial market for production and the consumer market for goods produced, and is in fact just "aggregation"
 punaravartaneey kii sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kai arthshaastri madhyam str par sarkari hastkshep ke paksh main hai
 Economists with this mindset likely view product settlement as the externality of production and at the same time argue that it is the most capable of ending such a dilemma
 haalanki, nagarpalika ke punaravartan ke prati aise ahastkshep vaale drushtikon ke liye seva ke rup main utpaada nishpaadan dekhen jiskaa moolyankan upabhokta karte hai
 The vision of a free market coincides more with the preference of consumers as profit-seeking businesses tend to place more emphasis on the production or service of quality products than the government

 In the year 2008, the prices of recyclable waste suddenly collapsed like a colliding ball in 2009
 san 2004 se 2008 ke bich cardboard ausatan 53 pound ton se girakar 19 pound ton tak pahunch gaya or phir may 2009 main 59 ton tak upar uth gaya
 PET plastics dropped from around £ 156 / tonne to £ 75 / tonne on average, then to £ 195 / tonne in May 2009

 There is a dispute about how much energy can be saved through recycling
 urja soochna prashasan ke iske apane websit par ullekh karne ke anusaar "kagaz kii ek mil punaravartit kagaz se kagaz banane main 40 pratishat kam urja kaa upyog karti he tulanaatmak rup se naye rup se kagaz kii lugdi se kagaz banane main jitani urja lagati he"

 Recycling proponents believe that trucks of other wood or larger blades are removed when the paper is collected for recycling
 urja kii khapat athwa apshisht ke nispadan kii prakriya main utpaadan kii sahi maatra kaa nirdhaaran karnaa kathin he
 How much energy is used in recycling depends largely on the type of recycled material and the process used to do so
 aamtaur par sabhi is baat se sahamat hai ki khurachnon se aluminium ke utpaadan main urja kii khapat kii tulana main aluminium punaravartan main kam urja lagati he
 According to the EPA "recycling of aluminum containers for example saves 95 percent of the energy it takes to produce aluminum from its natural source bauxite
 arthshaastri steven landsburg ne salaah di he ki jameen kii khaali jagah kii bharaai main kabhi se ekmaatr laabh urja kii aavashkata tathaa punaravartan kii prakriya main pratifalit pradooshan he
 Although others have calculated through the life cycle, it has been assessed that the cultivation in the production of recycled kagas is compared to harvesting, weaving, pulp making, processing and transportation of basically existing trees etc
 Low energy and water behavior is minimized
 kam punarnavinikaran kiye gaye kaagaj kaa upyog kar ke, farming wanon ke srijan evam rakh-rakhaav ke liye tab tak atirikt urja kii aavashyaktaa padati he jabatak ki ye van kore prakritik rup se viksit wanon kii tarah aatm-nirbhar evam swatah samposhit nahin ho jate
 Agriculture requires additional energy in the creation and maintenance of other forests, public policy analyst James V, delong has pointed out that recycling is a process of construction and that in many systems more energy is saved than it is Is used
 urja ke upyog ke atirikt, unhone is baat par gaur kiya he ki punaravartan main puunji or shram kii zarurat hoti he jab bhi apshisht se kuch utpaadan karnaa hota he
 These processes require more advanced, efficient and effective method of disposal of conventional raw materials and / or traditional waste for recycling
 punaravartan se vastav main jis mudra kii jitani rakam bachati he vah punaravartan main prayukt program kii kaaryakari kshamta par nirbhar karti he
 The Institute for Local self-reliance argues that the cost of recycling depends on many factors around a particular recycling community, such as landfill fees and the amount of disposal of the recycling community
 According to its statement, when the people of the community consider recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system, they start saving money and not as an additional work to be added to their work and the assigned tasks of their collection and / Or reconfigure trucks
 " In many cases, the cost of recyclables also rises significantly above the cost of raw materials

 Additionally, according to a study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that continuously scrutinized the price of broken glass pieces between July 15 and August 2, 1991, the average cost per ton was US $ 40 to US $ 60
 While the USGS report shows that between 1993 and 1997, the price per tonne of sandy powder of unrefined silica was US $ 17

 Tierney also argued that the recycling process employs more people for additional waste disposal, sorting, testing, and many types of fees are leveled as the processing of the product is finalized
 The cost often comes more than the profit of the sale of the product

 Most of the paper comes from pulp forests specifically for paper production

 The only reason for the deforestation of the forests is the pressure of population such as demand for more land for agriculture and construction of land
 Therefore, recycling of paper, although reducing the demand for trees, does not benefit the tropical rain forests

 Because of the poor social support of a country compared to the loss of income of the poor engaged in recycling work, it is more likely that the poor will become increasingly conflicted with larger establishments of recycling
 This means that few people will be able to decide whether certain wastes are more economically reusable in their current form rather than being recycled
 The recycling efficiency of the poor may be against their recycling efficiency, for some materials may actually be higher because the individual has more control over what is considered 'waste'
 ek shram saadhy avyavht apshisht electronic evam computer he
 Since this waste can still be usable and is especially in demand by the poor, the ability of poor poor people to sell it or use it is more than the recyclers

 There are some fibers that are lost in the pulp making process itself, due to the inherent inefficiency in the process
 frends of da arth ke united kingdom chapter kii websit ke anusaar keval lakdi ke fibre kaa saamaanya rup se fibre kii kshati ke prati apane anubhav ke kaaran paanch baar punaravartan kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus, as long as the amount of newsprint that is used around the world declines to restrict the amount of lost fiber, a certain amount of new fiber is needed annually worldwide, although it may also be that some newsprint Paper factories should continue to use 100 percent recycled fiber

 When the flowers came out, mustard gold started shining in the fields, barley and wheat earrings started blooming, mango trees used to blossom and colorful butterflies started hovering everywhere
 vasant ritu kaa swaagat karne ke liye magh maheene ke paanchave din ek bada jashn manaaya jaataa tha jisamen vishnu or kaamdev kii puja hoti, yah vasant panchami kaa tyohaar kehalaata tha
 In the scriptures, Basant Panchami is mentioned from Rishi Panchami, then it is depicted differently in Puranas and Shastras and in many poems
 sristi ke praarambhik kaal main bhagwaan vishnu kii ajna se brahma ne jeevon, khaastaur par manushya yoni kii rachana kii
 He was not satisfied with his creation
 unhen lagata tha ki kuch kami rah gai he jiske kaaran chaaron ore maun chaaya rahata he
 With permission from Vishnu, Brahma sprinkled water from his mantle, as the water on the earth shattered, it started vibrating
 iske baad vrikshon ke bich se ek adbhut shakti kaa prakatya hua
 This appearance was of a beautiful woman in a quadrilateral, with Veena in one hand and Vara in the other hand
 anya donon haathon main pustak evam maala thi
 Brahma requested the goddess to play the veena
 jaise hi devi ne veena kaa madhuranad kiya, sansar ke samast jeev-jantuon ko vaani praapt ho gai
 There was uproar in the water stream
 pawan chalane se sarsaraahat hone lagi
 Then Brahma called that goddess Saraswati, the goddess of speech
 saraswati ko bagishwari, bhagwati, sharada, veenavadani or vaagdevi sahit anek naamon se puja jaataa he
 They are the providers of learning and intelligence
 sangeet kii utpatti karne ke kaaran ye sangeet kii devi bhi hai
 Basant also celebrates Panchami day as his birthday
 rugveda main bhagwati saraswati kaa varnan karte hue kaha gaya he- That is, they are the ultimate consciousness
 saraswati ke rup main ye hamaari buddhi, pragna tathaa manovritiyon kii sangrakshika hai
 The ethos and intellect in us is the basis of Bhagwati Saraswati
 inaki samruddhi or swaroop kaa vaibhav adbhut he
 According to the Puranas, Shri Krishna was pleased with Saraswati and gave him a boon that you will also be worshiped on Vasant Panchami and in many parts of India, Saraswati, the goddess of learning, is also worshiped on Vasant Panchami which continues till today
 patangbaazi kaa vasant se koi sidhaa sambandh nahin he
 But the practice of flying kites started in China thousands of years ago and then reached India via Korea and Japan
 vasant ritu aate hi prakruti kaa kan-kan khil uthta he
 Even humans are filled with joy even animals and birds
 har din nayi umang se suryoday hota he or nayi chetana pradaan kar agle din phir aane kaa aashwaasan dekar chalaa jaataa he
 Thus, this whole month of Magha is only encouraging, but the festival of Vasant Panchami affects Indian life in many ways
 prachinkaal se ise gyaan or kala kii devi maa saraswati kaa janmdiwas mana jaataa he
 Educationists who love India and Indianness, worship Goddess Sharde on this day and pray for them to become more knowledgeable
 kalakaaron kaa to kahana hi kya? jo mahatv sainikon ke liye apane shastron or vijayadashami kaa he, jo vidwaanon ke liye apni pustakon or vyas poornima kaa he, jo vyapaariyon ke liye apane taraazoo, baat, bahikhaaton or deepawali kaa he, vahi mahatv kalakaaron ke liye vasant panchami kaa he
 Whether they are poets or writers, singers or instrumentalists, playwrights or choreographers, all start the day with the worship of their instruments and the worship of Mother Saraswati
 iske saath hi yah parv hamen ateet kii anek prerak ghatnaon kii bhi yaad dilaataa he
 First of all it connects us to the Treta Yuga
 ravan dwaara sita ke haran ke baad shriram uski khoj main dakshin kii ore bade
 Dandakaranya was also among the places he visited
 yaheen shabari naamak bhilni rahati thi
 When Rama came to her hut, she lost her mind and started tasting sweet berry to Ram Ji
 prem main page jhuthe beron vaali is ghatana ko ramakatha ke sabhi gayakon ne apane-apane dhang se prastut kiya
 That area of dandakaranya is spread these days in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat ke daang jile main vah sthaan he jahaan shabari maa kaa ashram tha
 Ramchandra ji came there on the day of Vasant Panchami
 us kshetra ke vanavaasi aaj bhi ek shila ko puujate hai, jiske bare main unki shradhdha he ki shriram aakar yaheen baithe the
 There is also a temple of Shabari Mata
 vasant panchami kaa din hamen prithviraj chouhan kii bhi yaad dilaataa he
 He defeated the foreign invader Mohammad Ghori 16 times and left him alive every time, showing generosity, but when he was defeated for the seventeenth time, Mohammad Ghori did not spare him
 vah unhen apane saath afghanistan le gaya or unki ankhen phod deen
 The event after this is well known
 mohammad gori ne mrityudand dene se purv unke shabdabhedi baan kaa kamaal dekhnaa chaha
 On the advice of Prithviraj's fellow poet Chandbardai, Ghori indicated by sitting on a high place, hitting the pan
 tabhi chandbardaai ne prithviraj ko sandesh diya
 Prithviraj Chauhan did not forget this time
 unhone tave par hui chot or chandbardaai ke sanket se anumaan lagaakar jo baan maaraa, vah mohammad gori ke seene main ja dhansa
 After this Chandrabardai and Prithviraj also surrendered by stabbing each other in the stomach
 yah ghatana bhi vasant panchami vaale din hi hui thi
 Vasant Panchami also has a deep connection with Veer reality in Lahore
 ek din jab mullah ji kisi kaam se vidhyalay chhodkar chale gayi, to sab bachche khilne lage, par vah padhata rahaa
 When the other children teased her, Durga's mother sang
 muslim baalkon ne durga maa kii hansi udayi
 Reality said that if i say something about your wife Fatima, how will you feel? bas phir kya tha, mullah ji ke aate hi un shararti chaatro ne shikaayat kar di ki isane bibi fatima ko gaali di he
 Then the matter progressed to Kazi
 muslim shashan main vahi nirnay hua, jisaki apeksha thi
 It was ordered that either reality should become Muslim, otherwise he will be given death penalty
 hakeekat ne yah sweekaar nahin kiya
 As a result, he was issued a decree to take down the sword
 kehete hai uske bhole mukh ko dekhakar jallaad ke haath se talwaar gir gayi
 Reality gave a sword in his hand and said that when i am a child and following my religion, why are you growing up and turning away from your religion? At this, the executioner strengthened his heart and fired a sword, but that hero's head did not fall to the earth
 vah akaashmaarg se sidhaa swarg chalaa gaya
 This incident took place on Vasant Panchami
 pakistan yadhyapi muslim desh he, par hakeekat ke akashagami sheesh kii yaad main vahaan vasant panchami par patangen udayi jaati he
 Reality was a resident of Lahore
 at: patangabaaji kaa sarvaadhik jor lahore main rahata he
 Vasant Panchami also reminds us of Guru Ram Singh Kuka
 unka janm 1816 i
 main vasant panchami par ludhiana ke bhaini gram main hua tha
 He stayed in Ranjit Singh's army for some time, then came home and got engaged in farming, but due to spiritual instincts, people started listening to his sermons
 dhire-dhire inke shishyon kaa ek alag panth hi ban gaya, jo kuka panth kahalaaya
 Guru Ram Singh used to place great emphasis on cow protection, Swadeshi, women salvation, inter-caste marriage, mass marriage etc
 unhone bhi sarvapratham angreji shashan kaa bahishkar kar apni swatantra dak or prashasan vyavastha chalaayi thi
 Every year a fair was held in Bhaini village on Makar Sankranti
 1872 main meley main aate samay unke ek shishy ko musalamaanon ne gher liya
 They beat him and slaughtered him and put beef in his mouth
 yah sunakar guru ramsingh ke shishy bhadak gayi
 They attacked that village, but the British army came from the other side
 at: yuddh kaa pasa palat gaya
 Many Kuka Veer martyrs were killed in this struggle and 68 were captured
 inamen se 50 ko satraa janvari 1872 ko malarkotla main top ke saamne khadaakar uda diya gaya
 The remaining 18 were hanged the next day
 do din baad guru ramsingh ko bhi pakadakar burma kii mandley jail main bhej diya gaya
 He sacrificed his body in 1885, after suffering harsh atrocities there for 14 years
 raja bhoj panvar kaa janmdiwas vasant panchami ko hi aata hai
 Raja Bhoj used to have a big festival on this day, in which a big banquet was kept for the whole people which lasted for forty days
 vasant panchami hindi sahitya kii amar vibhuti mahakavi sooryakanth treepathi 'niraala' kaa janmdiwas bhi he
 Nirala ji had immense love and pain towards the poor
 ve apane paise or vastra khule man se nirdhanon ko de daalate the
 For this reason people called him 'mahapraan'
 is din janme log koshish kare to bahut aage jate he

 panchmakaar tantra se sambandhit shabd he jiskaa arth 'm se armbh hone vaali paanch vastuen' he, ye paanch vastuen tantric sadhana main upyog main laayi jaati hai- HIV screening or testing is done to detect the presence of human immune deficiency virus in serum, sputum or urine
 aise pareekshan echivi antibodiyon, antigenon yaa arene kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 The period from the transition to the examination done to know about any change is called the window period
 upaprakaar bi ke liye echivi -1 antibody pareekshanon kii ausat windo avadhi 25 din hoti he
 Antigen detection can reduce the window duration to 16 days and NAT to 12 days
 chikitsakeey jaanchon ko akasar nimna naamon se varnit kiya jaataa he: All diagnostics are subject to some limitations and sometimes their use can lead to erroneous or skeptical results
 avishisht pratikriyaayein, atigamaglobulinirktata yaa antimoni rup se echivi ke samaan anya sankramak karkon ke prati utpann antibodiyon ko maujuud rahane par mithyaa sakaaratmak parinaam ho sakate hai
 Autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous, can also rarely result in false positive results
 adhikansh mithyaa nakaaratmak parinaam windo avadhi ke kaaran hote he; anya kaarak jaise sankraman ke pashchaat kii rokthaam bhi kabhi-kabhi mithyaa nakaaratmak parinaam kaa kaaran ho sakati he
 The examinations selected to check the blood and tissue of the donor should be so reliable that if HIV is present it can be detected
 Antibody, antigen and nucleic acid examinations are used jointly by blood banks in Western countries
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anumananusaar 2000 ke anusaar vishwa bhar main aparyaapt rakt jaanch ke parinamswaroop das lakh nae echivi sankraman hue hai
 In the USA, since 1985, all blood donors undergo an ELISA test and a nucleic acid test for HIV-1 and HIV-2
 ye nidaankaarak parikshaayen daata ke saavdhaneepurvak chayan ke saath kii jaati hai
 As of 2001, the risk of HIV from transfusion in the US was one in 2
5 million for each blood transfusion
 kisi bhi vyakti main echivi sankraman kaa nidaan karne ke liye prayukt pariksha kaa ucch darje kii samvedansheeltaa or vishistataa vaala hona aavashyak he
 In the United States, an algorithm combining two tests for HIV antibodies is used for this
 yadi elisa vidhi se kii gai praarambhik pariksha main antibodiyon kaa pataa lagata he, to western blott vidhi se kii gai ek duusari pariksha se atebadiyon se judi pariksha kii kit main antigenon kaa aakaar nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The sum of these two methods is very accurate
 echivi pareekshan par yuanaids / dabluechao niti kathan main kaha gaya he ki un sthitiyon kaa, jinamein log echivi pareekshan karavaate hai, maanav adhikaron ke pariprekshya main sutrikaran kiya janaa chaiye jisamen naitikta ke siddhanton kaa sammaan kiya gaya ho
 According to these principles, HIV testing in individuals should be as follows: swasthya seva adhikariyon kaa naitik uttardaayitv, jiske anusaar unhen echivi se sankramit vyaktiyon ke langik saathiyon ko yah batalaana hota he ki unhen virus se sankramit hone kaa jokhim he joki kaaphi vivaad kaa vishay he
 In some legal jurisdictions such consent is given while in others it is forbidden
 anek sarkari pareekshan sthalon par aajkal pareekshan ke gopneey tareekon kaa prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 This may allow monitoring of infected individuals more easily than the benami test, in which positive test results are numbered
 gopneeyata ke mudde vivaad kaa vishay hai
 a test in which only one number is given to a given sample for testing
 sakaaratmak parinaam kii sthiti main namoonay par echivi se sankramit vyakti kaa naam nahin likhaa jaataa

 In the United States, screening all patients for HIV at all healthcare sites is an emerging standard of service

 An estimated 25% of infected individuals were unaware of their condition; This effort was expected to reduce new infections by 30% if successful
 sidisi vyapak naityik pareekshan kii rukawaton, jaise likhit sweekruti yaa pareekshan ke purv vistrut salaah kii aavashyaktaa ko hataane kii sifarish karata he
 HIV antibody tests have been developed specifically for routine diagnostic testing of adults; These tests are cheap and extremely accurate
 antibody pareekshan windo avadhi main, jo echivi sankraman or echivi seroparivartan ke prati maapan yogya atebadiyon ke utpaadan ke bich kaa teen saptaah se chah maheenon kaa antaraal sakate hai
 In most people, detectable antibodies begin about 30 days after infection, although some are serotyped late
 adhiktar logon main pataa lagane yogya antibody echivi sankraman ke teen maheenon baad utpann ho jaati hai
 The window period of six months is extremely rare with modern antibody testing
 windo avadhi main sankramit vyakti anya logon main echivi failaa saktaa he, haalanki antibody pareekshan se unke echivi sankraman kaa pataa nahin chalata
 windo avadhi main retrovirusvirohi upachaar se antibodiyon ke vikaas main der ho sakati he or windo avadhi 12 maheenon se adhik tak bad sakati he
 It does not occur in patients who have received preventive treatment after infection
 aise rogiyon ko 28 dinon ke saamaanya upachaar ke baad vibhinn antaraalon par elisa pareekshan karwaane chaiye, jo kabhi-kabhi 6 maheenon kii saamaanya windo avadhi se bhi adhik ho sakate hai
 Antibody tests may also give false negative results in patients with X-linked agamaglobulinemia; Other diagnostic tests should be used in such patients
 swasthya-seva kaaryakartaaon main der se hue echivi seroparivartan kii teen ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, in ghatnaon main swasthya-seva kaaryakartaaon main sankraman ke 6 maheenon se adhik samay ke baad echivi antibody pareekshan nakaaratmak paae gaye lekin 12 maheenon ke baad ve sero-sakaaratmak ho gaye
 In one event, DNA sequencing also revealed the source of infection
 der se hue do seroparivartanon ke saath-saath hepatitis si virus ) kaa sankraman bhi dekha gaya
 In one case, HCV infection has proven to be fatal if co-infection occurs, but it is not known whether HCV has any direct effect on the risk or sequence of HIV infection, or is an indicator of other infection-related factors
 anzime-linkd immunosarbent ese yaa anzime immunoese, echivi ke liye saamaanya rup se prayog kiya jane vaala pehla jaanch pareekshan tha, fih atyant samvedansheel pareekshan he
 In the ELISA test, a person's serum is diluted 400 times and applied on a plate that has HIV antigens on it
 yadi echivi ke antibody serum main maujuud hue to ve in echivi antigenon se bandhit ho sakate hai
 This plate is then washed to remove all other pieces of serum
 ek vishesh rup se banaai gai dwitiyak antibody- ek antibody jo maanviya antibadiyon sein bandhit hoti he - ko tab plate par lagaaya jaataa he or phir use dobaaraa dho liya jaataa he
 This secondary antibody is already chemically bound to an enzyme
 is tarah plate main usase bandhit dwitiyak antibody kii maatra ke anupaat main anzime hota he
 a substrate is applied to the enzyme and the enzyme undergoes a change in color or fluorescence
 elisa ke nateezon ko ek sankhya ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he; is pareekshan kaa sabase vivaadaaspad pahalu he, sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak parinaam ke bich antar ke bindu kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Like the ELISA test, the Western blot is also an antibody detection test
 lekin elisa vidhi kii tulana main virus ke proteinon ko pehle alag karke gatiheen kar diya jaataa he
 Subsequent steps are seen to bind serum antibodies to specific HIV proteins
 vishisht rup se echivi se sankramit koshikaayen khol di jaati hai or unke bheetar ke proteinon ko jail kii ek pattee par rakh diya jaataa he, jis par vidyut dhara kaa pravaah kiya jaataa he
 Different proteins in this region move at different speeds according to their sizes, while their electric charge is kept the same by a surfactant called sodium lauryl sulfate
 kuch vyavsaayik western blott pareekshan kiton main selulose acitate kii pattee par pehle se echivi protein hote hai
 Once the proteins are well isolated, they are transferred onto a membrane and the test is performed like an ELISA - the individual's diluted serum is applied to the membrane and serum antibodies may bind to some HIV proteins
 
 jo antibody bandhit nahin hote unhen dhokar nikaal diya jaataa he or anzime se judi antibodiyaan, jinamein vyakti kii antibadiyon se judane kii kshamta hoti he, yah nirdhaarit karti hai ki vyakti ke serum main kin echivi proteinon ke prati antibodiyaan hai
 There are no universal criteria for the interpretation of Western blot tests - the number of virus bands required for this may vary
 yadi virus bandon kaa pataa na chale, to pareekshan nakaaratmak hota he
 The result is positive if at least one virus band is present for GAG, POL and ENV gene-producing groups
 western blott kii vyakhya ke liye teen-jin-utpaada vaali pahunch ko jan swasthya yaa chikitsakeey kaamkaaj main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Tests in which the number of virus bands is less than the requirement are considered indeterminate - a person with uncertain results should be re-tested, as subsequent tests may be more conclusive
 anishchit western blott vaale lagbhag sabhi echivi -sankramit vyaktiyon main ek maheene ke baad pareekshan karne par sakaaratmak parinaam praapt ho sakate hai – chah maheenon tak lagaataar anishchit parinaam aane par yah samajha jaataa he ki parinaam echivi sankraman ke kaaran nahin hai
 In a generally healthy low-risk population, indeterminate results on Western blot occur in one in 5,000 patients
 aisi jagahon jaise pashchimi africa main jahaan echivi -2 sabase adhik paaya jaataa he, ucch jokhim vaale sankraman se grast vyaktiyon main anirnaayak western blott echivi -2 ke sankraman ko siddh kar saktaa he
 Rapid antibody tests are qualitative immunoassays that are intended to be used in place of Sushrusha to help diagnose HIV infection

 The ELISA test alone cannot be used to diagnose HIV, even though the test does not indicate a high likelihood of the presence of antibodies to HIV-1
 united stats main aise elisa pareekshanon ko western blott se pushti ke bina pasitive report nahin mana jaataa he
 ELISA antibody tests were developed to give a high degree of confidence that donated blood is not infected with HIV
 isaliye yah nirnay karnaa sambhav nahin he ki sakaaratmak elisa pareekshan ke kaaran raktaadhan ke liye asweekrut rakt vastav main echivi se sankramit he
 Sometimes the donor is tested again after several months to receive a negative ELISA antibody test
 yahi vajah he ki pasitive echivi pareekshan ke parinaam ko report karne ke pehle hameshaa pushtikaarak western blott kiya jaataa he
 Rare false positive results due to factors unrelated to HIV infection are more common with ELISA testing than with Western blot
 mithyaa pasitive haal main hue teevr sankramanon or allergiyon jaise rogon se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 Several false-positive tests in the fall of 1991 were initially attributed to influenza vaccines used during that flu season, but later investigations linked this cross-reactivity to several relatively nonspecific test kits
 ek mithyaa sakaaratmak parinaam se swasthya ke liye adhik jokhimkaarak rog hone kaa sanket nahin miltaa
 When the ELISA test is combined with Western blot, the rate of false positives becomes extremely low and diagnostic accuracy is greatly increased
 aadhunik echivi pareekshan atyant sateek hota he
 The evidence for the risks and benefits related to HIV screening was studied in July 2005 by the US Preventive Services Task Force
 lekhakon ne nishkarsh nikaala ki: 


 the use of repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay remains the standard method for diagnosing HIV-1 infection
 a large study of HIV testing in 752 US laboratories reported a sensitivity of 99
7% and specificity of 98
5% for enzyme immunoassay, and studies in US blood donors reported specificities of 99
8% and greater than 99
99%
 With confirmatory Western blot, the chance of a false-positive identification in a low-prevalence setting is about 1 in 250 000
 saste anzime immunoesse jaanch pareekshanon ke liye yahaan di gai vishistataa dar yah sanket detii he ki 1000 sakaaratmak echivi pareekshan parinaamon main se lagbhag 15 mithyaa sakaaratmak honge
 Confirmation of test results may reduce the probability of false positives to eventually 1 in 250,000 trials
 isi tarah samvedansheeltaa kii dar yah sanket detii he ki 1000 nakaaratmak echivi nateezon main se 3 vastav main mithyaa nakaaratmak parinaam honge
 But given the rates of HIV incidence at most testing centers in the United States, the negative predictive value of these tests is extremely high, meaning that any negative result would be true more than 9997 times out of 10,000 tests
 in pareekshanon ke bahut ucch bhavishyavaanee mulya ke kaaran hi sidisi yah sifarish karti he ki nakaaratmak pareekshan parinaam ko is baat kaa nirnaayak saboot mana jaay ki vah vyakti echivi se sankramit nahin he
 Actual numbers may vary according to the population tested
 aisa isaliye he kyonki kisi bhi medical pareekshan kii vyakhya prarambh main vishwaas ke darje yaa rog ke hone yaa na hone kii sambhaavna par nirbhar karti he
 Normally the prior probability is estimated using the information of the occurrence of the disease at the place of test or in the population
 echivi pareekshanon sahit sabhi pareekshanon ke sakaaratmak anumaan mulya or nakaaratmak anumaan mulya rog ke hone kii purv sambhaavna or pareekshan kii vidhi kii sateekta ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he, jisase vishwaas kaa ek nayaa str nishchit hota he ki kisi vyakti ko rog he yaa nahin 
 janasamudaay main echivi sankraman kii dar ke badhane ke saath is baat kii sambhaavna bad jaati he ki sakaaratmak pareekshan sateek rup se echivi sankraman kaa sanket detaa he
 Similarly the negative predictive value decreases as HIV incidence increases
 is tarah, atyant kam jokhim vaale samudaay, jaise muft raktadan karne waalon, kii apeksha ucch jokhim vaale samudaay main sakaaratmak pareekshan ke, jaise agyaat sahyogiyon ke saath akasar asurakshit guda-sambhog karne vaale logon main, echivi sankraman kaa sahi pratinidhitiv karne kii sambhaavna hoti he
 It is necessary to remember that the accuracy of current methods of HIV testing in the United States has been confirmed by numerous studies and reported a false-positive rate of 0
0004 to 0
0007 and a false-negative rate of 0
003 in the general public
 pi24 antigen pareekshan echivi ke pi24 protein, jo virus kaa capcid protein hota he, kii upasthiti kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Monoclonal antibodies specific for p24 protein get mixed into the patient's blood

 This test is not currently used in the US and EU to test blood donation, as it was intended to reduce the risk of false negative results in the window period
 neucleic acid pareekshan is kaary ke liye adhik upyogi he or eneti pareekshan karne par pi24 antigen pareekshan aajkal nahin kiya jaataa he
 The p24 antigen test is not useful for general screening because it has very low specificity and this test is used only in a short period of time before antibodies are formed against the p24 protein in the body after infection
 neucleic acid par aadhaarit pareekshan vishisht echivi jeenon jaise echivi -van gag, echivi -tu gag, echivi -ienvi yaa echivi -pioel main sthit ek yaa adhik kai lakshya shrankhlaon kaa pataa lagane yaa badhaane kaa kaam karte hai
 
 Since 2001, donated blood in the United States has been tested with nucleic acid-based tests, which has increased the window period between infection and disease information to about 12 days

 The use of CD4 counts as an AIDS criterion began in 1992
 200 kii sankhya isaliye chuni gai kyonki iskaa sambandh avasarwaadi sankraman ke hone kii bahut badi sambhaavna se tha
 The decrease in CD4 numbers in people with AIDS indicates that steps should be taken to prevent certain types of opportunistic infections
