 The stork couple is recognized as a sacred and fortunate bird and the description of this bird is found in folklore and folk songs
 bharat main saras pakshiyon kii kul sankhya lagbhag 8,000 se 10,000 tak he
 Sad thing is associated with this bird in present times
 vaishvik str par isaki sankhya main ho rahi kami ko dekhte hue IUCN dwaara ise sankatagrast prajati ghoshit kiya gaya he or isaki vartmaan sanrankshan sthiti ko dwaara nirupit kiya gaya he
 This means that the number of this bird is rapidly decreasing at the global level and if proper measures are not taken to protect it, then this species can become extinct
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki malaysia, philippines or thailand main saras pakshi kii yah jati puri tarah se vilupt ho chuki he
 In India too, stork birds have become extinct in most of the allegedly developed places
 isaki ghatati sankhya ke anek kaaran hai
 The main reasons are the decreasing cultivation of land, shrinking forest, indiscriminate use of pesticides and increasing human population
 teji se badalata paryaavaran or badhata pradooshan bhi iske liye uttardaai he
 Apart from this, they are also at great risk from very high current wires

 The dominion of India was the transitional state of present-day India
 yah 3 saal tak; 1947 se 1950 main samvidhan ke pravartan tak, astitv main rahi thi
 Originally, independent of British-colonial rule in India, autonomous, democratic, Indian republic was temporary rule or state
 ise aadhikarik rup se hindi main bharat adhirajya evam angrezi main dominian of india kaha tha
 After the passage of the Indian Independence Act in the British Parliament in 1947, officially, the Government of the United Kingdom relinquished its sovereignty over India and imposed self-government or swaraj in India
 iske saath hi british bharat kaa ant ho gaya or bharat canda or australia kii hi tarah ek swyttyopanivesh ban gay, 
 All the India-related legislatures of the British Parliament were handed over to the Constituent Assembly of India, India also became a member of the british-commonwealth Territory, as well as the King of Britain renounced the royal title of the Emperor of India
 british swayattayopnivesh evam rashtrmandal pradesh kaa hissaa hone ke naate england ke raja jyorj ko bharat kaa rashtradhyaksh banaaya gaya evam aanya rashtramandal deshon kii tarah hi bharatiya lahaze main unhen bharat ke raja kii upadi se nawaaza gaya, bharat main unka pratinidhitiv bharat ke maharajyapal ke dwaara hi hota tha
 With the enactment of the Constitution in 1950, India became a fully independent republic and the post of the King of India was postponed forever, and the post of His Excellency the President of India elected by the democratic process established by the Constitution of India
 Replaced with
 is bich bharat main do maharajyapalon ko niyukt kiya gaya, mahamahin maharajyapal lard mountbaton or mahamahin maharajyapal chakravarti rajagopalaachari
 The demands of self-government and swaraj continued to rise several times during the British-colonial period in India, but the British government rejected these demands every time and tried to suppress all movements by force
 parantu 1920 ke dashak main swaraj ke liye shuru hue is andolan ko purna-swaraj main parivartit hone main der nahin lagi
 After nearly 30 years after all the ups and downs, the 1947 British Government decided to grant Swaraj to India

 The purna-swaraj Ghoshana by the Congress, the british-indian Naval Rebellion and the economic recession in Britain after the Second World War served as the last nail

 aadhunik shiksha ke chalate rajasthan board kaa shiksha ke prati moolyankan karnaa ek bahut hi sanshay kaa vishay he
 i met a girl, Pavitra Bhadoria, she gave her tenth exam for three consecutive years and for three consecutive times she was selected for the supplementary examination in Mathematics English, three times she took both subjects, got a re-evaluation of both subjects, But the only answer that everyone knows is that she failed
 usne apane teen saal kitni pareshaaniyon se gujaarey, vah garib ghar main paidaa ho gai uski jaan pahichaan kisi board ke afasar se nahin thi, jo log ja sakate the, ve gopneey shakha main jaakar vishyon kaa punarmoolyankan karwaakar paas ho gayi, lekin jo nahin ja sakate the ve fel ke naam se ghoshit kar diye gayi
 When appointing a secretary, care is taken to test the entire examination system according to location, subject, student, and environment, then decide his life, and when the secretary does not take care of these things, he makes a big mistake
 , Which can never be met by any punishment, Rajasthan Education Board is known as a business place, mostly people of Sindhi community People work in the place, everyone knows that Sindhi community does not know any heart feeling, they only know money, people who put more money to check their copies gave more money to them
 Goes, the simple teachers who teach in primary school are the ones who check copies, even today, the thought of correcting articles is in their mind, whereas today's students are only Only the computer's board knows, jab jodne ghataane ke liye calculator aa gayi he, palak jhapakate hi leptope apana hisaab saamne rakhdetaa he to jodne ghataane ke liye or farmula yaad karne kii koun jokhim legaa, jab adhyaaapak kopinyaa jaanch kar board ko detaa he, to suparvizer khaanaa puri ke liye har lot se das kapiyaan nikaalata he or checking ke naam par vah bhi apni dimagi shakti ko kharaab nahin karata he or jo bhi use saugat pahunchaa detaa he, uskaa hi lot safal jaanchakarta ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The teacher takes the task of checking copies in order to use his leisure and earn extra money
 vah apane avkaas ke kaamon ke saath kapiyaan jaanchane kaa kaam karata he, uske liye kapiyaan jaanchane kaa ek samay de diya jaataa he, bhartiya samay ke or hindu shastreey matanusaar shaadi vivaah kaa yahi samay hota he, kopinyaa jaanchane vaale ke kisi ristedaar kii shaadi to hogi hi, or nahin hogi to vah kisi ke nimatran ke andar apane ko shaamil to karegaa hi, or idhar kopinyaa jaanchane kaa kaam bhi karnaa he, vah sabhi kaam karata he, kapiyaan bhi jaanchataa he, or apane ko avkaas kaa puraa fal bhi lene kii koshish karata he, adhiktar ve kapiyaan uske nijee log jaanchate he, or jis prakaar se board ke dwaara farmula likh diya jaataa he, use usee farmule kaa prayog karne ke baad sawaal ko hal kiye hue vidhyaarthee ko paas yaa fel karnaa hota he, agar vidhyaarthee do or do ko jodne main 2+2=4, kaa farmula prayog karata he or yahi farmula board ne likh kar diya he to vah vidhyaarthee paas ho jaataa he, or agar usne 2 or 2 baraabar 4 likhaa he to vah fel kar diya jaayegaa, is prakaar se vidhyaarthee kaa dimagi power na dekhakar keval farmoolo par paas fel karne kaa kaam uske ghar vaale apane khaali samay main puraa kar lete he
 If the teacher is with his wife in Tu Tu, then there is a problem of other students, he vents his anger on the Kapis, also there is a lot of liquor in Rajasthan, and the work of checking the copies is mostly It is only in the evening, in order to enjoy the full enjoyment of Avakas, the teacher sits down to check the copies after consuming liquor, so who does not know who will pass and who will not be the owner of it
 privet schoolo me anusaashan kii adhik paalna or adhik shikshit berozegaron kaa faaydaa uthaa kar ve vidhyaarthiyon ko uchit shiksha ke saath saptahik masik or ardhvarshik test lekar vidhyaarthee kaa moolyankan karte rahete hai, or agar kisi bhi moolyankan me vah asafal rahata he to use baahar nikaaldete he, jabaki sarkari vidhyalay apane hajiri register ke andar adhik se adhik vidhyaarthiyon ko dikhaakar apni saakh to dikhaate he lekin vidhyaarthee ke gyaan kaa koi moolyankan nahin kiya jaataa, naam maatr ke liye chamahi kaa moolyankan kar liya jaataa he, jo ki usee vidhyalay ke shikshak karte he, or ve pradhanadhyaapak kii najar main apane ko na girane dene ke liye parikshaarthiyon ko paas yaa fel karne ke andar keval paas karne me hi apni bhalaai samajhate he
 The manner in which the Rajasthan Secondary Education Board has spoiled the future of three lakh students is a matter of writing in history as well as the way in which any student sitting in the supplementary could also pass after much effort and in that one fourth of the students So passed and the rest failed and sat in the silence of your life, weeping except for the future, and the problems of being born in this Rajasthan
 To fulfill and they have no choice, seventy out of a hundred people have left their children for school, have either sent them to education in outlying provinces, or then got rid of education and engaged in wages

 dhruv kaa arth he 'nishchit'
 The polarized wave has oscillations in a finite form whereas the polarized wave has equal oscillations in all directions
 kisi gas yaa drav main gatiman dhwani tarangen dhruvan kaa gun pradarshit nahin karatin kyonki unki gati kii disha or dolan kii disha ek hi hoti he
 The beam of ordinary light is symmetric relative to the transmission direction, but in special cases it is characterized by asymmetry or unilaterality
 yah baat tourmaileen naamak hare rang ke prakritik crystal kii pattica ke dwaara aasaani se pramanit ho sakati he
 When ordinary light passes through this plate, the intensity of the beam does not change when the fillet rotates on the axis of the beam, but when this beam coming out of the terramine, rotating the second plate of the tourmaline, the intensity of the beam There is a lot of change in
 jab donon tourmailinon ke aksh samaantar hote hai tab to tivrata adhiktam hoti he
 As the angle between these axes increases, the intensity decreases and when it becomes equal to the right angle, the intensity value becomes zero
 spasht he ki pratham tourmaileen main se nikalne par prakaash main asamamiti kaa aisa gun utpann ho gaya he jo saadhaaran prakaash main nahin tha
 The name of this property is "dhruvana" and this quality of light is called "dhruvit"
 is drushti se saadhaaran prakaash "adhruvit" kehalaata he
 Through the phenomena of interference and diffraction, it becomes clear that just like sound, the transmission of light is in the form of waves and a material called ether has been conceived as the medium for this transmission
 dhruvan kii uparyukt ghatana yah pramanit karti he ki prakashtarangen dhwanitarangon ke samaan anudairdhya nahin hoti, kyonki anudairthay tarangon main kampan sancharan kii disha main hone ke kaaran uparyukt prakaar kii asamamiti sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, light waves are transverse, ie their vibrations are in the right-angled direction from waves like vibrations of the star's wire
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki anuprastha tarang main madhyam ke kan kaa kampanpath saral rekhaatmak hi ho
 It is necessary that the vibrational path is located in a plane on which the direction of wave propagation is normal
 at: is kampanpath kii akruti dirghavrittakar tathaa vishesh avasthaaon main vrittakar bhi ho sakati he
 The wave in which the shape of the vibration and if the vibration is simple linear, its direction is unchanged, it is called polar wave and in which this shape or direction keeps changing, it is called inverted
 is drushti se dhruvit prakaash nimnlikhit teen prakaar kaa ho saktaa he : 1
 level polarized 2
 dirghavritt dhruvit 3
 Circle Polarized
 ganitiya adhyayan se vidit he ki companon kii ye vibhinn akritiyaan, do samakonik saral aavart companon ke sangyojan se praapt hoti hai
 Conversely, whatever the shape of the vibration is, the decomposition of it can yield two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 jab prakashtarang kisi paardarshee crystal main pravesh karti he, tab uske companon kaa aisa vighatan pratyaksht: ho jaataa he or do samtal dhruvit kirane crystal main prakat ho jaati hai
 Their vibrations are right-angled
 saamanyat: ye bhinn dishaao main gaman karti hai or unke veg baraabar nahin hote
 This phenomenon is called bivariation and by this, Heisenz invented polarization in 1960
 tourmaileen ke crystal main in do kirnon main se ek kaa avasorana ho jaataa he
 This is the reason for the origin of light polarized by Tourmaline
 is prakaash ke companon kii disha tourmaileen pattica ke crystalia aksh kii disha par nirbhar karti he or us pattica ko ghumaane se companon kii disha bhi badal jaati hai
 But the shape or direction of vibrations in ordinary superfluous light varies continuously from moment to moment, so when it comes out of the tourmaline, the intensity of the polar light also changes, but its average value is equal in each position of the tourmaline
 And this is what we see
 kintu jab samtal dhruvit prakaash, jiskaa aayam he, tourmaileen main se hokar nikalataa he tab vah dhruvit to rahata he, parantu uskaa aayam ghatakar ho jaataa he, jahaan tourmaileen kii sthiti kaa suchak kone he
 q = 0 is considered when the amplitude is greatest
 ko q = 90 degree hone par aayam a = 0 ho jaataa he or pargamit prakaash kaa lop ho jaataa he, chaahe aaptit prakaash ke aayam kaa maan kitna hi bada kyon na ho
 The ellipse also polarizes the polarized light to the tourmaline plane, and its intensity also increases by rotating the tourmaline, but it never completely disappears
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke aaptit prakaash main paraspar samakonik, kintu bhinn ayaamon vaale do avyav kampan hote hai or jab q = 0 kii sthiti main ek avyav kaa aayam mahattam hota he tab duusare kaa lop ho jaataa he or q = 90 degree hone par pehle aayam kaa lop hota he or doosraa aayam mahattam ho jaataa he
 Tourmaline cannot change the intensity of polar-polarized light, because its two components vibrations have equal dimensions, ie
 at: isamen bhi adhruvit prakaash kii hi tarah samamiti kaa gun hota he
 Yet it is polarized light
 isko pahchaanane kii yukti aage bataai jaaegi
 The vibrations are simple in line and their direction is constant
 at: ise rekha dhruvit bhi kehete hai
 The reason for the name of the polar plane is that the vibrations of all the points of such a ray of light are in the same plane
 samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann karne ke anya upaay nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Diffusion occurs in crystals such as nickel prism - calcite, but the two mutually flat plane rays are so close that only one of them is difficult to obtain
 kintu kailcite ke visheshu yukti se kaate hue do prismon ko canada baalsam se jodakar ek samaantar falki prism bana liya jaataa he, jise nikal prism kehete hai
 Upon entering Canada, on reaching Balsam, a ray is completely reflected and goes to the lateral and is destroyed there, but the second ray goes straight out
 yah prism acha paardarshee hota he
 Thus, the flat, polar light obtained from it is the color of incident light
 2
 polaroid - isamen herapathite naamak khanij ke sookshm crystalon ko vishesh yukti se saloloid ke do takhton ke bich main is prakaar samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he jisase ve sab milakar ek lambey chaude crystal kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 This produces flat polarized light, similar to tourmaline
 ise polaroid kehete hai
 Its very long wide planks can be made
 is rang halakaa haraa hota he
 In 1941, an even better device was devised, whereby the molecules of polyvinyl alcohol are deposited in a parallel state
 ise paularoid-ech kehete hai
 It has no color at all and 99
99 percent of the light is polarized
 3
 paravartan - san 1810 main malus ne pramanit kiya tha ki jal yaa kaach jaise kisi paardarshee padaarth ke prishth se paravartit prakaash main dhruvan kaa gun anshat: paaya jaataa he or aapatan kone vishesh maan kaa hone par vah purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 This incidence angle is called the "polar angle"
 brooster ke niyamanusaar yadi dhruvak kone i ho tathaa paravartak padaarth kaa vartanaank m ho to sp hota he
 4
 Filletganj - Although the reflected light at the polar angle is completely polarized by the fillet of the slab, the light transmitted from it is never fully polarized, it is only partially polarized, but the light transmitted from among several plaques progressively
 The polarization increases progressively and when the number of plaques becomes sufficient, it becomes almost completely flat
 patali patali kai patticoon ke aise samooh ko pattikapunj kehete hai
 5
 Scattering - When light falls on very small particles present in a transparent medium, then the light circulating around them is also normally fractionated
 kintu jo prakaash praathmik kiran se samakonik disha main prakirnit hota he, vah purnat: samtal dhruvit hota he
 This can be seen in the blue light of the sky, which is only the sunlight transmitted by the molecules of air
 jis prakaar yah maaloom karne ke liye ki koi prakaash samtal dhruvit he yaa nahin or yadi he to uskaa dhruvanatal koun-sa he, tourmaileen kaa upyog hota he, thik usee tarah dhruvan utpann karne ke uparyukt sabhi sadhano kaa upyog bhi is kaary ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The solution to produce this is that flat polarized light is injected onto a bipartite crystal, such as a mica plate, on a regular basis
 isse do bhinn ayaamon vaali samakonat: dhruvit kirane bhinn vegon se ek hi maarg par crystal main chalati hai
 On exiting from it, some time is generated in these two rays and by combining the two, ellipse polarized light is obtained
 yadi crystal pattica kii motaai itani ho ki kalantar 90 degree ho jaae to us pattica ko chaturthaansh tarangapattica kehete hai
 Rotating this fillet increases the amplitude of one beam and decreases the other
 jis sthiti main donon aayam baraabar ho jate hai, usamen pargamit prakaash vruttadhruvit ho jaataa he
 a quadrant wavelet is also used to identify such polarities
 yah ddeerghaavritiya athwa vrittiya companon kaa pun: do samakonik saral rekhaatmak companon main vighatan kar detaa he or pattica ko ghumaque yathochit sthiti main laane se vah unke kalantar ko gata yaa badhaakar 0 degree yaa 180 degree kar detaa he
 Therefore, the transmitted light becomes flat again polarized, which can be identified by tourmaline or nickel
 anshadhruvit athwa adhruvit prakaash se is kriya dwaara samtal dhruvit prakaash praapt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki anshadhruvit prakaash adhruvi tathaa samtal dhruvit prakaash kaa mishran hota he or adhruvit prakaash kaa tourmaileen dwaar lop kabhi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Having knowledge of the direction of vibrations in plane polarized light, a polar plane was conceived and defined as: The polar plane is the import plane of a perfectly flat polar beam obtained by reflection
 at: tourmaileen kii jis sthiti main is paravartit kiran kii tivrata nasht ho jaati he usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he
 a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate and then the polar surface of any polarized light can be seen from such tourmaline
 ise jaanane ke liye saralatam yukti yah he ki kisi andhere kamare main samtal dhruvit prakaash kii patali kiran urdhwadhar disha main chalaai jaae
 The path of the ray will remain invisible, but if the smoke of very thin particles is generated near this ray by burning the paper, the path of the beam will be visible due to the light transmitted from those particles
 kintu chaaron ore ghumkar dekhne se kisi ek dishavishesh main kiran adrishy hi rahegi
 Apparently scattering does not occur in this direction
 at: yahi kampan kii disha he, kyonki kampan kii disha main anuprastha tarang nahin chal sakati
 By this measure it has been known that the direction of vibration is right-angled from the polar plane, ie the vibrations of the reflected beam at the polar angle are right-angled from the emergency plane
 yahi baat anya upayon se bhi pramanit ho gai he
 According to the electromagnetic theory of light, each beam has both electromagnetic and magnetic vibrations, and they are also parasitic
 is siddhant se yah bhi prakat hota he ki dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main vaidyut kampan apattal se samakonik hote hai
 Therefore, it results that the vibrations of light affecting the eyes are electrical, not magnetic
 dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main companon ke apaat tal se samakonik hone kaa taatpary spashtat: yah he ki yadi apati kiran ke kampan apaat tal main hon, to uskaa paravartan dhruvak kone par bilkul hi nahin, hota
 Therefore, when the angle of incidence is equal to the polar angle, then the polar light in the emergency can be reflected, but the emergency cannot reflect the polar light at right angles
 jyotimaapan main is baat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki prakaash kii tivrata ko icchaanusaar ghataya ja sake or yah bhi ham yatharthatapurvak jaan saken ki is ghati purv tivrata main or purvavarti tivrata main kya anupaat he
 Two nickel prisms are used for this
 jab donon samaantar avasth main hote hai, tab to uttarottar donon main hokar nikalanevaale prakaash kii tivrata mahattam hoti hai, kintu yadi donon kii sthitiyon ke bich main kone ho to tivrata ke anupaat main ghat jaati he
 Polaroid can also be used for this purpose

 It was here that a fierce battle between the two took place when Rana Pratap and Mansingh came face-to-face - Pratap, riding on Chetak's back, placed the black-blue, Arabic-bred horse Chetak's feet on the head of the elephant of Akbar's commander Mansingh and With his spear, he made a catastrophic attack on King Mansingh, but immediately after sitting down in the elephant's strong cistern, his life was saved in this war - Huda Pratap's misdeeds and Turned badly and

 But knowing that Mansingh had not given permission to loot the city of Chittorgarh, Emperor Akbar was very angry at them and even banned their arrival in the court for some time
 james tod ke shabdon main- "jin dinon main akbar bhayanak rup se biimaar ho kar apane marane kii ashanka kar rahaa tha, maansingh khusro ko mogul singhaasana par bithaane ke liye shadyantron kaa jaal bicha diya tha

 If the relative price were different, it would have been easier to reduce the waiting time proportionally by arranging additional aircraft or doctors, and using them proportionately, at the expense of traveling proportionately or increasing medical facilities

 In this branch of Buddhism, the emphasis is on following ancient Tripitaka religious texts written in Pali language

 For him, Gautam Buddha is a guru and great man but no avatar or god
 ve unhen puujate nahin or na hi unke dharmik samarohon main buddha-puja hoti he
 While many celestial beings such as deities are believed in Mahayana Buddhist traditions, no such figure is worshiped in Theravada Buddhist traditions
 therwaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki har manushya ko swayan hi nirvana kaa maarg dhundhna hota he
 In these communities, it is considered very auspicious for young men to become monks and it is also a practice that a young man becomes a monk for a few days and then returns to the household

 They understand that all beings in the universe are connected to each other and it is necessary to love everyone and strive for everyone's nirvana

 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Om's mother, Bela Makhija, continues to encourage her son
 om ke dil kii dhadkan he-- desh kii sarvaadhik lokapriy film nayika, shantipriya 
 Omprakash gets two opportunities to approach Shantipriya
 pehla film 'drimigirl' ke premier par, jahaan om or pappu chaalaaki se ghus jate hai
 Another on the set of the film where Om saves Shanti from fire by playing on her life
 tab se om or shanti achche dost ban jate hai
 One day Om listens to the peace dispute with top producer Mukesh Mehra
 om ko yah jaanakar jhatka lagata he ki shanti mukesh se gupachup shaadi kar chuki he or garbhvatee he
 Mukesh is determined to keep his relations with Shanti a secret until his new film 'om Shanti Om' is completed
 shanti ko yah shaq he ki mukesh ek dhani vyavsaayee kii beti se vivaah kii yojana bana rahaa he
 She demands Mukesh his rights
 sab sunakar om kaa dil tut jaataa he
 One night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of the film 'om Shanti Om'
 vah kahata he ki vah film ko band kar degaa or saare samaaj ke saamne shanti se vivaah kar legaa
 But it turns out to be a trick of Mukesh
 vah shanti ko apni vittiya haani kaa kaaran samajhataa he
 So he sets the set on fire and leaves Shanti to die there
 om shanti ko bachaane kaa prayaas karata he par mukesh ke guard use aisa karne nahin dete

 He is very afraid of fire
 ek din kisi film kii shooting ke liye om us sthaan par jaataa he jahaan tees varsh pehle 'om shanti om' ke set main aag lagi thi
 Looking at the burnt set, memories of Om's past life begin to emerge
 phir ek party main om kaa saamana mukesh mehara se hota he jo is bich hollywood kaa safal film nirmaataa ban chukaa he
 On seeing him, Om remembers all the things of past life clearly
 tab uskaa bela or pappu se bhaavnaatmak punarmilan hota he
 Om Kapoor makes a plan together with Pappu, Bella and other companions to avenge Shanti's death
 om mukesh se tay karata he ki ve donon phir se 'om shanti om' film kaa nirmaan karenge
 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike
 unhen sandhyaa yaa 'sandy" naam kii yuvati milti he jo dekhne main shantipriya ke samaan or 'o ke' kii divaani he
 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh
 sandy shanti ke rup main mukesh ke samane baar baar aati he
 Mukesh thinks that he is the soul of peace and starts to fear
 lekin phir ek din mukesh jaan jaataa he ki yah yuvati koi or he, shanti nahin
 He becomes alert
 ant main set par om or mukesh main hathapayee hoti he
 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer
 shanti kii aatma om ko karun drushti se dekhakar muskuraati he or ojhal ho jaati he

 Dialects speak such a particular form of a language that a different community uses among the people speaking that language

 But sometimes the type of language used by a social class is also called 'dialect'
 kabhi-kabhi upbhasha ko boli bhi kehete hai, haalaanki yah shabd maanak bhashaaon ke liye bhi istemaal hota he
 a dialect is known by its grammar, vocabulary, accent and pronunciation
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak hindi or ruhelkhand kii khadiboli main shabdon or vyakaran kaa antar dikhataa he: Similarly, differences can be seen between the ordinary Punjabi language and the Hindu dialect of Punjabi: bhashavigyaan kaa ek kathan he ki 'fuj or nausena vaali upbhasha ko bhashaa kehete hai', yani agar kisi upbhasha ko bolne vaale apana rajya yaa samrajya banane main safal ho jaaen to use ek 'maanak bhashaa' kaa darja de dete hai or us se sambandhit anya boliyon ko us maanak bhashaa kii upbhasha kehane lagate hai
 By this process, standard Hindi is considered a language while Brajbhasha is called a sub-language

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin
 Sankalpita is a collection of selected essays by Mahadevi Varma
 gharshan : If another solid object is placed on a stationary solid object in such a way that both flat surfaces spur each other, in this case, the second object has to exert force to move the first object
 When the lower object is less than a limit, the second object cannot move on the first object
 It is clear from this statement that the contact rhythm of both the objects is produced in the opposite direction of a force speed which is the speed of the second object
 This opposing force is called 'friction'
 gharshan ek bal he jo do talon ke bich saapekshik sparshi gati kaa virodh karata he
 The value of the force of friction depends on the force of force between the two planes
 gharshan ke do prakaar hai: sthitik or gatij
 Static friction occurs in the parallel direction of the contact surface of two bodies, but kinetic friction does not depend on the direction of motion
 saamanyat: koi sataha purnataya chikani nahin hoti, apitu usamen atyalp pariman ke uthaav or gadde hote hai
 These can only be seen with good microscopes
 at: jab aisi do satahen ek duusare ko sparsh karti hai, to ek sataha ke uthaav duusari sataha ke gaddhon main fas jate hai
 In this state, applying force to move one surface to another creates distortions in the surface texture

 Friction has a very important place in our daily lives

 Therefore, friction is both a speed barrier and a seeker
 dharuk or snehakon ke vyavhaar main bhi gharshan kaa pramukh sthaan he
 The sand adopts a cone shape with the inclination angle of the internal friction
 In order to displace a solid substance on a solid surface, a force parallel to the tactile surface has to be applied
 yadi prayukt bal ek nishchit pariman se kam hua, to padarthpind visthapit nahin hota or yadi adhik hua to nishchit veg se visthapit hota he
 This is due to friction between the tangent surfaces, which implies that a force acts on the solid body against the force applied parallel to the tactile surface, called the force of friction
 gharshan bal kaa kaaran satahon kaa khurdurapan hota he
 The force of friction before displacement is equal to the force used, which is called static friction
 visthaapan ke liye prayukt bal kam se kam itane pariman kaa hona chahie ki vikruti charam pratyasthata se adhik ho
 The magnitude of this minimum force required for displacement is called extreme friction
 charam gharshanbal tathaa dono satahon ke bich abhilambi daab main nimnlikhi sambandh hota he : Whereas static dithering is called constant
 iskaa maan padarthpind ko sataha par rakhkar sataha par rakhkar sataha kaa nunatam jhukaav kone, jisapar padarthpind phislan prarambh kare, gyaat karke maaloom kar sakate hai
