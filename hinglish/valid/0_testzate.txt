 The three are essentially one
 at: teenon kii ek hi sankalpaikti tathaa ek hi buddhi he
 Yet there is a mutual difference between Father, Son and Holy Spirit
 pita kisi se utpann nahin hota
 The son from time immemorial assumes full divinity from the father

 The origin of the Holy Spirit is called fertility

 The reproduction of the son and diffusion with the Holy Spirit creates a mutual difference of the three persons, but essentially all three are one and are equally aligned with all divine qualities
 
 This theology has been pondered for centuries and many conceptions of the element have been misled

 Hearing the news of the birth of Bairam Khan's son, he himself went there and named the child "rahim"
 rahim ke pita bairam khan teraa varshiya akbar ke atali tathaa abhibhavak the
 Bairam Khan was conferred with the title of khan-e-khana
 ve humayun ke sadhu or antarang mitra the
 Rahim's mother was Sultana Begum, a beautiful and quality girl from Jamal Khan, a Mewati Rajput in present-day Haryana province

 After this, Rahim won wars in Gujarat, Kumbhalner, Udaipur etc
 is par akbar ne apane samay kii sarvocch oopaadhi 'miorj' se rahim ko vibhooshit kiya
 In 1584, Akbar honored Rahim with the title of khan-e-khana

 Bairam Khan gave full support in strengthening Akbar's kingdom with efficient policy
 kisi karanvash bairam khan or akbar ke bich matbhed ho gaya
 Akbar successfully suppressed the rebellion of Bairam Khan and expressed his desire to go on Haj, keeping the honor and honor of his master
 parinamswarup bairam khan haj ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 Bairam Khan stayed in Patan, Gujarat, and sat on the beach after boating at Patan's famous Sahasraling Sarovar, with the intention of offering an Afghan chieftain Mubarak Khan and deceitfully killed Bairam Khan
 yah mubarak khan ne apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye kiya
 This incident made Bairam Khan's family an orphan

 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court
 aise samay main akbar ne apane mahanata kaa saboot dete hue inako badi udaartaa se sharan diya or rahim ke liye kaha “ise sab prakaar se prasann rakho

 According to Dinkar Ji's statement, Rahim gave many times more space in his poems than the place Akbar gave to Hinduism in his deen-elahi
 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the
 New people were appointed to this post every two-three days
 samraat akbar ne is pad kaa kaam- kaaj sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye apane sachche tathaa vishwaas paatr amir rahim ko mustakil mir arj niyukt kiya
 The whole court was stunned upon hearing this decision
 is pad par asin hone kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti janata evam samraat donon main saamaanya rup se vishwasaneey he
 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education
 in mahaan logon main sher ahamed, mir kalaan or darbari vidwaan abulfjal the
 Despite the efforts of all the people, Shahzada Salim did not mind studying
 akbar ne sadaa kii tarah apana aakhri hathiyaar rahim khaane khaanaa ko saleem kaa atali niyukt kiya
 It is said that Rahim was very happy to get this glory

 Hajj is a sign of the solidarity of the Muslim people as well as their belief in Allah
 yah tirthayatra islamic calendar ke 12 wein or antim maheene dhu al hijjah kii 8 veen se 12 veen taarikh tak kii jaati he
 The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, therefore, it contains eleven days less than the Gregorian calendar used in Western countries, which is why the Haj dates vary from year to year according to the Gregorian calendar
 iharem wo vishesh aadhyatmik sthiti he jisamen musalmaan haj ko dauraan rahete hai
 Hajj has been associated with the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad since the 7th century, but Muslims believe that this ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca has been going on for thousands of years, that is, from the time of Abraham

 lekin lohia ji ke nidhan, dakshin main hindi-virdohi aandolan, rajanetaaon kii rajnatik laalasaaon ke kaaran yah aandolan safal na ho sakaa
 Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia, the pioneer of socialist politics, aimed at all language thinking and movement to remove the domination of English from Indian public life
 lohia ko angareji bhashaa maatr se koi aapatti nahin thi
 He was not even opposed to the rich literature of English, but he respected English as a language of thought and research
 hindi ke prachaar-prasar main mahatma gandhi ke baad sabase zyada kaam raamamanohar lohia ne kiya
 He was in favor of virtuous socialism
 unhone loksabhaa main kaha tha- When the Indian Constitution came into force in 1950, it was also provided that till 1965, English can be used as per convenience, but after that Hindi will be given the status of official language
 isse pehle ki sanvaidhanik samaysima puri hoti, dow raamamanohar lohia ne 1957 main angreji hataao muhim ko sakriy andolan main badal diya
 He started promoting this movement all over India
 1962-63 main jansangh bhi is andolan main sakriy rup se shaamil ho gaya

 It was not a language to be added to the country, but made it a language of the country
 lohia ne is baat kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki swadhinata andolan main hindi ne desh jodak bhashaa kaa kaam kiya he
 Unity has been established in the country, there is a possibility in this language even further
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi hindi ko rajkaaj, prashasan, court-kachhari kii bhashaa nahin bananaa chaahate to isaki jagah anya kisi bhi bhartiya bhashaa ko bana diya jaae
 If necessary, Hindi should also be included
 lekin bharat kii maatrubhaasha kii jagah angreji kaa varchasvvaad nahin chalanaa chahie
 When Lohia talks of 'removing English', it does not mean 'bringing Hindi'
 balki angareji hataane ke naare ke peeche lohia kii ek khaas samajhadaari he
 Lohia was in favor of bringing prestige to Indian languages in place of English imposed on the Indian public
 19 sitambar 1962 ko hyderabad main lohia ne kaha tha, For him, self-language was not the issue of politics but the question of his self-respect and the dream of filling millions with crores of inferior glands with confidence - dakshin ke hindi-virdohi ugr andolanon ke daur main lohia puure dakshin bharat main angareji ke khilaaf tathaa hindi va anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke paksh main andolan kar rahe the
 Unfortunately, some people in South India, because of their inclination towards Hindi, Lohia were seen as representatives of the North and Brahmin culture
 dakshin bharat main unke ‘angareji hataao’ ke naare kaa matlab ‘hindi lao’ liya jaataa tha
 Because of this, Lohia had to face many difficulties in holding meetings in South India
 san 1961 main madras or coimbatore main sabhaaon ke dauraan un par pathar tak phenke gaye
 Hyderabad was the center of activities of Lohia and the Socialist Party amid such incidents

 The city of Los Angeles is also the administrative headquarters of Los Angeles County and is the most densely populated and highly diverse county in the United States

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 vah 'oto phon bismark' ke naam se adhik prasiddh he
 He unified many Germanic states and established a powerful German empire
 vah dwitiya german samrajya kaa pratham chancelar bana
 He is famous for his policy of "realpalitic", due to which he is known by the nickname "iron Chancellor"
 vah apane yug kaa bahut bada kootneetijna tha
 Under his diplomatic treaties, France befriended France and made Germany the dominant power of Europe

 bismark kaa janm shun hausen main 1 april 1815 ko hua
 Studied law in Gatingen and Berlin
 baad main kuch samay ke liye naagarik tathaa sainik seva main niyukt hua
 In 1847, he became a member of the Legislative Assembly of Prasha
 1848-49 kii kranti ke samay usne raja ke "divya adhikaar" kaa joro se samarthan kiya
 In 1851, he was sent as a representative of the administration to the Federal Assembly of Frankfurt
 vahaan usne germany main austria ke aadhipaty kaa kadaa virodh kiya or prasha ko samaan adhikaar dene par bal diya
 He was appointed ambassador to Russia in 1859 after eight years in Frankfurt
 1862 main va paris main rajdoot banaaya gaya or usee varsh sena ke vistaar ke prashn par sansadeey sankat upasthit hone par vah pararashtramantri tathaa pradhan mantri ke pad par niyukt kiya gaya
 When he did not succeed in getting the approval of the restructuring of the army and passing the budget, he started working without asking the Parliament and he also collected tax from the public
 yah "sangharsh" abhi chal hi rahaa tha ki shlejavig holstin ke prabhutv kaa prashn pun: uth khadaa hua
 Taking advantage of the spirit of German nationalism, Bismarck invaded Denmark with the cooperation of Austria, and the two together merged the region into his kingdom
 do varsh baad bismark ne austria se bhi sangharsh ched diya
 Austria was defeated in the war and had to withdraw from Germany

 1871 main nae german rajya kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 It was now Bismarck's primary goal to make this newly established state well organized and dominant
 isi drushti se usne austria or italy se milakar ek trirashtra sandhi kii
 In order to reduce the threat of the "unfettered" power of the Pope, he enacted several laws for the power of the Catholics and tried to suppress the socialist movement
 isamen use adhik safalataa nahin mili
 Tensions and discontent arose in the empire
 antatagatva san 1890 main nae german samrat wiliam dwitiya se matbhed utpann ho jane ke kaaran usne padatyag kar diya
 Refuting the theory of liberals, Bismarck stated his policy in 1862 as follows: bismark kaa nishchit mat tha ki germany kaa ekikaran kabhi bhi france, rus, england evam austria ko sweekaar nahin hoga kyonki sanyukt germany europe ke shakti santulan ke liye sabase bada khatra hoga
 Therefore, Bismarck was convinced that the use of power was necessary for the unification of Germany
 bismark kaa mukhya uddeshy prasha ko shaktishaalee banaakar german sangh se austria ko baahar nikaalnaa evam germany main uske prabhaav ko samaapt karke prasha ke netritv main germany kaa ekikaran karnaa tha
 For this it was necessary that all power and authority of the state should be centered in the king
 bismark rajtantr main vishwaas rakhata tha
 Therefore, he tried to tie the entire nationality of Germany in one thread at the very center of the monarchy
 bismark ne apane sampoorn kaarykram ke dauraan is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhaa ki germany ke ekikaran ke liye prasha kii asmita nasht na ho jaae
 He was not willing to sacrifice Prussa, as Piedmont did for the unification of Italy
 vah prasha main hi germany ko samahit kar lenaa chahta tha
 Bismarck did not want unification of Germany from the bottom up, that is, instead of awakening the spirit of integration in a liberal way, he wanted to unify from above, that is, through diplomacy and blood and iron policies he wanted the subordination of the German states Situation should not be done
 is drushti se vah prasha ke germanykaran nahin balki germany kaa prashaakaran karnaa chahta tha
 Bismarck became chancellor of Austria in 1832 and completed the unification of Germany through his diplomacy, prudent blood and iron policy
 1870 i
 main ekikaran ke baad bismark ne ghoshnaa kii ki germany ek santusht raashtra he or vah upniveshvaadi prasar main koi ruchi nahin rakhata
 In this way he attempted to allay fears about the expansion of Germany
 bismark ko germany kii aantarik samasyaon se guzarana padaa
 He presented solutions to these problems

 After unification, industrialization took place rapidly in Germany
 kaarkaanon main mazdooron kii atishay vruddhi hui, kintu vahaan unki sthiti nimna rahi unke rahane-khaane kaa koi uchit prabandh nahin tha
 Due to deteriorating economic and social situation, the influence of socialists started increasing and considered them as their main enemy
 puure germany main kai tarah ke kanoon vyaapt the
 The wars during the integration led to a shortage of economic resources
 faltah desh kii aarthik pragati baadhit ho rahi thi
 Bismarck also faced a religious problem
 vastutah prasha ke log protestant dharm ke anuyaayi the jabaki germany ke anya rajyon kii praja adhikanshtah catholic dharm kii anuyaayi thi
 Catholics were strongly opposed to the unification of Bismarck because they feared that Protestant administration would suppress them
 austria or france ko parajeet kar bismark ne german catholic ko naaraaz kar diya tha, kyonki ye donon catholic desh the
 German Catholics were disillusioned when the Pope lost power from Rome and began to oppose Bismarck
 aarthik ekta or vikaas ke liye bismark ne puure germany main ek hi prakaar kii mudra kaa prachlan karaayaa
 For the convenience of traffic, the Railway Board was established and associated the Telegraph Department with the same

 Their key leaders were jailed
 samachar-patron or sahitya par kathor pabandi laga di gai
 Along with these repressive measures, Bismarck began to use "state-socialism" to distance the workers from socialists
 iske tahat usne mazdooron ko yah dikhaaya ki rajya swayan mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liy prayatnsheel he
 He implemented several insurance schemes, pension schemes for the benefit of his laborers
 striyon or baalkon ke kaam karne ke ghanton ko nishchit kiya gaya

 As a result, in 1884 AD, Bismarck established several trading posts in the eastern and southern-western parts of Africa and broke out of the union of the three emperors
 usne kaha ki bismark ne ek mitra kaa paksh lekar duusare mitra ko kho diya he
 Austria's friendship with Bismarck was more beneficial because Germany had more influence in the event of a treaty between Austria, so in 1879 a duel was signed
 5 rus kaa germany se vilag ho janaa bismark ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya
 He felt that Russia should not enter into a friendship treaty with France
 atah usne turant hi rus ke saath sambandh sudhaarney kaa praytn kiya
 In 1881 he also got success
 ab germany, rus or austria ke bich sandhi ho gayi
 5 Now Bismarck turned his attention to Italy and made a treaty with Italy and wanted to completely separate France from European politics
 isi samay france or italy donon hi africa main sthit tunis par adhikaar karne ko icchhuk the
 Bismarck encouraged France to seize Tunis so that goodwill would spread in favor of Germany in France and France would become embroiled in imperialism, thereby removing talk of revenge from Germany
 1881 main france ne tunis par adhikaar kar liya jisase italy naaraaz hua
 Taking advantage of Italy's displeasure, Bismarck in 1882 executed a threesome treaty between Italy, Germany and Austria
 bismark ne nai 'sandhi pranali' ko janm diya
 He made various groups by making an alliance
 is sandhi pranali kii visheshta yah thi ki saamanyatya itihaas main jitani bhi sandhiyaan hui hai ve yudhkaal main hui thi
 But Bismarck gave rise to a new approach by giving rise to the treaty system in peacetime
 teen samraaton kaa sangh : videshniti ke kshetra main sandhi pranali ke tahat bismark kaa pehla kadam tha
 In 1872, a union of three emperors was formed, including Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, Tsar II of Russia and Emperor Willian i of Germany
 yadhyapi yah in teen deshon ke madhya koi likhit sandhi nahin thi, tathaapi kuch baton par sahmati hui thi
 They had agreed that in order to maintain peace in Europe and to deal with the socialist movement, they continued to cooperate and exchange ideas with each other
 yah sandhi bismark kii mahaan kootnithik vijay thi, kyonki ek taraf to usne cedova kii parajeet shakti austria ko mitra bana liya to duusari taraf france ke liye austria evam rus kii mitrataa kii sambhaavna ko samaapt kar diya
 But after some time this union broke up because the interests of Russia and Austria clashed in the Balkan region
 atah bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha
 In the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria, in which he favored Austria
 faltah rus usase naaraaz ho gaya
 To deal with religious issues and make the state paramount, Bismarck passed several laws against the Church
 1872 main jesuit samaaj kaa bahishkaar kar diya or prasha tathaa pope kaa sambandh-viched ho gaya
 According to the law passed in 1873, marriages started with the permission of the state courts, in which there was no need of the church
 shikshan sansthaaon par rajya kaa adhikaar ho gaya tathaa carch ko milane vaali sarkari sahaayta band kar di gai
 Despite these laws, Catholics did not bow down
 atah bismark ne samaajwaadiyon kii chunautiyon ko zyada khatarnaak samajhate hui catholicon ke saath samjhauta kiya
 Under this, laws against Catholics were repealed and established political relations with the Pope
 germany ke ekikaran ke pashchaat 1871 main bismark kii videsh niti kaa pramukh uddeshy europe main germany kii pradhanta ko banaae rakhana tha
 As a policy measure, it declared that Germany was a happy state and had no interest in territorial expansion
 bismark ko france se sarvaadhik bhay tha kyonki alses-lauren kaa kshetra usne france se praapt kiya tha, jisase france bahut asantusht tha
 Bismarck was confident that the French would not forget their 1870–71 defeat and the alsace-laurent region
 atah uski videsh niti kaa mukhya uddeshy france ko europe main mitraviheen rakhana tha taaki vah germany se yuddh karne kii sthiti main na aa sake
 In this way, the fundamental principles of Bismarck's foreign policy were - using practical opportunistic diplomacy to isolate the anti-german powers and make France devoid of allies, oppose liberalism and believe in militarism
 uski sandhi pranali ne pratisndhiyon ko janm diya
 As a result, a tense atmosphere was created in Europe and thus Europe reached the brink of World War I
 bismark kii videshniti ne europe main sanyeekaran evam shastreekaran ko badhaava diya
 This policy brought Europe to the threshold of the First World War
 bismark ne sabhi sandhiyaan paraspar virdohi rashtron ke saath kii thi
 Maintaining coordination between them was a very difficult task, which only a diplomat like Bismarck could do
 atah 1890 main pad tyaag karne ke pashchaat yah paddati ghaatak ho gai or germany ke viruddh france, rus aadi guton kaa nirmaan hua
 In this way, Bismarck's foreign policy in turn created the background of the First World War
 bismark kii gutbandi kii niti ke kaaran germany ke viruddh doosraa gut bana or ant main sampurna europe do sashastr evam shaktishaalee guton main vibhajit ho gaya
 The culmination of which appeared in the First World War
 1887 main bismark ne rus ke saath punaraashwaasan sandhi kii jiske tahat donon ne ek-duusare ko sahaayta dene kaa vachan diya
 This treaty was kept secret
 yah bismark kii kootnithik vijay thi kyonki ek hi saath germany ko rus or austria kii mitrataa praapt hui
 Bismarck tried to forge friendly relations with Britain
 bismark kaa maananaa tha ki britain ek nausainik shakti he or jab tak uski nausena ko chunauti nahin di jaaegi, tab tak vah kisi raashtra kaa virdohi nahin hoga
 Therefore, to please Britain, Bismarck did not take any step to increase the German Navy
 britain kii khush karne ke liye usne ghoshnaa kii ki germany samrajyavaadee desh nahin he
 England, on the other hand, had a colonial rivalry with France, taking advantage of which Bismarck developed good relations with Britain

 It is now believed that there may have been many cases of syphilis from early cases of leprosy
 It is now known that leprosy is neither transmitted through sexual contact nor is highly contagious after treatment because about 95% of people are naturally immunized and people suffering from it also after only 2 weeks of treatment They do not remain contagious

 Where taboos are strong, patients in those areas may be forced to hide their position, so that discrimination can be avoided
 Due to lack of awareness about Hansen's disease, people can believe that the disease is highly contagious and incurable

 There was only a narrow path to go or exit and there were houses all around
 bhaagane kaa koi rasta nahin tha
 Some people jumped into the only well in the field to save lives, but on seeing that well, the well was also covered with corpses

 On the plaque in the garden it is written that 120 bodies were found only from a well

 The massacre led to worldwide condemnation, under whose pressure the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montague, appointed the Hunter Commission in late 1919 to investigate it
 kamishan ke saamne brigadier general rejinold diar ne sweekaar kiya ki vah goli chalaa kar logon ko maar dene kaa nirnay pehle se hi le kar vahaan gaya tha or vah un logon par chalaane ke liye do topein bhi le gaya tha jo ki us sankare raste se nahin ja pai thim

 punjab tab tak mukhya bharat se kuch alag chalaa karata tha parantu is ghatana se punjab puri tarah se bhartiya swatantraaa andolan main sammilit ho gaya
 As a result, Gandhi started the non-cooperation Movement in 1920

 This further ignited the fire of hatred of Wazir Ali, and he summoned his loyal warlords, Izzat Ali and Waris Ali, and secretly prepared the Lashkar of 200 soldiers
 14 janvari 1799 ko is jang kaa aagaaj ho gaya
 Wazir Ali expressed his desire to meet the then Commander George Frederick Cherry against the decision to remove himself from Benares

 However, the rebels then had to retreat and thousands of rebels joined the Nawab at these times

 The rebels could not stand in front of Arskin's heavy army

 Then the then British emperor of Jaipur gave him a banquet to stay here
 nawab ke saath dhokaa karke usne 1799 main vajeer ali ko angrejon ke hawaale kar diya
 The British sent Wazir Ali to Fort William Jail in Kolkata

 kushti ke anek akhaade apane kshetra main banane ke saath-saath woli-ball, badminton, nishane baaji kii academy tayar kii hai
 Every day, he himself plays badminton with the youth
 unke saath kareeb se jud rahe hai, unako prerit karte hai saath-saath gym bhi karte hai
 At the age of 60, he created a curvy personality like a 30-year-old boy
 khud ko naveen pidi ke saath kadam se kadam milaake chalanaa koi inase siikhe
 susheel kumaar, yogeshwar dutt evam sakshi malik ne desh ke liye medal laakar kushti ko antarrashtriya str par sthapit kar diya
 He was fond of wrestling since childhood, but MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has wrestling as well as other hobbies
 Being healthy is also his hobby, which he has used since childhood
 Every day, he himself plays badminton with the youth
 He is closely associated with them, motivates them as well as gym
 Now even at the age of 60, 30 years old ojasvi vaani evam chumbakeey vyaktitv vaale brijbhushan sharan singh ko lekhan, gayan evam sahitya se vishesh lagaav he
 Songs, poems are often recited in his speeches
 bahut prachlit hai inke bhaashan ore janata ke vishesh aagrah par aksar apane vichaaro ke madhyam se jan-jan tak pahuchaate hai
 MP Brijbhushan Sharan Singh gave the slogan of green gonda some time ago
 or in vaakyon ko kaaphi had tak puraa karke dikhaaya
 Apart from Gonda, the leader has planted more than 5 lakh trees in all the nearby districts till now
 chuki bachapan se prakruti se inako vishesh lagaav rahaa he
 So far 50 lakh trees have been planted by people, workers, by their inspiration
 inkaa ped lagavane kaa bada hi anoothaa andaaz he
 The worker is told that you will come to tea at home tomorrow and be ready to plant trees with your family
 ghar ghar jaakar vriksharopan kii is muhim ko din pratidin aage bada rahe he
 MP g distributes 5 xxrep 4 0 trees every year
 sach much adhbhut he inkaa ye andaaz
 The barren land of Purvanchal used to be muddy
 aaj vah lakho kii taadaat main prakruti premi saansad brijbhushan sharan singh kii prerana swarup hariyaali nazar aa rahi he
 By adding more than 51 organizations with themselves, they are taking this task forward day by day
 wo kehete he ki vriksh na keval dharti ko upjau banaate hai balki hamaare jivan main bhi chaitanyata utpann karte hai
 If we want to protect our civilization and culture, we should not only plant more and more trees but also nurture and protect them
 hawa, pani or mitti kaa pradooshan vrikshon kii badhotaree se hi dur ho saktaa he
 Lok Sabha MP Shri Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is not only interested in sports but also has the passion for development through education
 unka maananaa he ki "ashikshit" samaaj desh par sabase bada kalank he
 Illiteracy is the biggest obstacle in the development of the country and its own development
 shiksha kisi ek varg yaa pidi ke liye nahin he balki yah sabake liye hai
 Education plays an important role in social change
 shiksha manushya ke jivan kaa maarg prashast karti he
 They say that education helps human beings to recognize fortunes
 shiksha vaastavik arthon main jivan jeena sikhaati he
 In today's scientific age it is impossible to progress without getting education
 shiksha ke mahatv ko dekhte hue ise adhik vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he jiske chalate unhone sirf apane sansadeey kshetra main hi nahin balki anya jagahon par bhi vidyalayon, sansthaanon kaa nirmaan kiya or shiksha ke jariye desh ke vikaas kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 High level institutes were formed in which library, lab for experimental classes, sports ground are all facilities
 vidhyalay main nirdhan chaatro ko prativarsh chaatravrutti bhi uplabdh karai jaati he
 Meritorious students are also honored every year
 board kii kakshaon main ganit or vigyaan sankaay main sarvocch ank praapt karne vaale vidhyaarthiyon ko gold medal dene kii parampara bhi hai
 About 54 institutes were established in which around 500-600 students are getting education in each institute

 Ustad Ali Akbar Khan was a well-known sarod maestro and a seeker of Hindustani classical music
 ustad ali akbar khan ko padam bhushan or padam vibhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha or pichley paanch dashakon se unhone duniya main bhartiya shastreey sangeet kaa jhanda buland rakhaa tha
 He had a great contribution in the field of making Indian classical music iconic in the West
 ali akbar khan kaa janm avibhajit bharat ke purvi bengal main komila ke shivpur gaanv main 14 april 1922 ko hua tha, jo ab bangladesh main hai
 He started teaching classical singing and classical music at the age of three from his father Baba Alauddin Khan
 ve apane chachaa fakir aftabuddin ke bhi shagird rahe
 Ali Akbar Khan's father made him versed in many instruments
 lekin antat: unhone sarod vaadan par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa nirnay liya
 At the age of 13, he presented his first public show in Allahabad and his first gramophone recording was done in Lucknow
 1956 main ali akbar khan ne kolkata main 'ali akbar khan sangeet mahavidhyalay' kii sthapana kii or desh-videsh main shastreey sangeet ke shikshan or prasar ko hi apana mishan bana liya
 Khan Sahab was married thrice and has 11 sons and daughters
 unke putr ashish khan ek mashhoor sarod vadak hai
 88-year-old Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, who specializes in stringed instruments, created immortal compositions for Hindustani classical music
 vah america ke san franciscon main sthaayee rup se rahane lage the
 This son of Ustad Alauddin Khan was once described by violinist Ehudi Menuhin as "the great musician of the world"
 vah america main shastreey sangeet kaa lanbaa kaarykram dene vaale or america tivi par sarod vaadan karne vaale pehle bhartiya shastreey sadhak the
 His close Pandit Charanjit Chaturlal had described him as a saint and said that seekers of classical music like Ustad visit once in centuries
 unhone kaha ki unke pita or guru baba allaudin khan kehete the ki ali akbar khan kaa janm keval sarod ke liye hua hai
 Apart from solo shows, his duo in India with artists like Gurubhai Ravi Shankar and in the west with Jewish menuhin or John Handy is quite famous
 ali akbar khan sahab ko bharat sarkaar kii ore se padam vibhushan or padmabhushan puraskaron se vibhooshit kiya gaya tha
 In addition, he was nominated for a Grammy Award five times between 1970 and 1998
 khan shastreey sangeet ke pehle aise sadhak the, jinhen 1991 main macarthar foundation kii faillowship pradaan kii gai
 Khan could not get the Grammy Award but five times between 1970 and 1998 he was nominated for this prestigious award
 kalil yaa colide ek rasaynic mishran hota he jisame ek vastu duusari vastu me samaan rup se parikshepit hoti he
 The particles of the dispersed object remain suspended only in the mixture and not as a solution
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki kalil me kanon kaa aakaar vilyan me upasthit kanon ke aakaar se bada hota he - yah kan itane chote hote hai ki mishran me puri tarah parikshepit ho kar ek samroop mishran taiyaar karen, lekin itane bade bhi nahin hote hai ki prakaash ko prakirnit karen or naa ghulein
 Due to this reflection, some of the solutes look like solution
 kisi kalil pranali kii do pruthak pravasthaayen hoti hai: pehali parikshepan pravastha or duusari satat pravastha 
 a particle system can be solid, fluid or gaseous
 neeche kii talika me ek samroop or asamroop mishran me kalil ke kanon kaa vyas kaa tulanaatmak vishleshan he
 : isliye, kalileey nilamban, samroop or asamroop mishranon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 The word colloid is used in English for Kalil
 yah shabd greek bhashaa ke cola shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'sares' hota he
 In 1861, an English scientist, Thomas Graham, observed that albumin, glue, glue, demand, silicic acid, and other similar substances were not able to filter through the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water
 iske vipareet sharkara, uria, sodium, chloride ityadi ke jalavilayan jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikal jate hai
 The former type is found in most of the amorphous form on the basis of this property
 Soluble substances in water are divided into two classes: those substances which were crystalline and after solution in water can be released from the pores of the bio-membranes
 , Called crystalloids, and others, which were amorphous and could not be able to come out of the pores of the bio-membrane when dissolved in water, were called kalil
 kintu ab yah siddh ho gaya ki sharkara or sodium chloride aadi crystalia padaarth bhi upyukt madhyam main kalil ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the foliage, the fissile particles are scattered in a continuous medium
 is prakaar kalilon main do sanghatak rahete hai
 In the list below, first name is of medium and second name is of distributed substance: kalilkanon kaa aakaar vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The particles are larger in size than molecules, but they are smaller in size than all particles that can be seen under a microscope
 inkaa vistaar 10-5 sein
me
 se 10-7 sein
me
 tak hota he
 Although the copies of each mail in the above list can be obtained, there are more types of types used and these have been studied in more detail
 jal ke madhyam main vitarit thos yaa drav ke kalil ko saul kaha jaataa he
 Both organic and inorganic substances are found in many forms in the mumps
 vaigyanik yaa pravidhik, kadachit hi koi aisi shakha ho jisamen kalilon kaa mahatvapurn upyog na hota ho
 Due to its superiority, science has become especially special
 kalilon ke gunon main bhed hone kii drushti se unhen do pradhan virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The first class has metallic types of plumes, such as gold plumes etc
, and the second class has protein types of plumes, such as gelatin
 inke vishesh gun nimnlikhit hai : The words which have special use for both these types of plumes are hydrologist and water lover
 inhen angreji main krmanusaar lyophobic or lyophilic bhi kaha jaataa he
 This classification cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, since some properties of certain clades are intermediate to the unreduced properties of both extreme classes
 is prakaar ke jalakalilon main kuch dhatviya oxiden yaa hydroxiden, kuch aviley fasphet, molibdet, tungstate ityadi hai
 Some people divide the Kalils into two classes of Alambabh and Payasabha
 inke atirikt kalilon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo ab vishesh mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 This class is called the Kaliyala Vidyutulasi
 sabun kaa jalakalil iskaa lakshanik udhaaharan he
 These waterways also have electronegativity
 parishkarakon ke rup main ab inkaa adhik upyog hone laga hai
 Brown motion can be seen with the help of a microscope in the buds
 vilyanon main yah kriya nahin hoti
 When a skin is sent through the center of the waterway by focusing the beam, the beam becomes milky and the outgoing rays acquire fluidity
 iske kaaran hai kalilkanon ke aakaar or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa vitarit padaarth ke vartanaank or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa viparit padaarth ke vartanaank kaa avichhinn madhyam ke vartanaank se adhik hona
 With the help of powerful microscopes, the talcus can be seen by the effect of the Tyndall
 is prakaar dekhe jane par kalilkan prakashit taron kii bhanti dikhaai padate hai
 Also their speed is quick, irregular and continuous
 is gati ko hi brounian gati kehete hai
 At the same speed, the ideas of the theory of dynamics of substances have been experimentally confirmed
 aavogadro niyatank ko is siddhant ke anusaar nikaalane par yah siddh ho gaya he ki praayogic truti kaa vichaar karke is vidhi se nikaale gaye aavogadro-niyatank ke maan anya vidhiyon ke nikaale gaye is niyatank ke maan se samya rakhte hai
 Perrin has taken the value of Avogadro constant 6
510E23 by examining the mastic glue
 prayog main upyukt mastic gond ke kalilkanon kaa ardhavyas 6
5 x 10-4 tha
 For many technical methods, it is necessary to create a color
 jalasantrasi kalil hi saralata se banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki jalpremi kalil utkramntic hai
 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
 arq ke ucch taap par dhaatu vashpikrut ho jaati he
 Then the superfluous particles of vapor get integrated and form the shape of the particles
 vastav main vibhaajan dwaara kalil banane kaa pramukh saadhan kalil-mil he
 In this device, two plates, which are very close to each other, rotate in opposite directions
 vitarit kiya janevaala padaarth uchit madhyam ke saath in donon platon ke bich se bheja jaataa he
 In this way, the particles become smaller and take the shape of darker particles
 donon main se kisi bhi vidhi se nirmit kalilon ke shodhan ke liye unhen manibhabh padaarth se apohan dwaara pruthak kriya jaataa he
 To do this Kalil is placed in a parchment or cellophane bag
 is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein
me
 vilyan dwaara, jiskaa sandran 10 pratishat ho, avakshipt kiya ja sake
 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 The uneven distribution of electrosynthesis leads to complexity in some buds due to an action called dononsantulation
 is tanupat santulan kii kriya kaa adhyayan congou red naamak rang, sabun tathaa anya kai kalileey vidyudvishleshyon par kiya gaya he
 In these conditions the collicular substance behaves like an electrodynamic
 jab kisi aayan kaa aakaar kalilkanon ke aakaar ke samaan hota he jab tanupat ke donon ore vibhav kaa srijan hota he, jise tanupat vibhav kehete hai
 In many protein cells, dilution-potential always arises and charge on living cells is due to this equilibrium balance
 ati sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se kalilkanon kaa aakaar yaa rup nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Nevertheless the number of calculus can be counted; The average volume of a particle can then be determined by the value of the absolute volume of the distributed matter
 kintu jab saul nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab usamen kai aakaar ke kan upasthit rahete hai
 The form of the calculus can be spherical, lanceolate, elliptical or flaky
 kalilkanon kaa rup gyaat karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan viksit kii gai hai jo prakaashiya gunon par aadhaarit hai
 These plumes are characterized by having an impact on the viscosity of the delivery medium
 shyanta adhiktar bad jaati he or vitarit padaarth kii maatra kii vruddhi ke saath shghrita se badhati jaati he
 Viscosity increases so much when a particular concentration is reached that Kalil takes the form of jelly
 saul ke avakshepan se bhi jelly praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of jelly is limited and the semipermeable gels that are made by cooling the gelatine, agar agar, starch, etc
 are called jelly
 adhikansh jalpremi kalil sheetaleekaran par yaa garm karne par jelly banaate hai
 Many inorganic hydrological plants can also be obtained as jelly under special conditions
 is prakaar se kai jaleey hydraxidon, aviley faspheton, molibdeton kii jeliyaan prayogshaala main banaai jaati hai
 The jelly generally exhibits the properties of liquid release
 adhik samay tak rakhane par jelly sikudti tathaa chatak jaati he or jelly main bandhaa hua jal baahar nikal aata he
 Jails can be divided into two classes: elastic and rigid
 pratyasth jeliyaan saadhaarant: gelatin, aighar aadi prakritik kalilon se banati hai, kintu adhikansh acarbonic jeliyaan, jinamein silisik amla bhi rahata he, drudh vyavhaar dikhaati hai
 Some jails have a strange nature
 ve hilaane par, andolit karne par yaa karnathit tarangon ke prabhaav se pun: saul main parivartit ho jaati hai
 But if they are kept stable then they become jelly again
 yah kriya kai baar duharai ja sakati he
 This action is called tactile sense
 jalpremi kalilon main proteinon ke saulon par vishesh khojein hui hai
 The reason for this is their importance in physical chemistry
 proteinon ke jo saul prakritik avasthaa main paae jate hai ve saadhaarant: rinatmak aveshwale hote hai
 Most solutes achieve positive charge when made acidic
 is prakaar ek vishesh pi ech par protein ke saul par koi bhi aavesh nahin hoga
 This is called isocele point
 isi se protein kii pahchaan haati he
 The chemical properties are ancient amphoteric because it has more bona fides
 is gun ke kaaran protein bafar kaa kaam detaa he
 This quality has special significance in the life of animals
 proteinon main jalasantrasi kalilon ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa samarthy rahata he or inaki swarnsankhya kii sahaayta se kai rogon ke nidaan main sahaayta milti he
 It is not possible to calculate all the uses of the plants
 adhikansh jaivik taral padaarth, jaise rakt aadi, swabhaav ke hote hai
 As calcium-soap, metals such as calcium, gold, iron, gold, manganese, silver, etc
, or their insoluble compounds, are used in medicine in the form of kalil
 aahaar vigyaan main kalileey padaarthon par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 The humic and clayey soil properties have a special effect on soil fertility and its physical properties
 reshe carbonic kalil hai or kapadaa udyog bhi kalileey udyog hi he
 The color and printing used in the manufacture of chintz is done only because of the color properties
 kuch abhikaarakon main celulosiya padaarth ke kalileey gunon par kritrim resham kaa nirmaan aadhaarit he
 Soaps and detergents are the waste materials and many substances, such as lubricants, plastics, rubber, lubricants, oily dyes, etc
, are found to have scleenic properties
 kaanch, mrittika tathaa cement udyog kalileey vigyaan se vishesh rup se sambhddha hai
 Most of our diets, such as proteins, carbohydrate fats in the form of starch, etc
 are also lax in properties
