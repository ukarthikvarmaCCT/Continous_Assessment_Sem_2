 According to Dashrath Sharma, Hammir Chauhan defeated King Jayasimha of Mandalgarh Udaipur and kept him captive in Ranthambore, after that Hammir Dev left him on the point that he would continue to give the Ranthambore empire forever and in the interest of every possible Ranthambore empire

 Prominent victories of Hammir Dev include: - is prakaar doctor gopinath sharma ne hammir dev chouhan ko saulah nrip mardaani evam dow dasharath sharma ne saulah vijay kaa karn kahkar pukaara he
 The kingdom where Hammir Dev invaded became part of the Ranthambore empire and perhaps this is the reason why Hammir Dev Chauhan started going to the stubborn emperor of India

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 In Medina, Hazrat Muhammad had improved relations between the various existing communities
 The constitution of Madina specifying community relations was rewritten from Hazrat Muhammad's Salah, which led to the formation of an independent community, and the first Islamic state
 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In the Quran, Muhammad is also referred to as "ahmad"
 The law of universal brotherhood and the principle of human equality, which you proclaim, is a reflection of the great contribution that Hazrat Muhammad made to the social upliftment of humanity

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 According to a custom, Allah’s Rasul has said that "I am the best speaking Arab, so i was born in Quraysh and grew up in Saad"
 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 The terms of these treaties were different for every princely state, but basically under every treaty, the princely states had to take the permission of the British on matters related to foreign affairs, relations and agreements with other princely states and the army and security
 The British rule was directly on the British and in return the British government allowed the rulers to rule independently

 This article has been translated from this version of the Wikipedia article Black hole
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr yaa blike hole yaa krishna vivar itane shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra vaali koi aisi khagoleey vastu hoti he jiske khinchaav se prakaash-sahit kuch bhi na batch sake
 Around the black hole there is a boundary called the event horizon in which things can fall but nothing can come out
 ise "kaala" isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki yah apane upar padane vaale saare prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he or kuch bhi paravartit nahin karata
 It is exactly like a perfect black body in thermodynamics
 kalenidr kaa kwantum vishleshan yah darshata he ki unamem taapmaana or hawking vikiran hota he
 Despite its invisible interior, a black hole can make its presence visible through interactions with other substances
 masalan kalenidr kaa pataa taron ke kisi samooh kii gati se lagaaya ja saktaa he jo antariksh ke khaali dikhaai dene vaale ek hisse kii parikrama kar rahe hon
 Alternatively, with a companion star, you can see the gas dropping into a relatively small black hole
 yah gas sarpil aakaar main andar kii taraf aati he, bahut ucch taapmaana tak garm ho kar badi maatra main vikiran chhodti he jiskaa pataa prithvi par sthit yaa prithvi kii kaksha main gumti doorabeenon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 As a result of such observations, a scientific consensus has emerged that, despite their non-appearance, black holes exist in our universe
 inhen vidhiyon se vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki hamaari gallexi, kshirmarg, ke kendra main sthit dhanu e* naamak radio strot main ek vishalkay kalachhidr sthit he jiskaa dravyaman hamaare suraj ke dravyaman se 43 lakh guna he
 Theoretically, a substance of any quantity can become a black hole if it is compressed within a space whose radius is equal to its equivalent Schwarzschild radius

 ke andar hone par yah kalenidr main parivartit ho sakate hai
 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force
 in dabaavon se ubarkar or adhik sankuchit hone main sakasham hone ke liye ek taare ke liye aavashyak nunatam dravyaman tolman - oppenheimer - volcophf dwaara prastaavit had he, jo lagbhag teen saura dravyaman he
 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km
 isse kai guni adhik duriyon ke liye, kalenidr kii guruttvakarshan shakti samaan dravyaman vaale kisi bhi anya sharir kii guruttvakarshan shakti ke thik baraabar hoti he, bilkul surya ke samaan
 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5
5 karod prakaash vashon kii duuri par
 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox
 duusari ore, pramaatra gurutv ke bare main vichaar, yah suzav dete hai ki vahaan keval ek simit parimit utkram maap ho sakati he jo kshitij ke paas ke antariksh se sambandhit hogi: lekin kshitij ke utkram maap main parivartan or hawking vikiran kaa utkram maap sarvatha paryaapt hota he un padaarth or urja ke sabhi utkram maapon ko apane main samahit karne ke liye jo blike hole main gir rahen hon
 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood
 khaas kar, ek pramaatra str par, hawking vikiran kii pramaatra avasthaa nirdhaarit hoti he keval is baat se ki blike hole main purv main kya gir chukaa he; or itihaas ki blike hole main kya gira tha ekmaatr nirdhaarit hoti he blike hole or vikiran ke pramaatra avasthaa dwaara
 This determinism and centralization will be required
 lambey samay tak stephen hawking ne is vichaar kaa birodh kiya, apni mul 1975 kii sthiti par ve ade rahe ki hawking vikiran puri tarah se tapiya he isliye purnataya avyavasthit he, blike hole dwaara purv main nigle gaye padaarthon kii koi bhi jaankaree maujuud nahin rahati he; unhonen tark diya ki is jaankaree kaa lop ho chukaa he
 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary
 hawking kii nai gananaa kaa visheshgy vaigyanik samudaay dwaara moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki unke upyog kiye tareeke anjaane or sandigdh anurupata vaale hai
 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in
 leonard saskind or nobel puraskaar vijeta jerard tii hooft ne yah suzav diya he ki blike hole ke chaaron or ke triayami antariksh ko ghatana kshitij ke ek dwiaiami vyavhaar dwaara purna rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox
 is vichaar ko string siddhant ke arntagat samayik kiya gaya he, tathaa holographic siddhant ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Disinfection Reactor The character used for a reaction or reaction is called an enzyme reactor or a dilution reactor
 riyectaron kaa upyog batch yaa satat pranali main kiya ja saktaa he
 There are several types of enzyme reactors: jalavirohi prabhaav adhruviya padaarthon ko jal yaa jaleey gholon main daalane par jal se alag hokar aapas main ekatrit hone kii pravriti ko kehete hai
 This is actually the process of water molecules, because they are polar and their opposite charge poles push and collect the inert matter in the attempt to stay close to each other
 jalavirohi prabhaav hi kaaran he ki tel or jal ko milakar chhodane par tel or pani alag ho jate hai
 Many effects in biology are seen with this watertight, including formation of cell membranes, formation of protein molecules, etc
 isliye jalavirohi prabhaav jivan ke liye aavashyak he

 "when he got out of jail in 1942, he had to show that despair in the Indian society was there, all were frustrated
 at: unhone 'congress pratinidhi asembli' naamak sanstha kii sthapana kar pun: nai chetana kaa sanchaar kiya or jab prantiya cametiyaan bani tab 'pratinidhi asembli' bhang kar di gai
 Tandon was the President of Allahabad Municipal Corporation and did many daring and historical works
 ve 1946 main bharat kii samvidhan sabha main bhi chune gaye
 Member of Lok Sabha in 1952 and Rajya Sabha member in 1957
 is prakaar ve aaajeevan bhartiya raajnneeti main sakriy rahakar use disha pradaan karte rahe
 Rajarshi Purushottam Das Tandon was the leader of the leading line of the Indian National Movement
 kuch vichaarkon ke anusaar swatantraaa praapt karnaa unka pehla saadhy tha
 He considered Hindi as a means - "if Hindi comes in the way of Indian freedom, i myself will strangle him
" ve hindi ko desh kii aazaadee ke pehle aazaadee praapt karne kaa saadhan maanate rahe or aazaadee milane ke baad aazaadee ko banaaye rakhane kaa
 "it should not be forgotten here that Tandon's entry into politics was due to his love for Hindi
 tandon ji ne gwalior ke victoria college main hindi ke lekturer ke rup main kaary kiya us samay atal bihari vaajapei victoria college ke chaatr hua karte the
 On 17 February 1951, on the occasion of the 17th anniversary celebration of Muzaffarnagar 'suhrid Sangh', Tandon ji said- "I entered into an organization like Congress with the aim of strengthening the Hindi side, because Hindi's influence on my heart is the most
 It was more and i made him the greatest vow of my life
 xxrep 6 
 hindi sahitya ke prati mere prem ne uske swaarthon kii raksha or uske vikaas ke path ko spasht karne ke liye mujhe raajnneeti main sammilit hone ko baadhya kiya
 "therefore, it can be said that Tandon Ji had both the independence and Hindi
 rajarshi main balykaal se hi hindi ke prati anuraag tha
 Balakrishna Bhatt and Madan Mohan Malaviya ji gave maturity to this love
 10 oktover 1910 ko kaashi main hindi sahitya sammelan kaa pratham adhiveshan mahaamanaa malviya ji kii adhyakshata main hua or tandon ji sammelan ke mantri niyukt hue
 Subsequently, he served Hindi extensively through Hindi Sahitya Sammelan
 tandon ji ne hindi ke prachaar prasar ke liye hindi viapeeth prayag kii sthapana kii
 The purpose of setting up this Chair was to spread Hindi education and end the domination of English
 sammelan hindi kii anek parikshaayen sampann karata tha
 Due to these examinations, Hindi was also spread in the south
 sammelan ke is kaary kaa prabhaav mahavidhyalayon evam vishvavidhyalayon main bhi padaa, anek mahavidhyalayon evam vishvavidhyalayon main hindi ke paathyakram ko manyata mili
 He knew that the cooperation of non-hindi speakers is necessary for the spread of Hindi throughout India
 shaayad unki isi soch kaa parinaam tha sammelan main gandhi kaa liya janaa
 Later, there was a difference of opinion between Tandonji and Mahatma Gandhi on the question of 'hindustani'
 tandon ji aparaajey yoddha the
 He could take on anyone for truth and justice
 apane siddhanton par chattan kii tarah adig evam sthir rahete the
 As a result Gandhiji had to separate himself from the conference, Tandon ji continued on his path
 san 1949 main jab samvidhan sabha main rajbhasha sambandhi prashn uthaaya gaya to us samay ek vicitra sthiti thi
 Mahatma Gandhi was a supporter of Hindustani, Pandit Nehru and Dr
 Rajendra Prasad and many other leaders were also in favor of Hindustani, but Tandon ji did not lose, not bow down
 parinamat: vijay bhi unki hui
 After the heated debate on 11, 12, 13, 14 December 1949, the Congress voted on Hindi and Hindustani, Hindi got 62 and Hindustani got 32 votes
 antat: hindi rashtrabhasha or devanagari rajalipi ghoshit hui
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 It is also necessary to mention here that Tandon ji tried his best to give recognition to the civilian marks in the constitution, for this he left the institution which he served for almost five decades
 samvidhan-sabha main rajarshi ne angreji ankon kaa virodh kiya par nehru ji kii hidaayat ke kaaran congressi sadsy shri kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi, shri gopal swami ingar ke formule ke paksh main rahe
 Tandon ji's protest motion fell and the civil issue could not be recognized in the constitution
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 rajarshi ke vyaktitv evam krititv kaa akalan karte samay praaia: unke sahityakar rup ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 He was the creator of a high court
 unki rachanaaon main tatkaaleen itihaas kii khoj kii ja sakati he
 As a litterateur, Tandon appears as an essayist, poet and journalist
 unke niabandh hindi bhashaa or sahitya, dharm or samskruti tathaa anya vividh kshetron se sambandhit hai
 Among the poetic compositions, 'bandar Sabha Epic', 'cottage Flower' and 'freedom' have their historical significance
 in kavitaaon main rashtriyata or deshbhakti kii pramukhataa he
 In his works, to find closely the poetics will have to be pierced, but the expression with which the Tandan ji has expressed the age-old reality is certainly praiseworthy - 'bandar sabha mahakavy` main aalha style main angrejon kii nitiyon kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Enjoy one or two of the jokes he has taken against the British - patrakarita ke kshetra main tandon ji angreji ke bhi udbhat vidwaan the
 Shri Tribhuvan Narayan Singh ji has mentioned that when he was elected the President of the Congress in 1950, he wrote his address in Hindi and i did the English translation
 shri sampoornanand ji ne bhi us angreji anuwaad ko dekha, lekin jab tandon ji ne us anuwaad ko padhaa, to usamen kai pannon ko phir se likhaa
 Then i realized that while he was a learned scholar of Hindi, he also had great authority over English literature
 purushottams tandon ke bahu aiami or pratibhashali vyaktitv ko dekhakar unhen 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 On the evening of 15 April 1948, Mahanta Devaraha Baba honored you with the title of 'rajarshi' with a Vedic chant on the Saryu coast
 kuch logon ne ise anuchit tehraaya, par jyotirmath ke shri shankaracharya maharaj ne ise shastrasammat mana or kaashi kii pandit sabha ne 1948 ke akhil bhartiya saanskrithik sammelan ke oopaadhi vitaran samaaroh main isaki pushti kii
 Since then, this title has been embellished with its name inextricably linked
 bhartiya samskruti ke param himachati or pakshdhar hone par bhi rajarshi roodhiyon or andhvishwaason ke kattar virdohi the
 He also expressed his blunt thoughts on the evils and malpractices prevalent in Indian society
 unamem ek adbhut aatmbal tha, jisase ve kathin se kathin kaary ko aasaani se sampann kar lete the
 In relation to child marriage and widow marriage, he believed that "the promotion of widow marriage is contrary to our civilizational, our literature and the pativrat religion, the mainstay of our society organization"
 He clarified that the demand for widow-marriage is increasing because In our society, the system against child marriage has run and the question of child widows is the main problem of Indian society
 at: "bal-vivaah kii pratha ko rokna hi vidhwaa vivaah karne kii apeksha adhik mahatv kaa kartavya siddh hota he
 " unke vyaktitv ke is pahalu ke ek-do udhaaharan paryaapt honge- praaia: log samajhate hai ki pakaa hua bhojan supachya hota he, par rajarshi ne ise ek roodhi mana or unhone varshon tak aag se pake hue bhojan ko nahin grahan kiya
 Once left the Chinese food
 ek ore unhen gaay ke doodh se parhez tha to duusari ore chamade ke juute se
 Thus he was the holder of a wonderful personality
 bharatvarsh main swatantraaa ke purv se hi sampradayikta kii samasya apane vikat rup main vidyaman rahi
 Some leaders have also accused Tandonji of being communal
 yah sach he ki rajarshi apni samskruti ke param bhakt or poshak the
 He also did not feel hesitant to say that keeping two cultures alive in India would be a betrayal of the country, but this did not mean that Tandonji was communal, anti-muslim
 is sambandh main kulkusum ke vichaar kitne sarthak hai- Tandonji himself has also written- vastav main tandon ji kaa vyaktitv maanavvaadi tha
 The child who supported him at his home was a Muslim, but how ironic that people say that Tandonji was communal
 rajarshi tandon ji ke vyaktitv ke anya anek pahalu or bhi hai; jaise ve garibon, peediton ke sahaayak the, sahi arthon main deenabandhu the, karunaa kii murti the or babu ji kitne naitik aacharan ke vyakti the iskaa anumaan is udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he- "the year 1950 was Mahakumbh
 bahua ne ganga snaan ke liye gaadi se jane kii baat kahi
 Babu Ji replied that the car belonged to the 'speaker'
 tum mere saath to ja sakati ho, kintu akele nahin
 " uparyukt sankshipt vivechan ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki rajarshi kaa vyaktitv bahuaiami or rajarshi ke anuroop tha
 He was rich in versatility
 ve hindi ke anany premi hi nahin, balki hindi ke paryaay the
 He is mentioned in the history of Hindi literature as an able poet and essay writer
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke amar sannaniyon main unki gananaa agrim pankti ke senaniyon main kii jaati he or unka naam bhartiya swantantraa sangram ke itihaas main swarna aksharon se ankit he
 He was the holder of the steel personality, despite being an affectionate, generous and compassionate idol
 himalay kii tarah achal or atal
 My heartfelt condolences to this supreme Hindi Savi, national devotee and worshiper of Indian culture

 yah darshanik nitishastra kii shakha hai, jo un prashnon ko jaanchati hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik taur par kisi ko kaise kaary karnaa chahiyein
 It is derived from the criterion, which relates to, or is based on, an ideal standard or model, which is believed to be the normal or proper way of doing something
 mandandak nitishastra adhinitishastra se alag hai, kyonki vah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa pareekshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa ke arth kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Most traditional moral principles are based on principles that determine whether an action is right or wrong
 is style main, clasiki siddhanton main upyogetavaad, kantiwad or kuch sanvidiyavaad ke rup shaamil hai
 These principles mainly provide widespread use of moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 is baat ko lekar asahmati hai ki nishchit rup se vah kya hai jo kisi kaary, niyam yaa ayaan ko uskaa nitishastreey bal pradaan karata hai
 Broadly speaking, there are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each
 The focus of virtue ethics is on the character of the workman, while both, theistic ethics and consequentialism focus on the status of work, rule or action
