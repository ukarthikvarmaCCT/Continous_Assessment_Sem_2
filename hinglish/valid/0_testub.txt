 Karthikeya or Murugan is a popular Hindu god and most of his devotees are Tamil Hindus
 inaki puja mukhyat: bharat ke dakshini rajyon or visheshkar tamil nadu main kii jaati he iske atirikt vishwa main jahaan kahin bhi tamil nivasee / pravasi rahete hai jaise ki srilanka, malaysia, singapore aadi main bhi yah puuje jate hai
 His six most famous temples are located in Tamil Nadu
 tamil inhen tamil kadvul yani ki tamilon ke devtaa kah kar sambodhit karte hai
 He is also the defender of the Tamil Nadu state of India
 kartikeya ji bhagwaan shiv or bhagwati parvati ke putr hai tathaa sadaiv balak rup hi rahete hai
 But this form of his child is also a mystery
 bhagwaan kartikeya chha: baalkon ke rup main janme the tathaa inaki dekhbhaal kritika ne kii thi, isiilie unhen kartikeya dhatri bhi kehete hai
 According to Skanda Purana, due to the boon given by Lord Shiva, the unrighteous demon Tarakasura had become extremely powerful
 vardaan ke anusaar keval shivputra hi uskaa vadh kar saktaa tha
 And that's why he was making a noise in all three worlds
 isiilie saare devtaa bhagwaan vishnu ke paas ja pahunche
 Lord Vishnu suggested him to go to Kailash and beg Lord Shiva to have a son
 vishnu kii baat sunakar samast devgan jab kailash pahunche tab unhen pataa chalaa ki shivaji or mata parvati to vivaah ke pashchaat se hi deodara van main ekantavaas ke liye ja chuke hai
 When the deified and frustrated gods reached Devadaru forest, they came to know that Shiva and Mata Parvati are residing in a cave in the forest
 devataaon ne shivaji se madad kii guhaar lagaai kintu koi laabh nahin hua, bholebhandari to kampash main bandhakar apni ardhangini ke saath sambhog karne main rat the
 In order to wake them up, Agni Dev decided to create obstacles in their Kamkrida
 agnidev jab gupha ke dwaar tak pahunche tab unhone dekha kii shiv shakti kamvasana main leen hokar sahavaas main tallin the, kintu agnidev ke aane kii aahat sunakar ve donon saavdhaan ho gaye
 At the time of sexual intercourse, Goddess Parvati covered her beautiful face with lotus flower after being found near the male
 devi kaa vah rup lajja gauri ke naam se prasidd ho gaya
 In Kamkrida, when Shiva ji saw Agnidev, he too had to renounce the sport and came in front of Agnidev
 lekin itane main kamaatur shivaji kaa anjaane main hi veerypat ho gaya
 Agnidev took that infamous semen in the form of a pigeon and started taking it to save it from Tarakasura
 kintu us veery kaa taap itnaa adhik tha kii agnidev se bhi sahan nahin hua
 For this reason, he handed over that infallible semen to Gangadevi
 jab devi ganga us divya ansh ko lekar jane lagi tab uski shakti se ganga kaa pani ubalane laga
 Frightened Gangadevi brought that divine part into the Sharavan forest and established it, but the divine portion flowing into the Ganges water was divided into six parts
 bhagwaan shiv ke sharir se utpann veery ke un divya anshon se chah sundar va sukomal shishuon kaa janm hua
 When the sight of the six Kritika girls who were traveling in that forest fell on those children, then they felt a sense of motherhood towards those children
 or wo sab un baalkon ko lekar unako apana stanpan karaane lagi
 After that they all went to Kritikalok with those hairs and started nurturing them
 jab in sabake bare main naarad ji ne shiv parvati ko bataaya tab ve donon apane putr se milane ke liye vyakul ho uthe, va kritikalok chal pade
 When Mother Parvati saw her six sons, she became emotional with motherhood, and she embraced the children so strongly that those six babies became the same children, who had six heads
 tatpashchaat shiv parvati ne kritikaon ko sari kahani sunai or apane putr ko lekar kailash waapas aa gaye
 Due to the upbringing by the girls, that child was named Karthikeya
 kartikeya ne bada hokar rakshas tarakasur kaa sanhaar kiya
 According to the Sanskrit text Amarakosh, Karthikeya has the following names: pita - bhagwaan shivamata - bhagwati parvatibhai - ganesh bahan - ashokasundari patni - devsena vaahan - mor baalpan main inaki dekhbhaal kritika ne kii thi

 By this measure, it allows the Government of India to spend in the future financial year as well until the budget is passed
 It is part of the budget, but if the Council of Ministers wants it to be passed, then it becomes an interim budget as in 2004 the NDA

 Kamroko Proposal --- Opposition brings this proposal in the Lok Sabha, it is a unique proposal in which all the proceedings of the House are stopped and any one issue of immediate public importance is raised and the government passing the resolution leaves the same effect as the motion of condemnation

 Here the broad definition of the word environment includes natural environment, social environment, built environment, educational environment and information environment
 vigat varshon main paryaavaran ke vibhinn pakshon ko lekar vyapak shodh kaary hue hai or yah vishay kramshah ek samruddhi adhyayan kshetra banataa ja rahaa he is vishay main adhyayan main anek vishyon kaa yogadan rahaa he
 Under its study area, a detailed analysis of the type of environment, their attitude towards man, influence of culture, structure and design of environment etc
 is being done
 ‘‘paryaavaran’’ ke saath sarokaar manovaigyanik adhyayanon kii ek vivishta he anyathaa manovaigyanik parivarty keval aantarik maansik prakramon ko hi sambodhit karte rahenge or is tarah sadaiv paroksh yaa aadrishy hi bane rahenge
 In order to remove the mystery of the internal processes and to establish meaningful dialogue with the real world, it becomes necessary to include the environment in its study, either as a reference or as a manifestation
 aarambh main paryaavaran manovigyaan ko zyaadaatar bhautik paryaavaran par kendrit adhyayan ke rup main liya gaya or baad main uske saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik pakshon ko bhi joda gaya
 At present, three major theoretical approaches are present in environmental psychology
 anukulan kaa upaagam paryaavaran ko uski bhautik visheshtaon ke rup main grahan karata he or vyakti ko ek jaivik va manovaigyanik praani maanata he
 Its purpose is to avoid the existing hazards in the environment
 avasar-sanrachana kaa upaagam panryaavaran ke udeshy or desh kaal se judi hui visheshtaayen, usamen praapt avasar tathaa suvidhaon par bal detaa he
 Environmental problems are believed to be caused by social structure and the environment itself is a socio-culturally defined system
 antarvinimay kaa upaagam vyakti ko parivesh main sthapit karke vishleshit karata he tathaa yah maanata he ki vyakti or paryaavaran ek-duusare ko nirantar prabhavit karte rahete hai
 It is worth remembering that certain types of values and affinities are also associated with these approaches and the selection of research problems and methods depends on them
 aaj kii samakaleen paryaavarniya samasyaayen ek sthaneey tathaa vaishvik donon hi staron par upasthit hai
 Environmental Psychology is committed to solving environmental problems and enhancing quality of life in its pursuit of studies
 iske samuchit vikaas ke liye vaastavik jivan kii paristhitiyon ke bare main nishkarsh nikaalnaa aparyaapt hi nahin asangat bhi he
 The relationship of environment and behavior is often not directly affected by other changes
 yah manovaigyanikon kii ruchi kaa vishay rahaa he
 a large part of modern eco-psychology is associated with the study of the physical features of the environment that disrupt normal human behavior
 bheed, shor, ucch tapakram, jal tathaa vaayu pradooshan aadi kaa manushya ke swabhaav tathaa abhiyojnatmak vyavhaaron par prabhaav adhyayan kiya gaya he
 In the Indian environment, many questions are present keeping in mind the pressure of population and the problem of energy
 bhartiya manovaigyanikon ne bheed kii anubhuti or uske manovaigyanik parinaamon kaa vishesh rup main adhyayan kiya he
 Due to migration from the village to the city, there is increasing congestion in the cities and as a result, not only the physical environment but also the health, social functioning and efficiency of humans are being negatively affected
 bheed jansankhya ke ghanatv se judi he parantu bheed kii anubhuti ke rup main uskaa ek manovaigyanik pahalu bhi he
 Without taking this into consideration, the effects of the crowd cannot be properly analyzed
 prayogshaala or vaastavik jivan main hue anek adhyayan yah dikhaate hai ki bheed kii anubhuti kaary nishpaadan, saamaajik antahkriya, maansik or shaareerik swasthya aadi par rinatmak prabhaav daalati he
 The nature of human needs and the tendency of rivalry-tolerance limit the influence of crowds
 smaraneey he ki jansankhya ke ghanatv se nishchit sthaan main rahane vaale vyaktiyon kii sankhya kaa bodh hota he or bheed sthaan ke abhaav kii anubhuti kii dasha he
 The feeling of congestion is found differently in the primary and secondary environment outside the home
 bheed ke adhyayan prayogshaala or vaastavik jivan donon tarah kii dashaon main hue hai
 The possibility of generalization in studies conducted in the laboratory remains relatively limited
 saath hi bheed kii anubhuti bhi vibhinn sthanon par ek jaisi nahin hoti
 From the results of the studies, it is clear that cognition is not only situation specific but also in avoidable conditions, the congestion is more than that of unavoidable conditions
 bheed or shor ke kaaran jatil kaaryon kaa nishpaadan ghat jaataa he parantu jab vyakti in pratibalon se anukulit rahata he to bheed kaa rinatmak prabhaav ghat jaataa he
 The manifestation of the environment inside the home has been found to be different in urban and rural areas
 bheed par hue adhyayanon ke parinaamon kaa samanyikaran vastutah ek chunauti he kyonki vaastavik jivan kii paristhitiyaan bhinn hoti hai
 The same person goes through crowded situations with different types of amounts and different amounts of uncertainty in his daily routine
 sambhavtah in paristhitiyon ke anubhav ke aadhaar par vyakti ek anukool str viksit karata he or usee ke aadhaar par pratikriya karata he
 Why does the crowd have negative consequences on human behavior? Several theories have been proposed to understand this
 inamen vyavhaar seemaa, niyantran tathaa uddolan ke siddhanth pramukh hai
 Different intermediate variables are envisaged to explain the effects of congestion in them, they have been partially confirmed by studies
 bheed or swasthya ke bich sambandh uplabdh saamaajik samarthan kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 The effects of congestion and temperature also clarify the intermediate role of cognitive factors
 gharon main jansankhya ke ghanatv kaa swasthya, bacchon ke saath vyavhaar, sanvedic samarthan aadi par rinatmak prabhaav paaya gaya he parantu saamaajik aarthik tathaa janaankik karkon ko niyantrit karne par yah prabhaav ghat jaataa he
 It is worth remembering that no variable can be a permanent intermediate variable because every interaction is dynamic
 paryaavaran or uski samasyaon par sarthak vichaar saanskrithik karkon ke pariprekshya main hi sambhanv he
 Especially high population growth, limited resources, poverty, rural and agrarian background of the society, development plans for social change and various cultural traditions are considered for us
 antarvaiyaktik sambandhon, parivaar or samudaay ko pradhanta dene vaale bhartiya samaaj main, jahaan vyakti nahin balki parivaar samaaj kii mul ikai he, paryaavarniya pratibalon kaa prabhaav pashchimi deshon jaisaa nahin hoga
 The Indian situation is also different in this sense, the stresses coming here are of different types
 ve ek-duusare se jude hote hai tathaa inke upar niyantran aasaani se nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Modern Indian studies have been largely influenced by Western ideology and less sensitive to Indian social reality
 vastutah bheed kii anubhuti bhartiya parivesh main jahaan logon kaa jivan vibhinn sanskaron, reeti-rivaajon, rasmon, naate-rishte kii bhagidaari se otprot rahe hai bhinn hoti he
 Despite the increase in the number of Ekanki families, the joint family remains in some form or the other
 aisi sthiti main ek alag drushtikon apekshit he
 On many occasions, the presence of a crowd is considered desirable and one feels proud of it
 saath hi, sambandhon ko sthapit karnaa or unka nirvaah ek saamaajik daayitv mana gaya he
 In such a situation, the presence or absence of the crowd depends not only on the presence or absence of people, but also on the presence of people in the crowd
 jab parichit yaa priyajan hote hai to unke bich ke vyakti ko swayan apane ‘swa’ ke vistaar kii anubhuti hoti he
 a crowd is often perceived as a sense of feeling or a feeling of disenfranchisement in the presence of people in a confined space
 is par punarvichaar kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki bheed kii anubhuti ke liye yah aparyaapt he
 Who are the people in the crowd and what is the purpose of their gathering? Without this attention, the representation of the crowd would be incomplete

 He also defined an Archimedes spiral, which is based on his name, gave formulas for the volume of the rotating surface and also gave a simple system for expressing very large numbers
 archimedes seracus kii gheraabandi ke dauraan maare gaye jab ek roman sainik ne unki hatya kar di, haalanki yah aadesh diya gaya tha ki unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunchnaa chahie
 Describing the tomb of Cicero Archimedes, which is like a dome inside a cylinder, Archimedes proved that the volume of the sphere and its surface area is two-thirds of the cylinder and it is one of his greatest Is considered a mathematical achievement

pus
 duusare punik yuddh ke dauraan hui jab roman senaaon ne general marcus cloudius marcelas ke netritv main do saal kii gheraabandi ke baad seracus shahar par kabza kar liya
 According to the popular description given by Plutarch, Archimedes was considering a mathematical figure when the city was captured
 ek roman sainik ne unhen aakar general marcelas se milane kaa aadesh diya, lekin unhone yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki unhen apni samasya par kaam puraa karnaa he
 This angered the soldier and killed Archimedes with his sword
 plutark archimedes kii mrityu kaa bhi ek vivaran dete hai lesser-known jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki sambhavatya unhen tab maar diya gaya jab ve ek roman sainik ko samarpan karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 According to this story, Archimedes was carrying a mathematical device and was killed because the soldier thought it was valuable
 kaha jaataa he ki archimedes kii mrityu se general marcelas bahut krodhit hue, kyonki ve unhen ek amuly vaigyanik sampati maanate the or unhone aadesh die the ki archimedes ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya janaa chahie
 Archimedes' last words were believed to be, "do not disturb my circles", the accounts here refer to the circles of the mathematical picture that Archimedes was studying when the Roman soldier harassed him

 Archimedes' mausoleum is depicted with his favorite mathematical proof, a sphere of equal height and diameter and a cylinder
 archimedes ne pramanit ki gole kaa aaytan or sataha kaa kshetrafal belan kaa do tihaai hota he
 75 BC In, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as treasurer in Sicily
 unhone archimedes ke makbare ke bare main kahaniyaan suni thim, lekin sthaneey logon main se koi bhi isaki sthiti bataane main sakasham nahin tha
 He eventually discovered this mausoleum near the Agrigentine Gate in Syracuse, it was in a very neglected condition and there were many shrubs growing on it
 siciro ne makbare ko saafe kiya or iske upar hui nakkashi ko dekh paae or us par shilaalekh ke rup main upasthit kuch chhandon ko padhaa
 Standard versions of Archimedes's life were written by historians of ancient Rome long after his death
 polibyas ke dwaara diya gaya seracus kii gheraabandi kaa vivaran unki universal history main archimedes kii mrityu ke lagbhag 70 varsh ke baad likhaa gaya or ise baad main plutark or livi ke dwaara ek strot ke rup main prayukt kiya gaya
 It sheds little light on Archimedes as an individual and focuses on the war machines he is believed to have built to protect the city
 archimedes ke bare main sabase vyapak rup se gyaat tathy yah bataata he ki kis prakaar se unhone ek aniyamit akruti ke ek vastu ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye vidhi kii khoj kii
 According to Vitruvius, a new crown of a laurel wreath was made for King Hero II and Archimedes was asked to find out whether the crown was made of pure gold or that the unscrupulous goldsmith had added silver to it
 archimedes ko mukut ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina is samasya kaa samaadhaan karnaa tha, isliye vah iske ghanatv kii gananaa karne ke liye ise pighla kar ek niyamit aakaar kii vastu main nahin badal saktaa tha
 While taking a bath, he noticed that when he went inside the tub, the water level in the tub rose and he realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown
 vyavhaarik prayojanon ke liye pani ko sampidit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, isliye duba hua mukut apane aaytan kii baraabar maatra ke pani ko pratisthapit karegaa
 The density of the crown can be obtained by dividing the weight of the crown by the volume of water replaced
 yadi isamen saste or kam ghanatv vaale dhaatu milaaye gaye hai to iskaa ghanatv sone se kam hoga
 What was then, Archimedes became so excited by his discovery that he forgot to wear clothes and ran in the streets in a naked state shouting "eureka!" sone ke mukut kii kahani archimedes ke gyaat kaaryon main prakat nahin hoti he
 Furthermore, due to the excessive amount of accuracy required in the measurement of water displacement, the feasibility of the method described by it has been questioned
 sambhavat: archimedes ne ek aisa hal diya jo jalsthitiki main archimedes ke siddhant naamak siddhant par lagu hota he, jise ve apane ek granth on floating bodis main varnit karte hai
 According to this theory, an object immersed in a liquid exerts a buoyancy force that is equal to the weight of the liquid it removes
 is siddhant kaa prayog karte hue, sone ke mukut ke ghanatv kii tulana thos sone se karnaa sambhav ho gaya hoga, iske liye pehle mukut ko sone ke ek namoonay ke saath ek paimaane par santulit kiya gaya hoga, phir tantra ko pani main dubaaya gaya hoga
 If the crown was less dense than gold, it would have replaced more water due to its greater volume and thus the buoyancy force applied to it would have been greater than the sample
 utplavakta main yah antar paimaane par dikhaayi diya hoga
 Galileo considered that "archimedes may have used this method, since, to be very precise, it is based on the performance given by Archimedes himself
" " a large part of the work by Archimedes in the field of engineering came from meeting the needs of his own city of Syracuse
 unani lekhak naukratis ke athenus ne varnit kiya ki kaise raja hiron II ne archimedes ko ek vishaal jahaaj, syracusia dizin karne ke liye kaha, jise vilasitapurna yatra karne ke liye, saamaan kii supplai karne ke liye or nausena ke yudhpot ke rup main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Siracusia is believed to have been the largest ship in ancient times
 athenus ke anusaar, yah 600 logon ko le jane main sakasham tha, saath hi isaki suvidhaon main ek bageeche kii sajaavat, ek vyaayaamashaala or devi effordit ko samarpit ek mandir bhi tha
 Since a ship of this size would leak a large amount of water through the hull, Archimedes' screw was made to remove this water
 archimiddiz kii mashin ek ek upkaran thi, jisamen ek belan ke bheetar ghurnan karte hue scru ke aakaar ke blade the
 It was rotated by hand and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water to an irrigation canal
 archimedes ke scru kaa upyog aaj bhi drav or kaneey thos jaise koyala or anaaj ko pump karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Archimedes' screw described by Vitruvius in Roman times was probably an improvement on the screw pump that was used to irrigate the hanging gardens of the Babylonians
 archimedes kaa panja ek hathiyaar he, mana jaataa he ki unhone seracus shahar kii raksha ke liye ise dizin kiya tha
 Also known as "the Ship Shaker", this claw had a crane-like arm from which a large metal hook hung
 jab is panje ko ek akraman karte hue jahaaj par daalaa jaataa tha, bhujaa upar kii ore uthati thi or jahaaj ko ko uthaakar pani se baahar nikaalati thi or sambhawatah ise duba detii thi
 Modern tests have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of this claw, and in 2005 a television documentary titled Super Weapons of the Ancient World created a version of this claw and concluded that it was a working device

 Centuries later Anthemias of Trelage referred to the burning glass as Archimedes' weapon
 yah upkaran, kabhi kabhi "archimedes ki ushma kiran" kehalaata he, iskaa upyog lakshya jahaaj par surya ke prakaash ko focus karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha, jisase ve aag lakad lete the
 This alleged weapon has been the subject of debate since the Renaissance

 It has been suggested that a large group of layers of heavily polished bronze or copper serve as mirrors, presumably which were used to focus sunlight onto the ship
 isamen paravalay paravarti ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, jaise saura bhatti main kiya jaataa he
 a trial of Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Lonis Sakkas
 yah prayog athens ke baahar skaramjes nausena base par kiya gaya
 At this time 70 mirrors were used, each was polished with a copper and its size was about 5x3 feet
 The mirrors were placed in the direction of a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship about 160 feet away
 jab darpanon ko thik prakaar se focus kiya gaya, jahaaj kuch hi kshanon main aag kii lapaton main jalane laga
 The plywood was polished with tar paint on the ship, which further contributed to the combustion

 It was also pointed out that because Syracuse is facing the sun to the east, the Roman fleet would have to attack in the morning to collect favorable light from the mirrors
 mithbsters ne yah bhi kaha ki paaramparik hathiyaar, jaise jwalanth tir yaa ek gulel se bheje gaye tir, kam duuri se jahaaj ko jalane kaa adhik aasaan tarika he
 While Archimedes did not discover the lever, he first gave a rigorous description of the theory involved

" plutark ne is baat kaa varnan kiya ki kaise archimedes ne block-or-tekal ghirani pranali ko dizin kiya, jisase aisi vastuon ko uthaane main navikon ne liverej kaa siddant istemaal kiya, jo itani baari thim ki unhen anyathaa hilaanaa bhi bahut mushkil hota tha
 Archimedes has also been credited with improving the ability and accuracy of the catapult and invented the odometer during the First Punic War
 odometer ko ek gear se yukt ek gaadi kii pranali ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo har ek mile chalane ke baad ek gend ko ek paatr main daalati he
 Cicero briefly mentions Archimedes in his Dialogue de Rey Publica, in 129 BC after the siege of Syracuse
 a fictional conversation depicted in, c
 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have brought back two systems in Rome, which were used to aid astronomy, the Sun, Moon and the Five Shows the motion of the planets
 siciro usee tarah kii pranali kaa ullekh karte hai jaisi pranali militus ke thels or needs ke yudoxs ke dwaara dizin kii gayi
 According to this dialogue, Marcellus kept one device as his personal loot from Syracuse and donated all the others to the Temple of Virtue in Rome
 siciro ke anusaar marcelas kii pranali ko geiyas salpikas gelis ke dwaara lukias furias philis ko darshaya gaya, jisane ise is prakaar se varnit kiya: It is a description of a planetarium or Orei)
 alegsendriya ke pappas ne kaha ki archimedes ne in nirdisht pranaaliyon ke nirmaan par ek pandulipi likhi he On sphere-making
 Modern studies in this area focus on the antikythera system, another device from ancient times that was probably designed for a similar purpose
 is prakaar kii nirmaanatmak pranali ke liye avakal gearing ke parishkrut gyaan kii aavashyaktaa rahi hogi
 It was once thought to be outside the range of technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera system in 1902 ensured that such devices were known to the ancient Greeks
 haalanki archimedes ko aksar yantric upkarnon kaa diziner kaha jaataa he, unhone ganit ke kshetra main bhi yogadan diya

 yah takanic purnataa kii vidhi kehalaati he or unhone iskaa prayog pai ) ke sannikat maan kaa pataa lagane main kiya
 For this he painted a large polygon outside a vow and a small polygon inside the vow
 jaise jaise bahubhuj kii bhujaaon kii sankhya badhati he, vrath kaa sanniktan adhik sateek ho jaataa he
 When each polygon had 96 sides, they calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π was between 31⁄7 and 310⁄71, corresponding to its true value of about 3
1416
 unhone yah bhi pramanit kiya ki vraton kaa kshetrafal π or vrath kii trigya ke varg ke gunanfal ke baraabar tha
 In measuring a vow, Archimedes states the square root value of 3 to be greater than 265⁄153 and less than 1351⁄780

 In The Sand Reconnor, Archimedes gave a set of numbers to calculate the number of soil particles present in this universe
 aisa karne main, unhone is dharna ko chunauti di ki mitti ke kanon kii sankhya itani badi he ki isaki gananaa nahin kii ja sakati he
 He wrote: "some people, King Gello, think that the number of soils is infinite in the infinite; and i believe that the soil is not only in Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but in every region where there is housing or no housing
 is samasya kaa hal karne ke liye, archimedes ne asankhya ke aadhaar par gananaa kii ek pranali di

 The oldest document in which Archimedes works is Archimedes Palimpsest
 In 1906, a Danish professor, John Ludwig Heiberg, visited Constantinople and examined the Gotskin parchment of prayer written in the 13th century AD
 unhone paaya ki yah ek palimpcest tha, ek paathya se yukt ek dastavej jise mitaae gaye puraane kaary ke upar likhaa gaya tha
 To make the palimpsest, the ink on it was scraped off and reused, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as parchment was expensive

 naarad puraana ke anusaar daitya raaj hirankshyap ko yah ghamand tha ki usase sarvshereshth duniya main koi nahin, atah logon ko ishwar kii puja karne kii bajaay uski puja kerani chahie

 Hiranyakaship finally placed Prahlada in the pyre in the lap of his sister Holika, who had a magical Chunari, who was blessed with a boon not to be consumed in the fire, so that Prahlada could be consumed
 par honi ko kuch or hi manjuur tha, ishwariya vardaan ke galat prayog ke chalate jaadui chunari ne udakar prahlada ko dhak liya or holikaa jal kar raakh ho gayi or prahlada ek baar phir ishwariya krupa se sakushal batch niklaa
 Pleased by the death of the evil Holika, the townspeople expressed happiness by blowing her ashes

 Although polygamy was legalized in Kazakhstan in the last century, polygamy is not currently recognized as legal, although the debate over legalizing it continues
 aisi hi bahasein pados ke anya deshon jaise kirgistan, uzbekistan, turkmenistan or rus main bhi hui hai
 With the passage of a proposed law, polygamy will be legal for all men in the country, who must meet certain conditions, such as the husband's approval from his first wife, and the man must show that he is financially in another family
 Can afford kanoonanusaar 4 patniyaan tak rakhane ki anumati hogi
 Proponents of legalizing polygamy argue that "it will help improve the demographic status of the country"
 ye log islamic ritiyon ko uddhrut karte hai, jiske anusaar ek musalmaan purush ko chaar patniyaan tak rakhane ki anumati he
 Their argument is also that the new ordinance will give more rights to wives and children of polygamy
 7 may 2008 ko astana main ek golmez ke dauraan, bahyat sizadikova ne kaha ki vah bahupatitv ko bhi vaid karne k suzav dengi, yadi sansad dwaara bahupatnitv ko vaid kar diya jaat he to, cunki, "hamaare desh me samvidhan dwaara purushon or streeyon ko baraabar adhikaar die gaye hai"
 He said that instead of legalizing polygamy, there is a need for a law to give more rights to children born without marriage
 almati ki ek mahila dwaara bhi kuch aise hi vichaar vyakt kiye gayi ki, "bahut si mahilaayein duusari yaa teesri patniyaan ban gai hai, lekin naa to unhen or naa hi unke bacchon ko koi adhikaar praapt hai", "main nae paarit hone vaale kanoon main bahuvivaah shabd nahin dekhnaa chaahati, par main ye chaahati hoon ki purushon par daayitv hon or unhen hi unke saare sambandhon or aadhikarik vivaah se anyatra santan ke liye uttaradaayi mana jaae
 The thirty-second effigy queen Rupavati was surprised to see King Bhoja not showing any interest in sitting on the throne
 usne jaananaa chaha ki raja bhoj main aaj pehle vaali vyagrata kyon nahin he
 Raja Bhoj said that after listening to the stories of the qualities of the deities of King Vikramaditya, he felt that such characteristics are impossible in a man and believe that he has many shortcomings
 at: unhone sochaa he ki singhaasana ko phir vaise hi us sthaan par gadwa denge jahaan se ise nikaala gaya he
 King Bhoj had to speak so much that all the effigies came to his queen
 unhone harsith hokar raja bhoj ko unke nirnay ke liye dhanyavad diya
 The pupils told them that they were also free from today
 aaj se yah singhaasana bina putliyon kaa ho jayega
 He told King Bhoja to be a partial lord of Vikramaditya's qualities and said that due to this ability, he could see this throne
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki aaj se is singhaasana kii abha kam pad jaaegi or dharti kii sari chizon kii tarah ise bhi purana padakar nasht hone kii prakriya se guzaranaa hoga
 Saying this, those effigies left the king and flew towards the sky
 palak jhapakate hi sari kii sari putaliyaan akaash main villin ho gai
 After the effigies had left, Raja Bhoja summoned the servants and instructed to dig the pit
 jab majdoor bulawaakar gadadha khod daalaa gaya to veda mantron kaa paath karwaakar puri praja kii upasthiti main singhaasana ko gadde main dabava diya
 The soil was then built and a similar mound was built on which the shepherd used to give his decision
 lekin nayaa tila vah chamatkaar nahin dikhaa sakaa jo puraane vaale tile main tha
 Epilogue - Every popular version with a few variations has a narrative and epilogue in the form of epilogue
 usamen singhaasana ke saath pun: dabavane ke baad kya guzara- yah varnit he
 This epilogue may not be found in the official Sanskrit version, but the legend is quite popular
 kai saal biit gaye
 That mound had become so famous that people from far off places used to come to see it
 sabhi ko pataa tha ki is tile ke neeche alokik gunon vaala singhaasana dabaa padaa he
 One day a gang of thieves decided to take out that throne and sell it to pieces
 unhone tile se milon pehle ek gaddha khoda or kai maheenon kii mehnat ke baad surang khodakar us singhaasana tak pahunche
 Bringing the throne out of the tunnel to a secluded place, he tried to break it with the hammer
 chot padate hi aisi bhayanak chingaari nikalati thi ki todane vaale ko jalaane lagati thi
 There were so many precious gems and rubies in the throne that the thieves were not giving up the temptation to separate them from the throne
 singhaasana puri tarah sone se nirmit tha, isliye choron ko lagata tha ki sara sona bech dene par bhi kai hazaar swarna mudraayen mil jaaegin or unke paas itnaa adhik dhan jamaa ho jayega ki unke parivaar main kai purakhon tak kisi ko kuch karne kii zaroorat nahin padegi
 They kept trying all day but their blows did not damage the throne even a little
 ulte unke haath chingaarion se jhulas gaye or chingaarion ko baar-baar dekhne se unki ankhen dukhane lageen
 He sat down tiredly and pondered the conclusion that the throne is haunted
 bhutaha hone ke kaaran hi raja bhoj ne ise apane upyog ke liye nahin rakhaa
 He must have had some trouble keeping it in the palace, only then did he suppress such a valuable throne in the ground again
 ve iskaa moh raja bhoj kii tarah hi tyaagane kii soch rahe the
 Then his chief said that the throne cannot be broken, but it can be lifted in this state and taken to another place
 choron ne us singhaasana ko acchhee tarah kapade main lapet diya or us sthaan se bahut dur kisi anya rajya main use usee rup main le jane kaa faisla kar liya
 He reached a kingdom in the south after a few months' journey to the throne
 vahaan kisi ko us singhaasana ke bare main kuch pataa nahin tha
 They disguised themselves as jewelers and prepared to meet the king of that kingdom
 unhone raja ko vah ratna jadit swarna singhaasana dikhaate hue kaha ki ve bahut dur ke rahane vaale hai tathaa unhone apana sara dhan lagaakar yah singhaasana taiyaar karavaaya he
 The king checked the purity of that throne with the great goldsmiths and jewelers of his kingdom
 sabane us singhaasana kii sundarata or shuddhta kii tarif karte hue raja ko vah singhaasana kharid lene kii salaah di
 The king gave the thieves his favored price and took the throne for his seat
 jab vah singhaasana darbar main lagaaya gaya to sara darbar alokik roshni se jagamagane laga
 There was a very beautiful glow emanating from diamonds and diamonds embedded in it
 raja kaa man bhi aise singhaasana ko dekhakar atyadhik prasann hua
 Seeing the auspicious moment, the king worshiped the throne with learned pundits and began to sit on that throne regularly
 singhaasana kii charchaa dur-dur tak failane lagi
 Kings from far and wide started coming to see that throne
 sabhi aane vaale us raja ke bhagya ko dhanya kehete, kyonki use aisa adbhut singhaasana par baithne kaa avasar mila tha
 Gradually this fame also reached the kingdom of King Bhoja
 singhaasana kaa varnan sunakar unako laga ki kahin vikramaditya kaa singhaasana na ho
 He immediately called his staff and discussed and called the workers and dug up the mound again
 khudwane par unki shankaa satya nikali or surang dekhakar unhen pataa chal gaya ki choron ne vah singhaasana chura liya
 He now wondered how he ascended the throne of King Vikramaditya
 kya vah raja sachmuch vikramaditya ke samakaksh gunon vaala he? He decided to go to that state with some employees and see everything
 kaaphi dinon kii yatra ke baad vahaan pahunche to us raja se milane uske darbar pahunche
 That king welcomed them all and asked the purpose of their arrival
 raja bhoj ne us singhaasana ke bare main raja ko sab kuch bataaya
 That king was very surprised
 usne kaha ki use singhaasana par baithne main kabhi koi pareshaani nahin hui
 When King Bhoja consulted astrologers and pundits, he came to the conclusion that the throne may have lost all its miracles
 unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he ki singhaasana ab sone kaa na ho tathaa ratna or maaniky kaanch ke tukade maatr hon
 When the king heard this, he said that it is impossible
 choron se usne use kharidne se pehle puri jaanch karwaai thi
 But when the jewelers examined him again, he was very surprised
 singhaasana kii chamak feeki pad gai thi tathaa vah ekadam pital kaa ho gaya tha
 There were colored pieces of glass instead of gems and rubies
 singhaasana par baithne vaale raja ko bhi bahut aashcharya hua
 He consulted his astrologers and scholars and asked them to calculate
 unhone kaaphi adhyayan karne ke baad kaha ki yah chamatkaari singhaasana ab mrit ho gaya he
 It was desecrated and its effect kept on going
 unhone kaha- "ab is mrit singhaasana kaa shasrokt vidhi se antim sanskaar kar diya janaa chahie
 It should be flown into the water
 " The king immediately summoned his servants and called the laborers and amidst the chanting, the throne flowed into the river Kaveri
 samay bitta rahaa
 That thone remained contained within the pages of history
 lok kathaon or jan-shrutiyon main uski charchaa hoti rahi
 Many kings deployed one dive from one to the next in order to get the throne of Vikramaditya and the river Kaveri was shattered
 magar aaj tak uski jhalak kisi ko nahin mil pai he
 People believe that even today, if there is a ruler with the same qualities as Vikramaditya, then the throne will come out with all its features and shine

 kintu vaastaviktaa yah he ki twarak main kanon kaa samooh yaa guchha chalata he, na ki ekal kan
 When the particles are in groups, they interact together, which can increase the size of the particle mass and increase the elongation of the clusters or cause scap scattering
 iske atirikt spes charge ke kaaran beam main asthayitv aa saktaa he or uske kaaran beam-hraas bhi ho saktaa he
 In order to include the effect of space charge, the Poisson equation is often solved at some distance during tracking for which particle-in-cell technique is used
 smaraneey he ki kan kii urja jab adhik hoti he tab spes-charge ke kaaran beam ke aakaar or asthayitv par prabhaav kam hota he
 Hence the space-charge effect can be calculated with the help of simple algorithms to model the motion of charged particles with high energy
 kam urja vaale gucchhon kii gati se sambandhit kuch pramukh code nimnlikhit hai- The space charge effect at high energies is characterized by, among other things, the Tausuke scattering and coherent synchrotron radiation effects
 ucch urja vaale kan-chucchon main spes charge prabhaav kii gananaa karne vaale kuch code nimnlikhit hai- The grouping effect is also expressed as impedance
 atah twarak ke liye is pratibaadha kii gananaa karnaa ek mahatvapoorn kaary he
 The major codes for this work are- kan twarak main anekon prakaar ke chumbak prayukt hote hai
 Many softwares are also used to design and understand these magnets, radio frequency cavities etc
 inke liye prayukt kuch kod- Given the variety of modeling tasks, there is not a common data format that has developed
 For describing the layout of an accelerator and the corresponding elements, one uses a so-called "lattice file"
 There have been numerous attempts at unifying the lattice file formats used in different codes
 One unification attempt is the Accelerator Markup Language, and the Universal Accelerator Parser
 Another attempt at a unified approach to accelerator codes is the UAL or Universal Accelerator Library
 The file formats used inmad may be the most common, with translation routines available to convert to an input form needed for a different code
 Associated with the Elegant code is a data format called SDDS, with an associated suite of tools
 If one uses a Matlab-based code, such as Accelerator Toolbox, one has available all the tools within Matlab
 Can accelerators are used for many purposes
 udhaaharan ke liye, kan bhautikee or sincrotron vikiran kaa utpaadan
 When performing a modeling task for any accelerator operation, the results of charged particle beam dynamics simulations must feed into the associated application
 Thus, for a full simulation, one must include the codes in associated applications
 For particle physics, the simulation may be continued in a detector with a code such as Geant4
 For a synchrotron radiation facility, for example, the electron beam produces an x-ray beam that then travels down a beamline before reaching the experiment
 Thus, the electron beam modeling software must interface with the x-ray optics modelling software such as SRW, Shadow, mcxtrace, or Spectra
 Bmad can model both X-rays and charged particle beams
 The x-rays are used in an experiment which may be modeled and analyzed with various software, such as the DAWN science platform
 OCELOT also includes both synchrotron radiation calculation and x-ray propagation models

 jaev vividhita sangrakshan ke liye thos kadam jarurishashank dvivedi Given the importance of biodiversity in maintaining the environment and natural balance, International Biodiversity Day is celebrated on 22 May
 ise 'vishwa jaev-vividhta sangrakshan diwas' bhi kehete hai
 It was started by the United Nations
 hamaare jivan main jaev-vividhta kaa kaaphi mahatv he
 We have to create an environment that is rich in bio-diversity, sustainable and gives us opportunities for economic activities
 Due to lack of biodiversity, the risk of natural calamities such as floods, droughts and hurricanes etc
 increases further, so it is very important for us to conserve biodiversity
 lakhon vishisht jaivik kii kai prajatiyon ke rup main prithvi par jivan upasthit he or hamaara jivan prakruti kaa anupam uphaar he
 Therefore, conservation of trees, plants, animals, soil, air, water, oceans, plateaus, oceans, all of them is important because all these are important for our survival and development
 jaev vividhta shabd kii utpatti Renowned conservation biologist Thomas Eugene Lovejoy introduced the term 'biological diversity' or biological diversity in 1980 by combining the terms 'biological' and 'diversity'
 chunki ye shabd dainik upyog ke lihaaj se thodaa bada mahasoos hota tha, isliye 1985 main dablyoo
ji
rosen ne 'biodivarsity' yaa jaev vividhta shabd kii khoj kii

 Preserving biodiversity is essential for the survival of human life
 jaev vividhta ke sangrakshan ke do upaay hai
 First, inter-habitat conservation, in which the conservation of natural habitats is emphasized
 jaev sangrakshit kshetra, rashtriya udyaan, vanya jeev sangrakshan kshetra iske udhaaharan hai
 The second measure is external residential conservation, in which the method of conservation away from the habitat of the organisms is adopted, such as zoos, botanical gardens, seed banks, gene banks, etc
 box matterjaivvividhta kya he?jaivik vividhta, athwa jaivvividhta ke antargat prithvi par rahane vaale sabhi tarah ke jeevon kii vividhta shaamil he
 Biodiversity expresses itself at three levels: that is, species diversity that relates to the number and types of living microbes; Genetic diversity, which is related to genetic diversity within the number of species and ecological diversity which is related to habitat, diversity of biological communities and ecological processes in the biosphere

 bhartiya janata party ko bhartiya raajnneeti main ek pramukh party banane main unka yogadan sarvopari kaha ja saktaa he
 He has been the national president of the BJP several times
 janvari 2008 main rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan ne loksabhaa chunaavon ko adwani ke netritv main ladane tathaa jeet hone par unhen pradhanmantri banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Among the names of the Bharatiya Janata Party that are credited with raising the entire party and bringing it to the national level, the name of the front row is LK Advani
 laalkrishna adwani kabhi party ke karnadhaar kahe gaye, kabhi louh purush or kabhi party kaa asli cheharaa
 Overall, LK Advani is an important chapter in Aaj Tak's history
 aath november, 1927 ko vartmaan pakistan ke karachi main laalkrishna adwani kaa janm hua tha
 His father was Shri KD Advani and mother Giani Advani
 vibhaajan ke baad bharat aa gaye adwani ne 25 farvari 1965 ko 'kamala adwani' ko apni ardhangini banaaya
 Advani has two children
 laalkrishna adwani kii shuruaati shiksha lahore main hi hui par baad main bharat aakar unhone mumbai ke government lau college se lau main snaatak kiya
 Today he is a big name in Indian politics
 gandhi ke baad wo duusare jananaayak hai jinhone hindu andolan kaa netritv kiya or pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar banavai
 But for some time, it seems to be losing its originality
 jis aakraamakata ke liye wo jane jate the, us chhavi ke thik vipareet aaj wo samjhautavaadi nazar aate hai
 Advani, who heralded a new consciousness among Hindus, is looking for Advani of the nineties
 apni bayaanbazi kii vajah se unki kaaphi fazihat hui
 He also came into the discussion from his book and blog
 aalochana bhi hui
 In the year 1951, Dr
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee founded the Jana Sangh
 tab se lekar san 1957 tak adwani party ke sachiv rahe
 From 1973 to 1977, Advani took over as the president of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh
 varsh 1980 main bhartiya janata party kii sthapana ke baad se 1986 tak laalkrishna adwani party ke mahasachiv rahe
 After this, he also held the responsibility of the post of the President of the party from 1986 to 1991
 isi dauraan varsh 1990 main ram mandir andolan ke dauraan unhone somnath se ayodhya ke liye rathyatra nikaali
 Although Advani was arrested midway, Advani's political stature grew larger after this visit
 1990 kii rathyatra ne laalkrishna adwani kii lokapriyata ko charam par pahunchaa diya tha
 After the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992, those named accused include Advani
 laalkrishna adwani teen baar bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh pad par rah chuke hai
 Advani was a member of Rajya Sabha four times and Lok Sabha member five times
 vartmaan main bhi wo gujarat ke gandhinagar sansadeey kshetra se loksabhaa ke saansad hai
 For the first time from 1977 to 1979, LK Advani took charge as a Cabinet Minister in the Central Government
 adwani is dauraan soochna prasaaran mantri rahe
 The highest office of power that Advani has held in political life till date is that of the Deputy Prime Minister during the NDA regime
 laalkrishna adwani varsh 1999 main endie kii sarkaar banane ke baad atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netrutv main kendriya grahamantri bane or phir isi sarkaar main unhen 29 june 2002 ko uppradhanmantri pad kaa daayitv bhi saunpa gaya
 As a good parliamentarian in the Indian Parliament, Advani was sometimes praised for his role and sometimes rewarded

 Havan or Yajna is a ritual of purification in Indian tradition or Hinduism
 kund main agni ke madhyam se devtaa ke nikat havi pahunchaane kii prakriya ko yajna kehete hai
 Hava, Havya or Havishya are the substances that are sacrificed in the fire
 After igniting the fire in the Havan Kund, the sacrifice of fruits, honey, ghee, wood etc
 are the main in this holy fire
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi aapke aas paas kisi buree aatma ityadi kaa prabhaavahai to havan prakriya isse aapako mukti dilaati he
 Havan is also done for good luck, health and prosperity etc
 havan kunda kaa arth he havan kii agni kaa nivas-sthaan
 In ancient times, the pools were dug square, their length, width were the same
 yah isliye tha ki un dinon bharpoor samidhaayen prayukt hoti thim, ghi or saamagree bhi bahut-bahut homi jaati thi, falswaroop agni kii prachandta bhi adhik rahati thi
 To keep him under control it was necessary to have more space inside the land
 us sthiti main chaukor kund hi upyukt the
 But today, due to excessive inflation in all the ingredients, ghee, materials have to be economical
 aisi dasha main chaukor kundon main thodi hi agni jal paati he or vah upar acchhee tarah dikhaai bhi nahin padati
 Even if they do not come to the top, they look ugly
 atev aaj kii sthiti main kund is prakaar banane chahie ki baahar se chaukor rahen, lambaai, chaudaai gaharaai samaan ho
 But make them slant inside
 lambaai, chaudaai choubeech-choubees angul ho to gaharaai bhi 24 angul to rakhana chaiye par usamen tirachhaapan is tarah dena chaiye ki penda chah-chah angul lambaa chaudaa rah jaay
 These types of tanks remain ignited by problems, but the fire is not extinguished
 thodi saamagree se hi kund upar tak bhar jaataa he or agnidev ke darshan sabhi ko aasaani se hone lagate hai
 If you want to give fifty or a hundred sacrifices, make a pool of measurement from the elbow to the junior, one hand in a thousand ahuti, four hands in a lax ahuti, six hands in ten laksa ahuti and 8 hands or sixteen hands in the category ahuti
 Should be made a pool of bhavishyottar puraana main pachaas aahuti ke liye mushtimaatr kaa bhi rnidesh he
 It is necessary to make the number of kunds more so that it is possible to give prescribed sacrifices to more people in less time, if there is only one kund, then nine people sit at a time
 yadi ek hi kund hota he, to purv disha main vedi par ek kalash kii sthapana hone se shesh teen dishaao main hi yaajik baithte hai
 Three people can sit in each direction at once
 yadi kundon kii sankhya 5 hai to pramukh kund ko chhodkar shesh 4 par 12-12 vyakti bhi bithaye ja sakate hai
 If the number is less, the work can be completed by sitting 4, 4 in the same direction in all four directions
 yahi kram 9 kundon kii yajyashala main rah saktaa he
 9 on the main pond and 12x8 on the remaining 8 ie 96+ 9 = 105 people can sit at once
 sankhya kam ho to kundon par unhen kam-kam bithaaya ja saktaa he
 Samidha means the wood which should be burnt or put into the yagna

 Other people with similar qualities will also come near us and our family will be like that
 isaliye jaisaa vaataavaran ham apane chaaron ore dekhnaa chaahate hon, pehle swayan vaisaa banane kaa praytn karen
 Fire, like touching itself does not become dirty by touching dirty things, but also makes the contaminated things as pure as ourselves, similarly we should not be affected by the evils of others
 swayan bure na banane lagen, varan apni achchhaayiyon se unhen prabhavit karke pavitra banaaven

 An authentic version of its original text has also been published in the editing of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra as 'keshava-granthvali, Part-2' from Hindustani Academy, Allahabad
 'ramchandra chandrika' 39 prakaashon main katha suchi sahit 1717 chhandon main puraa hua he
 According to Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, although the well-known Ramakatha is described in this, it is a poetry of poetry, not of devotion
 keshav 'nimbark sampradaay' main dikshit hone ke naate radha krishna ke upaask the, ram ke nahin
 Although Ramachandrika is a Ramakatha epic, the narrative in it differs from the Valmiki Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas
 haalaanki kavi ke ullekh ke anusaar is mahakavy ko rachane kii prerana unhen adikavi valmiki se hi mili
 They wrote that is ke purvardh kii katha valmikiy ramayana se kuch-kuch samya bhi rakhata he kintu uttarardh main kavi kii nijee udbhaavna evam vyavastha hi pramukh he
 The poet's erudition is demonstrated through this poetry
 samvaad-yojana, alankaar-yojana, chand-yojana kii drushti se yah kavy kavi ke acharyatv ke kaushal ko hi prastut karata he
 In this, the poet has broken the well-known narrative tradition
 vastutah unhone is granth-rachana main pratyaksh sahyog sanskrit ke 'prasanraghav', 'hanumannatak' aadi granthon se liya he
 'kadambari' also has a clear effect
 naatakon kaa aadhaar lene se or katha bhaag chhod dene se samvaad ke vaktaaon ke naam inhen padya se pruthak rakhane pade hai
 The dialogue-planning is done in a dramatic way, so it can be used with visual simplicity as a special feature
 keshav ke is kavyagranth main bhakthi kii pradhanta na hote hue bhi ram ko avtari mana gaya he tathaa anek sthalon par unase upadesh dilaayaa gaya he
 As a result, the didactic passages have become substantial and poetry has been damaged
 keshav ko reetikaal kaa yuganirmaataa sahityakar tathaa hindi kaa pratham acharya kavi mana gaya he
 From this point of view, the predominance of Acharyatva is also evident in Ramachandrika
 style kii drushti se isamen vividh prakaar ke chhandon ke udhaaharan prastut karne kii pravriti dikhaai padati he
 It seems that poets are teaching someone the method of pingle
 ramchandrika kii bhashaa sanskritpradhan brajabhasha he
 Due to excessive use of Sanskrit words and the miracle of ornamentation, the composition has become cumbersome and annoying
 is granth main kavi kii sahrudayata se kahin adhik panditya kaa pradarshan prabal he
 In the words of Acharya Vishwanath Prasad Mishra, it undoubtedly expresses the great piety and acharya of Keshava
 pracheen hindi sahitya kaa marmajna hone ke liye ramchandra chandrika kaa adhyayan nirvivaad rup se anivaary he
 It has an important place in Hindi literature

 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper

 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape

 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle

 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets

 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
 yahaan yah dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki lekhankan main unheen saudon evam ghatnaon kaa lekha kiya jaataa hai jo vittiya swabhaav kii hai tathaa jinhen mudra ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 After accounting for monetary transactions, they are classified according to their nature into separate groups on the basis of equality so that separate information can be available for different items separately
 udhaahrantaya samast bikri ke saudo ko, jo bhinn bhinn sthanon par likhe gayi hai, ek hi sthaan par ekatrit karnaa, taaki kul bikri kii raashi gyaat ho sake
 This is done by opening accounts in the ledger
 lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy nirnay lene waalon ke liye mahatvapurn soochna pradaan karnaa he
 For this work, at the end of the year, after finding the balances of all the accounts, a list is made from them and two details - profit and loss account and letter are prepared from that list
 in vivaranon se vyavsaay kii laabhadaayakta, vittiya sthiti, bhugtan kshamta aadi ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he
 In this way all the information of the year is summarized and merges into two details which shows the final results of the business
 lekhankan na keval lekha karne, vargeekaran karne evam sankshipteekaran karne kaa hi kaary karti he balki un aankadon kaa nirvachan karke nishkarsh evam upyogi suchnaaain bhi pradaan karti he
 For example, what was the rate of repatriation in the organization? How much did advertising impact sales growth? Information such as the status of liquidity and payment capacity are available
 lekhon ke vishleshan evam nirvachan se praapt soochnaaon kaa unke prayogkartaaon jaise viniojakon, lendaaron, sarkaar, swaamiyon aadi tathaa vyavsaay main hit rakhane vaale anya vyaktiyon ko sanvahan kiya jaataa he taaki ve vyavsaay kii vittiya sthiti ke sambandh main apni raay bana saken tathaa bhavi yojana ke sambandh main nirnay le sake
 The last task of accounting is to make such arrangements so that various statutory requirements can be met
 anek aise kanoon hai jinaki purti karnaa ek vyavsaayee ke dwaara anivaary he jaise iskar kii ritern prastut karnaa, bikrikar kii ritern prastut karnaa, sebi ke dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon kii paalna karnaa aadi
 Accounting helps in this task

 icchit kaanch ke tukade ko hathaudi, yaa sandsi se chaaron taraf se todakar lens ke aakaar kaa bana lete hai
 To make a convex lens, the cup-shaped and dome-shaped device is mounted on an iron rod to make a concave lens, which is rotated by an electric motor
 is yantron kii vakrata-trigya lens kii vaanchit vakrata-trigya ke baraabar hoti he
 a piece of glass is rubbed into this machine and uses sand between the glass and the device to rub it
 aajkal ret ke sthaan par carborandam kaa churna upyog main aata he
 As the lens wears, more pure instruments are applied and the powder is also used thinner
 ghisne ke baad lens par ferick-oxide kii polish karte hai
 When polishing, a thin layer of wax, or pitch, is applied to the wear
 lens ke donon satahon ko ghisne ke pashchaat iske kinaaron ko ghiskar gol bana dete hai
 Nowadays, diamond powder is used to create curvature
 yadi kisi goleey sataha par uski vakrata-trigya se kam trigya kaa vrittakar valay rakhaa jaae to valay goleey sataha par thik baithegaa
 The spinning bowl-shaped device, which has diamond powder on its edges, is adjusted such that its rotation axis cuts the lens axis at the curvature of the desired spherical surface
 yantra is tarah jhukaa rahata he ki uskaa kinaaraa banaae janevaale lens ko bich main katata he
 When the lens and the device rotate on their own axis, the desired curvature-radius lens is formed
 acchhee ghisaai evam polish ke liye bahut hi shuddh vakrata-trigya kaa yantra prayukt hota he tathaa karvorandam churna bhi bahut baarik liya jaataa he
 At the time of grinding, the particles of powder break into particles of different sizes
 phir se churna kaa upyog karte samay bhinn-bhinn aakaar ke kanon ko alag-alag kar lenaa aavashyak he, kyonki patale churna main bade aakaar ke ek kan kii upasthiti bhi lens main khanronch paidaa kar degi
 Particles of different sizes are separated by flowing a stream of water, because particles of similar size are collected at one place when they flow in water
 adhik shuddh vakrata-trigya ke lens banane ke liye pehle bataae dhang se ghise lenson ko lohe ke ek yantra par samooh ke rup main rakhte hai
 a small pitch button is made on the upper surface of the lenses and the lower surface is soaked and affixed to the device for some time
 lohe ke ek duusare dhaanche ko garam kar lenson par bane batano ke upar rakh dete hai
 The heat softens the buttons and clings to the upper structure
 puure upkaran ko thande pani se thanda karte hai, jisase upree dhaanche se lenson kaa samooh jud jaataa he
 While grinding, the lower device rotates around the vertical axis, while the upper structure oscillates from one side to the other
 polish karte samay neeche ke ghisnevaale yantra ke sthaan par ek doosraa yantra lagaate hai, jisaki sataha par pich kii ek patali parat lagi rahati he
 The radius of curvature of the surface of the pitch mounted on the polishing machine is corrected by pressing the device with the opposite curvature
 isi kaaran polish karanevaale yantron ke jode banaae jate he, jode ke ek sadsy kii sataha uttal hoti he or duusare kii avatal
 People have different views regarding the action of grinding and polishing
 parantu itnaa nishchit he ki ghiste samay carborandam ke churna main upasthit kanon ke kinare kaanch par dabaav daalate hai, jisase kaanch main se chote chote tukade katkar nikal jo he or kaanch lens kii akruti kaa ho jaataa he
 At this time the glass surface is rough
 polish kii kriya ke sambandh main kuch logon kaa vichaar he ki yah kriya bhi ghisne kii kriya hi he

 praaia: lenson kii sataha goleey hoti he, kyonki yahi ek aisi jyamitiya akruti he jise purna shuddhta or aasaani se banaaya ja saktaa he
 The angular lens is made by grinding on a cylindrical device of opposite curvature
 ghiste samay yantra kaa ghurnan aksh lens ke akshake samaantar hona chahie
 If the lens is also free to rotate, it will be spherical instead of cylindrical
 at: ghiste samay lens sthir hona chahie
 If the axis of a lens is the rotating axis, but the surface of the lens is not spherical, then such lens is called Agoli lens
 aise lens ko vaanchit aakaar ke ghisne ke yantra par ghiskar banaaya jaataa he
 The Agoli lens is used as an optical lens and in binocular ophthalmic and some cameras
 kaanch parabangnee or avarakt prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he

 When plastic materials are made into lenses by heat, they are cheap and light
 aajkal doordarshee or camera ke plastic abhidrishyak lens ko banane ke praytn hue hai
 a proper methacrylate was replaced with a crown glass and polystyrene instead, but due to changes in plastic materials due to the effect of humidity and heat, many problems arise
 lens ghiste samay bich bich main is baat kii jaanch kii jaati he ki sataha goleey he or lens vaanchit vakrata kii trigya kaa he yaa nahin
 Place the outer edge of a brass plate with a radius equal to the curvature radius of the round and desired lens on the surface of the lens and see if it fits properly
 yadi vah thik nahin baithta he, to usee ke anusaar lens ko phir ghisa jaataa he
 Checking again when polished for greater accuracy
 iske liye kaanch kaa ek pareekshan patt prayukt hota he, jisaki vakrata kii trigya vipareet chihn ke saath lens kii vanchit vakrata trigya ke baraabar hoti he, arthath yadi lens uttal he or uski vakrata trigya 25 senmi
 he, to pareekshan patt avatal hoga or uski bhi vakrata trigya 25 semi
 hogi
 If the lens is fine, a parallel film of air will form between the surface of the lens and the test board
 prakaash kii kiran film kii donon satahon se paravartan ke pashchaat keval ek rang kii dikhaai dengi or paravartit kiran kaa rang film kii motaai par nirbhar karegaa
 But if the surface of the lens is not spherical or the radius of curvature is not correct, the film thickness will vary at each point and a newton ring will form in the film
 lens ko phir se thodaa ghiskar thik kiya jaataa he
