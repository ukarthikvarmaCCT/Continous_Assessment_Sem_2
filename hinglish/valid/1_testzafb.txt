 panchtatv se nimanlikhit kaa bodh ho saktaa he- This article has been translated from this version of the Wikipedia article Wiki
 Wiki ek website he jo viki software kaa upyog karke kisi bhi sankhya main aapas main jude web pannon ke nirmaan or sampadan ko sambhav banati he, brouzar ke bheetar ek sarlikrut markup bhashaa yaa ek WYSIWYG paath sampadak kaa upyog karte hue
 vikiyon kaa upyog aksar sahyogi websiten banane ke liye, samudaay websiton ko gati pradaan karne ke liye or tippaniyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia is one of the best known examples of wikis
 vikiyon kaa upyog vyapaar main intranet or gyaan prabandhan pranali pradaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Ward Cunningham, creator of the first wiki software, wikiwikiweb, initially described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work
" "viki" ek hawaiyan shabd he jiskaa arth "tej" he
 "wiki" can be expanded to "what i Know Is", but it is a backronym
 vikivikiweb pehali site thi jise viki kaha gaya
 Ward Cunningham began developing Wikiquiweb in 1994 and established it on the Internet domain c2
com on 25 March 1995
 iskaa namakaran kaningham dwaara kiya gaya tha, jinhen honolulu antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke ek counter karmchaaree kii smriti ho ai jisane unase "viki viki " shatal bas lene ke liye kaha tha jo hawaii adde ke terminlon ke bich chalati he
 According to Cunningham, "I chose wiki wiki as a replacement for 'quick', so avoided naming this thing as quick-web
" " Cunningham was also somewhat inspired by Apple's hypercard
 appal ne ek pranali kaa dijin kiya tha jo upyogkartaaon ko abhaasi "cardon ke dher" banane kii anumati pradaan karata tha, yah vibhinn cardon ke bich sampark kaa samarthan karata tha
 Cunningham introduced Vannevar Bush's idea by allowing users to "comment on and change each other's lessons"
 2000 kii shuruyaat main, vikiz ko udhyam main teji se sahyogi software ke rup main apanaaya jane laga
 saamaanya upyogon main shaamil the pariyojna sanchaar, intranet or pralekhan, shuru main takneekee prayoktaaon ke liye
 aaj kuch companiyaan viki kaa upyog apane ekmaatr sahyogi software or sthitik intranet ke sthanapann ke rup main karti hai or kuch skool tathaa vishvavidhyalay viki kaa prayog samuhik adhigam ko badhaava dene hetu karte hai
 The utility of wikis may be more behind firewalls than public internet
 15 march 2007 ko, viki ne online oxford angreji shabdkosh main pravesh kiya
 Ward Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf describe the essence of the wiki concept in their book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web: viki ek web brouzar kaa upyog karte hue saral markup bhashaa main dastavejon ke sahyogi lekhan ko sakasham banaata he
 a page in a wiki website is called a "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well connected by hyperlinks, is called a "wiki"
 viki multah jaankaree pradaan karne, browz karne or khojane kaa ek databes he
 Easily creating and updating pages is a defining feature of wiki technology
 saamanyatya, sanshodhano ko swikaarne se pehle koi samiksha nahin hoti he
 In many wikis, the general public can make changes without registering their user accounts
 kabhi kabhi main ek satr login kaa suzav diya jaataa he, sampadan par swatah hastakshar hetu ek "viki hastakshar" kuki ke nirmaan ke liye
 haalaanki, kai sampadan vaastavik samay main kiye ja sakate hai or lagbhag tunrat online dikhaai dene lagate hai
 This can promote misuse of the system
 nijee viki sarvaron main prishthon ko sampadit or kabhi kabhaar padhne ke liye bhi pramanikaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Users can edit content in wikis in a number of ways
 saamanytah, viki prishthon kii sanrachana or swarupan ek saral markup bhashaa main nirdisht hoti he, jise kabhi kabhaar "vickytixt " kehete hai
 For example, starting a line with an asterisk is often used to enter it into a bulleted list
 vickytixt kii style or vaakyavinyas bahut bhinn hote hai, inamen se kuch HTML tags kii anumati bhi dete hai
 The reason for taking this approach is that HTML is not very legible with its many cryptic tags, so it is difficult to edit
 isliye viki saral paathya sampadan ko tavajjo dete hai jahaan HTML kii tulana main style or sanrachana ke liye kam or aasaan niyam hote hai
 Although the wiki's limited access to HTML and cascading style sheets also limits the freedom for users to change the structure and appearance of wiki content, it also has some advantages
 siesas tak simit abhigam iske avlokan main samanta pradaan karata he or javascript ko aksham karke upyogkarta ko code, jo ki anya upyogkartaaon ke abhigam ko simit kar saktaa he, lagu karne se roka ja saktaa he
 March Rabbit insisted, "take some more tea" to Alice
 "maine abhi tak kuch nahin kiya he," elis ne aahat swar main uttar diya: "isliye main or nahin le sakati
" "you mean you can't take less," Hatter said: "it's easier to take more than nothing
 " More and more, wikis are making "WWYSIWYG" editing available to users, usually through javascript or an activex control that translates graphically inserted formatting instructions such as "bold" and "italics" into their corresponding HTML tags or wikitext
 Give
 inamen, prishth ke naveen sampadit, marcd-ap sanskaran kaa markup utpann hota he or paardarshee tareeke se sarwar ko prastut kar diya jaataa he, upyogkarta in takneekee vistaaron se bachaa rahata he
 However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all the features available in wikitext
 adhikansh viki prishthon main kiye gaye parivartanon kaa record rakhte hai; praayah prishth ke sabhi sanskaran sangrahit hote hai
 This means that authors can go to the older version of the page if it becomes necessary because a mistake has been made or the page has been tampered with
 kai karyanvayan upyogkartaaon ko prishth sampadit karte samay "sampadan saransh" kii aapurti karne kii anumati pradaan karte hai
 It is a short text summarizing the changes
 It is not put into the article, but rather stored with modifications, allowing users to explain what has been done and why; This is similar to a log message when a modification control system changes
 aamtaur par adhikansh prishthon ke bheetar anya prishthon par jane ke liye badi sankhya main hypertext link hote hai
 This non-linear type of navigation is more "local" to wikis than structured / formal navigation schemes
 upyogkarta padanukramit vargeekaran yaa apni icchaanusaar sanghathan ke kisi bhi prakaar ke prishth saamagree ke index yaa talikaay bana sakate hai
 Maintaining them by hand can be challenging, as many authors continue to create and destroy pages in an ad hoc manner
 aise index prishthon ke rakrakhaav hetu aam taur par vikiz prishthon ko vargeekrut or tag karne ke liye ek yaa adhik tareeke pradaan karte hai
 Most wikis have a backlink feature, which shows all the pages associated with the illuminated page
 un prishthon kaa nirmaan jo abhi astitv main nahin hai, viki kii ek visheshta he
 Through this, the wiki invites others to express their views on new topics
 kadiyaan ek vishisht vaakyavinyas ke upyog dwaara banaayin jaati hai, tathakthith "link pattern" 
shuruyaat main adhikansh vikiz prishthon ke namakaran or kadiyaan banane ke liye camelcase kaa upyog karte the
 They are made by writing the words in capital letters in a sentence and removing the spaces between them
 While camelcase makes linking very easy, it also helps with links that are written in a form that is derived from the standard spelling
 camelcase aadhaarit vikiz tunrat hi pahachaani jaati hai kyonki unamem "beginnerquestions" or "tableofcontents " jaise naamon vaali kai kadiyaan hoti hai
 To make the words visible in the wiki beautiful, it is possible to re-insert spaces between them and possibly even be written in small words
 haalanki, pathan ko behatar banane ke liye kadi kaa yah punahprishkaran, camelcase utkraman ke kaaran hone vaali bade shabdon kii jaankaree ke nuksaan dwaara simit ho jaataa he
 For example, "richardwagner" should appear as "richard Wagner", while "popularmusic" should appear as "popular music"
 There is no easy way to find out which words should remain big
 As a result, many wikis now have "free links" using brackets, and some already have camelcase inactive
 adhikansh viki samudaay nijee hote hai, vishesh rup se udhyamon ke bheetar
unka upyog aksar aantarik pranaaliyon or anuprayogon ke liye aatanrik pralekhan ke rup main hota he
 Wikinodes are pages on a wiki that describe related wikis
 ve aamtaur par padosiyon or pratinidhiyon ke rup main vyavasthit rahete hai
 a neighbor wiki is a wiki that can discuss similar content or be interesting in some other way
 ek pratinidhi viki vah viki he jo kuch samagriyon ko swayan ko saunpe jane ke liye sahamat hoti he
 One way to find a wiki on a specific topic is to follow a wiki-node network from wiki to wiki; Another way is to "bus travel" a wiki, for example: Wikipedia's Tour Bus Stop domain names containing "wikis" are increasing in popularity, enabling specific things
 jo swayan kaa viki banane ke icchhuk hon, saarvajanik rup se uplabdh "viki farm" maujuud hai, inamen se kuch nijee or password dwaara sangrakshit viki bhi bana sakate hai
 pbwiki, Socialtext, Wetpaint and Wikia are popular examples of such services
 adhik jaankaree ke liye, viki formon kii suchi dekhen

 Although the sound of doctrine was established by Anandavardhana, the recognition of sound as Kavyatma was disputed till that time; Therefore, neither Bhojdev nor Bhatt Mammat adopted the determination to give voice as a soul in the definition of poetry in a literal sense
 donon aacharyon ne kavy main doshabhaav tathaa gunvattta ko pradhanta di he
 It is the specialty of Bhojdev that he has accepted the utility of ornaments and has considered it necessary for poetry to be restored

 Except for the custom of these twelve elements, detailed explanation of the remaining elements is not found in any other available literature in Sanskrit
 banbhatta ne kavyasaushthav ke vishesh tatv, shayya kaa ullekh kiya he parantu uski paribhaasha keval saraswatikanthabharan main hi uplabdh hoti he
 Thereafter, an example is given of the vulgar distinctions of puns, puns, alliteration, pictures, pralica, esoteric and q & As

 Subsequently, Bhojdev, discussing the causes of poetry, presents three distinctions of poetry in the form of audio, visual and pictorial

 Its creator Bhojdev is not going to be afraid of Granthavistar, he always makes a generous effort to explain many subtle differences and strains by giving examples

 devataaon ke atyaachaari raja zeans ne unhen nasht karne kaa nirnay liya, lekin ek titan promethius ne, jiske naam kaa matlab tha "doordarshita", apane "philanthropos tropos " yaa "maanavtaa-premi swabhaav" ke kaaran unhen shashakt, jivan-vardhak banane vaale do uphaar die: aag, jo samast gyaan, kaushal, praudyogiki, kala or vigyaan kaa pratik tha or "agyaat aashaa" yaa ashavad
 donon ek saath chale - aag ke saath maanav ashaavadi ho saktaa tha; ashavad ke saath, vah maanvon kii haalat main sudhaar karne ke liye aag kaa rachanaatmak istemaal kar saktaa tha

" and Robert Bremner's "goal of philanthropy 


 to improve the quality of human life"

 Microscopy or microscopy is a branch of science, in which micro and microscopic organisms are able to enlarge, which is not possible to see with ordinary eyes
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy sookshmjeev sansar kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 It uses light reflection, refraction, diffraction and electromagnetic radiation
 vigyaan kii is shakha mukhya prayog jeev vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Microscopy is used to control diseases and discover new drugs around the world
 sookshmdarshan kii teen prachlit shakhaon main optical, electron evam scanning prob sookshmdarshan aate hai
 The subject of microscopy is thought to have originated in the early 17th century
 isi samay jab vaigyanikon or abhiyantrikon ne bhautikee main lens kii khoj kii thi
 After the invention of the lens, it was possible to see objects larger than their original size
 isse pani main paae jane vaale chote or anya ati sookshm jantuon kii gatividhiyon ke darshan sulabh hue or vaigyanikon ko unke bare main naye tathyon kaa gyaan hua
 Only after this, the scientists also came to know that the vast world is waiting for them about the living world and how little their knowledge was till now
 microscopy kii shakha ke rup main drushti sambandhi sookshmdarshan kaa janm sabase pehle mana jaataa he
 It is also called light microscope
 jeev-jantuon ke angon ko dekhne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 Light microscopes are relatively expensive but better equipment
 sookshmdarshan ke kshetra main electron sookshmdarshi kii khoj atyant mahatvapurn mile kaa pathar mana jaataa he kyonki isaki khoj ke baad vastuon ko unke vaastavik aakaar se kai hajaar guna bada karke dekhnaa sambhav hua tha
 It was discovered in the twentieth century
 haalanki electron microscope anya sookshmdarshiyon se mahangaa hota he or prayogshaala main iskaa prayog karnaa chaatro ke liye sambhav nahin hota, lekin iske parinaam kaaphi behatar hote hai
 The images obtained from this are very clear
 sookshmdarshan main ek anya takanic kaa prayog hota he, jo electron sookshmdarshan se bhi behatar maani jaati he
 In this, the object is tested from many angles using hand and needle
 graham sten ne isi prakriya main sabase pehle jeevanu ko dekha tha
 Microscopy is an integral part of physics

 Today, microscopes are not only used for viewing objects, but also for measuring, counting and weighing particles of liquids
 manushya kii pravriti sadaa hi adhik se adhik jaanane or dekhne kii rahi he, isi se vah prakruti ke rahasyon ko adhik se adhik suljhaana chahta he
 Our senses have limited ability to function, and so is our eyes
 isaki bhi apana ek seemaa he
 a very distant object that cannot be seen with an empty eye can be seen with a telescope or a detailed description of a very close object can be seen more clearly than a microscope
 yahan sookshmdarshi ke kshetra main 1865 i
 se ab tak jo pragati hui he usee kaa ullekh kiya ja rahaa he: a single convex lens, commonly called a magnification lens, can be called the simplest microscope
 ise 'jebi sookshmdarshi' bhi kehete hai
 a simple microscope is made of a combination of two convex lenses located at a certain distance
 padaardh kii taraf lage lens ko abhidrishyak lens or aankh ke paas lage lens ko 'abhinytra lens' kehete hai
 The field of view of such a microscope is limited
 isamen sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 Adding a lens to the optical lens increases the area and reduces defects caused by spherical chromatography and chromatic chromatography
 aise sookshmdarshi ko sanyukt sookshmdarshi yaa prakaash sookshmdarshi yaa paramparaagat prakaashiya sookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Although the laws of reflection, refraction, and linear transmission of light were known to Greek philosophers a few centuries before Christ, the law of incidence of incidence and sine of angle of refraction was not invented until the late seventeenth century
 holland ke snaill or france ke dekart ne alag-alag iskaa avishkaar kiya
 Alhazain, the Arabian astrologer around 1000 AD, formulated the laws of reflection and refraction, but they were not in the sine, but in a long distance
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki uske paks ek bada lens tha
 The microscope starts from here
 sookshmdarshi nirmaan kaa shrey ek vanaspatijna jekarios jonamids ko he
 According to Hygge, the invention is attributed to Cornelius Drabble
 aibe ke samay tak sookshmdarshi kii paristhiti aisi hi rahi
 In 1870, Abe laid the foundation of a microscope
 unhone suprasiddh tailanimjjan takneekee nikaali
 This achieved the best contrast and magnification
 par jahaan tak parasookshmakanon ke adhyayan kaa sambandh tha, vaigyanik abhi bhi apane ko asahaay anubhav kar rahe the
 In 1873 AD, Abe felt that no matter how perfect the microscope is to be perfected, the fineness of its particles in a substance can be seen only to a certain extent
 keval aankhon se parmaanu yaa anu ko dekhnaa asambhav he kyonki hamaare netron dwaara sookshm vastuon ko dekhne kii ek seemaa he
 This limitation is not only due to the imperfection of the equipment but also due to the nature of light waves to which our eye is sensitive
 yadi hamen dhaatuon ko dekhnaa he to hamaare jaivikividon ko ek aise nae kism ke netron kaa vikaas karnaa hoga jo un tarangon ko grahan karen jo hamaare vartmaan saadhaaran netron, yaa drushtitantrika ko sugrahya hone vaali tarangon kii apeksha hajaaron guna choti hai
 In fact, two adjacent points in an object can never be distinguished if the wavelength of the light in which those points are observed does not exceed twice the distance between those points
 is prakaar se yah unke bilgau ko simit kar detaa he
 This is called the limit of resolution
 ganit main ise nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Limit of differentiation jahaan N
A
 sankhyatmak dwarak he or N
A
 = sin 
 Here u is the refractive index of object distance
 q vah kone he jo rim kiran prakaashik aksh ke saath banaati he
 Thus, considering the radiation of vision, the minimum resolution distance is around 3000 a °
 sabase choti parabegni or avarakt kirnon ke liye yah seemaa kramash: 1500 A° or 3850 A° ke lagbhag hogi, jahaan 1 A° = 10-8 semi

 Let us think of ourselves as former microscopists and consider the reforms that we wanted to do at that time
 saadhaarant: ham apni aashaaon ko chaar baton par kendrit karte hai: The above mentioned improvements or difficulties with the nature of the object, the type of illumination and the photography technology invented the x ray in 1895
 parantu san 1912 tak eks kiran kii tarang prakruti kaa koi pataa nahin tha jab tak vaan laue ne use siddh nahin kiya
 Now it was hoped that X-ray microscopes could be made
 at: us samay yah vichaar tyaag diya gaya
 a few years later, in 1923, The Broglie determined the wave nature of the electron, and in 1927 AD Davison and Germer in New York and GP in Aberdeen
 Tamson confirmed it in 1928 AD
 electron ke kiran punj bhi upyukt vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetra dwaara mode ja sakate hai
 In 1947, Knoll, Rusk and Brukh presented microscopes that could be successfully used
 is vikiran kaa tarangadairghy nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Here h is the constant of Planck, m is mass of electron and q is velocity
 veg voltata kaa falan he, jo electron kiranpunaj kii twarit karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The resolution of up to 10 a ° was possible with this microscope and its magnification capacity was very high

10-8 mimi vistaar kii vastuen dekhi ja sakati hai
 This is undoubtedly a major advance and many new inventions are associated with it
 aaj electron sookshmdarshiki kii apni anek takneekiyaan hai
 Like high-energy electrons, x rays have very high solubility and are less quickly absorbed, as are high-energy electrons
 at: choti apaardarshee vastuon kii aantarik sanrachana gyaat karne main eks kirane prayukt kii ja sakati hai
 Ehrenwerk drew the first X-ray microscope or shadow microscope in 1947 and was corrected in 1948 by Kink Patrick and Bejoy
 electron sookshmdarshi kii tarah yahan nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Only fine holes are required for good reflection
 iskaa arth he ki isse kam vikiran pravesh karata he or isiilie udbhasana bahut bada hota he
 The back has to enlarge the picture for which an emulsion of very fine particles is required
 ab ham saamaanya drishy prakaash sookshmdarshiki kii ore dekhen
 Before we discuss the progress made in that direction, we have to keep in mind the aspirations of microscopists 40 years ago
 ekmaatr upkaran se sab aavashyaktaaon kii saath hi purti sambhav na thi
 The increase in resolution is limited by the value of a numerical gateway whose value cannot exceed 1

 pranali kii aavardhan kshamta kii vruddhi kii bhi ek seemaa hoti he
 It is a function of the focus distances of the used laces
 aavardhan focus duuri kaa pratilom falan he, at: focus duuri kii kami se aavardhan bad jaataa he
 But at the same time the functional distance is destroyed
 aise hi vichaaron ke kaaran lens ke sthaan main darpanon ke upyog se paravarti sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan barch ne bristol main 1947 i
 main kiya
 In principle, the use of radiation up to ultraviolet rays was possible here
 iskaa sankhyik dwarak kam hota he par avarnataa or adhik kriyaatmak duuri kaa isamen laabh hota he
 Since quartz does not absorb radiation up to 2000 a °, the minimum resolution distance would be 1,000 a ° would be obtained from a microscope using quartz lenses, thus using an ultraviolet radiation with this type of configuration is called an 'ultraviolet microscope'
 Is constructed
 yadi saamaanya prakaash sookshmdarshi kaa upyog choti vastuon dwaara bikhare vikiran ko ekatra karne ke liye hota he to is prakaar kii vyavastha ko parasookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Prof
 Zernik used art contrast illumination in microscopes
 is takneekee ko kala vaishamy sookshmdarshiki kehete the
 It is a method of showing the structure of colorless especially transparent materials
 vibhinn sanrachanaon ke kaaran unamem krambhang dekha jaataa he, jaise mechak ke yakrut main
 Biologists seek the help of pigments to improve the contrast
 praaia: vaishamy varna filter se aisa kiya jaataa he
 Only a few types of crystals can be analyzed with polarized light, but all types of crystals can be studied with artesunate
 is takneekee main abhiranjan ke rup main kritrim varnon kaa upyog nahin hota
 Defects in hygiene are reported to be that although the derangement does not destroy the cells of organisms, it cannot be said that it does not affect the organisms or cells at all
 kala-vaishamy-vidhi kaa laabh yah he ki pradipti jo prayek sookshmdarshi main aavashyak he, jeev ko dekhne ke liye or kuch karnaa nahin padataa
 In the art contrast microscope, the microscope remains the normal type
 isamen keval yah naveenta rahati he ki ek naveen prakashmay yukti jod di jaati he
 p is a glass plate with a circular groove
 plate par calcium fluoride kaa paardarshak lep chadha rahata he
 The thickness of the paste remains the same
 nirvaat main vaashpan dwaara lep chadhaaya jaataa he
 The thickness of the coating remains so that the time difference between the light passed by the groove and the other part of the plate is a quarter of the vibration
 da pardaa he jisamen ek valayakaar kaat hoti he jisase abhidrishyak main utana prakaash paarit hota he jitna kalapatt ke khaanche main bharegaa
 The light scattered and diffracted by the object is not passed through the groove, and when this light reaches the reflection, it is not mixed with the light directly reached from the source and the image is formed
 abhinaytrak main yahi pratibimb dikhaai padataa he
 Different parts of the object display different frequencies in light according to refractive index, so the reflection seen in the actress is the refractive image of the object
 yah sookshmdarshi 1952 i
 tak prayog ke liye uplabdh ho gaya
 In 1952, Prof
 Zernik received the Nobel Prize for this achievement
 dison ne 1951 i
 main is samasya ko bhinn rup se suljhaayaa jiske falswaroop unhone vyatikaran sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen paramparaagat kalavaishamy sookshmdarshi se kuch shreshthata thi
 In this, the object is pressed into the middle of two semicircular plates of glass and is seen with a special mirror system in such a way that some light goes straight through the object without passing through the object and the remaining light passes through the object
 is prakaar utpann vyaktikaran finj vastu kii apvartanaank sanrachana ko vyakt kar detaa he
 In fact, this two types of illumination are a means of great importance for a blurred background and artistic human
 dhundli prishthbhumi pradipti atyant sookshm kanon ko dekhne main upyogi siddh hui he or kala vaishamy pradipti se prakaashiya ghanatv main nunatam parivartan jaanane kii takneekee kii sambhaavna bad gai he jisase pratibimb kii vyakhya badi aasaani se kii ja sakati he
 We see that many aspirations of microscopists of forty years ago have been fulfilled
 iskaa yaheen ant nahin he kyonki kisi shodh kaa ant nahin hota or yahi baat sookshmdarshiki ke liye bhi he or aavardhan kshamta ke vibhedan kshamta kii upar di gai seemaa kii vruddhi ke prayaas ab bhi ho rahe hai
 With the use of new types of glass and plastic, further advancement in the technology of microscopy is necessary
 in sab sookshmdarshiyon se, jinka varnan kiya gayaahai, keval vistaar main hi vibhedan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 There is another branch of microscopy which is very spectacular and interesting
 yah prakaash vibhedan sookshmdarshiki he 
 Through this, depth resolution can also be detected
 yah gaharaai main vibhedan karne main utkrisht siddh hua he
 It is an optical and expressive technique known as light cut, light profile, multiple beam beam, fizo fringe and similar color gradient fringe
 in prishthiya chaanbin kii sugrahya vidhiyon main anvik pariman tak safaltaapurvak vibhedan kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of these microscopes would never have been possible if a device had not been developed to make metallic film more reflective by depositing it on the surface
