 There is a difference of only the basic units in all of them, but in fact they all follow the tithe method

 This system was first used in the evaluation of goods in the early days of the French Revolution, and within a few years after the revolution, all the measurement of the country was started by the decimal system

 In 1870, a conference was called by the French government to provide international recognition to the system, which was attended by representatives from 30 countries and accepted the suggestion of international recognition of the system

 These difficulties made it very difficult to exchange goods and to know their true sense

 Some of the major variations of the metered system are: sakht chakrika sanchaalak ek data bhandarad upkaran he jisame gol ghoomane vaali sakht gol chakrikaay hoti hai
 It is used for storing data in computers
 sakht chakrika athwa hard drive kaa ye matlab bhi ho saktaa he : The Panopticon is a type of institutional building designed by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century
 'panopticon' shabd do ghatakon se mil kar bana he : pen or opticon
 Pun means prisoner and opticon means watchdog monitor
 ek aisi jagah jahaan kaidiyon par nigaah rakhi jaati ho, jail hi ho sakati he
 The credit for formulating this post and its associated theory goes to the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham
 unhone 1785 main ek karagaar kii dizin ke rup main iskaa imarti blueprint banaaya tha
 They wanted to build a circular building with a high tower in the middle
 tower or uske chaaron ore kuch dur bani charadivari ke bich kaidiyon yaa paaglon ko rakhane vaali kothriyaan banani thim
 Bentham's plan was to always keep lights in these cells so that the activities of the people living in them could be monitored from the tower
 bentham kaa makasad tha ki kaidiyon yaa paaglon ko apni nigaraanee kaa pataa nahin laganaa chahie
 Bentham was an advocate of utilitarian philosophy and believed that if the prison was built in such a way that the inmates could not see the watchdog above them, the cost of surveillance would be greatly reduced
 chunki kaidiyon ko pataa hi nahin hoga ki un par najar rakhi ja rahi he yaa nahin, isliye nigaraneekartta ko hameshaa duty par rahane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The importance of the panopticon is not just for sociology
 uske liye to panopticon kaa vichaar ek roopak kii haisiyat praapt kar chukaa he
 French thinker Michel Fuco, in his work 'discipline and Punish', showed the use of Bentham's concept of how modern society developed not only prisons, but also Kotikram-based structures such as the army, schools, hospitals and factories, historically known as Panopticons
 Has happened on the lines of phuko ke anusaar aadhunik samaaj anushaasan lagu karnaa chahta he, jiske liye use apane har sadsy par har haalat main nigaraanee karne kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This process of monitoring goes on as if nothing is happening, everything is normal
 yahi panopticon kaa uddeshy he
 It is not that Bentham was also unfamiliar with the strong urges of centralism inherent in the Panopticon idea
 isliye unhone ise ek aisi abhootpurv vidhi ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya tha jiske zariye ek mastishk duusare par apni satta sthapit kar saktaa he
 In addition to the prison, they also saw it on a wide plank
 unki manyata thi ki agar panopticon jaise sthapaty ke tahat kaam kiya jaae to logon ko naitik drushti se sudhara ja sakegaa, unki tandurusti thik rahegi, udyogon main nayi jaan pad jaaegi, shiksha kaa prasar ho sakegaa, janata ke upar boj kam hoga, arthvyavastha kaa aadhaar chattan kii tarah thos hota chalaa jayega or kanoon apni kamazoriyon ke baavjood sudrudh ho sakegaa
 This statement suggests that Bentham had high expectations from the Panopticon
 shaayad isiilie unhone apane jivan kaa kaafii samay or apni dhan-sampatti kaa ek bada hissaa panopticon kii dizine par aadhaarit karagaar banavaane kii koshishon par kharchar kiya
 Bentham faced a number of political and financial difficulties during this affair
 1811 main british sansad kii taraf se unhen aisi imaarat khadi karne ke liye jagah kareedne kii ijazat mili lekin england ke raja ne us par apni muhar lagane se inkaar kar diya
 Two years later, the Parliament awarded Bentham 23,000 pounds to make up for the financial loss he suffered
 kul mila kar bentham ke jeevankaal main unki dizine ke aadhaar par koi bhi jailkhaanaa nahin ban sakaa
 Later influenced by the idea of panopticon, many prisons were built in Britain, America, Hungary, Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Vietnam, France, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Cuba and South Africa
 england main wooster state hospital or darbishaire kii round mil kii imaaraten bhi panopticon se prabhavit ho kar banaayi gayi maani jaati hai
 Today the panopticon has gone out of fashion as architecture
 par samaaj or nagaarikon par nigaraanee kaayam karne ke siddhant ke rup main uskaa mahatva lagaataar badha he
 Panopticon-like structures continue to be mentioned in literary and cultural representations
 inamen frenz kaafka kii vikhyath rachana da kaisel or gabriyal garsia mariyez kii chronical of a death fortold bhi shaamil he
 Michel Fuco expands the idea of the Panopticon by applying it to that basic trend of modern society, introducing the notion of 'panoptysism' under which human populations are managed and controlled by forces that often remain invisible to great purity And thankfully, this work is done
 phuko likhte hai ki agar panopticon main rahane vaale kaidi hai to unki nigaraanee kaa yah tarika unke dwaara kii jane vaali kisi saazish, palaayan kii kisi samuhik yojana, bhavishya main kiye ja sakane vaale kisi aparaadh yaa ek-duusare par padane vaale kisi karaab prabhaav kii sambhaavnaayen nirast kar degaa
 If the building belongs to a hospital, it can prevent the spread of infectious diseases through surveillance, if it is a madhouse, then the danger of crazy violence against each other can be eliminated, if it is a school then children are cheated Doing, noisy, talking and wasting time can be prevented
 or, agar vah koi factory he to mazdooron ke bich avyavashtha, chori, gutbazi jaisi gatividhiyon par najar rakhi ja sakati he jinase kaam kii rakrataar ghatati he yaa uskaa str girtaa he yaa durghatnaayen hoti hai
 According to Fuco, this process guarantees power over the monitored people of the watchdog, despite the fact that the monitored people do not realize the power imposed on them
 is lihaaz se panopticon swachaalit prakriya kaa rup le letaa he
 According to Fuko, the invisible invisible person becomes aware of the behavior of the monitored people without any problems
 yah silsilaa keval nigaraneekartta or nigaranishuda ke bich sambandh tak hi simit nahin rahata
 The 'panoptic View' 841P should have the capability to be molded
 iske liye ek abhinayta apni nigaranishudaaon ke liye itani anaapattijanak ho jaati he ki ve vyakti ke rup main use aatmsaat kar lete hai, is had tak ki unase khud apni hi nigaraanee karaayi ja sakati he
 They become agents of their own repression and control
 apane vishleshan main phuko is nattejey par pahonchte hai ki na keval udaarataavaadi loktantron main panoptisizam ko aadhaar banaaya jaataa he, balki poonjeewaadi vyavastha hi vikaas-dar or munaafe ko lagaataar badhaate rahane ke liye panoptisizam ko apanaati he
 According to Fuco, the structures of the Panopticon reflect Christianity-related labor values, morals and loyalty to centralized authority
 poonjeewaadi vyavastha main ishwar jaise praadhikaar kii jagah aarthik jagat ke abhijanon ko mil jaati he
 This analysis of Fuko is of the pre-internet era
 lekin kya internet kii digital duniya kii nirakaarata panopticon se mukt he? chlose sarkit tivi or videography ke zariye kii jane vaali nigaraanee ko to aasaani se panoptic nigaah kii sangya di ja sakati he, par slvoj jizek kaa to kahana he ki bentham dwaara pratipaadit panopticon main to nirakaarata apane shuddhtam rup main milti he
 Nobody knows if there is anyone at the center of that panopticon
 agar pataa ho to ki vahaan koi he to panopticon kaa daraavnaapan thodaa kam ho jayega
 But, in the language of Bentham, it is a very dark place
 koi peechha kar rahaa he, is baat kaa ehsaas zyaada daraavna hota he bajaay iske ki pataa ho ki vastav main koi peechha kar rahaa he
 Such uncertainty is extremely disturbing
 sambhavtah yahan jijec kaa saafe ishaara internet sambandhi un samhitaon kii taraf he jinke tahat aiespi ke zarie yuzars or unki gatividhiyon kaa na keval pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he, balki unke kaamkaaj ko record tak kiya ja saktaa he

 Tulu is a popular language in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts located in the western side of Karnataka state of India and in some parts of North Kerala
 pehle tulu brahman vaidic or sanskrit sahitya likhane ke liye 'tiglri' naamak lipi ko upyog karte the
 But very little literature is found in Tulu language
 par aaj is lipi ko jaananevaale bahut kam hai

 Jains - The speaking style of Jains from the northern parts of Tulunadu
 saamaanya - tulunadu ke zyaadaatar logon kii bolanewaali style
 This style is used in commerce, art, entertainment
 adivasee - adivasee logon kii bolanewaali style
 According to some old Malayalam works, the area which spread from the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod to Gokarna in Uttara Kannada was known as Tulunadu
 par aaj kaa tulunadu dakshin kannada or udupi jilon tak hi simit he
 Nevertheless, many people who speak Tulu are found in Kasargod in Kerala and Mumbai and Thana in Maharashtra

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity

 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components
 It depends

 It is said that Shasta was born to the consort of Mohini Veshadhari Vishnu and Shiva
 unheen ayppan kaa mashhoor mandir punakvan ke naam se vikhyath 18 pahadiyon ke bich sthit is dham main he, jise sabarimala shridharmashashtha mandir kaha jaataa he
 It is also believed that Parashurama installed the idol at Sabarimala for Ayyappan worship
 kuch log ise rambhakt shabari ke naam se jodakar bhi dekhte hai
 Some people say that about 700-800 years ago, there was a lot of disharmony between Shaivites and Vaishnavas in the south
 tab un matbhedon ko dur karne ke liye shri ayppan kii pariklpana kii gai
 This dharmatirtha was developed to coordinate both
 aaj bhi yah mandir samanvay or sadbhaav kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Here people from any caste-fraternity and any religion can come
 panpa pahunchakar hamane paidal hi sabarimala tak kii yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 This path is inaccessible, but the feeling of being among nature makes the mind ready to take such a risk
 makar sankranti or uttara phalguni nakshatra ke sanyog ke din, panchami tithi or vrishchik lagn ke sanyog ke samay hi shri ayppan kaa janm mana jaataa he
 That is why the festival is celebrated in the Dharmashastha temple on the day of Makar Sankranti

 Consider one more thing here
 yahaan zyaadaatar purush bhakt maujuud the
 Female devotees were few
 agar thim bhi, to budhi auraten
 When asked about this by a priest of the temple, it came to know that Sri Ayyappan was a Brahmachari
 isliye yahaan ve choti bacchiyaan aa sakati hai, jo rajaswala na hui hon yaa budhi auraten, jo isse mukt ho chuki hai
 Despite not accepting the bond of caste-religion, this bond is to be followed by the devotees
 baaki, dharm nirpekshata kii adbhut misaal yah dekhne ko milti he ki yahaan se kuch hi duuri par erumeli naamak jagah par shri ayppan ke sahyogi maane jane vaale muslim dharmanuai vaavar kaa makbara bhi he, jahaan mattha teke bina yahaan kii yatra puri nahin maani jaati
 Apart from the coordination of two votes, a unique form of religious tolerance was seen here

 The person who leads the batch, Iramudi is in his hands
 pehle paidal milon yatra karne vaale log apane saath khaane-pine kii vasteen bhi potliyon main lekar chalate the
 This was the custom of pilgrimage
 ab aisa nahin
 But devotion is the same
