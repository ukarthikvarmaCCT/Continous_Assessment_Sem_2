 is samay se mrityu paryant vah ek sthaan se duusare or duusare se tisare ek ek tirthayatri kii yaa kareeb kareeb ek bhikhaari kii tarah baraabar bhatakta rahaa
 These days its position was like a rudderless boat
 dar dar kii thokaren khate hue usne badi katutaa ke saath anubhav kiya ki duusare ke ghar kii roti kitni swadaheen hoti he or paraye ghar kii sidhiyon par chadhate utarate rahane main kitni pidaa kaa anubhav hota he
 In 1316, a public declaration was made by Florence, and on some derogatory terms, she was also allowed to return to Florence
 usne ise thukraa die or ant tak pravaas main hi jeevanyaapan kaa nishchay kiya
 He died in Ravenna in 1321 and was buried there
 ravenna ke adhikari aaj bhi uske shav ko uski janmabhoomivaalon ko lautaane ke liye taiyaar nahin, jinhone uske saath aisa nindaneey vyavhaar kiya tha
 The names of the two women are closely associated with the life of the teeth
 ek he biatris portinari or duusari jemya donaati
 The first was her puberty beloved whom she saw when she was only nine years old
 simon di bardi ke saath biatris kaa vivaah ho jane tathaa thode hi samay ke bheetar san 1290 main uski mrityu ho jane ke baad bhi daante uske anuraag main duba rahaa
 The second woman, Gemya, was his married wife with whom he was married in 1277
 daante ke nirvasit hone par usne uskaa saath nahin diya
 It is clear that the teeth were not satisfied with his behavior and color, and later started hating him
 daante kii rachanaaon kii suvidha kii drushti se ham teen bhaagon yaa kaalon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, those works can be kept in which the enthusiasm of youth and its fervent affection for Biatris is reflected in religious conversion
 isaki avadhi mote taur par 1283 se 1290 tak maani ja sakati he
 The most important composition of this period is Vita Nuova
 doosraa bhaag viatris kii mrityu ke baad shuru hota he
 It can be expanded from 1291 to 1313
 is kaal main uskaa jivan niraashaa, du:kha evam vishwaas par asthaayee rup se tarkbuddhi kaa praadhanya chaa gaya or uskaa jhukaav darshan tathaa vigyaan kii or adhik ho gaya
 He continued to indulge in a tussle or schemes in the acrimony of political quarrels
 is kaal kii mukhya rachanaayen hai - di konvivio, di moderkiya, di ipicills aadi
 From King Henry VII, Dante had set great hopes on which his death was destroyed
 uski samast yojanaayen ekaek samaapt ho gai kintu ganimat yahi rahi ki ve uskaa sampurna hausala post na kar sakin
 He once again moved towards spiritual balance
 yuvavastha ke vichaar or vishwaas usamen pun: jaag uthe or vah divangat biatris kii pavitribhoot aatma kii upasna kii ore or bhi dridhtaa se unmukh ho uthaa
 In many poems of 'divine Comedy', its evidence is scattered
 daante kii rachanaaon kaa yah teesraa kaal 1314 se 1321 tak, yane uski mrityu ke samay tak, mana ja saktaa he
 We can call 'the Vita Nuova' as Italy's first erotica
 isamen kavihruday kii ukt bhaawanaaon ke manovaigyanik vishleshan kii jhalak hamen dekh padati he
 How her new life started only after the first darshan of Biotris, how the woman's sense of beauty and beauty continued to get stronger in her heart, how she slowly got her hopes and love and devotion
 It became a center, at the same death, how much mental anguish and ecstasy he suffered and how his earthly love finally culminated in divine devotion and worship
 This can be seen in poetry
 biatris kii mrityu ke baad uskaa dhyaan kuch varshon ke liye ihlokik bhaawanaaon, vichaaron tathaa swaarthon kii ore gaya or vah niraashaaon athwa sanshayon ke bich hilore khaane laga
 We can see this in his second work 'conbaivs'
 in donon rachanaaon main biatris kahan or kab ek alokik saundarya kii pratimaa prathit hoti he or kahan vah maatr ek darshanik athwa dharmik drushti se kalpit divya chaaya si dekh padati he, iskaa vivechan karnaa anaavashyak he
 Suffice it to say that 'vita Nuova' is a mental elevation of the poet towards a higher sattvikta and reverence rather than an ordinary love story
 isamen andeh nahin ki aashaa niraashaaon ke vividh antardvandvon ke baavjood daante kaa hriday baar baar isi ore prayavarti hone ke liye sachesht hota jaan padataa he
 In fact, it is only from the last part of the poetry that one begins to cast a shadow on the poet's psyche, the focal world, whose center was Biatrice, and which mattered in his poetic poem called 'divine Comedy'
 daante kii laathini rachanaaon main 'de monarkia' vishesh ullekhneey he
 It shows that the need of the empire is in a way supported by God
 unamem rajya tathaa carch yaa dharmik sanstha ke pruthak pruthak kshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he or is baat par bal diya gaya he ki pope kii satta keval dharmik maamalon tak hi simit rahani chahie
 Thoughts of this intention have been expressed in many of the letters to him in the collection of Ephesians
 daante ke paksh vipaksh main kaaphi aalochanaayen hui jinke uski kirti kabhi kabhi malin ho jaati si dikhaai padati thi
 Yet there is no doubt that he was a great poet who influenced many of his later poets and litterateurs
 samay bitne par anek vidwaanon or vichaarkon ne uski bhuri bhuri prashansa kii he jisase aaj vishwa ke sahityakaron tathaa kaviyon main use yathesht unchaa sthaan dene main sahaayta milti he

 hepatitis i virus ek vishaanu he
 Kalabhairava can be related to the following: mezbaan anukulak dwaara madraboard se via one of: a hard disk drive is a data-saving device that can write and read digital information magnetically
 isamen ghoomane vaale diskes hote hai jinhen chumbakeey padaarth se lep kiya jaataa he
 The data storage device keeps the data safe even when there is no electricity
 data bhandaaran yantra se aankadon ko betaratib tareeke se padhaa jaataa he
 This means that a set of data can be secured by writing to any location in the storage device
 matlab aankadon kaa bhandaaran kisi khaas kram main karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It was invented in 1956 in a company called I
B
M
 1960 ke dashak tak aankada bhandaaran yantra sabhi saamaanya kaary ke sanganakon main sabase prachlit atirikt / sahaayak bhandaaran yantra ban gaya
 The data storage system started improving regularly and today it has kept its place stable even in the era of servers and personal computers
 200 se bhi zyaada audyogic ikaayiyon ne data bhandaaran yantra banaaye hai
 However, most data storage devices today make Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital
 sari duniya main ankada bhandaaran yantra kaa rajasav 2013 main $ 32 billian tha jo kii 2012 kii tulana main 3% kam tha
 Data storage devices are analyzed based on their storage capacity and performance
 data bhandaaran yantra kii kshamta bits main hoti hai
 The 1024 byte is called 1 kilobyte
 usee tarah se 1024 kilobite ko 1 megabite kaha jaataa he
 1024 megabytes is called 1 gigabyte and 1024 gigabytes is called 1 terabyte
 data bhandaaran yantra kaa puraa bhandaaran sthaan upyogkarta ke liye uplabdh nahin hota kyunki kuch hissaa prachaalan tantra ko rakhane or kuch or hissaa file system ke liye or kuch hissaa sambhawatah andruni atirekta galati sudhaarney or data pun:prapti ke liye hota he
 Demonstration efficiency is determined based on the time the data-write tip reaches the track and the time it takes to reach the bottom of the desired area while reading, and the speed of movement from the data device
 aaj ke data bhandaaran yantra mej par rakhe ja sakane vaale sanganakon ke liye 3
5 inch or god main rakhe ja sakane vaale sanganakon main 2
5 inch ke hote hai
 Data storage devices are connected to the main system by standard electrical conductor wires such as SATA, USB or SAS
 2014 tak data bhandaaran yantra ko atirikt yaa sahaayak bhandaaran ke kshetra main thos avasthaa vaale sanchaalak ke rup main takkar dene vaali takanic thi flash memory | aane vaale samay main yah mana ja rahaa he ki hard discs apana aadhipaty jari rakhegi lekin jahaan gati or bijli kii kam khapat zyaada zaruri hai vahaan thos avasthaa vaale upkaran ko hard discs kii jagah par istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The hard disk, ie hard disk operator, was first introduced in 1956 as a data storage device for ibm's real-time transmission processing computer
 yah saamaanya upyog, menfrem or chote computer par istemaal karne ke liye bhi viksit kiya gaya tha
 This first IBM Drive 350R Mac was as big as two refrigerators and had the capacity to hold 5 million 6 bit characters
 yah aankadon ko 50 discs ke dher par sahejataa tha
 In 1962, IBM Model 1311 brought a disk drive that was the size of a washing machine and could hold 2 million characters on a removable disk pack
 upyogkarta atirikt pack kharid sakate the or unhen zaroorat ke anusaar aapas main badal sakate the, bilkul chumbakeey tepe ke reel kii tarah
 Subsequently, disk pack drives that were created by IBM and other companies began being used in computers and by the 1980s it reached a capacity of 300 megabytes
 jin HDD ko computaron se hataaya nahin ja saktaa tha unhen "phixd discs" drive kaha jaataa hai
 Some high performance hdds were made with one nozzle per track such as IBM 2305 so that the time spent in moving the nozzle from one track to another could be saved
 inhen "phixd head" yaa "head par trek" discs drive kaha jaataa tha
 They were very expensive and are no longer made
 1973 main ai bi ium ne ek nae kism kii achdidi launch kii jisko "vincester" kuta naam diya gaya tha
 The primary thing in this was that the disc head did not completely separate from the platter when the power went out
 balki yah head discs ke ek khaas jagah main rukta tha tab jab discs kaa ghoomana band ho jaataa tha
 The disc head used to start with the same when restarted
 yah head pravartak pranali ke kharche ko kam karne main kargar sabit hua
 The first drives of Winchester technology had removable circular parts
 isamen discs pack or likhane va padhane vaali nok pranali hoti thi
 The promoter used to live in a wheel connected to the motor
 iske baad vaale "vincester" drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale discs pack ko hataa or waapas gaiyr hataane yogya discs plantres kaa istemaal hone laga
 Earlier Winchester Drives had planters with a diameter of 14 inches
 kuch saal baad is baat kii sambhaavna dhundha jane laga ki agar plantres chote hon to shaayad usase kuch or phaayde ho sakate hai
 Drives with 8-inch diameter planters followed, followed by drives with 5 1 / 4-inch diameter planters
 5 1 / 4 inch vaale drivs ko us samay main tezi se badhate hue vyaktigat computers ke bazaar ke liye roopaankit kiya gaya tha
 hdds were very expensive in the early 1980s, but by the late 1980s, their prices had reduced to such an extent that they were also used in the cheapest computers
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main zyaadaatar HDD vyaktigat computer upyogkarta ko alag se up pranali ke taur par bechaa jaataa tha
 This subsystem was sold not in the name of the drive manufacturer but in the name of the subsystem manufacturer such as Corvus Systems, Tallgrass Technologies either in the name of the manufacturer such as Apple Profile
 ai0bi0ium0 pisi / eks tii jo ai bi ium ne 1983 main launch kiya tha, main ek 10 megabite kaa andruni achdidi tha or iske baad se hi vyaktigat computers main andruni achdidi niyamit taur se istemaal hone lage
 External hdds have been used for a long time on Apple Macintosh
 1986 se 1998 ke bich bahari achdidi ko jodne ke liye harek macintosh computer main peeche ke taraf ek es si es ai port hua karata tha
 The 2011 floods in Thailand damaged many data storage plant-producing plants, causing data storage plant prices to rise between 2012-2013
 achdidi ke avishkaar ke baad nirantar tareeke se unki hawaii ghanatv main izaafaa hota rahaa he
 The data storage device consists of a thin film of ferromagnetic material which attracts the data storage device to save the data
 krambaddh tareeke se chumbakeey kshetra ke disha kaa badlaav binary data bits ko darshata he
 The change of magnetization is checked and the data is read from the disk / device
 ek kuta lekhan vidhi istemaal karke data ko sankethik shabdon main badla jaataa he
 Such as run length limited code writing method
 jo data ko chumbakeey disha ke parivartan ke anusaar prastut karata hai
 An HDD has spindles that hold a flat round disk
 plantres saadharantah gaiyr chumbakeey padaarth jaise aluminium elaay, sheesha yaa ceremic se bane hote he
 These planters are coated with magnetic material which holds the data
 is chumbakeey padaarth ke parat kii motaai 10 se 20 nanometer hoti hai or uski suraksha ke liye uske upar carbon kii ek parat bhi hoti hai
 The layer of this magnetic material is less than the thickness of the paper, which is 7 xxrep 4 0 to 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometers
 aajkal ke hard discs ke plantres ko alag alag raftaar main ghumaya jaataa hai yah vahneey yantro main 4200 ghumaav prati minutese lekar ucch pradarshan kshamta vaale sarwar main 15000 arpm tak hoti hai
 The first HDD rotated at a speed of 1200 rpm and for many years the entire HDD rotated at 3600 rpm
 disambar 2013 tak zyaadaatar upabhokataa shrenee ke achdidi 5400 arpm yaa 7200 ghumaav prati minute kii raftaar main ghoomte hai
 The information is read or written on the plotter as the platter rotates under the reed-right head
 read - rhite head or plater main duuri bahut kam hoti hai bas kuch nanometer
 Reed - Right head works to read and replace the magnetic material under it
 aadhunik achdidi main har chumbakeey plater ke upar ek read - rhite head hota hai jo kii ek samaan bhujaa se judaa hua hota hai
 a moving arm moves the head in the direction of a circle while the disc rotates so that each head reaches the entire surface of the platter
 is bhujaa ko hilaane ke liye vaayas quayal eccuater yaa kuch puraane dizine main stepper motor istemaal kiya jaataa hai
 The magnetic plate on the drive is fitted with optical insulation
 pehle ke hard discs drivs main sthir / ek hi bits par second ke tareeke se likhaa jaataa tha isliye har patari par data saamaan hota tha
 But in modern disk drives, zone bit recording is used, in which the speed of writing keeps on going from the inside to the outside track / track, it can preserve more data in the outside tracks
 aadhunik upkarnon main chumbakeey kshetra ke chote sies ke kaaran is baat kii sambhaavna hai kii vah apni chumbakeey stithi garmi ke kaaran kho saktaa hai
 This magnetic instability caused by heat is also called the "superparamagnetic limit"
 is stithi se bachane ke liye plantres ko do samanaantar chumbakeey parato se lep kiya jaataa hai inke bich ek 3 anu motaai kaa ek gairchumbakeey parat rahata hai
 Both layers have magnetic effects in the opposite direction, thus reinforcing each other
 garmi ke prabhaav se nipatane ke liye ek or takanic istemaal hoti hai iskaa naam parpendicular recording hai
 It also gives more recording density, it was first shipped in 2005
 Today many hdds are using this technology
 ek saadhaaran HDD main do vidyutiya motor hote hai
 a spindle-mounted motor that rotates the disc and an actuator motor that moves the reed / right head system over the rotating disc
 chakrika se jude hue motor main ek bahari roter hota hai jo chakrika ke saath judaa hota hai, vidyut chaalak sthaayee ghumaavdaar taar ]ek jagah sthapit hoti hai
 There is a reed-write head on the end of the rod connected to the spindle opposite the promoter
 yah likhane / padhane vaali nok bahut patale vidyutiya paripath se emplifaire electronics ke saath judaa hota hai jo pravartak ke kendra bindu par sthit hota hai
 The supporting arm of the tip is very light and solid in weight
 aadhunik upkarnon main isaki tej hone kii gati 550 g tak ho sakati hai
 The actuator is a permanent magnet
 usame ek ghoomanevaala qoil hota hai jo sahi jagah par likhane / padhane vaali nok ko chalaata hai
 a plate of metal holds a squat neodiminum-iron-borone high-speed magnet
 is thali ke neeche ek ghoomanevaala dhaatu kaa lachha hota hai jise awaz vaali qoil bhi kehete hai
 It is connected to the center of the coil promoter and below this coil is a neodiminum-iron-boron magnet
 ise motor ke ekadam nichle thali par chadha kar rakhaa jaataa hai
 The voiced quail is shaped like the tip of an arrow and is made of 2 times coated copper wire
 andar kii sataha taap rodhan ke liye hoti hai or baahar kii sataha garm plastic kii hoti hai
 The coils on either side of the tip are attached to the magnetic field
 jab vidyut pravaah ek dhaatu ke lachchhe ke andar ke disha main gaman karti hai or duusare lachchhe ke bahari disha main gaman karti hai tab ek sparsh-rekhiy dabaav utpann hota hai jo pravartak ko ghumata hai
 The electronics of the HDD control the movement of the promoter and also control the rotation or circular movement of the disc
 vah chakrika niyantrak ke nirdesho ke anusaar chakrika se soochna padhane yaa likhane kaa kaam bhi karti hai
 The feedback from the drive electronics comes from specific parts of the disc that are dedicated to servo feedback
 yah yaa to phir puri tarah se sankendrit parimandal hote hai yaa wo hisse jisame asli aankaden bikhare hue rup me hote hai
 a data storage device or hard disk operator has one or more fast rotating discs and magnetic nozzles
 inhe ek chalate hue pravartak bhujaa ke upar rakhaa jaataa hai taaki is nok kii sahaayta se chakrika ke sataha par aankadon ko likhaa yaa padhaa ja sake
 The time it takes to move the magnetic tip to the cylinder or track, along with the time it takes to rotate part of the disc under the tip and how much data is being transmitted at every moment, on the basis of these data storage device is determined Goes
 aadhunik data bhandaran yantra truti sanshodhan kuta kaa bahut istemaal karti hai khaskar read - solman truti nivaaran kuta
 This technique saves extra bits
 har data khand main kuch atirikt bits hote hai jo kuch ganit ke sutara istemaal kar galatiyon ko adrishy tareeke se sudhaarte hai
 These extra bits do take up some space in the data storage device, but it also makes it possible to have a higher write density on the data storage device, which also makes it possible to correct the errors that occur in the process
 iskaa fal yah hota hai kii data bhandaran yantra kii bhandaaran kshamta zyaada hoti hai
 For example, a 1 TB capacity data storage device with 512 byte segments gets 93 GB additional data storage capacity
 ekadam nae data bhandaran yantra main laghu ghanatv samta jaanch kuta read-solman kii jagah lene lage hai
 L
 With the DPC code, the performances reach close to the Shannon border

 The simplest solution to this is that the wide and 6-6 m long sections equal to the width of the entire tunnel should be left open with a gap of about 150-150 m, so that sunlight and open air can reach inside

 Sometimes artificial ventilation is required even in relatively small tunnels

 If an engine is running fast in the tunnel, then with its speed, smoke will be drawn inside
 isliye jagah-jagah par sanvati coopak banane padate hai
 When steam locomotives run than electric motors, ventilation is more needed
 prakritik sanvathan kaa aadhaar sanvati coopak ke bheetar kii hawa ke or dharaatal par baahar kii hawa ke taapmaana kaa antar he
 In the winter, the air in the follicle falls upwards and in the summer it descends downwards
 vasant or sharad rituon main coopak ke bheetar or baahar taapmaana kaa antar nahin ke baraabar hota he, isliye sanvathan nahin ho paata
 The principle of mechanical ventilation is that as far as possible, dirty air should be released from the center of the tunnel by a fan with a fan on its mouth
 marasi nadi ke neeche se jane vaali surang main yah sambhav na tha, kyonki upar pani bharaa tha
 Therefore a convective tunnel is built from above, which opens on the banks of the river and joins the main tunnel in the middle to its lowest part

 The term Shओova was the name of the period of his reign, which was made his own name after his death
 danta ksharan, jise danta-asthikshay yaa chhidr bhi kaha jaataa he, ek beemaari he jisamen jeevanvik prakriyaayein daant kii sakht sanrachana ko kshatigrast kar detii hai
 These tissues progressively break down, causing tooth decay
 dant-kshay do jeevanuon ke kaaran prarambh hota he: stryptococas mutans or lactobacilas 
 yadi iskaa ilaaj na kiya gaya to, is beemaari ke parinamswaroop dard, daanton kii haani, sankraman or charam sthitiyon main mrityu tak ho sakati he
 Currently, dental caries remains the most common disease throughout the world
 danta-kshay ke adhyayan ko kshay-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The presentation of caries may vary; However, risk factors and stages of development are similar
 prarambh main yah ek chote khadiamay kshetra ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he, jo antat ek bade chhidr ke rup main viksit ho jaataa he
 Occasionally, caries can be seen directly, although other methods of detection, such as radiographs, are used for less visible parts of the teeth and to assess the extent of damage
 dant-kshay amla-utpann karne vaale ek vishisht prakaar ke jeevanuon ke kaaran hota he, jo ki kinvan-yogya carbohydrates, jaise sukroj, fructose or glucose kii upasthiti main daanton ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 The mineral content of teeth is sensitive to the increase in acidity caused by lactic acid
 vishisht rup se, ek daant main daant va laar ke bich akhnijikaran or punarkhnijikaran kii ek satat prakriya chalati rahati he
 When the ph on the tooth surface drops below 5
5, demineralization occurs more rapidly than remineralization
 iske parinamswaroop daant kaa ksharan hota he
 Depending on the extent of tooth erosion, various treatments can be performed to bring the tooth back to the proper shape, function and beauty, but no known method is available to recover a large amount of tooth structure, although the stem -sell related research points to one such method
 iske bajaay, danta swasthya sanghathan danta kshay se bachaav ke liye niyamit maukhik swatchta or aahaar main parivartan jaise nivarak or roganirodhak upayon kaa samarthan karte hai
 Dental caries can be classified on the basis of location, etiology, rate of growth, and hard tissue affected
 in vargikarnon kaa prayog danta-kshay ke kisi vishisht maamle kaa vivaran dene ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, taaki anya logon ko sthiti kii jaankaree adhik achookta ke saath di ja sake or saath hi daant ke ksharan kii gambhirtha kii ore suchit bhi kiya ja sake
 There are generally two types of damage when classified on the basis of condition: smooth surface damage and pits and cracks
 The location, growth, and range of damage on smooth surfaces is different from damage in pits and crevices
 ji
 ve
 blake ne ek vargeekaran pranali viksit kii, jiskaa prayog vyapak paimaane par kiya jaataa he or jo daant main ho rahe kshay kii sthiti par aadhaarit he
 In the original classification, dental caries were grouped into five groups, denoted by the word "range" and a Roman numeral
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale kshay ko shrenee i ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he; chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati ko aage shrenee II, shrenee III, shrenee IV va shrenee v main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a category VI was also added to Blake's classification of dental caries and also represents damage on smooth surfaces
 gadde va daraaren daant par sthit sanrachanaatmak chihn hai, jahaan se dantabalk bheetar kii ore mudata he
 The cracks are formed during the development of the grooves, but the enamel at that location is not fully connected
 iske parinamswaroop, dantabalk kii sataha kii sanrachana par ek gaharaa rekhiy gaddha ban jaataa he, jo danta-kshay ko viksit hone va panpane ke liye ek sthaan pradaan karata he
 The cracks are mostly located on the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth and on the palatal surface of the anterior teeth located on the lath
 gadde chote, sui kii nok ke aakaar ke chhidr hote hai, jo adhikanshtah khaanchon ke chor yaa anuprastha bhaag par paae jate hai
 Typically, cupola pits are found on the outer surfaces of molars
 sabhi prakaar ke gaddhon va daraaron ke liye atyadhik gaharaai tak muda hua dantabalk in satahon par maukhik swasthya kaa dhyaan rakh paanaa kathin bana detaa he, jiske kaaran in kshetron main danta-kshati viksit hona adhik aam he
 The occlusal layer of teeth constitutes 12
5% of the total tooth layer, but more than 50% of the total dental damage is found on them
 kul danta-kshayon kaa 90% bacchon ke daanton ke gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshatiyaan hoti hai
 It can sometimes be difficult to identify erosion in pits and crevices
 jaise-jaise ksharan main vruddhi hoti jaati he, daant kii sataha ke sabase paas sthit dantabalk kaa kshay kramshah gaharaai main failane lagata he
 Once this caries reaches the dentin of the dentin and enamel, the erosion spreads laterally
 dant-utak ke bheetar, yah ksharan ek tribhuj pattern kaa paalan karata he, jisaki disha daant ke goode kii ore hoti he
 This pattern of corrosion is uniquely described by two triangles whose bases are connected to each other on the DEJ
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke vipareet aadhaar-se-aadhaar kaa yah pattern ek gadde va daraar ke ksharan kaa vishisht pattern he
 There are three types of erosion that occur on a smooth surface
 samipsth ksharan, jise antahsamipsth ksharan bhi kaha jaataa he, samipsth daanton ke bich kii chikani sataha par hota he
 Basic caries occurs on the root surfaces of teeth
 chikani sataha par hone vaala tisare prakaar kaa ksharan daant kii kisi bhi anya chikani sataha par hota he
 Proximal caries are the most difficult to identify
 aksar is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan keval dekhakar yaa danta anveshak ke dwaara maanviya rup se nahin kii ja sakati
 samipsth ksharan do daanton ke sampark-sthal ke thik neeche grav rup se nirmit hota he
 As a result, a radiograph is required to identify proximal caries at an early stage
 blake kii vargeekaran pranali main, pichley daanton par utpann samipsth ksharan shrenee II ke ksharan kehalaate hai
 Proximal caries on the front teeth, if not involving the rodent end, is placed in category III and if the rodent end is involved, it is placed in category IV
 mul ksharan, jinka varnan kabhi-kabhi chikani-sataha vaale ksharan ke ek prakaar ke rup main kiya jaataa he, ksharan kaa teesraa sabase aam prakaar hai or ye saamanytah tab utpann hote hai, jab mul satahen masoodon main ghataav ke kaaran ujagar ho gayi hon
 yadi masoode swasth hon, to mul ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin hoti kyonki jeevanvik plak mul satahon tak nahin pahunch saktaa
 dantabalk kii tulana main mul satahen akhanijeekaran prakriya ke prati adhik asurakshit hoti hai kyonki dant-mul 6
7 piech par akhanijeekrut hona prarambh karata he, jo ki dantabalk ke najuk piech se ucch he
 Despite this, it is easier to prevent the development of root caries than enamel erosion because reabsorption of fluoride is greater in the original than enamel
 antahsamipsth satahon kii tulana main, jiheey satahon kii tulana main jihviy satahon par mul ksharan hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 The jaw teeth on the jaw are the most common place of original caries, followed by the jaw on the jaw, the forearm on the jaw, the posterior position on the jaw and the teeth on the jaw
 daanton kii chikani satahon par chot lag janaa bhi sambhav he
 Since they occur in all areas of the smooth surface except for interconnected areas, it is easy to identify this type of corrosion and is associated with food that encourages plaque and caries formation
 blake ke vargeekaran ke antargat, ananmukheey athwa jiheey satahon ke paas sthit masoodon par hone vaale ksharan ko shrenee v ke rup main chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Category VI is reserved for the ends of the posterior teeth and the rodent ends of the anterior teeth
 purv varnit do shreniyon ke alaava, ksharangrast chot ko ek daant kii kisi vishisht sataha par unki sthiti ke dwaara bhi varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The erosion that occurs on the surface of the teeth closest to the cheeks or lips is called "caries erosion" and the surface erosion on the side of the tongue is called gingival erosion
 ananmukh ksharan ko aage kapol or oshthak kaha jaataa he
 Obstructive caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the posterior teeth
 krintak ksharan agrastha daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Erosions can also be described as "moderate" or "remote"
 madhyam ksharan daanton par kisi aise sthaan se sambandhit hote hai, jo chehre kii madhya-rekha ke nikat ho, jo ki ankhon ke bich se neeche naak kii ore or madhya krintakon ke sampark ke bich kii urdhv dhuree par sthit hoti he
 The position of the teeth distal to the midline is described as distal
 kuch udaahranon main, kshayon kaa varnan kisi anya prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jo iske kaaran kii ore suchit karata ho
 "baby bottle erosion", "early childhood caries" or "baby bottle tooth erosion" is a pattern found in young children with temporary teeth
 isamen jabadon ke agr-bhaag par sthit daanton par sabase zyada prabhaav padane kii sambhaavna hoti he, lekin sabhi daant prabhavit ho sakate hai
 This type of caries gets its name based on the fact that this caries usually occurs as a result of allowing infants to sleep with the sweet liquids stored in their bottles, or to feed infants several times a day
 ksharan kaa ek anya pattern “atyadhik failanevaala ksharan " he, jo anek daanton kii kai satahon par hone vaale unnat yaa atyadhik ksharan ko suchit karata he
 Excessive spreading erosion can be seen in people suffering from dry mouth disease, disregard for mouth health, use of stimulants and / or consuming sugar too much
 yadi atyadhik failanevaala ksharan sir va gardan par purvavarti vikiran ke kaaran ho, to iskaa varnan vikiran-prabhavit ksharan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 These problems can occur due to autoimmune of the original and when new teeth are growing, reconstruction of the entire tooth or later for unknown reasons
 dow miller ne 1887 main kaha ki "danta-ksharan ek rasinic-paraseete prakriya he, jisamen do charan hote hai-dantabalk kaa akhatikaran, jiske parinamswaroop purna vinaash hota he, tathaa praathmik charan ke rup main dant-utak kaa akhatikaran, jiske baad mulaayam ho chukaa avshisht kaa vilyan hota he
 "in his hypothesis, Dr
 Miller assigned the necessary roles to three factors: ksharanon kii pragati kii dar va pichley itihaas kii ore suchit karne ke liye un par asthaayee vivaran lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 "acute" refers to a rapidly developing condition, while "long-term" describes a condition that has taken too long to develop, including thousands of bars of food and breakfast, of which Many cause some acid demineralization, which is not re-mineralized, eventually resulting in pores
 fluoride upachaar daant ke dantabalk punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Recurring caries, also known as secondary caries, are caries that occur at a location that has a long history of erosion
 aksar yah bharaai or anya danta prayaavartanon par paaya jaataa he
 Early erosion, on the other hand, is used to describe a decay at a place that has not experienced any decay before
 roka gaya ksharan kisi aise daant par ek chot kaa varnan karata he, jo pehle akhanijeekrut ho gaya ho, lekin jise koi chhidr utapann hone se pehle hi punarkhanijeekrut kar liya gaya ho
 Using fluoride treatment can be helpful in recalibration
 prabhavit hone vaale utakon ke aadhaar par, ksharanon kaa varnan dantabalk, dant-utak yaa dant-mul rakhane vaale ksharanon ke rup main kiya janaa sambhav he
 At the beginning of its development, caries is only possible to affect enamel
 ek baar jab kshay kaa vistaar dant-utak kii gahari parat tak pahunch jaataa he, to “dant-utak ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since cementum is a hard tissue covering the roots of teeth, it is generally not affected by caries until the roots of the tooth are exposed in the mouth
 Although the term "dental caries" can be used to describe caries at the roots of teeth, in very rare situations this erosion only affects the tooth root
 jadon main dant-utak kii ek badi parat ke upar cementem kii ek bahut patali parat hoti he or is prakaar dant-mul ko prabhavit karne vaale adhikansh ksharan dant-utak ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 It is possible that a person experiencing erosion may not be aware of it
 ek nae ksharangrast ghaav kaa sabase pehla sanket daant kii sataha par ek khadiamay safed dhabbe ke rup main miltaa he, jo is baat kii ore suchit karata he ki us kshetra main dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran ho rahaa he
 This is called initial decay
 jab ghaav kaa akhanijeekaran jari rahata he, to yah bhure rang main badal saktaa he, lekin antat yah ek kotkh main badal jayega
 chhidr kaa nirmaan hone se pehle, yah prakriya prativerti hoti he, lekin ek baar chhidr kaa nirmaan ho jane par, daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana ko punarutpann nahin kiya ja saktaa
 koi aisa ghaav jo bhure rang or chamkila kaa dikhaai detaa ho, yah darshata he ki kisi samay danta ksharan maujuud the, lekin akhanijeekaran kii prakriya ruk gai he or keval ek daag rah gaya he
 a brownish stain that appears to be dull is probably a sign of active corrosion
 jab dantabalk or dant-utak nasht ho jate hai, to yah chhidr lakshaneey ho jaataa he
 The affected areas of the tooth change their color and feel soft on touching
 ek baar jab kshay dantabalk se hokar guzar jaataa he, to daanton kii nalikaayen, jinamein daant kii nason tak jane kaa maarg hota he, ujagar ho jaati hai, jisase daant main dard hone lagata he
 This pain may increase further when exposed to hot, cold or sweet food and drinks
 danta-kshay ke kaaran saanson main badboo or vikrut swaad jaisi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 In highly developed conditions, tooth infection can also spread to the surrounding soft tissue
 guhamay vivar dhanasrata or ludbig kaa kanthshul jaisi jatiltaaon se jivan ke liye khatra bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 Four main parameters are required for the formation of an erosion: the tooth surface; Caries-causing bacteria; Fermentable carbohydrates; and time
 The caries process has no inevitable consequence and different individuals are sensitive to different categories based on the size of their teeth, oral health habits, and their salivary resistance
 danta ksharan daant kii kisi bhi aisi sataha par ho saktaa he, jo ki munh ke chhidr main ujagar ho rahi ho, lekin yah asthi ke bheetar bachaa lee gai sanrachana par nahin ho saktaa
 There are some specific diseases and deformities affecting the teeth, due to which the risk of erosion can increase in a person
 amelogenesis imperfecta, jo 718 main se 1 or 14,000 main se ek vyakti ke bich hota he, ek aisa rog he, jisamen dantabalk yaa to puri tarah nirmit hi nahin hota yaa aparyaapt maatra main nirmit hota he or daanton se gir saktaa he
 In both cases, the risk of tooth decay may increase because enamel is not able to protect the tooth
 adhikansh vyaktiyon main, danta ksharan kaa praathmik kaaran daanton ko prabhavit karanevaali vikrutiyaan yaa bimaariyaan nahin hotin
 daant ke dantabalk kaa chhiyanbe pratishat bhaag khanijon se milakar bana hota he
 These minerals, especially hydroxyapatite, will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments
 Demineralization of enamel begins at a ph of 5
5
 dantabalk kii tulana main dant-utak va dant-mul main ksharan kaa khatra adhik hota he kyonki unamem khanij kii maatra kam hoti he
 Thus, caries can develop quickly when the root surfaces of a tooth are encountered with gums or other diseases associated with the gums
 haalanki, ek swasth maukhik vaataavaran main bhi daant main danta-ksharan hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 The structure of teeth can affect the likelihood of caries formation
 jahaan daanton ke gahare khaanche adhik sankhya main tathaa atiranjit hote hai, vahaan gaddhon va daraaron ke vikaas kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Also, if food particles are buried between the teeth, the chances of corrosion increase
 hamaare munh main anek prakaar ke maukhik jeevanu paye jate hai, lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki un jeevanuon kii keval kuch vishisht prajatiyaan hi dant-kshay ke liye uttaradaayi hoti hai, jinamein strepstococas mutans or lactobacili shaamil hai
 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp
 And Streptococcus mutans have a close association with dental caries, especially dental caries
 daaton or masoodon ke aas-paas jeevanu ek chipchipe, malai-jaise rang ke padaarth main jamaa ho jate hai, jise plak kaha jaataa he, jo ek jaev-aavaran ke rup main kaary karata he
 Plaque aggregation at some specific locations is more common than at other locations
 daaton ke bich sampark bindu kii hi tarah charvnak or agracharvanak daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paae jane vaale khaanche bhi sookshmdarsheey avarodhan pradaan karte hai
 Plaque may also collect on the gums
 kisi vyakti ke munh main upasthit jeevanu glucose, fructose or sabase aam taur par sukroj ko kinvan naamak ek glicolitic prakriya ke dwaara lactic amla aadi jaise amlon main parivartit kar dete hai
 If these acids are left in contact with the tooth, they can cause demineralization, which is the process of dissolution of minerals
 haalanki yah prakriya gatij hoti he kyonki yadi laar yaa mouthwash ke dwaara is amla ko niskriy kar diya jaae, to punarkhanijeekaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish can be helpful in remineralization
 yadi akhanijeekaran lambey samay tak jari rahata he, to itani badi maatra main khanij-saamagree kii haani ho sakati he ki shesh rah gaya narm jaev padaarth vighatit ho jaataa he, jisase ek kotor yaa chhidr ban jaataa he
 The effect exerted by such sugars on the development of dental caries is called caries
 yadhyapi sharkara ek baddh glucose va fructose ikai hoti he, lekin vastav main yah glucose or fructose kii samaan maatra ke mishran kii tulana main adhik ksharankari hoti he
 This is because bacteria derive energy from the bond between the glucose and fructose subunits
 enzim dextransukraanez dwaara sukroj ko dexran policecride naamak ek atyadhik chipchipe padaarth main roopantarit karke es
 mutans daant par sthiti jaev-parat se chipka rahata he
 The potential for caries development is also affected by the frequency at which teeth are exposed to caries environments
 bhojan athwa naashte ke baad, munh main upasthit jeevanu sharkara kaa chayapachay karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop piech ko ghataane vaale ek amleey-upotpaada kaa nirmaan hota he
 Over time, ph returns to normal due to the salivary resistance and the dissolved mineral content of the tooth surface
 amleey vaataavaran ke saath hone vaale prayek sampark ke dauraan, daanton kii sataha par upasthit gaiyr-jaivik padaarth kaa kuch bhaag vighatit ho jaataa he or yah do ghanton tak vighatit bana rah saktaa he
 Since there is a risk of tooth erosion during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries is highly dependent on the frequency of acidic contact
 yadi bhojan main upyukt carbohydrate kii paryaapt maatra ho, to yah ksharan prakriya munh main daant ke ugane ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar prarambh ho sakati he
 Evidence suggests that fluoride treatments slow down this process
 samipsth ksharan ko kisi sthaayee daant ke dantabalk se hokar guzarane main ausatan chaar varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since the enamel covering the original surface is not as durable as the enamel covering the original head, the original erosion generally increases faster than caries on other surfaces
 mul ksharan par hone vaala yah vikaas or khanijeekaran kii haani dantabalk par hone vaale ksharan kii tulana main 2
5 guna adhik tej hoti he
 In very severe cases, in which oral health is very poor and the amount of fermentable carbohydrate in the food is high, erosion can occur within a few months of tooth eruption due to erosion
 udaahranarth, yadi bachche lagaataar shishu botalon se sharkarayukta peya kaa seven karte hon, to aisa ho saktaa he
 There is a correlation between a decrease in saliva and an increase in corrosion because the immunity of saliva is not present to balance the acidic environment created by certain foods
 As a result, the medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by the salivary glands, especially the jaw subsystem and the parotid gland, are likely to cause extensive dental caries
 iske udaahranon main szograine syndrome, diabetes melitas, diabetes insipids tathaa sarcidosis shaamil hai
 Antihistamines and antidepressants can also block salivary flow
 utprerak, sarvaadhik kukhyat rup se methilamphetamine, bhi laar ke pravaah ko bahut adhik avaruddh kar dete hai
 The tendency of bad oral health is found in those who abuse the catalysts
 bhaang ke paudhe main paaya jane vaala sakriy rasinic padaarth, tetrahydrokaenabinol, bhi laar ke pravaah ko lagbhag puri tarah roak detaa he or is sthiti ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main “coton mouth " kehete hai
 Together with the excessive intake of sugary drinks and unrefined foods, it greatly increases the extent of caries in the users of cannabis
 iske atirikt, sanyukt rajya america main sabase aamtaur par di jane vaali dawaaon main se tirasth pratishat main inke gyaat dushprabhavon kii suchi main munh ke sookhne kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Radiation treatment of the head and neck can also affect cells located in the salivary gland, increasing the likelihood of caries formation
 tambaakoo kaa prayog kii ksharan ke nirmaan ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 Some brands of smokeless tobacco have high sugar levels, increasing the chance of caries
 tambaakoo kaa prayog daanton se sambandhit un bimariyon ke liye ek mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak hota he, jo masoode ko peeche dhakel detii hai
 When the gingiva is attached to the teeth, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth
 yadi aisa hota he, to mul ksharan ek chintajanak baat hoti he kyonki daanton ko dhankane vaale dant-mul ko amlon dwaara dantabalk kii tulana main adhik saralata ke saath akhanijeekrut kar diya jaataa he
 Currently, there is not enough evidence to support an informal relationship between smoking and spinal caries, but these evidence do point to an association between smoking and root-surface caries
 antargarbhashayi or navjaat shishuon main sise kaa sampark danta kshay ko protsaahit karata he
 In addition to lead, electric charge and all molecules with the same ionic radius of divalent calcium, such as cadmium, mimic calcium ions, and therefore contact with them increases tooth decay
 dantabalk atyadhik khanijeekrut akoshikeey utak hota he or ksharan jeevanuon dwaara prarambh kii jane vaali ek rasinic prakriya ke dwaara ise haani pahunchaate hai
 When these bacteria start consuming sugars and use it for their own energy, then they produce lactic acid
 is prakriya ke prabhaavon main dantabalk main upasthit kanon kaa akhanijeekaran shaamil he, jo ki samay ke bitne ke saath-saath amlon ke kaaran hota he or tab tak jari rahata he, jab tak ki jeevanu shaareerik rup se dant-utak ko bhed na len
 dantabalk kii chaden, jo ki dantabalk kii sanrachana kii moolbhoot ikaiyaan hoti hai, daant kii sataha se dant-utak tak lambavat sthit hoti hai
 Since demineralization of enamel through erosion usually occurs in the direction of enamel rods, different triangular patterns and smooth-surfaced caries develop between the pits and pores in enamel that two areas of tooth enamel rods The situation varies
 jab dantabalk apane khanijon ko kho detaa he or danta ksharan kaa vikaas hone lagata he, to dantabalk main anek spasht kshetra viksit ho jate hai, jinhen ek prakaash sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dekha ja saktaa he
 From the deepest layer of enamel to the enamel surface, the areas identified are: translucent area, black area, body of wound, and surface area
 parbhasi kshetra ksharan kaa pehla drishy sanket hota he or yah khanijon kii ek se do pratishat haani hone par banataa he
 There is little remineralization of enamel in the black zone, which provides an example of how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes
 sarvaadhik akhanijeekaran va vinaash kaa kshetra swatah ghaav kaa mukhya bhaag hi hota he
 The surface area remains relatively mineral-rich and remains present until the tooth structure changes to a pore
 dantabalk ke vipareet, dant-utak danta kshay kii pragati ke prati pratikriya detaa he
 After the creation of the tooth, the aminoblasts that produce enamel are destroyed when the enamel is completed and therefore they cannot be reconstructed after enamel is destroyed
 On the other hand, dentin is produced by the odontoblast throughout its lifespan, which lies between the pulp and dentin
 chunki, odontoblast upasthit hote hai, atah ek utprerak, jaise ksharan, ek jaivik pratikriya ko prarambh kar saktaa he
 These safety procedures include the formation of whiteboard and tertiary dentin
 sabase gahari parat se dantabalk tak sthit dant-utak main, ksharan dwaara prabhavit hone vaale kshetra parbhasi kshetra, vinaash kaa kshetra tathaa jeevanivik chhedan kaa kshetra hai
 The translucent zone represents a moving list of damage processes and is located where the initial demineralization begins
 jeevanvik chhedan tathaa vinaash ke kshetra akramanakari jeevanuon tathaa antat dant-utak ke vighatan ke kshetra hai
 The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic currents, called dentinal tubules, that protrude from the pulp part toward the outer dentin or enamel border
 dant-utak nalikaaon kaa vyas goode ke paas adhik or dant-utak va dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthaan par sabase kam hota he
 The damage process continues throughout the dentin tubules, which are responsible for the triangular pattern resulting from the development of caries deep into the tooth
 nalikaayen ksharanon ko bhi tezi se viksit hone kaa mauka detii hai
 In response, the fluid present in the tubes brings immunoglobulin from our immune system to fight this bacterial infection
 isi samay, aas-paas kii nalikaaon ke khanijeekaran main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he
 This results in the formation of tubules, an attempt to reduce the rate of bacterial progression
 iske atirikt, jab jeevanuon kaa amla hydroxipetic kanon kaa akhanijeekaran karata he, to calcium va phosphorus chode jate hai, jisase adhik sankhya main kanon ke avakshepan kaa mauka miltaa he, jo dant-utak nalikaaon main gahare tak samaa jate hai
 These particles form a barrier and slow the expansion of corrosion
 in rakshaatmak pratikriyaaon ke baad, dant-utak ko shwetapatli mana jaataa he
 It is believed that due to the fluids present inside the tubules of dentin, the pain receptors located inside the tooth pulp become active
 chunki shwetapatli dant-utak aise dravon ke pravaah ko roktaa he, atah sambhav he ki jis dard ne jeevanuon ke akraman kii chetavanee di hoti, vah pehle pahal utpann hi na ho
 As a result, dental caries may continue to progress for a long time without any sensitivity to the tooth, which can lead to great loss of tooth structure
 danta kshay kii pratikriyaswaroop, goode kii disha main or adhik dant-utak kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin
 tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan aage bad rahe jeevanuon se goode kii yathasambhav raksha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 When more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases
 is prakaar ke dant-utak ko mul odontoblast kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ke anusaar up-vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 If odontoblasts survive for so long that they can respond to dental caries, the dentin produced in this condition is called "reactive" dentin
