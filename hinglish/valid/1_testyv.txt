 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean

 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalasic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia

 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava
 Happens in the case
 namoona samoohon ke bich chumbakeey bhinnataayen jinaki umr main lakhon varshon kaa antar hota he, ek vaastavik dhruviya vichlan or mahadwipon kii halchal ke sanyukt kaaran aisa hota he
 The components of the true polarity deviation are the same for all samples and can be eliminated
 yah bhuvaigyanikon ko is bahaav kaa ek hissaa de detaa he jo mahadwipiya halchal ko dikhaata he or iskaa upyog pehle kii mahadwipiya sthitiyon ko punarnirdhaarit karne main madad ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea

 It is a well-known ghat of Kashi
 Hindus consider it to be absolutely sacred
 It was here that Brahma performed the rituals of Dashashwamedh Yagyas
 It is said that the famous Devdas of Kashi drove the gods from this place
 Then both Mahadev and Parvati took shelter of Mandarachal
 To defeat Devdas, he called Brahma and consulted among themselves and thought of a solution
 Considering that the devotion of Devkarya would be guilty, Devdas would have to be criminals, climbed the Brahma Swan and reached Kashidham and took a seat on this ghat, asking Devdas to seek the contents of the Ashwamedh Yagyas
 Devdas sent all the materials
 Then Brahma completed those yagyas in this ghat, seeing no error of his
 Since then this ghat has attained extraordinary purity

 The topic related to the green economy before the Green Economy +20 has attracted widespread attention
 vikasshil deshon kaa maananaa he ki rio siddhanton dwaara paribhaashit satat vikaas or isaki teen aadharshilaon namat: aarthik, saamaajik tathaa paryaavarniya ke aadhaar par vaishvik vikaas maarg ko paribhaashit karne kii prakriya jari rahani chahie
 In their understanding, the green economy has been associated with this broad framework and action on green development can be achieved only when the developing countries are provided with an enabling mechanism supporting finance, technology and capacity building
 aage unka maananaa he ki ek ruparekha ke rup main 'harith arthvyavastha' tabhi safal hogi jab isse garibi unmoolan kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kii kshamtaaon kaa unnayan ho, rashtriya paristhitiyon evam praathamiktaaon ke liye nitigat upaay kiye jaaen or yah sunishchit kiya jaae ki iske parinamswaroop aae dhanchaagat badlaavon se harith sangrakshanvaad evam avaanchhneeya sharton ko badhaava na mili
 India's vision of a green economy is essentially related to immediate priorities like poverty alleviation, food security, employment generation up to modern energy services
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki 'harith arthvyavastha' ek gatisheel vichaardhaara he, jiskaa uddeshy nirantarata ke saath garibi unmoolan kii disha main kaaryakalapon ko badhaava dena at: aarthik, saamaajik evam paryaavarniya vikaas ke kram main arthvyavastha ko harith swaroop pradaan karnaa he
 India believes that the 'green economy' must first focus on the principle of common but common and different responsibilities before any understanding
 rio+20 ko yah satat vikaas ko vaishvik vikaas kaarysoochee ke kendra main laane kaa avasar bhi maanata he
 Under the ideology of the green economy, various capacities of different countries should also be taken into consideration
 harith model ko opchaarik rup dene kii jaldbaaji main vikaas ke ek aise nae antarrashtriya mandand kii ruparekha ban sakati he, jisase shaayad anya prakaar ke vikaas model avaidh ho jaaen
 It may also include the model of development which many countries like India have followed for their socio-economic development and poverty alleviation
 jaisaa ki pradhanmantri shrimati indira gandhi ne 1972 main stokhome main kaha tha, garibi sabase bada pradooshak he
 Some have also said that changing the paradigm that underlines the advocacy of green models can also be an effort to sustain the economic benefits of developed countries over emerging economies, which in many areas today match the developed countries
 Are trying kshamta evam vikaas anivaarytaaon ke anuroop prayek desh ke liye satat vikaas ke moolbhoot lakshya se sambandhit katipay lochaneeyata nae vaishvik maanak model ke anuroop nahin rahi he, jisase hamaare swayan ke vikaas maarg par prashn uthaae ja sakate hai kyonki vikasshil deshon main abhi bhi sansadhano kii kami he
 Maintaining people's livelihood is equally important
 vikasshil deshon main saamaajik, aarthik vikaas tathaa garibi unmoolan ke anivaary lakshya ko vikaas ke nae mandandon kii sthapana karke gaun nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In addition to the fact that equal pressure is placed on developed countries to provide enabling resources in the financial and technological sphere, developing countries should also be provided with concessional and transparent ways for gradual changes in the green economy
 yah bhi mahatvapurn he ki desh vishesh ke prakritik sansadhano par bhi harith arthvyavastha par hone vaale vichaar-vimarshon main charchaa kii jaae
 Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals are being seen as potential deliverables as part of the Rio + 20 results
 johanesburg karyanvayan yojana ke vibhinn adhyyon ke antargat maatraatmak evam gunatmak donon lakshyon ke prastaav rakhe gaye hai
 Keeping in view the available time, it is proposed to discuss the sdgs during Rio + 20 and initiate a process to determine the later date of adoption which will continue even after 2015
 bharat aise kisi maatraatmak lakshyon kaa nirdhaaran kiye jane kaa samarthan nahin karata he, jisase vikasshil deshon main karyanvayan ke taur tareekon kaa praavdhaan kiye bina hi aarthik vikaas ke maarg main baadha utpann ho
 In addition, any implementation-based findings related to sustainable development in Rio + 20 must bear common but different responsibilities
 emdiji main visheshkar vikasshil deshon kii karyanvayan prakriyaaon par hi bal diya gaya tha, parantu esadiji na sirf sabhi ke liye honi chahie apitu sibiaradi ke siddhanton ke anuroop viksit deshon ko hi sarvapratham lakshyon ko puraa karne kii disha main aage aana chahie
 Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development There is a need to strengthen the global institutional framework to promote sustainable development
 vibhinn deshon kaa maananaa he ki sanyukt raashtra kii pranali ke antargat khandit satat vikaas ruparekha kii upasthiti tathaa anek bahupaksheeya paryaavarniya karaaron main behatar samanvay evam saamanjasy sthapit kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Several ideas are being discussed such as converting the current Commission on Sustainable Development into a Sustainable Development Council or upgrading UNEP as an umbrella international organization and / or creating a high-level political platform under Ecosos and / or , Which aims to provide high-level political visibility to sustainable development
 adhikansh vikasshil deshon kaa maananaa he ki iefesadi ke prashn ko iske aarthik, saamaajik evam paryaavarniya ayaamon ke bich santulan sthapit karne ke vishesh sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie, jabaki vikasshil deshon kii jaruraton evam baadhaon kaa samaadhaan karne, khaskar samarthakaari evam riyayati vittiya evam takneekee sansadhano ke antaran tathaa kshamta nirmaan main sahaayta par bhi vishesh bal diya janaa chahie

 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its acoustic features, making it the standard of the film house industry in 1955
 Subsequently, significant developments in the design and materials of the structure led to significant audio improvements
 The most notable improvements in modern speakers have been in the form of cone materials, the introduction of high-temperature adhesives, enhanced permanent magnet materials, improved measurement techniques, computer assisted design, and finite element analysis

 Very few manufacturers still use electrically powered regional coils
 When high field-intensity permanent magnets became available, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel and cobalt, became popular, eliminating the power supply problems of field-coil drivers

 After 1980, most driver manufacturers replaced alnico with a ferrite magnet made of a mixture of ceramic and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite
 Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than alnico, they are less expensive and make it possible for manufacturers to make large but economical magnets to achieve the given functionality

 Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi systems claim that the coherence of sound is due to the absence of a single source and interference, and possibly also to the absence of transition components

 The main cone is constructed in the whizzer design in such a way that it is more folded in the outer diameter than the center
 The result is that the main cone distributes low frequencies
 The whizzer cone mostly contributes to higher frequencies

 Since the target range of frequencies is limited, the design of subwoofer systems is generally simpler in many ways than traditional loudspeakers, often with a single driver mounted in a suitable box or enclosure

 In contrast, "passive" subwoofers require external amplification
 ek vufar ek driver he jo nimna aavritiyon ko punarutpaadit karata he
 The driver combines with the design of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies
 Some loudspeaker systems use woofers for the lowest frequencies, sometimes enough to not use a subwoofer

 This can be accomplished by selecting a tweeter that can operate significantly lower, combining with a woofer that reacts at very high frequencies, with both drivers connected concurrently at the middle frequencies

 Crossovers can be active or passive
 ek niskriy crossover ek electronic paripath he jisamen ek yaa adhik pratirodh, prerak yaa gaiyr-dhruviya sandharitra ke sangyojan prayukt hote hai
 These parts are formed in carefully designed networks and are mostly placed between the power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signals into the required frequency band before delivering them to different drivers
 niskriy crossover paripath ko khud shravy sanket se pare kisi bahya vidyut shakti kii jarurat nahin hoti kintu vaak kol tathaa crossover ke bich avamandan gunank main ullekhneey kami hoti he
 An active crossover is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into separate frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass
 niskriy filter bhi shakti pravardhan se pehle is tarah se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, lekin sakriy filtering kii tulana main dridhtaa ke kaaran yah ek asaamaanya samaadhaan he
 Any technique that uses amplification after crossover filtering is commonly known as by-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so forth, depending on the number of minimum amplifier channels

 Passive crossovers, like the driver units they feed, have electric carrying limits, insertion losses are 10% often claimed) and loads seen by the amplifier are changed

 With an infinitely large panel, this interference can be completely prevented
 ek paryaapt bade moharband box se is kriya ko kiya ja saktaa he
 Since panels of infinite dimensions are impractical, most enclosures work by incorporating surface radiation from the dynamic diaphragm
 ek moharband antahkshetra ek kathor or vayurodhak box main dhwani ko simit karke laudspikar ke peeche se utsarjit dhwani ke sancharan ko roktaa he
 Measures to reduce the transmission of sound in cabinet walls include thick cabinet walls, decaying wall material, internal reinforcement, folded cabinet walls — or, very rarely, sunken material or thin sheets of lead on the inner walls of the enclosure
 Layer plating is included
 haalanki, ek kathor antahkshetra aantarik rup se dhwani ko prayavartit karata he, jo laudspikar diaphram ke dwaara waapas sancharit ho sakati he- punah jiske parinaam main dhwani kii gunvattta main giravat hoti he
 This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorbent materials, such as glass fiber, wool, or synthetic fiber baiting in the enclosure
 The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed so that the sound can be reverted away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where it is absorbed
 anya prakaar ke antahkshetra prishth dhwani vikiran ko parivartit kar dete hai jisase yah rachanaatmak rup se shanku ke saamne se utpaadit nirgam main jud jaataa he
 Designs that do this are often used to extend effective low-frequency response and to increase the driver's low-frequency output
 driveron ke bich sankraman ko jitna sambhav ho sake utana jodrahit banane ke liye, ek yaa adhik driver ke arohan sthal ko aage yaa peeche sarkaakar taaki prayek driver kaa dhvanik centre samaan urdhwadhar tal main rahe, system dizinron ne driveron ko samay-sanrekhit karne ke prayaas kiye hai
 This may include tilting the speaker face backward, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or using electronic technology to achieve the same effect
 These efforts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs
 spikar arohan yojana vivartan bhi utpann kar sakati he jiske parinamswaroop aavriti anukriyaaon main shring or giravat ho sakati he
 At higher frequencies, where the wavelengths are the same or smaller than the amplitude of the cabinet, the problem usually becomes greatest
 is prabhaav ko cabinet ke saamne ke kinaaron ko golai dekar, khud cabinet ko ghumaav dekar, chote yaa sankare antahkshetra kaa upyog karke, ek ranneetik driver vyavastha chunakar, driver ke chaaron taraf avasorak saamagree kaa upyog karke yaa in yaa anya yojanaon ke kisi sangyojan kaa upyog karke kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Most loudspeakers use two wire ends for connection with the signal source
 aisa antahkshetra ke prishth bhaag main stambh par baandhakar yaa spring clip lagaakar kiya jaataa he
 If the strings of the left and right speakers are not connected to each other "in phase", the loudspeakers will fade away
 When given the same signal, the speed in one cone will be in the opposite direction of the other
 This will usually result in the cancellation of monophonic material in a stereo recording, decreasing levels, making localization more difficult, all due to the destructive interference of sound waves
 Where the speakers are separated by a quarter wave length or less, the effect of cancellation is most experienced; Low frequencies are most affected
 is prakaar ke tarakram se spikaron ko nuksaan nahin hota, kintu yah ishtatam nahin he
 Speaker specifications typically include: or vaikalpik rup se: The load exerted on an amplifier by a driver involves complex electrical impedance — a combination of resistance and capacitance and both inductive reactions, which is driven by the properties of a driver, its mechanical speed, the effect of crossover components, and the driver modified by the enclosure and its environment
 Combines the effect of air storage

 Instead, the speech coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonance, changes in the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the enclosure driver, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its variations
 parinaam ek bhaar pratirodh he jo aavriti ke saath kaaphi vyapak rup se parivartit hota he or aamtaur par ek voltage or vidyut ghaara ke bich ek parivertinsheel phej sambandh bhi hota he, jo aavriti ke saath bhi badalata he
 Some amplifiers can withstand these changes better than others

 The electric current variations passing through the speaker are thus converted into diverse magnetic forces, which accelerate the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to generate the same wind speed as the original signal from the amplifier

 Objective measurements provide information about several aspects of performance to make informed comparisons and improvements, but no combination of measurements summarizes the performance of a loudspeaker system in use, because neither signal used in the test nor There are no music nor speeches
 Examples of common measurements are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs
 frequency; Response to one or more conditions; Directivity vs
 frequency; SPL output, using any of the multiple test signals versus critical intermodulation distortion; Stored energy at different frequencies; Impedance vs
 frequency; And short signal vs
 long signal display
 Most of these measurements also require sophisticated and often expensive equipment for display and the correct decision of the measurer, but raw sound pressure levels are easy to report, So this is the only specified value - sometimes misleading in precise words
 The sound pressure level generated by a loudspeaker is measured in decibels
 laudspikar dakshata ko dhwani shakti nirgam vibhajit vaidyut shakti nivesh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Most loudspeakers are actually very inefficient transducers; Only 1% of the electrical energy sent to the loudspeaker by an amplifier is converted into acoustic energy
 shesh adhiktar vaak kundali tathaa chumbak sangyojan main ooshmaa ke rup main badal jaati he
 The main reason for this is the difficulty in obtaining proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the impedance of the air in which it radiates
 The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers also varies with frequency

 Driver ratings based on the SPL for a given investment are called sensitivity ratings and theoretically are similar to efficiency

 For example, a fan's horn produces more sound output in the direction in which it is oriented, concentrating the sound waves from the fan in one direction, thus "concentrating"
 shring vaak evam hawa ke bich pratibaadha milan main bhi sudhaar karata he, jisase ek di hui spikar shakti se adhik dhvanik shakti utpann hoti he
 In some cases, better impedance matching will allow the speaker to produce more acoustic power

 In the following examples, assume that the electrical impedance of the two drivers being compared is the same; Both operate on their own pass bands at the same frequency; And power compression and deformation are less

 Combination of high efficiency with compact enclosure size and sufficient low frequency response is not possible
 ek spikar system dizin karte samay teen main se do maanak hi chune ja sakate hai
 So, for example, if extended low frequency performance and small box size is important, low efficiency must be accepted
 This rule of thumb is sometimes called Hoffman's iron rule apane vaataavaran ke saath ek laudspikar system kii anyonyakriya jatil he or bade paimaane par laudspikar diziner ke niyantran se baahar he
 Most listening rooms offer a more reflective environment based on shape, form, volume, and furnishings
 iskaa matlab yah he ek shrota ke kaan tak pahunchne vaali dhwani main spikar system se sidhe aanevaali dhwani hi nahin, balki vahi dhwani ek yaa adhik satahon se safar karke deree se pahunchati he
 These reflected sound waves, when connected to direct sound, are canceled and added at selected frequencies, thus changing the rhythm and character of the sound in the listener's ear
 maanav mastishk inamen se kuch sahit, chote badlaavon ke prati bahut samvedansheel hota he or yahi aanshik kaaran he ki laudspikar system bhinn shravan sthitiyon main yaa bhinn kamaron main bhinn dhwani detaa he
 An important factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of diffusion and absorption present in the atmosphere
 ek vishisht khaali kamare main tali ek haath, pardon yaa kaaleen ke bina, ek tej gunj utpann hoti he, jo avasorana kii kami tathaa sapaat deevaaron, farsh or chat se anuranan donon ke kaaran hoti he
 Hard-surface furniture, wall hangings, cabinets, ceiling decorations from highly ornamented plaster alter the resonance, mainly due to diffusion produced by somewhat reflective objects resembling the shape of the sound wavelength
 yah kuch had tak anyathaa nagn sapaat satahon kii vajah se hue paravartan ko tod detaa he or aaptit tarang kii paravartit urja ko ek bade paravartan kone par failaa detaa he
 a typical rectangular listening room has primary resonance nodes in all three dimensions, left-right, top-down and forward-back, due to the rigid parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling
 iske alaava, teen, chaar, paanch yahaan tak ki chah seemaa satahon vaale jatil anunaad avasthaaen bhi hai jinamein sabhi satahen mil kar apragami tarangen banaati hai
 Low frequencies tend to excite these states the most, because long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture combinations or placement
 Mode spacing is particularly important in small and intermediate rooms such as recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios
 laudspikaron kii kamaron kii simaaon se nikatataa prabhavit karti he ki kitni majbootee se anunaad uttejit hai, saath hi saath prayek aavriti par saapeksh shakti ko prabhavit karti he
 The location of the listener is also important, such that a location near a boundary can have a major impact on the perceived balance of frequencies
 iskaa kaaran yah he apragami tarang pattern in sthanon main sabase aasaani se or kam aavritiyon par suni jaati he, shroyder aavriti se neeche - aamtaur par 200-300 hertz ke aasapaas, kamare ke aakaar par nirbhar karata he
 In studying radiation of sound sources, sound experts have developed some key concepts to understand how loudspeakers are understood
 sabase saral sambhav vikiran strot ek bindu strot he, jise kabhi kabhi ek saadhaaran strot kaha jaataa he
 An ideal point source is a microscopic sound radiating microscopic point
 ek chote se compymaan gole kii kalpana karnaa aalaan ho saktaa he, jiskaa vyas samaan rup se ghatata or badhata he, sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dhwani tarangen bhejte hue, aavriti se mukt
 Any sound-producing object, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of a combination of such simple points
 bindu sroton ke ek sangyojan kaa vikiran pattern ekal strot ke samaan nahin hoga, balki sroton ke bich duuri or unmukhikaran, vah saapeksh sthiti jis se shrota sangyojan sunata he or sandarbhit dhwani kii aavriti par nirbhar karegaa
 jyamiti or kalan kaa upyog karke, sroton main se kuch saral sanyojanon ko aasaani se hal kiya ja saktaa he, dusron ko nahin
 There is a simple combination, the two simple sources are separated by a distance and the phases are vibrating externally, one micro sphere expands, the other a contraction
 The pair is known as a bipolar or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to the operation of a dynamic loudspeaker without a very small resistor
 ek dwidhruv kii dishikata 8 ank ke aakaar kii he or adhiktam nirgam do sroton ko jodne vaale ek vector ke saath or nyanatam parshv kii ore jab prekshan bindu donon sroton se samdurastha he, jahaan dhanatmak or rinatmak tarangen ek dulare ko nirast kar detii hai
 While most drivers are bipolar, depending on the enclosure they are connected to, they may radiate like monopoles or bipoles
 yadi ek parimit avarohak par arohit he or in pravastha-bahya tarangon ko anyonyakriya karne di jaati he, dwidhruv aavriti anukriya parinaam main sheersh or shunya ho jate hai
 When surface radiation is absorbed or restrained in a box, the diaphragm becomes a unipolar radiator
 ekadhruvon ko ek box ke vipareet parshvon main pravastha-main arohit karke banaae gaye dwidhruv spikar sarvadishik vikiran pattern praapt karne kii ek vidhi he
 In real life, different drivers are actually 3D shapes in the form of complex cones and domes and are placed on the barrier for various reasons
 ek jatil aakaar kii dishikata ke liye ek ganitiya abhivyakti, bindu ke sroton ke modelling sangyojan ke aadhaar par, aamtaur par sambhav nahin lekin duurastha ek golakaar diafram ke saath ek laudspikar kii dishikata ek sapaat golakaar piston ke samaan hoti he, isliye charchaa ke liye ise ek sarlikrut udhaaharan ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following: Formula for the far-field directionality of a spherical piston on an infinite band p = p 0 j 1 ka sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle p = { \ frac {p_ {0} J_ {1}} {k_ {a} \ sin \ theta}}} where ka = 2 π a λ { \ displaystyle k_ {a} = { \ frac {2 \ pi a} { \ lambda xxrep 4 } , p 0 { \ displaystyle p_ {0}} is the pressure on the axis, a { \ displaystyle a} is the radius of the piston, λ { \ displaystyle \ lambda} ie the wavelength is θ { \ displaystyle \ theta} is the axis angle and j 1 { \ displaystyle J_ { 1}} is the first type of basal function
 ek samtal strot samaan rup se kam aavritiyon ke liye jinka tarangadairghy samtal strot ke ayaamon se adhik lanbaa he, ke liye samaan dhwani vikeern hoga or jaise-jaise aavriti bad jaati he is tarah ke ek strot se dhwani ek badhate hue sankare kone main kendrit hogi
 jitna chota driver, utani ucch aavriti, jahaan dishikata kaa yah sankuchan hota he
 Even if the diaphragm is not spherical at all, this effect occurs such that the larger source is more directional
 kai laudspikar dizin banaaye gayi hai jinka lagbhag yahi vyavhaar he
 Most are electrostatic or magnetic plane designs
 vibhinn nirmaataa us sthaan main jinke liye unhen dizin kiya gaya he, ek vishisht prakaar ke dhwani kshetra kii rachana ke liye bhinn driver arohan vyavastha kaa upyog karte hai liye antariksh main ek dhwani vishisht prakaar he jiske liye ve taiyaar kar rahe hai banane ke liye
 parinamswaroop vikiran pattern vaastavik yantron dwaara utpann dhwani kaa baariki se anukaran karne ke liye abhipret ho saktaa he, yaa sirf nivesh sanket se niyantrit urja vitaran kaa srijan karnaa 
 pehle kaa ek udhaaharan he, ek 1 / 8 gole kii kii sataha par bahut se chote driveron ke saath kamare kaa corner system
 is prakaar ke ek system kaa dizin professor amar bose-2201 ke dwaara patent karaayaa gaya tha or vastav main vanijyik utpaadan kiya gaya
 Later Bose models deliberately emphasized the production of direct or reflected sound by loudspeakers regardless of the environment
 ye dizin ucch nishtha halkon main vivaadaaspad rahe he, lekin vanijyik rup se safal sabit hue hai
 The designs of many other manufacturers follow the same principles
 dishikata ek mahatvapurn mudda he kyonki yah shrota dwaara suni jane vaali dhwani ke aavriti santulan ko prabhavit karata he, iske saath hi spikar system kii kamare or uske saamaan ke saath anyonyakriya ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 a speaker that is too direct may result in a tracing area without high frequency, giving the effect that although the measurement on its axis is correct, it is not treble
 bahut vyapak yaa ucch aavritiyon par teji se badhati dishikata yah prabhaav de sakati he ki trable bahut adhik he he, yaa bahut kam he 
 yah us kaaran kii hissaa he, kyon aksh par anukriya maapan die hue laudspikar kii dhwani kii purna visheshta varnan nahin he
 Other drivers that diverge from the most commonly used directly radiative, enclosure-mounted electromagnetic driver include: shring laudspikar laudspikar system kaa sabase purana rup he
 The use of horns in speech amplifier megaphone is at least as old as the 17th century, and horns were first used in mechanical gramophones in 1857
 shring laudspikar driver ke saamne yaa peeche roopit tarang pathak kaa prayog laudspikar kii dishikata badhaane or chote vyas ke roopantaran ke liye, deergh vyas vaali driver shanku sataha par ucch dabaav sthiti tathaa shring ke mukh par kam dabaav kii sthiti ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This increases the sensitivity of the loudspeaker and focuses the sound into a finite region
 gale kaa aakaar, mukh, shring kii lambaai, saath hi kshetra vistaar dar ke saath yah dhyaan rahe ki aavritiyon kii ek range main roopantaran prakaarya pradaan karne ke liye drive kaa milan dhyaan se chunaa janaa chahie 
 ek bas banane ke liye aavashyak lambaai or anuprastha mukh kshetra yaa sab-bas shring ke liye kai foot lanbaa shring chahie
 'valit shring' kul aakaar ko kam kar sakate hai lekin dizinron ko samjhauta karne or laagat tathaa nirmaan jaisi vruddhi kii jatilta ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar dete hai
 Some horn design not only incorporates low frequency horns but, in the corner of the room, use the wall as an extension of the horn mouth
 1940 ke dashak ke ant main, shring jinke mukh kamare kii diwaar kaa kaaphi hissaa lelete the, ab hai-faai prashansakon ke bich anjaane nahin rahe
 kamare ke aakaar kii sansthapana ko bahut kam sweekaarya kiya gaya jab do yaa adhik kii jarurat hoti thi
 The sensitivity of a horned speaker can be as high as 110 db at 1 meter at 2
83 volts
 90 dibi kii ghoshit samvedansheeltaa kii tulana main nirgam main yah sau guna vruddhi he, jahaan ucch dhwani str kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yaa pravardhan shakti samit hoti he, vahaan yah anmol he
 Piezoelectric speakers are commonly used as beepers in watches, and as tweeters in other electronic devices and sometimes in less expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios
 paaramparik laudspikaron kii tulana main pijovidhyut spikar ke kai phaayde hai: ve atibhaar pratirohak hai jo ki aam taur par adhiktar ucch aavriti chaalkon ko nasht kar detaa he or ve apane vaidyut gunon ke kaaran ek crossover ke bina istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 There are disadvantages as well: some amplifiers can oscillate like most piezoelectric, resulting in distortion or damage to the amplifier
 iske atirikt, unki aavriti anukriya, zyaadaatar maamalon main, anya praudyogikiyon se halki he
 This is why they are generally used in single-frequency or non-critical applications
 pijovidhyut spikar kaa vistaarit ucch aavriti nirgam ho saktaa he, yah kuch vishisht paristhitiyon ke liye upyogi haih udhaaharan ke liye sonar anuprayog jinamein pijovidhyut roopaantar nirgam upkaran or nivesh upkaran ke rup main 
 in anuprayogon main unke phaayde hai, jinka leshmaatr bhi saral nahin he, solid state nirmaan jo samudri pani ke prabhaavon kaa pratirodh riban aadhaarit upkarnon se behatar kar saktaa he
 Magnetic distortion Tcnducer is based on magnetic distortion, mainly used as sonar ultrasonic sound radiators, but they are also used in audio speaker systems
 chumbakeey virupan spikar driveron ke kuch vishesh laabh he: ve anya takneekon kii tulana main adhik bal pradaan kar sakate hai, kam bhraman anya diginon main bade bhraman se vikrutiyon se bachaav kar sakate hai; chumbakiyakaran kundali sthir he or isliye adhik aasaani se thandi kii ja sakati he, kyonki ve majboot hai, najuk nilamban or vaak kundali kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The magnetic distortion speaker module is manufactured by Faustex and Fionic and subwoofer drivers have also been produced
 sthiravaidyut laudspikar ek ucch voltata vidyut kshetra kaa upyog sthatikatah aaweshit jhilli ko ke pranod parichaalan hetu kiya jaataa he
 Since they operate over the entire membrane surface rather than in a short speech coil, they typically provide a more linear and lower distortion speed than dynamic drivers
 unako nuksaan yah he ki diafram bhraman gambhir rup se vyaavhaarik nirmaan simaaon ke kaaran simit he, aage stater tainaat hai, sweekaarya dakshata praapt karne ke liye ucchtar voltage kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo vidyut arq kii pravriti ko badhaata he, saath hi spikar dwaara dhul ke kanon ko aakarshith karnaa bad jaataa he
 For many years, electrostatic loudspeakers had a reputation as a generally unreliable and sometimes dangerous product
 vartmaan praudyogikiyon ke saath arking ek sambhavit samasya bani hui he, khaskar jab panelon ko dhul yaa gandagi, ekatra karne kii anumati he yaa jab ucch sanket str ke saath sanchalit ho
 Stable electrodes are traditionally bipolar radiators and are less suitable for use in enclosures for low-frequency repeats like common cone drivers due to the thin flexible membrane
 is kaaran tathaa kam bhraman kshamta ke kaaran, purna seemaa sthiravaidyut laudspikar prakruti se bade hai or bas sabase sankare panel aayam ke ek chauthai ke baraabar tarang dairghy vaali aavriti par role karegaa
 vanijyik utpaadon ke aakaar ko kam karne ke liye, unhen kabhi kabhi ek paaramparik gatisheel driver jo bas aavritiyon ko sambhalate hai, ke saath sangyojan main ucch aavriti driver ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
 a ribbon speaker consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field
 vidyut sanket riban ko bheje jate hai, jo inke saath chalata he, is tarah dhwani paidaa hoti he
 One advantage of the ribbon driver is that the ribbon has a very low mass, thus, it can accelerate the response very well, a very good high-frequency response can be achieved
 riban laudspikar aksar bahut najuk, kuch hawa ke ek majboot jhonke se phaade ja sakate hai
 Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern, with very few having a stipulation to limit the dipole radiation pattern
 newnaadhik ytaakar riban ke kinaaron ke upar or neeche pravastha nirasan ke kaaran kam shravaniy nirgam hota he, lekin dishikata kii sahi raashi riban kii lambaai par nirbhar karti he
 Ribbon designs typically require exceptionally powerful magnets that make their construction costly
 riban kaa pratirodh bahut kam hota he jise adhiktar pravardhak sidhe pranod parichaalit nahin kar sakate
 natijatan, ek apchaayi transfarmar kaa upyog aam taur par riban main se vidyut dhara badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The amplifier sees a load, which is the resistance of the ribbon multiplied by the square of the ratio of transformer turns
 The transformer must be carefully designed in such a way that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not reduce the sound quality, further increasing the cost and increasing complexity relative to conventional designs
 samtal chumbakeey spikaron kabhi-kabhi "riban" ke rup main varnit he, lekin vastav main riban spikar nahin hai
 The term plane is generally reserved for speakers with flat surfaces of approximately rectangular shape that radiate in a bipolar manner
 samtal chumbakeey spikar ek vaak kundali mudrit yaa arohit ek lacheelee jhilli se milakar banataa he
 The current flowing in the coil interacts with the magnetic field of the carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, vibrating the membrane more or less uniformly without bending or wrinkling
 The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces conventional resonance problems of coil-driven flat diaphragms
 banken tarang transducers jaanboojhkar lacheela rakhe gaye diafram kaa upyog karte hai
 The stiffness of the material moves from the center to the outside
 laghu tarang dairghy mukhya rup se bhitari kshetra se vikiran karti hai, jabaki lambii tarangen spikar ke kinare tak pahunchati hai
 To prevent reflection from the outside back to the center, the long waves are absorbed by the surrounding sponge
 aise transducers vyapak aavriti seemaa ko cover kar sakate hai tathaa ek adarsh bindu dhwani strot ke rup main protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 This unusual approach is being adopted by some manufacturers in very different arrangements
 om walsh spikaron kii line main linkan walsh dwaara dizin kiye gaye ek adwitiya driver kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Lincoln Walsh was a talented engineer who was part of the engineering team that developed radar during World War II
 baad main unhone audio emplifaire dizin kiye or unki antim pariyojna ek adwitiya, ek driver ke saath ek-margi spikar tha
 It was a large cone with its mouth down in a sealed, airtight enclosure
 paaramparik spikaron kii tarah aage-or-peeche gati karne kii bajaay shanku laharaaya or "sancharan line” naamak siddhant kaa upyog karke dhwani utpann kii
 nae spikar ne ek ekal, purnataase prastut kii gai ullekhneey spashtataa vaali dhwani tarang kaa nirmaan kiya
 a new company, Om Acoustics, was created to develop and market Walsh's new speaker design
 linkan walsh kaa spikar janata ke liye jari hone se pehle uski mrityu ho gai
 After developing the prototype Om A, in 1973, Om received critical acclaim by releasing the Om f speaker
 spikar system kaa aakaar kam karne ke kai prayaas ho chuke hai, yaa vaikalpik rup se unhen kam pratyaksh karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 One such endeavor was the development of a speech coil mounted on a flat panel that served as a sound source
 ye tab ek tatasth rang main banaaye ja sakate hai or deevaaron par latakaae ja sakate hai jahaan un par anya spikaron kii bajaay kam dhyaan jaae, yaa jaanboojhkar us par aise pattern paint kiye jaaen ki ve alankrita rup main kaary kar saken
 flats panel takanic ke saath do samasyaayein sambandhit hai: pehali, ek flats panel jaruri taur par usee saamagree main ek shanku aakaar se adhik lacheela he or isliye ek ekal ikai ke rup main gati karegaa or doosraa he, panel main anunaadon kaa niyantran mushkil he, jisaki vajah se kaaphi vikrutiyon kii sambhaavna he
 Some progress has been made using such lightweight, hardwood materials such as styrofoam and many flat panel systems have been produced commercially in recent years
 flats panel spikar system kaa naye karyanvayan main ek jaanboojhkar rakhaa gaya lacheela panel or ek "uttejk" shaamil he, centre se dur arohit tathaa is prakaar sthit ki nunatam anunaadon ke saath panel ko kampan ke liye uttejit kar sake
 aisi takanic kaa upyog karne vaale spikar vyapak dishikata pattern ke saath dhwani kaa punarutpaadan kar sakate hai or kuch computer spikar diginon main tathaa bukshelf laudspikaron main inkaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Oscar Heal invented the air speed transducer in the 1960s
 is paddati main, ek chunnatdaar diafram ek chumbakeey kshetra main arohit hota he or ek sangeet sanket ke niyantran main band hone or khulne ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 According to the applied signal, air passes through the pleats and produces sound
 driver riban se kam kamjor or riban, sthiravaidyut yaa chumbakeey samtal twitor dizin kii tulana main kaaphi adhik daksh hai
 a California manufacturer, ESS licensed the design and hired Heal and produced a range of speaker systems using its tweeters in the 1970s and 1980s
 ek bade america khudara store shrinkhalaa, radio shaike ne bhi ek samay aise twitors kaa upyog karne vaale spikar system beche the
 Currently, there are two manufacturers of both of these drivers in Germany, one of which is producing a series of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-distance drivers based on technology
 america main martin logan anek eemti spikaron kaa utpaadan karata he
 Plasma arc loudspeakers use electrical plasma as a radiative element
 chunki plasma main dravyaman nunatam hota he, lekin aaweshit hota he isliye vidyut kshetra dwaara iskaa prabandhan kiya ja saktaa he, parinaam main shravy seemaa se oonchi aavritiyon kaa bahut raikhik utpaadan hota he
 This method makes it unsuitable for mass market use due to maintenance and reliability problems
 1978 main albukark, enem main air force vaipans laboretory ke alan i

 vartmaan main, germany main kuch nirmaataa bache hai jo is dizin kaa upyog karte hai, unhone ek ise-swayan-karen dizin prakashit kiya he or yah internet par uplabdh he
 An economical variant of this has used a flame for the driver, because the flame contains ionized gases
 bahut peeche 1920 ke dashak main digital spikar bail labs dwaara kiye gaye prayogon kaa vishay rahaa he
 The design is simple, each bit controls the driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'
 is dizin ke saath samasyaayein hai jinaki vajah se avyaavhaarik hone ke kaaran ise vartmaan ke liye tyaag diya gaya he
 First, for a reasonable number of bits, the physical size of the speaker system becomes very large
 duusare, analog digital roopantaran kii antarnihit samasyaon ke kaaran upghaton kaa prabhaav aprihaary he, isliye shravy nirgam aavriti kshetra main samaan aayam ke saath namoona chayan aavriti ke duusari taraf “paravartit” hota he, jiske kaaran vaanchit nirgam ke saath paradhvanik kaa asweekaarya ucch str hota he
 No practical plan has been found to adequately deal with this
 shabd "digital" yaa "digital taiyaar" aksar spikar yaa headphone par vipanan uddeshyon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin ye pranaliyaan upar varnit bhaavana main digital nahin hai
 Rather, they are traditional speakers that can be used with a digital sound source, as with any traditional speaker, players, etc

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution ie uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal
 Nonnative species can bring about previously isolated species in contact, through purposeful introduction by hybridization and introgression about a form of extinction of native plants and animals, either through humans or habitat modification

 After the untimely demise of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh, on 25 January 1700, he sat on the throne of Amber at the age of almost 11 years of childhood
 aurangzeb ne unhen 'savai' kii oopaadhi di thi - jiskaa pratikatmak-arth yahi he ki ve apane samakalinon se 'savaya' the
 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua

e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar

 Jaisingh II was born Margashirsha Vadi on 7 November 1745, on 3 November 1688 from Raja Vishnusingh's Rathore Queen, Indrakanwar, daughter of Thakur Keshari Singh of Kharwa in Ajmer

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade
 vah jab kai shahi-adeshon kii avhelnaa kar chuke, to antat inhen 'jabaran' le aane ko badshaah ne kuch harkare amer tak bhi bheje| inaki anupasthiti se naaraaz badshaah aurangzeb ne in se amer raja kaa khitaab to nahin chhina, par 13 sitambar 1701 ko inhen 'padaavnat' karte hue maatr 500 jaat, 100 savaar kaa maamuli manasabadaar bana diya
 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort
 uski burj par amer kaa 'pancharanga jhanda' fahraaya gaya
 
 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae
 ' vidmbana haratangez he ki jis aurangzeb ne kabhi inhen 'savai' kah kar sammaan diya vahi baad main vastutah inase is kadar naaraaz or purvaagrahagrast tha ki usne ye apmanjanak ajna jari kii- "jaisingh ko masanad par asana na de kar, neeche zamin par bichhi 'sujani' par baithne ko kaha jaay!" Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704
 duusare saal i0 1705 main shah bidarbakht ne apni taraf se inke paksh main phir se koshish karke jaisingh ko malwa kaa bhi naayab soobedaar banavaa diya
 But as long as Aurangzeb survived, his influence in the Mughal camp remained mild

 Shah Azam invaded Agra and Delhi
 us samay tak usne inkaa mansab 5000 jaat 500 savaar kaa kar diya tha
 On June 18, 1707, the battle of Jaju took place 20 miles south of Agra between the armies of Maujam and Azam

 He sent the news of this to Delhi and stopped Buddha Singh Hada on his way on leave and got him married in Samode

 In January 1708, he reached Amer and took it to Khalsa
 jaisingh se amer kii jaagir jabt karke badshaah bahadurshah dwaara 10 janvari 1708 ko unke chote bhai vijaisingh ko anekanek mahange uphaaron sahit de di gayi
 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar
 jab unhen yah aashaa nahin rahi ki badshaah unke ilaake unhen waapas lautaaega to unhone durgadas rathod kii raay se, jab badshaah narbada nadi paar karne ko ravaanaa hua, 20 april 1708 baishakh sudi 13 ko baadashahi-shivi chhod diya or ve raajapootaana kii ore waapas ravaanaa hokar mewar udaipur pahunche
 Here, Maharana Pratap's son and heir Rarana Amar Singh welcomed him and married his granddaughter Jai Singh

 Two armies were sent from Joghpur to take control of the Amer ruled by Vijay Singh

 In the Second Army, Maharaja Jai singh's Diwan Ram Chandra and Shyam Singh had 20,000 cavalry

 After the war, the Mughals were feeling happy in victory

 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh
 inhone 1713 i0 main vijaisingh se samjhauta karne or 'rajmata se bhent' karne ke naam par apane sashastr sainikon evam saradaaron samet sanganer ja kar dhokhe se unako kaid karvaa diya or jaigarh kile main bhej diya
 Shyam Singh Khangarot was a special assistant in this 'assassination' of Vijay Singh
 bahadur shah kii mrityu ke baad uske uttaradhikari jahandarshah ne amer or marwar donon raajaaon ko phir apane paksh main karnaa chaha
 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs
 farrukh sier ke mogul badshaah banane ke baad hossain ali saiyad ne shyamsingh khangarot ko bulawaaya tathaa unase baat karke jaisingh ko badshaah se 5000 jaat 4500 savaar kaa mansab dilvaaya
 When At Singh differed with the emperor, the emperor sent Syed Hussain Ali with his army to Ajmer, where Attingh was captured
 us samay jaisingh bhi hossain ali saiyad ke saath the
 In the end there was a treaty with At Singh
 oktober 1713 i0 main inhen badshaah farrukh sier ne malwa kii soobedaari pradaan kii
 He suppressed many rebellions there and also suppressed the nuisance of the marines
 marahathon kii ek badi sena jab malwe main ghusi tab inhone palsood ke paas use badi karaari haar di
 Marathi army men fled and stayed in Palsud
 jaisingh ne raat main hi un par hamalaa kar diya
 Seeing his army, he escaped and crossed the Nervada River
 unki lut kaa sab maal vahiin rah gaya
 Chhatrasal Bundela was also with him in Malwa
 1715 i0 main inako dilli bula liya gaya
 Then in his absence, he put his Dhabhai Ruparam there as a hero
 1717 tak ye malwa ke soobedaar rahe
 Emperor Farrukh Sier gave the princely state of Bundi to Bhimsingh Hada king Kota and he also captured Bundi
 jaisingh ne prayaas karke badshaah se bundi waapas raja budhsingh hada ko dilvaayi
 The emperor from Delhi ordered them to climb Chudaman Jat of Bharatpur, which had caused a great disturbance in the area of agra from looting
 inke saath bundi ke buddhasingh, kota ke bhimsingh, narvar ke gajsingh, durgadas rathod va kai anya manasabadaar bhi niyukt kiye gayi
 On 15 September 1716, he took his army and left for Mathura
 navambar main chudaaman ke prasiddh kile thun kaa gheraa shuru kiya
 Var Abdullah Khan was against Syed, Jaysingh and was helping Chudaman
 isse inhen is abhiyaan main safalataa nahin mil pai
 Var Abdullah Khan Syed finally took up the circle of Thun after falling in between
 may 1718 main jaisingh kii vaapasi dilli hui
 Despite this failure in the area of chudaman, he was respected by the emperor
 saiyadon or baadshahon ke bich talavaarein khinch chuki thi
 Jaisingh persuaded Emperor Farrukh Sayar that he should be cleaned forever after fighting the Syed
 us samay unke paas 20 hajaar rajput savaar dilli main maujuud the tathaa bundi ke buddhasingh hada bhi unheen ke saath the
 But the king did not dare to take this military action
 vah saiyadon ko kisi tarah khush karne main laga rahaa
 Finally, the Sayyids asked the emperor Jaisingh to leave Delhi
 jaisingh ne badshaah ko sachet kiya ki unke jane se badshaah kii jaan ko khatra ho jayega lekin yah salaah badshaah kii samaj main nahin ai
 Jaisingh left Delhi on 13 February 1719 AD
 uske kuch hi ghanton baad bheenmasingh kota raja ne budhsingh bundi par akraman kar diya
 His loyal devotee Sardar Jait Singh with great valor stopped the army of Kota and removed Budh Singh from there safely
 ve bhaag kar savai jaisingh ke paas pahunche
 On April 17- 18, Syed brothers, At Singh Jodhpur and Bhimsingh Kota together killed the emperor Farrukhsiyar in Delhi
 jaisingh ne elahabaad ke soobedaar chhabila ram or nizaam se saiyadon ke viruddh bhi patr-vyavhaar kiya
 They wanted everyone to oust the Sayyids together
 inhone chhatrasaal bundela ko bhi yuddh ke liye bulaayaa
 The Sayyids sent several armies to surround them from many sides
 On 5 July, Var Abdullah Khan, along with the nominal Emperor Rafiudullah, marched on Jai Singh and reached Agra via Mathura, where rebellion against the Sayyids was taking place
 jaisingh ne bhi saiyadon se puure taur se muqabla karne kii taiyaari kar lee thi par yuddh main ravaanaa hone ke pehle unhone brahmanon ko bulaakar amer rajya daan main de diya or kesaria bana dhaaran karke ve saiyadon se ladaai ke liye ravaanaa hue
 They had reached Toda Raisingh from Amer
 par nizaam or chhabilaram donon hi vaayade ke anusaar inke paksh main kaayam nahin rahe
 Jaisingh felt disappointed
 ant main atsingh jaisingh ko apane saath jodhpur le gayi jahaan unhone apni putree kaa jaisingh se vivaah kiya
 The Syed gave Rs 20 lakh to Jaisingh, so that they could buy Amber back from the Brahmins
 us samay bhi jaisingh ko atsingh jodhpur par vishwaas nahin tha isliye ve apane vivaah main bhi jirahabakhtar pahan kar gayi the
 When the two Sayyid forces were defeated by the Nizam in the south, Hussain Ali Khan Syed, accompanied by Emperor Mohammad Shah, proceeded to suppress the Nizam with a large army
 sitambar 8, 1720 i0 ko todabhim main usne hossain ali ko dhokhe se maar daalaa
 Now the emperor prepared and mounted Syed Abdullah Khan who was in Delhi
 is yuddh ke liye maharana ne jaisingh se poocha ki 'use kya karnaa chahie?' jaisingh ne udapur ke maharana ko badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr likhaa tathaa saath main hi maharana ke alaava bikaner, kota or raav indrasingh nagaur ko bhi badshaah kii madad karne ke liye patr bheje
 Sawai Jaisingh himself sent a good army with Rao Jagram to help the emperor Mohammad Shah
 is sena main savai ram, gadhi gajsingh, naruka jaavali, jaswantsingh, sawairam ke putr, pratapsingh kalyanot, buddhasingh kalyanot, gulab singh kalyanot, chhitarsingh kalyanot, amarsingh rajaavat, bahadur singh khangoraat or sardarsingh naruka aadi sardaar the
 On 3 and 4 November 1720, there was a war in which Syed Abdullah Khan was captured
 vijay ke baad badshaah ne jaipur ke saradaaron ko apane haath se khichhaten deen
 Mohammad Shah, on reaching Delhi, sent Jaisingh an order to come to Delhi, in which he wrote that he has to take advice on many important problems
 usne dilli pahunchane par badshaah ne apane naye var mohammad amin khan ko unke dere par lene bheja
 On coming to the court, the emperor gave him a big welcome and gave many gifts
 unke mansab main 4000 savaar or badha die gaye
 On this occasion, he gave them two crores of rupees in reward / money which he humbly refused to take
 par badshaah ne savai jaisingh or raja giradhar bahadur ke anurodh par hiduon par lagaaya jane vaala kathin jajia kar maaf kar diya
 Maharana Mewar sent a written congratulation to Sawai Jaisingh on his success to give Jaziya Hatwa
 saiyadon ke patan ke baad jaisingh kaa rajnatik mahatv tezi se badhane laga
 The kings of Rajasthan, Malwa and Bundelkhand wanted help and advice from them in every trouble
 in ilaakon main inaki raay ke bagaiyr kuch bhi nahin hota tha
 After 1735 AD, the Marathas also started taking their advice and respecting them
 inhen savai ke alaava mogul baadshahon ne jo anya oopaadhiyaan samay samay par deen ve thim - saramde –raja-e- hind' / 'rajrajeshwar' / 'shrirajadhiraj aadi
 In September 1722, Jaisingh was sent as the Subedar of Agra to suppress the Jats
 inke saath 50 hajaar sainikon kii badi fouj thi tathaa anek manasabadaar bhi inke saath the
 The royal artillery was also with him
 chudaaman jat kaa putr mohakamsingh is samay jaaton kaa netaa tha
 But Chudaman's nephew Badansingh, who was angry with him, met Jai Singh
 inhone uskaa bada swaagat-satkar kiya
 Once again, they besieged the fort of Thun
 atsingh joghpur ne ek sena mohakamsingh kii madad ke liye bheji, parantu vah jobaner se aage nahin badi
 Like Vibhishan, the victory of the fort of Thun looked certain with the advice of Badansingh
 tab mohakamsingh niraash hokar gupt maarg se kila chhod kar atar singh ke paas jodhpur pahunchaa
 But Sawai Jai Singh had the right over the Jat fort at Thun
 inhone surajmal ke pita badansingh ko bharatpur kii jaagir di tathaa raja ke rup main unke pagadi baandhi
 On June 19, 1723, Thakur Badansingh Jat signed a handwriting to this effect by 'serving the Jaipur Darbar' and accepting an annual offer of Rs 83 thousand
 badansingh jaipur ke dashahra darbar main har saal aayaa karte the

 Jaisingh was made the Subedar of Malwa again by the Mughal emperor
 ve 23 oktober 1729 i0 ko ujjain ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Jaisingh wanted to compromise the rebellious marines for the protection of his kingdom
 inke is samjhauta-prastaav ko badshaah ne bhi sweekaar kar liya tha
 On this victory, he had read and written with Sahu
 sahu iske liye taiyaar ho gaya tha, kintu peshwa log is samjhaute ke zyada paksh main nahin tha
 He sent Deep Singh Kumbhani to Sahura near Sahu
 lautate samay deepasingh nizaam se bhi mila, parantu sitambar 1730 i0 main inke malwa kii soobedaari se hat jane se vah samjhauta nahin ho sakaa
 The relationship of Jai Singh became very bad with Bundi King Buddha Singh when Buddha Singh Bundi and his Kachwahi queen created serious differences among themselves
 ant main sambandh itane bigade ki jaisingh ne badshaah ko kah kar buddhasingh ke sthaan par karwaad ke saalim singh hada ke putr dalelsinh ko bundi kaa raja banavaa diya or baad main apni putree bhi use byaah di
 This led to a long and painful struggle between Jaipur and Bundi in Rajasthan
