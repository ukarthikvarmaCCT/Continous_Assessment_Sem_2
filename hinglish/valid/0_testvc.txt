 As soon as he came, Dharmaraja fell at the feet of Yudhishthira
 tab yudhisthir ne ghabara kar poocha - "he arjuna! dwarikapuri main hamaare sambandhi or bandhu-bandhav yadav log to prasann hai na? hamaare naanaa shurasen tathaa chote mamaa vasudev to kushal se hai na? hamaari maami devaki apni saaton bahanon tathaa putr-pautradi sahit prasann to hai na? raja ugrasen or unke chote bhai devak to kushal se hai na? pradhyumna, aniruddh, samb, rishabh aadi to prasann hai na? hamaare swami bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra uddhav aadi apane sevakon sahit kushal se to hai na? ve apni sudharma sabha main nity aate hai na? satyabhama, rukmini, jamvanthi aadi unki solah sahastra ek sau aath patraniyaan to nity thanaki seva main leen rahati hai na? he bhai arjuna! tumhaari kaanti ksheen kyon ho rahi he or tum shrihin kyon ho rahe ho?"

 Took, they abandoned us and went away from this world

 After this, the supreme scientist Yudhishthira performed the Prajapati Yajna and took the renunciation while immersed in Lord Shri Krishna Chandra

 The whole world began to see him as a Brahman

 After doing so, he walked out of the house towards north direction without looking at anyone

 The massacre in the An Lushan Rebellion that began in 755 had boosted the inner poet of Tu Fu
 unhone logon kii pidaa ko apni kritiyon main baandha
 He also narrated his agony in these lines - when more papers are laid on my table, i feel like shouting loudly like crazy
 jab vah 759 main gansu gaye to sambhawatah apni tathaa samaaj kii niraashaa ko apni un saath rachanaaon main ujagar kiya jo unhone maatr che saptaah main likhe the
 Fueled by economic disparities, he moved to his place of birth in 726 AD
 haalaanki unki sehat kaaphi kharaab ho gayi thi, phir bhi wo apane parivaar ke saath badicheng main do varshon tak rahe
 In contrast, Fu probably composed the most poems
 unki antim krityon main se ek tha 'mere sevanivruth mitra vei ke liye
 'in this composition, he presented the pain of separation between friends arising out of transfer in government job
 tu phu ko itihasikar kavi isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki unhone apni kavitaaon main sainya bal kii yukti par, apane aas paas ho rahi ghatnaon tathaa aam logon ke jivan par in ghatnaon ke prabhaav kii sushpasht vivarani di he
 The political lectures of this poet were never inspired by any of his mathematics
 unki ek maatr prerana rajnatik ghatnaon se utpann bhaavana hoti thi
 Such a statement of simultaneous events is not found in the official records
 tu phu ko rishi kavi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The source of this title lies in his ability, on which he used to present his personal agony by making the story of common people
 falswaroop, unki kavitaaon main bhashaa or tathy donon hi dainik jivan se sambandh hote the
 An Lushan Rebellion was a devastating rebellion against the Tang Dynasty of China
 vidroh kii shuruyaat tab hui jab general lushaan ne 16 disambar 755 ko apane aap ko uttari china main samraat ghoshit kar diya
 Thus a rival Yan dynasty was established

 The rebellion came to an end after the rule of three lordly emperors

 You used to write on unusual subjects like domestic life, calligraphy, painting and animals
 sambhawatah in vishyon par kavita likhnaa unke hi bas kii baat thi
 Although his poems were inspired by rural perspective and normal life in the early times, later poems were deeply rooted in philosophy and power
 tu phu kii kavitaayon main ek style or tatva kii baadhyataa hoti thi jiske kaaran unki kavitaaon ko lushi paddati kii rachanaayen maani gai
 The precise use of words and context in the poems of Tu Fu and the use of their influence was such that the effect of their works can also be seen in the works of Japanese poets
 yah prabhaav muromachi kaal se edo kaal tak dikhataa he
 In modern times, the sage of the poet is used only in the context of tu fu
 jivan kaal main to sambhawatah unka moolyankan unki rachanaaon ke aadhaar par sah nahin hua tha par unke mrityu ke pashchaat unki prashansa samast vishwa main hone lagi
 Tu Fu began to be equated with Wang We Wang We Li Bai, and these three poets are seen as a symbol of Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist culture

 By this time he had suffered from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous illnesses
 do saal tak chongking main rahe
 During this time, he made the final compositions of his life
 lagbhag 400 kavitaayen likhi thim
 He resumed his journey again in March 768 after spending two years in Yangtzekyang
 hunan praant main changasha naamak jagah main november yaa disambar 770 main unka nidhan ho gaya

 One Day International) is a style of cricket, in which 50 overs are played per team between two national cricket teams
 cricket vishwa cap isi praaroop ke anusaar khelaa jaataa he
 One-day internationals are also called "limited overs internationals", as limited-overs cricket matches are played between national teams and they do not always end in a day if the weather causes a disruption
 Important one-day international and domestic matches are often held for two days, of which the second day is a "reserve / reserve" day, so that the first day has more opportunities to end the game in case there are no results

 The rules of cricket in the main format apply
 lekin, ek divasiy antarrashtriya match main prayek team keval simit sankhya ke overon ke liye ballebaaji karti he
 In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs per team was usually 60, but now it has been uniformly limited to 50 overs
 saadhaaran bhashaa main khel is prakaar he: In the event of a decrease in the number of overs, for example due to inclement weather, the number of overs may be reduced
 yadi kisi kaaran se duusari pari main ballebaaji karne vaali vaali team dwaara khele jane vaale overon kii sankhya pehali pari main ballebaaji karne vaali team se alag ho to dakworth-louis vidhi dwaara parinaam nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The lights are illuminated in such a way that it does not obstruct the fielding team and the captains are allowed to keep cloth on the field in case the ball gets wet

 Traditionally, the fielding ban was applied for the first 15 overs of each innings
 30 july 2005 se shuru hone vaali 10 maah kii pareekshan avadhi main isisi ne ekadivasiy shrinkhalaaon ke nae niyamon ke rup main powerple niyam kii shuruyaat kii
 Under the Powerplay rule, the fielding ban applies for the first 10 overs and in two parts of five overs
 oktober 2008 se ballebaaji karne vaali team yah faisla karti he ki shesh bache hue do hisson main koi ek powerple kab shuru ho, tathaa kshetrarakshan karne vaali team yah nirdhaarit karti he ki doosraa powerple kab shuru ho
 During the first powerplay, no more than two players can be parked outside the radius of 30 yards
 It is also necessary in the first 10 overs that at least two fielders are in close positions to catch catches
 powerple ke sambandh main isisi ne yah ghoshnaa kii he ki 1 oktober 2007 se kshetrarakshan karne vaali team kaa captain paanch-paanch overon ke do powerple ke dauraan 3 khilaadiyon ko 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar rakhane kaa vikalp chun saktaa he
 This rule was implemented in the match played between Sri Lanka and England at Dambulla Stadium on 1 October 2007
 srilanka 119 ranon se yah match jeeta
 Currently during the second and third powerplays, 3 players stand outside the 30-yard radius and are selected by a powerplay batting team

 Prior to the toss, the teams nominated their replacement player, known as the Supersub
 supersab ballebaaji, gendbaazim kshetrarakshan yaa wicket keeping kar saktaa tha; pratisthapit khilaadi khel main aage bhaag nahin le saktaa tha
 In the six months since it was implemented, it became largely clear that the supersub was more beneficial to the team that won the toss, creating an imbalance in the game
 2005 main is niyam ko khatm karne ke liye kai antarrashtriya captainon ne "jentalman samjhauta" kiya
 They continued to nominate Supersub as required, but were not fielded

 Bangladesh has since attained Test status and full membership; But because of Kenya's poor performance, the ICC has decided to end their permanent one-day international status

 Mizoram Lok Sabha constituency is a Lok Sabha constituency in the state of Mizoram, India

 This Lok Sabha constituency covers the entire assembly constituency of the state of Mizoram
 si el ruala yahan ke vartmaan saansad hai
 He is affiliated to the Indian National Congress
 kaaran jo kaary ke purv main niyat rup se rahata he or anyathaasiddhi na ho use kaaran nahin kehete hai
 Just by being in the forefront of the work does not lose its causality, it should also be the interviewing partner in the production of the work
 anyathaasiddh main un tathakthith kaarnon kaa samavesh hota he jo kaary kii utpatti ke purv rahete hai par kaary ke utpaadan main saakshaat upyogi nahin he
 Just as the potter's father or the donkey carrying the soil is indebted to work
 kaary-kaaran-sambandh anyavyatirek par aadhaarit he
 Work happens when there is a reason, there is no work if there is no reason
 prakruti main praaia: kaary-kaaran-sambandh spasht nahin rahata
 There are many reasons for a task
 hamen un anek dikhaai denevaale kaarnon main se vaastavik kaaran foondnaa padataa he
 For this, one has to carefully remove the reasons for each visible action and see if the work is generated
 yadi kaary utpann hota he to jisko hataaya gaya he vah kaaran nahin he
 What remains in the end is believed to be the real reason
 yah mana gaya he ki yah kaary kaa ek hi kaaran hota he anyathaa anumaan kii pramanikta nasht ho jaaegi
 If there are many causes of dhoom, then it would be wrong to predict fire by dhoom
 jahaan anek kaaran dikhaai dete hai vahaan kaary kaa vishleshan karne par maaloom hoga ki kaary ke anek avyav kaaran ke anek avyavon se utpann hai
 Thus, there can be a causal relationship with the work
 kaaranvishesh ke samooh se kaarivishesh ke samooh kaa utpann maananaa bhul he
 In fact, many factors in a group form do not generate work in a particular group
 ve alag-alag hi kaarivishesh ke kaaran hai
 There can be two kinds of fixed living before work
 kaaran kaary ke utpaadan ke pehle to rahata he parantu kaary ke us kaaran se pruthak utpann hota he
 The reason remains cooperative only in the production of new work
 mitti se gadaa banataa he at: mitti ghade kaa kaaran he or vah kumhaar bhi jo mitti ko ghade kaa rup detaa he
 Before the potter's trade, the soil was clay and the pitcher had no existence
 kumhaar ke sahyog se ghade kii utpatti hoti he at: gadaa naveen kaary he jo pehle kabhi nahin tha
 This theory is called Initialism
 kaaran naveen kaary kaa aarambhk hota he, kaaran swayan kaary rup main parinat nahin hota
 Although soil, potter, chalk etc
 are helpful in the production of work, these are not separate works and neither pitcher is produced in collaboration with all these but it is the most unique achievement
 avyavon se avyavi pruthak satta he; isi siddhant ke aadhaar par aarambhvaad kaa pravartan hota he
 In Indian philosophy, jurisprudential advocates of this principle
 kaary kaa kaaran ke saath sambandh duusari drushti se bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 a pitcher is made from clay, so the pitcher exists in a latent form
 yadi mitti na ho to chunki ghade kii avyakt sthiti nahin he at: gadaa utpann nahin hota
 Can be caused by a particular feature
 yadi kaary kaaran se bhinn naveen satta ho to koi vastu kisi kaaran se utpann ho sakati he
 Oil does not come out of sand instead of sesame because a rule of power is working in nature
 satta se hi satta kii utpatti hoti he
 Satya cannot be born of discrete - it will be contrary to the law of nature
 sankhyayog kaa yah siddhant parinamwad kehalaata he
 According to this, reason is transformed into action, so reason is essentially not separate from work
 in donon maton se bhinn ek mat or he jo na to kaaran ko aarambhk maanata he or na parinami
 The reason is tradeless power
 usamen kaary kii utpatti ke liye koi vyapaar nahin hota
 The reason is the embodied element
 parantu kutasthata ke hote hue bhi kaary utpann hota he
 The reason is the embodied element
 parantu kutasthata ke hote hue bhi kaary utpann hota he kyonki drashtaa ko agyaan aadi bahya oopaadhiyon ke kaaran kutasth kaaran apane shuddh rup main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Just as in the case of confusion, there is knowledge of the snake instead of a rope, similarly action appears in the place of reason
 at: karankarya kaa bhed tathvik bhed nahin he
 This distinction is formal
 is mat ko, jo advait vedant main sweekrut he, vivartvaad kehete hai
 In Initialism, the causes of work are different, in consequentialism, there is a distinction between the latent-expressed-state, despite not having an elemental distinction, but in tectarianism there is neither an elemental distinction nor a state
 kaary kaaran kaa bhed bhrant bhed he or bhram se jaayman kaary vastut: asat he
 As long as the vision is corrupted, then in practical condition they both appear separate
 drushtidosh kaa vilay hote hi kaary kaa vilay or kaaran ke shuddh rup ke gyaan kaa udai hota he
 Three genres of reason have been considered
 upadan kaaran vah kaaran he jisamen samavaay sambandh se rahakar kaary utpann hota he

 Human beings get all these pleasures with great difficulty

 chanakya kehete hai ki jis vyakti kaa putr uske niyantran main rahata he, jisaki patni ajna ke anusaar aacharan karti he or jo vyakti apane kamaaye dhan se puri tarah santusht rahata he

 So if they do something wrong then it is not appropriate to ignore and be pampered

 There should be no doubt in this
 16
 chanakya kehete hai ki jis tarah veshya dhan ke samaapt hone par purush se munh mode leti he
 Similarly, when the king becomes powerless, the subjects leave him

 When the guest is fully welcomed, he also leaves the house

 You should ask Maharaj to arrange the land covered with leather
 isse logon ko aaraam hoga
 After listening to him, Chanakya said with a smile, "sir, laying the leather here will not solve the problem
" contile va patharile path to is vishwa main anginat hai
 In such a situation, it is impossible to lay leather all over the world
 haa, yadi aap log chamade dwaara apane pairon ko surakshit kar len to avashya hi patharile path va contili jhaadiyon ke prakope se batch sakate hai
 'that person bowed his head and said,' Yes guruji, i will do the same now
 ’ After this Chanakya said, 'look, there is a deep essence behind this thing of mine
 dusron ko sudhaarney ke bajaay khud ko sudhaaro
 With this you will definitely get victory in your work
 duniya ko naseehat dene vaala kuch nahin kar paata jabaki uskaa swayan paalan karne vaala kamyaabi kii bulandiyon tak pahunch jaataa he

 rajdoot chanakya ke vyavhaar se prasann hua
 In the evening when he started asking about 'amatya Niwas' in the Rajmahal complex
 raaj prahari ne bataaya- acharya chanakya to nagar ke baahar rahete hai
 The Ambassador thought that perhaps the General Minister would have a beautiful palace built on the lake outside the city
 rajdoot nagar ke baahar pahuncha
 Asked a citizen where to live Chanakya
 ek kutiyaa kii ore ishaara karte hue naagarik ne kaha-dekhie, vah saamne mahaamantri kii kutiyaa he
 The ambassador was surprised
 usne kutiyaa main pahunchakar chanakya ke paanv chhue or shikaayat kii-aap jaisaa chatur mahaamantri ek kutiyaa main rahata he
