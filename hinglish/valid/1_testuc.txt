2% to 6
7% per year
 haalanki aspirin raktasrav se hone vaale mastishakaghat or anya bade rakthasraavon ke jokham ko doguna kar detii he, aisi ghatnaayen but kam hoti hai or aspirin ke prabhaav kul mila kar sakaaratmak hote hai
 Thus, secondary prevention studies reduced aspirin mortality by 10 percent
 aise logon main jo hradvahinirogon se grast nahin hai, aspirin ke laabh spasht nahin hai
 In primary prevention experiments, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of stroke and reduced blood flow by 10 percent

 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure located outside the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at 'chhatragarh' on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town’s people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seathat had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 km north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important centre of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra" 
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed
 Fateh Muhammed in turn was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block
 Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and Saints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects
 “gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train
 He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty
 It is because of the beauty that arrests him much ”

 The three hydrological sub-systems control the hydrology of the lake
 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack,feed the lake
 61% ) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non – perennial accounts for 39%)
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1
76 cubic meters including direct precipitation over the lake about 0
87 cubic meters All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about 0
375 million cubic meters of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake
 On the north east a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal
 a tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake
 The lake experiences South–west and North-east monsoons during June to September and November to December respectively with average annual rainfall of 1,238
8 mimi, with 72 rainy days
 The maximum temperature of 39
9 °se
 and minimum temperature of 14 °se

 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have “undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes
 In summary, upstream silt led to a serious negative impact on habitat for wildlife and fishery resources, all of which led to shrinkage of the water surface area, salinity and lack of prolific growth of invasive freshwater aquatic weeds
 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority 
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people's representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the bharat sarkaar, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of "special problem grants" recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake's fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometre 
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in increasing the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species identified are green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, Spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat 
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one – fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species are identified:
 Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent
 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, india n roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997-98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were seen in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officers counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island In the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 kimi2 
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority's updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk developed exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British rule, in 1897–98, fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen's cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson 
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 dravyaman in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11,878 dravyaman during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India and one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were seen in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 kimi2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 october–january and may–june are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum 600-700 per day during december–january
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanized boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands

 The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again
 The vast lake harbors 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants
 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector

 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 km from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake’s natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata via National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 km by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 km ॰ from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake

 jin nrity shaileyon main kalaripayattu ke tatv dekhe jate hai, ve hai kolkali, welkali tathaa yatrakali
 It is very interesting that born in the royal family of India, "rajpat-leaving" to become a Buddhist-monk, "bodhidharma" took this Kalaripayattu art to China in the fifth century
 is kala ko sikhaane ke liye unhone shavolin mandir chunaa
 In chronology, Kalaripayattu gave birth to martial arts like judo, karate and kung-fu
 china ke log ise zyada sikhte hai or "aatmaraksha" ke liye is vidha ko apanaate hai
 lekin isse yah to sabit nahin hota he ki kungphu china kii hi khoj ho
 saint-bodhidharma is said to be the father of "kung-fu"
 There are many temples built in Shaolin, China after him
 So it has been speculated that Saint Bodhidharma went to China during the 6th century
 China did not exist at that time, the saints had gone to give knowledge of Buddhism to the people living on the other side of the Himalayan Mountains of Hindkush

 But it is certain that wherever Bodhidharma went, he took a unique form of martial art with him
 As you can see Kaliripayattu in Kerala right now
 Bodhidharma stayed in the new temple in Sholin and dedicated his life to this art along with other Buddhist saints

 The poet, who received the Sahitya Akademi Award, has also written critiques in addition to poetry, has also done translation work and has also edited the well-known literary magazine Criticism for a long time
 arun camel kaa vaastavik naam 'arun kumaar' he
 For literary writing, he adopted the name 'arun Kamal' and this name has become his natural identity
 unka janm 15 farvari 1954 i0 ko bihar ke rohtas jile ke nasriganj main hua tha
 By profession, he is a professor in the English Department of Patna University
 arun camel saathottaree lekhan kaa arajak daur chuk jane ke baad sakriy pramukh kaviyon main se ek hai
 Eminent as the year of his return to poetry, his first book 'apni Kewal Dhar' was published in 1980 and this book established him as an important poet of the contemporary era
 is pustak kii 'dhar' sheershak kavita kii pankti har pathak kii jubaan par ankit ho gayi- Despite being a proletariat for the common people, this line, giving easy artistic introduction of the inherent inner strength and possibility of change, became very popular
 san 1989 main unka doosraa sangrah 'saboot' prakashit hua or 1996 main teesraa sangrah 'naye ilaake main' jiske liye unhen sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Apart from poetry, Arun Kamal has also written critical essays from time to time, made statements and commented on various topics
 vastutah ve mukhya rup se kavi hi hai evam aalochana unke lekhan kaa anivaary ang nahin he
 They consider any additional motivation necessary for self-critical writing
 unke anusaar "bina niyamit patrika yaa santhaan ke aalochana kaa poshan kathin he
 Criticism is always outdoor sports
 " iske baavjood ve jab bhi aalochanatmak lekhan ko apanaate hai to puri gambhirtha se apanaate hai
 The style of his critical venture is completely different from that of professional critics

 His criticism "saves the informal kind of criticism from the prevalent word-stereotypes and enters the sensitive structure of the poem and brings it to the surface of instinctive feeling
" sach kaha jaae to arun camel kii aalochana jivan-dharmi rachana kii pahchaan ke liye sakriy-sannaddh aalochana he
 As such, no work is ever anti-life, but if it is not connected to concrete social intent, it can lead the reader to abstract situations
 arun camel ke liye rachana kii jeevandharmita kaa arth he uski saamaajik samprikti
 " yahi kaaran he ki arun camel ek vishisht vichaardhaara se sambaddh hone ke baavjood gutbandi ko sahitya ke liye sarvatha anupyukt maanate hai tathaa ek ore jahaan dow0 namvar singh ke prati atyadhik sahanubhuti vyakt karte hue unhen 'hindi ke hit kaa abhimaan' maanate hai vahiin duusari ore dow0 ramvilas sharma ko bhi bhartiya manisha kii amarta sweekaar karte hai
 Apart from Sharma ji's positive writings, Arun Kamal also has a clear belief in the context of his controversial writing that "ramvilas ji's writings and beliefs are invaluable and important of all the repulsions or 'controversies' he invites
 " Apart from original writing, Arun Kamal has also done translation work

 a dynamo is basically another name for an electric generator
 aamtaur par iskaa taatpary ek janarator yaa janitr se hota he jo commutator ke upyog se disht dhara utpann karata he
 Dynamos were the first electric generators capable of producing electric power for industry
 dianemo ke siddhant ke aadhaar par hi baad main kai anya vidyut utpaadan karne vaale roopantarak upkarnon kaa vikaas hua, jisamen vidyut motor, prayavarti dhara janitr or rotary conwarter shaamil hai
 They are seldom used for power generation at the present time, as the dominance of alternating current has increased today, the commutator is not as profitable and the alternating current can be easily converted to direct current using solid state methods
 is
 aaj bhi kisi-kisi sthiti main 'dianemo' shabd kaa upyog janarator ke liye kai sthanon par kiya jaataa he
 a small power generator, which is built into the hub of a cycle wheel to produce light, is called a 'hub dynamo', although these are always alternating current devices
 dianemo main ghurnan karti hui taron kii kundali or chumbakeey kshetra kaa upyog karke yantric ghurnan kii urja ko farade ke niyam ke anusaar disht vidyut dhara main roopaantarit kiya jaataa he
 The dynamo has a stable structure, called a 'stator', which provides a constant magnetic field
 tathaa ghurnan karti hui windings kaa ek set hota he, jo armechar kehalaata he, yah chumbakeey kshetra main teji se ghumta he
 The motion of the wire in the magnetic field causes a force on the electrons present in the metal, causing an electric current in the wire
 choti mashiinon main sthir chumbakeey kshetra ko ek yaa adhik sthaayee chumbakon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayaa ja saktaa he; badi mashiinon main sthir chumbakeey kshetra ek yaa adhik vidyut chumbakon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he, jise aamtaur par kshetra kundali kaha jaataa he
 The commutator was required to produce direct current
 jab taar kaa ek loop ek chumbakeey kshetra main ghurnan karata he, isamen utpann prerit vibhav prayek aadhe ghurnan ke baad ulat jaataa he, jiske parinamswaroop prayavarti dhara kaa utpaadan hota he
 However, in the early days of electrical experiments, there was no known use of alternating current
 vidyut ke kuch upyogon jaise vidyut lepan main, taral badariyon kii sahaayta se disht dhara kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 The dynamo was invented as a replacement for the battery
 commutator mote taur par ek rotary switch hota he
 It consists of a set of contacts mounted on the shaft of the machine, which are joined with graphite-block stationary contacts, called "brushes", as the first such type of contacts were metal brushes
 jab vibhav ulatata he, commutator bahya paripath ke liye windings conection ko ulat detaa he, isliye prayavarti dhara ke bajaay, nirantar ek disht dhara kaa utpaadan hota he
 The first electric generator was invented in 1831 by Michael Faraday, a copper disc mounted between the poles of the magnet
 yah dianemo nahin tha kyonki isamen commutator kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya tha
 However, Faraday's disc produced very low voltage because only one path of electric current was flowing in the magnetic field
 farade or anya logon ne paaya ki agar taar ko kai baar ghumaakar kundali bana di jaye to yah winding, ucch or adhik upyogi voltage utpann kar sakati he
 Any desired voltage can be easily obtained by changing the number of circles in the wire windings
 isliye isi visheshta kaa upyog baad ke janarator ke sabhi diginon main kiya gaya, bas disht dhara ke utpaadan ke liye commutator ke avishkaar kii aavashyaktaa thi
 In 1827, Hungary's Anios Jedic began experimenting with electromagnetic rotor devices, which he called electromagnetic self-rotors
 In the prototype of a pole electric starter, both the stationary and rotating parts were electromagnetic
 unhone dianemo kii avadharana cemens or wheatstone se lagbhag chah saal pehle di thi, lekin unhone ise patent nahin karaayaa kyonki unhone sochaa ki ve aisa karne vaale pehle vyakti nahin hai
 Instead of permanent magnets in their dynamo, two electromagnets opposite each other were used, which induced magnetic fields around the rotor
 yah dianemo swa-preran kii siddhant kii khoj bhi thi
 The first dynamo based on Faraday's theory was created in 1832 by Hippolyte Pixi, a French equipment manufacturer
 isamen ek sthaayee chumbak kaa upyog kiya gaya tha jo ek crank ke dwaara ghurnan karti thi
 The rotating magnet was positioned such that a piece of iron wrapped in an insulating wire passed between its northern and southern poles
 piksi ne paaya ki har baar jab dhruv or kundali ek duusare ke paas se hokar guzarate hai, taar main vidyut dhara kaa aaveg utpann hota he
 However, the north and south poles of the magnet induce current in opposite directions
 prayavarti dhara ko disht dhara main roopaantarit karne ke liye, piksi ne commutator kii khoj kii, yah shaft par ek vibhajit dhaatu kaa belan tha, jisamen dhaatu ke do spring sampark shaft ke donon or the
 There was a problem with these early designs: the electric current generated by them consisted of a series of "impulses" of current that were not at all distinct from each other, resulting in lower average power output
 isi tarah se us samay kii vidyut motor main, diziner chumbakeey paripath main bade vaayu antaraal ke gambhir hanikaarak prabhaav ko puri tarah se samaj nahin paae
 bhautikee ke ek italvi profesar, antonio pacinoti ne 1860 ke dashak main is samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya
 For this, they replaced the rotating bi-polar axial coil with a multi-polar toroid coil
 toroid banane ke liye unhone lohe kii ek ring par lagaataar windings lapetin or ring ke chaaron taraf baraabar duuri ke binduon par ise commutator se jod diya; isse commutator kai khandon main vibhajit ho gaya
 This meant that some part of the coil was continuously passing through the magnet, causing the current to be continuous
 dianemo ke pehle vyaavhaarik diginon kii ghoshnaa alag alag or ek saath dow warner cemens or charles wheatstone ke dwaara kii gayi
 On 17 January 1867, Siemens announced a "dynamo-electric machine" at the Berlin Academy, using self-generating electromagnetic field coils instead of permanent magnets to generate stator fields
 usee din charles wheatstone ne royal socity main ek paper padhate hue isi tarah ke ek dizin kii ghoshnaa kii, inamen antar yah tha kii cemens ke dizin main stater vidyut chumbak roter ke saath shrinkhalaa main the, jabaki wheatstone ke dizin main ye saamanantar the
 The use of electromagnets instead of permanent magnets greatly increases the rate of power generation of a dynamo and thus the first time high energy is produced
 is avishkaar kaa upyog sidhe bade str par vidyut ke bade audyogic utpaadan ke liye kiya gaya
 For example, in the 1870s Siemens used an electromagnetic dynamo to produce electric arc furnaces for the production of metals and other materials
 xenobe gram ne 1871 main pehle vyavsaayik power plant kaa dizin banaate samay pacinoti ke dizin ko phir se khoja, jise 1870 ke dashak main paris main sanchalit kiya gaya
 Another advantage of Gram's design was that it used a better flux for the magnetic flux, for this the magnetic field space was filled with heavy iron cores and the air gaps between the stationary and the rotating parts
 Been reduced to a minimum
 gram kaa dianemo pehali mashin thi jo udyog ke liye vyavsaayik maatra main vidyut shakti kaa utpaadan kar sakati thi
 Improvements were later made on the gram ring, but the basic concept of the endless loop of rotating wire has been retained in all modern dynamos
 charles epa brush ne 1876 main apana pehla dianemo sankalit kiya, jisamen ghode ke dwaara khinchi jane vaali treadmill kaa upyog shakti utpaadan ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 US Patent # 189997 "improvement in Magnetic Electro Machines" was issued on 24 April 1877
 brush ne gram ke mul dizin se shuruyaat kii, jisamen taaren said main thim or ring kaa aantarik bhaag kshetra ke prabhavi zone se baahar tha or atyadhik ushma ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya
 To improve this design, the shape of his ring armature was made in the form of a disc while Gram's armature was cylindrical
 kshetra vidyut chumbakon ko paridhi ke chaaron ore rakhane ke bajaay armechar discs ke parshv main rakhaa gaya
 Four electromagnets were used, two with the North Pole and two with the South Pole
 saamaan dhruv ek dusre ke vipareet rakhe gaye, inhen discs armechar ke prayek said par rakhaa gaya
 a dynamo of the Brush Electric Company in 1881; Recorded 89 inches long, 28 inches wide and 36 inches high, it weighed 4800 pounds and ran at a speed of about 700 rotations per minute
 is us samay duniya kaa sabase bada dianemo mana gaya
 It used 40 arc lights and required 36 horsepower
 haalanki mul rup se ise uddeshy ke liye dizin nahin kiya gaya tha, yah paaya gaya ki ek dianemo vidyut motor kaa kaam kar saktaa he jab ise bydaree yaa kisi duusare dianemo se disht dharaa kii aapurti kii jaye
 1873 main vienna main ek audyogic pradarshnee main, gram ne paaya ki uske dianemo kaa shaft ghoomane laga jab iske terminal ko galati se vidyut utpaadan karne vaale ek duusare dianemo se jod diya gaya
 Although this was not the first demonstration of an electric motor, it was the first practical demonstration
 yah paaya gaya ki dizin main ek hi tarah kii visheshtaayen jo dianemo ko prabhavi banaati hai, ve motor ko bhi prabhavi banaati hai, gram kaa prabhavi dizin, jisamen chote chumbakeey vaayu antaraal the or taar kii kai kundaliyon ko kai-vibhajit commutator se joda gaya tha, vah sabhi vyavhaarik disht dhara motaron ke dizin kaa aadhaar ban gaya
 Large dynamos producing direct current were problematic in situations where two or more dynamos are working simultaneously and one engine is running at a lower power than the other
 kam kshamta ke ingine ke ghurnan ke bajaay, adhik kshamta ke ingine vaala dianemo kam kshamta ke ingine vaale dianemo ko chalaane lagata he jaise yah motor ho
 Such reverse driving causes the dynamo engine to run and dangerous low-spinning conditions can occur in low-capacity dynamos that go out of control
 ant main yah paaya gaya ki jab kai dianemo ko ek saath isi tarah kii power ke strot se joda jaataa he, to ve sabhi injanon ko jodne vaale jaikashaft kaa upyog karte hue ek saath chalane lagate hai or roter main ye asantulan utpann ho jate hai
 After the discovery of the AC generator, when the alternating current could actually be used at any location, the term dynamo became specifically used to refer to a direct current power generator with a commutator, while a alternating current generator would have a slip ring or The rotor magnet was used, called the alternator
 asi vidyut motor jisamen slip ring yaa roter chumbak kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, use tulykaalik motor kaha jane laga or commutator se yukt disht dhara motor ko vidyut motor bhi kaha jane laga, haalanki yah baat samajhi ja chuki thi ki yah janarator kii tarah ke siddhant par hi kaam karti he
 When dynamos and motors began to easily convert mechanical and electrical energy into one another, they were used jointly in a device called a rotary converter, a rotating machine not intended to produce electric power
 
 balki yah ek prakaar kii vidyut dhara ko duusare prakaar main roopantarit karti he, udhaaharan ke liye prayavarti dhara ko disht dhara main
 ye bahu kshetreey ek roter vaale upkaran the, jinamein ghoomane vaale samparkon ke do yaa adhik set hote the, inamen se ek upkaran ko ghumaane ke liye armechar winding ke ek set ko shakti pradaan karata tha or ek yaa adhik ko output dhara ke utpaadan ke liye anya windings se joda jaataa tha
 The rotary converter can directly, internally, convert any type of power to another type
 isamen prayavarti dhara or disht dhara ke bich roopantaran, teen phase or ek phase kii shakti ke bich roopantaran, 25 Hz AC or 60 Hz AC, yaa ek hi samay par kai anya bhinn output voltage ke bich roopantaran shaamil he
 The size and weight of the rotor was large so that the rotor could act as a flywheel and provide continuous power even when there was a sudden change in the power being supplied
 praroopik rotary convarters kaa upyog aaj bhi manahattan main west id iarti subway main kiya jaataa he
 In the late 1960s and possibly a few years later
 They were powered by 25 Hz acs and provided 600 volts of direct current for trains
 rotary convarters kii praudyogiki ko 20 veen sadi ke prarambh main marakari-vaper ractifire ke dwaara pratisthapit kar diya gaya, jo chote the, kampan or shor utpann nahin karte the or inhen kam rakrakhaav kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 a similar conversion work is currently performed by solid state power semiconductor devices
 dianemo kaa upyog aaj bhi kam kshamta ke utpaadan main kiya jaataa he, vishesh rup se jahaan kam voltage kii disht dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki in anuprayogon main ek ardhchaalak ractifire se yukt alternetr aprabhavi hota he
 Hand-cranked dynamos are used in clockwork radios, handheld flash lights, mobile phone rechargers and other human-powered devices to recharge batteries

 The small events of his life reveal his qualities related to the observance of time and speech

 When one of the disciples of Raidas urged them to walk too, they said, i must walk for Ganga-bathing, but today i have promised to make shoes for a person
 yadi main use aaj juute nahin de sakaa to vachan bhang hoga
 When Ganga goes to bathe, if the mind remains here then how will it attain virtue? It is advisable to do whatever the mind is prepared to do with the inner conscience
 man sahi he to ise kathaute ke jal main hi gangasnan kaa punya praapt ho saktaa he
 It is said that after this kind of practice, the proverb became popular - that if the mind is healed, the Ganges is in disarray

 Ved Qateb saw Quran, Puranan, Sahaj one
 
 He believed that devotion to God, observance of virtue, goodwill and good behavior is essential
 abhimaan tyaag kar dusron ke saath vyavhaar karne or vinamrata tathaa shishtataa ke gunon kaa vikaas karne par unhone bahut bal diya
 In one of his hymns, he has said- kah raidas teri bhagati doori he, bhaag bade so paavai
 On the public pride mete, the public is selected
 unke vichaaron kaa aashay yahi he ki ishwar kii bhakthi bade bhagya se praapt hoti he
 a person working without pride is successful in life, as the giant elephant is unable to pick up the sugar particles, while the small body papilla easily selects these particles
 isi prakaar abhimaan tathaa badppan kaa bhav tyaag kar vinamratapurvak aacharan karne vaala manushya hi ishwar kaa bhakt ho saktaa he
 Raidas's voice was filled with true feelings of devotion, desire for the larger interest of society and human love
 isliye uskaa shrotaaon ke man par gaharaa prabhaav padataa tha
 His hymns and sermons gave people such education that a satisfactory solution to their doubts was made and people automatically became their followers

 It is said that Meerabai was very impressed by his devotion and became his disciple

 unhone apane aacharan tathaa vyavhaar se yah pramanit kar diya he ki manushya apane janm tathaa vyavsaay ke aadhaar par mahaan nahin hota he
 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai
 Raidas Manush could not join till caste was formed
