 The rest of the body consists of about 12 segments, of which the first three segments each have a pair of legs
 chauthaa tathaa inke pechhevaale khand bhi bina taangon ke nahin hote
 But their growth is hindered and they remain very small
 is prakaar yah chah taangon vaala aiulas kaa dimbh ant main lanbaa praudh ban jaataa he, jiske sharir main bahut se khand or bahut si taange hoti he
 If the growth of the legs after the first three pairs of this egg is more hindered and about 12 sections of the body of the egg persist in adulthood, then this organism will be insect-shaped, with the legs behind the first three pairs of legs being either so weak
 That only their remains will be or they will be completely lost
 yah baat bahut hi rochak he ki vastav main aise keet hai jinamein udar par bhi taangon ke avshesh vartmaan hote hai, jaise campodia, jepix or machilis 
 These insects do not have favors, and they contain compositions that have disappeared from other insects, such as gonation of the gonads
 isliye kiton ke vikaas main in kiton ko miriapoda ke dimbhavstha main janane vaale dimbhon or anya kiton kii madhyavaali dasha kaa samajhnaa chahie
 It is also approved by many other arguments that insects originated from figures like Miriyapoda
 atyadhik sambhaavna yah he ki un sab lambey sharir or tongowale jeevon main miriapoda hi kiton ke purvaj hai, kyonki in main kai rachanaayen ek-si hoti hai udaahranarth, malepigian nalikaay or trekial nalikaay
 But it should also be noted that the insects could not have originated from the adult myriapoda, as they have many characteristics and characteristics
 epterigota upvarg adhiktar vividh prakaar ke kiton kaa ek samooh he or us upvarg kaa keval thisaneura gana hi terrigot kiton kii vikasawali mukhya shrenee ke sambhavat: sameep he
 It has been proved by logic that the remaining three gonas of Apertigota should not be considered insects
 kintu aisa koi santoshjanak kaaran prathit nahin hota he, jisase in teenon ganon ko is upvarg se pruthak kar diya jaae, yadhyapi isamen koi andeh nahin ki ye vilakshan rachanaayen pradarshit karte hai, udaahranarth colembola gana ke kiton main keval nau khand hi hote hai
 Anemorphosis occurs in the pests of the protura gana, the diplora, asymptomatic tracheal system found in the pests of gana, the muscles in the flagellum of the genus Dipura and colombala
 upvarg terrigota do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he-exopterigota or endopterigota 
 Exopterigota Ganes have a close relationship between Epimeraptra and Odoneta, as they are both palaepteron, Ganes
 yadi aadhunik kiton ke sharir ke siddhant se vichaar kiya jaay to blatteria, mantodia, isoptera, joreptra, gailoblattodia, ri jupaj, phesemida, plicoptera, dermaptra or ambioptra ri jupakshika orthoptred, samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 All of these properties form a community due to the following characteristics — unchanged mouthpiece, a pair of mustard on the posterior end of the giant anel lobe in the posterior, numberless malipagian tubules and several distinct tufts in the peritoneal nerve
 in ganon main se blatteria or mantodia main bahut adhik nikat sambandh hone ke kaaran in donon ko saath-saath dicteoptera ke antargat rakhte hai
 The remaining ganas of Exopterigota, namely Socoptera, Malophaga, Cyphanculata, Matkungana and Jallaripaksha, belong to the Matkunganik community
 matkunaganik samudaay ke lakshan is prakaar he: vishesh prakaar ke mandibulate yaa chusanevaale mukhbhaag hote hai, pashchapaksh main anelle lob nahin paaya jaataa, sarasai kaa abhaav hota he
 The number of malpigian tubules is very small, and the peritoneal nerves are almost collected
 ri jupakshik or matkunaganik samudaayon main spasht bhed nahin hai, kyonki joreptra main pakshon kii shirayen kuch ksheen ho jaati he, mailipigiyan nalikaaon kii sankhya bhi kam hoti he or tantrikatantu kii gucchhikaaye bhi kuch kuch ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There seems to be a clear relationship between Socoptera and Malophaga, as both have eccentric types of hypopharyx
 sambhavat: simonculeta mellophayga se nikat sambandh rakhte hai
 With them, they not only have an analogy in many external and internal creations and nature, but there is also an analogy in the composition of the breath and the process of hatching
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki junon ke donon ganon ko ek hi gana ke antargat kyon nahin mana jaataa
 The reason for this is that there is so much difference between the faces of the two ganas
 ki inkaa pruthak pruthak ganon main rakhana hi praaia: uchit samajha jaataa he
 Considering Indopterygote pests, there is an extreme difficulty in keeping Kalapaksa, Strepsiptera and Kanchukapaksa with other Ganas, hence the rest of them are kept under Panorpid community
 panorapid samudaay jaalpaksh neuroptra ke saath micoptera par kendribhoot he or kuch kuch pruthak kintu sambandhi shakha banaata he
 It is more likely that the lower members of the Mikaptera originated on the one side as the bipartite and on the other side the Salki Paksha and Lomapaksha
 cyphonaptera ke praudhon kii rachana bahut bhinn hoti hai, kintu iske dimbh dwipaksh ke upagan nimetocera ke kuch dimbhon se bhinn nahin hote or yadi cyphonaptera kii utpatti aadi dwipakshon se na hui ho to kam se kam panorapid samudaay se to hui hi hogi
 There also seems to be some difficulty in the subject of acupuncture, ejaculate and strepsiptera
 kalapaksh ke upagan simphyta ke dimbh or panorapid kiton ke dimbhon main sadashya he, saath hi saath simphyta ke pakshon kii shira kii utpatti bina kisi kathinata ke, megacoptaran pattern se prathit hoti he
 For these two reasons it is also said that the ancestor of Kalapaksha and ancestors of jalapaksha and other panorpid villages were the same
 kanchuk paksh ke vishay main aisa vichaar he ki inaki utpatti anya indopterigot se bhinn rup main hui
 But some authors speculate that the origin of the Kanchukapaksha originated from the ancestors with a nettle shape
 strepciptera praaia: kanchukpaksh se sambandhit samajhe jate hai, kintu kuch lekhak inkaa sambandh kalapaksh ke nirdhaarit karte hai
 The insect keet The insect keet The insect keet Dialects speak such a particular form of a language that a different community uses among the people speaking that language
 aksar 'upbhasha' kisi bhashaa ke kshetreey prakaaron ko kaha jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye chhattisgadhi, haryaanavi, marwari, brajabhasha or khadiboli hindi kii kuch kshetreey upbhashaayen hai
 But sometimes the type of language used by a social class is also called 'dialect'
 kabhi-kabhi upbhasha ko boli bhi kehete hai, haalaanki yah shabd maanak bhashaaon ke liye bhi istemaal hota he
 a dialect is known by its grammar, vocabulary, accent and pronunciation
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak hindi or ruhelkhand kii khadiboli main shabdon or vyakaran kaa antar dikhataa he: Similarly, differences can be seen between the ordinary Punjabi language and the Hindu dialect of Punjabi: bhashavigyaan kaa ek kathan he ki 'fuj or nausena vaali upbhasha ko bhashaa kehete hai', yani agar kisi upbhasha ko bolne vaale apana rajya yaa samrajya banane main safal ho jaaen to use ek 'maanak bhashaa' kaa darja de dete hai or us se sambandhit anya boliyon ko us maanak bhashaa kii upbhasha kehane lagate hai
 By this process, standard Hindi is considered a language while Brajbhasha is called a sub-language
 aksar kisi boli ko upbhasha tab bulaayaa jaataa he jab: Chimbel is a census town located in the North Goa district of the Indian state of Goa
 bharat kii 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar, chimbel kii jansankhya 11,983 he

 'jyotish' shabd kaa arth he - jyoti, arthath prakashpunj, sambandhi vivechan
 Since ancient times, it has been aware of the knowledge, which is related to the discussion of celestial bodies, that is, the Grahanakshatras
 isamen khagoleey pindon kii sthiti, unke gatishastra tathaa unki bhautik rachana par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 In ancient times, the attention of human beings went towards these celestial bodies and he soon understood that from the position of the Grahanakshatras, he can get knowledge of problems, country and times
 sabase pehle uskaa dhyaan surya tathaa chandramaa kii ore gaya or unke saath hi un nakshatron kii ore jinhen vah sthir jaanata tha or jinaki prishthbhumi par vah surya or chandramaa kii gatiyon ko naap saktaa tha
 In particular, he studied areas that were around the Sun and Moon visible orbits

 While studying the zodiac, he saw some objects which looked like stars, but they were seen moving towards the east with respect to the stars
 inkaa naam usne grah rakhaa
 The earth is considered stable and gained knowledge of five eye view planets including the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn
 isi se saptaah ke saat vaaron kaa naam padaa or us panchagapaddati kaa janm hua jo abhi tak chali aa rahi he
 Some countries of the world, especially India and Greece, had acquired so much knowledge by the first or second century of Christ

 Modern astrology originated from Copernicus' theory of the solar centric system, Galilean visionaries, Kepler's strident dynamics, and Newton's broader gravitational theories
 siddhant kii drushti se ham jyotish ko teen bhaagon main baant sakate hai : By this, the relative position of any celestial body relative to the grounded seer is determined
 iske liye ham ek bhukendrik sthir khagol kii kalpana karte hai
 If the axis of the Earth is extended in its direction, it will be called the astronomical pole where it is placed in the astro
 khagol ke us vrutt ko, jo khagoleey dhruv tathaa shirobindu se hokar jaayga, yamyottar vrutt kahenge
 If the arc of 90o from the meridians is cut on both sides of the arc, then the circle of the astronomies going from those points will be called the celestial horizon and the midpoint of the meridian, which is towards the celestial pole, the north point and the sidepoint of the other side
 yadi khagoleey dhruv se yamyottar ke donon ore 90o ko chaap katkar unase kisi khagoleey vrutt ko khinchen, to use khagoleey vishuvadvrutt kehete hai
 The visible orbit of the Sun or the actual orbit of the Earth is called the ecliptic
 krantivrutt tathaa khagoleey vishuvad vrutt se 23o 28' kaa kone banaata he
 The equator of the ecliptic and the celestial equator is called the equator
 jis vishuvabindu par surya lagbhag 21 march ko dikhaai padataa he
 It is called Vasantvishuv
 kisi bhi khagoleey pind kii sthiti uske nirdeshaankon se gyaat heti he
 It is necessary for coordinates to have a root point, the sphere of the astron on which that point is, the pole of the sphere, and a wealth of coordinates, knowledge of the minus directions
 maan len, hamen kisi taare ke niamak gyaat karne hai
 If the intended star will draw a right angled atop the meteoroid and the celestial equator, then assuming the positive direction on the circle from the vertex and the equator to the west, the fraction of the arc will be its angle and the right angled circle from the origin of the right angle to the right angled circle
 The arc of k is called revolution
 kranti yadi khagoleey dhruv kii ore he to, dhan anyathaa rin, hogi
 If the spring equals the radius and draws a right-angled circle from the celestial pole to the equator, then the number of arcs in the clockwise direction from the equator to the origin of the rhombus will be called equinox
 vishuvaansh tathaa kranti ke dwaara bhi khagoleey pind kii sthiti kaa gyaan hota he
 This coordinate method is very important
 yadi shirobindu se isht khagoleey pind par samakon vrutt khinche to uttarbindu se ghadi kii sooyee kii disha main khagoleey kshitij vrutt tathaa samakonvrutt ke sampaat kii duuri digansh tathaa samakon vrutt ke chaap kii kshithijavrutt se khagoleey pind tak duuri unnataansh hogi
 If you draw a right angled from the pole of the ecliptic above the star, the one where the ecliptic is connected to here is called the annulus of the degrees of the arc of the ecliptic in the direction of the spring curve and the clockwise needle, and the angle of the arc of the ellipsoid from the intersection to the star
 isi dhan disha kranti kii tarah hogi
 If we take the equator of the equator and the celestial equator of the galaxy in place of the equatorial equator and the pole of the equator of the galaxy in place of the pole of the ecliptic, we will get the galactic geodes and deflections
 yadi vasantvishuv ko sthir maan len, to surya ke vasantbindu se chalakar pun: vahaan pahunchne ke samay ko nakshatra varsh kehete hai
 It is 365

 The celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun are members of the solar family
 inamen grah, upgrah, kshudragrah, ghumaketu tathaa ulkaaye hai
 Those celestial small solid bodies that revolve around a star, especially the Sun, are planets
 saura parivaar ke grah hai : budh, shukr, prithvi, mangal, guru shani, vaaruni tathaa varun 
 Among these, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Yama are small and Guru, Varuni and Varuna are huge
 budh tathaa shukr kii kakshaayen surya ke saapeksh prithvi kii kaksha ke bheetar padati he
 Hence, it is called ingestion
 shesh bahirgrah hai
 The planets travel in elliptical orbits, which have the Sun in one navel
 donon nabhiyon se paridhi tak janevaali saral rekha ko deergh aksh tathaa dirghavritt ke centre se deergh aksh par lamb rekha ke paridhi paryant bhaag ko laghu aksh kehete hai
 The point of the ellipse circumference that lies on the long axis near the Sun is called Ravnich, and the point which is on the other side of the long axis is called the sunrise
 deergh aksh par suryocch tathaa ravinich sthiti hai, isaliye ise nichoch rekha kehete hai
 The angle of circumference of the Sun at the navel from Ravnich is called the angular angle
 grah ke ravinich athwa suryocch ke saapeksh parikrama kaal ko parivarsh kehete hai
 The orbits of the planets are not in the surface of the ecliptic, but are inclined to it
 grah kii kaksha tathaa krantivrutt ke sampatbindu ko paat kehete hai
 The point from where the planet moves upwards from the ecliptic is called Arohpath and the second Avarohpat
 akaash main grah kii sthiti jaanane ke liye hamen grah kaa deergh aksh, utkendratha, kaksha kii krantivrutt se nati, nirdeshkshan, suryocch kii sthiti tathaa paat kii sthiti kaa gyaan karnaa aavashyak he
 Two types of movements of rotation and rotation are found in the planets
 ek to ve apane kaksha main chalate hue surya kii parikrama karte hai, ise unka parikraman kehete hai
 When a planet revolves around the Sun relative to a star, it is called its Nakshatra period
 grah ke prithvi ke saapeksh parikraman kaal ko sanyuti kaal kehete hai
 The inhabitants of the Earth are seen to have an outward movement orbiting the Earth, but the inertia is seen oscillating east and west from the Sun
 yah unki kakshaon kii vishesh sthiti ke kaaran he
 The angular distance from the Sun relative to the Earth is called the extreme canopy
 jab antargrah surya tathaa prithvi ko milaanevaali saral rekha main hota he to use grah kii antaryuti tathaa jab antargrah tathaa prithvi ko milaanevaali saral rekha surya ke centre se hokar jaati he to use bahiryuti kehete hai
 When the line joining the Earth from the Earth goes through the Sun, it is called Samyuti and when the planet resides between the line joining the Earth and the Sun, it is called the separation of the planet
 grah kii ek sanyuti se duusari sanyuti tak ke samay ko sanyutikaal kehete hai bahirgrahon kaa yahi, prithvi ke saapeksh, raashichakr kii parikrama kaa kaal hota he
 Intragrahas often revolve around the zodiac during the Earth's orbit
 apni kakshaon main gati kii disha ek hi hone ke kaaran antargrah antaryuti ke asann tathaa bahirgrah viyuti ke asann kaal main prithvi ke saapeksh viruddh disha main chalate prathit hote hai
 For this reason, we see them going west in the zodiac
 yah grahon kii vakrgati he
 Shortly before the planets attain curvature, the motion relative to the Earth becomes constant
 isse grah sthir se prathit hote hai
 The curve of the planet at the time of inertia or vyutti is extremely high
 After some time it starts decreasing, then the planet starts moving at a steady speed
 antargrahon ke prakashit bhaag chandramaa kii tarah kam tathaa adhik prakashit hote rahete hai or ye kalaayen praapt karte hai
 Due to their very small sizes, their art is not visible without the instrument
 bahirgrahon kii kalaayen sadaa ardhadhik rahati he
 Just as planets orbit the Sun due to the gravity of the Sun, similarly Satellites revolve around the planets
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam se yah spasht he ki inaki dravyamatraayen apane grahon se kam hoti hai
 Earth's satellite is called Moon
 chandramaa kaa hamaare jivan se bahut sambandh he
 Lunar months are still practiced in many countries for religious acts
 chandramaa ko pracheen kaal main grah mana jaataa tha
 Apart from Earth, there are two satellites of Mars, 12 of Guru, 9 of Saturn, 5 of Varuni, and 2 of Varuna
 budh, shukr tathaa yama kaa koi bhi upgrah nahin he1 When the moon comes between the earth and the sun, the visible sun part of the earth is covered with it on the new moon day
 ise suryagrahan kehete hai
 Similarly, when the moon enters the shadow of the earth and becomes lightless on the full moon night, then it is eclipsed
 surya tathaa chandramaa ke grahan bahut prasiddh hai
 Eclipses of the Sun help a lot in studying the nature of the Sun's atmosphere and Kirit
 guru ke upgrahon ke grahanon ke adhyayan se sarvapratham prakaash ke veg ko gyaat kiya gaya
 The covering of the stars by the moon is called a constellation! bode ne grahon kii surya se dooriyaan jyotisheeya ikai main gyaat karne ke liye nimnlikhit niyam bataaya tha-- Du 0
4 + 0
3 ′ 2 n, where n = - ¥, 0,1,2,3,4, xxrep 8 
 This gives the distance of Mercury 0
4, the distance of Venus = 0
7, the distance of Earth - 1
0 and The distance to Mars gained 1
6
 yahan tak to praaia: thik he, kintu guru kii duuri is niyam se thik nahin baithti
 But if we imagine another planet in the middle, then the distances of the remaining planets fit with this rule
 isaliye jyotishiyon ne mangal tathaa guru kii kaksha ke bich anya grah kii khoj shuru kii
 This gave them many asteroids
 sarvapratham kshudragrah sito kaa avishkaar janvari, 1801 isvi main italy ke jyotishi piyaazi ne kiya tha
 In 1950, the number of asteroids reached 1,600
 anumaan he ki inaki sankhya 1,00,000 hogi
 These are celestial bodies made of very low-density matter, which when approaching the Sun, illuminate their tail-like part far away from the Sun in the opposite direction
 inke aakaar ko mukhyatya do bhaagon main baanta jaataa he
 The round densely illuminated part is called the head and the lighted part is called the tail
 sir main inkaa nabhik hota he
 They go in conic routes under the control of the Sun
 inamen kuch kii kakshaayen paravalayakaar tathaa atiparavalayakaar dikhalaai padati hai, jisase prathit hota he ki kadachit guru ne apane aakarshan ke kaaran inhen saura parivaar kaa sadsy bana liya
 Many comets rotate periodically in elliptical orbits
 inamen heli kaa dhoomaketu prasiddh he
 The Guru has a great influence on the speed of comets
 iske kaaran inaki kaksha badal jaati he
 In ancient times, the sight of comets was considered to be a sign of evil
 bahudhaa raatri ke samay kuch chamkile padaarth prithvi kii ore ativeg se aate dikhaai dete hai
 These are called star breaks or meteorites
 ulkaaye hamen tabhi dikhalaai detii hai jab ye ativeg se prithvi ke vayumandal main ghusati hai
 Their velocity ranges from 11 to 62 kilometers per second
 ye jab hamaare dharaatal se 100 tathaa 120 kilometre kii duuri ke bheetar hoti hai to hamen pratham baar dikhalaai padati hai or 50 yaa 60 kilometre kii duuri tak aane par adrishy ho jaati hai
 In fact, on entering the earth's dense atmosphere from extreme force, fire is produced in their material and they burn
 inaki dravyamatra atyalp hoti he
 Sometimes, when meteors fall on the earth, they make big pits
 yadi hamaara vayumandal hamaari raksha na kare, to ulkapaat se prithvi tathaa hamaari bahut haani ho 
 These are self-illuminated celestial bodies with hot gases, which associate their matter with personal gravity
 taron ke samooh ek vishesh akruti dhaaran kar lete hai, inhen taramandal kehete hai
 The constellations of the ecliptic are called zodiac signs, which are Aries, Taurus, Gemini etc
 12
 sarpdhar kaa kuch bhaag vrishchik tathaa dhanu raashiyon ke bich main he
 There are 21 constellations between the ecliptic and the celestial pole, and the 47 constellations between the remaining part of the serpent and the ecliptic and the south celestial pole
 antarrashtriya pranali main inke kuch naam greek puranakthaon par aadhaarit hai tathaa kuch ke naam arabi ke hai
 The Indian names of the constellations Ashwini, Bharani, Mrigashira etc
 are also associated with mythology
 raashiyon main taaren kii chamak ke kram ko bataane ke liye greek varnmaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The order of brightness of the constellations in which the number of stars exceeds the letters of the alphabet is also expressed by numerals
 prayek kantimaan apane agle kantimaan se 2
5 guna adhik chamkila hota he
 The lower the radius, the 2
5 the relative brightness of the stars will increase
 is prakaar 1 se 6 tak kantimaan ke taron kii chamak kaa anupaat 100 : 40 : 16 : 6
3 : 2

 The color of the stars gives knowledge of their temperature
 bina yantra ke dekhne se bhi rang kaa pataa chal jaataa he, kintu sookshm gyaan ke liye rangaprabhavi lep vaali photography kii platon, filmon tathaa varnakramdarshi photography kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The number of stars visible only by eye is about 6,500
 inamen lagbhag 20 taare 1 se 1
5 kantimaan ke lagbhag, 50 taare dwitiya, 150 taare tritiy, 500 taare chaturth, 1,500 taare pancham tathaa shesh taare chathe kantimaan ke hai
 Only the brightest stars cannot be seen with eyes, less than the sixth record
 200 inch vyas ke doordarshee kii sahaayta se 23wein kantimaan tak ke taare dekhe ja sakate hai
 So far, the number of stars in our galaxy seen by large telescopes is 1011
 taron kii gatiyon ko do bhaagon main baant dete hai
 One is that from which we move back and forth in the direction of our sight, and the other, from which the stars appear to be moving in some direction relative to the distant stars
 pratham ko trigyaveg tathaa dwitiya ko nijee gati kehete hai
 The gain of both the velocities is the actual velocity of the star
 trigyaveg ko varnakram kii laal rekhaon ke vichlan se dopalar ke niyam dwaara janaa jaataa he, tathaa nijee gati ko kuch varshon ke antaraal se liye gaye photographon dwaara
 The personal speed of the wires is very low

 Ebola virus is a virus
 ibola virus It has currently taken the form of a serious disease

 It is a very deadly disease
 isamen 90% rogiyon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 The disease was first identified in 1976 in a village near the Ebola River
 isi kaaran iskaa naam ibola pada
 Ebola is a disease that spreads through contact with a patient
 
marij ke paseene,marij ke khun yaa,shwaas se bachakar rahen

iske chapet main aakar typhoid,cholera,bukhaar,or mansapeshiyon main dard hota he

to avoid this, there is a way to keep yourself alert
 
ibola kaa naam kaagon kii ek sahaayak nadi ibola ke upar padaa he
 
and virus was first found in Africa
 
ibola ke marijon kii 50 se 80 fisadi maut record kii gai he
 The disease is spread by sweat and saliva
 sankramit khun or mel ke sidhe sampark main aane se bhi yah failata he
 In addition, sexual intercourse and Ebola-infected corpse may also cause disease
 yah sankramak rog he
 Symptoms are- vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headache, bleeding, red eyes and sore throat
 aksar iske lakshan prakat hone main teen saptaah tak kaa samay lag jaataa he
 In this disease, the skin of the patient starts to thaw
 yahan tak ki haath-pair se lekar puraa sharir gal jaataa he
 This disease can be avoided only by staying away from such a patient
 abhi is beemaari kaa koi ilaj nahin he
 No medicine could be made for this
 iskaa koi anti-virus bhi nahin he
 Efforts are on to develop vaccines for this; However, no such vaccine exists yet

 ye nimnlikhit hai- This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Swine influenza
 suar influenza, ek sankramak he jo "boar influenza virus" naam ke sookshm jeev kii aneko vishisht prakaar kii prajatiyon main se kisi ek prakaar ke dharak se hoti he
 In 2009, the media called it the swine fluka, a new strain of the a / H1N1 pandemic virus, similar to the 'bird flu' that had recently occurred in a virus known as the Asian-lineage HPAI H5N1
 In many countries, it is found in many species of local wild birds
 ek boar influenza virus jo saamanytah host virus he jo suaaron main paaya jaataa he
 As of 2009, the SIV distinction consists of influenza c virus and strains influenza a virus considered as H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, H2N3
 suar flu duniya bhar main suar aabaadi main aam he
 Swine influenza generally does not spread from pigs to humans and is often not the cause of human influenza, and often results in only antibodies in the blood
 pashu ke maance ko yadi acchhee tarah pakaaya gaya ho to usase sankraman kaa koi khatara nahin hota he
 If infection causes human influenza, it is called zoonotic swine flu
 jo log boar ke saath kaam karte hai or unke saath adhik rahete hai unako suvar flu hone kaa khatra zyada hota he
 In the mid-20th century, it was possible to identify influenza strains, which provide accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans
 tab se, pachaas sancharan kii pushti darj kii gai he
 Such a crop rarely penetrates from one person to another
 manushya main boar flu ke lakshan multah influenza ke lakshan hote hai yaa influenza jaise lakshan hote hai, jaise - jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar kaa aana, gale main karaash, mansapeshiyon main dard, gambhir sir dard, khaansee, kamajori or saamaanya asuvidha
 suar bhi maanav influenza se sankramit ho sakate hai or yah varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke dauraan prathit hua tha
 This 2009 swine flu in humans is caused by a new breed of influenza A, which is similar to the genes of swine influenza
 is nai nasl kaa mul agyaat he
 However, according to the report of the World Animal Health Organization, this type of flu is no different in pigs
 yah maanav se maanav ko sankramit ho saktaa hanore isamen influenza ke saamaanya lakshan dikhaai de sakate hai
 Of the three species of influenza virus that can cause human flu, two of them cause influenza in pigs, influenza virus a is common in these and influenza virus c is rare
 influenz virus b siiron main abhi suchit nahin kiya gaya he
 Influenza virus a and influenza virus c have distinct differences between humans and pigs
 vargeekaran ke kaaran genes, boar, bird or maanav prajati ke bich seemaa laangh kar jaati rahati hai
 Influenza c virus infects humans and pigs but does not infect birds
 purv main siiron or insaanon ke bich sankraman hota tha
 For example, influenza c was found among children in Japan and California
 Due to its limited carrier range and lack of genetic diversity in influenza C, this influenza does not appear as a pandemic in humans
 suar influenza, influenza a or upbhed H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, or H2N3 ke kaaran hota he
 In pigs, three influenza a viruses appear worldwide as strains
 varsh 1998 se pehle sanyukt rajya america main, H1N1 upbhed vishesh rup se siiron ke bich main prachlit tha or 1998 ke uttarardh main agast main yah H3N2 upbhed siiron main alag paaya gaya
 varsh 2004 ke anusaar, H3N2 virus america or turki main alag-alag dikhaai dete the jo teen tarah ke vargeekaran se hote the or maanav, boar or avian vanshavali main main paae jate the
 Although there is no system in the United States to determine which viruses are transmitted to pigs, there is informally a national control system, which is a part of the world control network
 pashu chikitsak, traisi mechnamra, ne chidyaghar main ek rashtriya rog niyantran pranali kii sthapana kii he kyonki ve chideaghar main rog kii sakriy niyantran rakhte hai or vahaan kai videshi jaanavar vyapak rup main rahete hai
 Many species fall below the radar of any federal agencies, although they may be important in early detection of the causes of human disease outbreaks
 suar influenza sabase pehle ek maanav sambandhit influenza kaha gaya tha jo varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke dauraan pataa chalaa jab manushya kii tarah boar bhi manushya kii tarah biimaar padane lage
 sabase pehle yah influenza virus suaron kii beemaari ke rup main varsh 1930 ke baad se dikhaai dene laga
 agle 60 varshon main boar influenza H1N1 hi maatr hote the
 Then, three different strains were found between the years 1997 and 2002 that emerged as influenza among pigs of North America in three new races and five different jeans
 In 1997–1998, the H3N2 species emerged
 These genes, which were caused by the classification of humans, pigs and avian viruses, and pigs have become a major cause of influenza in North America
 H1N1 or H3N2 ke vargeekaran se H1N2 utpann hua
 In the year 1999, the H4N6 species in Canada crossed over the range of birds to the extent of pigs which were contained in the same type
 boar kaa H1N1 prakaar kaa flu varsh 1918 ke flu mahamari ke vansh kram kaa hi he
 This virus, also seen in pigs, started appearing in the year 1918 through 20th century humans, which is visible in normal seasonal influenza
 haalaanki siiron se manushyon main iskaa sidhaa prasaaran nahin hota par varsh 2005 ke baad se america main keval 12 maamle dikhaai die
 baharhaal, siiron main dikhaai dene vaala is influenza ke upbhed baad main maanav aabaadi se gaayab ho gaye jahaan ye influenza virus ho sakate the, baad main jab maanav kii rog kshamta kam ho gayi to ye phir unhen sankramit karne aa gaye
 Swine flu, a widespread distribution as well as limited distribution, has been reported several times as junosis in humans
 boar main yah prakope aam he or udyog main yah mahatvapurn aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran hota he jo mukhya rup se ek kartab or bazaar ke vistaar ke rup main mana jaataa he
 For example, the disease costs 650 million pounds annually for the British meat industry
 varsh 1918 kii flu mahamari H1N1 or boar influenza ke rup main dikhaai di thi
 This junosis appears to occur from pigs to humans or from humans to pigs
 haalanki is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin tha ki yah virus kis disha main sthantarit hota he par praapt pramaanon ke anusaar yah rog manushya se siiron main aayaa he
 For example, swine influenza became known as a new disease in the year 1918 when influenza was detected in humans
 However, inheritance suggests that recent influenza species have been observed in humans, birds, and pigs, which in the year 1918 were found to be classified by a mammal
 It was not revealed until 1918
 farvari 5, 1976 main america kii sena main bhartee ek vyakti fort dix ne kaha ki vah thakaa hua or kamjor mahasoos kar rahaa he
 He later died and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized
 Two weeks after her death, health officials reported that the cause of her death was a new breed of swine flu
 is jati ko H1N1 kaa ek prakaar mana gaya jo a / new jersey / 1976 kaha gaya
 yah 19 janvari or farvari 9 tak pataa chalaa or phir fort dix ke baad failaa nahin
 This new race looks like a caste related to the 1918 flu pandemic
 iske alaava, is nigaraanee ne america main ek or jati vishesh kaa pataa lagaaya
 a / victoria / 75 fail gayi or beemaari kaa kaaran bani or march tak barkaraar rahi
 saarvajanik swasthya adhikariyon ko sachet kiya or tab unhone yah nishchay kiya ki ek or pramukh mahamari ko aane se bachaaya jaae or iske liye raashtrapati jerald ford se aagrah kiya ki sanyukt raashtra main sabhi logon ko tikaa diya jaae
 This vaccination program could not be done on time due to public relations problems and delays
 On 1 October 1976, the vaccination program began and by 11 October, approximately 400 million people, or about 24% of the population, received swine flu protection
 usee din, teen varisht naagarik boar flu kaa tikaa praapt karne ke baad mar gayi or vahaan sanchaar madhyam ne un mauton ko tikaakaran se jodne kaa prayaas kiya, yadhyapi unako iske liye koi sakaaratmak saboot nahin mili
 vigyaan lekhak patric di jasto ke anusaar, jab tak is sach kaa pataa chalata ki mauton ke tike se koi sambandh nahin he - bahut der ho chuki thi
 "the government had long feared about the swine flu - so now they began to fear about swine flu vaccination
" This was a major setback for the event
 reporton ke anusaar jin logon ne boar flu ke tike praapt kiye unamem guillein-barre syndrome paaya gaya jo ek prakaar kaa nauromuscular se sambandhit vikaar tha
 This syndrome was a rare negative effect of modern influenza vaccines, occurring in one case per one million people
 iske parinamswaroop, di jasto ne likhaa ki "janata ne sarkaar dwaara sanchalit swasthy kaaryakramon par vishwaas karnaa chhod diya jisane boode logon ko maar daalaa or yuva logon ko aapng kar diya
 " varsh 1976 ke ant tak jansankhya kaa kam se kam 33% tike praapt kar chukaa tha
 The National Influenza Vaccination Program was terminated by 16 December
 kul milakar, vahaan guillein-barre syndrome ke 500 cese darj hue jisame se 25 log fefde sambandhi jatilta se mar gaye
 According to Dr
 P
 Haber, this vaccine of 1976 arose due to a kind of clinical vaccination
 anya influenza tikon kaa sambandh jibies se nahin joda gaya
 jin logon main jibies kaa itihaas tha unako pehle hi satark kar diya gaya tha
 It was believed by a participant in the immunization program that this vaccine killed more Americans than the disease
 sitambar 1988 main, boar flu vishaanu ne ek aurat ko maar daalaa or dusron ko sankramit kar diya
 32 varshiya barbara en vienners aath maheene ke garbh se thi jab vah or uske pati, aid, visconsin naam ke ek county meley main valvorth county main gaye or biimaar pad gaye
 Barbara was killed eight days later by pneumonia
 uske andar ekmaatr rogazanq pahchaan boar kaa H1N1 jati kaa influenza virus tha
 She was motivated by the diligence of doctors and gave birth to a healthy daughter before she died
 Her husband later recovered
 boar meley main jitne bhi boar pradarshit the unamem ILI vyapak rup se paaya gaya
 25 boar pradarshkon main se 76% boar pradarshak jo 9 se 19 aayu varg ke the unamem SIV pratipind sakaaratmak rup main paaya gaya
 par is samooh main se kisi ko bhi koi gambhir beemaari nahin pai gayi
 Additional studies showed that patients who were in contact with health workers developed mild influenza, similar to the infection of pigs with diseases of the swine
 haalanki, isamen koi samudaay prakope nahin hua
 In 1998, swine flu was found in four US states
 ek varsh ke bheetar-bheetar yah sanyukt rajya bhar main suar aabaadiyon ke bich fail gaya
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki yah virus siiron se utpann hua he jo pakshiyon or manushyon se flu upabhedon ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 This showed that pigs emerge as a crucible where new influenza viruses appear in different species as a result of the classification of genes from different strains
 20 agast 2007 krishi vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne is prakope kii jaanch philipppin ke nueva asija or central lujon, main kii
 swine flu ke kaaran hui mratyu dar 10% se bhi kam he, jab tak ki vahaan hogg haija jaisi jatilta nahin hai
 On July 27, 2007, the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service announced a "red alert" towards pig cholera, where the disease spread to five provinces of Luzon from the backward pig farms of Metro Manila as well as Bulacan and Pampanga
 Swine was proven negative for the flu
 yah 2009 flu ke failane kaa kaaran upbhed H1N1 kii ek nai nasl maani gayi jo pehle siiron main report nahin hui thi
 In late April, Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, announced "a public health emergency of international concern", according to who's new international health regulations when information to the United States about the first case of the H1N1 virus Under this, on 2 May 2009, when it was reported to spread in Mexico, it was found that its link Alber Received, appeared at a farm in Canada
 These pigs, seem to have obtained this new breed from a laborer who had recently returned from Mexico and had signs of influenza
 ye sambhavit maamle hai, jinaki pushti prayogshaala main lambit he
 It is characterized by a new virus influenza a type of virus classification consisting of strains of H1N1 from four species, one from humans, one from birds and two from pigs
 }aagaamee vishleshan se yah pataa chalaa ki yah do prakaar kii jatiyon se yukt he jo siiron main pai jaati he
 Although early reports called the new species a swine influenza, its origin is still unknown
 kai deshon main is beemaari ko ek vaishvik mahamari kii sambhaavna maan kar is ke liye kai ehtiyaati upaay liye hai
 Swine flu has been compared to many other swine flu influenza viruses, keeping mortality in mind
 "america main aise lagata he ki har 1000 logon main se jo sankramit hote he unamem se 40 logon ko aspataal main pravesh lenaa padataa he or ek vyakti kii maut ho jaati he
 There is also a fear that swine flu will become a major global epidemic in the winter months and hence many countries are planning vaccination campaigns
 influenzan siiron main aam he kyonki sanyukt raashtra main boar paalan ke aadhe se bhi zyada prajnansheel siiron kaa sampark virus se ho chukaa he
 Antibodies to this virus are also common in other countries
 sancharan kaa mukhya kaaran sankramit or asankramit jaanwaron ke bich sidhe sampark ke madhyam se hota he
 These contacts are common, especially during animal transport
 gahan kheti bhi sancharan ke khatre ko badha saktaa he kyonki yahan boar ek duusare ke bahut kareeb hote hai
 Direct transfer of the virus is probably either from the pigs' nostrils or via dried mucus
 hawa dwaara sankraman bhi tab hota he jab ye boar yaa to khansate he yaa cheenkte hai
 The virus usually spreads very quickly in a few days through a swarm
 sankraman duusare junglee jaanwaron se bhi ho saktaa he
 Infection spreads from all pigs within a few days
 yah sankraman junglee boar, yaa junglee jaanwaron se bhi ho sakate hai jo is rog ko farm se failaate hai
 Those who work with poultry and pigs are at greater risk of these
 aise logon ko junotic sankraman kaa khatra rahata hai jo virus pashuon main paaya jaataa he
 Due to this a population can be formed in which humans can be its carriers and in them junosis and classification may be possible
 in karmchaariyon ko influenza ke prati tikaakaran or nae influenza jati ke khilaaf nigaraanee saarvajanik swasthya ke prati ek acha upaay ho saktaa he
 At the University of Iowa in 2004, people who work with swine documented a small surveillance study on the transfer of influenza from swine to humans
 yah adhyayan anya logon ke bich aadhaar bana he ki jinaki naukariyaan boar par aadhaarit hai, unke liye swine ek saarvajanik swasthya nigaraanee kaa centre he
 Other occupations in which the infection is more common are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for these two groups is lower than farm workers
 boar asaamaanya hote hai kyonki ve influenza upabhedon ke teen alag-alag prajatiyon se sankramit ho sakate hai : siiron, pakshiyon or manushyon
isse boar influenza virus ke vaahak ban jate hai jahaan jin vinimay ke saath-saath nae or khatarnaak jatiyon kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has also been identified in pigs in Vietnam, leading to the emergence of new strains
 H3N2 H2N2 se pratijnike dwaara viksit hue he
 In August 2004, researchers found H5N1 in pigs in China
 ye H5N1 sankraman kaaphi aam ho saktaa he: pashchim java ke paultry farm main jab bird flu chal pada to 10 swasth siiron ke surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki paanch suaron ke namoonay main H5N1 virus nihit he
 The Indonesian government received similar results in this area
 Additional tests conducted on 150 pigs outside this area were negative
 siiron main influenza sankraman se, bukhaar aata he, susti hoti he, chhinke aati hai, khaansi hoti he, shwaas lene main kathinaayee or bhukh kii kami mahasoos hoti he
 In some cases, infection also leads to miscarriage
 haalanki mrityu dar aam taur par kam he, virus vajan ghataane ke saath-saath or vikaas ko bhi kam karte hai jisase kisaanon ko aarthik nuksaan pahunchataa hai
 The body weight of infected pigs decreases by more than 12 pounds over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 siiron se manushya main boar flu virus kaa sidhaa sankraman kabhi-kabhi hi sambhav ho saktaa he 
 chikitsa sahitya ke report anusaar varsh 1958 main darj pehle cese se aaj tak 50 cese praapt ho chuke hai jin main se chah maut ho gayi hai
 One in six people was pregnant, one had blood cancer, one was a Hodgkin patient and two are said to be healthy
 yadhyapi ye sankraman kii kam sankhya he, sankraman ke sahi dar kaa pataa nahin he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main keval bahut hi halkaa rog ho saktaa he, jo na to report kiye jaayegein yaa inkaa kabhi nidaan hi ho paayegaa
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, swine flu in humans sounds similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus influenza and influenza-like illness
 in lakshanon main bukhaar, khaansi, gale main dard, sharir main dard, sirdard, thand or thakaan shaamil hai
 In the 2009 outbreak, most patients have seen diarrhea and vomiting
 varsh 2009 kaa H1N1 virus junotic boar flu nahin he, kyonki yah boar se manushya main preshit nahin hota he, vyakti se vyakti ko hota he
 Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu
 sambhavit boar flu kaa ek vibhedak nidaan hai ki boar flu main vyakti main ve lakshan dikhne chahie jo us vyakti ke haal ke itihaas kii vajah se he
 For example, during the swine flu outbreak in the United States in 2009, the CDC told physicians that "people with swine flu who have confirmed fever as well as severe respiratory disease are those who have swine flu
" Have received contacts, which were in the five states of the United Nations where people have suffered from swine flu, who lived in Mexico 7 days before becoming ill
 Asked were, to consider "
 Laboratory tests required to confirm swine flu boar influenza ke nivaaran ke teen ghatak hai : boar main rokthaam, manushya main sancharan kaa rokthaam or manushyon ke bich iske failane se rokna
 There are ways to prevent the spread of influenza among pigs - facility management, herd management and vaccination
 Because most disease and death is caused by other pathogens associated with swine flu, vaccine-dependent controls may be inadequate
 haal ke dashak main tikaakaran dwaara boar influenza par niyantran karnaa mushkil ho gaya he, virus ke udbhav se paramparaagat tikaakaran asangat ho gaya he
 Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling infections when virus strains are sufficient for significant protection and drugs made by specific viruses are used in complex cases
 SIV niyantran or rokthaam ke liye banaaye gaye tike swine fermon main SIV tikaakaran ke liye prayog kiye jate he jo vanijyik rup main sanyukt rajya america main uplabdh hai
 In a recent investigation of 97 H3N2 isolates, it was found that 41 of them are virus-resistant and have three antagonistic reactions
 influenza tikon kii rakshaatmak kshamta mukhyatah tike ke virus or mahamari virus ke bich nikat sambandh par nirbhar karata he, SIV main sthit apribhavi H3N2 prakaar yah bataate hai ki vartmaan vyavsaayik tike prabhavit rup se H3N2 sankraman virus se siiron kii raksha nahin kar sakate he
 Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture say that the infection does not stop as long as pigs are sick with pig vaccinations
 suvidha prabandhan main vyapak vaataavaran ke saath-saath vaataavaran main vidyaman virus ko niyantrit karnaa or keitanurahit vaataavaran bananaa bhi shaamil he
 The virus cannot live outside of living cells for more than two weeks, but in the cold, sterile environment it becomes lethargic
 jhund prabandh kaa matlab influenza ko lekar chalane vaale siiron ko jhund main shaamil karnaa nahin hai jo is virus ke sampark main aa chuke hai
 The virus lives in healthy pigs for up to 3 months and can be recovered at the time of outbreak
 vaahak boar aamtaur par SIV ko asankramit jhund main yaa desh main shuru karne ke liye jimmedaar hote hai taaki nae pashu unase alag rakhen jaaen
 iske failane ke baad, sankramit siiron main rog nirmulan shakti kam ho jaati he, to iskaa prakope bad jaataa he
 Pig influenza can occur from both strains of human influenza and avian influenza, becoming carriers of these antigens that can breed a new influenza species
 boar se maanav main sthaanantaran mukhyatah formon main hota he jahaan kisaan siiron ke saath nikat sampark main rahete hai
 Although swine influenza species are generally not capable of infecting humans, this is sometimes possible, so farmers and veterinarians must deal with infected animals by putting a mask on their faces
 Use of vaccines on pigs, to prevent infection, is a major method of preventing transmission in humans
 jokhim kaarak jo boar se manushya main rog ko sankraman karne main yogadan dete hai ve hai dhumrapaan or pashuon ke saath kaam karte samay dastaanon kaa na pahananaa he
 Infection is spread among humans by coughing or sneezing and by people touching objects containing the virus and then touching their nose or mouth
 suar flu pork utpaadon se nahin fail saktaa he, kyonki vishaanu bhojan ke madhyam se preshit nahin hote hai
 In humans, swine flu is more infected during the first five days, although some people, most children, can live for ten days
 nidaan ke liye, namoonay ko vishleshan ke liye pehle paanch dinon main ekatra kar bhej sakate hai
 One can also use standard infection control against influenza to prevent the spread of this virus among humans
 saarvajanik sthanon main jane par sabun or pani, haath dhone ke liye madh mishrit dawa kaa prayog karnaa chahie
sancharan ko rokane ke liye ghar main sabhi vastuon ko keitanurahit karnaa hoga, jo ek patale chlorine bleech ke dwaara sambhav ho saktaa he
 However, this trivalent influenza vaccine is not able to provide protection against the new 2009 H1N1 species

 Experts are of the opinion that hand washing prevents viral infections, including simple influenza and swine flu virus
 influenza khansane yaa chhikane se failati he, lekin praapt sakshya ke anusaar choti buundon ke rup main wires mej par, telephone or anya satahon par rahete hai or ungliyon ke madhyam se munh, naak yaa aankhon main sthantarit ho jate hai
 Viruses and bacteria are destroyed by scrubbing with foam or gel containing alcohol
 kisi bhi vyakti main yadi flu ke jaise koi lakshan hai jaise - achaanak bukhaar, khaansi yaa mansapeshiyon kaa dard, to unhen kaam se dur rahanaa chahie yaa saarvajanik parivahan se dur rahanaa chahie or doctor se sampark karnaa chahie
 Avoiding socially is also another way
 iskaa matlab he ki un logon se dur rahanaa jo sankramit ho sakate hai, bade sammelnon main jane se parhez karnaa, thoda kaam karnaa, ghar par rahakar bistar par pade rahanaa yadi sankraman kisi samudaay main fail rahaa he
 Public health and other responsible officials may request them to stay away or even ask them to stay away from society if the spread of the disease is seen to be serious
 jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he boar influenza siiron ke liye ghaatak nahin he, iske liye thode se upachaar or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he
 Instead, veterinary efforts focus on farms and other farms
 tikaakaran or pashu prabandhan takanic in prayaason ke liye sabase zyada mahatvapurn hai
 Antibiotics are also used for its treatment, which do not affect the influenza virus, helping to prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections on influenza-weaned herds
 yadi koi vyakti boar flu se biimaar ho jaataa he, to virus virdohi dawaaon se beemaari kam ho jaati he or marij teji se behatar mahasoos karata he
 They can also prevent serious flu complications
 ilaaj ke liye, virus virdohi dawaaen behtareen kaam karti hai yadi rog shuru hone ke tunrat shuru kar diya jaae 
 ghar yaa aspataal main virus virdohi dawaaon ke alaava, prashamak dekhbhaal, fever ko niyantrit karte hue or taral padaarthon kaa santulan karte hue upachaar kar sakate hai
 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of Tamiflu or Ralenza, which proves useful for infection or prevention of swine flu virus
 lekin zyaadaatar log jo is vishaanu se sankramit hai bina chikitsa yaa virus virdohi dawaaon ke prayog ke thik ho jate hai
 The virus that spread in 2009 is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine
 america main, 27 april 2009 ko khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ne apatkaaleen istemaal ke liye praadhikaran jari kiya ki railenza or tamiflu virus virdohi dawa uplabdh karwaae jo swine flu ke upachaar ke liye jaruri he or jo abhi ananumodith nahin hai

 Timur Lung was a ruler of the fourteenth century who founded the great Timuri dynasty
 uskaa rajya pashchim asia se lekar madhya asia hote hue bharat tak failaa tha
 It is counted among the great and inexorable conquerors of the world
 vah baralas turk khandaan main paidaa hua tha
 His father Turgai Barlas was the leader of the Turks
 bharat ke mogul samrajya kaa sansthaapak babar timur kaa hi vanshaj tha
 Taimur was born in 1336 in Mavraunnahar, a region between the rivers trans-oxiana, Trans Amu and Sir, in a place called Kesh or shahar-e-sabz
 uske pita ne islam kabool kar liya tha
 Hence, Timur was also a staunch follower of Islam
 vah bahut hi pratibhavan or mahatvakankshi vyakti tha
 Like the great Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, he also wanted to trample the whole world with his power and, like Alexander, wished for Vishwavijaya
 san 1369 main samarkand ke mongol shaasha ke mar jane par usne samarkand kii gaddi par kabja kar liya or iske baad usne puri shakti ke saath digvijay kaa kaary prarambh kar diya
 He established his military system only on Genghis Khan's method and, like Genghis, he invaded far-off countries with cruelty and ruthlessness and destroyed them
 1380 or 1387 ke bich usne khurasaan, sistan, afghanistan, faras, ajarbaijan or kurdistan aadi par akraman kar unhen adheen kiya
 In 1393 he established suzerainty over Mesopotamia over Baghdad
 in vijayon se utsahit hokar ab usne bharat par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 His nobles and chieftains were not initially ready to attack a remote country like India, but when he declared his pious mission to destroy the idolatry prevalent in India for the propagation of Islam, his nobles and chieftains attacked India
 Agreed
 murtipuja kaa vidhwans to akraman kaa bahaanaa maatr tha
 In fact, he was attracted by India's gold
 bharat kii mahan samruddhi or vaibhav ke bare main usne bahut kuch baaten sun rakhi thim
 Therefore, to plunder India's wealth, he had planned an attack
 use akraman kaa bahaanaa foundne kii avashyaktaa bhi nahin mahasoos hui
 At that time the Tughluq Sultanate of Delhi was in a miserable state due to the weak successors of Ferozeshah
 bharat kii is raajnneetik durbalata ne taimur ko bharat par akraman karne kaa swayan suavasar pradaan diya
 In early 1398, Timur first sent one of his grandchildren, Pir Mohammed, to attack India
 usne multan par gheraa daalaa or chha: maheene baad usapar adhikaar kar liya
 In April 1398, Timur himself left for India from Samarkand with a heavy army and in September he crossed the Indus, Jhelum and Ravi
 13 oktober ko vah multan se 70 mile uttar-purab main sthit tulumba nagar pahunchaa
 He looted this city and killed many of its inhabitants and enslaved many
 phir multan or bhatner par kabja kiya
 There many temples of Hindus were destroyed
 bhatner se vah aage badha or maarg ke anek sthanon ko luutata-khasotata or nivaasiyon ko katl tathaa kaid karata hua disambar ke pratham saptaah ke ant main dilli ke nikat pahunch gaya
 Here he killed one lakh Hindu prisoners
 panipat ke paas nirbal tughlaq sultan mahmud ne 17 disambar ko 40,000 paidal 10,000 ashwarohi or 120 haathiyon kii ek vishaal sena lekar taimur kaa mukaabila kiya lekin buree tarah parajeet hua
 Frightened, Tughlaq Sultan Mahmud went towards Gujarat and his wazir Mallu Iqbal escaped and hid in Baran
 duusare din taimur ne dilli nagar main pravesh kiya
 For five days, the whole city was badly looted and its unfortunate inhabitants were slaughtered or imprisoned
 pidiyon se sanchit dilli kii daulat taimur lootakar samarkand le gaya
 Taimur also took many captive women and craftsmen with him
 bharat se jo karigar vah apane saath le gaya unase usne samarkand main anek imaaraten banavaain, jinamein sabase prasiddh uski swaniyojit jama masjid he
 Timur came to India only for plunder
 uski ichha bharat main rahakar rajya karne kii nahin thi
 So, after staying in Delhi for 15 days, he left for home
 9 janvari 1399 ko usne meerut par chadhaai kii or nagar ko lutaa tathaa nivaasiyon ko katl kiya
 He then reached Haridwar where he defeated two armies of the nearby Hindus
 shivalik pahadiyon se hokar vah 16 janvari ko kangra pahunchaa or usapar kabja kiya
 After this he marched on Jammu
 in sthanon ko bhi lutaa khasota gaya or vahaan ke asankhya nivaasiyon ko katl kiya gaya
 Thus, on 19 March 1399, after extensive damage to India's life, wealth and property, he again crossed the Indus River and returned to his country from Bharatbhoomi
 bharat se lautne ke baad taimur se san 1400 main anatolia par akraman kiya or 1402 main angora ke yuddh main automan turkon ko buree tarah se parajeet kiya
 He died in 1405 when he was planning to conquer China
 taimur langs doosraa changez khaan bananaa chahta tha
 He claimed to be a descendant of Genghis, but was in fact Turk
 vah langadaa tha, isliye 'taimur langs' kehalaata tha
 He became the ruler of Samarkand after his father in 1369 AD
 iske baad hi usne apni vijay or krurta kii yatra shuru kii
 He was a great soldier, but also a complete goth
 madhya asia ke mongol log is bich main musalmaan ho chuke the or taimur khud bhi musalmaan tha
 But when he was brought up by Muslims, he would not take softly with them
 jahaan-jahaan vah pahunchaa, usne tabaahi or bhalaa or puri musiibat failaa di
 He had great pleasure in getting huge piles of male and cisterns
 purv main dilli se lagaakar pashchim main asia-kochak tak usne lakhon aadmi qatl kar daale or unke kate siron ko stupon kii shakl main jamavaya
 In 1399, Taimur had a terrible attack on India
 apni jeevani 'tujuke taimuri' main vah quran kii is aayat se hi prarambh karata he 'i paigambar kafiron or vishwaas na laane waalon se yuddh karo or un par sakhti barto
 He further writes giving the reason for his invasion of India- kashmir kii seemaa par kator nami durg par akraman hua
 He ordered all men to be murdered and women and children imprisoned
 phir un hathi kafiron ke siron ke minar khadey karne ke aadesh diye
 Then the fort of Bhatner was surrounded
 vahaan ke rajputon ne kuch yuddh ke baad haar maan lee or unhen kshamaadaan de diya gaya
 But he was attacked as soon as he was indiscriminate
 taimur apni jeevani main likhata he ki 'thode hi samay main durg ke tamaam log talwaar ke ghat utaar diye gayi
 10,000 people were beheaded in an hour
 islam kii talwaar ne kafiron ke rakt main snaan kiya
 My soldiers, treasures and grain, which had been collected in the fort for years, were looted by my soldiers
 makaanon main aag laga kar raakh kar diya
 Buildings and fortifications were demolished
 doosraa nagar sarasuti tha jis par akraman hua
 'all Kafirs were Hindu slaughtered
 unke stri or bachche or sampatti hamaari ho gai
 When Timur entered the Jat region
 usne apni sena ko aadesh diya ki 'jo bhi mil jaye, katl kar diya jaye
 'and then whatever village or town came before the army, it was looted
 purushon ko katl kar diya gaya or kuch logon, striyon or bacchon ko bandi bana liya gaya
 ' dilli ke paas loni hindu nagar tha
 But some Muslims were also prisoners
 taimur ne aadesh diya ki musalamaanon ko chhodkar shesh sabhi hindu bandi islam kii talwaar ke ghat utaar diye jaayen
 By this time, the number of Hindu inmates had reached one lakh
 jab yamuna paar kar dilli par akraman kii taiyaari ho rahi thi uske saath ke amiron ne usase kaha ki in bandiyon ko camp main nahin choda ja saktaa or in islam ke shatruon ko swatantra kar dena bhi yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hoga
 Timur writes tughlaq badshaah ko haraakar taimur ne dilli main pravesh kiya
 He came to know that the Hindus have taken refuge in Delhi with their large number of women and children and valuable things while fleeing from the surrounding countryside
 usne apane sipaahiyon ko in hinduon ko unki sampatti samet pakad lene ke aadesh diye
 Sarabjit is a biographical film based on an Indian Hindi true story of 2016 directed by Omung Kumar

 film kii shuruyaat san 1993 main hoti he jab sarbajit singh ek garib kisaan he jinhone metric tak kii padhai kii he
 After this, he takes up the business of farming by becoming a farmer to support his family
 sarbajit singh rojaanaa apni bahin dalbir cor ko karyaalay chhodane jaataa he
 Sarabjit's wife takes care of the housework and her father Sulakshan Singh takes care of Sarabjit's two daughters
 ek din sarbajit singh or ek dost zyada sharaab pi lete he is kaaran apana aapa kho dete he or sarbajit nashe main hi apane ghar kii taraf nikal jaataa he lekin wo nashe main pakistan kii seemaa paar chalaa jaataa he kyonki us vaqt border par baadaa arthath tarbandi nahin hoti thi
 Late in the night, Pakistani soldiers see them and take them to Lahore, Pakistan, where they are kept in a small cell and they want to throw them to Manjit Singh, because Manjit Singh was the one who made Karachi in 1993 and Many more places and terrorist attacks were carried out
 vahiin ghar vaale bahin dalbir cor unke unke pati tathaa sarbajit kii patni unke khojate he lekin unka koi ata-pataa nahin miltaa he is kaaran gumshudagi kii report kii likhavate he lekin is or police bhi zyada dhyaan nahin detii he
 After some time a letter arrives from Pakistan by Sarabjit, which is sent by Sarabjit by himself, and then the people know that Sarabjit is not in India but in Pakistan's Kot Lakhpat Jail
 isi prakaar sarbajit kii khabaren tivi or samachar patron main bhi aane lagati he
 Once in an Urdu newspaper it would appear that Sarabjit was punished - a - death
 iske baad sarbajit singh kii bahin dalbir cor apane bhai ko pakistan se waapas laane kii bharsak prayaas karne lagati he isamen wo sarkaar kii khub madad maangati he lekin sarkaar bhi is or zyada dhyaan nahin detii he
 Dalbir tells the government and news journalists that Sarabjit is innocent, you help me but no one pays attention to this phir aage dalbir pradhanmantri se milanaa chaahati he or unhen milane main 8 maheenon lag jate he lekin milakar bhi zyada kuch nahin karte hai
 Here in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat Jail, Sarabjit Singh waits that someone will come
 kaaphi samay guzarane ke baad aakhir dalbir cor ko pakistan jane kaa mauka mil jaataa he or wo sarbajit kii patni or unki betiyon ko lekar unase milane jaati he or unhen chhodane ko kahati he, lekin pakistan kii najaron main sarbajit ek aatanki hota he is kaaran chhodane kii baat tak nahin karata he
 Time passes and the date is finally set for Sarabjit to be hanged but sister Dalbir does not give up and takes a different Pakistan lawyer
 pakistani vakil sarbajit se miltaa he or asli aatanki manajit ke khilaaf saboot ikattha karata he
 Then Manjeet Singh is arrested in India but he is released after a few days
 bich - bich main dalbir tathaa saathi log anshan karte he taaki sarkaar kii aankhe khule
 The dates of hanging Sarabjit come to a close and the Pakistani lawyers of Dalbir Kaur and Sarabjit try to bring them back to India

 Due to this Sarabjit's family goes home disappointed and then Dalbir Kaur tries to kill himself but the family saves him

 The householder talks about bringing Sarabjit to India, but then Sarabjit's dead body comes to India and wants to mourn all over India
 senthrai subarishan Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin is an Indian politician and former actor better known as MK Stalin
 ve tamilnadu ke mashhoor rajaneta karunanidhi ke tisare bete or unki duusari patni shrimati dayaalu ammal kii santan hai
 He was named after Joseph Stalin, who died in the year of his birth
 stallin ne chennai main madras vishvavidhyalay ke nandanam arts college se itihaas main apni snaatak str kii padhai puri kii he
 Stalin became the Minister of Rural Development and Local Administration in the Tamil Nadu government after the 2006 assembly elections
 29 may 2009 ko stallin ko rajyapal surajeet singh barnaala dwaara tamilnadu ke up-mukhyamantri ke rup main namit kiya gaya tha
 His elder brother MK Azhagiri is the Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers
 uski sauteli bahan kanimojhi ek rajya sabha sadsy hai
 Stalin also serves as the treasurer of the DMK and the chairman of the Yuva Morcha
 stallin kaa janm madras main hua tha, jise ab chennai ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 His political career began at the age of 14 with campaigning in the 1967 elections
 1973 main stallin ko dravid munetra kajhagam kii aam samiti main nirvaachit kiya gaya tha
 He made headlines when he was jailed under the Internal Security Maintenance Act for opposing the Emergency
 stallin 1989 ke baad se tamilnadu vidhansabha ke liye chennai ke thaugend lits nirvachan kshetra se chaar baar chune gaye hai
 Stalin became the first directly elected mayor of the city in 1996
 2001 main stallin ek baar phir se meyar chune gaye, haalaanki uske baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri je jayalalita ne tamilnadu nagar kanoon adhinium, 2002 ko adhiniyamit kiya tha
 It is a law that prevents a person from holding two elected positions in government
 is kaanoon ko purvyaapee rup se stallin ke maamle par lagu kiya gaya tha jise vyapak rup se unhen chennai ke meyar pad se hataane ke uddeshy se uthaaye gaye kadam ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 The Madras High Court, however, called the statute ineffective, stating that statutory bodies were not retroactively "prevented" from enacting laws affecting the "fundamental rights" of the people
 haalaanki adaalat ne yah mana ki madras city nagar nigam adhinium, 1919 ke tahat ek vyakti lagaataar do kaarykalon ke liye meyar nahin ban saktaa he yadhyapi stallin ke vipareet pehle ke meyar sidhe taur par nirvaachit nahin hue the
 Stalin did not appeal to the Supreme Court
 misa jo aatankwaad or gunda adhinium ke kaaphi kareeb he, iske tahat 1975 main pehali baar giraftaar kiye jane ke baad se stallin ko vibhinn saarvajanik muddon par kai baar giraftaar kiya gaya he or unhen purv main gambhir shaareerik dand bhi diya ja chukaa he
 Karunanidhi to be arrested in the midnight in which Karunanidhi, Stalin, Maran and others were arrested and charged with flyover scam
 ise vyapak rup se raajnneetik pratishodh kaa kadam samajha gaya tha kyonki exiaar yaa police main shikaayat shuukravaar raat ko darj karai gayi thi or giraftaaryaan iske kuch hi ghanton ke baad shanivaar subah ko kii gayi thim
 Although the arrest took place in 2001, the charge sheet was filed in the court in 2005 after four years
 tamilnadu main stallin ne 2009 ke aam chunaav main chunaav prachaar or antat diemke-gathbandhan-sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii jeet main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Opponents of the DMK, some political observers and the senior-most members of the DMK party criticize that Karunanidhi is trying to promote Stalin in an attempt to launch a political dynasty on the lines of the nehru-gandhi family
 diemke kaa saath chhod dene vaale vico sabase adhik mukhar rahe hai or kuch raajnneetik prekshak ise vico ko kinare karne ke ek kadam ke rup main dekhte hai kyonki unhen stallin ke liye ek khatre ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 However, DMK sources and those who have witnessed the political turmoil of the 70s and 80s deny this and say that Stalin has come forward on his own merit
 unka kahana he ki stallin apane kadamon ke boote aage bade hai, 1975 se hi unhen bahut kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he jab unhen misa ke tahat jail main band kiya gaya tha or apatkaal ke dauraan jail ke andar itani krurta se unki pitayee kii gayi thi ki unhen bachaane kii koshish main diemke party ke unke saathi kaidi kii maut ho gayi thi
 Stalin was an MLA in 1989 and 1996 when his father Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, but he was not included in the cabinet
 unhone apni ladaai khud ladi or 1996 main chennai ke 44wein meyar bane jisamen unhen pehle sidhe taur par nirvaachit meyar ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 This was his fourth term as MLA when he was made a minister in the Karunanidhi cabinet, thus his progress is slow and steady
