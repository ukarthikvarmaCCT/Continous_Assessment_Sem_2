 edward culen edward anthony masen) 3}steffeni meyar kii "tvilit shrinkhalaa" se ek kaalpanik paatr he
 In the 2008 Twilight film, Edward is played by actor Robert Pattinson
 charitra kaa vikaas gilbert blith, fitzwilliam darsi or vishesh rup se edward rochester ke dwaara prabhavit hua he- edward rochester edward culen ko pasand karte hai or apane aap ko ek "rakshas" ke rup main dekhte hai
 In Twilight, Edward meets Bella Swan, a human girl whose thoughts he cannot know and whose blood he finds very sweet
 vah uske prati badhate hue aakarshan ko rokane kii koshish karata he, lekin kai maukon par uski jaan bachaane ke baad, vah antat usase pyaar karne lagata he
 Edward tells Bella that he is a vampire and that although his body is a 17 year old, he was actually born on 20 June 1901
 apane dattak pita, carlisle culen ne use 1918 main ek pishaach main badal diya, taaki ve use chicago, ilinios main faili spanish influenza se marane se bachaa saken
 carlisle ne usamen naitikta kii bhaavana daali jo pishaach main asaamaanya he or uske jivan ko is prakaar se prerit kiya ki vah maanav ko bhojan ke rup main na khaae
 However, Edward always warns Bella not to live with her and tells her that if she stays with him, her life could be threatened
 vah pishaach james kaa lakshya ban chuki hoti he phir bhi, edward ke sayanm main bela ke vishwaas or uske prati pyaar ke kaaran bela uski chetavanee ko andekha kar detii he
 Unlike the Cullen family, who are "vegetarian vampires", James regularly eats humans as food and will not stop until he drinks Bella's blood
 With the help of his family, Edward saves Bella from falling prey to James, but how to ensure Bella's safety further remains an open question
 new moon main, bela kii suraksha ke liye edward kaa dar or adhik bad jaataa he jab vah apni ungali kaat leti he or uskaa bhai jespar us par hamalaa karata he
 In an attempt to save her, he convinces her that he no longer loves her and leaves Bella and goes away with her family, Bella's heart is broken
 edward ko bela ke bina jeena mushkil lagata he or ek bahut lambe or arthhin jivan kii sambhaavna ke bare main soch kar vah bahut gambhir ho jaataa he
 He accidentally learns from his sister, Roselle, that Bella has attempted suicide, Edward tries to convince a group of Italian vampires, the Volturi, to kill him
 apni bahan elis ke saath, bela italy chali jaati he or edward ko volturi ke dwaara mare jane se bachaa leti he
 Edward explains that this is why he left and apologizes to Bella
 vah ant main use puri tarah se maaf kar detii he or ve apana rishta jari rakhte hai, haalanki edward kabhi bhi chhodkar nahin gaya tha, yahaan yah apwaad he ki bela kaa sambandh jacob blike naamak ek warevolf ke saath he, jise toda nahin ja saktaa he
 Bella successfully obtains the support of Edward's family to transform herself into a vampire
 edward jahaan ek ore is baat ko lekar gusse main he, baad main vah khud use is shart par badalane ke liye sahamat ho jaataa he, yadi vah us se pehle shaadi kare
 In Eclipse, Bella agrees to marry Edward on the condition that he must love her as long as she is human
 edward ant main naram pad jaataa he ore is shart par sahamat ho jaataa he ki yah keval unki shaadi ke baad hi hoga
 The plot is hatched by the vampire Victoria, who seeks to avenge the death of her partner James, hunting Bella and creating new vampires to form an army
 saim ule or jacob blike ke netritv main mul america warevolf samooh or culence ke bich sangharsh viraam hota he, jacob blike bela kaa mitra he, jo tab uske saath tha jab edward ne uskaa dil todow haalanki, sangharsh viraam khatre main pad jaataa he, jab bela ko yah mahasoos hopta he ki uske liye jacob uski soch se zyada mahatvapurn he
 Ultimately, Edward admits that Bella cares for Jacob and he successfully kills Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is the most important person in her life
 edward bela ko bataata he ki ve shaadi se pehle pyaar karne kii koshish kar sakate hai, kyonki use ahsaas hota he ki vah apane jivan kaa adhikansh bhaag dusron ko khush karne ke liye vyateet karti he
 However, she refuses his offer and says that she will do whatever is right: marriage, love and then becoming a vampire
 braking don main edward or bela kii shaadi hoti he
 Bella becomes pregnant on her honeymoon and the rapid growth of a half-human, half-vampire fetus affects Bella's health
 edward uske khud ke jivan ko bachaane ke liye use garbhpaat karaane ke liye majaboor karata he
 However, Bella falls in love with her unborn child and insists on giving birth to him
 is vichaar ko sunne ke baad edward bhi bachche ke saath pyaar mahasoos karata he, use yah pataa chalata he ki baccha bhi bela ko pyaar karata he
 Bella arrives in an emergency Caesarean section to die while giving birth, but Edward is able to deliver his daughter and then injects her venom into Bella's heart
 use ek amar pishaach main badal kar uske ghaavon ko thik kar detaa he
 During Bella's painful conversion, Jacob's imprint is clearly visible on his daughter Renesmee
 irina naamak ek pishaach galati se renesmi ko ek amar pishaach baccha samaj letaa he- ek aisa nirmaan jise pishaach duniya main sweekaar nahin kiya gaya ho- volturi culence ko nasht karne ke liye pahunchate hai
 Edward, along with Bella and his colleagues, tries to convince Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child and will not pose any threat to their existence
 edward ko pustak main or bela ke dwaara ek aakarshak, vinamr, drudh nishchayi or bahut hi ziddee bataaya gaya he
 He is very defensive and takes care of Bella, having a sense of humanity and well-being for her
 vah aksar paristhitiyon kaa zarurat se zyada vishleshan karata he or uski zarurat se zyada pratikriya darshane kii pravriti he, vishesh rup se tab jab bela kii suraksha khatre main ho
 He takes into account some of the things said in his human life in the early 20th century
 edward apane aap ki ek rakshas maanata he or bela ke saath pyaar ho jane ke baad, uski dili ichha hoti he ki vah ek pishaach ke bajaay manushya hota
 Like all vampires in the Twilight series, Bella describes Edward for being impossibly handsome
 shrinkhalaa main kai jagah par, vah uski tulana puranic greek bhagwaan adonis se karti he
 His skin is "like marble" - very pale, ice cold and glowing in the sun
 vah kahati he ke uske chehre ke nain naksh bilkul sahi or koniya hai- uthi hui gaalon kii haddiyaan, majboot jabade, ek sidhi naak or puure hoth
 uske bal, jo hameshaa uljhe rahete hai, unamem asaamaanya kaanse jaisi chaaya padati he, yah lakshan use maanav jivan main apni jaivik maa se viraasat main mila he
 His eyes, which used to be green, are now topaz
 uskaa rup badal jaataa he, yadi vah bahut der tak kuch na khaae: uski ankhen gahari ho jaati hai, lagbhag kaali dikhne lagati hai or uski ankhon ke neeche bangnee nishaan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Edward is 6'2 "tall and has a lean but muscular body
 " Edward, like all the vampires in the Twilight series, has the super-human ability, speed, endurance and agility and is inhumanly handsome
 uski khushboo or aawaaj bela ko bahut aakarshith karte hai, itnaa zyada ki vah kabhi kabhi madamast ho jaati he
 In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not have to breathe, although he can habitually do so and it also helps him smell the atmosphere
 vah niyamit rup se khaanaa hajam nahin kar saktaa he or apane liye iske aakarshan kii tulana is baat se karata he jaise ek samaanya vyakti dhul mitti khaataa ho
 saath hi, anya pishaachon kii tarah, edward so nahin saktaa he
 In addition to traits similar to his fellow vampires, Edward has some abilities that only he possesses
 vah culence main sabase tej he, unamem se kisi se bhi aage badhane ke yogya he
 Perhaps as a result of his genius for empathy in his human life, Edward can also read someone's mind a few miles from him; Bella is the only exception to this rule, according to Meyer it is because Bella's mind is very personal
 edward ne apane 20 veen sadi ke prarambh ke maanav jivan ke bhaashan ke praturup or paaramparik maansikta ko bhi barkaraar rakhaa he
 Edward is proficient in musical art, can play the piano like a virtuoso
 vah sangeet kii ek vyapak range kaa anand uthaata he, jisamen shastreey sangeet, jaiz, progressive metal, vaikalpik rock or pank rock shaamil hai, lekin vah desh ko pasand nahin karata he
 He likes mainstream indie rock and appreciates rock and classical music equally
 vah tvilit main ullekh karata he ki vah saath ke dashak kii tulana main pachaas ke dashak ke sangeet ko adhik pasand karata he or sattar ke dashak ke sangeet ko pasand nahin karata he or kahata he ki assi ke dashak kaa sangeet "sahane yogya" tha
 One of Edward's hobbies is collecting cars
 uske paas ek volvo 60 r he or ek eston martin V12 venkvish he jiskaa upyog vah ek "vishesh avasar" par karata he
 She also gave a Porsche 911 Turbo as a gift to her sister Alice in Eclipse
 2008 kii "tvilit film" ke liye edward kii bhoomika se pehle, meyar ne kaha ki haalanki edward "kii bhoomika nibhaana nirvivaadit rup se sabase kathin tha, phir bhi vah ek maatr vyakti tha jiske bare main maine faisla kiya
 The only actor i have seen to date, which i think is very close to the role of Edward Cullen, is
 xxrep 7 
 Henry Cavill
 When the film was optioned by Sumit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated; "the most disappointing thing for me
 mere adarsh edward ko khona", chunki us samay kavil 24 varsh kaa tha, is prakaar se is bhoomika ko vaastaviktaa se nibhaane ke liye uski umr bahut adhik thi
 Meyer reported on his website that the four most popular fans suggested to play Edward were Hayden Christenson, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerald Way
 On 11 December 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, best known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, was selected for the role
 erik fig, jo summit entertenment ke utpaadan ke adhyaksh hai, ne kaha: "ek aisi bhoomika ke liye ek sahi abhinayta kaa chayan karnaa hameshaa ek chunauti hota he, jo pathakon kii kalpana main itnaa taaja ho, lekin hamane is jimmedaari ko gambhirthapurvak liya or hamen rob patinson par vishwaas he, ki hamen tvilit main bela ke liye sahi edward mil gaya he
 Meyer said that; "I am happy with Sumit's choice for Edward
 There are very few actors who look dangerous at the same time and handsome and even fewer actors who can be seen as Edward in the picture
 Robert Pattinson is very Are amazing tvilit ke nirdeshak, ketherin hardvik, ne casting prakriya ke bare main kaha ki "har kisi ke paas is tarah kii edward kii adarsh drushti he
 They were crazy
 jaise, boodhi mahilaon ne kaha "tumne ise behatar tareeke se praapt kiya" usne bataaya ki vah shuru main patinson kii ek photo se adhik prabhavit nahin thim, lekin uske audishan ke bare main kaha jo sahyogi abhinetri cristan stewart ke saath ek prem drishy tha: "yah bijli kii tarah tha" cameraa khul gaya, khala aasmaan dikhaayi diya or main, aisa lag rahaa tha jaise "yah acha hone vaala he" patinson ne kaha, "mujhe nahin pataa tha, ki jab main andar gaya to is bhoomika ko kaise nibhaana he, lekin audishan ke dauraan yah acha rahaa
 After that i really wanted it, but i didn't really know what it was
 main sach main inamen se koi bhi kitaab nahin padhi thi
 But just "I want to do this job" it became even more attractive because of Kristen
 2008 ke prarambh main, patinson ne entertenment vikali main apni casting ke khilaaf ek prashansak kii pratikriya ke bare main kaha ki "hasstakshar dekhakar maine padhnaa band kar diya or kaha 'kripaya koi or' usne evening standard ko bataaya; "kitabon main is bare main bahut kuch he or naaraaz logon ne bahut saare khat likhen hai, jinamein mujhe ve bataate hai ki main sambhawatah edward kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa saktaa kyonki main digori hum
 mujhe aashaa he ki main unhen galat sabit kar sakuun
 After a tour of the set in April 2008, Mayer said that Pattinson and Stewart had created such a good chemistry that "it could cause hyperventilation"
 patinson ne bataaya ki meyar ne use midnit san kii ek praarambhik copy uphaar main di thi- jo tvilit kii ghatnaon ko phir se bataati he, jise edward ke drushtikon se prastut kiya gaya he
 He explained that: "that's what i wanted about work, because this person doesn't really exist that much, so you can do whatever you want
" to, maine jab paaya ki edward ke drushtikon se ek or pustak upasthit he, hamaara bhi saamaan drushtikon tha
 In preparation for this role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and kept distance from his family and friends, saying that he "wants to feel alienated" physically, telling him, "six-me
" The pack was expected
 lekin vastav main aisa nahin ho paaya
 One scene in the story features Edward, a talented pianist, who composes a lullaby for Bella
 patinson ko is drishy par sochane ke liye ek rachana prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya, hardvik ke saath usne kaha; "maine use bataaya tha use ek hi likhnaa chahie or ham dekhte hai ki ham yah kaam kar paaenge yaa nahin, kyonki yadi yah rob kaa gaanaa hota to vastav main bahut acha hota
 vah ek sundar sangeetkaar he, ek bahut hi rachanaatmak aatma he or edward se bahut adhik miltaa julata he
 He reads only the most interesting books and watches the most interesting films and is very self-observant and dives into his existence
 meyer ne manjuuri de di; "yadi robert ek lulaabi likh saktaa he, to yah nishchit rup se film ke jaadu ko badhaayegaa, kya aisa nahin he?jahaan ek ore patinson kii rachanaaen antim film main dikhaayi detii hai, lulaabi kaa chayan carter burvell kii rachana main se kiya gaya
 In April 2008, Hardwick, upon seeing Pattinson's first photo, uttered encouraging words as his initial response, "the great thing about him is that he really feels as if he is from another world
 meraa matlab he, vah ek saadhaaran aadmi kii tarah nahin dikhataa he
 And when you read the book, you will think that 'is there anyone on this earth who looks like this description?' lekin mujhe lagata he vah karata he
 He is settled in the face of this character, his photo looks exactly like that described in the book
 jab aap uske ubhare hue gaalon, gade hue jabade kii haddi, ore ani chizon ke bare main padhate hai, to aap kahenge, 'vaah
 At every turn, whenever he acts like a hero, he still thinks that he is the most ridiculous selfish evil-ridden creature in his environment
 vah uske liye bela ke pyaar ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar detaa he, lekin saath hi use isaki zarurat he, yah kahani kii zarurat he
 "after the production of the film, at comiccon in July 2008, Pattinson called Twilight's experience" bizarre "
 You know in a way that this is basically the book
 pustak ke bahut se vafaadaar jununee prashansak he
 It is strange, because people immediately relate to that character, not see you as an actor
 patinson ne tvilit ke sikval new moon ore eclips main kaam karne ke liye sin kar diya he
 In an interview, Pattinson states that he never underwent any formal training on this American accent

 unke drushtikon kaa pataa is baat se chal saktaa he ki skulon main pathkram ko anukramit kiya jaataa he or puure sanyukt rajya america main priskool centaron ke adhyaapan main unke drushtikon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Knowledge: During this phase, the child learns about himself and his environment through motivational and transitional actions
 vichaar, indriyabodh or harakat se utpann hota he
 The child learns that he is separate from his environment and that aspects of his environment, ie his parents or favorite toy, are present even when they are not beyond your understanding
 At this stage, the child's learning should be shifted to the cognitive system
 aap haavbhaav dikhaakar arthath tevar dikhaakar, ek kathor yaa sukhadaayak aawaaj kaa istemaal karke vyavhaar ko badal sakate hai; ye sabhi upyukt takanic hai
 Pre-operative: Using new language knowledge, the child begins to use signs to represent objects
 is charan ke armbh main vah vastuon kaa maanvikaran bhi karata he
 He is now better able to think about things and events that are not immediately present
 vartmaan ke prati unmukh hone par bachche ko samay ke bare main apana vichaar banane main takalif hoti he
 Imagination is influenced by his thinking and he sees things in the way he wants to see them and he believes that other people also see those situations from the same perspective
 vah jaankaree hasil karata he or uske baad vah us jaankaree ko apane vichaaron ke anuroop apane man main parivartit kar letaa he
 While teaching - it is necessary to keep in mind the vivid imagination of the child and his undeveloped understanding of time
 tatasth shabdon, sharir kii ruparekha or chhu sakane laayak upkaran kaa istemaal karne se bachche ke sakriy shikshan main madad milti he
 Their thinking is based on the organism, that is, it considers all living and living things to be alive
 moort sankriyaatmak avasthaa' : is charan ke dauraan, samaayojan kshamta main vruddhi hoti he
 The child develops the ability to think in a senseless way and to make rational judgments about a sensible or visible phenomenon from the senses which he had to use in the past to understand his physical vision
 is bachche ko sikhaane-padhaane ke dauraan use sawaal poochne or chizon yaa baton ko waapas aapako samajhane kaa mauka dene se use maansik drushti se us jaankaree kaa istemaal karne main aasaani hoti he
 Intangible operational state ': This stage gives cognition its final form
 is vyakti ko tarksangat nirnay karne ke liye ab kabhi pahchaanane yogya vastuon kii jarurat nahin padati he
 He can give hypothetical and deductive arguments on his point
 kishori-kishoriyon ko sikhaane-padhaane kaa kshetra kaaphi vistrut ho saktaa he kyonki ve kai drushtikonon se kai sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karne main sakasham hote hai
 Vygotsky was a thinker who worked during the first decades of the former Soviet Union
 unka maananaa tha ki bachche vyaavhaarik anubhav ke madhyam se sikhte hai jaise ki piyajet ne suzav diya tha
 However, unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults can help children learn new tasks when a child is on the verge of learning a new task
 is takanic ko "scafolding " kaha jaataa he kyonki yah nae gyaan ke saath bacchon ke paas pehle se maujuud gyaan par nirmit hota he jisase vayask bachche ko seekhney main madad mil sakati he
 An example of this can be found when a mother or father "helps" a child to clap their hands or clap their hands for a pat-a-cake poem as long as they themselves clap their hands or Does not learn to clap and rotate round and round
 bhaigatski kaa dhyaan puri tarah se bachche ke vikaas kii paddati kaa nirdhaaran karne main samskruti kii bhoomika par kendrit tha
 He argued that every act appears twice in the child's cultural development: first at the social level and later at the individual level; First between people and then within the child
 It is equally applicable in voluntary attention, logical memory, and concept formation
 sabhi ucch kaaryon kii utpatti vyaktiyon ke bich ke vaastavik sambandhon ke rup main hoti he
 Vygotsky felt that development was a process and saw periods of crisis in the child's development during which there was a qualitative change in the child's mental functioning
 anuraag yaa lagaav kaa siddhant ek manovaigyanik, vikasmoolak or charitra gathan sambandhi siddhant he jisaki utpatti jon boulbi kii rachana main hui thi or jise mairi aainsaworth ne viksit kiya tha; yah manushyon ke bich ke antarvaiyaktik sambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ek varnanaatmak or vyaakhyaatmak ruparekha pradaan karata he
 Anurag theorists believe that for the normal social and emotional development of a human baby, it is necessary to have a relationship with at least one caregiver
 arikson naamak frid ke ek anuyaayi ne frid ke saath-saath apane swayan ke siddhanton ko sanshleshit karke jis siddhant rachana kii use maanav vikaas ke "manosamaajik" charnon ke naam se janaa jaataa he; isaki samay seemaa janm se mrityu tak he or jo har charan main jin "kaaryon" par dhyaan kendrit karata he un kaaryon ko jivan kii chunautiyon kaa safaltaapurvak maargdarshan karne ke liye puraa karnaa jaruri he
 John b
 Watson's pragmatism theory forms the foundation of a practical model of development
 unhone bachche ke vikaas par bahut kuch likhaa or kai shodh kiye 
 vyavhaar siddhant kii dhara ke nirmaan main wiliam james kii chetana dhara drushtikon ke sanshodhan main watasan madadgaar sabit hue

 B
 Watson following Watson's leadership
 F
 Skinner later extended this model to cover operant conditioning and verbal behavior
 yon chaalit hone ke naate ek buniyadi maanav prerana ke apane drushtikon ke anusaar sigmund frid ne shaishvavastha se aage maanav vikaas kaa ek manoyon siddhant viksit kiya or use paanch charnon main vibhajit kiya
 Each phase was centered around the ejaculatory area of the body or the satisfaction of libido within a particular area
 unhone yah bhi tark diya ki manushyon kaa jaise-jaise vikaas hota he vaise-vaise ve apane vikaas ke charnon ke madhyam se alag-alag or vishisht vastuon par sthir hote jate hai
 Each stage has differences that need to be resolved to enable the child's development
 vikaas ke vichaar ke liye ek dhaanche ke rup main gatyaatmak pranaaliyon ke siddhant kaa istemaal 1990 ke dashak ke armbh main shuru hua or vartmaan sadi main iskaa istemaal abhi bhi jari he
 Dynamic system theory emphasizes nonlinear relationships and the ability of a system to reorganize as a phase change that is stage-like in nature
 vikasvaadiyon ke liye ek anya upyogi avadharana aakarshankarta kii sthiti he; yah avasthaa jaahir taur par asambandhit vyavhaaron ke saath-saath sambandhit vyavhaaron kaa bhi nirdhaaran karne main madad karti he
 Dynamic system theory is extensively applied in the study of motor development; This theory also has a deep connection with some of Bowlby's view of attachment systems
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant kaa sambandh vyavhaar prakriya kii avadharana se bhi he jo ek parsparik baatcheet prakriya he jisamen bachche or mata-pita ek saath ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai jisase samay-samay par donon main vikasaatmak parivartan hota he
 The core knowledge perspective is a developmental theory in child development that proposes that "infants' lives begin with intuitive and special-purpose knowledge systems that are referred to as core domains of thinking"
 There are five core domains of thinking, each of which is very important for survival defense, which together prepare us for the development of key aspects of initial cognition; They are: physical, numerical, linguistic, psychological and biological
 haalaanki vikasaatmak lakshyon kii pahchaan karnaa shodhakartaaon or bacchon kii dekharekh karne waalon ke liye ek dilachasp kaam he lekin phir bhi vikasaatmak parivartan ke kai pahalu satat hote hai or ve parivartan ke dikhaai dene yogya milastons ko pradarshit nahin karte hai
 Continuous developmental changes, such as growth in stature, involve considerable gradual and predictable progress toward adult characteristics
 haalaanki jab vikasaatmak parivartan asatat hota he tab shodhakarta na keval vikaas ke milastons kii balki aksar charan kahe jane vaale sambandhit aayu avadhiyon kii bhi pahchaan kar sakate hai
 a phase is a period of time often associated with a known chronological age range during which a behavior or physical feature is qualitatively different from other stages
 jab kisi aayu avadhi ko ek charan ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he to is shabd kaa matlab keval gunatmak antar nahin hota he balki iskaa matlab vikasaatmak ghatnaon kaa ek purvanumey kram bhi hota he jaise ki prayek charan se pehle or baad main vishisht vyavaharik yaa shaareerik gunon ke saath judi anya vishisht avadhiyaan hoti hai
 Stages of development may occur simultaneously or may be associated with other specific aspects of development such as speaking or walking
 Even the transition to a stage in a particular developmental area may not mean that the previous phase is completely finished
 udhaaharan ke liye, vyaktitv ke charnon ke bare main arikson kii charchaa main yah siddhantkaar suzav detaa he ki un muddon par nae sire se kaam karne main jivan biit jaataa he jo multah bachapan ke charan kii visheshtaayen thi
 Similarly, Ciaget, a theorist of cognitive development, described situations in which children could solve one type of problem using mature thinking skills but could not cater for less familiar problems; He named this phenomenon horizontal decalage
 haalaanki vikasaatmak parivartan kalanukramik aayu ke saath-saath chalata he, vikaas main swayan aayu kaa koi yogadan nahin hota he
 The basic mechanism or cause of developmental changes are genetic and environmental factors
 anuvanshik kaarak koshikeey parivartanon jaise samgr vikaas, sharir or dimag ke hisson ke anupaat main hone vaale parivartanon or drushti evam aahaar sambandhi jaruraton jaise kaary ke pahaluon kii paripakvata ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Because jeans can be "off" and "on", the function of an individual's initial genotype may change from time to time, leading to further developmental change
 vikaas ko prabhavit karne vaale paryaavarniya karkon main aahaar evam rog jokhim ke saath-saath saamaajik, bhaavnaatmak or sangyanatmak anubhav bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, examination of environmental factors also suggests that young humans can also survive a fairly wide range of environmental experiences
 swatantra kriyavidhi ke rup main kaam karne ke bajaay anuvanshik or paryaavarniya kaarak aksar ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai jisaki vajah se vikasaatmak parivartan hota he
 Some aspects of a child's development are notable for their plasticity or the extent to which the direction of development is guided by environmental factors as well as initiated by genetic factors
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisa lagata he ki allergy sambandhi pratikriyaaon kaa vikaas apekshaakrit rup se praarambhik jivan ke kuch paryaavarniya karkon ke jokhim kii vajah se hota he or praarambhik jokhim se suraksha karne se bachche main parivarti allergic pratikriya ke dikhaai dene kii kam sambhaavna rah jaati he
 When initial experience has a great impact on any aspect of development, it is said that it shows a lot of plasticity; When genetic nature is the primary factor of development, it is said that plasticity is low
 namaneeyata main antarjaat karkon jaise hormone ke saath-saath bahirzaat karkon jaise sankraman kaa maargdarshan shaamil ho saktaa he
 a variety of environmental guidance for development is described as experience-dependent plasticity in which behavior changes as a result of learning from the environment
 is prakaar namaneeyata jivan bhar ho sakati he or isamen kuch bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaaon sahit kai tarah ke vyavhaar shaamil ho sakate hai
 a second type of plasticity, experience-expected plasticity, involves considerable influence of specific experiences during limited sensitive periods of development
 udhaaharan ke liye, do ankhon kaa samanvit upyog or prayek aankh main prakaash dwaara nirmit dwiaiami chhaviyon ke bajaay ek ekal triayami chhavi kaa anubhav jivan ke pehle varsh kii duusari chamahi ke dauraan drushti ke saath anubhavon par nirbhar karata he
 Experience-expectant plasticity serves to correct developmental aspects that may not achieve optimal results as a result of genetic factors
 vikaas ke kuch pahaluon main namaneeyata ke astitv ke alaava, anuvaanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh vyakti kii paripakv visheshtaon ke nirdhaaran main kai tarah se kaary kar sakate hai
 Genetic-environmental correlations are situations in which genetic factors are likely to have some degree of experience
 udhaaharan ke liye, niskriy anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh main, ek bachche ko kisi vishesh paryaavaran kaa anubhav hone kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki uske mata-pita kaa anuvanshik swabhaav unhen aise kisi maahaul ko chunane yaa banane ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 The genetically evolved characteristics of the child in the suggestive genetic – environmental correlation cause others to respond in certain ways that give them a different environment that a genetically different child can find; For example, a child with Down syndrome may be treated more protective and less challenging than a child with a non-down syndrome
 ant main, ek sakriy anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh ek aisa sambandh he jisamen baccha un anubhavon ko chunata he jo badale main un par prabhaav daalata ho; udhaaharan ke liye, ek hrisht-pusht sakriy baccha skool ke baad ke khel anubhavon ko chun saktaa he jisase vardhit athlettic kaushal kaa nirmaan hota he lekin shaayad sangeet kii shiksha main baadha aa sakati he
 In all of these cases, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether the child's characteristics were formed by a combination of genetic factors or experiences or both
 bachche ke vikaas kii ek upyogi samaj ko sthapit karne ke liye vikasaatmak ghatnaon ke bare main vyavasthit poochtacha kii aavashyaktaa he
 Different aspects of development involve different methods and causes of change, so there is no simple way to summarize a child's development
 phir bhi, prayek vishay ke bare main kuch sawaalon ke jawaab dene se vikasaatmak parivartan ke vibhinn pahaluon ke bare main tulaneey jaankaree mil sakati he
 Waters and his colleagues have suggested the following questions for this purpose
 in sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke liye kiye jane vaale anubhavjanya shodh main kai paddatiyon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Initially, supervisory research under natural conditions may be needed to develop a detailed description and definition of an aspect of developmental change, such as changes in variable responses in the first year
 is prakaar ke kaam ke baad sahasambandhi adhyayan, kalanukramik aayu ke bare main jaankaree ikaitha karnaa or shabdaawalee vikaas jaise kuch khaas tarah ke vikaas ko kiya ja saktaa he; parivartan ke bare main bataane ke liye sahasambandhi aankadon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Such studies examine the characteristics of children at different ages
 in tareekon main anudairdhya adhyayan shaamil ho sakate hai jinamein bacchon ke ek samooh kii kai baar phir se jaanch kii jaati he jab ve bade hote hai, yaa paar-anubhageeya adhyayan shaamil ho sakate hai jinamein alag-alag umr ke bacchon ke samoohon kii ek baar jaanch kii jaati he or ek duusare ke saath unki tulana kii jaati he, yaa in tareekon kaa ek sangyojan shaamil ho saktaa he
 Some studies related to child development necessarily examine the effects of experience or heredity by comparing the characteristics of different groups of children in a nonrandom design
 anya adhyayanon main bacchon ke samoohon ke liye parinaamon kii tulana karne ke liye yadrichhik diginon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jinhen alag-alag hastkshep yaa shaikshik upachaar miltaa he
 Milestones are changes in specific physical and mental abilities that mark the end of one developmental period and the beginning of another developmental period
 charan siddhanton ke liye milastons se charan parivartan kaa sanket miltaa he
 Studies of the completeness of many developmental tasks have established specific chronological ages associated with developmental milestones
 haalaanki, saamaanya seemaa ke bheetar vikasaatmak chakron vaale bacchon ke bich bhi milastons kii prapti main kaaphi antar he
 Some milestones are more variable than others; For example, receptive speech indicators show considerable variation in hearing impaired children in general but expressive speech milestones can be quite variable
 bachche ke vikaas se sambandhit ek aam chintaa vikasaatmak deree he jisamen mahatvapurn vikasaatmak milastons ke liye ek aayu-vishisht kshamta main deree shaamil he
 Prevention of developmental delay and early intervention in it is an important topic of study of the child's development
 vikasaatmak deree kii pahchaan kisi milastone kii vishisht parivartaneeyata ke saath tulana karke, na ki uplabdhi main ausat aayu ke sambandh main, kerani chahie
 An example of a milestone might be eye and hand coordination that involves the child's increased ability to manipulate objects in a coordinated manner
 aayu-vishisht milastonon ke badhate gyaan se mata-pita or dusron ko uchit vikaas par najar rakhane main aasaani hoti he
 The issue of child development is not a solitary subject but it progresses differently for different aspects of the individual to some extent
 yahan kai shaareerik or maansik visheshtaon ke vikaas kaa varnan diya gaya he
 xxrep 4 = What develops? After birth, physical development takes place in the area of height and weight from 15 to 20 years of age; Growing at the right time, the average birth weight is 3
5 kg and the average length is 50 cm as the person grows to full adult size
 jaise-jaise kad or vajan badhata jaataa he vaise-vaise vyakti ke shaareerik anupaat bhi badalte hai, navjaat shishu kaa sir apekshaakrit bada or dhad tathaa baaki ang chote hote hai jo ki vayask hone par apekshaakrit rup se chote sir or lambey dhad tathaa angon main parinat ho jaataa he
 The pace of physical development accelerates in the months following birth and slows down thereafter, so birth weight doubles in the first four months and triples at 12 months of age but does not quadruple by 24 months
 yauvan ke thodaa pehle tak vikaas dhimi gati se hota rahata he,uske baad vikaas kii gati kaaphi teevr ho jaati he
 There is no uniformity in the rate and timing of growth in all parts of the body
 janm ke samay sir kaa aakaar pehle se hi lagbhag ek vayask ke sir ke aakaar kii tarah hota he lekin sharir ke nichle hisse vayask ke nichle hisson kii tulana main kaaphi chote hote hai
 After that, in the course of development, the head gradually becomes smaller and there is a rapid development in the torso and other organs
 vruddhi dar ke nirdhaaran main or khaas taur par aarambhik maanav vikaas kii anupaatik visheshta main hone vaale parivartanon ke nirdhaaran main anuvanshik karkon kii ek mukhya bhoomika hoti he
 However, due to genetic factors, maximum growth can occur only when environmental conditions are favorable
 Poor nutrition and frequent injury and disease can cause a person's adult stature to decline, but due to the best environment, the height may not increase as much as is determined by heredity
 vruddhi ke kshetra main jansankhya antar kaaphi had tak vayask ke kad se sambandhit hote hai
 Children of castes that live much longer in adulthood tend to be taller at birth and during childhood than groups with shorter adult stature
 purush bhi kuch had tak lambey hote hai haalaanki vayask avasthaa main majboot yon dvirupta vaale jatigat samoohon main yah adhik spasht hota he
 Particularly malnourished people also remain small or short throughout life
 haalaanki vruddhi dar or paddati main jansankhya antar adhik nahin hota he, sivaay iske ki kharaab paryaavarniya paristhitiyaan yauvan or sambandhit vruddhi dar main deree kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Apparently the different ages of boys and girls at puberty mean that boys and girls aged 11 or 12 are at significantly different levels of maturity and in contrast to normal sex differences in terms of physical size
 Can occur
 bachapan main kad or vajan ke maamle main kaaphi vyaktigat antar hota he
 Some of these differences are due to family genetic factors and other differences are environmental factors, but individual differences in reproductive maturation have a greater impact on them at some point in the course of development
 shaareerik gatividhi kii kshamtaaon main bachapan ke dauraan mote taur par yuva shishu kii parivarti gatividhi paddatiyon se bachapan or kishoravastha kii ati kushal svaichhik gativadhi visheshta main parivartan hota he
 The speed of motor development accelerates in early life because many of the newborn's variable activities change or disappear within the first year and later slow down
 shaareerik vruddhi kii tarah motor vikaas se bhi sephalokodel or proximodystal vikaas kii purvanumey paddatiyon kaa pataa chalata he or sharir ke nichle hisse yaa haathon or pairon se pehle sir ke antim sire or adhik kendriya kshetron kii gatividhiyon yaa harkaton par niyantran sthapit ho jaataa he
 The types of activity develop in stages like stages; For example, for 6 to 8 months of action, crawling on both hands and both legs and then trying to stand up, "clinging" to something while holding it, holding an adult's hand and finally moving freely Walking is included
 bade bachche agal-bagal yaa peeche-peeche chalakar, teji se chalakar yaa daudkar, kudakar, ek pair se langhakar or duusare pair se chalakar or ant main langhakar is kram ko jari rakhte hai
 By mid-childhood and adolescence, new motor skills are acquired through instruction or supervision rather than a predictable sequence
 motor vikaas main shaamil kriyavidhiyon yaa prakriyaaon main kuch anuvanshik ghatak shaamil hote hai jo ek nirdisht aayu main sharir ke hisson ke shaareerik aakaar ke saath-saath mansapeshiyon or haddiyon kii takat se jude pahaluon kaa bhi nirdhaaran karte hai
 Nutrition and exercise also determine strength, and therefore also determine the ease and accuracy with which a body part can be moved
 harakat karne ke avasaron se sharir ke hisson ko jhukaane or failaane kii kshamtaaon kii sthapana main madad milti he jinamein se donon kshamtaayen acchhee motor kshamta ke liye jaruri hai
 Skilled voluntary activities develop as a result of practice and learning
 saamaanya vyakti kii motor kshamta saamaanya hoti he or yah kuch had tak bachche ke vajan or nirmaan par nirbhar karti he
 However, the practice, supervision, and instruction of specific activities have a major impact on normal personal differences after infancy
 asaamaanya motor vikaas swaleenta yaa mastishk pakshaaghaat jaisi samasyaon yaa vikasaatmak vilamb kaa ek sanket ho saktaa he
 There are also some population differences in the field of motor development under which girls get some benefit from the use of small muscles, including the pronunciation of sounds from lips and tongue
 navjaat shishuon kii parivarti gatividhiyon main jaateey antar hone kii khabar mili he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki kuch jaivik kaarak bhi kriyasheel hai
 Cultural differences can encourage learning of motor skills such as using only the left hand for hygiene purposes and the use of the right hand for all other tasks that make up the population gap
 abhyaas vaali svaichhik gatividhiyon main saanskrithik karkon ko bhi kriyasheel rup main dekha jaataa he jaise footbal ko aage kii taraf le jane ke liye pair kaa istemaal karnaa yaa basketbaal ko aage kii taraf le jane ke liye haath kaa istemaal karnaa
 Young children have the ability to learn, remember and symbolize information and solve problems at a normal level that can perform cognitive tasks such as discriminating between conscious and unconscious creatures or identifying small numbers of objects
 bachapan main seekhney or jaankaree ko sansaadhit karne kii gati bad jaati he, smriti bhi badhati chali jaati he or sanket upyog or sankshepan kii kshamta main tab tak vikaas hota he jab tak kishoravastha lagbhag vayask str tak nahin pahunch jaati he
 Cognitive development has genetic and other biological mechanisms as seen in many genetic factors of mental retardation
 haalaanki yah maan lene ke baavjood ki mastishk kaaryon kii vajah sangyanatmak ghatnaayen hoti hai, vishisht mastishk parivartanon ko maapna or yah dikhaanaa sambhav nahin he ki unki vajah se hi sangyanatmak parivartan hote hai
 Developmental advancements in the field of cognition are also related to experience and learning and this is mainly a matter of high-level competencies such as summarization which largely depends on formal education
 un umron main saamaanya vyaktigat antar dekhne ko milte hai jin umron main vishisht sangyanatmak kshamtaaon kii prapti hoti he lekin audyogic deshon main bacchon kii schuli shiksha is dharna par aadhaarit hoti he ki ye antar bahut bade nahin hai
 Abnormal delays in cognitive development can cause problems for children in cultures that demand advanced cognitive skills for work and for independent living
 sangyanatmak vikaas ke kshetra main bahut kam jansankhya antar dekhne ko milte hai
 There are some differences in the skills and preferences of boys and girls but a lot happens together in groups
 aisa lagata he ki alag-alag jaateey samoohon kii sangyanatmak uplabdhi main paae jane vaale antar saanskrithik yaa anya paryaavarniya karkon ke parinaam hai
 Newborns probably do not experience fear nor do they prefer to establish contact with a particular person
 lagbhag 8 se 12 maheenon tak unamem kaaphi teji se parivartan hota he or gyaat khataron se bhaybheet ho jate hai; ve parichit logon ko variyata bhi dene lag jate hai or unase alag hone par yaa kisi ajanabi ke saamne aane par unamem chintaa or dukh ke bhav nazar aane lagate hai
 Empathy and the ability to understand social rules begin in the preschool period and continue to develop in the adult period
 madhya bachapan main hamaumr bacchon ke saath dosti or kishoravastha main kaamuktha se judi bhaawanaaon or romantic prem kii shuruyaat hoti he
 There is a lot of anger during the childhood and early preschool period and adolescence
 saamaajik bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke kuch pahaluon, jaise sahanubhuti, kaa vikaas dhire-dhire hota he lekin anya pahaluon, jaise bhay, main bachche kii bhaavana ke anubhav kaa ek apekshaakrit achaanak punargathan shaamil ho saktaa he
 Sexual and romantic feelings develop in relation to physical maturity
 aisa lagata he ki anuvanshik kaarak purvanumey aayu main hone vaale bhay or parichit logon ke prati lagaav jaise kuch saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak vikaason ko niyantrit karte hai
 Experience plays a major role in determining what people are familiar with, what social rules are followed and how anger is expressed
 saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke kram main vyaktigat antar kaa hona koi aam baat nahin he lekin ek saamaanya bachche se duusare saamaanya bachche kii bhaawanaaon kii tivrata yaa abhivyaktitv main bahut zyada antar ho saktaa he
 The individualistic tendencies of the various types of reactions are perhaps natural and are referred to as a natural difference
 saamaajik bhaavnaatmak visheshtaon kaa asaamaanya vikaas thodaa alag kism ho saktaa he yaa itnaa gambhir ho saktaa he ki isse maansik beemaari kaa sanket milane lage
 Temperamental symptoms are considered to be stable and durable during life time
 ummid he ki shaishvavastha main sakriy or krodhit rahane vaale bachche bade bacchon, kishoron or vayaskon ke rup main sakriy or krodhi ho sakate hai
 Population differences may exist in older children, for example if they have learned that it is appropriate for children to express emotion or behave differently than girls, or if customs learned by children of an ethnic group - Rivaz is different from customs learned by another child
 kisi nirdisht aayu ke ladakon or ladakiyon ke bich kaa saamaajik or bhaavnaatmak antar donon lingon kii yauvan visheshtaon ke samay ke antar se bhi judaa hua ho saktaa he
 In addition to acquiring highly spoken vocabulary, there are four main areas in which a child must acquire competence regardless of the language spoken or spoken
 inhen dhwani vigyaan yaa dhwani, arth vigyaan yaa kutabaddh arth, vaakya rachana yaa shabdon ko sanyukt karne kaa tarika or yathatathy yaa alag-alag paristhitiyon main bhashaa kaa istemaal karne ke gyaan ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 There is a gradual development in receptive language, which begins at about 6 months of age
 haalaanki bhavvaahak bhashaa or shabdon ke nirmaan main, lagbhag ek saal kii umr main isaki shuruyaat ke baad se kaaphi teji aa jaati he or saath main duusare saal ke bich main drut shabd adhigrahan kaa ek "shabdaawalee visphot" sa hone lagata he
 This vocabulary extension is closely associated with the ability to repeat spoken words and enables rapid acquisition of skills in their pronunciation
 vyakaranik niyam or shabd sangyojan lagbhag do saal kii umr main dikhaai dete hai
 The mastery of vocabulary and grammar continues slowly through the preschool and school years
 kishor-kishoriyon ke paas abhi bhi vayaskon kii tulana main kam shabdasangrah hote hai or pasive wois jaisi sanrachanaon ke saath adhik kathinaayee kaa anubhav hota he
 Children up to one month old can pronounce "ooh" sounds, perhaps resulting from pleasant interactions with caregivers in a mutual "conversation"
 stern ke mutabik, yah prakriya kisi aapasi, layaaddh baatcheet main vayask or shishu ke bich ke prabhaav kaa sanchaar he
 The anticipation of subsequent negotiation transactions considers surmounting and "gay-coupling" in which the infant and adult have different roles

 It is believed that an important part of dialect development is the time caregivers spend to "guess" what their baby is trying to say and thus integrate the child with his or her social world is
 shishur ke uccharanon main vaicharikta ke sambandh ko "saajha smriti" kaha jaataa he or yah ek taatkaalik rup main kaaryon, iraadon or pratikriyaswaroop kaaryon kii ek jatil shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan karata he
 It has been argued that children's vowel systems develop in such a way that they are parallel to adult languages even if they are using unrecognizable "words"
 The first words have the function of naming or labeling but also have a meaning such as "milk" which means "I want milk"
 Generally, at the age of 18 months, the vocabulary of about 20 words increases to around 200 words at the age of 21 months
 lagbhag 18 maheene kii umr se baccha do shabd vaale vaakyon main shabdon ko sanyukt karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 The adult usually expands this to clarify the meaning
 24-27 maheene kii umr tak baccha ekadam se sateek na hone par bhi taarkik vaakya rachana kaa istemaal karke teen yaa chaar shabdon vaale vaakyon kaa nirmaan karne lagata he
 The theory behind this is that children use a basic set of rules such as adding 's' to plural words or making simple words out of very difficult words such as using "choskit" for chocolate biscuits
 iske baad vyakaran ke niyamon or vaakyon ke sahi kram main teji se vikaas hone lagata he
 Rhyming often begins to take interest, and imaginative play often involves dialogue
 bacchon ke record kiye gaye monolog arthpurna ikaayiyon main jaankaree ko sangathit karne kii prakriya ke vikaas main antardrushti pradaan karte hai
 By the age of three, the child begins to use complex sentences, including relative clauses, although reform work still continues in various linguistic systems
 paanch saal kii umr tak baccha kaaphi had tak vayask kii tarah bhashaa kaa istemaal karne lag jaataa he
 From around the age of three, children can linguistically indicate illusion or imagination, creating personal stories and fictional stories consistent with the beginning and the end
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki bachche apane swayan ke anubhav ko samajhane ke ek tareeke ke rup main or dusron ko apana matlab samajhane ke ek madhyam ke rup main kahani kaa sahaara lete hai
 The ability to engage in extended debate arises from regular interactions with adults and peers over time
 iske liye bachche ko apane drushtikon ko dusron ke drushtikonon or bahari ghatnaon ke saath milaane ke tareeke ko seekhney kii jarurat he or vah aisa kar rahaa he, yah sabit karne ke liye use bhashaai sanketakon kaa istemaal karne kaa tarika bhi seekhney kii jarurat he
 They also learn to adjust their language depending on who they are talking to
 aam taur par lagbhag 9 saal kii umr tak apane khud ke anubhavon ke alaava anya kahaniyon kaa varnan lekhak, kahani ke paatro or apane khud ke ke drushtikonon se kar saktaa he
 Despite the important role that adult conversation plays in facilitating a child's learning, there is considerable disagreement among theorists about the extent to which children's initial meanings and semantic words relate directly to internal factors related to the child's cognitive functions
 Adults arise from conversation
 nae shabdon ke praarambhik maanchitran, prasang se pare shabdon ko samajhane kii kshamta or arth ko parishkrut karne ke bare main kai alag-alag nishkarsh praapt hue hai
 One hypothesis is known as the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis, which refers to a child's ability to infer meaning from gestures using grammatical information from sentence structure
 ek anya pariklpana bahut-margi model he jisamen yah tark diya jaataa he ki prasang se bandhe shabd or sandarbh sambandh shabd alag-alag margon kaa anusaran karte hai; pehle vaale ko ghatana pradarshnon ke aadhaar par chitrit kiya jaataa he or baad vaale ko maansik pradarshnon ke aadhaar par chitrit kiya jaataa he
 Despite paternal input having an extremely important role in this model, children rely on cognitive processes to determine subsequent use of words
 baharhaal, bhashaa vikaas par kiye gaye prakritik shodh se yah sanket mila he ki prischuli bacchon ke shabd sangrah vayaskon dwaara unhen bataae gaye shabdon kii sankhya se kaaphi had tak jude hai
 
 abhi tak bhashaa adhigrahan kaa koi siddhant aisa nahin he jo sabake dwaara sweekrut ho
 Current explanations differ in terms of emphasis, where emphasis is placed on reinforcement and simulation in teaching theory, while biological and indigenous theories emphasize spontaneous underlying mechanisms and a more interactive approach within a social context
 vyavahaarwadiyon kaa tark he ki bhautik maahaul or aam taur par saamaajik maahaul kii saarvbhaumik maujuudagi ke aadhaar par bhashaa sambandhi kisi bhi siddhant main bhashaa vyavhaar ke vyaktigat vikaas par inke sangyanatmak sambandhon ke prabhaavon par jarur dhyaan dena chahie
 Pinker argues that complex language is universal and has an innate basis
 pinkar kaa tark kuch had tak pigin se creole bhashaaon ke vikaas par aadhaarit he
 In pidgin, children of talking parents without grammatical structures develop creole language automatically, which is filled with standardized word order and present, future and past markers and subordinate clauses
 nikaragua main vishesh skulon main kam umr ke badhir bacchon kii sanket bhashaa ke vikaas se isko kuch samarthan mila he, jinamein anayas hi pigin kaa vikaas ho gaya or jise baad main skulon main aane vaale bacchon kii yuva peedi dwaara ek creole ke rup main viksit kar diya gaya
 
 dhimaa abhivyanjak bhashaa vikaas jo ki saamaanya samaj ke saath shabdon ke istemaal main hone vaali ek deree he, bacchon ke ek chote anupaat kii visheshta he jo baad main saamaanya bhashaa upyog kaa pradarshan karte hai
 Dyslexia is an important topic of child development because it affects about 5% of the population
 multah yah ek vikaar he jisaki vajah se bachche apni bauddhik kshamtaaon ke anuroop padhane, likhane or vartanee yaa uccharan karne kaa bhashaa kaushal praapt karne main vifal ho jate hai
 The language development of children with dyslexia has shown considerable differences, ranging from subtle speech impairment to incorrect pronunciation and difficulty in finding words
 sabase aam dhwani kathinaaiyaan, maukhik alpakaalik smriti or dhwani jaagrukta kii simittaayen hai
 Such children often face difficulties with long-term oral learning such as learning the month, multiplication of the year; The sound depletion hypothesis of the late 1980s is mainly used to explain this
 praarambhik jodbandi, buniyadi dhwani kaushal or buniyadi building blokon kii prapti main kathinaaiyon kaa matlab he ki dislexia grast bacchon ko nai jaankaree yaa kaushal hasil karne ke bajaay keval buniyadi chizon kaa saamana karne main bahut zyada sansadhano kaa nivesh karnaa padataa he

 These waves of Yamuna are swinging on the couplets of Raskhan and Rahim


 are on the footsteps of Surdas and Meera
 yamuna ne hi janm diya braj-samskruti ko


braj kii samskruti ke saath hi 'braj' shabd kaa chalan bhakthi aandolan ke dauraan puure charam par pahunch gaya
 The widespread wave of Krishna devotion of the fourteenth-fifteenth century fully propagated the purity of the word Braj among the masses
 sur, mira or raskhan ke bhajan to jaise aaj bhi braj ke vaataavaran main goonjte rahete hai
 What is it in Krishna Bhakti that freed Meera from royal life and knowing the depth of Surdas's creations, research was going on around the world about whether Surdas was indeed blind or not
 kehete hai ki aasthaa ke prashnon ke uttar itihaas main nahin khoje jate lekin aasthaa janm detii he samskruti ko or ganga or yamuna ne bhi hamen sabhyataa or samskruti di hai
 Yamuna is the gift of the Mahabharata period civilization and the 'oldest democracy' of Braj, for which Buddha told his beloved disciple 'anand' during his stay in Mathura that 'this is the primal state, which had chosen a constitution for itself
 yamuna kii dein yah samskruti ab ‘braj samskruti’ kehalaati he
 Thus, although the culture of Braj has been a regional culture, if we discuss its development on the basis of history, then we will know that this culture has been a struggle, co-ordinator and guide the country due to its unique traditions, being regional
 Has also been universal and dynamic and unbeatable, as well as sublime

 If the fight does not stop before a pre-determined number of cycles by mutual agreement, the winner is chosen by the referee's decision or the judges' points tables

 The first detailed description of a boxing contest is found in Homer's Iliad
 According to the Iliad, the Mycenaean warriors also included boxing in contests, in which the vanquished were respected by a large event, although it is possible that Homer's epics reflected the later culture
 According to another legend, the heroic ruler Thesius, whose period in the 9th century BC
 It is believed that he invented a form of boxing, in which two men would sit face to face with their fists until they died
 Over time, boxers began to fight by standing and wearing gloves and wrapping the casing under the elbows on their hands, although in addition they remained completely naked

 In 393 AD, the Olympic was banned by the Christian ruler Theodosius, and in 400 AD, Theodosius the Great banned boxing altogether, saying it was an insult to God because it spoiled the face, which is a reflection of God
 it happens

 yahi vah samay he, jab "mukkebaazi " shabd kaa pehali baar prayog shuru hua
 It should be noted that this early form of modern boxing was very different
 shri fig ke kaal kii pratiyogitaaon, mushti-yuddh ke saath hi, main talwarbazi va laathiyon se ladaai bhi shaamil hua karti thi
 There were no written rules of early bouts

 Under these rules, if a person fell down and was not able to continue the game even after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over
 kisi gire hue yoddha ko maarna athwa qamar ke neeche prahaar karnaa pratibandhit tha
 Broughton also invented and promoted "mufflers", a type of padded gloves that were used for training and demonstrations
 mukkebaazi par pehle shodh-patr kaa prakaashan atharahavin sadi ke ant main birmingham ke safal mukkebaaz 'wiliam futrail' dwaara kiya gaya tha, jo 9 july 1788 ko smitham bottm, kroydon main ek bahut kam aayu vaale "sajjan" jon jackson ke saath ek ghante or satraa minuton tak chale mukaable, jise dekhne ke liye prince of wales bhi upasthit the, se purv tak aparajit rahe the
 These rules also provided boxers with an advantage not currently available to boxers: they allowed the warrior to sit on one knee at any time to begin a 30-second count

 Sometimes, people standing in the corner will throw a white towel, which indicates a boxer's surrender

 The PNR principle was first introduced by airlines that needed to exchange reservation information in situations when passengers needed multiple airlines to reach their destination
 To this end, IATA defined a standard for PNR content and layout
 jab ek yatri ek pathpradarshak pustak book karata he, tab yatrakarta yaa yatra website upyogkarta us computer reserveshan system main ek pienaar banaata he jise vah istemaal karata he
 This is usually a large global delivery system, such as Amadeus, Saber, worldspan or Galileo, but PNR can also be in the airline's CRS database if the booking is made directly with an airline
 is pienaar ko yatri or sambhddha pathpradarshak pustak ke liye master pienaar kaha jaataa he
 The PNR is identified by a record locator in a particular database
 jab master pienaar ke dharak dwaara yatra ke bhaag pradaan nahin kiye jate, tab pienaar jaankaree kii pratiyaan un airlinon ke siares ke paas pahunchaai jaati hai jo parivahan pradaan karte hai
 These CRS guides open copies of the original PNR in their own database to handle the parts of the book for which they are responsible
 kai airline apane siares ek jidies dwaara yojit karwaati hai, jo pienaar kii saajhedaari kii anumati detaa he
 The record locator of the copied PNR is reported back to the CRS who owns the master PNR, so that all records are tied together
 This allows the PNR to exchange updates when the travel conditions change in any CRS
 haalanki pienaar mul rup se hawaii yatra ke liye shuru kiye gaye the, par ab ye hotel, car kiraye par dene, railway aadi kii booking karwaane ke liye bhi istemaal kiye jate hai

 They are: ek baar booking is str tak puri ho jaati he to siares ek adwitiya alpha-newmeric record loketor kaa prachaalan karata he, jo aage kiye gaye kisi bhi parivartan kii parvaah kiye bina samaan rahegaa vibhajit ho)

 While the above list is the minimum requirement, both the passenger and the airline need more information to ensure efficient travel
 inamen shaamil hai: In recent times, many governments have now required that the airline provide more information to help investigators track criminals or terrorists
 These include: adhiktar airline yaa yatra agenciyaan ek computer riserveshan system ) yaa global vitaran system ) company jaise sabre, galileo, worldspan or amadeus se apane pienaar kii mezbaani karwaane kaa chayan karti hai
 Some privacy organizations are concerned about the amount of pnr's personal data

 Pagidirai has a village in Kurnulu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 bhashaa vikaas aisi prakriya he jo maanav jivan main bahut pehle armbh ho jaati he
 a newborn is born without any language, but has been able to separate spoken words from other sounds in just 10 months
 aam taur par, utpaadak bhashaa ko praarambhik sanchaar ke ek charan ke saath shuru karne ke liye mana jaataa he jisamen shishu dusron ke liye apane iraadon ko gyaat karne ke liye ishaaron or bolne kaa upyog karte hai vikaas ke ek saamaanya siddhant ke anusaar, nae rup tab puraane kaaryon par le jate hai, taaki bacchon ko usee baatcheetatmak kaary ko vyakt karne ke liye shabd sikh saken, jo ki ve pehle se hi kaamuk sadhano dwaara vyakt kiye hai
 Theoretical framework editing mukhya lekh: bhashaa adhigrahan Language development is thought to proceed through simple processes of learning in which children use and speak words, meanings and words from linguistic input
 jis paddati main ham bhashaa kaushal viksit karte hai vah saarvbhaumik he; haalanki, mukhya bahes yah he ki kaise sintax ke niyamon kaa adhigrahan kiya jaataa he
 There are two major approaches to the development of syntax, an empirical account by which children derive all syntax rules from linguistic input and a moralistic approach by which some theory syntax is innate and transmitted through the human genome
 nom chomski dwaara prastaavit nativivaadee siddhant, tark detii he ki bhashaa ek adwitiya maanviya uplabdhi he
 Chomsky states that all children are called a spontaneous language acquisition device
 saidhantik rup se, aledy mastishk kaa ek kshetra he jisamen sabhi bhashaaon ke liye saarvbhaumik vaakyavinyas niyam hai
 This tool provides children with the ability to form novel sentences using learned vocabulary
 chomski kaa daawa yah vichaar he ki jo bachche sunate hai-unka bhashaai input-yah samajhane ke liye paryaapt nahin he ki ve bhashaa kaise sikhte hai
 He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors
 isliye, nitvivaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki bacchon ke liye apane vaataavaran se bhashaai jaankaree siikhnaa asambhav he
 However, because children have this lead, they are, in fact, able to learn the language despite incomplete information from their environment
 is drushtikon ne pachaas varshon se bhashaai siddhant par haaavee he or atyadhik prabhaavshaalee rahata he, jaisaa ki patrikaon or pustakon main lekhon kii sankhya ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Empirical theory suggests, against Chomsky, that children receiving linguistic input have sufficient information and, therefore, there is no need to assume an intuitive language acquisition device
 lead kii tulana main bhashaa ke liye vishesh rup se viksit kiya gaya tha, anubhavvaadi maanate hai ki bhashaa adhigrahan ke liye saamaanya mastishk prakriya paryaapt maatra main he
 During this process, it is necessary for the child to actively engage with his environment
 ek bachche ko bhashaa seekhney ke liye, mata-pita yaa dekhbhaal karne vaale bachche ke saath uchit rup se sanchaar karne ke ek vishesh tareeke ko god lete hai; ise bal-nirdeshit bhaashan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 CDS is used to give children the linguistic information needed for their language
 anubhavvaad ek saamaanya drushtikon he or kabhi-kabhi interactionavaadee drushtikon ke saath bhi jaataa he
 Statistical language acquisition, which falls under empirical theory, suggests that infants acquire language through pattern perception
 anya shodhakarta ek interactistic pariprekshya ko sweekaar karte hai, jisamen bhashaa ke vikaas ke saamaajik-interactive siddhant shaamil hote hai
 In such an approach, children learn language in an interactive and interactive context, learning forms of language for meaningful moves of communication
 ye siddhant mukhya rup se utpaadak bhashaa kii aadaton ko badhaava dene ke liye apane bacchon ko dekhbhaal karne waalon ke drushtikon or dhyaan par dhyaan dete hai
 An older empiricist theory, the behavioral theory proposed by B
 F
 Skinner, suggested that language is learned through operant conditioning, namely the copulation of stimuli and the reinforcement of correct responses
 is pariprekshya ko kisi bhi samay vyapak rup se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he, lekin kuch khaaton dwaara, punarutthan kaa anubhav ho rahaa he nae adhyayanon se is siddhant kaa upyog ab otism spectrum vikaron kaa nidaan karne vaale vyaktiyon ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Additionally, relational frame theory is expanding from behaviorist theory, which is important for acceptance and commitment therapy
 kuch anubhavvaadi siddhant aajkal vyavahaaravaadi model kaa upyog karte hai
 Other relevant theories about language development include the Piaget theory of cognitive development, which considers language development as a continuum of general cognitive development, and from Vygotsky's sociological theories of language to the social interaction and development of an individual

 Generally, people are of the opinion that the production of fruits is not beneficial
 is dharna ke kai kaaran hai : For all these reasons, the crop of trees is not good and there is no benefit from the garden
 yadi uchit dhang se baag lagaaya jaae or baad main bhi thik dekhbhaal ho, to laabh na hone kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 The following points should be kept in mind while choosing a location for a fruit orchard: 1
 sadaa aise sthaan ko baag lagane ke liye chunanaa chahie, jahaan kii bhoomi upjau ho
 Pebble and high ground are not suitable for fruit trees
 ksharwali, jisamen nona hon or retvali bhoomi bhi fal ke pedo ke liye kharaab hoti he
 Light soil, with good drainage, is ideal for all types of fruit trees
 2
 pedo kii sinchai kaa bhi suprabandh hona atyant aavashyak he
 It is not advisable to plant a big garden on the basis of canal water only
 aavashyaktaa padane par yadi kisi kaaran se nahar kaa pani na mili to fasal ko, yaa anya pedo ko, bahut haani pahunchati he
 It is very important to have at least one well of freshwater in the garden
 khaaraa pani fal ke pedo ko praaia: haani pahunchaata he
 If a 15-acre orchard is to be planted and irrigation is only six acres, the orchard should be planted in five or five acres in three or four times, because when the trees become old, they do not require much irrigation
 3
 baag sadaa pakki sadak athwa railway stesan ke paas lagaana chahie, taaki baag kii upaj suvidhapurvak or samay se bazaar yaa mandi main bikne ke liye pahunch sake
 Planting a garden inside the village far away from the city causes a lot of difficulty in transporting the crops to the market and also costs a lot
 adhik samay lagane ke kaaran fal bazaar tak pahunchate pahunchate kharaab hone lagate hai
 4
 As far as possible, the garden should not be planted near any forest
 jangal ke paas hone se praaia: nil gaay, suar, hiran or chidiyon aadi se pedo or phasal ko bahut haani hoti he or unase raksha karne main badi pareshaani hoti he tathaa adhik kharchaa hota he
 5
 One more thing to keep in mind before planting the garden is that the location should be such that the laborers can get the necessary clearance from the vicinity
 kabhi kabhi jarurat padane par majdoor na milane se baag kii fasal maari jaati he
 Once the land is selected for the garden, it remains to choose the varieties of trees to be planted in it
 iske liye nimnlikhit baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie : Varieties of trees should always be selected according to the land
 kam upjau bhoomi main kalami aam nahin lagaana chahie
 In such a place, only hard varieties like guava should be planted
 isi prakaar thodi reh vaali or kharaab jameen main lisoda, ber, aanwala aadi ke ped hi lagaae ja sakate hai
 Turmeric fruit trees, such as oranges, malta, lemons, etc
, should not be planted in the water-logged area, because the roots of turmeric fruit trees melt in the water
 aisi jagah amaruud kisi had tak lag saktaa he
 Mango should not be planted in pebble land
 bhoomi ko dekhakar, in sab baton kaa dhyaan rakhe bina yadi fal ke pedo kii kismon kaa chunaav kiya gaya, to galat kism ke ped lagane se sadaa haani hone kii sambhaavna he
 Varieties should be selected according to the climate of that place 
 thande pradeshon ke ped, jaise seb, khubaani, naashpati aadi, yadi garam maidani bhaag main lagaae jaayen, to unamem fal aane kii aashaa nahin rakhni chahie
 Similarly, fruits with gummer climate, such as bananas, papayas, etc
, cannot be grown in the cold winter regions
 adhik varshavale sthaan main angoor nahin lagata
 Similarly, different types of fruit trees want different types of climate and the variety of fruit trees should always be chosen according to the climate there
 ek baat kaa or dhyaan rakhana chahie kii fal ke pedo kii ve hi kisen lagaana laabhprad rahata he jinke falon kii maang bazaar main kaaphi ho or jin kismon ke falon ke daam bazaar main achche milane kii ummid ho
 It is not beneficial to plant cheap junk fruit trees
 kismon ke chunaav ke liye udyaan vibhaag ke karmchaariyon se raay lekar baag lagaana thik rahegaa
 If there is already cultivation in the land where the garden is to be planted, then there is not much difficulty in correcting it
 neeche kii bhoomi kisi he, yah jaanane ke liye puri bhoomi main kai jagah paanch yaa chah foot gahare gadde khod lenaa chahie
 First of all, we should clean the forest of the land
 babul aadi ke junglee pedo or jhaadiyon ko kaatna chahie
 By simply cutting the stem from above, the shrubs grow again, so every tree and shrub should be dug out and removed with roots
 ek do chhayaadaar maukey kaa ped aise sthaan par, jahaan mali ke rahane kii jhopadi aadi daalani he, chhod bhi sakate hai
 They can be cut later if not needed
 jangal kii safai ke baad bhoomi kii sataha ek karnaa aavashyak he
 If the surface is not well, then there is inconvenience in irrigation
 sab pedo main ek samaan pani nahin pahunchataa
 The rainwater also fills the bottom and damages the trees
 sinchai kii naaliyon kii suvidha dekhakar bhoomi kii sataha thik kar leni chahie
 If it is not possible to make the whole land a bit flat, then it should be divided into two or more parts and each part should be leveled separately
 parvatiy kshetron main, jahaan bade chauras maidan nahin hote, isi prakaar seedhidaar khet banaae jate hai
 After this, if possible, a deep plowing should be done
 isse jameen bhurabhuri ho jaati he or varsha kaa pani bhi jameen main bhalee prakaar pahunchataa he
 Most of the rainwater flows into the flat ground
 yadi sambhav ho to puure khat main hari khadvaali fasal, jaise sanai aadi, bokar jot dene se bhoomi ko acchhee khaad mil jaati he
 After this, should be planted in the places of planting trees all over the land
 bhoomi par chhri lagane se pehle, yadi kaagaj par uskaa nakshaa bana liya jaae, to chhri lagaana aasaan rahata he or koi galati nahin hoti he
 There are many methods of drawing, such as square, hexagonal, rectangular etc
 vargakar vidhi sugam or sabase adhik prachlit he
 In this method, the distance from tree to tree and line to line is same and on joining the four nearby trees in a straight line, a square is formed
 chihn lagaana prarambh karne se pehle ek sidhi aadharbhuja daal lenaa aavashyak hota he
 This base can be inserted parallel to the surrounding paved road, or the building or adjacent garden, or according to the size of the land
 phir rekhankan usee aadhaar par aasaani se kiya ja saktaa
 It is very important to plant trees at the proper distance
 praaia: bhoomi main adhik se adhik ped lagane ke laalach main log ped paas paas laga dete
 Planting trees nearby does not give them a place to spread
 badhane par ve aapas main mil jate hai
 Sun and wind do not reach the dense garden and trees do not have a good crop
 keval chotiwale bhaag main, jahaan thodi dhoop tathaa hawa pahunchati he, thode fal lagate hai, jinaki rakhwali karnaa or todna donon kathin hota he
 For this reason, trees should always be planted at the proper distance
 mukhya falon ke pedo ke faasale nimnlikhit hai : Native mango - 40 feet kalami aam - 35 foot Guava - 25 feet nibu - 20 foot Lychee - 30 feet lukath - 25 foot Papaya - 8 feet pedo ko lagane ke nishaan bhoomi main laga lene ke baad vahaan teen foot chaude tathaa teen foot gahare gol gadde khod lene chahie
 The work of digging the pits should be done by June, so that the soil of the pits takes at least 15 days and wind before the rains begin
 gaddhon kii mitti main se kankad pathar aadi nikaalkar usamen lagbhag shbhaag sade gobar kii khaad mila dena chahie
 After filling water in the pit, the soil settles, so while filling the pit, the soil surface should be kept about two inches high from the ground
 jab ek do baar acchhee varsha ho jaae, tab gaddhon ke bichobich ped laga dena chahie
 While planting the tree, it should be kept in mind that the tree should be planted in the pit to the same depth as it was earlier in the bed or pot
 adhik gaharaa laga dene se ped kaa tana mitti main dab jaataa he or uske sadane kaa andeshaa rahata he
 Similarly, planting a shallow tree opens its roots and damages the tree
 yadi varsha na ho rahi ho to ped lagane ke baad tunrat usamen pani dena chahie
 The tree should always be taken from some reliable place, even if it has to be paid a little more
 yadi prarambh main galat kismon ke ped lag jate hai, to bahut nuksaan hone kii sambhaavna he
 When it comes to fruition, it seems that the trees of bad and wrong varieties have been planted, at that time there is no other way to remove those trees and plant new trees
 is prakaar kaaphi samay or rupaya bekaar jaataa he
 Therefore, a lot of research and the right kind of trees should be planted
 baag kii dekhbhaal main nimnlikhit baton par dhyaan dena chahie : Hot winds always blow from the west and frosty winds from the north
 in tej, garam or thandhi hawaaon ko rokane ke liye baag kii uttar or pashchim disha main unche badhane vaale pedo kii ghani pankti laga deni chahie
 This line is called wind brake
 wind brake ke liye shisham, deshi aam, jamun aadi lagaate hai
 The spacing of trees is about 10-15 feet, making them dense and grow straight and tall
 lu evam paale se chote pedo ko bachaane ke liye greeshm or sheetkaal main prayek ped ke chaaron ore phoos kii choti tatti purv disha main khuli rahati he, jisase ped ko dhoop or hawa milti rahe
 Pots are only tied in those varieties of trees that are expected to die of heat and frost, such as mango, papaya, leek etc
 garmi or jaadon main gahari sinchai karne se bhi lu or paale se bachaav hota he
 Flooding around the garden is necessary to prevent wild animals, quadrupeds etc
 from entering the garden
 iskaa ek tarika yah he ki chaaron ore lagbhag teen foot gahari ek khain khodi jaae or uski mitti baag ke andar kii ore khain ke kinare ek chaudee or unchi med ke rup main jamaa di jaae
 This moat and high ridges make a good stop
 yadi is med ke upar thuhar athwa naagfani aadi laga di jaae to or bhi adhik raksha rahegi
 Thorn thick shrubs, such as gooseberry, sour, acacia etc
 can also be planted around the garden
 aajkal kantedaar taar lagane kaa prachlan he
 The garden is protected even if four feet of barbed wire are encased in pillars six feet high
 falon ko haani pahunchaanevaale praani, jaise pakshi evam bandar aadi, se raksha ke liye aadmi rakhana padataa he, jo pataakhe, gulel aadi chalaakar fasal kii raksha karata he
 In winter, some leaf-cutting trees, such as phalsa, figs, mulberry, etc
, have to be pruned yearly
 inaki chhantai karne se nai shakhaayen khub footkar nikalati hai or inamen achche or kaaphi fal lagate hai
 By not harvesting annually, they grow only a few branches, which bear only a few fruits
 inaki kataai chhantai us samay karte hai, jab jaadon main ye pattee gira dete hai
 For the first two to three years after planting trees, all the trees need to be cut, pruned to make them beautiful and strong
 bhoomi se lagbhag do teen foot kii oonchaai tak tane ko saaf kar lenaa chahie
 In the upper part of the stem, three or four strong branches should be picked in different directions and only they should be allowed to grow
 anya shakhaon ko tane ke paas se kaat dena chahie
 As the trees grow, their plates should be increased
 prati varsh thaalon kii godai karke unamem khaad deni chahie
 It is good to do this work in the months of October and November
 baag kii safai kaa sadaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 The weed should be cleaned by chaff
 uchit sinchai kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie, visheshkar greeshm kaal or fal lagane ke baad
 To prevent any diseases or insects, appropriate medicine should be sprayed

 Its mythological name is Shatadru
 jisaki lambaai punjab main bahane vaali paanchon nadiyon main sabase adhik he
 It flows from Pakistan

 The river enters Nangal in Punjab, making its way through the mountains of Himachal Pradesh
 nangal se kuch kilometre upar himachal pradesh ke bhakhda main sutluj par baandh banaaya gaya he
 a huge reservoir has been constructed behind the dam, which is called Govind Sagar Reservoir
 bhakhda nangal pariyojna se panbizli kaa utpaadan hota he, jisaki aapurti punjab or aasapaas ke rajyon ko kii jaati he
 After entering Punjab, the river flows between the Shivalik hills in Ropar district in the southeast
 ropar main hi yah pahaad se maidan main utarati he, yahan se yah pashchim kii ore teji se mudakar punjab ke madhya main bahati he, jahaan yah best doaab or malwa ko vibhajit karti he
 At Harike, the Beas River joins the Sutlej, from where it turns southwest and sets the boundary line between India and Pakistan
 iske baad yah bharat ko chhodkar kuch duuri ke liye pakistan main fazilka ke pashchim main bahati he
 Towards the west near Bahawalpur, it meets the Chenab river

 In the Vishnu Purana, Shatadru is said to have been omitted from the Mount of Himwan - 'shatadruchandra Bhagadadya Himvatpadnirgataha'
 vastav main sutluj kaa strot ravananad naamak jhil he jo maansarovar ke pashchim main he
 The present-day Sutlej meets 'bias'

 This year, the routes of both Bias and Sutlej changed and they came close together
 ' shatadru vaidic shutudri kaa roopaantar he tathaa iskaa arth shat dhaaraon vaali nadi kiya ja saktaa he
 Which indicates the existence of many of its tributaries
 greek lekhakon ne satluj ko hejidras kaha he
 But the mention of this river is very less in his texts
 kyonki alakshendra kii senaayen beas nadi se hi waapas chali gai thi or unhen beas ke purv main sthit desh kii jaankaree bahut thodi ho saki thi
 Sutlej has also contributed to the prosperity of Punjab
