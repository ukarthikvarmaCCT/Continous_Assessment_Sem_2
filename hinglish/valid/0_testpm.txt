 The famous havelis of Jaisalmer, built in the 18th-19th century, is a unique example of architecture
 in haweliyon main bane bhitti chitra kaaphi sundar hai
 Salim Singh Mehta's Haveli, Patwas Ki Haveli, Nathmal Ki Haveli and the fort's Prasad and Badal Mahal etc
 have made the art of Jaisalmer famous all over the world today
 jaisalmer main chitrakala ke nirmaan, sachitr granthon kii nakal evam pracheen hastlikhit granthon ke sangrakshan ke liye jitna yogadan rahaa he, utana kisi anya sthaan kaa nahi
 While the invaders were destroying Indian architecture and manuscripts, the Trikutakar fortress of Jaisalmer in the remote desert of Paschimanchal, India, was considered an important place for their defense
 isliye sambhaat, paaran, gujarat, aldhyapur evam rajasthan ke anya bhaagon se pracheen sahitya, kala kii saamagree ko kile ke jain mandiron ke taldharon main surakshit rakhaa gaya
 Jaisalmer has about seven Gyan Bhandars, of which 'jin Bhadrasuri Gyan Bhandar' is the largest and aged material, hence it is called Bad Bhandar
 is bhandar main lagbhag 400 se adhik tadfiy granth, lagbhag 2300 hastlikhit kaagaj ke granth, anek chitra patticas uplabdh hai
 There are many illustrated texts in the above mentioned texts, through which many links to the development of Indian painting can be added

 Some of the ancient paintings stored in the Jnana Bhandar here have great importance

 jain bhandar main sangrahit granth jaisalmer kii chitrakatha ke vikaas par koi vishesh prabhaav nahin daalate
 But just because they are there, Jaisalmer city has great importance in the country and abroad
 vaise jaisalmer main chitrakala kii sudrudh parampara kaa abhaav he
 The obvious reason for this is that there has been a high prevalence of artistic cutting of stone, lime and wood

 This type of religious literature is also called 'evidence of Religion' in Great Britain, but in most Christian countries, the term Apologetics is commonly used
 vaise to kisi bhi dharm ke apaurushey ang kii himaayat 'apollogytics' ke kshetra main aati he, lekin dharmik sahitya parampara main catholic siddhanton ke samarthan main hi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 In the modern era, this tradition was not strong in any country other than Germany
 is tarah ke sahitya kaa ab nirmaan nahin hota or na uski aavashyaktaa hi rah gai he
 The aim of Apologetics was to refute the objections made by Roman citizens, officials and writers against Christ

 This type of letter was called 'apology'
 sabase pehali 'apollogy' kwadretas ne samrat hadriyan ke naam likhi, uske baad paristedies or jastin ne samrat antoninas ke naam aise hi patr likhe
 Among these, Jastin's apology is the most famous

 During the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, 'apologetics' flourished in the works of Melito and Apollinaris

 His mother's name was Bhagirathibai and father's name was Moropant Tambe

 In 1851, Rani Laxmibai gave birth to a son
 parantu chaar maheene kii umr main hi uski mrityu ho gayi
 In 1853, when King Gangadhar Rao's health deteriorated drastically, he was advised to adopt an adopted son
 putr god lene ke baad 21 navambar 1853 ko raja gangadhar raav kii mrityu ho gayi
 The adopted son was named Damodar Rao
 britani raaj ne apni rajya hadap niti ke tahat balak damodar raav ke kilaaf adaalat main muqadama daayar kar diya
 Although there was a lot of debate in the case, it was dismissed
 britani adhikariyon ne rajya kaa khazaana zabt kar liya or unke pati ke karz ko rani ke salanaa karch main se kaatane kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 As a result, the queen had to leave the fort of Jhansi and go to the Ranimahal of Jhansi
 par rani lakshmibai ne himmat nahin haari or unhonen har haal main jhansi rajya kii raksha karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Jhansi became a major center of the 1857 war where violence erupted

 The following compositions of sarah are mentioned in the ancient Tibetan Buddhist text called Tanjur: aapstambiya kalp ke 30 prashnon main se 28wein tathaa 29wein prashnon ko aapstamb dharmasutra naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 Both these questions are divided into 11–11 tables, in which 32 and 29 Kandikas are received respectively
 yahi ek kalpasutra he jisaki shrout, grihy, dharm or shulbasutra yukt purna kalp–parampara uplabdh he; par un sabhi kaa kartta ek hi he yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he
 According to the opinion of Mahamahopadhyay Pandurang Vaman Kane, the principal of both the householder and Dharmasutra are the same
 smritichandrika in donon ko hi ek granthkaar kii kriti maanati he
 Buehler and Führer also have no doubt in this matter
 kintu oldenberg ke anusaar aapstamb shrautasutra tathaa aapstamb dharmasutra ke rachiyata bhinn–bhinn vyakti hai
 Many parts of the Boudhayan Dharmasutra have a resemblance to the Aastambha Dharmasutra, but it is difficult to say who has taken the material
 mahamahopadyay kane aapstamb dharmasutra ko boudhayan se parvarti maanate hai
 Banerjee has long criticized the subject
 isse gyaat hota he ki unhone donon granthon kii mantra–sampatti kii tulanaatmak samiksha kii he
 The connection of the Apastamba Dharmasutra appears to be from South India, as the Apastamba branch was prevalent in the south of the Narmada, according to the verses quoted from the composition called 'maharnava'
 swayan aapstamb ne dharmasutragat shraadh ke prakaran main brahmanon ke haath main jal giraane kii pratha 'uttar ke logon main' prachlit he, aisa kahkar dakshin bhartiya hone kaa parichay diya he
 The remarkable fact in this matter is that the mantras of the Taittiriya Aranyaka, who are instructed in the Apastamb Dharmasutra, are derived from the Andhra text itself
 isi aadhaar par buhler aapstamb ko andhra–pradeshy maanate hai
 Hardatta has divided the two questions related to the Apastamba Dharmasutra into 11–11 tables and attempted Ujjavavlavathi Namni Tika
 hardutt ke atirikt ek or bhashyakaar kaa ullekh kane ne kiya he, vah he dhoortswami
 Shankar has also written a commentary on two of the spiritual themes of the Apastamb Dharmasutra
 bombay sanskrit siries main buhler dwaara hardutt kii ujjwala tikaa ke anshon sahit tathaa kumbhakonam sanskaran main sampoorn hardateey tikaa tathaa buhlarakrut bhoomika sahit angl anuwaad 'secred book of di east' main prakashit hua he
 Apastamb Dharmasutra is unique from all Dharmasutras in terms of language and style
 bhashaa kii drushti se buhler ne is sutara kii bhashaa se sambandhit asangatiyon ko chaar virgon main rakhaa he
 Some obsolete words are found in the Apastamb Dharmasutra such as: in aprachlit or apanineey prayogon ke kaaran is sutara ke vishay main do dharanayen vidwaanon ke madhya main drushtigochar hoti hai– From the point of view of style, it can be said that most of the sutras in this sutra are in prose, but the use of verses is also often available in it
 isamen prapya sutara shithil tathaa aspasht hai tathaa inaki style brahmanon kii style ke samipatar prathit hoti he
 Regarding the time of the Apastamb Dharmasutra, Buehler's statement that it is appropriate to consider its time 150–200 years before Christ or even earlier, but Mahamahopadhyay Kane dated 700–300 BC
 The time between is considered
 aapstamb dharmasutra ke varnya vishyon kaa sankshepatah varnan is prakaar he– Sources of religion, Chaturvanya, Upanayan according to the time-wise description, Atonement for not doing Upanayana at the appropriate time, Sacrament of Brahmachari, Brahmacharya of 48, 36, 25 and 12 years, Punishment, Ajin and Mekhala etc

 '* angaanaan tu pradhanairavyapadesh iti nyaivitsamayah
 Athape Nityanuvadamvidhimahurnayavidah, * Arthavado wa Vidhistha Tasmannityanuvadah
 * isse yah spasht hi he ki aapstamb ke samay main mimasaa shaastra purna viksit tha
 In the Apastamb Dharmasutra, under the interpretation of religion, the first thought subject is varna
 tuchh se tuchh krityon main varna ke aadhaar par bhinnata sarvatra spasht rup se drushtigochar hoti he
 The time, stage, velvet, clothes, punishment and method of begging for Yajnopavit is considered essential for everyone

 There is no law of upanayana for a Shudra and a person involved in evil deeds

 According to the Apastamb Dharmasutra, there are mainly three types of acts of Brahmachari - acts that please the Guru, welfare acts and self-study of the Vedas
 * samidadhan tathaa bhikshacharan bhi brahchari ke liye atyaavashyak hai
 According to the Apastamb Dharmasutra, guest hospitality for the householder is a Prajapatya Yajna performed daily
