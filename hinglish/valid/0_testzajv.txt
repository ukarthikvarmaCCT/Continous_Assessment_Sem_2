 Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino, who co-wrote the script with Roger Avery
 The film is known for its superb and eclectic dialogue, for its full mix of humor and violence, for non-linear storytelling, and for cinematic gestures and pop culture
 film ko saat auskar ke liye namit kiya gaya, jisamen sarvshereshth pikchar shaamil he; tarantino or every ne sarvshereshth mul patakatha ke liye puraskaar jeeta
 It was also awarded the Palme d'or at the 1994 Connage Film Festival

 unhen semul el
 jaikson or uma thuraman kii tarah academy puraskaar ke liye namankit kiya gaya
 Pulp Fiction, directed in a more nuanced manner, is a mix of Los Angeles mobsters, paid players, short-term criminals and a mystery
 baatcheet or monolog ke liye paryaapt screen samay diya gaya he, jo paatr ke jivan ke prati drushtikon or hasya kii bhaavana ko prakat karata he
 The film's title refers to Pulp magazine and hardboiled crime-based novels that were popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and provocative dialogue
 pulp fiction apane praarambhik kshanon se hi swa-sandarbhit he, yah ek sheershak card se shuru hoti he jo "pulp" kii do shabdkosh paribhaashaayen detaa he
 The Plot, along with most of Tarantino's other works, is presented in chronological order
 is pikchar kaa swa-bhav vishleshan, aparamparaagat sanrachana or shradhanjali or milawat ke vyapak upyog kii vajah se aalochakon ne ise pasch aadhunik film ke ek pramukh udhaaharan ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Some critics have considered it a black comedy, often labeled a "neo-noir"
 sameekshak jeffri o'brain kaa tark he "puraane samay kii noir bhavanaaen, udaasi se yukt chintan or operatic mrityu ke drishy sab mil kar chatapatepan se baahar rahe, lekin isane vah ascharyajanak avasthaa paidaa kii jo tarantino ke dwaara kiye gaye ek jaadu ke samaan thi
 It is neither a neo-noir nor a parody of Noir "
 Similarly, Nicholas Christopher stated that it is" more of a Kempland than a neo-noir ", and that Foster Hirsch said that its" trippy fantasy scenario "would call it Also reflects more specifically than other traditional labels
 pulp fiction ko baad kii kai filmon ke liye prerana ke rup main dekha gaya, in filmon main isaki style ke kai tatwon ko apanaaya gaya
 Its development, the nature and distribution of marketing, and the resulting profits, had a major impact on the field of independent cinema
 ek saanskrithik lahar pulp fiction ke prabhaav ko kai anya lokapriy media main bhi mahasoos kiya gaya he
 Its story is rendered out of order, with the trademark of the non-linear story of writer and director Quentin Tarantino
 pulp fiction kii kahani teen alag alag lekin ek duusare se sambandhit kahaniyon ke aas paas gumti he-tarantino kii avadharana main, mob hitmen vinset vega pehali kahani kaa netritv kar rahe hai, peshewar mukkebaaz buch kulij duusari kahani kaa netritv kar rahe hai or vinset ke saathi anubandh hatyare, juls vinfield, teesri kahani kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 Although each story focuses on a different series of events, these stories are in many ways related to each other and related to each other
 film "pumpkin" or "hani bani" ke dwaara manchan kiye gaye dinar hold-ap ke saath shuru hoti he, iske baad vincent, juls, buch or kai anya paatro kii kahaniyaan shuru ho jaati hai, jisamen bheed sargana marcelas wales, uski patni, mia or anderworld kaa samasya kaa samaadhaan karne vaala winston volf shaamil hai
 The story eventually culminates in the dinner where it began: Vincent and Jules, who stop for a grass, find themselves entangled in a hold-up
 isamen kul saat kathatmak shrinkhlaayein hai-teen praathmik kathaayen ek blike screen par antar sheershakon kii pahchaan se pehle aati hai
 If the seven sequences are arranged chronologically, these will be: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5
 anukram 1 or 7 aanshik rup se adhyaropit hote hai or kai drushtikon se prastut kiye jate hai; yahi baat anukram 2 or 6 ke liye bhi sach he
 In Philip Parkar's description, the structural form "is a story involving an episode that has many relevant events, including the beginning and the end, that refer to the elements of each separate episode throughout the story
 anya vishleshak sanranchana ko saadhaaran rup se ek "paripatr katha" ke rup main varnit karte hai
 "pumpkin" and "honey Bunny" are having breakfast at a diner
 ve ye soch kar lut kaa faisla karte hai, ki ve na keval vyapaar se balki graahakon se bhi paisa bana sakate hai, jaisaa ki unki pichhali dakaiti ke dauraan hua tha
 Just after they start the hold-up, the scene breaks down and the title starts revolving
 jab juls vinnafield drive kar rahen hai, vincent vega europe main apane anubhav ke bare main baat kar rahe hai, jahaan se ve abhi abhi laute hai-amsterdam main hesh baar; french mcdonalds or iskaa "royal wyeth cheez"
 upyukt poshaak main ye joda brett se brifces lene ke liye ja rahaa he, jo apane bose gengster marcelas wales ke khilaaf he
 Jules tells Vincent that Marcellus was dropped by someone on the fourth floor balcony as he massaged his wife's feet
 vincent ne kaha ki marcelas ne use apni patni ko le jane ke liye kaha jab marcelas shahar se baahar gaya ho
 They conclude their joke and "get into the character", during which Jules recites a critical "biblical" proclamation after which Brett's drama begins
 ek lagbhag khaali cocktail lounj main, badi umr kaa peshewar mukkebaaz buch kulij marcelas se ek badi dhanrashi sweekaar karata he or saath hi is baat ke liye sahmati detaa he ki vah aagaamee match main ek dubkee lagaayegaa
 buch or vincent rasta paar karte hai, vincent or julls-ab tii shart or shorts pahane hue-brifces kii delivery karne ke liye pahunchate hai
 The next day, Vincent leaves Lance and Jodi's house to score some high-ranking heroin
 vah pehle goli chalaata he, phir shrimati mia wales se milane or use baahar nikaalane ke liye driving karke jaataa he
 They head to Jack Rabbit, a 1950s restaurant staffed by the lookalikes of the decade's pop icons
 Mia recounts her acting experience in "fox Force Five", a failed television pilot
 ek twist pratiyogita main bhaag lene ke baad, ve trophy ke saath wales ke ghar waapas aate hai
 When Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds the heroin hidden in her coat pocket
 cocaine samaj kar vah ise naak se soonghti he or isaki zarurat se zyada khuraaq le leti he
 Vincent rushes to Lance's house to help him
 ve mil kar mia ke hryday ko adrenalin kaa shot dete hai, ore use kisi tarah se bachaa lete hai
 Before separating, Mia and Vincent think that they will not tell Marcellus about the incident
 veteran captain koons ke aagaman se, yuva buch ke liye televijan samay baadhit ho jaataa he
 Koons makes it clear that he has brought a gold watch, he has gone through several generations of coolies since the first world war
 buch ke pitaaji kii mrityu pechish se ho gayi thi jab ve ek POW shivi main the or marate samay unhone koons ko anurodh kiya ki vah is ghadi ko do saal ke liye uske malashay main chupa de taaki ise buch ko diya ja sake
 When a bell rings, the adult Butch comes out of this feeling and is shocked
 vah apane mukkebaaji ke rang main he-yah ladane kaa samay he use fankne ke liye paise die gaye hai
 Butch runs away after winning the match
 jab bhaag nikaalane ke liye vah taxi letaa he, vah marate hue driver esmarilda villalobose se jaan letaa he ki usne virdohi ladaaku ko maar daalaa
 Butch is double crossed to Marcellus, as he bets his repayment in very favorable circumstances
 agali subah, motal main jahaan ve or unki premika, febine, lete hue hai, buch ko yah pataa chal jaataa he ki vah bahut hi mahatvapurn ghadi ko pack karnaa bhul gayi he
 He returns to his apartment to pick it up, though Marcellus' men are definitely looking for him
 buch ko jaldi hi ghadi mil jaati he, lekin use lagata he ki vah akelaa he, isliye vah kuch khaane ke liye ruk jaataa he
 That's when she sees a submachine gun or gun on the kitchen counter
 shauchalay se flush kii aawaaj sunakar, buch bandook lekar taiyaar ho jaataa he, taaki vah bathroom se baahar aate hue, vincent vega ko maar sake
 Butch drives away and escapes, but while he is waiting at the traffic light, Marcellus emerges from him and recognizes him
 buch car se marcelas ko dhakelta he, tabhi ek or automobile usase takaraata he
 Chasing each other, both of them reach a moneylender's shop
 dukaan kaa maalik, menard, bandook kii nok par unhen pakad letaa he or unhen ek aadhe tahkhaane ke kshetra main baandh detaa he
 Maynard also accompanies Jade; They take him to another room to rape Marcellus and leave a masked man named "gimp" to keep an eye on Butch who is tied up
 buch kisi tarah chhot jaataa he or gimp par hamalaa kar detaa he
 He decides to save Marcellus when he starts running away
 jed ek lathi ke ghode par marcelas kaa balaatkaar kar rahaa hota he, buch tabhi ek kataanaa se menard ko maar daalata he
 Marcellus captures Maynard's shotgun and shoots into Jade's waist
 marcelas buch ko bataata he ki is bekaar ladaai ke kaam main ve donon ek jaise hi hai, ve kabhi bhi balaatkaar ke bare main kisi ko nahin bataayenge or hameshaa ke liye los angeles chhod kar chale jaayenge
 Butch agrees and goes to pick up Fabine on Jade's helicopter
 kahani brett par vincent or juls kii ore laut jaati he
 When they kill him, the man suddenly exits the bathroom and fires at them badly, missing all his targets, followed by Jules and Vincent
 juls ko lagata he ki yah chamatkaar he or bhagwaan kii ore se is baat kaa sanket he ki vah ek hit main ke rup main ritair ho rahaa he
 They leave with Marvin, an associate of Brett, who is their informer
 vincent "chamatkaar" ke bare main marvin kii raay poochta he, ore galati se uske chehre par goli chalaa detaa he
 This forces them to take this blood-stained car off the road, Jules calls her friend Jimmy's house
 jimmy ki patni boni kaa kaam se ghar waapas aane kaa samay ho rahaa he, ore use bahut chintaa ho rahi he ki vah kahin ye sab dekh na le
 juls ke anurodh par, marcelas, winston woolf se madad kii vyavastha kar letaa he
 Wolf takes this position in his hands
 vah juls or vincent ko car saafe karne ke liye kahata he, saath hi kahata he ki shav ko trunk main chupa den or apane khun se sane kapadon ko nasht kar den or jimmy kii di hui tii sharts or shorts pahan len
 They take the car to a junkyard, from where Wolfe and the owner's daughter, Raquel, go to have breakfast, Jules and Vincent decide to do the same
 juls or vincent ek coffee kii dukaan main naashtaa kha rahen hai, unki charchaa laut kar juls ke ritair hone ke faisle par aa jaati he
 In a brief cutaway, we see them just before "pumpkin" and "honey Bunny" begin the hold-up from the first scene of the film
 jabaki vincent bathroom main hota he, hold-ap shuru ho jaataa he
 "pumpkin" demands all of the patron's valuables, including the mysterious case of Jules
 juls "pumpkin" ko bandook kii nok dikhaa kar aashcharyachakit kar detaa he
 "honey Bunny," furiously shoots a gun at Jules
 vincent apni bandook ko us par taane hue bathroom se baahar nikalataa he or ek mexican gatirodh paidaa kar detaa he
 Telling his pseudo-biblical passage, Jules expresses his mentality about his criminal life
 paap se uddhaar karne ke apane pehle kaary ke rup main, vah luteron ko wo nakadi le jane detaa he jo unhone churaayi thi, phir yah sochataa he ki ve kaise faile hue the or marcelas ke paas brif cese ko chhodte hue, apane bose ke liye hit main kaa aakhri kaam puraa karata he
 The screenplay of Pulp Fiction was written by Roger Avery in the late 1990s, its first element: iske liye shuruaati prerana thi ek teen bhaag kii daraavnee sankalan film blike sabath, jo italy ke film nirmaataa mario bawa ke dwaara banaayi gayi thi
 The tarantino-avery project was tentatively titled "black Mask", a title based on the primary hardboiled crime fiction magazine
 tarantino kii script unki pehali film rigervyr dogs kii tarah banaayi gayi; every ke sheershak "pendemonium rhins", ne pulp fiction kii "sone kii ghadi" kii katha ke liye aadhaar banaaya
 With work on Reservoir Dogs complete, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: "I got the idea to do something that a novelist gets to do but not the filmmaker: it gave three different stories Gaya, in which the characters keep coming in and out of the story based on the story
 " Tarantino explains that the original idea in it was the oldest nut you've ever seen, what happens when it comes to stories of crime — the oldest stories in the book 


 you know, 'vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace's wife— - The oldest story about a boy who goes out with the elder man's wife and does not even touch her
 aap jaanate hai, aapane aisi kahani kai baar dekhi hogi
" "I am using the old way of telling a story and willfully smack them

 "is chaal kaa hissaa he film ke in paatro ko or sthitiyon ko darshana or vastav main unhen vaastavik jivan ke kuch niyamon par lagu karnaa or dekhnaa ki ve kis tarah se saamne aate hai
 " tarantino pulp fiction kii patakatha par kaam karne ke liye march 1992 main amsterdam gaye
 There Averi was joined by him, who contributed to the project from "pandemonium Rhines" and participated in rewriting and developing its new story, a story similar to this
 vaastavik romance patakatha ke liye mul rup se every ke dwaara likhe gaye do seen, kaa shrey tarantino ko diya jaataa he, ye drishy "boni sthiti" kii shuruyaat main dikhaae gaye: chupe hue gan main ke dwaara lagaaye gaye nishane kaa "chamatkaarik" tareeke se chook janaa or peeche kii seat par automobile main hatya
 aparaadh kii duniya kii "safai karne vaale" kii prerana jo ek chote, sanhaar ke dwaara prakaran kaa mukhya bhaag ban gaya, ise tarantino ne ek film samaaroh main dekha
 She took on lead actress Angela Jones in Pulp Fiction and later supported the filmmaker's production of a feature length version of the genocide
 patakatha main do vyavsaayik brands shaamil kiye gaye, jinhen aksar baad kii tarantino kii filmon main prardashit kiya gaya: big kahoona bergers or red appal cigarets

 Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films, a production company run by Danny devito, Michael Shemberg and Stacy Sher
 yahan tak ki reserveoyar dogs dekhne se pehle hi, jersey tarantino kii agali pariyojna ko sin karnaa chaah rahe the
 a deal was eventually signed for $ 1 million — the deal provided initial financing and office facilities to the newly formed production company of Bender and Tarantino, in addition to a band; Jersey received a portion of the project and also got the rights to sell the script to a studio
 jersey ne colombia tri star ke saath "first luk" sauda kiya or vitaran kiya, jisane tarantino ko iske vikalpon ko abhyaas main lene ke vichaar kaa adhikaar diya
 farvari main, pulp fiction tri star par priproduction main filmon kii kai kismon kii suchi par dikhaayi di

 According to a studio official, tristar chief Mike Medavoy found it "very excited"
 suzav die gaye ki tristar ek aisi film ke samarthan kii pratirodhi thi jo ek heroin upyogkarta ko feechar kar rahi ho; aise sanket bhi mili ki studio ne apni star nirmit chhavi ke liye ise bahut hi kam bajet kii pariyojna ke rup main dekha
 every-jo apni nirdesan debyue kiling zo kii shooting shuru karne ja rahe the- ne kaha ki tristar aapattiyaan vyapak thim or inamen patakatha kii moolbhoot saranchanaaen shaamil thim
 He reflected the studio's position: "this is the worst thing ever written
 yah koi matlab nahin he
 Someone dies and then they live
 yah bahut lanbaa, hinsak he or filmon ke ayogy he
 '


 So i thought,' that's that! bender is patakatha ko miramax ke paas laayaa, jo pehle ek swatantra studio tha, haal hi main ise dizani ke dwaara adhigrahit kar liya gaya

 apane naam ke bal par, miramax ne film ke duniya bhar main adhikaron ke liye 11 lakh dollar arjeet kiye, isane vastav main apane laabh ko sunishchit kiya
 John Travolta as Vincent Vega: Tarantino took Travolta into Pulp Fiction only because Michael Medson, who had Vic Vega's lead role in Reservoir Dogs, chose Kevin Costner's Vayat Earp instead
 Medson is still giving importance to his choice after more than a decade

 Jonathan Rosenbaum analyzed TV for a comparison of Tarantino / Goddard, believing that the directors are similar in the sense that they want to cram everything like a screen: "but the choices of both Goddard and Tarantino are different, with regard to astronomy They are different; it is the same as comparing a joint museum, library, film collection, record store and a department store to a jukebox, a video-rental Utlet and an issue of TV Guide

 Over the next few years many enlightened people became followers of Muhammad
 unke anuyaayiyon ke prabhaav main aakar bhi kai log musalmaan bane
 After this Muhammad sahib returned to Mecca and conquered Makkah without fighting and all the opponents of Mecca were pardoned
 is maafi kii ghatana ke baad makka ke sabhi log islam main parivartit hue
 But Pember faced many protests and negative situations, but he squeezed the positivity out of every negativity, which led to his victory in every sphere of life

 Muhammad Sahab had to leave Mecca in 622
 muslmaan is ghatana ko hijra kehete hai or yahaan se islamic calendar hijri aarambh hota he
 In the next few days, he had many followers in Medina, then he returned to Mecca and defeated the rulers of Mecca in battle
 iske baad kai log unke anuyaayi ho gaye or unke samarthakon ko musalmaan kaha is dauraan unhen kai virodhon tathaa ladaayeeyaan ladani padi
 First of all, there was a battle of Badr with cousins of his own clan - in which an army of 313 defeated the invasion of about 900 people
 iske baad arab prayadweep ke kai hisson main jaakar virodhiyon se yuddh hue
 Jews and some Christians also lived in Mecca and Medina at that time
 par us samay unako ek alag dharm ko rup main na dekh kar ishwar kii eksatta ke samarthak mana jaataa tha
 Hazrat Muhammad Makkah returned
 logon ko aisa lag rahaa tha ki bada yuddh hoga, laqin koi yuddh nahin hua, log shantipurvak hi rahe, or mohammad sahab or unke anuyai makkah main pravesh kiya
 In this way Makkah became independent without any war
 mohammad sahab kii makka vaapasi islam ke itihaas main ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi jisase ek sampradaay ke rup main na rah kar yah baad main ek dharm ban gaya
 In 632, you had a problem
 us samay tak sampoorn arab prayadweep islam ke sutara main bandha chukaa tha
 In 632, when Prophet Muhammad died, fear of fragmentation of Muslims arose
 koi bhi vyakti islam kaa vaid uttaradhikari nahin tha
 This successor would also own such a large empire
 isse pehle arab log bagentine yaa farsi senaaon main ladaako ke rup main ladate rahe the par khud kabhi itane bade samrajya ke maalik nahin bane the
 At the same time an institution of Khilafat was formed which decided who is the successor of Islam
 muhammd sahab ke dost abu bakar ko mohammad kaa uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya gaya
 The fourth Khalifa Ali was a supporter of Muhammad Sahab and married Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sahab
 par iske baavjood unke khilaafat ke samay tisare khalipha osman ke samarthakon ne unke khilaafat to chunauti di or arab samrajya main grihayuddh chhid gaya
 Ali was assassinated in 961 and Mu'awiya, a close relative of Osman, declared himself a Khalifa
 isi samay se umeyyad vansh kaa aarambh hua
 It bears its name on the family who played a major role in the battle with Muhammad Sahib before Mecca surrendered to Islam
 jald hi arab samrajya ne bagentine samrajya or saasaani samrajya kaa rup le liya
 Khilafat started transferring from father to son
 rajdhani damishq banaai gai
 The Umayyads preferred the Arabs very much in the empire, but the Arabs criticized them
 arabon kaa kahana tha ki ummayadon ne islam ko bahut hi sansaarik bana diya he or unamem islam ke mul main kii gai baaten kam hoti ja rahi hai
 Together these Muslims considered Ali to be the rightful caliph of Islam
 unhen laga ki ali hi islam kaa vaastavik uttaradhikari ho sakate the
 In 940, a Persian Muslim convert named Abu Muslim created a huge public against the Umayyads
 usne khorasaan main ummayadon ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Already there was resentment against the presence of Arabs in Khorasan, so he got massive public support
 usne yah kahkar logon ko ummyadon ke khilaaf saavdhaan kiya ki ve log islam ke sahi vaaris nahin hai or ve satta kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 The luxury lifestyle of the Umayyads instigated them even more
 san 949-950 ke bich ummayadon dwaara bheje gaye sainikon ko haraa diya or iske baad apana ek nayaa khalipha ghoshit kar diya - abul abbaas
 Abbas was of Muhammad's lineage but was linked to Muhammad by another brother besides Ali
 par usase abu islam kii lokapriyata dekhi nahin gai or usne abu ko phaansi par lataka diya
 This led to anger among the people against Abbas
 jin logon ko abbaas par bhi bharosa nahin hua ve shiya bane - aaj iran kii 92 % janata shiya he
 However, Abbas and his descendants made their capital in Baghdad and ruled for the next nearly 500 years
 abbasiyon ke samay main iraniyon ko bhi samrajya main bhagidaari mili
 Although he did not hold any religious position, Iranians got the support of the government due to their good in arts like architecture and poetry
 dhyaan rahe ki kai madhyakaalin islamic vichaarak, jyotishi or kavi isi samay paidi hue the

 unhone kavitaaon kii rubaai style main maharath hasil kii or vigyaan main kai yoga daan die - jisamen bijganit or khanij-shaastra bhi shaamil hai
 Persian poets like Firdausi and Sufi thinkers like Rumi were born at this time
 haalanki inamen se adhiktar ko baghdad se koi aarthik-vritti nahin mili thi par is main islam ke dharamshastriyon kii dakhal kaa na hona hi ek bada yogadan tha
 At this time, of course, it was difficult to place the entire Islamic empire, which had spread from Spain to India, inside a military hero
 isliye baghdad sirf dharmik mukhyalay rahaa or sthaneey shaasha sainik rup se swatantra rahe
 In Eastern Iran, where the Samanis and then the Ghaznavis remained independent, the Saljuq Turks became powerful in the Central and West
 dharmayudhon ke samay bhi baghdad ne koi badi safalataa lene main naakaami dikhaai
 At the same time, the descendants of the Umayyads who were out of power formed a separate Khilafat in Spain in 929 which became the Islamic rival of Baghdad
 1258 main mongolon kii teji se badhati shakti ne baghdad ko haraa diya or shahar ko lut liya gaya
 Millions of people were killed and Islamic libraries were burned
 us samay mongol muslim nahin the lekin agle 100 saalon main ve muslim ban gaye
 The Abbasids held power in Baghdad until the thirteenth century
 par iran or uske aasapaas ke kshetron main abu islam ke prati bahut shraddha bhav tha or abbasiyon ke khilaaf rosh
 According to him, Abu was a true priest of Islam and Ali and Hussain were true officials of Islam
 is vishwaas ko maanane waalon ko shiya kaha gaya
 Ali Shia means the group of Ali
 in logon kii nazar main in logon ne sach kaa rasta apanaaya or inako shaskaon ne bahut sataaya
 Abu Islam also had to embrace the gallows after finding the right caliph for Islam
 uske saath bhi vahi hua jo ali yaa imam hossain ke saath hua
 Therefore, Shia with this view lived in Abbasid rule for many years which were Sunni
 inako samay samay par pratadit bhi kiya gaya
 Later in the fifteenth century, after the coming of Safawi rule, the Shia people were liberated from this persecution
 misr main islam kaa prachaar to ummayadon ke samay hi ho gaya tha
 The Arabs planned for empire expansion in Spain for the first time in 710
 dhire-dhire unke samrajya main spain ke uttari bhaag bhi aa gaye
 By the end of the tenth century it had become part of the Abbasi Khilafat
 isi samay tak sindh bhi arabon ke niyantran main aa gaya tha
 In 1095, Pope Arban II prepared the background of the Crusades

 Now the question arises as to how Hindi is supported in mobile phones
 mobile main hindi samarthan ke mukhya rup se teen pahalu hai
 Whether Hindi text or text can be displayed on mobile? If Hindi cannot be seen in the phone, then there will be no input, this is the first condition of Hindi support
 kuch phonon main hindi pradarshan kaa purna samarthan hota he
 Some have partial Unicode support, but Hindi is not visible correctly i
e
 quantities and conjuncts do not appear correctly and Hindi appears scattered
 iskaa kaaran he ki phone main hindi font to hota he parantu phone kaa complex script leout ingine hindi kaa samarthan nahin karata arthath devanagari ko sahi tareeke se rendor nahin karata
 In such phones, Hindi can be seen correctly in some software which uses its own Hindi font engine instead of the phone
 jin phonon main hindi kaa bilkul samarthan nahin hota unamem hindi kii jagah dibbe prakat hote hai
 If the phone has support for Hindi display, there may or may not be an option for input
 yadi phone main hindi input kaa vikalp ho to hindi main esemes bheje ja sakate hai tathaa vaib par kahin bhi taxt box main hindi likhi ja sakati he
 With this option, all the work can be done on the internet including sending emails, writing letters, commenting in Hindi from mobile
 adhiktar phonon main hindi tankan ke liye tii-9 system hota he
 All Devanagari characters are accommodated on the nine buttons on the keypad and the correct characters are typed by pressing them repeatedly
 iske atirikt kai phonon menti-9 purvanumaan bhi hota he jisase ki purvaabhaasi input dwaara keval kuch batan dabaakar shabdon ko tip kiya ja saktaa he

 jo shabd phone ke purvanumaan shabdkosh main na hon unhen joda ja saktaa he jisase agali baar ve purvanumaan dwaara tip kiye ja sakate hai
 Some phones with touch screen which have Hindi support are available with inscript onscreen virtual keyboard
 yah computer ke ikhmai kii tarah hota he jisase ki phone main kahin bhi hindi likhi ja sakati he
 Hindi interface means that the phone has the option of Hindi as the interface language
 phone main hindi interphes bhashaa chunane par sabhi minu, vikalp aadi hindi main pradarshit hote hai
 However, even when Hindi interface is available, very few people use it due to incorrect translation and clear terminology
 yadi phone main interphes bhashaa hindi kaa vikalp he to aam taur par hindi disple evam input samarthan hoga hi
 To find it in Nokia phone, go to Menu> Settings> Phone> Phone Language
 yadi he to aapke phone main pradarshan evam input kaa samarthan maujuud he, interphes bhashaa kaa ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 To find out, try sending a message in Hindi from that phone to another phone, or if GPRS is enabled in the phone, try opening a Hindi site
 isse pataa chal jayega ki phone main hindi padhi ja sakati he yaa nahin? All low level, mostly medium tier and some lower tier phones of Nokia have Hindi support

 Most of Nokia's touchscreen phones are equipped with S60 v5 version which has partial support for Hindi display, ie Hindi appears in the phone due to the Hindi font, but not properly rendered, due to which the numbers and ligatures do not appear correctly
 , For example Nokia N97, Nokia N97 Mini, Nokia 5800 Express Music, Nokia 5233, Nokia 5230 etc
 Symbian^3 vaale smartphonon jaise bin8 aadi main bhi yahi sthiti he
 In these, Hindi appears correctly in the Opera mobile browser

 The king was considered the lord of the entire land
 samantgan raja ke prati swamibhakti baratate the, uski raksha ke liye sena susajjit karte the or badale main raja se bhoomi pate the
 The feudal lords were not authorized to buy and sell land

 europe main samantvaad kaa vikaas saamanytah in paristhitiyon main hua
 After the breakup of the Roman Empire, it was captured by the uncivilized castes of Western Europe - Frank Lombard and the Goths
 in luteri jatiyon ne samaaj or sarkaar ko sarvatha naveen rup diya
 By the fifth century the Roman Empire had become unable to defend itself
 german kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman ke kaaran italy ke gaanv asurakshit se ho gaye the, kyonki sarkaar suraksha karne main samarth nahin thi jiske parinamswaroop janata ne apni suraksha ke liye shaktishaalee varg se samjhauta kiya
 These powerful classes later became the basis of feudalism
 inacychlopedia britanika main bhi suraksha kii aavashyaktaa par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 According to him, "in the birth of feudalism, the sense of security was predominant
 sambhavit videshi akraman tathaa sarkari afasaron kii aniyantrit maangon se chhutkaare ke liye ek aisi satta kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii ja rahi thi, jo unhen kisi bhi keemat par suraksha pradaan kar sake
 '' europe main samantvaad ke udai ke peeche ek or jabardast kaaran rahaa hai
 Due to the remote expansion of the empire, the emperor was unable to operate the entire empire smoothly
 isliye satta kaa vikendrikaran ho gaya jo aavashyak kaary hone ke saath loktantr kii disha main ek kadam tha
 Gradually, this powerful class which provided security to the people, ie feudalism, spread throughout Europe

 bhandari bhi ‘‘samtanvaad ko samvedatmak sarkaar kaa ek rup maanate he jisamen samant madhyasthata kaa kaam karte the
 While affirming some of these grounds, Dr
 Satish Chandra opined that "feudalism in Europe was related to two systems, one of which was the agricultural slave system and the other was the military organization
 ’’ is aadhaar par krishi daasatv evam sainik sanghathan donon samantvaad ke mukhya aadhaar he
 On the basis of this analysis, it can be said that feudalism was an administrative system based on decentralization related to the land system in Europe in which feudal was the bridge between the supreme power and the peasants, which were connected to both the parties through fixed contracts
 europe main rajya seva karne ke puraskaar swaroop saamanton ko bhoomi di jaati thi or un saamanton kii prashasnic dekh-rekh main jitna kshetra hota tha, uskaa puraa rajasav unheen ko praapt hota tha kintu vah apane adhinsth logon ke praapt kar main se apane prabhu ko niyamit rup se kuch nazar bhejtaa rahegaa
 The king used to give land to the officers for cash
 jameen un anya logon ko bhi di jaati thi jinako raja puraskrit karnaa chahta tha
 Hence, in European feudalism, peasants had to work for landlords or individuals who were given land and who were called feudal lords
 saamanton kaa kartavya raja ke liye sainik ekatra karnaa tha
 Prof
 Sijvik has considered feudalism to be the result of four different tendencies
 pehali pravriti ek manushya kii duusare manushya ke saath, jo usase ucchtar str kaa tha, vaiyaktik sambandhon kii thi
 From the point of view of their security, they established a relationship with a powerful person who was personal rather than citizenship
 sarankshak or ashrith ek duusare ke saath vaiyaktik sambandhon ke judaav ke kaaran bandhe hue the
 The guardian used to protect his dependents and his strength increased due to the increasing number of dependents
 duusari pravriti manushya ke adhikaar, rajnatik sthaan tathaa uski saamaajik sthiti ke nirdhaaran karne kii pravriti thi
 In feudalism, the political relationship and social status of a person depends on how much land he owned
 teesri pravriti yah thi ki bade-bade bhupati apane pradeshon main raajnneetik satta kaa prayog karne lage
 This change happened gradually
 unhen yah adhikaar prarambh se praapt nahin tha, kendriya satta kii durbalata ke kaaran jaise-jaise unki shakti badi, unhone apane pradesh kii suvyavastha ke liye apane adhikaron ko badhaayaa or un par shashan karne lage
 The fourth trend was the tendency of segregation of social classes, there were two types of people dependent on the king or feudal
 pehle ve jo sainik sevaaon ke badale raja yaa saamanton se bandhe hue the tathaa duusare ve jo unki bhoomi par krishi yaa anya prakaar ke kaary karte the
 Mr
 H
S
 Devius, while determining the nature of communism, analyzed its fundamental tendencies, stating that "under this system, a person was contracted to his lord in terms of security
" vah apane saamanti prabhut se pruthak apni swatantra satta kii ghoshnaa nahin kar saktaa tha
 War was the main principle of the feudal system
 bhai-bhai ke viruddh or putr pita ke viruddh ladane main koi sankoch nahin karata tha
 The condition of the lower class was also very lamentable
 ’’ prastut drushtikon main vyakti kii suraksha kii bhaavana par adhik bal diya gaya he evam saamanti sambandhon tathaa anubandhon kii dridhtaa kii ore sanket kiya gaya he
 The lord from whom the person benefited, had to demonstrate his masterly devotion to him
 vyakti kii nijee swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati thi
 According to Henny S
 Lucus, "the feudal organization had an important place in the feudal organization
 prayek saamanti rajkumaar ke adheen anek vesols hote the, jo use apni salaah tathaa yuddh main sahaayta dene ke liye pratibandhit the
 '' shri lukas ke matanusaar raja or samant donon kii parsparik anubandhta siddh hoti he, jiskaa aadhaar parsparik aadan-pradaan tha
 The feudal provided military aid to the king, was entitled to receive the king's advice by giving critical advice to the king
 bewstor mahoday ne apane kosh main samantvaad ke swaroop main prakaash daalate hue likhaa he ki ‘‘yah ek aisi raajnneetik vyavastha thi jo raja or samant ke bhoomi se sambandhit parsparik sambandhon par adhrith thi tathaa jisamen bhoomi praptakarta dwaara seva or aadar-bhaavana swaamitv, sahaayta, vivaah aadi kii ghatnaayen pramukh thi
 '' chambers insaclopeediya main samantvaad vishyak manyataon main swami bhakthi or ajna-paalan par bal dete hue likhaa gaya he ki ‘‘samantvaad shabd yadhyapi samaaj vyavastha kaa ek prakaar he tathaa mukhya rup se un vyakti sambandhon kii vyakhya karata he jo jameen ke adhikaar or vyaktigat sampati ke aadhaar par ek vyakti kii duusare vyakti ke prati adheenta prakat karte he, tathaapi yah vyaktigat sambandhon or niyamon kii us vishisht paddati kii ore sanket karata he jisamen ek ore suraksha tathaa nirvaah he tathaa duusari ore seva tathaa ajna paalan he
 Thus, the responsibility of the security of the feudal subsistence and feudalism: social and economic development process was on the Lord
 saath hi samant prabhu kii ajnapaalan or seva bhakthi se anubandhit tha
 On non-compliance, the king could only in principle remove him from the land by withdrawing it
 yah keval praarambhik saiddhanthik swaroop tha, kintu vyavhaarik rup main aisa nahin hota tha
 This system changed over time
 bhoomi pehle aaajeevan di jaati thi, baad main anuvanshik adhikaar hone laga
 Then he also provided the land received on the same terms on which he had received it from the king
 is prakaar saamanti vyavastha vanshanugat rup se chalane lagi
 That view can be seen in the context of the confirmation of the aforesaid opinion
 ‘‘saamanti pratha vanshanugat thi
 After the death of Samanta, his successor was made his lord, who used to visit the state court and presented his lord's devotion to the king by offering something
 ’’ Thus by the king giving land to the feudal and by the feudal lords to the chieftains below him, hereditary and a new level of feudalism ie sub-feudalism was born
 krishakon kaa sambandh sidhe raja se na hokar ek madhyasth kuleen ucchvarg se hone laga
 Although the practice of money was not completely abolished, it was rarely used, land was used as money
 saamanti vyavastha kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn siddhanth anuvanshikta kaa tha
 The main conclusions that can be drawn when analyzing the views of the aforesaid scholars regarding Western feudalism
 kahin to prabhu or samant ke anubandhatmak sambandhon main nihit kanoonee paksh par bal diya gaya he, kahin saamaajik paksh par kahin aarthik paksh par, kintu kuch aise saamaanya tatv bhi he jinka lagbhag sabhi vichaarkon ke maton main sanket miltaa he
 These common elements include land grants by the Lord and service and obedience by the feudal lords
 inke saath europea samantvaad ke swaroop nirdhaaran main krishi daasatv pratha bhi ek mahatvapurn tatv he
 Under this, the peasants were tied to the land and the real owners of the land were the zamindars who worked as the link between the real tenants and the king
 kisaan jameen jotane ke badale saamanton ko upaj or beth-begaar ke rup main lagaan adaa karte the
 The basis of this system was a self-sufficient economy, in which the production of goods was not for sale in the market, but mainly for the use of local farmers and their owners
 ’’ There is no broadly accepted modern definition of feudalism
 shabd samantvaad yaa saamanti vyavastha purv aadhunik kaal main gadha gaya tha or aksar raajnneetik or mat prachaar sandarbh main istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 By the mid-20th century, François Louis Ganshoff's Fudilism, 3rd ed
, Became a traditional definition of feudalism
 1960 ke dashak ke baad se jab mark bloch ke fudal sosayadi iskaa samavarti hua jab ise pehali baar angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya, kai madhyakaalin itihaaskaaron ne ek vyapak saamaajik pahalu ko isamen shaamil kiya, isamen jameendaari ke band ko joda, jise kabhi-kabhi "saamanti vyavastha" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Since the 1970s, when Elizabeth A
R
 Brown published The Tyranny of a Construction, with many re-examining the evidence and concluding that feudalism is an incurable term and should be removed from scholarly and academic discussion altogether or at least only for serious merit and warning
 It should be used together
 europea sandarbh ke baahar, samantvaad kii avadharana kaa saamaanya taur par saadrishy ke dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he, shogun ke tahat sabase adhik baar japan main charchaa kii jaati he or kabhi-kabhi madhyayugin or gondarine ithiopia
 haalanki, kuch saadrishy samantvaad ko aage liya gaya he, pracheen misr, parthian samrajya, bhartiya upmahadweep or america ke dakshin ladaai ke pehle vividhta ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 The term feudalism is also used — often inappropriately or even predominantly — those applied to medieval Europe — often inappropriately or blasphemously — in non-western countries where institutions and practices were considered to be the same with medieval Europe
 kuch itihaaskaaron or raajnneetik siddhanton kaa maananaa he ki kai myanon main samantvaad shabd kaa prayog iske vishisht arth ko vanchit karne ke liye kiya gaya he jiske chalate samaaj ko samajhane main is upyogi avadharana ko asweekaar kiya gaya he
 The feudalistic version of François Louis Ganshoff describes the mutual legal and military obligations between major wars and revolves around three important concepts of God, vassal, and ownership
 ek prabhu vyapak arth main ek mahaan sandarbh he jo jameen par kabja karata tha, ek jagirdaar bhagwaan ke dwaara jameen ko apanaataa tha or bhoomi ko jaagir ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In exchange for the use of ownership and protection of the lord, the vassal will provide some form of service to the lord
 vahaan kaarykaal saamanti desh ke kai kismein the, jisamen sainya or gaiyr sainya shaamil the
 The form of feudal feudalism was based on the relationship between the lord and the jagirdar, between the obligations and its authority
 isse pehle ki prabhu kisi ko bhoomi anudaan kar sake, unhen us vyakti ko ek jagirdaar bananaa padataa tha
 It was performed in a ceremonial and symbolic ceremony called the Commendation Ceremony and this oath and tribute act was divided into two parts
 shradhanjali ke dauraan swami or maatahat ek anubandh main aate hai jo jagirdaar ko apane aadesh main prabhu ke liye ladane ke li pravesh karnaa hota tha, haalanki prabhu ko bahari takaton se jagirdaar kii raksha karne kaa vaada ke liye sahamat hona padataa tha

 a geometric series is a series whose successive terms have a constant ratio
 udhaaharan ke liye, There is a geometric series whose absolute ratio is 3
 nimnlikhit shrenee, gunottar shrenee kaa saamaanya rup he, Where a is the first term of the class and r is the absolute ratio
 mimnlikhit talika main kai gunottar shreniyan or unke pratham pad evam sarvanisht anupaat dikhaae gaye hai- Many properties of the geometric series depend on its integral ratio r
 kisi gunottar shrenee kaa yoga ek simit sankhya hogi yadi uske sarvanisht anupaat r kaa sankhyatmak maan 1 se kam ho
 In such a situation, the terms after that category go on being negligible and even though there are infinite positions in that category, the sum is limited, not infinite
 mana ham nimnlikhit shrenee kaa yoga nikaalnaa chaahate hai- This series has common ratio 2 / 3
 If we multiply through by this common ratio, then the initial 1 becomes a 2 / 3, the 2 / 3 becomes a 4 / 9, and so on: This new series is the same as the original, except that the first term is missing
 Subtracting the new series s from the original series s cancels every term in the original but the first, a similar technique can be used to evaluate any self-similar expression
 For r ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle r eq 1}, the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is where a is the first term of the series, and r is the common ratio
 We can derive this formula as follows: so, As n goes to infinity, the absolute value of r must be less than one for the series to converge
 The sum then becomes When a = 1, this can be simplified to the left-hand side being a geometric series with common ratio r
 The formula also holds for complex r, with the corresponding restriction, the modulus of r is strictly less than one
 We can prove that the geometric series converges using the sum formula for a geometric progression: Since = 1−rn+1 and rn+1 → 0 for | r | < 1
 Convergence of geometric series can also be demonstrated by rewriting the series as an equivalent telescoping series
 Consider the function, Note that Thus, If then So s converges to Half a century of my poetry is a work by Harivansh Rai Bachchan

 prabandhan lekhankan yaa prabandhkeey lekhankan sanghathanon ke bheetar prabandhakon ke liye lekhankan jaankaree ke un praavdhaanon tathaa upyog se sambandhit he, jo unhen suvigy prabandhan nirnyon ko lene ke liye ek aadhaar pradaan karata he jo unhen unke prabandhan tathaa niyantran kaaryon ko behatar tareeke se karne kii anumati degaa
 Unlike financial accounting information, management accounting information: yah vibhinn prabhaavon ke kaaran he: prabandhan lekhankan jaankaree kaa upyog, aamtaur par nirnay lene ke liye sanghathan ke bheetar kiya jaataa he
 According to the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, management accounting "is the process of identifying, measuring, storing, analyzing, preparing, interpreting and communicating the information used by management to plan, assess and control within an entity and its resources
 Ensuring the proper use and accountability of
 prabandhan lekhankan main shairdharakon, karjadaataaon, niamak agenciyon or kar adhikariyon jaise gaiyr-prabandhan samoohon ke liye vittiya report kii taiyaari" bhi shaamil he 
 According to The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, management accounting as a practice extends to the following three areas: da istitute of certifoid management accountents ke anusaar, "ek prabandhan lekhaakaar apane gyaan or kushalta ko vittiya or anya nirnay unmukh jaankaree kii taiyaari or prastuti kare is prakaar lagu karata he ki prabandhan ko nitiyon ke nirmaan or upkram kii karrwai kii yojana or niyantran main sahaayta praapt ho
" isliye prabandhan lekhaakaaron ko lekhaakaaron ke bich "maan-rachanakaaron ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 They are more interested in taking foresight and decisions that affect the future of the organization than in the historical recording and compliance dimensions of the business
 isliye prabandhan lekha gyaan or sanghathan ke andar vividh kshetron or kaaryon se praapt kiya ja saktaa he, jaise, soochna prabandhan, kosh, dakshata lekha pariksha, vipanan, moolyankan, mulya nirdhaaran, rasad, aadi
 In the late 1980s, accounting professionals and teachers were widely criticized on the grounds that despite rapid changes in the business environment, management accounting practices had changed little in the last 60 years
 vyavsaayik lekha sansthaanon ne shaayad isse dar kar ki prabandhan lekhaakaar teji se vyapaar sanghathanon main zarurat se zyaada ke rup main dekhe jaaengen, baad main pribandhan lekhaankanon ke liye adhik navonmesh kushalta set ke vikaas ke liye paryaapt sansadhano ko samarpit kiya
 The differences between 'traditional and innovative' management accounting practices can be underlined by reference to cost control techniques
 laagat lekha prabandhan lekhankan main kendriya paddati he or paramparaagat rup se, prabandhan lekhaakaaron kii pramukh takanic bhinnata vishleshan, tha, jo kachche maal or utpaadan avadhi ke dauraan upyog kiye gaye shram ke vaastavik or bajet kiye gaye laagton kii tulana ke prati vyavasthit drushtikon he
 However some types of variance analysis are still used by most manufacturer firms
 in dinon yah navonmeshi takneekon ke sangyojan main upyog kiye jane ko pravruth dikhaai detaa he, jaise jivan chakra laagat vishleshan or gatividhi-aadhaarit laagat, jo mashtishk main aadhunik vyavsaayik vaataavaran ke nirdisht ayaamon ke saath dizin kiya gaya he
 Life cycle cost is the assumption that managers' ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product becomes widespread when the product is in its own lifecycle design stage, because the product design cost changes are small
 Can lead to significant savings
 gatividhi-aadhaarit laagat kii manyata he ki, aadhunik kaarkaanon main, adhikansh nirmaan laagat 'gatividhiyon' ke pariman dwaara nirdhaarit kiye jate hai or isliye, prabhvi laagat niyantran kii kunjee in gatividhiyon kii kushalta ko anukulit karnaa he
 Activity-based accounting is also known as cause and effect accounting
 jivan chakra laagat or gatividhi-aadhaarit laagat donon hi, vishisht aadhunik kaarkaane main, yah manyata dete hai ki vighatnkaaree ghatnaon se bachaav kachche maal kii laagat ko kam karne kii tulana main adhik vyapak mahatta kaa he
 The effect of direct labor as an activity-based cost carrier also reduces and focuses attention rather than cost-bearing activities, such as provision of service or production of product components
 aaj nigam main anya bhoomikaaon ke anuroop, prabandhan lekhaakaaron ke paas dohare reporting sambadh hai
 As a strategic partner and provider of decision-based financial and executive information, the management accountant is responsible for managing the business team and reporting on the relationships and responsibilities of the corporation's financial organization at the same time
 gatividhiyon ke prabandhan lekhaakaar purvanumaan or yojana, bhinn vishleshan ke pradarshan, samet vyavsaay main laagat kii nigaraanee or samiksha vah hai jinhen vitt or vyavsaayik team donon kii dohari jimmedaari he
 Examples of functions where responsibility may be more meaningful to a business management team versus a corporate finance department are new product cost development, action research, business carrier metrics, sales management scorecard, and client profitability analysis
 Preparation of certain financial reports, reconciliation of financial data of the source system, risk and regulatory Reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they change with the unified fixed financial information of all segments of the corporation
 lekhankan or vitt karier maarg kii pragati ko dekhte hue ek vyapak drishy yah mana jaataa he ki vittiya lekhankan prabandhan lekhankan ke liye ek mahatvapurn kadam he
 Consistent with the notion of value creation, management accountants help difficult financial accounting to sustain business success even if it exceeds compliance and historical effort
 vaise nigamon main, jo apane adhikansh laabhon ko soochna arthvvastha se sanchalit karte hai, jaise bank, prakaashan grihon, doorsanchaar companiyaan or suraksha sanvidaakaar, soochna takanic laagat aniyantrit vyay ke aise mahatvapurn strot hai jo aakaar main praaia: kul kshatipurti laagat or sampatti sambandhi laagton ke baad sabase vyapak corporate laagat hai
 The management accounting function in such organizations is to work closely with the Information Technology Department Information Technology Cost Transparency
 prabandhan lekhankan kaa ek atyant alp abhivyakt vaikalpik vichaar yah he ki sanghathanon main yah na to tatasth yaa saumy prabhaav he, balki nigaraanee ke madhyam se prabandhan niyantran ke liye tantra he
 This idea specifically explores management accounting in the context of management control theory
 bhinn rup se kaha jaae to, prabandhan lekhankan soochna vah tantra he jiskaa upyog prabandhakon dwaara sanghathan main apane niyantran kaaryon ko saral banane ke liye sanghathan ke sampurna aantarik sanrachana ke paridrishy ke vaahan ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
