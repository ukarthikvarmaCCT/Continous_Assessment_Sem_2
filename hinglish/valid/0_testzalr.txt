 'sadakah or Sadak' refers to "voluntary donations" in the modern context
 quran ke anusaar, shabd svaichhik bhent kaa arth he, jiskaa dhan "daata" kii ichha par he
 According to Arabic terminology, words derived from the root sa daqa cover "many meanings associated with ideas of righteousness and truth"
 quran main, sambandhit shabd kaa prayog "naitik utkrushtataa", jaise ki al siddiq, jo ki bhavishyadvaktaa yusuf, yaa sadik ke varnan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Modern research, on the other hand, try to ethically link the word linguistically to the Hebrew Anudana sedaka
 kuch visheshgy isliye nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki shabd sadaaka ek duusari bhashaa se liya gaya shabd he
 According to the Quran, Sadaq leads in purification of those who provide
 quran kaa kahana he ki sadhaaka ko kisi bhautik rup main nahin hona chahie or yah "svaichhik prayaas" yaa ek prakaar kaa shabd ho saktaa he
 This is in agreement with a statement, given to Muhammad, stating, "every good deed is a form of Sadak
 " quran ke drushtikon se, "apmaan" ke saath achche shabdon or "dayaa" sadaaka se behatar he, or unke dwaara sweekaar kiye jane ke liye janata main ise karne kii bajaay daan ke liye "budhimaani" kii peshkash karne ke liye behatar he quran "daanavpurn saarvajanik vyavhaar" ke dwaara udaar yaa sadak ke mulya ke saath samjhauta karne ke uddeshy se daan karne kii aalochana bhi karata he, "keval saamaanya rup se dharmarth kaary vishuddh rup se swayanseva karte hue
 "the Qur'an suggests that Sadaka is not only meant to support the poor, but can also be donated to those who" did not see need "and who needed help to extend their lives or Who should be directed towards new jobs and "economic opportunities"
 kuch hadison ke anusaar, "ek prakaar kaa shabd or muskuraahat" ko sadaq mana ja saktaa he or iskaa sabase acha rup "gyaan par guzar rahaa he
 "furthermore, Muhammad said in the hadith that Sadaka removes seventy doors of evil
 kuch avasaron par shabd kaa prayog zakaat or nafaaka ke saath kiya jaataa he, haalanki, jabaki jakaat anivaary he, sadakada aamtaur par svaichhik daan kaa sandarbh detaa he

 First of all, in 1908, Gandhiji came to know about the spinning wheel while he was in England
 uske baad ve baraabar is disha main sochate rahe
 They wanted the charkha to be brought from somewhere
 san 1916 main sabarmati ashram kii sthapana hui
 After two years of great efforts, in 1918 a spinning wheel was found near a widowed sister
 is samay tak jo bhi charakhe chalate the or jinaki khoj ho pai thi, ve sab khadey charakhe hi the
 Nowadays standing charkha has a sitting, two pillars, a farai and a circle of eight rows
 desh ke bhinn bhinn bhaagon main bhinn bhinn aakaar ke khadey charakhe chalate hai
 The diameter of the spinning wheel is 12 inches to 24 inches and the length of the pillows is 19 inches
 us samay ke charakhon or takuon kii tulana aaj ke charakhon se karne par aashcharya hota he
 Of all the charkha samples received so far, Chikkol's standing charkha was the best

 The All India Khadi Mandal was established in 1923 during the Kakinada Congress, but by then there had not been much progress towards the reform of charkha
 congress kaa dhyaan raajnneeti kii ore tha, par gandhi ji use rachanaatmak kaaryon kii ore bhi kheenchna chaahate the
 Hence, the All India Charkha Union was established on 22 September 1925 in Patna

 In 1923, a prize of Rs 5,000 was also announced, but no developed specimen was received
 29 july san 1929 ko charkha sangh kii ore se gandhi ji kii sharton ke anusaar charkha banane waalon ko ek lakh rupaya puraskaar dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Many people tried to fulfill the conditions that Gandhiji had kept, but no one got success
 kirloskar bandhuon dwaara ek charkha banaaya gaya tha, lekin vah bhi shart puri na hone ke kaaran asafal hi rahaa
 There were equal usage experiments on the size of the spinning wheel in terms of utility

 Gandhiji used to spin himself

 The migration cycle was also made for children or for cutting in migration, which was less than the farmer cycle, but it was convenient to carry

 Depending on the level of activity in the specific workload of the mission, it may have different levels but it will be correlated with the principles of group balance
 Actual water usage during space missions generally doubles mainly due to non-biological use
 Additionally, the quantity and variety of waste products vary with mission duration that includes hair, nails, skin flakes and other organic wastes that are included in campaigns that are longer than one week

 Life support systems often allow the cultivation of indoor plants that can be grown within edible buildings and / or vessels
 Often, this system is designed in such a way that it recycles all nutrients
 This is done, for example by the integration of waste materials, toilets move back into the compost system, allowing food crops to get nutrients from them
 The food coming from the crops is eaten again by the users of the system and this cycle continues

 Liv Simnovich was a psychologist of the Vygotsky Soviet Union and leader of the Vygotsky board
 unhone maanav ke saanskrithik tathaa jaev-saamaajik vikaas kaa siddhanth diya jise saanskrithik-aitihaasik manovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 His main field of work was developmental psychology
 unhone bacchon main ucch sangyanatmak kaaryon ke vikaas se sambandhit ek siddhanth prastut kiya
 In the early period of his career he argued that the power of reasoning develops through symbols and symbols
 vaigotski kaa saamaajik drushitakone sangyanatmak vikaas kaa ek pragatisheel vishleshan prastut karata he
 In fact, Vygotsky declared dialogue between society and its cultural relations as an important dimension in cognitive development of a child
 zaan pyaaze kii tarah vaigotski bhi yah maanate the ki bachche gyaan kaa nirmaan karte hai
 But according to them, cognitive development cannot be isolated, it occurs in language-development, social-development, even physical-development as well as socio-cultural context
 vaigotsaki ke anusaar bachche ke sangyanatmak vikaas ko samajhane ke liye ek vikasaatmak upaagam kii aavashyaktaa he jo ki iskaa shuru se pareekshan kare tathaa vibhinn roopon main hue parivartan ko thik se pahchaan paae
 Thus a specific mental function such as self-language should be evaluated as developmental processes and not singularly
 vaigotsaki ke anusaar sangyanatmak vikaas ko samajhane ke liye un aujaaron kaa pareekshan ati aavashyak he jo sangyanatmak vikaas main madhyasthata karte hai tathaa use rup pradaan karte hai
 Based on this, they also believe that language is an important tool of cognitive development

 yahaan par unhone sangyanatmak vikaas par vishesh kaary kiya, visheshkar bhashaa or chintan ke sambandh par
 His study describes the impact of historical, cultural and social factors on the development of cognition
 vaayagaski ke anusaar bhashaa samaaj dwaara diya gaya pramukh sankethik upkaran he jo ki balak ke vikaas main vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he
 Just as we cannot study a water molecule through its parts, similarly a person cannot be studied separately from his environment

 Waigasky studied onions while studying cognitive development and then developed his approach
 pyaaze ke anusaar vikaas or adhigam do alag dharanaen hai jinamein sangyaan bhashaa ke vikaas ko ek prakritik prakriya ke rup main prabhavit karata he
 After development, learning is the attainment of the necessary skills at that particular stage
 is prakaar pyaaje ke siddhanth ke anusaar vikaas, adhigam kii purvavastha he na ki iskaa parinaam
 That is, the level of learning is above development
 pyaaze ke anusaar adhigam ke liye sarvapratham ek nishchit vikaas str par pahunchnaa aavashyak he
 According to Vygaski, the child has an active participation in the interpersonal process of learning and development, in which language has a direct effect on cognition
 adhigam or vikaas antarsambandhit prakriyaayein he jo chaatr ke jivan ke pehle din se prarambh ho jaati hai
 According to Vygasky, learning at different developmental levels of different children may be identical but not uniform, because the social experience of all children is different
 unke anusaar adhigam vikaas ko prerit karata he
 This approach of his is different from the theory of onions and other theories
 vaayagaski apane saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth ke liye jane jate he
 According to this theory, social interaction brings constant changes in the child's thinking and behavior, which may vary from one culture to another
 unke anusaar kisi balak kaa sangyanatmak vikaas uske anya vyaktiyon se antarsambandhon par nirbhar karata he
 Vayagaski combined cognition and social environment in his theory
 balak apane se bade or gyani vyaktiyon ke sampark main aakar chintan or vyavhaar ke samskruti anuroop tareeke sikhte he
 There are several major elements of socio-cultural theory
 pratham mahatvapurn tatv he- vyaktigat bhashaa
 In this, the children interact with themselves to control and direct their behavior
 saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth kaa doosraa mahatvapurn tatv he- nikatatam vikaas kaa kshetra
 Waigaski has learned during his experience as a teacher that children can go beyond their actual developmental level to solve problems if they get some instruction
 is str ko vaayagaski ne sambhavit vikaas kaha
 The difference / area between the actual development level of the child and the possible development level was called by Vyagaski as the area of closest development

 unke is gun ko atichaalakata kehete hai
 In addition to zero resistivity, in the case of superconductivity, the magnetic field within the material also becomes zero, which is known as the Mesnar effect
 suvidit he ki dhatvik chaalkon kii pratirohakata unka taap ghataane par ghatati jaati he
 But in normal conductors such as copper and silver etc
, the impurities and other imperfections do not decrease the resistivity after a limit
 yahan tak ki tanba param shunya taap par bhi ashoonya pratirohakata pradarshit karata he
 In contrast, when the temperature of the superconducting material is reduced below the critical temperature, its resistivity rapidly decreases to zero
 atichaalak taar se bane hue kisi band paripath kii vidyut dhara kisi vidyut strot ke bina sadaa ke liye sthir rah sakati he
 Superconductivity is a quantum-mechanical view
 atichaalak padaarth chumbakeey parilakshan kaa bhi prabhaav pradarshit karte hai
 They all have zero electric force and the Tomson-coefficient is equal
 sankraman taap par inaki vishisht ushma main bhi aksmaat parivartan ho jaataa he
 It is particularly noteworthy that the atoms that have 5 or 7 external electrons have the highest transition heat and the properties of superconductivity are also excellent
 1) bahut adhik chumbakeey kshetra tivrata vaale chumbak banane ke liye atichaalak taron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 These are called superconducting magnets
 inkaa upyog kan twarakon main hota he
 2) In future they can be used in making smaller and more efficient transformers, motors, electric generators, etc
 3) atichaalkon kaa upyog squid inkaa upyog urja ke bhandaran ke liye kiya ja sakegaa kyonki kisi atichaalak loop main ek baar dhara sthapit karke chhod dene par vah anant kaal tak chalati rahegi
 5) It can be used in magnetic lavitation
 6) inke atirikt atichaalak transmishan line, vidyutchumbak, radio-aavriti cavity, atichaalak transistor, atichaalak electron-punj lens, atichaalak bearing, bolometre, aadi main bhi atichaalakata kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 When a metal is taken in a suitable shape, such as a cylinder or wire, it must produce some resistance to the flow of electricity
 kintu sarvapratham san 1911 main keserling ones ne ek sansaneepurn khoj kii ki yadi paare ko 4 degree ke neeche thandha kar diya jaae to uskaa vidyutiya pratirodh aksmaat nasht hokar vah purna suchalak ban jaataa he
 This property is found in about 20 metals, including ranga, mercury, lead, etc
 jis taap ke neeche yah dasha praapt hoti he us taap ko sankraman taap kehete hai or is dasha kii chaalakata ko atichaalakata
 Transition temperatures are not only different for different metals, but also different for different isotopes of the same metal
 paladium antimony jaise kai mishra dhaatuon main bhi atichaalakata gun paaya jaataa he
 The electrons in the atom revolve in the elliptical path and in this view they act like magnets
 bahari chumbakeey kshetra se in chumbakon kaa aghurna kam ho jaataa he
 In other words, atoms show heterogeneous magnetic effects
 yadi taap tas kisi padaarth ko upyukt chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae to us suchalak kaa aantarik chumbakeey kshetra nasht ho jaataa he, arthath vah ek visham chumbakeey padaarth jaisaa kaary karne lagata he
 Due to the currents flowing on the surface, the value of the internal field remains zero
 ise mikenor kaa prabhaav kehete hai
 If the superconducting material is placed in a slowly increasing magnetic field, then at a particular value of the field, called the sill value, its resistance again becomes equal to its former value
 atichaalakata ke siddhant ko samajhane ke liye kai suzav die gaye hai
 But most of them have had only partial success
 vartmaan kaal main bardin, kupar tathaa shrifer dwaara diya gaya siddhant paryaapt santoshprad he
 Its abbreviation V
C
S
 Is the principle
 iske anusaar atichaalakata chaalak electronon ke yugman se utpann hoti he
 This coupling is caused by the attractive force between the electrons

 But knowing that Mansingh had not given permission to loot the city of Chittorgarh, Emperor Akbar was very angry at them and even banned their arrival in the court for some time
 james tod ke shabdon main- "jin dinon main akbar bhayanak rup se biimaar ho kar apane marane kii ashanka kar rahaa tha, maansingh khusro ko mogul singhaasana par bithaane ke liye shadyantron kaa jaal bicha diya tha

 This class originated from the interaction of British immigrants and Indian women in India which is called Anglo Indian
 inaki sankhya kaaphi he or loksabhaa main inke vishesh pratinidhi ke liye sanvaidhanik adhikaar bhi surakshit hai
 The wise men of this community consider themselves as Indians and in the grief of India, but most of the time they are unable to make close contact with the local public and expect the help of England

 In the context of business and organization, management means - to coordinate the work of people by utilizing the available resources efficiently and effectively so as to ensure the achievement of goals
 prabandhan ke antargat aayojan, sanghathan-nirmaan, staffing, netritv karnaa, tathaa sanghathan athwa pahal kaa niyantran karnaa aadi aate hai
 Regardless of whether the organization is large or small, for profit or non-profit, providing services or manufacturing, management is essential for everyone
 prabandh isliye aavashyak he ki vyakti samuhik uddeshyon kii purti main apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Management involves mutually related tasks that all managers perform
 prabandhak alag-alag kaaryon par bhinn samay lagaate hai
 Managers at the higher levels of the organization spend more time on planning and organization than managers at the bottom
 kai lekhakon ne prabandh kii paribhaasha di he
 The word manga is a plural term widely used for all kinds of verbs
 vaise yah kisi bhi udhyam kii vibhinn kriyaaon ke liye mukhya rup se prayukt hua he
 From the above example and the study of the situation, it must have become clear that management is the action which is necessary in every organization in which people are working as a group
 sanghathan main log alag-alag prakaar ke kaary karte hai lekin vah abhi samaan uddeshy ko paane ke liye kaary karte hai
 Management provides direction in people's efforts and achieving the same objective
 is prakaar se prabandh yah dekhtaa he ki kaary puure hon evam lakshya praapt kiye jaaen kam-se-kam saadhan evam nunatam laagat par ho
 Hence, management can be defined as the process of completing tasks with the aim of achieving the objectives effectively and efficiently
 hame is paribhaasha ke vishleshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are some words that need to be described in detail
 ye shabd hai- The process used in the definition refers to the primary task or actions that the management performs to complete the tasks
 ye kaary hai- niyojan, sanghathan, niyuktikaran, nirdesan evam niyantran jin par charchaa is adhyay main evam pustak main aage kii jaaegi
 Effective or actually doing the job effectively means actually completing the given task
 prabhavi prabandh kaa sambandh sahi kaary ko karne, kriyaaon ko puraa karne evam uddeshyon ko praapt karne se he
 In other words, its function is to get the final result
 lekin maatr kaary ko sampann karnaa hi paryaapt nahin he iskaa ek or pahalu bhi he or vah he kaarykushalta arthath kaary ko kushaltapurvak karnaa
 Efficiency means doing the job correctly at minimum cost
 isamen ek prakaar kaa laagat-laabh vishleshan evam aagat tathaa nirgat ke bich sambandh hota he
 If we gain more by using less means then we will say that there is an increase in capacity
 kshamta main vruddhi hogi yadi usee laabh ke liye athwa nirgat ke liye kam sadhano kaa upyog kiya jaataa he evam kam laagat vyay kii jaati he
 Input means are those which have the money, goods, equipment and human resources required to do a particular task
 swabhaavik he ki prabandh kaa sambandh in sansadhano ke kushal prayog se he kyonki inase laagat kam hoti he evam ant main inase laabh main vruddhi hoti he
 These two words are related to each other despite being different
 prabandh ke liye prabhavi evam kshamtawan donon kaa hona mahatvapurn he
 Both effectiveness and skill are two sides of the same coin
 lekin in donon pakshon main santulan aavashyak he tathaa kabhi-kabhi prabandh ko kushalta se samjhauta karnaa hota he
 For example it is easy to be effective and ignore efficiency which means completing the work but at a high cost
 udhaaharan ke liye, mana ek company kaa lakshya varsh main 8,000 ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karnaa he
 To achieve this goal most of the time, the manager was not effective when the electricity was not available, but not efficient because more inputs were used for the same output
 kabhi-kabhi vyavsaay kam sansadhano se maal ke utpaadan par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata he arthath laagat to kam kar di lekin nirdhaarit utpaadan nahin kar paae
 As a result, the goods could not reach the market, hence its demand was reduced and it was replaced by the competitors
 yah kaarykushalta lekin prabhaavapurntaa kii kami kii sthiti he kyonki maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya
 Therefore, it is more important for the manager to achieve the goals at the lowest cost
 iske liye prabhaavapurntaa evam kushalta main santulan rakhana hota he
 Generally high work efficiency is accompanied by high effectiveness which is the goal of all managers
 lekin bagaiyr prabhaavapurntaa ke ucch kaary kushalta par anaavashyak rup se jor dena bhi avaanchhneeya he
 Weak management is due to lack of both effectiveness and efficiency
 kuch paribhaashaon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat hamen kuch tatwon kaa pataa lagata he jinhen ham prabandh kii aadharbhoot visheshtaayen kehete hai
 Management serves to fulfill certain objectives
 uddeshy kisi bhi kriya ke apekshit parinaam hote hai
 These should be derived from the basic purpose of the business
 kisi bhi sanghathan ke bhinn-bhinn uddeshy hote hai tathaa prabandh ko in sabhi uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se paanaa hota he
 Objectives can be classified into organizational objectives, social objectives and personal objectives
 prabandh, sanghathan ke liye uddeshyon ke nirdhaaran evam unako puraa karne ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 It has to achieve many types of objectives in all fields and keep in mind the interests of all the stakeholders like shareholders, employees, customers, government etc

 For this the organization should earn enough money to meet the costs
 vyavsaay ke liye iskaa bane rahanaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Management has to ensure that the organization makes a profit

 For this, the growth of business is very important
 udyog main bane rahane ke liye prabandh ko sanghathan vikaas kii sambhaavna kaa puraa laabh uthaanaa chahie
 Business growth can be measured as sales turnover, increase in the number of employees or increase in the number of products or investment of capital, etc
 samaaj ke liye laabhon kii rachana karnaa he
 Whether the organization is a business or a non-business, it has to fulfill some social obligations as it is a part of the society
 iskaa arth he samaaj ke vibhinn angon ke liye anukool aarthik mulyon kii rachana karnaa
 This includes adopting a different environment of production, providing employment opportunities to the deprived sections of the society and providing facilities like school, baby house for the employees
 aage box main ek nigamit saamaajik daayitv ko puraa karne vaale sanghathan kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he
 The organization consists of people from whom their personality, background, experience and purpose are different
 ye sabhi apni vividh aavashyaktaaon ko santushti hetu sanghathan kaa ang banate hai
 These vary from financial requirements such as competitive salaries and other benefits to social needs such as peer recognition and higher level needs such as personal growth and development
 prabandh ko sanghathan main talmail ke liye vyaktigat uddeshyon kaa sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon ke saath milan karnaa hota he

 ab ham un kuch kaarnon kaa adhyayan karenge jiske kaaran prabandh itnaa mahatvapurn ho gaya he- Management is as old as civilization
 yadhyapi aadhunik sanghathan kaa udgam nayaa hi he lekin sangathit kaary to sabhyataa ke pracheen samay se hi hote rahe hai
 In fact the organization can be considered as the distinguishing feature that distinguishes civilized society from uncivilized society
 prabandh ke prarambh ke vyavhaar ve niyam evam kanoon the jo sarkari evam vanijyik kriyaaon ke anubhav se panape
 Principles and practices of management developed with the development of trade and commerce respectively
 ‘prabandh’ shabd aaj kai arthon main prayukt hota he jo isaki prakruti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko ujagar karte hai
 The study of management has developed along with modern organizations in the past
 yah prabandhakon ke anubhav evam aacharan tathaa siddhanton ke sambadh samooh donon par aadhaarit rahaa he
 In the past, it has developed into a dynamic subject
 jisaki apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai
 But it is necessary to answer a question related to the nature of management whether management is science or art or both
 To answer this, let us study the characteristics of both science and art and see how far the management fulfills them
 kala kya he? kala icchit parinaamon ko paane ke liye vartmaan gyaan kaa vyaktigat evam dakshatapurna upyog he
 It can be obtained through study, observation and experience
 ab kyonki kala kaa sambandh gyaan ke vyaktigat upyog se he isliye adhyayan kiye gaye moolbhoot siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laane ke liye ek prakaar kii moulikta evam rachanaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The basic characteristics of art are as follows- kala yah maanakar chalati he ki kuch saidhantik gyaan pehle se he
 Experts in their respective fields have proposed some basic principles that are used in a particular type of art
 udhaaharan ke liye nrity, jan sambodhan / bhaashan, kala athwa sangeet par sahitya sarvamaanya he
 Use of this basic knowledge varies from person to person
 kala, isiilie atyant vyaktigat avadharana he
 For example, two dancers, two speakers, two artists or two writers will differ in the performance of their art
 sabhi kala vyavhaarik hoti hai
 Art is the creative use of knowledge to current principles
 ham jaanate hai ki sangeet saat suron par aadhaarit he
 But the music composition of a musician is unique or different, it depends on how these notes are used in music creation, which is its own interpretation
 prabandh ek kala he kyonki, yah nimna visheshtaon ko puraa karti he- a manager is a hierarchical knowledge group that clarifies any general truths or general principles
 The basic characteristics of science are as follows: vigyaan, gyaan kaa krambaddh samooh he
 Its principles are based on the relation between cause and consequence
 udhaaharan ke liye, ped se seb kaa tuutakar prithvi par aane kii ghatana gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ko janm detii he
 Scientific theories are first developed through observation and then tested and tested under controlled conditions repeatedly
 vaigyanik siddhant, vaidhata evam upyog ke liye saarvbhaumik hote hai
 On the basis of the above characteristics, we can say that as a management science, it has certain characteristics- sabhi prakaar kii sanghathan prakriyaaon kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 You must also have observed that organizations require certain qualifications and experience to manage them
 aapane yah bhi paaya hoga ki ek ore to vyavsaay nigamit swaroop main vruddhi hui he to duusari ore vyavsaay ke prabandh par adhik jor diya ja rahaa he
 Does this mean that management is a profession? To know the answer to this question, let us study the salient features of the profession and see if the management fulfills them
 peshey kii nimna visheshtaayen hai All professions are based on a well-defined set of knowledge that can be acquired through education
 peshey main pravesh, pariksha athwa shaikshanik yogyata ke dwaara simit hoti he
 For example, in India, if one wants to become a Chartered Accountant, one has to pass a special examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
 sabhi peshey kisi na kisi parishad sabha se jude hote hai jo inamen pravesh kaa niyaman karte hai kaary karne ke liye pramaan patr jari karte hai evam aadhaar samhita taiyaar karte hai tathaa usko lagu karte hai
 To advocate in India, lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their actions
 sabhi peshey aachaar samhita se bandhe hai jo unke sadasyon ke vyavhaar ko disha dete hai
 For example, when doctors enter their profession, they take an oath of their work ethic
 peshey kaa mul uddeshy nishtha evam patibaddhta he tathaa apane graahakon ke hiton kii sadhana he
 a lawyer ensures that his client gets justice
 prabandh, peshey ke siddhanton ko puri tarah se puraa nahin karata he
 Well it has some characteristics which are as follows- prabandh ek saarvbhaumik shabd he jise, kisi udhyam main sambandhon ke samooh main ek duusare se jude logon dwaara kuch kaaryon ko karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Everyone has the responsibility to complete a particular task in this chain of relationships
 is uttardaayitv ko puraa karne ke liye use kuch adhikaar die jate hai arthath nirnay lene kaa adhikaar
 This relationship of authority and responsibility binds individuals to each other as officers and subordinates
 isse sanghathan main vibhinn staron kaa nirmaan hota he
 There are three levels in the authority chain of an organization- ucch stareey prabandh-yah sanghathan ke varishthatam kaaryakari adhikari hote hai jinhen kai naamon se pukaara jaataa he
 It is commonly known as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Head, Deputy Principal etc
 ucch prabandh, vibhinn kaaryaatmak str ke prabandhakon kii team hoti he
 Their basic task is to keep the overall objectives of the organization in mind, to unify the various elements and harmonize the work of different departments
 ucch str ke ye prabandhak sanghathan ke kalyaan evam nirantarata ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 They analyze the environment of the business and its impact for the life of the firm
 ye apni uplabdhi ke nae sanghathan ke lakshya evam vyuh-rachana ko taiyaar karte hai
 They are responsible for all the functions of business and their impact on society
 ucch prabandh kaa kaary jatil evam tanaavpurn hota he
 It takes a long time, so full commitment to the organization is required
 madhya stareey prabandh- ye ucch prabandhakon evam neeche str ke bich kii kadi hote hai, ye ucch prabandhakon ke adhinsth evam pratham rekhiy prabandhakon ke pradhan hote hai
 They are commonly called department heads, operations managers or plant superintendents
 madhya stareey prabandhak, ucch prabandh dwaara viksit niyantran yojanaayen evam vyuh-rachana ke kriyanvayan ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 In addition, they are responsible for all the functions of first-line managers
 inkaa mukhya kaary ucch stareey prabandhakon dwaara taiyaar yojanaon ko puraa karnaa hota he
 For this paryvekshiya athwa prachaalan prabandhak- sanghathan kii adhikaar pankti main forman evam paryvekshak nimna str par aate hai
 Supervisors directly observe the work of the workforce
 inke adhikaar evam karttavya ucch prabandhakon dwaara banaai gai yojanaon dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 Supervision, managers have an important role in the organization as they communicate directly with the actual work force and communicate the guidelines of middle level managers to the employees
 inhen ke prayatnon se utpaada kii gunvattta ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he, maal kii haani ko nunatam rakhaa jaataa he evam suraksha ke str banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 The quality of workmanship, and mere production, depends on the hard work, discipline and loyalty of the employees
 prabandh ko sanghathan se sadasyon se kaaryon ke niyojan, sanghathan, nideshan evam niyantran evam nirdhaarit uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sanghathan ke sansadhano ke prayog kii prakriya mana gaya he
 It is already the task of determining what to do, how and who to do
 iskaa arth he uddeshyon ko pehle se hi nishchit karnaa evam dakshata se evam prabhavi dhang se praapt karne ke liye maarg nirdhaarit karnaa
 The purpose of Suhasini's organization is to buy and sell traditional Indian handloom and handicrafts items
 vah bune hue vastra, sajaavat kaa saamaan, paramparaagat bhartiya kapade se taiyaar vastra evam gharelu saamaan ko bechate hai
 Suhasini takes a decision regarding their quantity, color and texture, then allocates resources from different suppliers for their purchase or preparation in their home
 niyojan samasyao ke paidaa hone se koi roak nahin saktaa lekin inkaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yah jab bhi paidaa hote hai to inako hal karne ke liye aakasmik yojanaayen bana sakati hai
 It manages the task of assigning tasks, dividing tasks into groups, assigning rights and allocation of resources for the implementation of the prescribed plan
 ek baar sanghathan ke uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye vishisht yojana taiyaar kar lee jaati he to phir sanghathan yojana ke kriyanvayan ke liye aavashyak kriyaaon evam sansadhano kii jaanch karegaa
 This will determine the necessary tasks and resources
 yah nirnay letaa he ki kis kaary ko koun karegaa, inhen kahan kiya jayega tathaa kab kiya jayega
 Necessary tasks in the organization are divided into the departments and work units capable of management and the relationship of giving rights and details in the authority chain of the organization is determined
 sanghathan ke uchit takanic kaary ke puraa karne evam prachaalan kii kaary kshamta evam parinaamon kii prabhaav purnataa ke sanvardhan main sahaayta karte hai
 Different types of businesses require different frameworks according to the nature of work
 iske sambandh main aap aage ke adhyyon main or adhik padhenge
 In simple terms it means finding the right person for the right job
 prabandh kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye sahi yogyata vaale sahi vyaktiyon ko, sahi sthaan evam samay par uplabdh karaane ko sunishchit karnaa he
 It is also called human resource work and includes recruitment, selection, appointment and training of employees
 infosis technology, jo sofratware viksit karti he, ko pranali vishleshankartta evam kaarykram taiyaar karne vaale vyaktiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jabaki labmart ko dizinkartta evam shilpakaaron ke team kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The task of directing is to provide leadership, influence and motivation to the employees so that they can complete the assigned work
 iske liye ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jo karmchaariyon ko sarvshereshth dhang se kaary karne ke liye prerit kare
 There are two basic elements of motivation and leadership
 karmchaariyon ko abhiprerit karne kaa arth keval ek aisa vaataavaran taiyaar karnaa he jo unhen kaary ke liye prerit kare
 Leadership means influencing others in such a way that they perform the desired tasks of their leader
 ek acha prabandhak prashansa evam aalochana kii sahaayta se is prakaar se nirdesan karata he ki karmchaaree apana shreshthatam yogadan de saken
 Suhasini's team of designers developed ravishing colors on silk for bed sheets
 yadhyapi yah bahut lubhaavne lagate the lekin silk ke prayog ke kaaran aam aadmi ke liye yah bahut adhik mahange the
 Praising her work, Suhasini suggested that she keep these silk sheets for special occasions like Deepawali, Christmas and print them regularly on cotton clothes
 niyantran ko prabandh ke kaary ke us rup main paribhaashit kiya he jisamen vah sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sanghathan kaary ke nishpaadan ko nirdeshit karata he
 Levels of execution are determined in the control function, the current performance is measured
 iskaa purvanirdhaarit staron se milan kiya jaataa he or vichlan kii sthiti main sudharatmak kadam uthaae jate hai
 For this, managers have to determine what work and production are important for success, how and where it can be measured and who is authorized to take corrective steps
 suhasini ne jab paaya ki uske dizinkartaaon kii team ne palang kii vah chadar banaai jo unki vikray ke liye nishchit mulya se adhik mahangi thi tab usne laagat par niyantran ke liye chadar hetu kapadaa hi badal diya
 The various functions of the manager are usually discussed in the above order according to which a manager prepares the plan first; Then creates organization; Thereafter directs; And finally controls
 vastav main prabandhak shaayad hi in kaaryon ko ek-ek karke karata he
 The tasks of the manager are related to each other and it becomes difficult to determine which work ended where and which work started from where
 kisi sanghathan ke prabandhan kii prakriya main ek prabandhak ko paanch ek duusare se sambandhit kaary karne hote hai
 Organization is a system that is made up of interconnected and interconnected subsets
 prabandhak ko in bhinn samoohon ko samaan uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye ek duusare se jodna hota he
 The process of monotony of activities of different departments is called coordination
 samanvay vah shakti he jo, prabandh ke anya sabhi kaaryon ko ek duusare se baandhti he
 It is a thread that threads all functions such as purchasing, production, sales and finance to maintain consistency in the work of the organization
 samanvay ko kabhi-kabhi prabandh kaa ek alag se kaary mana jaataa he
 But it is the essence of management because it brings unity in individual efforts to achieve collective goals
 prayek prabandhkeey kaary ek aisi gatividhi he jo swayan akeli samanvay main sahyog karti he
 Coordination is targeted and embedded in all the functions of any organization
 sanghathan kii kriyaaon ke samanvay kii prakriya, niyojan se hi prarambh ho jaati he
 Higher management plans for the entire organization
 in yojanaon ke anusaar sanghathan dhaanchon ko viksit kiya jaataa he evam karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 Implementation of schemes is required according to plan to ensure that guidance is required
 vaastavik kriyaaon evam unki uplabdhiyon main yadi koi matbhed he to iskaa niraakaran niyantran ke samay kiya jaataa he
 Through the process of co-ordination, the management makes proper arrangements for individual and collective efforts to ensure unity in the steps taken to achieve the same objectives, the co-ordination will unify the different functions and efforts of different units of the organization
 is
 yah prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa raashi, maatr, samay evam krambaddhata uplabdh karaata he jo niojit uddeshyon ko nunatam virodhabhas, praapt karne ko sunishchit karata he
 The following characteristics of coordination are clear from the above definitions- samanvay samuhik kaaryon main ekaatmakataa laata he- samanvay aise hiton ko jo ek duusare se sambandhit nahin hai yaa ek duusare se bhinn hai uddeshy purna kaary gatividhi main ekta laata he
 It provides a focal point to the group's actions, which ensures that the execution is in accordance with the plan and schedule
 samanvay kaarywahi main ekta laata he- samanvay kaa uddeshy samaan uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kaarywahi main ekta laana he
 It serves as the power to connect various departments and ensures that all actions are taken to achieve the goals of the organization
 aapane paaya ki labmart ke utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ko apane kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he jisase ki bazaar kii maang ke anusaar utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Coordination is a continuous process - Coordination is not a one-time function but a continuous process
 yah niyojan se prarambh hota he evam niyantran tak chalati he
 Suhasini makes a plan regarding clothes for winter time in the month of June itself
 tatpashchaat vah paryaapt kaarybal kii vyavastha karti he
 According to the production plan, it is constantly monitored for this, it will have to tell its marketing department in time to prepare for the promotion of sales promotion and advertising
 samanvay sarvyaapee kaary he- vibhinn vibhaagon kii kriyaayein prakruti se ek duusare par nirbhar karti hai isiilie samanvay kii aavashyaktaa prabandh ke sabhi staron par hoti he
 It establishes unity in various departments and functions at different levels
 sanghathan ke uddeshy bana virodh aa sake, praapt karne ke liye suhasini ko kray, utpaadan evam vikray vibhaagon ke kaaryon main samanvay karnaa hota he
 The task of purchasing department is to buy cloth
 yah utpaadan vibhaag kii kriyaaon ke liye aadhaar ban jaataa he or ant main vikray sambhav ho paata he
 If the fabric is of inferior quality or does not have the specifications prescribed by the production department, then further sales will be reduced
 yadi samanvay nahin he to kriyaaon main ekta evam ekikaran ke sthaan par punrariti evam avyavashtha hogi
 Coordination is the responsibility of all managers - coordination is the task of every manager in any organization
 Higher level managers coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the organization's policies are implemented
 madhyastar ke prabandhak, ucchstar ke prabandhakon evam pratham pankti ke prabandhakon, donon ke saath samanvay karte hai
 Operations level managers coordinate the tasks of their employees to ensure that the work is done according to plans
 samanvay sochaa-samajha kaary he- ek prabandhak ko vibhinn logon ke kaaryon kaa dhyanpurvak evam soch samajhakar samanvay karnaa hota he
 In a department, members work voluntarily in cooperation with each other, coordination coordinates this spirit of cooperation
 samanvay ke na hone par sahyog bhi nirarthak siddh hoga or bina sahyog ke samanvay karmchaariyon main asantosh ko hi janm degaa
 Therefore we can say that coordination is not a separate function of management but it is its essence
 yadi koi sanghathan apane uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam kushalta se praapt karnaa chahta he to use samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Coordination is an integral part of all the functions of coordination in the same way as the thread in the rosary
 vibhinn prabandhkeey kaaryon ko ekikrut karnaa vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon main paryaapt maatr main samanvay ko sunishchit karata he
 As such, the constant change inherent in a large-scale organization due to coordination problems is weak or passive leadership and complexities
 bade sanghathanon main is prakaar kii jatiltaaon ke samanvay ke liye vishesh prayatnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Size of organization - Large number of people engaged in large organizations complicate the problem of coordination
 prayek vyakti apane aap main vishisht he
 And realizes the needs of himself and the organization
 prayek kii apni kaary karne kii aadaten hai, apni prishthbhumi hai, paristhitiyon se nipatane ke prastaav / tareeke hai tathaa dusron se sambandh hai
 By the way, a single person does not always act wisely
 uske vyavhaar ko na to sadaa thik se samajha jaataa he or na hi puri tarah se uskaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, for the efficiency of the organization, it is essential that the objectives of the individual and the group are integrated by coordination
 kaaryaatmak vibhedikaran- sanghathan ke kaaryon ko baar-baar vibhaagon, prabhaagon, virgon aadi main baanta jaataa he
 The problem of coordination arises because the jurisdiction becomes stronger and the barriers between them become even stronger
 kai baar yah isliye hota he kyonki kaaryon kaa vargeekaran yukti sangat nahin hota yaa phir prabandhak tark sangat maarg na apana kar anubhav kaa maarg apanaate hai
 In such cases, coordination is necessary to function effectively in the organization
 vishishtikaran- aadhunik sanghathanon main ucch str kaa vishishtikaran he
 Specialization is born due to the intricacies and functions of modern technologies and the diversity of those who do them
 visheshgy sochate hai ki ve ek duusare ko peshey ke aadhaar par jaanchne ke yogya hai lekin duusare logon ke paas is prakaar ke nirnay kaa koi paryaapt aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 If experts are allowed to work without coordination in front of a global manager, the results will be very expensive
 isiilie sanghathan main lage vibhinn visheshgyon ke kaaryon main samanvay hetu ek rachana tantra kii aavashyaktaa he
 Coordination is the essence of management
 yah kuch aisa nahin he taki jiske liye ek prabandhak aadesh de
 Rather it is something that a manager tries to achieve by planning, organizing, appointing, directing control tasks
 atah prayek kaary samanvay kaa abhyaas he
 Organization and their management is changing
 jaise-jaise vibhinn samskritiyon evam deshon kii seemayen dhundhlee pad rahi hai evam sampreshan kii nayi-nayi takneekon ke kaaran vishwa ko ek vaishvik gaanv samajha ja saktaa he
 International and intercultural relations are also growing rapidly
 aaj kaa sanghathan ek vaishvik sanghathan he jiskaa prabandh bhumandaleey paridrishy main kiya jaataa he
 In summary, one can say that a global manager is one who has both 'hard' and 'soft' skills
 jo prabandhak vishleshan karnaa, vyuharachna karnaa, ejineering evam praudyogiki kaa gyaan rakhte hai unki aaj bhi aavashyaktaa he lekin vishwavyaapee safalataa ke liye vyaktiyon main team kaise kaary karti he, sanghathan kaise kaary karte hai evam logon ko kis prakaar se abhiprerit kar saktaa he, is sabaki samaj kaa hona bahut aavashyak he
 For example, a manager who has access to different cultures can work in Western Europe, a non-english speaking country, then move to developing countries like Malaysia or Kenya and then to an office in New York, USA
 Can be transferred
 vah in teenon sthanon par turant prabhavi dhang se kaary kar sakegaa
 The role of global manager has evolved in the same way that global industry and economy have developed
 yah ek paribhaashit vyavsaay ke sandarbh main ek aiami bhoomika se bahuaiami bhoomika main parivartit ho gaya he jiske liye takneekee kaushal, sofrat prabandh evam kaushal evam vibhinn samskritiyon ko grahan karnaa evam seekhney ke sammishran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 Their special importance is described in the Puranas
 bhagwaan kaa pratham avatar sanakaadi 4 muni hai
 Those Gods who are real, they created the egg of 24 elements for the purpose
 us and se hi ve paramatma saakaar rup main baahar nikle
 He created water and slept in the same water for thousands of divine years, so his name was Narayan
 unhen jab bahu hone kii ichha hui tab ve uthe tathaa and ke adhibhoot, aadhyatm tathaa adhidaiv ye teen khand kiye
 The senses, mind and body power arose from those divine heavens
 saath hi sutara, mahan tathaa asu naamak teen praan bhi utpann hue
 Due to his desire to eat, the egg came out of its mouth, which was filled with Varuna and the theme
 isi prakaar bolne kii ichha ke kaaran vaak indriya hui jiske dev agni tathaa bhaashan vishay hua
 In the same way nasal, eye, ear, skin, tax, foot etc
 came out
 yah paramatma kaa saakaar sthool rup he jinka naman veda purush sookt se kiye hai
 During the Holocaust, God was sleeping on Shesha
 ve aadimadhyantahinay nirgunay gunatmane hai atah shesh jo sabake baad bhi rahete hai vahi unki shaiya hai
 When he opened his eyes with the desire of creation, he saw that the whole world is absorbed in him
 tabhi rajogun se prerit paramatma kii naabhi se camel ankurit ho gaya jisase sampoorn jal prakashmay ho gaya
 Brahma originating from the Nuclear system was inhabited by Pankajakarnika
 brahma ji ne soncha ki main koun, kyon hoon tathaa mere janak koun hai? ve kamalnal ke sahare jal main pravisht hue tathaa saun varsh tak nirantar khoj karne par bhi koi praapt nahin hua
 In the end, he sat again in the same place 
 vahaan hajaaron varshon tak samadhisth rahe
 Then he saw the Purushottam God
 sheshnag main shayan kar rahe prabhu kaa neelmani ke samaan deh anek aabhushanon se aachhadit tha tathaa van maala or kaustubh mani swayan ko bhagyavan maan rahe the
 In them, Brahma Ji also saw himself sitting on the bottomless ocean and lotus
 brahma ji bhagwaan kii stuti karte hai - "I was unknown to you since time immemorial, you have seen me today
 maine aapako jaanane kaa prayaas nahin kiya, yahi ham sab kaa sabase bada dosha he kyonki samast brahmand main aap hi jaanane yogya hai
 For the welfare of your immediate creatures, you took a virtuous form from which i was born
 nirgun bhi isse bhinn nahin
 "lord said" i am happy with you, go create
 pralay se jo praja mujhamen leen ho gai uski punah utpatti karo
 "and God became impregnated
 brahma ji ne sau varshon tak tapasya kii
 At that time, both water and lotus were stirred by the Holocaust air
 brahma ji ne tap kii shakti se us vaayu ko jal sahit pi liya
 Then fourteen worlds were created from the lotus in the sky
 ishwar kaal ke dwaara hi sristi kiya karte hai atah kaal kii sristi das prakaar kii hoti he - Brahma Ji did not get satisfaction from these creation, then he meditated on Narayana in his mind was the tenth creation of Sunkadi munis who were only Gods
 ye sanakaadi chaar sanat, sanandan, sanathan, sanatkumar naamak maharishi hai tathaa inaki aayu sadaiv paanch varsh kii rahati he
 Brahma ji told those children that son, go and create
 sanakaadi muniyon nen brahma ji se kaha "pitashri! kshamaa karen
 This maya is indirect for us, we do not believe in anything greater than the worship of God, so we will go and do devotion to Him
 " or sanakaadi muni vahaan se chal pade
 They go where the hymn of God is
 naarad ji ko inhone bhagwat sunaaya tha tathaa ye swayan bhagwaan shesh se bhagwat shravan kiye the
 The younger they look, the more Vidyakanj are
 ye chaaro vedon ke hi rup kahe ja sakate hai
 Like all the deities, Sanakadi Rishi was also a deity, such as cynicism, sunanda curse, eternal respect and Santkumar was the god of penance
 chaaro ke paas bhi vaahan the jaise- sanak kaa vaahan chil, sanandan kaa vaahan giddh, sanathan kaa vaahan bulbul tathaa sanatkumar kaa vaahan chidiya thi
 At one time all four Sunkadi Kumar reached Vaikunth to see Lord Vishnu
 ve vahaan ke saundarya ko dekhakar bade prasann hue
 There were pillars of crystal gem, many stones were studded on the ground too
 bhagwaan ke sabhi parshad nand, sugandh sahit vaikuntha ke pati kaa sadaiv gungan kiya karte hai
 As soon as the four sages climbed the six deities and climbed the seventh deodor, they saw two great gatekeepers, Jai and Vijay
 kumaar jaise hi aage bade donon dwarapalon ne muniyon ko dhruaapurvak roak diya
 Although they were not preventable, the Sunkadi monks who were always calm got angry with the Bhagavad desire
 ve dwarapalon se bole "are! bada aashcharya he
 Didn't your odd nature end despite being a resident of Vaikunth? You people are like snakes
 tum yahan rahane yogya nahin atah tum neeche lok main jaao
 You fall down " isapar dono dwarpal muniyon ke charnon par gir pade
 Then God came
 muniyon nen bhagwaan ko pranaam kiya
 Sri Bhagavan says "O Brahman! Brahmins are always adorable to me

 Amarnath is a major pilgrimage center for Hindus
 yah kashmir rajya ke srinagar shahar ke uttar-purv main 135 sahastrameter dur samudratal se 13,600 foot kii oonchaai par sthit he
 The length of this cave is 19 meters and width is 16 meters
 gupha 11 meter unchi he
 The Amarnath cave is one of the major shrines of Lord Shiva
 amarnath ko tirthon kaa tirth kaha jaataa he kyon ki yaheen par bhagwaan shiv ne maan parvati ko amartv kaa rahasy bataaya tha
 The main feature of this place is the formation of natural Shivling in the cave in the snow
 prakritik him se nirmit hone ke kaaran ise swayambhu himani shivlinga bhi kehete hai
 Starting from Ashada Purnima till Rakshabandhan, lakhs of people come here for the holy Himling Darshan to be held throughout the month of Sawan
 gupha kii paridhi lagbhag dedh sau foot he or isamen upar se barf ke pani kii boonden jagah-jagah tapakati rahati hai
 There is a place here, in which a ten feet long Shivling is formed by dripping snow droplets
 chandramaa ke ghatane-badhane ke saath-saath is barf kaa aakaar bhi ghatata-badhata rahata he
 On Shravan Purnima it comes in its full size and gradually becomes smaller till Amavasya
 aashcharya kii baat yahi he ki yah shivlinga thos barf kaa bana hota he, jabaki gupha main aamtaur par kachi barf hi hoti he jo haath main lete hi bhurabhura jaae
 Ganesh, Bhairav and Parvati have similar icebergs several feet away from the original Amarnath Shivling
 janashruti prachlit he ki isi gupha main mata parvati ko bhagwaan shiv ne amarkatha sunai thi, jise sunakar sadyojaat shuk-shishu shukdev rishi ke rup main amar ho gayi the
 Even today, a pair of pigeons are seen in the cave, which the devotees call immortal birds
 ve bhi amarkatha sunakar amar hue hai
 There is also a belief that Shiva Parvati, who sees devotees who are associated with pigeons, provides salvation to that creature by taking a direct view of their visions
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne adrdhagini parvati ko is gupha main ek aisi katha sunai thi, jisamen amarnath kii yatra or uske maarg main aane vaale anek sthalon kaa varnan tha
 This story later became known as Amarkatha
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bhagwaan shankar jab parvati ko amar katha sunaane le ja rahe the, to unhone chote-chote anant naagon ko anantnag main choda, maathe ke chandan ko chandanbari main utaara, anya pissuon ko pissu top par or gale ke sheshnag ko sheshnag naamak sthal par choda tha
 All these places still visit the Amarnath Yatra
 amarnath gupha kaa sabase pehle pataa solahavin shatabdi ke purvaadh main ek musalmaan gaderiye ko chalaa tha
 Even today a fourth offering is made to the descendants of that Muslim shepherd
 aashcharya kii baat yah he ki amarnath gupha ek nahin he
 While proceeding on the path of the river Amravati, many other small and large caves are seen
 ve sabhi barf se dhaki hai
 There are two ways to go on Amar Nath Yatra
 ek pahalgam hokar or doosraa sonmarg baltaal se
 That is, to reach Pahalman and Baltal by any ride, you have to use your feet to go further from here
 ashakt yaa vridhon ke liye savaariyon kaa prabandh kiya ja saktaa he
 The route from Pahalgam is considered to be simple and convenient
 baltaal se amarnath gupha kii duuri keval 14 kilometre he or yah bahut hi durgam rasta he or suraksha kii drushti se bhi sandigdh he
 That is why the government does not consider this route safe and motivates most of the travelers to go to Amarnath via Pahalgam
 lekin romaanch or jokhim lene kaa shauk rakhane vaale log is maarg se yatra karnaa pasand karte hai
 People traveling through this route travel at their own risk
 raste main kisi anhoni ke liye bharat sarkaar jimmedaari nahin leti he
 Pahalgam is 315 km from Jammu
 yah vikhyath paryaton sthal bhi he or yahan kaa naiysargik saundarya dekhte hi banataa he

 The climb of the Pisu Valley begins on the second day

 This journey of the first phase along the banks of the river Lidder is not difficult

 The flea valley is 11,120 feet above sea level

 There is a beautiful blue water lake between the ranges
 is jhil main jhankkar yah bhram ho uthta he ki kahin aasmaan to is jhil main nahin utar aayaa
 This lake is spread over one and a half kilometers in length
 kinvadantiyon ke mutabik sheshnag jhil main sheshnag kaa vaas he or choubees ghanton ke andar sheshnag ek baar jhil ke baahar darshan dete hai, lekin yah darshan khushnaseebon ko hi naseeb hote hai
 Pilgrims stay here for the night and start the third day journey from here
 sheshnag se panchatarani aath mile ke faasale par he
 The route has to cross the Beauvel Top and Mahagunas Pass, which are 13,500 feet and 14,500 feet in height respectively
 mahagunas chotii se panchatarani tak kaa sara rasta utraai kaa he
 This place is named Panchtarni due to five small streams flowing here
 yah sthaan chaaron taraf se pahaado kii oonchi-oonchi chotiyon se dhakaa he
 The cold is also more due to the height
 oxigen kii kami kii vajah se tirthayatriyon ko yahan suraksha ke intjaam karne padate hai
 Amarnath's cave remains only eight kilometers away from here and snow remains frozen on the way
 isi din gupha ke najadik pahunch kar padaav daal raat bitaa sakate hai or duusare din subah puja archana kar panchatarani lautaa ja saktaa he
 Some travelers reach Sheshnag by evening
 yah rasta kaaphi kathin he, lekin amarnath kii pavitra gupha main pahonchte hi safar kii sari thakaan pal bhar main chhu-mantar ho jaati he or adbhut atmik anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 The distance from Baltal to Amarnath - Jammu to Baltal is 400 km
 jammu se udhampur ke raste baltaal ke liye jammu kashmir paryatak swaagat centre kii basen aasaani se mil jaati hai
 Pilgrims from the Baltal Camp can return to the camp in one day after visiting the Amarnath cave

 Their prey is any other insect, or invertebrate
 aise jivan ke kaaran in kiton kii taangon, mukh bhaagon or samvedak indriyon main bahut se parivartan ho jate hai
 In the behavior of some such insects, obvious changes are also visible

 They often lay their eggs on their nutritious body
 paraseete keet do prakaar ke hote hai-ek jo kasheru k dandiyon par or duusare jo anya kiton tathaa unke sambandhiyon par jivit rahete hai
 The first class insects are the genus Anoplura, Malophaga and Cyphonaptera and belong to the Hippobosidae lineage
 ye paraseete apane poshak kii tulana main bahut chote hote hai
 The power to bear them develops in the nutrient and due to this their effect is not fatal

 Their adults are functional and not parasitic
 ardhparasite kaa aakaar poshak ke aakaar kii tulana main bada hota he or yah apane vyavhaar se poshak ko praaia: sadaa hi nasht kar detaa he
 Nutrients are mostly other pests, whose parasites are invaded by eggs or other unhygienic conditions
 praudh keet par kabhi bhi akraman nahin hota
 Pests of the Tachinidi lineage live within the nutrient, but lay the eggs above the nutrient, or away from the nutrient
 bahut se parashrayi kalapaksh bahya parashriton kii bhanti rahete hai, kintu adhiktar aantarik parashrayi hai or apane andey poshak kii twachaa ke bheetar pravisht kar dete hai

 kintu kuch aantarik ardhparasite aise bhi hai
 Which receive oxygen directly from the atmosphere
 kuch keet duusare kiton kaa to bhakshan nahin karte, kintu unki ekatra kii hui saamagree ko kha jate hai

 bhinn-bhinn virgon ke samjik kiton main bhinn-bhinn vilakshantaayen drushtigochar hoti hai, kintu inaki prayek mandali kaa sabase mahatvapurn lakshan yah hai ki ek hi kutub hota he, jisamen ek nar, ek maadaa or unki santan, yaa ek ganbhat maadaa or uski santan, arthath kam se kam do peediyaan ek hi sthaan par hi mil julkar rahati hai
 Real social life is found in jumbo, bees, ants and termites
 
 There is another type of symbiosis in which an insect sticks to the body of another insect

 iske kaaran in sthanon ke bahyatvak main jalasantrasic gun aa jaataa he or vahaan jal thahar nahin paata
 Therefore, respiration continues uninterrupted
 kuch kiton, jaise paudura acvatika main aise bal hote hai jinke kaaran bahyatvak jalasantrasic ho jaataa he
 Due to this property, water cannot enter the respiratory tract
 inamen bhojan praapt karne ke liye bhi vishesh saadhan hote hai, yatha-odineta ke ninfon main labium kaa ghunghat ek jaal kaa kaary karata he
 There are vibrating burruses in the mouths of mosquito eggs which produce waves in the water and thus the microorganisms of the food reach their esophagus

 Paksha is a composition of great importance
 pakshon ke kaaran kiton main athulit vitaransamarthy aa jaataa he, jo anya sthaliy jeevon main nahin paaya jaataa
 The power of distribution gives each species of insects the freedom to survive the intense competition and the impact of rigorous election, which results in excessive congestion in the finite area, but there are many insects whose distribution is limited
 saare sansar main manushyon ke gharon main paae janevaale kiton main telchatta, chaaval kaa suundwala keet, daalon ke keet aadi prasiddh he
 Apart from these, gram flour, potato moth, sweet potato dill and cabbage moth are also found all over the world
 isi prakaar aise bhi bahut se keet hai jo kisi vishesh pradesh yaa desh main hi paae jate hai
 Such distribution depends on many circumstances
 bhojanprapti or prakritik dashaaen nihsandeh bahut adhik prabhaavshaalee paristhitiyaan hai
 Waterborne pests cannot live where there is no water
 vrikshon kii chaal main rahane vaale keet un sthanon main nahin paae ja sakate jahaan vriksh hi na ho

 Fruit flies, paddy pests etc
 are found only in the epoch
 kuch kiton main jaise tiddiyon or kuch titliyon main, kabhi-kabhi pravajan kii pravriti hoti he or ye sudur deshon tak pahanch jate hai
 But the modern distribution of many insects cannot be interpreted on the basis of the modern state of the earth and climate and therefore often has to resort to geological changes
 spring tail naamak keet newjiland or chile main paaya jaataa he
 From this, it can be inferred that the atactic continent was spread between these two countries at some time, because this insect is so soft and unbiased that it cannot be distributed in any other way
 spring tail kaa anya kiton kii tulana main sabase adhik vistrut vitaran he or is kaaran isane apane ko in vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool bana liya he
