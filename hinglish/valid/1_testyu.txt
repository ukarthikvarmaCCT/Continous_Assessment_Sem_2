jab kisi parvidyut ko sandharitra ke do patton ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he or sandharitra ko ek shaktishaalee ucch aavriti utpaadak se sambhddha kar diya jaataa he, to ek hanidhara ke kaaran parvidyut kaa taap bad jaataa he or hawa pighalane lagata he
 This type of rule is also for heating by inspiration
 ye yuktiyaan saadhaaran garam karne kii apeksha adhik laabhadaayak hai
 Electricity is used a lot in the industry to heat objects
 is vidhi se kaary bahut svachh hota he tathaa khuli hui jwaala upasthit nahin rahati
 The method of heating metals is called induction-heating and the method of heating non-conductive materials is called electro-heating
 in donon vidhiyon ke liye ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wrap a coil around the piece of metal to be heated and alternating current in it
 vidyut-pravaah se utpann chumbakeey syand vaayu main se tathaa kundali ke sameep upasthit dhaatu main se bhi hokar jaataa he
 The reversal of the current also changes the wind, which causes the voltage in the metal to be induced
 is voltata ke kaaran dhaatu main adhik maatra main bhanvar dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he
 The heat is then generated due to the resistance of the metal
 vidyut se achaalak padaarthon ko tapt karne ke liye 1,000 kilocycle yaa 1 megacicle se adhik aavriti kii shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since current cannot flow through the object, the object is placed between high-voltage metal plates
 vidyut kshetra ke teevr parivartan ke kaaran achaalak vastu kii anu-saranchana main bhi vaise hi parivartan hone lagate hai
 Due to friction between molecules, the same temperature is produced everywhere in the object
 is vidhi se achaalak vastuon kii moti chaadaron ko bahut thode samay main tapt kiya ja saktaa he
 They can be compacted by moving high currents in two pieces of metal, ie, the machine has a capacitance converter, which converts 1 to 10 voltmeters from between two electrical currents of 220 or 440 volts
 And at the same time gives high electrification
 sandhan karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki dhara kaa pravaah alp samay ke liye hi ho
 a contact-circuit is used by this
 yah yukti paripath ko sheeghra-sheeghra jodatii or todatii rahati he
 The contact-circuit uses an electron tube called the "ignitron"
 ignitron ek vishesh prakaar kii gas-yukt nalee hoti he, jo ucch vidyut-dhara ko sanbhaal sakati he
 Its use is similar to a thyratron tube

 Soon the Guru felt that his disciple was more talented and talented than him, so he gave all the knowledge that Guru had to his disciple Vinci
 chitrakala ke atirikt ejineering, maanav sharir sanrachana ke adhyayan main bhi liyanardo ko maharath hasil thi
 Hundreds of years before the birth of the Wright brothers, it was difficult to imagine an airplane, when Leonardo made a model of a machine flying in the air

 Beautiful river, tree and waterfall natural scenes are seen in the background of the picture
 aisa lagata he jaise studiyon main ek vishaal khuli hui khidki ke saamne baitaakar vishay ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 In 2007, French engineer Pascal Côté announced that his ultra-high resolution scan on the picture showed that Monalisa was actually painted with eyebrows but over time these colors were gone
 unhone iske peeche atyadhik safai ko ek sambhavit vajah mana
 Based on the documents obtained from the Florence where the painting began to be made in 1503, he states that Monalisa gave birth to an infant at the end of the same year
 ek italvi va america shodhakarta dwaara florence se praapt carch ke padri dwaara shishu ke namakaran kii dharmik rasm ke dastavejon ke hawaale se is baat kii pushti kii gai he

 In another discovery, a teacher named Giuseve Pallati, a resident of Florence, made a revelation after scrutinizing all the city's ancient documents and records for 25 years, Lisa Gherardini was married in 1495 to Sir Francisco del Jacadain, a wealthy silk merchant
 san 1550 main purnajagaran kaaleen kalakaaron ke italy nivasee prasiddh jeevani lekhak georgio vasari dwaara resham vyapaaree kii patni lija gherardini kii tasviir ko mona lija naam diya gaya
 The word Mona in Italian is used for madam
 halaanki iske sadiyon baad tak bhi is kalakriti main chitrit is mahila ko uske anya prachlit naam lajiokande se bhi janaa jaataa rahaa he
 Like most of the art works of that time, the name of the woman giving the artist's signature, date and pose is not printed in this painting
 pallaanti ke anusaar liyanardo ke pita sar piyare va francisko ke ghar paraspar adhik duuri par nahin the, par donon hi pariwaron ke bich paraspar ghanishtha sambandh the
 At that time Lisa was 24 years old

 According to Ms
 Mike, Ishabella has a sad smile because her mother died shortly before Leonardo made the painting
 mike kii maane to ishabela kaa sharaabi pati nashe main dhut hokar use aksar martha-peethta tha
 In his published book 'who is Monalisa' Insarch has drawn many similarities
 pustak main aage likhaa he ki liyanardo jo ki diu ke darbar main shahi kalakaar the, isabela ke kaaphi nikat the
 About 8 years ago, a doctor of teeth in Japan surprised everyone by saying that the secret of Monalisa's mysterious smile is the break of the two front teeth in her upper jaw and that is why her upper lip was pressed on one side
 -this is visible, that is why one of his upper lips is seen as something suppressed from one side
 yahi kaaran he ki anjaane main monaalisa va rahasyamay muskaan dikhaai detii he jab ki vastav main yah muskaraahat nahin balki apane tut chuke daanton se khaali hue sthaan ko jeebh se hothon ko thelne kaa prayaas kar rahi he jisase hoth dabaa hua na dikhe

 In an article published in the journal Art and Antics, Ms
 Lillian claimed that she was stunned to see that Leonardo and Monalisa's faces, eyes, in 1518, when she placed a self-portrait of Leonardovinchi made of red chalk and a portrait of Monalisa
 There is a wonderful similarity between cheeks, nose and hair
 computer ke madad se jab monaalisa ke chehre ke upar liyanardo ke bal, dadhi va bhavahe lagaakar dekha gaya to vah puri tarah liyanardo main parivartit ho gai
 Conversely, if Lianardo's face is removed from his beard, hair, mustache, bhava, etc
, Leonardo turns into Monalisa
 sward ji kaa kathan he ki liyanardo ne monaalisa ke rup main swayan kaa nari chithran kiya he
 He cited the homosexuality of an artist as the main reason behind it
 is baat kii prabal sambhaavna he ki vinci samalangik ho or ubhay lingi vishyon ko kalakriti main dhaalane main ruchi rakhte ho tathaa apni isi pravitti ke chalate swayan ko nari rup main chitrit kar use monaalisa naam diya

 His ardent admirers and staunch critics have also often been complicit with this story
 pracheen sahitya, samskruti, hindi bhashaa samakaleen samaaj, raajnneeti aadi vishyon se judi inaki vidwata kaa zikr yada-kada hota rahata he, par ‘kachua dharam’ or ‘maresi mohi kuthaun’ jaise ek do nibandhon or puraani hindi jaisi lekhamala ke ullekh ko chhodkar us vidwata kii baangi aam pathak tak shaayad hi pahaunchi ho
 The wider Hindi society is almost unaware of his scholarly schism and prolific talent
 apane 39 varsh ke sankshipt jeevankaal main guleri ji ne kisi swatantra granth kii rachana to nahin ki kintu footkar rup main bahut likhaa, anginat vishyon par likhaa or anek vidhaon kii visheshtaon or roopon ko sametate-samanjit karte hue likhaa
 a large part of his writing, where it is purely academic or research, is a sign of his scholarly and erudite; At the same time, a larger part of it shows an open mind, a humanistic vision and a deep concern with contemporary society, religious politics, etc
 lok se yah sarokaar unki ‘puraani hindi’ jaisi academik or ‘maharishi chyavan kaa ramayana’ jaisi shodhaparak rachanaaon tak main dikhaai detaa he
 In addition to these things, the modernity of Guleri's ideas also demands from us his antiquity today
 maatr 39 varsh kii jivan-avadhi ko dekhte hue guleri ji ke lekhan kaa pariman or unki vishay-vastu tathaa vidhaon kaa vaividhya sachmuch vismayakar he
 His works include stories, stories, narratives, fine essays, critical essays on serious topics, research papers, reviews, editorial comments, notes written in paper genre, articles and statements on contemporary literature, society, politics, religion, science, art, etc
, Vedic / Management, articles and comments on mythological literature, archeology, language, etc
 are all included
 vishay-vastu kii vyapaktaa kii drushti se guleri ji kaa lekhan dharm puraatatva, itihaas or bhashashastra jaise gambheer vishyon se lekar kaashi kii neend jaise halake-phulke vishyon tak ko samaan bhav se sametataa he
 Such a diversity of subjects testifies to the author's study, interest and breadth of knowledge, so the idea of each subject in such a deeply contemporary perspective underlines his time and his awareness of new ideas
 raaj jyotishi ke parivaar main janme, hindu dharm ke tamaam karmkandon main vidhiwat dikshit, tripundadhari nishthavan brahman kii chhavi se yah roodhibhanjak yatharth shaayad mail nahin khaataa, magar us saamaajik-raajnneetik-saahitiyik uttejnaa ke kaal main unka pratigaami rudhiyon ke khilaaf awaz uthaanaa swaabhaavik hi tha
 It is important to remember that in the name of opposing the orthodox, they do not just blindly turn the sword
 khandan ke saath hi ve uchit or upyukt kaa mandan bhi karte hai
 But wherever they see hypocrisy or impropriety in religion, society, politics and literature, they attack it fiercely
 is kram main unki vaicharik paardarshita, gaharaai or doordarshita isi baat se siddh he ki unke uthaae hue adhiktar mudde or unki aalochana aaj bhi praasangik hai
 Apart from its relevance, the interestingness of his writing also lies in the unique nuances of his presentation
 us yug ke kai anya nibandhkaaron kii tarah guleri ji ke lekhan main bhi masti tathaa vinod bhav ek anterdhara lagaataar pravaahit hoti rahati he
 In the writing of almost every subject, except for a few serious subjects like theology, spiritualism etc
, this humor is equally echoed in quotes and utterances in the idioms of the language in the choice of themes
 jahaan aalochana kuch adhik bhedak hoti he, vahaan yah vinod vyangy main badal jaataa he-jaise shiksha, saamaajik, roodhiyon tathaa raajnneeti sambandhi lekhon main isse guleri ji kii rachanaayen kabhi gudgudakar, kabhi jhakazorkar pathak kii ruchi ko baandhe rahati hai
 The style of Guleri ji is mainly the style of conversation where he is directly related to the reader in the tone of Kisabayani
 yah saahitiyik bhashaa ke rup main khadi boli ko sanvarane kaa kaal tha
 Therefore, at the level of terminology and usage, there is some lack of coherence and refinement
 kahin ve ‘prishni’, ‘clripti’ or ‘agmighra’ jaise aprachlit sanskrit shabdon kaa prayog karte hai to kahin ‘ber’, ‘bichoda’ or ‘pand’ jaise theth lokbhasha ke shabdon kaa
 Not only the words of English, Arabic, Persian etc
, the idioms also come in full or translated form in their writing
 par bhashaa ke is mili-jule rup or baatcheet ke lahaze se unke lekhan main ek anaupchaarikta or atmiyata bhi aa gai he
 Yes Guleri ji gives lots of quotes and examples in his writing
 in uddharanon or udaahranon se aamtaur par unka kathy or adhik spasht tathaa rochak ho uthta he par kai jagah yah pathak se udhaaharan kii prishthbhumi or prasang ke gyaan kii maang bhi karata he aam pathak se pracheen bhartiya vaanmay, pashchimi sahitya, itihaas aadi ke itane gyaan kii apeksha karnaa hi galat he
 Therefore this additional 'contextualism' is definitely a hindrance in the smooth taste of his writings
 baharhaal guleri ji kii abhivyakti main kahin bhi jo bhi kamiyaan rahi hon, hindi bhashaa or shabdaawalee ke vikaas main unke sakaaratmak yogadan kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 He was using Khadi dialect in many subjects and in many contexts - perhaps more than any other contemporary scholar
 sahitya puraana-prasang itihaas, vigyaan, bhashavigyaan, puraatatva, dharm, darshan, raajnneeti, samajashaastra aadi anek vishyon kii vaahak unki bhashaa swaabhaavik rup se hi anek prayuktiyon or shaileyon ke liye gunjaaish bana rahi thi
 He is a living proof of Hindi's ability to express various subjects
 har sandarbh main unki bhashaa athmiya tathaa sajiv rahati he, bhale hi kahin-kahin vah adhik jatil yaa adhik halaki kyon na ho jaati ho
 Guleri's language and style was not merely a medium for expression of his ideas
 vah yug-sandhi par khadey ek viveki maanas kaa or us yug kii maansikta kaa bhi pramanik dastauez he
 Pointing towards this, Prof
 Namwar Singh also says, "guleri ji was not just creating a new prose or new style in Hindi but he was actually creating a new consciousness and this new prose was a creative creation of new consciousness
 Means
 ’’ His 'and modernity' is evident in his serious association with contemporary social, political and religious situations and in his thoughts and reactions to them
 unka sarokaar apane samay ke keval bhashik or saahitiyik aandolanon se hi nahin, us yug ke jivan ke har paksh se tha
 They could not live without commenting on the situation that attracted or excited their psyche
 ye tippaniyan unke sarokaaron, kushaagratha or najariye ke khulepan kii gavaahi detii hai
 In many respects, Galeri ji was so ahead of his time that his comments still make us look around and think
 ‘kheloge kudoge hoge kharaab’ kii manyata vaale yug main guleri ji khel ko shiksha kaa shashakt madhyam maanate the
 With the opposition of child marriage and support of female education, a hundred years ago, he considered co-education necessary for the healthy development of boys and girls
 ye sab aaj ham shahari janon ko itihaas ke rochak prasang lag sakate hai kintu puure desh ke sandarbh main, yahan faile ashiksha or andhvishwaas ke maahaul main guleri ji kii baaten aaj bhi sangat or vichaarneey hai
 They continue to mention the weaknesses of Indians - especially in socio-political contexts
 hamaare adhampatan kaa ek kaaran aapasi foot he-‘‘yah mahadweep ek duusare ko kaatane ko daudti hui billiyon kaa pitara he’’ jati-vyavastha bhi hamaari bahut badi kamazori he
 Guleri ji calls for abandoning the narrowness of the mind and coming to that grand field where there is no difference of social caste, no difference of mental caste and where there is caste discrimination, then the interests of working system
 chuaachhut ko ve sanathan dharm ke viruddh maanate hai
 They strongly contradict meaningless rituals and superstitions associated with astrology
 keval shastramulak dharm ko ve bahyadharm maanate hai or dharm ko karmkand se na jodakar itihaas or samajashaastra se jodate hai

 pakhtun lok-manyata ke anusaar yah jaati 'bani israel' yani yahudee vansh kii he
 According to this legend, ten tribes of Israel, formed approximately 2,800 years ago at the time of the Assyrian Empire in West Asia, were expelled and are the same clan

 Similarly, the 91st verse of the third section mentions the Afridi clan in the name of 'aaparyatay'
 pakhtunon ke bani israel hone kii baat satrahavin sadi isvi main jahangir ke kaal main likhi gayi kitaab “magazane afgaani” main bhi milti he
 Alexander Burns, an English writer and traveler, has also written about his visit to Bukhara in 1835 by the Pakhtuns believing themselves to be Israel
 haalanki pakhtun khud ko bani israel to kehete hai lekin dharmik rup se vah musalmaan hai, yahudee nahin
 Alexander Berne again wrote in 1837 that when he asked the then Afghan king friend Mohammed about it, his answer was that his subjects were Israel
 There is no doubt but also that they are Muslims and modern Jews
 Will not support wiliam moorekraft ne bhi 1819 va 1825 ke bich bharat, punjab or afghanistan samet kai deshon ke yatra-varnan main likhaa ki pakhtunon kaa rang, naak-naqsh, sharir aadi sabhi yahudiyon jaisaa he
 JB Fraser, in his 1834 book titled 'historical and Narrative History of Persia and Afghanistan', said that the Pakhtuns considered themselves to be Israel of Israel and maintained their religious purity even before adopting Islam
 joseph fiere ferier ne 1858 main apni afakhaan itihaas ke bare main likhi kitaab main kaha ki vah pakhtunon ko benny israel maanane par us samay majaboor ho gaya jab use yah jaankaree mili ki nadirshah bharat-vijay se pehle jab peshawar se guzara to yousufazai kabeeley ke pradhan ne use ibrani bhashaa main likhi hui bible va pracheen upasna main upyog kiye jane vaale kai lekh saath bhent kiye

 Most populous metropolis of National Capital Territory of Delhi: rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli ke shahar, jinaki jansankhya 100,000 se upar he, nimna hai: Myocardial infarction or acute myocardial infarction is commonly known as a heart attack or heart attack, in which there is an obstruction of blood circulation in some parts of the heart, causing the heart cells to die
 yah aamtaur par kamjor dhamnikalakaathinya pattica ke vidaaran ke baad parihrid-dhamni ke rodh ke kaaran hota he, jo ki lipid kaa ek asthir sangrah or dhamni pattee main shwet rakt koshika hota he
 As a result of ischemic anemia and lack of oxygen, if left untreated for a long period, heart muscle tissue damage or death may occur
 teevr rodhgalan ke shastreey lakshanon main achaanak chaati main dard,, saans kii takalif, michali, ulti, ghabrahat, pasinaa or chintaa shaamil hai
 mahilaon ko purushon ke mukaable kam vishisht lakshan anubhav ho saktaa he, aamtaur par saans kii kami, thakaan, apach or kamajori
 sabhi rodhgalan daure seene main dard yaa anya lakshan ke bina lagbhag ek chauthai "niskriy" hote hai
 Diagnostic tests to detect available heart muscle damage include electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and various blood tests
 The most frequently used markers are creatine kinase-mb and troponin t levels
 Immediate treatment for suspected acute myocardial infusion includes oxygen, aspirin, and subcutaneous nitroglycerin
 estiemai ke adhikansh maamalon ko thrambolysis yaa parcutanies coronary intervension ke saath ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 NSTEMI ko dawa ke saath prabandhit kiya janaa chahie, haalanki aspataal pravesh ke dauraan PCI kaa aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 ve log jinamein kai rukaawatein or jo apekshaakrit sthir rahe hai, yaa kuch apatkaaleen maamalon main, bypass surgery ek vikalp ho saktaa he
 Heart attacks are one of the main causes of death for both men and women worldwide
 Important risk factors are prior heart disease, older age, high blood pressure of certain lipids of tobacco smoking and low levels of high density lipoprotein, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, excessive alcohol consumption , Drug abuse and chronic high stress levels
 teevr rodhgalan ke do buniyadi prakaar hote hai: Clinically, an infarction can be classified as an ST elevation MI versus a non-st elevation MI based on ECG changes
 achaanak hriday maut kaa varnan karne ke liye kabhi-kabhi "dil kaa daura" vaakyansh kaa istemaal galat tareeke se kiya jaataa he jo ki teevr rodhgalan ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he yaa nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 dil kaa daura isse alag hota he, lekin purnahridrodh kaa kaaran ho saktaa he jo ki dil kii dhadkan or asaamaanya dhadkan hrid-atalata ko roktaa he
 saath hi yah hridpaat se bhi alag hota he, jisamen dil ko pump karne main asamarth hota he; gambhir rodhgalan se hridpaat ho saktaa he, lekin aisa hona jaruri nahin he
 a consensus document in 2007 categorized myocardial infarction into five main types: rodhgalan main lakshanon kii shuruyaat aamtaur par kai minuton tak dhire-dhire hoti he or shaayad hi kabhi achaanak hoti he
 teevr rodhgalan ke lakshanon main seene main dard hona saamaanya he or aksar pakadan, dabaav, yaa nichod kii sansani mahasoos hoti he
 dil peshi ke sthanik araktata ke kaaran chaati main dard ko engina pectoris kaha jaataa he
 aamtaur par baane baanh main sabase adhik dard hota he, lekin dard nichle jabade, gardan, daane baanh, peeth or adhijthar, jahaan yah dil ke jalane kaa kaary kar saktaa he, main fail saktaa he
 lewine sin, jisamen rogi ko urafalak main modan ke dwaara chaati main dard mahasoos karata he, jise aam taur par cardiyak chaati dard kaa bhavi suchak mana jaataa he, haalanki ek sambhavit avlokan adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki iskaa ek kamjor sakaaratmak bhavi suchak mulya tha
 Shortness of breath occurs when heart damage limits production of the left ventricle, causing left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema
 Other symptoms include diaphoresis weakness, mild headache, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations
 These symptoms are induced by the sympathetic nervous system with an increased likelihood of catecholamines that are in response to pain and hemodynamic abnormalities that do not function cardiac
 Happens as a result of
 Loss of consciousness and sudden death can be found in myocardial infarction
 mahilaon or vayask rogiyon samakakshon ke vicitra report unamem purush or yuvaaon kii tulana main adhik lakshan paae jate hai
 purushon kii tulana main mahilaon main lakshan kii report adhik hoti he 
 mahilaon main emai kaa sabase aam lakshanon main se dispaniya, kamajori or thakaan shaamil he
 thakaan, neend gadabadi or dispaniya ko aksar hone vaale lakshanon main paaya jaataa he jo ki vaastavik chikitsakeey prakat isckemik ghatana se pehle ek maheene ke lambey samay tak ho saktaa he
 purushon kii tulana main mahilaon main seene main dard se coronary ishemia ke hone kii sambhaavna kam hoti he
 About a quarter of myocardial infarction is calm, without any chest pain or other symptoms
 Such cases can be detected later by electrocardiograms, in which autopsy is used without prior history of blood enzyme testing or related complaints
 This calming symptom is more common in elderly people, patients with diabetes mellitus, and possibly after heart transplant, because the recipient's nervous system is unable to fully generate power in the donor heart
 In diabetic patients, differences in initial pain, autonomic neuropathy, and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for the lack of symptoms
 dil main raktapravaah achaanak rukaawat ke saath sangat lakshan ke kisi bhi samooh ko teevr syndrome coronary kaha jaataa he
 Differential diagnoses include other catastrophic causes of chest pain such as pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, cardiac temponade due to pericardial effusion, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture
 Other non-objectionable variants include gastroesophageal reflux and Tiëtje syndrome
 teevr prayog ke saath judane main dil kaa daura kaa dar ucch hota he, yah maansik tanaav yaa shaareerik parishram hota he, khaskar vyakti ke saamaanya parishram kii tulana main yadi parishram teevr ho to

 Acute acute infections such as pneumonia can increase myocardial infarction
 Chelamedophila pneumoniae is a more controversial link between infection and atherosclerosis
 While it has been demonstrated in intracellular organism atherosclerosis plaques, the evidence is inconclusive as it can be considered as a causal factor
 During treatment in patients with antibiotics it has been found that atherosclerosis does not reduce the risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular attacks

 kuch jaanchakartaaon ne dhyaan diya he ki cirkidian maap ke anusaar platelets ko or adhik badhaane kii kshamta he, haalanki unhen karaniya sabit nahin kiya gaya he
 Risk factors for atherosclerosis Common factors for myocardial infarction are: in jokhim karkon main se kai parivartaneey he, isiilie kai dil ke daure ko ek swasth jivan style banaae rakhane ke dwaara roka ja saktaa he
 udhaaharan ke liye, shaareerik gatividhi, nune jokhim profil ke saath judaa he
 gaiyr parivartaneey jokhim karkon main aayu, ling or parivaar main samay se pehle dil ke daure hone vaale itihaas, jise anuvanshik pravriti ke rup main parilakshith kiya jaataa he, shaamil hai
 Socioeconomic factors such as low education and low income and unmarried cohabitation may contribute to the risk of MI
 To understand the results of epidemiological studies it is important to note that many factors associated with multiple MI increase its risk through other factors
 For example, the impact of education is partly based on its income and marital status

 Inflammation is known to be an important step in the atherosclerotic plaque formation process
 C-reactive protein is a sensitive but non-specific marker for inflammation
 High CRP blood levels, especially those measured with sensitive examination, can recognize the risk of MI, as well as predict the risk of developing seizures and diabetes
 In addition, some medications for MI lower CRP levels
 The general population is advised against high use of CRP screening sensitivity as a means of screening, but it can be used at the discretion of the doctor Alternatively, in patients with pathological arterial coronary disease who already have other risk factors or Is known
 Whether atherosclerosis in the direct role of CRP plays remains uncertain

 Osteoporosis or osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the risk of fractures
 osteoporosis main asthi khanij ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, asthi sookshm-sanrachana vighatit hoti he or asthi main asangrahit protein kii raashi or vividhta parivartit hoti he
 The World Health Organization has defined osteoporosis in women as the bone mineral density 2
5 standard deviations below the maximum bone mass as measured by DXA; The term "establishment of osteoporosis" also includes the presence of delicate fractures
 osteoporosis, mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad sarvaadhik saamaanya he, jab use rajonivrittottar osteoporosis kehete hai, par yah purushon main bhi viksit ho saktaa he or yah kisi main bhi vishisht hormone sambandhi vikaar tathaa anya dirghakaalik bimariyon ke kaaran yaa aushadhiyon, vishesh rup se glucocorticoid ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he, jab is beemaari ko steroid yaa glucocorticoid-prerit osteoporosis kaha jaataa he
 Given its effect, the risk of fragile fracture remains, bone weakness can significantly affect life expectancy and quality of life
 osteoporosis ko jivan-style main parivartan or kabhi-kabhi dawaaiyon se roka ja saktaa he; haddiyon kii kamazori vaale logon ke upachaar main donon shaamil ho sakati hai
 Changing lifestyles include exercising and preventing falls; Medicines include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, and many others
 girane se rokthaam kii salaah main chahalqadami vaali mansapeshiyon ko taanane ke liye vyaayaam, utak-samvedi-sudhaar abhyaas; santulan chikitsa shaamil kii ja sakati hai
 Exercise, with its anabolic effect, can at the same time stop or reverse osteoporosis
 osteoporosis ke sabhi maamalon main antarnihit pranali asthi avasorana or asthi-nirmaan ke bich asantulan he
 The normal bone contains a constant bone reproducibility matrix; At any given point of time, 10% of all bone mass undergoes reproduction
 jaisaa ki 1963 main frost ne pehali baar bataaya, yah prakriya asthi bahukoshikeey ikaayiyon main ghatit hoti he
 Bone is absorbed by osteoblast cells, after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells
 jin teen pramukh kriyavidhiyon dwaara haddiyon kii kamazori viksit hoti he, ve hai aparyaapt sheersh asthi pind, atyadhik asthi avasorana or punarpratirupan ke dauraan nai asthi kaa aparyaapt gathan
 najuk asthi utak ke vikaas ke mul main he, in teen kriyavidhiyon kii parsparik kriya
 hormone sambandhi kaarak asthi avasorana kii dar ko visheshtah nirdhaarit karte hai; estrogen kii kami asthi avasorana ko badhaati he or saath hi, aam taur par bhaar-vahan karne vaali asthiyon main hone vaale nai asthi ke nickshepan ko kam karti he
 The amount of estrogen required to suppress this process is generally lower than the amount expected to stimulate the uterus and mammary gland
 asthi her-pher ke viniman main α-rup kaa estrogen receptor bahut mahatvapurn lagata he
 In bone manipulation, calcium metabolism plays an important role in addition to estrogen, and calcium and vitamin d deficiency leads to bone deposition atrophy; Additionally, the parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone, which increases bone absorption to ensure adequate amounts of calcium in the blood
 asthi nickshepan ko badhaane vaali, thyroid dwaara utpaadit hormone calsitonin kii bhoomika kam spasht he or sambhawatah PTH kii tarah utani mahatvapurn nahin
 Activation of osteoblasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL has been the most studied
 yah anu, asthikorak or anya koshikaon dwaara nirmit hota he or RANK ko uttejit karata he
 Osteoprotigerin combines RANKL before it has a chance to bind RANK and therefore suppresses its ability to increase bone absorption
 RANKL, RANK or OPG, tumor parigalan kaarak or uske grahiyon se nikat se jude hue hai
 The role of the Wnt signaling pathway has been accepted, but is poorly understood
 eicosnoid or interlukin ke sthaneey utpaadan ko, asthi her-pher ko niyantrit karne main bhaag lene vaala mana jaataa he or osteoporosis ke vikaas ke mul main in madhyasthon kaa adhik yaa kam utpaadan kaarak ho saktaa he
 The bony bone is the spongy bone located at the end of the long bones and vertebrae
 valkuteey asthi, haddiyon kaa kathor bahari kavach or lambii haddiyon kaa madhya he
 Because osteoblasts and osteoblasts reside on the surface of bones, the ligamentous bone is more active and subject to bone manipulation and regeneration
 na keval asthi ghanatv kam hota he, balki asthi kii sookshm-sanrachana baadhit hoti he
 The ligamentous bone weak bones are dislocated and replaced by weak bones
 aam osteoporotic asthi-bhang jagahen, yatha kalai, kuulhe or ridh kii haddi main valkuteey asthi se bandhakmay asthi kaa anupaat apekshaakrit ucch hota he
 These sites are dependent on the asymptomatic bone for strength, and therefore when the reproduction is unbalanced, rapid regeneration leads to weathering of these sites
 osteoporosis kaa apana koi vishesh lakshan nahin he; iskaa mukhya parinaam, asthi bhang kaa vardhit jokhim he
 Osteoporotic fractures occur in conditions where bone is not broken in healthy people in general; Hence they are considered to be fragile fractures
 vishisht najuk asthi-bhang kasheruki stambh, pasli, kuulhe or kalai main hote hai
 Symptoms of spinal cord depression are sudden back pain, often accompanied by nerve root pain and rarely with spinal compression or caudal cavity syndrome
 Multiple vertebral fractures cause long-term pain due to tingling, loss of height, consequent decrease in mobility
 lambii haddiyon ke asthi-bhang gatishiltaa par teevr kshati pahunchaate hai or shalya-chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Hip fractures in particular typically require immediate surgery, as hip fractures are associated with several serious risks such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary angiography and increased death
 badhati umr se jude girane ke jokhim main kalai, ridh or kuulhe kii haddi tut sakati he
 The risk of falling, respectively, is exacerbated by debilitating eyesight, balance disorder, mobility disorder, dementia, and sarcopenia for any reason
 nipaat ullekhneey taur par girane ke jokhim kii ore le jaataa he; behoshee ke kaaran kai guna hai, par inamen hrid-sambandhi atalata, tantrika-hrid sambandhi behoshee, orthostetic alp rakt-chaap or daura shaamil ho sakate hai
 Removal of obstructions and loose carpets in residential environments can significantly reduce falls
 jo pehle bhi gir chuke hon or jinaki chaal yaa santulan avyavasthit ho, unhen sabase zyada girane kaa khatara he
 Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures can be divided between non-variable and variable
 iske atirikt, aise vishisht rog tathaa vikaar maujuud hai, jinamein osteoporosis ek sweekrut samasya he
 Medication use is theoretically variable, although in many cases the use of drugs that increase the risk of osteoporosis is unavoidable

 Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2
5 standard deviations of the young adult reference population
 ise T-score kaha jaataa he
 The World Health Organization has established the following guidelines: jab osteoporotic fracture bhi ho, jise ek khadi oonchai se girane kii vajah se ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab shabd "gambhir yaa sthapit" osteoporosis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The International Committee on Diagnostic Densitometry recognizes that osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be diagnosed on the basis of density measurement criteria alone
 They also state that for pre-menopausal women, a Z-score should be used instead of a T-score, and that osteoporosis should not be diagnosed in such women as well, based on densification criteria alone

 In relation to the screening of men, a cost-analysis study suggests that the investigation "costs in cases of auto-reported pre-fractures in men 65 years of age and without pre-fractures in men 80 years and older" May be less "
 In addition, in middle-to-adult men, a significant reduction in testosterone levels, say less than 300, may be less expensive to detect
 ling ke aadhaar par osteoporosis kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kai dawaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Changes in lifestyle are also an aspect of treatment
 upachaar ke liye bisphosphonet mukhya aushadhiy upaay he
 However, in the 1990s, new drugs such as teriparatide and strontium renalate appeared
 pusht osteoporosis maamle main bisphosphonet dawaaen mahilaon ke upachaar-variyata kram main pratham rahi hai
 Commonly included in the prescription are bisphosphonate according to presently sodium alendronate 10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week, risadronate 5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week and or ibandronate once a month
 2007 nirmaataa-samarthit ek adhyayan kaa bataaya ki kam-prabhaav kulha asthi-bhang se peedit rogiyon main, 5 mg zoladronic amla ke vaarshik aadhaan ne kisi bhi fracture ke khatre ko 35% tak, kasheruki fracture ke khatre ko 3
8% se 1
7% tak or gaiyr-kasheruki fracture ke jokhim ko 10
7% se 7
6% tak kam kiya he
 The study also found mortality benefit after 1
9 years: 9
6% of the study group died due to any cause, indicating 28% mortality benefit
 maukhik bisphosphonet apekshaakrit kam avashoshit hote hai or isliye inhen khaali pet lenaa chahie, jahaan agle 30 minute tak koi bhojan yaa peya naa liya jaae

 Although intermittent doses with intravenous prescriptions such as zolendronate prevent oral tolerance problems, these factors are predominantly involved in a rare but unpleasant oral disease called mandibular osteonecrosis
 is kaaran se, maukhik bisphosphonet chikitsa ko sambhawatah tarjeeh di jaani chahie or ab doctor yah anushansa karte hai ki upachaar se purv hi koi bhi upachaaratmak danta kaary kar lenaa chahie
 Recently, teriparatide has been found to be effective against osteoporosis
 yah paratharid hormone kii tarah kaam karata he or asthikorak uttejit karata he or is prakaar unki gatividhi badhati he
 It is used mostly for patients with osteoporosis, especially those with low BMD or multiple fracture risk factors, or who cannot tolerate oral biophosphonates
 yah kalam jaise ek injection upkaran ke istemaal ke saath dainik injection ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some countries, teriparatide can be used for treatment only if biophosphonates fail or are prohibited
 purv vikiran chikitsa yaa paget rog vaale mariz yaa yuva marijon ko is dawa se bachanaa chahie
 Oral strontium renalate is an alternative oral treatment, which belongs to a class of drugs that its manufacturer has named "dual action bone agents"
 isane vishesh rup se kasheruki fracture ke nivaaran main apni kshamta sabit kar di he
 Laboratory experiments noted that strontium renalate promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts, as well as restricts the proliferation of osteoblasts
 stronsium rinlate ko har rose 2g maukhik nilamban ke rup main liya jaataa he or kasheruki or hip fracture ko rokane ke liye haddiyon kii kamajori ke upachaar hetu ise license di gai he
 Strongium renlate has a side effect effect compared to bisphosphonate, as it does not produce any type of upper GI adjunctive effect, which is the most common reason for drug withdrawal in osteoporosis

 haalanki stronsium rinlate prabhavi he, par sanyukt rajya america main abhi tak iskaa upyog sweekrut nahin hua he
 However, strontium citrate is available from many well-known vitamin manufacturers in the US
 adhikansh shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki stronsium bhale hi kisi rup main prayukt ho, vah surakshit or prabhavi he
 The Rheinlet type is only a tool invented by the French Servier Company to patent its version of strontium
 strontium, chaahe uskaa koi bhi rup ho, pani main ghulne yogya or udar amla main ynit hona chahie
 stronsium ko tab antra nalee se rakt pravaah main vahan ke liye protein-baddh kiya jaataa he
 Unlike drugs such as sodium alendronate, strontium does not inhibit bone reorientation and, in fact, can produce stronger bones
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki paanch saal ke baad alendronet asthi kshay kaa kaarak bhi ho saktaa he, jabaki stronsium jivan-kaal ke dauraan prayukti se haddi kaa nirmaan jari rakhata he
 Strontium should not be taken with diet or calcium-rich dishes, as calcium competes with strontium during levitation
 phir bhi, yah zaruri he ki har rose calcium, magnesium or chikitsiya maatra main vitamin di lenaa chahie, lekin stronsium lete samay main nahin
 stronsium ko raat main khaali pet lenaa chahie
 Estrogen replacement treatment is a good treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, but at this time, unless other indications for its use are available, it is not recommended
 mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad pehle dashak main estrogen kii sifaarish ke bare main anischitata or vivaad maujuud hai
 Bone quantity and quality have been shown to improve with testosterone in men with hypogonadism, but, as of 2008, there have been no studies of the effect with fracture or a normal level on testosterone in men
 SERM dawaaon kaa ek varg he, jo puure sharir main estrogen grahiyon par ek chaynaatmak tareeke se kaam karte hai
 Generally, bone mineral density is controlled by an equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclast activity in the trabecular bone
 estrogen kii asthi gathan-avasorana santulan ke niyaman main pramukh bhoomika he, kyonki yah asthikorak gatividhiyon ko badhaava detaa he
 Some serms, such as raloxifene, have effects on the bones, slowing bone absorption by osteoclasts

 In contrast, despite previous reports of elevated high lipoprotein density in calcium supplements, a possible increase in the rate was found
 yadi pushti ho, yah sanket detaa he ki fracture ke kam jokhim vaali mahilaon main calcium kii poorakta se achche se zyada nuksaan hi ho saktaa he
 Some studies have shown that an overdose of vitamin d reduces bone fractures in the elderly, although the Women's Health Initiative found that although calcium and vitamin d increased bone density by 1%, it increased hip bone -did not affect the atrophy, but increased the formation of kidney stones by 17%
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki airobics, bhaar sahan or pratirodh abhyaas sabhi rajonivrutottar mahilaon main BMD ko banaae rakh sakate hai yaa badha sakate hai
 Many researchers have tried to indicate which exercises are most effective in improving BMD and other metrics of bone quality, but results have varied

 galileo gallily italy ke vaigyanik the
 He was a great inventor and had incomparable support in the development of visionaries
 is mahaan vichaarak kaa janm aadhunik italy ke pisa naamak shahar main ek sangitajna parivaar main hua tha
 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind
 inako pariksha mulak vigyaan kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced
 uski sahaayta se anek khagoleey prekshan liye tathaa copernicus ke siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya
 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique
 kaalaantar main prakaash kii gati or urja ke sambandhon kii jatil gulthi ko sulajhane vaale mahaan vaigyanik albert ainstin ne isi kaaran unhen ‘aadhunik vigyaan kaa pita ‘ ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Galileo was religious but wanted to sidestep the old religious beliefs through rationality and experimentation
 varsh 1609 main galileo ko ek aisi doorabeen kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa avishkaar holland main hua tha, is doorabeen kii sahaayta se duurastha khagoleey pindon ko dekh kar unki gati kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 Galileo himself heard this and built a telescope that was more powerful than the indiscriminate telescope in Holland
 iske aadhaar par apane prekshan tathaa prayogon ke madhyam se galileo ne yah paaya ki purv main vyaapt manyataon ke vipareet brihamand main sthit prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he
 Earlier, Copernicus also said that all the planets including the Earth revolve around the Sun, for which they had to be angry with the Church
 ab prayog ar vivek par aadhaarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par galiliye ne bhi yahi hona sidv paaya
 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the sun and the moon revolve around the earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake
