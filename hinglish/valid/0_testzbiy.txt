 The world's first human heart transplant was performed on 3 December 1967 by Christian Bernard in the city of Cape Town, South Africa
 There are 3500 heart transplants every year all over the world and there are about 8 xxrep 5 0 people who are suffering from heart failure category and need a new organ
 This inequality has inspired us a lot since 1993 to research the use of non-human hearts
 Now it is possible that we can apply the heart of another species or the heart created by man to the heart patient even though its performance is less successful than allograft
 Engineers also want that in the next 15 years these manufactured problems should be removed

 a typical heart transplant is triggered by receiving a heart with a suitable donor who has recently been declared dead or whose brain has been declared dead
 The transplant coordinator patient meets the hospital nurse who asks her to come to the hospital so that she can be evaluated and given the medicine before surgery
 At the same time, the heart is taken out of the donor's body and a team of surgeons inspects it to see if it is in the right position to be transplanted
 Sometimes this is considered inappropriate
 Sometimes it is a very worrying experience for an emotionally unstable patient and they need emotional support before going home
 The patient also goes through a lot of emotional, psychological, physical tests to make sure they are all good
 He is in mental health and will make good use of his heart

 The orthotopic procedure exposes the surgeon's sternum piercing medium to mediastinum
 The pericardium opens and the great vessels are cut and the patient is attached for cardiopulmonary bypass
 The unsuccessful heart is removed by performing a transaction, the pulmonary vein is not cut, but is left in the vein of a circular part
 The donor's heart is trimmed so that it fits into the patient's left atrium and great vessels
 When the new heart is on, the patient is released from cardiopulmonary bypass and the cine is switched off

 Doctors made history in Germany in February 2006 by transplanting a beating heart
 Normally potassium chloride is injected into a donor's heart to stop its heartbeat before it leaves the donor's body in ice Cook and keep it properly
 Ice can usually keep the heart fresh for four to six hours, depending on the condition of the heart
 Instead of cooling the heart, a new method has come out which is a machine in which the heart is kept according to the temperature of the body and it keeps on beating and hot blood flows in it
 It can maintain the heart refreshed in a suitable condition for much longer than the traditional method

 It is not necessary that some other ministers take oath along with the Prime Minister

 There was no restriction on the number of members of the Council of Ministers in the original constitution, but by the 91st amendment, the number of Council of Ministers was limited to 15% of the number of members of the Lok Sabha, even in the states, the number of Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15% of the Assembly but There will be a minimum of 12 ministers

 Due to all these reasons, the Prime Minister is considered the most important political personality of the country
 pradhanmantri sarkaar ke prakaar The Prime Minister is the type of parliamentary government in which the Prime Minister heads the Council of Ministers
 He affects the decision making ability of the cabinet
 He is more powerful than the cabinet
 His decisions are the decisions of the cabinet
 The general policies of the country are not determined by the cabinet
 The Prime Minister would do this with the help of his close aide even if he is not a member of the Council of Ministers
 Land such as Indira Gandhi was assisted by his kitchen cabinet pradhanmantri sarkaar ke laabh There is some loss cabinet sarkaar It is the same type of parliamentary government, in which the policy decision is taken collectively by the cabinet, in which the Prime Minister does not dominate the cabinet, its decisions are generally balanced but sometimes they are such which are not vague and bold
 1989 ke baad desh main pradhanmantri prakaar kaa nahin balki cabinet prakaar kaa shashan rahaa he
 Prime Minister's functions 1- mantriparishad ke gathan kaa kaary 2- Chief ruler 3- niti nirmaataa 4- Leader of Parliament 5- videsh niti kaa nirdharak After the majority is over, when the Council of Ministers resigns, then the executive government comes into existence or in the event of death / resignation of the Prime Minister
 yah sarkaar antarim prakruti kii hoti he
 It remains established until the new Council of Ministers takes oath
 yah isliye kaam karti he taaki anuchhed 74 ke anuroop ek mantriparishad raashtrapati kii sahaayta hetu rahe
 In VN Rao v Union of India, the Supreme Court held that the Council of Ministers should always be present
 yadi yah anupasthit hui to raashtrapati apane kaam swany karne lagegaa, jisase sarkaar kaa rup badal kar raashtrapati ho jaayegaa, jo ki samvidhan ke mul dhaanche ke khilaaf hoga
 This executive government cannot take any financial / policy decision as the Lok Sabha is not present at that time
 vah keval desh kaa dainik prashasan chalaati he
 The most dire situation came before such a government when Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government had to conduct the Kargil War in 1999
 kintu vikat dasha main is prakaar kii sarkaar bhi koi bhi nitigat nirnay le sakati he
 In a parliamentary government, these traditions are considered to be legally applicable to all organs of the government
 unka varnan karne ke liye koi vidhaan nahin hota he naa hi samvidhan main kisi desh ke shashan ke bare main purna varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Constitutional framers cannot predict the future development and their impact on the governance of the country
 atah ve unke sambandh main samvidhan main praavdhaan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 In this way the constitution is a living body but not a complete description
 is varnan main bina sanshodhan laaye parivartan bhi nahin ho saktaa he
 The same traditions are not statutory like the provisions of the Constitution, they act as lubricants in the running of the government and are helpful in the effective running of the government
 panrparaaye is liye palit kii jaati hai kyonki unke abhaav main rajnatik kathinaaiya aa sakati hai
 That is why they are considered complementary to the constitution

 There are two types of these: - sarkaar ke sansadeey tathaa raashtrapati prakaar Arguments in support of parliamentary rule 1
 In President's rule, the President is the actual working council who is elected by the public for a certain period of time, he is also responsible to the legislature, his ministers are also not members of the legislature and are responsible for the same
 Not in the same parliamentary rule, power is vested with the Council of Ministers which is responsible to the legislature

 One aspect of the curtain practice is the practice of burqa
 burka ek tarah kaa ghunghat he jo muslim samudaay kii mahilaayein or ladkiyaan kuch khaas jagahon par khud ko purushon kii nigaah se alag / dur rakhane ke liye istemaal karti hai
 In India, the curtain practice among Hindus is a product of Islam
 islam ke prabhaav se tathaa islamic akraman ke samay lucchon se bachaav ke liye hindu striyaan bhi paradaa karne lageen
 This practice greatly strengthened its roots during the Mughal rulers
 vaise is pratha kii shuruyaat bharat main12vin sadi main maani jaati he
 Most of its expansion was in the Rajput caste of Rajasthan
 20vin sadi ke utraarddh main is pratha ke virodh ke falswarup isamen kami ai he
 This practice blocks the basic consciousness of the woman
 vah use gulaamon jaisaa ahsaas karaati he
 Women who are tied to this practice
 ve kai baar itnaa sankoch karne lagati hai ki beemaari main bhi apni sahi se jaanch karaane main asafal rahati hai
 There are many disadvantages of keeping this system in the society
 bharat ke sandarbh main isa se 500 varsh purv rachit 'nirukt' main is tarah kii pratha kaa varnan kahin nahin miltaa
 There is a mention of the arrival of women in courts to settle property related matters among the accused
 nyaayalayon main unki upasthiti ke liye kisi pardaa vyavastha kaa vivaran isa se 200 varsh purv tak nahin miltaa
 In the ancient Vedas and Samhita before this period, there is no description of Parda system
 pracheen rugveda kaal main logon ko vivaah ke samay kanya kii ore dekhne ko kaha he- iske liye rugveda main mantra bhi he jiskaa saar he ki "yah kanya mangalamay he, ekatra ho or ise dekho, ise ashish dekar hi tum log apane ghar ja sakate ho
 According to "ashavalayanagrihyasutra", while bringing the bride to her house, the groom should show it to the audience at each investment place and get the blessings of the elders and the affection of the younger ones
 isse spasht he ki un dinon vadhuon dwaara pardaa dhaaran nahin kiya jaataa tha, balki ve sabhi ke samaksh khule sir se hi aati thim
 The mention of the Purdah system first appears to have occurred since the time of the Mughals' invasion of India
 is sambandh main kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar 'ramayana' or 'mahabharat' kaaleen striyaan kisi bhi sthaan par pardaa athwa ghunghat kaa prayog nahin karti thim
 Ajanta and Sanchi artifacts also show women without a veil
 manu or yajyavlky ne striyon kii jivan style ke sambandh main kai niyam banaae hue hai, parantu kahin bhi yah nahin kaha he ki striyon ko parde main rahanaa chahie
 Most Sanskrit plays also do not mention curtains
 yahaan tak ki 10veen shatabdi ke prarambh kaal ke samay tak bhi bhartiya raaj pariwaron kii striyaan bina parde ke sabha main tathaa ghar se baahar bhraman karti thim, yah varnan swayan ek arab yatri abu jaid ne apane lekhan ke jariye kiya he

 yah puure dakshin bharat main mashhoor he
 The dance derives its name from the village of Kuchipudi in Divi taluk of Krishna district, where the Brahmins residing practice this traditional dance
 parampara ke anusaar kuchipudi nrity mulat: keval purushon dwaara kiya jaataa tha or vah bhi keval brahman samudaay ke purushon dwaara
 These Brahmin families were called Bhagavathalu of Kuchipudi
 kuchipudi ke bhagwatthalu brahmanon kaa pehla samooh 1502 isvi ke aasapaas nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Their programs were dedicated to the deities
 prachlit kathaon ke anusaar kuchipudi nrity ko punarparibhaashit karne kaa kaary siddhendra yogi naamak ek krishna-bhakt sant ne kiya tha
 Fifteen Brahmin families of Kuchipudi have carried on the tradition for more than five centuries
 pratishthit guru jaise vedantam lakshmi narayan, chintaa krishna murti or tadepalli peraaya ne mahilaon ko isamen shaamil kar nrity ko or samrudh banaaya he
 Dr
 Vemapathi Chinna Satyam added several dance dramas to it and created the dance structure of several solo performances and thus broadened the horizon of the dance form
 yah parampara tab se mahaan bani hui he jab purush hi mahilaon kaa abhinay karte the or ab mahilaayein purushon kaa abhinay karne lagi hai
 The dance is performed in a special traditional way
 manch par paramparaagat pujan ke pashchaat prayek kalakaar manch par pravesh karata he or ek khaas layaaddh rachana dharu ke dwaara apana paatr-parichay detaa he
 The main play begins after the characters are introduced and the mood of the play is set
 nrity ke saath karnataka sangeet main nibaddh geet mrudangam, vaayalin, baansuri or tamboora ityadi vaadyayantron ke saath nrity main sahyogi bhoomika nibhaataa he or kathanak ko bhi aage badhaane main sahaayak hota he
 The jewelery worn by the dancers is traditional, having been made from a particular variety of light wood, Burugu, since the seventeenth century
 bharat muni, jinhone natya shaastra kii rachana kii, is prakaar ke nrity ke kai pahaluon kii vyakhya prastut karte hai
 Later, during the 13th century, Siddhendra Yogi gave it a different distinctive style
 mana jaataa he ki ve naatyashaastra main paarangat the or kuch khaas naatyashastreey tatwon ko chun kar is nrity ke rup main samyojit kiya
 He composed a Natyavali called Parijataharanam
 kuchipudi nartak chapal or drut gati se yukt, ek khaas vartulata liye kram main bhangimaaon kaa anukram prastut karte hai or is nrity main pad-sanchaalan main udaan kii prachur maatra hoti he jiske kaaran iske pradarshan main ek vishisht garima or layaatmakataa kaa sannivesh hota he
 This dance, performed with Carnatic music, bears similarities with Bharatanatyam in many respects
 ekal prasuti main kuchipudi main jatiswaram or tilaanaa kaa sannivesh hota he jabaki iske nritym praaroop main kai sangitabaddh rachanaaon dwaara bhakt ke bhagwaan main leen ho jane kii abhipsa kaa pradarshan hota he

 But these seemingly unique events occur
 vaigyanik unki upeksha kar sakate hai, par ghatnaon ko ghatit hone se nahin roak sakate
 The events do not appear to sit in the scientific framework - they seem to challenge the uniformity or regularity of the nature of modern science to dissolve the notion that it is no wonder that even today, scientism is viewed by scientist with suspicion and neglect

 Telepathy is called "any kind of expression or thought-transmission from one brain to another brain independent of the known means of knowledge
" aadhunik manovaigyanik "duusare vyakti kii maansik kriyaaon ke bare main atindriya gyaan" ko hi duranubhuti kii sangya dete hai
 It literally means "clear vision"
 iskaa prayog "drashtaa se dur yaa paroksh main ghatit honevaali ghatnaon yaa drishyon ko dekhne kii shakti" ke liye kiya jaataa he, jab drashtaa or drishy ke bich koi bhautik yaa andrik sambandh nahin sthapit ho paata
 The transcendental direct of objects or objective events is called "clairvances and the transcendental direct telepathy of mental events
" kisi bhi prakaar ke taarkik anumaan ke abhaav main bhi bhavishya main ghatit honevaali ghatana kii pehle se hi jaankaree praapt kar lenaa yaa uskaa sanket paa janaa purvabhaas kehalaata he
 Generating motion in an object near or far without physical contact or the impact of any known medium is called a planned motion

 The above mentioned practices have also been confirmed by several experimental studies

 The reasoning is that if the usable guesses more accurately than the potential candidate, then it certainly indicates the power of an imperceptible direct, if the control of the conditions of the experiment does not allow the suspicion that the usability has any sensory The signal must have been found

 Samuel Finley Breeze Morse was an American who built a single-wire telegraph system and Morse code
 or unhen aitihaasik drishyon ke ek chitrakaar ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Samuel F
 B
 Morse was born in Charles Town, Massachusetts, the first child of a geographer and pastor Jedidiah Morse and Elizabeth Ann Finley Breeze
 jededia kelvinist dharm ke mahaan upadeshak the or america federalist party ke samarthak the
 He considered this party not only a patron of the Puritan traditions but also believed in the idea of a treaty with Britain in relation to a strong central government
 jededia apane bete kii padhai ke liye ek sanyukt ruparekha ke saath-saath kelvinist khoobiyon, naitikta or prarthana par gaharaa vishwaas rakhte the
 After studying at Phillips Academy in Endover, Massachusetts, Samuel Morse attended Yale College, where he studied religious philosophy, mathematics, and horse science

 morse ke kelvinist vichaaron kaa pramaan unki painting da landing of pilgrims main miltaa he, jisamen saadhaaran libaas or chehre ke kathor haav-bhav chitrit kiye gaye hai
 This picture depicts the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought ideas related to religion and government to the United States, which always connected the two countries
 Primarily, this particular work caught the attention of renowned artist Washington Alston
 alston chaahate the ki morse unke saath england jaaen or kalakaar benjamin west se milen

 Arriving in England, Morse worked hard to improve his painting techniques under Alston's supervision; By the end of 1811, he was admitted to the Royal Academy

 America's anti-federalist elements joined with France and hated the British and believed that a strong central government could pose a threat to democracy
 jaise-jaise yuddh chalata gaya, unke matapita ko likhi chitthiyon main unke federal-virdohi vichaar dikhaayi dene lage
 In one such letter, Morse said, "I think that the Federalists of the northern states have done more harm to the country than the French by their fierce rebellion
" unki karrwai ko angreji samachar-patron main nakal kiya jaataa he, sansad main padhaa jaataa he or unke puure desh main vitarit kiya jaataa he or ve unke bare main kya kehete hai

 They call them cowardly, low caste people, they say that they are traitors and they should be hanged like traitors
 " haalanki jededia ne apane rajnatik vichaar nahin badale, par unhone morse ko alag tareeke se prabhavit kiya
 It is certainly clear that Jedidiah's Calvinist ideas were a core part of Morse's other important English work, the Judgment of Jupiter
 badalon main jupiter apane garud ke saath he, uske haath partiyon ke upar hai or vah jajment kaa uccharan kar rahaa he
 The expressions of Marpessa appear to be full of shame and malaise, apologizing and dedicating themselves to her husband's arms
 idaas, jo namratapurvak marpesa se pyaar karata he, vah utsukata se use lene ke liye aage bad rahaa he, jabaki apollo aashcharyachakit hokar use ghur rahaa he
 


 He is surprised at the unexpected decision 


 yah is baat kaa dyotak ho saktaa he ki jupiter bhagwaan kii shakti kaa pratik he, jo uske har kadam par najar rakhe hue hai
 Through this picture, Morse is teaching morality on infidelity
 haalanki marpesa ek shikaar hai, unhen yah ahsaas he ki unki anant mukti aavashyak he or unhone galat tareekon se munh mode liya he
 Apollo does not regret his actions, but he stands up in a confused state
 unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main bahut se america chitron main dharmik tatv or rang dikhaayi dete hai, lekin morse hi unamem sabase agrani the
 Through the Judgment of Jupiter, Morse expressed his support for ideas against his Federalism, while retaining his metaphysics
 yah kaary kelvinavaad ke madhyam se america rashtrawaad kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, kyonki england se nikaale gaye in vyaktiyon ne british ko baahar nikaalane or ek swatantra loktantratmak samaaj kaa nirmaan karne main yogadan diya
 West wanted to present this image at another Royal Academy exhibition; Unfortunately the time was up
 21 agast 1815 ko unhone england chhod diya or ek america chitrakaar ke rup main apana phul-time karier shuru kiya
 The years 1815–1825 saw much development in Morse's paintings, in which he was trying to convey the essence of America's culture and life
 unhen purv federalist raashtrapati jon adams kaa chitra banane kaa gaurav praapt hua
 He wished to be a part of larger projects, and the opportunity was created by a fight between the Federalists and the anti-federalists at Dartmouth College

morse kii shrimati emma quesh kii painting charlston ke aishwarya kaa pratik thi
 For some time, it seemed that this young painter is doing a great job for himself
 1819 or 1821 ke bich, morse ne apane jivan main ek bahut bade parivartan kaa anubhav kiya
 The commission in Charleston was scrapped when the city saw a financial meltdown

 One could argue that he was completely infected towards anti-federalism when he was appointed to photograph President James Monroe
 monro ne jeffrsonian loktantr ko saakaar rup diya or iske liye ve kuleen vyaktiyon se zyada aam aadmi kaa paksh lete the; baad main unhone andryu jackson ke udgam par par jor diya
 There were two important commissions that shaped Morse's career in art, returning from New Haven until the founding of the National Academy of Design

 He successfully balanced the architecture of Rotunda with Figurines and the illumination of the lamp was shown as the main point of this work
 chitra main, logon ke jode, akele khadey hue log or desk par jhuk kar kaam karte hue logon ko darshaya gaya, inhen bahut saadhaaran rup se chitrit kiya gaya tha lekin unke chehre vishesh rup se parilakshith hote the
 Morse chose night time instead of day to reflect Congress' dedication to the principles of democracy
 haalanki, haul of congress, neuyark shahar main bheed ko chitrit karne main asafal rahaa
 Probably a major reason for this disappointment was John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence, which gained popularity in the 1820s
 sambhavatya kuch logon ne america sarkaar ke aantarik kriyapranali kii prashansa nahin kii 
 Morse received a high degree of respect for making paintings of the Marquis de Lafayette, who were the main supporters of the American Revolution
 ve ek aise vyakti kaa bhavy chitra bananaa chaahate the jisane ek mukt or swatantra america kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kii
 In his portrait, he depicts Lafayette with a beautiful sunset, showing three munchies, two of which depict Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, and the third is preserved for him
 unke neeche ek shantipurna lakdi kaa dhalaan dikhaaya gaya he, jo pachaas saal ke baad kii america shanti or vruddhi ko chihnit karata he
 The growing friendship between Morse and Lafayette and the discussion of the Revolutionary War influenced the artist upon his return to the city of New York
 
 Morse lived in Europe for three years from 1830–1832, during which he increased his skills in painting and traveled to Italy, Switzerland and France
 antat unhone jo pariyojna chuni vah thi ek hi kenvas par lore kii prasidd 38 chitrakaariyon ko sankshep main chitrit karnaa, jise unhone da geleri of da lore kaa sheershak diya, unhone america lautne par is kaam ko puraa karne kii yojana banaayi thi
 Subsequently during a visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met Louise Daguerre and became interested in his latter's daguerreotype, the first practical means of photography
 morse ne new-yark observar ko is avishkaar kaa varnan karte hue ek patr likhaa, jise vyapak rup se america press main prakashit kiya gaya or isane bahut adhik jaagrukta failaayi
 In 1825, New York City gave Morse $ 1,000 to paint the Marquis de Lafayette, Gilbert du Motier in Washington
 is chitrakaari ko banane ke dauraan, ghode par savaar ek doot unke pita kaa patr laayaa, jisamen keval ek hi line likhi thi, "tumhaari patni mar gayi he"

 When he arrived there, his wife was buried

 During his sea voyage to the house in 1832, Morse met Charles Thomas Jackson of Boston who was well educated in electromagnetism
 jackson ke vidyut chumbak par vibhinn prayogon ko dekhakar, morse ne ekal-taar telegraph kii avadharana kaa vikaas kiya or da geleri of da lore ko ve bhul hi gaye the
 Morse's original telegraph containing the patent application is housed at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institute
 usee samay se morse code duniya main telegraphy kii praathmik bhashaa ban gayi or aankadon ke talbaddh sancharan ke liye abhi bhi maanya he
 William Cook and Professor Charles Whetstone had reached the stage of starting a commercial telegraph before Morse, but they were able to start it only later
 1836 main, england main, cook ne morse ke chaar saal baad ek vidyutiya telegraph ko shuru kiya, lekin yah adhik vittiya sroton se yukt tha
 Cook left his primary subject of physiology
 or teen saptahon ke bheetar ek chota vidyutiya telegraph banaaya
 Whetstone was also experimenting with telegraphy and understood that a single large battery cannot carry a telegraphy signal for long distances

 bharat parishad adhinium 1909 yaa marle-minto sudharbharat parishad adhinium 1909 ko marle-minto sudhaaron ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he kyonki is samay marle bharat sachiv evam lard minto vysarai the
 In the name of both of them it was called marley-minto reforms
 sarkaar dwaara in sudhaaron ko prastut karne ke peeche mukhya do ghatnaye thim
 In October 1906, a Muslim delegation led by Aga Khan met Viceroy Lord Minto and demanded that a separate electoral system be arranged for Muslims and Muslims should be represented in proportion to their population
 pratinidhimandal ne tark diya ki ‘unki samrajya kii seva’ ke liye unhen pruthak saamudayik pratinidhitiv diya jaye
 The Muslim League was founded in Dhaka in 1906 by Nawab Salimullah, Nawab mohsin-ul-mulk and waqar-ul-mulk
 lard minto se milane vaala yah pratinidhimandal sheeghra hi muslim lig main sammilit ho gaya
 The Muslim League taught Muslims to show allegiance to the empire and tried to keep Muslim intellectuals separate from the Congress
 iske atirikt congress dwaara prativarsh sudhaaron kii maang karne, naram dal ko santusht karne, ativaadiyon ke prabhaav ko kam karne tathaa krantikari rashtrawaad ko rokane ke liye bhi sudhaar kiya janaa aavashyak ho gaya tha
 Major Reforms: The main features of the marley-minto Reforms of 1909 were as follows- is adhinium ke anusaar, kendriya evam prantiy vidhaan parishadon main nirvaachit sadasyon kii sankhya main vruddhi kar di gayi
 a non-governmental majority was established in the provincial legislative councils
 kintu gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon main namankit evam bina chune sadasyon kii sankhya adhik thi, jiske kaaran nirvaachit sadasyon kii tulana main abhi bhi unki sankhya adhik bani rahi
 According to Sumit Sarkar, there were 60 members and 9 ex-officio members in the Central Council of Administrators
 in 69 sadasyon main se 37 sarkari adhikari or 32 gaiyr-sarkari sadsy the
 Of the 32 non-government members, 5 were nominated and 27 were elected members
 nirvaachit 27 sadasyon main se 8 siten pruthak nirvachan kshetra ke antargat muslimon ke liye arakshit thim, jabaki 4 siten british puunjipatiyon ke liye tathaa 2 siten jameendaaron ke liye arakshit thim or 13 siten saamaanya nirvachan ke antargat aati thim
 Elected members were elected indirectly
 sthaneey nikaayon se nirvachan parishad kaa gathan hota tha
 They elected members of the provincial legislative councils
 prantiy vidhaan parishadon ke sadsy kendriya vyavasthapika ke sadaston kaa nirvachan karte the
 a separate community representation system for Muslims was implemented by this act
 saath hi musalamaanon ko pratinidhitiv ke maamle main vishesh riyaayat di gayi
 He was empowered to send more representatives in proportion to the population in the Central and Provincial Legislative Councils
 muslim matadaataaon ke liye aay kii yogyata ko bhi hinduon kii tulana main kam rakhaa gaya
 The powers of legislative assemblies were increased
 sadasyon ko aarthik prastaavon par bahes karne, unke vishyon main sanshodhan prastaav rakhane, unako kuch vishyon par matdaan karne, prashn poochne, saadhaaran prashnon par matdaan karne, saadhaaran prashnon par bahes karne tathaa saarvajanik hit ke prastaavon ko prastut karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Even after giving so much authority to the administrators, the Governor General and the Governors had the right to reject the proposals in the Administrators
 governor general kii kaaryakarini main ek bhartiya sadsy ko niyukt karne kii vyavastha kii gayi
 Satyendra Sinha was appointed as the first Indian member
 sudhaar kii samiksha The reforms of 1909 could neither solve the Indian political question nor did it emerge from it
 apratyaksh chunaav, simit matadhikaar tathaa vidhaan parishad kii simit shaktiyon ne pratinidhi sarkaar ko mishran sa bana diya
 Lord Marley categorically stated that India is not fit for self-government
 congress dwaara prativarsh swashaasan kii maang karne ke pashchaat bhi marle ne spasht taur par use thukraa diya
 He categorically opposed the establishment of parliamentary governance or responsible government in India
 usne kaha ‘yadi yah kaha jaye ki sudhaaron ke is adhyay se bharat main sidhe athwa avashyambhavi sansadeey vyavastha sthapit karne athwa hone main sahaayta milegi to meraa isse koi sambandh nahin hoga’ 
 In fact, the main objective of the reforms of 1909 was to confuse the liberals and divide the nationalist party and destroy the national unity by adopting the communal electoral system
 sarkaar in sudhaaron dwaara narampanthiyon evam musalamaanon ko laalach dekar rashtrawaad ke ufaan ko rokna chahta thi
 Whenever the government and Muslim leaders held bilateral talks, the main theme of this was a separate electoral system, but in reality only a small section of Muslims could benefit from this system
 is adhinium ke antargat jo paddati apanaai gayi vah itani aspasht thi ki jan pratinidhitiv pranali ek prakaar kii bahut si channiyon main se chaanane kii kriya ban gayi
 Some people used to elect local bodies, these members elected election boards, and these elections elected members of the provincial councils and the members of the provincial councils elected the members of the central council
 sudhaaron ko karyanvit karte huye bahut si gadabadiyaan utpann ho gayin
 The parliamentary system was given but no accountability was given, so that the Indian leaders made the legislatures a platform to bitterly criticize the government
 keval gopal krishna gokhale jaise kuch bhartiya netaa hi is avasar kaa vaastavik upyog kar sake
 He used this platform in the true sense by raising issues like primary education for all, criticism of the oppressive policies of the government and atrocities on Indian laborers in South Africa
 yadhyapi is adhinium dwaara chunaav pranali ke siddhant ko bharat main pehali baar manyata mili, governor general kii kaaryakari parishad main pehali baar bharatiyon ko pratinidhitiv mila tathaa kendriya evam prantiy vidhaan parishadon ke sadasyon ko kuch simit adhikaar pradaan kiye gaye kintu adhinium kii ausat uplabdhiyaan naganya hi raheen
 The reforms of 1909 brought only 'nominal' reforms to the public, nothing in reality
 isse prabhaav to mila par shakti nahin
 The responsibility of governance was delegated to other class and power to other class
 aisi sthiti paidaa ho gayi ki vidhanmandal tathaa kaaryakarini ke bich kadavaahat bad gayi tathaa bharatiyon or sarkaar ke sambandh or badtar ho gayi
 With the reforms of 1909, the people wanted something else, they got something else
 bharatiyon ne swashaasan kii maang kii tathaa unhen ‘hitvaadi nirankushta’ saunp di gayi
 Regarding these reforms, Mahatma Gandhi said 'marley-minto reforms have destroyed us'

 mongol lipi, jise uigurgin bhi kehete hai, mongol bhashaa ko likhane kii sarvapratham lipi or varnmaala thi
 It was developed with an ancient script used for the Uygur language and for a long time held the status of the most important script for writing the Mongol language
 san 1646 main roosi prabhaav se mongol likhane ke liye sirilik lipi kaa istemaal shuru ho gaya or dhire-dhire mongol lipi kaa prayog khatm hota chalaa gaya
 Originally the words in the Mongol script were written from top to bottom, but in the modern era it is often written left-to-right
 kuch anya bhashaaon ne bhi mongol lipi ko lekar us par apni lipiyon ko aadhaarit kiya
 a major example of this is the Manchu language whose Manchu script was based on this Mongol script
 iske alaava shibe, oirat or avenki ne bhi apni lipiyaan mongol lipi se banaai
 Before the Mongols, the Naiman people were already using the Uygur script
 san 1204 main naimanon ke saath mongolon ke yuddh kiya or usamen tartar-tonga naam ke ek uigur lekhak ko bandi bana liya jo naiman sarkaar main kar-vasuuli vibhaag chalaane kii zimmedaari rakhata tha
 He made the Mongols aware of the Uygur script
 kuch sainkadon saalon tak lipi main koi parivartan nahin hua, haalanki yah lipi mongol dhvaniyon ko puri tarah dikhne main sakasham nahin thi
 Gradually, the script introduced new characters appropriate to the Mongol language
 mongolon ne puraani lipi ko is nai lipi se alag bataane ke liye use 'uigurgin' kaa naam de diya
 There is a strong emphasis on Buddhism in Mongolia and in the Mongol community of the Inner Mongolia State of China, due to which they have religious connections with Sanskrit and Tibetan languages
 sanskrit or tibeti swaron ko likhane ke liye mongol lipi main kuch anya akshar bhi jode gaye the
 When the Mongolian script was added to Unicode, these special letters were also arranged in it
 unicode main U+1800 se U+18AF tak kii jagah mongol lipi ke liye arakshit he

 Rajan isa ebn mariyam yaa isa messiah, islam ke anusaar, allaah dwaara, maanav jati ko bheje gaye pegambaron main se ek hai, joki isai dharm ke pramukh vyaktitvon main se ek hai
 Jesus is one of the 25 prophets of Islam mentioned in the Quran
 islamic dharamshastra ke anusaar, isa ko mohammad ke baad dusre sabase mahatvapurn sthaan par rakhaa jaataa he
 Almost all of the divine events associated with his autobiography in the Bible are considered in Islam, including: birth from virgin, his miracles, his crucifixion, death and resurrection
 haalaanki quran ke kuch vivochanon ke anusaar, cross par chadhaanaa, mrityu or mritotthana jaaysi ghatnaayen nahin hui thi
 However, Muslims against Christians do not consider Jesus to be a godhead or trinity
 islam main isa messiah ko ek aadarneey nabi mana jaataa he, jo ishwar ne israeliyon ko unke sandesh failaane ko bheja tha
 According to the Quran, Allah gave Jesus the Book of Evil Salt Holy Book, which according to Islamic belief, is one of the four holy books provided by Allah to humanity
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunwari mata dwaara janma maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus, like all prophets, is considered a mere mortal, and, like Christian belief, is not considered a god-son or member of the Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or swayan isa main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ has been called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to earth and exercise justice
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 The name of Jesus appears in the Quran 25 times
 suraah mariyam main inke janm kii katha he or isi tarah suraah ali imran main bhi
 The Qur'an mentions Jesus more than Muhammad
 islam main isa kaa cross par chadhana, mrityu or unka punaragaman bahut mahatv rakhata he adhikansh muslmaan, unki mrityu or punaragaman ko nahin maanate
 a large number of Muslims believe that these verses of the Quran, which mention the death of Christ, are just idioms
 adhinaansh ulema kaa kahana he ki messiah ke cross par nahin chadhaaya gaya tha, balki unhen jananath main uthaa liya gaya
 While some other Ulema believe that after his death, he was resurrected by God and then taken to Jannat
 lekin is par sabhi musalmaan ulema kii sahmati he ki messiah qayamat samay, punah dharti par aaenge or ishwar kii ichha ke anusaar dharti par islam lagu karenge

 As a result, tropical cyclones help maintain the balance of the Earth's troposphere and maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide
 kai ushnkaribandheey chakravaat tab viksit hote he jab vaataavaran main ek kamazor updrav ke aasapaas ke vaataavaran kii sthiti anukool hoti he
 The background environment increases due to climatic cycles and examples such as the Medan – Julian oscillation, the El Niño – Southern oscillation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation
 anya kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab anya prakaar ke chakravaat ushnkaribandheey visheshtaon ko uparjit kar lete hai
 Tropical systems when removed from the circulation of winds in the troposphere; If the environments remain favorable, tropical disturbance intensifies and an eye can also develop

 ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke kendron par record kiya gaya dabaav samudr str par prithvi kii sataha par hone vaale dabaavon main sabase kam hota he
 Tropical cyclones are largely characterized and driven by the release of the underlying heat of condensation, which occurs when moist air is carried upward and its water vapor freezes
 yah garmi tufaan ke centre ke chaaron ore khadi vitarit kii jaati he
 Thus, the environment within a cyclone at a given altitude is warmer than its external environment
 ek tej ushnkaribandheey chakravaat sanchalan ke centre main duubate hue hawa ke ek kshetra ko sharan degaa
 If this area is strong enough, it can develop into a large "eye"
 The weather inside the eye is generally calm and devoid of clouds, although the sea can be extremely violent
 netra saamaanya rup se aakaar main gol hota he or aakaar main 3 kilometre se 370 kilometre vyas ke bich kaa hota he
 Intense, mature tropical cyclones sometimes exhibit an outward rotation of the top of an eyewall and resemble a football stadium; This process is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect
 anya suvidhaayen bhi hai jo yaa to netra ko chaaron ore se gher leti he, yaa ise dhak leti hai
 The central dense overcast is a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone; In weak tropical cyclones, CDO can completely cover the center
 iwal netra ke chaaron ore tej jhanjavat kaa ek chakra he; yah vahi jagah he jahaan sarvaadhik teevr hawaaen pai jaati he, jahaan badal sabase oonche sthaan par pahunch jate he or tivrata sabase baari hoti he
 The heaviest wind damage occurs where the eyewall of a tropical cyclone passes over land
 iwal pratisthaapan chakra teevr ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton main swaabhaavik rup se hote hai
 When cyclones reach the peak of intensity they usually have an eyewall and a maximum wind radius that shrinks to a very small size, ranging from about 10 kilometers to 25 kilometers
 bahya varsha-pattee ek jhanjavat kaa ek bahari ring bana sakati he jo dhire dhire andar kii ore hatati jaati he or bhitari yaaol se aavashyak nami or koniya gati ko chin leti he
 When the inner eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone also weakens the outer eyewall completely replacing the inner eyewall at the end of the cycle
 tufaan ek hi tivrata ke ho sakate he jais ki vah pehle the yaa iwal pratisthaapan chakra ke purna hone ke baad pehle se zyada teevr bhi ho saktaa he
 The storm may intensify again as it again constructs a new outer ring for the next eyewall replacement

 If the radius is two degrees less than the axis, or 222 kilometers, then the cyclone is "very small" or a "dwarf"
 3 or 6 akshansh degree ke bich kii ek trigya yaa 333 kilometre se 670 kilometre "ausat aakaar" kaa mana jaataa he
 "very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of more than 8 degrees or a radius of 888 kilometers

 Other methods of determining a tropical cyclone shape include measuring the radius of thunderstorm winds and measuring its corresponding VORTCT area radius
 Measuring winds included in the radius of a center thunderstorm force and measuring its radius with a relative area of −1
 Vorticity decreases to −5 1 × 10

 Therefore, a tropical cyclone can be seen as a massive vertical heat engine that is driven by physical mechanics forces such as the Earth's gravity and rotation
 ek anya rup main, ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko ek vishesh prakaar ke messoskale sanvahani sankul ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo saapeksh nami or garmi ke ek vishaal strot ke upar bananaa jari rahata he
 While an initial hot core system, such as an organized storm system, is necessary for the formation of a tropical cyclone, a flow of energy is required to reduce atmospheric pressure
 Strengthening the inherent moisture and heat flow from the ocean surface is important for tropical cyclones
 chakravaat main aavak kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag vayumandal ke sabase nichle 1 kilometre main he
 Condensation leads to high wind speeds, a fraction of the energy released as mechanical energy, strong winds and the low pressure associated with them leads to increased surface evaporation and thus even more condensation
 Most of the energy released rises which increases the height of storm clouds and increases condensation
 yah sakaaratmak pratikriya tab tak ke liye jari rahati he jab tak ushnkaribandheey chakravaat vikaas ke liye sthitiyaan anukool hoti hai
 Factors such as the constant lack of equilibrium in the distribution of air amount will provide the support energy for the cyclone

 The fact that distinguishes tropical cyclones mainly from other seasonal events is intense convection as an induction force
 Because convection is strong in tropical climates, it defines the initial domain of tropical cyclones
 iske vipareet, madhya akshansh chakravaat purv maujuud kshaitij taapmaana se apni zyaadaatar urja aakarshith karte hai
 In order to keep its heat engine running, a tropical cyclone must remain above the hot water, which provides the atmospheric moisture needed so that the positive feedback loop remains on
 jab ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhoomi se gujarata he, iskaa taap strot isse cat jaataa he or yah apni takat kho detaa he
 The passing of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layer of the sea to cool down significantly, which can subsequently affect the growth of the cyclone
 yah sheetaleekaran mukhya rup se hawa kii vajah se samudr kii gaharaai se thande pani ke upar uthne se hota he
 Cold water weakens the storm
 yah ek nakaaratmak punarnivesh prakriya he jo apane swayan ke prabhaav kii vajah se toofaan ko samudr ke upar kamazor karti he
 Rainwater releases energy at a rate of excess freezing that can be equal to 1 PW

 Although the movement of the clouds is clearly towards the center, in tropical cyclones the flow of clouds develops even at an upper level
 yah tufaan ingine kii "chimney" ke madhyam se ucch oonchai par utpann hota he ki hawa isaki nami kii or ke madhyam se nishkasit hoti he
 This outflow produces thin cirrus clouds that move away from the center
 badal kaaphi patale hote hai or surya uske madhyam se dikhaai de saktaa he
 These high cirrus clouds may be an early sign of a tropical cyclone

 There are low amounts of wind shear, high fleece circulation is needed as storm is disruptive
 Tropical cyclones generally need more than 555 km of latitude 5 or far from the equator to form, allowing the Coriolis circulation to deflect another from the effects of winds blowing towards lower pressures Center construction
 Lastly, the current system of an early tropical cyclone season needs a disturbed prior, although no development cyclone will take place without circulation
 Disturbances associated with low-latitude and low-level westerly Madden – Julian oscillation wind can make tropical conditions favorable for cyclogensis initiated by the tropics

 Tropical cyclones migrate westward to the subtropical ridge of Acuntoword, intensifying as they move
 Most of these systems form between 10 and 30 degrees away from the equator and 87% form no further than 20 degrees south, latitude or north
 Because the Coriolis effect initiates cyclones and the tropical cyclone rotates, the tropical form is rarely the weakest or the Coriolis effect where it moves about 5 degrees within the equator
 However, it is possible for the Vamis to form cyclones within this range as Tropical Storm Tropical Cyclones in 2001 and in 2004

 In the equator, the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, tropical cyclogenesis is strongly influenced by the seasonal movement of the eastward, rather than the trough monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone
 Tropical cyclones could also be steered by other systems, such as other low-pressure systems, high-pressure front systems, and cold front s

 This system causes cyclone acceleration to turn the poles in the strong absence of steering currents
 The eastern part of a tropical cyclone incorporates poleward winds and the Coriolis effect pulls them slightly more poleward

 When the subtropical ridge crosses a tropical cyclone axis, its high pressure area around the general track of the pressure zone is significantly deflected again by the winds towards the lower normal
 When the cyclone becomes a track component, with a vigorous poleward to the east, cyclone recirculation has begun

 Officially, landfall is when a storm center crosses the beach not its edge
 Hurricane conditions may be experienced on the coast, and hours before inland landfall, in fact, a tropical cyclone may just start its strong winds over land, not to make landfall, if it does
 It is said that the storm made a direct hit on the coast
 As a result of the narrowness of this definition, the landfall area experiences half of a land-bound storm by real-time landfall
 For emergency preparations, the action should be from the time when a certain wind speed will reach the ground, or the intensity of rainfall will not occur since landfall

 Weak or diffusion shear wind can occur if it experiences, due to the engine stepping away from between convection and heat, it normally develops a tropical cyclone
 Additionally, its interaction with the main belt of westerly wind, by means of merging together near the frontal region, can cause tropical cyclones to develop into extratropical cyclones

 Earlier in an episode in 1947, disaster struck Zachsonville when a hurricane preceded, Florida changed its course immediately after being seeded and smashed in Georgia, smashed
 Because there is so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government will not accept seeding operations until there is a less than 10% chance of landfall within 48 hours of the storm, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms 
 The first attempt of the project was dropped after it was discovered that the naturally occurring replacement cycle in ivol cast doubt on the outcome of the Hurricanes, casting
 Today, it is known that seeding silver yodid is very unlikely to have a possibility because the effect of a soft amount of water in the rhombunds is tropical cyclone

 Although cyclones take a heavy toll in property and personal life, they may be important factors in precipitation regimes, as they may bring much needed precipitation to dry areas otherwise
 Tropical cyclones also help maintain global heat balance by moving the hot, moist tropics and mid-latitudes of the polar regions
 Hurricanes and the rise winds of Hurricanes can be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding sites
 The destruction of tropical cyclones prevents redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values

 Images from infrared tropical cyclones off the ground are tracked from space and satellite capturing the visible interval of space, usually half an hour to a quarter of an hour
 As a hurricane approaches the land, it can be observed by Doppler radar-based land
 Radar plays an important role by showing a hurricane landfall around the location and intensity of every minute

 Before the Hurricanes or satellite era, in the early 1960s, tropical storms went undetected until a reconnaissance aircraft encountered a storm, a ship or a storm, reported a trip through the hurricane hit the country in a populated area
 Government records, therefore, may recall storms in which no ship experienced thunderstorm power winds, it reported recognition as a tropical storm, returned harbor and experience

 Hurricane Destructivity is a measure of the combination of surface storm strength, duration and correlated high frequency, with the possibility of "tropical ocean temperatures," an article stated in Carrie Emanuel's Nature, reflecting well-documented climate and signs in the Atlantic North , Including Multidecadal Oscillations North Pacific and Global Warming "
 Emanuel predicts "a significant increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century
 In the more recent work published in the March 2008 issue of the Bulletin of Emanuel, he states that new climate modeling data indicates that global warming should occur
 Hurricanes' global frequency "new work suggests that, even in the world, a dramatic warming, hurricane frequency and intensity will not increase significantly in the next two centuries

 However, there is no agreement regarding the magnitude of the effects of anthropogenic global warming on tropical cyclone formation, track is universal and intensity
 For example, critics such as Chris Lundsa insist that man-made variability "will be observed significantly smaller than the larger natural effects of hurricanes"

 a tropical cyclone can become extratropical, because if its energy source, the heat released by condensation, causes a variation in temperature between the air segments it extends upward; In addition, extratropical cyclones can also transform into a tropical storm and then form a tropical cyclone, although this is not often the case

 The Tattvasamasutra is believed to be composed by his commentator Kapil

 That is why Maxmüller described him as very ancient

 Prior to this, there is lack of strong evidence for its condition

 Kaapudiprabha's Karta Swapneshwar considers the 'sankhyaprakshutra' to be the work of the Panchashikha and says that this book was created by Kapil because it is believed that Kapil is the originator of Sankhya

 But the description of Sankhyakrakshutra is not in Madhava's 'sarvadarsanasangraha' and neither in Gunaratna itself has given a description of Sankhya

 But by mentioning them in the Gita, they seem more ancient

 According to the tradition, the said Asuri was preached in Nirmanikatta and he preached philosophy
 nirmaanchitt kaa arth hota he siddhi ke dwaara apane chitt ko swechha se nirmit kar lenaa
 It is known from this, Kapil did not preach in front of Asuri in an interview, but in the knowledge of Asuri, his propounded principles were recollected, hence he is called the Guru of 'asuri'
 mahabharat main ye sankhya ke vaktaa kahe gaye hai
 He is also said to be the incarnation of Agni and the Manasaputra of Brahma

 Kapilvastu, where the Buddha was born, was a city named after Kapil and the son of Sagara saw Kapil on the banks of the ocean and found his curse and later there the Ganges confluence with the ocean
 isse maaloom hota he ki kapil kaa janmasthan sambhavat: kapilwastu or tapasyakshetra gangasagar tha
 From this, it is possible to say at least that Kapila's name had spread before the Buddha

 But this rendering is not in order, it only points to some theories that were later incorporated into the Samkhya theory
 kapil ko adisiddh athwa siddhesh kehane kaa arth yah he ki sambhavat: kapil ne hi sarvapratham dhyaan or tapasya kaa maarg batalaaya tha
 His first karma was a path and knowledge was limited to discussion only
 gyaan ko sadhana kaa rup dekar kapil ne tyaag, tapasya evam samadhi ko bhartiya samskruti main pehali baar pratishthit kiya
 Prakriti and Purush are the two elements considered in Sankhya
 prakruti ko satv, rajas or tamas in teen gunon se nirmit kaha gaya he
 Triguna is created by its equilibrium, nature and its contrast
 sristi main kuch nayaa nahin he, sab prakruti se hi utpann he
 The world is just the result of nature
 satkaryawad or parinamwad ke pravartak ke rup main sankhya kii prasiddhi he
 The creation of a person is contrasted with nature with the mere affection of man
 prakruti jad he-purush chetan, prakruti karta he-purush niskriy
 Like the combination of the long and the blind, there is the combination of man and nature
 purush chetan he or apana bimb prakruti main dekhakar apane ko hi karta samajhataa he or isi agyaan ke bandhan main padakar du:kha bhogata he, moh ko praapt hota he
 The moment a man comes to know that he is not a doer, a disinterested, a passive witness, the drama of nature ends for him
 agyaanjanya karmbandh se mukt hokar apane keval rup ko jaan lenaa kaivalya yaa moksh he or yahi param purusharth he
 When liberated, nature is unimportant for the free man, but for other worldly man it is true because nature is not destroyed
 yahi kaaran he ki sankhya main naanaa purush maane gaye hai
 According to the Puranas and 'sankhyaprakshutras', a Purushottama is also considered above men
 yah purushottam yaa ishwar purush ko moksh detaa he
 But according to the oldest available Sankhya treatise 'sankhyakarika', God has no place in Sankhya
 spashtat: kapil bhi nirishvaravaadi the, seshwar sankhya kaa vikaas baad main hua
 Twenty-five elements are considered in Sankhya
 purush, purush kii sannidhiyukt prakruti se mahat yaa buddhi, buddhi se ahankaar, ahankaar se paanch tanmatraayen athwa sookshm bhoot or man, paanch tanmatraaon se paanch gyanendriyaan, paanch karmedriyaan or paanch sthoolbhoot utpann hote hai
 Nature does not originate from any of these, important ego and system, they originate from seven nature and also generate other elements
 baaki solah tatv keval utpann hai, kisi nae tatv ko janm nahin dete
 Therefore, they are considered to be sixteen vices, nature is invariable, importance etc
 The seven elements themselves are vicious and also cause disorder
