 The creature is created by its neutral power and the world is created by Mayashakti

 Ignorance of the organism is destroyed in salvation, but the world remains

 The culture of Hadramaut province resembles the Zofar province of the neighboring Oman country
 in donon kshetron ke logon ko 'hdaramuti' bulaayaa jaataa he or yah dakshini arabi bhashaa kii hdaramuti upbhasha bolte hai
 ‘hadramaut’ is spelled ‘حضرموت’ in Arabic script with the last letter ‘ض’ pronounced ‘z’ in the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan and Iran, while in Arab countries it is pronounced ‘d’ or ‘dh’
 It is similar
 isliye is kshetra or praant ke naam ko - 'hdaramout', 'hadharamout' or 'hazaramout' - teenon uccharanon ke saath paaya jaataa he
 The exact difference of pronunciation is also seen in the word 'ramzan' which is found in both 'ramazan' and 'ramadan' forms

 Various authors were particularly influenced by the works of Edmund Kendler Kipling
 ties iliyat ek bahut alag kavi hai or unhone e choes of kipolings vars ko sampadit kiya tha haalanki iske dauraan unhone tippanee kii ki ittfaaq se hi sahi lekin " kuch avasaron par acchhee kavita likhte hai"

 The scouting movements were greatly strengthened by Kipling's involvement

 After the death of Kipling's wife in 1939, his Burmese, Batemans home in East Sussex was inherited by the National Trust and now a public museum dedicated to the author
 unke teen bacchon main sirf elsi hi thi jo attharah varsh se zyada bachi hui thi or 1976 main niqusantan hi unki mrityu ho gai or neshnal trust ko swaamitv kaa adhikaar mil gaya
 And there is also an advanced Kipling Society in the United Kingdom and Australia

 Amis's vision of Chesterton was also about Kipling's career: the importance of writing has been introduced, similar to his view in Kipling's case from the period 1885–1902
 1902 main betman main sthanantarit hone ke baad se hi keval unke rachana main hi giravat nahin ai balki kipoling vishwa main teji se ai kathinaaiyon main apane aap ko paaya or amis is parivartan ke liye ghar ke niraashajanak maahaul ko jimmedaar bataate hai
 His reputation in modern India, where he composed most of his concrete works, is particularly controversial among modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics

 rudyard kipoling kii pustakon ke kai puraane sanskarnon ke cover main camel phool liye ek hathi kii tasviir ke saath swastika mudrit he
 From the 1930s, it began to emerge that Kipling was wrongly considered a Nazi supporter, although the Nazi Party did not adopt the swastika symbol until 1920
 kipoling ke swastika kaa upyog kaa aadhaar bhartiya suraj pratik tha jo saubhaahgya or kalyaan pradaan karata he; 
 unhone swastik chihn kaa upyog daaen or baayen abhimukh rup se kiya or us samay iskaa upyog saamaanya tha
 Even before the Nazis came to power, Kipling ordered the engraver to remove it from the printing block so that he would not be perceived as supporting them
 Just a year before his death, Kipling gave a speech at The Royal Society of St
 George on 6 May 1935, in which he warned of pretending to Britain of dangerous Nazi Germany

 a political party or political party is a political institution that tries to gain and maintain political power in governance
 iske liye praaia: vah chunaav kii prakriya main bhaag letaa he
 Political parties have their own principle or goal which is often in the form of written documents

 In some countries there is no political party
 kahin ek hi dal sarvesarva hota he
 Somewhere there are mainly two teams
 kintu bahut se deshon main do se adhik dal hote hai
 The place of political parties is very important as a central concept in a democratic political system
 rajnatik dal kisi samaaj vyavastha main shakti ke vitaran or satta ke aakankshi vyaktiyon evam samoohon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 They have been the principal means of tabulation, discipline and cohesion of conflicting interests
 is tarah se rajnatik dal samaaj vyavastha ke lakshyon, saamaajik gatishiltaa, saamaajik parivartanon, parivartanon ke avarodhon or saamaajik aandolanon se bhi sambandhit hote hai
 Political parties are studied by both sociologists and political scientists, but there is a substantial difference in their perspectives
 samajashastri rajnatik dal ko saamaajik samooh maanate hai jabaki raajnneetijna raajnneetik dalon ko aadhunik rajya main sarkaar banane kii ek pramukh sanstha ke rup main dekhte hai
 The structure of a political party has certain characteristics that distinguish it from other groups - uparyukt lakshanon dwaara raajnneetik dal ko anya sanghathan se bhinn karke dekh sakate hai
 The formation of a political party is found by two characteristics of social order - mauris duverjar ne raajnneetik dal ke saamaajik sanghathan kaa mahatvapurn vishleshan prastut kiya he
 They have tried to explain the organization of the party by four-point classification

 atah iske khyaati praapt sadasyon kii sankhya kii apeksha unka prabhaav evam kshamta adhik mahatvapurn he
 Duverger cited the French Radical Party and the pre-1918 British Labor Party as examples of this

 Therefore, it is always interested in recruiting more and more members
 inaki raajnneetik sankriyataayen keval chunaav tak hi simit nahin hoti apitu nirantar chalati rahati hai
 The branch is a larger group than the caucus, so its organization is more and it has more integration than the caucus

 Historians consider seven such crush wars

 The main destination of the journey was the large church in Jerusalem, built by the mother of the first Christian emperor Constantain of Rome in the fourth century, near the tomb of Christ

 In the seventh century, Islam was propagated at great speed and the successor caliphs of the Prophet established their rule over near and far countries

 This situation changed in the 11th century
 madhya asian turk jati kii itani janavruddhi hui ki vah or faili tathaa islam dharm grahan kar liya
 Especially during this time, the Saljuq Turks greatly increased their power from the Caspian Sea to Jerusalem
 udhar purv main turkon kii ek duusari shakha ne sultan mahmud ke netritv main bharat par akraman kiya or uskaa pashchimottar bhaag dabaa liya
 The Saljuqs also occupied the internecine Palestine of many countries, and Jerusalem and its holy places became subject to it in 1071 AD
 is samay se isaayiyon kii yatra kathin or ashankapurna ho gai
 On the other hand, the power of the Norman race developed in Western Europe
 narman england ke shaasha ban gaye; france ke ek bhaag par ve pehle se hi chhaae hue the, 1070 ke lagbhag unhone sicili, dweep musalamaanon se jeeta or usase mila hua italy kaa dakshini bhaag bhi dabaa liya
 Consequently, the Mediterranean Sea, which was under pressure from the Muslim rulers of North Africa, opened up to Christians of this time
 italy ke kai swantatra nagar vaanijya main kushal the or ab or bhi unnatisheel ho gaye
 Their navy grew and the Christians also got a new route to their sacred land
 par isai main prabal foot bhi thi
 In 395 AD, the Roman Empire was divided into two parts
 pashchimi bhaag, jisaki rajdhani rome thi, 476 main uttar kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman se tut gaya
 But the influence of the Pope remained constant and greatly increased when these nations became Christians; Even the Pope had unquestioned dominance over Western Europe
 iske shaasha pope se aashirwad praapt karte the or yadi pope aprasann hokar kisi shaasha kaa bahishkaar karata, to use kathin praayshchitt karnaa hota tha or prachur dhan dand ke rup main pope ko dena padataa tha

 isai jagat ke purvi bhaag kii rajdhani kustutuniyaan main thi or vahaan greek jati ke samrat shashan karte the
 Apart from Eastern Europe, his kingdom was also on Asia Minor
 turko ne asia miner ke adhikansh bhaag par kabja kar liya tha, keval rajdhani ke nikat kaa or kuch samudratat kaa kshetra roman samrat ke paas rah gaya tha
 The emperor sought the help of Western Christians in this crisis
 rome kaa pope swayan hi pavitra bhoomi ko turko se mukt karaane kaa icchhuk tha
 An influential campaigner enthused the public for the crusades in France and Italy
 falswaroop lagbhag chah lakh krushdhar prastut ho gaye
 The religious differences in the eastern and western parts of the Christian world were so great that in 1054 the Pope of Rome and Patriarch of the city of Costantin castigated each other
 pashchim kaa unnatisheel raajnneetik dal purvi samrat ko, jo unani tha, nikamma samajhataa tha
 His belief was that only with the establishment of Norman rule in this empire could Turkey win the war
 in virodhon tathaa matbhedon kaa krush yudhon ke itihaas par gaharaa prabhaav padaa

 unke paas bhojan saamagree or parivahan saadhan kaa abhaav hone ke kaaran ve maarg main lut khasot or yahudiyon kii hatya karte gaye jiske falswaroop bahuterey maare bhi gaye
 Seeing this trend, the eastern emperor took him across the Basphorus without waiting for another party when he reached Constantine city
 vahaan se badhkar jab ve turko dwaara shasit kshetra main ghuse to, maare gaye
 The second party was the armies of many well-deserved feudatories from Western Europe who reached Constantine by different routes
 inke naam is prakaar hai:- The eastern emperor promised these armies in exchange for the facilities of navigation and military support, and promised them that the former territories of the empire, which were captured by the Turks, would be given to the emperor if they were won
