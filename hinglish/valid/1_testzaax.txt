 Nepal used to be huge during the ancient Khaskal and Kirant period and Sima used to be Kamaru in the east, Kamaksha, Katur in the south and Kangra in the west and the truth of this can be known from chapter 81 of Skanda Purana
 skanda puraana ke is adhyay main spasht ullekh he ki nepal ki simaayein kahan se kahan tak thim
 The fact that the truth can be traced back to the Atharvaveda even 1000 years ago and this is confirmed in Kautilya's Arthashastra also

 kiraant kaal kaa ant or lichchhaviyon kaa nepal main shashan shuru hona nepal ke liye ek durbhaagya tha
 At the end of the reign of the Lichchhavis, they became so powerful that Nepal was divided into 53 pieces
 lichchhaviyon ke baad mall vansh kaa shashan aayaa par wo bhi nepal kaa ekikaran karne main naakaam rahen
 The rule of the Malla dynasty was followed by the rise of the Shah dynasty in Nepal
 shah vansh ke kaal ko nepal ke aadhunik yug ki shuruyaat bhi kehete hai
 Divided into 53 pieces, there was a fragment in Nepal itself which was known as Gorkha dominion
 gorkha ke raja thea prithvinarayan shah
 Prithvinarayan Shah decided to reunite Nepal divided into 53 pieces and started a campaign of Nepal integration
 vikram samvat 1799 main prithvinarayan shah gorkha ke raja bane us ke ek saal baad hi padosi rajya nuvakot par prithvinarayan shah ne hamalaa bol diya or vijay hasil ki or isi ke saath ekikaran kaa abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 He later conquered the Sena kingdom of Makwanpur in Vikram Samvat 1819 and succeeded in assimilating it into his kingdom, and excitedly attacked Kirtipur in 1823 and also set the victory flag on Kirtipur
 isi ke saath vikram samvat 1825 main lagaataar kantipur, lalitpur tathaa 1826 main bhaktpur ko apane adhikaar main lekar teenon rajyon ko jod kar kathmandu upatyaka banaaya or kathmanduko apni rajdhani banaaya
 After that Prithvinarayan Shah turned his attention to Nepal integration and conquered Chaudandi in Vikram Samvat 1830
 agle varsh vijaipur rajyako ekikaran kar purv taraf kii sima ko mechi ke aas-paas pahunchaaya
 After the death of Prithvinarayan Shah, his elder son Pratap Singh Shah included Chittavan in Nepal, but due to his death soon, the minor queen Bahadur Shah became the king of Nepal
 naebi ke rup main rajmata rajendralakshmi ne shashan kaa door apane haathon main lekar sasur ke ekikaran abhiyaan ko nirantarataa diya
 Vikram Samvat included Lamjung, Tanhu and Kashki in twenty-four states from 1834 to 1842
 rajmata rajendralakshmi ke mrityu ke baad naabalak ran bahadoor ke naebi main prithvinarayan shah kaa chota ladkaa bahadoor shah satta main aaye or unhone apane pita ke ekikaran abhiyaan ko purv taraf ke sima ke paas ke sikkim kaa teen tihaai bhu-bhaag jit kar tishta nadi tak pahunchaaya

 duusare varsh unhonen gadhwal ki rajdhani srinagar par hamalaa kar ise ashrith rajya banaaya, lekin tibet ke saath hue yuddh ke kaaran yah ekikaran rokna pad
 After the death of Bahadur Shahk, this campaign proceeded under the leadership of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa and General Amar Singh Thapa
 vikram samvat 1861 main srinagar par punah akraman kiya gaya or gadhwal ko purn rup se nepal main sammilit kar liya gaya
 In this way, the western Sima of Nepalak reached the Yamuna River, immediately after that the Nepalese army crossed the Yamuna River and integrated all the 12 small and small kingdoms running between the Yamuna River and the Sutlej River under the name of Thakurai
 vikram samvat 1863 main amar singh thapa ne satluj paar kar vibhinn rajyon ko jitate hue kangra shahar par akraman kiya lekin raavi nadi tak pahunch chuke nepali sena kangra kila ko jit nahin paaya
 In the course of unification, the Nepali army kept King Sansar Chand of Kangra in a siege of Kangra Fort for four years
 baad main sansarchand ke sahaayta ke liye punjab ke raja ranjit singh aae jinke saath nepali sena ne yuddh kiya jis ke falswarup jwalamukhi sandhi kiya gaya or is sandhi ke anusaar nepali sena satluj nadi ke us taraf hat jane ke liye baadhya ho gayi
 In this way the vast Nepal was reunified and the easternmost Sima of Nepal extended to the Tishta River and the western Sima to the Sutlej River
 1 navambar 1814 ko east india compani k taraf se general hestigs ne nepal viruddh vidhivat rup main yuddh ki ghoshnaa kar di
 Amar Singh Thapa had the burden of defense of the far west side in the five-front fronts of the nepal-british bitch and he was handling the war front from this place
 satluj sima ki ore se nepal main akraman karne ke liye karyrat angrej general octor loni ne amar singh thapa ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan die or apane saath milaane ki lakh koshish ki, lekin amar singh thapa angrejon ke pralobhan main nahin phase or vah virtapurvak ladate hue kila ki suraksha karte rahen
 When the British could not control the Sutlej in this way, the British entered the Nepalese land by another war route
 angrej jab satluj par kaabo na kar sake to baad main duusare raste se hokar nalapani ke taraf badhen
 The battle front of Nalapani Fort was on the Balbhadra Kunar
 san 1814 octubar se navambar tak hue bhishan nalapani yuddh main general jilespie sahit 1000 angrej sena maare gaye thea
 Finally, when the Nepalese army could not be defeated with Nepalese war skills, the British cut off the supply of drinking water coming to the fort
 kai dinon tak jab pani pine ko nahin mil paaya to baadhya hokar balbhadra kuker bache hue apane 70 jane yoddhaon sahit nange khukuri ko nachaate hue jab kila se baahar nikle to angrej log chakit ho gayi thea
 After the Nalapani war, a second decisive battle took place at the Deothal Fort in Malone
 angrejon ne apni sampurn shakti lagaai thi is kile ko hathiyaane main or ve safal ho gayi baad main 70 varsh kaat chuke vir yodgha bhakthi thapa pun: is kile ko waapas lene ke liye angrejon se bhid gayi lekin angrejon ke top se nikle aag ke golon ko apni chaati pe khate hue wo vahiin shahid ho gayi
 In this way, Nepal won on five front fronts of Nepal and the British won on two fronts
 angrejon ke usee jeet ne nepal ko sugauli sandhi jaise asmaan sandhi par hastakshar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The dispute between the british-east India Company and Nepal arose in the cycle of unification of small states on the border of British India
 jab nepal ne gadhwal or kumaun kaa ekikaran kar liya vahaan kaa shaasha british-east india ke sharan main sahaayta maangne chalaa gaya vaise hi sikkim ke raja ne bhi british-east india se sahaayta maangi thi
 Here the people of Saran district had also complained to the British East India Company about Nepal, as a result, the British declared war against Nepal
 british-east india or nepal sarkaar ke bich yuddh 1814 se 1816 tak chali
 The war took place on 5 fronts, in which Nepal won on 3 fronts and the british-east India Company won on 2 fronts
 nepal ne apni saarvbhaum bachaaye rakhane ke liye is sandhi par hastakshar kiya or purv main tista se mechi nadi ke bich kaa sara bhu-bhaag or pashchim main satluj nadi se mahakali nadi ke saare bhu-bhaag or dakshin ke tarai kaa bhu-bhaag is sandhi ke anurup british east india company kaa ho gaya

 aadhunik kaal main swaniki kaa adhyayan joshua steel tathaa alexender bel aadi ke prayaason se armbh hua
 The shortest unit of language is 'swan'
 ise dhwani naam bhi diya jaataa he
 In the absence of sound, language cannot be imagined
 bhashavigyaan main swan ke adhyayan sandarbh ko ‘swanvigyaan’ kii sangya di jaati he
 The word sound is made up of the sum of the suffixes in the sound metal
 bhashaa vigyaan ke gambhir adhyayan main dhvanivigyaan ek mahatvapurn shakha ban gai he
 For this, the names of phonics, phonics, phonology, phonetics etc
 have been given
 angreji main uske liye 'phonetics' or 'phonology' shabdon kaa prayog hota he
 These two words are formed from the Greek 'phone'
 swan ke adhyayan main teen paksh saamne aate hai- The person or speaker producing the sound is called the self producer
 sangraahak yaa grahankarta shrota hota he, jo dhwani ko grahan karata he
 Conductor or convection medium which is mainly in the form of air waves
 swan prakriya main teenon angon kii anivaaryta swatah siddh he
 When the sound is produced with the help of any two or more dislocations from the various organs of the mouth, only the existence of the sound is possible
 dhwani-utpaadak avyavon kii bhoomika ke abhaav main swan kaa astitv asambhav he
 If there is a lack of conductor or convection medium after the useful role of the sound-producing components, the sensation of sound is impossible
 mana ek vyakti ek vaayu-avarodhi kaksh main baith kar dhwani karata he, to vaayu tarang kaksh se baahar nahin aa paati or baahar kaa vyakti dhwani-grahan nahin kar saktaa he
 Thus the swan process is blocked
 tritiy ang sangraahak yaa shrota ke abhaav main dhwani-utpaadan kaa astitv swatah hi shunya ho jaataa he
 Thus, it is mandatory to have speaker, medium and three in the swan process
 dhwani ke sarthak or nirarthak do swaroop hai
 In linguistics, only meaningful sounds are studied
 dhwani utpaadan prakriya main vaayu mukh yaa naak donon hi bhaagon se nikalati he
 In this way, the sound can be divided into two categories, nasal and non-nasal
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan main vaayu mukh-vivar ke saath nasika-vivar se bhi nikalati he
 It is called resonant sound
 jin dhvaniyon ke uccharan main vaayu keval mukh-vivar se nikle use niranunasik yaa maukhik dhwani kehete hai
 Depending on the intensity and retardation of the sound, it can be divided into three classes: sound, breathing and chanting
 jab dhwani utpaadan main swar tantriyaan ek duusare se mili hoti hai, to vaayu unhen dhakka dekar bich se baahar aati he, aisi dhwani ko naad dhwani kehete hai, yatha-g, gh, j aadi
 It is also called loud sound
 jab swar tantriyaan ek duusare se dur hoti hai to nishwaas kii vaayu bina gharshan ke saralata se baahar aati he
 Such sound is called 'breathing' or aghosha; Such as Q, T, i etc
 jab bahut mand dhwani hoti he to donon swar tantriyon ke kisi kone se vaayu baahar aati he
 Such sound is called chanting sound
 bhashaa-adhyayan main swanvigyaan kaa vishesh mahatva he kyonki anya vrihattar ikaayiyon kaa gyaan iske hi aadhaar par hoti he
 Under this, various sound producing components are studied
 swanon ke shuddh gyaan ke pashchaat shuddh lekhan ko sabal aadhaar mil jaataa he
 It is also possible to have knowledge of changes in various contexts in pronunciation
 swanvigyaan main vibhinn dhvaniyon ke adhyayan ke saath unke utpaadan kii prakriya kaa vistrut vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 In the same study, the composition and role of various sound producing organs are also studied
 dhvanigun or uski sarthakata kaa nirupan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Along with Swan, 'phoneme' is also analyzed
 bhashaa kii uccharnatmak laghuttam ikai akshar ke swaroop or unke vargeekaran par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Different sounds change according to time, situation and usage

 abhigaman tithi:18 janvari 2010 The Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the supreme court and is the apex of the judicial system of Pakistan and is the pinnacle of the Pakistani judicial order
 pakistan kii sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kanoonee or sanvaidhanik maamalon main faisla karne vaali antim madhyasth bhi he
 The permanent office of the Supreme Court is located in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, while many sub-branches of this court are functioning in important cities of Pakistan where cases are heard
 sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan ko kai sanvaidhanik va nyaayik vikalp praapt hote hai, jinaki vyakhya pakistan ke samvidhan main kii gai he
 The Supreme Court has established itself even during the tenure of several military governments and unconstitutional dictatorial governments in the country
 saath hi, is adaalat ne sainya shakti par ek vaastavik nireekshak ke rup main swayan ko sthapit kiya he or kai avasaron main sarkaron kii nigaraanee kii he
 This court has appellate authority over all high courts and federal courts
 iske alaava yah kuch prakaar ke maamalon par mul adhikaar bhi rakhata he
 The Supreme Court is made up of a Chief Justice and a set number of senior judges, who are nominated by the President after consulting the Prime Minister
 ek baar niyukt nyaayadhish ko, ek nirdisht avadhi ko puraa karne or uske baad hi ritair hone kii ummid kii jaati he, jab tak ki ve duraachaar ke kaaran sarvocch nyaayik parishad dwaara nilambit nahin kiye jate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan was established by the 1956 Constitution
 isane 1948 main, aadesh dwaara sthapit, sangheey adaalat kaa navaroop tha
 Since its formation in 1956, it has retained its judicial authority and has been successful in asserting its authority even during the tenure of several Saini governments
 1956 ke samvidhan ke anusaar: ucchtam nyaayalay karanchi main sthapit thi, parantu 1949 main ise lahore main punarsthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan yah maujuuda lahore ucch nyaayalay ke bhawan main kaaryshil tha
 In the 1973 Constitution document, the Supreme Court has been set up in Islamabad and it is hoped that the Supreme Court should be established in the capital of the country
 parantu raashi ke abhaav ke kaaran nyaayalay ke bhawan ko us samay islamabad main nahin nirmit kiya ja sakaa tha
 So in 1974 the court was moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi
 1989 main, sarkaar dwaara islamabad main sarvocch nyaayalay ke nae bhawan ke nirmaan ke liye dhanrashi aavantit kii gai
 The construction of the existing building on the Constituency Avenue of Islamabad started only in 1990, but due to the lack of money, only the main building could be constructed by 1993, so further construction was stopped in 1993
 31 disambar 1993 main nayaayalay ko rawalpindi se islamabad main nirmit bhawan main punarsthapit kiya gaya evam parisar ke anya bhawanon ke nirmaan ko 2011 tak puraa kiya gaya
 The options, layout, rules and duties of the court Pakistan have been identified in Article 176 Ta 191 in Part 7, Chapter II of the Constitution of Pakistan
 unke lekh kaa sarsari samiksha aabhal main kaha gaya he: In addition to the observations described above, the constitution has been ordered to contact the court in legal, constitutional and domestic matters in Ja Baja second chapter and sections in Pakistan
 pakistan ke nyaayik vyavastha main sarvocch nyaayalay kaa yah bhoomika spasht he ki vah pakistan ke anya bhaagon main na keval sanvaidhanik or kanoonee najar rakhe balki unke sarkari shakhaon main vikalp or kartavyon kii sahi pahchaan or vitaran bhi amal main laae
 Sections 176 to 190 of the Constitution give several constitutional powers to the Supreme Court, the use of which can control and hinder the President's work independence
 udhaahranswaroop: samvidhan ke anusaar raashtrapati ke paas qaumi asembli ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar he, parantu aise kisi bhi vivaadasper bhangan ko vaiddh yaa avaiddh qaraar dene kaa adhikaar sarvocch nyaayalay ko diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the court has also been empowered to inspect any decision and order taken by the President and declare it as non-constitutional and illegal
 haalaanki ye praavdhaan samvidhan dwaara ankit kiye gaye hai, parantu inhen aamtaur par upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 But if seen in the context of constitutional history of Pakistan, then such rights have been used on many occasions
 kai vivaadaaspad nirnyon ke baavjood is nyaayalay kaa pakistani raajnneeti main ahm sthaan he, atah anek sainya sarkaron va rajnatik anban ke dauron ke baad bhi is nyaayalay ne apana sthaan banaae rakhaa he, evam kai baar sena ke avaidh takaton par lagaam daalati rahi he, or yah pakistan ke kuch sabase sammanneey sansthaanon main se ek he or aam janata main ise vishwaas kii drushti se dekha jaataa he
 Politics gateway sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kii nyaaypalika kaa shikaar bindu he, evam pakistani nyaayik tantra kaa shreshthatam va ucchtam nyaayalay he
 Pakistan has a hierarchical system of judiciary in which there are two classes of courts: shreshthatar nyaaypalika main, ucchtam nyaayalay ke atirikt, sangheey sharia adaalat or paanch prantiy ucch nyaayalayon aate hai, jiske sheersh par supreme court virajman he
 At the lower level of the Supreme Court, there is a High Court constituted for each of the four provinces and the capital city of Islamabad
 pakistan kaa samvidhan, nyaaypalika par samvidhan kii raksha, sangrakshan va bachaav kaa daayitv saunpta he
 Neither the Supreme Court nor the High Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of tribal areas, unless otherwise provided
 aaazaad kashmir or gilgit-baltistan ke vivaadit kshetron ke liye alag nyaayik pranali he
 The subordinate judiciary consists of courts which come under superior system
 isamen, civil or aapraadhik janapadiya nyaayalay va anya anek vishesh adaalatein shaamil hai, jo, banking, beemaa, seemaa shulk va utpaada shulk, taskari, drugs, aatankwaad, karadhaan, paryaavaran, upabhokta sangrakshan, or bhrashtachar sambandhit maamalon main adhikarita kaa prayog karti hai
 Criminal courts were created under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Courts Ordinance, 1964
 saath hi, rajasav adaalatein bhi hai, jo ki pashchimi pakistan bhu-rajasav adhinium, 1967 ke tahat kaam kar rahe hai
 The decisions taken by all these courts are appeal-bound
 arthath nirnay ko unchi adaalaton main chunauti di ja sakati he
 The supreme court has final jurisdiction in this
 pakistan ke mukhya nyaayadhish, pakistan kii nyaaypalika ke pramukh evam ucchtam nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish hote hai
 He is the senior-most among the 16 judges of the Supreme Court
 mukhya nyaayadhish pakistan kii nyaayik pranali ke pramukh prashasnic adhikari he evam yah pakistan kaa ucchtam nyaayalay pad he jo sangheey nyaaypalika kii niti nirdhaaran vah ucchtam nyaayalay main nyaayik kaaryon kaa karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar he
 The nomination for appointment to this post is done by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and finally the President of Pakistan
 adaalat kii sunwaayee par adhyakshata karte hue mukhya nyaayadhish ke paas nyaayalay kii niti nirdhaaran ke liye atyant takat he
 At the same time, according to modern tradition, the Chief Justice of Pakistan was the first Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid
 maujuuda sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke anusaar sarvocch nyaayalay main mukhya nyaayadhish ke atirikt, adhiktam 16 or nyaayadhish rah sakate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan consists of a Chief and 16 other appointed judges
 nyaayadhish ke rup main anubhav ke 5 saal tak yaa vakil ke rup main 15 varshon ke anubhav waal kisi vyakti ko hi sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ke pad ke liye aavedan karne kaa adhikaar he
 The President of Pakistan appoints judges of the court from the recommendation made by the Supreme Court to individuals based on their discretion and experience in various fields of law
 supreme court kii siforishein ko raashtrapati par badhyakaari he
 Exercise: As a rule, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the Chief Justice
 prayek nyaayadhish 65 saal kii umr tak pad dhaaran kar sakate hai, jis bich ve jaldi hi istipha dwaara yaa samvidhan ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 That is, due to physical or mental incapacity or misconduct - the validity of which is determined by the Supreme Judicial Council - any judge can be removed only on the basis of the provisions provided by the Constitution before the term is completed
 dhvaj The building pratikachihn The motto of the Supreme Court is taken from Quran 38:26

 While many animals and birds only mingle in the appropriate season to produce their children, in humans, mating can happen without this reason
 sambhog insaanon main sukh prapti yaa pyaar yaa jajbaat dikhaane kaa bhi ek rup hai
 During the act of intercourse or intercourse, which is called play, in English, during every animal's body some special type of smell is emitted which motivates and stimulates the heterosexual to copulate
 kuch praaniyon main yah mausam ke anusaar bhi paaya jaataa he
 In fact, the entire process from four-play to the attainment of climax is called sambhog provided that this act of gender behavior is happening among the heterosexuals
 kai aise prakaar ke sambhog bhi hai jisamen ling kaa upyog nar or maadaa ke bich nahin hota jaise mukh maithun athwa guda maithun unhen maithun to kaha ja saktaa he parantu sambhog kadaapi nahin
 The above types of sexual intercourse fall under unnatural or unnatural behavior, or in the absence of the means of sexual intercourse, they can only be called the measure of natural self-satisfaction of man, not intercourse

 To attempt to conquer or propel nature from prehistoric times and to bring a regular control in life, be it from fear or with reverence, when man combined his life with the rhythm of the environment around him, his art She was not only to vow for beauty, but her life and life goals were focused on her
 ham dekhte he ki prastar yug, tamra yug or uske baad ke yugon kii kala isi adarsh or lakshya par aadhaarit he, na ki ek kisi anupayogi vastu kaa keval saundarypan karne ke liye
 This is the reason that while on one hand the impression of their life, religion and social order is evident in these metal and wood items which are used in the daily works made by them, on the other hand, we can get a glimpse of the latent aesthetic sense contained in them by these objects
 Also get dhaatu kii apeksha lakdi kaa prayog baad main hua hoga, aisa kahana thik nahin janchataa
 Yes, it is of course that due to wood being a less durable medium, we do not find examples in it so ancient as those found in metal, bone or stone
 aitihaasik yug kii vaastukala, chaahe vah rahane kaa awaas ho, mandir, chaitanya athwa vihaar ho is baat kii pushti karti he ki iske purv yahi sab chijen lakdi main banaai jaati rahi hongi
 Lomus' hut, Sanchi's gate and window, Ajanta's caves are a vivid proof of the fact that even though built in stone, his imagination and plan are based on wood
 dainik jivan kii in upyogi vastuon kaa nirmaan yadhyapi lalit kala ke lakshya se nahin hua, tathaapi samuhik jivan kii kalapriyata kaa ansh inamen hamen avashya drushtigochar hota he or yadi inhen kalatmak vastuen kaha jaae to bhul na hogi
 With the development of civilization, man has not left a useful notion in his manufactured goods, but we see that his fluidity has made him beautiful product of fine arts in some quantity by his fluidity
 yah keval aadhunik yug kii hi dein he ki jahaan kala ek ore samuhik na hokar vyaktigat hui, duusari ore uski upyogita kala, kala ke liye ho, is uddeshy ko lekar chali, yah duusari baat he ki isi anupayogi kala kaa prabhaav bhi hamaari upyogi vastuon par padaa or ek prakaar se usne samuhik rup liya
 In today's scientific age, internationalism is also emerging as a new form of art by the developed means of transport where the political, social or religious boundaries of a nation are broken and humanity is bound by a united approach, art does not give up individual originality
 Is found because overwhelmed by psychological thoughts, in the gaps of the individual, there are dormant desires, desires and copy Terrorism fears has been still appropriate material value of variant of Art
 mohanjodaado kii nartki kii dhaatu kii murti se us kaal kii kala kaa str, drushtikon evam aavashyak gun hamen spasht parilakshith hote hai or yadi ham baad kii dhaatu kii murtiyon main dekhen, jo dasvin shatabdi se prachur maatra main banani prarambh ho gai thim, to nartki un sab gunon se paripurna he jo ek ucch koti kii murti main hone chahie
 In the soulful dynamics of the bronze statue of Nataraja, we find all the qualities of traditional art beauty, as well as modern standards, in all its qualities
 nepali tara kii murti kii shaat ardhanayan nimilit saumyata, uske chaaron ore kaa anaavashyak alankaran, jo dhire dhire baad kii murtiyon main or bhi bad gaya, kisi se chhip nahin paati
 Although all such idols were made with religious sentiments, but due to their beauty, they became secular
 dhaatu kii murtiyan teen prakaar kii hoti thim, dhali hui, piti hui or dhali piti hui
 The molded sculptures were initially made by wax
 or phir patali maheen chikani mitti ke ghol main murti ko dubaakar ek motaa aavaran bana liya jaataa tha
 The wax is pumped out by applying a bottom-mounted wax tube which is placed at the required locations of each sculpture, and the same blank is filled with metal through the same tube passage
 chaandi, sona, kaansa, pital or ashtadhaatu kii sabhi murtiyan isi prakaar dhaali jaati hai
 In the second type of sculptures, the metal sheet is lifted from the back by beating the metal sheet and it is joined to the shells of various embossed limbs
 kabhi kabhi dhali hui murtiyon ke alankaran petakar banaate or baad main jod dete hai yaa piti hui murtiyon ke singhaasana athvlankaran dhale hue rahete hai
 South India, Napal and Gujarat have been the hub of such sculptures and even now there are traditional styles and method to manufacture these idols, though now they aim to earn foreign exchange by creating less religious and wonderful items
 murtiyon ke atirikt aradhana kaary mandir or dainik jivan main kaary aanevaali vastuen paramparaagat style main ab bhi banati he jais kalash, dharti, pradeep, purna kumbh ghante, chhip lakshmi, saraute, chaaku ityadi jo ab rnijeev or rudhigat hone par bhi ek apni sthaneey style kaa aakarshan rachate hai
 Most of the specimens of wood art are not available to us from pre-medieval period, but it can easily be assumed by observing their collegiality and skillfulness that the tradition of this type of art must have been very old to reach that level
 chandan, akhrot, shisham, aavnoos, katahal, sheel, neem, kii kashthakala ke sarvottam udhaaharan hamen kathmandu, ahmedabad ke bhawanon main or kerala kii rathyatra ke samay kaary aanevaale bade aakaar ke rathon main milte hai
 All these were intended to be an ornate part of woodwork art as compared to independent sculptures, but artists have got a lot of opportunity to show their craftsmanship and maturity and these wooden houses, worship or habitat, more on religious subject Despite the encouragement, we find that digging of these buildings from secular subjects like hunters, cattlemen, narnaris engrossed in daily life is
 khudaai karne ke baad in bhawanon ko vaarshik samaaroh ke samay parishkrut karne ke liye tel kaa prayog avashya kiya gaya jiske kaaran kashtha jaisaa madhyam pakkaa hokar samay or jalwaayu ke krur praghaaton ko sah paaya he
 Some buildings still look newer than yesterday's
 chandan or akhrot kii lakdi jiskaa mysore or kashmir centre he kalatmak prakaar kii choti or badi dainik jivan kii vastuen or pashupakshi, kandhe, dabbe ityadi banane ke kaary main laai gai he
 The special reason for this is the rarity of this type of wood and the absence of large perimeter trees
 mughal kaal main bhi yah kala panpi or aavnoos ke kaary ke liye, jiske alankrita kanghe, kanghiyaan, kalamdaan dabbe ityadi banaae jate rahe
 Nagina and Saharanpur cities of Uttar Pradesh became famous
 usee kaal se lakdi ke upar pital kaa taar, sip athwa vibhinn prakaar kii lakadiyon ke mail se phool boote kaa jadaau kaam bhi prarambh hua
 Like all arts, metal and wood sculptures also became lifeless and orthodox due to the different view of foreign state and lack of proper protection and encouragement
 kahin unka lop hua to kahin unke kushal kaarigaron ne jeevananirvaah ke liye anya kaam dhandhe samhaal liye
 The rich educated class lost their refined interest in the dazzle of civilization and art of foreign goods
 shikshit kalakaaron ne bhi videshi kala kaa anusaran kiya kintu kalantar se ab phir in khoi hui vaibhavsheel kalaon kii ore dhyaan ja rahaa he or anek udiyaman kalakaaron ne kashtha murtikla ko apana madhyam banaaya he jisamen bhartiya paramparaagat style ke saath ham aaj antarrashtriya kaladrushti kaa sundar samanvay pate hai
 Each medium has its own independent quality and character which is not found in the other medium
 dhaatu kii murti kashtha jaisi na lage or kashtha kii murti pathar, cement athwa dhaatu jaisi na lage or uske anrtahit gunon ko parakhkar madhyam ke anukool, nas, rang, rup ko dhyaan main rakh kalakaar apni kriti kii kalpana kare or uske gopneey saundarya ko unmilit kar de jisase utaar chadhaav, rekha ityadi ke sammishran se ek moulik rachana prastut ho, yahi aadhunik kalakaar kaa dhyey or uddeshy he
 Whatever may be the external appearance, the basic principles of our art, which fall under the conspiracy, still meet any measurement penalty, no matter how modern
 free, yaa jeepield, yaa copilefted sauftver paryaayavachi shabd hai
 Some people are protecting the computer program by describing the copyright in such a way that neither they themselves hold any ownership over it nor can any other person hold the proprietary rights over the computer program they have created
 udaahranarth, yadi main koi computer program likhuun or uskaa sorce code or object code main is tarah kii ghoshnaa tathaa shart lagaate huye prakashit karun ki But its condition is that, ab is ghoshnaa or shart ke kaaran na to main swayan na or koi anya vyakti is computer program ke prayog karne athwa sanshodhan karne haq rakh saktaa he
 Through such a declaration, i have made sure that any other person can also use or amend it without infringing the copyright
 saadharantay:, copirite kaa arth yah hota he ki koi anya vyakti uskaa prayog athwa sanshodhan uske maalik kii anumati ke na kar sake
 Here the reverse work was done using copyright
 copirite kaa yadi koi ulta shabd ho saktaa he to vah he copileft
 It is a new word and has not yet appeared in the English dictionary, although it is a popular word in the computer dictionary
 jis computer program ke license main is tarah kii ghoshnaa or shart hoti he use copilefted software kaha jaataa he
 This type of software is also called free software
 free shabd kaa prayog karnaa richard stallmen ne shuru kiya or yah aandolan bhi unka hi shuru kiya gaya he
 He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s
 unke mutabik pehle kamputer programmer sauftware main kapirite clem nahin karte the or bahut aasaani se ek duusare ko apana program de dete the lekin baad main kamputer programmeron ne apana program ek duusare ko dena band kar diya or kisi or ko unke program main sanshodhan karne kaa adhikaar bhi samaapt kar diya
 Stalman felt that in this way the computer software would be left with a few special people and there would be no complete development
 isaliye unhone apana institute ko chhod kar ghanu project, free sours foundation ke antargat shuru kiya
 In this, we started writing software that are copylefted
 unhone is tarah ke saftware ko free-sauftware kaa naam diya
 This is because, according to them, people have the freedom to modify computer programs or software, they say that do not think of free as in free beer but look like it is in freedom of speech
 free sours foundation kii websit ke mutabik, unhi ke shabdon main 'free software' is a matter of liberty, not price
 To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer' The following are the main things in free or copied software - Source code is always published in this, there is no money or royalty to be paid for such software, but if you are giving any service in relation to it, then take the money to provide the service
 Can
 is tarah ke sauftware ko koi bhi sanshodhit kar saktaa he is tarah ke sauftware ko sanshodhan karne ke baad prakashit karne yaa bottne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 You can use it in your organization without publishing or sharing
 par yadi is tarah ke sauftware ko bina sanshodhan kiye yaa sanshodhit karne ke baad baanta jaataa he to usamen vahi sharten rahengin jo ki pehle thim yani ki sorcecode prakashit karnaa padega; anya logon ko sanshodhan karne kii swatantraaa deni hogi; tathaa sauftware ke liye koi paisa yaa royalti nahin lee ja sakati he
 Stalman, with the help of some lawyers, wrote the General Public License, which contained such a declaration and condition that copyleft any software
 isaliye is tarah ke sauftver ko jeepield sauftver bhi kaha jataa he
 That is, free softwares or copylefted softwares or gepyld softwares are synonyms of the same kind of softwares
 kyon! ho gaya naa

 is avadhi main pashchimi europe ke saanskrithik evam bauddhik varg ne parampara se hatakar tark, vishleshan tathaa vaiyaktik swatantry par jor diya
 Enlightenment challenged the Catholic Church and other institutions that have made deep inroads into society

 The scientific consciousness that developed in the Renaissance period, the tendency to reason and explore, matured in the 18th century
 vaigyanik chintan kii is paripakv avasthaa ko 'prabodhan' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Enlightenment thinkers emphasized that behind this physical world and the phenomena in nature, some systematic, unchanging and natural law is at hand
 francis bekan ne bataaya ki vishwaas majboot karne ke teen saadhan hai- anubhav, tark or pramaan; or inamen sabase adhik shaktishaalee pramaan he kyonki tark / anubhav par aadhaarit vishwaas sthir nahin rahata
 The thinkers of Enlightenment combined knowledge with natural sciences
 paryavvekshan, prayog or aalochanatmak chaanbin kii vyavasthit paddati kaa prayog gyanoday ke chintakon kii najar main satya tak pahunchne kaa sakasham aadhaar thi
 According to him, knowledge should be used and qualified
 iske paas aise pramaan hona chahie jo bodhgamy ho or maanav mastishk kii pahunch main ho
 On the basis of this notion of knowledge, Enlightenment called opposition to transcendental inference and knowledge
 madhyayug main isaimat kaa prabhaav isliye mana jaataa tha ki ishwar dwaara nirmit is duniya ko manushya nahin jaan saktaa
 According to this definition, this world is inaccessible to human intelligence
 manushya evam bahmand ke bare main satya kaa keval “udghaatan” ho saktaa he isliye use keval pavitra pustakon ke jariye janaa ja saktaa he
 "where the light of knowledge is not illuminated, there is a way out of the light of faith

 We should talk about nature not through holy books but through experiments and examinations
 kaary-kaaran sambandh kaa adhyayan vigyaan sambandhi prabodhan chintan kaa kendriya tatv tha

 The thinkers of the Enlightenment believed that the world is like a machine whose control and operation are under certain rules
 falswaroop unhen aashaa bani ki is antarnihit niyamon ko khoj ve brahmand ke rahasy ko samaj lenge or phir us par kaabo paa lenge
 Its purpose was to enable individuals to exert control over their environment so that they could protect themselves from the subversive forces of natural forces as well as use the energy of nature for the benefit of mankind
 newton ne prakaash ke moulik rahasyon kaa pataa lagaaya or prakaash vigyaan kii sthapana kii
 Many people, including Benjamin Franklin, contributed to the discovery of electricity
 prabodhanyugin chintakon ne kaha ki koi paramsatta he or is duniya ke samast praani usee ke banaae hue hai or in sabake saath krurta kaa nahin balki dayalutaa kaa aacharan karnaa chahie
 According to this, God can be compared to a clock-maker who does not give instructions on how to direct time after the clock is made
 is devvaad main reeti-rivaaj, anushthanon tathaa aprakritik tattvon kaa bahishkaar kar diya gaya or sabhi manushyon kii samanta or sahishnutaa ko nae aadhaar ke rup main grahan kiya gaya
 In this way, natural religion was the religion of humanity and this religion would not become a source of ridiculing others and inciting hatred, thinkers of enlightenment believed
 gyanoday ke chintak swatantraaa va svachhndatha ke himachati the
 Diddro argued in favor of the freedom of the individual and said - "nature has not given anyone the right to order others, freedom is divine charity
 ” prabodhan ke chintakon ne kaha ki sab manushya ek samaan utpann hote hai unamem jo vishmata pai jaati he iskaa kaaran keval yah he ki sabko shiksha evam unnati kaa avasar samaan nahin miltaa
 Enlightenment propounded the importance of nature
 chintakon ke anusaar prakruti apane saral rup main soundarya se paripurna he
 Returning to nature in a way is equivalent to returning to freedom
