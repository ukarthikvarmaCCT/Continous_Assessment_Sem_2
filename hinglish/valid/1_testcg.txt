 Meanwhile, in a special conversation with the BBC, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav also even said that "no one would want that President's rule be implemented in UP and BJP should run the government with remote control
" " matlab saaf he ki agar sapa jaadui aankade (202 seat) tak nahin pahunch paati he to upi kaa 'babua' samarthan kii aas main apni 'buaa' kii ore dekhtaa najar aayega
 maya-akhilesh's relationship did not deteriorate Mayawati's relations with the first generation of SP, however Akhilesh never used derogatory language against Mayawati nor did Mayawati from that side
 nishaanaa saadhane ke liye akhilesh mayawati ko buaa bulaate rahe to mayawati palatwaar ke taur par akhilesh ko babua hi pukaarti raheen
 Even during the election campaign, the language of both did not speak much
 bijepi ko rokane ke liye ho sakate hai ek saathis baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki upi main bijepi ko sattashin hone se rokane ke liye anya rajnatik partiyaan kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar ho sakati hai
 Recent statements by Akhilesh and Mayawati point to this
 bihar chunaavon main ham aisa hote dekh chuke hai
 The alliance government is not new to the alliance government is not new to UP
 pichhali do sarkaron ko chhod den to usase pehle mayawati teen baar or mulaayam singh yadav ek baar gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke mukhiya ban chuke hai
 However, the coalition government has never completed a five-year term
 pehle bhi ek saath aa chuki he sapa-basaprub tak ek baar upi kii chir pratidwandi partiyon sapa or basapa ke bich gathbandhan hua he, baat 1993 main hue chunaavon kii he
 This alliance won the elections and Mulayam Singh Yadav became the head of the state
 lekin, aapasi manmutav ke chalate 2 june, 1995 ko basapa ne sarkaar se kinaaraa kas liya or samarthan vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kar di
 With this move by Mayawati, Mulayam Singh's government was reduced to a minority
 sarkaar bachaane ke liye jod-ghataav kiye gaye
 In the end, when the matter did not work, angry SP activists and all the leaders angrily reached the State Guest House, Meerabai Marg, Lucknow
 uske baad jo hua use aaj 'guest house cond' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After the guest house scandal, the SP and BSP had a figure of 36

 If Lata Mangeshkar can prove that my father wrote her a letter to apologize to her, she should present it
 yadi vah aisa karti hai to main unase maafee maangane ke liye taiyaar hum
 If not, they should apologize within 10 days
 shahid ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki lata mere pita ke prashansakon kii badi sankhya se khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karti hai or unhone isliye yah baat kahi

 If she does, i am ready to apologize to her
 yadi nahin to unhen 10 din ke andar maafee maangani chahie
 Shahid said, i think Lata feels insecure with the large number of fans of my father and that's why she said this

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met US President Barack Obama on Sunday night and he is understood to have discussed nuclear security, India's concern over US military aid to Pakistan and the volatile situation in Afghanistan

 niraj kumaar ke paas dilli ke police kamishnar kii kursi ab bas chaar din ke liye bachi he, par kursi chhodane se pehle ve anderworld don daaud ibrahim ke khel ko bhunaakar janaa chaahate hai
 During the investigation of spot fixing in the IPL, he heard Dawood's voice
 wo aawaaj, jo pichley saalon se kisi ne nahin suni
 Now on the same voice, he is going to file the last big charge sheet of his career before retirement, because according to him, the game is hidden in the voice of Dawood
 bees saal main pehali baar hindustan kii police ne sabase khaufnak don daaud ibrahim kii aawaaj kaid karne kaa daawa kiya
 At the same time, there was a cry for opening the biggest game of cricket betting to the world
 karachi main baithe daaud ibrahim ke personal mobile phone se ricard kii gai saat-aath minute kii baatcheet hi ab ipel spot phixing kaa sabase bada saboot bataaya ja rahaa he
 Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar claims that he is preparing a strong chargesheet against Dawood Ibrahim, which will expose the connivance of d-company and cricket betting for the first time
 sach to ye he ki police kamishnar kii kursi chhodane se pehle niraj kumaar ye tay kar dena chaahate hai ki unke ritair hone se pehle chargeshit taiyaar ho jaae, taaki daaud kaa tamgaa lagaakar wo police headquarter se rukhsat hon
 But those raising questions are now saying that Dawood's voice is on the tape, what is the guarantee? It is not only the voice of Dawood, but the evidence kept in the court also seems half-finished
 dilli police kii special cell ne adaalat main daaud kii 160 second kii baatcheet kii transcript rakhi he, uske aakhir main ek mantri kaa zikr he
 These are the ministers about whom Dawood is referring to a deal of eight million with his henchman Javed Chutani
 bachaav paksh ne adaalat main is mantri ke naam ke bare main jab sawaal uthaae, to police ko maano saanp sugh gaya
 The truth is that even the commissioner is still silent in the name of the minister
 mantri par kyon chup hai kamishnar sahab?sibiai or dilli police main saalon tak oonche ohade par baithne vaale niraj kumaar kaa daawa rahaa he ki unhone anderworld ke kai kile apni naukari ke dauraan dhwast kiye hai
 In particular, he has done many amazing things in breaking the network of India's Most Wanted Dawood Ibrahim
 yahi vajah he ki spoot phixing main daakhil hone vaale chargeshit main kamishnar sahab ne pehali baar betting ko lekar daaud ke kai raaj khole hai or yahaan tak daawa kiya he ki ipel ke dauraan daaud ibrahim har match main khud satte ke bhav kholta he
 The commissioner also knows that Dawood Ibrahim sometimes deliberately gives the wrong tip on losing and winning, so that his special bookie can earn tremendous money
 par daaud kii rag-rag jaanane vaale niraj kumaar daaud ke sabase ahm khulaase yani mantri ke zikr par ab tak koi jaankaree nahin juta sake
 By the way, it is also possible that someone who knows about Dawood's skin is not wanting to give this information? Because the matter is not about the sentry, but of the minister
 sach kya he iskaa khulaasa agle chaar dinon ke andar kabhi bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki kamishnar kii kursi niraj kumaar ke paas ab bas chaar hi din he
 The story of Dawood's voice caught Dawood Ibrahim's voice is also similar to Dawood's
 dilli police isi saal march ke maheene main kuch phone sun rahi thi or isi dauraan usne 160 second kii ek baatcheet suni
 The Delhi Police, later, when the voice samples were sent to RAW, revealed that the biggest voice of the underworld had inadvertently been captured
 daaud phone par apane gurgey se kuch kah rahaa tha
 Dawood Ibrahim's betting syndicate in India was run by Ramesh Vyas, who is currently under police custody
 police kii maane, to khud ramesh vyas ne bhi ye kabool kiya he ki vah betting sirf or sirf di-company ke kehane par or di-company ke liye hi karata tha
 Ramesh Vyas used to get a call from Dubai
 dilli police kaa daawa he ki spot phixing maamle main di-company ke khilaaf uske paas pukhta saboot hai
 On the other hand, d-company says that it has nothing to do with fixing or betting
 ipel main spot phixing ke liye ulte di-company chota rajan gang ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 When Rajasthan Royals star player Sreesanth came under police arrest, when the biggest fixing was revealed, the finger straightened on Dawood Ibrahim's d Company
 police jaanch ke mutabik daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim kii shah par hi sara khel rachaa gaya
 Anees and Shakeel together run Dawood's d-company from Karachi
 lekin ajtak se exclusive baatcheet main chota shakeel ne phixing kaa ilzaam apane jaani dushman chota rajan ke sindicket par madh diya
 The truth is that this charge of Chhota Shakeel is once again the beginning of gang war, which is taking place on the cricket pitch instead of drugs and real estate
 par chota shakeel kaa ye bayaan jaise hi ajtak par aayaa, chota rajan ke giroh main hadakamp much gaya
 Shortly, the answer came from Chhota Rajan that the d Company is blaming the betting on others to avoid the accusations
 rajan kaa kahana he kichhota shakeel police ko gumraah kar rahaa he
 He has nothing to do with betting
 chota rajan ke mutabik, betting kii saazish daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim ne rachi he
 These gifts on each other are obviously not a verbal deposit
 do jaani-dushman jab ek saath ek-duusare ke khilaaf saamne aakar bolen, to ye bhi maamuli baat nahin he
 The hint is clear that this is a new beginning for both of them
 bas fark ye he ki hindustan ke do sabase khoonkhaar gang ne gangvaar ke liye pehali baar cricket ke pich ko chunaa he, kyonki us pich par bicha he 40 hajaar karod rupee, jis par donon kii nazaren gadi hai

 Former Australia captain Mark Taylor believes that Team India captain Virat Kohli needs to rein in his aggressive behavior on the field
 tailor ne kohli ke maidan ke baahar ke aacharan kii prashansa kii lekin unhen lagata he ki maidan main bhartiya captain ke 'behad' aakraamak ravaiye kii khel ko jarurat nahin he
 Taylor, one of Australia's most successful captains, gave an example of an incident in which he wanted to interview Kohli and his behavior was very courteous
 cricketer se camentator bane tailor ne kaha, ‘chaar saal pehle jab main channel nine ke saath tha to main viraat kohli (virat Kohli) kaa intervyuu kar rahaa tha, tab mujhe unke vyaktitv ke bare main jaanane kaa mauka mila

 bijepi netaa narendra modi ne kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vah anderworld sargana daaud ibrahim ke khilaaf karrwai ke bajaay media main bayaan dete rahete hai
 However, the Congress rejected criticism of Modi
 gujarati news channel ko die gaye ek intervyuu main modi ne sawaal kiya ki kya daud ibrahim ko bharat laane ke liye press note jari karnaa jaruri he
 Significantly, Shinde had given a statement in the media a few months ago that India will bring Dawood back from Pakistan
 scindia ke is bayaan par modi ne kaha, ‘kya aisi chijen media ke jariye hasil kii ja sakati hai? kya in chizon kaa khulaasa akhabaaron ke jariye karnaa chahie? kya america ne bin laden se baat kii thi? kya america ne bin laden ko maar giraane kii apni yojana kaa khulaasa karne ke liye samvaadadaata sammelan kiya tha?’modi ne kaha, ‘sarkaar ne kiya kya he? unke paas nunatam paripakvata bhi nahin he

 ’ grih mantri rah chuke congress netaa pi chidambaram ne kaha ki sarkaar daaud ko waapas laane ke liye apane commando pakistan nahin bhej sakati
 He said whether Modi can give any better suggestion
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘ham jaanate hai ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne use panaah de rakhi he
 Those who say that we are not doing enough, please tell us what the government can do more than this
 use waapas laane ke liye kya hamen aadha darjan blike cat commando bhejne honge
 
 
 Modi should tell us what we should do
 ’congress netaa ne kaha, ‘yadi ham use giraftaar kar sakate hai to ham aisa karenge
 
 
 We cannot be involved in any covert activity
 ham pakistan nahin ja sakate
 Dawood, considered the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, is the country's most wanted terrorist
 mana jaataa he ki vah pakistan main rah rahaa he
 India has demanded his extradition
 pakistan kaa sahyog na milane ke kaaran use bharat waapas laane kii koshishen kaamyaab nahin ho saki hai
 The electoral mathematics of the Congress has gone awry
 usne andaja lagaaya tha ki musalmaan use chunaav main vot denge lekin ab aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 He believed that Narendra Modi is a Hinduist leader and Muslims will support the party in fighting him
 lekin aam aadmi party ne unka ganit bigaad diya he
 The English newspaper 'the Times of India' has reported that in the elections held on Thursday, it was seen that Muslims were not completely with the Congress
 unke liye party pehali pasand nahin he
 This is also seen in the seats where the Congress is strong
 party ko ummid thi ki voter dharm ke aadhaar par jab batenge to musalmaan congress ko vot denge
 The indications from Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are evidence of what will be the pattern of significant voting in the next weeks
 middle class ke log congress ke saath nahin hai or us kami ko party muslim voton se bharna chaahati he
 But now it does not seem to happen
 modi ab musalamaanon ke voting pattern ko tay kar rahe hai
 That is, they are voting against Modi for the candidate who seems to be challenging the BJP
 is kaaran muslim matadaata congress ko samarthan dene ke bare main phir se soch rahe hai
 The condition is that in the seats where the Congress is strong, such sentiment is also visible
 abhi ghaziabad, chandani chowk or uttar-purv dilli main muslim vot hi matadaataaon kaa bhagya tay karenge
 But the Congress is no longer expecting them
 congress un tathakthith secular partiyon ke saamne bebas dikh rahi he jo modi ke khilaaf kattar bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The party cannot attack them like the leaders of SP and BSP
 haalanki unke hi ek ummidavaar ne modi ke tukade-tukade karne kii baat kahi thi
 The Congress feels that the statement Azam Khan made about Kargil in Ghaziabad is part of a conspiracy
 khan ne kaha tha ki kargil yuddh hindu sainikon ne nahin muslim phogiyon ne jitayaa tha
 This divided the voters there on religious grounds
 hindu voter bijepi kii ore chale gaye
 As a result, the position of Congress candidate Raj Babbar, standing from there, was diluted, whereas earlier he was quite strong
 samaajawaadee party yahaan majboot nahin thi, lekin aisa karke unhone congress ko kamjor kar diya
 He has won a kind of victory by sabotaging the prospects of the Congress
 ab agle charan kii voting ke liye congress ko bahut ummid nahin he
 He does not expect Muslim votes to go in his favor
 party ke netaaon ko lag rahaa he ki muslim votaron ke maamle main aam aadmi party uski sambhaavnaaon ko bahut kshati pahunchaa rahi he

 prashanth kishor kii gaadi par hua tha patharavakulapati ke saath prashanth kishor kii is mulaakaat kii jaankaree jaise hi chaatro ko mili unhone kulapati awaas kaa gheraav kiya or uske baad prashanth kishor par hamalaa bol diya
 Titans like Prashant Kishore fled in their car after saving their lives
 is dauraan unki gaadi par patharav hua jisase gaadi ke shishe bhi tut gaye
 In this case, Patna Police took action and detained students of bjp-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad late in the night
 iske virodh main bijepi 4 vidhayakon arun sinha, suraj nandan kushvaha, nitin naveen or sanjeev chaurasia ne pirbahor thane par nitish kumaar or prashanth kishor ke khilaaf narebaaji kii or prashanth kishor kii giraftaar kii maang kii
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Arun Sinha said that in violation of the model code of conduct, Prashant Kishore met the vice-chancellor of the university at his residence, about which the Patna Police should register an FIR against him and arrest him
 bijepi vidhayak nitin naveen ne kaha ki prashanth kishor chaatro ke chunaav main bevajaah dakhsandaji kar rahe hai or kulapati se milakar unhone unpar dabaav banaaya ki chunaav ke din jediu ke sabhi ummidavaaron kii jeet sunishchit kii jaae
 BJP leaders demanded that the 10 students of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) who were detained should be released
 isi maamle main police ne 9 chaatro ko mangalvaar ke din main chhod diya jabaki ek chaatr karn ko nyaayalay se jamaanat mil gai
 It was only after Karna got bail that the BJP leaders ended their sit-in at the Pirbhor police station, but they remained adamant about the demand for the arrest of Prashant Kishore
 prashanth kishor ne kiya titvishvavidhyalay main somvaar ko apane saath hui ghatana ko lekar prashanth kishor ne bhi mangalvaar ko twit kiya or kaha ki akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke chaatro ne chunaav main sambhavit haar ko dekhte hue unki gaadi par patharav kiya
 The news about my injury is false
 I'm fine, thanks for the concern
 @abvpvoiceu need to do better than let few hooligans & antisocial elements become your face in Bihar
 patna uniwarsity ke chaatrasangh chunaav main sambhavit haar kii ghabrahat meri gaadi par pathar maarane se kam nahin hogi
 - Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 3, 2018 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also tweeted about this whole issue and said that BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who has done devotion to Nitish Kumar, is silent on the protest against his mlas Chief Minister

 Delhi Police Crime Branch has arrested two people who were working as members of RSS to collect donations and illegal collection from BJP leaders
 bijepi ke purv vidhayak anil sharma kii shikaayat par karrwai karte hue police ne in aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Police is questioning them
 jaankaree ke mutabik, sivam or mahendra naam ke do yuvakon ko police ne arkepuram se bijepi ke purv vidhayak anil sharma kii shikaayat par giraftaar kiya
 One of these boys went to rkpuram to get money from them
 police kii maane to ye kisi bade gang kaa kaam he
 One of these accused Mahendra told something else during the interrogation
 phone kar ke metro stesan par bulaayamahendra ke mutabik, usne kuch din pehle naukari ke liye oelex kii site par register kiya tha
 On Thursday, he got a call from a number and asked to give a job
 achche paison ke badale use kuch logon ke yahaan se dacument collection kaa kaam diya gaya
 He was called to Rajiv Chowk metro station in Delhi for the same work
 shaq hone par diya police ko suchnaavhaa se anil sharma kaa pataa dekar kagajaat laane ko kaha gaya, lekin pehle hi phone karne vaale shaks ne anil sharma ko paise taiyaar rakhane ke liye kaha tha
 When in doubt, Anil informed the police
 jab mahendra anil sharma ke ghar pahunchaa, to pehle se maujuud police ne use pakad liya, lekin mahendra ko nahin pataa ki wo paise lene aayaa tha
 The gang's mastermind, who is absconding, also caught the boy named Shivam, who had sent him to collect money, at Mahendra's behest
 yah kisi shaatir apradhi kaa kaam he, jo naukari ke liye pareshaan ladakon ko apana mohara bana kar vasuuli karata he
 Even after all the efforts of the police, the mastermind of this case has not been handled yet
 police jaanch jari he
 Gujarat, which was established by BJP as a laboratory of Hindutva and won the elections five times by instigating development, has been sitting on power, today in the political battleground of Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is giving it a contest
 is jang main jaateey sameekaran or soft hindutv rahul ke hathiyaar bane hue hai
 With this activism of Rahul, there is a new life in the Congress which has been on the ventilator in Gujarat for two decades
 congress kaaryakarta utsaah or josh se labarej hai
 However, the lines that Rahul is getting an edge in this political battle are being told that the Congress in-charge of Gujarat and former Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot are being told
 aaj kam se kam congressiyon ke liye to gujarat main gahalot chanakya kii bhoomika main hai
 Gujarat Congress, which became Rahul's launching pad, has been out of power in Gujarat for the last 22 years
 in do dashakon main pehali baar party bijepi ko takkar detii najar aa rahi he
 Being the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the assembly elections in Gujarat are very important
 is chunaav ke nattejey 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii ibaarat likhenge
 The election of Gujarat is being held at a time when the 2019 election is close, Rahul Gandhi is to be crowned as Congress President
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat ko apana launch pad banaaya or khud ko sabit karne ke liye utre hai
 In Rahul's Karnadhar Gehlot Gujarat, the Congress has counting leaders like Bharat Solanki, Arjun Modwadia and MLA Shaktisinh Gohil, but these leaders are limited to taking their seats only
 aise main congress or rahul gandhi ke maardarshak kii bhoomika main rajya ke congress prabharee ashok gahalot hai
 Gehlot has been camping in Gujarat for the past several months
 bataur gujarat prabharee ashok gahalot ne yahaan party ke paksh main maahaul banane ke liye aisa road map banaaya jo bijepi ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban gaya he
 Returning to caste by religion Gujarat politics: In Gujarat, BJP has been winning the last five elections by giving color to religion
 modi ne is trump card se congress ko kamobesh haashie par laakar khadaa kar diya
 Ashok Gehlot has again dominated caste politics over religion to wrest power from BJP in Gujarat
 yani hindu card kaa jawaab jaateey card se dene kii congress kii ranneeti he
 The most difficult thing for the BJP in the bjp's ethnic barrier is that it does not like caste politics
 bihar kaa vidhansabha chunaav iskaa udaahaaran he
 This is the reason why Congress leader Ashok Gehlot has played the ethnic card to win the political battle of Gujarat on the lines of Bihar
 ashok gahalot ne gujarat ke jaateey andolan se nikali trimurti alpesh thakor, hardik patel, jignesh mewaani jaise netaaon se kab or kya vaarta kerani he, kab rahul gandhi se milaanaa he
 Wrote the entire screenplay of it
 alpesh thakor ne to baqayada congress jwine bhi kar lee he
 The Congress' ethnic card has increased uneasiness in the BJP
 narendra modi ko gujarat main kahana padaa ki jatvaad ke bahekaave main naa aaen, jatigat muddon se desh ke vikaas main rukaawat aegi
 Gehlot Success in Creating Arguments: Gehlot has tried to capitalize on issues like demonetisation, GST and resentment of Patidars to surround BJP in Gujarat
 congress kii sabhaaon or congress ke prayaason ko dekhte hue lagane laga he ki gujarat ke ran main bataur chanakya gahalot ranneeti or vyuh-rachana banane main kaaphi had tak safal rahe hai
 All the Congress leaders in Gujarat are also supporting every plan of Gehlot
 gahalot ne aisi siten tay kii hai, jahaan mehnat karne par congress jeet sakati he
 Gehlot has made a strategy of not wasting much energy on the bjp's strong seats
 congress ne aisi 135 siten chihnit kii hai jahaan wo bijepi ko takkar de sakati he
 Ashok Gehlot has also prepared a plan for Rahul's Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat to drive the Congress out of appeasement
 rahul ko kahaan janaa he, kisase milanaa he or kya kadam uthaanaa he
 All this is part of Gehlot's story
 gujarat main rahul ke soft hindutv kii raah par chalane kii idia bhi gahalot kaa hi he
 Rahul Gandhi from Gujarat is also trying to answer the allegations of 'anti-hindu' and 'appeasement of minorities' by the BJP on the Congress party
 rahul ke mandir jane se bijepi baichaiyndrasal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii haar kii ek badi vajah antni cameti ne hindu virdohi chhavi maani thi
 Rahul has tried to break the anti-hindu image of the Congress through the Gujarat Yatra
 rahul gandhi ne navasajrun yatra kii shuruuaat saurashtra ke dwarkadhish mandir main puja-archana ke saath kii
 Rahul is seen tilak on his forehead during his visit in Gujarat and is seen darting and foreheading the temples on the way, leaving the BJP restless
 bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) samay par sevaayen shuru na karne vaali companiyon ke 74 license radd karne kii apni sifarish par kaayam he
 Due to this, the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) is stuck in a dilemma
 dot ne is baat par jor diya he ki sirf 12 license hi radd karne kii jarurat he
 In a letter sent to DOT, TRAI said that it has taken legal opinion from two former judges of the Supreme Court in this regard
 unhone tri ke vichaaron kaa samarthan kiya he
 DOT had sent a letter to TRAI asking it to reconsider its recommendation to cancel 74 licenses issued from December 2006
 is par tri ne apana jawaab bhej diya he or vah apane puraane rukh par kaayam he, jisase doorsanchaar vibhaag ke liye kathin sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 DOT limited trai's recommendation to cancel 74 licenses to just 12
 dot ne kaha tha ki sevaayen shuru karne main vilamb ke liye kul milakar sirf 15 license radd kiye ja sakate hai
 These include three licenses that TRAI has not recommended
 tri ne kaha, teen license ke sandarbh main ham dot ke vichaaron se sahamat hai
 In the case of the remainder, we leave it on the dot as to how much penalty it takes after taking into account all the facts
 dot kaa kahana he ki license ke niyam or sharton ke anusaar yadi koi oparator license paane ke 52 saptaah main seva shuru nahin karata he, to us par jurmaana lagaaya ja saktaa he

 ? a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on 26 September ruled the verdict that was being awaited and stamped on the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act 2016 with a majority of four
 magar adaalat yah baat bhi maanati dikhaai di ki saarvajanik kaamkaaj ke harek daayre main aadhaar kii paith jyaadati he, jise aksar "function krip'' (ek technology kaa uske aarambhik makasad se aage badhkar niztaa ke ulanghan kii ore le jane vaale duusare istemaal) kaha jaataa he
 The court repealed section 57 of the law, which allowed private entities to ask for Aadhaar data, including biometric data, in lieu of their services
 adaalat ne yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki vyavsaayik bainkon yaa digital wolet companiyon, masalan petm, ke liye graahakon ke aadhaar ke byore maangana jaruri he
 Mobile service providers also can no longer demand to see the identity of Aadhaar or collect biometric details before distributing a SIM card
 haalanki koi 88 karod bank khaaton or 70 karod mobile numberon ko aadhaar ke saath pehle hi joda ja chukaa he
 Actually, the judge unanimous from the verdict d
 vaai
 Chandrachud even expressed the view that all telecom companies should erase all the Aadhaar data they have collected so far
 jaj is baat se bhi raji the ki aadhaar card nahin hone kii vajah se bacchon ko talim se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa, na hi skool or shiksha board is card ko daakhilon or imtihaanon se jod sakate hai
 Despite objections and warnings about excessive use, the majority judge agreed that Aadhaar provides the most valuable service to even the most marginalized people of society, and as Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri wrote
 adaalat ne sarkaar kii yah daleel maan lee ki aadhaar kii badaulat vah kalyaan yojanaon ke phaayde chust-durust dhang se pahunchaa paati he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed that linking the Aadhaar card with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) resulted in a saving of Rs 90,000 crore
 magar centreshasit pradesh puduccheri, chandigarh or daadaraa tathaa nagar haveli main janvari 2016 or march 2017 ke bich kiye gaye ek adhyayan main niti ayog is nattejey par pahunchaa ki risaav thik vaise hi the jaise saarvajanik vitaran pranali ke tahat anke gaye the
 According to economist Ritika Kheda, "aadhaar has not been successful in closing the leak nor has it been able to bring inclusiveness in welfare programs
 '' iske bajaae, ve kahati hai, "baahar nikaal dena yaa chhod dena aadhaar ke echosystem main hi nirmit he
 "A Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice cautioned the government that" not having an Aadhaar number should not exempt a single person from taking his benefits of welfare like food grains
 ''arthshaastri jyaan drej ke liye "nyaayamurti chandrachud ke alaava duusare jaj us asli khatre ko pahchaanane se chook gaye jo aadhaar ne niztaa ke liye paidaa kar diya he
 
 
 The power that Aadhaar gives to the government to interconnect many databases and create a framework of monitoring
 ''iske baad bhi adaalat ne aadhaar kanoon kii dhara 33(2) ko radd kar diya, jo rashtriya suraksha kii bina par data saajha karne kii ijaajat detii thi
 Section 47 was also repealed, which only gave the right to the government to complain of theft of Aadhaar data
 supreme court ne sarkaar ko yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki jaldi se jaldi ek majboot data suraksha kanoon laane kii jarurat he
 Usha Ramanathan, an outspoken critic of Aadhaar, said that only Justice Chandrachud was sensitive to the ways in which the state could assert its power over citizens
 unhone daleel di ki aadhaar kanoon ko tathakthith dhan vidheyak kii shakl main paarit karke sarkaar ne dhokhadhadi se rajyasabha ko darkinar kar diya or asal main samvidhan kaa ulanghan kiya
 However, now the court has given its verdict
 aadhaar kaayam rahegaa
 But efforts have been made to reduce its effects, preventing it from becoming a tool for collecting information about citizens in the hands of both government and corporate

 According to sources, instructions for transfer of ED assistant director Niranjan Singh to Kolkata in Jalandhar were issued from the agency headquarters on Friday evening
 samajha jaataa he ki is aadhaar par unka transfar kiya gaya ki sharada or roj vaili ghotaale jaise kai mahatvapurn maamle kii vahaan jaanch chal rahi he or unki sevaaon kaa vahaan behatar istemaal hoga

 The officer was also the chief officer investigating long-term blackmoney and foreign exchange law violations in the state
 ED se jude sutron ne bataaya ki niranjan singh drug ke jis maamle kii vah jaanch kar rahe hai, usamen or unke transfar ke bich koi link nahin he
 It is felt that his services were needed in Kolkata and the regional in-charge there requested the ED headquarters to send some good officers
 unhone kaha ki niranjan singh ko ek ahm kaam par bheja gaya he
 He has been given a challenging task due to his good work
 pichley saal ek samaaroh main anya adhikariyon ke saath unhen bhi best jaanch adhikari kaa puraskaar mila tha or mani londring or femaa ulanghan maamle main unka kaam umdaa rahaa he

 Transfer to save drug addicts: Criticizing the transfer of Niranjan Singh, assistant director of Jalandhar office of BJP Enforcement Directorate, the ruling BJP and opposition Congress alleged that it was transferred at such a time to protect drug dealers , When the investigation and questioning of the people concerned were in full swing
 bijepi kii varisht netaa lakshmikanta chawla ne kaha, 'pravartan nideshaalay ke adhikari niranjan singh kaa tabadalaa dukhad he
 This makes it clear that the intention of the government is to save the business of intoxicants
 isliye us adhikari kaa jalandhar karyaalay se tabadalaa kar diya gaya he, jisane aise maamalon ko ujagar kiya tha or jaanch charam par thi
 Asked if his party's government had transferred it, Chawla said, "it has been transferred, this is the truth
" nishchit taur par punjab ke liye yah tabadalaa dukhad he
 Someone has used his influence to remove the officer from Jalandhar, who was really trying to save Punjab
 'unhone kaha, 'maine pehle bhi kaha he ki punjab main nashe ke kaarobaariyon ko bachaane ke liye hi yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 The Congress has also been heavily criticized for the transfer issue
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne ise puri tarah se pareshaan karne vaala or afsosjanak ghatnakram bataaya he
 Tiwari said that the Finance Minister should clarify the issue, as there is a coalition of Akali Dal and BJP in Punjab
 duusari ore punjab pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ne bhi chandigarh main kaha ki yah tabadalaa punjab main drug racket kii jaanch ko prabhavit karne ke liye kiya gaya he

 '---input bhashaa se Man may have reached the moon but people are still not ready to give up the mentality of untouchability
 chuaachhut kaa taaja maamla uttar pradesh ke muradabad ke thana bhojpur ilaake kaa he, jahaan nai samaaj (musalamaanon ke salamaani samudaay jinhen pehle hajjam ke taur par janaa jaataa tha) apni dukaanon main dalit (valmiki) samaaj ke bal kaatane or dadhi banane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 The Dalit (valmiki) of village Piplasana of Moradabad Police Station Bhojpur came to SSP Moradabad with a complaint
 unhone bataaya ki bhedbhaav ke chalate unke gaanv kii nai kii dukaanon par unke bal nahin kaate jate
 On this, the SSP seriously interacted with the DM and ordered a team of police and administration officials to investigate
 daliton dwaara police main kii gai shikaayat ke baad sabhi nai kii dukaane band he
 They say that they will not cut the hair of these people at any cost
 unka kahana he ki hamaare saamne kabhi inke bal gaanv kii dukaanon par katate nahin dekhe, yadi hamane inke bal kaate to hamaari birdari ke log hi hamaari dukaan par nahin aaenge
 Apart from this, some people were also seen in aggressive tone and wrong words were also used
 anya muslim logon ne bhi diya sathpipalsanaa gaanv ke nai samaaj (musalamaanon ke salamaani samudaay) ke alaava anya muslim log bhi daliton ke bal kaate jane kaa virodh karte hue nai samaaj ke saath dikhaai de rahe hai or dukaanon ke band kaa samarthan karte hue ye kah rahe hai ki dalit log ab tak jahaan se bal kataate aae hai vahiin se katwaen
 All the Muslims were seen supporting the barber society, saying their own things
 gaanv kii pradhan muslim hai
 Her husband while panchayating the Muslims on this issue said, 'our environment is very good here, but new work should not be done, it should be as it has been before
 kisi bhi haalat main maahaul kharaab nahin hone diya jaegaa, jabaki kuch log aisa hi chaahate hai
 'untouchability is over: Dalit community second and Dalit (valmiki) society people living at a distance in the same area were also seen doing panchayat of fraternity on the same issue
 birdari ke bujurg kaa kahana tha, 'hamaari to cat gai, lekin ab chuaachhut khatm honi chahie or gaanv kii dukaanon par hi or logon kii tarah hamaare bhi bal katane chahie
 Our children are unable to get married, things have worsened in kinship, without asking the names of our children, the haircuts are sent back from the shop
 'daliton kaa kahana he, 'bachche pard likh gaye hai, jamaana badal gaya he, lihaaja is puraani chuaachhut se baahar nikal kar jivan jeena chahie
 There is no discrimination of any kind in the village, everyone lives with love, so like other people, we also cut our hair at the shops in the area
 isi baat ko lekar ham birdari ke log police adhikari se mili the unhone hamen puraa aashwaasan bhi diya he
 'let me tell you that even though this case of untouchability between the Dalit and the Muslim has reached the police, but both sides are adamant on their point

 This has been revealed in a new study
 ab tak yah mana jaataa rahaa he ki zyada sharaab pine se dimag kii koshikaayen mar jaati hai, jisase insaan kii yaaddaasht khatm ho jaati he
 The new study disagreed with this, although long-term ability to remember is definitely affected
 ‘washington uniwarsity skool of medicin’ ke charles jorumasaki ne kaha ki sharaab se dimag kii koshikaon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 The fact is that this has an effect on the ability to remember for a long time
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki sharaab pine ke baad bhi insaan kai baton ko dimag main bitha saktaa he, lekin yah yaaddaasht lambey samay ke liye nahin hoti

 het spich ke kanoon kaa vistaar karne ke liye lau kamishan ne centre sarkaar se sifarish kii he
 In its report, the Commission has said that it is necessary for any vibrant democracy to have room for expressing differences and opposing views
 lekin yah matbhed aisa hona chahie jo saamaajik vyavastha kii lakshmana rekha ko na laanghe
 These differences should not be disclosed in such a way that public orders are likely to deteriorate
 philhal het spich kanoon nafrat failaane vaale bayaan ke daayre main aata he lekin iske daayre ko vyapak karne ke liye lau kamishan ne sifarish kii he
 Law Commission chairman Justice BS Chauhan has sent the recommendation to the government
 unhone kaha he ki ipisi main iske liye badlaav kii jarurat he
 The 267th report of the Law Commission recommends broadening its norms by changing the legal provision relating to hate speech or statements
 kanoon mantralay ko saunpe gaye ‘nafrat failaane vaale bayaan’ report main vidhi ayog ne kaha he ki bhartiya dand samhita ke praavdhaanon main sanshodhan karne kii jarurat he taaki ‘nafrat bhadakaane par roak’ or ‘kuch maamalon main bhay, bechaini yaa hinsa ke liye uksaane’ ke praavdhaanon ko joda ja sake
 The report says, "incitement to violence cannot be the only criterion for a hate speech
" aise bayaan jo hinsa nahin failaate hai unamem bhi samaaj ke ek hisse yaa kisi vyakti ko haashiye par dhakelne kii sambhaavna hoti he
 '' Comments report main kaha gaya he ‘‘in bayanon se kai baar hinsa nahin bhadakti balki unase samaaj main maujuuda bhedbhaavkaari rukh ko badhaava mil saktaa he
 Thus, incitement to discrimination is also an important factor that contributes to the identification of hate statements
 kamishan ne ‘nafrat bhadakaane par roak ke maamle main do saal kii sajaa or jurmaane or ‘kuch maamalon main bhay, bechaini yaa hinsa ke liye uksaane ke maamle main ek saal kii sajaa or jurmaane yaa bina jurmaane ke praavdhaan kii sifarish kii he
 The special thing is that while hearing the case in the Supreme Court in 2014, Justice Chauhan sent the issue of hate speech to the Law Commission
 philhal het spich kanoon nafrat failaane vaale bayaan ke daayre main aata he lekin iske daayre ko vyapak karne ke liye lau kamishan ne sifarish kii he

" 'tilarsan kaa yah bayaan us vakt aayaa he, jab america raashtrapati donald trump or uttar korea ke shaskakim jong unke bich jubaani jang kaaphi bad gai he

 a Kerala student has panic after being confirmed to have Nipah virus
 kerala main kul 86 logon main nipah kii ashanka ke maddenjar unke swasthya kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 4 people who come in contact with the student are being monitored
 inamen do chaatr ke dost hai or do nurse jisane uskaa ilaaj kiya tha
 In such a situation, it is feared that Nipah will spread to other states via Kerala
 ham aapako bataa den ki 2018 main bhi kerala main nipah ne pair pasaare the or kai logon kii maut ho gai thi
 What is Nipah virus? Nipah virus is a virus that can spread from animals to humans
 iskaa mukhya strot chamagadad he
 It can cause serious diseases in both animals and humans
 nipah virus sankramit suaron, chamagaadadon ke laar, mutr yaa mel dwaara sanchaarit hota he
 It can spread from one human to another via inhalation
 nipah virus ke sampark main aane par saans lene main dikkat, bukhaar, badan dard, kaph aadi kii samasya ho sakati he
 Depending on the disease, a person may go into a coma
 kahaan se aayaa nipah ?is virus kii sabase pehle pahchaan 1998 main malaysia ke nipah ilaake main hui thi
 At that time there was an infection of meningitis
 yah beemaari chamagaadadon ke jariye insaanon main aa gai
 Most of the people involved in this worked in the pig rearing center
 bharat main nipah silligudi, pashchim bengal main 2001 main or dobaaraa 2007 main paaya gaya
 In 2018 too, Nipah in Kerala caught many people
 ab yah virus kerala main phir se pair pasaar rahaa he
 What are the symptoms of Nipah virus and how to treat the symptoms of Alajipah virus are similar to meningitis
 shuruyaat main saans lene main dikkat, bukhaar, badan dard or kaph aadi kii samasya ho sakati
 The patient suffering from this has terrible headaches
 duniya ke kai deshon main failane ke baad bhi ab tak nipah virus kaa koi vaxin nahin ban paaya he
 The only cure for this is that the infected person should be kept under the supervision of doctors
 nipah se bachane ke liye kya saavdhaanee baratensaaf-safai kii sahaj aadaten jaise baar-baar haath dhonaa or bhojan acchhee tarah pakaane ke baad grahan karne se aap mastishk ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale nipah virus ke sampark main aane se batch sakate hai
 Bat saliva should be avoided
 matlab, ped se gire falon ko khaane se bachanaa chahie
 Apart from this, contact with pigs should also be avoided
 sabase jaruri he ki nipah varyas se sankramit vyakti ke sampark main aane se bachein
 Avoid visiting the areas where Nipah is spread and do not come in contact with the people there
 agar us ilaake se koi vyakti aayaa ho to uski medical jaanch karwaani chahie

 com / ozj9vlzwum Even though we have recently celebrated our 10th birthday, we may have different perceptions about Facebook
 lekin ek baat to tay he ki sahi istemaal kiya jaae to iske anek laabh hai
 You must have heard the story of yari-dosti and the growing relationship on Facebook, but the way a BDO used Facebook in Jharkhand has served to increase the importance of this social site
 10veen kii pariksha dene ja rahi 14 saal kii ushaa kii yah kahani aapako kisi feiri tail kaa anubhav de sakati he
 But this time the angel does not have a magic wand in his hands but a Facebook status under his fingers

 Then she was 11 years old

 Seeing the financial condition of the house, Usha took care of grazing the cattle of the neighborhood
 padhanaa or padhai kaa sapanousha ko padhane-likhane kaa shauk tha, isliye vah is dauraan bhi gaanv ke skool jaati rahi
 But when it came to the matriculation examination, the lack of money for the application crushed Usha's dreams
 ghar kii mali haalat dekh ushaa yah faisla le chuki thi ki ab vah aage nahin pard paaegi, lekin ek aakhri koshish ke rup main usne ilaake ke BDO pawan kumaar mahato se madad maangane kii sochi
 Hope of meeting and disappointment When Usha came to meet BDO, he was busy with work
 unhone ushaa ko baahar baithne ko kaha, lekin kaam ke boj ke kaaran vah ise bhul gaye
 Disappointed due to being late, Usha returned home
 vahiin, jab BDO pawan kumaar ghar ke liye nikle to unke sah-karmiyon ne unhen bataaya ki vah anaath ladki unase mulaakaat kii aas main aansu liye ghar laut gai
 Pawan Kumar says that this incident shook him to the inside
 pawan kumaar ke mutabik unhone ushaa ko sarkari sahaayta dene ke liye sambandhit sabhi yojanaon ko khangala, lekin ushaa kii umr isamen badi baadha banakar ai
 Trouble, anxiety and Facebook's entry points to Usha's idea of helping him was constantly troubling him, so he posted his thoughts on Facebook
 vah kehete hai, 'mahaj kuch hi ghanton main mujhe saikadon caments mili
 Among them, many friends advised Usha to adopt
 maine bhi vichaar karne ke baad god lene kaa faisla kiya
 '
 
 
 or palat gai ushaa kii kismatpavan ke ushaa ke god lene ke faisle ko fasebuk par unke kai doston ne saraahaa or is nek kaam ko jald kar daalane kii salaah di
 Today Pawan Kumar is very happy with his decision
