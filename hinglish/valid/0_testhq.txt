 Where Ashwini had Madhukalash in her hand, Dhanvantari got the nectar Kalash, because Vishnu protects the world, so Dhanvantari, who protects from diseases, was considered a part of Vishnu

 Text of Ekla Chalo Re: যদি তোর ডাক শুনে কেউ না আসে তবে একলা চলো রে
 একলা চলো, একলা চলো, একলা চলো, একলা চলো রে॥ যদি কেউ কথা না কয়, ওরে ও অভাগা,যদি সবাই থাকে মুখ ফিরায়ে সবাই করে ভয়—তবে পরান খুলেও তুই মুখ ফুটে তোর মনের কথা একলা বলো রে
 যদি সবাই ফিরে যায়, ওরে ওরে ও অভাগা, যদি গহন পথে যাবার কালে কেউ ফিরে না চায় — তবে পথের কাঁটাও তুই রক্তমাখা চরণতলে একলা দলো রে॥ যদি আলো না ধরে, ওরে ওরে ও অভাগা,যদি ঝড়-বাদলে আঁধার রাতে দুয়ার দেয় ঘরে- তবে বজ্রানলে আপন বুকের পাঁজর জ্বালিয়ে নিয়ে একলা জ্বলো রে

 bhautikee main bahut niyatank aise hai, jinke bare main vaigyanikon kaa aisa vishwaas he ki samay ke saath saath unamem koi parivartan nahin hota
 These regulators are called fundamental constants of physics
 hamaari chuni hui moulik ikaayiyon ke anusaar inkaa maan jo kuch he, sarvada vahi rahegaa
 Some examples of such constants are: the velocity of light, that is, the velocity through which the transmission of light waves takes place in zero space; Electron charge; The constant of universal gravity, ie the force by which two objects of one gram placed at a distance of one centimeter attract each other; Ice points on the thermodynamic scale, ie the temperature of ice melting, etc
 kuch moolbhoot bhautik niyatank aise bhi hai jinka sankhyatmak maan sabhi maatrak pranaaliyon main samaan hota he; inhen vimarahit bhautik niyatank kehete hai
 Burge first detailed the values of these constants in 1929
 san 1939 main danington dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan ke baad se prati duusare athwa tisare saal aisa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The best thing in these studies has been that the values of these constants have not only been found to be progressively accurate, but also that their new values have been obtained only under the errors of the old fixed values
 in niyatankon kaa thik maan gyaat karne kaa praytn bahut se vaigyanik kaaphi dinon se kar rahe hai
 Before 1929, each constant was known as a separate problem
 parantu in niyatankon main aapas main sambandh hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se is baat kii jaanch kii ja sakati he ki in niyatankon ke maanon main aapas main koi asangati dosha to nahin hai
 For example, the magnetic moment of protons can be measured by p experiments
 yah chumbakeey aghurna duusare niyatankon dwaara bhi prakat kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa sutara he p = e h / p mp c isamen e, h, mp tathaa C, kramash: electron kaa aavesh, plank niyatank, proton kii samhit evam prakaash kaa veg hai
 The value of these constants can also be determined by experiment
 chunki maapne main thodi bahut truti kii sambhaavna he, isaliye yah ho saktaa he ki sutara main e, h, mp tathaa c kaa maan rakhane par jo sankhya praapt ho, vah prayog dwaara gyaat kiye gaye p ke maan ke baraabar na ho
 Therefore, the value of all these constants should be determined in such a way that this difference is minimized
 yahan par is aapasi sambandh kaa keval ek udhaaharan diya gaya he
 Similarly, these constants also have more relationships
 in paraspar sambandhit niyatankon main sabase bada samooh parmanviya niyatankon kaa he
 Almost all constants except some can be revealed by these constants
 sabase mahatvapurn niyatank, jo inke dwaara prakat nahin kiya ja saktaa, gurutvakarshan kaa niyatank he
 Out of these constants, some key constants are chosen by which other constants can be revealed
 maan lijie aise mukhya niyatankon kii sankhya ya he
 Now some quantities are selected whose values can be measured with great precision by experiment and which can be revealed by these chosen key constants
 aisi ek maatra kaa udhaaharan proton kaa chumbakeey aghurna hai, jiskaa zikr upar kiya gaya he
 The number of these chosen quantities must be at least z
 par yadi aisi chuni hui matraaon kii sankhya "ya" se adhik ho, to hamaare paas in niyatankon kaa maan praapt karne ke liye aavashyaktaa se adhik sameekaran honge
 In such case, if we put these in any "Y" equations, we will see that there is a difference between the values obtained by calculation and those obtained by experiment
 isaliye hamen in niyatankon kaa vah maan gyaat karnaa chahie ki in chuni hui matraaon ke "ganit maanon" evam "praayogic maanon" main nunatam asangati ho
 For this, the value of these constants is determined by the least-squares method

 Monotheism or monotheism is the principle that recognizes the idea of 'god is one' or 'god is one' as the foremost
 akeshwarwadi ek hi ishwar main vishwaas karata he or keval usee kii puja-upasna karata he
 At the same time, he does not believe in any other supernatural power or deity that can be equivalent to or replace that god
 isi drushti se bahudevvaad, ekadevvaad kaa vilom siddhanth kaha jaataa he
 Philosophical pantheism, philosophical infidelism and philosophical skepticism are counted among the philosophical philosophies opposed to monotheism
 sarveshwarawad, ishwar or jagat main abhinnata maanata he
 Its tenets are - 'all are gods' and 'god is all'
 akeshwarwad keval ek ishwar kii satta maanata he
 Sarveshvarism holds the authority of both God and the world
 yadhyapi jagat kii satta ke swaroop main vaimaty he tathaapi ishwar or jagat kii ekta avashya sweekaar karata he
 By doing the philosophical metaphysics of the sentence 'god is one', it can be said that universality is God
 yah nishkarsh sarveshwarawad ke nikat he
 That is why these sentences reveal the same fact in two ways
 inkaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karne se yah prakat hota he ki 'ishwar ek he' vaakya jahaan ishwar ke sarvathitv kii ore sanket karata he vahiin 'sab ishwar hai' vaakya ishwar ke sarvavyaapakatv kii ore
 Three types of monotheism, according to the three odd forms of God, are also mentioned when considering from the time of country influence- inamen se teesraa akeshwarwad sarvaadhik vyapak he or iskaa sarveshwarawad se bahut nikatataa he
 This theory not only emphasizes the absolute power of God, but also emphasizes the inability of the world; But from different philosophical points of view, he also presents both the power and the inability of the world as two types of truths
 jagat kii asatta par bhi samaan rup se jor dene ke kaaran kuch log hindu sarveshwarawad kaa akeshwarwad ke nikat dekhte hue uske liye 'ekasmijls' shabd kaa prayog adhik sangat maanate hai
 From this point of view the power of the world is only realization
 hindu akeshwarwad main aitihaasik drushti se anek visheshtaayen dekhne main aati hai
 According to the period, they get many forms
 sarveshwarawad or bahudevvaad paraspar ghanishthabhaven sambhddha hai
 Some people place polytheism first in terms of evolution
 bhartiya dharm or chintan ke vikaas main praarambhik vaidic yug main bahudevvaad kii tathaa uttar vaidic yug main sabhi devataaon ke peeche ek param shakti kii kalpana milti he
 Secondly, although the general reader can call the Vedas polytheistic by looking at the plurality of the Vedic deities, the enlightened scholar would neither have a philosophy of polytheism nor monotheism
 vah to bhartiya dharmachintana kii ek aisi sthiti he jise un donon kaa utsa maan sakate hai
 In fact, this religious situation was not so developed that it could be oriented towards either of the two
 kintu jaise jaise dharmachintan kii gambhirtha kii pravriti badhati gai, vaise- vaise bhartiya chintna kii pravriti bhi akeshwarwad kii ore badhati gai
 The notion that ritualistic deeds automatically give their fruits also reduced the importance of the gods of polytheism
 upanishad kaal main brahmavidya kaa prachaar hone par ek ishwar athwa shakti kii vichaarna pradhan ho gai
 Despite the recognition of many deities in the Puranakas, the emphasis was on worshiping any one of them as the head
 veydant darshan kaa prabalya hone par bahudevvaadi manyataayen or bhi durbal ho gai evam ek hi ishwar athwa shakti kaa siddhanth pramukh ho gaya
 It is on these grounds that some people consider monotheism to be the fruit of serious thinking
 vastut: sampurna bhartiya dharmasadhana, chintna or sahitya ke upar vichaar karne par sarveshwarawad kii hi vyapaktaa sarvatra parilakshith hoti he
 Although this Indianism is far from the prevalent polytheism, Sarveshwarism like other countries is establishing its nexus with polytheism
 mahabharat ke narayaniopakhyaan main shwetadipiya nivaasiyon ko akeshwarwadi bhakthi se sampann kaha gaya he
 The Vishwakasena Samhita has severely criticized the Vedic people for not being a monotheist and believing in Vedic ritualistic laws
 isi prakaar bhartiya dharmachintana main akeshwarwad kaa ek or rup miltaa he
 At first the variation of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh was propounded, along with Vishnu and Brahma were sometimes considered as embodied in Shiva
 kalantar main ekta kii bhaavana bhi viksit ho gai
 Only Shiva was accused of the qualities of both the remaining deities
 vishnu ke sambandh main bhi isi prakaar kaa aarope miltaa he
 Vishnupuran considers all three as manifestations of a divine being
 yah paramatma kahin shiv rup main he or kahin vishnu rup main
 The second famous monotheism is Islamic
 keval paramatma kii satta ko sweekaar karte hue yah mat maanata he ki bahudevvaad bahut bada paap he
 God is one
