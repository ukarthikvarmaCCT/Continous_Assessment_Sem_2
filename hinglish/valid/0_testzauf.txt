 The Communal and Targeted Violence Prevention Bill is a bill in India that is currently in the process of completion
 is adhinium kaa praaroop sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii adhyaksha shrimati sonia gandhi ke netritv vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ke dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Many social organizations like the major political parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Trinamool Congress like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad are opposing this bill on the basis that this act only provides protection to minorities but The Act does not provide any protection to the majority victims of minority attacks
 is prakaar yah adhinium muslimon ke haathon main hinduon ke viruddh ek shastr ke bhaanti kaary karegaa tathaa yah bharat ke sangheey dhaanche ke liye hanikaarak siddh hoga
 == history == tesr is vidheyak ko sarvapratham manmohan singh ke netritv vaali sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii sarkaar ne 2005 main lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya tha parantu baari virodh ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne ise waapas le liya tha
 In 2011, again the government brought this bill with some amendments under which the people of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have also been brought under this bill but the opponents of this bill say that if there is any communal violence Muslims and Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes If it is between the tribes, then in that case, this bill will support the Muslims and thus to protect the Dalits
 The lit act will also become ineffective
 rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ne 14 july 2010 ko sampradayikta virdohi bill kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne ke liye ek praaroop samiti kaa gathan kiya tha or 28 april 2011 kii enesi baithak ke baad nau adhyyon or 138 dhaaraon main taiyaar hindi main anudit kiya or abhi tak kii sambhavit yojanao ke anusaar sarkaar ise 2011 ke sheetakaaleen satr main laane kii yojana par kaary kar rahi he
 The most controversial thing in this Act is that in this bill it has already been assumed that violent are only majority
 alpsankhyak nahin
 The most important aspect of the Bill is the definition of 'group'
 samooh se taatpary panthik yaa bhashaayi alpsankhyakon se he, jisamen aaj kii sthitiyon ke anuroop anusuchit jatiyon or anusuchit janajatiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The biggest objection in the entire Bill is on the same point that the majority community is excluded from the language of the group
 khand 6 main yah spasht kiya gaya he ki is vidheyak ke antargat aparaadh un aparaadhon ke alaava he jo anusuchit jati evam janajati adhinium, 1989 ke adheen aate hai
 
 is vidheyak ke virdohi yah prashn puch rahe hai
 Whether a person can be punished twice for the same crime? khand 7 main nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki kisi vyakti ko un halaat main yon sambandhi aparaadh ke liye doshi mana jaayegaa yadi vah kisi 'samooh se sambandh rakhane vaale vyakti ke, jo us samooh kaa sadsy he, viruddh koi yon aparaadh karata he
 But if the victim is not a member of that group then it will not be considered a crime
 This will have the direct effect that if there is any sexually abusive rape of a Hindu woman in the event of communal riots then it will not fall under the category of crime as it would not fall under the definition of Hindu women's group
 khand 8 main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki 'ghrinaa sambandhi prachaar un halaat main aparaadh mana jaayegaa jab koi vyakti maukhik taur par yaa likhit taur par yaa spashtatya amyavedan karke kisi 'samooh aav kisi 'samooh se sambandh rakhane vaale vyakti ke viruddh ghrinaa failaata he
 The bill is silent in the event of the PS group spreading hatred against the majority
 yatnaa diye jane sambandhi aparaadh kaa varnan khand 12 main kiya gaya he, jisamen koi sarkari karmchaaree kisi 'samooh se sambandh rakhane vaale vyakti ko pidaa pahunchaata he yaa maansik athwa shaareerik chot pahuchaata he
 Opponents say that if a minority hurts a majority or causes mental or physical injury, it is objectionable to keep this bill silent in that regard
 khand 13 main kisi sarkari vyakti ko is vidheyak main ullikhit aparaadhon ke sambandh main apni duty nibhaane main dhilaai baratane ke liye dandit kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 Clause 14 provides for punishing these government persons who control the Armed Forces or the Security Forces
 or apni kaman ke logon par kargar dhang se apni duty nibhaane hetu niyantran rakhane main asafal rahete hai
 
 is khand kaa is aadhaar par virodh ho rahaa he ki isse shasastra balon le manobal par vipareet prabhaav padegaa| The principle of delegated liability is given in section 15
 kisi sanghathan kaa koi varisht vyakti athwa padaadhikari apane adheen adhinsth karmchaariyon par niyantran rakhane main naakaamayaab rahata he, to yah us dwaara kiya gaya ek aparaadh mana jayega
 He will be delegated liable for an offense which has been committed by some others
 is prakaar agar kisi sanghathan kaa ek bhi vyakti alpsankhyak samudaay ke viruddh kisi aparaadh main lipt paaya jaataa he to puure sanghathan ko dandit kiya ja saktaa he
 The Act has been drafted by 22 members of the National Advisory Council, headed by Smt
 Sonia Gandhi
 is vidheyak ke praaroop ke banane vaali samiti ke sadsy nimnlikhit hai
 The bill states that 'organized communal and targeted violence will constitute internal disturbance within the meaning of Article 355 of the Constitution of India and the Central Government may take such measures as may be required in relation to the nature and circumstances of the case, in accordance with the duties mentioned under it' Ho

 Missile Threat Report: "the range of Jericho 3 also provides an extremely high-impact speed to the surrounding targets, enabling it to evade any anti-ballistic missile defenses that may develop in the immediate area

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic obstructive airway disease, and others, is a type of obstructive pulmonary disease that is characterized by chronic poor airflow
 aam taur par yah samay ke saath bigadataa jaataa he
 Its main symptoms include decreased respiration, cough, and phlegm production
 chronic bronchitis se peedit adhikansh logon ko siopidi hota he
 Tobacco smoking is a common cause of COPD, with many other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing similar roles
 vikasshil desh main vaayu pradooshan kaa aam strot kharaab vaatayan vaali bhojan pakaane kii vyavastha or garmi ke liye aag jalaane se sambandhit he
 These irritant causes are due to long-term exposure to inflammatory response in the lungs, which causes the airways to become smaller and rupture of lung tissue called emphysema
 iskaa nidaan kharaab vayupravah par aadhaarit he jisaki gananaa fefdon ke kaaryakshmata pareekshanon se kii jaati he
 Unlike asthama, the reduction in airflow is not significantly improved when given the medication
 gyaat kaarnon se anaavaran ko kam karke siopidi kii rokthaam kii ja sakati he
 This includes efforts to reduce the rate of smoking and improve the indoor and outdoor air quality
 siopidi upachaar main:dhumrapaan chhodana, tikaakaran, punarvaas or aksar shwasan vaale brankodailator or steroed shaamil hote hai
 Some people require long-term oxygen treatment or lung transplantation
 ve log jinamein those who have periods of gambhir kharabi ke lakshan hon unke liye dawaaon kaa badha hua upyog or aspataal main upachaar kii jarurat pad sakati he
 COPD affects 329 million people worldwide, or about 5% of the population
 2012 main is vishwavyaapee mauton ke kaarnon main teesraa sthaan hasil tha kyonki isse 3 million logon kii maut hui thi
 The increase in the number of deaths is expected due to the high rate of smoking and the aging of the population in many countries
 2010 main iske chalate $2
1 trillian kii raashi kaa vyay hua
 The most common symptoms of COPD are phlegm, shortness of breath, and productive cough
 ye lakshan lambii avadhi ke liye bane rahete hai or aam taur par samay ke saath bigadate jate hai
 It is unclear whether there are different types of COPD
 jabaki pehle inako amphisema or jeern bronchitis main vibhajit kiya jaataa tha, amphisema fefdon main parivartan kaa ek varnan maatra he na ki koi rog or jeern bronchitis maatr un lakshanon kaa vyaakhyaata he jo siopidi main upasthit ho sakate hai yaa nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 The first symptom is a chronic cough
 jab yah do varshon ke liye saal main teen maah se adhik samay tak upasthit rahe or bina anya kisi spasht kaaran ke kaph kii upasthiti ke saath bani rahe to paribhaasha ke anusaar yah jeern bronchitis he
 This condition can occur before COPD is fully developed
 kaph kii maatra ghanto se lekar dinon tak main badal sakati he
 In some cases, cough may not occur or may occur only occasionally or may not be productive
 siopidi se peedit kuch logon main "dhumrapaan karne vaale kii khaansee "ke lakshan hote hai
 Kapha can be swallowed or sprung, depending on social and cultural factors
 gambhir khaansee ke chalate pasli main fracture yaa halki si behoshiho sakati he
 People suffering from COPD often experience the "common cold" that persists for a long time
 saans kii kami vah lakshan he jo logon ko aksar buhat chintit karata he
 It is usually expressed with phrases such as: "I have to try to breathe," "my breath is bloating," or "I can't get enough air
" haalanki bhinn samskritiyon main bhinn vaakyansh istemaal hote hai
 Generally, after a long period of exertion, there is shortness of breath and it worsens over time
 baad kii avasthaa main yah aaraam ke samay hoti he or hameshaa bani rah sakati he
 Life becomes of concern and poor quality for people suffering from COPD
 adhik viksit siopidi sikude hothon se saans lenaa vaale log va yah tarika kuch logon main saans kii kameen kii samasya ko kam karne main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 In COPD, it may take longer to inhale than to inhale
 seene main kasaav ho saktaa he lekin yah aam nahin he or kisi anya samasya kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 In people with obstructed airflow, a low noise is heard along with a rattle or air penetration while examining the chest with a stethoscope
 bairal chaati / dhol vaksh siopidi kaa charitrik chihn he, lekin yah tulanaatmak rup se utana aam nahin hai
 In case of worsening of this disease, a standing position on the knee can occur
 viksit siopidi ke kaaran fefdon kii keshikaon par ucch daab paidaa ho saktaa he jo ki hriday ke daahine nilaypar dabaav paidaa karata he
 This condition is called cor pulmonale and due to this, symptoms like swelling of the feet and emergence of neck veins occur
 siopidi, cor pulmonaille ke kisi anya fefde ke rog se adhik aam kaaran he
 Cor pulmonal supplementation has become less common due to the use of oxygen
 siopidi aksar anya paristhitiyon ke saath hota he jiske liye saajha jokhim kaarak uttaradaayi hote hai
 Under these conditions: ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder and depression
 gambhir rog se peedit logon main hameshaa thakaan kaa ehsaas hona aam he
 Nail clubbing is not specific to COPD and for this, lung cancer screening should be considered
 siopidi ke gambhir prakopen ko saans kii badi hui kameen, bade hue kaph utpaadan, kaph ke rang kaa hare yaa pile ho jane yaa siopidi se peedit kisi vyakti main khaansee ke badhane se nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 It may present with signs of aggressive breathing such as rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, sweating, active use of neck muscles, bluish tint and tingling in the skin, or an increased rate of respiration or severe bloating
 stethoscope ke saath pareekshan karne par chote visphot jaisi dhvaviyaan suni ja sakati he
 The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoking, professional exposure and pollution of indoor fires in some countries
 aam taur par lakshanon ke vikaas se pehle in anavaranon kaa kai dashakon tak hona jaruri he
 a person's genetic structure also affects risk
 vaishvik rup se siopidi kaa praathmik kaaran tambaakoo kaa dhumrapanhai, unamem se lagbhag 20% ko siopidi hoga, or ve jo jivan bhar dhumrapaan karte hai unamem se aadhon ko siopidi hoga
 In the United States and the UK, 80–95% of people suffering from COPD either currently smoke or previously
 siopidi ke viksit hone kii sambhaavna kul dhumr anaavaranke saath badhati he
 Additionally, women are more likely to be affected by smoke than men
 dhumrapaan na karne waalon main, dwitiya shrenee ke dhumrapaan vaale logon main se aise 20% logon main yah hota he
 Other types of smoke such as hemp, cigars and hookahs are also at risk
 garbhavastha ke dauraan dhumrapaan karne vaali mahilaon ke bachche main siopidi kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 Indoor air pollution caused by fires of cooking stoves using biomass fuels such as coal or wood and animal dung is the most common cause of COPD in developing countries
 ye aag lagbhag 3 billian logon ke liye khaanaa pakaane va garmi karne kaa mukhya saadhan hai, inkaa prabhaav inase adhik anaavrutt hone vaali mahilaon par apekshaakrit adhik he
 They are used as the main source of energy in 80% of households in India, China and Sub Saharan Africa
 gramin kshetron kii tulana main bade shaharon main rahane vaale logon main siopidi kii dar ucch hoti he
 While urban air pollution is a more profound contributing factor, its role in causing COPD remains unclear
 kharaab bahya vaayu gunvattta vaale kshetra jinamein akzast gas vaale kshetra shaamil hai, aam taur par siopidi kii adhik dar pradarshit karte hai
 The overall effect is still minimal compared to smoking
 kaarysthal kii dhulon, rasyanon tathaa dhumron ke dderghaavadhi anaavaran ke kaaran dhumrapaan karne va naa karne vaale, dono prakaar ke logon main siopidi kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 Workplace disclosures are believed to account for 10–20% of cases
 sanyukt rajya america main, kabhi bhi dhumrapan na karne vaale logon main siopidi ke 30% se adhik maamalon ke liye yah kaaran uttaradaayi he or sambhawatah paryaapt viniimon se vanchit deshon main ye adhik bada jokhim prastut karata he
 a number of industries and sources have been blamed for this, including high levels of dust in the coal mining, gold mining and cotton textile industries, and profession related to cadmium and isocyanates and fumes emanating from welding
 krishi kshetra main kaam karnaa bhi jokhim bharaa he
 In some professions, the risk situation is such that those people are smoking cigarettes daily for half to two packets
 silica dhul anaavaran ke kaaran bhi siopidi ho saktaa he jiskaa jokhim silicosiske liye jokhim se asambandhit he
 The negative effects of exposure to dust and exposure to cigarette smoking are more than additive or additive
 anuvanshiki siopidi ke vikaas main ek bhamika nibhaati he
 It is comparatively more common in people whose relatives are associated with smoke and who have COPD
 vartmaan samay main keval ekmaatr viraasati jokhim alpha 1-antitrpsin kami he
 This risk is higher in those with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and also with smoking habits
 yah lagbhag 1-5% maamalon ke liye uttaradaayi he or yah sthiti lagbhag prayek 10,000 logon main 3-4 main upasthit hoti he
 Other genetic factors are being discovered, which are likely to be many
 bahut saare anya kaarak bhi hai jo siopidi ke saath kam nazadiiki se jude hai
 This risk is higher among those who are poor, although it is not yet clear whether this is due to poverty itself or with other factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution, malnutrition, etc
 is baat ke kuch pramaan hai ki asthma va vayumarg ucch pratikriyaatmakataa siopidi ke jokhim ko badhaate hai
 Birth related factors such as low birth weight also have a role and in the same way many infectious diseases like HIV / AIDS and TB
 shwasan sankraman jaise nimonia siopidi ke jokhim ko kam se kam vayaskon main to badhaate hue nahin dikhte hai
 a severe intensity usually begins due to other factors such as infection or environmental pollutants or sometimes inappropriate use of drugs
 50 se 75% maamalon main sankraman kaaran dikhataa he jisamen se 25% main bacteria, 25% main virus, tathaa 25% main dono dikhte hai
 Environmental pollutants include the quality of air and external air
 nijee dhumrapaan tathaa dwitiyak dhumrapaan se anaavaran jokhim ko badha detaa he
 Cold temperatures also play a role in this, as the intensity is higher in winter
 ve log jinamein antarnihit rog gambhir hota he unamem prakopen bhi adhik baar hota he: halke rogam main 1
8 prati varsh, madhyam main 2 se 3 prati varsh or gambhir main 3
4 prati varsh
 In which occlusion occurs many times, the rate of decrease in lung function is faster
 pulmonary embylai un logon main lakshanon ko or kharaab kar sakate hai jinako pehle se piopidi kii samasya hoti he
 COPD is a type of obstructive pulmonary disease in which chronic incomplete reflexes cause poor airflow and inability to completely exhale
 kharaab vaayu pravaah fefde ke utakon kii tuutfoot or pratirodhatmak shwasanalikashoth ke naam se jane vaale chote vayumarg rog kaa parinaam hota he
 The comparative contributions of these two factors may vary between different people
 vayumarg kii gambhir kshati, bulaai ke naam se jane vaale bade vaayu kshetron kaa nirmaan kar sakati he jo fefde ke utakon ko pratisthapit kar detaa he
 This type of disease is called Bunyis emphysema
 siopidi shwasit avarodhon ke prati jeern phulav pratikriya ke rup main viksit hota he
 Chronic bacterial infections can also cause this inflammatory phase
 in phulav vaali koshikaon main do prakaar kii shwet rakt koshikaayen neutrophil granulochites or macrophesso shaamil hoti hai
 Those who smoke additionally include TC1 lymphocytes and some people with COPD include eosinifol, similar to asthma sufferers
 is koshikeey pratikriya kaa kuch bhaag chemotectic karkonjise bhadakaau madhyasthon ke kaaran hota he
 Other processes associated with lung damage include oxidative stress and proteases produced by high amounts of free radicals in tobacco smoke and by inflammatory cells
 fefdon ke sanyoji utakon ke kaaran amphisema hota he jo kharaab vayupravah ko badhaata he or antat avasorana ke saath shwasan gaison ko kharaab karata he
 Partial causes of normal muscle wasting in COPD may be inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood
 vayumargon kaa sankuchan unke bheetar sujan va kshati se hota he
 This creates an inability to completely exhale
 vaayu pravaah main sabase teji se kami saans baahar nikaalane main aati he kyonki seene main daab vypmargon ko ek saath sampeedit kar rahaa hota he
 Because of this, a lot of air from the previous breath remains in the lungs when the next respiration starts, resulting in an increase in the total amount of air in the lungs at any given time, a process known as hyperinflation or air entrapment
 vyaayaam se judaa hyperinflation siopidi main saans kii kami se judaa he kyonki jab fefdon main pehle se kuch hawa bhari ho to shwasan karnaa kam aaramdaayak hota he
 Some people have some degree of airway hyperresponsiveness similar to those with asthma
 nimna oxigen str or antat rakt main ucch carbon daai oxide str, vayumarg baadha, belgaum sujan or saans lene ke liye kam ichha se ghate vaatayan ke kaaran gas vinimayahota he
 Inflammation in the airways also increases during stimulation due to which hyperinflation increases, external respiratory airflow decreases and gas transfer is impaired
 iske kaaran aparyaapt vaatayan or antat rakt main oxigen kaa str ghat jaataa he
 If low oxygen levels persist for a long time, they cause arterial contraction in the lungs, while emphysema causes rupture of capillaries in the lungs
 in dono parivartanon ke kaaran phuffusiya dhamniyonmen raktadab badhata he jisase cor pulmonaille ho saktaa he
 a diagnosis of COPD should be considered in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has breathing problems or a chronic cough, phlegm, or frequent colds, or exposure to disease risk factors
 History phir spirometry ko nidaan kii pushti ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Spirometry measures the amount of airflow present and is usually performed after the use of bronchodilators, a drug that opens the airways
 nidaan ke liye do mukhya ghatak upyog kiye jate hai: ek senked main balaat nickshwasan maatra, jo ki shwasan ke pehle second main nikaali gayi vaayu kii sabase badi maatra he or balaat mahatvapurn kshamta, jo ki ek baar main badi saans ke madhyam se nickshwasit vaayu kii sabase badi maatra he
 Normally 75–80% of FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1 / FVC ratio of less than 70% determines the symptoms of COPD
 in maapon ke aadhaar par spirometry bujurgon main siopidi kaa atirikt-nidaan kar sakati he
 For the National Institute of Clinical Excellence criteria, FEV1 should additionally be less than 80% of the estimate

 The peak expiratory flow, commonly used in asthma, is not sufficient for the diagnosis of COPD
 yah nirdhaarit karne ke kai tareeke hai ki koi vyakti siopidi se kitna prabhavit he
 Modified British Medical Research Council questionnaires or COPD assessment tests are simple questionnaires that can be used to determine the severity of symptoms
 Scores on CAT range between 0–40 series, with higher scores, with the disease being more severe
 spirometry ke dwaara airflo kii seemaa kii gambhirtha ko nirdhaarit karne main madad mil sakati he
 It is usually based on FEV1, expressed as a percentage of "normal" based on predictability by age, sex, height, and weight of the individual

 Gokula organized the farmers and refused to collect taxes

 Gokula was taken captive and killed on 1 January 1670 at Agra Fort in pieces to terrorize the public

 The Rajput servants of the Mughal Empire also started becoming dissatisfied within themselves, but as Dalpat Singh, the author of "dalpat Vilas" has clearly stated, Rajput leaders could not dare to revolt against the Mughal rule

 When no Mughal commander could defeat him, in the end, Emperor Aurangzeb himself had to suppress the public outrage by taking a huge army

 Few people will be aware that the sacrifice of Veerwar Gokulsingh took place 6 years before Guru Tegh Bahadur
 disambar 1675 main guru tegbahadur kaa vadh karaayaa gaya tha - dilli kii mogul kotwali ke chabutare par jahaan aaj gurudwara sheeshganj shaan se mastak uthaaye khadaa he
 It is because of the giving of the head by the Guru that the Gurudwara is called Shishganj
 duusari ore, jab ham us mahapurush kii ore drushti daalate hai jo guru tegbahadur se 6 varsh purv shahid hua tha or unhi mulyon kii raksharth shahid hua tha or jisko dilli kii kotwali par nahin, agre kii kotwali ke lambey-chaude chabutare par, hajaaron logon kii haahaakaar karti bheed ke saamne, lohe kii zanjeeron main jakadakar laayaa gaya tha or jisko-janata kaa manobal todane ke iraade se badi pashachikta ke saath, ek-ek jod kulhadiyon se katkar maar daalaa gaya tha, to hamen kuch najar nahin aata
 Gokulsinh was not only martyred for the Jats, nor was his state taken away by anyone, he did not take any pension off, but in front of him, he was incensed with the desire to reconcile the mighty Mughal authority, Deenatapuravak
 shame aati he ki ham aise apratim vir ko kaagaj ke upar bhi sammaan nahin de sake
 How thankful we are, how ungrateful our Hindu society is! The royal historians did not even mention him
 guru tegbahadur kii giraftaar or vadh kaa ullekh kisi bhi samakaleen farsi itihasgranth main nahin he
 Akbar himself did not go to fight Rana Pratap of Mewar, but had to go to fight those Jat warriors of Braj himself

 It is unfortunate that there is no mention of these adventurous and true sons of India by the so-called historians who flourished on the royal units
 hamen unki jaankaree manuchee naamak europea yatri ke vrutanton se hoti he
 In his words, see a unique picture, which is rare in the history of any other country or caste: sar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai - "musalamaanon kii dharmandhata purna niti ke falswaroop mathura kii pavitra bhoomi par sadaiv hi vishesh aghat hote rahe hai
 Being situated on the highway from Delhi to Agra, Mathura has always attracted special attention
 vahaan ke hinduon ko dabaane ke liye aurangzeb ne abdunnavi naamak ek kattar musalmaan ko mathura kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 In the beginning of 1678, a group of Abdunnavi's soldiers went out to collect rent in the Mathura district
 Abdunavi established a new cantonment near Gokulsingh last year
 sabhi kaarywahi kaa sadar mukaam yahi tha
 On Gokul Singh's call, the farmers refused to pay the rent
 The Mughal soldiers started opening up from looting to the thorns of the peasants
 The struggle just started
 tabhi aurangzeb kaa nayaa farmaan 9 april 1669 aayaa - "kaafiron ke madrase or mandir gira die jaaen"
 falat: braj kshetra ke kai ati pracheen mandiron or mathon kaa vinaash kar diya gaya
 The Kushans and the Gupta period fund, the priceless heritage of history, sabotage, glansless, limbless were dispersed in thousands

 And clouds of smoke and lighted flames were seen - the porcupine carving out of them

 The remaining Mughals fled

 Its smoke and flames rose so high that it was quickly visible in the palaces of Agra and Delhi

 Not only Mathura, but also from the Agra district, the flag of the royal flag was flown and piled up in Agra city and fort

 They saw that the toxins of the Mughal power could be broken

 Finally in September month, completely disappointed, Shaf Shikan Khan sent a treaty proposal to Gokulsingh that- 1
 badshaah unako kshamaadaan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 2
 They return all the looted salmon
 3
 vachan den ki bhavishya main vidroh nahin karenge
 Gokulsingh asked what is my crime, which i will apologize to the emperor? Your king should apologize to me, because he has insulted my religion very much, causing great harm
 duusare uske kshamaa daan or minnat kaa bharosa is sansar main koun karata he? It was futile to proceed with the treaty
 gokulasinh ne koi gunjaais hi nahin chodi thi
 Aurangzeb's idea was that Gokulsingh would also be wooed by giving him the title of 'raja' or 'thakur' and another Mughal pet would be increased
 His deliberate plan to make India 'darul Islam' will continue to move forward smoothly
 But in front of Gokulsingh, his code policy was badly defeated
 at: aurangzeb swayan ek badi sena, topon or toptiyon ke saath, apane is abhootpurv pratidwandi se nipatane chal padaa
 paramparaayen or maryaada tuutane kaa yah ek aisa jwalanth or prerak udhaaharan he, jidhar itihaaskaaron kaa dhyaan nahin gaya he
 According to the account of the European traveler Manuchi, Akbar had to go first and now Aurangzeb, whose empire was not only in the Mughals but was the largest of all hindu-muslim rulers till that time
 yah thi veeravar gokulasinh kii mahanata
 dilli se chalakar aurangzeb 28 navambar 1669 ko mathura ja pahunchaa
 Many of Gokulsinh's soldiers and generals who were not salaried, were people inspired by the revolution, moved to Agra district in the neighborhood in connection with Rabi sowing
 aurangzeb ne apni chhavnee mathura main banaai or vahaan se sampoorn yuddh sanchaalan karne laga
 Gokulsingh was being surrounded
 usne ek or senapati hasan ali khan ko ek majboot or susajjit sena ke saath mursaan kii ore se bheja
 hasan ali khan ne 4 disambar 1669 kii praat: kaal ke samay achaanak chapa markar, jaaton kii teen gadhiyaan - revada, chandrarakh or sarakhru ko gherliya
 In front of the shoots of royal cannons and guns, these small strongholds could not prove to be very useful and broke down very quickly
 hasan ali khan kii safaltaaon se khush hokar aurangzeb ne shaf shikan khan ke sthaan par use mathura kaa faujadaar bana diya
 Amanullah Khan from Agra Pargana, Faujdar Namdar Khan of Moradabad, Faujdar Hoshayar Khan of Agra city arrived with their respective forces to help him
 This huge army surrounded Gokulsinh and started moving forward
 gokulasinh ke viruddh kiya gaya yah abhiyaan, un akramanon se vishaal str kaa tha, jo bade-bade rajyon or vahaan ke raajaaon ke viruddh hote aae the
 This valor had neither big fortifications, nor the Aravalli hills nor a diverse geographical region like Maharashtra
 Despite these disastrous conditions, the patience and tact with which they faced the central power of a powerful empire, achieved equal results, is unprecedented
 disambar 1669 ke antim saptaah main tilapat se 20 mile dur, gokulasinh ne shahi senaaon kaa saamana kiya
 The Jats attacked the Mughal army with a firm determination and fierce anger
 subah se shaam tak yuddh hota rahaa
 No decision could be made
 duusare din fir ghamaasan chhid gaya
 The Jats were at war with supernatural valor
 mogul sena, topakhane or jirahabakhtar se susajjit ghudsavaar senaaon ke hote huue bhi gokulasinh par vijay praapt na kar sake
 There have been fewer wars in the history of India where many of the obstructed and weaker sides have fought with such calm determination and steadfast patience
 haldi ghati ke yuddh kaa nirnay kuch hi ghanton main ho gaya tha
 All the three wars of Panipat had ended in one day, but the war of Veerwar Gokulsinh also continued on the third day
 tisare din, fir bhayankar sangram hua
 About it, a historian says that the Jat invasion was so strong that the royal army's feet were uprooted, but then a new crowning Mughal army came under the leadership of Hasan Ali Khan
 is sena ne gokulasinh kii vijay ko paraajay main badal diya
 Emperor Alamgir's honor was saved

 From the third day, a fierce war broke out here and continued for three days
 baari topon ke bich tilapat kii gadhi bhi iske aage tik nahin saki or uskaa patan ho gaya
 After the fall of Tilpat, Gokulsingh and his tau Uday Singh were taken as family captives
 unke saat hajaar saathi bhi bandi hue
 in sabko agra laayaa gaya
 Aurangzeb had already arrived and was ensconced in the Red Fort's crazy mango
 sabhi bandiyon ko uske saamne pesh kiya gaya
 Aurangzeb said - adhisankhya jaaton ne kaha - "badshaah, agar tere khuda or rasul kaa kaa rasta vahi he jis par tu chal rahaa he to hamen tere raste par nahin chalanaa
" The next day, Gokulsingh and Uday Singh were brought to Agra Kotwali - a body bound in iron, tied hands, neck to foot
 The first ax of the executioner ran on the shapely arm of Gokulsinh, when a mass of thousands of people got up crying
 His right arm, dislocated with an ax, started to fall and fell on the platform
 parantu us vir kaa mukh hi nahin sharir bhi nishkamp tha
 He cast an eye on the fountain, and then looked at the executioners to strike another
 parantu jallaad jaldi main nahin the
 He had similar instructions
 duusare kulhaade par hajaaron log aartnaad kar uthe
 unamem hindu or musalmaan sabhi the
 Many closed their eyes
 Many escaped crying

 One was not aware of the other

he rahim !! idhar agra main gokulasinh kaa sir gira, udhar mathura main keshavaraiji kaa mandir ! Samaraveer Gokula: Poetry of the Kisan Revolution rajasthan ke sammanit evam purashkrut kaviver shri balvir singh ‘karun’ apane geetikavy or prabandhkavy kii pragatisheel bhartiya jivan drushti or prabhaavapurn shabdashilp ke kaaran ab akhil bhartiya str par charchit hai
 Karun ji, inspired by Rashtrakavi Dinkar's poetry, has been decorated with the title of Dinkar ji's Aksharputra in Nalanda's thought meeting
 is ojasvi or manasvee kavi ne ‘samarvir gokula’ naamak prabandh kavy kii rachana kar satrahavin sadi ke ek upekshit adhyay ko jeevant kar diya he
 When this country, which is concerned about varna-caste and heaven-class, forgets itself
 konne main khaaj kii tarah vampanthi itihaaskaar or sahityakar swatantray sangharsh ke itihaas ke prishthon ko hataa detaa he
 But the progressive national poetry stream has throbbed with new heat and new energy and held its writing
 parinaam he-‘samarvir gokula’
 It should be remembered that even in the beautiful environment of Reetikal, all Sri Guru Govind Singh, Lalkavi, Bhushan, Sudan and Chandrashekhar composed the heroic poetry
 unki prerana bhoomi rashtriya bhaavana hi thi
 In the modern era, Balvir Singh 'karun' made a grand presentation of 'samar Veer Gokula' in the first decade of the twenty-first century after 'vijay Ketu' and 'I speak Dronacharya'
 yah ‘vijay ketu’ kii kavyakala tathaa pragatisheel itihaas drushti ke utkarsh kaa pramaan he
 'samaraveer Gokula is a national poem of the seventeenth century peasant revolution
 kavi ne bhoomika main likhaa he- ‘maharana pratap, maharana raaj singh, chhatrapati shivaji, hasan khan mewati, guru govind singh, mahavir gokula tathaa bharatpur ke jat shaskaon ke alaava aise or adhik naam nahin ginaye ja sakate jinhone mughal satta ko khulkar lalakaara ho
 Veer Gokula should be named prominently because he laughed under the nose of Delhi and set up an army of 20 thousand peasant soldiers, who were unpaid, untrained and equipped with domestic weapons
 yah baat vistaar ke liye na bhuulakar raashtra kii raksha hetu pranarpan karne aaye the
 ' shyaamanarayan pandeya rachit ‘haldighati’, pan mohanlal mahato ‘viyogi’ pranit ‘aryavartt’, prabhatakrut ‘rashtrapurush’ or shrikrishna ‘saral’ ke prabandh kavy kii charchaa band he
 'tulsidas' and 'shivaji's letter' composed by Nirala are both neglected
 dinakar or nepali ke kavy vismrit kiye ja rahe hai
 However, the compositions of progressive Indian way of life in poetry begin to come up with new consciousness
 pramaan he-‘samarvir gokula’ kii prashansit prastuti
 The inspiration of this poem was such that it was written in just forty days
 iskaa mahaduddeshy aisa ki bhartiya itihaas kaa ek sangharkshil adhyay kavyarup dhaaran kar kavyangat main dhyaan aakrisht karne laga
 Medieval gallantry and martyrdom came alive in national consciousness and started echoing in management
 upeshit jat kisaan kaa tejomay samarpit vyaktitv apane tej se damak uthaa
 In history, the character of the repressed Narnahar Gokul came in front of everyone in the verses
 aath sargon kaa yah prabandhkavy ikkisvin sadi ke pratham dashak kaa mahatvapurn avdaan he
 The poet has endured the suffering of Gokul born in the peasant clan of Mathura
 us peeda ne rashtriya sandarbh main upekshit ko kavyanjali dene kaa prayaas kiya he
 Remember the compassion of the poet, etc
 Then the importance of inspiration of the poet 'karun' will become clear
 isiilie kavi ne pratham satr main gokul ke kisaan vyaktitv ko mughal badshaah ke samaksh prastut kiya he
 Gokul was replaced by the Nikash of the supremacy of the High God
 atah kisaan-majdoor-dalit ke utthan ke yug main gokul kii upeksha kab tak hoti! usne to kisaan jivan ke astitv evam asmita ke liye aamaran sangharsh kiya
 Resolved to oppose peasant repression by foreign Mughal rule
 videshi mughal shashan dwaara kisaan daman ke virodh kaa sankalp kiya
 That is why the poet has written in the first canto- kavi ne mahasoos kiya he ki tilapat kaa gokul shahenshaah aurangzeb ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ban gaya tha
 But what did your loved ones do? - kavi ne duusare sarg main yug kii visham sthitiyon or bhartiya ashavad ko aitihaasik or prakritik sandarbh main apni kavyakala dwaara chitrit kar diya he
 The time cycle of nature arouses hope - bhartiya drushti kii maanviya jijeevishaa tathaa aashaa ke manohar rup dekhen - In Brijmandal, the hero Gokul was born
 yahi ashavad kaa aadhaar bana
 The third canto is a panorama of the farmer life of Gokul - in images and paintings
 kisaan jivan kaa aisa varnan-chithran anyatra viral he
 The feel of the poet is presented with his condolences and shrewd fun
 faltah yah kisaan jivan kaa prabandh kavy ban gaya he
 But the farmer could not fill his stomach during the Mughal rule
 karadhaan bhayaavah tha
 Jaziya was charged as a terrible punishment for the Kafir farmer
 atah peeda gaharaati jaati thi
 But the poet has not been able to describe the hard and fast rule of Mughal rule
 pratyaksh atyaachaar se rosh-aakrosh or vidroh kaa varnan swaabhaavik rup main chauthe sarg main kiya he
 This canto has become a concept of revolution and conflict resolution
 sach he ki mathura ke kisaan kanha or baldau ke ansh na the
 Remembering his pride, he started thundering like a lion
 kavi kii rashtriya chetana keval mathura or jat kisaan kii baat nahin karti
 He remembers the blood of India
 tabhi to dilli kaa takht saham uthaa
 On the other hand, twenty thousand farmers got organized and stood against the throne
 kavi kii lekhnee kii pragatisheel drushti dekhen- The public awakened by connecting with the culture
 mughal atyaachaar ke viruddh gokul kaa jayakaar hone laga
 The struggle started
 kavi ne aage kii teen sargon main gokul or uski kisaan kranti sena ke swatantray sangram kaa pramanik varnan kiya he
 From the national point of view, the repressive forms of Mughal rule, the resentment of the peasants and the bravery of the united struggle are the characteristics of this war
 kavi ne satrahavin sadi kii kisaan sena ke sangram ko ikkisvin sadi main dikhaakar ek nayi rashtriya chetana sfoort kar di he
 This neglected chapter is inspiring the dust by showing its stunning form
 kavi karun ne paanchaven tathaa chathe sarg main sadabad or tilapat ke bheeshan sangharsh ko apni chirparichit varnan style main tathaa bimbpurn shilp se pratyaksh kar diya he
 Such is the personality of the hero Gokul Kavya - aise shauryashirsh gokul ne mughal chhavnee sadabad par adhikaar karke mughalon ko hatprabh kar diya tha
 But historians ignored it
 atah kavi ne likh diya he- These historians remain silent on the foreign tyrannical form of the Mughals
 par kavi balvir singh ne gokul ke shaury se ghabaraaye aurangzeb kaa sajiv chithran kar diya he - His throne shook
 samrajya kaa bhugol simatata gaya
 Therefore Aurangzeb himself came in 1669 with a big army
 gokul ke kendra tilapat main bheeshan sangram hone laga
 See a picture of that war - yruddh chalata rahaa
 The strength of the Mughal army increased
 tilapat par dabaav badhata rahaa
 Gokul was at war with his uncle Uday Singh till the last moment
 paraajay niyati ban gayi
 Imprisoned and brought before Aurangzeb
 usne nirbhik bhav se atyaachaari shahenshaah ke prati apni ghor ghrinaa vyakt kar di
 The seventh canto is the proof
 aurangzeb is tejasvi kisaan nayak ko dekh dang rah gaya
 He sentenced to death

 vidhi yaa kanoon jin ekakon ko mukaadama chalaane yaa jinpar mukadmaa chalavane kii suvidha detaa he, unhen vidhik vyaktitv praapt hota he
 Various organizations had such personality since long time ago
 vidhik vyaktitv kii pratha kaa udai pracheen rome main hua
 By the way, it was prevalent in Greece, Finland and Bavilonia
 vidhik vyaktitv sab vyaktiyon ko praapt nahin hota, kyonki sab mukadmaa chalaane yaa chalavane ke yogya nahin hote
 In ancient times, foreigners were not given any such rights and slaves were considered movable property

 According to New York law, a prisoner of birth is considered to be a type of opinion

 began to develop into a legal personality
 prasiddh lekhak bracton ke samay samuhik vyaktitv yaa sansadeey sanvidhi, shahi ghoshnaptr athwa adhikaar bhoga dwaara sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Institutions of English law have been classified into Sanghat Sansthan and Unit Sansthan
 sanghaat santhaan sahjivi vyaktiyon dwaara nirmit sanstha he or ekak santhaan, uttaradhikari vyaktiyon kaa sanyojit kram he
 An example of the first type of institution is the Giant Stock Company and the second type of Parson
 ekak santhaan kii apeksha sanghaat santhaan ko adhik adhikaar pradaan kiye gaye hai
 The concept of a single institution could not find a place in continental law although it recognized the other two types of institutions which are not valid by Anglo Saxon law
 bharat ke vyapaarik sansthaanon ke, jinamein sahakaari samitiyon ko chhodkar bankig, beemaa or vittiya santhaan sammilit hai, sangyojan, niaman or samaapan kii shaktiyaan sansad main nihit hai
 Similarly, the establishment of other institutions whose scope is spread across more than one state is done by the Parliament itself
 uparyukt sansthaanon ke atirikt sansthaanon ke atirikt anya santhaan rajyon dwaara bhi sthapit kiye ja sakate hai
 Institutions can also be established by ordinances of the President and the Governor
 vidhik vyaktitv kii prakruti ko spasht karne ke liye kai darshanik siddhant prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 Sevigny and Samand formulated the theory of imagination
 unka kahana tha ki maanav ke atirikt anya vastuon main vyaktitv kii upasthiti kalpana maatr he
 There is a reality of existence in a group but in philosophical terms it does not have a real personality
 is prakaar keval kalpana swaroop hi rajya, santhaan, sansthaayen, pratimaaen ityadi adhikarbhokta bane
 Concession theory is a different form of imagination theory and many proponents of imagination theory have also supported it
 isaki yah manyata he ki vidhik vyaktitv kaa udai vidhi ke madhyam se hi hota he
 Therefore, the institution gets legal personality only through the law of the state, not independently
 koshthak siddhant ke anusaar santhaan ke sadsy adhikaar or kartavya ke bhokta he, kintu suvidha ke liye santhaan ke sandarbh main ye adhikaar kartavya samajhe jate hai
 Thus the institute of all duties of all members is placed in "brackets"
 kintu vastusthiti ke thik bodh ke liye yah aavashyak he ki is koshthak ko hataaya jaae
 This doctrine empowers the courts to see the real interests by removing the veil of the group, by denying the shareholders and the credibility of the company
 swek pha morgan ke siddhant ke anusaar bhi keval maanav hi vyaktitv rakhte hai
 Baker and Bridge also supported this theory
 yah siddhant ek prakaar se riyasat or kalpana siddhanton kii sthiti ko hi pratipaadit karata he
 This theory holds that personality is not given to the members of a group, but it achieves some purpose and function
 yathartwaadee athwa angik siddhant anya sab siddhanton se vicharottejak he
 It was promoted by Gierke
 mereland iskaa samarthak tha
 This theory emphasizes that collective personality is as real as normal beings
 samuhik vyaktitv na to kalpana he or na hi yah rajyapradat riyaayat
 It also denies that the members of the institute are bearers of authority
 santhaan swayan main vaastavik vyakti he
 It does not originate from the excess of individual contracts, but from the collective unitary efforts aimed at the creation of a legal personality
 yah samuhik prayaas vaiyaktik ichhashaktiyon ko sanghaat swaroop pradaan karata he jisase samuhik vyakti kaa udai hota he
 It has the ability to work and the personal will
 is sari prakriya kaa vishleshan karte samay, lagata he giyarken ruso kii vaiyaktik ichhashakti or saamaanya ichhashakti ke sambandhon se prabhavit hua he
 Gierkne, giving the simile of the group to the body, recognizes that the group also has real brain, real will and real power of state
 nio contium kelson ne vishuddh vidhi vigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par samuhik vyaktitv kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 Kelsen considers no difference between natural and legal personalities
 uske anusaar vidhik drushti se vyaktitv samanvayakon kaa maanvikaran he
 This is the focal point of unification of certain authority duty packages
 in siddhanton se yah spasht he ki ye vidhik vyaktitv kii keval darshanik vyakhya athwa samuhik vyaktitv kaa raajnneetik vivechan maatr hai
 This is the reason why these principles are unable to properly explain the exchange between hostile, head and subsidiaries of an individual company institution
 raajnneetik drushti se kalpana siddhant abodh or vyaktivaadee he
 It considers the person to be a real personality
 professor wolf kii yah manyata he ki yah siddhant swatantra samiti ke siddhant ke vipareet he
 The princely principle gives the state full power to grant or snatch individuality to committees
 yadi is siddhaat kaa yah arth liya gaya ki samast samuhik jivan rajyapradutt riyasat kaa parinaam he to vah vastusthiti se bhinn baat hogi
 The group has always lived
 bharat main sanyukt parivaar, rome kii parivaar paddati, dharmik or aarthik sanghathan ityadi is baat ke paryaapt pramaan hai
 The realist theory asserts the correctness of the existence of the group and calls for a policy acceptance of the freedom of the group and its rights
 sansthaanon ko vaastavik vyakti maananaa vidhi ke liye upyukt he kintu yah kahana galat hoga ki kisi samooh ke banate hi use vyaktitv mil jaataa he, kyonki vidhi kisi bhi samooh kii vikasshil sthitiyon ko nahin aankh saktaa
 It is reasonable for him to insist that the group fulfill certain formalities to achieve its personality
 giyarken ke vichaar hegal se bahut milte hai
 He states that the state is the supreme institution with the real will and mind and therefore it should control other groups and institutions
 yathartwaadee siddhant un samitiyon ke vidhik vyaktitv ko bhi sweekaar karata he jinhen vidhik manyata bhi na mili ho, yatha roman dach vidhi jisane companyj act ke lagu hone ke purv hi building sosayadi ko manyata de di
 But to say that legal personality is real is not a sociological fact
 freedomen ne uchit hi kaha he ki maanav vyaktitv vyaktivaadita or atmachetana kii anubhuti hoti he or usamen ek anubhav hota he kintu samuhik chetana or samooh ke anubhav centre kii shodh ke sabhi prayaas asafal hue hai
 Professor Peyton says that any one theory can lead to wrong results if not used wisely
 isaliye in siddhanton ko prayukt karte samay yah dhyaan main rakhaa jaae ki ye usee uddeshy ke liye prayukt hon jiske liye inhen pratipaadit kiya gaya
 In other sense, they should not be used to support any political philosophy
 vyavhaar main nyaayalayon ne kisi bhi siddhant kaa anukaran nahin kiya yadhyapi prarambh main santhaan kadachit kalpana siddhant ke kaaran aparaadh se bachate rahe
 Now he is also responsible for that area
 karmchaariyon ke aparaadhon ke liye bhi inhen uttaradaayi tehraaya jaataa he
 The idea that institutions are responsible for the actions of the same people who work and think for them has not been decided yet
 yah anishchit sthiti company ko uske hissedaaron ke samroop samajhane kii nyaayalayon kii niti kii he
 The Supreme Court of India rejected the issue of the shareholders being treated as identical to the company in one case when a stakeholder complained of violation of the fundamental rights of the company

 : 52: 55 ] Demography is a statistical study of the human population

 Demographic analysis can be applied to whole societies or to groups divided by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity
 shikshan kshetra main, janasankhyikee ko aksar samajashaastra, arthshaastra athwa maanav-vigyaan kii ek shakha ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The goal of the study of formal demographics is limited to the measurement of population processes, while social demography analyzes the relationship between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes affecting a population, a more broad field of population studies
 janankiki shabd ko aksar galati se janasankhyikee ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, lekin yah kisi khaas jan samudaay kii visheshtaon ko nirdisht karata he, jiskaa prayog sarkari, vipanan yaa abhimath anusandhan main yaa aise anusandhanon main istemaal janasankhyikeey profil main hota he
 There are two methods of data collection: direct and indirect
 Direct data comes from important registered data that recovers all births and deaths, as well as some specific changes in legal status, such as marriage, divorce, and migration
 In developed countries with better registration systems, registration statistics are the best way to estimate the number of births and deaths
 janasankhyikeey aankade ekatrit karne kii ek anya pratyaksh aam vidhi he janaganana
 ek janaganana aam taur par rashtriya sarkaar dwaara yojit kii jaati he or desh ke har vyakti ko ginaney kaa prayaas karti he
 However, unlike critical statistics data, which are usually collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, the census typically occurs only every 10 years and thus generally for birth and death statistics Are not the best source
 vishleshanon ko ek janaganana ke baad yah anumaan lagane ke liye yojit kiya jaataa he ki adhik gananaa yaa alp gananaa kitni hui he
 Apart from just counting people in the census, a lot happens
 ve aam taur par pariwaron yaa gharon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karne ke saath-saath, vyaktigat visheshtaon jaise umr, ling, vaivaahik sthiti, sakshartaa / shiksha, rojgaar sthiti or vyavsaay or bhugolic avasthiti se sambandhit jaankaree ikattha karte hai
 They can also collect statistics on migration, language, religion, nationality and citizenship
 un deshon main, jahaan mahatvapurn panjikaran pranali adhuri ho, janaganana kaa istemaal, mrityu dar or prajnan kshamta ke bare main jaankaree ke pratyaksh strot ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye janavaadee china ganraajya kii janaganana, aise janmon or mrityu kii jaankaree ekatra karti he, jo janaganana ke thik pehle 18 maheene main ghatit hui ho
 Indirect methods of data collection are needed in countries where complete data is not available, as in the case of most developing countries
 One of these techniques is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters died or how many children they had and how old they were
 in surveykshanon ke saath, shodhakarta tab paroksh rup se sampurna jansankhya ke liye janm yaa mrityu dar kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 Other indirect methods include asking people about siblings, parents and children
 jansankhya prakriyaaon ko gadhane ke liye kai prakaar ke janasankhyikeey tareeke maujuud hai
 They include the model of death toll, fertility, marriage, disability, population estimates and population dynamics
 janasankhyikee kii mahatvapurn avadharanaon main shaamil he: The size of a permanent population does not necessarily remain fixed, it keeps increasing and decreasing
