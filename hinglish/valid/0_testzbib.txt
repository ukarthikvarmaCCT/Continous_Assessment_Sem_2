 Legal equality means equality before the law and equal protection of the law for all
 avadharana yah he ki sabhi manushya janm se samaan hote hai, isliye kanoon ke saamne samaan haisiyat ke paatr hai
 The law is blind and therefore no one will deal with the person he is dealing with
 vah budhimaan ho yaa murkh, tejasvi ko yaa budhu, nata ho yaa kaddavar, garib ho yaa amir, uske saath kanoon vaisaa hi vyavhaar karegaa jaisaa auron ke saath karegaa
 But there are also remedies
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi balak yaa balika ke saath kisi vayask purush yaa stri jaisaa vyavhaar nahin kiya jayega or balak yaa balika ke saath murauvat kiya jayega

 ' yah drashtavy he ki kalidas ke samay main bhi aaj hi kii tarah bharat ke is pradesh ke akhrot prasiddh the
 According to historian Kalhan, the King Naresh Lalitaditya had won the Kamboj along with many other countries of Uttarapath
 uske varnan main bhi kamboj kii parampara se prasiddh ghodon kaa ullekh 
 This description also proves that the name of the country of Kambhoj was prevalent till the medieval period of Indian history and its boundaries were also generally the same, but it seems that after the gradual merger of this district into the state of Kashmir
 After this, its separate power came to an end and along with it its name also fell into the trough of oblivion
 phir bhi abhi tak kamboj ke naam kii smriti kafiristaan ke nikatavarti pradesh ke kuch kabeelon ke naamon, jaise kamboji, chamoj or kamozey aadi main surakshit he
 Tibet has been designated in the Nepali tradition under the name of Kamboj country, but from the above facts it is well proved that the position of this district must have been close to the northern western border of ancient India

 Any surgical option requires pre-treatment with the help of non-specified and irreversible alpha adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine
 Doing so helps to advance the surgery and on the other hand reduces the possibility of severe intraoperative hypertension
 Some authorities suggest that a combined alpha / beta blocker such as labetalol should also be given to slow down the heart rate
 lekin feochromocytoma kii upasthiti main "shuddh" beta bloker jaise atinolol kaa istemaal haragij nahin karnaa chahie kyonki is tarah ke upachaar se nirvirodh alpha agonism or uske baad gambhir or sambhawatah durdamy ucch raktchaap hone kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa he

 a turbine is a rotating engine that rotates itself by consuming the kinetic or / and potential energy of a liquid and rotating other devices on its shaft
 pawan chakki or jal chakki aadi terbine ke praarambhik rup hai
 Turbines are of great importance in the production of electric power
 gas, bhaap or jal se jalanevaale tarabine ek duusare se bhinn hote hai
 a gas compressor or pump is also similar to a turbine but it works opposite the turbine
 tarabine main kam se kam ek roter asembli hoti he jo iskaa gatiman poorja ek yaa ek se adhik bladon ke saath shaft yaa drum ke saath is mashin ko chalaata he
 The fluid or other material exerts pressure on the blade causing the rotor or rotational to move
 yah chaal or roter ghurni ko gatij urja pradaan karti he
 Gas, steam, and water turbines typically have a cover around the blade that controls the amount of fluid
 shabd "tarabine" 1822 main french khanan ejeeniyar cloud berdin ne latin terbo shabd se gadha tha
 He mentioned it in a memoir that was presented to the Royal Science Academy Paris
 cloud berdin ke ek purv chaatr benoit forneron ne pehali vyaavhaarik jal tarabine kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The invention of the steam turbine is attributed to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons, for the invention of the reaction turbine, and to the Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval, for the invention of the impulse turbine
 Modern steam turbines often use reaction and impulse in a single unit
 is
 aam taur par pratikriya or aaveg kii degree isaki paridhi blade kii jad main alag-alag hoti he Now, if we talk about the working of turbine, it works on the basis of Newton's third law of motion
 yani prayek kriya par, vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This is how the propeller of the turbine works
 propeller main laga spindal hawa yaa pani par dabaav banaata he
 This pressure causes the propeller to push the turbine backwards, causing it to move
 aamtaur par tarabine ko ek jagah rakh diya jaataa he, taaki jab bhi pani usase hokar gujarey to tarabine ke har blade par padane vaale dabaav se vah chal pade
 hawa yaa pani ke tarabine ke saath ek hi niyam lagu hota he
 The higher the water or air flow, the faster the turbine will run
 kaaryakari drav main dabaav urja or gatij urja shaamil hai
 Fluid can be compressed or uncompressed
 kai bhautik siddhanton ke aropan dwaara terbinon ko is urja ko ikattha karne ke liye niojit kiya jaataa he
 In impulse turbines the flow of high velocity liquid or gas jets is used to change the direction of the rotor blades
 parinamswaroop aaveg tarabine gumti he or gas yaa drav dhimi gati se baahar nikal jaataa he
 Various definitions of this term are given
 vistrut paribhaasha ke anusaar gas tarabine vah mul chaalak he jiske sampurna ushmiya chakra main kaaryakari taral gasiy avasthaa main hi bana rahata he evam jiske sabhi yantrangon kii gati paribhrami hoti he
 According to the narrow definition, the term is used only for the main turbine organ whose medium is hot air
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar gas tarabine vah yantra he jisamen pravaah prakram avirat rahata he evam shakti tarabine dwaara praapt hoti he
 Those are the basic driving devices that convert the potential energy contained in water into mechanical work

 Inspired by the requirements and circumstances from time to time, people made many improvements in them, so water turbine is also an evolved form of watermill
 pichhali ardhshatabdi se to inkaa itnaa upyog bad gaya he ki inke dwaara lagbhag sabhi sabhy deshon main jagah jagah, chote bade anek jal-vidyutakti-grih banaae jane lage
 Due to this, electricity started to be received at a very cheap price even in remote waterless villages and the development of various types of industrial businesses was encouraged
 bhaap tarabine ek mulchaalak he, jisamen bhaap kii ushma-urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kar, ucch gatisheel bhaap ko ek ghurnak par bandhe hue bahut se falkon par takaraayaa jaataa he, jisase falak paribhraman karte hai evam isse kaary hota he
 In a reciprocating steam engine, the piston is acted upon by the static pressure of the steam
 yadhyapi ingine main bhaap piston ke saath chalati he, phir bhi ingine kii kriya main bhaap kii gatij urja kaa prabhaav naganay he
 Steam turbines can have higher speeds than steam engines and the speed can be larger
 tarabine ke purjon kaa santulan acha rahata he
 The same amount of steam and the same state of steam turbine can produce more power than a steam engine
 bhaap ingine se kuch varsh kaam lene ke baad bhaap kii khapat bad jaati he, parantu tarabine main aisi avasthaa nahin aati prithvi par ke sabhi mul chaalkon main bhaap tarabine sabase adhik tikaoo hota he
 The biggest advantage of a turbine is that it provides the rotor speed directly, while the steam engine has to handle separate materials to achieve rotational speed
 vaashpitra main bhaap kaa janan ucch daab evam adhitaap par hota he
 When this steam approaches the turbine, it has a high amount of heat energy and its pressure is so high that it can circulate to low pressure
 parantu us samay isaki gatij urja naganya hoti he
 Therefore, before steam can do some work, its heat energy is converted into kinetic energy
 yah parivartan, acchhee tarah abhikalpit upkaran main, bhaap ko vistaarit karne se hota he
 The diffusion of steam is accomplished either in a single action, or in different actions
 iskaa arth yah hota he ki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit karne ke liye bahut se sthir upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai or praaia: do sthir upkarnon ke bich ek gatiman upkaran laga rahata he
 The kinetic energy received in the stationary device is then applied to work on the bonded moving device

 The World Service's famous signature tune Lillibulero was first broadcast near the top of the completion of several hours, followed by Greenwich time signals and hourly news
 ab, vibhinn kism kii awaajon ke jariye soochna di jaati he, "dis ij da bibisi in 

" or iske baad vibhinn shaharon ke naam liye jate hai
 Until recently, the hourly sequence began with the announcement "this is London" - but now it is more prominently, "wherever You Are, You're with BBC" or "with World News Every Half Hour, This Is BBC "
 Except in Britain, these announcements no longer refer to the BBC World Service, but only to "the BBC"
 Recently, Lilibulero has only been used topically and a smaller version is used whenever it is run
 yah suzav diya gaya he ki lilibulero ke upyog main kami sabase pehle is kaaran he ki isaki prishthbhumi uttari ireland main protestant marchig geet ke rup main he

 saanchaa:xmchannels saanchaa:siriuschannels saanchaa:public Radio International Template: Radio stations in Singapore aatithy ek mehmaan tathaa mejabaan ke madhya sambandh athwa satkarshiltaa kaa krity athwa prachlan he
 That is, guests, visitors or strangers; There are shelters, membership clubs, conventions, attractions, special events reception and entertainment and other services for travelers and tourists
 "aatithy" kaa aashay un logon ke prati dekhbhaal tathaa dayalutaa pradaan karnaa bhi ho saktaa he jinako isaki aavashyaktaa he
 The English word hospitality, meaning hospitality, originates from the Latin word hospes; And hospes originated from hostis, which means power
 Literally "host" means "lord of strangers", hostire means equal or recompense
 homeric kaal main aatithy unani devkul ke mukhya devtaa jiyas ke aadhin tha
 Zeus has also been conferred the title of 'genius Zaus' which emphasizes the fact that hospitality was the most important
 ek unani ghar ke baahar sejrane vaale kisi ajanabi ko parivaar dwaara ghar ke andar aamantrit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The host could ask the stranger's name only after washing his feet, offering food and wine, and after the guest was comfortable
 pavitra aatithy kii unani dharna kii vyakhya telemacas tathaa nestor kii kahani main kii gai he
 When Telemachus arrives to meet Nestor, Nestor is unaware that his guest is the son of his old friend Odysseus
 lekin phir bhi nestor ne telemacas tathaa uski party kaa muktahast se swaagat kiya, is prakaar hostis "ajanabi" tathaa hostire "samatuly yaa baraabar" ke madhya sambandh kaa pradarshan kiya ki kis tarah aatithy kii dharna main ye do milte hai
 Later, one of Nestor's sons slept on a bed close to Telemachus, taking care that he had no trouble
 nestor ne ek buggi tathaa ghode bhi telemacas ke liye chode jisase vah payalas se sparta tak thal maarg se yatra kar saken tathaa apane putr pisistratas ko sarathi ke rup main niyukt kiya
 It explains rescue and guidance, two other components of ancient Greek hospitality
 uparokt kahani tathaa uske vartmaan arth ke aadhaar par aatithy kaa taatpary ajanabi ko mejabaan ke baraabar / samatuly rakhana, uski dekhbhaal karnaa tathaa use surakshit mahasoos karana hota he, tathaa uski mejabani ke ant main use agle padaav kaa maargdarshan pradaan karnaa hota he
 Hospitality in the contemporary West is rarely a matter of rescue and survival, and is mostly related to etiquette and entertainment
 haalanki isamen aaj bhi apane atithi ke liye aadar pradarshit karnaa, unki aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa tathaa unako baraabar kaa maananaa shaamil he
 The display of hospitality to strangers varies from cultures and subcultures compared to individual friends and members of one's group
 aatithy seva udyog main hotel, kisino evam ashrayasthal shaamil hai jo ajanabiyon ko aaraam tathaa nirdesh pradaan karte hai, lekin keval vyapaar sambandhon ke bhaag ke rup main
 hospital, hospice evam hostel shabd bhi "hospitality" se liye gayi hai tathaa ye santhaan vyaktigat dekhbhaal kii ore adhik ishaara karte hai
 Hospitality behavior is a subject that studies the use of hospitality
 pashchimi sandarbh main, athens tathaa jerusalem ke madhya gatisheel tanaav ke saath do avasthaaon main adhik pragatisheel sankraman ke saath antar dekha ja saktaa he: ek vyaktigat kartavya bodh mahasoos karne ke aadhaar par aatithy tathaa ek sangathit parantu agyaat saamaajik sevaaon ke liye sarkari sansthaanon par aadhaarit hota he: jinamein garib, anaath, biimaar, videshi, apradhi aadi vishesh prakaar ke ajanabiyon hetu vishesh sthaan he
 Perhaps, this progressive institutionalization can be aligned with the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period
 "I am going to get you a pillow and make you feel real good" can be an example of hospitality
 yah atithi ke aatithy ko darshata he
 In Middle Eastern culture, caring for strangers and foreigners living among you was considered a cultural norm
 ye mandand bible sambandhi kai aagyaaen tathaa udaahranon main pratibimbit kiye gayi hai
 Perhaps the most extreme example is given in Genesis
 ishwar, farishton ke samooh ko aatithy pradaan karata he ; jab bheed unka balaatkaar karne kaa prayaas karti he to ve is had tak chale jate hai ki ve farishton ke sthaan par apni putriyon ko prastut kar dete hai
 Saying, "do nothing with these people, because they have come to my shelter
" " There are strict obligations for both host and guest
 yah bandhan ek chat ke neeche namak khaakar sthapit kiya jaataa he, tathaa itnaa kathor hota he ki ek arabi kahani bataati he ki ek chor ne ek vastu kaa swaad yah soch kar chakhaa ki vah chini he tathaa, yah jaanakar ki vah namak he, usne wo sabhi chijen vahaan waapas rakh deen jo usne uthaai thim tathaa chalaa gaya
 For the ancient Greeks and Romans, hospitality was a divine condition
 mejabaan se atithiyon kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karnaa sunishchit karne kii apeksha kii jaati thi
 The ancient Greek word xenia, or Theozinia, refers to the ritualistic guest-friendship relationship when the deity is included
 pracheen vishwa main aatithy ke mahatv kaa ek udhaaharan bousis tathaa philmone kii kahani he
 In this story, the ancient gods Zeus and Harmis go to the town of Phrygia disguised as an ordinary farmer
 khaane tathaa raat main rukne kii khoj main unhone kai band daravaaje dekhe, jab tak ki ve philmone tathaa bousis ke ghar main nahin aaye
 yadhyapi vah garib the, parantu dampatti ne achche mejabaan kii tarah vyavhaar karte hue, atithi ko unke paas jo kuch thodaa bahut tha vah diya, tathaa jab vah yah samaj pate hai ki unke atithi vastav main bhesh badal kar aaye devtaa he, ve apane ghar kii raksha karne vaale ek kalahans ko bali karne kaa prastaav karte hai
 In addition to saving the couple in place of the remaining non-hospitable urban people from the city floods, the gods promise to fulfill one of their wishes as a reward
 keltic socytiyon ne bhi aatithy kii dharna kaa sammaan kiya he, visheshkar bachaav ke sambandh main
 ek mejabaan, jisane ek vyakti ko sharan dene kii sweekruti di he, usase apane atithi ko keval bhojan tathaa aashray dene kii hi apeksha nahin kii jaati parantu use yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hota he ki unki dekhbhaal ke adheen mehmaan ko koi haani na ho
 a real-life example of this is originally in the history of the early 17th century Scottish clan macgregor
 clen lemant kaa mukhiya glenstra main mike grager mukhiya ke ghar main aayaa tathaa usne use bataaya ki vah shatruon se bachataa gum rahaa he tathaa sharan dene kii prarthana kii
 mike grager ne apane mukhiya bhai kaa swaagat kiya tathaa koi prashn nahin kiya
 Later that night, members of macgregor Klein came to see the head of the Lamont, and they informed the chief that Lemont had in fact killed his son and heir in a quarrel
 aatithy ke dharmik niyam ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, mike grager ne lemont ko na keval unke gotra ke vyaktiyon ko saunpane se manaa kiya balki agali subah use uski purvajon kii jameen tak choda
 is krity kii baad main pratipurti hui jab mek gregors bhagode ghoshit kiye gayi, lemont ne unke kai logon ko surakshit sthaan diya
 India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, and each culture has its own favorite stories, some of which are also on hospitality
 jaise ki koi anaadi apana chota sa tukdaa bin bulaae mehmaan ke saath baantta he, is khoj main ki mehmaan bhesh badal kar aaye devtaa ho sakate hai, jo uski udaartaa kaa prachur maatra main puraskaar denge
 jaise ki ek stri, jitna sambhav ho, prempurvak utani khichdi pakaati he, un sabhi ke liye jo bhukhe he, us din tak jab vah khaane kaa apana hissaa bhi aakhri bhukhe vyakti ko de detii he, tathaa bhesh badal kar aaye hue devtaa use kabhi na samaapt hone vaala khichdi kaa bartan puraskaar main dete hai
 Most adult Indians grew up listening to such stories from their childhood
 ve "atithi devo bhav" ke darshan shaastra main vishwaas rakhte hai, jiskaa arth he "atithi bhagwaan hota he"
 is mul mantra se ghar main aaye atithiyon ke sambandh main dayalutaa kaa bhartiya drushtikon tathaa anya sabhi saamaajik paristhitiyaan pramanit hoti hai
 India does not mean modern India, India and Pakistan were the same country before partition in 1947
 isaliye jab bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat kii jaati he, iskaa aashya bharat tathaa pakistan donon ke sambandh main he
 Hospitality as a cultural value or value is an established sociological situation about which people study and write
 ek vishesh prakaar ke aatithy kaa pradarshan karte huye kuch kshetra ek hi parampara main dhal gayi hai
 for example: "aatithy aachaar shaastra" shabd kaa prayog do bhinn, parantu sambandhit, adhyayan kshetron ke liye kiya jaataa he: Ethics goes beyond "what has been done" to tell what should be done; Hospitality Ethics explains "what should be done" in matters related to hospitality
 aatithy siddhant evam maanak vibhinn samskritiyon evam paramparaon main; evam puure itihaas main aatithy prachalanon, prakriyaaon evam sambandhon ke jatil vishleshan se liye gayi hai
 Finally, hospitality principles have been applied to commercial and non-commercial arrangements
 achaaran ke ek maanak ke rup main, sampurna itihaas main aatithy ko ek kanoon, ek aachaar shaastra, ek siddhant, ek code, ek karttavya, ek gun ityadi ke rup main mana gaya he
 These advisories were created to deal with uncertain relationships between guests, hosts, citizens and the unfamiliar
 apane pracheen udbhav evam maanav samskritiyon main sarvavyaapaktaa ke baavjood, aatithy ke siddhant par naitik darshanikon ne tulanaatmak rup se kam dhyaan diya he, tathaa unhone apana dhyaan anya naitik siddhanton yatha - acha, bura, sahi evam galat aadi par kendrit kiya
 Until now, hospitality as a moral order, or classical approach to ethics, has outstripped many other consultations for classical behavior: Ethics was a code of hospitality in ancient Middle Eastern, Greek, and Roman cultures that entailed a certain kind of interaction with guests and hosts
 Used to demand conduct
 ek udhaahranh shoorveerta main stesan ke vyaktiyon dwaara anya vyaktiyon ke maange jane par bhojan evam awaas pradaan karnaa aavashyak he
 In many forms, these standards of behavior have existed up to the present day in the commercial hospitality industry, where descendants of ancient ideas continue to inform current standards and practices
 vanijyik aatithy vyavasthaaon main aachaar shaastra
 anuprayukt aachaar shaastra, aachaar shaastra kii vah shakha he jo hamaare aachaar shastreey siddhanton evam nirnyon kii padtaal karti he
 There are many branches of applied ethics: business ethics, professional ethics, medical ethics, academic ethics, environmental ethics and others
 aatithy aachaar shaastra anuprayukt aachaar shaastra kii ek shakha he
 In practice, it combines relationships with other branches of applied ethics, such as business ethics, environmental ethics, business ethics, and others
 For example, when a local hospitality industry progresses, possible ethical dilemmas abound: what are the effects of industry practices on the environment? What is the impact on the host community? What is the impact on the local economy? Local Community; What is the effect on the attitude of citizens regarding outsiders, tourists and guests? These are some of the questions that hospitality ethics can ask as a version of applied ethics
 chunki aatithy evam paryaton sammilit rup se vishwa main sabase bade seva udyogon kaa srijan karata he, atah aatithy evam paryaton se jude vyaktiyon ke liye achche or bure vyavhaar tathaa sahi or galat kaaryon kii bahut sambhaavnaayen hai
 The ethics in these industries is guided by codes of conduct, employee manuals, industry standards and many more
 yadhyapi vishwa paryaton sanghathan ne aachaar shaastra ke udyog anusaar code prastaavit kiye hai, aatithy udyog ke liye vartmaan main koi vaishvik samhita nahin he
 Various text books related to ethics in commercial hospitality systems have been published recently and are currently being used in hospitality education courses

 yah saakshaatkaar fakir kii aatmakatha kaa ansh bana
 He was born on 18 November 1886 in village Panjhal, District Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India
 unki prishthbhumi main unka garib brahman parivaar or ek dabaa hua bachapan tha or ve ishwar bhakthi main raahat pate the
 After being a non-vegetarian for some time, his repentance and prayer led him through a divine scene through the donor Dayal Shiva Brat Lal to Radha Swami Mat
 unhone fakir ko radhaswami mat main dikshit kiya or 'saar-vachan' naamak pustak padhane ke liye di jo radhaswami mat ke sansthaapak shiv dayaal singh kii likhi hui thi
 Fakir found that the book was contrary to his Hindu beliefs and interest
 usamen kai dharmik andolanon ke bare kiye gaye ullekh fakir ke tatsambandhi vichaaron se mail nahin khate the
 However, due to his strong faith in Data Dayal Ji, he vowed that he would become truthful and follow the path shown by his Guru and tell his experience to the world
 He started the work of satsang to his followers after the demise of Data Dayal Ji and then told his felt truth to people that the scenes, forms, colors and lines appearing in the believer seeker are actually Maya, not truth
 The Fakir also stopped giving 'naam-daan' in the traditional way
 fakir kaa kahana tha ki satsang main aantarik anubhav gyaan kii ucchtar avasthaaon kaa unke dwaara kiya gaya varnan hi naam daan he
 He fulfilled all the duties of a Guru without becoming a Guru
 sankat or vipadaa kii sthiti main unke anuyaayiyon main fakir ke chamatkaari or divine rup kaa prakat hona sahitya main miltaa he
 But the fakir publicly separated all such miracles from himself, saying that what happened was due to the faith of the people and not because of the fakir
 He declared all such followers as his satguru, because the experience of those who considered him a guru forced the fakir to go beyond the experiences of mind, soul and word
 isise antat: unhone param shanti pai or unki satya kii khoj tathaa kured samaapt hui
 In view of the declining health of the Fakir, in 1980, at the request of Dr
 David Christopher Lane, the Fakir gave Professor B
R
 Kamal had written his autobiography
 multah urdu bhashaa main likhaai gai is pustak kaa angreji anuwaad professor camel ne kiya or baad main dow len ne iske sampadan or prakaashan kaa kaary kiya
 Fakir died on September 11, 1981 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, North America, during a visit to the United States
 apni vasiyat ke jariye fakir ne maanavtaa mandir, hoshiyarpur ke astitv ko alag sthapit kya or ise anya maanavtaa kendron se swatantra rakhaa
 He also made it clear that his trust has nothing to do with the open humanity centers in his name in India and abroad and love for his masters
 unhone apane sambandhiyon ko mandir kii seva karne kii anumati to di parantu trust kaa sadsy banane yaa mandir ke maamalon main dakhal dene par roak laga di
 His will includes his mission 'be a Man'
 unhone bhagat munshiram ko namdaan dene, jeevon ko hidaayat karne or dukhi or ashaant jeevon kii madad karne ke liye niyukt kiya
 In the presence or absence of Bhagat Munshiram, he gave dr

 According to his will, no fees will be charged from the children studying in the school run by the Manavata Mandir, but the fakir made it mandatory for the parents of the children to promise that they would not produce more than three children
 maanavtaa mandir ke praangan main fakir kii asthiyaan gaadi gai hai jin par 'manushya bano' kaa jhanda fahraaya gaya he
 He had also made it clear that there is no place of tomb, mausoleum, mausoleum or the worship of dead men in his purity
 at: unhone apane aap ko 'shiv samaadh' se asambaddha rakhaa
 Fakir had many sources of religious ideas such as his long association with Hinduism and Radhaswami faith and his experience in the word Surat
 The Fakir found much to agree with in his humanitarian view but disagreed with his traditional method of nomination and the prevailing Guruism in India
 aisi dharmik prathaon ke prati unki sahansheeltaa shunya thi jinase garib, vishwasi or bhole-bhaale logon kaa shoshan hota ho
 His literature testifies to the fact that he was a strong supporter of the basic principles of santmism practiced by Kabir but he was disillusioned with the end result of the highest stages of the word surat yoga and mysticism nurtured by saints
 baad main unhone yoga-sadhana ko die ja rahe mahatv ko kam kiya or sant mat ke maanavtawaad par bal diya
 
fakir had faith in the idea that 'sex is only for the progeny origin'
 isse maanav jati ke ksht kam ho sakate hai
 According to his philosophy of life, wishing for others and his welfare is an important part of the optimistic view of life
 yuvaaon ko aantarik shanti ke liye unhone sadaa vyast rahane, apni aajeevika swayan kamaane, kisi sachche insaan ke maargdarshan main rahane or aatm-sanyamee banane kii salaah di
 As part of his social duty, he asked his followers not to cause trouble to others, to avoid talking unnecessarily, to be tolerant of bitter words and to serve fellow beings selflessly
 Stressed
 shubh karm, shuddh kamai, daan aadi jivan ke aise paksh the jo unhone anya saamaajik daayitv main shaamil kiye
 These obligations are considered essential for human beings
 anya aadhyatmik saadhnaaon ke antargat unhone unhone prem, bhakthi, vishwaas, samarpan par jor diya
 In many places he spoke of 'being true to oneself', surrendering to the will of God, meditating and thus attaining enlightenment in the end
 fakir ne anubhav kiya ki sabhi jeev param chetan tatva ke bulbule hai or maanav kaa antim lakshya shanti he
 In 1933, Daya Dayal ordered the fakir to change the teaching of saintly religion according to the future
 In order to follow the Guru's orders and carry forward the work of the donor Dayal in accordance with the changed times, the Fakir established the Manavata Mandir at Hoshiarpur in 1962
 ek masik patrika 'maanav mandir' kaa prakaashan shuru kiya gaya
 This temple is dedicated to humanity and human religion
 
 The Humanity Temple continued to be the center of his mission where he continued to tell people the truth of miracles and the truth ahead of the mind
 fakir ne mandir chalaane ke liye aavashyak daan or bhenton kii keemat par bhi apana yah dharm nibhaayaa

 unki adhiktar pustaken unke satsangon ke sidhe sankalan hai jo mukhyat: do patrikaon namat: 'manushya bano' or 'maanav mandir' main chhapi thim
 Some of his Hindi and English books are as follows: jivan kaal main baba fakir chand ke liye kai sammaan suchak shabd prayog kiye jate the, yatha dayaal fakir, param dayaal ji maharaj, sant satguru param dayaal ji maharaj, baba fakir, fakir chand ji maharaj, sant satguru vaqt fakir chand ji maharaj

 The rise time and fall time of these pulses are less and the amplitude is almost fixed
 acha pulse transformar vah he jo aisi palon ko kam se kam parivartan ke saath dwitiyak vinding main de sake
 That is, the rise and fall time of the pulse received in the secondary winding should be reduced and 'droop' should not come in the amplitude

 veda ke brahman granthon main, upanishad, smriti tathaa kai puraanon main rudrashtaadhi tathaa rudrabhishek kii mahima kaa varnan he
 It is written in the air purifier- yashch sagarparyantan sashailavankananam
 Sarvanatnamagunopetam Suvrikshajalshobhitam
 
 Danyat Kanchan Samyukta Bhoomi Chaushadhisamayutam
 tasmadpyadhikan tasya sakrudrudrajpadbhavet
 
 yashch rudranjapennityam dhyymano maheshwaram
 Sa tinaiv ch dehen rudra: sanjayate dhruvam
 
 Meaning: a person who donates such an ocean rich in ocean, forest, mountain, water and trees and with excellent qualities, which is blessed with wealth, gold and medicines, is more virtuous than one-time Rudri chanting and Rudrabhishek
 
 isaliye jo bhagwaan shiv kaa dhyaan karke rudri kaa paath karata he, vah usee deh se nishchit hi rudraroop ho jaataa he, isamen andeh nahin he
 Thus, from the point of view of means worshiping, Sudrashtadhyayi has special significance
 praaia: kuch logon me yah dharna hoti he ki mularoop se veda ke sukt aadi punyadaayak hote hai at: in mantron kaa keval paath or sunanaa maatr hi aavashyak he
 Scholars are often unaware of the meaning of Veda and Veda and its serious elements
 vastav main yah sonch galat he, vidwaan veda or vaan se milakar bana he, to veda ke vidya ko jo jane vahi vidwaan he, iske sandarbh main unako jaankaree hona aavashyak he
 Ancient texts also describe the glory of Vedic elements
 niruktkaar kehete hai ki jo veda padhakar uskaa arth nahin jaanata vah bhaar wahi pashu ke tulya he athwa nirjan van ke sumdhur us rasaal vriksh ke samaan he jo na swayan us amrit ras kaa aswadan karata he or na kisi anya ko hi detaa he
 Therefore, knowledge of Vedantras is transcendental - sthanuryan bharhaar: kilabhuddhity vedan na vijanati yortham
 Yoarthagya et sakalam bhadramushnuate nakameti jnanavidutapappa 
 Therefore, it is impossible even to imagine Shivpujan in the absence of Rudrashtadhyayi
 rudrashtaadhi atyant hi moolyawaan he, na hi isse bina rudrabhishek hi sambhav he or na hi iske bina shiv pujan hi kiya ja saktaa he

 isse vidit hota he ki sabhyataa ke maarg par bade hue sabhi deshon main surveykshan kaa mahatv nirantar badhata rahaa or krishi, rajasav, bhoomi ke adhikaar kii simaaon ke nirdhaaran or yatraaon main margon ke lekhachitr banane main surveykshan kaa abhyaas evam prayog hota rahaa he
 But by the end of the 16th century, the importance of surveying increased hopefully
 marco polo, vasco di gamma, columbus or captain cook ke bhramanon se europe nivaasiyon ko sansar ke vistaar or usapar sthit samrudh desh tathaa upjau bhoomi kaa pataa laga, to ve bahut taadaad main apni bhagyapariksha ke liye nikal pade
 There was competition among them in occupying the land, which gave new vigor and speed to the survey operations
 us samay kaa bana hua bharat or arab kaa maanchitr british ajaayabaghar main aaj bhi surakshit he
 The map suggests that it was built by Ferrando Bertoli in 1565 AD
 iske baad 1612 i
 main gerardra mercator dwaara banaaya bharat kaa maanchitr, us samay kaa athak prayaas, bhi thati ke rup main surakshit he
 In addition to protecting the right, there will be interest in the development of the countries
 sampurna desh, amuk samrajya, sampurna sansar ek saath dekhne kii jigyaasa badi
 The means of its completion could have been a map
 is kaaran surveykshan main itani nai-nai khojein hui ki unke aadhaar par surveykshankriya hi do pramukh virgon main bant gai : Geometric survey and patt surveykshan
 The main basis of this classification is the size of the earth
 jis surveykshan main prithvi ke aakaar ko golabh maanakar, uski sataha par liye gaye naapon kaa prayog karne se pehle prithvi kii vakrata ke liye shodhan karte hai, use bhuganitiya surveykshan kehete hai
 This is a difficult process
 magar prithvi kii gol yaa vakr sataha par naapi dooriyaan yadi adhik lambii na hon, to unhen vakr na maanakar ruju hi maan liya jaae, to koi vishesh truti nahin hogi
 For example, measuring an 11
5 mile long line on the curved surface of the Earth would cause an error of only 0
05 feet due to Earth
 isi prakaar prithvi kii sataha par kinhin bhi teen binduon dwaara 75 varg mile kshetrafal ke tribhuj ko samtal sataha par sidhi rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaae, to uske konon ke yoga or usee tribhuj kii vakr sataha par bane konon ke yoga main keval ek second kaa antar hoga
 For this reason, if maps of small areas are drawn, then displaying the measurements taken on the surface of the earth on the ground in straight lines will not cause a knocking mistake
 isliye prithvi ke chote kshetra ko samtal maanakar, us par lee gai naapon ko bina vakrata ke shodhan ke kisi paimaane par samtal kaagaj par ankit kar diya jaataa he
 This type of survey is called Patta survey
 saamaanya vyavhaar main aanevaale surveykshan samatleey surveykshan hi hote hai
 There is also some difference in the process of survey, equipment, scale etc
 for accomplishing different purposes
 in kaarnon se patt surveykshan ke bhi kai varg ban gaye hai : If maps of such a wide country or continent as India can be compiled with such planar surveys, the importance of board surveys increases over time
 yah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab patt surveykshanon kii aadharshila bhuganitiya surveykshan par ho
 The foundation stone will be eligible only when it is briefly explained
 surveykshan ko bhinn-bhinn aadhaaron ke anusaar adholikhit prakaar se vargeekrut kiya jaataa hai- These principles are very simple
 prithvi kii sataha par badi saralata se do aise bindu chune ja sakate hai jo ek duusare kii sthiti se dekhen ja saken or unke bich kii duuri naapi ja sake
 They can be placed on any desired scale on paper in such a way that the survey of their immediate area can be covered on paper
 iske baad in do binduon se kisi bhi tisare bindu kii duuri naapakar usee paimaane se kaagaj par uski saapeksh sthiti ankit kar sakate hai
 In this way, a map of the entire area can be made by taking the distance from any two points to a third unknown point and marking it sequentially
 duusare shabdon main, surveykshan kii vidhi tribhuj kii rachana he
 Above, only one composition of the triangle is mentioned, in which the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are known
 tribhuj kii anya rachana vidhiyaan bhi surveykshan main prayukt hoti hai
 See the basic principles of the detailed article survey
 thik bhugolic sthiti main bhu akruti ke roopankan ke liye maanchitr ke kshetra ke andar aise pramukh niyantran binduon ke jaal ke pratham aavashyaktaa he jinke greenvich ke saapeksh sahi sahi akshansh or deshaantar athwa ausat samudratal se oonchaai gyaat ho
 The Great Trigonometric Survey has done this in the making of most maps of India
 saar rup main yah chauras bhoomi par invaar dhaatu ke taar yaa feete se saavdhaanee se naapi hui lagbhag 10 mile lambii jameen hoti he jise 'aadhaar' kehete hai
 After the foundation is established, a series of triangles of appropriate arms and angles are carved one after the other
 tribhujon ke konon kaa nirikshan kar bhujaa tathaa binduon ke niamakon kii gananaa kar lee jaati he
 This is called a triangular survey
 tribhujon kaa jaal surveykshan main sarvatra failaa hota he
 The main device is the arc arc theodolite, which has the ability to accurately read vertical and horizontal angles by a fraction of a second or less
 ye bindu kaaphi dur dur hote hai
 Therefore, detailed survey is not possible
 iske liye yah aavashyak he ki mahan trikoshmetiya surveykshan ke bade tribhujon ko todakar chote chote tribhujon kaa jaal banaakar sari jameen ko kuch mile ke antar par sthit binduon kii maala main parinat kar diya jaae
 The projection is made on the desired scale
 prakshep main niyantran bindu ankit kiye jate hai
 From these points, intersection and positioning are carried out with a detailed survey with the help of screenplay and retina
 ise patal chithran kehete hai
 The height is determined by the addition of an instrument called the Indian diaphragm
 oonchaai se nishchit urdhwadhar antaraal par talarekha tak jise samocch rekha kehete hai, khinche ja sakate hai, jo bhoomi kii dharakriti acchhee tarah pradarshit karte hai
 In the last 30 years, the most effective method of entry in the field of survey is the method of aerial photograph
 sainik or asainik upyogita kii drushti se hawaii photography kaa mahatv pratham vishwayuddh kaal main hi anubhav kiya jane laga tha tathaa surveykshan or maanchitr nirmaankarya main iskaa upyog sarvapratham 1916 i
 main england main ordenans survey kii yudhottarkalin yojana main hua
 Since then, astonishing progress has been made in this direction in European countries and North America
 ab to hawaii photography yaa photography dwaara surveykshan ek anuthi vaigyanik pravidhi he
 There are two methods of survey by aerial photograph: graphical and mechanics
 bharat main lekhachitreey vidhi kaa kuch varshon se atyaadhik upyog ho rahaa he or jahaan tak sthalakritiya maanchitr ankan kaa prashn he, yah vidhi lagbhag purnataa praapt kar chuki he
 Its basic principle is that the radiation lines in real vertical aerial photographs, which extend to the ground point in the photograph, form true and constant angles
 akritiyon kaa ucchata visthaapan maanchitr ke samtal main drushti bindu se thik neeche sthit ek bindu se kehete hai or jo vyavhaar main vaastavik urdhwadhar photo kaa centre mana jaataa he) areey hote hai jisase vivaran, maanchitr samtal ke baahar uski uchaai or avlamb bindu se duuri ke thik anupaat main vaastavik maanchitr sthiti se visthapit ho jaataa he
 After obtaining the desired face photo, it is displaced from the actual map position in exactly the same proportion by triangulation
 abhisht shakl photo praapt kar lene ke baad trikonkaran dwaara nishchit ninyatran binduon kii sahaayta or photo ke areey gun kaa upyog kar prakshipt patron par, jinka zikr ho chukaa he, thik bhugolic sthiti main photo ke centre ankit kiye jate hai
 The intersection of various details is determined by using the invariant properties of each photo to determine their correct position
 lekhachitreey vidhi kii sabase badi samasya photo se parishuddh ucchata gyaat karnaa he
 Due to this difficulty, a dense network of complementary high-altitude control is often created in land survey methods
 is maardarshak ucchataaon kii sahaayta se trivimdarshi ke neeche rakhkar photo par samocch rekhaayen khinchakar unhen maanchitr patr par laga diya jaataa he
 The above graphical method does not create an inaccurate map due to the absence of the vertical of the camera at the time of exposure
 yantric sankalan trivim aalekhan upkaran main hota he jisase photo thik usee sthiti main ulatate, jhukate or gum jate hai jisamen udbhasana ke samay vimaan tha
 These devices fix air-conditioning problems while accounting methods present approximate solutions
 bharat main aajkal kaam aanevaale aalekhan upkaran hai : wild autograph 47, wild 48, multiflex or sterotope
 Chandi Devi is considered to be similar to Kali Devi, she is sometimes worshiped in kind and often in fiery form, in kind as she is called Uma, Gauri, Parvati, or Haimavati, Jaganmata and Bhavani
 Durga, Kali and Shyama, known as Chandi or Chandika, Bhairavi etc
 Chandi puja is celebrated in Navaratri from the Shukla Pratipada of Ashwin and Chaitra month
 puja ke liye navaratra sthapana ke din brahman ke dwaara mandir ke madhya sthaan ko gobar or mitti se lip kar mitti ke ek kalash kii sthapana kii jaati he, kalash main pani bhar liya jaataa he or aam ke patton se use aachhadit kar diya jaataa he, kalash ke upar dhakkan mitti kaa jau yaa chaaval se bhar kar rakhte hai, pile vastra se use dhak diya jaataa he, brahman mantron ko uccharan karne ke baad usee kalash main kushon se pani ko chhidkata he or devi kaa aavahan usee kalash main karata he, devi chandika ke aavahan kii manyata dete huye kalash ke chaaron taraf laal rang kaa sindur chhidkata he, mantra aadi ke uccharan ke samay or is nau din kii avadhi main brahman keval fal or mul khaakar hi rahata he, puja kaa ant yajna se hota he, jise home karnaa kaha jaataa he, home main jau, chini, ghi or tilon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, yah home kalash ke saamne hota he, jisame devi kaa nivas samajha jaataa he, brahman navaratra ke samaapt hone ke baad us kalash ke paas bikharaa hua sindur or home kii raakh apane prati shraddha rakhane vaale logon ke ghar par lekar jaataa he or or sabhi ke lalaat par lagaataa he
 In this way, it is believed that everyone is united with Goddess Chamunda, in many countries of India and the world, worship of Goddess is considered in this way
 pracheen hindu or buddha mandiron ko indonesia main chandi kaha jaataa he
 The fact behind this is that many of these Goddesses were established for worship

 drishy kavy shabdon ke atirikt paatro kii veshbhusha, bhavabhangima, akruti, kriya or abhinay dwaara darshakon ke hriday main rasonmesh karaata he
 Cinematography is also called 'metaphor' because it is decorated with the eyes
 shravy kavy shabdon dwaara pathakon or shrotaaon ke hriday main ras kaa sanchaar karata he
 In poetry, poetry, prose and champu poetry are included in the poetry
 gatyarthak main pad dhaatu se nishpan ‘padya’ shabd gati kii pradhanta suchit karata he
 Hence, there is a system of rhythm, rhythm and verses in the poetry
 pun: padyakavy ke do upbhed kiye jate hai—mahakavy or khandakavy
 Khandakavya is also called 'muktakavya'
 khandakavy main mahakavy ke samaan jivan kaa sampoorn itivrutt na hokar kisi ek ansh kaa varnan kiya jaataa he— They are also called 'gitikavya' in Hindi only because of their predominance of musicality along with poetry
 ‘geeti’ kaa arth hriday kii ragaatmak bhaavana ko chandobaddh rup main prakat karnaa he
 The soul of Geeti is Bhavatirek
 apni ragaatmak anubhuti or kalpana ke kavi varnyavastu ko bhavatmak bana detaa he
 In Gitikavya, personal experience is easily expressed by freeing it from poetic traditions and traditions
 swaroopat: geetikavy kaa aakaar-prakaar mahakavy se chota hota he
 With the help of all these elements, Sanskrit muktakavya is considered to be an excellent poem
 muktkavy mahakavyon kii apeksha adhik lokapriy hue hai
 In Sanskrit, Gitikavya is found in both Muktak and Prabandha forms
 prabandhatmak geetikavy kaa sarvotkrisht udhaaharan meghdoot he
 Most of the arrangements are written on the emulation of this song
 muktak vah hajisamen prayek padya apane aap main swatantra hota he
 Beautiful examples of this are Amarukashatak and Bhatruhrishtakatraya
 sangitamay chand madhur padaavalee geetikavyon kii visheshta he
 Adornment, policy, quietness and nature are its main contender
 nari ke soundarya or swabhaav kaa swaabhaavik chithran in kaavyon main miltaa he
 Sources of sermon, policy and public behavior are received in a very delightful way
 yahi kaaran he ki muktakaavyon main sukhtiyon or subhashiton kii prapti prachurtaa se hoti he
 The tradition of muktakavya is derived from the Vedic era in the form of spontaneous messages
 rugveda main sarama naamak kute ko sandesavahak ke rup main bhejne kaa prasang he
 Examples of Vedic muktakavavya are notable, such as the Sukta of Vasistha and Vamadeva
 ramayana, mahabharat or unke parvarti granthon main bhi is prakaar ke sfoot prasang vipul maatra main uplabdh hote hai
 Perhaps this sentiment has been in the form of encryption in the Shakodagars of Mahakavi Valmiki
 pativiyukta pravasini sita ke prati preshit shri ram ke sandeshvahak hanuman, duryodhana ke prati dharmraj yudhisthir dwaara preshit shrikrishna or sundari dayamanti ke nikat raja nal dwaara preshit sandesavahak hans isi parampara ke antargat gine jane vaale prasang hai
 In this context, the Bhagavata Purana's Venugita is particularly quotable, whose sultry image is inscribed on the Sanskrit Muktakayakas
 rajasekhar ne kavicharya ke prakaran main bataaya he ki kavi ko vidyaon or upavidyaon kii shiksha grahan kerani chaiye
 Grammar, dictionary, verses, and ornamentation - these are the four disciplines
 64 kalaayen hi upavidyaayein hai
 There are 8 sources of poetry - health, talent, practice, devotion, scholarly, polyandry, memento and raga
 mammat ne kavy ke chah prayojan bataaye hai- There is a very rich tradition of critics in Indian literature about what is poetry or poetry - from Sanskrit scholars like Acharya Vishwanath, Panditraj Jagannath, Pandit Ambikadatta Vyas, Acharya Shripati, Bhamah etc
 to enlightened poets like modern Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Jaishankar Prasad and modern Meera Mahadevi Varma of the era has expressed her views while clarifying the nature of the poem
 vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki maanav hriday anant rupatamak jagat ke naanaa roopon, vyapaaron main bhatakta rahata he, lekin jab maanav ahan kii bhaavana kaa parityag karke vishuddh anubhuti maatr rah jaataa he, tab vah mukt hriday ho jaataa he
 The word which the voice of man has been providing for the practice of this liberation of the heart is called poetry
 kavita manushya ko swaarth sambandhon ke sankuchit ghere se upar uthaati he or shesh sristi se ragaatmak sambandh jodne main sahaayak hoti he
 Numerous definitions of poetry are given
 ye paribhaashaayen aadhunik hindi kavy ke liye bhi sahi siddh hoti hai
 If poeticism makes the mind feel supernatural bliss, then the strings of the heart become tingling
 kavy main satyam shivan sundaram kii bhaavana bhi nihit hoti he
 The poetry in which all these things are found is considered to be good poetry
 kavy ke bhed do prakaar se kiye gaye hai– Depending on the form, there are two distinctions of poetry - audio and visual
 jis kavy kaa rasaswadan duusare se sunakar yaa swayan pard kar kiya jaataa he use shravy kavy kehete hai
 Such as Ramayana and Mahabharata
 shravy kavy ke bhi do bhed hote hai - prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy
 In this, a major story runs in the form of poetry from beginning to end
 katha kaa kram bich main kahin nahin tuutata or gaun kathaayen bich-bich main sahaayak ban kar aati hai
 Like Ramcharit Manas
 prabandh kavy ke do bhed hote hai - mahakavy evam khandakavy
 1- Epic In this, there is an autobiographical description of the entire life story of a historical or mythological great man
 mahakavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- 2- Khandakavya does not describe anyone's entire biography but only one part of life
 khand kavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- In this, only one verse or verse is able to reveal any emotion or rasa or story independently
 geet kavitt doha aadi muktak hote hai
 The poetry which Anandanubhuti realizes by seeing the act and listening to the narration from the characters is called visual poetry
 jaise naatak main yaa chalchitr main
 1- Verse poetry - In this, a story is described in poetry, like Gitanjali
 2- gadhy kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan gadhy main kiya jaataa he, jaise jaishankar kii kamayani 
 
 
 To compose poetry in prose, the poet gets freedom from the rules of verses
 3- champu kavy - isamen gadhy or padya donon kaa samavesh hota he
 Maithilisharan Gupta's 'yashodhara' is Champu poetry
 aadhunik hindi padya kaa itihaas lagbhag 800 saal purana he or iskaa prarambh terahavin shatabdi se samajha jaataa he
 Like every language, Hindi poetry was also chronological before
 yani kisi kahani ko lay ke saath chand main baandh kar alankaaron se sajaa kar prastut kiya jaataa tha
 All the ancient texts of Indian literature are written in poetry
 iskaa vishesh kaaran yah tha ki lay or chand ke kaaran kavita ko yaad kar lenaa aasaan tha
 At the time when printing was not invented and making many copies of documents was not easy, it was the best tool to remember important things at that time
 yahi kaaran he ki us samay sahitya ke saath saath raajnneeti, vigyaan or ayurveda ko bhi padya main hi likhaa gaya
 The oldest poems of India are in the Sanskrit language in the Rigveda which has a beautiful collection of verses written in praise of nature
 jivan ke anek anya vishyon ko bhi in kavitaaon main sthaan mila he
 Cotton cotton or textiles, when treated with dahk soda, give them excellent quality, lasting silk shine
 aise sooton yaa vastron ko marsrikrut soot yaa vastra kehete hai tathaa marsrikrut hone kii prakriya ko marsrikaran kehete hai
 The inventor of this process was Mercer, an English chemist who invented it in 1844 AD and patented it in 1850 AD
 unheen ke naam par is prakriya kaa naam marsrikaran padaa he
 Mercerization does not just brighten but increases the ability to absorb about 15% strength and dyes
 marsrikrut soot ke bane mojey, baniyine, anya antarvastr, seene ke dhaage, juute ke feete or vayuyan pankhons ke vastra achche hote hai tathaa anya anek kaamon ke liye, jahaan chamak evam majbootee aavashyak hoti he, isse bani vastuen acchhee samajhi jaati he
 Mercerization is carried out using a solution of burning soda
 aise vilyan ke upachaar se soot phool jaataa he
 It is natural to shrink the yarn after flowering, but it is not allowed to shrink
 sikudne se chamak nahin aati
 Pulling the yarn is tied in such a way that it does not shrink
 jis mashin main yah kriya sampann hoti he, usamen daahak soda, soda dhavan, tanu amla or amla dhavan ke liye alag alag paatr hote hai, jinke bich soot kramash: paarit hota hua baahar nikalataa he
 The yarn is also washed out of the machine again, so that it completely neutralizes the acid
 marsrikaran ke liye lambey reshevaali rooyee acchhee samajhi jaati he
 Mercerization on the yarn of a single layer does not shine, but it definitely increases the ability of the yarn to absorb dyes
 dohari param ke soot par hi chamak aati he
 The maximum amount of double layer yarn is mercerized
 daahak soda ke atirikt anya abhikarmak bhi marsrikaran ke liye upyukt ho sakate hai
 Such reagents also contain sulfuric acid or nitric acid
 par inase rooyee ke apghaton hone kaa bhay rahata he
 Great care is taken regarding their concentration
 ek doosraa abhikarmak triton bi, yaa tetra alkil ammonium hydroxide, he, jo rooyee ko marsrikrut karne ke saath ghulaata bhi he
 But due to being cheaper for mercerization, only dahk soda is used extensively
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki daahak soda ke marsrikaran se cellulose, elkali cellulose ban jaataa he
 Some people believe that this alkali cellulose is a adsorption hybrid
 dhone par yah elkali padaarth apaghatit hokar soot se nikal jaataa he
 Regenerated cellulose is chemically the same as normal cellulose, but its molecular state is thought to have changed, causing it to glow
 vilyan main lagbhag 13 se 14 prati shat daahak soda paryaapt he, par jaise jaise marsrikaran aage chalata he, sandran main kami hoti jaati he
 Therefore, it is good to use 20 to 25 per cent solution first for mercerization
 yadi taap nicha ho, to durbal vilyan kaa bhi upyog ho saktaa he, par usase koi vishesh laabh nahin hota
 Addition of some other substances along with soda has also been suggested
 inamen se kuch se soot ke phoolne main vruddhi hoti he, par adhikansh se phoolne main hraas hi hota he
 Mercerization does not change the properties of cotton
 rooyee ke kuch gunon main vruddhi avashya hoti he
 The absorption properties increase from 25 to 50%
 marsrikrut sikudi rooyee main sabase adhik avasorana kshamta rahati he
 Drying of the cotton hinders absorption
 ranjak grahan karne kii kshamta bhi kam ho jaati he
 Names of dispersed cellulose and cellulose hydrate have also been given for the mercerized cellulose, but these names are not correct
 marsrikrut rooyee kaa eks-re vivartan aarekh saamaanya rooyee ke eksre vivartan aarekh se bhinn hota he
 Mercerized yarn can be identified by its dye absorption properties
 saamaanya soot kii apeksha yah adhik gadhe rang main ranga jaataa he
 Colored mercerized yarn is identified by barite absorption of indigo
 marsrikrut soot kaa upyog din din bad rahaa he
 Today, cotton yarn is being made in very large quantities
 iskaa vyapak vyavhaar gat 60 varshon main hi badha he
