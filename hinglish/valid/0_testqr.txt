 Macdonald gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 trogen horse yaa kaath kaa ghoda ek katha he jisamen greek sainikon ne traay nagar main pravesh karne ke liye kaath ke ek vishaal ghode kaa nirmaan kiya or dhokhe se try nagar main pravesh kiya
 The Trojan horse is a tale of the Trojan War, according to Virgil's Latin epic The Enid and Kuintus of Smyrna
 is katha main ghatit ghatnaaye kaansya yug se lee gayi he or yah homer kii odisi ke purv or iliad ke pashchaat likhi gayi thi
 It was only possible through the trick of the Greeks that they could finally enter the city of Troy and end the conflict
 According to a famous account, after 10 years of futile siege, the Greeks built a huge wooden horse and hid a specific contingent of 30 soldiers inside it
 unaniyon ne vahaan se nikal jane kaa naatak kiya or trogence ghode ko apni jeet kaa inaam maanakar shahar main khinch kar le gaye
 The same night a troop of the Greek army came out of the horse and opened the door to the rest of the Greek army, which had returned to the sheet of darkness
 unani sena ne troy shahar main pravesh kar usko nasht kar diya or yuddh ko jeet kar uskaa ant kar diya
 According to Greek tradition, in Homeric Ionic language the horse is called a lumbar horse and a "gift horse"
 lakshanik rup se koi bhi aisi chaal "trogen horse" kahi jane lagi jisase dushman ko kisi surakshit sthaan par aamantrit kar use lakshya banaaya ja sake
 These days it is also often linked to "virus-containing" computer programs and consumers are encouraged to install and run them as useful or harmless
 kuintus smirnius ke anusaar, lakdi ke ek vishaal ghode ke nirmaan, uske andar ek vishisht sena kii tukdi ko chhipaane or trogence ko murkh bana kar ghode ko apni jeet kaa pratik maanakar pahiyon par ludhakaakar shahar ke bheetar le jane kaa vichaar, orissius kii kalpana thi
 Under the leadership of Ipios, the Greeks built a wooden horse in three days
 orissius kii yojana ke anusaar ek aadmi ko ghode ke baahar rahanaa tha; jise unaniyon dwaara ghode ko trogence ke liye uphaar ke rup main or use peeche chhod diye jane kaa naatak karnaa tha
 Only one Greek soldier Sinon accepted to volunteer for this role
 virgil ne sinon or trogence ke bich hui vaastavik muthbhed kaa varnan kiya he: sinon ne safaltaapurvak trogence ko is baat ke liye manaa liya kii unani use peeche chhod kar ja chuke hai
 Sinon tells the Trojans that the horse is an offering by the Greeks to compensate Goddess Athena for the sin of desecrating their temple of Troy, and to ensure their safe journey home
 ghode kaa aakaar itnaa vishaal banane kaa kaaran trogence ko use apane shahar main le jane se rokna tathaa swayan ke liye athena kii kripadrushti kaa sangrah karnaa tha
 At the time of Sinon's interrogation, the Trojan priest Loukoon gets the idea of the plot and warns the Trojans, these lines written by Virgil are famous "timeo Danos et dona ferentes"
 Before any Trojan could believe his warning, Lord Poseidon sent two sea serpents to strangle him and his sons Antiphantes and Thimbreys
 troy kii bhavishyavaktaa tathaa raja prium kii beti kasandra ne bhi kaha ki vah ghoda shahar tathaa shahi parivaar kaa patan kar degaa

 1870 ke dashak main, henrik shaliman ne isaki khoj kii
 According to the description given by Homer, he started digging at Hisarlik in Turkey and found the ruins of several cities built one on top
 Many cities were violently destroyed, but it is unclear which Homer's Troy was
 pusainian, jo do sau saal isa pashchaat rahete the, ne apni pustak yunaan kaa vivaran main likhaa he "ipius kaa kaary ek yukti dwaara trogen kii diwaar main ek daraar banane kaa tha, yah un sabhi ko gyaat he jo frijians kii niri morrkhtaa ko kaaran nahin maanate" yahan par frijians kaa matlab trogence se he
 The Trojan horse, according to modern imagination, would be a wall-breaking plank somewhat resembling a horse, and details of its use were legendarily altered by oral historians who were not present in the war and were unaware of the meaning of its name
 
 us samay asirian log gheraabandi vaale sanghathanon ke liye jaanwaron ke naam istemaal karte the; to yah sambhav he ki trogen horse bhi aisa hi kuch ho
 It is also believed that the Trojan horse is in fact a form of an earthquake that came between battles, which weakened the walls of Troy and left them open for attack; The deity Poseidas performed the tripartite function as the god of the sea, horses and earthquakes
 troy chathe par sanrachanaatmak kshati - uskaa thikaana vahin he jo homer ke iliad main dikhalaayaa gaya he or pai gayi kalakritiyon bhi yah sanket karti hai ki vah ek asaadhaaran vyapaar or shakti ki jagah thi - sanket karti he ki vahaan vastav main koi bukamp aayaa hoga
 Troy viia is generally considered Homer's Troy
 trogen horse hectares kii trogen ashwarohi sena kii ore bhi ek sanket ho saktaa he
 The enemy may have disguised themselves as this cavalry troop and had been taken into Troy without any interrogation
 This interpretation of the Trojan horse is used by author David Gemmell in the third part of Troy's drama
 yahan par trogen harse kaa keval ek hi jivit shastreey chithran he, ek nakkashi, jo maiconos bartan ke he
 It is dated to the eighth century BCE, about 500 years after the estimated time of the war, but traditionally preceded by a description written by Homer

 However, there is no evidence that Manten took his wife with him while patients watch
 iske alaava, vah 1851 main sweekaar kiya ki vah khud ko daant paaya tha
 Everyone agrees that the story is false, although it is known that Manten first acquired the largest fossil bones from the mine in the Green Whitemans in 1820
 Because even theropod teeth were found, thus related to carnivores, he first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine, as those of a giant crocodile into a partial skeleton
 In 1821 Manten noted for the discovery of the vegetarian teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous snake was present in the strata

 Although Cuvier retracted from the very next day, Lyell only reported the dismissal of Manten, who became skeptical about the issue
 1824 main Buckland megaloshoras varnit or ki monten sangrah yatra ke liye aamantrit avasar par tha
 On March 6, looking at the bones, he agreed that these were some of the giant creeping animals, though still denying that it was a herbivore
