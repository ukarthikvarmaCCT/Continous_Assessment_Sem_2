 In the British political concept, the sovereign of Britain is regarded as the human incarnation of the Rajmukut, that is, they are the ultimate source of total authority of the entire state and the whole system, and the British sovereign ultimately has the right to rule over Britain

 However, in governing, policy making and administrative decision making, the substantive contribution of the court is minimal and nominal, as the various historical constitutions and conventions make most of the supremacist powers of the ruler from the crown to ministers and officials or other institutions of the crown
 Passes have been delegated

 Therefore, even today, rulers exercise the right to summon and dissolve the Parliament
 2011 main paarit phixd-turm paraliyaments act ne sansad bhang karne ke ashikaar ko khatm kar diya
 However, the ruler still has the right to perform the suntan
 yadi ek alpsankhyak sarkaar, sansad ko bhang kar nae chunaav ghoshit karne kii maang karti he, to shaasha aisi maang ko kaarij karne ke liye purnatah swatantra hai
 Ideally, the ruler can voluntarily demote the prime minister at any time, but in the current state the prime minister is expelled from office only in the event of death, or electoral defeat

 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he
 This post has no political meaning

 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he

 Spouses of Sovereigns, Disabilities: At least three of the following persons must be confirmed Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord High Advocate, and Protector of the Scrolls
 regency ko puraa karne ke liye, yah bhi ek hi teen vyaktiyon kii ek ghoshnaa kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Regency, when necessary, becomes the Regent following the proper line of succession; Parliamentary voting or some other treatment is needed
 regent, british naagarikta he, or britain kaa nivasee hona
 According to these rules, the only regent was the future George IV, who reigned when his father George III went mad
 haalanki, 1953 main regency ke adhinium kahata he ki agar rani ke uttaradhikari regency kii jarurat he, rajkumaar philip, edinburgh ke duk regent he

 Advisers of state requirements are doing the same as Regents
 vartmaan main, paanch rajyon ke parshadon: Parliament provides funds for most of the sovereign's government spending through parliamentary grants and public funds, known as the "citizen List"
 tathaa ek vaarshik anudaan, shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav tathaa rani kii aadhikarik yatraaon ke liye bhi aavantit kii jaati he
 Funds for most expenses, including staff costs, state visits, formal commitments, and official entertainment, are met by the civic list itself
 yah raashi sansad dwaara 10 varshon kii avadhi ke liye nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 By the year 1760, the financial requirements of the ruler were met by hereditary revenue, profits of crown assets
 1760 main raja jorge tritiy ne apane vanshanugat rajwan kaa parityag civil list ke liye karne kii sahmati de di, jo varsh 2012 tak rahaa
 At present, the amount of money received from Mukutia Estates is more than that given to the Civil List or other grants to the Adhrat
 is prakaar 2007-08 ke bich crown esteton ne rajkosh main £200 million kii vruddhi karwaai, jabaki sansad dwaara 40 lakh pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Thus, with a wealth of 7
3 billion pounds, crown assets are one of the largest landowners in Britain, these sari assets are placed under trust and the sovereign cannot deal with them voluntarily
 2012 ke baad se sansadeey anudaan or naagarik suchi ko mila kar ek sankukt samprabhu anudaan se badal diya gaya he
 Like the Mukutiyya estate, the land and properties of the Duchy of Lancaster have been placed under the royal trust
 yah sab shahi bhatte kaa hissaa he
 The revenue generated by this duchy is used for the "personal expenses" of the ruler, which are not borne by the citizen list
 isi prakaar cornwall kii dachi ek kshetra he, jise shaasha ke jyeshtha putr ke vishwash main, unke nijee kharchon hetu, aavantit kii gayi he
 The sovereign is eligible for indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 also income tax and capital gains tax
 is sandarbh main, naagarik suchi or sansadeey anudaan ko aay nahin mana jaataa he, kyonki unhi aadhikarik kaaryon ke liye diya jaataa he
 Estimates of the queen's total wealth, depending on whether the personal property is being counted or the property held by the ruler in the trust, may vary considerably
 udhaaharan ke liye, shahi sangrah adhirat kii nijee sampatti nahin he, lekin "crown collection trust", ek charity, dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa he
 Forbes magazine's 2008 estimate listed the Queen's personal assets as $ 650 million, but no official figures are available
 1993 main lord chemberlen ne kaha tha kii press main ghoshit, maharani kii nijee sampatti kaa £100 million kaa anumaan "behad atiranjit tha
 " adhirat kaa landan main aadhikarik nivas buckingham mahal he, jo aadhikarik nivas hone ke alaava adhiktar rajkeey va shahi samarohon kaa bhi mukhya sthal he
 In addition to this there is another royal residence, Windsor Castle, which is the largest domed palace in the world, which is mainly used on occasions like weekly holidays, Easter, etc
 scotland main samprabhu kaa aadhikarik nivas haulirud palace he, jo edinburgh main avasthit he
 It is used by the sovereign, on his Scottish travels
 paramparanusaar, samprabhu varsh main kamasekam ek saptaah ke liye haulirudehouse main nivas karte hai
 Historically the main residence of the Anglo Sovereign was the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London, until Henry VIII intervened in the Palace of the Whitehall
 1698 main bheeshan aag ke chalate whiteul mahal tabah ho gaya, jiske baad rajpariwaar saint james palace main shift ho gaya
 Although Buckingham Palace replaced St
 James Palace as the sovereign's main residence in 1837, St
 James Palace still holds the record of being a senior palace, and is still a hostile residence
 yah mahal aaj bhi uttaradhikaar parishad kaa sabha-sthal he tathaa ise rajpariwaar ke anya sadasyon dwaara bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other royal residences include the Clarence House and the Kensington Palace
 ye mahal rajmukut ke hai, or inhen mukut dwaara bhavi shaskaon ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 Sovereigns cannot voluntarily deal with these palaces

 The official flag of the ruler is the royal standard, in which the royal kulanka is displayed
 is maanak ko samprabhu kii mezbaani kar rahe bhawan, pot, vimaan yaa vaahan par pradarshit kiya jaataa he, logon ko samprabhu kii upastithi se aagaah karne ke liye
 The royal standard is never unfurled, as it is never the case that a ruler is absent, because the crown prince becomes a ruler as soon as a ruler dies
 jab shaasha apane mahal main upasthit nahin hote he, tab buckingham palace, windsor kasal or sanderingham house main british dhvaj fahraaya jaataa he, or scotland main sthit mehalon, haulirud pales or balamoral pales main scotland ke shahi maanak ko fahraaya jaataa he

 While it was built between 1538 and 1545 by the Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri, who seized the throne of Delhi from the Mughal emperor Humayun
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki mughal badshaah humayun kii is kile ke ek se neeche girane ke kaaran durghatanavash mrityu ho gai
 It is said that Delhi was first settled by the Pandavas as their capital Indraprastha, that too 1400 years before BC, but there is no firm evidence for this

 Although Mahabharata is considered as a scripture, but many of the Mahajanapadas like Kashi, Kosala Anga, Magadha, Asmak, Avanti, Gandhara, Chedi etc
 mentioned in Buddhist literature "angusad Nikaya" are also mentioned in Mahabharata
 It is an indication that this book is not only mythological, but also preserves some historicity
 puraane kile kii purvi diwaar ke paas dubaara khudaai 1969 se 1973 ke bich bhi kii gai thi
 There is no evidence of human settlement from Mahabharata, but from the Mauryan period to the early Mughal period, this area was full of human settlement

 It is said that the Mughal Emperor Humayun had established his own city "dinpanah" on the same mound on the banks of river Yamuna under which Indraprastha is buried
 tatpashchaat shershah sur ne jab humayun par vijay praapt kii to sabhi bhawanon ko nasht kar vartmaan dilli, shershahi yaa “shergarh” kaa nirmaan prarambh karavaaya
 In the meantime, Humayun reunited and attacked and regained his lost sultanate
 samajha jaataa he ki kile kaa nirmaan kaary humayun ne hi 1545 main purna karaayaa tha
 The old fort was originally built on the banks of the river Yamuna, but from the slopes of the north and west directions, it appears that a moat connecting the river was built for safety

 Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas mentioned in the Mahabharata, was probably at this place
 puraane kile main vibhinn sthanon par shilapaton par yah vaakya likhe hai
 Where was Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas? People have been debating about this
 lekin khudaai main mili avasheshon ke aadhaar par puratatvavidon kaa ek bada varg yah maanata he ki pandavon kii rajdhani isi sthal par rahi hogi
 Although archaeologists do not have strong evidence for this, the remains of the pottery found during the excavation strengthen the talk of the Pandavas being the capital around the fort
 yahaan khudaai main aise bartanon ke avshesh mili hai, jo mahabharat se jude anya sthanon par bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, the context and ancient traditions related to Mahabharata also indicate that here must have been the capital of the Pandavas
 bharat main bahut kam nagar aise hai, jo dilli kii samaan puraane hon
 According to historians, the old fort was built in the 16th century on the high mound of the site where Indraprastha was inhabited in the pre-historic period

 Excavations have unearthed remnants of ancient brown painted pottery, which belong to the Mahabharata period
 aise hi bartan anya mahabharat kaaleen sthalon par bhi paae gaye hai
 There is also a fact about this that a village named Indraprat, the apabhramsa of Indraprastha, was located in Purana Qila until the beginning of the present century
 rajdhani nai dilli kaa nirmaan karne ke dauraan anya gaanvon ke saath use bhi hataa diya gaya tha
 a Sanskrit inscription of 1328 AD has been obtained from Sarval village located in Delhi

 This inscription mentions this village to be located in Indraprastha district
 vahiin mahabharat ke anusaar kuru desh kii rajdhani ganga ke kinare hastinapur main sthit thi
 When relations between the Pandavas and their cousins, the Kauravas deteriorated, Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas, gave the Pandavas the territory of Khandavaprastha on the banks of the Yamuna
 vahaan unhone samudr jaise gaddhon dwaara ghire hue ek nagar ko banaaya or uski rakshaatmak prachiren banaai
 Scholars believe that the outline of Purana Qila was also similar
 isse bhi spasht hota he ki indraprastha ek nagar kaa naam tha, jo purana kila ke sthaan par basaa tha or jis kshetra main yah sthit tha, us kshetra kaa naam khandavaprastha tha
 After his victory over the Kauravas, the Pandavas are said to have handed over the capital Indraprastha to a Yadav descendant belonging to Lord Krishna

 Malan was a Gujarati poet
 unhe gujarati sahitya main aakhyaan kavy kaa janmdata mana jaataa he
 In one of his works, he himself has written that for the satisfaction of the ancient people of Gujarat, he pledged to write Sanskrit mythological stories in Gujarati language
 iske liye kadachit unka virodh bhi hua
 Another notable thing about Malan is his unique devotion which he received through contact with the Ramanandi sect

 He had a great deal of Sanskrit literature
 unke paanditya kaa sarvotkrisht pramaan kadambari kaa anuwaad he jise kuch vidvan unki shreshthatam kriti maanate hai
 The real evaluation of the poet comes from his original works
 tathaapi anuwadkaushal kii drushti se kadambari kii mahatta nirvivaad he
 Malan's specialty is the creation of excellent positions with the Vatsalya expressions of Rama and Krishna
 malan kaa samay saamanyat: sabhi gujarati itihaaskaaron ne 15 veen shatee i0 main mana he tathaapi use sarvatha asandigdh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Malan's expert RN Modi has established him as a contemporary of Narsi between the years 1490 to 1570, but elsewhere his death has been estimated around 1445-46

 There has also been an attempt to prove the unity of Vedant, the great Guru Purushottam of Bhima, the author of Malan and 'harilila Shodas Kala', but this seems to be just a fantasy
 'biju' 'nalakhyaan' or 'malansut' vishnudaas rachit 'uttar cond' kii tithiyaan bhi asandigdh nahin he
 According to Jethalal Trivedi, editor of 'malnana Pad', all the works of Malan can be classified as follows- 'gujarat and its litarechar' main k0 maa0 munshi ne 'rukmini-haran', 'satyabhama vivaah', 'krishna balacharit', 'mahabharat', 'naishadheey', 'nalchampu' or 'har samvaad' naamak rachanaaon kaa ullekh kiya he jinamein se kuch upyukt vargeekaran main nambhed se samavisht hai or kuch dashamaskandh kaa hi ansh hai
 a composition by the name 'ramayana' is also mentioned elsewhere
 malan kii rachanaaon kaa mukhya preranarot valmiki ramayana, mahabharat, shivpurana, markandeya puraana, bhagwat, naishadh or kadambari aadi sanskrit ke maanya granth rahe hai
 In Dasamskandha, the childlike narrative of Krishna is described with special sentimentality
 yashoda ke bhaavon kaa chithran samast gujarati sahitya main adwitiya lagata he
 The Vatsalya description of Sur shows a sufficient resemblance in it
 brajabhasha ke padakaron kaa malan par nishchit prabhaav prathit hota he
 Yashoda's mourning for his girl in the absence of Krishna is also not available in the Krishna literature of Braj
 ram kii bal lilaon kaa varnan malan ne krishna balacharit ke samaantar or bhi adhik kiya he kyonki ve swayan rambhakt the
 Even at the end of Krishna-related positions, the impression of 'malan Prabhu Ram' or 'malan Prabhu Radhunath' is inevitably available which proves the exclusivity of Rambhakti

 An electric motor is an electrochemical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy; That is, when it is connected to the appropriate power source, it starts rotating, due to which the machine or machine attached to it also starts rotating

 There is hardly any purpose in industries for which an appropriate electric motor cannot be selected
 vidyut motaron kaa mul uddeshy vidyutchumbakeey bal / balaghurna utpann karke stater or roter ke bich aapekshik gati paidaa karnaa he
 In this way, electric motor takes mechanical work by taking electrical energy

 For linear motors, jahaan f newton main tathaa veg v meter prati second main hogi
 Power is an ideal staple driver in the motor industries
 adhikansh mashine vidyut motaron dwaara hi chalaai jaati he
 The main reason for this is that the efficiency of electric motors is higher than other drivers

 Electric motors are made of different types for different purposes

 According to the supply, two types of motor have traditionally been counted as ham ynha sansofhan dekhnege-directhara motor and alternating current motor

 The second classification of motors is done as synchronous and asynchronous
 yah kuch seemaa tak adhik tarkpurna vargeekaran he
 The rotor of synchronous machines rotates at the same angular speed as the magnetic field produced by the alternating current of that motor

 The induction motor is a prime example of this

 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction

 Three phage synchronous motors are of little use

 It does not start by itself and some additional arrangements have to be made to start running

 Shog motors are very suitable if movement is to be done in a wide range
 bahut se sthanon main disht dhara, shrenee motor kaa prachaalan lakshan vaanchhneeya hota he
 Efforts have also been made to arrange this in alternating current motors
 prayavarti dhara shrenee motor evam dikparivartak motor isi prakaar ke vishisht lakshanon kii vyavastha karte hai
 Synchronous motors can only operate at synchronous speed
 at: jahaan ekasmaanchaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan ye adarsh hote hai
 Just as direct current generator and motor are virtually the same machine and it is possible to use both in any form
 usee prakaar tulykaalik motor bhi, vastut:, prayavarti dhara janitr kaa, jise saamanyat: prayavartitra kehete hai, hi rup he or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Its operation requires both alternating current transmission in its stator and direct current exciter in the rotor
 in motaron kaa prayog kuch simit he
 Like repatriated for direct current stimulation, they also have a stimulant arranged like repatriated for an excitation
 in motaron kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki uttejnaa ko badhaane se shaktigunank bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, especially in industries where the power factor is greatly reduced due to having many induction motors, or due to some other reason, the power factor can be improved by arranging synchronous motors
 bahut se sthanon main to ye motor keval shaktigunank sudhaar ke liye hi prayukt kiye jate hai
 In such case they are called synchronous capacitors
 bahut se sthanon main keval ekakaleey sambharan hi uplabdh hota he
 Unilateral motors are used there
 choti mashiinon tathaa gharelu kaaryon ke liye ekakaleey preran motor bahut lokapriy hai
 Unitary motors are also used in electric wings
 isi prakaar dhavan mashiinon, prashitakon tathaa silaai kii mashiinon ityadi main ekakaleey motor hi pramukh kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty of single-phase motors lies in their starting
 aarambh karne ke liye kisi prakaar kaa kala vipatan aavashyak hota he
 Art splitting is usually done by an auxiliary coil, which has a capacitor placed in the aerapath, which displaces the current of the auxiliary coil about 10 electromagnets from the current of the main coil
 iske kaaran ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti sambhav ho sakati he or motor chalane lagata he
 Operating capacitance of the motor is also improved by having the capacitor in the circuit
 bahut se chote chote motor saarvatrik kism ke hote hai or disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can be used both in direct current and reverse current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara ev prayavarti dhara donon main hi sambhav he, parantu ye atyant chote aakaaron main hi banaae ja sakate hai or keval kuch vishesh prayuktiyon main hi kaam aate hai
 Very small size motors are used in meters and other instruments and where an electric amount is to be measured
 duurastha niyantran, athwa valve ityadi ko kholane ke liye bhi, bahut se chote motor prayukt hote hai
 The upper cover of the motor is made according to different circumstances
 kuch motor khule hue praroop ke hote hai, jinamein unke andar ke bhaag saamne dikhaai padate hai, parantu aise motaron main dhul mitti jane kaa dar rahata he
 Therefore they cannot be used in open spaces
 parantu aise motaron main prakritik sanvathan acha hota he
 Therefore, they do not get heated quickly
 is kaaran aise motor aakaar ke anusaar saapekshatya adhik kshamta ke hote hai
 Where the motor has to operate in open spaces, there may be fear of dust, dirt etc
, so fully covered motors are used
 aise motaron main mukhya kathinaayee sanvathan kii hoti he
 Their casing is also made so that it can expand maximum heat
 saath hi usee isha par aropit ek pankhe kii bhi vyavastha hoti he, jo motor ke andar sanvathan vaayu ko pravesh kar sake or usamen utpann honevaali ooshmaa ko vistarit kar sake
 Semi-enclosed motors are satisfactory for most purposes, in which visible parts of the motor are covered by a lattice
 is prakaar inamen uparyukt donon prarupon ke laabh nihit rahete hai
 Special types of coverings are made for special conditions, such as completely flameless motors are used inside mines or in explosive environments
 isi prakaar kuch motor pani main neeche kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana is prakaar hoti he ki pani motor ke andar na ja sake
 Different types of veils are made in many different circumstances
 bahut si motaron ko bhaar se sidhe hi sambhddha kar diya jaataa he or bahut si avasthaaon main unhen pattee, gear athwa chen dwaara sambhddha kiya jaataa he
 An almost constant speed ratio can be maintained from gears to driver and driven machines, and different moves can also be obtained by changing the gear order
 pattee dwaara shakti ke preshan main mashin ko motor se kaaphi dur bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he or ek saamaanya isha ko bhi chalaaya ja saktaa he, jisase duusari mashine sambhddha hon
 This is usually the case in large factories
 motaron kii kshamta ke liye mukhya parisima taap kii vruddhi he
 There is also the fear of damage due to the increase in heat, and the efficiency of the motor is also reduced due to increase in losses
 is prakaar motor anwarat prachaalan nahin kar saktaa
 Most motors are decelerated to a specific heat surge, which depends on the class of the insulator
 bahut se motor "santat kshamta" ke hote hai, jiskaa taatpary he ki vah nirdhaarit bhaar, bina taap ke vishisht seemaa tak bade, nirantar sambharan kar sakate hai
 Many motors operate at full load only for a short period of time and the rest of the time they are at low load or remain closed
 yadi prachaalankram nishchit ho, to aise prayojanon ke liye kam kshamta kii motor keval alp kaal ke liye hi purna bhaar par prachaalan karte hai or baaki samay bahut kam bhaar par rahete hai athwa band rahete hai
 If the operation is fixed, then low-capacity motors can be used for purposes whose operation and capacity are fixed for a short time
 1744 gregory calendar kaa ek adhivarsh he
 Rameshchandra Dutt was a famous administrator, economic historian and writer of India and translator of Ramayana and Mahabharata
 bhartiya rashtrawaad ke purodhaon main se ek ramesh chandra dutt kaa aarthik vichaaron ke itihaas main pramukh sthaan he
 Dadabhai Naorozi and Major B
 Dutt was the third economic thinker along with D
 Basu to present authentic accounts of the damage done to the Indian economy under colonial rule and the famous 'drain Theory'
 iskaa matlab yah tha ki angrej apane laabh ke liye nirantar niryaat thopane or anaavashyak adhibhaar vasuulne ke jariye bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nichod rahe hai
 Ramesh Chandra Dutt was born in 1848 in a family in Kolkata who had acquired considerable wealth by doing business under the East India Company

 He returned to India in 1871
 inhone apane in teen varsho ke england pravaas ke vishay main ek pustak 'thri iers in englad' likhi
 After coming to India, he held various administrative posts and was commissioner and political agent of Orissa, Diwan of Baroda and a member of the Royal Commission
 ramesh chandra dutt 1882 main bengal ke vibhinn jilon main prashasnic kaamkaaj dekhte rahe
 After becoming the District Magistrate in 1883, he was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Bardhaman District in 1894
 unnisvin sadi main itane bade pad par pahunchne vaale ve pehle bhartiya the
 In 1897 he retired from the ICS and spent the period up to 1904 in Europe
 ve landan ke university college main itihaas ke professor bhi rahe
 In 1899, the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress elected him its president
 san 1897 se 1904 tak ye landan vishvavidhyalay main bhartiya itihaas ke praadhyaapak rahe
 He died in 1909
 apane gahan anusandhan or vishleshan se dutt ne dikhaaya ki british shashan na keval bharat kii bhautik sthiti sudhaarney main vifal rahaa, balki uske kaal main bharat kaa vi-udyogikaran hua
 As a result of British economic policy, India's handicrafts production fell drastically and industrial production did not increase as a compensation
 na hi bhartiya udyogon ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sangrakshan pradaan kiya gaya
 As a result, the Indian economy was forced to depend on agriculture more than ever before
 bhartiya samaaj kaa dehathikaran hota chalaa gaya
 Dutt said that India did not benefit from the perceived constructive steps of British colonialism
 angrezon dwaara shuru kiye gayi rail- parivahan ke kaaran parmparik parivahan sevaayen maari gayin or trainon kaa istemaal british kaarakaanon main bane maal kii dhulaai ke liye hota rahaa
 Dutt concluded that the Indian economy is not underdeveloped, but its growth has been stunted
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya itihaas vidwaanon ke ek hisse main prachlit us marxvaadi dharna ko jhuthlaata he jiske mutabik british upniveshwaad kii bhoomika pragatisheel tehraayi jaati he
 Apart from economic historian Ramesh Chandra Dutt was also a talented and skilled cultural historian
 bangeey sahitya parishad ke sansthaapak adhyaksh rahane ke saath-saath unhone mahabharat or ramayana kaa angrezi main sankshipt kavyanuwaad bhi kiya
 Based on the evidence of Sanskrit literature, Dutt also composed the history of ancient civilization of India
 british aarthik niti ke dushprinaamon par prakaash daalane ke alaava aarthik vichaaron ke vikaas main dutt kaa doosraa pramukh yogadan yah tha ki unhone arthvyavastha main sarkari hastkshep kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii vakaalat kii
 He recommended this in the early twentieth century at a time when other Indian economists were seeking to reduce the government's interference in economic life
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko nijee pahalakadami ghataane vaale hastkshepon se bachanaa chahie, lekin khaas paristhitiyon main dakhsandaazi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie taaki asthai kism ke sankaton se bachate hue hiton kaa takaraav taala ja sake
 Dutt's method of estimating the reality was also different in that era
 vaastaviktaa ke anek kaarnon main ek ko pramukh or dusron ko uskaa prabhaav maan kar chalane ke bajaay dutt ne aarthik or raajnneetik tathyon kii paraspar nirbharta kii avadharana viksit kii
 He believed that everything in the system of society is interdependent, interconnected, so nothing should be done like disturbing the balance
 lekin, saath main dutt yah bhi samajhate the ki santulan hameshaa ek jaisaa nahin rahata he
 He is constantly changing
 isliye sarkaar ko hastkshep karte samay kii fori sthiti kii antarnihit gatishiltaa par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, varanaa uske hastkshepkaaree kadamon kaa parinaam vipareet bhi nikal saktaa he
 The publication of Dutt's works on economics began in 1900
 unki pehali pustak thi bharat main padane vaale akalon kaa adhyayan karne vaali 'femins and land acesment in india' jisaki saraahna roosi araajaktaavaadi darshanik prince kropatakin ne bhi kii thi
 His work showed how interested he was in the living conditions of the Indian farmer and how his economic thinking was focused on improving his condition
 dutt ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1858 ke baad se chalis saal kii avadhi main bharat kii janata ko das bheeshan akalon kaa saamana kyon karnaa padaa? unhone poocha ki is dauraan hukumat east india company ke bajaay samraji ke haath main thi
 During this time there was usually peace and only one war took place
 hukumat ke paas prashikshit prashaasak the jinhen bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa paryaapt anubhav tha
 The land was fertile, farmers were entrepreneurs and economists
 aisi anukool paristhitiyon ke baavjood aisa kyon hua ki in akalon ke dauraan kareeb dedh karod log bhukh ke shikaar ho kar jaan se haath se dho baithe? dutt yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki akalon kaa kaaran aabaadi main tej rakrataar se hui badhotaree he yaa bharat ke kisaan laaparvaah, kahil or fizoolsearch hai
 He also did not accept that farmers being trapped under the clutches of usurers could be the cause of famine
 dutt ne apane adhyayan main dikhaaya ki bharat main aabaadi badhane kii raftaar england ke mukaable na keval hameshaa kam rahi, balki unke adhyayan se pehle ke das varshon main is desh kii aabaadi main badhotaree ruk hi gayi thi
 According to Dutt, more hardworking and less spending farmers than India are nowhere else in the world
 unhone akaal ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaale aayogon kii rapaton kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkari rajasav kii kathortapurvak vasuuli ke kaaran hi kisaanon ko mahajanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Showing a mirror to the British government, Dutt demonstrated that despite the famine, there was no year when all the crops had fallen
 sarkari godaamon main anaaj hameshaa bharaa rahaa
 If the crop in one province has deteriorated, the crop has been good in another province
 kheti kaa vistaar hua he, vah saghan bhi hui he, pehle ke mukaable paidaavaar bhi badi he, khetihar upaj kii keemten bhi badi hai, par iske baad bhi kisaanon kii haalat lagaataar karaab hoti gayi he
 Dutt blamed British policies for this
 1902 main dutt ke mahaan granth 'da iconomic history of british india' kaa pehla khand prakashit hua
 It is known as the best text written on British rule
 isamen 1757 main angrezon kii satta kii sthapana se lekar samraji kii hukumat lagu hone tak kaa aarthik itihaas pesh kiya gaya tha
 It had an analytical account of policies related to farming and land settlement, trade and factory production policies as well as finance and administration policies adopted under the East India Company
 pustak ke british samikshakon ne bhi isaki nishpakshta or gaharaai kaa loha mana
 In 1904, the second volume of this epic was published
 unhone pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki british shashan ke praarambhik varshon main apanaayi gayi swarthpurna nitiyaan bhartiya udyogon ke patan ke liye zimmedaar rahi hai
 Dutt, highlighting the causes of poverty in India, proved that the British industry had to destroy the indigenous industries and handicrafts
 lakhon log berojgaar ho gayi jisase jivan-yaapan ke liye unke saamne kheti ke alaava koi or chaara nahin rah gaya
 In this way, the number of people living on the basis of agriculture increased and the standard of living of all fell
 iske saath-saath angrez bharat par hukumat karne ke liye baari dhan karchate rahe jiskaa mulk ko koi faaydaa nahin pahunchaa
 The fiscal policy and the land revenue system were made in such a way that only the surviving resources remained with the farmer
 dutt ke paas in samasyaon kaa ilaaj karne kaa nuskhaa bhi tha
 He recommended that the excise duty should be removed from the Indian mill industry, farmers should be rid of all taxes other than the soft taxation of low rates, military and royal expenditure in England should not be recovered from India and also in India Expenses should be reduced dutt ne jaise hi ye suzav diye, british hukumat or uske himytiyon ne unki chautarfa aalochana shuru kar di
 An attempt was made to dismiss his facts and analysis
 dhyaan rahe ki dutt indian civil services ke varisht adhikari the or british shashan kii seva karne ke daayitv se bandhe hue the
 However, he continued to argue with his opponents and urged the government to change the policies to improve India's economic condition
 inaki vilakshan pratibha keval prashasnic kaaryon tak hi simit nahin thi, varan ye moulik lekhak tathaa itihasajna bhi the
 At the beginning of his writing, he wrote in English, but later also composed in Bengali with the influence of Bankim Chandra

 With a view to grabbing the state of Ramgarh by declaring Rajgarh Vikramajit Singh of Ramgarh as deranged and Aman Singh and Sher Singh as minor, the British rulers acted in the "court of Wards" and appointed Sheikh Mohammed and Mohammad Abdullah as governors for the administration of the state
 Sent to Ramgarh

 The queen also knew the result of this usurpation policy of the British rulers, yet she drove both the outgoing officers out of Ramgarh
 1855 i

 Now, as the guardian of minor sons, the state power came to the queen
 rani ne rajya ke krishakon ko angrejon ke nirdeshon ko na maanane kaa aadesh diya, is sudhaar kaary se rani kii lokapriyata badi
 The strength of the British increased in 1857 with the construction of the Sagar and Narmada enclaves
 ab angrejon ko roak paanaa kisi ek raja yaa talukedaar ke vash kaa nahin rahaa
 The queen organized a huge conference of kings, parganadars, zamindars and big Malgujars from around the state at Ramgarh, presided over by King Shankarashah of Garh Purva
 is gupt sammelan ke bare main jabalpur ke kamishnar major iskain or mandla ke dipti kamishnar wadington ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 According to the decision taken at the secret conference, the responsibility of publicity was on the queen

 The soldiers of the queen climbed the Ghaghri and took control over it and entrusted the responsibility to Umrao Singh for the protection of the talukedar Dhan Singh
 ramgarh ke kuch sipaahi evam mukaas ke jameendaar bhi narayanganj pahunchakar jabalpur-mandla maarg ko band kar diya
 Thus the whole district and the state of Ramgarh had revolted and Waddington was unable to crush the rebels
 vah vidrohiyon kii gatividhiyon se bhaybheet ho chukaa tha
 Except Mandla Nagar, the entire district had become independent

 Under the leadership of Lieutenant Werton, the forces of Nagpur were marching towards Ramgarh after conquering the Bichhiya, it was known to Waddington, so Waddington advanced towards Ghighri
 15 janvari 1858 ko ghughari par angrejon kaa niyantran ho gaya
 Ramgarh surrounded the second week of March 1858

 Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory of Delhi is a union territory and metropolis of India
 isamen nai dilli sammilit he jo bharat kii rajdhani he
 Being the capital of Delhi, the headquarters of the three central government units - Executive, Parliament and Judiciary are established in New Delhi and Delhi
 Delhi, spread over 1483 square kilometers, is the second largest metropolis in India
 yahan kii jansankhya lagbhag 1 karod 70 lakh he
 The main languages spoken here are: Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu and English
 bharat main dilli kaa aitihaasik mahatva he
 To its southwest are the Aravalli hills and to the east is the Yamuna River, on the banks of which it is inhabited
 yah pracheen samay main ganga ke maidan se hokar jane vaale vaanijya pathon ke raste main padane vaala mukhya padaav tha
 Situated on the banks of river Yamuna, this city has a glorious mythological history
 yah bharat kaa ati pracheen nagar he
 The beginning of its history is associated with the Indus Valley Civilization
 haryana ke aasapaas ke kshetron main hui khudaai se is baat ke pramaan mili hai
 Its name was Indraprastha in Mahabharata period
 dilli sultanate ke utthan ke saath hi dilli ek pramukh rajnatik, saanskrithik evam vanijyik shahar ke rup main ubhari
 Many ancient and medieval buildings and their remains can be seen here
 1639 main mughal badshaah shahjahan ne dilli main hi ek charadivari se ghire shahar kaa nirmaan karavaaya jo 1679 se 1857 tak mughal samrajya kii rajdhani rahi
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British East India Company captured almost the whole of India
 in logon ne kolkata ko apni rajdhani banaaya
 In 1911, the British government decided to bring the capital back to Delhi
 iske liye puraani dilli ke dakshin main ek nae nagar nai dilli kaa nirmaan prarambh hua
 After independence from the British in 1947, New Delhi was declared the capital of India
 swatantraaa prapti ke pashchaat dilli main vibhinn kshetron se logon kaa pravaasana hua, isse dilli ke swaroop main amul parivartan hua
 Due to the migration of people of different provinces, religions and castes to Delhi, Delhi was urbanized and a mixed culture was also born here
 aaj dilli bharat kaa ek pramukh rajnatik, saanskrithik evam vanijyik kendra he
 There is no definite reference to how the city was named "delhi", but it is widely believed that it is related to an ancient king "dhillu"
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa yah maananaa he ki yah dehali kaa ek vikrut rup he, jiskaa hindustani main arth hota he 'choukhat', jo ki is nagar ke sambhavtah sindhu-ganga samabhumi ke pravesh-dwaar hone kaa suchak he
 According to another estimate, the initial name of this city was "dhilika"
 hindi / praakrit "dhili" bhi is kshetra ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The earliest mention of Delhi is found in the Maha Purana called Mahabharata where it is mentioned as ancient Indraprastha
 indraprastha mahabharat kaal me pandavon kii rajdhani thi
 The first evidence that has been found archaeologically suggests that two thousand years before Christ, humans lived in and around Delhi
 maury-kaal se yahan ek nagar kaa vikaas hona aarambh hua
 Tomar Raja Anangpal has been described as the founder of Delhi in Prithviraj Raso, the Hindi work of Chand Bardai, the court poet of Maharaj Prithviraj Chauhan
 aisa mana jaataa he ki usne hi 'laal-kot' kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha or mahrauli ke gupt kaaleen louh-stambh ko dilli laayaa
 The rule of Tomars in Delhi is believed to be from the year 900-1200

 Shahjahanabad is called Old City or Old Delhi in common parlance
 prachinkaal se puraani dilli par anek raajaaon evam samraaton ne rajya kiya he tathaa samay-samay par iske naam main bhi parivartan kiya jaataa rahaa tha
 Old Delhi remained the capital of the Mughal emperors after 1638
 dilli kaa aakhri mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar tha jisaki mrityu niwarsan main hi rangoon main hui
