 Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a high level cultivation practice based on the nature of the universe - truth, compassion and tolerance sadhana kaa arth he swayan ko nirantar in brahmad ke siddhanton ke anuroop behatar karnaa
 “abhyaas” kaa arth he – falun dapha ke paanch saral vyaayaamon kaa abhyaas karnaa
 sadhana aavashyak he; abhyaas is prakriya kaa poorak he
 Over time, the principles of Dafa will unveil the most serious and deep truths of the universe
 Walking according to principles, Falun Dafa practitioners can reach very high levels, enlighten the real meaning of life, and return to their original self
 vaise to vyaayaamon kaa aantarik arth gaharaa he, lekin ve tanaav ko kam karne or swasthya evam fitness main bahut sudhaar laa sakate hai
 Falun Dafa has an ancient history
 It was taught from one guru to one disciple in every generation
 The disciple would later make his disciple to whom he would transfer the teachings, thus this practice would be transferred in history
 1992 main, shri lee hongzi ne pehali baar falun dapha saarvajanik rup se china ke nagar, changachun main sikhaaya, or phir desh bhar main apane vyaakhyaan jari rakhe
 jinhone usamen bhaag liya unhen vyapak laabh hua or ki ve apane mitron or parivaar ko bhi bataane lage
 As a result, the number of practitioners grew very rapidly by telling each other, by 1998 at least 7 crores people started practicing only in China
 aaj, dapha kaa abhyaas 100 se bhi adhik deshon main 10 crores se adhik logon dwaara kiya jaataa he, tathaa ise bahut se sammaan praapt hue hai
 Falun Dafa practitioners try to increase their xinxing and remove their attachments to become kinder, more honest and more tolerant
 The more one is able to increase his xinxing, the deeper his understanding of the teachings of Xuan Falun will be
 falun dapha ke abhyaasi saadhaaran samaaj ke jatil maahaul main saamaanya rup se rahete hue sadhana karte hai
 is abhyaas main sabhi rashtriyata, jati, saamaajik or aarthik prishthbhumi, ling, umr, vyavsaayon, or vibhinn dharmon ke logon kaa swaagat he, or ve apane swatantra man se, apni gati se or jab tak chahen iskaa abhyaas kar sakate hai
 Falun Gong • It discusses the practice and practice of the principles of Falun Dafa • How to do exercises is explained by example zuaan falun• falun dapha kaa vyapak vivaran he jo guru lee hongzi ke nau vyakhyano kaa sangrah he• zuaan falun falun dapha ke liye nishchit maardarshak he Falun Dafa has a collection of five exercises that are slow, gentle and easy to learn
 pehla vyaayaam, "buddha sahastra hast pradarshan vyaayaam", khinchaav dwaara sabhi shakti nadiyon ko kholane par kendrit he
 doosraa vyaayaam, "falun sthir mudra vyaayaam", yah shant bhav main khadey rahane kaa vyaayaam he jisamen chakra ko thaamne kii chaar mudraaen he
 Falun static posture exercise is a method of intense meditation, which increases the discretion, raises the level and strengthens the divine powers
 The third exercise, "the two sides of the universe penetrating exercise", aims at penetrating the power of the universe and merging it with the inner power of the body
 a large amount of power is taken out and taken
 In a very short time, practitioners can remove diseased and black chi from their body and can take the energy of the universe in sufficient quantity, which makes their body clean and pure
 The fourth exercise, "falun Divine Circuit Exercise", makes this exercise capable of spreading the power of the human body over a much larger area
 pachanva vyaayaam ek shantipurna abhyaas karne kaa vyaayaam he, "divya shaktiyon ko sudruth karne kaa vyaayaam", is vyaayaam main sahajata se shant avasthaa main zyada se zyada der baithna hota he
 The major feature of Falun Dafa is the Falun or principle cycle
 falun pratik yin-yang ke vibhinn roopon or swastik se bana he
 yin-yang pratik paaramparik rup se tao vichaardhaara se hai, jabaki swastik sahasrabdiyon se buddha vichaardhaara ke sadhana ke tareekon ke saath juda rahaa he
 Falun Gong is being practiced by more than 100 million people in more than 114 countries worldwide
 But the sad thing is that China, which is the birthplace of Falun Gong, is being oppressed there
 Due to its health benefits and spiritual teachings, Falun Dafa became so popular in China that by 1999 around 7 to 100 million people started practicing it
 At that time the membership of the Chinese Communist Party was only 60 million
 Its growing base began to upset the Chinese rulers
 Despite the peace-loving nature of Falun Dafa, the Chinese Communist Party considered it a threat to its sovereignty and imposed a ban on it on 20 July 1999, and tried to root it out within a few months
 pichley 16 varshon se chini communist party falun gong ko dabaane ke liye krur daman kar rahi he
 lakhon falun gong abhyaasiyon ko bandi bana liya gaya, lebar camp main bheja gaya, unki jameen-jaaydaad jabt kar leen
 abhyaasiyon ko shaareerik or maansik yatnaaen di jaati hai or abhyaas ko chhodane ke liye brainwash kiya jaataa he
 china main saikadon lebar camp hai jahaan lakhon falun gong abhyaasi kaid hai
 inhi kaidiyon kaa shoshan kar unase muft khilone, kapade, murtiyan or anya utpaada banawaaye jate hai
 yahi kaaran he ki ye itane saste hote hai
 In the last few years China has emerged as a tourist center for organ transplant internationally
 Thousands of people go there for organ transplant
 But they do not know where these organs come from
 pichley 15 varshon se china main salanaa 10,000 se adhik ang pratyaropan hue hai
 china main ang daan main dene kii pratha nahin he
 to ye ang kahan se aate hai? ascharyajanak yah he ki china main ang pratyaropan kii pratiksha avadhi bahut kam he – keval kuch hafte
 jabaki duusare deshon main anukool ang milane main varshon lag jate hai
 to yah kaise sambhav he? This seems unbelievable, but in China, organs for organ transplantation come not only from the prisoners of death, but also from a large number of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners
 Large scale illegal money is being earned in this crime of human organ transplant in China
 The cornea costs $ 30,000, the liver and kidney $ 1,80,000
 China's illegal human organ transplant industry has an annual turnover of 1 billion dollars

 In 2014, the Independent Investigator and China Specialist published his third book, "the Sloter"
 According to Ethan Gutman, between 2000 and 2008 64,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed in China for their limbs

 In December 2014, Chinese officials submitted a memorandum that from January 2015, the practice of organ transplantation of death row inmates would be abolished
 This move of China is just an excuse to stop the condemnation of the international community
 At the same time, it also ignores the evidence that most organs for transplant in China are obtained by killing Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned there
 The billion-dollar organ transplant industry in China is still flourishing today, and evidence suggests that there has been no change in this disgusting practice

 Revolutionary change or conversion is a term used by Thomas Kuhn in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolution, which he used to express a change in core beliefs within the dominant theory of science
 yah saamaanya vigyaan ke bare main unke vichaar se bhinn he
 Since then, the term revolutionary change has become widely used in many other parts of the human experience as the basic ideal of events, although Kuhn himself has restricted the use of this term to the hard sciences
 kuhn ke anusaar, "kranti vah cheez he jiskaa keval vaigyanik samaaj ke sadsy hi saajha karte hai
 "
 Unlike the general scientist, Kuhn said," There are always many competing and incomparable solutions to these problems in front of the student of non-scientific subjects, such solutions, which he must finally consider for himself
 "once the revolutionary change is completed So no scientist, for example, can accept this possibility as a fact that the disease is caused by miasma or light from ether
 Is obtained
 iske vipareet, vigyanetar vishyon ke aalochak mudraon kii ek sarani kaa prayog kar sakate hai, jo kisi di gai avadhi main kamobesh fashneble ho sakati hai lekin ve sabhi vidhisammat maani jaati hai
 In the 1960s the term has been found useful by thinkers from innumerable unscientific perspectives
 zeetjist ke ek rachanaatmak prakaar ke rup main tulana karen
 The scholastic revolutionary change was called the Scientific Revolution by the scholar and historian Thomas Kuhn in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolution
 kuhn ke anusaar, vaigyanik kranti tab hoti he jab vaigyanikon kaa saamana aisi asaamanyataon se hota he, jo saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut us roopantaran ke aadhaar par samajhaaii nahin ja sakati hai, jisaki seemaa main rah kar ab tak kii vaigyanik tarakkee kii gai ho
 This transformation is not just the current theory in Kuhn's view, but a whole worldview, in which it and its inherent effects are present
 yah vaigyanikon dwaara apane chaaron ore pahachaani gai gyaan kii drushyavali kii visheshtaon par aadhaarit he
 Kuhn pointed out that all conversions have abnormalities, which are discarded as errors of acceptable levels or ignored rather than dealt with
 kuhn ke anusaar us samay ke vaigyanikon ke liye in asamantaaon kaa vibhinn staron par mahatv hota he
 In the context of early twentieth-century physics, some scientists felt more difficulty than the results of the michelson-morley experiment in calculating Mercury's perihelion and contrasted it with some
 yahaan or anya kai sthanon par kuhn ke vaigyanik badlaav ke model main taarkik pratyakshvaadiyon ke model kii tulana main is baat main bhinnata dekhi gai he ki yah vigyaan ko keval taarkik yaa darshanik upkram na maanakar vaigyanikon ke rup main kaary kar rahe vyaktigat maanav par adhik jor detaa he
 "scientific discipline, according to Kuhn, goes into a crisis situation when enough significant abnormalities accumulate against the current transformation
 sankat ke samay, nai yuktiyaan, sambhawatah pehle kii tyaagi hui, prayog main laai jaati hai
 Eventually a new adaptation is created, which has its own new followers and an intellectual war between those who believe in new and old conversions
 praarambhik beesvin sadi ke bhautik shaastra ke liye maxwellion vidyutchumbakeey vaishvik najariye or oinstin kaa saapekshata ke najariye ke bich parivartan na to kshanik or na hi shantipurna tha, balki donon pakshon kii taraf se prayogsiddh jaankaree or alankarik yaa darshanik tarkon ke saath kiye gaye hamalon ke lambey itihaas se bharaa tha, jisamen antat oinstiniyan siddhant kii jeet hui
 phir, sabooton ke vajan or nai jaankaree ke mahatv ko maanviya chalani se chaanaa gaya, kuch vaigyanikon ne oinstin ke samikarnon kii saralata ko adhik sammohak paaya jabaki anyon ko ve maxwell ke ether ke vichaar se adhik jatil lage jise unhone tyaag diya tha
 Some found Eddington's pictures of the light turning around the Sun compelling, while some questioned his accuracy and meaning
 Kuhn quotes Max Planck, "the triumph of the new scientific truth is not by satisfying and convincing its adversaries but by the death of these adversaries over time and the new offspring born and grown with this truth" , Said that sometimes the power that brings confidence in them is only the sacrifice of time and humanity taken by it
 kisi vishay ke ek roopantaran se duusare main parivartit hone ko kuhn kii padaavalee main vaigyanik kranti yaa krantikari badlaav kaha jaataa he
 The term scientific revolution or revolutionary change is often used in common language for this end result arising from a long process: a mere change, without taking into account the specifics of Kuhn's historical logic, in a global view
 roopantaranon kaa ek aam galat vivechan yah maananaa he ki krantikari badlaavon kii khoj or vigyaan kii gatisheel prakruti aapekshitata kaa ek maamla he: yah najariya ki sabhi tarah ke vishwaas tantra samaan hai, is tarah ki jaadu, dharmik siddhant yaa mithyavigyaan vaastavik vigyaan ke jitne hi samaan kaaryaatmak mulya rakhte hai
 Kuhn strongly refutes this interpretation, saying that when a scientific conversion is replaced by a new conversion, which, although a complex social process, the new conversion is not only different but always better
 aapekshitata ke ye daawey, ek or daawey se bandhe hai jiskaa samarthan kuhn kisi tarah se karte hai: ki vibhinn roopantaranon kii bhashaa or siddhanton ko ek duusare main parivartit yaa unka ek duusare ke prati yuktisangat moolyankan nahin kiya ja saktaa-yani ve athulaneey hai
 This led to discussion of radically different worldviews or theoretical schemes of different peoples and cultures - so different that whether they were better or not, they could not be understood by each other
 Nevertheless, philosopher Donald Davidson published a highly regarded essay, "on the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme," in 1974, in which he argued that the idea that any language or theory is incomparable to each other, itself It is incompatible
 yadi yah sahi he to kuhn ke daavon ko jis jor se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ve usase kahin adhik kamjor hai
 Furthermore, the widespread use of multi-converting methods to understand complex human behavior has significantly reduced the grip of social analysis on social science
 krantikari badlaav aise vigyaanon main adhik naatakeey hote hai jo sthir or paripakv najar aate hai, jaise 19veen sadi ke ant main bhautik shaastra tha
 At that time, physics was a subject fulfilling the last few points of a mostly developed system
 1900 main, lard kelvin ne mashhoor vaktavy diya, ”ab bhautik shaastra main avishkaar ke liye kuch nayaa nahin bachaa he
 There is only need to measure with greater precision
 " paanch varsh ke baad, albert oinstin ne vishesh saapekshitata par apane shodh kaa prakaashan kiya, jisane do sau varshon se bhi adhik samay se chali aa rahi newtoneey kriyavidhiyon dwaara banaae gaye bahut saral niyamon, jo shakti or gati kii vyakhya ke liye prayog kiye jate the, ko chunauti di
 Kuhn wrote in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, "the gradual change from one conversion to another through revolution is the way of normal development of mature science
 " kuhn kaa swayan kaa vichaar us samay krantikari tha, kyonki usase shikshavidon ke vigyaan ke bare main baat karne ke tareeke main ek bada parivartan aayaa
 In this way, it can be argued that this led to a "revolutionary change" in the history and social sciences of science or was itself a part of it
 lekin kuhn ne aise kisi krantikari badlaav ko nahin pahachaanaa
 saamaajik vigyaan main hone ke kaaran, log abhi bhi praarambhik vichaaron kaa prayog vigyaan ke itihaas par vaartalap karte samay karte hai
 Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn, eventually accepted the modified form of Kuhn's model, synthesizing his original idea with his earlier gradualist model
 kuhn ke mul model ko ab saamanytah bahut simit mana jaataa he
 Some of the "ideal cases" of some revolutionary changes in science are: kuhn ke anusaar, ekmaatr haaavee roopantaran kaa hona vigyaanon kaa gun hota he, jabaki darshanashastra or saamaajik vigyaan ke adhikansh bhaag main “mul siddhanton par daawey, pratidaave or bahes kii parampara” dekhi jaati he
 Others have applied Kuhn's theory of revolutionary change to social science
 1990 ke dashak ke uttarardh main, krantikari badlaav ek mul mantra sa ban gaya, jo vyapaarik bolchaal main lokapriy ho gaya or prakashnon or lekhon main anek baar aane laga
 Writer Larry Trask, in his book, Mind the Gaffe, has advised readers not to use the term and be careful while reading anything containing this sentence
 Many articles and books refer to its misuse and overuse to the extent of being meaningless
 "krantikari badlaav ” shabd kaa prayog kai anya sandarbhon main bhi kiya gaya he, jisamen yah kisi vishesh vichaardhaara main hue bade parivartan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he – vyaktigat manyataon, jatil pranaaliyon yaa sanghathanon main mul parivartan, jisamen pehle ke sochane yaa sanghathan ke tareekon ke sthaan par moulik rup se bhinn sochane yaa sanghathan ke tareeke ko prayog main laayaa gaya ho

 Most of these warriors are sent to schools only when they are seven years old, where they are taught many tricks of agility and skill; There they teach them to dance, turn and take different kinds of curves on the ground, take royal leaps, other other types of jumps and by the time they are children, they learn it twice a day, thus they are so relaxed The joints become so flexible that their body is able to bend against nature; And when they become fully accustomed to it, they teach them to wield the weapons that they are most interested in, some with arrows and bows, some with sticks and spears - with sticks, But most continue to practice within these limits, with swords and shields

 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai
 Sometimes his procession is also taken out and always try to walk accordingly

 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc
 The entire religious life of the Sikhs is influenced by the book

 In English, it is called the harmonic category, which was conceptualized by the melody of music
 ek kampansheel tantu se nikalne waal adhiswarak 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4, aadi, tantu kii moolbhoot tarangadairghy hai
 Each term in the category after the first term is the harmonic mean of the posts that pass
 chaudavin shatabdi main nichol oresm nen yah siddh kiya ki haraatmak shrenee apsaari hoti he lekin yah parinaam kisi ne nahin dekhe
 Petro Mogul, Johann Bernoulli and Jacob Bernoulli derive it in the 17th century
 aitihaasik drushti se haraatmak anukram ko vaastukaron main kuch prasiddhi mili
 This occurred especially in the Baroque period when architects used to establish the balance between elevation and roof leveling and established a harmonious relationship between external and internal art in churches and palaces
 prathamdrishtya yah shrenee sahaj nahin lagati kyonki yah ek apsaari shrenee he balki iskaa n vaan pad jab n anant kii ore agrasar he, shunya kii ore agrasar hota he
 The harmonic category divergence is a clear example of paradox
 iskaa ek udhaaharan rabar ke phite par keedaa he
 Suppose a worm moves at a slow speed on a rubber tape of one meter long, after every one minute the rubber lace becomes long by drawing a meter uniformly
 yadi keedaa ek semi prati minute kii dar se rengta he, kya keedaa feete ke duusare sire par kabhi nahin pahungaa paayegaa? lekin uttar ekadam viparit "haan" hoga, n minute pashchaat keede dwaara tay duuri or feete kii kul lambaai kaa anupaat nimna hoga: Because the value of the range increases voluntarily as the value of n increases, this ratio must also be greater than one, which proves that the worm will reach the end of the tape
 yah ghatana ghatit hone main lagane vaala samay arthath n kaa maan adhik ho saktaa he, tathaapi, lagbhag e100 athwa 1040 se bhi adhik
 Although the harmonic range is divergent, it is so slow
 haraatmak shrenee ke apsaari hone ke anek parinaam uplabddh hai jinamein se do yahan die gaye hai
 The first way to prove it to be divergent is to compare it with any other divergent category
 haraatmak shrenee kaa prayek pad isse tulana kii gai shrenee ke prayek pad se bada athwa baraabar he atah haraatmak shrenee kaa sankalan bhi dwitiya shrenee ke yoga se adhik hoga
 Although the sum total of the second class is infinite: isse siddh hota he ki haraatmak shrenee kaa yoga bhi anant hona chahie
 In other words, the above comparison proves that jahaan k ek dhanatmak purnank he
 It is possible to prove that the compilation of the harmonic series results in divergence when compared to the infinite integral of its comparative range
 vishesh rup se, mana chitra main pradarshit aayaton main pradarshit tarkon ko sahi hai
 The width of each rectangle is one unit and the height is 1 / n unit, so the total area of all rectangles will be equal to the total sum of the harmonic series: yaddapi, vakr y= 1 / x ke neeche 1 se anant tak kaa kshetrafal nimna prakaar he: Since this area is completely inside the rectangle, so haraatmak shrenee bahut mand rup se apsaari he
 For example, the sum of its first 1043 terms is less than 100
