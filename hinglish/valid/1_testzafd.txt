tulanaatmak sahitya vivechan main saahitiyon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan ke saadhan rup main anuwaad ke prayog ke dwaara sadrush-visadrush anshon kaa arthbodh hota he, jisase anshon kii tulana kii ja sake
 Apart from this, practicing translation of works of other language literature or / and reading them in translated form is an example of the contribution of translation in comparative literature discussion
 saadhy rup main anuwaad vyapaar anek kshetron main dikhaai padataa he
 Koshkarya is also a kind of translation work
 sambhashik kosh main ek hi bhashaa ke andar anuwaad hota he or dwibhashi kosh main do bhashaaon ke madhya
 This translation takes place on the dimension of language rather than text, affecting two levels of language analysis
 ve do str - shabd or shabd shrunkhla hai
 Similarly, translation-trade is also taken for the development of a language
 jab kisi bhashaa ko aise vyavhaar-kshetron main kaam karne kaa avasar miltaa he, jinamein pehle uskaa prayog nahin hota tha, tab use vishaywastu or abhivyakti paddati donon hi drushtiyon se viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this, various types of literature from other languages are translated into it
 falswaroop, vishaywastu kii paridhi ke vistaar ke saath-saath bhashaa ke abhivyakti-kosh kaa kshetra bhi vistrut hota he
 Many new words are formed, sometimes the prevailing words get new meaning, new synergies start to develop, hybrid-vocabulary is used, and due to the characteristic of the context of language use, a new distinction of language overall gets up
 aadhunik prashasnic hindi tathaa patrakarita hindi iske achche udhaaharan hai
 This process is called language planning and language development, which is part of the socio-economic development of the nation in its wider context
 is prakaar anuwaad ke madhyam se vikasshil bhashaa main aavashyak or mahatvapurn sahitya kaa pravesh hota he
 One can then say that translation in this form also contributes to national development
 apane vyapkatam rup main anuwaad bhashaa kii shakti main sanvardhan karata he, paathon kii vyakhya evam nirvachan main sahaayak he, bhashaa tathaa vichaar ke bich sambandh ko spasht karata he, gyaan kaa prasar karata he, samskruti kaa samvahak he, tathaa rashtron ke madhye paraspar avgaman or sadbhaav kii vruddhi main yogadan karata he
 In Goethe's words, translation is necessary and important, even if impossible
 anuwaad ke swaroop ke do ullekhneey paksh hai - samanvay or santulan
 The multidisciplinary dimension of translation theory is its coordinating aspect
 tadnusaar, yadhyapi anuwaad siddhanth kaa mul udgam he anuprayukt tulanaatmak pathaceketvigyaan, tathaapi use kuch anya shaastra bhi sparsh karte hai
 It is clear that the translation of 'comparative' is related to two languages, in which questions of equality and inequality of languages are present
 pathasanketavigyaan ke teenon paksh - arthvichaar, vaakyavichaar tathaa sandarbhamimasaa - anuwaad siddhanth ke liye praasangik hai
 In economics, there is a study of the relation between linguistic signs and linguistic reality
 sandarbhamimasaa ke antargat bhashaprayog kii sthiti ke sandarbh ke vibhinn ayaamon - vaktaa evam shrota kii saamaajik pahchaan, bhashaprayog kaa uddeshy tathaa sandesh ke prati vaktaa - shrota kii abhivritti, bhashaprayog kii bhautik paristhitiyon kii tathaa abhivyakti, madhyam aadi - kii mimasaa hoti he
 It is clear that the periphery of signology is wider than that of linguistics and broad communication such as translation work is suitable for the study of business
 anuwaad siddhanth ko sparsh karne vaale shastron main he sampreshan siddhanth jisaki manyataon ke anusaar anuwaad kaary ek sampreshan vyapaar he, tathaa tadnusaar us par ve sabhi baaten lagu hoti hai, jo sampreshan vyapaar kii prakruti main hai, jaise sampreshan kaa shatpratishat yathatath na hona, apurnataa, udriktata, aanshik kritrimata aadi
 From this, in place of word-per-word and meaning-per-meaning similarity in translation work, message-like similarity can also be justified
 sankriyaatmak drushti se ek paath yaa prokti anuwaad kaary kaa pravartan bindu hota he
 a text has its own structure, it can be tested by the concepts of linguistic co-operation and conceptual relevance
 iske atirikt ek paath ko bhashaprakayon kii akibhoot samshti ke rup main dekhte hue, usamen bhashaa-prayog shailion ke bhashaprakaryamulak vitaran ke vishay main adhik nishchit jaankaree praapt hoti hai
 Related to this is Sastra, Sociology and stylology, in which information about the distribution of styles of contextual linguistics along with the study of social dialects and applications is desirable for translation theory
 bhashaa se samandhit hone ke kaaran tarkshastra tathaa bhashadarshan bhi anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht karte hai
 According to logic, Satyamulya's examination of the translated text is the basis for purifying the correctness of the translation
 bhashadarshan main hone vaale arth sambandhi chintan se anuwaad kaary main arth ke antaran yaa uski punrariti se sambandhit samasyaon ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Wittgenstein's belief is the 'use' of the word in the language
 anuwaad siddhanth ke liye is kaaran se vishesh praasangik he ki paath hi anuwaad kaary kii ikai he, jiskaa safal arthbodh anuwaad kii pehali aavashyaktaa he
 Thus, searching for the origin of meaning, linguistic meaning and linguistic position are essential parts of translation theory in the speech of the speaker
 arth ke antaran main jahaan uparyukt manyataon kii ek bhoomika he, vahaan arthgat dwibhashik samanta ke nirdhaaran main ghatakeey vishleshan kii paddati kii vishesh upyogita sweekaar kii gai he
 It is specially taken into consideration that where the nature of translation theory is formed from the relevant beliefs of various scriptures, translation theory itself is a special part of those scriptures
 anuwaad siddhanth kaa 'saamaanya' paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi, or yah iskaa santulansheel swaroop he - saamaanya or vishisht kaa santulan
 According to the definition of translation, it is said that translation is practically at the level of specific linguistics and therefore theoretically at the level of common language - a distinction of English language journalism from English to Hindi language in Hindi of journalism
 tadnusaar, yugapad rup se anuwaad siddhanth kaa ek saamaanya paksh bhi he or vishisht paksh bhi
 What we say at the level of general, in practice, cites the specific level of linguistics
 'yathasambhav adhiktam paath prakaaron ke liye ek upyukt tathaa saamaanya anuwaad pranali kaa nirdhaaran' ye anuwaad ke kshetra sambandhit ek vichaarneey prashn mana jaataa he
 In relation to the determination of the system one has to consider the nature of the translation process, the different types of translation, the formulas for translation and the format for determining instructions for translation of different categories of texts, etc
 anuwaad kaa mukhya uddeshy, anuwaad kii ikai, anuwaad kaa kala-kaushal-vigyaan kaa swaroop, anuwaad kaary kii seemayen, aadi kuch anya vishay hai, jin par vichaar apekshit hota he
 The main language of translation work is the original language text
 isaki sanrachana, iskaa prakaar, bhashaprakarya praaroop ke anusaar mulpath kaa swaroop nirdhaaran, aadi ke saath shabdaarth-vyavastha evam vyakaranik sanrachana ke vishleshnatmak bodhan ke vibhinn praaroop, unki shaktiyon or simaaon kaa akalan, aadi ke sambandh main saiddhanthik charchaa tathaa inke sankriyaatmak dhaanche kaa nirdhaaran, iske antargat aane vaale mukhya bindu hai
 Some minor points are also discussed under the translation principle - which system should be adopted for translation of metaphors, proper nouns, terminology, initials, geographical names, trade names, names of business establishments, cultural words, etc
 ; What should be the form of translation system for literary works, scientific and technological writing, publicity literature, etc
 isi se sambandhit ek mahatvapurn bindu he, anuwaad kii vibhinn yuktiyaan - lipyantaran, shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad, shabdanugami anuwaad, aagat anuwaad, vyakhya, vistaran, sankshepan, saanskrithik paryaay, swabhaasheekaran aadi
 Ultimately, only one person does the work of translation
 ekaaki anuwaad main to anuvadak akelaa hota hi he, sahyogaatmak anuwaad main bhi, antim avadhi main, sampaadan kaa kaary anuvadak ko akele karnaa hota he
 Therefore, many responsibilities are attached to the translator and there are many expectations from him in the successful execution of the work
 bhashaa gyaan, vishay gyaan, abhivyakti kaushal, vyaktigat gun aadi kii drushti se anuvadak se hone vaali apekshaaon par vichaar karnaa hota he
 Translation education and translation review are two other important points
 anuwaad kii shiksha bhashaa-adhigam ke, vishesh rup se anya bhashaa adhigam ke, saadhan ke rup main di ja sakati he 
 In this, translation is subject to teaching, language-teaching and is planned in an intermediate short-term course, in which the steps and goals of teaching are clear and definite
 isamen shikshaarthi kaa lakshya bhashaa siikhnaa he, anuwaad karnaa nahin
 In the second phase of education, translation is practiced to learn translation as a craft or skill whose advanced stage is specified in the terminology of 'translation is art'
 is sthiti main jo bhashaa anuvadak kii apni nahin, uske adhigam ko bhi aanushangik rup main pusht karata jaataa he
 As practice material, lessons have to be followed according to the variety of text types and the amount of difficulty
 yadi ek sajaateey / vijaateey, swedashi yaa videshi bhashaa ko seekhney kii yojana main usase yaa usamen anuwaad karne kii kshamta ko viksit karnaa ek uddeshy ho to anuwaad-shikshan ke donon sopanon - sadhanparak tathaa sadhyaparak – ko anustarit rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Translation review is a part of the translation theory, which is behaved in a relaxed manner, even by a general reader of translated works, but who have a sufficiently clear theoretical background
 siddhantapusht anuwaad samiksha ek gyanatmak vyapaar he
 It reviews one or more translations of an original text, and the translation is evaluated by comparison of the original or by different comparisons of different translations of the original
 iske teen sopan hai - mulbhasha paath tathaa lakshyabhasha paath kaa vishleshan, donon kii tulana, or ant main lakshyabhashagat vishuddhta, upyuktata or swaabhaaviktaa kii drushti se anuwaad kaa moolyankan
 Various testing techniques are used to test the success of the translation on the step of the evaluation
 anuwaad ko kala or vigyaan donon hi roopon main swikaarne kii maansikta isi kaaran pallavit hui he ki sansarbhar kii bhashaaon ke parsparik anuwaad kii koshish anuwaad kii anek shaileyon or pravidhiyon kii ore ishaara karti hai
 One of the problems of translation is that a translation should be presented on the basis of literary genre
 yadi kisi naatak kaa naatak ke rup main hi anuwaad kiya jaae to aise anuwaadon main anuvadak kii apni sarjanaatmak pratibha kaa vaishishty bhi apekshit hota he
 a basis of translation is also dependent on the translation being prose or verse
 aisa paaya jaataa he ki adhikanshtah gadhy kaa anuwaad gadhy main athwa padya main hi upasthit ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi yah kram badla hua najar aata he
 The poetry of many prose works is found, while the translations of many poems are also available
 anuwaadon ko vishay ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya jaataa he or kai staron par anuwaad kii prakruti ke anuroop use mul-kendrit or mulmukt do virgon main bhi baanta gaya he
 Among the meaningful and prevalent practices of translation, which have been mentioned by the translation scientists, the most acceptance of concordance, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, paraphrasing, interpreting, transliteration and conversion has been accepted
 strotbhasha ke prayek shabd kaa lakshyabhasha ke prayek shabd main yathavat anuvaadan ko shabdanuwaad kehete hai
 Verbatism based on 'maिकािकाika sthana maक्षिकाika' is actually the most inferior category of translation
 prayek bhashaa kii prakruti anya bhashaa se bhinn hoti he or har bhashaa main shabd ke anekanek arth vidyaman rahete hai
 That is why every phrase of the original language cannot be translated into the target language in the same way
 kai baar aise shabdanuvaadon ke kaaran badi haasyaaspad sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Translations made from Sanskrit to Hindi are sometimes tolerated due to the similarity of nature, but in the translation from European family languages, defects of meaning and hierarchy are commonly seen
 vastav main yadi strot or lakshyabhasha main arth, prayog, vaakya-vinyas or style kii samanta ho, tabhi shabdanuwaad sahi hota he, anyathaa yantrawat kiye gaye shabdanuwaad abodhgamy, haasyaaspad evam kritrim ho jate hai
 In such translators, the translation focuses its attention on the content or expression of the original language, regardless of the source language's words, phrase and syntax
 aise anuwaadon main strotbhasha kii bhav-saamagree ko upasthit karnaa hi anuvadak kaa lakshya hota he
 In the process of paraphrasing, sometimes the original splendor of the original form comes, but sometimes readers complain that the translator has presented the sense content according to the nature of the target language, without understanding the language of the original language
 jab pathak kisi rachana ko rachanaakaar ke abhivyakti-kaushal kii dashshti se padhanaa chahta he, to bhavanuaad uski lakshyasiddhi main sahaayak nahin hota
 In Sanskrit plays, there are frequent experiments that the Sanskrit shadow of the Prakrit language used by their women and servants, maids, etc
, also exists in the drama
 aise hi prayogon se chhayanuwaad kaa udbhav hua he
 Under the method of translation, the translator does not follow only the original words as in concordance, and not only follows the expressions, but also presents the subject in the target language in its shadow, completely bound to the original language
 is anuwaad main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa sankshipt or atisankshipt anuwaad lakshyabhasha main kiya jaataa he
 This method is helpful in presenting translations of long speeches and debates
 aise anuwaadon main mulbhasha kii saamagree kaa lakshyabhasha main vyakhya sahit anuwaad upasthit kiya jaataa he
 In this, the translator interprets the contents of the original language with the requisite evidence and examples etc
, according to his study and approach
 lokmaanya tilak ne ’gita‘ kaa anuwaad is style main kiya he
 Many Sanskrit commentators and Hindi commentators have followed the genre of lectures
 swabhaavatah vyakhyanuwaad athwa bhashyanuwaad mul se bahut bada ho jaataa he or kai staron par to ekadam moulik ban jaataa he
 Where translation works in the role of interpreter, he is only able to translate
 do duurastha deshon ke bhinn bhashaa-bhashi jab aapas main baaten karte hai, to unke bich dubhashiya samvaad kaa madhyam banataa he
 On such occasions, the translation breaks the boundaries of words and expressions, based on the translator's ability to translate
 uske paas itnaa samay nahin hota he ki shabd ke sahi bhashaayi paryaay ke bare main soche athwa koshon kii sahaayta le sake
 Sometimes, due to the misinterpretation of such interpreters, a situation of tension is also created in two countries
 ashyanuwaad hi ab bhashaantaran ke rup main charchit he
 In this context of translation, the translator does not only translate words and expressions from the original language to the target language, but completely transforms the original composition according to his talent and convenience
 wiliam shakespeare ke prasiddh naatak 'marchent of venice' kaa anuwaad bharatendu harishchandr ne 'durlabh bandhu' arthath 'vanspur kaa mahajan' naam se kiya he jo roopantaran ke anuwaad kaa anyatam udhaaharan he
 Names like Antonio, Basolio, Porschea, Shylock of the original play have been adapted by Bharatendu like Anant, Basant, Purshree, Shailaksha respectively
 aise roopantaran main anuwaad kii moulikta sabase adhik ubharkar saamne aati he
 These interpretations of the translator suggest that many styles and methods of translation have been adopted in languages across the world, but if the translator meticulously touches the soul of the word and emotion, it is the ideal to translate the target language in accordance with the nature of the native language
 Will translate
 isiilie shreshth anuvadak ko aisa kushal chikitsak kaha jaataa he, jo bottle main rakhi dawa ko apni syringe ke dwaara rogi ke sharir main yathaavat pahunchaa detaa he
 Translation theory is not an independent, independent, theory in itself, nor is it a 'science' in the sense in which mathematics, philology, sociology, etc
 are
 isaki aisi koi vishisht adhyayan saamagree tathaa adhyayan pranali bhi nahin, jo anya shastron kii adhyayan saamagree tathaa pranali se is rup main bhinn ho ki, iskaa multah swatantra vyaktitv ban sake
 In fact, it is a body of cognitive information related to various issues of translation, which helps in understanding translation as a process, a conclusion, and a relation
 iske liye sadyah 'anuwaad vidya, 'anuwaad vigyaan', or 'anuvaadiki' shabd bhi prachlit hai
 Translation is a process related to linguistics, which has a definite culmination and as a result of which there is a relation of equality in terms of origin and 'value'
 is prakaar prakriya, nishpatti, or sambandh kii sanghatit ikai ke rup main anuwaad sambandhi saamaanya prakruti kii jaankaree hi anuwaad siddhanth he, jo multah ekanvit na hote hue bhi sangrahaniya, rochak, gyanavardhak, tathaa ek seemaa tak vaastavik anuwaad kaary ke liye upadey he
 In its present stage of development, it has become a multi-disciplinary discipline
 jiskaa gyaan praapt karnaa swayamev ek lakshya he tathaa jo jigyaasu pathak ke liye bauddhik santosh kaa strot he
 While assessing the usefulness of translation theory in translation work, the occasional fact is taken into account that in the present day translation has become an organized profession, in which trainees are more motivated by occupational-social need than by personal interest
 vishesh rup se aise logon ke liye tathaa saamaanya rup se ruchishil anuvaadakon ke liye anuwaad kaary main dakshata viksit karne main anuwaad siddhanth ke yogadan ko nirupit kiya jaataa he 
 The theoretical justification of this contribution is also from the point of view that translation work is secondary, because it is creative
 ise 'sarjanaatmak-samikshatmak' bhi kaha jaataa he 
 In order to clarify and confirm the creativeness, the critical comments that are made in the translator are derived from the knowledge of translation theory
 anuwaad kii vishuddhta kii nishpatti main siddhanth gyaan kaa yogadan rahata he 
 Also, knowledge of the translation process can help him work more carefully in synonym selection
 isse adhik mahatvaparn baat maani jaati he ki vah moorkhtapurna trutiyaan karne se batch saktaa he 
 The knowledge of translation theory also helps the translator in developing the watchful vision required so that no part of the text, linguistic, thematic, and cultural significance is left out of translation
 isi prashn ko duusare chor se bhi dekha jaataa he 
 It is said that those who can write original, they write, those who cannot write translate, and those who cannot translate, they discuss about translation
 vastutah in teenon main paripurakta he - ye teenon kuch bhinn-bhinn hai – tathaapi yah mana jaataa he ki anuwaad vishyak charchaa ko adhik pramanik tathaa vishad banane main anuwaad siddhanth ke vidhyaarthee ko anuwaad kaary sambandhi anubhav sahaayak hota he 
 It is such that literature reviewers familiar at the level of prolific experience can present their critical responses more convincingly
 anuwaad siddhanth ke vartmaan swaroop ko dekhte hue iske vikaas kon vihang-drishy se do charnon main vibhakt karke dekha jaataa he : The era before the development of modern linguistics, especially applied linguistics, the early twentieth century; iske pashchaat kaa yug-beesvin sadi uttarardh 
 It is commonly said that the subject of controversy in different epochs of doctrine development and in the same different streams, whether the translation was verbatim or semantic, though the 'language' of the controversy kept changing
 isapurv pratham shatabdi main roman yug se armbh hota he, jab horence tathaa siciro ne shabdanugami tathaa arthanugami anuwaad main antar spasht kiya tathaa saahitiyik rachanaaon ke liye arthanugami anuwaad ko pradhanta di 
 Cicero described a good translator as an interpreter and expert in learning
 roman yug ke pashchaat, jisamen saahitiyik anuwaadon kii pradhanta thi, duusari shaktishaalee dhara bible anuwaad kii he 
 Saint Jerome also prioritized the meaning of meaning in the translation of the Bible and supported the use of the language of day-to-day behavior in translation
 isamen vichaar yah tha ki, bible kaa sandesh jansadharan paryant pahunch jaae or iske nimitt jansadharan ke liye bodhgamy bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaae, jisamen swabhaavatah arthanugami drushtikon ko pradhanta mili 
 John Wycliffe and William Tindl supported this trend
 bodhgamy tathaa sundar bhashaa main, tathaa style evam arth ke madhya samanjasy kii raksha karte hue, bible ke anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila, jisamen martin luther kaa yogadan ullekhneey rahaa
 The third section has been related to the contribution of translation in education
 quitillian ne anuwaad tathaa sambhaashi vyaakhyaatmak shabdaantaran kii upyogita ko lekhan abhyaas tathaa bhaashan-dakshata viksit karne ke sandarbh main dekha
 Which spread more in medieval Europe
 isse sthaneey bhashaaon kaa str upar uthaa tathaa unki abhivyakti samarthy main vruddhi bhi hui 
 The trend of translation from rich and developed languages to developing languages is a major trend of the literary world of medieval Europe, which is called the trend of the upward dimension and the trend of the translation of the whole dimension of the equally developed or underdeveloped languages prevailing at the same time
 Viewed as
 madhyakaalin europe ke aarmabhik siddhantakaaron main french vidwaan i0 dolet ne 1540 main prakashit nibandh main anuwaad ke paanch vidhi-nishedh prastaavit kiye : The translator has complete knowledge of the language of the original author, but he can remove the ambiguity and ambiguity of the original language if he wishes
 anuvadak kaa mulbhasha or lakshyabhasha kaa purna gyaan ho; Translators avoid word-per-word translation; anuvadak dainandin ke vyavhaar kii bhashaa kaa prayog kare; The translator should do such wordings and terminology so that proper effect is concluded
 george chapman ne bhi isi prakaar 'elliod' ke sandarbh main anuwaad ke teen sutara prastaavit kiye : Word-per-word translation should be avoided; mul kii bhaavana paryant pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya jaae; The translation should not be too relaxed due to the touch of scholarship
 europe ke punarjagran yug main anuwaad kii dhara ek gaun pravriti rahi 
 The translators of this era see the tendency to protect the interest of the reader with the primacy of meaning
 holland ke anuwaad main mulpath ke arth main parivartan-parivardhan dwaara anudit paath ke sanskaar kii jhalak dikhti he 
 In the seventeenth century in England, Sir John Denham opposed the tendency to be wordy in the translation of the poem and asserted the central element of the original text and reintroduced it into the target language; He came to be called 'anusarajan'
 is avidh main jaan dryden ne mahatvaparn vichaar prakat kiye
 He defined three categories of translation work: shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad ; Meaningful translation, anukaran 
 According to Dryden, the route between and is acceptable
 unke anusaar kavita ke anuwaad main anuvadak ko donon bhashaaon par adhikaar ho, use mul lekhak ke saahitiyik gunon or uski 'bhaavana' kaa gyaan ho, tathaa vah apane samay ke saahitiyik aadarshon kaa paalan kare
 Alexander Pope also expressed similar views as Dideon
 atharahavin shatabdi main anuwaad kii atimulanishthata tathaa athiswatantrata ke vivaad se ek sopan aage badhkar ek samasya thi ki apane samakaleen pathak ke prati anuvadak kaa kartavya 
 Due to excessive inclination towards the reader, the form of the translated text used to be far away from the original text
 is par dow
 samuel janson ne kaha ki, anuwaad main mulpath kii apeksha parivardhan ke kaaran utpann parishkruti kaa swaagat kiya ja saktaa he, parantu mulpath kii haani na ho ye dhyaan dena chaiye
 He also said that just as the writer writes for his contemporary reader, the translator also translates for his contemporary reader
 dow
 janson kii sammati main anuwaad kii mulanishthata tathaa pathakdharmita main santulan miltaa he 
 He called the translator such a painter or follower who, despite being loyal to the original, takes care of the interests of the intended audience
 eleggender frager titaler jinaki pustak principles aaf transleshan anuwaad siddhanth par pehali vyavasthit pustak maani jaati he 
 Tittler proposed three translation formulas: anuwaad main mul rachana ke bhav kaa puraa anurakshan ho; The style of translation should be consistent with the original; anuwaad main mul vaali subodhta ho
 It is said by Tittler that, in translation, the feeling of the original should be so thoroughly solicited that after reading it, the readers get as intense feeling as the original readers had; This is the principle of efficacy
 unnisvin shatabdi main romantic tathaa uttar-romantic yugon main anuwaad chintan par tatkaaleen kavychintan kaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he 
 A
W
 Schlegel called all kinds of oral and written language practice translation, and emphasized on preserving the formation of the original
 is yug main ek ore to anuvadak ko sarjanaatmak lekhak ke tulya samajhane kii pravriti dikhaai detii he, to duusari ore anuwaad ko shabdanugami banane par bal dene kii baat kahi gai 
 Some scholars have discussed translation as having a different dialect that matches the above beliefs
 victorian dhara ke anuvadak is baat ke liye prayatnsheel rahe ki desh or kaal kii duuri ko anuwaad main surakshit rakhaa jaae – videshi bhashaaon kii pracheen rachanaaon ke anuwaad main videshiyata or pracheenta kii haani na ho - jiske falswaroop shabdanugami anuwaad kii pravriti ko protsaahan mila 
 Longfellow was its supporter
 parantu umr khaiyam kii rubaayiyon ke anuvadak fitjerald ke vichaar iske vipareet the 
 He was a supporter of the belief that instead of bringing the reader of the translation closer to the original language text, the cultural features of the original language text should be presented in the target language in such a way that it appears to be the live property of the target language, and in the process the native language The increased distance from translation should be ignored
 beesvin sadi ke purvardh main do-teen anuwaad chintak ullekhneey hai 
 Kroche and Velary have expressed doubts in the success of the translation, particularly the success of the translation of the poem
 mathew ornald ne homer kii kritiyon ke anuwaad main saral, pratyaksh or udaatt style ko apnaane par bal diya
 Thus in the period before the rise of modern linguistics, translation thinking often revolved around two opposing beliefs
 wo do manyataayen is prakaar hai - The translation should be verbose or free anuwaad apni aantarik prakruti kii drushti se asambhav he, parantu saamaajik drushti se nitant aavashyak 
 Overall the balance of phenomenological and discriminatory views is seen in the translation thought of this period - from the perspective of translation, it means a form of translation theory which is of general order, and in the differential view, necessary in the system of translation based on the natural variation of the texts
 Discussion of change has its implications
 vidwaanon ne is avadhi main amoort chintan to kiya parantu ve anuwaad pranali kaa sodaaharan pallavan nahin kar paae 
 With the insightful understanding of the text, they moved towards the goal of analytical comprehension, but there was no definite theory behind it
 aise chintakon main anuvaadakon ke atirikt sahityakar tathaa sahitya-sameekshak hi adhik the, bhashavigyaani nahin 
 In addition, they did not seem to be familiar with each other's thoughts
 aadhunik bhashavigyaan kaa udai yadhyapi beesvin shatabdi ke purvardh main hua, parantu anuwaad siddhanth kii praasangikta kii drushti se uttarardh kii avadhi kaa mahatva he 
 During this period, the attention of translators and linguists familiar with linguistics attracted attention to translation theory
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa vikaas, arthvigyaan kii pragati, sampreshan siddhanth tathaa bhashavigyaan kaa samanvay, tathaa anuprayukt bhashavigyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon - samajabhashavigyaan, shailivigyaan, manobhashavigyaan, prokti vishleshan - kaa vikaas, tathaa sanketvigyaan, visheshtah paath sanketavigyaan, kaa udai aisi ghatnaayen maani jaati hai, jo anuwaad siddhanth ko pusht tathaa viksit karne kii drushti se mahatvapurn maani jaati rahi
 a scholar Eugen Nida is also considered in the anglo-american stream
 unhone bible-anuwaad ke anubhav ke aadhaar par anuwaad siddhanth or vyavhaar par apane vichaar granthon ke rup main prakat kiye 
 In these, a detailed, detailed and logical form of translation theory can be seen
 naida ne anuwaad prakriya kaa vivaran dete hue mulbhasha paath ke vishleshan ke liye ek sunishchit bhashasiddhanth prastut kiya tathaa lakshyabhasha main sashakrant sandesh ke punargathan ke vibhinn aayam nirdhaarit kiye
 He gave a description of the multidimensional adjustments between the two languages related to the status of translation
 anya vidvan catford hai, jinke anuwaad siddhanth main sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke anuprayog kaa udhaaharan miltaa he 
 He determined the format of translation on a purely linguistic basis, gave a linguistic description of translation-transitions, and considered the limits of translation
 tisare prabhaavshaalee vidvan peter neumark hai jinhone sugathit or ghanishtha style main anuwaad siddhanth kaa tarksangat tathaa gahan vivechan prastut karne kaa prayaas kiya

 ab teenon divangat hai
 When Devaki Nandan Khatri, the father of Aiyari and Tilasmi novels in Hindi, appeared in Hindi along with Chandrakanta, it was usually during that period that Ambika Dutt Vyas's wonder wonder-story also created a new array of science fiction writing in Hindi
 ‘piyus pravaah’ patrika main 1884-88 ke madhya dharawahik rup se iskaa prakaashan ho chukaa tha
 The 'wonder story' was purely a science fiction, completely free from mischievous and espionage influences
 udhar bangla bhashaa main "panch kaudi de" jab jasusi sahitya- ‘ghatana-ghatatope’, ‘jai-paraajay’, ‘jivan rahasy’, ‘nil vasana sundari’, ‘mayavi’, ‘-ke nirmaan main pravrutt the to usee kaal main vigyaan kathaayen bhi likhi ja rahi thi, balki kahana yah chahie ki bangala main vigyaan galp kaa unmesh isse purv ho chukaa tha
 Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, an analyst of life in plants and inventor of wireless, wrote the first Bengali science fiction titled 'storm over Victory' in 1897 itself
 anadidhan binraji ne ‘van kusum’, ‘champa phool’, ‘chor’ jaise upanyaason ke saath saath ‘mangal grah’ jaisaa vigyaan galp bhi prastut kiya
 In Marathi, Sridhar Balakrishna Ranade wrote the first science fiction titled 'tareche Humor' in 1915
 praayah isi samay nath madhav ne ‘shrinivas raav’ naamak vaigyanik upanyaas marathi main prastut kiya
 The Hindu readership of Devaki Nandan Khatri created in the backdrop of the Aranyas of Mirzapur, the Hindi readers were astonished and bewildered and he took Khatri ji hands
 khanni pranit ‘narendramohini’ ‘virendra vir’, ‘chandrakanta santati’, ‘kusum kumari’, ‘naulakha haar’, ‘guptagodana’ 
 ‘kaagaj kii kothri’ ‘anuthi begum’, ‘bhootnath’ ne lokapriyata kii sari hadein paar kar leen
 The magic of Indrajal of Devaki Nandan Khatri started to speak on the head of the readers
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne ‘hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ main likhaa he ki khatri ke tilsmi sahitya kaa anand lene ke liye urdubhashiyon ne hindi sikhi
 It was like Khatri's dark world! pathak hi kya, samakaleen lekhak bhi is jaadu ke mohpash main aabaddh hue bina na rah sake
 Then meaningful efforts to create Tilasmi literature started and such things started coming out in a surprising amount and the Hindi readers got wet in it
 is kaal khand main aise lekhakon kii samrudh parampara dikhaai padati he
 Devi Prasad Upadhyay's 'maya-vilas', Jagannath Chaturvedi's 'vasant-malati', Hare Krishna Johar's 'kusum Lata', 'terrible Love', Saraswati Gupta's 'rajkumar', Bal Mukunda Varma's 'kamini', Rajendra Mohini , Hare Krishna Johar Kriti 'vampire', 'manayak-mohini', 'magician' and 'kamal Kumari', Madan Mohan Pathak Kriti 'anand Sundari', Munni Lal Khanni Krita Bahadur ', Hare Krishna Johar Krita' Nirala Masked 'and' terrible blood ', that Rori Lal Goswami wrote 'two-piece of cut mud', Vishweshwar Prasad Varma, 'virendra Kumar', Kishori Lal Goswami, 'yakuti Takhti', Ram Lal Varma's 'putlimahal', Roop Kishore Jain's 'surya Kumar Sambhav' Etc
 are representative works of this literature
 aage bhi yah parampara chalati rahi lekin yaheen se tilsmi sahitya kaa praayah avsaan mana janaa chahie
 It is also a strange coincidence that along with Tilasmi literature, there was a sudden flood of espionage and readers were appreciated and adopted
 hindi main jasusi upanyaason ke prenta gopal ram gahamri hai
 After a brief period of 'chandrakanta' and 'narendra Mohini' of Devaki Nandan Khatri, 'awesome Corpse' and 'detective' also emerged together
 in jasusi upanyaason kii badhati lokapriyata se prerit hokar gahamri ne prabhoot maatra main aisa sahitya rachaa-‘bekasoor kii faansee’, ‘sarakati laash’, ‘khooni koun he ?’, ‘begunaah kaa khun’, ‘jamuna kaa khun’, ‘dabl jasoos’, ‘mayavini’, ‘jaaduugarani manorama’ 1901), ‘ladki chori’, ‘jasoos kii bhul’, ‘thana kii chori’, bhanyakar chori’, ‘andhe kii aankh’, ‘jaal raja’, ‘jaali kaaka’, ‘jasoos kii chori,, ‘malgodaam main chori’, ‘daake par daaka’, ‘doctor kii kahani’, ‘ghar kaa bhedi’, ‘jasoos par jasoos’, ‘devi singh’ 
 ‘ladkaa gaayab’, ‘jasoos chakkar main ’, ‘khooni kaa bhed’, ‘bhojpur kii thangi’ 
 ‘balihaari buddhi’, ‘yoga mahima’ or ‘guptbhed’ aadi
 Even contemporary Hindi writers could not keep themselves afloat due to the influence of detective literature, and many such compositions came out during this period
 yatha-rudradutt sharma krit ‘var singh daaroga’, ‘kishori laal goswami krit ‘jinde kii laash’, ‘jairam gupt krit ‘langadaa khooni’, jang bahadur singh krit ‘vicitra khun’ sher singh krit ‘vilakshan jasoos’, ‘chandrashekhar pathak krit ‘amir ali thang’, ‘shashi bala’ or shiv narayan dvivedi krit ‘amar dutt’ aadi
 But this tradition ends here
 kaaran yah ki hindi main yah parampara naveen thi or angl sahitya se purnatah prabhavit
 The reader quickly got bored of it due to not conforming to the Indian environment
 pathakon kii aruchi ne tilsmi, aiyaari or jasusi sahitya kaa achir main hi garbhalopan bhi kar diya
 With the landing of Premchand, the screen was completely transformed
 1917-18 ke aas-paas tilsmi or jasusi sahitya nepathy main chale gayi
 In the thirties of the twentieth century, psychological and phenomenal novels knocked

 rishabhcharan kaa ‘gadar’ hindi upanyaason main ek nayi karavat kaa pratik he
 Vrindavanlal Varma carried this tradition forward
 unhone ‘virata kii padmini’ or ‘gadhn kundar’ jaise aitihaasik upanyaason ke srijan ke liye bundelkhand ke bhukhando, samskruti or vahaan ke veeron ke paraspar vaimnasy, prem-prasangon ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 The 'cane' of Krishna Nand Gupta is also a creation of this category
 bhagwati charan verma ne ‘chitralekha’ main paap or punya kii vishad vyakhya kii
 Premchand's 'durgadas' and Chatur Sen Shastri's 'rana Raj Singh' made aiyari-tilasmi-espionage literature a contradiction, and this tradition ended there
 hindi kii vigyaan kathaon ke bare main likhte samay log praayah keshav prasad singh kii ‘chandralok kii yatra’ kaa pratham vigyaan galp ke rup main ullekh karte hai
 So far there is such a view
 kadaachit iskaa kaaran pan shrinarayan chaturvedi kii vah tippanee he jo unhone ‘saraswati’ patrika ke 60 varsh puure hone ke uplakshya main prakashit ‘hirak jayanti visheshank’ ke kahani khand ke aarambh main di thi
 In Part 1, Number 6, 'saraswati', for the first time, two stories were published simultaneously
 kishori laal goswami kii ‘indumati’ or keshav prasad singh kii ‘chadralok kii yatra’
 Chaturvedi ji comments on these - the second story seems to be written based on an English story
 vah lambii he or dharawahik rup se prakashit hui thi
 'indumati' is the first story of modern style in Hindi, not only in Saraswati
 ’ He made 'chandralok's journey' unimportant by calling it anglo-based, but declared 'indumati' as the first Hindi story
 ‘isse pahile ‘harishchandra chandrika’ or ‘piyush praavah’ main ek-do kahaniyaan chhapi thim
 Stories before Pandit Ambika Dutt Vyas's 'surprise-history' and Pandit Bal Krishna Bhatt's 'nutan Brahmachari' had probably been published before this
 kintu ‘indumati’ ko hi hindi kii pahili aadhunik kahani hone kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 ' sambhawatah kahkar unhone apni baat samaapt kar di lekin yadi isaki padtaal karne kii cheshtaa hi gai hoti to yah vibhram samaapt ho gaya hota ki pratham hindi vigyaan galp koun-sa he ? yadhyapi hindi main yah vimarsh aaj bhi jari he ki hindi kii pehali aadhunik kahani koun si he
 


 'indumati'? Insha Alla Khan's 1803 story of Rani Ketki? Or Pandit Gauri Dutt Praneet 'deorani Jethani Ka Kahani', published in 1870, which is actually a short social novel

 a character from the Ramayana
 yah suketu yaksha kii putree thi jiskaa vivaah sud naamak rakshas ke saath hua tha
 She lived in the beautiful forest near Ayodhya with her husband and two sons Subahu and Marich
 uske sharir main hajaar haathiyon kaa bal tha
 The beautiful forest was named Tadka Forest due to its wrath
 usee van main vishwamitra sahit anek rishi-muni bhi rahete the
 In their chanting, penance and yajna these demon gans always created obstacles
 vishwamitra raja dasharath se anurodh kar ram or lakshmana ko apane saath sundar van laae
 Rama also killed Tadka and Subahu on the day of full sacrifice of Vishwamitra's sacrifice
 marich unke baan se aahat hokar dur dakshin main samudr tat par ja gira
 There was a very powerful Yaksha named Suketu
 uski koi bhi santaan nahin thi
 Therefore, for the purpose of obtaining children, he did harsh penance of Brahma
 uski tapasya se prasann hokar brahma ji ne use santaan hone kaa vardaan de diya or us var ke parinamswaroop tadka kaa janm hua
 Suketu also took the bridesmaid of Brahma from Tadka being very well and Brahma ji gave the strength of a thousand elephants in his body
 vivaah yogya aayu hone par suketu ne tadka kaa vivaah sund naam ke rakshas se kar diya or usase subahu or marich kaa janm hua
 Maricha too was as strong and mighty as her mother
 tadka kaa putr marich sund rakshas se uttapann hokar bhi swayan rakshas nahin tha
 But he was very rowdy in childhood
 rishi muniyon ko akaaran ksht diya karata tha
 Agitated by his nuisances, one day Agastya Muni cursed him to become a demon
 apane putr ke rakshas gati praapt ho jane se sund atyant krodhit ho gaya or agastya rishi ko maarane dauda
 On this, Agastya Rishi cursed and immediately consumed Sunda
 apane pati kii mrityu or putr kii durgati kaa badla lene ke liye tadka agastya rishi par jhapati
 As a result, the sage Agastya cursed and destroyed the beauty of Tadka and she became extremely ugly
 apni kurupata ko dekhakar or apane pati kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye tadka ne agastya muni ke ashram ko nasht karne kaa sankalp kiya
 That is why Rishi Vishwamitra killed Tadka at the hands of Rama

 According to Hindu beliefs, Garuda is the king of birds and the vehicle of Lord Vishnu
 garud kashyap rishi or unki duusari patni vinata kii santaan hai
 Daksha Prajapati had two daughters named Kadru and Vinata
 un donon kaa vivaah kashyap rishi ke saath hua
 From Kashyapa Rishi, Kadru asked for one thousand Naga sons and Vinata had only two stunning sons as a boon
 vardaan ke parinamswaroop kadru ne ek hajaar andey or vinata ne do andey prasav kiye
 Kadru's eggs burst and he got a thousand snake sons
 kintu vinata ke andey us samay tak nahin phute
 Furious, Vinata burst an egg
 usamen se nikalne vaale bachche kaa upree ang purna ho chukaa tha kintu neeche ke ang nahin ban paye the
 The child got angry and cursed his mother that mother! You have broken the raw egg, so you will have to be your maid of law for five hundred years
 dhyaan rahe duusare andey ko apane se footne dena
 From that egg there will be a very bright child and he will get you free from this curse
 itnaa kahkar arun naamak vah balak akaash main ud gaya or surya ke rath kaa sarathi ban gaya One day the sight of Kadru and Vinata fell on a high horse, coming out of the sea churning

 On this, both were conditioned that the one whose statement would be false would have to become the maid of the other
 donon shart maanakar punch dekhne chalin

 One day Kadru said to Garuda that you are the son of my maid, so you take away my sons
 garud ko is par bahut krodh aayaa kintu unhone sauteli mata kii ajna maan lee
 Turning the snakes, Garuda asked them to free their mother from slavery
 is par sarpon ne kaha ki yadi tum ham logon ke liye amrit laa doge to ham tumhaari mata ko daastaa se mukt kar denge
 Garuda defeated all the gods including Indra and took away the nectar from them
 garud ke parakram se prabhavit hokar indra ne garud se mitrataa kar lee
 On becoming friends, Indra said, "friend! You give this nectar back to me, because those for whom you are taking it are naturally very wicked
 " is par garud ne kaha, "mujhe pataa he kintu main apni mata ko daastaa se mukti dilaane hetu ise unke paas le ja rahaa hoon
 You can get it back from there
 hathaat unki bhent narayan se ho gai
 Narayana, pleased with Garuda, asked him to ask for the groom
 is par garud ne sadaa unki dhwaja main bane rahane kaa var le liya
 They also became the vehicles of Narayan
 iske pashchaat garud amrit ghat ko sarpon ko dekar apni mata vinata ko daastaa se mukti dilaai
 Putting the nectar on the misrule, all the snakes went to bathe to become pure
 isi bich indra chori se us amrit ghat ko uthaa kar le gayi
 Ravana's son Meghnath fought Rama and tied Rama with Nagpash
 devarshi naarad ke kehane par garuda, jo ki sarpbhakshi the, ne nagapasha ke samast naagon ko khaakar ram ko nagapasha ke bandhan se chhudaaya
 When Rama was bound in Nagpash in this way, Garuda became suspicious when Rama was supreme
 garud kaa sandeh dur karne ke liye devarshi naarad unhen brahma ke paas bheja
 Lord Brahma told him that Lord Shankar can overcome your doubt
 bhagwaan shankar ne bhi garud ko unka sandeh mitaane ke liye kakbhushundi ji ke paas bhej diya
 Finally, Kakbhusundi ji heard the sacred story of Rama's character and removed the suspicion of Garuda

 Steam engines are mostly external combustion engines in which a heat cycle called the Rankine cycle is used

 Later, their design was greatly improved by which they emerged as major sources of mechanical power during the Industrial Revolution

 The earliest mention of the effort to make steam engines is found in the writings of the Hero of Alexandria
 hero us vikhyath alaxandreey sampradaay schwör bei koranka sadsy tha jisamen tolemi, euclid, iretosthanij jaise tatkaaleen vigyaan ke maharathi sammilit the
 In his article, Hero describes a device in which air was heated in a closed box and circulated down a pipe passage to a water-filled vessel
 isamen bartan kaa pani duusari nalee main chadhataa tha or ek nakli phuhaaraa ban jaataa tha
 Then after this, no details are found in this regard
 1606 i

 He also suggested that in order to fill a vessel with water, it should be connected to a pond with water by a tube and then after filling steam in that vessel and then cooling it with water from above, the inner steam condensed Vacuum will generate and instead the water from the pond will be filled in the vessel
 1698 i
 main marxev dela porta ke is suzav kaa upyog tamas severy ne pani chadhaane kii ek mashin main kiya
 Thus Savory was the first person to create a steam engine for commercial use, which was used to pump water from the mines and to drain water from the wells
 severy ke ingine ke avishkaar ke baad bhaap ingine kaa aglaa charan newcomen ingine kaa avishkaar tha
 It was invented by Thomas Newcomen
 is ingine kaa khadaanon or kuon se pani nikaalane main 50 varshon tak upyog hota rahaa
 It also has historical significance, because this opened the way for James Watt's inventions
 is ingine main pehali baar silinder or piston kaa upyog kiya gaya jo ab tak bhaap injanon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Steam in the newcomen engine is only used to generate vacuum
 piston uthaane kaa kaam, jisase pani chadhataa he, vayumandaleey daab karata he
 But it only takes a lot of fuel waste to condense the steam
 james wat kaa mahatvapurn kaary bhaap ingine ko sarvshereshth rup dena he jisase manushya kii shakti das guni bad gai or vyavsaayik kshetra main brihad parivartan ho gaya
 James Watt was a clever scientific engineer in Glasgow and in 1763 he was ordered by a physics professor at the University of Glasgow to repair a Newcomen engine that never ran well
 marammat karke samay wat ko dhyaan aayaa ki isamen eendhan buree tarah se vyarth ho jaataa he
 Watt of thoughtful nature started the idea of making the best machine from it
 is prakaar unhone anek anveshan kiye or yantra banaae, jinase bhaap ingine ko uskaa vartmaan swaroop praapt hua or vah udyog or sabhyataa kii pragati main shaktishaalee saadhan bana
 The following are the main types of steam engines: ekakriya ingine main bhaap piston ke ek hi ore kaary karti he evam dvikriya ingine main bhaap piston ke donon ore kaary karti he
 If both these types of engines have the same condition in all other states, the power received by the two-way engine is twice the power received by the other type of engine
 yahi kaaran he ki in dinon ekakriya ingine kam hi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 The engine is called vertical or horizontal according to whether the cylinder's axis is vertical or horizontal
 kshaitij ingine urdhwadhar ingine se adhik jagah gherta he
 The vertical type engine has less friction etc
, due to which it can run for more days than horizontal engine
 bhaap ingine kii chaal vastut: iske crank shift parikraman prati minute kii chaal hoti he
 The average piston speed in an engine with four foot piston stroke and 80 revolutions per minute would be 640 feet per minute
 yah ingine nimna chaal ingine kaha jayega
 Generally, an engine running at a speed of less than 100 revolutions per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine running at a speed of more than 250 revolutions per minute is called a high speed engine
 100 or 250 parikraman prati minute ke bich kii chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko "madhyam chaal ingine" kehete hai
 The greatest quality of a high speed engine is that it is of very small size for equal power
 ucch chaal ke kaaran bhaap bhi kam hi kharch hoti he, kyonki is prakaar ke ingine main bhaap or silinder ke bich ooshmaa sthanantaran main bahut hi kam samay lagata he
 The compaction engine is a steam engine from which steam is discharged directly into the atmosphere and for this the pressure of steam in the cylinder should never be less than the pressure of the atmosphere
 sanghanan ingine main bhaap kaary karne ke baad sanghnitr main pravesh karti he evam vah vahaan vayumandal kii daab par jal main parivartit ho jaati he
 The behavior of the condenser allows steam to function more
 saral ingine main prayek silinder boyler se sidhe bhaap paata he evam sidhe vayumandal yaa sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 In a combustion engine, steam is transmitted to a lesser extent in a cylinder called a high pressure cylinder, and then to a larger cylinder, called a low pressure cylinder, and the propagation is complete here
 bahudhaa nimna daab silinder sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 Propagation can also take place in three or four cylinders and these engines are called triprasar engines or tetraspara engines
 ooshmaa ingine kii adhiktam dakshata / T1 hoti he jisamen T1 or T2 ooshmaa ingine chakra main adhiktam evam nunatam taap hai
 This suggests that the efficiency of the engine depends on both these temperatures
 bhaanp ingine kii dakshata utani hi badhati jaaegi jitani kaa mulya badhegaa evam kaa mulya ghatega
 To increase the value of steam, the pressure of steam coming into the engine from the boiler has to be increased, because the higher the pressure of steam, the higher the value
 ko badhaane kaa ek or upaay he
 That is superheating the steam
 atitapak kaa boyler main vyavhaar karke bhaap kaa adhitaap badhaayaa jaataa he
 To reduce the value of K, it becomes necessary to behave the condenser
 sanghnitr main thande jal dwaara bhaap jal main parivartit kii jaati he
 Therefore, the value of a good condenser can be equal to the temperature of cold water
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhaap ingine main adhik daab evam atitpt bhaap dwaara kaary karaane se evam kaary karaane ke baad bhaap ko sanghnitr main prapya thande jal ke taap ke baraabar taap par jal main parivartit karne se ingine adhik daksh hoga
 Steam from the boiler enters the steambox at high pressure
 piston jaise hi stroke ke ant main pahunchataa he, usee samay valve chalata he, jisamen bhapadwar khul jaataa he evam bhaap silinder main pravesh karti he
 The piston moves when pushed by steam pressure
 ise agr stroke kehete hai
 The crank, crank shaft and centrifuge move by piston movement
 utkendrak ke chalane se dwaar kuch or adhik khul jaataa he
 Steam continues to enter the cylinder until the door is closed
 is samay viched hota he evam iske baad silinder main bhaap kaa sambharan nahi ho paata
 The steam in the cylinder is now transmitted and in this expansion the volume of steam increases and the pressure decreases
 isi prakaar ke samay bhaap kaary karti he
 At the end of the front stroke, the valve opens the steam side towards the exhaust, releasing the steam
 nikali hui bhaap kii daab pasch daab ke baraabar ho jaati he
 After a few moments of release, the piston returns backward and is called the alternating stroke
 is stroke main lautate samay piston silinder main bachi hui bhaap kaa nikaas karata jaataa he
 When the piston reaches the end of this stroke, the valve closes the exhaust gate, stopping the flow of steam
 silinder sheersh or piston ke bich kuch bhaap batch jaati he, jo nirmukt nahin ho paati he
 Then the cycle is repeated
 dvikriya ingine main isi se sadrush chakra kii kriya silinder kii duusari ore hoti he
 The Rankin cycle is a theoretical cycle according to which the steam engine operates
 gati niamak kaa mukhya kaary ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karnaa he
 The speed-regulator of a steam engine keeps the speed of cruises constant with the help of these two methods: shakti kii maang ke anusaar bhaap kii daab ko badhaakar yaa ghataakar ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karanevaale gatiniamak ko avrodh gatiniamak kehete hai
 The actuator drives a barrier valve, which is placed in the main steam tube
 is prakaar ke gatiniamakon main mukhya gatipalak kanduk gatiniamak hota he
 The valve is of a balanced type, that is, the resultant force by the steam is zero
 jab ingine kii gati badhati he, gatiniamak kandukon ke paribhraman kii gati main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he, jisase kentrapasari bal bad jaataa he
 This increase of force forces them to move out against the forces of gravity and control
 iske chalate valve kuch ansh main band ho jaataa he
 The pressure of the steam acting on the piston decreases when the valve is blocked, which also reduces the power generated
 evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main vruddhi ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop gati badhkar saamaanya gati par aa jaati he
 a simple line will be obtained if the weight of the steam transferred per hour in the engine is measured with horsepower after the use of a regular steam engine by the barrier speed-regulator
 yah sambandh sarvapratham vilian ne paaya tha
 Hence, it is called "the line of Villian" in his name
 gatipalkachakr ko isha ke saath chaabi ke dwaara atakaya jaataa he
 Large propellants are fitted in low-speed carrier ships and these propellants make 80 revolutions per minute
 is tarah ke jahaajon main bhaap ingine bahut hi upyukt hai
 In high-speed vessels, steam turbines are being used instead of steam engines
 samudryaan main vyavhaar main laae janevaale bhaap ingine main triprasar prakaar ke ingine prasiddh hai
 The ship engine is always equipped with surface condensers, which are fitted with brass tubes
 pump ke dwaara samudr kaa jal sanghnitr main laayaa jaataa he
 It is the condensation of condenser from sea water that condenses
 yadhyapi aajkal samudrayanon main antardahan ingine, bhaap tarabine evam gas tarabine vyavhaar main laayaa ja rahaa he, phir bhi kuch khaas avasthaaon main bhaap ingine kaa vyavhaar atyant aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Richard Trevithick first used steam locomotives to manufacture rail engines
 kintu aarthik kathinaayee ke kaaran unka prayaas safal na ho paaya
 Eventually George and Robert Stevenson were credited with making a successful rail engine, Fig
 7, and driving the train between Lowerpul and Manchester in 1829 AD
 jalayanon ke liye bhaap ingine kaa pratham upyog 1812 i
 main rabart pulton ne kiya tha
 Ordinary rail engines have the behavior of a horizontal steam engine
 yah ingine rail ingine boyler ke paas thos aadhaar par laga rahata he
 Almost all the locomotives do not have condenser
 kaary karne ke baad bhaap ko sidhe vayumandal main chhod diya jaataa he
 There are two types of such engines: aadhunik dizine main in donon prakaaron ko jod diya jaataa he, arthath kuch silinder ingine ke frem ke andar rahete hai evam kuch silinder baahar rahete hai
 Several changes have been made to James Watt's steam engine, although the main principle is still the same
 parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa bhaap ingine ke anekanek kaayon main prayukt hone ke kaaran hui
 Watt used low pressure in a steam engine because he feared an explosion
 lekin aajkal sarvatra ucch daab ingine hi prayukt kiye jate hai kyonki inaki dakshata bhi nimna daab ingine kii apeksha adhik hoti he
 The condenser of a modern engine consists of a number of taps into which soft water is flowed by a pump
 ek or pump bhaap ke sanghanan se bane pani or hawa ko nikaalane ke liye laga hota he
