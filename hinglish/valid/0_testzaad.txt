 Many insect males copulate with isolated females multiple times in their lives, and both male and female copulate repeatedly with many castes
 andey saadharantaya bahut chote hote hai
 Nevertheless, it is often possible to tell the egg which kind of insect will emerge from the egg
 bahudhaa yah baat bahut mahatv rakhti he, kyonki isse hanikaarak kiton kii hanikaarak dasha ke vishay main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the shape, form and color of eggs and the place and method of laying eggs

 It can lay one egg per second and lays 10,00,000 eggs in its six to twelve years of life
 andey ke sansechan ke pashchaat parivardhan aarambh ho jaataa he
 Initially a two-legged root band or germ band is formed, which is divided into twenty eggs by transverse lines
 agle chah khand sir, parvarti teen khand vaksh or shesh khand telson ke saath milakar udar banaate hai
 In addition to the first segment and the telson, a paired embryonic component develops in each segment

 The second pair is very short and transient
 teesri, chauthi or paanchavi jodi ke avyav viksit hokar mandible, mexila or labium ban jate hai
 The three pair of components behind them are somewhat large and clear
 ye taangon ke agravarti he
 The last pair of abdominal components become sarsai, but all the remaining pairs are usually destroyed before they reach the ovum
 andey se baccha nikalnaa-bhrun jab purna reeti se viksit ho jaataa he or andey se baahar nikalne ko taiyaar hota he, tab shukti main pehle se bani hui topi ko apane anda phodne vaale kaanton se hataakar baahar nikal aata he
 Initially in some insects, the fetus swallows air and increases its expansion so much that the secretion is broken
 bachche ko baahar nikalne main uski peshiyaan sahaayta karti hai
 Growth begins only after hatching
 janm se praudhata tak keet ke aakaar main jo vruddhi hoti he vah atyadhik aashcharya janak he
 The adult insect weighs between 1,000 and 70,000 times the birth weight
 itani adhik vruddhi aise khol ke bheetar, jiskaa vistaar bad nahin saktaa, nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, breaking of the shell is very important
 yah kentul ke patan se hi sambhav he
 Chronic externality is called snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ke fatne se purv hi iske bhitaravaale adhicharm kii koshikaaye naveen bahyatvak kaa utsarjan kar detii hai
 Then some of these special types of cells, which are called snake glands, produce a fluid substance

 At such a time, the insect grows
 kentul patan ke pashchaat keet kii akruti ko instar kehete hai
 When the insect comes out of the egg, the first instar occurs, after the first snake fall the insect is the second instar, the last instar is called the complete insect or adult insect
 adhiktar kiton main andey se jo dimbh nikalataa he uski akruti or rup vayask keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 Many insects undergo many changes until they become mature in shape and form

 kiton main do prakaar ke kriyasheel apraudh paae jate hai
 These are called nymph and egg
 ninf us apraudh avasthaa ke keet ko kehete hai jo andey se nikalne par adhik unnat hota he
 The differentiation of nymph from the complete insect is that it does not develop side and external gonads
 ye sthal par rahete hai or pakshon kaa vikson bahya rup se hota he
 The growth from nymph to complete insect is gradual and does not form pupa
 is prakaar ke parivartan kaa apurna roopantaran tathaa keet samudaay ko hemimetabola kehete hai, jaise eekh kii pankhi
 The ovum is very different from that of the late stage insect
 isamen pakshon kaa koi bhi bahya chinh nahin paaya jaataa
 The ovum has to become a pupa before it becomes a complete insect

 Minor insects have overrepresentation
 in dambhon main dimbh avasthaa main bhi atyadhik parivartan paaya jaataa he
 They have four or more apparent instars
 inke jivan or vyavhaar main bhi bahut bhed paaya jaataa he
 This type of transformation is called a hyper transformation, as in cantharis
 kiton main roopantaran ke niyaman kaa do hormonon se sambandh hota he- kentul patan kaarak hormone or shishav hormone
 Derm-degeneration hormone often excretes the thoracic gland
 yah hormone keet kaa kentulapatan karata he
 In adult, the thoracic gland disappears, so the dermis also ends
 yadi ninf kii vakshiya granthi praudh main jamaa di jaae to praudh bhi kentulapatan karne lagegaa
 Infant hormones emit corpora alata
 yah hormone praudh ke lakshanon ko dabaae rakhata he or ninfon ke lakshanon ke tivrata se ubhaadne main sahaayta karata he
 The reactivity of the thoracic gland increases at the time of conversion, and the effect of its hormone is sufficient enough that infancy crushes the effect of hormones and thus conversion occurs
 nead jalawaasi or bahut kriyasheel apraudh hote hai
 Their breathing stops

 Their entry into the plants depends on the particular condition of the plant
 anek keet anek paudhon par, yaa ek hi varg kii anek jatiyon ke paudhon par, akraman karte hai
 Generally, the plant of each species of insect remains fixed, and many insects do not eat any plant other than plants of the scheduled caste, even if they die
 bahut se kiton or paudhon kaa sambandh anyonya hota he
 Such moths visit flowers to obtain pollen and makaranda
 in vastuon ko praapt karte samay agyaan main hi ye pushparagan kar dete hai
 Often special types of creations are found in insects receiving food from flowers

 This type of behavior is found in insects of different classes
 inkaa shikaar koi anya keet, yaa aprishthvanshi jeev hota he
 Due to such life many changes take place in the legs, mouth parts and sensory senses of these insects
 aise kuch kiton ke vyavhaar main bhi spasht pavirthan drushtigochar hota he
 Some insects use their legs to catch their prey and to pause while eating
 vyaadh patang apni teenon jodi taange or jalmatkun tathaa mantid keval bagali taangon kaa hi is kaary main upyog karte hai
 This causes a change in their legs
 disticas ke jambh apane shikaar ko pakadaney ke liye nukile tathaa aage kii ore nikle rahete hai
 The lip of the nymph of the vyadhapatanga becomes of special shape to catch other insects

 jalpaksh ke kuch dimbh apane shikaar, chintiyon, ko pakadaney ke liye gaddha banaate hai
 Parasites are pests that subsist on other organisms, but receive food from them without killing them and often depend on the same nutrient
 ye apane andey praaia: apane poshak ke sharir par dete hai
 There are two types of parasitic insects - one that survives on vertebrates and the other on insects and their relatives
 pratham varg ke keet anoplura, mellophayga or cyphonaptera ganon tathaa hippobosidi vansh ke antargat aate hai
 These parasites are very small compared to their nutrient
 poshak main inako sahane karne kii shakti viksit ho jaati he or is kaaran inkaa prabhaav prananashak nahin hota
 Most of these are excellent parasites and live on the body of the nutrient
 cyphonaptera ke atirikt anya kaa sharir upar neeche se chauras hota he or ye poshak ke sharir se chipke rahete hai
 They have hooks to hold the nutrient on their feet and the eyes become weak or fading
 pakshon kaa bhi praaia: abhaav rahata he or yadi ve hote bhi he to bahut chote hote hai
 There are only a few parasites of insects
 strepsyptus gana ke atirikt madhumakhi kii juun, breula hi keval inkaa anya udhaaharan he
 The behavior of semi-parasites is similar to that between parasitic and parasitic
 aarambh main yah paraseete kii tarah rahata he, arthath poshak kii ati aavashyak indriyon ko nasht nahin karata, kintu baad main iskaa vyavhaar apahari jaisaa ho jaataa he or yah apane poshak kaa bhakshan kar jaataa he
 It usually lays its eggs above or inside the body of the nutrient
 iske dimbh poshak se sthaayee rup se chipke rahete he or apana bhojan poshak ke sharir ke bheetar yaa baahar se praapt karte hai
 Mostly these insects are found only in the Tachinidis of the bipedal lineage and in the Parasitica class of the genus Aap
 inke praudh kriyasheel hote hai or parashrayi nahin hote
 The size of a semi-parasite is larger than the size of a nutrient and by its behavior it always destroys the nutrient
 poshak adhiktar anya keet hi hote hai, jinke andon yaa anya apraudh avasthaaon par ardhparasite kaa akraman hota he
 Adult pests are never attacked
 texnidi vansh ke keet poshak ke bheetar rahete hai, kintu andey poshak ke upar, yaa poshak se dur, rakhte hai
 Many parasites are like external parasites, but most are internal parasites and lay their eggs within the skin of the nutrient
 ardhparajiviyon main sabase adhik mahatv kii baat inke shwasanatantr main pai jati he, vishesh karke aantarik ardhparajiviyon main, jo apane poshak ke rakt main mili hui oxijan kaa shwasan karte hai
 But there are some internal semi-parasites as well
 jo sidhe vayumandal se oxygen praapt karte hai
 Some insects do not feed on other insects, but eat away their collected material
 aise keet inkvilline kehalaate hai
 These pests are found in abundance in social insect pests
 inkaa bahut prasiddh udhaaharan mom kaa shalab hai, jo madhumakhi ke chhatton main rahata he or chhattein ko nasht kar detaa he
 Round-the-clock flies called Volusilla eat the organic flies they eat while staying in the swollen flies and burrows
 atelura naamak keet chitiyon ke vivaron main rahata he or jab ek cheentee duusari cheentee ko apana ulti kiya hua bhojan dene lagati he to usko pi letaa he
 There are also pests that benefit their nutrients in exchange for being with them
 kuch kanchukpaksh chitiyon ke vivaron main aashray or bhojan pate hai or iske badale main apane sharir se srav nikaal kar dete hai, jisko paane ke liye ye chitiyaan bahut lalayit rahati hai
 The last category of this relationship is that the ants actually feed the guest skeletal in exchange for secretions
 paraspar laabh pahunchaane kaa yah ek sundar udhaaharan he 
 Most insects have a habit of living alone, but insects of some castes form their own circle under the given circumstances
 sheetkaal main jab taap bahut neeche gir jaataa he, gharelu makkhiyaan praaia: ek saath ekatra ho jaati hai
 Some caterpillars are gregarious and all born bred together live together in the same webs, but such circles disperse as soon as the meal ends and each cull begins to remain independent
 bahut se keet anek paristhitiyon se vivash ho greeshmakaal bitaane, pupa banane or sheet nishkyita ke liye ekatra ho jate hai
 One of these situations is the search for a safe place
 kiton kii mandali main rahane kii prakruti ke kaaran paraseete or apahari shatruon se tathaa pratikul paristhitiyon se inaki sambhavat: raksha ho jaati he
 Some of the defense is done by being in the herd and active in traveling herders
 tiddiyaan or titiliyaan prvrajan ke samay yuthchara ban jaati hai
 a lonely fox named Helictus makes small rooms around the mouth of a tunnel built in the ground
 in kamaron main bhojan or ek ek anda rakh detii he, tatpashchaat inaki raksha karti rahati he
 It is also alive till the time the eggs are released from the eggs
 vah keet, jo apni santanon kii kam se kam unke jivan ke aarambh main dekhbhaal karata he, saamaajik jivan kii pratham shrenee kaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Social insects of different classes have different traits, but the most important feature of each of their congregations is that there is only one family, consisting of a male, a female and their offspring, or a mating female and its offspring
 , Ie, at least two generations live together in one place
 vaastavik saamaajik jivan bara, madhumakhiyon, chitiyon or dimakon main paaya jaataa he
 
 ek anya prakaar kaa sahjivan he jisamen ek keet duusare keet ke sharir par chipka rahata he
 The insects that stick on the body are usually large, but small insects do not eat them, that is, they do not cause any harm
 miloidi vansh ke triangulin dimbh ko saamaajik kalapaksh apane sharir par apane ghonslen main le jate hai
 These eggs eat their offspring there
 silionidi vansh ke kuch paraseete, maadaa tiddon kii peeth par, baith jate hai
 The grasshoppers lay on their backs until they lay eggs
 ant main apane andey tiddon ke andon main pravisht kar dete hai
 The most beautiful example is the botfly
 maadaa makshika apane andon ko machhar kii taangon or sharir par chipka detii he or jab machhar rakt chusane manushya ke paas pahunchataa he tab in andon main se dimbh nikalakar apane poshak manushya par akraman kar dete hai
 a large number of insects live in water
 ye adhiktar mithe pani main rahete hai, kuch khaare pani or samudr main bhi paae jate hai
 Many symptoms of these pests are useful
 bahut se kalapakshon kii chikani or chamakati hui deh tairte samay pani kii rukaawat kam kar detii he
 Many insects have special means to keep them from flowing into the waterfowl, such as the black flies holding the silk threads
 machharon ke dimbhon main shwasaradhran ke chaaron ore pai janevaali grathiyon se tel mila hua srav nikalataa he
 Due to this, the external properties of these places have hydrological properties and water cannot stay there
 at: shwasan berok tok hota rahata he
 Some insects, such as Poudura aquatica, have hair that causes the extracellular hydrocephalus
 is gun ke kaaran shwasapranal main jal nahin pravesh kar paata
 They also have special means for obtaining food, for example, in the nymphs of Odineta, the veil of labium acts as a trap
 machharon ke dimbhon ke mukhon main compankaaree burush hote hai jo jal main lehren utpann karte hai or is prakaar bhojan ke sookshmakan inaki grasika main pahanch jate hai
 The hind legs of the dietiscus form the hull
 notonacta or dietiscus tairte samay apni donon patavaaren ek saath hi chalaate hai, kintu hydrophilas apni pichhali taange pari pari se chalaata he
 The diaphragm called jirinus swings and swims round and round with sharp changes in the middle and back legs
 kuch mackhiyon or machharon ke dimbh udar kii peshiyon ke prabal udyog dwaara tairte hai
 Kalapaksha, a very small polinima, which is paralyzed in eggs of aquatic insects, swims in the water with the help of its sides
 jalawaasi kiton ke shwasanatantr main bahut se parivartan aa jate hai
 They respire through the trachea, reservoir, or blood reservoir
 kuch keet vaayu ko apane paas jamaa kar lete hai or jab ve jal main duube hote hai tab uskaa upyog karte hai
 The trachea system of the transparent ovum of the insect called the cortex of the biceps becomes a pair of bean-shaped pairs
 ye theliyaan utplavan indriya kaa kaary karti hai
 This ovum can change the volume of these bags by some unknown method and thus can generate relative master speed according to the depth of water
 keet saare sansar main, himachhadit dhruviya bhaagon se lekar bumadhya rekha ke pasavaale, tapate hue bhaagon tak main paae jate hai
 Their distribution is more extensive than all other terrestrial organisms
 ye lagbhag un sabhi sthanon main paae jate hai jahaan vanaspatiyaan ug sakati hai, arthath jahaan bhi inako bhojan praapt ho saktaa he
 Vegetables are the food of insects and other organisms
 paksh ek mahaan mahatvavaali rachana he
 Insects have incomparable distribution power, which is not found in other terrestrial organisms
 vitaran kii shakti kiton kii prayek jati ko teevr spardhaa se or kathor nirvachan ke prabhaav se, jiskaa parinaam parimit kshetra main atyadhik bheed hona hota he, bachane ke liye swatantraaa pradaan karti he, kintu bahut se keet aise bhi hai jinka vitaran simit he
 Oil pests, rice truncated insects, pulses pests etc
 are famous among insects found in the houses of humans all over the world
 inke atirikt aajkal chane kaa shalab, aalu k shalab, shakarkand kaa suundwala keet or bandgobhi kaa shalab, bhi saare sansar main paae jate hai
 Similarly, there are many such pests that are found only in a particular state or country
 aisa vitaran bahut si paristhitiyon par nirbhar rahata he
 Feeding and natural conditions are undoubtedly very effective conditions
 jalawaasi keet vahaan nahin rah sakate jahaan jal nahin he
 Insects living in the bark of trees cannot be found in places where there is no tree
 prakritik avrodh, jaise unche unche pahaad, samudr tathaa marusthal, kiton kaa vitaran ek desh se duusare desh main nahin hone dete
 Some insects, such as safilize, cabbage butterfly, etc
 are found only in the temperate zone
 falon kii makkhiyaan, dhan ke keet aadi keval ayanvrutt main hi milte hai
 Some insects, such as locusts and some butterflies, sometimes have a propensity to migrate and reach far-off countries
 kintu bahut se kiton ke aadhunik vitaran kii vyakhya prithvi kii aadhunik dasha or jalwaayu ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati or isliye praaia: bhouvrittiya parivartanon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 The insect called Spring Tail is found in New Zealand and Chile
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi kaal main in donon deshon ke bich atactic mahadweep failaa hua tha, kyonki yah keet itnaa komal or pakshaheen he ki iskaa anya kisi prakaar se vitaran ho hi nahin saktaa
 Spring tail has the most extensive distribution compared to other insects and due to this it has adapted itself to these different conditions
 chitiyon kaa bhi lagbhag isi prakaar vitaran he or inhone bhi apane ko vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool kar liya he
 The Bear, in 1954-55, stated that the eggs of Miriapoda who can breed in the embryo should be considered as ancestors of insects
 yah siddh karne ke liye kiton ke praudh or kuch miriapoda ke dimbhon kii, udaahranarth, aiulas kii, jo ek milipid he, tulana karne main mahatpurna hai
 When the egg of the ileus emerges from the egg, its head appears to be composed of as many segments as the head of the insect
 sharir ke shesh bhaag main lagbhag 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se pratham teen khandon main prayek par ek jodi taange hoti hai
 Fourth and the sections behind them are also without legs
 kintu inke parivardhan main rukaawat aa jaati he or ye bahut hi chote rah jate hai
 In this way, the ovum of this six-legged ileus becomes a long adult at the end, which has many segments and many legs in the body
 yadi is dimbh kii pratham teen jodi ke pashchaatwali taangon ke parivardhan main adhik rukaawat ho or dimbh ke sharir ke lagbhag 12 khand praudhavastha main drudh rahen to yah jeev keet ke aakaar kaa hoga, jisamen pratham teen jodi taangon ke pechhevali taange yaa to itani ksheen hongi ki keval unke avshesh hi honge yaa ve sarvatha lupt hongi
 It is very interesting that in fact there are pests in which even the remains of the legs are present on the abdomen, such as Campodia, Japix and Matilis
 in kiton ke paksh nahin hote or inamen ve rachanaaen vartmaan rahati hai jo anya kiton main lupt ho gai hai, jaise janangranthiyon kaa khandibhavan
 Therefore, in the development of insects, these insects should understand the mid stage condition of the eggs and other insects born in the brain of Miriapoda
 anya anek tarkon se bhi yah anumodith hota he ki miriapoda kii tarah kii akritiyon se hi kiton kii utpatti hui he
 It is highly likely that myriapoda are the ancestors of insects in all those long-bodied and tangled organisms, because they contain many of the same creations, for example, malpigian tubules and tracheal tubules
 kintu iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki kiton kii utpatti praudh miriapoda se nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki inamen bahut si visheshtaayen or vilakshantaayen hai
 The Aperigota subclass is a group of mostly diverse insects and only the Thysanurae ganas of that subclass are probably close to the main category of growth of Terrigote insects
 aisa tark dwaara siddh kiya gaya he ki aptarigota ke shesh teen ganon ko keet maananaa hi nahin chahie
 However, there does not seem to be any satisfactory reason to separate these three ganas from this subclass, although there is no doubt that they exhibit unique compositions, for example the pests of Collenbola gana have only nine segments
 protura gana ke kiton main enamorphosis hota he, diplura, gana ke kiton main alakshanik trekial tantra paaya jaataa he, diplura or colembala kii shringikaaon ke kashabh main peshiyaan hoti hai
 The subclass Terrigota is divided into two parts - exopterigota and endopterigota
 exopterigota ganon ke affimeroptera or odoneta main paraspar nikat sambandh he, kyonki ye donon hi peliapteron, gana hai
 Blatteria, Mantodia, Isoptera, Joreptra, Gyloblatodia, Rhe Jupaj, Phasemaida, Plicoptera, Dermptra and Ambioptera r Jupaxica orthopterade, are included within the community, if considered from the body theory of modern insects 
 nimnlikhit lakshanon ke kaaran ye sab gun ek samudaay banaate hai-aparivartit mukhbhaag, pashchapaksh main vishaal anelle lob udar ke pasch sire par ek jodi sarasai, aganit mailipagian nalikaayeor pratiprishth tantric tantu main kai ek pruthak-pruthak gucchhikaayen
 Of these Ganas, Blatteria and Mantodia have a very close relationship, placing them both together under Dictyoptera
 exopterigota ke shesh gana, jinke naam hai socoptera, mellophayga, simonculeta, matkunagan or jhallaripaksh, matkunaganik samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 The characteristics of the Mtkunganik community are as follows: special types of mandibulate or sucking mouth, anel lobes not found in the posterior side, lack of sarsai
 malepigian nalikaaon kii sankhya bahut thodi hoti he or pratiprishth tantriktantu kii gucchhikaaye lagbhag ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There are no clear distinctions between the rheumatic and the mitochondrial communities, as the side veins in the Joraptera are somewhat weakened, the number of mallepigian tubules is even smaller, and the neoplasms are also slightly dilated
 socoptera or mellophayga main spasht sambandh prathit hota he, kyonki donon main vilakshan prakaar kaa hypofarics hota he
 Probably Cyphonculata is closely related to Malophaga
 inase ve keval anek bahya or aantarik rachanaaon tathaa prakruti main hi saadrishy nahin rakhte, apitu shwasaradhran kii rachana or andey se bachche nikalne kii vidhi main bhi saadrishy he
 Now the question arises as to why both lice of lice are not considered under the same gana
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki donon ganon ke mukhbhaagon main itnaa adhik antar hota he
 That it is often considered appropriate to keep them separately in different ganas
 indopterigot kiton ke vishay main dhyaan de to kalapaksh, strepciptera or kanchukpaksh ko anya ganon ke saath rakhane main atyadhik kathinata upasthit hoti he, at: inke atirikt shesh sab gana panorapid samudaay ke antargat rakhe gaye hai

 ek din shriramachandraji ne bharat or lakshmana ko apane paas bulaakar kaha, "he bhaaiyon! meri ichha rajasuya yajna karne kii he kyonki vah rajdharm kii charamasima he
 All sins are destroyed by this yagna and you get the results of renewable and imperishable fruit
 atah tum donon vichaarkar kaho ki is lok or paralok ke kalyaan ke liye kya yah yajna uttam rahegaa?" Hearing these words of the elder brother, the righteous Bharata said, "maharaj! The best religion on this earth, fame and this earth itself is reputed among you
 aap hi is sampoorn prithvi or is par rahane vaale samast raja bhi aapako pitrutulya maanate hai
 So, how can you do this Yajna so that all the dynasties and heroes of this earth are feared to be killed by us? " bharat ke yuktiyukt vachan sunakar shriram bahut prasann huye or bole, "bharat! tumhaara satyaparamarsh dharmsangat or prithvi kii raksha karne vaala he
 By accepting this good statement of yours, i give up my desire to perform Rajsuya Yagya
 " After that Laxman said, "O Raghunandan! There is also Ashwamegha Yagya to destroy all sins
" yadi aap yajna karnaa hi chaahate hai to is yajna ko kijiye
 This ancient account about Mahatma Indra is heard that when Indra was incurred by Brahma, he was sanctified by performing the Ashwamedha Yagya
 " On asking the full story by Sri Rama, Lakshmana said, "in ancient times, the demon named Vritrasura ruled the earth with full religious devotion
 ek baar vah apane jyeshtha putr madhureshwar ko rajya bhaar saunpkar kathor tapasya karne van main chalaa gaya
 Indra was also shaken by his penance
 vah bhagwaan vishnu ke paas jaakar bole ki prabho! tapasya ke bal se vritrasur ne itani adhik shakti sanchit kar lee he ki main ab us par shashan nahin kar saktaa
 If he increased his power more as a result of penance, then all of us gods would always be subject to him
 isaliye prabho! aap krupa karke sampoorn lokon ko uske aadhipaty se bachaaiye
 Slay him anyway
 "devraj indra kii yah prarthana sunakar bhagwaan vishnu bole ki yah to tum jaanate ho devraj! majhe vritrasur se sneh he
 That is why i cannot kill him, but i cannot refuse your prayers
 isaliye main apane tej ko teen bhaagon main is prakaar vibhajit kar doongaa jisase tum swayan vritrasur kaa vadh kar sako
 One part of my glory will enter you, another in your thunderbolt and third in the earth so that it can bear the weight of Vritrasura when it collapses
 bhagwaan se yah vardaan paakar indra devataaon sahit us van main gayi jahaan vrutra tapasya kar rahaa tha
 On getting the opportunity, Indra gave his powerful thunderbolt to the forehead of Vritrasura
 isse vrutra kaa sir katkar alag ja padaa
 As soon as the head was cut off, Indra started thinking, i have committed a huge sin by killing a innocent person
 yah sochakar ve kisi andhkaarmay sthaan main jaakar praayshchit karne lage
 When Indra was lost, the Gods prayed to Lord Vishnu, o Deenabandhu! If you hit Vritrasura, it has gone faster than you, but Indra has to suffer the sin of brahmacharya
 isaliye aap unke uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaiye
 Hearing this, Vishnu said that if Indra worshiped Yajnapurusha by performing the Ashwamedha Yagna, he would get the post of Devendra without sin
 indra ne aisa hi kiya or ashwamegh yajna ke pratap se unhone brahmahatya se mukti praapt kii
 " ek katha vritrasur kii he jisko murkh logo ne aisa dhar ke lautaa he ki vah pramaan or yukti in donon se viruddh ja padi he
 'vritrasura, the son of Tvashta, swallowed Indra, the king of the gods
 tab sab devtaa log bade bhay yukt hokar vishnu ke sameep gayi, or vishnu ne uske maarane kaa upaay batalaaya ki --main samudr ke phen main pravisht ho jaaounga
 You guys, pick up that froth and kill Vritrasura, he will die
 ' The story of mythology made like crazy is all false
 shreshth logo ko uchit he ki inako kabhi na maane
 Look, this story is written in the Satyagraha in such a way that - yahan surya kaa indra naam he
 We call his valor done, which is very strong for being the ultimate glory
 vah apni kirnon se 'vrutra' arthath megh ko martha he
 When he dies and falls in the earth, then he spreads his water body in all the earth
 phir usase anek badi-2 nadi paripurna hoke samudr main ja milti hai
 What are those rivers that water originating from mountains and clouds is meant to flow
 jis samay indra meghroop vritrasur ko maar ke akaash se prithvi main gira detaa he, tab vah prithvi main so jaataa he
 
 1
 
 phir vahi megh akaash main se neeche girake parvat arthath meghmandal kaa punah aashray letaa he
 Whom the Sun breaches again with its rays
 jaise koi lakdi ko chhil ke sookshm kar detaa he
 In the same way, he also plunges the cloud into the earth, and his body forms the water through the rivers in such a way that the cows get from their calves in the race
 
 2
 
 When Surya disintegrates that very fallen cloud in the earth such that a person cuts the body of a person and cuts it down, then that Vritrasura also becomes like a sleeping person on the earth
 
 3
 
 In 'nighantu', the name of the cloud is Vritra - the enemy of Vrittra means preventive Surya, Surya's name is Tvashtha, his child is the cloud, because the rays of the Sun become cloudy by moving upwards to form water particles
 tathaa megh kaa vrutra naam isaliye he ki vrutrovrinoteh0 vah sweekaar karne yogya or prakaash kaa aavaran karne vaala he
 Large rivers originate from this watery body of the circle and go into the deep sea, and the water remains in the pond and well, as if it is sleeping in the earth
 
 5
 
 That circle can never win Indra even with its lightning and thundering fear
 is prakaar alankariroop varnan se indra or vrutra ye donon paraspar yuddh ke saamaan karte hai, arthath jab megh badhata he, tab to vah sury ke prakaash ko hataata he, or jab sury kaa taap arthath tej badhata he tab vah vrutra naam megh ko hataa detaa he
 But at the end of this war, the name of Indra is conquered by Surya
 jab jab megh vruddhi ko praapt hokar prithvi or akaash main vistrut hoke failata he, tab tab usko sury hanan karke prithvi main gira detaa he
 After that, having impure land, rotten vegetation, wood, straw and excrement, it sometimes causes deodorant
 tab samudr kaa jal dekhne main bhayankar maaloom padane lagata he
 In this way, there is a frequent cloudy year
 --arthath sab sthanon se jal ud ud kar akaash main badhata he
 Gathers there and rains again
 usee jal or prithvi ke sayong se oshadhi aadi anek padaarth utpann hote hai
 The same cloud is called 'vritrasura'
 vaayu or sury kaa naam indra he
 Air is located in the sky and in the sunlight
 inhen vritrasur or indra kaa akaash main yuddh hua karata he ki jiske ant main megh kaa paraajay or sury kaa vijay nihsandeh hota he

 alindi sphuran ek prakaar kaa asaamaanya hridaytal he jo hriday ke alind main hota he
 When it occurs for the first time, it is usually associated with a rapid heart rate or a rapid heartbeat rate and falls in the category of supra ventricular rapid heartbeat rate

 While atrial pulsation may sometimes not notice, its onset is marked by characteristic features of regular nervousness
 aise samvednaayen aamtaur par tab tak rahati he jab tak prakaran samaapt, yaa hriday kii dar niyantran main hota he
 Initially atrial fibrillation can usually be well tolerated, however, people with other underlying heart disease or mild exercise tolerance may develop rapid symptoms, which include shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness, or dizziness
 May include nausea and feelings of panic and impending doom, in some patients
 lambey samay tak teji se vikampan kshati-apurti ko prabhavit kar saktaa he saath main saamaanya hriday prakaarya kaa haani ke kaaran hriday asafalataa ho saktaa he
 This function can manifest as intolerance, nighttime breathing, or swelling of the feet or abdomen
 alindi sphuran parikoshth kaa baayen yaa dahini main golakaar taal ke kaaran ke dwaara hota he
 Normally, premature atrial fibrillation is triggered by an electrical impulse arising, atrial enlargement is increased due to differences in the refractive period of the atrial tissue

 For each cycle around the loop, there is an electric-generated impulse that achieves growth through the atrium
 alindi sphuran kaa prabhaav or lakshan rogi ke hriday kii dar par nirbhar hai
 Heart rate is a measurement of ventricular rather than atrial activity
 alind se utpann aavegon ko alind ventricular node ke madhyam se ventrical pe chaalit kiya jaataa he
 Primarily due to the long-term refractory period, the A
V
 The node exerts a defensive effect on the heart rate to inhibit the atrial impulse beyond 180 / min, for example a steady heart rate
 
 If the pulsation rate is 300 / min, then only half of these impulses will be convected giving the ventricular rate 150 / min or 2: 1 heart block
 Drugs that control the rate or increase of disease of the vascular system can greatly increase this block
 alindi sphuran do prakaar ke hote hai, saamaanya prakaar i or asaamaanya prakaar II

 Blood stagnation in the heart of susceptible individuals can lead to the formation of a blood clot

 The blood clots in the left atrial branch are the most important because they supply blood to the entire body on the left side of the heart

 Even though the ventricle is capable of handling high rates of cardiac output 1: 1 pulsation can degenerate over time as well as ventricular fibroplasia leading to hemodynamic heart failure and death

 Both rhythms are associated with dangerously rapid heart rate and require medication for such rate or rhythm control

 Atrial fibrillation is more sensitive to direct electrocardialization than atrial fibrillation and usually requires a lower energy suspicion

 Conversely, it is relatively resistant to chemical cardioversion and often degenerates into atrial decompression before returning to the sinus rhythm

 Being in the middle of the regions of the northern and southern dialects, the characteristics of the two classes were somewhat integrated in it
 uttari corsika kii boli toskano se milti he
 The dialects of Lancio, Umbia and Marque can be grouped into one category, and the dialects of Abruzzi, Campania, Calabria, Poolya and Sicily are prominent in the dialects of the south — their most prominent feature being the combination of Latin cuisine with Nun, Mb

 Sardinian's dialects are different from Italian

 External attacks may also have had an impact

 Vivacity and euphemism is sufficient in dialects

 One of the first early nineteenth century "indovinello Veronesse" finds modern Italian language words

 In the seventh and eighth centuries written letters are found in the form of names of places and some words which signify the new language
 saahitiyik laathini or jansamanya kii boli main dhire-dhire antar badhata gaya or boli kii laathini se hi aadhunik italvi kaa vikaas hua
 There are many specimens of this dialect

 Samples of the 11th-12th century language are also found as religious confessions in Umbria and Marque, but examples of Italian-language compositions are found in the court poets of Emperor Frederick II of Sicily

 Several poets wrote poems in the then dialect in Florence, Pisa, Lucca and Arezzo
 bolon main saahitiyik bhashaa kaa rup sthir karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 The Sicilian and Toscana poems provide the final and stable form of literary Italian presented by the poets of "dolche Stil Novo"

 Among Dante and other followers of "doche Stil Novo" are Fronchesco, Petrarca and Jovovanni Boccaccio

 Petrarca's poems and Boccaccio's stories put forth a very well-organized form of Italian literary language

 In the 15th century, fans of ancient Latin literature tried to drive Latin, and the study of ancient civilization tried to create a new literary language, but this Latin was different from ancient Latin

 One party was in favor of creating a new literary language with some elements of different dialects, one party was in favor of replacing it with Toscana, especially the dialect of Florence, and one party, in which Pietro Benbo was the chief, wanted Dante, Petrarca And the language of Boccaccio should be considered ideal

 Vishprapancha is a Hindi translation by Acharya Shukla of the book Riddle of the Universe by Ernst Heckel, Germany's famous philosopher and materialist philosopher
 anuwaad ke vaktavy main swayan acharya shukla ne likhaa he 'ridl of da univers' anaatmavaadi aadhibhautik paksh kaa siddhanth-granth he
 It has a collection of all the facts confirmed by various sciences, which the ghosts present in their evidence
 jis samay yah prakashit hua europe main isaki dhooma-si much gayi
 In Germany alone it was consumed 9000 copies within two months
 yorape kii sab bhashaaon main iske anuwaad nikle
 In English, millions of copies reached from the corner of the earth to the other
 is pustak ne sabase adhik khalabali padariyon ke bich daali jinaki gaaliyon se bhari hui saikadon pustaken iske pratwaad main nikaleen
 The book, which is the principle text of the nonjudgmental half-physical side and which has hundreds of books filled with clergy abuses, cannot be called a scripture! But Acharya Shukla, a believer in religion and a believer in beliefs, translates this book into Hindi with utmost labor and enthusiasm, which was a book of life and not a book of literature! Needless to say that the terminology of pranishastra was not formed in Hindi at that time
 acharya shukla is shabdaawalee kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai or bahut hi pranjal bhashaa main 'ridl of da univers' kaa hindi main anuwaad prastut kar hekkel ke vichaaron ko sampoorn hindi bhashi kshetra main failaana chaahate hai
 Heckel was a supporter of capitalism, but his book established the materialistic philosophy by proving that the idealist philosophy was inappropriate
 rus main adaalat ne is pustak ke roosi anuwaad kii sabhi pratiyon ko jabt kar aag main jala daalane kaa aadesh tak diya
 Lenin has written about the Riddle of the Universe that despite the author's capitalist political views, this popular booklet became a weapon of class struggle against the capitalist class
 yah kaisaa sanyog he ki rus main lenin jis pustak kaa mahatv itnaa bad-chadhakar aankate hai bharat main acharya shukla uskaa bhashanuwaad prastut karte hai ! tajjub nahin, acharya shukla ke yug main nahin, uske bahut baad is pustak kii khoj hoti he or isaki bhoomika bhautikwaadi chetana ke prasar kaa mahatvapurn saadhan banati he
 The specialty of Vishwanaprancha is that a 126-page role has been played with it, in which Acharya Shukla has given his thought in relation to the views expressed in the book
 is bhoomika kii taraf hindi pathakon kaa dhyaan dilaane kaa shrey dow ramvilas sharma ko he
 And credit to Dr
 Namwar Singh for making it easily accessible
 yah bilkul swaabhaavik he ki is bhoomika kii ore dhyaan acharya shukla ke shishyon or un aalochakon kaa nahin gaya, jo apane ko unki parampara ko viksit karanevaala aalochak maanate hai balki un aalochakon kaa gaya, jo hindi ke ‘vidharmee’ or ‘parampara-drohi’ yani marxvaadi aalochak hai ! In the beginning of the said role, we get this statement of Acharya Shukla, in the last century, new things started to be discovered and new theories were stable in Europe, under physics, chemistry, geology, zoology, physiology etc
 As soon as the feelings of the people regarding the world started changing
 jahaan pehle log choti-se-choti baat ke kaaran ko na paakar use ishwar kii kriti maan santosh kar lete the vahaan chaaron ore naanaa vigyaanon ke dwaara kaary-kaaran kii aisi vistrut shrinkhalaa upasthit kar di gayi ki kisi ko bich main thithkane kii aavashyaktaa na rah gayi
 The path opened up to extend the vision of knowledge
 is kathan main vaigyanik pragati main jo aasthaa vyakt kii gayi, vah dhyaan dene yogya he
 How different is the attitude of Acharya Shukla towards science, that the civilization that is going on the science ship is going to sink! He has aimed to research the biggest feature of science - the cause-cause chain, as well as its result, which has started to change people's perception of the world that it is Godized
 aage ve kehete hai, jeevadhariyon ke sambandh main pehle logon kii dharna thi ki jitne prakaar ke jeev aajkal hai, sab ek saath sristi ke armbh main hi utpann ho gayi the arthath jitne prakaar ke jeevon ke dhaanche aadi main the ve sab bina kisi parivartan ke ab tak jyon ke tyon chale aa rahe hai
 Darwin refuted this belief and established the 'development Principle', proving that these many types of structures which appear to have so many creatures, all from the very primitive organisms of the same type of very primitive form, have millions of years of descent respectively
 Between the tradition, getting different changes in its components according to the situation and progressively dividing it into several branches according to distinction
 Pnn are
 isi vikaas kram ke anusaar manushya jati bhi purvayug ke un jeevon se utpann hui jinase bandar vanamaanush aadi utpann hue arthath vanamaanushon or manushyon ke purvaj ek hi the
 The comment that Acharya Shukla has made after this is interesting, this developmentalism caused great panic
 isaki baat jansadharan ke vishwaas or dharmpustakon kii puranic sristi-katha ke viruddh thi
 In our puranas too, the vagaries are said to be stable and their number has also been stated as eighty-four million
 garuda puraana main to prayek varg kii yoniyon kii ginati tak he
 Darwin has proved this well by showing that the organisms of another caste originated from the same species
 yoniyaan sthir nahin hai, sthitibhed ke anusaar asankhya yoniyon ke bich unke avyavon aadi main parivartan hote gayi hai, jisase yoni ke jeevon se duusari yoni ke jeevon kii shakha chali he
 After representing developmentalism and giving his opinion on it, Acharya Shukla has said in the role of 'vishwa Prapancha' that with this evolutionism, hackles etc
 have reputed their naturalism or anachronism, which is not only opposed to mythology, but Reaches all theistic or subjective philosophies
 vikassiddhanth ko sweekaar karte hue bhi adhikansh darshan nity chetan tatva maanate hai or uski bhaavana kai prakaar se karte hai
 Hackle Chaitanya is called a result of matter, which develops in the brain of animals
 unka kahana he ki aatma sharir dharm ke atirikt or kuch nahin
 Therefore, it is a mistake to consider him to be an immaterial natural element separate from the body
 sharir ke saath hi uski bhi itishree ho jaati he
 Consciousness is the awareness of our businesses
 jis prakaar vishay sampark dwaara indriyon or samvedansutron main kai prakaar ke kshobh hote hai, usee prakaar mastishk main jaakar unke dwaara utpann sanskaron kaa bodh bhi hota he
 Therefore, consciousness is also the business of material conscience which is destroyed when that reason is destroyed
 lekin yah hekkel yaa bhautikwaad kaa paksh he, acharya shukla kaa nahin
 Acharya Shukla says, now the question is, does developmentism properly explain the origin of all the trades of the world? His reach has no limits
 sharir vikaas or aatmavikas ko hi lijie
 In both the body trade and the mindset, the same type of rules, the simultaneous development of both, is shown to be correct, but both have not been proved
 vikaswad ke saare nirupan man yaa aatma kii prathamotpatti nahin samajha sake hai
 And then let us know how the physical pulsation of the sensing system results in sensing, this secret does not open
 is prakaar kaa or koi parinaam bhautik jagat main dekhne main nahin aata
 Some people want to overcome this difficulty by saying that each atom of matter has a type of consonant or latent sensation that manifests as attraction and exorcism
 par ham to chetana arthath man kii apane hi sanskaron ke bodh kii vritti kii utpatti jaananaa chaahate hai jisase yah antahsangya bhinn he
 It is not possible to understand the business of consciousness even after what Hackel has described as an attainable element within the brain
 keval yahi kah dene se ki ek vastu par pratibimb pad rahaa he yah samaj main nahin aa jaataa ki vah vastu yah bodh bhi karti he ki mujh par pratibimb padataa he yaa pratibimb is prakaar kaa he
 In this way, Acharya Shukla gets confused about the origin and nature of consciousness but he does not give up hope
 unka yah kathan bahut hi mahatvapurn he : ‘‘kinv-sambandhi rasayan baraabar unnati karata ja rahaa he
 Many types of fermentation, or yeast, are made from the sum of atoms of some basic substances, without shelter from the body material derived from plants or animals
 sajiv dravya kii utpatti ke paas tak yahi vidhaan pahunch sakaa he or isi se bahut kuch aashaa he
 The life of living is in fact the ferment tradition
 yaheen paad tippanee main unhone charvak kii vah ukti uddhrut kii he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki chaar bhautik tattvon ke dehaakaar main parinat hone se madashaktiwat chaitanya utpann hota he or unke nasht hone se vah bhi nasht ho jaataa he
 Among the scientists of the West, there have been some atheists and some theists and some skeptics
 aalivar loj naamak ek vaigyanik ne aatma kii satta par bahut bal diya tha
 Acharya Shukla has given his comment below by quoting his opinion in detail, for a few days in Europe and America, there have also been standing seekers of indirect power who do industry to show the existence of self-confidence by showing many kinds of siddhis
 ye mrit purushon kii atmaaon se baatcheet karne unke dwaara alokik ghatnaon ke hone kaa haal sunaaya karte hai inaki ore se kai patrikas bhi nikalati he
 But most of them take the shelter of deceit and pranks, due to this, educated and scientists do not have faith in them
 bahuterey antajkaran kii asaamaanya vrittiyon yaa avasthaaon ko apane prayog main laate hai
 But these tips do not solve the educated
 phir samaadhaan kya he ? acharya shukla satya kii khoj main the
 Spiritual philosophers used to tell the ultimate truth which was conscious
 duusari ore vaigyanik bhi param tatva ko ek batala rahe the joki bhoot tha
 Acharya Shukla prepared an equation about philosophy and science from this and said that the difference between distinctions is the goal of both knowledge and religion
 vigyaan isi abhed kii khoj main he, dharm isi kii ore dikh rahaa he
 It can be said here that Acharya Shukla has brought science and philosophy or science and religion to a point, while he knew the difference between these two very well
 unhone vishvaprapanch kii isi bhoomika main likhaa he vaigyanik nishchay or darshanik anumaan main bada bhed hota he
 Philosophers give only hints and scientists investigate the details
 lekin jaisaa ki armbh main kaha gaya he acharya shukla navdith shikshit bhartiya madhyavarg ke sadsy the
 For this reason his writing had a certain social context
 unke samay main dharmik vivaad teevr rup main chal rahe the, jisase samaaj ke vibhinn dharmik sampradaayon ke bich ek tanaav kii sthiti bani rahati thi
 Naturally, he said that now is not the time to set up a quarrel over the special physical matters of religious beliefs and religion
 sab maton or sampradaayon main dharm or ishwar kii jo saamaanya bhaavana he usee kaa paksh ab shikshit paksh ke antargat aa saktaa he
 God realizes that the formless, long-bearded four-handed, Arabic speaks that Sanskrit befriends the idol worshipers, that those who raise their hands to the sky, those who dispute these things will now only be ridiculed
 isi prakaar sristi ke jin rahasyon ko vigyaan khol chukaa he unke sambandh main jo pracheen puranic kathaayen or kalpanaayen hai ve ab dhaal-talwaar kaa kaam nahin de sakati
 Now those who want to go to the field, collect facts from various sciences and go straight to the boundary where two sides are adamant - one side selfist, the other self-oriented; Inertialist on the one hand and eternal consciousness on the other
 yadi chaitanya kii nity satta sarvamaanya ho gayi to phir sab maton kii bhaavana kaa samarthan hua samajhie, kyonki chaitanya sarvaswaroop he
 True vision is the vision of many distinctions
 isi ke dwaara satya kaa anubhav or matamtaantar ke raag-dwesh kaa parihaar ho saktaa he
 There are many things to note in this quote
 ek to yah ki acharya shukla darshan ko bauddhik jalpanaaon se nikaalkar use jivan main upyogi banane ke paksh main the, jisase ki samaaj main matamtaantar janit raag-dwesh kaa parihaar ho sake
 The second thing related to this is that his biggest concern was to see impunity in the distinctions, so that human harmony and unity can be established in the place of discrimination
 isiilie unhone bhoomika ke ant main paigambari akeshwarwad kaa joardaar shabdon main virodh or aupnishadik brahmavaad kaa samarthan kiya hai kyonki usamen 'ek sadwipra bahudhaa vadanti' kii rigvaidic bhaavana kaa vistaar hua he
 Acharya Shukla is clearly seeing the struggle for sentimentism and materialism in the field of philosophy
 dow ramvilas sharma ne "yadi chaitanya kii nity satta sarvamaanya ho gayi" main prayukt 'yadi' shabd kii ore hamaara dhyaan dilaayaa he joki bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 This means that Acharya Shukla does not consider the struggle of Bhavism and materialism to be a decision
 ve sirf satya ko jaanane ke icchhuk hai ve pratiksha kar rahe hai ki satya saamne aaye, aadhibhautik advait ke rup main yaa aadhyatmik advait ke rup main
 Their main concern is with the society
 uparyukt uddhran main yah teesri dhyaan dene yogya baat he
 With the influence of evolution, Acharya Shukla considered the entire human civilization to be developing
 unhone likhaa he ki is siddhanth ke anusaar jis prakaar yah asiddh he ki sha se unnati karte-karte sabhy dasha ko praapt hui he
 Man, such a creature was born once in the beginning of the creation itself, in the same way it is also imperfect that religion, knowledge and civilization among the human race was as much or more than it is in the primitive times
 aadhunik mat yah he ki manushya jati asabhy da dhire-dhire us gyaan kii vruddhi hoti gayi he
 Similarly, religion was also very simple and simple in the past, with the growth of social practices, it also developed in many ways
 aage unhone dharm ke bare main or bhi spashtataa se kaha he ki lokvyavahaar or samaajavikas kii drushti se hi dharm or aachaar kii vyakhya kii gayi he, paralok or aadhyatm kii drushti se nahin
 We can be accused of good and evil in the conduct we conduct towards others
 vyavhaar-sambandh se hi kramshah sadasadvivek buddhi utpann hui he
 In these statements, what Acharya Shukla has said about social behavior or behavior relations is the revelation that civilization and religion have developed within the society
 usee ke kaaran hua he usase alag rahakar nahin
 It is not possible to develop any civilization and culture apart from society
 spashtatah yah bhautikwaadi drushti kaa izhaar he
 Since the matter is about religion which has been considered to be an essential relation to supernaturalism, Acharya Shukla supports it by re-mentioning the ecological belief of evolutionism, according to the interpretation of evolutionism, religion is not a supernatural, continual and free substance
 samaaj ke aashray se hi uskaa kramshah vikaas hua he
 No such common feature of religion can be said which has been valid ever since mankind originated everywhere and all the time
 samaaj kii jyon-jyon vruddhi hoti gayi tyon-tyon dharm kii bhaavana main bhi deshkalanusaar pherfr hota gaya
 There was a time when one clan considered it better to steal or snatch the women of another clan
 devataaon kii vediyon par nar-bali dene main kisi ke rongte khadey nahin hote the
 There are many references to it in the Bible, an example being the Vedic saga of Shunahshep
 sankshep main kahen to acharya shukla kii vishwa-drushti paralokwaadi na hokar lokwaadi thi, jiske nirmaan main dharm or bhavvaadi darshan se adhik vaigyanik anusandhan or chintan kaa yoga tha
 His vision, which is constantly evolving, is expressed in his social political, cultural and literary thinking
 'vishwa prapanch' hindi anuwaad vidha kaa pathpradarshak he | == bahari kadiyaan== The entire human civilization was considered to be developing
 unhone likhaa he ki is siddhanth ke anusaar jis prakaar yah asiddh he ki sha se unnati karte-karte sabhy dasha ko praapt hui he
 Man, such a creature was born once in the beginning of the creation itself, in the same way it is also imperfect that religion, knowledge and civilization among the human race was as much or more than it is in the primitive times
