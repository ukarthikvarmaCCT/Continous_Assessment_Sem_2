 is aatmakathy main kuch hatyaron, luteron, daakuon tathaa krur, swaarthee vyasanadhin aparaadhiyon kaa jivan-chitra ukera gaya he
 Apart from this, there are two such cases in which these topics have been discussed that our national language should be Sanskriti Hindi and Hinduisation of non-hindus is necessary
 ‘meraa aaajeevan karawas’ main ‘baalist bhar hindu rajya-os kaa ek moti’ jaisi sankalpana kaa bhi samavesh he
 After the book was translated into Gujarati, some British administrators banned the book titled 'my life imprisonment' on 17 April 1934
 is pratibandh ko hataane kaa prayaas jari rakhte hue bhi yah jyon-kaa-tyon rah gaya
 However, Savarkar wrote a novel titled 'kala Pani', in order to illustrate how annoying, hot, inhuman and abusive life is necessary in Andaman's prison
 agast 1936 se ‘manohar’ patrika main prakashit ho gaya
 The story of the novel 'kala Pani' is not fiction or concoction
 vah ek dandit ke nyaayalayan abhiyog par aadhaarit he
 Such is mentioned in the comments of Veer Savarkar
 yadhyapi rafiuddin, yogaanand, malti aadi naam kaalpanik hai, tathaapi ve ukt abhiyogantak mul naamon se milte-julate hi hai
 In between, noted singer and screen producer Mr
 Sudhir Phadke wanted to prepare a screen on this novel, but the Board of Controllers requested that the Muslim character named Rafiuddin should be changed
 uske anusaar namaatar kii anugna kii maang jab vir saavarkar se kii gai tab unhone spasht tathaa thos shabdon main kaha, ‘‘is tarah namataran kii arthath muslim naam hataakar hindu naam kaa samavesh karne ke liye main kadaapi anumati nahin doongaa
 To pretend that some Muslims are of noble, saintly nature, but i will not give permission to change the Muslim name
 ’’ The novel presented presents the character of a freedom fighter who was punished in the freedom struggle of 1857

 This warrior is not product of concoctions

 Even at this age, he used to keep ripe paan there and he had secret contact with Savarkar
 saavarkar ke saath unki saath-gaanth thi
 Savarkar has commented on some reviews of this novel
 unhone is baat par bhi gaur kiya he ki isamen se koun se vaakya ‘manohar’ patrika ne nikaal die hai
 They may have been removed at that time because of two or three such sentences appearing to be obscene
 saavarkar ke sahitya main kamya athwa graamy ashleelata durlabh hi he, tathaapi acharya atre tathaa pro fadake jaise diggajon main jo vivaad hua tha usamen pron
 fadake ne yah kaha tha ki acharya fadake ke sahitya kii hameshaa yah kahkar aalochana karte hai ki usamen ashleel, bibhats prasangon kaa chithran kiya jaataa he, parantu saavarkar ke saahityantargat tatsam varnanon ke sambandh main ve kabhi chun tak nahin karte, na hi koi fachchar adaate hai
 Explaining this statement of Prof
 Phadke, Acharya Atre says, "while reading the episode of Phadke-narrated rape, there is a desire in the mind of the reader to criticize someone in the same way
 parantu saavarkar-varnit balaatkaar ke prasang padhate samay krodh se khun khaulane lagata he or yah utkar ichha utpann hoti he ki us balaatkaari paapi, chandal par sau-sau kode barasaakar uski chamadi udhede, use kathor-se-kathor dand den
 "A reader in connection with this novel is Mr
 Vachasundar Sonmoh, Ta

 The Wadhwani Foundation is a charitable organization founded by Ramesh Wadhwani
 is sanghathan kaa uddeshy bharat tathaa anya udiyaman arthvyavasthaaon kii aarthik pragati ko tej karnaa he
 Khesar is a village in Aurangabad district of Magadh division under Bihar state of India
 channpur arriya main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat purnia mandal ke arriya jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The word church is a corruption of the Greek adjective literally meaning "of the Lord"
 vastav main carch do arthon main prayukt he; ek to prabhu kaa bhawan arthath girjaghar tathaa doosraa, isaayiyon kaa sanghathan
 In addition to the church, the term 'congregation' also operates
 yah unani bible ke 'eklesia' shabd kaa vikrut rup he; bible main iskaa arth he - kisi sthanvishesh athwa vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon kaa samudaay
 Later this word started being used for the church as well
 yahan par sanstha ke arth main carch par vichaar kiya jaayga
 All Christians often agree that Jesus established only one church, but the unity of Christians could not remain intact for many reasons
 falswaroop aajkal unke bahut se carch athwa sanghathan vartmaan hai jo ek duusare se purnataya swatantra hai
 They can be classified as follows: isai dharm kii praarambhik shatabdiyon main carch kii paribhaasha tathaa uske swaroop ke vishay main apekshaakrit kam chintan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the description of the biography and teachings of Jesus in the Bible that from the very beginning Christians believed that Christianity provided the means of salvation for all mankind and for this purpose established the "kingdom of God" on earth
 
 "ishwar kaa rajya" un logon kaa samudaay he jo isa ke ishwartv par vishwaas kar unki shiksha grahan karte hai
 In the Bible, that community is called "god to the people"
 uske sanghathan tathaa shashan ke liye isa ne 12 shishyon ko chunakar unhen vishesh shikshan tathaa adhikaar die or aadesh diya ki ve duniya bhar main jaakar unki shiksha kaa prachaar karen tathaa vishwaas karanevaalon ko baptism sanskaar karke carch main sammilit kar len
 Thus, in the Bible, the community of followers of Jesus is called the church, "the kingdom of God" and "the people of God"
 in padon se aisa prathit ho saktaa he ki prarambh main carch ke vaastavik rup ko bahari sanghathan tak simit mana gaya he, kintu aisi baat nahin he
 Jesus has emphasized in his teaching that there is invisible and mystical unity between him and his true followers
 unhone apane shishyon se kaha- "main draksha lata hoon or tum daaliyaan ho
 "this makes it clear that the most important element of the church is spiritual
 sant paulus ne carch ke is aadhyatmik tathaa rahasyatmak paksh par bahut bal diya he
 In his letters, he has repeatedly called the Church "the spiritual body of Christ" to illustrate the spiritual connection of Jesus and his true followers and the mysterious unity of all followers of Jesus
 at: prarambh hi se carch ke bahari sanghathan tathaa uske aadhyatmik swaroop, donaan kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 When the Church broke out due to Protestant religion, the religious people began to think more about the nature of the church
 protestant vidvan carch ke adrishy swaroop par or pratikriyaswaroop katholic dharmapandit carch ke bahari sanghathan, uski drishy sadsyta aadi par adhik bal dene lage
 In this controversy, he has given more importance to the four external characteristics of the church
 isa kaa sachcha carch katholic he ; ek he, prem ke bandhan main ek hokar uske sabhi sadsy ek se dharmasiddhanton par vishwaas karte hai
 One accepts the sacrament, the same worshiping ritual and the rule of the same goddess; Is holy; Has apposles carch ke drishy sanghathan main kuch aise log bhi sammilit ho sakate hai jo paakhandee hai, jinka isa ke saath koi aadhyatmik sambandh nahin he, jo isa ke aadhyatmik sharir ke ang nahin hai
 God only knows who is a true member of the church and for this reason it can be assumed that the real church is invisible
 phir bhi us adrishy vaastavik carch kii purna sadsyta kii anivaary shart bahari sanskaar hi hai, at: adrishy carch se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays, almost all Protestants also believe this
 mukti ke liye carch kii purna sadsyta apekshit hote hue bhi anivaary nahin he
 God wants the salvation of all people and produces inspiration in the conscience of all human beings
 jo ishwar kii prerana par chalate hai ve anjaane hi adrishy rup se carch ke apurna sadsy ban jate hai or isa dwaara pradutt mukti praapt kar sakate hai
 After the Second World War, the movement for unity of the Church in the Christian world began to be given more importance
 falswaroop khandan-mandan ko chhodkar bible main vidyaman tatwon ke aadhaar par carch ke vaastavik rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke prayaas main isapar apekshaakrit adhik bal diya jane laga ki carch isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir he
 Jesus is its head and true Christians are parts of that body

 isa kii mrityu ke baad unke shishy yahudiyon tathaa gaiyr yahudiyon main isai dharm kaa prachaar karne lage
 The most successful of the first missionaries was Saint Paul; a description of his travels and his letters are preserved in the latter part of the Bible
 us samay antiok roman samrajya kaa teesraa shahar tha, is kaa uttaradhikari sant petrus yaheen chale aae or us centre se sant paulus ne asia miner, maasedonia tathaa yunaan main isai dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Later the capital Rome became the principal center of Christianity
 vahiin sant petrus or sant paulus shahid ho gaye
 The latter half of the Bible was written in the late first century AD
 san 100 i

 By the end of the third century Christianity had spread to all the cities of the vast Roman Empire; At the same time many people in Persia and South Russia also became Christians
 is safalataa ke kai kaaran hai
 One, there was strong religion among the people at that time, secondly Christianity taught the importance of every human being, whether he was a slave or a woman
 iske atirikt isaayiyon main jo bhaatrubhaav tha usase log prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake
 2
 The greatest feature of the history of the first three centuries is that at the time, the Christians were persecuted by the rulers and instead of giving up their religion in large numbers, they accepted blasphemy and death
 yadhyapi roman shaasha prarambh hi se us nae dharm ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte the or uske anuyaayiyon ko sataate the, phir bhi keval teesri shatabdi main isai dharm ko purna rup se mitaane kaa dhyaapak praytn kiya gaya tha, vishesh rup se desius, dyoklishan, muskiminian or gallarius ke shasankaal main 
 3
 The organization was as follows: In every city, the local church clergyman was called the bishop, under his rule the priest and deputy priest were engaged in religious activities
 rome, sikandriy, antiok main bishpon ko petriark kii oopaadhi di jaati thi kintu sarvatra rome ke bishap kaa vishesh adhikaar mana jaataa tha
 4
 Early Christian literature is written primarily in the Greek language
 origen or sant ireneyas vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Irenaeus, opposing the then misleading assumptions, declared the teaching of the Roman Church to be the test of true Christian teaching
 unhone adhiktar isai goongyaanavaad kaa khandan kiya
 Gnosticism had been going on since before Christ but later it incorporated Christian elements
 us vaad kaa moolbhoot siddhant he ki samast bhautik jagat or maanavsharir bhi dooshit he
 In one way or the other, this theory survived for centuries
 uttari africa ke nivasee teratulian latin bhashaa ke pratham vikhyath isai lekhak hai
 By the end of the second century, Christian literature in Syriac language began to be built around Edessa

 At that time unrest began to spread in the Christian world due to the belief of Arius
 use dur karne ke uddeshy se konstantin ne cotholic carch kii pratham vishwasabha kaa aayojan kiya; nikia kii is sabha ne orius ke mat ke virodh main ghoshit kiya ki isa vaastavik arth main ishwar hai
 The successors of Constantine favored the followers of Arius, resulting in a chaos in the East Catholic Church for nearly 50 years that the church there was never freed from the ill effects
 us shatabdi ke ant main pratham vaastavik isai samrat theodosius ne isai dharm ko rajdharm ke rup main ghoshit kiya; unhone orius ke anuyaayiyon kaa niyantran bhi kiya or us uddeshy se kunstutunia main katholic carch kii dwitiya vishwasabha kaa aayojan kiya
 The World Assembly was convened twice more in the fifth century

 The World Assembly of Ephesus removed Nestorius and declared his followers excommunicated, resulting in the separation of the Persian Church

 In opposition to this view, the world body of Kalacedon has considered both God and manhood as real in Jesus

 Later Islam seized Syria and Egypt from the empire and most of the people there joined that new religion

 The result was that the seekers living in the same place accepted the rule of the same officer

 Following this, a large number of men and women monasteries were established in Palestine, Syria and Asia Minor, and in the fifth century, such monasteries were established in cities like Alexandria, Antioch, Kuntuntania
 unamem praaia: sant basil kii niyamavali sweekrut thi
 In the west, Saint Martin first established a monastery in the south of France in 360 AD, and from the same center Christianity was preached in all the French countryside because by that time only the countryside of Italy and North Africa had become Christian

 Saint Benedict also founded a religion and wrote a manual for monastic life, which was accepted by almost all the monasteries of Europe
 bennediktin sangh ke sanyasi isa kii chhathi shatabdi main england bheje gaye 
 They assimilated the castes there into Christianity and established monasteries of their association

 Sometime later, there was a new invasion of the Lombard race on Italy

 The system was funded by the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs
 in vidyalayon ko isai charchon dwaara prashasit kiya jaataa tha
 The main policy designed to connect Canadian native people to Canadian society was to only harm their mother tongue and culture

 But the teachers there had banned their languages completely

 Those who forget their mother tongue completely are unable to communicate with their family members, as their families are unable to speak English or French

 Rasa is the quality that generates understanding between the artist and the tenor
 sabdika str par ras kaa matlab vah he jo chakhaa ja sake yaa jiskaa anand liya ja sake
 In the sixth text of the Natya Shastra, the author Bharata writes in Sanskrit "vibhabanubhava vyabhichari saayogichari nishpathihi" meaning the union of vibhava, experience and adulteration produces juice
 jis prakaar log swaadisht khaanaa, jo ki masaale, chaaval or anya chizo kaa bana ho, jis ras kaa anubhav karte he or khush hote he usee prakaar sthaayee bhav or anya bhaavon kaa anubhav karke ve log harsh or santosh se bhar jate he
 This feeling is then called 'natya Ras'
 kuch logo kii raay he ki ras or bhav kii uthta unke milan ke saath hoti he
 But this is not true, because the cook is born with emotions, but the spirit is not born of the cook
 isi kaaran ke liye bhaavo ko raso kaa mul mana jaataa he
 Just as the taste or juice can be made with spices, vegetables and good, in the same way juice can be made with permanent expressions and other expressions and there is no permanence which does not increase the juice and likewise, permanence, effect, feeling and adulteration Emotion leads to growth of juice
 bhav darshak ko arth detaa he
 He is called Bhavya because it brings the subject of the poem, physical activity and mental feelings to the audience
 bhav 'bhavitha' 'vasita' or 'prakritha' jaise shabdon se nirmit he jiskaa arth he hona | Impact is the cause or cause or motivation
 use isiilie vibhaav kehete hai kyonki yah vachan sharir, ishaaron or maansik bhaawanaaon kaa vivaran karte hai
 There are two types of effects: yah bhav kii nirmaan kaa mukhya kaaran hota he
 When the emotion takes shape due to a man or an object or a deed, it is called an eclipse effect
 jab kisi vastu bhaavana ko uttejit karata he jaise gun, karrwai, sajaavat, vaataavaran aadi
 Which originates from sentence and disguise is called Anubhav
 yah vibhaav kaa parinami he
 These are emotional feelings expressed by a person
 anumaan ke chaar prakaar hote hai
 Satvik, somatic, mental and imperative
 sthaayee bhav se ras kaa janm hota he | jo bhaavana sthir or saarvbhaum hoti he use sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 Influence experiences and adultery are subject to permanent feelings
 isiilie sthaayee bhav mukhya banataa he
 Permanent emotion is made up of emotions and adultery is ancillary
 When permanent adulterous combination is combined with emotion and experience, juice is formed
 The Natyasastra states that "a good taste is produced when different spices are mixed together, by the way
 The taste of the juice increases with the same lasting price
 " yah gaur kaa baat he kii bhav bhavukta ke utpaadan main ek mukh bhaag karata he
 Juice cannot be produced without emotion
 In this way, the permanent sense is in the name of juice
 The permanent sense is 8
 kuch lok ' sam' bhi iske saath jodte he | Leading another thing or thought of juice is called communicable emotion

 These 8 rasos were promulgated by Brahma
 un ras he One more juice with these cooks
 Shat Ras was the contribution of Bharata
 | Out of these 9 juices, 4 juices are original juices
 They are - Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas
 From these four primordial juices, the remaining 9 juices have emerged
 shringaar se hasya kaa udbhav, raudra se karun kaa utbhav, vir se adbhut kaa utbhav or vibhats se bhayanak kaa udbhav hota he
 Some colors are also being used to describe the juice
 rang kii taraf har ras ke liye ek ek devtaa bhi hota he
 The sentiment of the dress is produced by a permanent feeling called Rati
 is duniya main jo kuch bhi sud or deeptiman he use shringaar kaha jaataa he
 This feeling is related to men, women and bright youth
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ye purush or stri ke bich pyaar or uske parinamo se sambandh rakhata he
 a very deep understanding is conveyed by this period, Shringar period means beauty
 isliye shringaar lahari ko saundarya lahari bhi kaha jaataa he
 Love is the beauty of man and this love gives him a distinct identity and makes him supreme among all creations
 is ras ke do kursiyaan he; arthath: sgh main pyaar or judaai main pyaar 
 Pleasant weather, garlands, ornaments, people, good houses, enjoyment of pleasures, travel of the garden, hearing and seeing things of beauty, and adornment, etc

 The rasa typana vipralambha is divided into two parts; apane priyatam se milane ke pehale, abhinaytri ki dasha ko ayogy vipralambh kaha jaataa he
 This is seen in the "enchanted heroine", for example: Parvati's love for Shiva and Rukmini's love for Krishan before marriage
 ayogy vipralambh ke mukhya taur par das tarikon se dikhaaya ja saktaa he, jaise ki: There are two types of adversity: separation arising from lack and separation arising from dissatisfaction
 abhaav se utpann hone vaali judaai ko pravaas kaha jaataa he, yah proshitpriy naamak abhinaytri main dekha gaya he
 Separation arises from dissatisfaction, between two lovers who do not want to see each other or wish to have each other

 Electrical circuits are formed by connecting many electrical or electronic components or components
 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity
 kahin par 24 volt kii jarurat ho to 12 volt vaali do badariyon ko shreneekram main jodakar 24 volt praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components
 It depends
