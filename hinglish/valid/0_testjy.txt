 krupa sharma ek nainital main rahane vaali ladki he, jise sangeet ke saath-saath mumbai main rahane vaale angad khanna se bahut adhik pyaar he
 She goes to Mumbai to meet Angad
 krupa or angad ke parivaar vaale puraane mitra he, jiske kaaran krupa mumbai main unke hi ghar par rukati he
 But could not meet Angad
 angad ke daadi ke alaava sabhi parivaar vaale usase bura vyavhaar karte he
 When Kripa meets Angad, he finds her a very bad person
 vah sangeet ke taiyaari karte samay bhi usase bura vyavhaar karata he
 And Krupa slaps her as well as refuses to schedule
 lekin use kaarykram karnaa padataa he
 After this, both Kripa and Angad start hating each other
 iske baad bhi vah kaarykram bahut lokapriy ho jaataa he
 One night Kripa and Prithvi's family decide their marriage
 lekin angad krupa ko bataata he ki vah use pyaar karata he
 And for this reason, Kripa refuses to marry
 isi ke saath krupa or angad kii prem kahani shuru hoti he
 But many people do not like this relationship
 jaise: naina khanna, mishti or prithvi ko
 Naina looks at Angad by making some false evidence to remove him from Angad's life
 vah aisa dikhaati he ki krupa prithvi se prem karti he or angad se keval paison ke liye hi shaadi ki he
 Knowing this, Angad breaks all relations with Kripa and decides to marry Mishti
 krupa angad ke bachche ko janm dene vaali thi or is kaaran vah angad se dur chali gai lekin ek ghatana ke kaaran vah baccha batch nahin paaya
 Angad's grandmother tells Angad that the evidence given by her mother is all false
 jab sachai pataa chalati he to angad or mishti ke shaadi ke din hi vah shaadi tod detaa he
 But there, Kripa considers Angad responsible for all this and decides to ruin him
 angad yah maanata he ki vah krupa se bahut pyaar karata he or vah apane mitra josh ko krupa kii madad karne ke liye bolta he
 With which Krupa became a popular and successful singer
 vahiin angad ek asafal gayak ban gaya
 Then Josh tells Krupa that it was because of this that she became a successful singer
 yah jaan kar krupa use maaf kar detii he or use punah safal banane ke liye vah uske saath kaarykram ke liye bhi maan jaati he
 But Kripa decides to marry her friend Prithvi, who assisted her all the time
 vahiin angad or krupa ke kaarykram ke pashchaat vah donon punah safal or lokapriy ho jate hai
 Then preparations for Kripa and Prithvi's wedding begin and Josh convinces Kripa that she is in love with Angad
 angad or krupa ko milaane ke liye prithvi shaadi tod detaa he
 After this, Krupa and Angad become one
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat angad par koi jaanaleva hamalaa karne ki koshish karata he
 Kripa feels that this work is of passion
 yah baat vah angad ko bataati he
 This creates some distance between Angad and Josh, but he resolves the matter
 uske baad josh kahata he ki yah kaary prithvi ne krupa ke na rahete samay kiya he
 But he kills the Earth
 uske maut kaa izzaam angad par aa jaataa he
 Kripa considers her innocent and chooses K's lawyer for the episode
 lekin simon krupa ko yah vishwaas dilaati he ki angad ke jhootha vyakti he
 Kripa also finds her guilty and testifies against her in court
 jiske kaaran angad jail chalaa jaataa he or saath hi angad kaa dil bhi tut jaataa he
 a year later, Kripa marries Prithvi in dubai
 tabhi vahaan use ek angad ke jaise dikhne vaala ek vyakti daraata he
 But no one believes that Angad is in Dubai
 prithvi mumbai police se angad ke bare main pataa karata he to pataa chalata he ki angad ko duusare jail main le jate samay durghatana hone ke kaaran uski maut ho gai
 Kripa became a pillar after hearing this
 iske baad bhi vah angad se pyaar karti thi
 Then he meets Zaib, a singer
 angad bhi zib ban kar un sabhi se miltaa he
 But he shows that he is a zaib and everyone tries to believe it
 lekin zib krupa ke saamne yah maanata he ki vah angad hi he or jail se durghatana se batch kar vah bhaag niklaa tha
 He was torturing her mentally due to sending her to jail with kindness
 vah mumbai main mishti se sagaai kar letaa he, jisase vah bose parivaar ke nikat aa sake
 He was very close to breaking the marriage of earth and grace
 tabhi krupa angad ke saamne uske pati prithvi ke saath sone kaa naatak karti he
 Which makes Angad angry and opens his last leaf and says that there is Zaib / Angad and he is already married with Kripa
 iske baad prithvi krupa ke saath shaadi tod detaa he
 Angad asks Kripa to get married and they both marry each other, so that they can destroy each other
 krupa angad ko punah prakaran ke dwaara jail bhejne ke liye usee josh ke prakaran ko khulawaati he
 Angad says that he had confessed to the crime because of Kripa's statement
 or angad ke mitra krupa ke saamne sachai saamne laate hai, ki mishti use jhooth boli thi
 Josh's real killer is then revealed
 vah koi or nahin prithvi hi tha jisane angad ko jaan se maarane ki koshish ki or josh ke saamne sach pataa chal gaya tha
 Due to this he also killed Josh
 yah sab adaalat main sabit hone ke baad prithvi bhaagta he or police ke goli ke kaaran coma main chale jaataa he
 Angad is released from court and he again begins a life of love with Kripa
 mishti apane bhai prithvi kaa badla lene ke liye angad par balaatkaar kaa prakaran darj karti he lekin yah prakaran angad jeet jaataa he
 But at the time of this episode, Kripa does not believe Angad and therefore he does not forgive him this time
 krupa angad kaa ghar chhod kar chale jaati he
 She starts working with Nishant Saxena, a businessman
 angad krupa ki sari yaadon ko apane se dur kar detaa he or ek safal gayak ban jaataa he
 Nishant associates his business with Angad and hence he moves to Mumbai with grace
 krupa kaa aana angad ko bahut bekaar lagata he
 After this, Krupa's engagement is with Nishant and Angad's engagement with Kanan
 iske baad angad ko pataa chalata he ki pratik uskaa betaa he
 And when he realizes all the truth, he asks Krupa to marry again
 lekin krupa shaadi se inkaar kar detii he
 Because Nishant's mother has heart disease and she wants to see Nishant and Kripa getting married
 parantu baad main angad ko pataa chalata he ki vah shaadi keval dikhaane ke liye hui thi
 Nishant gets to know Angad and Kripa's previous time and tries to reconcile them
 isliye vah krupa ko lekar dubai angad ke paas jaataa he or tabhi krupa ke paas kol aata he ki angad ki hatya hone vaali he
 Nishant tells Angad about this
 lekin vah ek saarvajanik kaarykram main gane ke liye jaataa he or vahaan goli chalati he lekin angad ko bachaane ke liye vahaan nishanth aa jaataa he
 But he is shot and he dies
 yah hamalaa or kisi ne nahin balki angad ke pita ne hi ki hoti he
 Kripa then returns to Mumbai and Angad waits for his arrival in Dubai
 saath hi vah nishanth ke parivaar ki dekhbhaal bhi karata rahata he
 Coincidentally, he is reunited by Nishant and Angad's family and they never separate after that
 iske baad krupa or angad kaa doosraa baccha janm letaa he
 After this all live happily and the last part of the story ends

 The dodo was a local bird from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius
 yah pakshi varg main hote hue bhi thalchar tha, kyonki isame udne kii kshamta nahin thi
 By the end of the 17th century, this bird became extinct due to excessive hunting by humans
 yah pakshi kabutar or phakhta ke parivaar se sambandhit tha
 It was about one meter high and 20 kg in size
 iske kai dum hoti thim
 It built its nest on the ground, and its diet included local fruits
 dodo murgi se bade aakaar kaa baari-bharkam, golmatol pakshi tha
 Its legs were short and weak, which could not handle its weight
 iske pankh bhi bahut hi chote the, jo dodo ke udne ke liye paryaapt nahin the
 Because of this it could neither run fast nor fly
 rang-birange dodo jhund main ludhakte-girte chalate the, to sthaneey logon kaa manoranjan hota tha
 The word dodo is derived from the Portuguese word dowodo, meaning fool or mad
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone dodo pakshi ko mughal darbar main bhi pesh kiya tha, jahaan ke darbari chitrakaar ne is vicitra or besange pakshi kaa chitra bhi banaaya tha
 According to some zoologists, the flying dodos first lost the ability to fly slowly due to circumstantial reasons
 ab dodo morishas ke rashtriya chihn main dikhataa he
 In addition, the extinction of the dodo is seen as an example of unchanging events caused by human activities
 maanvon ke morishas dweep par aane se purv dodo kaa koi bhi prakritik shikari is dweep par nahin tha
 This is why this bird was not able to fly
 iskaa vyavhaar maanvon ke prati puri tarah se nirbhik tha or apni na ud paane kii kshamta ke kaaran yah aasaani se shikaar ban gaya
 When the Dutch first arrived in Mauritius in the early 17th century, there was no human population before
 unhone dodo ko volgvogel kaha, arthath ek vibhats pakshi
 The main reason for this was that even though its meat was very cooked, it did not become soft and tasty
 kintu phir bhi dach log iskaa shikaar karte rahe or antatah 1681 tak dodo is dweep se lupt ho gaya
 There was no one to kill the dodo before humans came here, so the dodo had completely forgotten its defense capability
 ye itane asahaay siddh hue, ki chuuhe tak inke andey va chuujon ko kha jate the
 Scientists have tried to shape it by re-connecting the bones of the dodo and now this format can be seen at the Mauritius Institute
 unhone shodh kar ke yah bhi kaha he, ki di en e dwaara isaki punarprapti ho sakati he
 Older documents, however, have described its meat as tasteless and harsh, while the taste of other local species such as red rail meat has been appreciated
 saamanytah yah mana jaataa he ki malay navik ise ek pavitra pakshi maanate the or ve dodo kaa shikaar iske paron se dharmik anushthanon me prayukt hone vaale apane topon ko banane me kiya karte the
 According to some experts, Dodo, who had known flying before, had forgotten to fly due to some circumstantial reasons
 unki ye aadat va aalsee swabhaav hi unke vinaash kaa kaaran ban gaya, kyonki ve aasaani se kute billiyon ke haath lag jate the
 Thus by 1640 the Dodo became completely extinct
 ise antim baar landan main 1638 main jivit dekha gaya tha
 There is also a fact that, when humans first arrived in Mauritius, they also brought with them animals previously not found on the island, such as dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaque monkeys
 in pashuon ne dodo ke ghonslon ko nasht kar diya, jabaki manushyo ne yahan ke jangalon kaa naash kiya jahaan pakshi rahete the
 Nowadays it is believed that animals like pigs and maize are more responsible for the extinction of dodo than hunting

 kalawaad ko sahitya evam kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ke vilom ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This theory was formulated by Victor Couze in 1818
 iske anusaar kala kaa uddeshy kisi naitik yaa dharmik uddeshy kii prapti nahin balki swany apane purnataa kii talash he
 Art is the carrier of aesthetics, so it should not be judged as a test of utility
 samaaj, niti, dharm, darshan aadi ke niyamon kaa paalan kala kii svachhand tathaa swatah sfoort abhivyakti main baadhak hote hai
 According to Artists, artists are extraterrestrial beings, art objects of art and artistic pleasure are supernatural tasteful and social
 iske vipareet upyogetavaadi kala ko na keval samaaj kii manovritiyaan parivartit karke vaanchit disha kii ore agresharit karne kaa shashakt saadhan maanate hai, apitu use siddhant prachaar kaa sarvottam madhyam bhi bataate hai
 Utilitarians have accused the artisans of being narrow and subjective, saying they are mounted on a pneumatic horse
 kalavaadiyon ne upyogetavaadiyon par sthool saamaajikta kaa agrahi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya or kaha, unhone hamen swarg dene kaa vachan diya tha, lekin diya he ruganalay
 There is also a third class of thinkers who consider the coordination of the individualism of artism and the socialism of utilitarianism beneficial
 kalavaadi drushtikon kii pratyakshapratyaksh satta europe main plato tathaa arestu se lekar aaj tak kisi na kisi rup main lagaataar milti he
 Plato, in his treatise 'republic', has given a system of nationalizing poets and artists; Because, in his view, the immense influence of imaginative artists and poets was undesirable ethically and socially
 arestu ne yadhyapi apane guru plato kii naitik evam saamaajik dharna kaa khule rup main khandan nahin kiya he, saath hi kala main naitik tatv tathaa upadeshaatmakataa bhi unhen amaanya nahin kiya he, to bhi prasiddh kalasmeekshak bujar ke matanusaar arastu ne hi pehle pahal kalashaastra ne nitishastra ko pruthak kiya or bataaya ki parishkrut anandanubhuti hi kavyakala athwa kala kaa charam lakshya hota he
 The famous thinker of Rome, Cicer, has determined decency and sublime to be the chief productions of art
 longinus ne apni kriti 'periipsus' main kala ko na keval shiksha or manoranjan se bhinn evam shreshth mana he balki use samprerana ke ucch dharaatal par pratishthit karke, uske swatantra moolyankan kaa paraamarsh bhi diya he
 According to Longinus, the main elements of poetry and art are sublime and sublimation of emotion is their main result which is directly related to the person as well as the society
 at: apane vaktavy or pratipaadan main longinus nishchit hi madhyamargi hai
 Dionysis and Demetrius Prabhriti Many other Roman thinkers have laid special emphasis on the stylistic aspect of poetry and art
 europe kii shastreey yaa clasical kala kaa pallavan adhikanshat: isai dharm athwa 'carch' ke sarankshan main hua
 Therefore, between the seventh and the 15th century CE, the Roman art that developed from Egypt to Russia, with Rome as the center, was ethically-religious-values-coordinated as a church dependent, so it was necessary to be objective and didactic and that is why There was only secondary accessory in it
 to bhi aisa nahin he ki ukt kaal kii kala main kalpana tathaa bhaawanaaon ke liye koi chhot thi hi nahin
 In contrast, religiously artists used to create high quality art without any external control or compulsion
 talsty kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal virdohi the
 Their lack of faith towards religion gives rise to artistic ideas and art is neither pleasurable nor beauty
 ve naitikta ke prati atyagrahi the or gandhi ji kii tarahat unka drushtikon sudhaarwadi tha
 Reformism is essentially utilitarianism
 at: talsty ke liye kala nishchit hi ek gaun saadhan maatr rahaa
 The great poet of Italy, Aligiari Dante, again reputed the sublime qualities and grand style in the field of art
 dante kaa prabhaav kuch hi din rahaa
 After this, the classical vision gradually came to be covered with romantic view
 falat: is samay kala sambandhi mulyon main baari parivartan hua
 The 17th century can be said to be quite important from the point of view of art
 iske dauraan france main navyashastravaad kaa udai hua
 But this too was no more than a newer version of medieval thought
 renesaan ke baad europe main madhyakaalin naitik mulyon kaa vighatan hona shuru hua jisase paramparawaadi tathaa swatantramulak vichaaron ke bich asthirataa kaa vaataavaran hi utpann nahin hua balki paraspar takaraav bhi hone laga
 The reason for this was the lack of a strong philosophy at this time
 san 1866 i
 ke lagbhag vividh saahitiyik evam kalasambandhi vaadon ke pravartan main agrahi desh france main 'l aart por l aart' sutarakathan saamne aayaa jiskaa angreji anuwaad 'art for arts sek' he or hindi main jise 'kala kala ke liye' vaakyansh se janaa jaataa he
 It is from here that the artistic ideology can be seen as a direct beginning
 amareeki chitrakaar james abot mecnil hvisler, jo aaajeevan france or england main karyrat rahaa, kalawaad kaa prabal samarthak bana
 It was that Ruskin, a noted English critic at the Grosswainer painting exhibition in 1877 AD, sharply criticized the Whistler's paintings, saying that the Whistler poured colorful cups on the faces of the audience through his paintings
 raskni ke is kathan par adaalat main mukadmaa shuru ho gaya jisamen hvisler ko antat: kshatipurti ke rup main ek fading mila
 Even then, there was debate between Ruskin and Hwisler about the purpose of art
 ruskin kala ko naitikta se alag-thalag bilkul swantatra evam swat:purna maanata tha
 Inspired by this, Hwisler, with all his power, enforced the 'kala Kala K' vote which reached the limits of extremism
 breadle, clive bel, roger faai tathaa george inness ityadi pramukh samalochak kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal poshak the
 Bradley explicitly declared in his treatise 'poetry for Poetry's Sec' that morality is the only external aspect of poetry
 at: kavita kii shreshthata ke liye use anivaary maananaa ekadam besujh hai
 Clive Bell considered the motif in the context of modern painting and in 1914 introduced the theory of 'significant Farm' which was revised by Roger Fi in 1920
 kroche ke abhivyanjanawad se kalawaad ko ek suspasht darshanik aadhaar praapt ho gaya
 On the basis of Kant's founding 'beauty has no external existence', Croche in his treatise called 'la Spirito' has given the power of 'inner wisdom' for aesthetics and states that both aesthetics and beauty are subtle mental pursuits
 
 saath hi varnyavastu tathaa abhivyanjana ke bich tathvik ekta hoti he
 Therefore, it is misleading to look at artisanal and objective aspects
 kroche ke anusaar kala mulat: ek aadhyatmik kriya he, isliye uski drushti main abhivyanjana ke atirikt kala ko koi anya uddeshy athwa prayojan nahin hota
 Not only this, Croche also considered art to be free from moral and academic limitations
 dekha jaae to kroche ke siddhant dwaara ek prakaar se upyogetavaadi manyata kaa khandan ho jaataa he, lekin ukt siddhant kala ke amoort vyapaar par hi lagu hota he, moort par nahin
 Kroche's art theory is not essentially anti-social because even if it is tangible, he does not consider art as social
 friid ke 'swapnavaad' se bhi kalavaadi drushti ko kaaphi bal mila
 In his book 'principles of Literary Criticism', IA Richard's, while denouncing the artistic vision on theoretical grounds, gave great importance to the remittance in poetry process and said that the power of poetry is not different from the rest of the world nor does the feeling of poetry The rest is different from the experience of the world
 is prakaar richards ne kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ko pun: pratishtha kii
 The rise of Marxism led to a rapid disintegration of artistic beliefs
 marks ne apane arthshaastra main kala ke prati upyogetavaadi drushtikon apanaaya or kaha ki kala janata ke liye, mukhyat: sainikon or shramikon ke liye hi he
 Stalin considered art and literature in Russia and Mao in China as the main means of propagating politics, and placed a curse on him with power
 maao ne 'prablems ov art and litarechar' sheershak apane paripatr main marks kii uparyukt sthapanaaon ke prati aasthaa vyakt kii he
 Marxist critic Codwell has also termed the artistic ideology as the result of a sickening attitude created by a purely bourgeois view
 marxvaadi kheme main tratski hi ek aisa vyakti he ja kala ke kshetra main raajnneetik party ke hastekshap ko anuchit maanata he
 In his treatise titled 'literature and Revolution', he has clearly stated, there is no need to order the party in the field of art
 yah thik he ki party ke kartavyon main kala kii raksha or uski sahaayta karnaa bhi he, lekin nettrutv us kshetra main aparoksh rup se hi ho saktaa he
 IP here With the study of physiology and psychology presented by scholars like Pavlov, it has finally been decided that art is as useful for the individual and society as other general physical material
 bhartiya sahitya main bhi alankaar, reeti, vakrokti aadi se sambandhit anek aise sampradaay rahe hai jinaki drushti main kalapaksh adhik mahatvapurn tha
 In the modern literature of Hindi, Premchand, Dinkar etc
 were utilitarian, then Prasad adopted a blissful vision which is much closer to artism
 agyeya, mahadevi verma aadi kalavaadi hai to acharya ramchandra shukla, dow hajariprasad dvivedi, doramvilas sharma aadi aalochakon kii drushti vishuddh upyogetavaadi he
 Dr

 us samay kaa bana hua shaasha yajid mana jaataa hai ki dusht or atyachari tha or apni hukumat main gaiyr islamic kaam kiya karata tha, iraq or kufa ke logo ne hazrat imam hossain ko kai khat likh kar kufa aane ko kaha taaki wo unke haathon main bait kar kar ke unhen apana khalipha banaaye lekin yajid chahta tha ki hossain uske saath ho jaaen, vah jaanata tha agar hossain uske saath aa gaye to sara islam uski mutthi main hoga
 Even after a lot of pressure, Hussain refused to accept any of his things, so Yajid planned to stop Hussain

 Hussein did not want to bleed in a holy place like Kaaba, then Imam Hussein changed the intention of Hajj and proceeded towards Kufa
 raste main dushmano kii fouj unhen gher kar karbala le ai
 The land on which Imam Hussain set up his camp in Karbala was first bought by Imam Hussain, and then put up his camp at that place
 yajid apane saradaaron ke dwaara lagaataar imam hossain par dabaav banaata gaya ki hossain uski baat maan len, jab imam hossain ne yajid kii sharten nahin maani, to dushmano ne ant main nahar par fouj kaa paharaa laga diya or hossain ke khemon main pani jane par roak laga di gai
 Seeing the army of Yazid, the people of Kufa Iraq who had called Imam Hussein to make their Khalifa also left
 teen din guzar jane ke baad jab imam ke parivaar ke bachche pyaas se tadapane lage to hossain ne yajidi fouj se pani maanga, dushman ne pani dene se inkaar kar diya, dushmano ne sochaa imam hossain pyaas se tut jaaenge or hamaari sari sharten maan lenge
 When Hussain did not listen to Yajid even after three days of thirst, the enemies started attacking Hussain's camps
 iske baad imam hossain ne dushmano se ek raat kaa samay maanga or us puri raat imam hossain or unke parivaar ne allaah kii ibaadat kii or dua maangate rahe ki meraa parivaar, mere mitra chaahe shahid ho jaae, lekin allaah kaa deen 'islam', jo naanaa lekar aae the, vah bachaa rahe
 On October 10, 680 AD, the battle broke out since the time of Namaz, it would not be right to say that because there was an army of lakhs on the one hand, on the other side there was a family of 72 members and a few men among them, but historians write Jung

 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes

 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion

 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains

 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans

 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction

 Jainism teaches that every living being is responsible for its actions
 It insists that we live, think and act respectfully and honor the spiritual nature of all life
 Jains view God as the unchanging traits of the pure soul of each living being, chiefly described as Infinite Knowledge, Perception, Consciousness, and Happiness 
 Jainism does not include a belief in an omnipotent supreme being or creator, but rather in an eternal universe governed by natural laws, and the interplay of its attributes of matter 
 Jain scriptures were written over a long period and the most cited is the Tattvartha Sutra, or Book of Reality written by Umasvati, the monk-scholar, more than 18 centuries ago
 The primary figures in Jainism are Tirthankars
 Jainism has two main divisions: Digambar and Shvetambar and both believe in ahimsa, asceticism, karma, sansar, and jiva
 Compassion for all life, human and non human, is central toja Jainism
 Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment and to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is unimaginably abhorrent
 It is the only religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian
 Some Indian regions have been strongly influenced by Jains and often, the majority of the local non Jain population has also become vegetarian
 History suggests that various strains of Hinduism became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences
 In many towns, Jains run animal shelters, e

 The cloth over his face is to prevent spit, mucus, or bacteria from the mouth or nose from landing on holy images, books or the idols of the Tirtankars Jainism's stance on nonviolence goes beyond vegetarianism
 Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty
 Many are vegan due to the violence of modern dairy farms
 The orthodox Jain diet excludes most root vegetables, as they believe this destroys life unnecessarily
 Another reason for refusing root vegetables is to avoid destroying entire plants
 If you eat apples, you do not destroy whole trees, but for root vegetables, whole plants are uprooted
 Garlic and onions are avoided as these are seen as creating passion, meaning anger, hatred, jealousy
 Observant Jains do not eat, drink, or travel after sunset and always rise before sunrise
 Anekantavada, a foundation of Jain philosophy literally meaning "nonsingular Conclusivity", or equivalently, "non-one-endedness"
 Anekantavad consists of tools for overcoming inherent biases in any one perspective on a topic, object, process, state, or on reality in general
 Another tool is The Doctrine of Postulation, Syādvāda
 Anekantavad is defined as a multiplicity of views for it stresses looking at things from another's perspective
 Jains are remarkably welcoming and friendly towards other faiths
 Several non-jain temples in India are administered by Jains
 The Jain Heggade family has run the Hindu institutions of Dharmasthala, including the Sri Manjunath Temple, for eight centuries
 Jains willingly donate money to churches and mosques and usually help with interfaith functions
 Jain monks, like Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Sushil Kumar, actively promoted harmony among rival faiths to defuse tension
 Jains have been a palpable presence in Indian culture, contributing to Indian philosophy, art, architecture, sciences, and to Mohandas Gandhi's politics, which led to the mainly non-violent movement for Indian independence

 Camping in the neighborhood, he started teasing people with his freezing fingers
 purvi ilaake main to is satyanashi ne bisiyon logon kii bali lekar tahalaka machaa diya tha, parantu pashchim kii tang galiyon vaale jaal main uski chaal kuch dhimi pad gayi
 Mr
 'pneumonia' did not make any concessions even with women
 kailifornia kii aandhiyon se jiskaa khun fika pad gaya ho, aanse kisi dubli-patali ladki kaa is bhimkaay funkaarte daitya se koi muqabla to nahi tha, fir bhi usne jansi par hamalaa bol diya
 The poor poor man lay quietly on his iron cot and looked at the blank wall of the front brick house from the glass window
 ek din uskaa ilaaj karne vaale buudhe doctor ne, tharmametre jhatakate huye, su ko baahar ke baraamde main bulaakar kaha,"uske jeene kii sambhaavna rupaye main do aana he or, vah bhi tab, yadi uski ichha-shakti bani rahe
 When people do not have the desire to live and they are ready to welcome death, then they cannot even cure them
 is ladki ke dimag par bhoot savaar ho gaya he ki vah ab acchhee nahin hogi
 Is there a burden on his mind? " su boli,"or to kuch nahin, par kisi roj neples kii khadi kaa chitra banane kii uski prabal aakanksha he
 " "chitra? hum! main puch rahaa tha, ki uske jivan main koi aansa aakarshan bhi he ki jisase jeene kii ichha teevr ho? jaise koi noujvaan!" In a stinging voice of a scorpion sting, Suu said, "young man? Men and love-quit too - no doctor sir, there is no such thing
" " The doctor said, "this is the root of all evil
 doctori vidya ke anusaar jo kuch mujhase mumkin he, use kiye bina nahin chhoduunga
 But when a patient starts counting the number of people who walk with their meaning, then the strength of medicines is reduced to half
 agar tum uske jivan main koi aakarshan paidaa kar sako, jisase vaungali sardiyon main prachlit hone vaale kapado ke faishan ke bare main charchaa karne lage, to uske jeene kii sambhaavna kam se kam dooni ho jaayegi
 " doctor ke jane ke baad su apane kamare main gayi or usne ro-ro kar kai roomaal nichodne kaabil kar diye
 After a while, carrying the painting material, she arrives at Janci's room whistling
 jansi, chaddar odhe, chupchaap, bina hile-dule, khidki kii ore dekhati padi thi
 Knowing him asleep, he stopped whistling
 takhte par kaagaj lagaakar vah kisi patrika kii kahani ke liye, kalam syaahi se ek tasviir banane baithi
 In order to reach the stage of 'kala', budding artists have to make photographs for magazines
 jaise sahitya kii manzil tak pahunchane ke liye, navdith lekhakon ko patrikaon kii kahaniyaan likhni padatihai
 As soon as Su, wearing breezes like a horseman, wearing an eyeglass, began drawing lines of an Idaho shepherd's image, he heard a slow sound repeated several times
 vah sheeghra hi biimaar ke bistare ke paas gayi
 Jansi's eyes were wide open
 vah khidki se baahar dekh rahi thi or kuch ginati bol rahi thi
 But she is chanting in reverse
 vah boli,"baarah" fir kuch der baad "gyaarah" fir "das" or "nau" or tab ek saath "aath" or "saat"
 Soo glanced out of the window, eagerly
 vahaan ginaney laayak kya tha
 An open, barren square or a blank wall of a brick house twenty feet away! ek puraani, shanthi hui, jade nikali hue,
 sadabahaar kii bel diwaar kii aadhi oonchai tak chadhi hui thi
 Shishir's cold breath had broken the leaves of his body and his skeletal branches, utterly oblivious, were hanging from those broken bricks
 su ne poocha,"kya he jaani?" Jansi said in very slow voices, "six! Now she is falling fast
 teen din pehle vahaan kareeb ek sau tha
 He used to hurt them by counting their heads
 vah, ek or giri
 Now only five left
 " "five what? Jani, five what? Tell your sou!" "pattiyaan
 The leaves of that vine
 jis vakt aakhri pattee giregi, main bhi chali jaaoongi
 i have known this for three days
 kya doctor ne tumhen nahin bataaya?" With great disdain, Soo complained, "oh! i have never seen anything so stupid
" tere thik hone kaa in pattiyon se kya sambandh he? tu us bail se pyaar kiya karti thi-kyon isliye? badmaash! apni bevakoofi band kar! abhi subah hi to doctor ne bataaya tha ki tere jaldi se thik hone kii sambhaavna-thik kin shabdo main kahaan tha-haa, kaha tha, sambhaavna rupaye main chaudaa aana he or neuyark main, jab ham kisi taxi main baithte hai yaa kisi nayi imaarat ke paas se guzarate hai, tab bhi jeene kii sambhaavna isse aadhik nahin rahati
 Now try to drink a little broth and let your soo make a picture, so that by selling it to the editor, he can get some medicine for his sick girl and some bread and water for his own stomach
 " Jansi said keeping her eyes outside the window, "you don't need to bring alcohol for me anymore
 vah, ek or giri
 No, i don't even need broth
 ab sirf chaar rah gayin
 Before i get dark, i can see that last leaf falling - that's all
 fir main bhi chali jaaoongi
 " su us par jhukati hui boli,'pyaari jansi! tuje pratigya kerani hogi ki tu ankhe band rakhegi or jab tak main kaam karti hum, khidki se baahar nahin dekhegi
 This picture has to be delivered by tomorrow
 mujhe roshni kii jarurat he, varna abhi khidki band kar detii
 " jansi ne ruukhaai se poocha,"kya tum duusare kamare main baithkar tasviren nahin ban sakati?" Soo said, "I must stay with you
" iske alaava, main tuje us bel kii taraf dekhne dena nahin chaahati
 " kisi giri hui murti kii tarah nishchal or safed, apni aakhe band karti hui, jansi boli,"kaam khatm hote hi mujhe bol dena, kyoking main us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Now i want to loosen my grip and let it float down and down like those tired leaves
 " Soo said, "you trying to sleep
" main khan main majdoor kaa model banane ke liye us beharman ko bula laati hum
 Now, it came in a minute
 jab tak main nahin launtun, tu hilanaa mat!" The old Behrman lived in a room under him
 vah bhi chitrakaar tha
 He was over sixty years old
 uski dadhi, maaykele angelo kii tasviir ke mojes kii dadhi kii tarah, kisi badashakl bandar ke sir se kisi bhoot ke sharir tak laharaati maaloom padati thi
 Beraham was a failed artist
 chalis varsho se vah sadhana kar rahaa tha, lekin abhi tak apni kala ke charan bhi nahin chhu sakaa tha
 While making every picture, he would think that it would be his masterpiece, but could never make it like that
 idhar kai varsho se usne vyavsaayik yaa vigyaapan-chitra banane ke sivaay, yah dhandha hi chhod diya tha
 Being a Mandal for young artists who could not pay the fees of a professional Mandal, he used to fill his stomach nowadays
 vah jarurat se zyada sharaab pi letaa or apni us utkrasht krati ke vishay main bakawaas karata jiske sapane vah sanjota tha
 By the way, he was a very old man who used to make fun of meek men and would think of himself as the guard dog of these two young artists
 su ne beharman ko apane andhere adde main padaa paaya
 The smell of plum was coming out of it
 ek kone main vah kora canvaas khadaa tha, jo uski utkrasht kalakrati kii pahili rekha kaa ankan paane kii, pachchis varsho se baat joh rahaa tha
 He tells the old man how Jansi, fearfully imagining his leaves to be swayed by associating them with those soft bodies like his leaves, thinks that his grip on the world will be loosened
 buudhe beharman ne in murkh kalpanaaon par gusse se ankhe nikaal kar apana tiraskaar vyakt kiya
 He said, "what did you say? Are there even such fools in the world, who just because they are falling leaves with a bruised vine, imagine themselves dead? i have never heard such a thing! i am a fool like you
 Can never be a model for crazy people
 tumne uske dimag main is baat ko ghusane hi kaise diya? are, bichaari jansi!" Suu said, "she has become very weak due to illness and due to fever, such strange fantasies have arisen in her mind
 acha; buudhe beharman, tum agar mere liye model nahin bananaa chaahate to mat bano
 After all, it's the owl's tail! " berahaman chillaaya,"tu to ladki kii ladki hi rahi! kisne kaha ki main model nahin banuunga? chal, main tere saath chalata hum
 i have been whining for half an hour that i will walk! But let me say one thing - this place is not fit for a good girl like Jansi to die
 kisi din jab mai apni utkrasht kalakrati bana luungaa tab ham sab yahaan se chal chalenge
 Understand? Yes! " jab ve log upar pahunche to jansi so rahi thi
 Soo dropped the curtains on the windowsill and took Behrman to another room
 vahaan se unhone bhaybheet drashti se khidki ke baahar us bel kii ore dekha
 Then they, without uttering a single word, looked at each other
 apane saath barf liye huye thandi barsaat lagaataar gir rahi thi
 a kettle was turned upside down and Behrman was placed in a blue shirt to make it the model of a mine worker sitting on a rock
 ek ghante kii neend ke baad jab duusare din subah, su kii aankh khuli to usne dekha ki jansi jad hokar, khidki ke hare parde kii ore ankhe faad kar dekh rahi he
 In a tone of fury, he ordered, "raise the curtain, i want to see
 " Su was helpless and had to obey
 lekin yah kya! raat bhar varsha, aandhi toofaan or barf girane par bhi into kii diwaar se lagi hui, us bel main ek pattee thi
 Some dark green near her stalk, but pale yellow around its edges and anticipating further loss, the leaf was some twenty feet high from the ground yet hanging from its branch
 jansi ne kaha," yahi aakhri he
 i thought it would fall in the night
 mainen toofaan kii aawaaj bhi suni
 Well, never mind it will fall today and i will die at the same time
 " Tilting her tired face on the pillow, Soo said, "what does she say! Take care of me, if not your own! What shall i do?" par jansi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 The lonely thing in this world is this 'soul', when it prepares to go on its mysterious long journey
 jyon-tyon sansar or mitrataa se baandhne vaale uske bandhan dhile padate gayi tyon-tyon uski kalpana ne use adhik jor se jakadna shuru kar diya
 The day passed, and even in the faint light of the evening, the leaf hanging from the wall-mounted vine, was visible to them
 par tabhi raat padane ke saath-saath, uttari hawaaen fir chalane lageen or varsha kii jhadiyaan khidki se takaraa kar chajje par bah aayin
 As soon as the lights came on, the merciless Jansi ordered that the curtain be lifted
 bel main pattee ab tak maujuud thi
 Jansi kept staring at it for long
 usne su ko pukaara, jo chauke main stove par murgi kaa shorwa bana rahi thi
 Jancy said, "sudi, I'm a very bad girl
 kudarat kii kisi shakti ne, us antim pattee ko vahiin roak kar, mujhe yah bataa diya ki main kitni dusht hum
 To die in this way is a sin
 laa, mujhe thodaa-sa shorwa de or kuch doodh main jehar milakar laa de
 But no, before that give me a little mirror and put some pillows at my head so that i can see you sitting and cooking
 " After an hour she said, "sudi, i think i will make a picture of the Bay of Naples at some time
" " In the evening, Dr
 Saheb came again, made some excuse and went outside and met him
 su de durbal kaanpate haath ko apane haathon main lekar doctor sahab bole, "ab sambhaavna aath aana maani ja sakati he
 If the care is good then you will win and now i am going to see each other on the floor below
 kya naam he uskaa- beharman!-shaayad koi kalakaar he-nimonia ho gaya he
 He is very weak and bad man, and he is very loud
 bachane kii koi sambhaavna nahin
 Today i will send him to the hospital
 vahaan aaraam zyada milegaa
 " duusare din doctor ne su se kaha,"jansi, ab khatre se baahar he
 You won ab to sirf pathya or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he
 " us din shaam ko su, jansi ke palang ke paas aakar baith gayi
 She was weaving a pale bouquet of blue wool, restless
 usne takiye ke us ore se, apni baanh, su ke gale main daal di
 Soo said, "my naive cat, you have one thing to say
 aaj subah aspataal main, mistar beharman kii nimonia se mratyu ho gayi
 He had been ill only twice
 parason subah hi chaukeedaar ne use apane kamare main dard se tadapata paaya tha
 His clothes — even shoes — were completely soaked and cold as ice
 koi nahin jaanata ki ansi bhayanak raat main vah kahaan gaya tha
 But a burning lantern, a cistern, two-four brushes and some green and yellow paint were found on the panel from his room
 jaraa khidki se baahar to dekh-diwaar ke paas kii us antim pattee ko
 Have you ever wondered why that leaf does not move even in such a storm and storm? Pyari Sakhi, this was Behrman's masterpiece, the night the last leaf fell, the night he produced it
