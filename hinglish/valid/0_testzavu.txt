 He then thinks that his son will fulfill his unfulfilled dream
 lekin uske ghar lagaataar chaar betiyon ke hone se vah niraash ho jaataa he
 Because she feels that girls should learn housework, not wrestling
 lekin jab uski badi betiyaan,gita phogot or babita phogot mil kar un par apmanjanak tippanee karne vaale ladakon ko peet kar aa jate hai to use unamem bhavishya kaa pahalwaan dikhaai detaa he

 After this, both of them happily learn wrestling tricks from Mahavir
 mahavir unako pratiyogita main bhi le jaataa he, jisamen gita or babita mil kar kai ladakon ko haraa dete hai

 The teacher's technique at that institute was slightly different from his father's technique, and Geeta felt that his teacher's technique was much better than his father's technique, while his father's technique was outdated
 vah ghar laut aati he to vah uske pita ke sikhaaye takanic ke sthaan par santhaan main sikhaaye takanic se mukkebaazi karti he
 After this Mahavir and Geeta have boxing and Mahavir loses to them due to their growing age

 Mahavir comes to his institute and starts training them both
 lekin us santhaan main prashikshan sikhaane vaale ko jab is baat kaa pataa chalata he to vah un donon ko baahar nikaalane hetu shikaayat kar detaa he

 Legal equality is a principle according to which all people are equal before the law
 arthath sabhi logon par samaan kanoon lagu hota he or usee ke anusaar nyaay diya janaa chahie
 Legal equality means equality before the law and equal protection of the law for all
 avadharana yah he ki sabhi manushya janm se samaan hote hai, isliye kanoon ke saamne samaan haisiyat ke paatr hai
 The law is blind and therefore no one will deal with the person he is dealing with
 vah budhimaan ho yaa murkh, tejasvi ko yaa budhu, nata ho yaa kaddavar, garib ho yaa amir, uske saath kanoon vaisaa hi vyavhaar karegaa jaisaa auron ke saath karegaa
 But there are also remedies
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi balak yaa balika ke saath kisi vayask purush yaa stri jaisaa vyavhaar nahin kiya jayega or balak yaa balika ke saath murauvat kiya jayega
 Unfortunately, legal equality does not necessarily mean true equality, because as we all know, legal justice is not free and the rich person can get the services of the best lawyer and sometimes by bribing the judges One can also escape by doing injustice

 Srinivas gave the definition of Sanskritisation, stating that "in this process, the lower or middle Hindu caste or tribe or any other group changes their practices, customs and lifestyle towards the higher or more often Dwij castes

 According to Srinivas, Sanskritization is not only the adoption of new practices and habits, but it also comes to be interviewed with new ideas and values existing in Sanskrit
 ve kehete hai ki karm, dharm, paap, maaya, sansar, moksh aadi aise sanskrit sahitya main upasthit vichaar hai jo ki samskruthikrut logon ke bolchaal main aam ho jate hai
 This phenomenon is also seen in Nepal in Khas, Magar, Newar, Tharu people

 Later this theory was brought in the form of a book titled "religion and Sociology among the Coorgs of South India"
 yah pustak karnataka ke kodawa samudaay kaa nritatvashastreey adhyayan thi
 Srinivas wrote in the book: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
" This book then challenged the ongoing idea that caste is a firm and unchanging institution

 At the same time, it also brought to light the dynamics of the various castes and communities in India getting their status reconsidered

 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal

 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13

 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself

 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi

 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai

 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song

 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India

 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980

 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number

ham khub pareshaan hen France Emil Silampa was the novelist of Finland
 1939 i0 main sahitya main nobel puraskaar vijeta
 Emil Silampa was born on 16 September 1888 into a very poor family
 pita dihadi majdoor the or maa naukaraani
 The condition of poverty was that many children, not only their minor crops, seeds and pets, were also killed and only Silampa survived the miracle of nature due to being brought up in Finland's terrible winter climate
 balak silampa ko ek ghumantu skool mila, jisamen praarambhik shiksha hui
 In study, the clever Silampa soon found a regular school and started driving
 acchhee shiksha ke liye logon ne balak ko baahar bhejne kii salaah di or mata-pita ne pet katkar bete ko padhne ke liye shahar bheja
 Silampa passed matriculation in 1908 with good marks and due to the generosity of a kind man, he started studying biology at Helsinki University
 vishvavidhyalay main dattachitt hokar padhai main jute silampa ko lekhak, kalakar or buddhijivi doston kii sohabat mili or ve paathyakram ke alaava bhi duusari kitaaben padhane lage
 Five years later, Silampa learns that the exams are still far away and that the donor is now unable to help
 bachi-khuchi rakam lekar silampa gaanv laute to dekha maa-baap pehle se bhi bure halaat main din kaat rahe hai
 The son now lives with his parents and starts thinking of some help
 maa-baap ke kaamkaaj main haath bantaate hue silampa ne ek din pados ke gaanv se likhane ke liye kaagaj-lipaphe kharide or chhadmanaam se ek kahani likhakar najdiki shahar ke ek bade akhbaar ko bhej di
 Like a miracle, the story appeared on the front page of the newspaper and the remuneration was different
 us akhbaar main chhadmanaam se likhane kaa silsilaa chal padaa or ek nae pratibhashali lekhak kii charchaa aam ho gai, bas use dhundhane bhar kii der thi
 Soon people found the young writer Sillanpa
 ek prakaashak ne aage aakar agrim raashi dekar silampa ko ek kitaab likhane ke liye anubandhit kar liya
 In the life of a miracle-filled Silampa, during a dance in a village in 1914, a girl, Seagrid Maria, is found as a maid
 maaria or sillanpa ke bich prem hota he or 1916 main donon vivaah kar lete hai
 In a successful married life of twenty five years, Maria becomes the mother of eight children
 1914 main ek akhbaar ke liye lekh likhane ke liye ve sweden or denmark kii yatra par nikal padate hai or patrkaar banane kii soch lete hai
 But in the face of writing and journalism, he writes his first novel 'life and Son' in 1916
 yuddh kii ashanka ke mandaraate badalon bhare dinon main ek yuvak or do yuvatiyon ke prem trikon ko bayaan karne vaale is upanyaas ko janata main lokapriyata or aalochakon kii prashansa donon hasil huin
 Meanwhile a civil war broke out in the country, with Silampa supporting General Mannerheim, who was with the German white army
 grihayuddh kii samaapti ke baad sillanpa ko laga ki is yuddh se aakhirkaar kya hasil hua, sivaay hajaaron logon ke raktapaat ke? yuddh ke baad silampa ne yuddh ke kaaran anaath hue bacchon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 With this he continued to write stories
 1923 main gaanv main makaan banane kii vajah se lekhak karjon ke boj main dab gaya or aatmahatya kii sochane laga
 His publisher proposed to hire a clerk, but did not consider himself a self-respecting writer
 chaar bacchon ke parivaar ko lekar yah mahaan lekhak helsinki aakar rahane laga
 And after ten years started writing novels again
 1931 main ‘mad siljaa’ upanyaas kaa angreji main anuwaad hua to unki khyaati raaton-raat antarrashtriya str par fail gai
 After reading this epic story of the struggle of a peasant woman, many critics called Silampa deserving the Nobel Prize
 1932 main ‘da ve of e main’ main silampa ne ek adarsh kisaan yuvak kaa khubasurat chithran kiya, jise germany main yuvak kii sharabnoshi kii vajah se pratibandhit kar diya gaya, kyonki koi arya kisaan sharaab piye yah naaji sarkaar ko gavaara nahin tha
 His most important novel came in 1934 as 'people in the Summer Night', depicting the life of a community living in a particular region
 1936 main helsinki vishvavidhyalay ne silampa ko maanad doctoret kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 In fact, the Suomi language also became known globally for the first time when Silampa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1939
 silampa ke mahatv kaa andaaj isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki mangal or guru ke bich kii paridhi main bhraman karne vaale kshudra grah ‘1446 silampa’ ko 1938 main unheen ke deshvasi khagolvid yarjo visala dwaara khoja gaya or silampa ke naam par uskaa namakaran kiya gaya
 In terms of Silampa, this award was also a miracle like his miraculous life
 is varsh nobel puraskaar kii daud main unke saath ‘siddharth’ ke rachayita prasiddh german lekhak harman hes bhi the, jinhen 1946 main nobel puraskaar mila
 When the threat of world war began to appear in 1939, this sensitive writer was very distracted and could not stop himself
 parinamswaroop kitaab ai ‘christmas latter tu dictators’
 In this, the then dictators like Hitler, Mussolini were strongly criticized
 isi saal sillanpa kii kahaniyon kaa swedish bhashaa main anuwaad hua to nobel puraskaar samiti ne unke naam par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya
 Wife Maria dies a few months before the announcement of the Nobel Prize

 He mostly stayed in Sweden during the war
 1940 main gambhir beemaari ke chalate ve aspataal main bhartee hue or teen saal tak unka ilaaj chalaa
 Meanwhile, two of his books were published, in which a writer's past love about the past and lost ideals is revealed
 vishwayuddh samaapt hone par ve swadesh lautate hai or radio se jud jate hai, jahaan ve shrotaaon se apni jindagi ke anubhav baantate hai
 The novels 'august' in 1944 and 'the Lavlinas and Rachendanas of the Human Life' are published in 1945
 radio par sunaae gaye anubhavon ko lekar ve apni aatmakatha likhte hai, jo 1953 main ‘da bvoy livd hiz life’ ke rup main saamne aati he
 In 1956, a collection of his writings on politics and society, 'day at its highest' was published
 is mahaan lekhak ne apane samrudh rachanaatmak jivan main 3 june 1964 ko helsinki main antim saans lee
 In world literature, Silampa is known as a wonderful and great writer who loves the people and nature of his country and manifests in writing

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm kaa itihaas ati pracheen he
 This religion is considered pre-vedic period, because Vedic period and the period of creation of Vedas are considered different
 yahaan shatabdiyon se maukhik parampara chalati rahi, jiske dwaara iskaa itihaas va granth aage badhate rahe
 After that the period of writing it is also very long
 hindu dharm ke sarvapoojya granth hai veda
 The Vedas were not composed in any one period

 aisa kahana ki yahan se shuruyaat hui yah shaayad uchit na hoga phir bhi hindu itihaas granth mahabharat or puraanon main manu se bhagwaan krishna kii peedi tak kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Hinduism has evolved systematically since about 5000 years and can be seen as seven stages that binoculars are in each other
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon kaa maananaa hoga ki 12,000 saal pehle himyug ke ant tak hindu dharm ko apane sampurna rup main rishiyon ke liye prakat kiya gaya tha
 In the history of Hindutva, mythology is just history from time to time, historians cannot or cannot count
 haal ke dinon main, hindu dharm ko "khulaa strot dharm" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, anokhaa he ki isamen koi paribhaashit sansthaapak yaa siddhant nahin he, or aitihaasik or bhugolic vaastaviktaaon ke jawaab main iske vichaar lagaataar viksit hote hai
 It is best described as a river with many tributaries and branches, one of the Hindutva branches, and is currently very powerful, with many considering themselves as a river
 lagbhag 5000 saal pehle, kaansya yug main, jise ab hadappa sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaha jaataa he, jo eent shaharon kii visheshta he, jo lagbhag ek hajaar varshon se sindhu nadi ghati ke vishaal kshetra main ganga ke upar tak pahunche
 In these flat cities, we find earthen seals with images that are very much part of the current Hindu nature such as the pipal tree, the bull, the swastika, the seven maids, and a man sitting in a yoga pose
 ham is charan ke bare main bahut kuch nahin jaanate kyonki bhashaa ko samajhane ke liye bana rahata he
 3,500 years ago, in the Iron Age, Vedic hymns and rituals can be traced back to Harappan ideas, but are designed for a nomadic and rural lifestyle rather than a sustainable urban lifestyle
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon puri tarah asahmat hai or jor dete hai ki do charnon vastav main ek hai
 In this phase, we get a worldview that celebrates the physical world, where gods are introduced to rituals, and are said to provide health and wealth, prosperity and peace
 devataaon ko aamantrit karne or unase anugrah praapt karne kaa yah pahalu aaj bhi jari he, haalanki ye rasmen alag-alag hai
 The Vedas reveal a gradual spread from the Indus to the Upper Ganges and Lower Gangetic Plains
 kuch hindutv vidwaan is tarah ke bhugolic failaav kaa khandan karte hai or upmahadweep par jor dete hai ki pracheen samay se puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti, plastic kii surgery or yahaan tak ki hawaii jahaaj jaise unnat praudyogiki ke liye
 In the third phase, with texts known as the Upanishads 2,500 years ago, where more importance was given to introspection and meditation than rituals, and we focus more on ideas like rebirth, monasticism, liberation from the cycle of birth and death
 We do
 is charan main buddha dharm or jain dharm jaise shaman paramparaon kaa udai dekha gaya, iske anuyaayiyon ne paali or praakrit main baat kii or vedic rup or vaidic bhashaa, sanskrit kaa bhi khaarij kar diya
 It also included Brahmin priests reorganizing Vedic ideas through the creation of scriptures, books that focus on the ritual of regulating and passing social life through marriage, and the obligations of people to their ancestors, Depends on their caste and world
 vishaal
 Many academics use Brahmanism to describe this association of Vedic ideas and see it as a radically patriarchal and Magasian force that competes violently with the orders of egalitarian and pacifist monasteries
 buddha dharm or jain dharm, vaidic prathaon or vishwaason ke saath, uttar bharat se dakshin bharat tak fail gaya, or antat upmahadweep se madhya asia tak or dakshin purv asia tak fail gaya
 In the south, Tamil Sangam culture was encountered, with information that comes from a collection of early poems that reveal some knowledge of Vedic rituals and later epics with knowledge of Buddhism and Jainism
 kuch hindutv vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki koi alag tamil sangam samskruti nahin thi
 It was part of a fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, where everyone spoke Sanskrit
 chauthe charan main 2,000 saal pehle shuru hue ramayana, mahabharat or puraana jaise lekhon kaa udai hua, jahaan kahaniyon ko gharelu or vishwa sambandhon kii vishvadrushti kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he or ab parichit hindu vishvadrushti kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 We are introduced to a fully developed mythology where the world has no beginning or end, with many heavens and many hellos, controlled by action and reaction, where all societies go through cycles of birth and death Are, just like all living beings, temples and temple rituals arose in this phase
 ham mathvaasi vedantik adeshon kaa udai bhi dekhte hai jo sharir or sabakuch samvednaatmak, saath hi jaap tantrik adeshon se sharir ko bhrasht karte hai or sharir or sabhi chizon kii khoj karte hai
 We can also see the mingling of the old Nigama tradition, where divinity is considered formless with the new Agma tradition, where the divine takes the form of Shiva and his sons, Vishnu and his avatars, and the goddess and her many forms
 nae adeshon or paramparaon ke ubharne ke saath, ham jati pranali ke samekan ko bhi dekhte hai, jo vyavsaayon ke aadhaar par samudaay samooh nahin he, jo antarimari na hone se khud ko alag karata he
 Many academics have seen caste as an essential feature of Hinduism in favor of the upper castes, which it is alleged that Hindus reject
 kai hindutv ke vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati ke paas ek vaigyanik or tarksangat aadhaar he, or uske paas raajnneeti yaa arthshaastra ke saath kuch bhi nahin he
 The fifth stage is 1,000 years old, and it saw the rise of devotion as a principle, where devotees are connected to the deities through passionate songs, composed in regional languages, often bypassing the temple system
 yah vah samay tha jab ek kathor jati ke padanukram ne khud ko dridhtaapurvak lagaaya tha, jo pavitrataa ke siddhant par aadhaarit thi or kuch jatiyon ko ashubh or ayogy rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 They too cannot be well deprived of the community
 This is also the time when Islam enters India, peacefully moves south through the merchants of the sea and violently to the north through the Central Asian chieftains, Those who destroy Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples, which are also centers of political power and eventually establish their rule, are often associated with Hindu kings Area were opposed to the Vijayanagar Empire Ahoms, Marathas and the Deccan Rajput, east to the north
 hindutv ne islam ke aagaman or dilli or dekkani sultanaton ke utthan ko dekhte hue, baad main mughal shashan ko mahaan hindu samskruti ke ant ke rup main chihnit kiya, yah ek vishay he ki marxvaadi itihaaskaaron ne pagal sampradayik prachaar kiya he
 Later only hindu-islamic cooperation was exposed, going to other extreme, non-marxist historians argue chathe charan 300 varsh kaa he jab hindu dharm upmahadweep main europea shakti ke udai ko uttar dete hai, or isai mishnariyon ke parinamswaroop aagaman or tarksangat vaigyanik vyaakhyaan
 Some Hindutva scholars do not differentiate between the two
 is yug main europea vidwaanon ne vaigyanik vidhiyon or judev-isai lens donon kaa upyog karke hindu dharm kii bhaavana banane kii koshish kii
 For him, monotheism was true religion and scientific; Polytheism was pagan mythology
 He began a vast practice of translating and documenting the Hindu way of life
 unhone ek pavitra kitaab, ek nabi, or adhik mahatvapurn baat, ek uddeshy kii talash kii
 Eventually, to organize the complexity, he began to define Hinduism as Brahmanism, which was different from Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism
 yah orientlist dhaancha vidyalayon, collejon or media ke madhyam se purvi dharmon kii vaishvik samaj ko suchit karata rahaa he
 a liquid oral culture was settled until the 19th century
 pashchimi tareekon se padhe hue hinduon ne apane rivaaz or vishwaason ke bare main puche jane par unhen shame kii baat or sharmindagi kaa gaharaa asar mahasoos kiya
 Some decided to reform Hinduism to look colonial
 dusron ne hindu dharm ke "sachche saar" kii khoj karne or "baad main bhrasht" prathaon ko khaarij kar diya
 Still others rejected Hinduism itself and saw all religions as a dark dangerous force, rationally and scientifically altered
 yah is charan main he ki hindutv ek javaabi shakti ke rup main ubhare jo ki unhone european main hinduon kii sabhi chizon ke avinashi or anuchit majaak ke rup main dekha or baad main america or bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main chunauti di
 Hindutva saw Marxism and all other Western discourses as another form of Christian discourse, seeking to eradicate all traces of the Hindu way of life, what Islam had done in Central and Southeast Asia in previous centuries
 Was
 saatvin charan, aazaadee ke baad, ise andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa, bhale hi yah keval pichley 70 varshon tak failaa ho, kyonki yah dharmik aadhaar par hinsak or rakt-lathpath vibhaajan se shuru hota he or musalamaanon ke liye purvi or pashchimi pakistan kaa nirmaan

 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions
 iskaa ph maan 7
0 se kam hota he
 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen
 duulang ne san 1815 main oxylik amla kaa adhyayan kiya or is parinaam par pahunche ki oxynwaale or bina oxynwaale amlon main koi bhed nahin he
 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced
 par yah swaad main khatta or kriya main ksharhar hota he
 It also turns blue litmus to red
 isi prakaar sodium baislphide khatta or ksharhar hota he
 It turns blue litmus red
 isamen visthapit honevaala hydrogen bhi he, par yah amla nahin he
 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt
 at: amla kii koi santoshprad paribhaasha ab tak nahin di ja saki he
 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
