 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem

 chhathi putali ravibhama ne jo katha sunai vah is prakaar he- One day, Vikramaditya was admiring the natural beauty from his palace on the banks of the river
 barsaat kaa maheenaa tha, isliye nadi ufan rahi thi or atyant tezi se bah rahi thi
 At that time, he saw a man, a woman and a child
 unke vasr taar-taar the or chehre pile
 On seeing the king, they understood that they are very poor
 sahasaa ve teenon us nadi main chalaang laga gaye
 The next moment shouted to protect the soul
 vikram ne bina ek pal ganvaae nadi main unki raksha ke liye chalaang laga di
 It was not possible to save all three alone, so they remembered both the belts
 donon betaalon ne sree or bachche ko tathaa vikram ne us purush ko doobane se bachaa liya
 On reaching the coast, he wanted to know why he was committing suicide
 purush ne bataaya ki vah unheen ke rajya kaa ek atyant niradhan brahman he jo apni daridrata se tang aakar jaan dena chahta he
 He cannot see his wife and child dying of hunger and there is no end to his problem except suicide
 is rajya ke log itane aatmanirbhar he # ki sara kaam khud hi karte hai, isliye use koi rojgaar bhi nahin detaa
 Vikram told the Brahmin that he can stay with his family as long as he wants in his guest house and his every need will be met
 brahman ne kaha ki rahane main to koi harj nahin he, lekin use dar he ki kuch samay baad aatithy main kami aa jaaegi or use apamaanit hokar janaa padegaa
 Vikram assured him that there would be no such thing and that he would always be treated well considering him as God
 vikram ke is tarah vishwaas dilaane par brahman parivaar atithishaala main aakar rahane laga
 Servants were appointed to look after him
 ve mouj se rahete, apni marzi se khate-pite or aaraamdeh palang par sote
 He was not lacking in anything
 lekin ve safaai par bilkul dhyaan nahin dete
 Those who wore clothes did not change them for several days
 jahaan sote vahiin thookte or mel-mutr tyaag bhi kar dete
 Dirt-dirt spread all around
 durgandh ke maare unka sthaan ek pal bhi thaharne laayak nahin rahaa
 The servants endured everything patiently for a few days, but how long did it last? He did not even care for the king's anger and ran away
 raja ne kai anya naukar bheje, par sab ke sab ek hi jaise nikle
 This work proved impossible for everyone
 tab vikram ne khud hi unki seva kaa bidaa uthaaya
 While getting up and sleeping, he would fulfill every wish of the Brahmin family
 durgandh ke maare maathaa fata jaataa, phir bhi kabhi apshabd kaa vyavhaar nahin karte
 Vikram used to press his feet as well
 brahman parivaar ne har sambhav praytn kiya ki vikram unke atitth se tang aakar atithi-satkar bhul jaaen or abhadrata se pesh aaen, magar unki koshish asafal rahi
 Vikram remained patient in his service with great patience
 kabhi unhen shikaayat kaa koi mauka nahin diya
 One day the Brahmin decided to take his exam
 usne raja ko kaha ki ve uske sharir par lagi vishtha saaf karen tathaa use acchhee tarah nahala-dhokar saafe vasr pahanayen
 Vikram immediately obeyed him and proceeded to clean the temple with his hands
 achaanak chamatkaar hua
 All the dirty clothes of the Brahmin disappeared
 uske sharir par devataaon dwaara pahane jane vaale vasr aa gaye
 His face shone brightly
 saare sharir se sugandh nikalne lagi
 Vikram was surprised
 tabhi vah brahman bolaa ki darasal vah varun he
 This form was taken by Varun Dev to take his exam
 vikram ke atithi-satkar kii prashansa sunakar ve sapariwaar yahan aao the
 He got what he had heard, so he gave a boon to Vikram that there would never be any drought in his kingdom and three crops would grow from the land there
 vikram ko vardaan dekar ve sapariwaar antadhryaan ho gaye

 Earthquake insurance is a type of property insurance, according to which the policyholder is paid the damages caused by the earthquake
 saadhaaran rup main zyaadaatar ghar ke maalik kii beemaa policy bukamp ko cover nahin karte
 Most earthquake insurance policies are a highly deductible facility, which makes this type of insurance beneficial when the entire house is destroyed but not useful when the home has suffered only a small loss
 daren sthaan or bukamp ke nuksaan kii sambhaavna par nirbhar karte hai
 Rates are slightly lower for wood-built houses, because wood-built houses can withstand better earthquakes than brick-built houses
 ateet main, bukamp haani bade paimaane par suchi data kaa sangrah kaa upyog kar moolyankan kiya gaya tha or visheshgyon kii raay par zyaadaatar aadhaarit tha
 Today it is estimated using a single damage ratio, the amount of earthquake damage is proportional to the total value of the house
 ek anya vidhi HAZUS, nuksaan ke akalan ke liye ek computarikrut prakriya kaa istemaal hota he
 Assigning this type of insurance when an earthquake strong enough to destroy a house will probably destroy dozens of homes in the same area as with flood insurance or insurance on damage from a hurricane or other large-scale disasters
 In, insurance companies should be careful
 ek company ke ek vishesh shahar main gharon kii ek badi sankhya par beemaa policiyon likhaa gaya he, to ek vinaashkari bukamp jaldi se sabhi company ke sansadhano palaayan hoga
 Insurance companies should do more study and efforts towards risk management to avoid such cases

 Its coverage was extended from complete earthquakes and war losses to include other natural disasters such as natural landslides, volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal activity, and tsunamis, with coverage for war damage rather than seismic alone
 awasaiya bhoomi ke liye, tufaan or baadh ke nuksaan ko cover kiya jaataa he

 For this reason, the ethnic mix of Qurgoontappa is higher than other cities in Tajikistan
 2010 main nagar kii tasviir Couragonteppa Terminal taxi adda View from the plane is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth

 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly

 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects
 adhikansh akashgangaon ke centre main sthit ati vishalkay blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhawatah kai choti vastuon ke vilay ke dwaara hua hoga
 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed
 eksre spectrum us vishisht aakaar ko darshata he jisaki apeksha us discs se kii jaati he jisamen aurbiting relativistic padaarth hon, ek louh rekha ke saath or jise ~6

 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes
 rileytivistik haivi aayan colider main aag kaa gola parighatna blike hole ke kaaphi nikat kaa anuroop he or is anuroop kaa upyog karke iske kai bhautik gunon kii bhavishyavaanee sahi dhang kii ja sakati he
 a fireball, however, is not a gravitational object
 vartmaan main yah gyaat nahin he ki kya or adhik urjavan large hadran colider aashaa ke anuroop bade atirikt aayam vaale sookshm blike hole ke utpaadan main sakasham hoga, jaisaa ki kai shodhakartaaon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya he
 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research
 tathakthith jaankaree lop virodhabhas, yaa blike hole kendrikaran virodhabhas, moulik bhautikee main ek khulaa prashn he
 Traditionally, the laws of physics will remain the same, move forward or backward
 arthath, yadi brahmad ke prayek kan kii sthiti or veg kii maap kii jaye, to ham icchaanusaar ateet ke brahmad ke itihaas kii khoj ke liye peeche kii taraf kaam kar sakate hai
 The Louville theorem describes the conservation of the phase space volume, which can be understood as "conservation of information", so there is a problem in established physics as well
 kwantum yantriki main, yah kendrikaran naamak ek mahatvapurn gun ke saath mail khaati he, jiskaa sambandh prayikta ke sangrakshan ke saath he 
 However, black holes can violate this rule
 sthapit saamaanya saapekshata ke antargat yah sthiti sookshm kintu spasht he: sthapit no-hair prameya ke kaaran, yah kabhi nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki blike hole ke andar kya gaya? haalaanki, baahar se dekhne par, jaankaree vastav main kabhi nasht nahin hoti he, kyonki blike hole main girte hue padaarth ko ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne main anant samay lagata he
 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity
 lekin khud hawking ne isapar paryaapt vishwaas jataate hue 1997 main caltech bhautikavid jon preskill ke saath lagaai gayi shart ke liye bhugtan kiya, jisamen media ko kaaphi ruchi rahi thi
 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory

 'vishwa Bharati' became famous as the university

 Thinking of the guru-disciple relationship, Tagore studied the problems of the modern teenager with a warm heart and expressed his strong conviction that the rigorous discipline of prisons and military barracks could not serve to remove the indiscipline prevalent in educational institutions
 So the reputation of teachers will also be hurt
 vidhyaarthiyon se yah aashaa karnaa hi galat he ve adhyapakon se vaisaa hi vyavhaar karen jaisaa kisi samant ke darbari karte hai
 Tagore believed that if the process of exchange in education is accompanied by a feeling of mutual respect, then the problem of discipline will be solved automatically

 Handled up to bhautik vigyaan main krishnika padaarth kii ek adarshikrut avasthaa he, jo apane upar padane vaale sabhi vidyut chumbakeey vikiran avashoshit kar letaa he
 The black body absorbs radiation in a special and continuous spectrum and is re-emitted when heated
 kyonki koi bhi prakaash parilakshith yaa sancharit nahin hota he or vastu jab thandi hoti he, to kaali dikhaai detii he
 However, a black body emits a temperature dependent light spectrum
 krishnika se nikle is saura vikiran ko krishnika vikiran kaha jaataa he
 The shorter the length of the wave in the spectrum of the black body, the higher the frequency and the higher the frequency is related to the higher temperature
 is prakaar, ek garm vastu kaa rang varnakram ke nile ant ke kareeb hota he or ek thandi vastu kaa rang laal ke kareeb hota he
 At room temperature, the black body emits mostly infrared wavelengths, but when the temperature rises a few hundred degrees Celsius, the black body emits visible wavelengths, which look red, orange, yellow, bright, blue as the temperature rises
 vastu ke safed hone tak vah paryaapt maatra main parabangnee vikiran utsarjit karti he
 The term "krishnika" was introduced in 1860 by Gustav Kirchhoff
 jab iskaa yogic visheshan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, to yah shabd aam taur par "krishnika vikiran" yaa " blakebody radiation" ke rup main ek shabd main sanyukt ho jaataa he
 The black body emission provides insight into the solar equilibrium state of a continuous field
 shastreey bhautikee main saura santulan main prayek alag-alag foorier mod main samaan urja honi chahie
 This approach led to a paradox, known as the ultraviolet disaster, and containing an enormous amount of energy in the field of sustainable living
 krishnika saura santulan ke gunon kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, kyonki ve jo surya kii kirnon dwaara vitarit kiye jane vaale vikiran utsarjit karte hai
 Historically, the concept of quantum mechanics came from studying the laws of the black body
 krishnika kaa vikiran ek khaas taapmaana main krishnika ke saath saura santulan or prakaash vikiran kaa prakaash hota he
 This refers to the thermodynamics equilibrium state of light
 prayogtmak rup se yah krishnika yukt ek kathor-deevaaron vaali guha main sthir sthiti santulan vikiran ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 There are no strongly true black bodies in nature but graphite is a good analogy and a closed box with graphite walls at steady state is a good approximation of the ideal radiation of a black body
 ek guha, jisamen koi krishnika nahin he, vah santulan kii sthiti main krishnika vikiran barkaraar rakhane main sakasham nahin he, yah tathy kirchaaf dwaara prayogtmak rup se paaya gaya he, lekin iskaa bhautik mahatv na to kirchaaf ne samajha or na hi plank ne
 Since light is a oscillating form of a constant electromagnetic field, radiation-studies of the black body reveal how temperatures occur in continuous fields, contradicting classical physics
 kyonki kwantum yantriki ke aagaman se pehle prakaash kii saura sthiti itani bhramit karne vaali thi ki 19 veen sadi ke in tarkon ko kaaphi saavdhaanee se pesh kiya gaya ki prakaash kii ek saura santulan sthiti hoti he
 At fixed temperatures, a substance in t can be seen glowing like an oven
 jis bindu par sabhi thos padaarth ek mand laal chamak paidaa karte hai, us bindu ko draper bindu naam diya gaya
 An oven at 1000 k looks red and at 6000 k it looks white
 jab tak oven kaaphi chamakdaar nahin hota tab tak isse koi antar nahin padataa he ki bhatthi kaa nirmaan kaise kiya gaya he, prakaash kaa rang keval taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 Since color is a directly visible measure of wavelength, this means that light at different temperatures distributes different energies between different wavelengths
 tii taapmaana par λ tarangadairghy main prati unit volum i urja kii maatra ko krishnika ghumaav kii avasthaa kaha jaataa he
 Detailed experiments have shown that the state of rotation of the black body depends only on the temperature and not on the emitted material
 This suggests that light, like any other object, actually comes from solar equilibrium and thus the concept of light at t temperature is understandable
 samaan taapmaana par do chijen santulan main rah sakati hai, jaise tii taapmaana par prakaash ke badal se ghira padaarth tii taapmaana par ausat rup se badal main utana prakaash vikirit kar saktaa he, jitna vah sokh le, yah privost ke vinimay siddhant par aadhaarit he, jo vikaranshil santulan ko sandarbhit karata he
 The principle of broad equilibrium states that there is no peculiar correlation between the process of emission and absorption, that the process of emission is not affected by absorption but only by the solar state of the emitting material
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki tii taapmaana par padaarth dwaara utsarjit kul prakaash, chaahe vah krishna padaarth ho yaa nahi, hameshaa us kul prakaash ke baraabar hota he, jise padaarth avashoshit karata he, jo tii taapmaana par prakaash se ghira ho
 The amount of light absorbed for a black body is as much as it falls on the surface
 kisi bhi tarangadairghy λ ke prati ikai samay main avashoshit prakaash urja anivaary rup se krishnika ke karv ke anupaat main hoti he
 This means that the rotation of the black body is as much as the light energy emitted by the black body, which justifies its name
 yah saura vikiran kaa kirchof niyam he: krishnika kaa utsarjan ghumaav prakaash kii saura visheshta he, jo keval guha kii deevaaron kewapamanaper hi nirbhar karata he, basharte yah sthiti honi aavashyak he ki guha main kuch puri tarah se kaali saamagree ho or yah vikaranshil santulan main ho
 Absorption is modified when the black body is so small that its size can be compared to the wavelength of light, because a small object cannot be an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of rigorous equality of emission and absorption Are always justified
 prayogshaala main, krishnika ke vikiran kii maatra kaa anumaan ek badi guha ke praveshdwar par ek chote chhed, ekahohalerum, jisamen krishnika hota he or jise santulan tak pahunchaaya jaataa he or barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he, ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 
 The light entering the hole has to be reflected several times on the walls of the cavity before being released, in which process it becomes almost certain to be absorbed
 yah pravesh kar rahe vikiran ke tarangadairghy se matlab rakhe bina bhi ho saktaa he 
 tab yah chhed ek saidhantik krishnika ke kareebi sanniktan ke rup main hoga or yadi guha ko garm kiya jaye to chhed ke vikiran kaa varnakram satat hoga, haalanki yah bhi puri sunishchit karnaa hoga ki guha main lagbhag puri tarah se kaali kuch saamagree rakhi gai ho or yah bhi ki santulan kaayam kiya gaya he or ise barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, lekin in praavdhaanon ke saath, yah aage guha kii anya samagriyon par ashrith nahin rahati he
 
 19 veen sadi ke uttararddh ke dauraan saidhantik bhautikee main krishnika ke ghumaav kii gananaa ek pramukh chunauti thi
 The problem was finally solved in 1901 by Max Planck's Planck law of black-body radiation
 thermodynemics or electromangnetismo se talmail rakhte hue unhone vaayen ke vikiran niyam main badlaav kiye or ek santoshjanak tareeke se prayogtmak data ke upyukt ek ganitiya sutara paaya
 To get a physical explanation of his formula, Planck then assumed that the energy of oscillation in the cavity was balanced
 oinstin ne is vichaar ko aage badhaayaa or 1905 main hi photo electric prabhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastaavit vidyut chumbakeey vikiran ke parimanikaran kaa prastaav diya
 These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the elimination of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics
 aaj, in quanta ko photonkaha jaataa hai or sochaa ja saktaa he ki krishnika kii guha main photons kii gas ho sakati hai
 Furthermore, it guided the development of quantum probability distributions, called fermi-direc statics and bose-einstein statics, and each of these particles applied to different classes, which were used in quantum mechanics instead of classical distributions
 
 pheramion or boson bhi dekhen 
 The wavelength at which radiation is strongest is called the Vaughan displacement law and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan Boltzmann law
 atah jaise-jaise taapmaana badhata he, chamak kaa rang laal se pile or phir safed se nile main parivartit hota he
 Even as the peak wavelength enters the ultraviolet, enough radiation continues to be emitted at the blue wavelength, causing the substance to appear blue
 yah kabhi bhi adrishy nahin hoga- vastav main, drishy prakaash kaa vikiran taapmaana ke saath ek gati se badhata rahata he
 Brightness or supervised intensity is not a function of direction
 isliye ek krishnika ek paripurna lambartian radiator hota he
 Real objects never behave like absolute ideal dark matter, and instead radiation emitted at a fixed frequency is a fraction of the ideal emission possible
 ek saamagree kaa utsarjan bataata he ki ek vaastavik padaarth ek krishnika kii tulana main kitni acchhee tarah urja kaa vikiran karata he
 This {0} emission { / 0} depends on many factors, such as temperature, direction of emission, and wavelength
 haalanki, ejineering main yah maan vishisht he ki ek sataha kaa varnakrameey utsarjan or avasorana tarangadairghy par nirbhar nahin karte hai, isliye utsarjan ek nirantar prakriya he
 This is known as gray body prediction
 gaiyr-kaali satahon se nipatane ke kram main adarsh kaale-padaarth ke vyavhaar kaa apsaran jyamitiya sanrachana or rasinic samishran donon dwaara nirdhaarit hota hai or yah bhi tay hona chahie lagbhag krishnika kaa vikaranshil santulan vartmaan ho
 This is closer to the Kircharf law: emission is equal to absorption, so an object that does not absorb all the light falling will emit less radiation than an ideal black body
 khagol vigyaan main taron jaise pindon ko aksar krishnika mana jaataa he, haalanki yah ek kamjor sanniktan he
 a nearly complete black-body radiation spectrum is represented by cosmic microwave background radiation
 vikiran kaa failaav kaale chhed dwaara utsarjit ek kaalpanik krishnika vikiran he
 Although Planck's formula predicts that a black body will radiate energy at all frequencies, this formula will only apply if multiple photons are being measured
 udhaaharan ke liye, kamare ke taapmaana par ek vargametre ke sataha kshetra main ek krishnika prayek 41 second par ek photone kii ausat dar par drishy range par ek photone utsarjit karegaa, iskaa matlab yah hua ki zyaadaatar vyaavhaarik prayojanon main ek aisa krishnika drishy paraas main utsarjan nahin karegaa
 Although a black body is a theoretical object, the general application of a source to infrared radiation is defined as a black body when the object reaches an emission of 1
0
 jab ek avarakt vikiran kaa strot 0
99 se kam ho to ise "grey body" ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Applications of black-body simulation typically include testing and calibration of infrared systems and infrared sensor equipment
 ati krishnika aisa hi ek udhaaharan he, jo nikal-phosphorus mishra dhaatu se banaaya jaataa he
 More recently, a team of Japanese scientists has created a material very close to the black body, based on single-walled carbon nanotubes at a perpendicular angle, in the spectral range of 98% to 99% of the incident light from ultraviolet infrared
 % Absorbs part
 plank kaa niyam kahata he ki ki where vaayen kaa visthaapan niyam dikhaata he ki kisi bhi taapmaana par krishnika kaa vikiran kisi anya taapmaana par varnakram se kis tarah sambandhit he
 If we know the size of the spectrum at one temperature, then we can calculate the size at another temperature
 vaayen ke visthaapan niyam kaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek tarangadairghy, jis par krishnika dwaara utpaadit vikiran kii tivrata adhiktam hoti he, λ m a x { \ displaystyle \ lambda _{ \ mathrm {max} }}, yah keval taapmaana kaa kaary he Where the constant B, known as the displacement continuum of the vane, equals 2
8977685 × 10−3 m K
 dhyaan rahe ki chotii kii tivrata ko prati unit tarangadairghy yaa prati unit aavriti kii tivrata ke sandarbh main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 The above expression for peak wavelength represents the intensity per unit wavelength; Whereas the above section of Planck's law is known in terms of frequency per unit
 aavriti, jis par prati ikai urja aavriti adhiktam hoti he use This rule states that the energy emitted per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to one-fourth the energy of its absolute temperature
 arthath Where j * is the radiated total energy per unit area, t is the temperature and σ = 5
67 × 10−8 w m − 2 k − 4 is the Stefan – Boltzmann constant
 krishnika niyam manushyon par bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, some of a person's energy is radiated as electromagnetic radiation, most of which is infrared
 shuddh vikiran urja utsarjit urja or avashoshit urja ke bich kaa antar hoti he: Applying the stefan-boltzmann rule, ek vayask kaa kul sataha kshetra 2 m2 hota he or twachaa kaa madhya tathaa dur-avaraktautsarjan tathaa kapadon kaa zyaadaatar hissaa ekbaddhata ke kareeb hota he, kyonki yah sabase adhik gaiyr-dhaatu sataha hota he
 The skin temperature is 33 ° C, but the fabric reduces the surface temperature to 28 ° C, while the ambient temperature is 20 ° C
 isliye, shuddh vikiransheel ushma kaa nuksaan kareeb nimnaankit hota he The total energy radiated in a day is 9 MJ, or 2000 kcal

 However, a sluggish adult has a moderate metabolic rate of 50 to 70%, which is higher than their basal rate
 sanvahan or vashpikaran sahit anya mahatvapurn thermal nuksaan tantra bhi hota he
 Convection is negligible because the Nusselt number is much higher than unity
 vashpikaran kii jarurat tabhi hoti he, jab taapmaana kii lagaataar avasthaa ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye vikiran or sanvahan aparyaapt hote hai
 Free convection rates are comparable, albeit somewhat lower, than radiative rates

 Furthermore, when applying the law of wyne to humans it is found that the peak wavelength of light emitted by a person is
 yahi kaaran he ki maanav vishyon ke liye banaaye gayi thermal imaging upkaran 7000-14000 nanometers tarangadairghy ke prati adhik samvedansheel hote hai
 The black-matter law has been used to roughly estimate the temperature of a planet
 sataha greenhouse prabhaav ke kaaran adhik garm ho sakati he
 The temperature of a planet depends on some factors: aantarik grahon ke liye, ghatana or utsarjit vikiran kaa taapmaana par sabase zyada mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 This derivation is mainly related to it
 stephen-boltzman niyam surya dwaara utsarjit kul urja detaa he
 where surya sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se urja utsarjit karata he
 Because of this, the Earth is warmed by only a small fraction of it
 surya kii jo urja prithvi par padati he vah he: so ucch taapmaana ke kaaran, suraj baari maatra main parabangnee or drishy aavriti range par utsarjan karata he
 In this frequency range, the Earth reflects a fraction of this energy 1- α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, where α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} is the Earth's albedo and reflection in the uv-vis range
 duusare shabdon main, prithvi surya ke prakaash kaa ek ansh 1 − α { \ displaystyle 1- \ alpha } avashoshit karti he or baaki ko paravartit kar detii he
 The energy absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere is expressed as: yahaan tak ki prithvi ek golakaar kshetra π r 2 { \ displaystyle \ pi R^{2}} ke rup main hi avashoshit karti he, yah kshetra kii sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se utsarjan karti he
 If the Earth were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the Stephan – Boltzmann method
 jahaan T_{E} prithvi kaa taapmaana hota he
 The Earth, since it has a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits only the infrared part of most of the spectrum
 is aavriti range main, yah us vikiran ko utsarjit ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} karti he, jo ek krishnika dwaara ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} iaar range main utsarjit ausat utsarjaktaa he
 So the energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere is as follows: yah maanate hue ki prithvi ushn santulan main he, avashoshit urja avashya hi utsarjit urja ke baraabar honi aavashyak he : Substituting the power of solar and earth in equations 1-6 and in simple form it can be called: duusare shabdon main, manyataon ke mutabik, prithvi kaa taapmaana keval surya, surya kii trigya, prithvi or surya ke bich duuri, albido or prithvi ke iaar utsarjan ke taapmaana par hi nirbhar karata he
 If we substitute the measured values for the Sun and Earth: agar ham unity kaa ausat utsarjan tay karen, ham gananaa kar sakate hai ki prithvi kaa "prabhavi taapmaana" aisa hoga : This is what the Earth would be if it radiated into a perfect black body in the infrared, ignoring the greenhouse effect and in the event of an irreversible albedo
 vastav main prithvi avarakt main lagbhag ek purna krishnika ke rup vikirn hoti he, jo anumaanit taapmaana ko prabhavi taapmaana se kuch hi degree zyada adhik badhaayegaa
 yadi ham anumaan karnaa chahen ki agar koi vaataavaran nahin ho to prithvi kaa taapmaana kya hoga, to hamen ek anumaan ke achche jariye ke rup main albido or chand ke utsarjan kaa dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 The emission of albedo and the moon are about 0

 dopalar prabhaav ek acchhee tarah gyaat tathy he, jo yah varnit karata he ki prakaash kii aavritiyaan tab kis tarah "sthanantarit" ho jaati hai, jab ek prakaash strot paryvekshak ke saapeksh gum rahaa hota he
 If f is the emitted frequency of a monochromatic light source, it will appear at the f frequency when it is moving relative to the observer
 jahaan v paryvekshak ke rest frem main veg kaa strot he, to θ veg sadish or paryvekshak strot disha ke bich kaa kone he or si prakaash kii gati he
 This is a completely relativistic formula and can be simplified in special cases of objects that are moving in a straight direction or away from the observer and have a much lower speed than C

 i mail, jo kii online vigyaapan ke liye pehla sarvamaanya saadhan tha, baad main dhire - dhire bahut adhik prayog main aane laga tathaa phir is prakaar ke i mels ko spam naam de diya gaya
 The first large-scale dispatch of spam messages was made by the System Administrator of Andrews University in 1994, posting it on all Usenet news groups
 internet par vigyapanon ke liye nimna sadhano kaa prayog kiya jaataa he- Advertisers and publishers use a variety of techniques to measure the payment made in exchange for advertising, which are as follows: anya bhugtan ke madhyamon main fiks kharche ke vigyaapan aadi aate hai
 By all of this, advertisers take payment in exchange for advertisement from the person or organization wishing to advertise
