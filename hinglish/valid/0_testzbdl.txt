yani jeet ho yaa haar, donon hi dard ke saath milti he"
 Kumar lives a very normal life outside the ring
 duniya ke sarvshereshth baintowet boxr ko haraane ke baad kumaar ko bharat main kaaphi lokapriyata mili, bhale hi ve aglaa hi match haar gaye the
 Many people were greatly impressed by the one thing he said after the victory, he said, "dreams are not what we see sleeping
 sapane to ve hai jo hamen sone hi na den
"ve quarterfinals main haar gaye, lekin unki lokapriyata waisi hi bani rahi
 a few weeks after the Olympics were over, Kumar admitted that he still felt the pain of that defeat and that it built confidence
 unhone kaha ki ve jis shaks ko adarsh maanate hai vah ve khud hai
 Kumar says that although he won the hearts of the people of India, "the truth is that i am a loser, i could not win gold"
 According to Kumar, this can only be offset by winning gold medals in the upcoming Commonwealth Games and World Championships: "it is only one medal that is achieved with hard work - gold
 Other medals are based on luck and luck Are won "
 He said that this is the biggest reason that Abhinav Bindra is an Indian hero
 haar ke baad bhi sakaaratmak rahane ke bare main vah kehete hai, "main kaaphi soch-samaj kar apane aasapaas ke logon or companiyon ke bare main suchanaaen praapt karata hum
 isse kaaphi fark padataa he "
 unhone kaha ki unamem ek khaasiyat he ki ve gairajaruri chizon ko alag karne main kaamyaab rahete hai
 Kumar says, "I love watching and reading inspirational and dedicated stories
 This is my vision of looking at something"
 faijabad main janme khilaadi kaa kahana he ki mukkebaaji ek lat he, lekin nattejey ke saath: "jeet ke liye ho saktaa he ki aapako apane virdohi mukkebaaz ko adhik or jor se maarna padataa ho, lekin chot aapako bhi lagati he
 Win or lose, both come with pain "
 Being the senior boxer of the Indian contingent, Akhil Kumar maintains his passion even in the worst of times:" The way i behave, my juniors must imitate it
 Will be
 "they are very happy that Indian boxers have finally started winning medals
 jeetender or vijender jaise yuva mukkebaajon ko ve kehete hai: "medal sirf jito nahin, unhen chin lo"
bharat main mukkebaaji ne nayaa aayam hasil kiya he
 Kumar explains, "since most of us come from far-flung areas, no one knows what our abilities are"
 kumaar ne bataaya ki vah is baat se kaaphi khush hai ki 2012 ke landan olympix main mahila mukkebaaji ko bhi shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Kumar said, "we have very good players in women's boxing and a medal can be expected in the London Games
" 

lekin mahilaon ko shaamil karne ke liye ham purushon ko chaar virgon kii qurbaani deni padi he"
 Kumar is not happy about the change in the scoring system and he thinks that this will make the game easier and will also lose its charm
 "pehle mukkebaaji ko iske mahaan khilaadiyon kii style or shaan ke liye yaad kiya jaataa tha, lekin badlaav ke baad ab mukaable ke dauraan sabhi ko atyant saavdhaanee baratani padegi
" When asked about the controversy over the trial system of shooting recently, Kumar said that both sides were correct on their arguments
 "trial hameshaa se hi mahatvapurn he, yah kam lokapriy khilaadiyon ko bhi apni kaabiliyat dikhaa kar rashtriya team main jagah banane kaa mauka detaa he, lekin bindra kaa maamla thodaa alag tha, vah ek olympic champion hai or ve antarrashtriya str par lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe the, isliye aap unhen team ke liye nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate hai"

 jab kaajal peshey se abhiyantaa raaj se shaadi karti he, to vah or uske pita, swachaalit rup se maanate hai ki vah amir he
 Even in the birth of two children and many years of marriage, it does not change
 iskaa ek udhaaharan tab hota he jab kaajal apane puraani saheli nisha se milti he or kahati he uskaa pati ek bada bijness main he, uske parivaar ke paas kai car hai or ek bade bangale main rahete hai, lekin nisha, jo vastav main he amir sach jaan jaati he
 When Jahnavi arrives from abroad, Raj's niece, Sahni's niece, she meets Raj at the airport and admits that he is a car driver
 uske baad vah use uske saamaan ke saath sadak par fanse hue chhod detaa he, ye parvaah kiye bina ki uske maalik kya kahenge
 Jahnavi reached office well on time and praised Raj's attitude
 jab vah jaanati he ki vah vivaahit vyakti he, to vah tab bhi raaj se shaadi karne ke liye atal he
 She first meets Kajal at a shop where they both go to Raj to buy cassette players
 parivaar jahnavi kaa diya hua tepe sunata he jisamen wo apana pyaar kabool karti he
 In an attempt to marry Raj, Jahnavi meets the greedy Kajal inside the Ganesh temple in the city
 vah raaj ke vivaah ke badale main do karod rupee kii peshkash karti he
 Kajal then, accepting it as an opportunity to get wealth and an easy life, suddenly accepts her offer
 kaajal ne samjhaute ke liye raaj ko majaboor kar diya or hindu vivaah adhinium kaa anupaalan karne ke liye raaj or jahnavi ko vivaahit karakar khud raaj ko talaak de diya; yah sochakar ki vah or jahnavi khushi se saath rahenge or raaj ko saajha karenge
 She then uses the money found in the deal to buy a huge mansion and several cars
 vah jo bangala kharidti he vah nisha kaa nikalataa he
 Kajal then taunts her saying that she has fulfilled her dreams, while Nisha's dreams are now broken after losing everything
 nisha ne kaajal ko yaad dilaayaa ki usne apana ghar or sampatti ko apane biimaar pati ke ilaaj ke liye bech diya, jabaki kaajal ne apane pati ko dhan ke liye bech diya he; or kuch had tak, kaajal usase se bhi garib he
 Kajal molded herself into an influential person, ignoring her family
 raaj shuruyaat main kaajal dwaara khaarij kiya gaya mahasoos karata he or jahnavi ke kareeb nahin gaya
 But the children and Raj find a partner with Jahnavi, who watches them with love and affection
 vah khud ko badalati he or ek saamaanya bhartiya gruhinee ban jaati he
 Now Kajal realizes how far she has gone from her family
 vah apni shaadi kii saalagirah bhul jaati he or apni beti ke janmdin ke liye janmdin kii party rakhti he, yah mahasoos kiye bina ki raaj kabhi bhi bhavy jeevanstyli ke liye aakarshith nahin hua he or is tarah use jahnavi kii ore dhakel rahi he
 Kajal tries to improve
 jab kuch bhi kaam nahin karata, tab kaajal jahnavi ko thappad maarthi he or use apane pati ko chura lene kaa aarope lagaati he
 She then tries to throw Jahnavi out of the house, but to no avail, as Raj decides to go with Jahnavi
 bachche bhi jahnavi or unke pita ke saath rahane kaa faisla karte hai
 Kajal, on the other hand, becomes distraught after leaving her family
 apana sabhi dhan wo daan karti he
 When she learns that Raj and the children are going to America, she goes to the airport
 vah unhen jane ke liye taiyaar paati he
 But at the last minute, Jahnavi tells Raj that she is going to America alone, but she is not really alone
 vah raaj ke bachche kii ummid kar rahi he
 Jahnavi admits that although Kajal had sold her husband, it was she who offered to buy him and thus he should pay his dues
 to, film kaajal ke saath apane parivaar ko waapas aane or jahnavi ke hameshaa ke liye neuyork jane ke saath samaapt hoti he

 chhayavaad hindi sahitya ke romantic utthan kii vah kavy-dhara he jo lagbhag i
sa
 1918 se 1936 tak kii pramukh yugavani rahi
 Spiritual expression, love of nature, love of women, humanization, cultural awakening, imaginary primacy, etc
 are the main features of cinematic poetry
 chhayavaad ne hindi main khadi boli kavita ko purnatah pratishthit kar diya
 After this Brajbhasha got out of the Hindi poetry stream
 isane hindi ko nae shabd, pratik tathaa bimb die
 This effect also enriched the language of prose of this period
 hindi kavita main chhayavaad kaa yug dvivedi yug ke baad aayaa
 The poetry of Dwivedi era was monotonous didactic and chronological
 chhayavaad main iske viruddh vidroh karte hue kalpanapradhan, bhavonmeshyukt kavita rachi gai
 It was greatly influenced by the Gitanjali of the famous poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore of Bangla of his era at the level of language and sentiments
 yah pracheen sanskrit sahitya or madhyakaalin hindi sahitya se bhi prabhavit hui
 In this, the influence of Buddhist philosophy and Sufi philosophy is also targeted
 chhayavadyug us saanskrithik or saahitiyik jaagran kaa saarvbhaum vikaaskaal tha jiskaa aarambh rashtriya paridhi main bhaaratenduyug se hua tha
 Not only the subtle emotional philosophy of the poet, 'chhaya' also introduces his subtle articulation
 uski kavyakala main vaacharth kii apeksha lakshanikta or dhvanyaatmakataa he
 There is also malaise due to the purity of the feeling
 style main raag kii navdbuddhata athwa naveen vyanjaktaa he
 In the Dwivedi era, poetry was composed of poetry
 vastut: gadhy kaa prabandh hi usamen padya ho gaya tha, bhashaa bhi gadhyvat ho gai thi
 Shadowism broke the structure of the verse and made the standing dialect poetic
 padya main sthool itivrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak atanrvrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak antarvrutt aa gaya
 According to sentiment, the language and verses of Chhayavad also became emotional and sentimental
 brajabhasha ke baad chhayavaad dwaara geetkavy kaa punarutthan hua
 Representative poets of the Shadow Age era are Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi, Ramkumar
 purvanugami sahyogi hai- maakhanlaal or 'naveen'
 After Geetakavya, the epic was also produced in Chhatism
 tulsidas jaise 'swant:' ko lekar loksangrah ke path par agrasar hue the vaise hi chhayavaad ke kavi bhi 'swatm' ko lekar ekant ke swagat jagat se saarvajanik jagat main agrasar hue
 Prasad's 'kamayani' and Pant's 'lokayatan' are proof of this
 'kamayani' sindhu main vindu kii ore he, 'lokayatan' vindu main sindhu kii ore
 Around 1917, the poet Maithili Sharan Gupta, Mukutdhar Pandey, etc
, tended to give Khadiboli poetry a more imaginative, pictorial, and emotional expression
 This free and novel method was finding its way out that the mystical poems of Rabindranath were celebrated
 or kai kavi ek saath rahasyavaad or pratikwaad athwa chitrabhashavad ko hi ekant dhairya banakar chal pade
 When the goal was fixed on the picture language or expression method, then the field of cosmic or supernatural love was deemed to be the rest for its performance
 is bandhe hue kshetra ke bheetar chalanevaale kavy ne chhayavaad naam grahan kiya
 The use of the word shadowy should be understood in two meanings
 ek to rahasyavaad ke arth main, jahaan uskaa sambandh kavy-vastu se hota he arthath jahaan kavi us anant or agyaat priyatam ko alamban banaakar atyant chitramayi bhashaa main prem kaa anek prakaar se vyanjan karata he
 The second use of this meaning is in the broader sense of poetry-style or method-specific
 'shadowism generally means the presentation of the unprepared as a euphemistic shadow in place of the present
 chhayavaad kaa chalan dvivedi kaal kii rukhi itivrittatmak kii pratikriya ke rup main hua tha
 For example, my honey songs are hidden in a pile of dust, unknowingly
 prakruti ke sookshm kintu vyakt saundarya main aadhyatmik chaaya kaa bhaan mere vichaar se chhayavaad kii ek sarvamaanya vyakhya honi chahie
 ' dwitiya mahayuddh ke samaapt hote saare desh main nai chetana kii lahar daud gai
 In 1929, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, India became determined to sweep away foreign slavery
 ise sirf raajnneeti tak hi simit nahin samajhnaa chaiye
 It was an attempt to understand the self-image of the entire country and by correcting its mistakes, it was resolved to move towards the antipathy towards the rich nations of the world
 sankshep main, yah ek mahaan saanskrithik andolan tha
 Mindful orientation was the main origin of this poem and its strong faith in the changing mind
 is shrenee ke kavi grahikashakti se bahut adhik sampann the or saamaajik vishmata or asamanjasyon ke prati atyadhik sajag the
 In terms of style too, they were completely different from earlier poets
 inaki rachana mukhyatah vishayi pradhan thi
 In the 1920s Khadiboli poetry, the primacy of the theme remained
 parantu iske baad kii kavita main kavi ke apane raag-viraag kii pradhanta ho gai
 How is the subject in itself? This was not the main thing
 balki mukhya baat yah rah gai thi ki vishayi ke chitt ke raag-viraag se anuranjit hone ke baad vishay kaisaa dikhta he ? parinaam vishay isamen gaun ho gaya or kavi pramukh’ Around 1920, the enlightened consciousness of the era, depressed by external expression, started self-oriented introverted cultivation, it was expressed in poetry as shadowism ' ‘ chhayavaad shabd kaa arth chaahe jo ho, parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se yah prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi kii un samast kavitaaon kaa dyotak he, jo 1918 se 36 i
 ke bich likhi gayi
 'he further writes-' Shadowism is the poetic expression of the national awakening which wanted liberation from the old stereotypes on the one hand and foreign subjugation on the other
 ’ Prasad ji says in the end- the Indian poetry relies more on the perception and feeling of expression from the Indian point of view
 dhvanyaatmakataa, lakshanikta, saundarya, prakruti-vidhaan tathaa upachaar vakrata ke saath swanubhuti kii vivritti chhayavaad kii visheshtaayen hai
 ' chhayavaad kii pramukh pravritiyon kaa vibhaajan ham teen yaa do sheershakon ke antargat kar sakate hai
 All the poets in Shadowism have expressed their experience as my experience
 is main style ke peeche aadunik yuvak kii swayan ko abhivyakt karne kii saamaajik saamaajik swatantraaa kii aakanksha he
 The dramatic and empirically proven dramatic system of expression through the characters of the story or the mythological characters was not fully capable of expressing its sentiments
 vyaktik abhivyakti kii swatantraaa vyakti kii mukti se sambhddha thi
 This personal expression is well beyond the devotion of devout poets
 yah aihik vyaktikta aavaran hin thi
 There was no cover of religion on this
 saamanti naitikta ko asweekaar karte hue pant ne uchhavas or ansu kii balika se sidhe shabdon main apana pranay prakat kiya he:-"balika meri manoram mitra thi
 "moving beyond the personal area, Nirala wrote a condolence on the death of his daughter and clearly stated many things in life

 Similarly, through his story Nirala has attacked old social stereotypes and modern vampires through his story

 Many details of history information are found in the Puranas, Jain and Buddhist texts and the description of Greek historians
 tathaapi itnaa nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki nand ek kshatray rajvansh tha jisaki adhikansh prakrutiyaan bhartiya shashan parampara kii thi
 Curtius states that Shakara's father was actually the son of a poor barber at the time of Alexander, from the accounts of Greek writers it is known that he was the "present king" Agramas or Jandramas, who are identified with Dhanananda
 uskaa pita mahapadmanand tha, jo curtius ke upyukt kathan se kshatriya varna kaa thahartaa he
 In some Purana texts and Jain texts "appendix Parva", he is also called the son of Naipit
 in anek sandarbhon se keval ek baat spasht hoti he ki nandavansh ke raja nyaay kshatriya varna ke the
 He was the first and best-known king of Nandavansh

 He is also called Ugrasena in Jain texts and Mahapadmapati in Puranas
 puraanon ke kaliyugarajavrittantavle anshon main use atibali, mahakshatrantic or or parashuram kii sangyaayen di gai hai
 It is clear that the king with very large army, after destroying many contemporary Kshatriya dynasties, demonstrated his force
 yah aashcharya nahin ki us apaar dhan or sainyashakti se usne himalay or narmada ke bich ke saare pradeshon ko jeetne kaa upkram kiya
 His conquered territories included Akshvaku, Panchal, Kauravya, Kashi, Haihay, Ashmak, Vitihotra, Kalinga, Shursen, Mithila, and many other states
 himalay or vindhyachal ke bich kahin bhi uske shasno kaa ulanghan nahin ho saktaa tha
 Thus he ruled the whole earth as "erat

 See their names there gangan paal, panduk, pandugati, bhootpal, rashtrapal, govishanak, dashasiddhak, kaivart or dhananand, chand nand Chandragupta Maurya was the son of the monarch Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda of the Nanda dynasty, whose real name was Chandranand, whose mother was from a Brahmin family, Mahapadmananda was followed by his son Dhanananda, who feared Sikandar
 dhananand ne mantri chanakya ko petakar sabha se isaliye baahar nikaala diya chanakya dhananand se pehle singhaasana par baith gayi the 
 Chanakya provoked Dhananand's half-brother Chandranand to kill Dhananand by deceiving Chandranand and made Chandranand Crow king and named Chandranand Crow as Chandragupta Maurya

 In the Puranas, the reign of all of them is told for 100 years - Mahapadmananda for 88 years and his sons for 12 years
 kintu ek hi vyakti 88 varshon tak rajya karata rahe or uske baad ke kramagat 8 raja keval 12 varshon tak hi rajya karen, yah buddhigrahya nahin prathit hota
 The reign of the Nawanandas in the Sinhalese rituals is stated to be 40 years and we can consider it right

 It is certain that the last king among them was the king of Magadha at the time of Alexander's invasion, Agramas (son of Ugrasen), whose Greek soldiers, fearing the huge and powerful armies, refused to proceed after the battle with Porus
 plutark kahata he ki chandragupta maury ne sikandar se milakar uski nichkulotpatti or janata main apriyata kii baat kahi thi
 It is possible that Chandragupta has also tried to use that foreign invader to overthrow Dhanananda
 "mahavanshatika" se gyaat hota he ki antim nand kathor shaasha tathaa lobhi or kripan swabhaav kaa vyakti tha
 Probably due to this greedy nature, he was called Dhanananda
 usne chanakya kaa apmaan bhi kiya tha
 This is confirmed by the play Mudrarakshasa, which suggests that Chanakya was removed from his post
 apamaanit hokar usne nand samrajya ke unmoolan kii shapath lee or rajkumaar chandragupta maury ke sahyog se use us kaary main safalataa mili
 Both of them prepared a huge army from the regions of Punjab for that task, which probably also included some foreign elements and robbers
 yah bhi gyaat hota he ki chandragupta ne dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane main parvatak se bhi sandhi kii thi
 He made two attacks on Magadha, it seems correct, but the "divyavadaan" obedience that he first attacked Magadha's capital Pataliputra and failed and he and Chanakya had to flee to save their lives, Does not seem right

 Rhinestone skulls or skulls are a number of sculptures carved into the hard-stone of a human skull made of clear or milky quartz rock, known as "rock crystal" in the history of art and having pre-columbian Central American artifacts by their so-called inventors

 Some members of the New Age movement often claim to show paranormal effects of these skulls and are often presented in a similar way in a fictional story

 The trade of pre-columbian counterfeit artifacts had developed in the late 19th century to the extent that in 1886 Smithsonian archaeologist William Henry Holmes wrote an article entitled "trade in Counterfeit Mexican Antiques" for Science
 Although museums had acquired skulls before that, an antiques dealer named Eugene Boban, who opened his shop in Paris in 1870, is associated with most of the 19th-century museum collections of rhinestone skulls
 boban kaa, teen sphatik khopadiyon samet, adhikansh sangrah nrivanshavigyaanshastri alphonse pinart ko bechaa gaya tha, jisane us sangrah ko trocadero sangrahalay, jo baad main muji di homm bana, ko daan kar diya
 Many crystal skulls are claimed to be pre-columbian and are generally thought to belong to Aztec or Mayan civilizations
 madhamerica kala main khopadiyon kaa anginat pratinidhitiv he, lekin sangrahalayon ke sangrahon main se koi bhi pramanit khudaai se praapt kiya hua nahin he
 Research on numerous crystal skulls at the British Museum in 1967, 1996 and again in 2004 showed that jagged lines depicting teeth were created using a jeweler's tool developed in the 19th century, making their possible pre-columbian origin doubtful
 looks like
 sphatik ke prakaar kaa nishchay chlorite samaveshkon ke pareekshan se kiya gaya, or jo keval madagascar or brazil main paaya jaataa he, or isaliye purvacolambeey madhamerica main aprapya yaa agyaat he
 The study concluded that these skulls were manufactured in 19th-century Germany, presumably in the late 19th century, in the factories of the city of idar-oberstein, famous for the production of imported Brazilian quartz items

 But they have also been obtained from sites in other cultures, one of which has been deliberately deposited in the synoptic realm of Tinoctitlan, which is estimated to have been buried 2000 years ago by the Aztecs, which seems to have led them to Roman in Europe

 Although various claims have been made over the years about the physical properties of the cranium, such as 70 ° F

 Boban later moved his business to New York City, where the skull was sold to George H

 Exhibited by Kunz in 1887 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York City
 It was sold at an auction and bought by Tiffany & Co
