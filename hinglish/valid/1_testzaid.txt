 The mutual broadcasting system, which Westwood One acquired two years ago, followed suit and essentially merged with NBC Radio

 In 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice president at RCA, and a desperate NBC tried to lure Fred Silverman from number-one ABC to reverse the network's fortunes
 Apart from notable exceptions of Different Strokes, Real People, The Facts of Life and the short series Shogan, he too could not get any hits
 Failures quickly gathered in his bag

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Khalsa is a collective form of duly initiated followers of Sikhism
 khalsa panth kii sthapana guru gobind singh ji ne 1699 ko baisakhi vaale din anandpur sahib main kii
 On this day, he made five love amritpan by making Khalsa first and after that he also performed Amritpanan by the hands of those five loves
 satguru gobind singh ne khalsa mahima main khalsa ko "kaal purakh kii fuj" pad se niwaja he
 Sikhs and hair were already with the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh fixed the "khande Bate ki Pahul" and also gave it Kacha, Kadha and comb
 isi din khalse ke naam ke peeche "singh" lag gaya
 Khalse's body began to be seen in physical appearance
 par khalse ne aatm gyaan nahin choda, us kaa prachaar chalata rahaa or aavashyaktaa padane par talwaar bhi chalati rahi
 The attacks of other religions and governmental Numindo over Sikhism had steadily increased
 sarkaar ko galat khabaren de kar islam ke kattar anuyaayiyon ne guru arjuna dev ji ko maut kii sajaa dilava di
 When Guru Arjun Dev was martyred with great grief, Guru Hargobind ji lifted the sword
 yah talwaar sirf aatm raksha or aam janata kii behatari ke liye uthaai thi
 In the life of Guru Hargobind ji, there were 4 consecutive attacks on him and there was also an attack on Satguru Hari Rai
 guru hari krishna ko bhi badshaah aurangzeb ne apana anuyaayi banane kii koshish kii
 The government killed Guru Tegh Bahadur, because he had gone to appeal to the government after seeing the sufferings of the Hindu Brahmins
 uske baad sarkari ahalakaaron ne gurmat ke badhate prachaar va anuyaayiyon kii baari sankhya ko apane dharm ke liye khatra samajhnaa shuru kar diya or wo iske viruddh ekajute ho gaye
 Meanwhile Guru Gobind Singh composed some banis which had strict comments against Islam
 uparokt paristhitayon tathaa aurangzeb or uske numaayindon ke gaiyr-muslim janata ke prati atyaachaari vyavhaar ko dekhte hue dharm kii raksha hetu jab guru gobind singh ne sashastr sangharsh kaa nirnay liya to unhone aise sikhon kii talash kii jo gurmat vichaardhaara ko aage badhaaen, dukhiyon kii madad karen or zaroorat padhne par apana balidaan dene main bhi peeche naa haten| When a religion progresses, it is very common to see that its followers are many, most of them are seen, some are in the shadows, some are due to their own self-will, the real followers are counted only as they are Huh
 is baat kaa pramaan anandpur main mila
 When Satgur Gobind Singh came out with a sword and said, "he needs a head"
 All of them were stunned
 Some slip away from the spot
 The Guru started going mad
 Some came to watch the spectacle
 Some mata ran to Gujri to see what Khumdi is cooking
 10 hazaar kii bheed main se pehla haath bhai dayaa singh ji kaa tha | gurmat vichaardhaara ke peeche voh sir katwane kii shamata rakhata tha | guru sahib usko tamboo main le gaye | vahaan ek bakre kii gardan kaati | khun tamboo se bahar nikalataa dikhaai diya | janata main dar or bad gaya | tab bhi himat dikhaa kar dharm singh, himmat singh, mohakam singh, sahib singh ne apana sis katwanaa sweekaar kiya | guru sahib bakre jhatakate rahe | The five then got out of the tent and the khate bate ka pahul ta yar
 khanda bata, jantra mantra or tantra ke smel se bana he
 It was first built by Satgur Gobind Singh
 is vidhi se hua tayar jal ko "pahul" kehete hai
 In common language, it is also called Amrit
 is ko pi kar sikh, khalsa fuj, kaa hisa ban jaataa he arthath ab usne tan man dhan sab parameshwar ko saunp diya he, ab wo sirf sach kaa prachaar karegaa or zarurat padhne par wo apana galaa kataane se peeche nahin hatega
 Will stay away from all vices
 aise sikh ko amritadhari bhi kaha jaataa he
 This Pahul was fed to all five and got them from the title of five loves
 2 kakkar to sikh dharm main pehle se hi the
 Where Sikhs understood spiritually even on all things, Satgur Gobind Singh ji separated the Khalsa in the physical look by giving them comb, kadha and kacha along with those two kakars
 aaj khande bate kii pahul paanch pyaare hi tayar karte hai
 This process has become a custom today
 aaj waisi pariksha nahin lee jaati jaisi us same lee gai thi
 This process is also called Amrit Sanchar
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki guru gobind singh ji bhi paanch pyaaron ke aadhin chalaa karte the or un ke hukum ko mana karte the
 The five loves ordered Gobind Singh to leave the fort of Chamkor and he had to obey
 paanch pyaaron ne phir gobind singh ji ko tokaa, jab gobind singh in kii parakh ke liye dadu kii kabr par namaskara kar rahe the
 Gobind Singh also sent Banda Bahadur with five loves, history mentions that when Banda Bahadur continued to violate the love, Banda Bahadur was all left in the fort
 gobind singh or khalsa fuj ne bahadur shah kii madad kii or use shaasha banane ke liye uske bhai se loha bhi liya
 It was Khalsa who discovered the bani of Guru Gobind Singh and molded it as a book

 If the air from the glass tube is pumped out and electrified in a high voltage respectively, then the air starts to self-illuminate when the pressure is low enough
 is ghatana kaa praayogic adhyayan karte samay rantjan ne yah dekha ki vaayu kaa daab atyant alp hone par kaach kii nalika main se jo kirane aati hai, unase barium platinosynide ke manibh prakaash dene lagate hai or, nalika ko kaale kaagaj se purna rup se dhakne par bhi, paas main rakhe manibh dhyutimaan hote rahete hai
 Therefore, it was clear that the rays coming out of the esophagus could easily pass through the black paper and these rays have the special property of damaging the screen of barium platenocyanide
 vigyaan main is prakaar kii kirane tab tak gyaat nahin thim
 So these newly invented rays were named 'x-rays', but in honor of Rantzen, especially in Germany, these rays are called 'rantzen rays'
 rantjan ke avishkaar ke prakashit hote hi sampurna vaigyanik vishwa kaa dhyaan eksre kii ore aakrisht hua
 The x-ray property of crossing through opaque solids was extremely important and this property could be used in many departments of science
 at: anek bhautikee prayogshaalaon main eksre ke utpaadan tathaa unke gundharmo ke adhyayan ke praytn hone lage
 The study of electric immersion in air at low pressure has a special place in the development of modern physics
 yadi kaanch kii ek lambii nalika ko nirvaat pump se jodakar bheetar kii vaayu main ucch vibhav kii vidyudwara pravaahit kii jaae to prarambh main, jab daab adhik rahati he tab, koi kriya dikhaai nahin detii, kintu vaayu kii daab jab alp ho jaati he tab pehle donon vidyudagr dhyutimaan hote hai
 Lowering the pressure further reduces the entire tube
 aadhunik bhautikee kii vyakhya ke anusaar iskaa kaaran he ki jab electranon ko urja praapt hoti he or ve dhanagar kii ore ati veg se jate samay shesh vaayu ke anuon se sanghaat karte hai
 The ions of molecules are formed due to the collisions and when these ions get to the previous state then light is emitted
 yanon ke astitv ke kaaran vaayu main vidyudvisarjan jari rahata he
 When the pressure is too low, there are not enough molecules to collide with the electrons; Therefore, the electrons come out of the minuscule and collide directly with the material with all their energy
 in sanghaton ke kaaran electranon kii teevr urja dhanagar ke parmaanuon ko mil jaati he or iskaa ek parinaam eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 This method requires a critical pressure in the tube to produce an x-ray
 vaayu kii daab yadi is kranthik daab se adhik ho to eksre ke utpaadan ke liye paryaapt urja electranon main nahin rahati 
 On the other hand, if the pressure is less than this critical pressure, electrons are not generated, so the electric discharge stops
 prarambh main eksre kaa utpaadan isi prakaar kii vayunalee kaa upyog karke kiya jaataa tha or vaayu kii daab ko mahatprayas se is kranthik daab ke maan par rakhaa jaataa tha
 Two special properties of X-rays are more important: tivrathamapan kii teen mukhya vidhiyaan hai
 The intensity of the fluorescence from the X-ray on the fluorescent screen — to the extent of the illumination — is proportional to the intensity of the X-ray
 pratidipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan karke eksre kii tivrata kii tulana sthool rup se ho sakati he
 In the second method, the action of X-ray above the photo palette is used
 eksre ke aapatan se photo pattica par jo kaalaapan aata he, vah eksre kii tivrata tathaa aapatan kaal par nirbhar rahata he
 This method allows the action of an X-ray of greater intensity to take place at the appropriate place on a photo plate with a higher intensity of the X-ray beam, and then the action of the second X-ray beam on the same plaque down t, 2t
 , 3t etc
 pattica ko viksit karne ke pashchaat donon chitron ke kaalepan kii tulana karne se donon punjon kii saapeksh tivrata kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 The third method of intensity measurement is more prevalent, because intensity can be measured precisely in this manner
 jab eksre vaayu main se jaati he tab vaayu vidyucchalak ho jaati he or uski chaalakata eksre kii tivrata par nirbhar rahati he
 The electrons of air molecules are displaced by the action of X-rays and ions are produced
 uchit vidyudvibhav kii upasthiti main yanon se jo vidyuddhara praapt hoti he, vah samvedi vidyunmapi se, athwa anya uchit samvedi upkarnon se, maapi ja sakati he
 The intensity of the x-ray is proportional to the electrode
 haal main gunak-prakashanalika or eksre-samvedi sphur ke upyog se tivrata kaa maapan atyant sulabh ho gaya he
 Similarly, the stream of ionization can also be easily measured with the help of a gelatinizer
 at: vartmaankaal main in donon prakaar ke upkarnon dwaara eksre kii tivrata kaa maapan adhik prachlit he
 These three popular methods of intensity measurement can only compare the intensities of the two x-ray elements, the absolute intensity cannot be achieved
 apati eksre ke lambavat ek varg centimetre kshetrafal par prati senkad jo urja padati he, usko vastut: ham us eksre kii tivrata kah sakate hai
 This intensity is expressed in ergs per square centimeter per second
 tivrata kaa maapan urja ke rup main karne ke liye eksre kii urja ko ushma atyant alp hone ke kaaran is reeti se tivrathamapan ke liye atyant sookshmagrahi vishisht upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this manner, Terrill made the first attempt to intensify
 iske pashchaat 1953 i
 main america main ilinay vishvavidhyalay ke henderson, beati evam laafan ne bhi praytn kiye
 The intensity of the x-ray generated by very high current can only be measured in this way
 bhautikee ke praayogic kaaryo main sadaa ekakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or maapi gai raashi ke anusaar iskaa swaroop hota he
 The unit of X-ray quantity is called 'rantzen' and in the present tense the definition of a Rantzen is as follows- eksre kaa doosraa vishesh gundharm unki thos padaartho main praveshkshmata he
 The decrease in the intensity of the X-ray is not the same when the different solids are passed through the same mass
 kuch thos padaartho main eksre kaa avasorana adhik hota he ore kuch padaartho main kam
 The result of this experiment is that if the x-ray crosses the different mots of a particular solid, then the output x-ray is related to the intensity, initial intensity and thickness of the solid according to the following equation: log = – m × motaai --- Here = initial intensity of x-ray; i = thos padaarth main se paar hone ke pashchaat eksre kii tivrata; m = a constant, called the absorption multiplier
 is sthiraank ko us thos vishesh eksre-avasorana-gunak kehete hai
 In fact it is a linear multiplier
 isko vyapak rup main vyakt karne ke liye main us thos padaarth ke ghanatv kaa bhaag diya jaataa he or is prakaar praapt avasorana gunank ko 'sanhati-avasorana-gunank' kehete hai
 Therefore mmass = m / ghanatv The special significance of the Samhita-absorption-multiplier is that it is the characteristic property of the absorbing material
 udaahranarth, jal or bhaap kaa rekhiy avasorana-gunak bhinn hota he, kyonki jal drav he or bhaap gas hai
 But the exergy-absorption-coefficient of water and steam is the same, because the chemical preservatives of water and steam are integral, namely, hydrogen and oxygen
 prakaash or eksre ke gundharmo kii bhinnata sanhati-avasorana-gunak se atyant spasht ho jaati he
 Generally, liquids and solids are themselves opaque or translucent to light
 prakaash ke liye hira paardarshee or graphite apaardarshee he, parantu eksre kaa sanhati-avasorana-gunank hira tathaa graphite ke liye samaan hi rahata he, kyonki ye donon padaarth vastut: carbon ke hi vibhinn swaroop hai
 Absorption coefficients of the entire X-rays from the X-ray tube are mainly dependent on both the electrical current and the atomic number of the metal of the absorber screen
 jaise jaise vibhav badhata jaataa he vaise hi vaise utpaadit eksre kii praveshkshmata athwa kathorta badhati jaati he
 The equation leads to the conclusion that the absorption multiplier for a single solid will be constant for all the masses
 kintu pratyaksh prayog main eksre nalika se praapt vikiran kaa nune praveshkshamtawala bhaag avasorak parade ke pratham staron main hi purnataya avashoshit ho jaataa he 
 Only X-rays of high penetrability reach the final levels of the absorption screen
 spasht he ki avasorana parade main pravesh karanevaale eksre kaa avasorana gunank parade se paar nikle hue eksre ke avasorana gunak se adhik hota he
 When the absorption multiplier of all x-rays is the same, then they are called homogeneous x-rays
 at: eksre kii maatra unki tivrata se or unki visheshta unke avasorana-gunak se maapit hota he
 We can see the matter from which light comes, because light rays have an action on the design of our eye
 is prakaar kii kriya eksre dwaara nahin hoti, at: eksre drishy nahin hai
 Not only this, the action of each other on the eyes and other parts of the body is very harmful
 jivit koshaaon par eksre kii paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se ve mritt ho jaati hai
 X-rays easily cross through the skin and they are likely to die due to their long-term action on the living cells within
 phir, eksre ke prabhaav tikaoo hote he; at: sharir ke ek hi sthaan par bhinn-bhinn samayon par bhi eksre kii kriya hoti rahane par kuch kaal main cancer sadrush du:saadhy rog ho jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to work very carefully while using X-ray
 sharir kii raksha ke liye vishesh saadhan upyog main laae jate hai
 In addition, current x-ray users keep an x-ray-measure in their pocket in the present tense, which shows how much radiation has worked on the employee
 eksre ke is ghaatak gundharm kaa anya rogon main upyog bhi kiya jaataa he; jaise, sharir ke kisi bhaag main anisht roganuon kii vruddhi hoti ho to unpar eksre kaa prayog karke unhen nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 X-rays are used more in medicine, especially in surgery
 is prakaar ke upyog kii sambhaavna eksre ke avishkaar ke samay se hi spasht thi
 Different elements of the body have different absorption-multipliers; Therefore, by taking an x-ray from any part of the body and taking a photo, the bones and other components are seen separately
 at: shalya kriya ke purv, athwa yah gyaat karne ke liye ki rog kis avasthaa main he eksre photo atyant upyogi hote hai
 As the production of X-rays progressed, they started to be used in industries as well, and in the present times the use of X-rays in metallurgy has become necessary
 urja yaa to kanon ke saath athwa tarangon ke saath sanyukt rahati he
 If energy is emitted from an origin, the existence of this energy is usually expressed in the intensity of electromagnetic waves, or as the kinetic energy of particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, ions etc
 tarang or kan ke swaroop bhinn hote hai; isliye inako saadhaarant: bhinn virgo main rakhaa jaataa he
 But it has become clear from the results of many experiments that the bonding of these classes has properties of particles in waves and, conversely, particles also have properties of waves
 is dwait rup kaa prarambh plank ke ushmavikiran ke siddhant se prarambh hua
 The properties of X-rays are also no exception to this dual form
 eksre ke katipay gun tarangon ke hai tathaa katipay gun kanon ke bhi hai
 First we will consider the wavelet properties

 yah mitra jeev / prakritik shatru hanikaarak keedon ko nasht karte rahete hai or unki sankhya ko aarthik haani str se neeche rakhane main hamaari sahaayta karte hai
 We often spray chemical insecticides only if other insects are not able to identify friendly insects and enemy insects, or in the absence of an expected invasion of enemy insects or the ratio of enemy insects and friendly insects
 Ways not be successful rasinic keet naashkon kaa chhidkaav unheen paudhon yaa panktiyon par karen jahaan aakruman aarthik haani str se adhik ho
 We should constantly monitor crops, that is, we should always assess the presence and number of harmful insects, friendly organisms, diseases, weeds

 Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 If a single thread is formed and is not broken, it is a thread continuity syrup
 yadi do dhaage kaa gathan ho rahe he or tuutata nahin he, to yah do dhaagaa nirantarata chaashni ke he
 If the three threads formed are not broken, then this three thread continuity is syrup
 is syrup kii ek boond thande pani main daalane par yah gend ke aakaar me aa jaayegi
 Similarly, to increase the number of threads, you can boil the pan
 jab chaashni vaanchit sthirataa tak pahunch jaye, to kadaahi garm stove se utaar den
 If you want to reduce the sugar syrup, add a few spoons of cold water

 Zamindari system was a political-social practice prevalent in India during the Mughal era and the British period in which the land was owned by someone else rather than by the people who collected taxes from the cultivators
 bharat ke swatantrat hone ke baad yah pratha samaapt kar di gayi
 According to the ancient ideology of India, land was public property, so it could not be the property of the person

 According to Maharishi Jaimini, "the king could not surrender the land because it is not his property but the combined property of human society
" isaliye isapar sabakaa samaan rup se adhikaar he"
 Manu also has a clear statement that "according to the rishis, the first right to own land is the one who plowed the forest and cleaned it"

 uparyukt varnan keval bhudhruti ke vargeekaran ko ingit karata he, na ki krishak ko ek angl das ke str par pahunchaa detaa he
 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze
 lard cornwalis bhi jameendaari pratha ke paksh main tha

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help
 is prakaar bharatvarsh ke itihaas main sarvapratham in bandobaston dwaara rajya or krishakon ke bich main jameendaaron kaa varg angrejon kii niti dwaara sthapit hua jiske fal swaroop krishakon ke bhu-sampatti adhikaar, jo anadi kaal se chale aa rahe the, chhin gaye
 This intermediate class became wealthier day by day as the British rulers continued to give more and more of their money as a bait
 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system
 is pratham charan main, jo san 1859 i0 se 1929 i0 tak rahaa, jo kanoon bane unase jameendaaron ke lagaan badhaane ke adhikaron par kuch pratibandh lagaae gaye or ucch shrenee ke krishakon ko laabh bhi hue
 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers

 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
