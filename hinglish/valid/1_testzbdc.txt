 ] Mirza Najaf Khan was a Persian adventurer in the court of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II
 iske safaavi vansh ko nadir shah ne 1735 main padchyut kar diya tha
 Najaf Khan came to India in 1740
 isaki bahan kaa vivaah avadh ke nawab se hua tha
 It also got the rank of Deputy Wazir of Awadh
 mirza 1722 se apni mrityu paryant mughal sena kaa sipahasaalar rahaa tha
 He died in April, 1782
 iske baad iskaa makbara nai dilli ke lodhi road ke nikat karbala kshetra main sthit he
 Najafgarh, located in south-west Delhi, is named after Najaf Khan
 elahabaad ke faujadaar mohammad kuli khan kaa mamaa
 In the time of Mohammed Quli, Najaf Khan was the keeper of the fort of Allahabad
 najaf khan roj raat ke samay pichley pahar gupt maarg se aakar us angreji sena par dhaava karata jo udabaa naala ke durg ke baahar bengal ke nawab mir kasim ko pakadaney ke liye padi hui thi or anekon ko samaapt kar lut kaa maal lekar usee maarg se laut jaataa tha
 The British army could not follow him in any way
 ant main mir kasim kii sena ke ek angrej sainik ne vishwasghaat kiya
 He saw the secret passage of Najaf Khan very well
 4 sitambar 1763 i
 kii raat main vah angreji sena ko usee maarg se liva laayaa or mir kasim ke pandrah hajaar sainik kaam aae
 Now Mir Qasim thought of seeking help from Nawab shuja-ud-daula of Awadh, but Najaf refused him and drew his attention to the horrific consequences
 kintu mir kasim na mana or najaf use chhodkar bundelkhand ke sardaar hindoopati kii seva main chalaa gaya
 Shuja's eyes were on Bundelkhand and hence he pledged to help Mir Qasim after defeating Hindupati
 is par mir kasim ne kaary sheeghra samaapt karne ke liye swayan hindoopati par chadhaai kar di
 Najaf compromised diplomacy by intimidating Hindupati
 mir kasim vijayi hokar shuja ke paas elahabaad laut aayaa
 Seeing Najaf's successful diplomacy and military aptitude, the British called him from Bundelkhand and joined him before fighting Shuja
 najaf ko shuja se purana bair tha is kaaran usne angrejon ko sahaayta dena saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 From 1764 AD, he became a great assistant to the British
 shuja ke viruddh sahaayta dene ke badale main use shuja kii bhoomi kaa kuch bhaag athwa dhan dene kaa laalach diya gaya
 But Najaf was very clever
 vah angrejon se us samay mila jab ki baxur ke yuddh kaa parinaam unke paksh main nishchit ho gaya
 He helped a lot in winning the fort of Allahabad
 vah us kile kaa rakshak rah chukaa tha or uske rahasyon se parichit tha
 The British gave responsibility for the settlement of Awadh and Allahabad to Mirza Najaf Khan
 vah kadaa kaa faujadaar bhi niyukt kiya gaya kintu shuja or malhaar raav holkar kii senaaon ke sammukh april, 1765 i
 main uski haar hui or use aatmasamarpan kar dena padaa
 Shuja welcomed him
 holkar kaa ahan dekh usne shuja ko angrejon se sandhi karne kii salaah di
 Shuja asked him to meet the British
 avasar paakar nazaf ne dhokhaa diya or 30 april 1765 i
 ko vah angrejon se ja mila
 When there was peace after the war, out of Bengal's 26 lakh annual tax, two lakh were paid annually to Najaf
 vah kadaa kaa faujadaar bhi niyukt kiya gaya kintu shashan prabandh main asafal hone par 21 farvari 1770 i
 ko use paduchyat kar diya gaya
 His mentor, the British asked Shah Alam to behave with kindness towards him
 shah alam dilli yatra main nazaf kii sevaaon se laabh uthaanaa chahta tha atev usne use kshamaa kar diya
 In 1771 AD he went to Delhi with Shah Alam
 vahaan usne kuch varshon tak mritpraaya: mughal shashan tabha vaibhav main phir ek baar jaan daali
 He drove the Jats out of Mathura
 11 disambar 1773 i
 ko usne agra nagar par or 18 farvari 1774 i
 ko agra ke kile par jaaton ko bhagaakar adhikaar kar liya
 Seeing his influence and military talent in Delhi, Nawab Wazir Shuja-ud-daulah considered forgetting the enmity and befriending him
 usne najaf ko bhent ke liye aamantrit kiya or use naayab vazeer manonith kiya
 Shuja also prepared him to assist against the Ruhels and by this he persuaded Shah Alam to lead the army
 ruhela yuddh ke pashchaat bulandshahr, mujffar nagar, meerut, agra, panipat, sonpat, haansi tathaa hisar main nazaf khan kaa prabhaav kshetra sweekaar kiya gaya jisase shuja kaa koi sambandh nahin tha
 Setting this limit, Shuja limited Najaf's ambition
 shuja ne use uttari bharat kaa atyant mahatvapurn vyakti sweekaar kiya or apni kanya kaa sambandh uske saath sthapit kar use apana damaad bhi bana liya
 He died in 1782 AD

 kisi bhautik raashi kaa pariman sankhyaon main vyakt karne ko maapan kaha jaataa he
 Measurement is basically a process of comparison
 isamen kisi bhautik raashi kii maatra kii tulana ek purvanirdhaarit maatra se kii jaati he
 This predefined quantity is called a unit for that particular amount
 udhaaharan ke liye jab ham kehete hai ki kisi ped kii unchaai 10 meter he to ham us ped kii uchai kii tulana ek meter se kar rahe hote hai
 Here the meter is a standard unit used for physical amount length or distance
 isi prakaar samay kaa maatrak second, dravyaman kaa maatrak kilogram aadi hai
 Lord Calvin's following statement proves the importance of measurement - shodh vidhitantr main maapan ko vargeekrut karne kaa ek tarika he maapan ke str kaa nirdhaaran
 Since in measurement, properties are expressed by numbers and numbers have some natural and basic properties such as their exclusiveness, seriality, being located at fixed intervals, etc
; We can classify measurements on the basis of how many properties of numbers are included in it
 is aadhaar par manovaigyanik stanley smith stavence ne maapan ke chaar str bataae - namik maapak, kramik maapak, antaraal maapak or anupaat maapak
 These categories are used in research work and there it is important in the selection of statistical methods being used to test the truth of a hypothesis
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi maapan namik yaa kramik str par he to uplabdh aankade kaa ausat gyaat karne ke liye samaantar madhya nahin nikaala ja saktaa keval bahulak kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In order to get the right knowledge about them while studying natural subjects, it is necessary that we measure some properties of nature
 saadharantaya yah paaya gaya he ki maap main mukhya rup se teen rashiyaan, lambaai, bhaar tathaa samay, uplabdh hoti hai
 Theoretically, the above quantities are included in each measurement
 in raashiyon main se kisi ko bhi maapne ke liye koi nishchit tathaa suvidhajanak pariman ko maanak maan liya jaataa he
 The entire volume is measured in it
 isko ham us vishesh raashi kii ikai, yaa ekak, athwa maatrak maanate hai
 For example, we count the meaning in rupees and the weight in kilograms
 vibhinn prakaar kii ikaiyaan upyog main laai jaati hai
 In science, length, weight and time have been termed as basic units, because these three quantities do not depend on each other
 anya sabhi prakaar kii ikaayiyon kaa aadhaar mul ikaiyaan hi hoti hai
 These other units are termed as derived units
 is prakaar kshetrafal kaa ikai ek aise varg kaa kshetrafal he jisaki lambaai ek ho tathaa chaudaai bhi ek ho
 a unit of volume is considered to be the volume of a money that has the length of each arm
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki kshetrafal kii ikai tathaa aaytan kii ikai lambaai kii ikai se hi utpann hoti hai
 The unit of motion is, by definition, the distance obtained by dividing time by time and since the distance is expressed in length, the unit of motion is based on the original units
 a simple relation of the derived units to the original units has also been found
 praaia: yah paaya jaataa he ki vyutpann ikaiyaan yaa to bahut badi hoti hai athwa bahut choti
 At this stage, some of their multiples, or subgroups, are used from the convenience point of view
 in nai ikaayiyon ko vyaavhaarik ikai ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 In scientific world, two types of units are used for measurement purposes: ise 'foot pound second paddati' bhi kaha jaataa he
 In this method, length is expressed in feet, weight in pounds and time in seconds
 yah pranali khaas taur par un deshon main prachlit he, jo kabhi british samrajya ke ang rah chuke the
 It is used exclusively by British engineers, or trained engineers in Britain, and meteorologists
 But it is being replaced by the metered system
 ise metry paddati, athwa 'centimetre gram second paddati' bhi kehete hai
 This method is used in scientific work all over the world
 isamen lambaai ko centimetre main, bhaar kaa gram main tathaa samay ko ek second main maap jaataa he
 The metric system itself was modified and changed to the meter-kilogram-second system, which was again modified to become an international unit system
 metry pranali main lambaai kii maanak ikai ko meter kehete hai
 Initially, according to democratic French law, it was thought to be equal to 1 / 107th of the distance measured along the meridian crossing from the North Pole to the equator
 lekin aajkal jo maanak mana gaya he vah paris ke nikat sevr main rakhe platinum-iridium mishradhatu ke ek danda ke siron par bane do chihnon ke bich kii duuri he, jab danda shunya degree centegrade par hota he
 This is called a standard meter
 is sarini se vidit hota he ki 1 millimetre = 0
1 centimetre = 0
01 desimetre = 0
001 meter
 Hence units in the metered system can be changed only by transferring decimals, which is very convenient
 is prakaar yah spasht he metry pranali atyant suvidhajanak paddati he
 In astronomy, the unit used to measure distance is termed light year
 prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tay karata he usee ko khagol vigyaan main suvidha ke hetu duuri kii ikai mana gaya he
 Hence 1 light year = 9
45 x 1015 m
 british pranali, arthath foot pound second paddati main, lambaai kii maanak ikai british rajkeey gaj he
 This is the distance between the lines formed on the gold bars at the bronze poles at 62 degrees Fahrenheit temperature in London's treasury office
 lambaai kii sab maapon kii tulana se yah baat spasht ho jaati he ki sab paddatiyon main metry pranali sabase adhik suvidhajanak tathaa vaigyanik he
 Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has made a law for the use of the metered system in the entire country
 dono paddatiyon main lambaai kii ikaayiyon main ye sambandh hai : Wires made of wood or metal, scale rails, or other objects, are used to measure length
 inke kinare yaa to centimetre tathaa millimetre main khude rahete hai, athwa inch tathaa uske dasven, aathven yaa solahaven anshon main
 Measuring chains are used to measure long distances, or long distances in curved lines, especially in ground surveys
 jab paimaanon ko lambaai kii sidh main suvidha se nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, tab parkaar, dand parkaar, yaa ek saadhaaran callyper upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The inner and outer diameters are also measured with ordinary calipers
 pipe aadi ke konon kii maap karne ke liye vrittiya chal varneer banaae gaye hai
 If needed to measure up to 1 / 10th of a millimeter, a moving vernier is used there
 bahut hi choti lambaaiyon ko, jaise kisi chaddar kii motaai yaa ek patale taar kaa vyas aadi, maapne ke liye scrugese upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The unit of area is square centimeters in meter system and square feet in British method
 aaytan kii ikai metry pranali main ek ghan kilogram shuddh pani ke aaytan ko metry paddati main aaytan kii ikai, arthath litre, kehete he
 Generally, a cubic decimeter is considered equivalent to a liter
 aaytan kii ikai british paddati main ghanfoot kehalaati he
 The standard measure of capacitance in this method is called the gallon
 62 degree pha0 taap par 10 pound asut pani 1 galen ke baraabar mana gaya he
 It has been found that 1 gallon = 4
54 liters
 dharita kii metra ikai ko litre mana gaya he
 With respect to 13 cubic inches, it has been found that the weight of one cubic inch of pure water without air at 4 ° c is 252
297 grains
 metry paddati main dravyaman kii ikai ko gram kehete hai or ek gram kaa bhaar 4 degree sein0 taap ke shuddh pani ke ek ghan centimetre ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 The unit of mass in the British system is called a pound
 yah ek platinum ke belan kaa bhaar he, jo landan ke rajkeey karyaalay main rakhaa he
 Units of mass have found a correlation between the two methods, which is as follows: hamen surya akaash ke aar-paar jaataa maaloom padataa he
 The highest position or highest elevation of the Sun in the sky is when it is at the post-yamaya
 yamyottar se surya ke do baar jane ke antaraal ko drusht surya din kehete hai
 For many reasons, the duration of sight-sun-day varies from day to day, but after one year it repeats the same change cycle
 varsh kii avadhi 365 1 / 4 dinon kii hoti he
 If we add the time period of all the days of the year and divide it by the whole days of the year, we get a time interval, which the scientists have termed "mean sun day"
 is samay ko choubees ghanton main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Each hour is divided into sixty minutes and each minute into sixty seconds
 samay kii ikai ko metry tathaa british donon paddatiyon main second mana gaya he, jo madhya surya din kaa 1 / 86,400 vaan hissaa he
 The period of time that occurs in the gradual movements of a stationary star across the vertex of a place is called the period between the gradual meridians of the star, or the sidereal day
 iskaa maan sthir paaya gaya he
 Nakshatra day is about four minutes less than the mean sun day
 yah maaloom karne ke liye ki do samyantaral baraabar hai yaa nahin, athwa maanak samay ko baraabar samay ke upantaral main vibhajit karne ke liye, dolak kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Two time intervals are said to be equal only when each has the same oscillation number of oscillators
 yadi dolak ke dolanon kii sankhya ek "madhya saura din" main 60x60x24 hoti he, to prayek daalan kaa samyantaral ek second kaha jaataa he
 The mean solar age is used in our watches

 In this way once the direction of the antenna is merged with the position of the satellite in orbit, it is always in contact with it, because the antenna rotating with the earth always gets the satellite at the same place where it was a day ago

 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities

 meghrahit akaash main raatri ke samay prakaash ke binduon kii tarah bikhare hue, timatimaate prakashwale bahut se taare dikhalaai dete hai
 Some groups of glowing stars divide the sky into different parts
 in taron ke samooh ko taramandal kehete hai
 The entire sky has been divided into 89 constellations and the names of those constellations have been named
 raashichakr ke taramandal bahut prasiddh hai, inaki sangya mesh, vrish aadi he
 The strings of a single constellation are selected in descending order of their visual radiance
 phir taramandal ke naam ke aage greek bhashaa ke akshar rakhkar taron kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, jaise mesh raashi ke sabase chamkile taare kaa namakaran alfatareez kiya gaya he
 In some constellations the number of strings is so high that the number of letters of the Greek alphabet falls short for them
 aise taron ke namakaran ke liye taramandal ke purv latin akshar tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par sankhyaayein likh dete hai
 Some stars are famous for being over-illuminated and their names can be known without reference to the constellations, such as Lubbhak, Magha, Chitra etc
 is prakaar ke namakaran se taron ko pahchaanane main sahaayta milti he
 Some stars appear more bright and some less bright when viewed with empty eyes
 inaki kanti ke unadhiky ke anusaar ham taron ko kai kantimanon main vargit kar lete hai
 The stars are located far away from us
 duuri ke badhane se kam chamkile taare ham dikhaai nahin dete
 Without the aid of a machine, our eyes can see the stars up to the sixth milestone
 kantimanon kaa vargeekaran is prakaar he kijo taare sabase adhik chamkile dikhalaai padate hai, unka kantimaan nunatam sankhya mana jaataa he, usase kam chamkile taron kaa usase adhik ityadi
 It is 2
512 times brighter or 2
512 times the radiance of the preceding radiant star
 is prakaar pratham kantimaan kaa tara dwitiya kantimaan ke taare se 2
512 guna chamkila tathaa dwitiya kantimaan kaa tara tritiy kantimaan ke taare se 2
512 guna chamkila hota he
 If we assume the brightness of the sixth fifth star, then the brightness of the stars from the first to the sixth will be in the ratio 100: 39
82: 15
85: 6: 31: 2:51: 1
 is drishy kantimaan ke maapan main surya kii kantimaan - 26

 From the 200-inch diameter reflecting telescope of Mount Palomar Observatory, we can see up to 23 radiant stars
 kantimaan maapan kaa arth he taare ke prakaash kii tivrata kaa maapan
 Earlier this work was done by the eyes with the help of special types of photometers
 is prakaar gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko drishy kantimaan kehete hai
 Eyes are sensitive to yellow light, so visible yellow and green are the measure of light
 baad main kantimaapan photography kii platon kii sahaayta se kiya jane laga
 Kantikan known in this way is called Photographic Thread
 photography kantimaan nile rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 The stars radiate light of many colors
 at: taron ke kantimaan gyaat karne ke liye vibhinn rangon kii sugrahi platon ke dwaara tathaa varnashodhakon ke upyog se unke prakaash kii tivrata aanki jaati he
 The difference between photographic and visual parameters on yellow sensitive plates with yellow color filters is called character indicator
 isse taron kaa taap gyaat hota he
 The intensity of light is measured by accepting and multiplying the light on current photographic cells
 kantimaan ko maapte samay hamen vayumandal ke prabhaav tathaa taron kii antarvarti dhul tathaa gaison ke prabhaav ko bhi drushti main rakhana padataa he
 Accurate knowledge of radiance helps us to know the distances of stars and many physical substances
 bahut se taron kaa nijee prakaash bahut adhik he, kintu atyaadhik duuri par sthir hone ke kaaran unka drishy kantimaan adhik dikhalaai padataa he
 The true scale can be known only if they are located at equal distance from the subsurface
 samast taron ko 10 parsek kii duuri par kalpit karke gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko nirpeksh kantimaan kehete hai
 If we know the visible radius of the star and its distance, then we can know the absolute radius from the following formula: nirpekshkantimaan drishyakantimaan 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri, parsekon main he
 Opposite: If we know the absolute record, then we can also know the distances of stars
 surya kaa nirpeksh kantimaan 4
7 he
 The radius of a star relative to the sun is called relative radiance
 isamen surya kii kanti 1 maan lee jaati he
 With this type of study, we study the energy obtained by stars, which helps in studying their physical conditions
 na8na In the perfectly clear sky, we do not see more than 3,200 stars of vision aids
 chunki ham akaash ke keval aadhe hisse ko hi dekh pate hai at: chakshudrishy taron kii sankhya 6,500 ke lagbhag he
 In these 1,5 kantimaan se adhik chamkile 20 taare 50 stars up to 2 radiant 3 kantimaan tak chamkile 150 taare hai 4 stars up to 500 radiant tara 5 kantimaan tak chamkile 1500 taare hai The rest of the image is of the sixth record
 yadi ham apni drushti ko 10 guni antarmukhi kar len to drishy taron kii sankhya 1000 guna bad jaaegi, arthath yadi taron ko samroop se failaa hua maan liya jaae to unki sankhya unki duuri kii chah guni bad jaaegi
 This relationship is limited to more bright stars
 kam gallexi main vishaltam doordarshee dwaara gyaat taron kii sankhya lagbhag 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000 he
 To find the true speed and movement of a star, we divide its speed into two parts
 drushtisutra par lamb disha kii gati ke koniya maan ko taare kii nijee gati kehete hai
 Personal speeds of stars are less
 unhen gyaat karne ke liye hamen bahut doorvarti kaalon main liye gaye taron ke photographon kii tulana kerani padati he
 The stars that are closest to us move back and forth relative to distant stars
 is koniya maan ko kaal ke antaraal se bhaag dene par nijee gati gyaat ho jaati hai
 The asterisks of the direction of this angular sight is called the radial velocity
 traigy veg jaanane ke liye ham varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se taare kaa varnakram le lete hai
 If the spectral lines move towards the blue end, then we know with the help of the Doppler principle that the star is coming towards us and, if the spectral lines are towards the red end, it is moving away from us
 rekhaon kaa sthanantaran unke tragyveg kaa anukramanupati hota he
 Benard has known the personal speed of the star of a dashing radius of the Ophiucus planetarium at 10
3 per year, which is the largest
 nijee gati kaa gyaan tarapunjon ke adhyayan main sahaayak hota he tathaa isse ham yah bhi jaan jate hai ki adhik neeli gati ke taare apekshaakrit hamaare nikat hai
 To understand the radius of the velocity relative to the Sun, we also have to take into account the speed of the Earth
 nijee gati tathaa traigy veg ke gyaan se bal-samaantar-chaturbhuj ke siddhant dwaara vaastavik gati tathaa uski disha gyaat ho jaati he
 Trigonometric methods are used to find distances of stars
 hamase ati sameep tara bhi itani duuri par he ki yadi ham prithvi ke vyas ko aadhaar maanakar uski dishaao ko dekhen to ve samaantar prathit hotin hai, arthath taare kaa lamban shunya hi aata he
 Therefore, to find the parallax of stars, we need a larger base
 at: prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas ko ham aadhaar banaate hai
 If we observe a star's direction six months after its perforation, we get the basis of the diameter of the earth's orbit
 is prakaar ke vedh se samipsth taare duurastha taron ke saapeksh thodaa dik parivartan dikhalaate hai
 While extracting this, we also have to consider the effect of the personal motion of the star
 to bhi yah itnaa kam he ki nikatatam taare kaa lamban 76 he
 If a star has a parallax of 1, it is 2,06,265 times the radius of the Earth's orbit from Earth
 is duuri ko ek parsek kehete he
 Another unit used to measure distance is the light year
 prakaash kaa veg 1,86,000 mile prati second he
 The distance that light travels in a year with this velocity is called a light year, this distance is about 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 miles
 ek parsek lagbhag 3
26 prakaash varsh ke tulya hota he
 By trigonometric method we can only find the distances of the most proximal wires
 at: doorvarti taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye hamen anya vidhiyon kaa aashray lenaa padataa he
 If we can somehow know the absolute record of stars, then we can find their distances with the help of the formula given in the title Absolute Record
 saubhaahgya se hamen sefiid tathaa lira varg ke taare uplabdh hai, jinke nirpeksh kantimaan ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 The following are other methods of finding the perpendiculars of stars: in vargikarnon kaa nijee mahatv he or inase hamen taron ke vishleshan main vishesh sahaayta milti he
 The following is a brief introduction to these classifications: surya hamaara nikatatam tara he, jiskaa ham bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kar sakate hai
 Most stars are available to us by studying the elements of stars, which were born around the same time as our Sun
 ye taare taap, aakaar tathaa kanti ke avaroh anukram main hai
 This class is called the main sequence
 isamen atyaadhik taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar kaa lagbhag dashamansh hoga
 The Sun is a medium-sized star of this sequence, whose mass and temperature are below average
 mukhya anukram ke vakr main upar kii ore taare atyant viral hai
 Most of the stars in this sequence are smaller than the Sun and warmer
 inamen uplabdh tatwon kii maatra surya jaisi he
 From the study of the Sun, we have two more main classes of stars in addition to this class: there are three main differences of the Danvar stars
 daanavaakar, tathaa vamanakaar taare
 The three main differences of donor stars - demonetisation, extreme donor and donor
 atidanavaakar taare aakaar main bahut vishaal hote hai
 For example, the diameter of Jyestha is about 300 times the diameter of the Sun
 daanavaakar taron main khagaashv ke dwitiya beta pigasi kaa vyas surya ke vyas se 170 guna tathaa brahmahruday kaa, surya ke vyas se, 12 guna he
 The sublingual stars lie between the main sequence and the star of the demon class
 vamanakaar taron ke bhi vaaman, upwaman, lalarang vaaman tathaa shwet-vaaman bhed hai
 White left-wing stars have special significance in these sections
 inaki visheshta yah he ki inaki dravyamatra madhya shrenee kii tathaa kanti kam hoti he, kintu inkaa aakaar bahut chota tathaa inkaa ghanatv atyant adhik hota he
 Of the many stars we see, there are a large number of stars, which are members of our Galaxy
 hamaari gallexi apane main ek vishwa he
 Its shape is spiral
 bahut se anya taravishwa bhi hai, jinka aakaar sarpil he
 To study their composition and shape, we get help from the study of some special types of stars of our Akashganga
 in taron ke gukhyat: do varg hai
 Some stars are always available in the spiral arms of the Galaxy and others are found near the nucleus of the Galaxy
 inamen pratham varg ke taare hamaare surya ke nikat padosi hai tathaa duusare varg ke taare surya se dur hai
 Walter Wade named the stars of the first class as the first star series, or population first, and the stars of the second class named the second star series, or population second
 in donon prakaar ke taravargo ke varnakram-kanti-vakron main bhinnata hoti he
 The very bright stars of the first star are blue and have an absolute radius of 7 or 8, while the bright stars of the second star are red and have an absolute radius of 3 or more
 pratham tarashrenee ke taron main taron kii antarvarti gas tathaa dhul atyadhik maatra main he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke taron main yah atyant kam maatra main he
 The study of these stars gives us not only to determine the spiral arms and nuclei of galaxies, but they also help us to study the origin and evolution of stars
 taron kii dravyamatra ke anu, jo mulavastha main udasin rahete hai, taap main uttarotar vruddhi hone ke kaaran ynikrut hokar apane rin vidyutkanon ko adhikadhik maatra main khone lagate hai
 Due to this effect, there are variations in the bright and black lines formed in the spectrum of such stars
 duusare shabdon main rekhaayen taron ke prakaash vikeern karanevaale anuon ke taap kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii dyotak hai
 Thus, their main 10 distinctions have been made by the study of the spectrum of stars, which are expressed by the capital letters O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and s of the Roman script
 chunki varnakram vargeekaran kaa taap se sambandh he, at: ek hi varg ke taara ke taap main uttarottar hraas bataane ki liye o varnakram ke taron ke liye o ke baad angraji varnmaala ke chote e se i tak ke varna rakh die jate hai tathaa o, oba aadi
 To express a similar intent, the digits from b to m are numbered from 0 to 9, followed by their indicator letters
 ye ynikrut helium vaale taare hai
 The lines of ionized helium and double triple ionized oxygen and nitrogen are found in their spectrum
 is ynikrut avasthaa ke anusaar iskaa prishthiya taap 30, xxrep 4 0 se lekar 40, xxrep 4 0 sein0 tak athwa isse bhi adhik hona chahie
 o The number of known stars of the spectrum is not more than hundred, in which most cannot be seen with naked eyes
 is varg ke teen taare, gamma belorum oe,, jita papsis oe tathaa jitaorin, oi5 chakshu drukshya hai
 These are neutral helium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 25,000° se 12,000° sein0 tak rahata he
 Although this heat is unable to ionize helium, ionized oxygen lines are available in its spectrum
 bi5 taare se lekar nimnatar taap ke taron main helium tathaa ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen kam hone lagati hai or varnakram ke begni bhaag kii or hidrogen rekhaayen tathaa hidrogen kii chaudee kaali avasorana rekhaayen ubhar aati he
 There are many stars in our stars
 ye hydrogen pramukh taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 12,000 ° c to 8,000 ° C
 inaki sankhya atyaadhik he
 Some astrologers called them calcium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 8,000° se lekar 6,000° se0 tak hota he
 These are the stars of the Sun's range
 inke varnakram main ynikrut calcium kii rekhaayen khub ubhari rahati hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 6,000 ° to 4,000 ° C
 12,000° ji varnakrameey taare pahachaane ja chuke hai
 Their surface heat ranges from 5,000 ° to 3,5000 ° C
 pehle ye suryakalank taron ke naam se prasiddh the
 Tetonium oride stars

 Almost all of them are movable stars, in which there is no eye sight alone
 inkaa prishthiya taap 3,000° se lekar 5,000° ain0 tak he
 These are all donors and mostly movable stars
 ye bahut kam sankhya main hai
 None of these taras are simply visuals from Chakshu
 kuch taare aise hai, jinaki kanti badhati ghatati rahati he
 These are called stars

 As their number increases, two or three letters may also have to be placed in place of one letter, such as RR Lira etc
 lagbhag 20,000 chal taare gyaat hai tathaa unka niyamit rup se vegh kiya jaataa he
 There are two huge classes of wires: first running outward and second running automatically
 bahyahetuk chal taare grahauakari yugma taare hote hai
 Among them Alugula Tara is famous
 iskaa saamaanya kantimaan 2
2 hai, kintu yah 3
4 tak ho jaataa he
 Automatic moving stars can be placed in three categories: vibratory moving, explosive moving and other moving stars
 inamen kuch taron kaa aavartan kaal ek din se bhi kam hota he
 Such stars belong to the RR Lira class
 kuch kaa aavartan kaal 1 se lekar 50 din tak kaa he
 Such stars are stars of the Cepheid class
 kuch taron kaa aavartankaal 100 se lekar 1000 din tak kaa he
 These are called long-term stars
 is varg ke taare laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Some stars are semi-regular, their cycle ranges from 40 to 150 days
 ye taare bhi laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Among these, RR Lyra and Cepheid stars are very important
 aar lira taron kaa yah naam isliye padaa ki ye sab gunon main lira taramandal main varnit us chal taare ke samaan hai, jiskaa naam aar aar lira rakhaa gaya
 It should not be understood from the name that such stars occur only in Lyra constellations, but stars in this category are everywhere in our galaxy and other constellations etc
 in taron kii mahatta kii kaaran he inkaa durisuchak hona
 Even when the period of rotation of the stars of RR Lira class does not differ in their absolute value
 iskaa arth yah he ki kisi ek taraguchh tarapranali main aar aar lira taare hon, to ve samaan nirpeksh kantimaan ke honge or yah samaan nirpeksh kantimaan lagbhag shunya ke tulya he
 In such a state, their distance from knowledge of their visual radiance can be known by the following formula
 nirpeksh kantimaan = drishy kantimaan + 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri He got this name because his nature is similar to Delta Cepheus, or Charuth Kapish
 chaturth kapish sefiod varg kaa sarvaadhik chamkila tara he, jise chakshu se dekha ja saktaa he
 The periodicity of cephaid wires ranges from a few days to more than 45 days
 hamaari gallexi ke sefiid taron main 7 din kaa aavartankaal praaia: hota he
 The biggest feature of cepheid stars is to be consistent with the periodic-radius-associative rule
 iskaa arth he ki sefiid taron ke aavartan kaal main jaise jaise vruddhi hoti he vaise vaise unke nirpeksh kantimaan main vruddhi hoti jaati he
 This relationship is very important
 isaki sahaayta se sefiid taron kaa nirpeksh kantimaan jaanakar purv sutara dwaara inaki duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he
 With the help of cepheid stars, the distances of galaxies and starfish are determined
 taapajanit rang ke parivartan kaa kaaran saamanyat: spandan siddhant kalpit kiya gaya he, jiskaa aashay he ki sefiid taron ke tal main aavartan se vruddhi tathaa hraas hota he, jisase tara krmanusaar failata tathaa sikudta rahata he
 In fact, the flutter theory does not provide an accurate answer to all situations
 at: aajkal jyotishi samajhane lage hai ki sefiid taron kii vibhinn sthitiyaan inke taap ke parivartan ke kaaran hai, jiskaa sway ek punrariti chakra he
 More than 1,000 cephoid stars are known
 aise taron main niyamit athwa aniyamit rup se visphot hota he
 These stars are usually extremely foggy, but their radiance increases very exceptionally after an explosion
 yah sthiti kuch din rahane ke baad taare apni kii si saamaanya kanti main aa jate hai
 These types of stars are called Navtara
 1918 i0 ke ekvilla tarapunj ke navtare kii chamak chaar hi din ke bheetar pehle se chalis hajaar guna bad gai thi
 Other famous navataras are: Navtara of the Percuss planetarium, 1925 Victorian Navtara and Navtara of the Hercules planetarium of 1934
 jo navtare visphot ke baad atyant asaadhaaran rup se chamkile ho jate he, unhe atinavtara kehete hai
 In 1885, the supernatural of the Andromeda nebula radiated so much light in six days that the sun would be able to radiate as much light in 10 million years
 anya prakaar ke chal taare praaia: aniyamit aavartankaal ke hai
 On a clean night, some blurred light spots appear in the sky
 yadi ham inhen shaktishaalee yantron se dekhen to inamen teen prakaar kii vastuen milti hai: taare ke guchchhe, niharikas tathaa gallexiyaan
 The nebulae are made up of luminous gases and glaciers are independent galaxies like our Galaxy
 taron ke guchchhe do prakaar ke hai, ek to ve jo akashgangeey samtal main, yaa akashgangeey sarpil bhujaaon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Such flakes are called celestial flakes
 inamen taron kii sankhya apekshkrit kam rahati hai
 In this type of class, the diamond cluster is very bright and large
 golakaar taraguchh sarpil bhujaaon se dur tathaa nabhik ke paas hote hai
 Spherical galaxies have relatively more stars
 ye praaia: ghundle se dikhaai dete hai
 They are seen only through visionaries
 omenga centari tathaa 47 tukane panchal kantimaan ke, chakshudrishy, golakaar taraguchh kaa population dwitiya se sambandh he
 Of course, they have knowledge of the stages of development of stars
 in taron main vidyaman aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taron kii sahaayta se gucchh kii duuri gyaat kii jaati he
 Their study helps a lot in studying the appearance of the Galaxy
 adhikash taare dohare, athwa bahusankhyak, hote hai, inamen kuch taron kii jodiyon main paraspar kuch bhi sambandh nahin hota, kintu ve ati sameep isliye dikhaai dete hai ki ve hamaari drushtirekha kii ore sthit hai
 Such stars are called double stars
 aise taare kam hai
 Most stars are actually with one or more stars
 do taare, jo paraspar aakarshan se ek nishichat prakaar ke dirdhavritakar maarg main bhraman karte hai, tara-yugma kehalaate hai
 Having determined that a star is actually a pair, we can know many things about its relationship, because its, or its companion star's, motion follows a broader gravitational law
 yugma taron kii gati tathaa dravyamatra ko nishchit rup se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are mainly three types of pairing: visual, receptive and spectral
 drishy yugmataron kii kaksha kaa gyaan karne ke liye unki duuri tathaa sthiti kone kaa vegh karnaa padataa he
 Most visual pairings have a long rotation period, which requires hundreds of years of weights to detect
 isiilie yadhyapi 25,000 se bhi adhik drishy yugmatare gyaat ho chuke hai, tathaapi 200 se adhik kii kaksha kaa gyaan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 The orbit of the eclipse of the receptive pair often tends to tilt a little in the direction of our line of sight, so that one star covers the other completely or partially, and the light of one star is not visible to us
 isse yugmatare kii pahchaan ho jaati hai, kyonki saamaanya sthiti main is taare kaa jitna prakaash rahata he grahan ke samay pehle kii apeksha kam ho jaataa he
 These eclipses occur from the appointed time
 is tarah ke taron main beta parasyus, arthath algul, ati prasiddh he
 In the normal state, its record is 2
2, leaving 3
4 at the time of eclipse
 grahan ke pashchaat iskaa kantimaan pun: 2
2 ho jaataa he
 The level of the orbit of some of the couriers does not go near the Earth, so we cannot see the position of its eclipse
 kintu uske varnakram kii rekhaon ke parivartan se hamen pataa chal jaataa he ki yah tara kabhi hamaari ore aata tathaa kabhi hamase dur jaataa he, jisase spasht he ki yah kisi adrishy taare ke chaaron ore dhooma rahaa he
 Such stars have a shorter rotation period for spectral pairs
 lagbhag 309 varnakrameey taron kii kakshaayen gyaat ho chuki hai
 The sizes of stars are often known by three methods: nirpeksh kantimaan tathaa taap se, From the eclipse of the receptive couriers and vyatikaranmaapi se
 The first method is based on Planck's following formula: drishy nirpeksh kantimaan Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 Where r = radius of the star
 grahauakari taare ke grahan ke kaal ke vegh se uski kaksha ke saapeksh uski trigya gyaat ho jaati he
 The angular diameter of the star is known by the telemetrometer and by knowing its distance, its simple linear diameter is also known
 taron ke vyas ke aadhaar par hi unke daanavaakar tathaa vamanakaar aadi naam pade hai
 Direct methods for determining the mass of stars are obtained by studying the speed of association of pair wires
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kii sahaayta se in taron kii dravyamatra gyaat kii jaati he
 The drafts of any Vamana star have not been available less than the tithe of the Sun's Drayaamatra, and stars of more than 10 times Drayaamatra from the Sun are also rare
 kisi taare kaa ghanatv = dravyamatra / aaytan
 Thus, it is seen that the density of the Danvar wires is very low and the left side wires are very low
 jyeshta jaise vishaal taare kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa 480 guna he, to bhi isaki dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke 20 gune se adhik nahin
 As a result, its density is less than 
 xxrep 7 0 2 of the Sun's density
 yah saadhaaran hawa ke ghanatv se bhi bahut kam he
 The density of the Svetavaman star Cerium B, whose radius is 
034 of the radius of the Sun and 86 of the mass of the Sun, is so high that one cubic inch of its mass would weigh one ton

 But the best method to determine this is spectral analysis of their light
 isi ke aadhaar par taron kaa varnakrameey vargeekaran he, jo vastut: unke taap kaa dyotak he
 Stars derive their energy from nuclear reactions
 taron ke nabhik ke taap ke kaaran taron ke hydrogen ke parmaanu nabhikriya se helium ke parmaanuon main parivartit hote rahete hai
 As a result, excessive heat is produced in the stars, which they radiate as light
 bahut adhik urja utpann karne ke liye inhen atyalp vidyutkan khone padate hai
 Therefore, there is no significant decrease in their volume and their life also becomes millions of years
 taron ke vayumandal kaa adhyayan bhi varnakram kii rekhaon se kiya jaataa he
 We have come to know from the study of the atmosphere of the Sun that it contains excessive amounts of hydrogen

 The basic elements of stars are known by the study of their spectral lines
 prayogshla main vibhinn mul tatwon ke varnakram le liye jate hai tathaa taron ke varnakramon kaa unase milan karke taron main upalabadh mul tatwon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 This type of study has shown that the average stars have about 70 Hydrogen, 28 Helium, 1
5 Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Niran and 0
5 iron group and other heavy elements
 baari tatv population pratham ke taron main lagbhag 3 hote hai tathaa population dwitiya waalon main 1 se bhi kam
 The stars originate from the interstellar gas and dust particles of the stars
 gas ke badalon ke vidyutkan saamanyatya udasin avasthaa main rahete hai, kintu jab koi atyadhik ushn tara inke sameep se jaataa he to ye ynikrut hokar gatisheel ho jate hai tathaa inamen ek nabhik ban jaataa he, jo aasapaas ke gas tathaa dhul ke dravyakanon ko aakrisht karke vishalaroop dhaaran karne lagata he
 When the temperature of the nucleus increases due to speed and shrinkage, the nuclear reaction starts in them, which causes them to radiate light energy and show us the appearance of new stars
 vibhinn prakaar ke taron kii urja vikeernata ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki population dwitiya ke taare bahut pracheen hai tathaa papulation pratham ke taare apekshaakrit baad main nirmit hai
 The life of stars refers to their luminous life
 taron ke prakaash kaa aadhaar he, unka hydrogen kaa bhandar, jisaki nabhikeey abhikriya se ve ooshmaa urja praapt karte hai
 The stars which are very bright, naturally consume more of their hydrogen reserves and convert them to helium more quickly
 yadhyapi hydrogen kaa bhandar samaapt hone par bhi taare sankochan dwaara apni ooshmaa urja ko bahut varshon tak praapt kar sakate hai, tathaapi unke jivan kaa mukhya aadhaar unke hydrogen ke upbheg par hi nirbhar rahata he
 The stars that appear bright enough have a lifetime of about 109 years and the main sequence of blurred stars has a life of about 1013 years
 surya kaa jeevankaal lagbhag 1010 varsh hai
 Our desire to unravel the mystery of the starry world around us is very old
 taron ke adhyayan se hamane vishwa ko gallexi jaisi anek tarapranaliyon purna paaya he
 We have learned so much by studying the spectrum of stars by moving the lines towards red color that our world is expanding
 tathaapi apane simit sadhano ke kaaran ham vishwa ke vaastavik rup ko nahin jaan sake hai
 To what extent does our world expand, to what extent can the spreading world, how is the curvature of the world, and what is the radius of curvature? sabase bada mount palomar veghashaala kaa, 200 inch vyas kaa hell doordarshee ek arab parsek, athwa lagbhag 20, xxwrep 2 00, 00 mile ke lagbhag, duriyon ke drishy tak hi pahunch paaya he

 According to predictive beliefs, a meteor is somewhere auspicious and elsewhere auspicious
 kintu adhiktar bhavishya main honevaali kisi durghatana ke daivi sanket ke rup se yah ashubhasuchak hi samajha jaataa he
 According to Pliny, if the magistrate of the Sparta, the city of Sparta, ancient Greece, in 1200 BC, after the reign of eight years, meteorites were seen in a lunarless clean night, he would take the throne as a divine sign of the ruler's sin

 On the Bhagwati basis, Lord Krishna is always eternal, memorable and noteworthy - brahm ke saath jeev-jagat kaa sambandh nirupan karte hue unka mat tha ki jeev brahm kaa sadansh he, jagat bhi brahm kaa sadansh he

 mulya-nirdhaaran ke ghatak hai nirmaan laagat, bazaar, pratiyogita, bazaar sthiti or utpaada kii gunvattta
 mulya-nirdhaaran vyashti-arthshaastra mulya aabantan siddhant main bhi ek mahatvapurn prabhavit karne vaala kaarak he
 Pricing is a fundamental aspect of financial modeling and is one of the four P's of the marketing mix
 anya teen pahalu hai utpaada, protsaahan or jagah
 chaar p main qeemat hi ekmaatr aay paidaa karne vaala tatv he, jabaki shesh laagat centre hai
 Pricing is a manual or automated process of applying prices to purchase and sale orders, based on the following factors: a fixed amount, quantity of goods, incentives or sales campaigns, specific seller bids, prices prevailing upon entry, shipment or invoice
 Date, multiple orders or combinations of lines and many others
 Automated systems require more set-up and maintenance, but can prevent pricing errors
 upabhokta kii zaruuraton ko maang main keval tabhi parivartit kiya ja saktaa he, jab utpaada ko kharidne kii upabhokta kii ichha or kshamta maujuud he
 Thus pricing is very important for marketing
 mulya nirdhaaran main sawaal poochna shaamil he, jaise ki: The well-chosen price should have three functions: vikreta ke drushtikon se, ek prabhavi qeemat vah qeemat he jo us adhiktam ke bahut nikat he jitna graahak bhugtan karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 In economic terms, it is the price that transfers most of the consumer's surplus to the producer
 ek acha mulya-nirdhaaran vah hoga jo ek mulya tal or mulya seemaa ke bich santulan sthapit karata he
 There are innumerable terms and strategies specific to pricing: prabhavi mulya vah mulya he jo company ko chhot, prachaar or anya protsaahan raashi ke liye lekhankan ke baad hasil hota he
 Pricing is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offerings of the seller
 yah parampara puraane five and dim dukaanon par shuru kii gai thi jahaan har chiz kaa daam 5 yaa 10 saint hota tha
 The underlying logic in this is that these amounts are viewed by potential customers as appropriate price points for the entire range of products
 iskaa faaydaa he prashasan main aasaani, lekin nuksaan he anamyata, vishesh rup se mudrasphiti ke samay yaa asthir keematen
 a loss leader is a product whose price is set below the operating margin
 isse us vishisht mad par is aashaa main udhyam ke liye nuksaan parinat hota he ki vah graahakon ko dukaan kii ore aakarshith karegaa or unamem se kuch graahak anya, ucch margin vaali maden kharidenge
 Enforcement pricing refers to an example where pricing is a key element of the marketing mix
 mulya / gunvattta sambandh adhikansh upabhoktaaon kii us dharna ko sanderbhit karata he ki apekshaakrit oonche daam acchhee gunvattta kaa sanket hai
 Confidence in this regard is more important for complex products that are difficult to test, and experiential products cannot be tested unless they are used
 The more uncertainty surrounding the product, the more consumers depend on the price / quality hypothesis and are prepared to pay a higher premium
 iskaa clasik udhaaharan he ek snake kek tvinkis jisaki gunvattta ko qeemat ghataane ke baad kam aanka gaya
 Excessive dependence on price / quality by consumers may increase the prices of all products and services, including low quality products, due to which the price / quality relationship is no more applicable
 premium mulya-nirdhaaran ek aisi ranneeti he jo pratishtha ke prati sajag upabhoktaaon ko aakarshith karne main madad ke liye, lagaataar sambhavya mulya seemaa par, yaa ucch laagat or parishkrut qeemat par mulya-nirdhaaran karti he
 Examples of companies participating in premium pricing in the market include Rolex and Bentley
 People will buy a premium priced product because: goldilox mulya-nirdhaaran aam taur par premium keemat par utpaada ke "gold-plated" sanskaran uplabdh karaane kii pratha ko paribhaashit karne ke liye prayukt shabd he taaki doosraa kam daam vaala vikalp yathochit qeemat kaa prathit ho; udhaaharan ke liye, graahakon ko paison ke liye acchhee qeemat ke rup main bijnes-class airline siten dekhne ke liye or bhi ucch daam vaale pratham-shrenee ke vikalp kii peshkash sahit protsaahit karnaa
isi prakaar, victorian england main tisare darje ke railway sawari dibbon ko bina khidki ke bananaa, joki tisare darje ke graahakon ko dandit karne ke liye nahin apitu dwitiya shrenee kii siten vahan kar sakane waalon ko saste vikalp kaa chunaav karne ke badale protsaahit karnaa
 yah mulya pakshpaat ke sambhavit parinaam ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Its name is derived from the story of Goldilocks in which Goldilocks chose the hot Rabri and not the cold, but instead chose what was "just right"
 And technically, this type of pricing takes advantage of the general cognitive bias that tends toward extremes
 yah abhyaas academik taur par "framing" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 By providing three options, you can smartly influence the consumer to choose the medium option, and thus the middle option will earn more profit for the seller, as it is often the chosen choice
 maang aadhaarit mulya-nirdhaaran aisi koi bhi mulya-nirdhaaran paddati he jo kendriya tatv ke rup main - upabhokta ke maang - aadhaarit maane gaye mulya kaa upyog karata he
 These include: high price, price bias and income management, price points, psychological pricing, bundled pricing, entry pricing, pricing, price-based pricing, land and premium pricing
 Pricing factors are cost, market, competition, market position, product quality
 bahuaiami mulya-nirdhaaran ekaadhik sankhyaon ke upyog dwaara utpaada yaa seva kaa mulya-nirdhaaran he
 In this practice, the price does not include a single monetary amount, but rather different dimensions
 Research has shown that this practice can significantly affect consumers' ability to understand and process price information
 apni pustak, da stratji and tactics of priceing main thomas nagle or read holden ne 9 siddhant yaa ghatakon kaa ullekh kiya he jo kharidaar kii mulya sambandhi samvedansheeltaa ko prabhavit karte hai: Three levels can be considered towards pricing
 Pricing as a highly effective leverage
 udyog, bazaar or len-dein str
 Pricing at the industry level focuses on the overall benefits of the industry including changes in prices by the supplier and changes in customer demand
 bazaar str par mulya-nirdhaaran, tulanaatmak pratispardhi utpaadon ke saath utpaada ke mulya antar kii tulana main qeemat kii pratispardhaatmak sthiti par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Moving from pricing, reference, or list price at the behavioral level, which focuses on implementation management of rebates, both on the invoice or receipt, or beyond
 vyashti vipanan bazaar ke andar vyashti khandon kii aavashyaktaaon or zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye anukool utpaada, brands prachaar kii pratha he
 It is a type of market optimization that deals with pricing of customer / product combinations at the store or individual level
 kai companiyaan aam mulya-nirdhaaran galatiyaan karti hai
