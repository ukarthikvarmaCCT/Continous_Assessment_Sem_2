 jin kaarnon se sharir ke vibhinn angon kii samyavastha, yaa swastheavastha, nasht hokar unamem vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai, unako hetukikaarak or unke shaastra ko hetuvigyaan kehete hai
 These reasons are many
 inhen nimnlikhit bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : The pathogen causing these pathologies is called pathogenesis
 rogakaarak hetuon se sharir ke vibhinn angon main jo aswasth avasthaaen yaa sthityantar utpann hote hai, unako vikrutiyaan kehete hai tathaa in vikrutiyon se yukt dhaatu ang yaa aashay ke vivaran ko vikrut sharir tathaa in vikrutiyon ke shaastra ko vikruti vigyaan yaa pathalogy kehete hai
 The main purpose of pathology is to show the working sense of the various pathologies that occur in different organs from different pathogens
 un vikrutiyon ke sthool or sookshm swaroopon kaa vivaran dena or unke aadhaar par vividh vyaadhiyon se utpann honevaale lakshanon kaa spashtikaran dena hi vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 This objective cannot be proved without combining the complete history of dead persons with various diseases, post-mortem examination, of the deformities found within the various organs of their body
 16 veen - 17 veen shatabdi main paashchaatya deshon main vikruti vigyaan ke liye shavpareekshan kaa prarambh kiya gaya
 Morgagni researched hundreds of postmortemings conducted before him in 1761, seven hundred of them were published in three parts of a large collection of chronicles
 rogiyon ke vibhinn angon main paae gaye chihnon or lakshanon kaa sambandh unke shavon ke bheetar pai gai rachanatmk vikrutiyon ke saath kahan tak baithta he isaki charchaa is grath main kii gai he
 It was only after this that pathology gained independent existence
 rudolf phikhon ne 19veen shatabdi main sharirgat vikrutiyon ke pareekshan main sookshmdarshi yantra kaa upyog aarambh kiya or koshikeey vikrutivigyaan par apana granth 1846 i
 main prakashit kiya
 This treatise revolutionized the imagination of the relation between the nature of diseases and which tools should be used for their practice and pathology, which was earlier a small subject under Roganidan, Made a great foundation for diagnosis
 sharir ke angon main honevaali vikrutiyaan avyakt hote hue bhi pratikriya, sujan, jirnoddhar, vruddhi main baadha, apjanan, arbud ityadi kuch ini-gini saamaanya prakaar kii hoti he
 When the nature of these deformations is easily perceptible within the body, then it is called macro deformity and when there is a deformity of the subtle form, when the microscope instrument is needed to see these deformations then it is called micro deformation
 vikrutiyon main sharir ke vibhinn angon kii vaishamyavastha par tathaa unke rachanaatmak or swarupatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he or rogon main unke kaaryaatmak parivartanon par jor diya jaataa he
 In the summary, malformations are related to different organs and the disease is mostly related to symptoms
 sharir main vikrutiyon ke swaroop main rog bahut pehle se rahata he
 Only by being very subtle does the sensory intelligence become less and more intelligent
 jab sharirgat sampurna vikrutiyon kaa tathaa unke hetuon kaa varnan uparyukt sarsaadhaaran prakaaron ke anusaar kiya jaataa he, to usko saamaanya vikrutivigyaan kehete hai or jab sharir ke prayek ang, aashay yaa santhaan kaa varnan usamen honevaali uparyukt prakaar kii vikrutiyon ke saath swatantra rup se kiya jaataa he, tab usko vishesh vikrutivigyaan kehete hai
 The patient's pathology is studied by clinical pathology from various examinations inside the laboratory
 saamaanya vikrutivigyaan ko nimnlikhit adhyyon main baanta gaya he

 The following are the types of tissue: yah bhi ootkavishesh par honevaali kriya he
 When a tissue is called degeneration, it must be understood to mean a particular type of change in the tissue, such as saying fat degeneration is the presence of fat in a particular tissue, such is the perception, naming accordingly, such as the heart Deterioration, muscular degeneration, mechanical degeneration etc
 duusare shabd main utakon ke paushtik aahaar kii kami se koshika kii rasinic kriya main jab parivartan aa jaataa he, to use apakarshan kehete hai
 In this, the cell dies completely and a new type of chemical substance is produced from its protoplasm
 yah padaarth koshika kii rachana se pichhali purnataya bhinn hota he or isse koshika kaa kaary bilkul bhinn ho jaataa he
 When a specific substance comes out of the lymph inside the cell, it is called inhalation
 yah ant:spandan mukhyat: vasiy, chooneydaar varna kii tathaa amiloid prakaar ko hota he, jab ki apakarsh vasiy mucaide tathaa coloid hota he
 When there is a type of rot in the tissue due to lack of blood, it is called koth
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he shushk koth tathaa ardra 
 Dry koth - When the blood reaches an organ through an artery of one part, dry koth is produced
 ardra kosh - isamen shiraaon dwaara ang vishesh se rakt kaa hriday kii ore dhoya janaa purnataya ruk jaataa he
 There is a flow of blood at that place, but there is no drain
 uparyukt do prakaar ke koth ke atirikt or prakaar ke bhi koth hote hai, jaise, ant: shaalyik koth, sankrami koth, vaatikoth, madhumeh janit koth, vardhaky koth tathaa renon kaa rog 
 The action of chronic or destroyed tissue or cells is regained as much as possible, with the intention that their regeneration is called reconstruction, or renovation
 yah sharir kii aisi vishisht avasthaa he, jisamen shaareerik utak kii navvruddhi hoti he
 Generally, tumors are of two types: mridu arbud - ye praghatak isiilie kahe jate hai ki inke dwaara jivan ko kisi prakaar kii kshati nahin pahunchati
 Malignant tumors - In those tumors where disruption is excessive, the shape of tissue is not formed
 unki rachana utak se bhinn hoti he tathaa unki vruddhi bahut hi drut veg se hoti he
 They circulate in the body quickly and induce healthy ingredients inside
 is aantarik prasaaran kii kriya ko metastasis kehete hai
 For this reason, they are also very deadly and because of this they are called deadly, wicked, or few tumors
 manushya sharir main jab koi rogotpadak jeevanuon kaa akraman hota he, to sharir ke andar prakruti unka ghortam pratirodh karti he or isi yuddh main sharir ke bali kosh un bahari jeevanuon kaa bal nasht karke sharir ko rog se bachaa lete hai
 This curative power produced from inside the body is called immunity
 pratiraksha do prakaar kii hoti he : Natural immunity - The natural force that is produced inside the body in resistance to a disease is called natural immunity
 arjeet pratiraksha - kisi vyakti main kisi vishesh rog ke pratirodh kii shakti yadi nahin he or peeche se swayan yaa kisi anya upayon dwaara usamen us rog ke pratirodh kii shakti paidaa kar di jaae, to use arjeet pratiraksha kah sakate hai
 For example, some germs that produce cholera, smallpox, pearl, tetanus, etc
 are small that can cause disease once they enter the body, but produce small amounts of immunity against disease
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ek vish adhik maatra main hone se sharir main vyaadhi utpann karata he, kintu vahi vish atyalp maatra main rahane se pratiraksha paidaa karata he

" to the eighteenth verse "agne naye sapatha raye asman vidvani dev vayunani scholar 


", words like Brahman-description, worship, prayer etc
 are mentioned
 ek hi swar he — brahm kaa, gyaan kaa, aatm-gyaan kaa
 This Upanishad, having a wonderful art, is a talk of God being the creator of God, the owner of the entire universe is mentioned, it is said of the Satvik lifestyle that do not look at the wealth of others

 It comes to a folk called 'asuraya' - Asuariya means a world devoid of sun
 vah lok jahaan surya nahin pahunch paata, ghaney, kaale andhkaar se bharaa hua anchatam lok, arthath garbhlok
 It has been said that those who do not recognize the self, their 'self', defy the soul, deny it and spend their whole life under this rejection, after death, they had to go to the same darkest world, that is, Asuriya
 That means you have to conceive, have to be born again
 is prakaar is upanishad main ek ore ishwar ko sarvanirmaataa maanakar swayan ko nimitt maatr banakar jivan jeene kaa ishaara karata he, jo duusari ore aatm ko na bhuulane kii ingit karata he

 The confession is here
 isamen sambhuti evam nashvan donon ko bhaleebhanti samaj kar avinashi tatv prapti evam amrit tatv ke upbhog kii baat kahi gai he
 In the last verses of this Upanishad, there are very beautiful verses - the matter of stitching the mouth of Brahma with a golden vessel and prayed to the nurturer of the sun
