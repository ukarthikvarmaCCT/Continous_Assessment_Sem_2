 26 navambar 1949 ko bharat ke rajyashetra main adhivasit vyakti bhartiya samvidhan ke sangat praavdhaanon ke anusaar swatah hi bharat ke naagarik ban gayi
 The Indian Constitution has also made provisions regarding citizenship of immigrants coming from areas of Pakistan which were part of India before partition
 naagarikta ke tyaag ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 8 ke tahat cover kiya jaataa he
 If an adult declares his renunciation of Indian citizenship, he loses Indian citizenship
 iske alaava tyaag kii dinaank se hi aise vyakti kaa avyask baccha bhi bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he
 When the child reaches the age of eighteen, he again has the right to obtain Indian citizenship
 bhartiya naagarikta kanoon ke tahat tyaag kii ghoshnaa ke liye aavashyak he ki ghoshnaa karne vaala vyakti "purna aayu or kshamta se yukt" ho
 Termination of citizenship is covered in section 9 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 samaapti ke liye praavdhaan alag hai or tyaag kii ghoshnaa ke praavdhaan se vibhedit hai
 According to Section 9 of the Act, any citizen of India who by registration or equation acquires citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship will be revoked
 It also provides that any citizen of India who voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship will be revoked
 In particular, the termination provision is different from the provision of renunciation, because it is "india's Applies to any citizen "and is not restricted to adults only
 isiilie bhartiya bachche bhi swatah hi apni bhartiya naagarikta ko kho dete hai yadi unke janm ke baad kabhi bhi ve kisi or desh kii naagarikta praapt kar lete hai, udhaaharan ke liye, sameekaran yaa panjikaran ke dwaara- chaahe kisi anya naagarikta kaa adhigrahan bachche ke abhibhavakon kii karrwai kaa parinaam hi kyon na ho
 According to the Citizenship Rules 1956, obtaining a passport from another country is also a voluntary acquisition of the nationality of that country
 naagarikta ke niyamon kii anusuchee III ke niyam 3 ke anusaar, "yah tathy ki bharat ke ek naagarik ne kisi dinaank ko kisi anya desh kii sarkaar se passport praapt kiya he, is baat kaa nirnaayak pramaan hoga ki usne us desh kii naagarikta ko svaichhik rup se praapt kiya he
 "once again, this rule applies if a foreign passport has been obtained for the child by his parents and whether it is necessary to obtain such passport according to the laws of any other country, which the child must become a citizen of his own
 Believes
 It does not matter that the person still has an Indian passport
 vah vyakti jo kisi or naagarikta ko praapt kar letaa he vah usee din se bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he jis din usne kisi or desh kii naagarikta yaa passport arjeet kiya
 a prevalent practice for British diplomatic posts, for example, is to seize an Indian passport from applicants who apply for a British passport, or who have received it
 goa, daman or div ke sambandh main bhartiya nagarikon ke liye khaas niyam hai
 According to Rule 3A of the Schedule to the Citizenship Rules, 1956, "a person who has become an Indian citizen by virtue of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Order 1962, or the Goa, Daman and Diu Order 1962, issued under section 7 of the Citizenship Act 1955 and He has a passport issued by another country or the fact that he has not returned his passport before January 19, 1963, would be conclusive proof that he voluntarily gave it before this date
 Has acquired the citizenship of the country
 16 farvari 1962 ko, bharat ke sarvocch nyaayalay kii nyaaypith ne izhaar ahamed khan banaam bharat sangh ke maamle main kaha ki "agar aisa paaya jaataa he ki vyakti ne sameekaran yaa panjikaran ke dwaara videshi naagarikta praapt kii he, to isamen koi andeh nahin ki is prakaar ke sameekaran yaa panjikaran ke parinamswaroop vah bharat kaa naagarik nahin rahegaa
 It is a form of Indian nationality, the holder of which is called a foreign national of India
 bhartiya samvidhan dohari naagarikta athwa dohari rashtriyata ko asweekaar karata he, avyask is drushti se apwaad hai jahaan duusari naagarikta anayas hi praapt ho jaati he
 Indian authorities have interpreted the law that a person cannot hold a passport from another country if he has an Indian passport - even in the case of a child who is claimed to be his citizen by another country and such It may be that the laws of that country require that child's passport to travel abroad - and Indian courts have given the car Binding branch has wide discretion
 isliye, bharat kii videshi naagarikta bharat kii purna naagarikta nahin he or is prakaar se yah dohari naagarikta yaa dohari rashtriyata ko asweekaar karata he
 The Central Government of India can, on application, register a person as a foreign national of India if the person is of Indian origin and is from a country that allows dual citizenship in one form or another
 vyapak rup se kaha jaye to "bhartiya mul kaa ek vyakti" kisi anya desh kaa naagarik he jo: Note that children of Indian parents do not automatically fulfill these requirements and are therefore not automatically eligible for OCI
 bhartiya mishnon ko aise maamalon main 30 dinon ke bheetar bharat kii videshi naagarikta dene ke liye praadhikrut kiya gaya he jahaan koi gambhir aparaadh shaamil naa ho jaise nashile padaarthon kii taskari, naitik adhamta, aatankwaadi gatividhiyaan yaa aisi koi gatividhiyaan jinke kaaran ek saal se zyada kii jail ho sakati ho
 Overseas Indian citizenship cannot be granted to those who have acquired, or are planning to obtain foreign nationality, or have an Indian passport
 is kanoon ke anusaar aavashyak he ki bhartiya naagarik jo videshi rashtriyata letaa he, use turant apana bhartiya passport lautaa dena chahie
jo log iske liye paatr hai, ve videshi bhartiya naagarikta ke panjikaran ke liye aavedan kar sakate hai
 There is no plan for Indian nationals to passports to foreign nationals, although the certificate of registration will be in a passport-like booklet
 The Council of Ministers has also given guidelines to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to work on the proposal to give biometric smart cards to registered foreign nationals of India
 
 bharat kaa ek videshi naagarik samta ke aadhaar par gaiyr-pravasi bharatiyon ke liye uplabdh sabhi adhikaron or visheshadhikaron kaa laabh uthaa saktaa he
 It does not include the right to invest in agricultural and plantation property or to hold public office
 vyakti ko apana maujuuda videshi passport rakhana hota he jisamen nayaa vija shaamil hona chahie jo 'you' vija kehalaata he, jo ek bahu prayojan, bahu pravesh, vija he or jivan bhar chalata he
 With this, a foreign national of India can visit the country anytime, for any purpose, for any time period
 bharat kaa ek vieshi naagarik bharat main rahete hue bhi nimnlikhit adhikaron kaa laabh nahin uthaa paayegaa: matdaan kaa adhikaar, raashtrapati karyaalay, up raashtrapati karyaalay, sarvocch nyaayalay or ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish, lok sabha, rajya sabha, vidhaan sabha yaa vidhaan parishad main sadsy banane kaa adhikaar, saarvajanik sevaaon main niyukti kaa adhikaar
saath hi bharat ke videshi naagarik bhitari rekha ke permit ke liye paatr nahin hai, agar ve bharat ke kuch vishesh sthanon kii yatra karnaa chaahate hai to unhen unhen ek sangrakshit kshetra permit ke liye aavedan dena hoga
 An interesting question is that a person registered as a foreign national of India will lose the right to diplomatic protection of his country while living in India
 Article 4 of the Hague Convention on specific questions related to the conflict of nationality law of 1930 states that " a state cannot provide diplomatic protection to a person against a state whose nationality is also held by such persons
 Depends on the subjects: First, whether the Government of India considers the foreign citizenship of India as true citizenship and on this basis the right of diplomatic protection by another country ceases; and second, whether the individual's own country recognizes it and Accepts India's rejection
 donon hi bindu sandigdh hai
 India does not provide an independent travel document to foreign nationals but instead places a visa in another country's passport
 yadi vyakti keval duusare desh kaa passport rakhane ke liye paatr he parantu bhartiya yatra dastavej ke kisi bhi rup ko nahin rakh saktaa, to is nishkarsh se batch paanaa mushkil he ki vah vyakti rajanyik sangrakshan ke prayojan ke liye anya desh kaa ekmaatr naagarik he
 On obtaining foreign citizenship of India, British citizens cannot register as full British citizens under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act of 1981
 This does not prevent them from obtaining full British citizenship in a different way and it does not revoke their British citizenship if they are already registered under Section 4B

 See British nationality law
 Between 1 January 1949 and 25 January 1950, Indians were subject to the British without citizenship, until they had already acquired citizenship of the United Nations and colonies or other Commonwealth countries
 26 janvari 1950 ko bhartiya samvidhan ke lagu hone par, british rashtriyata kanoon ke tahat, ek vyakti jo bhartiya naagarik ban jaataa tha, uske paas rashtramandal kii bhartiya sadsyta or unki bhartiya naagarikta ke sandarbh main rashtramandal naagarik kaa darja bhi hota tha 
 haalanki, asankhya bharatiyon ko bhartiya samvidhan ke lagu hone par bhartiya naagarikta praapt nahin hui or ve naagarikta ke darje ke bina british ke adheen bane rahe jab tak unhone kisi anya rashtramandal desh kii naagarikta praapt nahin kar lee

 For this reason, his poetry called "child Harold" became very famous and his influence on poets all over Europe

 The theory of structural engineering is based on empirical knowledge related to physical laws and properties of various materials / geometries
 anekon chote chote sanrachanaatmak avyavon ke yoga se jatil sanrachanaayen nirmit kii jaatin hai
 a structural engineer should not only have the knowledge of iron and steel, but also have advanced knowledge of wood, brick, stone, lime and cement and should also be proficient in mechanical and electrical engineering work, because they are safe and secure according to the principles of their structure, mechanics and physics
 Have to make from bhoomi, jal or vaayu kii prakruti kaa bhi purna gyaan civil ejeeniyar ke samaan hi hona chahie
 Structural engineering was considered a department of civil engineering till the 19th century, but as the requirements of civil society changed and increased according to the circumstances, production and use of advanced types of iron, steel etc
 started to increase, so did mechanics Has progressed

 The design of each building requires roofs and floors for dharnas, scissors, pillars and a foundation built on the ground
 inkaa sangyojan hi makaan kaa 'dhaanchaa' he
 Whether the structure is for any building, bridge or crane, etc
, it is necessary to consider while constructing them that what kind of force and how much quantity of external force will fall on their various components
 sthitiki ke siddhantanusaar un balon ke kaaran, dhaanche ke vividh avyavon par aanevaale pratibalon kii gananaa bhi badi saavdhaanee se kerani hoti he, jisase dhaanchaa sab prakaar se sudrudh or niraapad ban jaae
 Making the structure strong does not mean making its components very thick and heavy
 dhaanche kii banaavat main bal sahan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 Such a structure is made by combining several triangles
 chaturbhujon or panchabhujon se bane dhaanche main itani kshamta nahin hoti
 The triangular frame is called scissors

 For large legs, triangular canes are very strong and very light and cheap
 kainchiyon ke jodon ko pinon dwaara na banaakar ribaton dwaara pakkaa jad diya jaataa he
 Some special types of forces start coming in the rebats which these rebates must be made stronger to bear

 Therefore, these burdens have to be estimated very carefully

 The forces falling on different components of the structure are calculated according to the principle of force triangle or force polygons
 iske liye ejeeniyar "bau sanket" pranali kaa upyog karte hai
 This method is relatively simple
 balon kaa pariklan vishuddh ganit dwaara bhi sthitiki or trikonmiti kii sahaayta se kiya ja saktaa he
 To calculate in this way, assuming an appropriate point to be the center of the pulverizer, equate the rotating force of unknown force falling in any component of the structure
 jitne hi adhik bade paat kii chat kii kanchi athwa pul kaa kanchinuma garder anaaya jaataa he usamen utane hi adhik sankhya main chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yahi baat kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yah baat kainchiyon ke thaamon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Therefore, the scissors are divided into small triangles of appropriate size to withstand the force
 dhaanchaa par jo boj padate hai use bhaar kehete hai
 Movable and fixed loads are mentioned above
 yadi bhaar kisi thodi si jagah par kendrit he, to use kendrit bhaar or yadi puure avyavon par failaa ho, to use vibhajit bhaar kehete hai
 The load of the vehicles, trains, motors, trucks, etc
, is called the load and the load coming from one direction and immediately after the other direction is called the load with the alternating load and the impact load

 Stress, compression, shear, cramps etc
 can be stress due to the condition and tendency of the load

 hook ne san 1676 main ek niyam sthapit kiya ki yadi prayek padaarth par uski pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaaya jaae, to uske kaaran padanevaala pratibal tathaa us padaarth main honevaali vikruti main ek vishesh anupaat hoga
 In 1826, Dr
 Young definitively ascertained the proportions of deformations in various substances due to stresses falling within the range of elasticity
 ise yang kaa pratyasthata mapank kehete hai
 The tensile and compression ratios are expressed by the E, shear ratios C, or the letter g and the volume ratios are expressed by the k letter: pratyaksh pratyasthata mapank Transverse elasticity modulus sampeden se padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he
 Thus, the elastic elasticity modulus tapochar tathaa yantropchaar se pratyasthata mapaankon main parivartan ho jaaya karata he
 If a solid rod is pulled, we see that it breaks thinly in the middle and if it is pulled by applying force within the range of elasticity, its lateral measurement becomes smaller as it increases in length
 
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chad ko dabaaya jaae, to uski parshvik naap bad jaati he
 Therefore, the change in the lateral measurements of a direct solid due to stretch or pressure is in proportion to the Poisson
 ise m akshar se vyakt karte hai
 a pure mismatch is in the form of a mixture of stresses, two materials and each other acting in opposite directions
 inaki kriya rekha bhi ek duusare se samakon par hoti he
 If one end of the axle is firmly tightened in the wall and the other end is applied with force, the other end will be slightly bent
 mula rekha se jitna kone, dd banaakar vah mudata he vah kone uskaa anthan kone hoga
 With the help of this angle the spasm force of axle can be removed
 ejiniyari main kaam aanevaali samagriyon kaa pareekshan atyaavashyak he
 Placing them under the same conditions as the materials used, should be tested

 Nowadays, a device has been made to test the material in physical way, which is called Hounsfield tensometer
 isaki kaarypaddati badi saral he or saamaanya vyakti bhi thode se prashikshan se iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 With this, knowledge of the strength of materials, load distortion, abstinence etc
 is easily achieved
 jab tak kisi padaarth par padanevaale pratibal us padaarth kii pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar rahata he, tab tak vikruti badi sookshm yaa asthaayee hoti he
 As soon as the weight is removed, that substance returns to its original state
 par yadi pratibal pratyasthata kii seemaa ke upar ho, to vikruti paryaapt ore adhik sthaayee hoti he
 The fraction weight is much higher than the limit of elasticity, but in terms of trade and utility, this weight is kept low and is called the point of defeat and it is considered as the differential weight
 pratyasthata kii seemaa sahane yogya bhaar se bhi kaaphi kam maatra main bhaar daalane kii yojana, abhiklpana ke samay kii jaati he
 Therefore, the ratio in which this practical load is less than the most bearable load, that ratio is called the Abbey Coefficient or Depressor of that substance
 ise nimnlikhit sutara se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Representatives of different substances are different in different states
 kathor ispaat kaa abhayank sthir bhaar main teen tathaa chal bhaar main paanch se aath or prayavarti chal bhaar main nau se 13 tak hota he

 a voltmeter is an electrical device used to measure the voltage between two points of a circuit
 jab tak chal kundalee voltmapi yaa aankik voltmapi kaa vikaas nahin hua tha, tab tak vibhavamaapi se hi vibhavaantar mapa jaataa tha
 That is why 'meter' or 'mapi' has come in its name
 vibhavaantar maapan kii yah vidhi san 1841 main jonan chrishchiyan pogendroph dwaara bataayi gayi thi
 The potentiometer acts as an ideal voltmeter
 yah yantra vibhavantar naapane ke prayog main to laayaa hi jaataa he kintu saath hi saath isse dharaman evam pratirodh bhi gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 If a steady current flows through a long and uniform wire and that wire has a resistance of one length, then the difference of one length of the wire and = d is equal to the length of the wire due to the length difference of that wire
 = Dh x p x l
 ab yadi ham kisi cell ko, jiskaa vidyut vaahak bal ba he, kisi galavanometer se shreneebaddh karke vibhavamaapi ke bindu k or kha ke bich jod den to us dharamapi main kuch dharaa bahegi or vikshep hoga
 This current will be proportional to the difference of the potential difference between the points of the potentiometer and the differential of the sal since both the voltages are acting to send the current in the opposite direction
 yadi bindu kha ko taar par khiskaaya jaae, to binduon k or kha ke bich kaa vibhavantar bad legaa
 Thus the wire will have a length when the difference between the points a and b is exactly equal to the electric carrying force of the cell and there will be no deflection in the dielectric at that time
 yadi us taar kii lambaai l1 ho, to va1 = dha x pa x l1
 Similarly, if the length of the wire required for zero deflection in a galvanometer is used by an authentic cell, whose electromagnetic force is 2, and 2 = Dh x p x 2, if the current is constant in both experiments or agyaat vidyut vaahak bal kaa vibhavantar, The minimum difference that can be measured by a potentiometer is called the 'sensitivity' of that device and the one which has the highest potential difference is called Paras
