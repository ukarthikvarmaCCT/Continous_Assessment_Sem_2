 ye vivaad kabhi-kabhi jhagade or ladaaiyon main badal jate the
 When Siddhartha was 28 years old, there was a fight between Shakya and the servants of Kolis over Rohini's water, injuring people on both sides
 jhagade kaa pataa chalane par shaakyon or coliyon ne sochaa ki kyon na is vivaad ko yuddh dwaara hameshaa ke liye hal kar liya jaye
 The commander of the Sakyas called a session of the Shakya Sangha to consider the question of declaration of war against the Kolis and proposed war to the Union
 siddharth gautam ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya or kaha yuddh kisi prashn kaa samaadhaan nahin hota, yuddh se kisi uddeshy kii purti nahin hogi, isse ek duusare yuddh kaa bijaropan hoga
 Siddharth said that i propose that we choose two men from among us and ask the Kolis to choose two men
 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat

 The term "positive" or "" negative "refers to the presence or deficiency of the rhd antigen whether or not there are other antigens of the Rhesus system
 Cross-matching of the antagonistic rhd antigen is essential, as the rhd antigen is mmunogenic, ie Individuals who are rhd negative are likely to develop anti-rhd when they encounter a rhd antigen, when a person is sensitized against the rhd antigen, has a rhd igg antigen in their blood Gay will bind to rhd positive rbcs and may cross the placenta ab 29 maanav rakt samooh pranaaliyon ko antarrashtriya raktaadhan sampradaay ke dwaara manyata praapt hanek purna rakt prakaar laal rakt koshikaon kii sataha ke puure 29 padaarthon ke jatthe kaa varnan karegaa or ek vyakti kaa rakt prakaar rakt samooh pratijanon ke kai sambhav sanyojanon main se ek he29 rakt samoohon main, 600 se adhik vibhinn rakt samooh pratijan paye gaye hai,lekin in main se kai bahut virale hai yaa phir mukhya rup se kuch jaateey samoohon main paye jate hai Almost always, a person has the same blood group for life, but very rarely a person's blood type is caused by an increase or suppression of antigen, a person's blood type infection, malignancy or autoimmune disease

 rhd negative women or patients with rhd antagonists should not be plated, so the blood cells must conserve Rhesus negative blood in extreme situations such as severe bleeding when there is less rhd negative blood units in the blood corpuscles
 rhd positive blood can be given to women above childbearing age and rhd negative men to protect rhd antibodies, If they do not have anti-rhd antibodies
 The opposite is not true: rhd negative blood does not react to rhd positive patients

 Although special potent anti-a, anti-b or other abnormal blood groups are out of repulsive blood donation, the terms ubiquitous donor and ubiquitous donors The lesions are simplified because they are only focusing on the possible responses of the recipient's anti-a and anti-b antibodies to the infused red blood cells and possible sensitization of the rhd antigens to the anti-a and Potential response among anti-b antibodies was not taken into account because only a small fraction of the antimicrobial plasma infusions Has been done udaahranvash: yah sochate hue kii rakt samooh a rd sakaaratmak praptakarta main rhd nakaaratmak rakt kaa aadhaan, praptakarta ke anti-b rog pratikaarak or aadhanit laal rakt koshikaon main pratiraksha pratikriya kii ummid nahin he halanki chadhaae gaye rakt main plasma main anti-a rog pratikaarak kii apekshaakrit choti raashi hoti he jo praptakarta kii laal rakt koshika kii sataha ke a pratijanon ke saath pratikriya kar saktaa he, tanukaran gunak ke kaaran kisi mahatvapurn pratikriya kii ummid nahin he Rhesus d samvedikaran pratyaashit nahin he
 In addition to A, b and Rh D, red blood cell surface antigens can cause sensitization and adverse reactions if they are able to stick to analogous antibodies to produce immune responses

 of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups, and now 29 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion, and across the 29 blood groups, over 600 different blood group antigens have been found, but many of these are very rare or are mainly found in certain ethnic groups
 The blood type was used in forensic science and paternity testing, but genetic fingerprinting which is more reliable has replaced them both
