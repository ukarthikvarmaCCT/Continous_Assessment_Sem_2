 David Imile Durkheim was a great sociologist in France
 karl marks tathaa maiks webar ke saath ve bhi aadhunik samaaj vigyaan ke mukhya shilpi evam samajashaastra ke janak kahe jate hai
 David Emile Durkheim is considered the founder of modern sociology and the first official sociologist in the world in sociological terms
 adhyayan kii vishvavidhyalayan vyavastha main ve samajashaastra ke pehle profesar bhi the
 In the three decades of his academic life, he not only established sociology as a specific discipline, but also laid the theoretical and methodological ground of this discipline
 durkhime kii samajashastreey sankalpana kaa vidheyak tatva manushya ko saamaajik sambandhon kaa parinaam maanata he
 For this reason Durkheim's sociology refuses to recognize any form of individualism in its infrastructure
 manushya kii iyatta ko samaaj kii upaj maanane ke sandarbh main durkhime comt, marks, webar aadi saamaajik chintakon ke nazadik baithte hai
 It is important to consider that the person is the product of the society and giving central importance to the social phenomenon itself gives sociology a distinct form compared to other disciplines
 samajashaastra kii yah vishistataa durkhime ke bina sambhav nahin thi
 Although Durkheim has also thought intensively on issues ranging from thinkers like Montescue and Rousseau to pragmatism, socialism and moral education, his four works in the field of sociology - 'the Division of Labor', 'the Rules of Socioeconomic Method', ' Suicide 'and' The Elementary Forms of the Release's Life 'are considered most important
 david emil durkhime kaa janm apinal, loren ke ek francisi yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 Both his father and grandfather were rabbis
 unki shuruaati shiksha bhi ek dharmik skool main hui, lekin jivan ke shuru main hi unhone puri tarah se secular jivan guzaarane kaa nishchay kiya
 As an undergraduate student, he enrolled in the renowned Ecol Normale Superiorie and in 1886, as part of his doctorate, he created 'the Division of Labor in Society'
 is rachana main durkhime aadhunik or parmparik samaajon kaa fark dikhaate hue yah pratipaadit karte hai ki aadhunik samaaj jahaan shram ke vishesheekaran par aadhaarit hota he vahiin parmparik samaaj saajhe vishwaason par chalata he
 According to him, this difference of forms of society also reflects the difference in the system of rules
 is tarah aadhunik samaaj swa- niyaman se sanchalit hota he jabaki parmparik samaaj ke niyam bahari vishwaason or anumodan par tike hote hai
 According to Durkheim, since shared beliefs rest on the authority of common morality, a system based on these beliefs can only be sustained through power and pressure
 jabaki swaniyamkaari yaa aadhunik samaaj swatantraaa, samanta tathaa nyaay jaise tattvon ke bina santulit nahin rah saktaa
 Scholars believe that this formulation of looking at the diversity of social forms by linking them to specific frameworks of rules has been a fundamental driving force for sociological studies of crime and law
 durkhime maanate the ki samaaj ke parmparik or aadhunik roopon main vibhram ke kaaran tathaa aadhunik samaajon par parmparik kanoon yaa niyam thopane kii pravriti hi kai saamaajik samasyaon ke liye jimmedaar rahi he
 This interpretation of modern societies is considered a distinct achievement of Durkheim's work
 is rachana main durkhime vyakti ke saamaajik saahchary yaa judaav kaa vishleshan karte hue yah vichaar bhi rakhte hai ki vyakti ko khaas tarah kii saamaajik saahchary kii zarurat padati he
 Durkheim shows that within social institutions there is an element of self which demands a certain behavior from its partners
 durkhime isiilie is baat par jor dete the ki vyakti ke bajaay saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 According to him the concrete form of these social processes is expressed in institutions and behavior which can also be studied on the basis of monitoring
 durkhime in prakriyaaon ko soshal facts yaa saamaajik tathyon kii sangya dete hai
 Durkheim is also credited with the creative use of statistics in sociological studies
 is sambandh main unki rachana suiside ek maanak kii tarah sthapit he
 In this work Durkheim proposed that different rates of suicide can be interpreted on the basis of differences in the individual's levels of social affiliation
 masalan, unhone dikhaaya ki vyakti kii nijee pravritiyon ke aadhaar par is baat kaa andaaza nahin lagaaya ja saktaa ki umrdaraj purush hi kyon aatmahatya karte hai
 But if the factors of a person's social status such as his being unmarried or his isolation from society, etc
, the cause of suicide can be identified
 durkhime apane adhyayan main sankhyikee kaa istemaal saamaajik tathyon jaise kisi samooh ke sadasyon ke aapasi saahchary ke roopon kii takat yaa charitra ujagar karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, if the feeling of mutual companionship is weak in a group, then there will be more chances of moral or psychological problems in its members
 iske ulat agar kisi samooh main saahchary kii bhaavana bahut gahari ho to uske sadsy apane samooh ke liye tyaag karne ke liye zyaada tatpar paye jaaenge
 Durkheim's other work, 'the Rules of Socioecological Method', is considered to be the cornerstone of the methods used in sociology
 is rachana main durkhime spasht karte hai ki samajashaastra kii kendriya vishay- vastu saamaajik vyavastha he, lihaaza usamen vyakti ke bajaay samaaj ke saansthanik or vyavasthaagat roopon ko pramukhataa di jaani chahie
 In this composition Durkheim describes sociology as a study of such social facts
 unke anusaar in saamaajik tathyon ke bich ek khaas tarah kii sangati hoti he jise keval unke nirmaankari anshon kaa sanchit parinaam nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In his work Suicide, Durkheim wanted to clarify the same point that even a private phenomenon like suicide can be explained on the basis of people's associative relationships and social bonding
 unki daleel thi ki vyakitgat bhavanaaen, mulya yaa vichaar jaisi chijen vastav main saamaajik sahabhaagita se hi upajati hai
 Durkheim's two compositions, 'the Division of Labor' and 'the Elementary Forms of the Religious Life', are known to use modern approaches to the then social order
 aadhuniktaa ke samajashastreey vimarsh main ye donon rachanaayen apane baarik or saghan adhyayan ke kaaran aaj bhi ek anivaary sandarbh bani hui hai
 Durkheim's contemplation was modern in a deep sense
 froid jaise manovishleshak bhi apane samay ke purvagrahon se mukt nahin ho paye the or apni kriti totum and tabu main aadim dimaag kii tulana maansik rogi se kar baithe the, jabaki durkhime ne apni rachana alementary forms of da relijas life main yah pratipaadit kiya ki tarkbuddhi ke lihaaz se aadim kabeelon kii saamaajik sanrachanaayen or vishwaas aadhunik manushya kii tarkbuddhi se kamatar nahin tehraye ja sakate
 This was a bold idea given the political ramifications prevailing in Durkheim's time
 chunki durkhime tarkbuddhi ko saamaajik utpaada maanate hai isiilie manushya ko kamatar yaa shreshthatar sabit karne vaale vichaar ko ve sire se kaarij kar dete hai
 Durkheim's intervention has equipped sociology with a basic egalitarianism
 ukt rachana main dharm kii saamaajik upyogita par vichaar karte hue durkhime yah daleel pesh karte hai ki manushya dharmik reeti-rivaazon tathaa karmkandon main bhagidaari ke zariye hi maanviya tarkbuddhi ke buniyadi roopon- spes, samay, vargeekaran, shakti, kaary-kaaran kii samaj tathaa sampoornataa kaa bodh arjeet karata he
 Durkheim also introduces the idea that the social experience of purity gives rise to social interrelations
 unke mutabik saamaajik vyakti kaa janm tathaa tarkbuddhi kaa vikaas bhi isi prakriya se nirast hota he
 Durkheim also says in this work that all concepts originate from society
 isliye tark, bhashaa or arth kii samaj viksit karne ke liye is baat kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki shabdon or avadharanaon kaa kin saamaajik roopon or sandarbhon main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Here, Durkheim describes religion as a function of society and makes another important formulation that religion is a means of maintaining social order
 durkhime dharmik vishwaason kii satyata ko sidhe to nahin nakaarte lekin unke liye dharm kaa satya uski is kshamta se tay hota he ki vah karmkandon ko protsaahit kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 According to him, organized religions cannot be understood only on the basis of beliefs, because such religions are often found while suppressing personal faith to keep traditional forms of society intact
 aadhunik or parmparik samaajon main dharm kii bhoomika ko lekar durkhime kaa yah sutara bhi kaabile gaur he ki samaaj kii in do alag kismon main dharm ke prakaarya ek jaise nahin hote
 Religion is a tool of social control in traditional societies whereas in modern societies its function becomes non-essential because in modern societies it becomes a function of knowledge and epistemology
 isiilie saamaajik vyavastha main uski bhoomika pehle jaisi nahin rah jaati
 Durkheim's conclusion that sociopolitical thinking would be considered an achievement is that the phenomenon of a human being transforming from a biological being to a social animal cannot be explained on the basis of one's biological abilities or psychology
 unki daleel he ki jaivik kaa saamaajik main roopantaran saamaajik prakriyaaon ke madhyam se sampann hota he
 Therefore, Durkheim feels that the opinion that the mind and body are called two separate rights, only shows the difference between biological existence and social animal standing outside the process of society
 unke anusaar pehali avasthaa ke praani ko rashnal manushya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 They also emphasize that in human beings, things like rationality or personality arise from the process of society itself
 durkhime kaa mat tha ki manushya ko ek saamaajik praani ke rup main banaaye rakhane ke liye saamaajik prakriyaaon or saahchary ke khaas roopon kii darkaar hoti he
 That is, a social man cannot be seen apart from his fixed social configuration and context
 isliye durkhime aagaah bhi karte hai ki agar manovigyaan, arthshaastra yaa darshanashastra ke adhyayan kii koi paddati saamaajik parighatna ko keval vyaktiyon kii sanchit gatividhiyon ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa upkram karti he to use samaaj jaise sabase mahatvapurn paksh ko darkinar karne kaa doshi samajha janaa chahie
 hgfrtew Despite egalitarianism's apparent reputation in Durkheim's contemplation and work, feminist analysts say she has not paid enough attention to the issue of women
 ek had tak yah baat sahi he ki samajashastri ke taur par durkhime kii koi bhi rachana stri-paksh par ekagra nahin he
 But at the time of the nineteenth century when Durkheim was organizing sociology, very few social thinkers were considering the questions of women
 suiside main unhone aatmahatya kii ek bhagyavaadee kism kaa zikr kiya he jise ve mukhyatah striyon ke saath jod kar dekhte hai
 Durkheim also thought that marriage is beneficial for men but it has a negative effect on the lives of women
 da divizan of lebar main durkhime muulavaasiyon ke hawaale se bataate hai ki aise samudaayon main striyon kii saamaajik sthiti purushon ke mukaable kamatar nahin thim jabaki iske ulat aadhunik samaajon main stri kii haisiyat kamazor hoti gayi he
 The average tendency of erstwhile society portrayed the woman as soft and weak
 ise dekhte hue durkhime kii drushti nishchay hi agragami kahi jaaegi
 Durkheim's contribution has been a matter of inspiration, questioning, inclusion and cross-examination for many generations of sociologists
 tees ke dashak main talcott parcens ne durkhime ke krititv ko sanrachanaatmak prakaaryawad main sametane kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, Durkheim's contribution to America began to be viewed through formalism and positivism
 jabaki frans main unki drushti kaa levi-stros jaise maanavshastriyon ne upyog kiya jinaki dilchaspee durkhime dwaara pratipaadit sankalpanaaon, vichaaron or samaaj ke antarsambandhon ke aadhaar par ek pratikwaadi maanavshaastra rachane main thi
 But this venture to make a new interpretation based on Durkheim's ideas proved to be one-sided in that he used only certain parts of Durkheim's original preface
 marxvaadi dhara ke samajashastriyon ne apane lekhan main durkhime ke chintan main nihit radical swaroop ko mahatva dete hue parcens ke drushtikon ko pratisantulit karne kaa prayaas kiya he jo durkhime ko raajnneetik rup se roodhiwaadee sabit karne par jor detaa he
 a group of sociologists believe that Durkheim's sociology is secondary to the individual
 lekin dhyaan se dekhen to durkhime aisa iradatan karte hai
 His vision urges society to be understood as collectivism and emphasizes that the basic aim of sociology is to be synonymous with individualism if it does not pay attention to the investigation of social theories and the study of contradictions in the practice of sociology
 Is canceled
 durkhime ke tain samajashaastra kaa kaam yah nahin he ki vah darshanashastreey sandhan ke liye kachi saamagree muhaiyaa karaaye or phir is baat kaa intazaar kare ki darshanikon kaa khemaa apane moolyankan main kya kahata he
 On the other hand, Durkheim argues that sociology should formulate the criteria for the study of social facts
 unhone darshanashastriyon kii is daleel ko kaarij kar diya ki saamaajik tathyon main aakasmikta kaa tatva hota he
 While giving a well thought out response to this criticism, Durkheim said that certain types of and permanent forms are necessary to maintain the continuity of society

 The word 'metal' is very important in all the scriptures
 dhaatu shabd kii vyutpatti ‘dha’ dhaatu main ‘tun’ pratyay lagane se hua he
 In grammar, 'dhatu' means - 'from which the word originates'
 maharishi panini ne lagbhag do hajaar datuon kaa ullekh kiya he
 The root seed of the language is 'metal'
 ayurveda main vaat-pitt-kaph ko 'dhaatu’ kaha gaya he, jisase samast jeev-sharir kaa nirmaan hua he
 The Dhatu used in Ayurveda cannot be seen, but we experience it as soon as there is a disorder in any of them

 The word metal is formed by adding the suffix 'tun' to 'dha'
 yah shabd kai arthon main prayukt hota he- Value-added tax, or goods and services tax, is a consumption tax, at any value that is added to a product

 VAT is an indirect tax, in the form that the tax is collected from someone who does not bear the full cost of the tax

 Private end consumers of products and services cannot charge VAT on purchases, but the industry purchases goods and services that they purchase to provide further supply or service, which will be sold directly or indirectly to the end user, VAT Can be charged is tarah, aapurti kii aarthik shrinkhalaa main prayek str par lagaaya gaya kul kar, mulya kaa ek nirantar ansh he jo ek vyavsaay dwaara apane utpaadon main joda jaataa he or kar sangrah kii laagat kaa adhikansh, rajya ke bajaay kaarobaar dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he

 Value added tax avoids the stale effect of sales tax by taxing the value added at every stage of production
 paaramparik bikri kar kii bajaay mulya yojit karadhaan ko duniya bhar main pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 In principle, value-added taxes apply to all commercial activities that involve the production and distribution of goods and the provision of services
 ek vyavsaay ke prayek lenden main maal main jude mulya par waite kaa moolyankan or ekathran kiya jaataa he
 Under this concept, the government is taxed on the gross margin of each transaction
 bharat jaise kai vikasshil deshon main, bikri kar / waite ek mahatvapurn rajasav strot hai chunki ucch berojgaare or nune prati vyakti aay, anya aay sroton ko aparyaapt bana detii he
 However, this is opposed by many sub-national governments as it reduces the total revenue collection they collect as well as some loss of autonomy
 bikri kar aamtaur par upabhoktaaon ko keval antim bikri par lagaae jate hai: pratipurti kii vajah se, waite kaa antim keemton par vaisaa hi samgr aarthik prabhaav padataa he
 The main difference is just the additional accounting that needs to be done by those who fall in the middle of the supply chain, not taking into account this lack of VAT, on each member of the production chain, their position in this chain of customers and customers
 Giving and eliminating attempts to check and certify their status is balanced by the use of the same tax
 jab waite pranali main kuch chhot ho to, yadi koi ho, jaisaa kii newjiland main GST ke saath, waite kaa bhugtan karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 a common economic consideration is that if sales tax exceeds 10%, then people become largely involved in tax evasion activities
 duusari ore, kul waite dar, abhinav sangrah pranali ke kaaran vyapak chori ke bina 10% se adhik ho sakati he
 However, because of the special arrangement of its collections, VAT quite easily becomes the target of specific frauds such as carousel fraud which can be very costly for states in terms of tax revenue reduction
 waite lagu karne ke liye maanak tarika yah siddhant he ki ek vyapaar utpaada kii keemat se purv main chukaaye gaye sabhi kar ko ghataate hue kuch pratishat kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 If the VAT rate is 10%, an orange juice manufacturer will deduct 10% of the £ 5 per gallon price from the tax previously paid by the orange farmer

 Each business has a strong incentive for suppliers to pay their taxes, leading to a higher VAT rate than a retail sales tax, with less tax evasion

 sangrah kii chaalaan vidhi ke tahat, prayek vikreta apane utpaada par waite dar lagaataa he or kharidaar ko ek vishesh bijak detaa he jo lagaae gaye kar kii raashi ko ingit karata he
 Buyers who are subject to VAT on their sales use these invoices to obtain a credit towards their liability for VAT
 paarit bijak or praapt bijak par dikhaae gaye kar ke antar ko tab sarkaar ko diya jaataa he 
 In the account-based method, no such special invoice is used
 iske bajaay, kar kii gananaa yojit mulya par kii jaati he, jise rajasav or sweekaarya kharid ke bich ek antar ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 The invoice method is used in most countries today, the only exception being Japan where accounting is used
 sangrah ke samay dwaara, waite yaa to prodbhavan yaa nakad aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Cash based accounting is a very simple form of accounting
 jab vastu yaa seva kii bikri ke liye ek bhugtan praapt hota he, ek sanchay banataa he or rajasav ko nidhiyon kii prapti kii tithi main darj kiya jaataa he - isse koi fark nahin padataa ki bikri kab kii gai
 Checks are written when money is available to bill and the expense is recorded on the date of the check - regardless of when the expense was incurred
 praathmik dhyaan, bank main nakadi kii raashi par kendrit hota he or madhyamik dhyaan yah sunishchit karne main ki sabhi bilon kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya he
 There is not much effort in comparing revenue with the time period when they were earned, or in matching the expenses to the period when they were incurred
 prodbhavan aadhaarit lekhankan, rajasav kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya or kharchon kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Although it is more complex than cash-based accounting, it provides more information about your business
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako, praptiyon ko trek karne main sakasham karata he or dey 
 The accrual basis helps you match revenue to the expenditure incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports

 With a 10% sales tax: atah upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne is raashi ko ekatra kar liya
 The retailer has not lost anything directly to the tax and the retailers have to do additional paperwork so that the sales tax collected by them is properly passed on to the government
 aapurtikarta or nirmaataaon par sahi praaanpatr kii aapurti karne kaa prashasnic boj rahata he or yah jaanch karnaa ki unke graahak upabhokta nahin hai
 With 10% VAT: yani upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne yah rakam karadhaan main ekatra kii
 The business lost nothing directly to the tax

 Note that in each case the VAT paid is equal to 10% of the profit or value added
 bikri kar vyavastha kii tulana main waite pranali kaa laabh yah he ki udyog, khapat ko, yah pramanit karte hue ki yah ek upabhokta nahin he, chipa nahin sakate 
 In the above example, we assumed that the same number of widgets were manufactured and sold before and after the introduction of the tax
 yah vaastavik jivan main sach nahin he
 The fundamentals of supply and demand suggest that any tax increases the transaction price for anyone, whether a buyer or seller
 An increase in price either shifts the demand curve left, or the supply curve shifts upward
 Both are functionally equal
 natijatan, kharide gaye saamaan kii maatra ghat jaati he or / yaa jis keemat ise bechaa jaataa he vah bad jaati he
 The above example does not include this variation of supply and demand, for simplicity and because these effects are different for each type of commodity
 uparokt udhaaharan maanata he ki kar gaiyr virupanyogy he
 Like all other taxes, a VAT, without it, deflects it
 kyonki kisi ke liye keemat bad jaati he, maal kii maatra ghat jaati he
 Accordingly, some people are made worse by more where the government gets better than tax income
 yani, aapurti or maang parivartan ke kaaran tex main hone vaale phaayde kii tulana main kahin zyada haani hoti he
 This is known as deadweight loss
 arthvyavastha dwaara kho di gai aay, sarkaar kii aay se adhik hoti he; kar aksham he
 The entire amount of government income may not be a deadweight drag, if tax revenues are used for profitable spending or have positive externality - in other words, governments can do much more than simply consume tax income
 
 jabaki virupan hote hai, waite jaise upbhog kar, aksar behatar maane jate hai kyonki ve protsaahan ko nivesh ke liye viroopit karte hai, anya prakaar ke adhikansh karadhaan kii tulana main bachat or kaary kam hota he - duusare shabdon main, ek waite utpaadan ke bajaay khapat ko hatotsahit karata he

 Defendants claim that the removal of taxation through income is an arbitrary standard and that value-added tax is actually a proportional tax and that high-income people pay more at the same rate at which they consume more
 donon hi maapan, waite ko ek pragatisheel iskar banane ke bajaay adhik pratigaami banaate hai
 The effective regressive quality of a VAT system can also increase because different classes of goods are taxed at different rates
 isliye waite adhikansh rup se ek flats kar he or vyavhaar main pratigaami ho saktaa he
 Revenue from a value-added tax is often lower than expected because they are difficult and expensive to manage and collect
 kai deshon main, jahaan vyaktigat aay kar or companiyon ke laabh kar kaa sangrah aitihaasik rup se kamjor rahaa he, vahaan waite sangrah anya karon ke mukaable adhik safal rahaa he
 VAT has become more important in many jurisdictions as tariff levels have fallen worldwide due to trade liberalization and essentially VAT has replaced lost tariff revenue

 VAT is more avoidable in some industries, particularly where cash transactions prevail and VAT can be criticized for promoting it
 sarkaar ke drushtikon se, tathaapi, waite, behatar ho saktaa he kyonki yah kam se kam kuch mulya yojan ko pakad saktaa he
 For example, a carpenter may provide services for cash to a homeowner who usually cannot claim an input VAT back
 isliye grihaswami ko kam laagat lagegi or badhai anya karon se batch saktaa he 
 The government will, however, still receive VAT for many other inputs that have been sold to the carpenter and the carpenter will be unable to reclaim VAT on these inputs

 Because exports are generally zero-rated, this is often where VAT fraud occurs

 The key issue of EU VAT asks where supply and consumption take place, thus determining which member countries will collect VAT and how much the VAT rate will be levied
 prayek sadsy desh ke rashtriya waite kanoon ko, EU waite kanoon ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan karnaa chahie jo directive 2006 / 112 / EC main varnit hai
 It explains the basic framework of a Directive EU VAT, but allows Member States little flexibility in the implementation of VAT legislation
 udhaaharan ke liye, europea sangh ke bhinn sadsy deshon main, waite kii bhinn daron kii anumati di gai he
 But according to Directive 2006 / 112 the standard rate of VAT in member countries should be at least 15% and one or two reduced rates should not be less than 5%
 kuch sadsy deshon main, kuch nishchit aapurtiyon par 0% waite dar he - in sadsy deshon ne ise, EU acesan treety ke ke hisse ke rup main sweekaar kiya hoga 
 The current maximum rate in practice in the European Union is 25%, although member countries are free to set higher interest rates
 waite jise ek vyavsaay dwaara lagaaya jaataa he or iske graahakon dwaara diya jaataa he, use "output waite" kehete hai 
 The VAT paid by one business to other businesses on the supplies received is called "input VAT"
 aam taur par ek udyog us seemaa tak input waite ko waapas vasuul saktaa he jitna iske kar yogya output par input waite manaa ja saktaa he 
 Input VAT is charged by setting it opposite to the output VAT which requires the business to be in the Government account, or, if there is an excess, claiming a repayment from the Government
 waite directive ke anusaar kuch vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie or kuch anya vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie lekin un aapurtiyon par waite kaa vikalp ek europea sangh ke sadsy desh ke adheen ho 
 The input VAT that is chargeable to free supply is not receivable, although a business can increase its prices so that the customer can effectively bear the cost of 'sticking' VAT

 The OECD responds by citing Chanchal Kumar Sharma as approving why implementing a federal VAT in India has proved difficult
 kitaab main likhaa he: "although the implementation of a broad-based federal VAT system has been regarded as the most desirable consumption tax for India since the early 1990s, such reforms will involve serious problems for the finances of regional governments
 In addition, the introduction of VAT in India in the context of the current economic reforms will prove to be the inverse dimension for India's federal system
 Has paved the way for decentralization of responsibilities, which in turn call for greater decentralization of revenue-raising power, to maintain financial accountability
 duusari ore, waite lagu karne se rajyon ko rajasav ghaataa hoga or adhik kendrikaran ke saath unki swaittata main kami hogi" Chanchal Kumar Sharma insists: "political compulsions prompted the government to present an inconsistent model of VAT" 'the Indian VAT system is incomplete' to the extent that it 'goes against the core principles of VAT'
 India seems to have a 'worthless VAT', because the reasons for which VAT receives educational support have been disregarded in the Indian style of VAT, namely: removing distortion in the movement of goods in the States; Uniformity in tax structure
 Chanchal Kumar Sharma categorically states, "local or state level taxes, such as octroi, entry tax, lease tax, labor contract tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax have not been integrated into the new governance regime which provides the basic elements of VAT Goes against that according to which there should be uniformity in the tax structure

 yah dilli ke ring maarg par aane vaala ek bas stop bhi he
 The inflammation of the bronchial mucosa located inside the lungs is called bronchitis or bronchitis
 shwaasanlee se fefdon main vaayu le jane vaali naliyon ko shwasni kehete hai
 In this, the bronchial walls become unnecessarily weak due to infection and inflammation, due to which they become balloonous or cylindrical instead of being tubular in shape
 sujan ke kaaran saamaanya se adhik balgam banataa he
 At the same time these walls become unable to push out the gathered mucus
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki shwaas kii naliyon main gadhe balgam kaa bhayankar jamaav ho jaataa he, jo naliyon main rukaawat paidaa kar detaa he
 Due to this obstruction, the lung organ attached to the tubes is severely damaged and destroyed or shrinks into a balloon

 The combined result of all this is that the damaged lungs and respiratory tract do not perform their work smoothly and various types of complications arise in the patient's body
 shvasanishoth do prakaar kaa hota he
 It can be acute or long term
 dono ke kaaran, lakshan or chikitsa alag-alag hai

 Some chemical, physical and living substances affect the bronchial mucosa in such a way that cough, fever, breathlessness, etc
 are produced and this condition is called acute bronchitis
 kuch vifaille dhuen, jaise yuddh gas, teevr amla ke vaashp, ammonia, gas aadi kuch jeevanu tathaa kuch rog, jaise influenza, cookerkhaansi, khasra vagairah bhi teevr shvasanishoth utpann karte hai
 By the absorption of these substances, the blood vessels of the mucosa are dilated and blood and fluid come out from them

 When the bronchial inflammation of the bronchi persists for a long time and causes other defects in the bronchus, it is called chronic bronchitis
 aisa vyavsaay, jinamein dhul, gai tathaa dhuen kaa adhik sampark hota he or kuch jeevanu is rog ke kaaran hote hai
 In this disease, there is excessive damage to the mucosa of the bronchi
 koshikaaye nasht ho jaati hai, pakshmabhika samaapt ho jate hai

 tryptophan ek carbonic yogic he
 It is an amino acid that makes up protein
 modulan ek weveform ke sambandh main duusare weveform se alag karne kii prakriya he
 In telecommunications, modulation is used to send a message, but a composer uses it to separate the volume, timing or timing, and accentuation of an instrument's tone for vocal harmony
 aksar ucch aavruti sinusoid weveform kaa istemaal lo-frequency sanket ke karier sanket ke rup main hota he
 There are three major parameters of a sine wave - its own amplitude, its phase and its frequency, all of these communication signals can be modified based on low frequency to obtain a modulated signal
 jo upkaran adhimishran ko anjaam detaa he modulator kehalaata he or jo upkaran vipareet kriya karata he demodulator kehalaata he
 The device that can do both types of tasks is called a modem
 ankiy adhimishran kaa uddeshy ankiy bit stream ko ek anuroop pasband channel main sthaanantaran karnaa he, udhaahranswaroop; saarvajanik switchd telephone network,, yaa ek simit radio frequency band par sthaanantaran karnaa he
 The purpose of analog modulation is to transfer an analog baseband signal, for example to transfer an audio signal or TV signal to an analog passband channel, another example is to limit the radio frequency band or cable TV network channel
 anuroop or ankiy adhimishran frequency divijan multiplexing, ko aasaan banaata he, jabaki isi ke saath kai lo-paas soochna sanket kaa sthaanantaran ek saajhe bhautik madhyam se alag pasband channelon kaa upyog kar ke jariye hota he
 Digital baseband modulation systems, also called line coding, also aim to transfer a baseband channel over a digital bit stream via a serial bus or wire-connected local area network such as a non-filter-copper wire
 pulse adhimishran pranali kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket ko sthaanantarit karnaa he, udhaahranswarup phone kol kaa wideband besaband channel par aana, yaa kuch yojanaon main beet stream kaa ek duusare ankiy transmishan system main aana
 In analog modulation, the modulation on the analog information signal is continuous
 saamaanya anuroop adhimishran takanic nimna prakaar ke hote hai : In digital modulation, the analog carrier signal is modulated by a digital bit flow
 ankiy adhimishran paddati main ankiy se anuroop roopantaran ho saktaa he or demodyulation yaa ditection main anuroop se ankiy main roopantaran ho saktaa he
 Changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of m option symbols
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan : ek telephone line ko shravan yogya dhwani ko sthanantarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ek tone ko len, yah ankiy bits nahin he
 This is why computers can connect to the telephone via modems, which represent digital bits by tones, called symbols
 agar vahaan chaar vikalp ke pratik hai, pehla pratik bit seqvence 00 kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isi tarah doosraa 01 ko, teesraa 10 or chauthaa 11
 agar kisi modem main 1000 tone prati second vaala sangeet bajataa he, to iskaa pratik dar 1000 pratik / prati second, yaa bod hoga
 chunki is udhaaharan main harek tone do ankiy bits vaala ek massej kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, isliye bit dar pratik dar kaa duguna yani 2000 bits prati second hota he
 According to one definition of a digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal, but in another definition, modulation is also called the conversion from digital to analog
 zyaadaatar pathyapustakon main ankiy adhimishran skim ko ankiy transmishan ke rup main, data transmishan kaa hi paryaay maan liya gaya he, bahut kam pathyapustakon main ise anuroop transmishan kaha gaya he
 The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are as follows: QAM main, ek infez sanket or ek kshetrakalan charan aayam ek parimit sankhya main abhivyakt hoti he
 This can be seen as a two-channel system, with each channel using ASK
 parinamswaroop sanket PSK or ASK donon ke sammishran ke baraabar hota he
 In each of the above methods, each phase, frequency or amplitude is dictated by an amazing double beats pattern
 aamtaur par, harek charan frequency yaa aayam kii saamaan sankhya ke beats kaa kutalekhan karti he
 The symbol included in this number of bits is represented by a particular phase
 yadi varnmaala main m = 2 n { \ displaystyle M=2^{N}} vaikalpik pratik ke rup main shaamil he to harek pratik n bits ke sandesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If the symbol rate f s { \ displaystyle f_ {S}} is the symbol per second, the data rate is n f s { \ displaystyle Nf_ {S}} beats per second
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varnmaala jisame 16 vaikalpik pratik hai, harek pratik 4 bits kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Therefore the data rate will be four times the baud rate
 PSK, ASK yaa QAM, jahaan adhimishrit sanket kii carrier frequency sthir he vahaan adhimishran varnmaala aksar aasaani se raashi rekhachitr kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, harek sanket ke liye aayam ke i sanket ko x-axis or q sanket ko y-axis dwaara darshata he
 PSK and ASK using the principle of QAM, but sometimes FSK are also frequently generated and detected
 i or q sanket ko jatil-maan sanket i +jq main joda ja saktaa he
 Consequently the actual value known as the equivalent low-pass signal or the equivalent baseband signal is the complex signal physical value representing the complex value
 modulator dwaara data sanchaarit ke liye upyogi nimnlikhit saamaanya kadam hai : The de-modulator usually performs the following on behalf of the receiver: sabhi ankiy sanchaar vyavastha main yah aam he ki modulator or di-modulator donon kaa dizin ek hi saath kiya janaa chahie
 ankiy adhimishran yojanaayen sambhav hai kyonki preshak-praapak donon pakshon ko pehle se jaankaree honi chahie ki kis tarah data kaa kutalekhan kiya jaae or sanchaar vyavastha kaa kaise pratinidhitiv kiya jaae
 sabhi ankiy sanchaar pranaaliyon main, preshak ke aaparivartak or praapak ke di-modulator donon ko is tarah banaaya jaay ki apane kaam ke alaava ek-duusare kaa bhi kaam kar saken
 In the incompatible modulation method, a receiver does not need the reference clock signal that occurs in the same phase with the sender carrier wave
 In such a case, the modulation moves asynchronously in the signal

 ek suryoday ke dauraan, aglaa dopaher ke dauraan or suryaast ke dauraan 
 Each time it is known by a different name - morning in the morning, midday in the afternoon and evening in the evening
 shivaprasad bhattacharya ise “hinduon kii pujan paddati sambandhi samhita” ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 The word is a composite word in Sanskrit in which Sandhya means "union"
 jiskaa din or raat kii sandhi yaa milan kinwa sangam se aashay he or vandan kaa arth pujan se hota he
 Apart from morning and evening, the afternoon is considered to be the third confluence of the day
 isliye un sabhi samayon main dainik dhyaan or prarthana kii jaati he
 The word Sandhya itself is also used in the sense of daily ritual, which is meant to be performed during the beginning and end of the day
 vedon kii richaon tathaa shlokon ke aadhaar par aavahan aadi karke gayatri mantra kaa 28, 32, 54 yaa 108 baar jaap karnaa sandhyopasana kaa abhinn ang he 
 In addition to the mantra, the Sandhya ritual has some other purifying and preparatory rituals to prevent thoughts from wandering and to focus attention

 In addition, one of the most important rituals of Sandhyavandan is worshiping Sun in the morning and Varuna in the evening as Mitra Dev
 iske alaava, brahmachariyon ke liye sandhyavandan kii samaapti par havan karnaa or samidhadaan karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Other aspects of worship that are not primarily involved in Sandhyavandana include the chanting of meditation mantras and the worship of deities by worshipers

 The evening has a special place in Hinduism because it leads to mental purification

 In this entire world, those who have deviated from their karma, they need evening
 sandhya karne vaale paparahit ho jate hai
 The sins committed by ignorance are eliminated by treaty

 Evening has been determined in the scriptures, according to which the Sandhyopasana results

 According to the sages, the daily pact without the sun and stars is the evening
 ahoratrasya yaa sandhih suryanakshatravarjita
 Sa tu sanyasamakhya mainta munistastadarsiddhibhi: 
 And with stars in the morning, in the mid-day when the sun is in the center of the sky and in the evening before sunset, it is causal
 praatah kaa jap suryoday tak tathaa saayam kaa jap nakshatron ke udai tak kerani chaiye
 Evening can be done in front of the house, goshala, nadihat and idol of God, but its results are different in the scriptures
 apane ghar main sandhya karne se ek, goshaala main karne se sau, nadi ke tat par lakh tathaa ishwar ke murti ke sameep karne se anant guna fal miltaa he

 The idea of creating atms in the field of retail banking originated and developed in Japan, Sweden, USA and England
 haalanki sabase pehle iskaa prayog kahaan shuru hua yah abhi tay nahin ho paaya he
 Moute Maur, London and New York are the first to mention its use
 1960 ke dashak main ise bainkograph ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 According to some claims, Citibank was first commissioned in 1961 by New York City to serve customers
 vaise graahakon ne tab ise asweekrut kar diya tha

 Due to these, customers have to face many problems
 mashin se kabhi nakli note nikal aate hai to kabhi bina note nikle hi nikaale gaye rupayon kii khaali raseed baahar dikhaa detii he
 The possible reason for this is believed to be the use of Chinese computer technology in banks
 iske alaava haal kii kuch ghatnaon se atm mashin ko hi chori kar le jane kii ghatnaayen sunai di hai
 Due to these, the alarm of robbery or robbery is not ringing, or if the wire of the machine is cut, the control room is not able to get the news etc
 atm mashin marammat ke liye khuli hone kii sthiti main switch ke saath apana sampark tod detii he
 At such a time, the necessary repair of the machine is done in front of the bank officer or ATM vendor
 parantu atm mashiinon kii chest yaa tijori khuli hone kii dasha main bhi ye mashine switch ko jhootha sandesh dete hue aanaline rahati hai
 That is, it is possible that the machine would take the thief and the switch would not even know the news
 kai baar kisi atm mashin se nakli note nikal padate hai or bank inaki koi jimmedaari lene ko taiyaar nahin hota
 Many times when an ATM machine shows money withdrawn from the account, but the cash does not come out of the machine or rarely withdraws
 aisi shikayaton ke liye graahak bank main poochtacha karte hai to bank apane kaal centre kaa number thama dete hai
 It is difficult at first to get the line of this call center being run on the toll free number and even if found, the customer would not get relief despite half an hour of conversation
 saamanyat: kaal centre graahakon ko bina maange shikaayat sankhya tak uplabdh nahin karaate
 If the customer is suffering from mental stress by taking the complaint number, it is better to go to the bank and withdraw your money from the check and be free from these problems

 Cases of bank employees' involvement in hacking and password theft are also now open

 There is neither any mechanical nor any software in order to not supply the second currency from the 100, 500 and 1000 compartments available in the machine
 is drushti se ye mashine banking ke liye surakshit nahin maani ja sakati
 The system of correcting incorrect payment entries is also not effective
 kabhi mashin aawaaj karti rahati he, paisa baahar nahin nikalataa or atm hang ho jaataa he
 Sometimes this amount is received by another customer spontaneously because the amount is stuck in the middle and the ATM suddenly starts working
 kabhi graahak kii yahi raashi atm main nakadi, kaagaj yaa riban feed karne vaali company ke logon ke haath bhi lag jaati he
 Cashing in atms in the name of maintenance of ATM machines, cleaning the ATM premises twice a day, airconditioning, zero downing of ATM machines, security visible and invisible cameras, every operation of ATM Slip out, door shut so that one customer stays in the ATM at a time, adequate lighting at night, guard for security, etc
