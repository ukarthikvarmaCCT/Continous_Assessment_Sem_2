 According to Charanview's commentary, Gautam was the head of a department of Samaveda's Ranayani branch
 * The Gautam Dharmasutra has only three questions
 pratham tathaa dwitiya prashn main nau–nau adhyay tathaa tritiy prashn main das adhyay hai
 Thus the entire Gautama Dharmasutra is divided into 28 chapters, which contains a Sahasra Sutra
 yah granth keval gadhy main he tathaa sabhi dharmasutron main pracheenatam he
 The scriptures of the Vedas are quoted in the form of this book
 yadhyapi in sutron main yajurveda ke mantra bhi uddhrut hai tathaapi is granth kaa sambandh samaveda se mana jaataa he, kyonki isamen na keval samaveda ke anek vishyon ko hi grahan kar liya gaya he, apitu samaveda ke kai sookhton kaa nirdesh bhi he
 Also, in the eighth chapter of the third question of this book, many sutras are quoted from the Brahmana, the Samveda of Samaveda
 isi prakaar tritiy prashnptr ke pratham adhyay ke barahawein sutara main samaveda ke nau mantron kaa nirdesh he
 The sutras of the first chapter of the first question are the 52nd and the 8th sutra of the seventh chapter of the third question mentions five Mahayahritiyas
 in vyahritiyon kaa sambandh bhi samaveda se hi he
 On the basis of these evidences, the relation of Gautama Dharmasutra is clear with Samaveda

 kane ne gautam dharmasutra kaa sambandh gautamakalp se mana he, kintu saath hi unhone isaki swatantra rachana kaa mat bhi pratipaadit kiya he
 * samay samay par gautam dharmasutra main prakshep bhi hote rahe hai
 This has often happened with many texts
 gautam dharmasutra bhi iskaa apwaad nahin he
 It can be said in evidence that in the Buddhist Dharmasutra, it is quoted from the name of Gautama that the Brahmin should not accept Kshatriya's instinct
 * kintu vartmaan gautam dharmasutra main yah mat uplabdh nahin hota, apitu iske sthaan par yah kaha gaya he ki aaptkaal main brahman kshatriya tathaa vaisya kii vritti ko bhi apana saktaa he
 * Similarly, in the Vasistha Dharmasutra, the idea has been expressed by the name of Gautam that if someone dies in a yathagni yatra, then his or her effigy should be revived by the effigy of the grass, but there is no such formula in the present Gautama Dharmasutra
 gautam dharmasutra main anek paath–bhed bhi uplabdh hote hai tathaa kai pandulipiyon main karmvipak par ek puraa prakaran jod diya gaya, jis par hardutt kii vyakhya nahin he
 Based on these evidences, the scholars believe that there have been many changes in the Gautam Dharmasutra from time to time
 kundalaal sharma ji kaa vichaar haih– 'is prakaar ke paath–bhed yaa prakshep kumaril se purv hi kiye gaye the kyonki 'tantra vaarthtik'* main is prakaar ke pathbhedon kii charchaa kii gai he
 Many sutras of this composition cited in Mitakshara, Smritichandrika and other texts are not available in the current editions
 ' The period of Gautama Dharmasutra is believed to be before 400–600 BC
 is avadharana main hetu yah he ki anek granthon main gautam kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 Which automatically proves that Gautama Dharmasutra precedes them
 isi prakaar gautam dharmasutra main bhi anya sahitya kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 Therefore, this sutra book has to be considered as the latter from that literature
 donon paksh is prakaar hai– Gautama Dharmasutra does not mention the name of any Dharmasutra, but only by the words 'ityke', 'ekashaam', 'AK', the mentors preceding it have been mentioned in it
 gautam dharmasutra* main manu ke naam se ek mat diya gaya he
 While explaining Gautam Dharmasutra, Muskari has given many examples from Manusmriti in confirmation of his interpretation
 shodhakon ne gautam dharmasutra matha manusmriti ke padon main 500 se adhik samanthaayen khoj leen hai to bhi isse yah siddh nahin hota ki vartmaan manusmriti gautam dharmasutra kaa mukhya strot he
 In the * Gautama Dharmasutra *, the veda-vedang by saying 'lokvedvedavangvitta' and in the * 'vakovakyayitha Puraanakushal', Puranas etc
 have also been discussed
 saath hi gautam dharmasutra* main upanishad–veydant aadi kaa ullekh bhi kiya he
 * Similarly 2–2–28 also has hints towards nirukta *
 * in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra in granthon main se parvarti prathit hota he
 Gautama is mentioned twice in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 * samaveda ke shrautasutra latyayan* evam drahyayan* bhi gautam ko uddhrut karte hai
 The Samvediya Gobhilagrihyasutra * also considers the Gautama Dharmasutra to be authentic
 vasishtha dharmasutra* main gautam ko uddhrut kiya gaya he
 The 19th chapter of Gautama Dharmasutra is in the form of the 22nd chapter in the Vasistha Dharmasutra
 manusmriti* main gautam ko utathy kaa putr kaha gaya he tathaa yajyavlky–smriti main* gautam kii gananaa dharamshastron main kii gai he
 Shankaracharya has quoted Gautama Dharmasutra * in vedantasutra-bhasya *
 * in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra in rachanaaon ke pashchaat tehraata he
 Dr

 In conclusion, Gautama Dharmasutra was composed in 600 BC

 Generally, all religions are represented by human personal and social ethics and duties
 gautam dharmasutra main bhi inke sambandh main vishad vivechan kiya gaya he
 Like other Dharmasutras, the rules of Varna and Ashrams and the daily Dharmakrutis of Varnas have been enacted mainly in Gautam Dharmasutra
 varnashram–vyavastha ko gautam dharmasutra atyant mahatv pradaan karata he, yahan tak ki isamen varnashram se hin, apavitra tathaa patiton ke saath sambhaashan kaa bhi nishedh he
 As a brahmachari, grihastha, Vaikhanas and monk, Gautama divided human life into four ashrams and detailed the duties of the four ashrams
 gautam grihasthashram ko mahatv dete hai, kyonki sabhi ashram isi ke ashrith hai
 Gautama considers Sanyasashram to be important as Angrat monks of other ashrams
 vanprastha yaa vaikhanas grihasth tathaa sanyas ke bich kii kadi he
 Gautama has considered in detail about the Kartavyaadi of all those ashrams
 ashram–vyavastha ke antargat gautam ne atithi–satkar ko bahut mahatv diya he
 According to Gautam Dharmasutra * the sannyas should also do guest service and the householder should be 'devapitrimanushyapujakapujak'
 duhkhi, rogi, nirdhan or vidhyaarthee kii sahaayta karnaa grihasth kaa param dharm he
 He should feed himself by giving food to guest, child, patient, woman, old man, servants
 grihasth–dharm ke paalnarth gautam ne paanch mahayagyon kaa vidhaan kiya he
 * Along with this, many rules have also been made for the purity of this religion
 ashram–dharm ke prasang main gautam dharmasutra main dayaa, kshamaa, paranindarahitya aadi maanviya gunon par bal diya gaya he
 Along with these qualities, the law of giving donations has also been done here, but according to Gautam Dharmasutra *, donations should be given according to the qualification of the character
 gautam kaa satyabhaashan tathaa satya aacharan par bahut bal he
 It is mandatory for all
 isiilie satya bhaashan ko mahaan tap kaha gaya he
 Speaking of truth has also been said to achieve heaven and false speech as hell
 in gunon ke saath manushya ko ahimsak, mridu, sahishnu, kshamashil bhi hona chahie
 In this way, an effort has been made to make personal and social life superior in Gautam Dharmasutra
 iske saath gautam yah bhi jaanate hai ki vyakti apni swaabhaavik kamazori ke kaaran kupath main pravrutt ho jaataa he
 Sometimes immorality pervades the whole society, but if diligently done, these weaknesses can be delayed
 isliye gautam dharmasutra main dand swaroop anek prakaar ke praayashchatton kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jinase vyakti shuddh hokar punah shreshth jivan vyateet kar saktaa he
 Meat-eating is also mentioned somewhere in this book, but it appears to be projectile
 gautam dharmasutra main ashram–vyavastha ke saath varna–vyavastha par bhi paryaapt prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In this context, Brahmin has been given the paramount position
 brahman, kshatriya, vaisya tathaa shudra ke rup main chaaron varnon ke karttavya evam adhikaron kaa yahan acha vivechan kiya gaya he
 For the smooth functioning of varna system, only the upper caste marriage has been recognized
 yadi koi asavarna vivaah karata he to uski santaan varnsankar kehalaaegi
 It has also been said here that the varnasankar child, which lasts continuously for seven generations, also becomes an excellent varna or inferior varna on the basis of their own works
 praayshchitt, aparaadh, dand, mrityu tathaa janmavishyak ashauch bhi varnanusaar hi nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 Probably the Brahmin must have been kept free from the shackles due to his scholarship and best conduct
 isliye gautam dharmasutra* main ‘tadpekshastadvrittih’ kaha gaya he
 The position of the Shudras does not appear to be good in the Gautama Dharmasutra
 unke liye dharmik sanskaar vihit nahin hai tathaa keval grihasthashram hi unke liye vihit he
 This religion of Shudra has been told to serve the people of higher varna
 gautam dharmasutra main nari ko paryaapt mahatv diya gaya he, kyonki vah santaan kii janani he
 He has been called the best teacher
 yadhyapi gruhasambandhi tathaa dharmik kaaryon main gruhinee tathaa sahdharmini ke rup main vah pratishthit pad par asin he tathaapi use dharm ke vishay main aswatantra kaha he
 Marriage of a girl is subject to the parents, but if they do not marry the girl on time, then she can marry a suitable young man herself
 stri ke liye pativraty dharm anivaary he
 She should not even think about anyone other than her husband
 aniatik yon sambandhon ke liye kathortam dand kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, the following form of woman is visible as a maid
 ek sutara* main to yahan tak kah diya gaya ki daasi yadi kisi purush ke paas bandhak rakhi gai he to vah uskaa upbhog kar saktaa he
 The justification of this statement has been given by the commentator of Gautam Dharmasutra Harddatta, by saying that how long can a person keep restraint on the consumables kept near him? This statement of Haradatta violates the limits of morality
 kaaran kuch bhi ho, yah sthiti samaaj kii hin avasthaa kii suchak he
 The state-law is also highlighted in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 gautam* ke anusaar pranimaatr kii raksha karnaa tathaa nyaaypurvak dand dekar praja ko supath main rakhana raja kaa karttavya he
 The king performs the king work with the help of a scholar and virtuous Brahmin
 dharmasutron main raja nirankush nahin he
 The process of his justice is also democratic
 rajya main brahman dharm kaa vidhaan karne vaala tathaa raja uskaa paalan karaane vaala he
 * Thus a very co-ordinate public order has been rendered in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke praayah sabhi prakaar ke karttavyon kaa nirdhaaran karke samaaj ko sahi disha dene kaa praytn yahan par kiya gaya he jisase samaaj unnati kar sake tathaa logon main prem, nyaay, dayaa, paroapkaar aadi gunon kii vruddhi ho
 In short, Gautam, through his Dharmasutra, has tried to control the entire society from moral and social point of view

 There are three types
 α, β,  Dentistry is that branch of health care which is concerned with the shape, functioning, defense and improvement of the inner part of the mouth and teeth etc
 and the interconnection of these organs and body

 In this way the area of dentistry is almost as large as that of eye or dermatologist

 The dentist's business is independent organized and is an important department of healthcare

 Due to the increasing complications of dentistry, many characteristics have arisen in it, just as in general medicine
 isaki kuch shakhaayen neeche varnit hai : It is a branch of dentistry that includes malformations or other damage to the jaw or malformations and diseases of the internal parts of the mouth, such as the teeth, jaws, and the development of nearby structures that can be surgically corrected
 mukhchikitsak ke kshetra main fate taalu ko band karnaa, kate hont ko taankna or baahar se ghuse padaarthon ko nikaalnaa aadi sabhi sanmilit hai
 This is the branch of dentistry that deals with the installation of artificial teeth in place of human teeth and its associated parts
 iske antargat nakli dantasamooh, shalya dwaara rikt sthanon main daant lagaana, khandit daanton ko thik karnaa, dantamulon par daant baithaana, sethu bananaa or daant sajaana aate hai

 There is a huge shortage of dentists and their assistants in India
 swasthya sanghathan or swasthya paristhitiyon ke sangrakshan ke liye sarkaar ne bhor samiti niyukt kii thi
 His report was presented in 1946 AD
 uski sanstuti he ki 5,000 vyaktiyon ke peeche ek dantachikitsak avashya hona chahie, yadhyapi paashchaatya deshon main 3,000 vyaktiyon ke peeche kam se kam ek dantachikitsak paramaavashyak samajha jaataa he
 According to the recommendation of the Bhor Committee, 75,000 dentists will be required in 30-35 years
 falat: is kaal main kam se kam dhai hajaar dantachikitsak prati varsh prashikshit karne padenge
 This is possible only when 25 dental schools are opened, in which 100 students are admitted every year
 is samay 4,00,000 vyaktiyon ke peeche keval ek dantachikitsak he
 In New Zealand, there was a shortage of dentists like this before, and this was met through the training of dental care attendants
 unka prashikshan do varsh tak hota tha
 Their minimum qualification was to pass the high school examination
 in paricharikaon main itani yogyata aa jaati thi ki ve dantachikitsa kii saralatam kriyaayein kar saken
 Most of the time of ordinary dentist takes these simple actions
 inamen vishesh nipunata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Many high school passers in India remain idle
 unamem se kai ek is kaam ko sugamawa se sikh sakate hai
 Once trained, they can work as assistants in hospitals and dental schools under the supervision of qualified dentists
 aise vyaktiyon ko "dantarakshak" kaha ja saktaa he
 They can be trained at government expense and a contract can be written that they will work for five to ten years
 sanstuti kii gai he ki teen prakaar ke vyakti prashikshit kiye jaayan : Dentists dantarakshak Dentist dantachikitsakon kaa prashikshan ayurvegyanik tathaa dantavidhyalayon main ho or shesh vyaktiyon kaa prashikshan keval dantavidhyalayon me
 a recommendation of the Bhor committee is that dental education should be of the same level in all places
 yah kaaryrup main parinat kar di gai he
 Some recommendations were for a title called MDS
 unhen dhire dhire avasar ke anusaar kaaryrup main parinat kiya ja saktaa he
 Recommendations regarding dental legislation have been accepted and the Dentists Act has been approved

 It is also possible that the word 'golden' has been applied in view of the rich status of this Khanat
 'urdu' shabd mongol bhashaa main 'mahal', 'kheme' yaa 'mukhyalay' ke liye ek shabd hua karata tha
 In Turkish languages, there was a word similar to 'orta' which meant 'side', 'department' or 'direction'

 About two percent of men and women suffer from this disorder

 In this case, either it can be faced silently or any treatment can be resorted to to get rid of it

 Many feel that he has suffered a heart attack and runs to the hospital
 kuch log aise hote hai jo charam bhay kaa anubhav karne par bhi use nakaarna chaahate hai
 However, the story is almost the same
 asaliyat main ve sabhi santras ke dauron ke shikaar ho jate hai jise aap chahen to santras vikaar bhi kah sakate hai
 The panic attacks were once marginalized as 'excitement' or tension, but today it is considered a condition that cripples the person in every way

 Possibly there is a genetic cause

 The fear caused by seizures is often so high that the quality of life begins to be affected and the man is also incapable of his daily functioning
 santrasgrast log duusari pareshaaniyon main bhi ulajh sakate hai
 They become addicted to alcohol and start taking drugs
 inke adhyayanon se spasht hua he ki aise logo main avsaad or aatmahatya kii pravriti bhi adhik dikhaai detii he

 Over time, panic attacks also become associated with certain environment-related events, which increase stress and anxiety
 aisa bhay kii anubhuti kaa kaaran vigat yaa vartmaan ke anubhav athwa manovaigyanik dwandv bhi ho saktaa he
 The conditions of such special conflict arise from the ghosts buried in the mind and the sad thoughts, emotions or aspirations of the present
 kabhi-kabhi to koi spasht kaaran bhi nahin hota or vyakti sirf tanaav kii pratikriya ke rup main santras anubhav karata he
 In this way, the reaction of disillusionment is the condition of activating your inner capacity and facing any external shock or apprehension on yourself
 kuch manovaigyanikon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki bachapan ke shuruuaati daur main khaas logon jaise mata-pita se bichhoh ke kaaran baad main santras ke vikaar se peedit hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he

 Differentiation of beings is due to their environment and accordingly their lifespan
 is siddhant ke anusaar sabhi praaniyon ko keval do vibhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 One is the Adyamukhi and the other the second in donon shakhaon ko sharkrumivarg sambandhit karata he
 This proves that primordial in the development of animals should be first and then second
 dwitiyamukhi se sabhi prishthvanshiyon kaa vikaas hua
 Most animals have male and female isolates
 nar shukranu srijan karte hai tathaa maadaa andey detii he
 a child is born by the combination of these two
 parantu nimna shrenee ke bahut se praani aise bhi hote hai jinamein nar or maadaa main koi prabhed nahin hota or ve shukranu athwa andey nahin dete
 Their growth is caused by bifurcation, or germination, or spore formation of the entire body
 inase kuch adhik unnat praaniyon main do aise praani thode samay ke liye sanyukt hote hai or uske pashchaat pun: vibhaajan dwaara vansh kii vruddhi karte hai
 Even in these more advanced beings, it is seen that two separate beings are completely united with each other and they do not remain separate entities
 aise sanyog ke pashchaat phir vibhaajan tathaa khandan dwaara vansh kii vruddhi hoti he
 Such animals belong to a single cell whose entire body is made up of only one shell
 par inamen kuch aise bhi hote hai jo ucch shrenee ke praaniyon kii bhanti shukranu tathaa andon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai or in donon ke sanyog ke pashchaat pun: khandan tathaa vibhaajan kriya prachlit hoti he
 The growth of the unicellular body, being a single cell, only increases the volume of the cell
 parantu nackoshin praaniyon main sharir kii vruddhi kramshil hoti he
 In this early growing stage they are called embryos and they undergo a lot of change before attaining perfection
 bhrun bhi praarambhik avasthaa main ek hi kosh kaa hota he, yadhyapi yah do vibhinn koshon, shukranu tathaa andey, kii sanyuktavastha he, jise yugmaj kehete hai
 This zygote is formed by penetrating successively, but its affinity with unicellular is that the split cells do not become isolated
 in nae koshon kii pragati ore nirupan do bhij paddatiyon par hote hai
 In some beings, the future of these new shells is determined at a very early period, which determines the organs they will create
 is paddati ko visheshit vibhinnata athwa kuttimochitra vikaas kehete hai
 By dividing such a divisible egg into two equal parts, each block can make only half of that animal
 duusari paddati main angon kaa nirdhaaran prathamvastha main nahin hota or aise andon kaa do bhaagon main vibhaajan karne se yadhyapi ve aaytan main chote ho jate hai, tathpi prayek bhaag sampurna praani ko banaata he
 Such a division system is called unsystematic or regulatory penetration
 parantu kuch avadhi ke pashchaat inamen bhi koshon kaa bhavishya pratham paddati kii bhanti nirdhaarit ho jaataa he or us samay andon kaa vibhaajan karne par praani purnang nahin banataa
 Generally, food is stored as eggs inside the eggs
 vardhansheel bhrun kii pushti pitak se hoti rahati he
 There are mainly three types of distribution of Pitaka within the egg
 pratham main pitak kii maatra bahut kam hoti he ore vah saare andey main samaan rup se vistrut rahata he
 Such eggs are called appellate
 duusare prakaar main pitak kii maatra bahut adhik hoti he ore vah andey ke nimnabhaag main ekatrit rahata he
 Such an egg is said to drink alone
 tisare prakaar main pitak andey ke madhya bhaag main sthit rahata he
 Such eggs are called centerpieces
 pitak kii maatra tathaa uski sthiti ke anusaar andey kaa vibhaajan bhinn--bhinn prakaar kaa hota he
 Pitak is a hindrance to the division action
 apiti andey sampurna rup se vibhajit hote hai
 Such partition system is called complete discrimination
 parantu ekat: piti andon main pitak ke neeche kii ore ekatrit hone ke kaaran andey kaa upree bhaag shuddh tathaa sakriy rahata he or vibhaajan kriya keval upree bhaag main aabaddh rahati he
 The lower part is not divided in the initial period
 aisi aanshik vibhaajan pranali ko apurna bhedan kehete hai
 Where the victim lives in the center of the egg, the division action remains only at the periphery
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko uparishthabhedan kehete hai
 In most eggs, the active upper part and the relatively inactive lower part are already visible - the upper part is called zoological pole and the lower part is called vaginal or vaginal pole
 andon kaa vibhaajan vibhinn prakaar kii samamitiyon ke anusaar vibhijh hota he
 In bipartite symmetry, the first dividing line is like a stripe of melon, which results in the formation of two shells
 inhen donon koshon se sharir ke dakshin or vam parshv kii sristi hoti hai
 The two sides divide equally
 trijya samamiti kii visheshta yah he ki vibhaajan rekhaayen sadaa ek duusare ko urdhwadhar rekhaon dwaara katati hai or aksh ke chaaron ore samaan rup se koshon kii vruddhi hoti he
 Apart from this, there is also a third way in which the dividing line curves and once in a sequence, tilts to the right and second time to the left
 aisi pranali ko kuntal bhedan kehete hai, par inkaa antim parinaam dwiparshv samamiti hoti he
 In bivar symmetry, the first division is bipartite, but after that the practice of triangular symmetry prevails in both sides
 vibhaajan kriya teevr gati se hoti he--koshon kii sankhya badhati jaati he, par aaytan main ve chote hote jate hai
 Finally, a multicellular embryo is formed which is called monocyte
 nae kosh sab is gole kii paridhi par hote hai or bich main lasika se bharaa ek vivar rahata he
 This cavity is called Ekabhiktika cavity
 aisi khokhli ekabhiktika ko guhiy ekabhiktika kehete hai
 Its outer wall has only a single shell depth
 ekat: piti andon main neeche kii ore pitak ke sanchay ke kaaran ekabhiktika guha upar kii ore banati he
 The division is only over the egg, where the quantity of the vitellus is high
 aabaddh rahata he or ekabhiktika guha bahut hi sankshipt rup main banati he
 This type of monologue is called bimbakabhiktika
 jin andon main pitak madhyasthal main rahata he unamem vibhaajan keval paridhi main hota he
 Such a monologue is called paribhakabhiktika
 kuch praaniyon main ekabhiktika thos hoti he or golai ke bheetar bhi kosh bhare rahete hai
 In such a situation, Ekabhiktika is called concentric Bhiktika Bhittika Athva Tutta
 chhidrishton main ekabhiktika avasthaa main mukhadwar banataa he, is kaaran aisi ekabhiktika ko mukhekabhiktika kehete hai
 This is not the case with other animals
 jab tak ek partavaali ekabhiktika kramash: do partavaali banati he tab tak bhrun ko syutibhrun kehete hai
 The second layer is made up of many different methods
 sabase saral pranali apiti andon main hoti he
 In this, the lower part of the monolith, Varadhrirava, enters the cavity cavity respectively
 or ant main bhitari part bahari part se mil jaati he
 The unicellular cavity ceases to exist and a second cavity is formed in its place which is now covered by two layers
 is vivar main neeche kii ore ek chhidr hone ke kaaran yah khulaa rahata he
 This hole is called Adyantramukh
 syutibhrun banane kii is pranali ko antargaman athwa amboli kii pratha kehete hai
 The outer layer is called outer layer and inner layer is called inner layer
 ant:str se in praaniyon kii pachakanal tathaa usase utpann sabhi angon kaa vikaas hota he
 For this reason, the effluent from the inner level is called Adyantra
 adhiktar aprishthvanshi praaniyon main aadyantrmukh unke agrabhag kaa nirdeshak hota he or usase yaa uske nikat unka mukhadwar banataa he
 Such creatures are called primordial
 iske vipareet sabhi prishtavanshi or kuch aprishtavanshi praaniyon main aadyantrmukh praani ke pashchadbhag kaa nirdeshak hota he jahaan maladwar banataa he
 Such opposite creatures are called second jin andon main pitak adhik maatra main rahata he or ekabhiktika guha bahut sankshipt hoti he, unamem upar ke kosh teevr gati se vibhajit hote rahete he or kramash: badhate hue neeche ke pitak se bhare sthaan ke upar prasaarit hote hai
 In this way, two layers are formed at the bottom
 is pranali ko adyavriddhi kehete hai
 In Bimbacabhiktika, due to excessive vitality, new shells are formed only in the upper part and some of them are separated and fall under the first layer
 aisi pranali ko pruthkstaran kehete hai
 In addition, in some beings, the upper layer does not propagate and turns inward and the brief monologue forms a second layer below the cavity
 is pratha ko antarvalan kehete hai
 In multicellular low-grade animals, such as perforations, only two layers are formed in the inner and the congenital
 is kaaran inako dwistaripraani kehete hai
 With these two layers, their entire body and its various parts are made
 inamen visheshta yah hoti he ki sharir kaa bahari aavaran tathaa bhitari pachak-naal ek duusare ke keval ek koshvihin tantu dwaara sanlagn rahete hai jise madhyashlesh kehete hai
 In addition to these three types of beings, a third layer is formed in all the multicellular species, which is situated between the outer layer and the level
 isko madhyastar kehete hai, evam aise praaniyon ko tristari kehete hai
 The enforcement of this middle level is either from the out-level and the in-level two organizations, or only from the in-level
 pratham avasthaa main is madhyastar ko bahirmadhyastar or dwitiya avasthaa main antarmadhyastar kehete hai
 Such a middle middle level occurs only in the primordial category of beings
 dwitiyamukhi praaniyon main keval ant:madhyastar hota he
 The unorthodox beings have only the sherkarmivarga and the shalyacharm second, and the rest are primordial
 tristari praaniyon kii visheshta yah he ki madhyastar se bahari aavaran or pachakanal ke bich ek lasika se bharaa vivar banataa he, jisko dehguha kehete hai
 The outer and inner walls of this dehguha are covered with mid-level roofs
 iske atirikt madhyastar se mansapeshi, asthi, rakt, prajnanatantr tathaa utsargi ang banate hai
 There are also some three-tier creatures in which there is no dehgau and a special fiber is filled in its place which is called mooloti
 is kaaran tristari ko phir do bhaagon main baanta jaataa he---ek to sadehguha, jinamein dehguha vartmaan rahati he or duusari adehguha, jinamein dehguha kii jagah keval mooloti rahata he
 The middle level has another feature, which causes the division of the body into multiple sections in most three-tier organisms, or seen only in the inner organs
 aadyamukhi or dwitiyamukhi main dehguha kaa pravartan bhinn-bhinn prakaar se hota he
 In the adhyamukhi, the embryo is made of muscle and Yogi Ooty from the outer layer
 antarmadhyastar ke kosh bhrun ke peeche kii ore rahete hai
 These shells primarily form a solid group of cells inside the body, which are subsequently divided into two layers
 bich kaa vivar dehguha banataa he
 The dehguha made in this way is called vipahguha
 dwitiyamukhi main antarmadhyastar pehle se hi aadyantr kii upree diwaar ke donon parshvon main sannihit rahata he
 Respectively, it separates from the Adyantra and becomes the body of Dehguha
