 Chanda is commonly used in Sanskrit poetry to describe the rhythm

 Small-scale sounds, in the order of minor-master utterances, give the volume and when in a poetic composition they harmonize with an arrangement, it is given a classical name and according to the small-master volumes this letter The system starts with a specific name called Chanda, like Chaupai, Doha, Arya, Indravajra, Gayatri Chanda etc
 is prakaar kii vyavastha main maatra athwa varnon kii sankhya, viraam, gati, lay tathaa tuk aadi ke niyamon ko bhi nirdhaarit kiya gaya he jinka paalan kavi ko karnaa hota he

 pracheen kaal ke granthon main sanskrit main kai prakaar ke chand milte hai jo vaidic kaal ke jitne pracheen hai
 The verses of the Vedas are also chanted
 pingal dwaara rachit chhandashastra is vishay kaa mul granth he
 The verse is first discussed in the Rigveda
 yadi gadhy kii kasuti ‘vyakaran’ he to kavita kii kasuti ‘chhandashastra’ he
 Proper knowledge of the design is not without knowledge of the scriptures
 kavy ore chand ke prarambh main ‘agan’ arthath ‘ashubh gana’ nahin aana chahie
 The phrase employed with specific rules related to the number and order of the letters used in the sentence, quantity-calculation and Yeti-speed is called "chhand"
 chhandas shabd 'chad' dhaatu se bana he
 It has a metallic etymological meaning - 'one who walks on his own will'

 The verse plan cannot be realized in poetry without difficult practice
 chand ke nimnlikhit ang hote hai - a formula has been devised to memorize the ganas easily - Yamatarajbhansalaga

 In 2007, paleontists reported the discovery of a quill knob from Mongolia on a well-preserved Velocirapor mongoliansis cell, confirming the presence of a feather in this species
 velosiropter kii tulana main adhik pracheen drumeosaurads ke jeevashmon ko apane sharir ko cover karne vaale pankh hote hai or puri tarah se viksit pankhons vaala pankh hote hai
 The fact that the Velociraptor's ancestors were feathers and were probably capable of flight has long suggested to paleontists that velociraptors bore feathers, as even flew birds today retain their wings

 Both were willed, beaten their nests, possessed by hollow bones, and covered in feathers
 yadi velsirapter jaise jaanavar jivit the to hamaari pehali chhap hogi ki ve bahut hi asaamaanya dikhte pakshiyon the
 According to Turner and co-authors Norel and Peter Makowki, nesting boxes are not found in all prehistoric birds, and their absence does not imply that an animal did not have wings - for example, there is no quill knob however
 The appearance confirms that Velociraptor gave birth to modern-style feathers, with a rakhi and plank made by Barbus

 Turner and colleagues explained the presence of feathers on the Velociraptor as evidence against the idea that large, blow-less Manipuris lost their wings on the other side due to the sheer size

 When originally reported, it was estimated that two animals had drowned

 The burial would have been much quicker, judging from the lifelike in which the animals were preserved
 protocoratops ke kuch hisson kii yaad aa rahi he, jise anya jaanwaron dwaara safai ke sakshya ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Comparisons between velociraptors, protoceratops, and ring rings of modern birds and reptiles indicate that velocirappor may be nocturnal, while protoceratuses may be active throughout the day during inhalation, suggesting that conflict may be blurred or during low light Can be a condition of

 This suggests that valocerapore may have used the claws of its sickle to embrace vital organs of the throat, such as the tympanic vein, the carotid artery, or the trachea, rather than lowering the abdomen

 The only solid evidence for social behavior among drumaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which show six individuals of a large species moving as a group
 haalanki sahakaari shikaar kaa koi saboot nahin mila
 Although many different fossils of Valaiseirapore have been found in Mongolia, none were closely associated with other individuals
 isliye, jabaki velokirapore ko aamtaur par ek pack shikari ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jurassic park ke rup main, is siddhant ko saamaanya rup main dramiyosorcid ke liye samarthan karne ke liye keval simit jeevashm saboot uplabdh hai, or velcrorapter ke liye koi bhi vishisht nahin he pack shikaar siddhant denonichas ke kai namoonon kii ek khoj par aadhaarit tha jo ki tenontosoras ke avshesh ke aasapaas paae gaye the

 This model, known as the "raptor Hunting Restraint" model, proposes that Dramiosource has killed its prey just like the current acacid birds of prey: leaping over its mine, under its own body weight Holding, and holding it tightly with large, sickle-shaped claws

 This proposal is based primarily on the comparison between the size and shape of the numerous groups of birds of prey with known predator behaviors and the feet and legs of the prey

 Fowler and colleagues thought the jaw, being comparatively weak, would have been useful for cutting line speeds seen like a modern-day Komodo dragon, which would have a weak problem if its predators were not powerful enough to end its prey
 These frustrating adaptations to work together may also have implications for the origins of fluttering in the parabolic

 Michael Crichton in the 1993 novel Jurassic Park, directed by Steve Spielberg, and Valisierpotter for his role in the 1993 film Adaptation are known for their roles as extremely dangerous and cunning killers
 jurassic park main chitrit "raptars" vastav main nikat se sambandhit drumeosaurid dinonichas ke baad taiyaar kiye gaye the
 Both the novel and the film have paleostalost excavating a skeleton in Montana, which is far from the central Asian border of Velocirapor, but is characteristic of the Devonichus Range
 krichatan ke upanyaas main ek charitra main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki "dinonichas ko ab ek velosiropter main se ek mana jaataa he", jisamen pataa chalata he ki crickton ne gregory es paul dwaara prastaavit vivaadaaspad vargeekaran kaa istemaal kiya tha, cricktan ne dennichus, jon ostrum ke shodhakarta se mulaakaat kii, yel vishvavidhyalay main kai baar jaanwaron kii vyavhaar or upasthiti kii sambhavit shrinkhalaa ke bare main bataane ke liye
 At one point Crichton told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name in place of Devonicus because the former's name was "more dramatic"
 austrom ke mutabik, krichatan ne kaha ki upanyaas kaa velokirapore lagbhag har vivaran main devonichas par aadhaarit tha, or keval naam badal diya gaya tha
 The filmmakers of Jurassic Park also requested all of Ostrum's published letters to Dionochus during production

 Production of Jurassic Park began in 1991 before the discovery of the large drumiosaurid Utahapter, but as Jodi Duncan wrote of the discovery: "later, after we designed and built the Raptor, the Raptor Skeleton was built in Utah
 The discovery, which he labeled 'super Slasher'
 unhone sabase bada velisirapotter ko aaj tak khulaasa kiya tha - or yah hamaare jaise hi paanch saadhe feet lanbaa tha

 While these CGI effects were able to impart wings over time, the structures are not as common as modern-day drum wings or the wings of modern wings such as fully developed arm wings
 koran, quran yaa koran islam kii pavithratam kitaab he or isaki neenv he
 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai
 These messages originated with Adam
 hazarat aadam islamic manyataon main sabase pehla nabi tha or isaki tulana hindu dharm ke manu se ek had tak kii ja sakati he
 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man

 In his time, the Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years, the mark of this civilization on the whole world gives its mark
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts
 udhaaharan ke taur par: "jab al-quran padhaa jaataa he, to ise sunen or chup rahen
 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai
 Each synonym has its own different meaning, but its use can be found with the Quran in some contexts
 is tarah ke shabdon main kitaab, aayah ; or sura shaamil hai
 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha
 Subsequently, he received the revelation of the complete Qur'an over a period of 23 years

 It is related that some Quraysh who were taken as prisoners in the Battle of Badr regained their independence after having taught some Muslims the simple writings of the time
 is prakaar musalamaanon kaa ek samooh dhire-dhire sakshar ban gaya
 As it was said initially, the Quran was recorded on planks, skins, bones, and wooden stems
 musalamaanon ke bich zyaadaatar sure upyog main the kyonki sunni or shiya donon sroton dwaara kai hadison or itihaas main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, mohammad ke islam ke aahvaan ke rup main quran ke upyog se sambandhit, prarthana karne or padhane ke tareeke ke rup main
 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations
 haalanki, mohammad ke aalochakon ne unhen ek vyakti, ek kavi yaa jaadugar hone kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki unke anubhav pracheen arab main aise aankadon dwaara daawa kiye gaye logon ke samaan the
 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632
 paigambar ne gadir e khumm main apana upadesh dene ke baad yah khulaasa kiya tha

 is prakaar, shastreey samooh, sabase mahatvapurn zayd bin thabit ne chand ekatra kiye or puri kitaab kaa sankalan karke kuran ko kitaab kaa rup diya tha
 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha
 To preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use the copy of Abu Bakr and produce a standard copy of the Quran
 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death
 is paath kaa kram uthman ke yug ke dauraan baad main ikattha hua tha ki is sanskaran ko kalkram kram main ekatrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran into circulation
 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran
 quran apane vartmaan rup main academik vidwaanon dwaara mohammad dwaara boli jane vaale shabdon ko record karne ke liye aam taur par mana jaataa he kyonki verient kii khoj ne bahut mahatv nahin diya he
 Professor Fred Donner of the University of Chicago stated that "


 there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonant text of the Quran, possibly a broader and more diverse set of related texts in transmission
 is manakikrut cannical paath ke nirmaan ke baad, pehle aadhikarik granthon ko dabaa diya gaya tha, or sabhi maujuuda pandulipiyon - unke kai roopon ke baavjood-is maanak vyanjan paath kii sthapana ke baad ek samay kii taarikh lagati he
 "although most version readings of the Quranic text have ceased to be broadcast, some are still
 vahaan koi mahatvapurn paath nahin hua he jis par kuranik paath kaa vidwaan punarnirmaan aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Historically, controversy over the content of the Quran has rarely become an issue, although debate on the subject continues

 pandulipi lija arabi ke praarambhik rup hijaaji lipi main likhi gai he
 This is possibly the oldest example of the Quran, but an extended date of trials is allowed, so it cannot be said with certainty which of the current versions is the oldest
 saudi vidwaan saud al-sirhaan ne tukdon kii umr main andeh vyakt kiya he kyonki unamem dots or adhyay vibhaajak shaamil hai jinhen mana jaataa he ki baad main iskaa janm hua tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran has become a book of divine guidance from God to Muhammad through Allah through Jibril and sees the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity
 islamic or kuranik sandarbhon main prakashitvaakya kaa matlab he ki ishwar kaa kaary kisi vyakti ko sambodhit karnaa, praptakartaaon kii ek badi sankhya ke liye sandesh bhejnaa
 The process through which a divine message comes to the heart of the Messenger of God is sordid or nazul
 jaisaa ki quran kahata he, "sachai ke saath hamane ise neeche bhej diya he or sachai ke saath yah neeche aa gaya he
 " quran aksar apane paath main jor detaa he ki ise ishwariya rup se niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Some verses in the Quran indicate that even Arabic-speaking people will understand the Quran if they are recited
 quran ek likhit purv-paath, "sangrakshit tablet" ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ise bhejne se pehle bhi bhagwaan ke bhaashan ko record karata he
 The issue that the Quran is eternal or created became a religious debate in the ninth century
 tark or tarksangat vichaaron ke aadhaar par dharamshastra ke ek islamic skool mutajilas ne kaha ki quran banaaya gaya tha, jabaki muslim dharmavidon kii sabase vyapak kismein quran ko ishwar ke saath sah-shaashvat maanate the or isliye akushal the
 Sufi philosophers frame this question as artificial or incorrect
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa vartmaan shabd mohammad ko pataa chalaa he, or quran 15: 9 kii unki vyakhya ke anusaar, yah bhrashtachar se sangrakshit he 
 Muslims consider the Quran a guide, a sign of Muhammad's prophecy and the truth of religion
 quran kaa anokhaapan yah vishwaas he ki quran se kisi maanviya boli yaa koi saamagree se tulana nahin ho sakati
 The Quran is considered by Muslims to be an incomparable miracle, effective until the day of Yaum al-qiyama, and thus, providing central evidence to Muhammad in the certification of his prophetic status
 quran main aprihaaryta kii avadharana utpann hoti he, jahaan paanch alag-alag chhandon main virodhiyon ko quran kii tarah kuch utpann karne ke liye chunauti di jaati he: "yadi maanav or jinn is quran kii tarah vaani paidaa karne ke liye ek saath bandha bhi jaaen to ve kabhi bhi aisa nahin kar paayenge, yadi vah aapas main kitna bhi samarthan karke dekh len
 "so the suggestion is that if there are doubts related to the divine authorship of the Quran, then come forward and create something like that
 nauveen shatabdi se, kai log or kaam dikhaai die jo quran kaa adhyayan karte the or isaki style or saamagree kii jaanch karte the
 Medieval Muslim scholars, including al-jurjani and al-baqillani, have written several texts on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran
 anya log tark dete hai ki quran main mahaan vichaar hai, aantarik arth hai, umr ke madhyam se apni taazgi banaae rakhte hai
 And through the Quran there have been major changes on a personal level and in history
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main vaigyanik jaankaree he jo aadhunik vigyaan se sahamat he
 The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran emphasizes the illiteracy of Muhammad because of how the unknown prophet would have the ability to write the Quran
 is liye yah ishwar vaani he
 The first sura of the Quran is read and repeated in Sura e Fatiha daily prayers and other occasions
 yah sura, jisamen saat chand hote hai, quran kaa sabase adhik baar padhaa jane vaala sura he: Let me start in the name of God, who is very kind to me
 All praise is for the sake of God, who is God and master; And the one who carries all the living is a great kindness; Rosé is the master of Jaza; God we pray to you and seek help from you; So, keep us on the straight path; Their path, which you have not accepted, nor their path, on which you have been thrashed and misguided
 " Other sections of the Quran are also recited in daily prayers
 quran ke likhit paath kaa sammaan kai musalamaanon dwaara dharmik vishwaas kaa ek mahatvapurn tatv he, or quran ko sammaan ke saath mana jaataa he
 56:79 Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of the Quran, some Muslims believe that they must wazoo before touching a copy of the Quran, although this idea is not universal
 puraani bosida quran kii pratiyaan kapade main lapeti jaati hai or ek surakshit jagah main adab ke saath anishchit kaal tak sangrahit kii jaati hai

 Doing this is called different types of Azhar, Sawab or Hasanah
 quran ne islamic kalaon or vishesh rup se sulekh or roshni ke tathakthith kuranik kalaon ko bhi prerit kiya
 The Quran is never decorated with pictorial images, but many Qurans are decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page or between the lines or at the beginning of the Surrey

 quran main alag-alag lambaai ke 114 adhyay hai, jinhen har prayek ko sura ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Sura is classified as Makki or Madni, depending on whether the imports were revealed before or after Muhammad's migration to Medina
 haalanki, madani ke rup main vargeekrut ek sure main makki aayat ho sakati he or iske vipareet bhi
 Sura titles derive from the name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letter or words of the surya

 Thus the Sun system is not associated with the sequence of publication
 nauveen ko chhodkar prayek surya bismillah ke saath shuru hota he, jiskaa arth arabi vaakyansh he jiskaa arth he "bhagwaan ke naam par"
 However, 114 incidents of Bismillah are still present in the Quran in Quran 27:30 as the opening of Solomon's letter to the Queen of Quran
 prayek sura main kai chand hote hai, jinhen ayat kaha jaataa he, jiskaa mul rup se bhagwaan dwaara bheja gaya "sanket" yaa "saboot" hota he
