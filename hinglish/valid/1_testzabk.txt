 The village of Golabai provides evidence of a view of the Chilika region culture in three stages: the Neolithic Age, the Tamerlan Age and the Iron Age, the King of Kalinga, was known as the "lord of the Sea"
 Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port Paloura, located close to the point of departure situated outside of the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed
 After 639, the Chinese pilgrims fa-hien and hiuen-tsang mention a famous port "che-li-ta-loching" near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands
 This port was located at ‘chhatragarh’ on the banks of Chilika Lake
 a fourth century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahhu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships
 To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea
 The deception was revealed by ships' refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town's people, who escaped with all their possessions
 Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the seat that had betrayed him
 The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake
 Archeological excavations discovered Seventh century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about 25 kimi north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake
 This gives evidence of an historic naval engagement off the coast
 a 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important center of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries
 This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia
 The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called "bali Yatra"
 In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed
 Fateh Muhammed in turn was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block
 Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and paints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects
 “gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train
 He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty
 It is because of the beauty that arrests him much”
 The lake is a tidal delta type ephemeral lake in an environment with changing climate

 Sharp changes in the direction of the coast in the north of the lake, strong winds blowing sand on the coast, long turn, the presence and absence of strong tides and river waves in various sub-regions are the reason for the development of this sea land

 The land based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side
 Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack, feed the lake
 61%) of the total fresh water inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches
 The second drainage system which is non–perennial accounts for 39% )
 The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, the Kusumi, the Janjira and the Tarimi rivers
 The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to 1

 Because of its rich biodiversity, Chilka Lake was chosen as a wetland of international importance in 1981 according to the Ramsar Manifesto, as the facts have shown: in varshon main, jhil ke paristhitiki tantra ko kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or iname se kuch khatre nimnlikhit he: The rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture of prawn has contributed significantly to the decline of the lakes fisheries and bird population
 Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions
 By 1993, the problems in Chilika were so severe that the lake was put under "the Montreux Record" as the lake was considered to have "undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action ”
 The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake's conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring
 It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programmes

 In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake's ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake's resources, set up the Chilika Development Authority
 The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter: The governing body of the Authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people’s representatives, representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members
 In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the Government of India, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA
 This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions
 An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million out of “special problem grants” recommended by the Finance Commissions
 Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million 
 a strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 ngos, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups
 In 2003, collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called Sister Wetlands
 Considering the threats faced by the lake, the National Wetlands, Mangroves and Coral Reefs Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests, bharat sarkaar, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management
 The ameliorative actions taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following
 The most effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura
 This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system
 This intervention was completed after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa
 In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out
 These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake ' s fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds
 The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 kilometers
 Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity
 Detailed results of this action can be seen in the references cited in External sources
 Other measures included: In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake
 Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to beremoved from the Montreux record
 The ecological richness of the lake is of great value in preserving the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna
 
 The Zoological Survey of India surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 species of fauna, including many rare, endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects
 The rare and threatened animal species are identified green sea turtle, dugong, Irrawaddy dolphin, blackbuck, spoon billed sandpiper, limbless skink and fishing cat
 24 mammalian species were reported
 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported
 Recent surveys revealed an overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families
 This represents about one –fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found
 Fabaceae is the most dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands
the flora is predominantly of aquatic and sub-aquatic plants
 Overall 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families have been recorded
 Fabaceae is the predominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae
 The species reported are leguminosae, poaceae, and cyperaceae; endemic cassipourea ceylanica; five species of seagrass, and more
important species identified are:

 It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country
 Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle
 White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, gray and purple herons, bharaten roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more
 Migratory water fowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Lakah, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas
 a census conducted in the winter of 1997–98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake
 In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were spotted in Nalbana Island
 On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officials counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana
 Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake
 Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake
 Nalbana means a weed covered island in the Odia language
 It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of 15
53 km 2
 The island gets completely submerged during the monsoon season
 As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is gradually exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats
 Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act
 As per the Chilika Development Authority’s updated data, 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake
 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns
 The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed
 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported
 Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including: For centuries fisher folk evolved exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake, harvested the lake in a relatively sustainable fashion and developed a large range of fishing techniques, nets and gear
 During the British Rule, in 1897–98, the fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake
 The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote
 The zamindars leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk
 With the abolition of zamindari system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen
 Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became increasingly remunerative with outside interest playing an important role
 But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen’s cooperatives challenged the order in court
 The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported
 This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated
 Butter catfish and Wallago attu are the most common type of fish found in the lake
 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important
 The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, Metapenaeus monoceros, Metapenaeus affinis and Metapenaeus dobson
 Mangrove crab is the most important commercial crab
 Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulting in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers
 Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of 1,269 mass in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be 11, 878 mass during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 during the year
 Recently, the Government of Odisha has issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery
 The Irrawaddy dolphin is the flagship species of Chilika lake
 Chilka is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Indiaand one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species
it is classified as critically endangered, in five of the six other places it is known to live
 a small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea
 Chilika fishermen say that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return towards the lake
 Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake
 After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake
 The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170
 a 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins
 Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves
 60 adults were spotted in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector
 Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents
 There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a 25 km 2 area of the lake for dolphin watching
 About 500 fishing families are involved in this business
 The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin Watching
 October – January and May – June are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum of 600–700 per day during December – January
 The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching
 Tourists pay Rs
 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip
 According to the Association, most tourists see dolphins
 Only 5% return disappointed
 Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises "dolphin-watch" for tourists
 Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists / day visit the lake
 Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year
 CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths
 They report 15 deaths in 2003-04, 11 in 2004-05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006-07
 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanised boats
 Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake
 They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities
 The Irrawaddy dolphins have a seemingly mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen
 Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets
 Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been well documented
 Nalaban Island: The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands
 It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973
 It's the heart of the park where one can seen thousands of birds descending during the migratory season
 The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again
 The vast lake harbours 225 species of fish, a wide variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants
 The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the Northern sector
 Chilka Lake is one of the best bird watching spots in India, and is also popular for fishing and angling
 Puri: This holy city is famous for the late 11th century built Jagannath temple
 The other major attraction here is the beach, from where you can witness the glorious sunrise and equally mesmerising sunset
 It’s said that a visit to Puri is incomplete without visiting Chilika Lagoon
 The Nirmaljhara Waterfall: This is an ideal place for pitching your picnic tent
 The beautiful waterfall is located nearly 12 km from Chilika Lagoon
 Satpada: This place is located at a distance of around 55 kimi from Puri, on the eastern side of the Chilika Lake
 This place is surrounded by lagoons from the three sides, which makes this place an amazing tourist spot for nature lover
 The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism
 This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake's natural resources
 The locations within the lake identified for such activity are: The lake is well connected by road to Chennai and Kolkata through National Highway No 5
 Satpara town on the eastern bank of the lake is about 50 kimi by road southwest of the city of Puri and at a distance of 100 kimi from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which is also the nearest airport
 a broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railway from Kolkata skirts along the western bank of the lake passing through Balugaon, Chilika and Rambha stations
 Within the lake precincts, Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd and the Revenue Department of the state government offer boat cruises
 Private operators also provide country boats on hire to various islands in the lake
 There are OTDC Guest houses at Barkul, Rambha, Satapada & several hotels at Balugaon
 Before entering into the Nalbana Bird Sanctuary one has to obtain an entry permit
 The entry permit has to be produced at entry / exit points, at check gates as and whenever requested by officers

 a vegetarian person does not eat meat, this includes red meat ie animal meat, prey meat, chickens, fish, crustaceans or hardy ie crab-shrimp etc
 and snail animals etc

 The American Dietetic Association and Canadian dieticians state that well-planned vegetarian diets at all stages of life are "the healthiest, sufficiently nutritious and provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases"
 According to large-scale studies, ischemic heart disease is 30% less in vegetarian men and 20% less in vegetarian women than in carnivores

 The preferred form of flight is high flying and gliding; They are relatively cumbersome in fluttering flight
 sukhi jameen par darter tej kadamon se chalate hai, santulan ke liye aksar pankh failaa lete hai thik usee tarah jaise pelican karte hai
 They want to live in the herd - sometimes about 100 birds - often combined with cranes, herons or ibis; But nests are highly territorial: despite being nesting in groups, breeder pairs - especially males - will bite any other bird that is within reach of their long necks and beaks
 The Oriental Darter is an almost endangered species
 prakritik awaason ke nasht hone ke saath-saath anya maanviya hastkshepon kaa atyadhik prayog darter kii sankhya kam hone ke pramukh kaaran hai
 Darters mainly survive by eating medium-sized fish; Sometimes they feed on other aquatic vertebrates and large vertebrate animals

 lekin kai sambhavit shikariyon ko darter ko pakadaney or isaki koshish karne ke liye behatar janaa jaataa he
 The long neck and pointed beak, as well as the "darting" system, make birds dangerous to relatively large carnivorous mammals, and instead of defending or escaping in front of an encroachment, they move towards them to attack
 ye aam taur par coloniyon main prajnan karte hai, kabhi-kabhi ye jalkaagon yaa bagulon ke saath mil jate hai

 duusari ore jaisaa ki "anhinga" kii vyutpatti kaa pramaan oooper vistaar se diya gaya he, aisa lagata he ki tupi ko america darter mana gaya he jo ek prakaar kaa ashubh shagun kaa pakshi he
 This family is very close to other families of the Suli subgroup i
e
 Phalacrocoracidi and Sulidi
 jalkaag or anhinga apane sharir or pairon ke kankal ke sandarbh main kaaphi had tak ek saamaan hote hai or sambhawatah ek hi jaise varg ke ho sakate hai
 In fact, many fossils of Anhinga were previously considered cormorant or shag
 Some earlier authors included the darter in Phalacrocoracidi as a subfamily Anhinginae but nowadays it is generally considered to be overlumping
 haalanki jis tarah jeevashm pramaan ke saath bahut acchhee tarah yah sahmati banaati he, kuch log anhingidi or phalocrocoracidy ko sanyukt rup se superfamily phalocrocoraceidia main rakhte hai
 The crosses are also united based on their morphological display behavior that agrees with phylogeny as determined by anatomical and DNA sequence data
 chunki darter main kai pradarshan vyavhaar kii kami kii tulana ganeton ke saath kii jaati he, ye sabhi cimplaysiomorphy hai jo frigatbird, tropicoard or pelikanon main nahin paae jate hai
 Like cormorants but unlike other birds, the darters use their hyoid bone to expand the gular sac in the display
 kya jodon ke ishaara karne vaale pradarshan dartron or jalkaagon kii anya sinapomorphi hai jinhen baad ke logon dwaara ek baar phir chhod diya gaya tha, yaa yah aisa karne vaale dartron or jalkaagon main swatantra rup se viksit hua tha, yah spasht nahin he
 The feather-raising performance by the male appears to be a synapomorphy of the cross; Like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies, the darters perform their wrists with their wings while raising their wings, but their alternating feathers, which they perform even before they fly, it is unique
 yah ki ve tahalne ke dauraan aksar apane faile hue pankhons se swayan ko santulit karte hai, sambhawatah dartron kii ek otepomorphi he jisaki jarurat anya suuli kii tulana main inke maansal hone ke kaaran padati he
 The cross was traditionally included in the Pelecaniformes and then in a paraphyletic group of "high-level waterbirds"
 unhen sanyukt karne vaale sambhavit lakshan jaise ki sabhi jhillidaar pair kii ungliyaan or ek nangi gular thili ko ab abhisari ke rup main janaa jaataa he or pelican jaahir taur par suuli kii tulana main saras ke kareebi sambandhi rahe hai
 Hence the Sully and Frigatebirds - and some prehistoric relatives - are increasingly distinguishable as Phalacrocoresiformes
 dartron kii chaar jivit prajatiyon kii pahchaan kii jaati he, sabhi anhinga jinas main aate hai, haalanki old world ko ek baar aksar e
 melanogaster kii upaprajatiyon ke rup main ek saath rakhaa jaataa tha
 They can form a superspecies in reference to the more typical American darter
 marishas or austrailia ke vilupt dartaron ko keval haddiyon se janaa jaataa he jinhen anhinga naanaa or anhinga parvaa ke rup main varnit kiya gaya tha
 But in fact these long-tailed cormorants may have been related to the short and speckled cormorant that should have been called the microcarbo Africanus nanus - ironically, the Latin word nanus means "dwarf"
 The "anhinga laticeps" of the last Pleistocene period are not much different from the Australian darter; It may have been a massive paleosubspace of the last ice age
 anhingidi ke jeevashm record apekshaakrit saghan hai lekin pehle se bahut hi apomorphic hai or aisa lagata he ki iske aadhaar main kami he
 Other families housed in Phalacrocoraciformes appear chronologically throughout the Eocene period, the most distinct being - frigatebirds - known from about 50 Ma and possibly of Paleocene origin
 jeevashm ganet ko madhya-eosin kaal se janaa jaataa he or uske kuch hi samay baad jeevashm jalkaag prakat hote hai, ek vishisht link ke rup main darter kaa mul sambhawatah 40-50 maa ke aasapaas, shaayad isse kuch pehle rahaa tha
 Fossil Anhingidae have been known since the early Miocene period; Many prehistoric darters like these, as well as a few more distinct generations that have become extinct nowadays, are still described as living
 vividhta dakshin america main sabase zyada thi or isliye yah sambhav he ki is parivaar kii utpatti vahaan hui thi
 Some generations that eventually became extinct were much larger, and their tendency to be flightless has been referred to as prehistoric darters
 unki vishistataa par andeh kiya gaya he, lekin yah sambhavit "anhinga" freleyi ke maikranhinga ke apekshaakrit samaan hone ke kaaran he, naa ki unki jivit prajatiyon ke saath samanta ke kaaran
 Prehistoric members of Anhinga probably spread in the same climate as today, extending from relatively warm Europe to relatively cold Miocene
 apane kaaphi damakham or mahadwipiya vistaar kii kshamtaaon ke kaaran, choti prajatiya 20 maa se adhik tak jivit rahi thim
 As evidenced by the biogeography of fossil species centered around the equator, in which the young species expanded eastward beyond the Americas, it appears that the Hadley cell was a major factor in the success and survival of this genus
 sumatra ke ek chote peliosin phalocrocoraciform, protoplotus ko puraane samay main praarambhik darter mana jaataa tha
 However it is also placed in its own family protoplotidi and may be close to a basal member of the cross and / or common ancestor of cormorants and darters

 Subhash Chandra Bose, who is also known as Netaji, was the pioneer and most leader of India's freedom struggle
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan, angrezon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye, unhone japan ke sahyog se azaad hind fouj kaa gathan kiya tha
 The slogan of Jai Hind given by him has become the national slogan of India
 "tum mujhe khun do main tumhe aazaadee duungaa" kaa naaraa bhi unka tha jo us samay atyadhik prachlan main aayaa
 Some historians believe that when Netaji tried to get help from Japan and Germany, the British government ordered his spies to end them in 1941
 netaa ji ne 5 july 1943 ko singapore ke toun haal ke saamne 'supreme commander' ke rup main sena ko sambodhit karte hue "dilli chalo!" kaa naaraa diya or japani sena ke saath milakar british va kamanwealth sena se burma sahit imphal or kohima main ek saath jamkar morcha liya
 On October 21, 1943, Subhash Bose, as the supreme commander of the Azad Hind Fauj, formed a temporary government of independent India, which was recognized by Germany, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Italy, Manchuko and Ireland
 japan ne andaman va nicobar dweep is asthaayee sarkaar ko de diye

 While his martyrdom day is celebrated every year on August 18 in Japan, his family members living in India still believe that Subhash did not die in 1945

 If this is not the case, why has the Indian government not yet made documents related to his death public? 16 janvari 2014 ko kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang vaali janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh diya
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha

 Of all his brothers, Subhash was most fond of Sharad Chandra

 Subhash used to call him Mejda

 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination

 49veen bengal regiment main bhartee ke liye unhone pariksha di kintu ankhen kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen sena ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Somehow he got admission in the Scottish Church College, but the mind was asking to join the army
 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921
 ek patr deshvandhu chittaranjan das ko likhaa
 But soon after getting the letter from his mother Prabhavati that "father, family members or anything else, they are proud of their son's decision
" " subhash june 1921 main maansik evam naitik vigyaan main trypass kii degree ke saath swadesh waapas laut aaye
 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the

 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention

 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition

 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India

 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
