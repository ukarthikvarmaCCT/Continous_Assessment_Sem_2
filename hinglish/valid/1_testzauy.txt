 The importance of dredging becomes clear from the fact that the construction of the Suez Canal was possible only after the removal of 30,000,000 tonnes of sand by dredging
 talkarshan ke liye jo mashine prayukt hoti hai, unhen nikarshak yaa jhamayantra kehete hai
 Substances are extracted and arranged from these machines under water
 talkarshan kaa mul vichaar, jamaa padaarthon ko kisi tarah ke jhaam se pakadakar, uthaane ke yantra dwaara pani ke upar nikaalnaa he
 Work is accomplished in a variety of ways
 talkarshan mashine saadharantaya tairte jalayanon par chadhaai jaati hai
 Although machines on the coast also come in handy, their movement is relatively low
 talkarshan kaary lagaataar ek ikai kriya ke rup main, yaa teen alag alag viraami kriyaaon-utkhanan, utthapan or vyavastha-ke rup main ho saktaa he
 The excavated material is called waste soil

 anya padaarthon kaa talkarshan adhik kathin hota he
 It is somewhat difficult to remove loose materials like clay from this device
 anya kuch padaarthon main jhaam ke pravesh se hi kathinaayee hoti he tathaa kuch main unke vistaar ke kaaran bahudhaa kathinaayee kaa anubhav hota he
 It is also necessary to pay attention to the circumstances under which the work is to be done while constructing a jhamedyant sagargami jalayaan jahajanuma or swayampranodith hote hai or unki rachana aisi hoti he ki ve adhik pratibal sah saken tathaa samudrayatra ke upyukt hon
 Interstitial vessels are buccanum or pipanuma and often lack propulsion machinery
 aantarasthaleey jhamayantra kabhi kabhi alag khandon main banaae jate he, jisase ve jahaajon main saralata se laade ja saken
 Many casks are tied together and machines and equipment are mounted on them
 nikle hue padaarth kii vyavastha kii bhi vibhinn vidhiyaan hoti hai
 The immovable ventilator removes excess soil in the lateral barge, or on the river or the seaside, directly or through long drains or drains
 dolwale jhamayatron main jahaaj par hi bane vishisht prakaar se nirmit dol main phaltu mitti sidhe pad jaati he
 When it is full, they take it to the sea or any other place of discharge and discharge their burden there
 aantarasthaleey jhamayantra achal hote hai, kintu sagargami jhamayantra kaary evam paristhiti ke anusaar chal yaa achal ho sakate hai
 There is such a system in the Dolwale Jhamyantra that it works in both the stages
 baaltee-seedhi-jhamayantra, chushan-dravchaalit jhamayantra jhukaau jhaam, pakad jhaam, khurachna jhaam, ityadi buniyadi kism ke jhaamon or vibhinn sahaayak mashiinon kaa prayog talkarshan main hota he
 These machines mound the material without lifting it to the surface and thus help in dredging
 ek seedhinuma dhaanchaa jalayaan adhirachana ke upree chor se latakaaya jaataa he, jo jahaaj se aarambh hokar pani ke tal tak pahunchataa he
 With this, a continuous series of buckets hangs
 baltiyon ko jalayaan ke khol main sthit ek dwaar uthaa yaa giraakar, yah seedhi abhisht oonchaai tak giraayi yaa uthaai ja sakati he
 When the buckets descend, then they dig in the floor, collect the material and, upon coming up and the bucket overturning, put all the stuffed into the drain
 phaltu mitti jalayaan ke khaane yaa dol main aati he, yaa parshv yaa tat par khadey vajaron main gir padati he
 The suction principle is used to lift the material above the surface of the water in this type of jam
 hawaband chushan nal kaa ek sira tal main utaara jaataa he or doosraa sira ek apkendri pump se joda jaataa he
 In the shell of this pump, a fan or internator cruises at a very fast speed

 The upper end of the suction tube is attached to the center
 bahari vayumandaleey daab is nirvaat ko bharne kii koshish karata he, jisase pani chushnanal ke nichle sire se upar chadhataa he
 While climbing up the water disturbs the materials around it and some part of the solid rises up in this action
 tal ke kathor or saghan padaarthon ko todane ke liye kabhi kabhi chushnanal ke saath kaatane kii kal bhi lagi hoti he
 By this arrangement, the substances are cut and become smaller
 isse aisi taralata aa jaati he ki thos or pani nal main uth jate hai
 This jham has proved to be very useful in sand, gravel, alluvial deposits and soil free of stones larger than eight inches in diameter and other blockages
 saath main nikalanevaale bahut se pani ko baahar phenkane kii kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye praaia: ek lambii pipe line jhaam se judi hoti he, jisamen hokar phaltu mitti tat par kisi nishchit sthaan par le jaakar failaa di jaati he or vahaan se pani bah jane par yah mitti bhoomi par baith jaati he
 Thus this jhaam is used to fill the marshy land

 The vessel anchors are firmly fastened
 jalayaan kaa jal aalamb se is prakaar swatantra rakhkar, gahari khudaai kii pratikriyaaon kaa pratikaar kiya jaataa he
 To remove hard materials, there is an arrangement of teeth of the desired size, from which materials can be dug and removed
 phir, jalayaan yaa parshv main sthit bajre main phaltu mitti kaa dher lagaate hai
 If the arms are longer, then piles of surplus soil can be planted directly on the banks of the river
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : The CP bucket consists of two jams, which are closed at the bottom like CP balves
 jhaamon ke sire par kabja laga rahata he
 The open bucket is dropped into the floor and it levies on both valves and digs the material under its own weight due to the action
 kraine jab uthte lagata he, baaltee swayan band ho jaati he
 Opening the closure, the post bucket opens and removes the inner substance
 charasa jhaam golardhakaar hota he or teen yaa chaar chote chote tribhujaakar khandon main banta hota he
 The CP bucket is particularly useful in collecting fractal rock blocks
 charasa jhamayantra main, jhulati hui balli se, ek jhaam lataka rahata he
 The front rope is drawn towards the jhama yantra and holds the rope behind at such an angle that by rolling the jhaam forward it can dig up the soil
 donon rassiyaan tani rakhte hue, jhaam bhar jane par balli tak upar uthaa liya jaataa he
 The ball rotates all around and upon loosening the rope the flag opens and a pile of surplus soil falls down
 yah bahumoolya dhaatuon ko nikaalane ke liye he or yah seedhi jhamayantra kaa hi ek rup he
 To remove the tin, the specialty of the plexus is that the soil is filled in a cylindrical revolving sieve, causing it to crumble, and the heavy metal-mixed clay escapes through the holes into the distribution box
 bade padaarth is baks kii chaalani se nikalakar prishth bhaag ke upar se vaahak patte dwaara nikal jate hai
 Then a lot of water is taken from the drains and shaken a lot by machines
 isse baari dhaatuen baith jaati hai or halake padaarth pani main nilambit rah jate hai, jinhen jahaaj par se baahar nikaal diya jaat he
 The work done by a jharyantra is measured by the amount of material excavated at a given time
 yah vividh prakaar ke yatron se or jhamayantron ke, kaarysthal par nirbhar he
 The choice of the plant depends on the working area, operating conditions, the type of material to be dug and the value of the plant and the expense of its care, etc
 vividh jhamayantron ke kuch pramukh lakshan is prakaar hai- Considering everything, it can be said that dredging is very efficient and drainage mainly depends on the efficiency of the operators of the jhayantra

 shukr kaa thodaa chota aakaar bataata he, iske gahare aantarik bhaag main dabaav prithvi se kaaphi kam hai
 The major difference between these two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong for underwater abduction to make it less viscous
 iske parinamswaroop grah se garmi kii kami kam ho jaati he, ise thanda karne se rokatii he or aantarik rup se jenerate kiye gaye chumbakeey kshetra kii kami ke liye sambhavit spashtikaran pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Despite this, Venus may lose its internal heat intermittently in major restructuring events
 shukr kaa vayumandal atyant ghanaa he, jo mukhya rup se carbon dioxide or nitrogen kii ek choti maatra se milakar bana he
 The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of the Earth's atmosphere, while the pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth's surface pressure - this pressure is equal to the pressure of a kilometer close to the Earth's oceans

 This makes the surface of Venus more hot than Mercury
 budh kaa nunatam satahi taapmaana −220 °C or adhiktam satahi taapmaana 420 °C he
 Mercury receives only 25% of solar radiation, despite the planet Venus being twice as close to the Sun
 praayah shukr kii sataha naarkeey rup main varnit he
 This temperature is also higher than the temperature used to achieve sterilization
 adhyayanon ne bataaya he ki shukr kaa vaataavaran haal kii tulana main arabon saal pehle prithvi kii tarah bahut zyada tha or vahaan sataha par taral pani kii paryaapt maatra rahi ho sakati he
 However, after a period ranging from 60 million to several billion years, the evaporation of the original water caused a runaway greenhouse effect, which produced a significant level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there
 However, the superficial situation on the planet is not a long guest for any earth-like life, which may have been before this event
 yah sambhaavna ki ek rahane yogya duusari jagah nichle or madhyam badal paraton main maujud he, shukr ab bhi daud se baahar nahin hua he
 Thermal inertia and heat transfer by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that Venus's surface temperature does not vary significantly between night and day sides, despite that the planet's rotation is extremely slow
 sataha par hawaaen dhimi hai, prati ghante kuch hi kilometre kii duuri chalati he, lekin shukr ke sataha par vaataavaran ke ucch ghanatv kii vajah se, ve avarodhon ke khilaaf ullekhneey maatra kaa bal daalati he or sataha bhar main dhul or chote pattharon kaa parivahan karti he
 This alone would have made it difficult for the human to walk, otherwise heat, pressure and lack of oxygen were not a problem
 saghan CO2 parat ke upar ghaney badal hai jo mukhya rup se sulfur dioxide or salphurik amla kii buundon se milakar bane he
 These clouds reflect and disperse about 90% of the sunlight that falls back on them in space and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface
 badalon ke sthaayee aavaran kaa arth he ki bhale hi shukr grah prithvi kii tulana main surya se najadik he, par shukr kii sataha acchhee tarah se tapi nahin he
 The powerful winds of 300 km / h at the top of the clouds revolve around the planet every four to five Earth days
 shukr kii hawaaen uski ghurnan ke 60 gune tak gatisheel he, jabaki prithvi kii sabase tej hawaaen ghurnan gati kii keval 10% se 20% hai
 The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal, maintaining a constant temperature not only between day and night but also between the equator and the poles
 grah kaa alp aksheeya jhukaav bhi mausami taapmaana vividhta ko kam karata he
 Significant variation in temperature is found only with altitude
 1995 main, magelan jaanch ne ucchtam parvat shikhar ke sheersh par ek atyadhik pratibimbit padaarth kaa chithran kiya jo sthaliy barf ke saath ek majboot samanta thi
 This substance is arguably made from a similar process to ice, albeit at much higher temperatures
 sataha par ghulansheel karne ke liye bahut asthir, yah gas ke rup main ucch oonchai ko thanda karne ke liye gulab, jahaan yah varsha ke rup main gir gaya
 The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation leads from elemental tellurium to sulfide

 Lightning has been disputed ever since the first suspicious shower was detected by the Soviet Venera Probe
 2006-07 main venus express ne spasht rup se whistler mod tarangon kaa pataa lagaaya, jo bijli kaa chinhak he
 Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity

 In 2007, the Venus Express probe discovered that a massive double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole of the planet
 2011 main venus express prob dwaara ek anya khoj kii gai or vah he, shukr ke vaataavaran kii oonchai main ek ozon parat maujuud he
 On 29 January 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus flows outward, which is similar in the sense that "a comet was observed to be bombarded by a comet under similar conditions"
 " In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus' magnetic field much weaker than that of Earth
 yah chumbakeey kshetra ek aantarik dynamo, prithvi ke andruni kor kii tarah, kii bajaay inmandal or saura vaayu ke bich ek antahkriya dwaara prerit he
 The small induced magnetic field of Venus gives the atmosphere negligible protection against cosmic radiation
 yah vikiran badal dar badal bijli nirvahan kaa parinaam ho saktaa he
 Despite the Earth being equal in size, the lack of an internal magnetic field on Venus was surprising
 It was also expected that its core holds a dynamo
 ek dynamo ko teen chizon kii zarurat hoti he: ek suchalak taral, ghurnan or sanvahan
 The core is thought to be electrically conductive, while its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show that this is sufficient for a dynamo formation
 iskaa taatpary he, dynamo gum he kyonki shukr ke kor main sanvahan kii kami he
 On Earth, convection occurs in the outer layer of the core because the bottom liquid layer is much hotter than the top
 shukr par, ek vaishvik punarsatahikaran ghatana ne plate vivartaniki ko band kar diya ho saktaa he or yah bhupatal se hokar ushma pravaah ke ghataav kaa kaaran bana
 This caused the mantle temperature to rise, leading to increased heat flow outside the core
 natijatan, ek chumbakeey kshetra chalaane ke liye koi aantarik bhudinamo uplabdh nahin he
 Instead, the thermal energy released from the core is used again and again to reheat the crust
 ek sambhaavna yah ki shukr kaa koi thos bhitari kor nahin he, yaa iskaa kor vartmaan main thanda nahin he, isliye kor kaa puraa taral hissaa lagbhag ek hi taapmaana par he
 Another possibility is that its core is already completely frozen
 kor kii avasthaa gandhak ke sandran par atyadhik nirbhar he, jo philhal agyaat he
 The weak magnetic casing around Venus means the solar wind makes direct contact with the planet's outer atmosphere
 yahaan, hydrogen va oxigen ke aayan parabangnee vikiran se nikle tatasth anuon ke viyojan dwaara banaaye gayi he
 The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to drain from the planet's magnetic field
 is ksharan prakriya kaa parinaam nimna-dravyaman hydrogen, helium or oxigen yanon kii haani ke rup me hoti he, jabaki ucch-dravyaman anuon, jaise ki carbon dioxide, ko usee tarah se zyada banaaye rakhane ke liye hoti he
 Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably caused the biggest loss of water during the billions of years after the planet's formation
 is ksharan ne upari vayumandal main ucch-dravyaman duterium se nimna-dravyaman hydrogen ke anupaat ko nichle vayumandal main anupaat kaa 150 guna badha diya he
 Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0
72 AU and completes one round every 224
65 days
 yadhyapi sabhi grahiy kakshaen dirghavrittiya hai, shukr kii kaksha 0
01 se kam kii ek vikendrata ke saath, vrittakar ke zyada kareeb he
 When Venus lies between the planet Earth and the Sun, this position is called inferior conjunction, which makes its reach closest to the Earth, the other planets being at an average distance of 4
1 crores
 shukr ausatan har 584 dinon main avar sangyojan par pahunchataa he
 Due to the decreasing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, this minimum distance will be maximum after tens of thousands of years

 During the period of highest decentralization, Venus can reach nearly 3
82 crore km
 soramandal ke sabhi grah surya kii parikrama ek vamavart disha main karte he, jaisaa ki surya ke uttari dhruv ke upar se dekha gaya
 Most planets also rotate in an anti-clockwise direction on their axis, but Venus rotates counterclockwise once every 243 Earth days, which is the slowest rotation period of any planet
 is prakaar ek shukr nakshatra diwas ek shukr varsh se lambey samay tak rahata he
 The equator of Venus rotates at a speed of 6
5 km / h, while the rotation at the equator of the Earth is about 1,670 km / h
 shukr kaa ghurnan 6
5 minute / shukr nakshatra diwas tak dhimaa ho gaya he, jab se magalan antariksh yaan ne 16 saal pehle uskaa daura kiya he
 Due to retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is much shorter than that of its sidereal day, which is 116
75 Earth days
 shukr kaa ek varsh lagbhag 1

 For an observer from the land of Venus, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east
 shukr grah, vibhinn ghurnan avadhi or jhukaav ke saath ek saura niharika se gathit hua ho saktaa he
 Due to tidal effects on dense atmospheres and disturbed rotational shifts induced by planetary ejection, it has reached its present position
 yah badlaav jo ki arabon varshon kii kriyavidhi uparaant ghatit hua hoga
 The rotation period of Venus probably represents a state of equilibrium that forms between the tidal tightness of the Sun's gravity that tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by the solar heating of the dense Venus atmosphere
 shukr kii kaksha or uski ghurnan avadhi ke bich ke 584-divasiy ausat antaraal kaa ek rochak pahalu yah he ki shukr kii prithvi se uttarottar najdiki pahunch kareeb-kareeb paanch shukr saura divaso ke thik baraabar he
 However, the hypothesis of a rotating-orbital resonance with the Earth has been missed
 shukr kaa koi prakritik upgrah nahin he, haalanki kshudragrah 2002 VE68 vartmaan main iske saath ek ardh kakshiya sambandh rakhata he
 Apart from this quasi satellite, it has two other floating co-orbital 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE33

 At the California Institute of Technology, 2006 studies by Alex Almy and David Stevenson on former solar systems show that Venus had at least one moon like ours that was created by a major collision event Arbo years ago
 adhyayan ke mutabik kareeb ek karod saal baad ek anya takkar ne grah kii ghurnan disha ulat di
 This caused the rotation or orbit of the Moon of Venus to slowly shrink inward until it collided with Venus and merged into it
 yadi baad kii takkaron ne chandramaa banaaye he to wein bhi usee tarah se khinch liye gaye
 An alternative explanation for the absence of satellites is the effect of powerful solar tides that can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets
 shukr kisi bhi taare kii tulana main hameshaa ujjwal he
 The most radiant, relative magnitude −4
9, occurs during the crescent phase when it is near the Earth

 Venus crosses the Earth every 584 days, orbiting the Sun
 jaisaa ki yah dikhaai detaa he, yah suryaast ke baad "sanjh kaa tara" se lekar suryoday se pehle "bhor kaa tara" tak badal jaataa he
 The inflection of Mercury, another inferior planet, reaches a maximum of only 28 ° and is often barely recognized in the twilight, while Venus is difficult to miss at its maximum radiance
 iske adhik se adhik adhiktam prasarkon kaa matlab he yah suryaast ke ekadam baad tak andhere aasmaan main najar aata he
 There is a simple misrepresentation of Venus as an "unknown flying table" as a bright point in the sky

 As Venus revolves around its orbit, in telescopic scenery it exhibits arts like the moon: in the arts of Venus, the planet presents a small "full" image when it is in the opposite direction to the Sun
 , When it is at the maximum angle from the Sun, exhibits a large "quartz art", and the night is at its maximum brightness in the sky, and as it moves between the Earth and the Sun
 Eepsth presents comes somewhere around the telescope a huge "skinny crescent" in the scenery
 shukr jab prithvi or surya ke bichobich hota he, apane sabase bade aakaar par hota he or apni "nav kala" prastut karata he
 Its atmosphere can be seen in a telescope by the aura of refracted light around the planet

 Transit Venus is found when the planet's inferior conjunction coincides with the presence in the Earth's orbital plane
 shukr ke pargaman 243 saal ke chakron main hote hai
 In the current mode of transit, the first two transits take place at an interval of eight years, then a longer break of about 105
5 years or 121
5 years, and again at the beginning of the new transit pair of eight-year intervals

 The so-called Bhasmavarna Prakash is a mystery of long-standing Venus observations
 bhasmavarn prakaash shukr ke andhkaar paksh kii ek sukshma roshni he or najar aati he jab grah arddh chandrakaar charan main hota he
 The first claim to see this light was made long back in 1643, but the existence of the light could never be reliably confirmed
 paryvekshakon ne anumaan lagaaya he, yah shukr ke vayumandal main bijli kii gatividhi se niklaa parinaam ho saktaa he, lekin yah bhraamak ho saktaa he
 This may be the result of the illusion of seeing a bright, crescent shaped object
 shukr grah ko "subah ke taare" or "shaam ke taare" donon hi roopon main pracheen sabhyataaon ne jaan liya tha
 Before the name itself, it is clear that they were two different things
 Ammisaduka's Venus table, dated 1581 BCE, shows the Greek understanding that the two objects were the same
 is patalika main shukr ko "akaash kii ujjwal rani" ke rup main nirdisht kiya gaya he or vistrut prekshanon ke saath is drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya ja sakaa he
 By the time of Pythagoras in the sixth century BCE, the Greeks had the concept of two different stars as Phosphorus and Hesperus
 romanon ne shukr ke subah kii pahalu ko lucifer ke rup main or shaam ke pahalu ko wesper ke rup main namit kiya he
 The first recorded observation of the transit of Venus coincided with Jeremiah Horrocks on 4 December 1639, along with his friend William Krebtree

 Schröter found that when the planet was a thin crescent, the bowl extended more than 180 °
 unhone sahi anumaan lagaaya ki yah ghaney vaataavaran main surya prakaash ke bikharane kii vajah se tha
 Later, when the planet was in inferior conjunction, American astronomer Chester Smith Leaman observed a full ring around its dark side and provided evidence for the atmosphere
 The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about 24 hours from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface
 By the 20th century, there was a lot more discovery about Venus
 isaki kareeb-kareeb akritiheen disk ne koi suraag nahin diya ki isaki sataha aakhir kis tarah kii ho sakati he
 More of its mysteries occurred with the development of exposure, spectroscopy, radar, and ultraviolet observations

 For Venus, like any other planet, the first robotic spacecraft mission began on 12 February 1961 with the launch of the Venera 1 probe
 soviet venera kaarykram antargat yah pehla yaan tha
 Venera 1 lost contact on the seventh day of the mission, when it was 20 million km from Earth

 The Soviet Venera 3 vehicle crashed while landing on Venus on 1 March 1966
 It was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere and hit the surface of another planet
 Even though its communication system failed, before that it was able to transmit all planetary data
 On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 successfully entered the atmosphere and deployed many scientific instruments
 Venera 4 reported the surface temperature to be about 5000 c higher than that measured by Mariner 2, and showed the atmosphere to be about 90 to 95% carbon dioxide
 Venus's atmosphere was quite dense compared to the estimates made by the creators of Venera 4
 This made the parachute slower than the scheduled landing time
 This meant the battery of the vehicle slowed down before reaching the surface
 After transmitting data up to 93 minutes, 24

 tarah-tarah ke dane The book Aryabhatiya was composed by Aryabhata I
 yah sanskrit bhashaa main aryaa chand main kavyarup main rachit ganit tathaa khagolashastra kaa granth he
 Its structure is very scientific and the language is very concise and simple
 isamen chaar adhyyon main 123 shloke hai
 Aryabhatiya starts from the Dasagitika pad
 iske chaar adhyay is prakaar hai : 1
 das-geetika-pad 2
 ganit-paad - khagoleey achar tathaa jya-sarini ; gananaaon ke liye aavashyak ganit 3
 kaal-kriya-pad - Time-division and rules for calculating the position of planets 4
 gol-paad - trikoshmetiya samasyaon ke hal ke liye niyam; grahan kii gananaa Geetikapada is the smallest, of only 13 verses, but a lot of material has been filled in it
 iske liye inhone aksharo dwaara sankshep main sankhya likhane kii swanirmit ek anokhi reeti kaa vyavhaar kiya he, jisamen vyajanno se saral sankhyaayein or swaron se shunya kii ginati suchit kii jaati thi
 For example khyughri = 43,20,000 main 2 ke liye kh likhaa gaya he or 30 ke liye y
 Both letters are written together and contain a quantity of U, which is the same as 10,000; Hence Khu means 3,20,000; The meaning of Ghrit means 4 and the meaning of r is 10,00,000, hence Ghrit means 40,00,000
 In this way, the above value of blood is obtained
 sankhya likhane kii is reeti main sabase bada dosha yah he ki yadi aksharon main thodaa sa bhi her pher ho jaay to badi baari bhul ho sakati he
 The second drawback is that if the amount of r is applied in L, its form is the same as that of the vowel, but there is a big difference in the meanings of the two
 in dosha ke hote hue bhi is pranali ke liye aryabhat kii pratibha kii prashansa kerani hi padati he
 In this, he has written many things in a few verses; Literally, the ocean is filled in Gagar
 aryabhatiy ke pratham shloke main brahm or parabrahm kii vandana he evam duusare main sankhyaon ko aksharon se suchit karne kaa dhang
 There is no serialization in these two verses, as they are in the preface
 iske baad ke shloke kii kramsankhya 1 he jisamen surya, chandramaa, prithvi, shani, guru, mangal, shukr or budh ke mahayugiya bhaganon kii sankhyaayein bataai gai hai
 One thing to note here is that Aryabhata also gave the number of rotations of the Earth in a Mahayuga, as he considered the daily rotation of the Earth
 is baat ke liye parvarti acharya brahmagupta ne inaki ninda kii he
 In the next verse, the number of planetary highs and the great epochs of the path is mentioned

 In the next seven verses, the relationship of the zodiac, fraction, art, etc
, the expansion of the sky, the magnitude of the diameter of the Earth and the diameter of the Sun, the Moon and the planets, the revolution and deflection of the planets, the locations of their addresses and scales, their dims and There is a table of values of the spheres at a difference of 3 degrees 45 arts and the magnitude of the gaps
 antim shloke main pehle kahi hui baton ke jaanane kaa fal bataaya gaya he
 In this way, Aryabhata, with his new number-writing method, has filled in many verses of astrology and trigonometry in 13 verses

 In the first verse, he has mentioned his name and has written that the book on which his treatise is based was valid in Kusumpur
 duusare shloke main sankhya likhane kii dashamalvapaddati kii ikaayiyon ke naam hai
 The shlokas next to it include square area, cube, square root, cube root, area of triangle, cube of triangular cone, area of circle, circle cube, distance and area of parallel arms from the property of the hypotenuse of trapezoidal area and area of all types
 By knowing the medium length and width, simple rules for giving area are given
 ek jagah bataaya gaya he ki paridhi ke chathe bhaag ko jya uski trigya ke samaan hoti he
 The verse states that if the diameter of the circle is 20,000 then its circumference is 62,832
 isse paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh chauthe dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh aa jaataa he
 The two verses describe the method of finding the volumes, which shows how Aryabhata made the table of the blocks
 aage vrutt, tribhuj or chaturbhuj khinchne kii reeti, samtal dharaatal ke parakhane kii reeti, urdhwadhar ke parakhane kii reet, shanku or chaaya se chhayakarn jaanane kii reeti, kisi unche sthaan par rakhe hue deepak ke prakaash ke kaaran bani hui shaku kii chaaya kii lambaai jaanane kii reeti, ek hi rekha par sthit deepak or do shankuon ke sambandh ke prashn kii gananaa karne kii reeti, samakon tribhuj ke karn or anya do bhujaaon ke virgon kaa sambandh, vrutt kii jeeva or sharon kaa sambandh, do shlokon main shrenee ganit ke kai niyam, ek shloke main ek-ek babbti hui sankhyaon ke virgon or ghanon kaa yogafal jaanane kaa niyam, 2 - = 2 k kha ; do raashiyon kaa gunanfal or antar jaanakar raashiyon ko alag-alag karne kii reeti, byaaj kii dar jaanane kaa ek niyam jo vargasamikaran kaa udhaaharan he, trairashik kaa niyam, bhinnon ko ekahar karne kii reeti, bijganit ke saral sameekaran or ek vishesh prakaar ke yugapat samikarnon par aadhaarit prashnon ko hal karne ke niyam, do grahon kaa yutikaal jaanane kaa niyam or kuttak niyam bataae gaye hai
 If all the things mentioned in thirty-three verses are written in detail according to the present-day practice, then a big heavy book can be made
 is adhyay main 25 shloke hai or yah kalvibhag or kaal ke aadhaar par kii gai jyotish sambandhi gananaa se sambandh rakhata he
 In the first two verses, the relationship of the units of time and angle is described
 aage ke chah shlokon main yoga, vyateepaat, centrebhagan or barhospaty varshon kii paribhaasha di gai he tathaa anek prakaar ke maason, varshon or yugon kaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 It is told in the ninth verse that the first half of the era is the Utsarpini and the latter is the Aasarpini period and they are considered from Chandrochha
 parantu iskaa arth samaj main nahin aata
 No commentator has interpreted it comfortably
 10wein shloke kii charchaa pehle hi aa chuki he, jisamen aryabhat ne apane janm kaa samay bataaya he
 It is further told that the calculation of yuga, year, month and day begins with Chaitra Shukla Pratipada
 aage ke 20 shlokon main grahon kii madhyam or spasht gati sambandhi niyam hai
 This is the last chapter of Aryabhatiya
 isamen 50 shloke hai
 From the first verse it appears that the point of the ecliptic which Aryabhata has considered as Aries is the spring-endpoint, because he says, the upward circle is removed from the beginning of Aries to the end of Virgo and from the beginning of Libra
 Head south to the end of Pisces
 aage ke do shlokon main bataaya gaya he ki grahon ke paat or prithvi kii chaaya kaa bhraman krantivrutt par hota he

 are visible
 paanchavaan shloke bataata he ki prithvi, grahon or nakshatron kaa aadha gola apni hi chaaya se prakashit he or aadha surya ke sanmukh hone se prakashit he
 This is not true with respect to constellations

 The Holy Qur'an teaches equality to all human beings and sets a unique example of social justice, economic justice and political justice by providing equal human rights to all
 vah insaan ko jimmedaariyon se faraar karnaa nahin sikhaata
 He teaches the worship and worship of God while taking the burden of responsibilities in the society
 vah samaaj main saare insaanon ko haq adaa karne kii talim detaa he
 He also does not accept gender discrimination
 mard or aurat jo bhi achche or bhalaai ke kaam karenge, unako puraa-puraa badla milegaa
 The woman was given the responsibility of handling the house according to her physical design, not the burden of earning on her, she is the queen of the house

 How many palaces have become ruins, because these people had come to their happiness and broke the limits of God and took the path of rebellion

 The Adigranth is the main scripture of the Sikh sect
 ise 'guru granth sahib' bhi kehete hai
 It was edited by Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji, the fifth Guru of Sikhism
 guru granth sahib ji kaa pehla prakaash 16 agast 1604 ko harimandir sahib amritsar main hua
 In Damdama Sahib in 1705, Dashmesh's father Guru Govind Singh Ji completed it by adding 116 words of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, totaling 1430 pages
 gurugranth sahib main maatr sikh guruon ke hi upadesh nahin he, varan 30 anya hindu sant or alang dharm ke muslim bhakton kii vaani bhi sammilit he
 While it speaks of Brahmin devotees like Jayadevji and Parmanandji, the representatives of castes considered hayas in the then Hindu society suffering from caste-based self-discrimination, such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Sain Ji, Saghna Ji, Chhivaji, Dhanna Speeches are also included
 paanchon vakt namaaj padhane main vishwaas rakhane vaale shaikh farid ke shloke bhi guru granth sahib main darj hai
 Guru Granth Sahib is unique in terms of its linguistic expression, philosophical, message
 isaki bhashaa kii saralata, subodhta, sateekta jahaan janamanas ko aakarshith karti he
 At the same time, the use of music notes and 31 ragas have also made the introspective esoteric spiritual teachings sweet and sobering
 guru granth sahib main ullekith darshaniktaa karmwaad ko manyata detii he
 According to Guruvani, a person gets importance only according to his deeds
 samaaj kii mukhya dhara se katkar sanyas main ishwar prapti kaa saadhan dhund rahe saadhakon ko gurugranth sahib sabak detaa he
 Although Guru Granth Sahib recognizes the importance of introspection, meditation, Guruvani opposes abandonment, inaction, inertia in the name of Sadhana
 guuruvaani ke anusaar ishwar ko praapt karne ke liye saamaajik uttardaayitv se vimukh hokar jangalon main bhatakane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 God is in our heart, he needs to find and experience in his inner heart
 guuruvaani brahmagyaan se upji atmik shakti ko lokkalyaan ke liye prayog karne kii prerana detii he
 Through sweet behavior and using polite words, every heart has been taught to win
 saanchaa:sandook sikh sampradaay The holy scripture of the Sikhs, which was stored by his fifth Guru Arjun Dev in 1604 AD, and which the Sikh Matanuayi also called 'guru Granth Sahib Ji' and honored as Guruvat
 'aadigranth' ke antargat sikhon ke pratham paanch guruon ke atirikt unke nawein guru or 14 'bhagaton' kii baniyaan aati hai
 Such a collection probably began to be prepared from the time of Guru Nanakdev and Moradhan, son of Guru Amardas, also preserved the letters of the first four gurus, which the fifth guru rearranged from him and some of the 'bhagats' Including the statements of 'bhai Gurudas', everyone got it written in Gurmukhi
 bhai bannon ne phir usee kii pratilipi kar usamen katipay anya logon kii bhi rachanaayen mila deni chaahin jo peeche sweekrut na katipay anya logon kii bhi rachanaayen govindsingh ne uskaa ek teesraa 'bid' taiyaar karaayaa jisamen, navam guru kii kritiyon ke saath-saath, swayan unke bhi ek 'salok' ko sthaan diya gaya
 Its same form is still considered present today
 isaki keval ekaadh antim rachanaaon ke vishay main hi yah kahana kathin he ki ve kab or kis prakaar jod di gai
 The first five compositions of 'granth' are famous by the names of 'japunisanu', 'sodru' Mahla 1, 'sunibra' Mahla 1, 'so Purakhu', Mahla 4 and Sohila Mahla respectively, and their 'sirairag' etc
 are divided into 31 ragas
 Come in which the compositions of the first Sikh Gurus are stored according to them
 inke ananthar bhagaton ke pad rakhe gaye hai, kintu bich-bich main kahin-kahin 'baramasa', 'thinti', 'dinarani', 'ghodian', 'siddh goshtee', 'karahale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' aadi jaisi katipay choti badi vishisht rachanaayen bhi jod di gai hai jo saadhaaran lokgeeton ke kavyprakar udaahat karti hai
 Among the posts ranked according to those ragas, the Salok Sahas Kriti, 'gatha' Mahla 5, 'phunhe' Mahla 5, Choubolane Mahla 5, Savaiya Seemukh Vakha Mahla 5 and Mudavani Mahla 5 have been ranked and a ragamala has also been given at the end of all is
 in kritiyon ke bich-bich main bhi yadi kahin kabir evam shaikh farid ke 'salok' sangruhit hai to anyatra kinhin 11 padon dwaara nirmit ve stutiyaan di gai hai jo sikh guruon kii prashansa main kahi gai hai ore jinaki sankhya bhi kam nahin he
 The compositions stored in the 'granth' seem to be somewhat different due to linguistics, mostly providing examples of harmony and uniformity
 aadigranth ko kabhi-kabhi 'gurubaani' maatr bhi kah dete hai, kintu apane bhakton kii drushti main vah sadaa shariri guruswaroop he
 Therefore, like a Guru, he is 'covered' in a high cushion under the moonlight after wearing it in clean silk clothes, pouring flowers on it, offering flowers, taking his aarti and washing his bath in front of him and paying respectfully
 kabhi-kabhi uski shobhaayatra bhi nikaali jaati he tathaa sadaa uske anusaar chalane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The texts are recited weekly and sometimes monolithically, and some of the lines are recited even when the children are christened, they are initiated and Mangalotsavs are performed or cremated
 vishisht choti badi rachanaaon ke paath ke liye praat: kaal, siankal, shayanvela jaise upyukt samay nishchit hai ore yadhyapi pramukh sangruhit rachanaaon ke vishay pradhanat: darshanik siddhant, aadhyatmik sadhana evam stutigaan se hi sambandh rakhte jaan padate hai, isamen andeh nahin ki 'aadi granth' dwaara sikhon kaa puraa dharmik jivan prabhavit he
 a collection of Guru Gobind Singh is famous as 'dasam Granth' which is different and completely different from 'adigranth'
 guru granth sahib kaa lekhan gurumukhi lipi main hua he
 The Guruvaniyan of Guru Granth Sahib is incarnated in most of the state of Punjab and due to this the common people guess their language like Punjabi; While there is no such a thing
 shri gurugranth sahib kii bhashaa aadhunik punjabi bhashaa kii apeksha hindi bhashaa ke adhik sameep he or hindi-bhashi ko punjabi bhashi kii apeksha guru-vaaniyon kaa aashay adhik bodhgamy he
 On the other hand, even though the script of Shri Dasam Granth is Gurmukhi, its language is often poetical in Hindi
 isaki bhashaa punjabi-bhashiyon ke liye or adhik duruh kintu hindi-bhashiyon ke liye bhaleebhanti jaani-pahachaani he
 The language of Guru Granth Sahib is also called 'sant Bhasha' which is a mixture of many languages, sacrifices and subbolis, in which Lhindi Punjabi, Brajbhasha, Khadi Boli, Sanskrit and Persian etc
 are prominent
