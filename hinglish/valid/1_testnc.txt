 The history of company legislation in India is linked to the company legislation of England, as the British had ruled before August 15, 1947, and had created legislations in India on the basis of their will, the basis of which has been the British legislation
 19veen shatabdi ke madhya main san 1844 i

 Similar legislation was made for India for the first time in 1850, the Joint Capital Companies Act
 is adhinium kii sabase badi kami yah thi ki isamen simit daayitv ke tatv ko manyata pradaan nahin kii gai
 In 1857, by passing the new Joint Capital Companies Act, the lack of limited liability was met to some extent
 san 1860 main nayaa company adhinium paarit kiya gaya jisamen bankig evam beemaa companiyon ko bhi simit daayitv kii chhot de di gai
 Due to the change in circumstances with time, the need for some new provisions was felt continuously in the Companies Act

 " saamaanya vyakti ke liye 'company' shabd se taatpary ek vyavsaayik sanghathan se he
 But we also know that all types of business organizations cannot technically be called 'companies'

 Apart from the limitations of personal risk, there are many other reasons that may compel a group of individuals to form a corporate center under the Act, such as acquiring technical knowledge, obtaining policies with managerial qualifications
 , Huge capital, corporate personality, transferability of shares, etc
 company adhinium kii katipay paribhaashaayen nimnlikhit hai - The requirement of this Act is to improve the management of companies and the methods of their functioning in such a way as to establish a close relationship between promoters, appropriators and managers, thereby increasing the efficiency of organization of companies, matching the performance of managers with the appropriate officers of the appropriations

 In c
 22, the Sardar Sabha of Britain stressed the existence of an independent amalgamation of Samvayas
 shri solomon naamak ek vyakti ne ek samavaay kaa sanghathan kiya or usne us samavaay ke haath apana vyavsaay 40 hajaar pound main bech diya
 Instead of taking payment, he took a fraction of 20 thousand pounds worth and 10 thousand pounds worth of debentures
 chunki adhinium main is baat kii vyavastha rahi he ki kam se kam saat vyakti milakar hi koi loksamavaay kaa sanghathan kar sakate hai isliye ek vyakti ke parivaar ke shesh chah vyaktiyon ko ansh diya jaataa
 Therefore, a Samaj controlled by a person had to see bad days and in the end it collapsed
 samaapan ke samay us samavaay kii sthiti is prakaar thi- The argument was presented on behalf of the disqualified superlatives that although the samayas have been amalgamated, the samajya has never had an independent existence
 vah samavaay kya tha, swayan solomon ek duusare naam se maujuud the
 The business was entirely his own, so how could he excel in himself

 It is difficult to understand how the corporation body thus formed by the Act loses its personality by giving most of the capital to only one person
 vidhi kii drushti main samavaay ek pruthak vyakti hota he jo gyapakapatr ke abhidaataaon se sarvatha bhinn hota he, tadnusaar solomon samavaay kaa uttamarn mana gaya or chunki vah pratibhoot uttamarn tha, usko anya uttamarnon kii apeksha praathamikta kaa adhikaar tha
 Secondly, it is the only amalgamated body that gives members the ability to do business with limited liability
 anshadaata samavaay ke rinon ke uttardaayitv ke liye baadhya nahin he
 If he does not pay his share money then he is only responsible for paying that money
 yadi uske ansh ke dhan kaa purna rup se bhugtan ho chukaa he tab uski deyta kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 Expressing its view of limited liability facility, a Justice has said that 'no other law has possibly provided the benefits of limited liability regulations for the development of the country's commercial property
 simit deyta ne, jahaan tak viniyokta tathaa lok ke laabh kaa prashn he, chote mote ghanon kii badi poonji main parinat karne main protsaahan pradaan kiya he

 The two reached out to their parents Bhavani and Shankar to pass judgment on the quarrel
 unke mata-pita ne kaha ki tum donon main jo koi is prithvi kii parikrama karke pehle yahan aa jayega, usee kaa vivaah pehle hoga
 On hearing the condition, Karthikeya ji ran to revolve around the earth

 If the received acid is to be further dehydrated, add some phosphorus pentoxide to it and shake it and re-distill the fluid
 prusik amla banane kii vyavsaayik vidhi yah he : 23% sodium cynide ke jaleey vilyan par salphurik amla kii abhikriya sise ke str lage ek janitr ke andar karte hai or is kriya dwaara praapt vaashpon ko sanghanit kar ikattha kar lete hai
 Under this action, the amount of acid is kept more than the amount of cyanide
 is prakaar praapt drav ke aanshik aswan se lagbhag 98% sandratha kaa prusik amla praapt ho jaataa he
 Similarly, it can also be obtained by replacing calcium cyanide with sodium cyanide
 germany main is amla kii kaaphi maatra, chukundar se bananevaali sharkara ke udyog main praapt shire se bhi banaate hai
 In addition to these methods, prussic acid is also obtained by synthesis

 The first method involves controlled oxidation of a mixture of hydrocarbons and ammonia
 mithen, ammonia tathaa ksigen kii alpamaatra, ke mishran ke ek tapt platinum-iridium kii jaali ke upar se pravaahit karte hai
 Prussic acid is obtained as a result of the following action: methen ke sthaan par or duusare hydrocarbon bhi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai par methen se abhikriya zyada thik hoti he
 Prussic acid can also be made by dehydration of pharimide

 But the dissociation constant of prusic acid is 1
3 V10-2, which is only the dissociation constant of organic acid
 at: spasht he ki yah bahut hi durbal amla he
 In pure state, prusic acid is a permanent substance, which can be kept in unchanged state for a long time in a glass vessel

 In this process, sufficient amount of heat is released
 saath hi ooshmaa vyavahrut karne se abhikriya kaa veg bhi badhata he
 Therefore, due to the polymerization of this substance in large quantities, there is a lot of possibility of explosion along with increase of heat
 amleey yaa jal ke saath amla paidaa kar denevaale padaarthon kii upasthiti main is amla ko sthaayeekrut banaaya ja saktaa he
 Esters of this acid cannot be made by ordinary methods
 iske liye alkil hellide yaa sulphate par sodium yaa potacium cynide kii kriya kerani padati he: In addition, alkyl cyanide can also be formed by dehydration of amides of acids, which makes it clear that these compounds are not common cyanide moles, and are also called nitriles of those acids, because their acidification gives them acid
 : prusik amla eldihidon yaa kitonon se kriya karke yogashil padaarth banaate hai or in yogicon kaa hydroxi amlon ke sanshleshan main vishesh mahatv he
 Prussic acid forms ethylene cyanhydrin from ethylene oxide, which when distilled in the presence of some catalysts extracts a molecule of water to form a compound acrylo nitrile

 Some factors such as iodine deficiency or exposure to iodine-131 increase its risk
 hypothyridism ke kai kaaran hai
 In history and currently in many developed countries, iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide
 jin vyaktiyon main iodine paryaapt maatra main hota he, unamem hypothyridism adhiktar hashimoto thairoditis ke kaaran hota he, yaa thyroid granthi kii kami ke kaaran yaa hypothelemus yaa piyush granthi main se kisi ek ke hormone kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 Hypothyroidism can also occur as a result of postpartum thyroiditis, a condition that affects about 5% of women within a year after giving birth
 pehali pravastha praroopik rup se hypothyridism hoti he
 After this, either the thyroid returns to its normal state or hypothyroidism develops in the woman

 Hypothyroidism sometimes also occurs as a result of genetics, sometimes it presents as an ineffective symptom on the alleling chromosome
 hypothyridism paaltu kutton main ek adhik saamaanya yon rog he, kuch vishisht naslon main isaki nishchit purv pravriti paayi jaati he
 Temporary hypothyroidism may be due to the Wolff – Schickoff effect
 iodine kii bahut ucch maatra kaa upyog asthaayee rup se hypothyridism ke ilaaj ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, vishesh rup se aisa apatkaaleen sthiti main kiya jaataa he
 Although iodine is a substrate for the thyroid hormone, its high levels indicate the thyroid gland to take a small amount of iodine with food, reducing hormone production
 hypothyridism ko aksar isaki utpatti ke ang ke dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: Hypothyroidism can be caused by lithium-based mood stabilizers, which are commonly used to treat bipolar disorder)
 iske atirikt, hypothyridism or manorog ke lakshanon se yukt rogiyon kaa nidaan nimna ke saath bhi kiya ja saktaa he: In adults, hypothyroidism is associated with the following symptoms: praathmik hypothyridism ke nidaan ke liye, kai doctor piyush granthi ke dwaara utpann saadhaaran rup se thyroid uddipak hormone kaa maap karte hai
 In addition, the following measurements may also be required: hypothyridism kaa upachaar thyroxin triyodothyronin ke levorotetary roopon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 The current standard treatment in thyroid therapy is levothyroxine only and according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, dehydrated thyroid hormone, combination of thyroid hormone, or triiodothyronine should not normally be used for replacement therapy
 Nevertheless, there is some controversy as to whether this treatment protocol is favorable and recent studies have produced some conflicting results

 Another study that compared synthesized T4 and dehydrated thyroid extracts showed that improvement was observed in all symptom categories when specific patients were replaced with synthesized T4 with dehydrated thyroid extracts
 haalanki, anya adhyayanon main dekha gaya ki jin logon ko sangyojan therapy di gayi or sambhavatya anaidanik hypothyridism se biimaar vyakti main, maansik kshamta or mood main kisi bhi prakaar kaa sudhaar nahin dekha gaya
 Many physicians raise issues about the use of T3 because it has a short half-life
 upanidanik hypothyridism tab hota he jab thyrotropin ke str bad jate hai lekin thyroxin or triyodothyronin ke str saamaanya rahete hai
 Another recent study investigated whether subclinical hypothyroidism may also increase the risk of heart-vascular disease, as previously stated, during which a possible modest increase was found and suggested that coronary Further studies should be done in relation to heart disease, "before any decision should be given in this matter

 sansthaanon kaa ek vivaran : The history of the establishment of Indian Institutes of Technology goes back to 1946 AD when Jogendra Singh formed a committee to establish institutions of higher education in India

 Keeping these recommendations in mind, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established in 1950 at Kharagpur, near Calcutta
 shuruyaat main yah santhaan hijli karawas main sthit tha
 On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India approved the "indian Institute of Technology Act" and declared it "an institution of national importance"
 isi tarz par anya sansthaanon kii sthapana bombai, madras, kanpur, tathaa nai dilli main hui
 Due to the student movement in Assam, the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi pledged to establish an Indian Institute of Technology in Assam as well, which resulted in the establishment of IIT in Guwahati in 1994

 Due to the fame of these institutes, every student wishing to study engineering in India has an 'ambition' to get admission in these institutes
 in sansthaanon main snaatak str kii padhai main pravesh ek sanyukt pravesh pariksha ke aadhaar par hota he
 This exam is considered very difficult and thousands of educational institutions are being run all over the country just to prepare for this exam

 The term Protist was first used in 1866 by Ernest Hetchel
 protist paaramparik rup se "ucch" rajyon ko samanta ke aadhaar par kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya: ek cell jaanavar kii tarah protojoa, paudhe kii tarah atyant dhang se sanghatit paudhe jisamen se prayek kaa ek kosh hota he or kavak kii tarah keechad kavak or pani saanchon
 in samoohon aksar overlap karte hai, ve vanshavali aadhaarit vargeekaran ke dwaara pratisthapit kiya gaya he
 However, they are still useful as informal names to describe the morphology and ecology of protists
 protist taral pani hota he ki lagbhag kisi bhi vaataavaran main rahete hai
 Many protists, such as algae, are photosynthetic and are important primary producers in ecosystems, especially in the ocean as part of plankton
 aise Kineto plastidon or Apicomplexa ke rup main anya protist, jaise malaria or neend kii beemaari ke rup main gambhir maanav rogon kii ek seemaa ke liye jimmedaar hai
 The first class of protists from other organisms came in 1820, when the German biologist George A
 Gold introduced the term protozoa to refer to organisms such as ciliates and corals
 is samooh main aise foraminifera or amoeba ke rup main sabhi "koshikeey jaanwaron", shaamil karne ke liye 1845 main vistaar kiya gaya tha
 The formal taxonomy category Protoctista was first proposed in the early 1860s John Hogg, who argues that protists should include what he saw as primitive unicellular forms of both plants and animals
 vah paudhon, jaanwaron or khanijon ke tatkaaleen paaramparik rajyon ke alaava, ek "prakruti kaa chauthaa rajya 'ke rup main Protoctista paribhaashit kiya
 The state of minerals was then removed from the classification by Ernst Hetchel, leaving plants, animals, and protists as a "state of primitive forms"
 herbert kopland "protoctista" sachmuch "pehle sthapit praaniyon" matlab unka tark he ki lagbhag ek sadi baad main hogg kaa label punerjeevit, kopland haechkel kii avadhi protista bacteria jaise anucleated rogaanuon shaamil he ki shikaayat kii
 The period protoctista Copeland did not use
 iske vipareet, kopland kaa kaarykaal aise diatem, hari shaiwal or kavak ke rup main kendrak eukeriots shaamil the
 This classification was the basis of Whittaker's later definition of fungi, Animalia, Planti, and Protista as the four states of life
 rajya protista baad eukeriotic sookshm jeevanuon ke ek samooh ke rup main protist chhodane, monera ke alag rajya main alag prokirots ko sanshodhit kiya gaya tha
 It became clear that these five states remained an accepted taxonomy until the development of Molecular Phylogenetics in the late 20th century, when Protists or Monera were a group of organisms belonging to neither
 vartmaan main, shabd protist yaa to swatantra koshikaon ke rup main maujuud he ki koshikeey eukeriots kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he, yaa ve coloniyon main hote hai, utakon main bhedbhaav nahin dikhaate
 protojoa avadhi tantu farm nahin he ki protist kii parposhi prajatiyon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 These terms are not used in the current classification and are retained only as a convenient way to refer to these organisms
 protist kaa vargeekaran abhi bhi badal rahaa he
 New classifications attempt to introduce federal groups based on fatty, biochemistry and genetics
 Protists as a whole are paraphyletic, as such systems often diverge or abandon the state, rather than separate lines of eukaryotes
 Treat protist groups as follows
 Recent scheme by ADL
 There is an example that conflicts with formal ranks and lists organisms in changed hierarchical lists
 is vargeekaran adhik lambii avadhi main sthir or adhyatan karne ke liye aasaan banane ke liye karnaa he
 Some of the main groups of protists, which can be treated as union, are listed in the taxo box on the right
 kai anischitata abhi bhi vahaan he, haalanki monophoilatic mana jaataa he
 For example, excavates are probably not monophyletic and chromalveolates are rarely monophyletic if haptophytes and cryptomonads are excluded

 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom

 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics

 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research

 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 shri khatu shyaam ji bharat desh ke rajasthan rajya ke sikar jile main ek prasiddh kasbaa he, jahaan par baba shyaam kaa vishwa vikhyath mandir he
 According to Hindu religion, Khatu Shyam ji is an incarnation of Krishna in Kali Yuga, who received a boon from Shri Krishna that he will be worshiped by his name Shyam in Kali Yuga
 shri krishna barbaric ke mahaan balidaan se kaafii prasann hue or vardaan diya ki jaise-jaise kaliyug kaa avataran hoga, tum shyaam ke naam se puuje jaaoge
 Your devotees will be saved only by a mere heartfelt pronunciation of your name
 yadi ve tumhaari sachche man or prem-bhav se puja karenge to unki sabhi manokamana purna hogi or sabhi kaary safal honge
 The unique story of Shri Shyam Baba begins in the medieval Mahabharata
 ve pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the
 He is the son of Ghatotkacha, son of the very powerful Gadadhari Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Maurvi
 balykaal se hi ve bahut vir or mahaan yoddha the
 He learned martial arts from his mother and Shri Krishna
 bhagavan shiv kii ghor tapasya karke unhen prasann kiya or teen amogh baan praapt kiye; is prakaar teen bandhari ke naam se prasiddh naam praapt kiya
 Agnidev was pleased and offered him a bow, which was able to make him victorious in the three worlds
 mahabharat kaa yuddh kauravon or pandavon ke madhya aprihaary ho gaya tha, yah samachar barbaric ko praapt hue to unki bhi yuddh main sammilit hone kii ichha jaagrit hui
 When he reached to receive blessings from his mother, the mother pledged to support the loser
 ve apane nile rang ke ghode par savaar hokar teen baan or dhanush ke saath kurushetra kii ranbhumi kii ore chal pade
 The omnipresent Shri Krishna, wearing a Brahmin disguise, stopped him to learn about Barbarika and smiled at him knowing that he had come to join the war with just three arrows; Hearing this, Barbarik replied that only one arrow is enough to defeat the enemy army and after doing so, the arrow will return to Tunir
 yadi teenon baanon ko prayog main liya gaya to puure brahmand kaa vinaash ho jayega
 Knowing this, Lord Krishna challenged him to pierce and show all the leaves of this tree
 ve donon pipal ke vriksh ke neeche khadey the
 Barbarik accepted the challenge and took out an arrow from his coat and remembered God and drove the arrow towards the leaves of the tree
 baan ne kshambhar main ped ke sabhi patton ko vedh diya or shri krishna ke pair ke ird-gird chakkar lagane laga, kyonki ek patta unhone apane pair ke neeche chupa liya tha; barbaric ne kaha ki aap apane pair ko hataa lijie anyathaa ye baan aapke pair ko bhi vedh degaa
 Subsequently, Shri Krishna asked the child Barbarik from which side he would join the war; Barbaric reiterated the promise given to his mother and said that the side which was weak and losing in the war would support itself
 shri krishna jaanate the ki yuddh main haar to kauravon kii nishchit he or is kaaran agar barbaric ne unka saath diya to parinaam galat paksh main chalaa jayega
 Therefore, Shri Krishna, a Brahmin, expressed his desire for donations from Veer Barbarik
 barbaric ne unhen vachan diya or daan maangane ko kaha
 The Brahmin asked for the donation of Shisha
 vir barbaric kshan bhar ke liye achambhit hue, parantu apane vachan se adig nahin ho sakate the
 Veer Barbarik said that an ordinary Brahmin could not ask for such a donation, so prayed to make the Brahmin aware of his actual form
 brahmanroopi shri krishna apane vaastavik rup main aa gayi
 Shri Krishna explained the reason for seeking the head donation to Barbarik that before the commencement of war, for the battleground worship, the best Kshatriya head of the three worlds has to be sacrificed; So they were compelled to do so
 barbaric ne unase prarthana kii ki ve ant tak yuddh dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Shri Krishna accepted his prayer
 shri krishna is balidaan se prasann hokar barbaric ko yuddh main sarvshereshth vir kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 His head was embellished on a hill near the battlefield; From where Barbarik could take stock of the entire war
 phalgun maah kii dwadashi ko unhone apane sheesh kaa daan diya tha is prakaar ve sheesh ke dani kahalaaye
 At the end of the Mahabharata war, there was a mutual dispute among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war? Shri Krishna said to him that the head of Barbarika is witness to the entire war, so who can be better decisive than that? Everyone agreed and walked towards the hill, after reaching there, the head of Barbarik replied that Shri Krishna is the greatest character in winning the war, his education, presence, and strategy were decisive
 unhen yubhumi main sirf unka sudarshan chakra ghumta hua dikhaayi de rahaa tha jo shatru sena ko kaat rahaa tha
 Mahakali, on Krishna's orders, was consuming blood-filled cups of the enemy army
 shri krishna vir barbaric ke mahaan balidaan se kaaphi prasann hue or vardaan diya ki kaliyug main tum shyaam naam se jane jaaoge, kyonki us yug main haare hue kaa saath dene vaala hi shyaam naam dhaaran karne main samarth he
 His head was buried in Khatu Nagar, hence he is called Khatu Shyam Baba
 ek gaay us sthaan par aakar roj apane stanon se dugdh kii dhara swatah hi baha rahi thi
 Later, after the excavation, the head appeared, which was surrendered to a Brahmin for a few days
 ek baar khatu nagar ke raja ko swapn main mandir nirmaan ke liye or vah sheesh mandir main sushobhit karne ke liye prerit kiya gaya
 Subsequently the temple was built at that place and Ekadashi of Kartik month was decorated in the Sheesh Temple, which is celebrated as Baba Shyam's birthday
 mul mandir 1027 i
 main rupasingh chouhan or unki patni narmada kanvar dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Diwan Abhay Singh of Thakur, the ruler of Marwar, renovated the temple in 1720 AD on the instruction of Thakur
 mandir is samay apane vartmaan aakaar le liya or murti garbhagrih main pratisthapit kiya gaya tha
 The idol is made of rare stone
 khatushyam pariwaron kii ek badi sankhya ke parivaar devtaa he
 Shri Khatu Shyam ji's name was Barbarik in his childhood
 unki mata, gurujan evam rishtedaar unhen isi naam se jaanate the
 The name Shyam was given to him by Krishna
 inkaa yah naam inke ghunghraale bal hone ke kaaran padaa
 His story begins in the middle Mahabharata
 khatushyam ji pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the ve atibalashali bhim ke putr ghatotkach or naag kanya hidimbi ke putr the khatushyam ji 
 Khatu Shyam ji was very strong and brave from childhood, he learned martial arts from his mother Hidimbi and Lord Krishna
 unhone bhagavan shiv kii aradhana karke bhagavan shiv se teen anokhe baan praapt kiye the 
 In this way he came to be known as Teen Bana Dhari
 agni dev ne prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiye jo unhen tino loko main vijay dilaa saktaa tha jab mahabharat kaa yuddh corwo or pandavo ke bich chal rahaa tha jab yah baat barbaric ko pataa chali to unki bhi ichha yuddh karne kii hue 
 He went to his mother and said that i also have to fight Mahabharata, then whose mother said, son, on whose behalf will you fight
 tab unhone bolaa main haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karuga 
 While he was going to war he found a Shri Krishna on the way
 unhone poocha tum kaha ja rahe ho 
 Then Barbarik told the whole thing
 shri krishna ji bole kalyug main log tumhe shyaam ke naam se jaanege | kuki kii tum haarane vaale ke saath ho | kuki barbaric kaa sheesh khatu nagar main dafnaaya gaya tha isliye unhen khatushyam ji kehete he According to the Skanda Purana, composed by sage Ved Vyasa, Mahabali Bhima and Hidimba's son Veer Ghatotkacha won the contest for the debate on the debate over Kamakantankata, daughter of King Daityaraja Moore of Pragjyotishpur
 kamkatankakata ko "morvi" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Ghatotkacha and Mata Morvi received a son Ratna, whose hair was like Babbar's lion and was named Barbarik
 ye vahi vir barbaric hai jinhen aaj log khatu ke shri shyaam, kalyug ke avatar, shyaam sarkaar, teen bandhari, sheesh ke dani, khatu naresh va anya anginat naamon se jane jate hai
 After the birth of Barbarik, Mahabali Ghatotkacha took him to Lord Krishna in Dwarka and upon seeing him, Shri Krishna said to Veer Barbarik - o son Morvey! Just like i love Ghatotkacha, similarly you also love me
 tatpashchaat vir barbaric ne shri krishna se poocha— he prabhu! is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog kya he? vir barbaric ke is nishtol prashn ko sunate hi shri krishna ne kaha— he putr, is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog, paroapkaar va nirbal kaa saathi banakar sadaiv dharm kaa saath dene se he
 For which you will have to earn strength and powers
 atev tum mahisagar kshetra main navadurga kii aradhana kar shaktiyaan arjan karo
 At the behest of Shri Krishna, child Barbarik bowed to God
 shri krishna ne unke saral hriday ko dekhakar vir barbaric ko "suhriday" naam se alankrita kiya
 After that Barbarik, having acquired all the weapons and knowledge, worshiped Navadurga for 3 years in the Mahisagar region, pleased with true devotion and austerity, Bhagwati Jagadamba appeared in front of Veer Barbarik and gave him three arrows and many powers, so that the three worlds Could be conquered
 yahan unhen "chandil" naam mila
 Maa Jagadamba was intrusted by instructing Veer Barbarik to complete the accomplishment of a Brahmin named Vijay, his supreme devotee in the same area
 jab vijay brahman kaa aagaman hua to vir barbaric ne pingal, repalendra, duhadruha tathaa nau koti mansabhakshi palasi rakshason ke janglerupi samooh ko agni kii bhanti bhasma karke unka yajna sampoorn karaayaa
 On completion of the Yagna of that Brahmin, the god-goddess Veer was very pleased with Barbarik and appeared and bestowed the illustrious powers of Yajna
 ek baar kii baat he barbaric ne prithvi or pataal ke bich raste main naag kanyaon kaa varan prastaav yah kahkar thukraa diya ki unhone aaajeevan brahmacharee rahane kaa pran liya he
 At the commencement of the Mahabharata war, Veer Barbarik expressed his desire to participate in the war in front of his mother Morvi
 tab mata ne inhen yuddh main bhaag lene kii ajna is vachan ke saath di kii tum yuddh main haarane vaale paksh kaa saath nibhaaoge
 When Veer went to participate in the Barbaric War, Lord Shri Krishna had preceded the Mahabharata war because of the low curse received by Brahma ji of his former birth and thinking that if the Veer would participate in the Barbaric war, the Kauravas would end the Mahabharata in just 18 days
 Cannot be in war and defeat of Pandavas will be sure
 aisa sochakar shri krishna ne vir barbaric kaa shirochhedan kar mahabharat yuddh se vanchit kar diya
 As he did this, a wave of mourning ran in the battlefield, 14 goddesses immediately appeared in the battlefield
 deviyon ne vir barbaric ke purv janm ko brahma ji dwaara praapt shraap kaa rahasyodghatan sabhi upasthit yoddhaon ke samaksh nimna prakaar kiya— The ladies said: "before the beginning of Dwaparyuga, distressed by the tyranny of the Moore monster, Prithvi appeared in his cow form and spoke in the House of Gods," o Gods! i am able to bear all kinds of anguish
 pahaad, nadi, naale evam samast maanav jati kaa bhaar main saharsha sahan karti hui apni dainik kriyaaon kaa sanchaalan bhalee bhanti karti rahati hoon, par moore daitya ke atyaacharon se ati du:khee hoon
 You protect me from this misdeed, i have come to your shelter
 ” Listening to the pitiful call of Gauswarupa Dhara, there was complete silence in the whole assembly
 thodi der ke maun ke pashchaat brahma ji ne kaha— “ab to isse chhutkaaraa paane kaa ek maatr upaay yahi he ki ham sabhi ko bhagavan vishnu kii sharan main chalanaa chahie or prithvi ke is sankat nivaaran hetu unase prarthana kerani chahie
 " tabhi devsabha main virajman yaksharaj suryavarcha ne apni ojasvi vaani main kaha— "he devgan! moore daitya itnaa pratapi nahin, jiskaa sanhaar keval vishnu ji hi kar saken
 We should not trouble them for everything
 aaplog yadi mujhe ajna den to main hi uskaa vadh kar saktaa hoon
 " itnaa sunate hi brahma ji bole— “nadaan! main tera parakram jaanata hoon, tumhaare ahankaar ne is devsabha ko chunauti di he
 You will surely get its punishment
 apane aap ko vishnu ji se shreshth samajhane vaale agyani! tum is devsabha se abhi prithvi par ja giroge
 You will be born in a demon's vagina and when there will be a fierce crusade on earth in the last phase of Dwaparyug only then your head will be by Lord Vishnu himself and you will be a demon forever
 " With this curse of Brahmaji, the false pride of Yaksharaj Suryavarcha also crumbled
 vah tatkaal brahma ji ke charnon main gir padaa or vinamr bhav se bolaa— “bhagwan! bhulvash nikle in shabdon ke liye mujhe kshamaa kar dijie main aapke sharnaagat hoon
 Triamam! Triamam! God save! " yah sunakar brahma ji main karun bhav umad pade, vah bole— “vatsa! tune abhimaanavash devsabha kaa apmaan kiya he, isliye main is abhishaap ko waapas nahin le saktaa hoon
 Yes, i can make amends in this that Lord Krishna himself will dissect you with his Sudarshan Chakra, your head will be attested by the ladies
 faltah tumhen kalyug main devataaon ke samaan poojaneey hone kaa vardaan swayan bhagavan shri krishna bhagwaan se praapt hoga
 " tatpashchaat bhagavan shri hari ne bhi is prakaar yaksharaj suryavarcha se kaha— Tattateteti tah praha keshav devasandi! Shiraste Pujayishyanti Devya: Pujyo Bhavishya !! bhavarth: "us samay devataaon kii sabha main shri hari ne kaha— he vir! thik he, tumhaare sheesh kii puja hogi or tum devaroop main poojit hokar prasiddhi paaoge
 " vahaan upasthit sabhi logon ko itnaa vrittant sunaakar devi chandika ne punah kaha— "apane abhishaap ko vardaan main parinti dekh yaksharaj suryavarcha us devsabha se adrishy ho gayi or kaalaantar main is prithvi lok main mahabali bhim ke putr ghatotkach evam morvi ke sansarg se barbaric ke rup main janm liya
 Therefore, all of you should not grieve over this and there is no fault of Shri Krishna in this

 Veer Barbarik told his strong desire to see the battle of Mahabharata in front of Lord Shri Krishna, which Shri Krishna completed Veer Barbarik's deity head on high mountain and got his body cremated by scripture method 


 mahabharat yuddh kii samaapti par pandavon main hi aapasi bahes chhid gayi ki yuddh main vijay kaa shrey kisko jaataa he
 Shri Krishna said that the head of Barbarik should be asked whose might he has seen in this war
 tab vir barbaric ke sheesh ne uttar diya ki yah yuddh keval bhagwaan shri krishna kii niti ke kaaran jeeta gaya he or is yuddh main keval bhagavan shri krishna kaa sudarshan chakra chal rahaa tha
 The whole constellation was raised as soon as Veera Barbaric said this and the head started to rain on the head and the Gods conned it
 tatpashchaat bhagavan shri krishna ne punah vir barbaric ke sheesh ko pranaam karte hue kaha— "he vir barbaric aap kaliyug main sarvatra poojit hokar apane sabhi bhakton ke abhisht kaary ko purna karoge
 Therefore, you should not abandon this area, please forgive the crimes that have happened to us
 " Hearing this, a wave of joy ran in the Pandava army
 sainikon ne pavitra tirthon ke jal se sheesh ko punah sinchit kiya or apni vijay dhwaja sheesh ke sameep fahraaye
 On this day, everyone celebrated the festival of Mahabharata with great pomp
 veeravar morviinandan shri barbaric kaa charitra skanda puraana ke "maheshwar khand ke antargat dwitiya upkhand 'comarik khand'" main suvistaarpurvak diya hua he
 The sage Ved Vyas ji has also praised him in this supernatural source in the 115th and 116th verses of the 66th chapter of the "kaumarika Khanda, the second subdivision of the Maheshwar Khand" in the Skanda Purana
 jab shri krishna ne unase unke sheesh kii maang kii to unhone apana sheesh bina kisi jhijak ke unako arpit kar diya or bhakt unhen sheesh ke dani ke naam se pukaarane lage
 Shri Krishna wanted to make the Pandavas victorious in the war
 barbaric pehle hi apni maan ko haare hue kaa saath dene kaa vachan de chuke the or yuddh ke pehle ek vir purush ke sir kii bhent yubhumipujan ke liye kerani thi isliye shri krishna ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Devotees believe that if something is asked from Baba, then Baba gives it millions of times, that is why he is also known as Lakhdatar
 jaisaa ki is aalekh me bataaya gaya he baba ne haarane vaale paksh kaa saath dene kaa pran liya tha, isiilie baba ko haare kaa sahaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Only because of the pledge to fight on behalf of the loser and the order from Grandmother Hidimba
 bhagwaan shri krishna kii man main uthi samasya ke kaaran hi barbaric va baba ke sheesh ko bhagwaan vasudev dwaara maanga gaya
 Because one Kuru army could not be finished before eighteen days
 tathaa anya tathy yah tha ki mahabali barbaric haare hue kamjor kii taraf se yuddh karte is liye ant main mahabali barbaric ke ilaava koi nahi bachataa
 Because from which side he fought, the front would become weak
