 saadharantaya isaki anubhuti hamen nahin hoti
 If air is removed from any part of our body, then we feel the pressure of air easily
 samudratal par vaayu ke dabaav kii maatra 760 mimi paare se daab ke tulya hoti he
 As we rise up in the air, somehow the pressure decreases
 yahan tak ki kuch pahaad ke shikharon par dabaav kii maatra prati varg inch 9 pound bhaar tak pai gai he
 Air can also be suppressed
 dabaane se uskaa dabaav bad jaataa he
 Such suppressed air is called compressed air
 dabaane kii is kriya kaa 'sampidit karnaa' kehete hai
 The volume of air is reduced by compression and the pressure increases
 is prakaar vaayu kaa dabaav kaaphi unchaa badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Compressed air is being used in a lot of work today
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works
 tathaa din din bad rahaa he
 There is no danger in its use
 yah mashiinon dwaara prayek sthaan main badi saralata se pahunchaai ja sakati he
 Some of its machines are very simple and some are complex
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog do prakaar se ho saktaa he : mashiinon main sampeedit vaayu taiyaar kar, kaamon main aisi vaayu sidhe lagaai ja sakati he, athwa sampidit vaayu silinderon main bharkar sanchit rakhi ja sakati he or aavashyaktaanusaar use bhinn-bhinn kaamon main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Compressed air receiving machines are called air compressors
 vaayu ko sampidit karne kaa sabase saral upkaran bisikil yaa motorcar ke tubon main hawa bharne kaa vaayu pump he
 However, high pressure compressed air cannot be obtained from the air pump
 adhik dabaav ke liye zatil vaayu sampidak bane hai
 Initially, they were used to make tunnels by cutting mountains with compressed air-driven drills
 peeche rail ke brikon main bhi inkaa upyog shu degree hua
 Normal air compressors produce 60 to 100 pounds of pressurized air per square inch
 aise bhi sampidak bane hai jinase hajaaron pound dabaav kii vaayu praapt ho sakati he
 The compressor has a piston inside the cylinder
 silinder ke ek chor par do valve, ek bheetar kii ore khulanevaala or doosraa baahar kii ore khulanevaala hota he
 When the piston of the cylinder is pulled to the top end, the air pressure inside the cylinder decreases and the air from the atmosphere is pulled by this valve
 jab piston ko neeche kiya jaataa he, tab dabaav ke bad jane ke kaaran andar khulanevaala valve band ho jaataa he or baahar se khulanevaala valve khul jaataa he, jisase silinder kii vaayu nikalakar "vayukaksh" main chali jaati he
 By repeating this process several times, the air pressure of the leukocyte gradually increases
 upyukt dabaav kii vaayu ko nal dwaara nikaalkar kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Air compressors can be divided into three categories: pratyaagmani vayusampidak adhik upyog main aate hai
 Their principle is the same as described above
 vaayu pump dwaara hi cycle or motor gadiyon ke tub main hawa bhari jaati he
 Tunnels can be made by drilling holes in the mountains with compressed air driven drills obtained from air compressors
 vaayu sampidak dwaara hi theatre, cinemagharon, badi badi imaaraton or khaanon main sanvathan kiya jaataa he, jisase ashuddh vaayu nikalakar uskaa sthaan shuddh vaayu le leti he
 Milling can also be done with this help
 sampidit vaayu se bade hathode chalaakar koyala, pathar, baaluu, kancreet aadi tode or pise jate hai
 Compressed air obtained from the air compressor can be riveted and iron and steel can be peeled
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se bade bade jahaajon, vayuyanon, motorkaron aadi par polish ko ja sakati he or varnish chadhaai ja sakati he
 Cleaning of houses, whitewash of walls and varnish on rangis and furniture is done at a lesser cost with the help of compressed air from air compressors
 anek saamaanon kii safai tathaa makaanon kii buharai bhi isaki sahaayta se hoti he
 Rail brakes work with compressed air force
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se anek saamaanon, jaise anaaj, koyale aadi, ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak bheja ja saktaa he
 The list of uses of compressed air is quite long
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aadhunik vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn dein he

 There are many ideas about how the word Hindo came to be
 asia or iran se hindustan aane vaale aarambhik logon kaa hindukush parvat ko paar karne ke baad isi boli ke saath sampark sthapit hua
 Since after crossing Hindukush, there was no obstruction in the way of Hindustan, hence this dialect was called Hindustan Ki Boli or Hindko
 unani logon ne hindustan ke liye indicos shabd kaa prayog kiya he or isi liye yahan kii boli kaa naam hindko pada
 Some people even say that the Iranians gave it this name
 sindh ghati ke pahaado ke madhya yaa aage-peeche yah bhashaa boli jaati thi
 In Persian, there is the word koh for the word mountain and this is what made the word Hindo
 hindko ek hind-aryaa boli he
 Sanskrit language grammarian Panini also belonged to this area

 Nowadays, like the old times, Hindus are being spoken in those places which were the place of Gandhara Rahtal

 The name of Devgupta comes in 'harshacharit' and inscriptions on the basis of which it is considered by the later Gupta kings

 The spelling of a language refers to the action of expressing words in that language with letters
 hindi main isaki aavashyaktaa kaaphi samay tak nahin samajhi jaati thi; jabaki anya kai bhashaaon, jaise angreji va urdu main iskaa mahatva tha
 In English and Urdu, spelling was repeated even half a century ago, which is still in practice today
 hindi bhashaa kaa pehla or bada gun dhvanyaatmakataa he
 It is very easy to express the sounds pronounced in Hindi
 jaisaa bolaa jaae, vaisaa hi likh jaae
 This was possible due to the versatile feature of Devanagari script and still is today
 parantu yah baat shat-pratishat ab thik nahin he
 There are many reasons for this - the effect of regional regional pronunciation, diversity, confusion, continuity of tradition, etc
 jab yah anubhav kiya jane laga ki ek hi shabd kii kai-kai vartanee milti hai to inako abhivyakt karne ke liye kisi sarthak shabd kii talash hui 
 For this reason the need for standardization was felt
 hindi shabdhsagar tathaa sankshipt hindi shabdhsagar ke praarambhik sanskarnon ke saath hi san 1950 main prakashit pramanik hindi kosh main iskaa prayog na hona yah sanket karata he ki is shatabdi ke madhya tak is shabd kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi gai
 In the sixth decade the spelling word got its place, a reference to which was found in the two books published then: pro
 shrivastav ke anusaar, hindi kii varnmaala purnatah dhvanyatmak hone ke kaaran hindi kii vartanee kii samasya utani gambhir nahin jitani angreji kii; kyonki hindi main aaj bhi likhit rup se shabd apane uccharit rup se adhik bhinn nahin
 He used the term Akshari, which could not come into vogue; Because at the same time the author fixed the use of syllable for syllabus in his doctoral treatise 'akshar' in Hindi language and 'limit of word'
 us samay tak bihar main ‘vivaran’ bengal main ‘banaan’ shabd hijje ssailing ke liye chal rahe the
 Apart from this, there were some other words in vogue - alphabet, syllable, description, character configuration, etc
 shiksha ke professor krishna gopal rastogi ne akshar vinyas shabd kaa prayog bahut samay tak kiya
 This is the character configuration
 amarkosh main lipi ke liye akshar vinyasah tathaa likhitam kaa prayog bhi paryaay ke rup main miltaa he
 Notwithstanding all the above words, 'spelling' has become valid in this sense and Central Hindi Directorate of Government of India, New Delhi has not only recognized this word, but has also established certain rules in terms of uniformity
 vartanee shabd bhi sanskrit bhashaa kaa he, jisaki vyutpattiyaan dete hue acharya nishantaketu ne ‘vartanee’ shabd ke koshgat arth bataae hai:- maarg, path, jeena, jivan or doosraa arth he: peesna, churna bananaa, takua
 The spelling was spelled first in the 'brihad Hindi Kosh' published by Gyanmandal, Varanasi
 kaaphi vivechan ke baad vartanee kii badi vyapak paribhaasha sthir kii gai: Even under the language empire, we can only call the spelling noun the syllable of letters or their disciplinary constitution in the limit of words
 xxrep 4 
 vartanee bhashaa kaa vartmaan he
 Spelling is the disciplined rotation of language, the rite of designation of spelling words
 vartanee ateet or bhavishya ke madhya kaa sethu sutara he
 This is the letter institute and alphabetical order
 acharya raghunatha prasad chaturvedi ne sanskrit vyakaran ke vaarthik se iskaa sambandh sthapit karte hue vyakt kiya
 There is a similarity between the phonetic and semantic meanings of both words and spelling
 sutara ke dwaara shabd sadhana kaa vaigyanik vishleshan hota he tathaa vaarthik main sutron dwaara trutipurna kathan par purna vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Spelling also undergoes this same parallel process
 vartanee kaa bhi samuhik vishuddh swaroop hi bhashaa kii samruddhi ke liye grahriy he
 Despite being opposed to the spelling word, Acharya Vajpayee's contribution to the upliftment of this word and Hindi spelling and word analysis are remarkable
 maanak hindi vartanee kaa kaaryakshetra kendriya hindi nideshaalay kaa he
 Many veterans have made their contribution in this direction, out of which the names of Acharya Kishori Dass Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable
 hindi bhashaa ke sangh or kuch rajyon kii rajbhasha sweekrut ho jane ke falswaroop desh ke bheetar or baahar hindi seekhney waalon kii sankhya main paryaapt vruddhi ho jane se hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karnaa aavashyak or kalochit laga, taaki hindi shabdon kii vartaneeyon main adhikadhik ekarupata laai ja sake
 Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, Government of India appointed an Expert Committee in 1961 to determine the standard method of Hindi spelling
 is samiti ne april 1962 main antim report di
 The committee had four meetings in which after serious deliberation a rule regarding spelling was laid down
 samiti ne tadnusaar, 1962 main apni antim siforishein prastut kin jo sarkaar dwaara anumodith kii gayi or antat hindi bhashaa ke maanakeekaran kii sarkari prakriya kaa shriganesh hua
 This process is continuous, but the main instructions have been decided
 ye kendriya hindi santhaan se evam bharat ke sabhi sarkari karyaalayon main prasaarit kiye gaye hai
 The institute is also working to ensure their compliance
 premchand hindi or urdu ke mahanatam bhartiya lekhakon main se ek hai
 Original name Dhanpat Rai Srivastava, Premchand is also known as Nawab Rai and Munshi Premchand
 upanyaas ke kshetra main unke yogadan ko dekhakar bengal ke vikhyath upanyaaskaar sharathchandra chattopadhyaay ne unhen upanyaas samraat kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 Premchand developed a tradition of Hindi story and novel that guided the literature of the whole century
 aagaamee ek puri peedi ko gaharaai tak prabhavit kar premchand ne sahitya kii yathartwaadee parampara kii neenv rakhi
 His writings are such a legacy of the Hindi literature without which the study of Hindi development shall be incomplete

 In the first half of the twentieth century, when there was a lack of technical facilities in Hindi, his contribution is incomparable

 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers

 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand

 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels
 premchand ek samvedansheel kathakaar hi nahin, sajag naagarik va sampadak bhi the

, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc

 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage
 paripakv avasthaa vaale kam jagah hi hai
 Only half a dozen of these can be called city
 inamen se do nagar bahut hi mahatvapurn hai - punjab kaa hadappa tathaa sindh kaa mohen jo dado 
 Both places are in present-day Pakistan
 dono ek duusare se 483 kimi dur the or sindhu nadi dwaara jude hue the
 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat
 iske atirikt rajasthan ke uttari bhaag main kalibanga tathaa haryana ke hisar jile kaa banaavali
 All these sites have views of mature and advanced Harappan culture
 sutkagendor tathaa surkotda ke samudratati nagaron main bhi is samskruti kii paripakv avasthaa dikhaai detii he
 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress
 uttar hadappa avasthaa gujarat ke kathiyawad prayadweep main rangpur or rosedi sthalon par bhi pai gai he
 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign

 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 Scholars do not agree on the reasons for its destruction

 Service collaboration has often been confused with the role of incident management, has a greater technical bias in operations and is not only related to incidents reported by users, but with developments generated and recorded by infrastructure
 ICT operations can often work with incident management and service desks to provide an 'operation bridge', which is not necessarily technical
 But operations should primarily work with documented processes and systems and be associated with a number of specific sub-processes, such as: output management, job scheduling, backup and reversion, network monitoring / management, system monitoring / management, Database monitoring / management, storage monitoring / management
 Operations are responsible for: ICT takneekee sahaayta ICT ke bheetar avasanrachana ke liye visheshgy takneekee suvidha he
 Mainly as support for other processes, technical support provides a number of specialist functions in both infrastructure management and service management: research and evaluation, market intelligence, proof of concept and pilot engineering, expert technical expertise, creation of documentation
 There are different levels of support within the ITIL structure, these are primary support level, secondary support level and tertiary support level, higher level administrators are responsible for support at primary level

 ITIL has been criticized on many fronts including the following
 jaise jine vine bon tippanee karte hai, CIO magazine columnist Dean Meyer has also presented some of itil's whimsical ideas, including five stories, "baking a Slave to Outdated Definition" and "letting ITIL Bikam Religion"
 jaise vah tippanee karata he, "


yah prakriya kii puri shrenee ko vishwastariy hone kii jarurat kaa varnan nahin karata he
 Its focus has been


 on managing ongoing services
 " Van Herwarden and Grift see that the quality of library editions is uneven
 vah tippanee karte he: "avirodh jo seva samarthan prakriyaaon kaa charitrachitran karata tha
 

 is largely missing in service books
 " In 2004, a survey designed by Noel Burton asked entities adopting ITIL to describe their actual experiences in implementing ITIL

 While ITIL addresses various aspects of service management in depth, it does not address enterprise structure in such depth
 Many of the flaws in the implementation of ITIL do not necessarily come from an error in the design or implementation of service management aspects of the business, but rather from the broader architectural framework in which the business is located

 Some shopkeepers have also included the word lean when referring to ITIL implementation, for example "lean ITIL"
 The initial outcome of an ITIL initiative increases value with the promise of profit as a future deliverable

 seva sahaayta or seva pradaan maatra kaa mishran aamator par ISO / IEC 2 xxrep 4 0 maanak ke prasar ke baraabar hota he, "BS" matlab british standard

 What we remember and what we forget depends on a lot of things
 bhashaa, drushti, shravan, pratyakshikaran, adhigam tathaa dhyaan kii tarah smriti bhi mastishk kii ek pramukh bauddhik kshamta he
 Whatever is stored in our brain in the form of experience, information and knowledge, it is all organized in various forms of memory
 maanav mastishk kii is kshamta kaa adhyayan ek kaaphi vyapak vishay vastu he
 It is mainly studied under psychology, neurology and medicine
 prastut aalekh main smriti ke vividh roopon, iske jaivik aadhaar, smriti sambandhi pramukh rog tathaa kuch pramukh smriti yuktiyon par prakaash daalaa jayega
 How does our memory work or how can we remember anything? How is memory stored in our brain? Why do we forget something and forget things
 in moolbhoot prashnon ne maanav man ko sadaa se hi andolit kiya he tathaa inke uttar dene ke samay samay par prayaas bhi kiye gaye hai
 All of us have the ability to remember old things
 ham kisi vyakti, sthaan, ghatana or sthitiyon-paristhitiyon ko yaad karte rahete hai
 Learn something from them
 phir aage unhen anubhavon or gyaan ke rup main surakshit kar lete hai
 Our further behavior is controlled by what we have learned
 prarambh main smriti kii tulana kisi bhautik sthaan se kii jaati thi or usamen sangrahit soochnaaon ko us sthaan main rakhe gaye vibhinn vastuon ke taur par dekha jaataa tha
 An example of a library can be taken to understand this analogy
 pustkaalay ek bhautik sthaan arthath sampurna smriti kaa nirupan karata he or usamen rakhi pustaken vibhinn soochnaaon kii tarah hoti hai
 This interpretation of memory was also recognized for a long time
 lekin baad main tark ke aadhaar par isaki pramanikta par andeh pragat kiya jane laga
 It was observed that this interpretation of memory was correct at the initial stage but it failed to properly explain the different processes of memory such as recall of an old event and creation of new memories
 smriti ko samajhane ke liye or bhi nae siddhant aae
 Of these, the theory inspired by computer science proved to be the most appropriate
 smriti kii is nai vyakhya ko tantrika sanjaal model ke aadhaar par prastut kiya gaya tha
 According to this, memory is distributed in parallel rather than centered in our brain
 yah vitaran sookshm ikaiyaan jo ki tantrika koshika ke samatuly hoti hai, kii bani hoti hai
 In these units, memory is represented as a kind of activation model
 aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar hamaari smriti ek samuhik prakram he jiske teen mukhya charan hote hai
 In the first phase, the information is encoded
 iske pashchaat dwitiya charan main in kutabaddh soochnaaon kaa sangrahan hota he or antim tritiy charan main inkaa punassmaran kiya jaataa he
 In order to feel the environment around us, it is necessary that the environmental stimuli are received by the senses related to it
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhne ke liye ham us par se paravartit prakaash ko netron dwaara grahan karte hai
 Now this reflected light converts sensory nerve cells present in the retina of the eye into faint electromagnetic waves
 ab yah kaha ja saktaa he ki retina dwaara vaataavaran main upasthit prakaash uddipan kaa kodikaran vaidyutiya rup main kiya gaya
 Now this light electromagnetic wave goes into the visual field of the brain and is explained here
 is vyakhya ke aadhaar par ham apane man main saamne ke drishy kaa ek pratibimb banaate hai
 This entire process is called visual orientation
 koding ke samay suchanaaen mukhyatah sthaan, samay tathaa aavriti ke aadhaar par code kii jaati hai
 After coding the information comes the place of their storage
 yah sangrahan samvedi str yaa alpakaaleen smriti ke str yaa dirghakaalin smriti ke str par ho saktaa he
 It will be noted here that there may be little change in information in our brain at the time of storage
 matlab ki suchanaaen vahiin nahin rahengi jaisi ve vaastavik rup main thim
 We can add something from them or we can remove any part of that information
 agar aadhi adhuri soochna he to ham use apni kalpana shakti ke aadhaar par garh bhi sakate hai
 Due to this property, memory is a formative process
 smriti kaa atirikt str par vargeekaran smriti main soochnaaon ke sangrahan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 How do we know that we have memory of a particular time or place? Only when we remember it
 udhaaharan ke liye agar poocha jaae ki apane bachapan ke paanch shikshakon ke naam bataaie jinaki shikshaaon ne aapke jivan par sabase adhik prabhaav daalaa he to hamen uttar dene main der nahin lagegaa
 But if we ask that the names of Nobel Prize scientists in biology or any field from 2000 to 2005 can be given, then we may have to think for some time
 yah baat yahaan spasht ho jaati he ki ham kin chizon ko yaad rakhte hai or kin chizon ko bhul jate hai yah sab kaaphi kuch hamaari abhipreranaon, chetan or achetan ichchhaaon ityadi par nirbhar karata he
 Hence remembrance is an essential part of total memory
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki smriti ke vibhinn prakramon kii kriyavidhi kya he? smriti kii uparokt prakramon ko samajhane ke liye 1968 main atkinson tathaa siphrine ne smriti kii bahustareey sangrahan kii vyakhya prastut kii
 According to this definition there are three main collections of memory
 hamaari gyanendriyaan kisi bhi soochna ko vaataavaran se grahan karke use mastishk tak pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Later a conclusion is made by the brain based on that information
 ham dekhne, sunne yaa twachaa dwaara sheet yaa garmi kii anubhuti kaa udhaaharan le sakate hai
 Any atmospheric stimulus such as light or sound is first stored in a coded form for a very short period of time in their respective senses
 yah sangrahan atyalp samay ke liye hota he
 Its range of sight is 0
5 seconds and its time limit for hearing is around 2 seconds
 is samay seemaa ke pashchaat is sangrahit smriti kaa kshay ho jaataa he
 Information at the physical level is still preliminary and one cannot draw conclusions from it
 inkaa mastishk dwaara sangyojan tathaa parimarjan abhi baaki hota he
 When the information received by the senses comes to our attention, then they become part of the short term memory
 yahaan ullekhneey he ki samvedi str kii ve sabhi suchanaaen jin par ham dhyaan nahin dete ve samaapt ho jaati hai
 Only those information on which we concentrate become short-term memories
 alpakaaleen smriti ko kriyaatmak smriti bhi kaha jaataa he
 The best example of this type of memory is the recall of a phone number by us
 jab ham kisi number ko dekh kar use dial karte hai to do bate hoti hai
 First we look at the number and remember it by repeating it a few times, then after dialing the number we usually forget it
 atah is prakaar kii smriti ke sambandh main do nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 First, the capacity of short-term memory is very low
 Second, if there is a slight decrease in concentration in this type of memory, then our attention is not left
 phone vaale udhaaharan main agar number yaad karne or dial karne ke bich main koi duusari baat ho jaae to hamen number yaad nahin rahegaa
 Scientists have discovered that the total storage of information in this type of memory is only 20 to 30 seconds
 lekin agar soochna ko doharaaya jaae to yah samay 20 se 30 second se adhik bhi ho saktaa he
 And if you repeat it carefully again and again, this information gets converted into long term memory
 jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he dirghakaalin smritiyaan sthai hoti hai
 We use this memory in many ways
 aaj subah hamane naashte main kya khaaya? parason hamaare ghar koun-koun milane aayaa tha? un logon ne koun se kapade pahan rakhe the? hamane apana pichhlaa janmdin kahaan or kaise manaaya tha? ham cycle kaise chalaa lete hai se lekar varg paheli hal karne tak, in sari gatividhiyon main hamaari yah smriti hamaara saath detii he
 This type of memory is the most diverse and our feelings, experiences and knowledge etc
 are reflected in all these forms
 alpakaaleen smriti kii suchanaaen baar-baar duharai jane ke baad dirghakaalin smriti ban jaati hai
 This memory does not decay but may change
 ab tak smriti kii kriyavidhi par baat ho rahi thi
 The question remains as to how our brain stores these information and which activities of the nervous system are responsible for it
 yadi smriti hamaare mastishk main rahati he to iske bhautik nirupan ke kuch pramaan bhi hone chahie
 a lot of research has been done in this direction and many interpretations have also been presented in its context
 yah to aarambh se hi maaloom tha ki smriti nirmaan ke liye jaivik anu hi jimmedaar hote hai
 The first attempt was made in the 1960s to explain it based on the derivation of DNA molecules
 yah bataaya gaya ki smriti ke jaivik nirupan ke liye mrna ke anu jimmedaar hote hai
 It is noteworthy that these mrna molecules are mainly related to our genome messages and protein formation
 baad ke varshon main yah dekha gaya ki smriti ke bhautik aadhaar kii yah pariklpana sahi nahin he or is kshetra main koi bhi vichaar prastut karne ke liye nae avishkaron kii aavashyaktaa he
 The 1970s saw some new ideas regarding the physical representation of memory
 yah bataaya gaya ki mastishk main smriti ksheen vidyutiya tarango ke rup main utpann hoti he or yah kisi tarah se mastishk kii rachana main ati sookshm str par sthai bhautik parivartan karti he
 This physical change represents a new memory
 is vyakhya ke bare main ullekhneey hoga ki yah vibhinn prayogtmak parikshanon par aadhaarit thi or sahi bhi thi
 But here it could not explain how and what the weak electrical waves change structurally
 ” haal ke varshon main hue shodhon se smriti jauviki ke sambandh main nai jaankariyaan mili hai
 According to them, two major factors in memory formation are neural chemistry and nerve cell synapses
 shodhon se is baat ke sanket milte hai ki do tantrika koshikaon main soochna sanvahan ke liye jimmedaar neurotransmeter jo ki synapse dwaara sravit hote he ve kisi vishesh smriti ke liye ek vishesh tantrika praaroop ko baar-baar uttejit karte hai
 As a result a pattern is formed
 anubhavon or baar-baar kiye gaye prayaason se is pattern main thodaa parivartan ho saktaa he
 This pattern is permanent for a particular memory
 duusare shabdon main kahen to hamaare prayek anubhavon, kala, kaushal, smriti aadi ke liye nishchit tantrika praaroop hote hai
 When we think of someone, the format related to it is working
 jab ham koi prashn hal kar rahe hote hai to koi doosraa praaroop sakriy hota he
 We all must have faced a situation at some point when we remember our memory
 udhaaharan ke liye ham kuch kehane ja rahe hon or achaanak hi bhul gaye ki kya kahana he yaa pariksha main prashnptr ke saare uttar aa rahe hon lekin unako likhane ke liye shabd nahin mil paa rahe hai
 These are small examples of memory omission
 duusari ore aapane dekha hoga ki vriddhavastha main kuch logon ko bhuulane kii shikaayat hone lagati he
 There is a story about Einstein that once while he was walking in his university, one of his students asked him for lunch
 ainstine ne usase poocha ki jab aapane mujhe roka tab main kis disha kii ore se aa rahaa tha? vidhyaarthee ne ek ore ishaara kar ke bataaya ki aap us disha kii ore se aa rahe the
 Then Einstein replied
 dhanyavad! tab to maine bhojan kar liya he
 Many such stories are told in relation to philosophers and scientists
 yah chote str par hue smriti lop kaa ek udhaaharan he
 In all of the above events, we see that the smooth functioning of our brain is being hindered from somewhere
 thodi bahut maatra main smriti sambandhi dosha to lagbhag sabhi main hota he lekin ise rog kaa naam nahin diya ja saktaa
 When these symptoms affect the person and the people associated with them, then they give it the name of mementoes
 is prakaar ke rogi keval aadhe ghante pehle mili logon ko yaad nahin rakh pate
 He does not even remember that he had taken bath ten minutes ago
 jivan kii saamaanya kriyaayein bahut hi buree tarah se prabhavit hone lagati hai
 Memory omission or memory corruption is a memory event in which any process related to it is interrupted in memory or storage and as a result our normal memory is affected
 yah baadha kisi bhi shaareerik yaa manovaigyanik kaarnon jaise mastishk kii chot yaa kisi anya kaaran se hui kshati, bimaari, poshak tatwon kii kami, sadamein, atyadhik sharaab ke seven se, nashili dawaaiyon or adhik umr ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Some of the main types of amnesia are described here
 sharaab kaa atyaadhik seven karne vaale logon main iske lakshan dekhne ko milte hai
 Long-term high intake of alcohol causes mainly two problems
 ek to thymin vitamin kii khatarnaak str par kami ho jaati he or duusari, mastishk main kuch hanikaarak sanrachanaatmak parivartan ho jate hai
 As a result of this, memory of patients is badly affected
 aisa dekha gaya he ki inaki vartmaankaal kii smriti to thik hoti he lekin beeti ghatnaon ko yaad nahin rakh pate or bahut si mahatvapurn yaaden inaki smriti se puri tarah se gaayab dikhaai detii hai
 This type of memory error makes it difficult to remember new information, but the memories of the past events are exactly right
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi ke mastishk ke kisi khaas hisse par chot lag gai ho or uske baad use keval puraani bate yaad rah gai hon or durghatana ke baad kii kisi nai smriti ke liye koi sthaan hi na bachaa ho
 Old symptoms are surprisingly forgotten in its symptoms, but there is no problem in memories related to new events
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi durghatana ke baad puraani sari yaaden pataa nahin kahaan chali gayi? lekin nai soochnaaon ko yaad rakhane main koi kathinaayee nahin ho rahi he
 In this type of amnesia, memory returns in a few days
 yah dekha gaya he ki kabhi kabhi hamaara man hamen kuch vishesh smritiyon to bhuulane ke liye bhi prerit karata he
 And we also forget them completely
 hamaare vartmaan ko sukhad banane ke liye prakruti dwaara aisi vyavastha kii gai he
 This is especially so in the context of very painful memories
 udhaaharan ke liye balykaal main hui koi dukhad ghatana, dand aadi
 It will be noted here that these memories are lost only by our conscious mind
 kahin gahare achetan main inke ansh vidyaman hote hai
 We see many people around us whose memory capacity is very good
 kuch log aise bhi hote hai jo ki apane bhulakkad swabhaav ke kaaran jane jate hai
 All of us think how good it is when our memory capacity increases
 ek acchhee yaadasht kaa mukhya lakshan he ki yah sabhi sambandhit baton ko krambaddh rup se vyavasthit kare or aavashyaktaa padane par turant hi inaki uplabdhta sunishchit kare
 There are some medicines available which help in severe forgetting
 lekin in dawaaiyon kaa prayog vishesh sthitiyon main hi karnaa chahie
 How well we remember and learn depends a lot on our emotional state
 seekhney or samajhane ke liye preranadayak vaataavaran hameshaa hi laabhprad hota he
 We still learn better when we pay attention
 yah bhi aavashyak he ki soochna ko kis prakaar code kiya ja rahaa he
 How its storage and consolidation is happening and how it is being recalled again
 ek acchhee smriti ke liye in sari kriyaaon kaa sucharu rup se hona aavashyak he
 Memory devices are practical methods by which memory capacity can be increased to an extent
 ham jane anjaane main kinhin chizon ko yaad karne ke liye inkaa prayog bhi karte hai
 It is said of Napoleon that he remembered the name of every officer in his army
 is tarah kii vilakshan smriti kshamta vaale log dikhaai dete hai jinhen bahut saare varshon kaa panchang yaad rahata he
 Now the question arises that what is the difference between the way a normal person remembers and the ways of a specific memory person? Research has shown that the method of codification, collection and recall of information may vary slightly among individuals
 ek acchhee smriti yaa to janmajaat pratibha ho sakati he yaa baad main saadhaaran logon dwaara bhi kuch vishesh vidhiyon kaa prayog kar ke sikhi ja sakati he
 The process of memory is slightly complex in people with a congenital high memory capacity
 aisa dekha gaya he ki aise logon me kuch ke paas sinesthesia ke lakshan bhi hote hai
 To explain synesthesia, it can be said that such people listen to the sound as well as listen to the visuals as well
 atah kuch dekhne ke liye ve mastishk kii drishy kshamta ke saath-saath shravan kshamta kaa bhi prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, a soft mellow sound can also be a group of beautiful colors for them and darker piercing colors for a harsh sound
 sinesthesia ke lakshan or bhi samvedi kshamtaaon jaise sparsh, ghran ityadi ke liye bhi ho sakate hai
 Many other memory devices are also used to make memory effective
 jaise pehle se sangrahit smriti ko nai soochna se jod kar yaad karnaa, samaan soochnaaon ko ek saath rakh kar yaad karnaa, kisi bhi soochna ko ruchikar katha ke rup main badal kar yaad karnaa ityadi
 Another method SQ3R is very useful for understanding complex textual content
 isamen pehle paathya saamagree kaa man main ek khaakaa taiyaar karte hai, phir khud se hi us par “kya, kyon or kaise” aadhaarit kuch prashn banaate hai
 Now keeping these questions in mind, the textual content is read carefully and then read it again in sequence
 ant main pathak dwaara isaki samiksha kii jaati he
 Good mental and physical health is essential for good memory
 iske saath hi jo padhaa ja rahaa he usase bhaavnaatmak lagaav bhi aavashyak he
 Some concentration enhancing methods such as meditation and pranayama etc
 have also proved very useful in increasing the capacity of memory

 He did not want Ba to go to the satyagrahis at his behest and then present a difficult situation after falling into difficulties
 ve chaahate the ki ve swechhaya jaayan or jaayan to drudh rahen
 When Ba saw that Bapu did not talk to him about taking part in the Satyagraha, he became very sad and gave a blessing to Bapu
 phir swechhaya satyagrah main sammilit hui or teen anya mahilaon ke saath jail garin
 The food he got in the jail was inedible, so he decided to make fruit
 kintu jab unke is anurodh par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya to unhone upwas karnaa aarambh kar diya
 On the fifth day, officers had to bow down
 kintu jo fal die gaye vah puure bhojan ke liye paryaapt na the
 So Ba had to stay in jail for three months on half stomach food
 jab ve jail se chhutin to unka sharir thathri maatr rah gaya tha
 Except for going to jail in South Africa, he probably did not participate in any public work there, but after coming to India, Bapu shared all the tasks he took, like an experienced soldier
 champaran ke satyagrah ke samay ba bhi tiharva gram main rahakar gaanvon main gumti or dawa vitaran karti raheen
 In this work, the white people got a sense of politics
 unhone ba kii anupasthiti main unki jhopadi jalawaa di
 Children used to study in that hut of Ba
 apni yah chatshaala ek din ke liye bhi band karnaa unhen pasand na tha at: unhone sari raat jagakar ghaas kaa ek doosraa jhopra khadaa kiya
 Similarly, at the time of Kheda Satyagraha, women wandered around and encouraged them
 1922 main jab baapu giraftaar kiye gaye or unhen chah saal kii sajaa hui us samay unhone jo vaktavy diya vah unhen virangana ke rup main pratishthit karata he
 He called upon the people to abandon foreign clothes to protest against Gandhiji's arrest
 baapu kaa sandesh sunaane naujavaanon kii tarah gujarat ke gaanvon main gumti phirin
 In the days of Dandi Cooch and Dharasana's raid in 1930, Bapu continued to fill Bapu's absence in a way
 ve police ke atyaacharon se peedit janata kii sahaayta karti, dhairya bandhaati phirin
 He spent most of 1932 and 1933 in jail
 1939 main rajkot ke thakur sahab ne praja ko katipay adhikaar dena sweekaar kiya tha kintu baad main mukar gaye
 The public decided to do Satyagraha to express their protest against it
 ba ne jab yah suna to unhen laga ki rajkot unka apana ghar he
 It is their duty to participate in the Satyagraha to be held there
 unhone iske liye baapu kii anumati praapt kii or ve rajkot pahonchte hi savinay avagya ke abhiyog main najarband kar lee garin
 First he was kept in a secluded village in Sunsan where the atmosphere was not favorable to him at all
 janata ne andolan kiya ki unka swasthya thik nahin he, unhen chikitsa kii suvidha se dur rakhana ammanushik he
 As a result, she was kept in a palace, 10–15 miles from Rajkot
 ba ke jane ke kuch samay baad baapu ne bhi satyagrah main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or vahaan pahunchakar upwas aarambh kiya
 When Ba got the news of this, he decided to have a meal at one time
 baapu ke upwas ke samay ve sadaiv hi aisa karti thim
 Two or three days later, the Rajkot government, forgetting that they could go to meet Bapu, sent them to Bapu
 kintu jab shaam ko koi unhen najarbandi ke sthaan par waapas le jane nahin aayaa tab pataa chalaa ki is chalaave se unhen reeha kiya gaya he
 Bapu did not tolerate this
 unhone ba ko ek baje raat ko jail waapas bheja
 The Rajkot government did not dare to let them stay on the road all night
 ve waapas rajmahal le jaai gayin or uske baad duusare din ve baqayada reeha kii gayin
 After Bapu Adi was arrested on 9 August 1942, Ba decided to give a speech in the meeting at Shivaji Park, where Bapu himself was going to give a speech, but was arrested when he reached the gate of the park
 do din baad ve puna ke aagaa khan mahal main bhej di garin
 Bapu was already arrested and sent there
 us samay ve aswasth thim
 On 15 August, when Mahadev Desai suddenly did Mahaprayana, why did he keep saying Mahadev again and again; Why not me? Later, the shrine of Mahadev Desai became like a temple to shankar-mahadev for him
 ve nity vahaan jaati, samadhi kii pradakshina kar use namaskara karatin
 She also lit a lamp on him
 giraftaar kii raat ko unka jo swasthya bigadaa vah phir santoshjanak rup se sudhara nahin or antatogatva unhone 22 farvari 1944 ko apana aihik samaapt kiya
 After her death, the nation collected one crore rupees for the welfare of women
