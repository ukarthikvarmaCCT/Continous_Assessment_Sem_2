 Some people omit the initial 0, replacing the sequence with two 1's
 ganitiya sandarbh main, fibonachi sankhya ke f n anukram ko aavartan sambandh dwaara darshaya ja saktaa he- And, fibonachi anukram kaa naam pisa ke leonardo fibonachi ke naam par rakhaa gaya, jo fibonachi ke naam se jane jate the
 The 1202 book Liber Abeki, written by Fibonacci, introduced this sequence in West European mathematics, although this sequence has already been described in Indian mathematics
 fibonachi anukram pracheen bharat main bahut prasiddh tha, jahaan ise europe main prachlit hone se bahut samay pehle hi chand vigyaan main lagu kiya gaya tha
 The credit for its development is given to Pingala, Virhanka, Gopal, and Hemachandra
 fibonachi anukram, n -1 lambaai ke namoonay main s ko jod kar, yaa n -2 lambaai ke namoonay main l ko jod kar taiyaar kiya jaataa he; or chand-shastriyon ne darshaya ki n lambaai ke namoonay, anukram main pichhali do sankhyaon kaa yoga hai
 Donald Knuth reviewed this work in The Art of Computer Programming

 He considered the development of an ideal rabbit population, assuming that: iskaa niyam yah he ki khargoshon kii ek jodi apane jivan-kaal main 2 jodi paidaa karti he or mar jaati he
 Suppose the population is f in n months
 is samay, keval ve khargosh, jo n - 2 maheene main jivit rahe the, prajnanksham hai or santan paidaa karte hai, to f jode maujuuda aabaadi f main jud jate hai
 Thus, the total is f = f + F
 n = 0, 1, 2, 


, 20 ke liye Fn ke rup main bhi suchit kii jane vaali pehali 21 fibonachi sankhyaayein hai: Using the rotation relation, the sequence can also be extended to negative index n
 The result satisfies the equation is prakaar puraa anukram he Each third number of the sequence is even and typically, each kth number of the sequence is a multiple of Fk
 Thus the Fibonacci sequence is an example of a divisibility sequence
 Indeed, the Fibonacci sequence satisfies the apparent divisibility property
 raikhik aavartan dwaara paribhaashit prayek anukram kii tarah, fibonachi sankhya kaa ek purna-sutara hal he
 yah binet sutara ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki use pehle abrahim di moivre ke rup main janaa gaya tha: 
 fibonachi prayaavartan The determinant of the golden ratio is similar to the following equation jise prayaavartan ke utpaadak bahupad ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The solution of the above equation is x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin {matrix} x ^ {2} = x + 1, \ end {matrix}} \ ,} and xn - 1 { \ 
 Multiplying by displaystyle x ^ {n-1} \ ,} shows the following: paribhaasha ke anusaar φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, sameekaran kaa mul he or doosraa mul he 1 − φ = − 1 / φ 
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ ,=-1 / \ varphi \ ,
} 
 isliye: And donon φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} tathaa n = n { \ displaystyle ^{n}=^{n}} aisi jyamitiya shrinkhlaayein hai, jo fibonachi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan karti hai
 pehali shrinkhalaa ghaataanki rup se badhati he; duusari, ghaataanki rup se, ekantar chihnon sahit, shunya kii ore le jaati he
 chunki fibonachi prayaavartan raikhik he, in do shrinkhalaaon ke kisi bhi raikhik sangyojan se bhi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 ye raikhik sangyojan, ek do-aiami raikhik vector antar taiyaar karte hai; mul fibonachi anukram is antar main paaya ja saktaa he
 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known
 Despite that, the inverse Fibonacci constant richard andre-jianin dwaara aparimey sabit kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci prime number is a Fibonacci number that is prime
 The first few are: hazaron ankon ke saath fibonachi abhajya sankhya pai gai hai, lekin yah gyaat nahin he ki kya kai aparimit sankhyaayein maujuud hai
 un sabamein ek abhajya ghaataank hona chahie, sivaay f 4 = 3
 f kn can be divided by f n and therefore joint Fibonacci numbers are also arbitrarily in vogue due to the arbitrary number of joint numbers in circulation

 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}
} for example, yah gyaat nahin he ki koi abhajya p aise maujuud he ki f p − ≡ 0 { \ displaystyle F_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p^{2 xxrep 4 } is tarah kii abhajya sankhyaon ko waal-san-san abhajya sankhya kaha jayega
 Also, if p ≠ 5 is an odd prime number, then: sabhi maamalon ke udhaaharan: For odd n, all odd prime divisors of f n are ≡ 1, indicating that all odd divisors of f n are ≡ 1
 udhaaharan ke liye, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2 × 17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2 × 5 × 61 ∑ k = n n + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=n}^{n+9}f_{k}=11f_{n+6}} For example, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11×13n = 2:F2+F3+


+F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11×21n = 3:F3+F4+


+F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144= 374 = 11×34 In fact, the identities are not only positive, but are true for all n integers: n = 0: F0 + F1 + 


 + F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11 × 8n = −1: F−1+F0+


+F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11×5n = −2: f − 2 + f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11 × 3 yah aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he ki agar fibonachi anukram kii ikaayiyon ne mod n liya he, to adhik se adhik n 2 aavartan sahit parinami anukram aavartak honi chahie

 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center

 Jaldal who served me instead of Kardu Nyal Ray
 Woman water a wise you, do not delay to give
 i am Bhola Nath, now how can i become a fraudulent Nath
 Walking like this, Bholenath and kept hands on the head of Banasur
 ore bole jag bansur raay jatuje vardan de shivrai
 Bansur said: i am awake to God, the kingdom of God Shonitpur
 me mangu baar baar, muje dedo haath hjaar re
 Give such a blessing that ten thousand elephants should be given strength
 astu keh kar shiva ji ne vardaan diya ore banasur ko putr kar ke stapit kiya
 After receiving the boon, Banasur returned to Sonitpur
 tab use dekh kar sab pashu pankhi darane lage or jaise koi jaad chalaa aa rahaa ho aisa lag rahaa tha
 When he came close to his city, only his head recognized him
 uske baad uski shaadi hue or uske baad usne ek ke baad ek sabhi desh ko jeetna shuru kar diya, usne pataal lok ko bhi nahi choda ab usko swarg jeetne kii ichha huyi or wo swarg jeetne gaya or uske dar se sabhi devtaa waha se chale gaye
 He also conquered even the sun
 jab wo surya ko jeet kar vaapis ja rahaa tha tab use naarad ji meley or wo naradji ko pranaam karke bolaa o naradji ab ek bhi yodadhan nahi he ab me ke karu ?naarad ji bole : to sun banasur raay jisane tujko hajaaro haath diye usee shiva se jake sangram kar 
 After going to Mount Kailash, he started healing him
 Seeing this, Parvati ji got scared and went to Shivji and said, "hey Shivaara, whom you gave the kingdom of Shonitpur, thousands of hands, now what has he returned to ask here? Banasur said: You asked me Hands up, it is very cruel, but now i am also able to fight, give me a capable warrior and fight with me
 shivaji bole : yah teri jeed chhod de varanaa bahut pachhtaayenga
 Shivji said that you did not do it right, therefore i curse you that someone who will cut your hands and kill you with many pieces of yours
 Banasur said out of fear: How will i know who that person is, who Shivaji said: So i am giving you a flag in Banasur, when this flag is broken then your hands will be cut off and there will be a rain of blood in your city
 Then you will know that your death has come
 yah vardaan le kar banasur vaapis apane shonitpur me aa gaya | One Deen Mahadev felt like going to austerity
 yah sunakar parvati ji bahot rone lagi or boli are shivaji meraa yah janm kaise kategaa or muje ek bhi santan bhi nahi he
 Then Mahadev gave a boon and said that you grow a son and a daughter
 vardaan dekar mahadev ji van me tap karne ke liye chale gaye
 Umiya ji sat for a bath and he thought that after seeing Shiva's house at large, someone keeps coming, so why not put the child at the door and see him sitting
 unhone apane dakishanan ang se mail le kar aghad rup banaaya
 Hand made a foot and a broken height, four arms and a big belly, which looked huge, what to say about its beauty? His garland garland
 Junkamandal in his first tax, Modak diet in second tax, Farsi Shobhe in third tax and Chappala in fourth tax
 ganesh ko upja kar parvati ji bole uske paas agar koi ho to wo baithe baithe bate kare
 Thinking that he made a girl by matching with the left limb, she cannot describe her beauty
 ab donon bhai bahan khilne lage
 When Goddess sat for a bath, Narada came there
 When he saw two children sitting there, he left the place and went to where Shivji was, after coming to Madhuvan, he said: Ore Shivji Ore Shivji Naftat Bhundi Aye Tave
 vanvagde me firte ho sheer par daali dhul aank, dhaturo vijaya khao
 You went to my forest and your house to the house
 aap ke binaa umiya ji ne upjaae do balak
 Mahadev ji left for Kailash from there
 waha pahonch kar unako ganapati ji meley or talwaar rakhkar bole ore jataadhari jogi
 It looks very amazing by consuming ashes, no one can go inside without any ecstasy
 yah sun kar shivaji krodhit hue or ganapati ko laat maar kar ghar ke andar gaye
 Ganpati is like a universe broken
 trilok dolane laga are ye kya hua ?ab shivji kopeman ho gayi, ore gusse me aakar unhoneshri ganeshji kaa sheesh chhedan kiya
 Shivji pierced the head of Ganesh ji on the fourth day of the month of March in the month of Maghar with the same day Ganesh Choth's fast began
 wo sheesh ja ke chandra maan ke rath me ja gira
 This is why Deen Chandra Pujan is performed on Chaturthi
 ab shivaji ghar me aae, jaha umiya ji snaan kar rahi thi
 Fearing her, Okha went into the house
 namak kii kothdi me jake chup gayi
 And in my mind i started thinking that hit brother, now i will kill too
 jab mahadev ji ghar me gaye to ekadam se netra khol ke umiya ji bole : mahadev ji kyon aae ho vaapis, aank, dhatura khaanaa aapaki aadat he ye to pataa he par kya koi nahta ho vah jagah par kyo daudai aate ho ? aapako kuch samaj nahi aata he ? maine do balak baahar daravaaje pe rakhe he feer bhi aap kaise mandir me aa gaye ?shivaji bole : chup ho ja o paapann maine sabakuch dekha or samaja, itane deen tak mai tumhe sati janata tha
 But you have looted everything
 mere bagaiyr tumhaari santan kaise huyi ? vaah! aapane to kya himachal kaa naam rakhaa vaah! aisa sunakar umiya ji bahot gusse me aakar boli kal hi to aap kahe gaye kii pragat karjo bal
 Then Shankar Ji looked down in shame and said that your daughter went away and i killed your son
 vaadi binaa jure weldy, bachade binaa jure gaay
 Without brother, Jure Bahendi, son without Bina Jure
 paisa anaaj or putradhan, putr ja agevan
 Jesus is not a son, he listens to that house
 putr binaa ghar pinjar, van me khadey aag jalaau
 Why did Shiva kill Ganpati, now i can get my son from where? Say, Bal Ganpati, say Bal, why did Shiv hit Ganpati? umiya ji rudan karte hue bole shiva putr binaa jisaki maat wo trane kaise halki ho?tab shiva ko hosh aayaa, maine to diya tha vardaan
 This should be the work of Narada, Ganpati, he said his loot
 He spoke all his shoes and came up from penance
 maine maaraa aapako ye kaisaa niklaa aaj deen ? Father of all pollutions

 While staying here, Leonardo gained extensive knowledge of painting from his guru and became aware of its specifics
 sheeghra hi guru ne mahasoos kiya ki unka shishy unase bhi kahin guni va pratibhavan he, atah guru ke paas jitna bhi gyaan tha, apane shishy vinci ko de diya
 In addition to painting, Leonardo also specialized in engineering, study of human anatomy

 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha

 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed

 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 upanishdon main karmkand ko 'avar' kahkar gyaan ko isliye mahatv diya gaya ki gyaan sthool se sookshm kii ore le jaataa he
 Knowledge of Brahma, Jiva and Jagat is the basic education of Upanishads
 bhagavadgita tathaa brahmasutra upanishdon ke saath milakar veydant kii 'prasthaantrayee' kehalaate hai
 The Upanishads are the basic source of all Indian philosophies, be it Vedanta or Samkhya or Jainism or Buddhism
 upanishdon ko swayan bhi veydant kaha gaya he
 Many philosophers of the world consider the Upanishads to be the best enlightenment
 upanishad bhartiya sabhyataa kii vishwa ko amuly dharohar he
 The main Upanishads are 12 or 13
 harek kisi na kisi veda se judaa hua he
 These are written in Sanskrit
 17ve sadi main daara shikoh ne anek upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad karaayaa
 In the 19th century, the German philosophers Schopenhauer and Maxmüller, who showed interest in these texts and translated them, are well known and respected
 upanishad shabd kaa saadhaaran arth he - ‘sameep upaveshan’ yaa 'sameep baithna 
 This word is derived from the prefix 'up', 'ni' and, 'sad' metal
 sad dhaatu ke teen arth hai: vivaran-naash hona; gati-paanaa yaa jaananaa tathaa avsaadan-shithil hona
 In the Upanishads there is a very beautiful and esoteric dialogue between the sage and the disciple that leads the reader to the heart of the Veda
 upanishad bhartiya aadhyatmik chintan ke muladhar he, bhartiya aadhyatmik darshan strot hai
 They are theology
 jigyaasaaon ke rishiyon dwaara khoje hue uttar hai
 They are the essence of the discourses of contemplative sages
 ve kavi-hriday rishiyon kii kavyamay aadhyatmik rachanaayen hai, agyaat kii khoj ke prayaas hai, varnanaatit paramashkti ko shabdon main baandhane kii koshishen hai or us niraakaar, nirvikaar, aseem, apaar ko antardrushti se samajhane or paribhaashit karne kii adamya aakanksha ke lekhabaddh vivaran hai
 The Vedic era was an era of worldly pleasure and consumption
 maanav man kii nishcintata, pavitrataa, bhavukta, bholepan va nishpapata kaa yug tha
 To live life with total carelessness was the love and credit of the people of that period
 prakruti ke vibhinn manohari swaroopon ko dekhakar us samay ke logon ke bhavuk manon main jo udgaar swayansfoort aalokit tarangon ke rup main ubhare un manobhaavon ko unhone prashastiyon, stutiyon, divyagaanon va kavy rachanaaon ke rup main shabdabaddh kiya or ve vaidic richaayen yaa mantra ban gaye
 The minds of those people were filled with worldly joy, were satisfied with prosperity, were overwhelmed by natural divinities
 at: unke geeton main yah kaamana he ki yah anand sadaa bana rahe, badhata rahe or kabhi samaapt na ho
 He wished that we would enjoy this bliss for the entire hundred years and the generations after us should also be satisfied
 yahi nahin kaamana yah bhi kii gai ki is jivan ke samaapt hone par ham swarg main jaaen or is sukh va anand kii nirantarata vahaan bhi bani rahe
 Various rituals were also performed to achieve this purpose and these boons were also sought from them by organizing to please the gods
 jab prakruti karavat leti thi to prakritik vipadaaon kaa saamana hota tha
 Then the rituals to appease and please the imaginary control gods of those plagues, such as Marut, Agni, Rudra, etc
 were performed and they were prayed not to let such plagues come and protect the subjects upon their arrival
 kul milakar vaidic kaal ke logon kaa jivan prafullit, ahladamay, sukhaakankshi, ashaavadi or jijeevishaapurna tha
 There was no shadow of sadness, sin or miserable life in them
 narak va usamen milane vaali yaatnaaon kii kalpana tak nahin kii gai thi
 Karma was considered to be yajna and yajna itself and the concept of attainment of all its pleasures and redress of hazards
 yah jeevanstyli dirghakaal tak chali
 But how long would this go on? ek na ek din to manushya ke anant jigyaasu mastishk main or vartmaan se kabhi santusht na hone vaale man main yah jigyaasa, yah prashn uthanaa hi tha ki prakruti kii is vishaal rangabhumi ke peeche sutaradhar koun he, iskaa sristaa / nirmaataa koun he, iskaa udgam kahan he, ham koun hai, kahan se aae hai, yah sristi antat: kahan jaaegi
 What will happen to us? Shanai: -shanai: These questions sprouted
 or phir shuru hui in sabake uttar khojane kii lalak tathaa jigyaasu man-mastishk kii anant khoj yatra
 It is not that the Vedic sages never thought about soul, rebirth and karmaphalvad
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki is jivan ke bare main unka koi dhyaan na tha
 The sages had also occasionally considered this subject
 iske beej vedon main yatra-tatra milte hai, parantu yah keval vichaar maatr tha
 No worries or fears
 aatma sharir se bhinn tatv he or is jivan kii samaapti ke baad vah paralok ko jaati he is siddhant kaa abhas vaidic richaon main miltaa avashya he parantu sansar main aatma kaa avaagaman kyon hota he, isaki khoj main vaidic rishi pravrutt nahin hue
 Worldly life with all its limitations was the beloved of the Vedic sages
 prey ko chhodkar shrey kii ore badhane kii aturata upanishdon ke samay jaagi, tab moksh ke saamne grahastha jivan nissar ho gaya evam jab log jivan se anand lene ke bajaay usase peeth pherakar sanyas lene lage
 Yes, it also happened that Vedic sages used to calm down by asking 'who created this world?' And 'who is the god whom we worship'? There, the sages of the Upanishads decided some principles regarding the creator and also found out the 'truth' which is the right to worship and worship
 vaidic dharm kaa purana aakhyaan veda or naveen aakhyaan upanishad hai
 'yajna-dharma was performed in the Vedas and people were taught that to be happy, prosperous and successful and victorious in this life, it is necessary to perform sacrifices for the satisfaction and happiness of the gods
 'vishwa kii utpatti kaa sthaan yajna he
 Yajna is the best of all actions
 yajna ke karmfal se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 'these sutras were all around
 duusare, jab brahman granthon ne yajna ko bahut adhik mahatv de diya or purohitwaad tathaa purohiton kii manamaani atyadhik bad gai tab is vyavastha ke viruddh pratikriya hui or virodh kii bhaavana kaa sutarapaat hua
 People started thinking 'what is the real meaning of Yajna?' 'what secret is there within them?' 'what form of religion do they symbolize?' 'will they lead us to the ultimate goal of life?' Thus, too much emphasis on rituals and the tendency of rituals to be presented as the solution to all the problems of life, led the thinking people to rethink about them
 prakruti ke prayek rup main ek niyantrak devtaa kii kalpana karte-karte vaidic arya bahudevvaadi ho gaye the
 Among his deities are Indra, Varuna, Agni, Savita, Som, Ashwini Kumar, Marut, Pushan, Mitra, Pitar, Yama etc
 tab ek bauddhik vyagrata prarambh hui us ek paramashkti ke darshan karne yaa uske vaastavik swaroop ko samajhane kii ki jo sampurna sristi kaa rachayita or in devataaon ke upar kii satta he
 This anxiety paved the way for the Upanishads
 upanishad chintansheel evam kalpashil manishiyon kii darshanik kavy rachanaayen hai
 Where the prose has been written, they are also such words-power, phonetics, love and semantics in the poetry prose that they give an impression of the works of some divine power
 yah sachmuch atyukti nahin he ki unhen 'mantra' yaa 'richa' kaha gaya
 In fact, the Mantra or Richa is related to the Vedas but these nouns are also used here by some scholars to indicate the affinity of the Upanishads
 upanishad apane aasapaas ke drishy sansar ke peeche jhaankane ke praytn hai
 There are no tools available for it and no research and research facilities are possible
 apni manshchetana, maansik anubhuti yaa antardrushti ke aadhaar par hue aadhyatmik sphuran yaa divya prakaash ko hi varnan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The Upanishads are diverse chapters of spiritualism written by various inspired sages
 inamen vishwa kii paramsatta ke swaroop, uske avasthaan, vibhinn prakritik shaktiyon ke saath uske sambandh, maanviya aatma main uski ek kiran kii jhalak yaa sookshm pratibimb kii upasthiti aadi ko vibhinn rupakon or pratikon ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made to present the design through various images and symbols, arising out of deep thinking and self-thinking in relation to the origin of the creation and its creation
 ant main kaha yah gaya ki hamaari shreshth pariklpana ke aadhaar par jo kuch ham samaj sake, vah yah he
 Beyond this, perhaps only the divine knows this secret and 'maybe he does not even know
 ' In short, in the Vedas, efforts were made to understand the nature of the visible and manifest natural powers in this world, to worship them by worshiping them, appeasing them and securing worldly success and prosperity and protection from them
 un tak apni shraddha ko pahunchaane kaa madhyam yagyon ko banaaya gaya tha
 The Upanishads describe the many efforts that were made with the desire to interview the supreme power behind these natural powers or the supreme power of creation
 maanviya kalpana, chintan-kshamta, antardrushti kii kshamta jahaan tak us samay ke darshanikon, manishiyon yaa rishiyon ko pahunchaa sakin unhone pahunchne kaa bharsak praytn kiya
 This was his tenacity
 veda ke chaar bhaag hai - samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad
 The Upanishads depict self and non-self elements which represent the fundamental mysteries of the Vedas
 praaia: upanishad veda ke ant main hi aate hai
 Therefore, they are also known as Vedanta
 vaidic dharm ke moulik siddhanton ko teen pramukh granth pramanit karte hai jo prasthaantrayee ke naam se vikhyath hai, ye hai - upanishad, brahmasutra or shrimadbhagavadgita
 The Upanishads signify Brahmanism
 kehete hai is vidya ke abhyaas se mumukshujan kii avidya nasht ho jaati he ; vah brahm kii prapti kara detii he ; jisase manushyon ke garbhavas aadi sansaarik du:kha sarvatha shithil ho jate hai 
 As a result, the Upanishads are considered to be 'tattva' exponent texts, through practice of which a person is interviewed by Brahma or the Supreme Soul

 It is not easy to tie any subject to the definition of the test
 sainya vigyaan ke vyapak kshetra evam antarvishayi hone ke kaaran koi nishchit paribhaasha nahin di gai he
 Nevertheless some of the mystics have the following definition related to military science- captain bi

 With the change of time and age, changes in the processes of warfare are going on, along with this the changes in the military organization, its training and weapons also went on, in the same way the field of military science also changed
 aadhunik samay main vaigyanik pragati or avishkaron ne yuddh ke kshetra ko or vistrut va vyapak kar diya he
 Science refers to the study of any subject according to the rules, in this view, if the subject of military science is tightened to the test of science, it will be completely fulfilled, because under it the organization of the army, weapons, warfare plan, management and support etc
 The study is done
 jis prakaar vigyaan ke kuch siddhanth evam niyam hote hai or unheen ke aadhaar par kaarywahi kii jaay to uddeshy kii prapti usee niyam ke anurup ho jaati he

 jiske kaaran hi rasaynic yudhkala kaa janm hua he
 By biological factors, every possible attempt is made to poison the enemy's food, water and food by weakening his health and disrupting his mental strength to fight

 In whose present context, there is an urgent need for study

 Apart from this, employment opportunities mainly exist in the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, Education Corporations, Defense Journalism
 agar aapane is field main master degree hasil kar lee to newspaper, magazine aadi main rashtriya suraksha ko lekar aalekh likh sakate hai
 The method and process of conducting war has now become the main topic of politicians, because the control and use of the largest weapon, that is, nuclear weapons, is in the hands of the politicians and not the generals
 sainya vigyaan kaa vidhyaarthee ko sainik maamalon main purv se paryaapt gyaan hone ke kaaran ek kushal netritv kshamta kaa parichay de saktaa he
 Because the biggest irony today is the lack of understanding of military knowledge by politicians

 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gayasuddin tululaq kii mrityu ke baad uskaa putr 'june khaan', mohammad bin tululaq ke naam se dilli kii gaddi par baitha
 Its original name was 'ulugh Khan'
 rajamundari ke ek abhilekh main mohammad tululaq ko duniya kaa khan kaha gaya he
 Probably Muhammad Tughlaq was the most educated, learned and qualified person among all the sultans of medieval times
 apni sanak bhari yojanaon, krur-krityon evam duusare ke sukh-dukh ke prati upeksha kaa bhav rakhane ke kaaran ise 'swapnsheel', 'pagal' evam 'rakt-pipaasu' kaha gaya he
 Sultans have been declared unrighteous by historians like Barani, Sirhindi, Nizamuddin, Badauni and Farishta
 singhaasana par baithne ke baad tululaq ne amiron evam saradaaron ko vibhinn oopaadhiyaan evam pad pradaan kiya
 He gave the title of 'bahram Khan' to Tatar Khan, the title of 'imad-ul-mulk' to Malik Qabool and 'wazir-e-mumalik', but later he got the title of Gujarat with the title of 'khane Jahan'
 Was created usne malik aruyaaj ko khwaja jahaan kii oopaadhi ke saath ‘shahana-e-imaarat’ kaa pad, moulana gayasuddin ko 'kutulug khaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath 'vakil-e-dar' kii padavi, apane chachere bhai firoj shah tululaq ko 'naayab barbak' kaa pad pradaan kiya tha
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was one of the most intelligent, intelligent, religious, fair-minded, art-loving and experienced commander among all the Sultans of Delhi
 vah arabi bhashaa evam farsi bhashaa kaa viddhan tathaa khagolashastra, darshan, ganit, chikitsa, vigyaan, tarkshastra aadi main paarangat tha
 Like Alauddin Khilji, at the beginning of his reign, he neither accepted his position from the Caliph nor took the support of the Ulema class, though it had to do so later
 usne nyaay vibhaag par ulema varg kaa ekadhipaty samaapt kiya
 Qazi's decision with which he was not satisfied changed it
 sarvapratham mohammad tululaq ne hi bina kisi bhedbhaav ke yogyata ke aadhaar par padon kaa aavanton kiya
 Adopted a policy of appointing officers on the basis of merit by eliminating race and class discrimination
 vastut: yah us shaasha kaa durbhaagya tha ki, uski yojanaayen safaltaapurvak kriyanvit nahin hui
 Due to which it became the subject of criticism from historians
 mohammad tululaq ke singhaasana par baithte samay dilli sultanate kul 23 praanton main banta thi, jinamein mukhya the - dilli, devgiri, lahore, multan, sarmuti, gujarat, avadh, kannauj, lakhanauti, bihar, malwa, jajanagar, dwarasamudr aadi
 Kashmir and Balochistan were also included in the Delhi Sultanate
 dilli sultanate kii seemaa kaa sarvaadhik vistaar isi ke shasankaal main hua tha
 But due to its cruel policy, rebellion started in the state
 jiske falswaroop dakshin main nae swatantra rajya kii sthapana hui or ye kshetra dilli sultanate se alag ho gaye
 Bengal also became independent
 rajarohan ke baad mohammad tululaq ne kuch naveen yojanaon kaa nirmaan kar unhen kriyanvit karne kaa praytn kiya
 like - apni pratham yojana ke dwaara mohammad tululaq ne doaab ke upjaau pradesh main kar kii vruddhi kar di, parantu usee varsh doaab main bhayankar akaal pad gaya, jisase paidaavaar prabhavit hui
 The rebellion in the area led to a rebellion by the Tughlaq officials, which failed the Tughlaq's plan
 mohammad tululaq ne krishi ke vikaas ke liye ‘diwan-e- amir kohi’ naamak ek naveen vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 Due to corruption of government employees, indifference of farmers, lack of good land, etc
, after three years, their plan for agricultural progress was terminated
 mohammad bin tululaq ne kisaanon ko bahut kam byaaj par rin uplabdh karaayaa
 Tughlaq shifted the capital from Delhi to Devgiri under his second plan
 devgiri ko “kuvvatul islam” bhi kaha gaya
 Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Khilji named Devagiri as 'qutbabad' and Muhammad bin Tughlaq changed its name to Daulatabad
 sultan kii is yojana ke liye sarvaadhik aalochana kii gai
 There is a great controversy among historians on the reasons for the change of capital by Muhammad Tughlaq, yet it can be concluded that, Devagiri is situated in the center of Delhi Sultanate, safe from the fear of Mongol invaders, such a stretch towards prosperity of South India etc
 There were reasons why the Sultan thought of changing the capital
 mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi purnatah asafal rahi or usne 1335 i
 main daulatabad se logon ko dilli waapas aane kii anumati de di
 The change of capital resulted in the development of Muslim culture in the South, which eventually opened the way for the rise of the Bahmani Empire
 anubhav maury Under the third plan, Muhammad Tughlaq introduced symbolic and symbolic coins
 sikke sambandhi vividh prayogon ke kaaran hi edward tamas ne use ‘dhanavaanon kaa rajkumaar’ kaha he
 Muhammad Tughlaq introduced the coin named 'dokani'
 barani ke anusaar sambhavtah sultan ne rajkosh kii riktata ke kaaran evam apni samrajya vistaar kii niti ko safal banane hetu sankethik mudra kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Under the sign currency, the sultan probably introduced coins of brass and copper metals, which were worth the rupee of silver
 sikaa dhaalane par rajya kaa niyantran nahin rahane se anek jaali taksaal ban gayi
 Lagaan was given out with fake coins, which caused the economy to collapse
 sankethik mudra chalaane kii prerana china tathaa iran se mili
 The rulers there carried out these schemes successfully, while Muhammad Tughlaq's experiment failed
 sultan ko apni is yojana kii asafalataa par bhayanak aarthik kshati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Under the fourth plan, the Khurasan and Karachil conquests of Muhammad Tughlaq are mentioned
 khurasana ko jeetne ke liye mohammad tululaq ne 3,70,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ko ek varsh kaa agrim vetan de diya, parantu raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran donon deshon ke madhya samjhauta ho gaya, jisase sultan kii yah yojana asafal rahi or use aarthik rup se haani uthaani padi
 Under the Karachil campaign, the Sultan sent a large army under the leadership of Khusro Malik to conquer the hill states
 uski puri sena junglee raaston main bhatak gai, ebn batuta ke anusaar antatah keval das adhikari hi bachakar waapas aa sake
 Thus this plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed
 sambhavtah 1328-29 i
 ke madhya mongol akramanakari tarmasharin chaghtai ne ek vishaal sena ke saath bharat par akraman kar multan, lahore se lekar dilli tak ke pradeshon ko rond daalaa
 It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Tughluq returned the bribe to the Mongol leader
 It is also believed that the Mongol leader bribed the Sultan to undermine the status of the Delhi Sultan himself and similarly for the Mongol rule
 Granted
 unke bich jo bhi hua, mongol netaa ke prati is samajhote kii niti ke kaaran sultan ko aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa
 It is true that after this, there was never a Mongol invasion of India during the time of Muhammad Tughluq and that because of his ambitious failed plans, Muhammad Tughluq is called the 'king of failures'

 udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he – dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year
 naastikta · isai dharm · hindu dharm · islam · yahudee dharm · sikh dharm Loh is the first place in metallurgy for iron production
 bharat ati pracheen kaal main loh utpaadan main agrani rahaa he
 The iron pillar of Delhi is a clear proof of this
 bharat kii loh ayask kii khadaanen vishwa kii shreshthatam evam vishaltam khadaanon main se hai
 It is estimated that there is about 10 billion tonnes of iron ore in India's geology
 loh utpaadan ke liye mukhyat: chaar kachche padaarthon kii aavashyaktaa padati hai : Iron ore, fuel, sulfur flux and heat substances loh ayskon vargeekaran unke rasinic sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 Hematite, magnetite, limonite and siderite are the major iron ores
 pratham teen ayskon main loh apane oxide ke rup main tathaa chauthe main carbonate ke rup main vidyaman rahata he
 Most of the world's iron is produced by hematite iron ore
 aadhunik loh-utpaadan-vidhi main idhan ke rup main coke kaa hi adhik upyog kiya jaataa he
 a particular type of coal is heated to about 1,000 ° C
 Coke is prepared by carbonizing on heat
 kuch vishesh prakaar ke bhatton main kaath koyale kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Cheeks are used to remove iron ore and foreign substances present in fuel
 loh utpaadan main jin gaalkon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he unamem chuunaa pathar tathaa dolomite pramukh hai
 Heat parchtha is used for lining iron kilns in liquefied furnaces, so that there is no damage to the furnaces due to excessive heating
 loh utpaadan main adhiktar agnisah iton kaa hi upyog hota he, parantu aajkal kahin kahin carbon kii iton kaa bhi upyog kiya jane laga he
 The iron content in iron ore generally ranges from 30 to 65 per cent
 isamen adhiktar silica tathaa alumina vijaateey padaarth ke rup main vidyaman rahete hai
 Sometimes, lime also remains mixed in sufficient quantity
 ayask main vijaateey padaarthon kii upasthiti se na keval lohe kii maatra ghatati he varan un padaarthon ko nishkasit karne ke liye adhik maatra main idhan tathaa gaalak kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This reduces the production efficiency of the ferrous kilns, as well as increases the production expenditure
 kabhi kabhi vijaateey padaarthon main silica, alumina tathaa chooney kaa anupaat is prakaar hota he ki ayask newnaadhik aatmagaalak ban jaataa he or tab bahya gaalak kii aavashyaktaa bahut kam ho jaati he
 The furnaces in which iron ore is made by liquefying iron ore are called vatya kilns
 aadhunik vaatyabhatthee, 100 foot yaa isse bhi adhik unchi hoti he or iskaa aakaar vrittakar hota he
 The combustion zone of the giant ventilator is 30 feet in diameter
 vaatyabhatthee ko chaar mukhya bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The top part of the furnace is called the charge configuration
 is vinyas ke dwaara bhatthi main loh ayask, idhan tathaa gaalak kaa prabhaar uchit rup se kiya jaataa he
 In this configuration there is a system of 'double shaking', so that the contaminated gases do not come out of the furnace at the time of charge
 prabhaar vinyas kii kul oonchaai sampurna bhatthi kii lagbhag 20 pratishat hoti he
 The bottom part of the charge configuration is called 'stack'
 yah bhaag upar se neeche kii ore kramash: chaudaa hota jaataa he or isaki kul oonchaai sampurna bhatthi kii lagbhag 60 pratishat hoti he
 Its bottom is based on 12 or 16 hard columns made of cast iron, so that the lower part of the furnace can be opened and repaired if needed
 aadhunik bhatthi main stack ke nichle paanch foot tathaa sheersh ke 10 foot bilkul urdhwadhar hote hai
 The part of the furnace under the stack is called the burning zone
 jvalanakshetra upar se neeche kii ore patala hota jaataa he
 Thus it can be seen that the maximum diameter of the furnace is at the place where stack and combustion area meet
 jvalanakshetra kii oonchaai bhatthi kii kul oonchaai kii lagbhag 10 prati shat hoti he
 The lowest section of the furnace is called Chullital or Chulha
 yah bhaag jvalanakshetra ke neeche avasthit hota he or dravit dhaatu tathaa dhaatumal ke aadhanpaatr kaa kaary karata he
 Its height is also about 10 per cent of the height of the furnace
 chuulhe kaa upree bhaag jahaan jvalanakshetra se miltaa he vahaan bhatthi ke chaaron ore chhidr bane hote hai, jinamein hawa tontiyaan lagaai jaati hai
 These caps send air gusts inside the furnace at high pressure
 isiilie in bhatthiyon ko vaatyabhatthee kii sangya di gai he
 The outer shape of the furnace is made of thick steel sheets, inside which a variety of fire bricks are lining, so that the furnace structure is not damaged due to high temperature
 bhatthi ke nimna bhaag main jahaan taap atyadhik hota he, deevaaron ko sheethal rakhane ke liye agnisah iton ke str main 'shitalan' patt laga die jate hai, jinamein sadaa sheethal jal pravaahit hota rahata he
 To remove liquefied metal and feces, stove-holes and stools are made in the stove
 vaatyabhatthee ke 'bharan' main adhikansh loh ayask, idhan tathaa gaalak hi rahete hai
 The quantity of these three substances is determined on the basis of their chemical and physical properties
 sampurna bhatthi ko prabhaar-vinyas dwaara prabhaar se bhaarit kar diya jaataa he
 At high pressure, a gust of air is sent inside the furnace around the stove
 aadhunik bhatthiyon main vaayu ke jhonke ko andar bhejne ke purv 700° -800° sein
 tak garam kar liya jaataa he
 As soon as this gust of wind comes in contact with the coke, it starts burning and thus heat is produced in the furnace
 is prakaar vaatyabhatthee kaa karyaarambh hota he
 As the solid charge moves downwards, the temperature increases gradually
 bhatthi ke sheersh bhaag kaa taap 200° -250° sein
 hota he or dhire dhire yah badhata hua hawa tonti ke dharaatal ke nikat 1,850° sein
 tak ho jaataa he
 It takes about 12-14 hours for the top to reach the surface of the windpipe from the top, while the gas rising from the bottom takes less than a second to reach the top
 jaise jaise prabhaar neeche sarakta he vah adhikadhik ucch taap kshetra main pahunchataa he or uski ardrata lupt ho jaati he
 This action takes place 10 feet below the top of the stack, where the temperature is about 400 ° C
 it happens
 jab prabhaar or neeche utarataa he tab vah or adhik ucch taap ke sampark main aata he
 The intensity of degradation of iron oxide by carbon monoxide increases in this region
 50 foot neeche pahonchte pahonchte lagbhag sampurna loh oxide avakrut ho jaataa he or vah spanj ke rup main ho jaataa he
 Thereafter, limestone is decomposed to produce lime and carbon dioxide
 yah chuunaa vijaateey padaarthon se milakar ghaatumal banaata he
 Now the charge comes down to the smelting area
 yahan spanj loha tej dahakate hue coke ke sampark main aata he, at: usamen carbon kaa pravesh hota he
 About 1,350 ° c The heat begins to liquefy
 is taap par chuunaa pathar kii gaalak kriya bhi ati teevr ho jaati he
 Some manganese, phosphorus and silicon oxides are also degraded and added to the metal due to excessive heating in the furnace's combustion zone
 isi kshetra main loh carbon se santrupt ho jaataa he or tab uskaa taap dravnank se kaaphi unchaa pahunch jaataa he
 In this way, liquid metal and sewage are collected in the bottom of the furnace and they are periodically taken out from the spout and sewage
 aadhunik vatya bhatthi main idhan ke rup main dhaatukarmee koyale kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, parantu kahin-kahin dhaatukarmee koyale ke sthaan par kaath koyale kaa vyavhaar bhi hota he
 The pulsing strength of wood coal is much less than that of metallic coal
 isliye kaath koyale se chalanevaali bhatthiyaan bhi paryaapt choti hoti he
 The methods of producing cast iron from wood coal furnaces and their principle are similar to that of blast furnaces
 antar itnaa hi he ki inase jo loha nikalataa he usamen apdravyon kii maatra kam hoti he or lohe kii kism acchhee hoti he, parantu in bhatthiyon kii utpaadankshmata aadhunik vaiabhatthiyon kii apeksha bahut kam hoti he
 Therefore their use is reduced nowadays
 aadhunik kaal main vidyut bhatthiyon kaa upyog badhata ja rahaa he

 Therefore, representative democracy nowadays

 Citizens of some countries likewise elect their representatives for the executive and judiciary in the same way

 There are virtually five parts of any electoral system: nirvachankshetron ke nirdhaaran se sambanddh niyam; Rules relating to eligibility of voters; ummidavaaron kii arhata or manonayan sambandhi niyam Rules for voting and ballot counting; And nirvachan sambandhi vivaadon ke nibatare ke liye kisi na kisi tarah kii vyavastha kintu prachlit bhashaa main nivachin pranali ko uparyukt keval chauthe ang tak hi simit mana jaataa he, at: yahan isi ang par vichaar kiya jayega
