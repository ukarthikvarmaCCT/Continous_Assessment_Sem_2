 Refrigerator is a home-use device that keeps vegetables and food items cold and keeps them from getting spoiled quickly
 gharelu upyog ke liye thodi maatra main khaadya padaartho ko thanda rakhane ke nimitt 1917 i
 se hi prashithitron kaa vyavsaayik reeti se nirmaan aarambh hua or 1925 i
 se to ve sarsaadhaaran ke liye bhi sulabh ho gaye
 Initially, only gas powered devices were made, but now some years electric powered refrigerators have become popular
 aajkal sab prakaar ke prashithitron kii almariyaan dekhne main ek si hi lagati hai
 They are coated with a layer of porcelain and a thick effluent coating on the outside
 bhinn bhinn maadlon kii keemat ke anusaar prashithitr kii deevaaron main laga ooshmaarodhak 2 se 4 inch tak motaa hota he
 The thicker the insulator, the more effective it will be, because the heat of most of the atmosphere is passed through the walls into the food
 prayek prashithitr main rakhe khadyapadartho ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam kisi prasheetak madhyam kii bhautik dasha main parivartan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, a good refrigerant must have the following qualities: ammonia gas, sulfur doiaksaide, carbon dioxide, dychlor-dyphlor-mithen pramukh gaisen hai, jinka upyog prashithan main hota he
 The principle of refrigerators operated only by ice and by the device is virtually the same, because in both of them the heat of the food is only absorbed by the physical change of the medium
 pehle main to barf pighalkar pani ban jaataa he, or duusare main prasheetak drav, yantra ke dwaara gas se parinat ho jaataa he
 Multifunctional refrigerators are made in such a way that air is transported from the underside of the ice blocks and the ice is at fault
 at: jab tak khaadya kaksh band rahata he uskaa taap 60 se 80 ke bich rahata he, chaahe barf kii silli kitni hi patali ho jaae
 Thus a sill lasts for 4-5 days
 svachlit prakaar ke yantric prashithitr do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sampeden ke siddhant par ore duusare avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale
 In the closed systems of these two, the refrigerant-medium keeps transporting
 inke bheetar vaashpitra bhaag main bharaa prasheetak-drav gas rup main parinat hote samay khadyakaksh kii garmi kaa avasorana kar uske upar lagi sanghanak kundaliyon main, jo sadaiv hawa ke sampark main rahati hai, jaakar, sanghanit hokar dubaara drav ban jaataa he
 There is also a heating instrument called by which the temperature of the food can be controlled
 sampeden ke siddhant par chalanevaale prasheetak yantron main athwa ashwashakti kii motor, yantra ke kriyachakra kaa aarambh karne ke liye lagaai jaati he, jiske dwaara sulfur dioxide athwa dochlordiflor mithen ke jaise gasiy prasheetak-madhyam vaashpitra main se sanghanan kundaliyon main prerit kiye jate hai
 Then one of these passes through the special valve and returns to the evaporator
 ye kapaat bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is the diffusion valve, by which the condensed refrigerant enters the evaporator, disintegrating as a fine spray and causing it to form, in part, the vapor
 duusare prakaar kaa plav kapaat he, jo vaashpitra ke bheetar kaaphi maatra main prasheetak-drav ikattha hone par apana kaam karata he or tabhi kriyachakra kaa punaravartan hota he
 In refrigerators operating on the principle of absorption, ammonia gas easily dissolves in cold water and also escapes easily when the water is heated
 at: pani ko garam karne ke liye tel yaa gas kii jwaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When separated from the water, the ammonia gas is liquefied in the condensation coils and flows into the evaporator, where the pressure of the condenser through hydrogen is reduced so much that the liquid starts evaporating again
 phir, vaashpitra se hydrogen or ammonia gas kaa mishran avasorak prakoshth main jyonhi pahunchataa he, usamen pani kii ek baarik phuhaar milti he
 This causes the ammonia gas to dissolve in water and return to the insoluble hydrogen vapor in water
 idhar ammonium hydroxide vashpajanitr main aakar kriyachakra ko pun: chaalu kar detaa he
 Due to the constant exchange of heat and coolness in this type of device, its design becomes very complicated, but the functionality of the device remains good

 The story is based on two families Marwari and Bengali who have lived together in Kolkata for twenty years

 After the birth of Kunti's son Yudhishthira, Dhritarashtra's wife Gandhari also had a longing to be a daughter
 gandhari ne veda vyas ji se putravati hone kaa vardaan praapt kar liya
 Even after the lapse of two years after the conception, when the son was not born, the erring Gandhari punched her in the stomach and dropped her womb
 yogabal se veda vyas ko is ghatana ko tatkaal jaan liya
 They came to Gandhari and said, "gandhari, you have done a lot wrong
 meraa diya hua var kabhi mithyaa nahin jaataa
 Now prepare a hundred wells and fill them with melted butter
 " gandhari ne unki aagyaanusaar sau kund banavaa diye
 Ved Vyas sprinkled concentrated water on the flesh of the gland from Gandhari's womb, which became equal to a hundred pieces of the thumb of that body
 vedavyas ne un tukdon ko gandhari ke banawaaye sau kundon main rakhwa diya or un kundon ko do varsh pashchaat kholane kaa aadesh de apane ashram chale gayi
 Two years later, Duryodhana was first born from the pool

 Duryodhana started taking birth like a donkey as soon as he was born

 AJAX is a set of web development techniques that are used on the customer side to build interactive web applications
 ajaks ke saath, web anuprayog prishthbhumi main sarwar se atulykaalik rup se data ko punah praapt kar saktaa he, isamen disple or upasthit pej ke vyavhaar se kisi prakaar kii koi baadha nahin pahunchati he
 The use of Ajax technologies has increased interactive or dynamic interfaces on web pages
 data aamtaur par xmlhttp request object kaa upyog karte hue punah praapt kiya jaataa he
 Despite the name, the use of javascript and XML is not actually required, nor does the request need to be asynchronous
 DHTML or LAMP kii tarah, ajaks apane aap main ek takanic nahin he, balki takneekon kaa ek samooh he
 Ajax employs a combination of the following: saamagree kii atulykaalik loding ke liye takneekein san 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main aayin
 The first version of the Java language, Java Applet, was introduced in 1995
 ye ek web pej ko lod kiye jane ke baad data ko atulykaalik rup se lod karne ke liye sankalit graahak paksh code kii anumati dete hai
 However, the feature became widely known only when it was used by Gmail and Google Maps
 yah shabd "ajaks" san 2005 main aayaa
 The word "ajax" came to Jesse James Garrett's mind when he was taking a bath, at the time he felt the need for an abbreviated form of representation of technologies for a customer
 5 april 2006 world wide web concortium ne ek adhikarik web maanak ke nirmaan ke liye object ke liye pehla draft vivaran jari kiya
 The term Ajax represents a large set of web technologies that are used to implement a web application that communicates with a server in the background, in the meantime it does not interfere with the current state of the page is
 jis lekh main shabd ajaks diya gaya,jesi james garet ne spasht kiya ki nimnlikhit praudyogikiyon kii aavashyaktaa he: XML and XSLT

 In particular it is noted that: anya bhashaaen jaise vbscript bhi aavashyak kaaryakshmata ke yogya he
 However, Java Script is the most popular language for Ajax programming, as it is compatible with and included with most modern web browsers
 clasical ajaks main graahak par tadarth java script kaa lekhan shaamil he
 An easy and cruder option is used for standard Java Script libraries that partially update the page, such as the update panel of asp
net
 Tools such as Echo2 and ZK enable fine grained control of a page from the server using only standard Java Script libraries
 paaramparik tareeqon kaa upyog kaa upyog karte hue, har request par saamagree ko relod kiya jaataa he
 However, using Ajax, a web application only requests content that needs to be updated, thus greatly reducing bandwidth usage and load time
 upyogkarta anuprayog ko adhik tej or adhik pratikriyasheel banaate hai, yahaan tak ki tab bhi jab anuprayog sarwar ke paksh par badla nahin he
 Nearby tasks include the use of invisible iframes, which change the history of the browser and change the anchor part of the URL when Ajax is running and control it for changes
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan maujuud hai, jinamein se kai iskaa trek rakhane ke liye URL fregment edentifire kaa upyog karte hai or upyogkarta ko ek di gayi avasthaa main anuprayog par lautne ke liye anumati dete hai
 Screen readers that are able to use Ajax may be unable to properly read dynamically generated content
 upyogkarta ko kaaryshil banane kaa ekmaatr tarika he, gaiyr javascript tareeke par waapas janaa
 aisa nishchit link bana kar kiya ja saktaa he, ou roopon ko thik prakaar se hal kiya ja saktaa he or ye keval ajaks par hi nirbhar nahin karte hai
 In javascript then the process of submitting the form with "return false" can be mistaken

 Even today its main function is this
 iske atirikt aaj adhivaktaa keval vidhivisheshgy nahin, samaaj ke nirdeshak bhi hai
 The form and progress of modern society is mainly controlled by law and the method created by assemblies is only the basic principle, by arranging its jargon and advocates provide it in whatever form they want
 atev vidhi kaa vyaavhaarik rup adhivaktaaon ke haathon hi nirmit hota he, jiske sahare samaaj pragati karata he

 piyaaje dwaara pratipaadit sangyanatmak vikaas siddhanth maanav buddhi kii prakruti evam uske vikaas se sambandhit ek vishad siddhanth he
 Onge believed that his childhood plays an important role in the development of a person
 piyaaje kaa siddhanth, vikasi avasthaa siddhanth kehalaata he
 This theory is about the nature of knowledge and explains how human knowledge is acquired gradually, how it is added one by one and how it is used
 vyakti vaataavaran ke tatwon kaa pratyakshikaran karata he; arthath pahachaanata he, pratikon kii sahaayta se unhen samajhane kii koshish karata he tathaa sambandhit vastu / vyakti ke sandarbh main amoort chintan karata he
 a knowledge store or cognitive structure within it consisting of all the above processes dictates its behavior
 is prakaar ham kah sakate hai ki koi bhi vyakti vaataavaran main upasthit kisi bhi prakaar ke uddipakon se prabhavit hokar sidhe pratikriya nahin karata he, pehle vah un uddipakon ko pahachaanata he, grahan karata he, uski vyakhya karata he
 Thus we can say that the nounative structure acts as an intermediary between stimulants and behavior present in the environment
 jyaan pyaaje ne vyapak str par sangyanatmak vikaas kaa adhyayan kiya
 According to Piaget, the nature of the store of knowledge acquired by the child changes at every stage of development and continues to be refined
 piyaaje ke sangyanatmak siddhanth ko vikasaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha jaataa he
 Since according to him, the development of cognition within the child goes through many stages, hence it is also called stage theory
 jyaan piyaaje ne sangyanatmak vikaas ko chaar avasthaaon main vibhajit kiya he- In this state, the child acquires knowledge only with the help of his sensations and physical actions
 baccha jab janm letaa he to uske bheetar sahaj kriyaayein hoti hai
 With the help of these spontaneous actions and senses, the child gets to experience objects, sounds, touches and smells and due to the repetition of these experiences, he gets acquainted with some characteristics of stimulants present in the environment
 is avasthaa main balak svakendrit va swaarthee na hokar dusron ke sampark se gyaan arjeet karata he
 Now he increases his knowledge more and more about objects through games, simulation, picture making and language
 dhire-dhire vah pratikon ko grahan karata he kintu kisi bhi kaary kaa kya sambandh hota he tathaa taarkik chintan ke prati anbhigya rahete hai
 At this stage, indexability is found
 is avasthaa me balak ke anukarano me paripakvata aa jaati he In this stage, the child starts going to school and the ability to understand the similarity, differentiation between things and events arises
 In this stage, children have knowledge of number sense, classification, arrangement according to order, mutual relationship between any object, person
 goes
 vah tark kar saktaa he
 In short, he learns many rules to adapt to the environment around him
 yah avasthaa 12 varsh ke baad kii he is avasthaa kii visheshta nimna he :- Jean Piazza has mainly considered two things important in the process of cognitive development

 ek balak vaataavaran main upasthit uddipakon ke sambandh main uski vibhinn maansik kriyaayein pruthak pruthak kaary nahin karti he balki ek saath sangathit hokar kaary karti he
 Adjusting with the environment is the result of the organization itself
 sanghathan vyakti evam vaataavaran ke sambandh ko aantarik rup se prabhavit karata he
 Adaptation affects externally
