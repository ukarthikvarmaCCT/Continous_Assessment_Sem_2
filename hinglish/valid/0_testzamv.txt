 Los angeles huston The legend of Nal and Damayanti appears in the epic of India, the Mahabharata
 yudhisthir ko jue main apana sab-kuch ganvaa kar apane bhaaiyon ke saath vanvaas karnaa padaa
 At the same time, a sage told him the story of Nal and Damayanti
 nal nishadh desh ke raja the
 He was the son of Veersen

 He was proficient in armaments and horse-handling
 damyanti vidarbha naresh kii ekmaatr putree thi
 She was also very beautiful and talented
 nal uske saundarya kii prashansa sunakar usase prem karne laga
 The message of their love was delivered to Damayanti very efficiently by a swan
 or damyanti bhi apane us anjaan premi kii virah main jalane lagi
 This story has such an effective put of love and suffering that writers and poets, not only from India but also from abroad, could not live without being attracted by it
 bop latin main tathaa dean millman ne angreji kavita main anuwaad karke pashchim ko bhi is katha se bhalee bhaanti parichit karaayaa he
 a king named Bhishmak ruled the country of Vidarbha
 unki putree kaa naam damyanti thi
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 unheen dinon nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal rajya karte the
 He was very talented, truthful and a Brahmin devotee
 nishadh desh se jo log vidarbha desh main aate the, ve maharaj nal ke gunon kii prashansa karte the
 This praise also reached Damayanti's ears
 isi tarah vidarbha desh se aane vaale log rajkumaari ke rup or gunon kii charchaa maharaj nal ke samakshkarte
 As a result of this, Nal and Damayanti became attracted towards each other
 mahabharat main dharmraj yudhisthir ke aagrah karne par maharishi brihadshv ne nal-damyanti kii katha sunai- Dharmaraja! In the country of Nishad, there has been a king named Nal, son of Veersen
 ve bade gunavan, param sundar, satyawadee, jitendriya, sabake priy, vedagy evam brahmanbhakt the
 His army was very large
 
 He himself was very proficient in astrology

 He also had some passion for playing gambling
 unheen dinon vidarbha desh main bhim naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 He was also very virtuous and mighty like Nal
 unhone daman rishi ko prasann karke unke vardaan se chaar santaanen praapt kii thim—teen putr or ek kanya
 The names of the sons were Dum, Dant, and Daman
 putree kaa naam tha—damyanti
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi

 Even the beautiful girl was not seen in the gods and yakshas
 un dinon kitne hi log vidarbha desh se nishadh desh main aate or raja nal ke saamne damyanti ke rup or gun kaa bakhaan karte
 Even those who went from Nishad country to Vidarbha used to describe the form, quality and sacred character of King Nal in front of Damayanti
 is prakaar donon ke hriday main parsparik anuraag ankurit ho gaya
 One day King Nal saw some swans in the garden of his palace
 unhone ek hans ko pakad liya
 Hans said - 'if you leave me, we will go to Damayanti and describe your qualities in such a way that she will definitely take you
 ’ nal ne hansako chhod diya
 They were flown in unfertile country
 damyanti apane hanson ko dekhakar bahut prasann hui or hanson ko pakadaney ke liye unki ore daudane lagi
 The swan that Damayanti ran to catch, he would say, 'ari Damayanti! Nishad is a king named Nal in the country
 vah ashvinikumar ke samaan sundar he
 No one else is as beautiful as human beings
 vah maano murtiman kaamdev he
 If you become his wife, then both your birth and appearance become successful
 ham logon ne devtaa, gandharva, manushya, sarp or rakshason ko gum-ghumkar dekha he nal ke samaan kahin sundar purush dekhne main nahin aayaa
 Just as you are a gem in women, in the same way Nal is a Bhushan in men
 tum donon kii jodi bahut hi sundar hogi
 Damayanti said - "hansa! Say the same thing to you from the tap
 ’ hans ne nishadh desh main lautakar nal se damyanti kaa sandesh kah diya
 On hearing the fame of King Nal from the mouth of Damayanti Hans, he started loving them
 uski aasakti itani bad gayi ki vah raat-din unka hi dhyaan karti rahati
 The body became foggy and lean
 vah deen-si deekhne lagi
 The Sakhis, following Damayanti's heart rate, requested Vidarbharaj that 'your daughter is unwell
 ’ raja bhim ne apni putree ke sambandh main bada vichaar kiya
 In the end, he reached the decision that my daughter had become married, so she should do it herself
 unhone sab raajaaon ko swayamvar kaa nimantran-patr bhej diya or suchit kar diya ki raajaaon ko damyanti ke swayamvar main padharkar laabh uthaanaa chaiye or meraa manorath purna karnaa chaiye
 The patriarchs of the country, with the sound of elephants, horses and chariots, started reaching the Vidarbha country with vigor while scorching the earth
 bhim ne sabake swaagat satkar kii samuchit vyavastha kii
 The Gods also got news of the Swayamvara of Damayanti through the Devarshi Narada and the mountain
 indra aadi sabhi lokapal bhi apni mandali or vaahanon sahit vidarbha desh ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Raja Nal's mind was already enamored on Damayanti
 unhone bhi damyanti ke swayamvar main sammilit hone ke liye vidarbha desh kii yatra kii
 While descending from heaven, the gods saw that beautiful tapes like Kamadev were going to the Swayamvara of Damayanti
 nal kii surya ke samaan kaanti or lokottar rup-sampatti se devtaa bhi chakit ho gayi
 He recognized that these are the taps
 unhone apane vimaanon ko akaash main khadaa kar diya or neeche utarkar nal se kaha—‘rajendra nal ! aap bade satyavrati hai
 You become a messenger to help us
 ’ nal ne pratigya kar lee or kaha ki ‘karunga’
 Then he asked, 'who are you and what is your job as a messenger?' Indra said - 'we are gods
 main indra hoon or ye agni, varun or yama hai
 We have come here for Damanti
 devataaon ne nal se kaha ki aap hamaare doot banakar damyanti ke paas jaaiye or kahie ki indra, varun, agni or yamadewataa tumhaare paas aakar tumse vivaah karnaa chaahate hai
 Whichever of these gods you accept as husband
 ’ nal ne donon haath jodakar kaha ki ‘devraj’ ! vahaan aap logon ke or mere jane kaa ek hi prayojan he
 That is why it is not appropriate that you send me as an angel
 jisaki kisi stri ko patni ke rup main paane kii ichha ho chuki ho, vah bhala, usko kaise chhod saktaa he or uske paas jaakar aisi baat kah hi kaise saktaa he ? aap log kripaya is vishay main mujhe kshamaa kijiye There was a Swayamvar of Damayanti in which not only the king of the earth, but also the gods came as a tap
 swayamvar main ek saath kai nal khadey the
 Everyone was upset about who the real tap would be
 lekin damyanti jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hui
 He recognized the real tap by eye
 saare devataaon ne bhi unka abhivadan kiya
 In this way, Damayanti recognized her real life and chose her life partner
 nav-dampatti ko devataaon kaa aashirwad praapt hua
 Damayanti nishad-naresh became the queen of King Nal
 donon bade sukh se samay bitaane lage
 Damyanti was a shiromani among husbandmen
 abhimaan to use kabhi chhu bhi na saktaa tha
 In time, a son and a girl were born from Damyanti's womb
 donon bachche mata-pita ke anuroop hi sundar rup or gunse sampann the
 Time does not always remain the same, the cycle of sorrow and happiness keeps going on
 vaise to maharaj nal gunavan, dharmatma tathaa punyashlok the, kintu unamem ek dosha tha —jue kaa vyasan
 One of Nal's brothers was named Pushkar
 vah nal se alag rahata tha
 He invited them for gambling
 khel armbh hua
 Luck was unfavorable
 nal haarane lage, sona, chaandi, rath, rajpaat sab haath se nikal gaya
 Knowing the unfavorable time, Queen Damayanti sent her two children to Kundinpur, the capital of Vidarbha country
 idhar nal jue main apana sarvasv haar gayi
 He removed all the clothes of his body
 keval ek vastra pahanakar nagar se baahar nikle
 Damayanti also followed her husband in just one sari
 ek din raja nal ne sone ke pankh vaale kuch pakshi dekhe
 King Nal thought, if these are captured, some money can be earned by selling them for sustenance
 aisa vichaarkar unhone apane pahanane kaa vastra kholkar pakshiyon par phenkaa
 Birds flew with the clothes
 ab raja nal ke paas tan dhakne ke liye bhi koi vastra na rah gaya
 Nal was more disturbed by Damayanti's misery than he was
 ek din donon jangal main ek vriksh ke neeche ek hi vastra se tan chipaaye pade the
 Damayanti fell asleep due to exhaustion
 raja nal ne sochaa, damyanti ko mere kaaran bada dukh sahan karnaa pad rahaa he
 If i leave it here at this stage, it will somehow reach its father
 yah vichaarkar unhone talwaar se uski aadhi sari ko kaat liya or usee se apana tan dhakkar tathaa damyanti ko usee avasthaa main chhod kar ve chal diye
 When Damyanti fell asleep, poor lady found herself alone and Karun started mourning
 bhukh or pyaas se vyakul hokar vah achaanak ajgar ke paas chali gayi or ajgar use nigalane laga
 Hearing Damyanti's scream, a hunter saved him from being a dragon
 kintu vyaadh swabhaav se dusht tha
 He was fascinated by the beauty of Damayanti and wanted to make him a victim of his job
 damyanti use shaap dete hue boli—‘yadi maine apane pati raja nal ko chhodkar kisi anya purush kaa kabhi chintan na kiya ho to is paapi vyaadh ke jivan kaa abhi ant ho jaay
 Hunter's death was reached as soon as Damayanti was fulfilled
 daivayog se bhatakate hue damyanti ek din chedinaresh subahu ke paas or uske baad apane pita ke paas pahunch gayi
 Finally, one day Maharaj Nal's sorrows also came to an end with the influence of the Satyatta of Damayanti
 donon kaa punarmilan hua or raja nal ko unka rajya bhi waapas mil gaya
 Nal and Damayanti had two twin sons Namah and Dal

 isamen khanijon ke bhautik or rasinic gunon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This branch of science also includes the formulation, composition, classification, mineralogy and location of minerals and their properties
 iske madhyam se hi khanijon ke prayog or upyog kaa bhi adhyayan isi main kiya jaataa he
 Like other branches of science, it originated several thousand years ago
 vartmaan khanij vigyaan kaa kshetra, kai duusari shakhaon jaise, jeev vigyaan or rasiniki tak vistrut ho gaya he
 The Greek philosopher Socrates first conceived the origin of minerals and their properties in principle, although Socrates and his contemporary thinkers later proved to be wrong but according to the time his theories were new and modern
 kintu ye kahana bhi atishyokti na hoga ki unki avadharanaon ke kaaran hi khanij vikaas kii jatiltaaon ko sulajhane main sahyog mila, jis kaaran aaj uske aadhunik rup se vigyaan samrudh he
 Mineralogy began to take a modern form after the 16th century due to the tireless efforts of German scientist Georgius Agricola
 khanij vigyaan ke bare main aarambhik lekhan, visheshkar ratna aadi ke bare main pracheen babylonia, pracheen yunaan-rome samrajyon, pracheen china or pracheen bharat ke sanskrit main uplabdh puranic sahitya main miltaa he
 Among the books available on this subject is Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia, which not only describes the various minerals, but also describes many of their properties
 german punarjagran visheshgy georgious agricola ne di re matelika or di nachura fosilium jaise kai granth diye hai, jinamein is vishay par vaigyanik pahaluon par vichaar kiya gaya he
 The post-renaissance era in Europe led to the development of systematic and systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks
 khanij vigyaan ke aadhunik rup kaa aadhaar 17veen shatabdi main sookshmdarshi yantra ke avishkaar crystalography ke siddhanton or shailon ke anubhag kaaton ke namoonon kaa sookshm adhyayan par hua
 The study and classification of the properties of minerals depends on their physical characteristics
 khanij kii kathorta kii jaanch ke liye moscale test kiya jaataa he
 The hardness or softness of a mineral depends on the configuration of the atoms in its internal structure
 itihaas main dekhen to, khanij vigyaan multah shail-ghatak khanijon ke vargeekaran par hi kendrit rahaa he
 The International Mineralogical Organization is an international organization, whose members are representative mineralogists of specific nations

 The development of technologies in recent years and the fast computing capability available, supported by the study of crystal behavior by modern computers and highly accurate atomic-scale simulations; Science has separated the s branch for in-depth study in the fields of inorganic chemistry and solid state physics
 phir bhi isamen ab bhi pashaan-nirmaan main lage khanijon kii crystal sanrachana par dhyaan kendrit rakhaa he
 In the development of this branch, atomic-scale studies of minerals and their functions have been highlighted
 is shakha ke antargat khanijon ke kai prakaar ke adhyayan kiye jate hai: Physical mineralogy pays special attention to the physical properties of minerals
 bhautik gunon kaa varnan unki pahchaan, vargeekaran, shrenigat karne main vishesh sahyogi rahata he
 The following points are noted in this: ab tak chaar hajaar se adhik khanijon kii khoj ho chuki he
 Most of these are now found to be few or few
 maatr 150 khanij hi aise hai, jo vartmaan main badi maatr main paae jate hai
 There are also some minerals, which are sometimes found only on some occasion or natural event, their number is between 50 and 100
 khanijon ke bare main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki ye keval prithvi kii sataha par paae jane vaale tatv hi nahin hai, varan bhugarbha main, sagar main, vaataavaran main bhi milte hai
 Many minerals are also beneficial for health

 In the context of jurisprudence, Samya or 'suniti' is a set of legal principles that complement stringent provisions of law
 saadhaaran nyaay ke anusaar sab logon ke saath nishpaksh or samaan bhav se kiya janevaala vyavhaar
 In a proverbial sense, Samya is considered synonymous with easy justice, but it would be misleading to think that the court will give its decision on all the subjects covered under natural justice

 In 195-96 it was said that this court is not a court of conscidence, that is, we cannot call this court investigating cases related to 'suniti'
 usee prasang main unhone kaha ki kanoon ne vihit un adhikaron ko hi yah nyaayalay karyanvit karegaa, jinke liye desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon paryaapt nahin he
 Thus, 'suniti' is that part of natural justice which, while still being enforceable by the courts, was implemented by the 'chancery' court due to historical reasons being implemented by the Courts of Common Law
 anyathaa tathy kii drushti se 'suniti' evam 'kaaman lau' main koi antar nahin
 In ancient times, morality and law were interlinked and embodied in the broader meaning of 'religion'
 hindu dharm ke chaar strot maane gaye hai-veda, smriti, sadachaar evam suniti
 The principles of Suniti have been inherent in 'justice'
 smriti ke vachan evam sadachaar kii vishad vivruti ke baavjood nyaay ke sabhi prashnon kaa nirnay dene ke liye maanya niyamon evam kanoon kii kalpanaaon kaa aashray liya jaataa rahaa he tathaa in par suniti kii chhap spasht he
 Smritiks had accepted that Sanatan Dharma could not by nature be widespread
 at: 'nyaay' ke siddhanton ko vibhinn paristhiyon main karyanvit karnaa hi hoga
 Yajnavalkya says that if the rules of law are incompatible with each other, justice, ie natural Suniti and tact will be recognized
 brihaspativaar ke anusaar keval dharm shaastra kaa hi aashray lekar nirnay dena uchit nahin hoga, kyonki yuktiheen vichaar se dharm kii haani hi hoti he
 Narada has also considered the importance of tact

 After the establishment of British rule in India, the decisions of the courts of this country came under the jurisdiction of the Privy Council as a final appeal
 at: england main viksit suniti kaa prabhaav hindu vidhaan par parilakshith hone laga
 The Privy Council, in Kentchuva v Girimalapya 519 A, 368, decided that if someone kills someone, that person will not be entitled to the property of the deceased
 saarvajanik niti par aadhaarit ukt niyam hinduon ke maamle main nyaay evam suniti kii drushti se lagu kiya gaya
 In different countries of the world where English rule has been in place for the last several centuries, the influence of English Suniti on the decision of their courts is clear
 at: england main suniti ke aitihaasik vikaas par kuch shabd aavashyak hai
 In the Middle Ages, the Secretariat of the King of England was called 'chancery' and his authority was known as 'chancellor'
 desh main maamalon kaa nirnay karne ke nimitt nyaayalayon ke rahane ke baavjood nyaay kii antim thati 'chanceri' raja main hi ashrith thi
 Therefore, in Chancery, applications often came that the applicant was poor, old and sick; But his opposition is rich and powerful
 isliye use ashanka he ki vipakshi juri ko ghoose degaa; apni prabhutaa se unhen bhay dikhalayegaa; athwa chaalaaki se usne kuch aisi paristhiti paidaa kar di he ki desh kaa saadhaaran nyaayalay use nyaay nahin de sakegaa
 Such application often praises God and religion in compassionate words dekar likhaa jaataa tha
 Chancellor removed the order in the name of the king and started presenting the opposition to him
 use shapath lekar aavedan kii fariyaad kaa uttar dena padataa tha
 From 1474 AD, the Chancellor began to give decisions independently and Suniti's development in Chancery Court started from here
 chanceri kii lokapriyata badhane lagi
 The main reason for this was that the Chancellor started resolving such cases for which there was no legislation in the ordinary court
 drushtaant ke liye nyaas ko le sakate hai
 In the context of deceit, accident, missing 'chancery' documents respectively and betrayal also came under his jurisdiction
 satarahavin shatabdi ke aarambh main chanceri evam kaaman lau ke nyaayalayon ke bich apane-apane adhikarashetra kaa prashn lekar vivaad upasthit hua; par antat: is baat ko manyata di gai ki chanceri nyaayalay kaa nirnay sarvopari hoga
 It is worth remembering in this context that the Court of Chancery did not directly rule on the Courts of Common Law
 usne keval safal vaadi ko vaaran kiya ki vah aniatik nirnay ko karyanvit na kare
 With the development of both these types of courts, the Chancellor's powers also became limited
 suniti ke siddhant sthir hue, jin par kaaman lau kii paridhi se baahar ke adhikaar aadhaarit the or jinke liye nidaansh apekshit tha
 In the year 1873-75 AD, two different methods of 'suniti' and Common Law became one by the internal law
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki kaaman lau ke nyaayalay vyadesh jari karne lage evam chanceri nyaayalay sanvida ke skhalan ke kaaran kshatipurti karaane laga, jaisaa purv main sambhav nahin tha
 That is, in any court of the country, the diagnosis of both common law and Suniti started to be received simultaneously
 san 1775 i
 ke baad yadi kisi maamle main suniti evam kaaman lau ke niyamon main kisi ek hi vishay ko lekar vishmata upasthit ho to suniti ke niyam kii manyata hogi
 But it is worth remembering that Suniti did not aim to destroy the common law of the country, but its goal was to fulfill it sometime
 udaahranarth, nyaas vyadesh, sanvida kii purti, evam mrit vyakti ke estate kaa prabandh suniti ke hi avdaan hai
 There was no diagnosis in the Court of Common Law for these subjects
 yah niyam suniti kaa aadhaar he
 This means that if there is any action, for which the court should give morality to the moral point of view, then the court will surely give the loan
 chanceri nyaayalay kaa aarambh isi aadhaar par hua
 The law of trust is a suitable illustration in this context

 1 chanceri 575 main ek company ne kiraaya-kharid kii shart par mashin kharidi
 It was decided that the owner of the machine would be the seller of the machine till the last installment was paid and he would have the right to pick up the machine if the installment broke
 company ke vyavsaay vaale makaan main mashin laga di gai, at: mashin kaa kaaman lau dwaara pradutt swatvadhikaar company kaa hua
 In the back, the company mortgaged the said house to a person who had no notice of 'hire-purchase' related to the machine
 ek maamla hua jisamen nyaayalay ne yah nirnay diya ki mashin hataakar le jane kaa adhikaar bhoomi main samyik swatvadhikaar tha
 Since it was first created in sequence, it has priority over the mortgagee's right to the house
 yadi koi vyakti is vishwaas main ki amuk jameen uski he, us par makaan banaata he evam jameen kaa vaastavik swatvadhikari makaan banate dekhakar bhi vaastavik sthiti se duusare vyakti ko avgat nahin karaata to makaan ban jane par bina isaki yathochit keemat die jameen kaa vaastavik maalik makaan praapt nahin kar saktaa
 The person who built a house with true trust, will have the right to the house related expenses on that property

 She would get that amount only when she was an adult
 vayask hone par usne phir trustee se ukt rakam kii maang kii
 Although the receipt of the minor is not considered confirmed, the court said that the trustee is not responsible for re-awarding the said amount
 jahaan daawa bahut purana ho chukaa he evam koi paksh apane swatv ko pun: hasil karne ke liye prastut nahin hua he tathaa usne vipakshi ke anadhikaar ko apni akarmanyata ke kaaran sweekaar kar liya he, aisi sthiti main suniti koi sahaayta nahin karegi
 But shall recognize the period of prosecution prescribed by law
 par yadi vaadi kii gafalat ke kaaran vah sakshya, jiske dwaara prativaadee maamle kaa jawaab detaa, nasht ho chukaa he to vilamb ghaatak hoga
 Ignorance of the subject, legally inability, lack of willingness, etc
 are the answers to 'delay'
 yadi sampatti kaa vibhaajan is prakaar kiya gaya ho ki k ko ek bhaag, kha ko paanch bhaag or ga ko chah bhaag mili hon, par ga apana bhaag na le sake, aisi sthiti main ecruer claj ke anusaar ga ke bhaag samaan rup se k or kha ko praapt honge
 That is, each will get three-three additional parts and the concept of inequality of fundamental division will not apply, because parity is Suniti
 yah siddhant rehan, shaasti, jabti evam anunay ke shabdon par aadhaarit nyaas ke mul main he
 When the question arises whether a property has been in possession or has been sold with the option that the seller can repurchase it, Suniti sees that the price is sufficient for the sale or No
 tathakthith khariddaar kaa sampatti par kabja hua yaa nahin
 Similarly, in a contract, if there is a condition that the guilty party will have to pay full penalty if it is not fulfilled, then Suniti sees that the amount of penalty was kept for the fulfillment of the contract or it is the amount of compensation
 yadi vaadi ne kisi moulik sanvida main apana bhaag is vishwaas main puraa kar diya he ki prativaadee bhi apana bhaag puraa karegaa, aisi sthiti main nyaayalay bahutha aisa aadesh detaa he ki prativaadee bhi apana bhaag puraa kare chunki prativaadee kaa aisa na karnaa anyaaypurna hoga
 Similarly, this principle is also reflected in the core of conversion
 is siddhant kii prishthbhumi aitihaasik he
 The Chancery Court initially did not interfere with the defendant's property
 keval use nyyochit kaary karne ko aadesh detaa tha
 If the defendant did not follow the order, the court punished him for contempt
 uski sampatti bhi japt kar lee jaati thi
 Even now Suniti's original jurisdiction rests on the presence of the plaintiff
 yadi maamle kii sampatti nyaayalay ke kshetradhikaar se baahar bhi ho, kintu prativaadee kshetradhikaar main he yaa us par kshetradhikaar se baahar bhi maamle ke nimitt samman jari karaayaa ja saktaa he evam vaadi ke maamle main naitik adhikaar he to nyaayalay prativaadee ke viruddh maamla avashya chalaaegaa
 But if there is a question of title in the land and the land is outside the jurisdiction of the court, then the court will not decide the subject

759 paanch sau sattasi dashamalav saat paanch nau The realization of two conflicting or totally different styles of personality in the same unit, while securing their separate power, is dualism
 ek hi vyakti ke ghere main rahakar bhi ye apane main susambaddha evam vyavasthit hote hai; ek duusare ke prati tatasth evam vismrit rahete hai
 When one personality block remains active on the surface of consciousness, the memory of the other is no longer available, although there are exceptions in the case of memory

 Even in psychiatry, in the formulation of the Kraschamar conscience 'sijaid' and 'cyclaid', the Kreplin alleged enthusiasm, sadness, psychosis and psychosis or psychosis etc
, confirms the same fact that the legislative attitude of the individual to associate the mind power with the external world
 And both the prohibitive instincts of pulling from the external world like a turtle and shrinking into the intestine, both work
 kisi ek kaa apekshaakrit adhik praadhanya vyaktitv ke 'prakaar' kaa nirupak hota he
 In 'duplex', sometimes there is a balance of both vrittis, which is an ideal situation, sometimes there is a situation of inordinate drift on both sides

 Dr
 Morton Prince put up a parable with full scientificity that became famous as 'beaushampcase'
 apane swaabhaavik vyaktitv tathaa sammohan dwaara jaagrath kiye gaye vyaktitv ke atirikt rogini ke andar teen or vibhinn dhang ke swatmbhaav dekhe gaye- sabhi paraspar asambaddha, bhinn evam virdohi se the
 Despite scientific completeness, Prince's analysis has been criticized for being pluralistic, extravagant and more anatomical
 macdugal ne 'dvivyaktitv' kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki inhen kabhi bhi saamaanya logon ke vyaavhaarik jeevanaster par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa kyonki vishesh paristhitiyon main yah ham sabamein ek chhipi sambhaavna ke rup main sthit he; iske vipareet yah kaha ja saktaa he ki har maanav man ekaaki evam sangathit purnataa he 
 Prior to Dr
 Prince Ellicott published the scientific description of such a patient for the first time and Po first presented the literature of the parables of 76 patients
 parvarti manovaigyanikon ne 'khandon' par kam or maansik ekta par adhik jor diya
 Freud has been sharply criticized for advocating a completely alienated subconscious of the subconscious, but the famous Freudist Ernest Jones brings this separation closer, saying that our repressed lusts, which are basically sexual in nature, begin to develop an independent form of themselves
 And sometimes become so intense that for some time, the Chetan dominates the surface

 yung kii kathy style main, 'achetan' main udbhoot prabhusatta ke sammukh chaitanya napunsak ho jaataa he
 Yung has described 'pseudo-memory' as a 'gland' of many old sensory memories that keep intervening as often as possible under Chetnaman's surface
 isse bhi dainandin vyaktijivan main aakasmik vilakshan kaa udai ho jaataa he
 Yung, who is a symbol of the duality of two bandits hanging on the side of a colony of the Holy Spirit like Jesus, understands that Jesus, who is the symbol of our collective 'body and personality', is going through all the opposing sentiments and enduring the suffering of Salib in his divinity

 James says that even in ordinary life, we forget about our promises, responsibilities taken, etc
 and bring a shocking change in our behavior to others

 At the level of psychiatry, this change happens on its own
 darshanik lock ne bahut pehle kaha tha ki smritiyaan badal jane se vyaktitv bhi badal jaataa he
 Freud's critic disciple Adler says that when a person's 'lifestyle' changes radically, the compiled pool of his old memories also changes accordingly

 Similarly for 17 consecutive years, he used to commit some crime, cut jail and returned to his former state

 She could not speak anything except a few words

 The place of sad used to be happy

 From 1953 to 1957, he worked in the Indian Union Ministry of Radio and Public
 1957 se 1959 tak unhone bharat ke amareeki duutavas main kaary kiya
 Frantic in correcting what he considered to be "a biased and broken narrative of Indian history by invaders and colonists", Oak has written several books and articles related to Indian history
 iske saath hi unhone bhartiya itihaas punarawalokan santhaan kii sthapana 14 june, 1964 ko kii
 According to Oak, modern and Marxist historians have imagined the "idealized account" of Indian history and removed all Vedic references and material from it
 ok ke yogadan, hindu dharm kii anya dharmon par varchasv evam apaar shreshthata siddh karne kii koshish karte hai
 While the doctrines of Oak have been widely disseminated and supported by many Hindu religious groups, it has not been accepted by any mainstream religious and architectural historians
 edwin brit ke anusaar, adhikansh pathak unhen keval ek afvaah hi maanate hai
 In his book Taj Mahal: Satya Katha, Oak has claimed that the Taj Mahal was originally a Shiva temple or a Rajputana palace, which was occupied by Shah Jahan and converted into a mausoleum
 ok kehete hai, ki kaise sabhi hindu mul kii kashmir se kanyakumari paryant imaaraton ko kisi naa kisi muslim shaasha yaa uske darbariyon ke saath, pher-badal karke yaa bina pherbadal ke, jod diya gaya he
 They included Humayun's Tomb, Akbar's Tomb and Etmaduddaula's Tomb, and most Indian Hindu historical buildings, even the Kaaba, Stonehenge and Vatican cities

 He even went on to say that construction details, financial data, and Shah Jahan's construction orders, etc
, are all just a trap, whose purpose is only to erase its Hindu origins

 PN Oak, in his book "taj Mahal a Hindu Temple", claims more than a hundred alleged evidences and arguments that the Taj Mahal was actually a Shiva temple with the original name 'tejomahalaya'
 ok sahab yah bhi maanate hai ki is mandir ko jaipur ke raja maansingh ne banwaaya tha jise tod kar tajmahal banwaaya gaya
 Their following arguments in this regard are worth considering: ok ne yachika daayar kii, jisamen unhone taj ko ek hindu smarak ghoshit karne evam kabron tathaa cield kakshon ko kholane, va yah dekhne ki unamem shiv ling, yaa anya mandir ke avshesh hai, yaa nahin; kii apil kii
 According to him, the refusal of this act of the Indian government meant conspiracy against the Hindu religion
 san 2000 main bhartiya sarvocch nyaayalay ne ok kii is yachika ko ki taj ko ek hindu raja ne nirmaan karaayaa tha radd kar diya or saath hi inhen jhidki bhi di, ki unke dimag main taj ke liye koi keedaa he
 In 2005, one such petition was also quashed by the Allahabad High Court, in which Amarnath Mishra, a social worker, claimed that the Taj was built in 1196 by the Hindu king Parmar Dev
 unki sweekrut itihaas se ulat, shri ok ne daawa kiya he, ki islam evam isai dharm, donon hi vaidic dharm ke tod-marode gayi rup hai
 In support of these, he has also given a glossary

 Therefore, similar binoculars are used in the construction of ordinary binocular telescopes
 saadhaaran dwinetri doordarshee ko natya doorabeen kehete hai
 Unlike telescopes, binoculars offer a three-dimensional image to the user: when viewing relatively close objects, the viewer presents images from a slightly different perspective to both eyes that together combine the depth effect

 It seems that with the invention of the telescope in the 17th century, the benefits of binocular vision derived from two such telescopes came to be discovered
 sabase shuruaati doorabine gallilian prakaashiki kaa prayog karti thim; ve ek uttal objective lens tathaa avatal ipis lens kaa prayog karti thim
 The advantage of Galilean design is that the image obtained is straightforward but the field of view is narrow and its magnification is not very high
 is prakaar ke nirmaan kaa prayog abhi bhi kaaphi saste modelon main tathaa opera glasson va theatre glasson main kiya jaataa he
 a better image and higher magnification can be obtained using Keplerian optics, in which the image obtained from the objective lens is viewed with a positive eyepiece lens
 is vinyas kaa ek nuksaan yah he ki praapt chhavi ulti hoti he
 There are many ways to overcome these shortcomings
 poro prism doorabeenon kaa naam italy ke prakaashiki vidvan ignazio poro ke naam par rakhaa gaya he jinhone is chhavi sudhaar pranali ko 1854 main patent karavaaya or baad main karl zius jaise nirmaataaon dwaara 1890 ke dashak main isamen sudhaar kiya gaya
 This type of telescope uses a z-shaped double poro prism configuration to straighten the image
 is vishistataa ke prayog se chaudee doorabeenon ko aise objective lens ke saath bana paanaa sambhav hota he jo kaaphi dur hote hai kintu ipis dwaara samyojit hote hai
 Another advantage of the Poro prism design is that they shorten the light path due to which the actual length of the telescope is shorter than the focal length of the objective lens and the increased distance between the two objects gives a better sense of depth
 
 esile victor emil dobres dwaara 1870 main di gayi dizine ke parinamswarup ruf prism aadhaarit doorabine aayin
 Most roof prism-based telescopes use either the abbe-könig prism or the schmidt-pechon prism to straighten the image and shorten the light path
 inamen aise objective lens hote hai jo ipis kii lagbhag sidh main hote hai
 Roof prism design allows the manufacture of such devices which are thinner and smaller than the poro prism
 yahaan chhavi kii chamak main bhi antar aata he
 Porro prism-based telescopes achieve a much brighter image than roof-prism based telescopes with the same magnification, object size, and equivalent optics quality, this is because the surface surface used in the roof prism design is that of light
 Reduces transmission from 12% to 15%
 ruf prism dizine vaali doorabeenon ko apane prakashkeey tatwon ke sarekhan main adhik sookshmata kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such a situation, their price increases because their design is based on setting them at a higher collimation with certain components in the factory itself
 poro prism vaali doorabeenon main unke prism ko kabhi kabhi punahrekhit karnaa hota he jisase ki colimation ko punarprapt kiya ja sake
 The roof design with a stable crossing means that they will usually never need collimation again
 doordarshee kii dizine aamtaur par vishisht anuprayog ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These different designs produce certain optical parameters
 These parameters are: ipis kii focal lambaai ko objective kii focal lambaai se vibhajit karne par praapt anupaat doorabeen kii rekhiy aavardhan shakti kehalaata he 
 udhaaharan ke liye aavardhan shakti 7 ke gunak main hone kaa arth yah hota he maano dekhne vaala vyakti dekhi ja rahi vastu ko 7 guna nikat se dekh rahaa ho
 The amount of magnification depends on what application the telescope is made for
 chunki haath main pakad kar prayog kii jane vaali doorabeenon main aavardhan kam hota he atah ve kampan ke prati kam samvedansheel hoti hai
 Visible magnification makes the visual field smaller
 objective lens kaa vyas yah nirdhaarit karata he ki ek chhavi banane ke liye kitna prakaash ekatrit kiya ja saktaa he
 This number directly affects performance
 jab aavardhan or gunvattta baraabar hoti hai, doorabeen kii duusari sankhya jitani badi hoti he, praapt chhavi tani hi ujjwal tathaa spasht hoti he
 Thus images obtained by an 8X40 will be brighter and clearer than an 8X25, although both will magnify an image only eight times
 8x40 main saamne ke bade lens prakaash ke bade punj utpann karenge jo ipis main jaayenge

 It is usually expressed in millimeters
 prathagat rup se doorabeenon kaa shreneekaran aavardhan x objective ke vyas ke rup main kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye 7X50 
 The field of view of a telescope is determined by its optical design
 ise rekhiy maan se vyakt kiya jaataa he, jaise 1000 gaz se dekhne par kitne feet chaudaai dikhaai degi, athwa kitne degree kaa koniya maan dekha ja saktaa he
 The telescope concentrates the light received by the object as a mass, the exit pupil whose diameter is obtained by dividing the diameter of the object by the magnifying power
 sabase acchhee prakaash grahyata tathaa ujjwal chhavi ke liye exit pupil kaa vyas ek puri tarah faili maanviya aankh kii putali ke aakaar kaa hona chahie jo lagbhag 7 mimi hota he tathaa aayu ke saath kam hoti jaati he
 If the light cone emanating from the telescope will be larger than the size of the pupil of the eye into which it has to enter, then any light other than the size of the pupil will be wasted, meaning the eyes will not get any information through it
 The pupil of the eye expands about 3 mm during the day, which is equivalent to the exit pupil of the 7X21 telescope
 adhik bade 7x50 doorabeen putali se zyada bade prakaash shanku kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo ki din ke samay vyarth ho jaati he
 Therefore, carrying a large device does not seem particularly useful
 However, a large exit pupil makes it easier to position the eye from where it can receive light: the eye can be placed anywhere in the light cone
 aankh lagane kii yah aasaani chhavi ko aspasht hone se bachaati he, jo ki prakaash kaa maarg aanshik rup se avaruddh hone par kaalepan athwa dhundhalepan ke rup main ho saktaa he
 And, it also means that the image can be found quickly which is important when viewing more dynamic games of birds or animals
 sankeern exit pupil vaali doorabine shighrata se thakaa sakati hai kyanki sahi chhavi praapt karne ke liye upkaran ko thik ankhon ke saamne hona chahie
 Finally, many people use their binoculars in the evening, during twilight, and at night when their pupils are large
 is prakaar din ke samay kaa exit pupil hameshaa sabase upyogi maanak nahin hota he
 Large telescopes with large exit pupils are a satisfying choice for convenience, ease of use, and variation in applications, although their potential may not be fully utilized during the day
 ai relif pichley ipis lens se eczit pupil athwa netra bindu ke bich kii duuri ko kaha jaataa he
 This is the distance a viewer has to place between his or her eye from the eyepiece so that he or she can get a clear image
 ipis kii focal lambaai jitani badi hogi, ai relif utani hi adhik hogi
 Eye relief in binoculars can range from a few millimeters to 2
5 centimeters or more
 chashma pahanane waalon ke liye ai relif vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hoti he
 The eye of the person wearing glasses is usually away from the eyepiece of the telescope, which makes it necessary that the eye relief of the telescope is high so that the person can see the entire field of view
 choti ai relif vaali doorabeenon ke prayog main vahaan adhik dikkat ho sakati he jahaan unhen sthirataa pakadaney main mushkil ho
 The nearest focus distance is the least distance the telescope can focus
 yah duuri 1 meter se 30 meter tak ho sakati he or yah doorabeen ke dizine par nirbhar karti he
 Since the objects that telescopes are used to see are not at a fixed distance, it is necessary to have a focusing mechanism so that the distance between vision and objective lenses can be changed
 paramparaagat rup se, focus karne ke liye do alag alag vyavasthaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In telescopes that have an "independent focus", two different telescopes focus independently of their eyepiece
 paaramparik rup se baari field prayog, udhaaharan ke liye sainya anuprayogon ke liye, swatantra focus vaali doorabeenon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since normal users find it more convenient to focus both tubes of the telescope with a single adjustment, a second type of telescope uses a "central focus" that has a central focusing wheel to adjust both tubes simultaneously

 After this adjustment has been made for a particular individual, both tubes are focused with the focusing wheel to see objects located at different distances and the eyepiece does not have to be adjusted again

 Most adults have the same distance between the two pupils
 kai doorabine "focus free" athwa "phixd focus" vaali hotin hai, jinamein focus karne kii koi yantrawali nahin hoti he
 Their design is for a static field of view that ranges from relatively close objects to infinity with a large hyperfocal distance

 Some binoculars provide adjustable magnification, called zoom binoculars, with the aim of keeping the user with the same binoculars and achieving different magnification levels using a "zoom" lever
 aisa karne ke liye lenson ke samaayojan kii ek jatil shrinkhalaa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaisaa ki zum camera lenson main kiya jaataa he
 These designs are considered compromised or juggle as they increase the size, complexity and fragility of the telescope
 jatil prakaashiya path ke kaaran drishy kshetra kam ho jaataa he tathaa ucch zum ke str par chamak kam ho jaati he
 In models of this type, it is necessary to maintain equal magnification for both eyes throughout the zoom range, and also to keep the eye synchronized to avoid stress and fatigue
 doorabeenon main image sthirikaran takanic kaa prayog karte hue chhavi ko hilne se bachaaya tathaa ucch aavardhan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The components that change the image are held firmly in place by an energy-driven gyroscope or mechanics that operate with gyroscopes or stability testing devices, many times they are positioned so that they Actions do the opposite of effect
 sthirikaran ko prayogkarta kii ichha ke anukool shuru yaa band kiya ja saktaa he
 With these techniques, binoculars can be handheld with magnification up to 20X, as well as increasing the quality of image stabilization in low power devices

 a well-converged telescope, when viewed with the human eye and processed by the human brain, should show a single, distinctly three-dimensional image and not look like two different images being viewed from a slightly different perspective
