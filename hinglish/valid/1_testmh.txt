 The film starts from the present when Raju is being released from jail and then the story goes on in the past
 raju ek guide he, jo paryatakon ko aitihaasik sthalon main ghumaakar apni kamai karata he
 One day, a rich and old archaeologist Marco arrives in the city with his young wife Rosie, the daughter of a prostitute
 marco shahar ke baahar gufaaon main kuch shodh karnaa chahta he or apane guide ke rup main raju ko kaam detaa he
 He discovers a new cave and is so lost in his work that Rosie ignores him
 jab marco gupha kii khoj main laga hua he, raju rozi ko saiyr sapate ke liye le jaataa he or uske nrity kshamta or maasoomiyat kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa karata he
 Rosie tells Raju that she is the daughter of a prostitute and how she became Marco's wife in order to gain respect in society, but has paid a huge price for it because she has a passion for dance while Marco is strongly disliked
 is bich, rozi jehar khaakar aatmahatya karne kii koshish karti he
 Upon receiving the news of this incident, Marco comes back from the caves and is quite annoyed to see Rosie recovering and tells Rosie that her attempt to commit suicide was a drama, otherwise she would have had more sleeping pills if she really wanted to die
 She could easily do this after eating
 ek din jab rozi gufaaon main jaati he to paati he ki marco ek adivasee ladki ke saath prem rach rahaa he
 Rosie and Marco have heard a lot about this and Rosie once again tries to commit suicide
 raju use samajhaata he ki aatmahatya paap he or vah apana sapana puraa karne ke liye zindaa rahe
 Rosie breaks up with Marco, but now she needs a place to hide her head and also the support of someone who gives her Raju
 raju ke samudaay main rozi ko bhi veshya hi mana jaataa he 
 Raju's mother and maternal uncle urge him to take Rosie out of the house but Raju refuses, so his mother leaves him and goes to live with his brother
 uskaa mitra or driver gaffoor bhi rozi ko lekar usase kinaaraa kar letaa he
 Raju's income ends and the entire city turns against him
 in sabake baavjood raju rozi ko ek gayak or nrutyaangna banane ke liye protsaahit karata he or uski madad karata he
 And soon Rosie becomes a star
 jyon-jyon rozi nai oonchaaiyaan chooti he, raju aawaragardi karne lagata he or use jue or nashe kii lat lag jaati he
 Now Marco comes back again
 roji ko waapas jeetne kii koshish karne ke man se, vah rozi se milane aata he or phulon kaa guladasta laata he
 Raju collides with her in the middle and Raju takes a bouquet of flowers from her
 marco raju se kahata he ki rozi ke kuch gahane he jo ek loker main jamaa hai or jinako nikaalane ke liye rozi ke hastakshar chahiyein
 Raju, in the fear that if Marco and Rosie meet again, does not re-establish their relationship, Rosie forged signatures in the locker papers, but does not allow Marco to meet Rosie
 is bich raju or rozi ke sambandhon main khatas aa jaati he jab vah raju ko apane paas aane se bhi manaa kar detii he or kahati he ki agar raju uske qareeb aayaa to vah baahar chali jaayegi
 Before this both of them had a debate and Rosie remembered Marco saying that perhaps Marco was right that the man should not live in a woman's income
 jawaab main raju kahata he ki yah rozi kii galatafahami he ki vah apane boote main star ban gayi he or usko star banane main raju kaa bhi bada haath he
 After some time, Rosie finds out the forgery
 raju ko do saal kii sazaa ho jaati he
 Rosie does not understand why Raju did the forgery while he can ask for money directly from Rosie
 raju ne paise kii khaatir nahin balki rozi ke pyaar main aisa kadam uthaaya tha kyonki vah marco or rozi ko milane nahin dena chahta tha
 Now the film returns to the present

 He spreads this thing throughout the village
 gaanv vaale use sadhu maan lete hai or uske liye khaanaa or anya uphaar lekar aate hai or apni samasyaayein bhi usko bataate hai
 Now Raju comes to be known as Swamiji in that village and he also has differences with the Pandits of the village
 gaanv waalon ko ek kahani sunaate huye raju unako ek sadhu ke bare main bataata he ki ek baar ek gaanv main akaal pad gaya tha or us sadhu ne 12 din tak upwas rakhaa or us gaanv main barish ho gai
 Incidentally, there is a famine in the area of that village
 gaanv kaa ek murkh raju se vaartalap ke dauraan sunata kuch or he or gaanv waalon ko aakar bataata he ki swami ji ne varsha ke liye 12 din kaa upwas karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Raju falls into the fold
 pehle to raju iskaa virodh karata he
 He even tells Bhola that he is a prosecutor who has been punished because of a girl
 lekin is par bhi gaanv waalon kii us par se aasthaa kam nahin hoti he or vah kukhyat daaku ratnakar kaa udhaaharan dete hai jo aage chalakar valmiki ke naam se prasiddh hote hai
 Eventually Raju agrees to fast, although he does not believe that there is a relationship between a man keeping fast and rain
 lekin upwas ke dauraan raju kaa aadhyatmik vikaas hota he or uski khyaati dur-dur tak fail jaati he
 Thousands of visitors start coming to seek his blessings
 uski khyaati sunakar rozi, uski maan or uskaa dost gaffoor bhi usase milane aate hai
 Gafoor does not allow Bhola to enter the temple because he belongs to another religion
 raju madhyasthata karata he or kahata he ki insaaniyat, prem or paroapkaar hi uskaa dharm he
 Gradually, Raju's condition becomes critical
 aakhir main barahawein din varsha hoti he lekin raju kaa nidhan ho jaataa he
 While on one hand the villagers are jubilantly outside the temple, on the other hand, inside the temple, their relatives celebrate the mourning of his death

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega

 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag

 On January 25 too, he inspired people to abandon untouchability as a great sin in the context of this incident, and on January 26, at a reception organized by traders in Madura, he said that i am believing that this misfortune on us is due to untouchability

 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people

 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period
 isamen aatma yaa chetana ke chaar avasthaaon kaa varnan miltaa he - jaagrath, swapn, sushupti or turiya
 This Upanishad of only twelve mantras encompassed in the first ten Upanishads is the smallest among them in terms of size but has a higher place in terms of importance, as these mantras have been filled in the form of the Navneetha Sutra of spiritual learning without recitation
 is upanishad main uun kii matraaon kii vilakshan vyakhya karke jeev or vishwa kii brahm se utpatti or lay evam teenon kaa tadatmya athwa abhed pratipaadit hua he

 Andromeda Tarapunja The earliest recorded observations were made in 964 BCE by the Persian astronomer, Abad al-rahman al-sufi, who interpreted it as a "small cloud" in his epistemological book
 us samay ke anya tara chitron main ise little cloud ke rup main ankit kiya gaya tha
 The first description of the planet was made in 1612 by German astronomer Simone Marius, based on observations made by binoculars
 charles mesir ne ise 1764 main M31 grah ke rup main soochibaddh kiya or iskaa khojakarta ke rup main shrey galati se marius ko diya gaya, jo sufi al ke pehle kaary se anbhigya the
 In 1785, astronomer William Herschel noted the blurred red color in the core area of M31
 unka maananaa tha ki yah "mahaan nebula" main sabase nikatatam he or nebula ke rang or aakaar ke aadhaar par unhone galat anumaan lagaaya ki yah sirius kii duuri kii tulana main 2000 guna se adhik bada nahin he
 In 1864, William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and found it to be different from the gaseous nebula
 M31 ke spectra aavritiyon kii nirantarata ke liye pradarshit gahari avasorana rekhaon kaa nirmaan parat ke rup main karti he jo kisi padaarth ke rasinic mishran kii pahchaan karne main madad karte hai
 The Andromeda Nebula was very similar to the spectra of different stars that originated in which the M31 had a stellar nature
 1885 main, supernova ko pehali baar M31 main dekha gaya, jise is tarapunj main keval ek hi baar dekha gaya
 M31 was thought to be the closest planet at the time, so the object was close to an idea, so this fantasy could not gain much popularity, and this unrelated event was called Nova and named it "nova 1885"
 Gone

 jiske parinamswaroop us samay surya kii disha 300 kilometres per second main iskaa veg bahut adhik tej record kiya gaya
 In 1917, the American astronomer Heber Curtis saw the Nova in M31
 Searching for photo records, he discovered 11 more novels
 curtis ne dekha he ki un novon kaa ausatan aakaar tarapunj main sthit novon ke aakaar se 10 guna dhundhala tha
 As a result, he could be seen from an estimated 500,000 light years away
 isliye vah tathakthith "dweepiya brahmad" pariklpana prastaavak ban gaya, jo is sarpilaakaar nebula tha vastav main vah swatantra tarapunj tha
 In 1920, a great debate began between Harley Sharpley and Curtis concerning the galaxy, the spiral nebula, and the dimensions of the universe
 mahaan andromeda nebula bahya tarapunj tha, daawey ke samarthan main curtis ne hamaare tarapunj main dhundhale badalon se milti julati gahari rekhaon kii banaavat dekhi evam vishesh dopalar shift ko dekha gaya
 In 1922, Ernest Opik presented a very beautiful and simple astronomical method of estimating the distance of M31
 usne hamaare tarapunj ko andromeda se lagbhag 450 kepisi rakhaa, jo lagbhag 1500 keelvai he
 Edwin Hubel began this debate in 1925 when he first identified various cepheid stars beyond the Akash Ganga for an astrophysical image of M31

 However, the rate of star formation in the galaxy is much higher than that of M31 with only one solar body generated per year as compared to 3–5 solar bodies in the Milky Way
 akashganga main supernove kii dar M31 kii lagbhag doguni he
 It is revealed that M31 may have had a great composition phase in the past but it is quieter than before but the star formation seems to be more active than it is in the galaxy
 kya yah chalata rahegaa, to akashganga kii chamak bhavishya main M31 kii tulana main adhik tej ho sakati he
 Based on its design in visible light, the Andromeda galaxy is classified as sab and the spiral galaxies system as de vécoleurs-sandéz
 However, data from Survey 2MASS showed that the structure of M31 emerged from a box
 Which means that the galaxy is actually seen to be linearly reflected almost as its vertical axis
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne kek telescope kaa upyog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki taron kaa timatimaana akashganga ke baahar kii ore badhata jaataa he jo vastav main mukhya discs kaa hi ek hissaa he
 This means that the spiral disk of stars in Andromeda is three times larger than the previous estimate
 nirantar saakshyon se pataa chalata he usamen ek vishaal taarakeey discs he jo akashganga ke vyas ko 220,000 prakaash varsh se adhik badhaati he
 Previously, the size of Andromeda was estimated to be around 70,000 to 120,000 light years
 akashganga prithvi kii tulana main ek taraf lagbhag 77 ° jhuki hui he 
 akashganga kii tiryak kaat ke aakaar kaa vishleshan use samtal discs kii tulana main ek ati spasht, S-aakaar jhukaav ko darshata he
 Possible reasons for such an inclination may be satellite galaxy gravity near M31
 akashganga M33 main M31 ke kaaran kuch jhukaav sambhav he, haalanki yah uski yathavat duuri or trigyakaar vegon par nirbhar karata he
 In the section of the spectroscopy study, different rotational velocity measurements of M31 are explained
 uske antarvaaag ke nazadik, vibhinn 1,300 prakaash varsh prakaash varsh kii trigya par 225 kilometres per second kii ucchata vaale ghurnankaree veg main dekhe gaye hai or tab usamen 7,000 prakaash varsh kii nunatam giravat dekhi gai he jiskaa ghurnankaree veg 50 kilometres per second tak ho saktaa he
 Thereafter, its velocity steadily increases to a radius of 33,000 light years, reaching a peak of 250 kilometres per second
 duuri badhane ke saath-saath iske veg main giravat aati chali jaati he, jisamen 200 kilometres per second se 80,000 prakaash varsh kii giravat sambhav he
 These velocities measure the concentric mass in the navel to be approximately 6 × 109 M☉

 Andromeda's spiral arm extends to the h II region, which Bade has interpreted as "scattered beads of beads"
 ve aapas main bahut adhik sate hue dikhaai padate hai, haalanki ve hamaari akashganga main dur-duure tak faile hue hai
 Refined images of the Milky Way clearly depict a two-arm galaxy rotating clockwise

 In Andromeda, gas and dust form many annular forms, which form a ring especially with a radius 32,000 light years from its core
 yah valay akashganga ke drishyman prakaash chhaviyon se chipa hua he kyonki yah mukhya rup se thandi dhul se bana dhul se bana he
 On examining the inner region of Andromeda, small particles have been detected in its ring and it is thought that this may have occurred as a result of exposure to M32 200 million years ago
 iskaa anukaran karne par pataa lagata he ki choti akashganga uttararddh ke dhruviya dhuree ke saath andromeda kii discs guzari

 Studies of the enhanced halo of M31 showed that it is not possible to compare it to the Milky Way because the aura of stars usually contains "insufficient metals" that increase as the distance increases
 in saakshyon se pataa chalata he ki donon akashganga samaan vikasvaadi path kaa anusaran karti hai
 They have assimilated or incorporated 1-200 low-mass galaxies during the last 12 billion years
 M31 ke vistaarit prabhamandal main taron or akashganga main do akashgangaon ko alag karne vaali lagbhag ek tihaai duuri main vruddhi sambhav he
 M31 is known as a dense and small star cluster at its center

 Its eccentricity is such that the stars are attached to the orbital aposcenter, which increases the orientation of the stars
 P2 main garm varnakrameey varg a taron kii saghan chakrika he
 a star redness filter is unclear but in blue and ultraviolet light they affect the nucleus due to which P2 appears to be more effective than P1
 jabaki, isaki aarambhik khoj ke samay, yah pariklpana kii gai thi ki dabl cendrak kaa chamkila bhaag andromenda ke paas choti akashganga "kenibeliced" kaa shesh bhaag tha, jiske baad uski koi spasht vyakhya nahin kii gai
 The basic reason for this is that this type of nucleus has a very short lifetime due to the fluctuating disruption of the central black hole
 jabaki iskaa aanshik rup se samdhaan sambhav he yadi P1 ke paas uskaa apana sthir karne vaala blike hole ho P1 main uthal-puthal kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uske centre main blike hole he
 In particular, no X-rays of the galaxy were taken until the end of 1968

 Among these masses, Mayol II was identified as the largest giant, nicknamed the globular one, with a more massive cluster than any other common cluster of galaxies
 isamen kai million taare hai or isaki chamak omega senturi ke tulana main doguni he jo akashganga main sabase chamkile golakaar punj ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Globular 1 has many stellar numbers and is too dense for the normal spheroid
 jiske parinamswaroop, kuch log G1 ko choti akashganga kaa chota bhaag maanate hai jise kuch samay pehle M31 mana gaya tha
 The most pronounced glare of the globular is similar to that of the G76, which is located in the southeastern part of its eastern part
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne M31 main tara punj ke ek puri tarah se bhinn prakaar kii khoj kii
 The discovered New Star Punja consisted of millions of stars and in these same circular stars a similar number of other stars can be discovered
 unhen vartulakaar samoohon se bhinn kya karata he jisase ki ve adhik - kai sau prakaash varsh bade hai - or unase kai guna kam ghaney hai
 Therefore, the distance between the wires is much higher in the recently discovered extended masses
 akashganga ke samaan, andromeda akashganga main upgrah akashganga hai jinaki sankhya 14 choti akashganga he
 The best known and most visited satellite galaxies are M32 and M110
 vartmaan sakshya ke aadhaar par, aisa lagata he ki M32 kaa M31 ke saath bada hi nazadiiki saamana hua
 The M32 would have been a much larger galaxy ever since, after which the M31 removed its stellar image, and the formation of a star in its core grew rapidly, ending after that
 M110 bhi M31 ke sampark main aayaa hoga or khagolavidon ne M31 ke prabhamandal main dhaatu se bharpoor taron ke kii khoj kii jo in upgrah akashgangaon se rekha ke rup main dikhain detii hai
 There is no dust of the M110 which points towards recent and current star design

 Residents here played an important role in the uprising of 1857
 inamen mukhya krantikari the- choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan
 Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan along with their supporters were put to death because of their involvement in revolution against the British
 lekin unki shahadat ko hapur ke nivasee aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The Martyr's Fair is organized every year since 1975 AD in Hapur to commemorate the revolutionaries who died in 1857
 jo 10 may se shuru hokar ek maah tak chalata he
 This type of fair associated with 1857 is not held anywhere else in the whole country
 choudhary jabardast khan kaa parivaar multah asoda gaanv kaa rahane vaala tha jo apni jameendaari hone ke kaaran baad main hapur ke muhalla bhanda pattee main rahane lage
 Chaudhary had seven brothers, including Zahir Khan, Samast Khan, Ulfat Khan, Amjad Khan, Groom Khan, and a sister
 malagarh ke nawab validaad khan tathaa choudhary jabardast khan ke madhya dostana sambandh the
 "the son of Nawab Walidad Khan was married to the only daughter of Nawab Muzaffarnagar
 baraat malagarh se mujffarnagar ke liye ravaanaa hui
 The procession was to pass through Hapur as it was on the way
 yahan aane par nawab validaad khan ne choudhary jabardast khan ko baraat kaa mukhiya banaakar bheja or swayan waapas laut gaye
 This incident confirms the friendly relationship between the two
 nawab mujffarnagar dwaara baraat tathaa choudhary jabardast khan kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 The procession stayed at Nawab Muzaffarnagar for more than two months, even the people who used to get the information of the procession are not allowed to return, due to which the number of the processions increased considerably
 nawab validaad ke sthaan par choudhary jabardast khan ne var ke pita kaa uttardatiytav nibhaayaa
 The Nawab was the only daughter of Muzaffarnagar, so the Nawab surrendered his entire property to his girl and son-in-law
 " Our guess is that Walidad Khan would not have been able to go to the son's wedding due to his involvement in some secret and very important work, and that this work would not have been scheduled in advance, but it would have suddenly taken place
 yadi is kaary vishesh kaa pehle se abhas bhi hota, to nawab validaad shah kii tithi peeche hataa sakate the
 Also, work will be of such great importance that at the time of marriage, they could neither postpone the marriage nor delay the work
 aakhir prashn uthta he ki yah kaary vastav main kya tha? hamaara mat he ki yah kaam or kuch na hokar 1857 kii kranti kaa prasphuton se purv isaki yojana athwa iske yojanakaaron se sampark sambandhit rahaa hoga
 The evidence group under the then circumstances reinforces the presumption that the time of marriage will be around the spring of 1857
 is par vichaar karne se sahaj hi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Historians are unanimous that a sudden revolution erupted from Meerut on 10 May 1857
 atah aise main yah sakshyasangat na hoga ki iske prasphuton kaa validaad khan ko purv abhas ho
 Therefore, it can be easily arrived at the conclusion that the date of marriage must have been long before the 10th of May
 aisa maan lene par pita validaad khan ne apni putr kii shaadi main amuly samay nasht karne kii apeksha yah uchit samajha hoga ki yojanakaaron se sampark sthapit kar kranti main apni bhoomika nirvahan kiya jaye

 Walidad Khan and Jatiyar Khan planned to attack the British at Hapur, but the plan could not be implemented due to the supporters of the British and the Jats of Bhatona village in Bulandshahr district

 It is believed that Chaudhary Tremendous Khan was hanged thrice, but on three occasions the noose was broken
 yah dekhakar british adhikari wilson ne aashcharya vyakt kiya or jabardast khan ko usne jivit chhodane kaa man bana liya
 Chaudhary tremendous Khan was removed from the gallows and ordered to be fed on his water
 parantu jabardast khan ke virdohi nahin chaahate the ki use jinda choda jaye
 He prayed to the British officer that if Chaudhary tremendous Khan was left alive, he would not leave us alive
 kyonki unhone kranti ke dauraan choudhary jabardast khan ke viruddh britaniyon kii madad kii thi, atah unki vinati ko wilson ne sweekaar kar liya
 When tremendous Khan was drinking water, he shot at his temple
 choudhary jabardast khan desh ke liye shahid ho gayi
 The British officer also ordered the confiscation of his entire property and the death penalty to other family members

 Any combination of Scotch whiskey prior to SWR merited mixed Scotch whiskey, for example single malt Scotch whiskey
 Nonetheless, blended Scotch whiskey under SWR is defined as a combination of one or more single malt Scotch whiskeys with one or more single grain Scotch whiskey Scotch whiskey that aligns with traditional practice

 In addition to banning the production of a whiskey other than Scotch whiskey in Scotland, it is also prohibited to mature or blend whiskeys other than Scotch whiskey in Scotland
 aisa un sharaabon par "whisky-scotland main paripakv" athwa "whisky-scotland main mishrit" jaise vivaranon se bachane ke liye kiya gaya he, jo scoch whisky nahin hai
 And then, doing so will also help in maintaining "scotch whiskey" as a distinct product

 The average blended whiskey is 60% –85% grain whiskey
 ek hi bhatti vaale kuch ucch gunvattta vaale grain whisky ko ekal grain whisky ke rup main bottleband kiya jaataa he
 Watted malt whiskey — also called pure malt — is one of the most common types of scotch: it is a mixture of more than one oven and single malt at different times

 Most malt furnaces sell a significant amount of whiskey via mixing keg and sometimes to private buyers
 Whiskey from these casks is sometimes bottled as single malt by independent firms like Duncan Taylor, Master of Malt, Gordon & mcphail, Cadenheads, The Scotch Malt Whiskey Society, Murray mcdevid, Signatory, Douglas Laying and others

 Whiskey has been produced in Scotland for hundreds of years
 galic "usquebaugh" kaa arth he "jivan kaa pani", jo dhvanyatmak rup se "aski" or phir angrezi kaa "whisky" ban gaya
 According to the Scotch Whiskey Association, no one knows for sure when the furnace art first began to prevail in Scotland; It is known that ancient celts used to grate, and the fluids produced by them — called Uiseg Beetha in ancient Gallic — evolved into Scotch whiskey
 gyarahavin shatabdi tak scotland main sarvapratham praarambhik isai mathvaasi sthanon par stravikaran hua
 Whiskey production was first taxed in 1644, leading to an increase in the illegal whiskey furnace in the country
 Around 1780, there were about 8 legal and 400 illegal furnaces

 The popularity of whiskey was helped by two developments: first, the introduction of a new production process called coffee or patent dag in 1831; The whiskeys produced under this process were less dense and smooth

 Malt whiskey should not contain any grains other than malted barley, and it should be secreted in the same way as the dag containers
 Grain whiskey may contain unmalted barley or other malted or non-malted grains, such as wheat and maize, and are usually secreted into a regular column dag familiar as a patent or coffee dag, the second of which Ennis is on the lines of Coffey, who refined the column dag in 1831
 jabaki vahaan kai malt whisky bhattiyaan maujuud hai, varttman main vidyaman grain bhattiyon kii sankhya keval saat hi hai, jinamein se zyaadaatar scottish tarai kshetra main avasthit hai
 Malt whiskey is produced when barley is malted by soaking it in water, after which it is transported to germination conditions
 malt se kinvak nikalate hai jo anaaj ke shwetsar ko todate hai evam unhen sharkara main parivartit hone main madad karte hai
 When the required germination conditions are prepared, the malted barley is dried with the help of smoke

 Today only a handful of furnaces have their own private system of malt; These include Balvenie, Kilchomon, Highland Park, Glenfiddich, Glen Ord, Bowmore, Lafaroeg, Springbank, Tamdhu and Adrador

 It is then mixed with hot water in a large vessel called mash-making pipa
 is ghaan ko bhigane ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 This process is called "mash-making" and this mixture is called mash

 This vert is then molded into another large container called "wash back", where it cools

 The resulting fluid released is called a "wash"

 The next step is to use dag to release the wash
 straavana ke dwaara nashile padaarth kii maatra ko badhaayaa jaataa he evam methanol jaisi avaanchit ashuddhiyon ko hataaya jaataa he
 There are two types of dag used for secretion: dag pot and coffee dag
 Most Scotch malt whiskey furnaces have their products secreted twice; The exceptions are the 'hazelburn' brand of the Auchtenoshan Bhatti and Springbank, which uphold the tradition of three times the discharge of the Terai areas
 springbank bhatti ke 'springbank' brand kii ek teesri prakriya adwitiya he, jise "dhai dfa" straavit kiya jaataa he
 It is obtained by secreting semi and raw liquor for the second time
 isamen do aadhe hisson ko milaayaa jaataa he tathaa puri maatra ko ek aakiri baar straavit kiya jaataa he
 For malt whiskey, the wash is molded into the wash day
 us taral padaarth ko ubaal aane tak garm kiya jaataa he, jo pani ke kvathanank se kam hota he
 The alcohol forms vapor and reaches the upper part of the dag through the "line arm" and to condense, where it cools and reverts to liquid
 is taral padaarth main takreeban 20% nashila padaarth rahata he evam ise "lo wine" kehete hai
 This low wine is secreted into the wine dag for the second time and the secretion is divided into three "parts"

 Hence it is more efficient to operate and as a result this whiskey is less expensive

 Historically, the first casks were used for Spanish wine, and the casks used today are usually wine or corn wine
 kabhi-kabhaar port, coganac, madiraa, calwadons, bear, evam bauradiyaks wine jaisi anyaanya kismon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to US regulations, corn wine production is an almost inexhaustible generator of used barrels due to the need to mature into new, freshly burnt chestnut barrels

 In a furnace in Scotland it is kept for at least three years and a day to be called Scotch whiskey, although most single malts are offered after keeping them for a minimum of eight years

 Even in different pus, this period changes

 The color also reveals the type of casks used to prune whiskey, although the addition of the legally accepted "spirit caramel" gives a lighter color to the otherwise lighter whiskey

 In the late 1990s there was a trend of "wood finishes", in which fully matured whiskey was poured from one barrell to another, before which other types of wine were oldened so that the "finish" could be added
 "blike bomor" ek ullekhneey udhaaharan he, jise 1993, 94 evam 95 main 29, 30, 31 varshon tak purv-oloroso anguri pipon main rakhane ke baad baari-baari se jari kiya gaya

 Newly aged alcohols with single malts are "vat" or "mixed" with other single malts of the same furnace
 This whiskey typically mixes between 40% and 46% in bottle strength
 kabhi-kabhi bhatti "peepe kii kshamta" kaa sanskaran release karata he, jo ghulaa hua nahin hota tathaa jisamen aam taur par 50-60% nashila avyav hota he
 Many furnaces issue "single keg" versions, which are single-keg products and that are not vat with any other keg whiskey
 These bottles will usually have a label indicating the date of whiskey secretion, the date of filling in the bottle, the number of bottles produced, the number of a particular bottle, and the number of pups producing the bottle
 bahut si whiskiyon ko sard-nispandan ke baad botalon main bharaa jaataa he
 This is a process in which the whiskey is cooled to about 0 ° c and cooled with a fine filter
 parinamswarup straavana athwa paripakvan kii avadhi ke dauraan utpaadit kuch taileey / vasayukta yogicon ko hataaya jaataa he
 This prevents the level of whiskey content in the bottle to be below 46% ABV or prevents it from fogging when served cold, or when added to water or ice
 bahut se whisky utsaahi logon kaa maananaa he ki sard-nispandan se whisky kaa kuch swaad yaa gathan kho jaataa he, jisaki vajah se kuch log sard-nispandit whisky ko kamatar samajhate hai
 Bottled whiskey with more than 46% ABV indicates that it is non-refrigerant or non-refrigerant, since alcohol will generally be colorless at this intoxicating level
 scotland ko paaramparik taur par chaar kshetron main baanta gaya he: parvatiy kshetra, tarai kshetra, isle evam campbelltoun
 Nearly half of Scotland's total furnaces lie in the geographical boundaries of the Speyside crossing the Valley of the River Spey, which was once considered a part of the mountainous region, in the northeast of Scotland; As a result, it was officially recognized as a region in itself
 campbelltoun ko bahut varsh pehle ek kshetra ke darje se hataa liya gaya tha, phir bhi, abhi haal main hi ise punah ek manyata praapt utpaadan kshetra ke rup main behaal kiya gaya he
 The island is not recognized as an area by the Scotch Whiskey Association and is considered a part of the mountainous region
 adhikansh anya labalon kii tarah scoch whisky label main kanoon, parampara, vipanan, evam bhaawanaaon kaa mail hota he evam faltah ise samajhnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Due to the variation of language and national law, the following is a broad guideline: yadi kisi label main "ekal malt" shabd ho, to us bottle main ekal malt scoch whisky he
 "vatted malt", "pure malt", or "mixed malt" indicate a mixture of single malt whiskeys
 puraani botalon main shuddh malt ko aksar ekal malt kaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal karte the 
 The label may also reveal the furnace as part of the main brand or product descriptions
 yah zyaadaatar ekal malt ke maamalon main hota he
 Some single malt whiskeys are sold anonymously or under a fictitious brand name
 yah kisi bhatti yaa utpaadak kaa apane brands ko bachaane ke uddeshy se kiye gaye anurodh ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 An example of this is single keg whiskeys that are independently bottled by companies, such as the Scotch Malt Whiskey Society, which uses a numbering system as part of their agreement with the producers
 yah gunvattta kaa sanket nahin detaa, lekin baad vaale bottle inase bilkul bhinn ho sakate hai chunki prayek peepa sharaab main ek adwitiya gun pradaan karata he

 Whiskey is usually between 40% and 46% ABV

 If the bottle is more than 50% ABV, it is probably the capacity of keg
 kisi bottle main sabase kam umr kii whisky kii guarantee dete hue whisky kii umr soochibaddh ho sakati he
 a description of the age on the bottle as a number indicates the age of the youngest whiskey to produce that product
 umr ke vivaran vaale whisky ko guarantiyukt purana whisky mana jaataa he
 Scotch whiskey by age is legally under three years of age
 bottle par ek varsh aamtaur par straavana evam ek peepa bottlebandi kaa varsh bataata he, isliye yah bhi soochibaddh ho saktaa he ki kis varsh whisky ko bottle main bharaa gaya tha
 Whiskey does not mature once filled in the bottle, so age is the difference between these two dates; If both the dates are not given, then only the age of the bottle is not known
