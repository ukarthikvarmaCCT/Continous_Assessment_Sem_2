dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash ko bhi tourmaileen samtal dhruvit to kar detaa he or uski tivrata bhi tourmaileen ko ghumaane se badhati he, kintu uskaa purnat: lop kabhi nahin hota
 The reason for this is that this type of incident light consists of two components of mutually right, but different dimensions, and when one element is greatest in the case of q = 0, the other is lost and q = 90 degrees
 When the first dimension is omitted, the second dimension becomes the maximum
 vrutt dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata main tourmaileen kuch bhi parivartan nahin kar saktaa, kyonki iske donon avyav companon ke aayam baraabar hote hai arthath 
 Hence, it also has the property of symmetry like unfiltered light
 phir bhi yah dhruvit prakaash he
 The trick to identify it will be explained further
 isamen kampan saral rekhaatmak hote hai or unki disha achar rahati he
 Hence, it is also called line polarization
 samtal dhruvit naam kaa kaaran yah hai ki aise prakaash kii kiran ke samast vinduon ke kampan ek hi samtal main hote hai
 Other measures to generate flat polarized light are as follows: 1
 nikal prism - kailcite jaise crystal main vivartan to hota hai, kintu donon paraspar lambat: samtal dhruvit kirane itane paas-paas hoti hai ki unamem se keval ek ko praapt karnaa kathin he
 But the two prisms cut from the calcite special tip are connected to the Canadian balsam to form a parallel fruit prism, known as nickel prism
 isamen pravesh kar canada baalsam par pahunchne par ek kiran to purnat: paravartit hokar parshv main chali jaati he or vahaan nasht ho jaati he, kintu duusari kiran sidhi chalakar baahar nikalati he
 This prism is good transparent
 at: isse praapt samtal, dhruvit prakaash aaptit prakaash ke hi rang kaa hota he
 2
 Polaroid - In this, microscopic crystals of a mineral called hierapathite are deposited in a parallel position between the two planks of the celluloid in a special way, so that they can all work together to form one long broad crystal
 yah tourmaileen ke samaan hi samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann kar detaa he
 This is called a polyroid
 iske bahut lambey chaude takhte banaae ja sakate hai
 This color is light green
 san 1941 main isse bhi acchhee ek or yukti nikaal lee gai, jisase polivinil alcohol ke anuon ko samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he
 This is called polyuroid-h
 isamen jaraa bhi rang nahin hota or 99
99 pratishat prakaash dhruvit ho jaataa he
 3
 Reflection - In 1810, Malus testified that the properties of polarization are found partially in the reflected light from the surface of a transparent material such as water or glass, and it becomes perfectly flat when the incidence angle is of particular value
 
 is aapatan kone ko "dhruvak kone" kehete hai
 According to Brewster's rule, if the polar angle is i and the reflector of the reflective material is m, then sp
 4
 patticganj - yadhyapi kaach kii pattica se dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash purnat: dhruvit hota he, tathaapi us main se pargamit prakaash kabhi bhi purnat: dhruvit nahin hota, vah keval anshat: dhruvit hota he, kintu uttarottar anek patticoon main se pargamit prakaash kaa dhruvan uttarottar badhata jaataa he or patticoon kii sankhya paryaapt ho jane par vah lagbhag purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 Such a group of many thin strips is called pattikapunj
 5
 prakirnan - jab prakaash kisi paardarshee madhyam main upasthit atyant chote-chote kanon par padataa he tab un kanon se prakirnit hokar chaaron ore failanevaala prakaash bhi saamanyat: anshadhruvit hota he
 But the light which is radiated in a right-angled direction from the primary ray is perfectly flat
 yah baat akaash ke nile prakaash main dekhi ja sakati he, jo vaayu ke anuon dwaara prakirnit surya kaa prakaash hi he
 Just as it is used to find out whether a light plane is polar or not and which is its polar surface, tourmaline is used, in the same way all the above mentioned means of generating polarization were also used for this purpose
 can go
 ise utpann karne kaa upaay yah he ki samtal dhruvit prakaash ko kisi dwivartak crystal, yatha abhrak kii pattica, par abhilambat: daalaa jaataa he
 This causes right-angled polar rays of two different dimensions to move in the crystal on the same path at different velocities
 usamen se duusari ore nikalne par in donon kirnon main kuch kalantar utpann ho jaataa he or donon ke sangyojan se dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash praapt ho jaataa he
 If the thickness of the crystal plaque is such that the time interval reaches 90 degrees, then the plate is called the quadrant wave plate
 is pattica ko ghumaane se ek kiran kaa aayam badhata he or duusari kaa ghatata he
 In the case where the two dimensions are equal, the transmitted light becomes circled
 aise dhruvanon kii pahchaan ke liye bhi chaturthaansh tarangapattica kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This decomposes the ellipsoidal or circular vibrations into two right-angled simple linear vibrations, and by rotating the fillet to the proper position, it reduces or increases their time point to 0 ° or 180 °
 at: pargamit prakaash pun: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he, jisaki pahchaan tourmaileen yaa nikal ke dwaara ho sakati he
 Flat polarized light cannot be obtained by this action from fractionated or depolarized light, because the fractionated light is a mixture of polar and flat polarized light and the tourmaline gate of the depolarized light can never be omitted
 samtal dhruvit prakaash main companon kii disha kaa gyaan hone kaa karna is disha kaa saket dene ke liye ek dhruvanatal kii kalpana kii gai thi or uski paribhaasha yon di gai thi : paravartan dwaara praapt purnat: samtal dhruvit kiran kaa dhruvanatal uskaa aayaat tal hota he
 Therefore, in the event of a tourmaline in which the intensity of this reflected ray is destroyed, a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate
 usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he or tab aise tourmaileen se kisi bhi dhruvit prakaash kaa dhruvanatal maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 The simplest way to know this is to move a thin beam of polarized light flattened in a dark room in a vertical direction
 kiran kaa maarg adrishy hi rahegaa, kintu yadi bahut patale kanon kaa dhunaa, kaagaj ko jalaakar, is kiran ke nikat utpann kiya jaae to un kanon se prakirnit prakaash ke kaaran kiran kaa maarg dikhaai dene lagegaa
 But by looking around, the ray will remain invisible in one particular direction
 spashtat: is disha main prakirnan nahin hota
 Thus, this is the direction of vibration, because the transverse wave cannot move in the direction of vibration
 is upaay se gyaat ho gaya he ki kampan kii disha dhruvan tal se samakonik hoti he, arthath dhruvak kone par paravartit kiran ke kampan apaat tal se samakonik hote hai
 The same thing has been proved by other measures
 prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke anusar prayek kiran main vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey donon prakaar ke kampan hote hai or ye paraspapar samakonik bhi hote hai
 This theory also shows that the electrical vibrations in the reflected light at the polar angle are equidistant from the emergency
 at: isse yah parinaam nikalataa he ki netron ko prabhavit karanevaale prakaash ke kampan vaidyut hai, chumbakeey nahin
 In light reflected at the polar angle, the vibrations of the vibrations are right-angled from the emergency plane, which obviously means that if the vibrations of the incident ray are in the emergency plane, its reflection will not be exactly at the polar angle
 at: jab aapatan kone dhruvak kone ke baraabar ho tab apattal main dhruvit prakaash kaa to paravartan ho saktaa he, kintu apattal se samakonat: dhruvit prakaash kaa paravartan nahin ho saktaa
 In geometry, it is necessary that the intensity of light can be reduced at will and also we can know accurately what is the ratio between this reduced intensity and the preceding intensity
 iske liye do nikal prismon kaa upyog kiya jaat he
 When both are in parallel phase, the intensity of the light passing through both of them progressively becomes the greatest, but if there is an angle between the positions of both, then the intensity decreases in proportion
 polaroid kaa bhi is kaary ke liye upyog kiy ja saktaa he
 The Pamir River is a river in Tajikistan and Afghanistan
 yah panj nadi kii ek upanadi he
 It originates in the mountains of the Pamir Mountains in the Tajikistan's far eastern kohistoni-badakhshan Autonomous Province
 iskaa mukhya strot jorkul sarovar mana jaataa he
 From here onward its route is considered to be the northern border of Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor and the international border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan

 The first book of Esperanto was published in Warsaw in 1887 by Ludwig Lazar Zamenhof, the creator of this language, nicknamed "doktoro Esperanto"

 Esperanto is a collective, organized, simple language for speakers of different mother tongues
 zamenhof kaa uddeshy tha kii ek aisi bhashaa ho jo seekhney main aasaan ho, rajnatik drushti se tatasth ho, jo rashtriyata ke paar ho or bhinn-bhinn prantiy or rashtriya bhashaaon ke bolne waalon ke bich shanti or antarrashtriya sanchaar kaa saadhan ban sake

 3) Neutral: Esperanto is not a denomination of any one race or country

 By isolating people suffering from active TB and placing them in the anti-tb drug regime, the flow of person-to-person spread can be effectively stopped
 prabhavi upachaar ke do saptaah ke baad, gairpratirodhi sakriy sankraman vaale log aam taur par dusron ke liye sankramak nahin rah jate hai
 If someone becomes infected, it usually takes three to four weeks for the newly infected person to become capable of transmitting the infection to another person

 The risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV increases by about 10% a year
 yadi prabhavi upachaar nahin diya jaataa he to, sakriy tibi ke maamalon main mrityu dar 66% tak he
 TB infection begins when mycobacteria reach the lung follicles, where they invade and replicate endosomes of alveolar macrophages

 Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur through infection with blood flow

 Tuberculosis is classified as a granulomatous inflammatory disease
 macrophesso, tii limphocites, bi limphocites or fibroblast ve koshikaayen hai jo milakar grenuloma banaate hai jabaki limphosite, sankramit macrophesso ke chaaron ore hoti hai
 Granulomas inhibit the proliferation of mycobacteria and provide a local environment for the interplay of cells of the immune system

 The development of abnormal cell death at the center of the tubercle is another feature of granuloma

 If TB bacteria enter the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and form multiple centers of infection, all of which appear as small, white tubercles in the tissues
 yah tibi rog kaa ek gambhir rup he jo chote bacchon or echivi peedit logon main sabase adhik aam he, ise milliyari tapedic kaha jaataa he
 People suffering from this TB have a high mortality rate despite treatment

 During active disease, some of these empty airways are connected to the bronchi and this material can come out in the form of phlegm

 Treatment with appropriate antibiotics can kill bacteria and make treatment possible
 thik ho jane par, prabhavit kshetra antat utakon dwaara pratisthapit ho jate hai
 Active tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose only on the basis of signs and symptoms, similarly diagnosing disease in people with weak immunity is difficult

 The prevention and control of tuberculosis is mainly dependent on vaccination of newborns and appropriate treatment of active cases

 The World Health Organization declared TB a "global health emergency" in 1993, and in 2006 the Stop TB Partnership developed a global plan to prevent tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its beginnings to 2015

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
 avyakt sankramanon se peedit logon ko baad main jivan main sakriy tibi rog ke viksit hone se bachaav ke liye bhi upachaar diya jaataa he
 Direct treatment, ie a healthcare provider, takes care that people take their medicines

 The evidence in support of this case is weak when compared to this practice and people taking the medicines on their own independently
 lekin upachaar ke mahatv ko, logon ko yaad dilaane ke tareeke prabhavi dikhaai dete hai
 In 2010, a suggested six-month treatment of newly started pulmonary tuberculosis used a combination of antibiotics like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isonizid in the subsequent four months
 
 jin maamalon main isoniyazid ke liye ucch pratirodh hota he, unamem baad ke chaar maahon main athembuttol joda ja saktaa he
 If tuberculosis occurs again, before determining treatment it should be tested to determine which antibiotic it is sensitive to

 Later he went to Wardha for further studies

 Which is a very backward village

 udhaaharan ke anusaar aap le sakate he ki dusre gaanv se aakar shiksha lete he lekin is gaanv kii bhaavana bahut kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 Students who take education should take education well
 agar sarkari yaa privet naukari donon main janaa chaahate he to mehnat kerani padati he
 But the people of the village have a feeling that if there is no government job, then the people of the village say that there is nothing to do with reading, but they say wrong education is very important in today's time
 agar dekhen to har gaanv main kitna sarkari naukari main he kya log shiksha nahin le paayegaa
 Whatever you say, tell about the village how important education is today; similarly if it continues in the society, then the future generations think for themselves how to bring the society forward

 Then the student comes to notice that i am not studying education carefully
 jo chaatr ghar se nahin niklaa he use dusre shahar jaakar dekhe ki shiksha kya he
 Everyone says that there is a lion in the house

 And in the village house, an educated looks different because he has different values because of his knowledge

 Both of which are in the same campus

 In this village, students come from eight to ten mills to study
