 Seeing the maturity of the rows, many believed that this could not be the work of a novice, which is as follows- kay rahal priytama abhinayaboodi bhor man tubhuki uthalaahin san ham karab parinay 
 His first Maithili story Aparajita was published in Vaidehi magazine in 1954
 unki pratham maithili kavita bhi vaidehi se hi patnia tattuk prati sheershak se 1955 prakashit hui thi
 By this time, he had started writing regularly in Hindi as well
 bahut hi kam samay main unhone apni pahchaan duuradrushti vaale ek aise lekhak ke rup main kar lee thi, jinaki soch samay se bahut aage kii thi
 His Maithili works have a deep attack on the conservative structure of rural society
 unke jeevankaal main hi unki pehali maithili kavita kavitaaon ke sangrah swargandha kaa prakaashan 1958 main hua tha
 His next collection of poems Kavita Rajkamalak was published in the editing of Mohan Bhardwaj after 24 years of his death
 unki kavitaaon kii khaasiyat yah thi ki uname kisi tarah kii layabaddhata athwa kisi kavy niyam kaa bandhan nahin thi
 The composition of his poems was also in keeping with the mind
 unki rachanaaon main kshan vishesh kaa prabhaav tha evam unke nijee anubhavon se ot-prot tha
 The approach of looking at a subject seemed very different from its contemporary creators
 udahaaran ke taur par yah panktiyaan dekhi ja sakati hai- Original poem jagal chhi, kati rati beetal achhigyan nai ho kichhuo rusal piya jak nah ki maan hai hahaarchan hai, abah, in lanternaq revenge dan daih kichhu jyotiduye panti likhaba lal ab achhi chithi of your queen hindi anuwaadajaga hoon kitni raat hui kuch pataa nahin

 Don't know how long this night has already been
 Don't sulk like my angry lover, oh moon! Come gift me some light, for a lantern, just two lines remainin this letter to my queen maithili main unhone kareeb 100 kavitaayen, teen upanyaas, 37 kahaniyaan, teen ekanki or chaar aalochanatmak niabandh likhe
 Most of his large literary writings remained unpublished during his lifetime
 unki mrityu ke lagbhag das maheene ke baad biiti sindari sthit mitron ne unki maithili kahaniyon kaa pratham sangrah lalka paag kaa prakaashan kiya
 After that Nirmohi Balam Hamar and one pomegranate one Rogah were published
 1980 main maithili academy ne kriti raajakmalak kaa prakaashan kiya
 Thereafter, in 1983, Tarananda Viyogi edited Ekta Champakali, Ekta Vishadhar was published
 unki kahani ekata champaakali ekata vishdhar main mithila main vyaapt bemail punarvivaah par gaharaa chot he jisamen yah bataaya gaya ki aarthik dansh peedit maithil samaaj kis tarah bejhijak ek phool si pyaari ladki ko uske pita ke hamaumr vidhur purush ke saamne shaadi ke liye hajir karti he
 Although Rajkamal wrote for a longer period of time in Maithili than in Hindi, his contribution to Hindi literature was very rich
 hindi main unhone aath upanyaas, kareeb 250 kavitaayen, 92 kahaniyaan, 55 niabandh or teen naatak likhe
 His poetry writing in Hindi started around 1950
 1956 ke baad hindi lekhan main pravaah kaaphi bad gaya
 His first published poem was titled - Barsaat: Raat: Prabhat
 hindi main unki lekhnee, maithili se kai myanon main bhinn thi
 This difference was in the problem centered in the composition, the class addressed and the basic structure of the composition
 hindi evam maithili kii rachanaaon main stri paatro ke madhyam se samjik-aarthik samasyaon par thos prahaar karte the
 a large part of his creative writing was spent in Calcutta
 isiilie unke lekhan main kalakatta, vahaan kaa jivan, varg-sangharsh kaa bahudhaa chithran miltaa he
 Apart from this, references to Western literature are found many times in his authorship
 unke sahitya main aise vishyon kaa ullekh he jo us samay tak kai sahityakaron ke liye achhut athwa tyajya koti tha
 For a long time, the topics related to women and their problems in Indian literature, hidden vulgarity in the society, and sexual repression of women in the name of religion and culture have been subjects from which many great writers have kept away their dealings
 jin lekhakon ne un samasyaon par likhnaa chaha, unpar vaicharik vikruti or saste sahitya lekhan ke aarope lage
 In Rajkamal's creation, there is a depiction of all these subjects boldly or indirectly
 isi nirbhikta ke falswaroop unke kai samakaleen sahityakaron ne unke rachanakarm ko kaaphi hey drushti se dekha or unki upasthiti ko darkinar kiya evam bahishkaar kiya

 seva ke chaar aayam nimna prakaar hai :- The power generated by the energy of falling or flowing water is called hydroelectricity
 san 2005 main vishwa bhar main lagbhag 816 gwe jalavidyut utpann kii jaati thi jo ki vishwa kii sampoorn vidyut urja kaa lagbhag 20% he
 This electricity is pollution free
 evam yah paryaavaran ke anukool he
 The economically exploitable and viable water potential in India is estimated at 84,000 MW at a 66 percent weight factor
 iske atirikt, chote, laghu tathaa sookshm jal vidyut yojanaon se sthapit kshamta ke 6780 megawatt kaa aankalan kiya gaya he
 56 sites have also been identified for pumped storage schemes with accumulated installed capacity of 94,000 MW
 tathaapi, abhi tak is sambhavyata ke keval 19
9 pratshit kaa hi dohan kiya ja sakaa he
 Electricity is the hydroelectric power obtained from water generated by water
 vidyut shakti ke janan kii vidhiyon main jalavidyut bahut mahatvapurn hai
 One-third of the entire electric power of the world is received in the form of hydroelectricity
 yon to kisi bhi rup main uplabdh urja ko vidyutshakti ke janan ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The energy contained in the water falling in the waterfall has been used since ancient times to run the watermill, but the use of this energy for electric power has been given from the twentieth century itself
 na keval girte hue jal main nihit urja kaa upyog shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, varan behate hue pani main nihit gatij urja kaa upyog bhi shakti janan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, the first is to choose a place where the dam can be stored in plenty of water and the power contained therein can be used to generate electricity for power generation by using canals or open canals in power stations
 upyukt sthaan kii talash ke liye varsha tathaa jameen donon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 The dam is built in such a place where the dam made in the lowest price can store maximum water
 iske liye sthaan kii prakritik dasha aisi honi chahie ki koi nadi ghati main hoti hui pahaado ke bich sankare maarg se guzarati ho, jisase sakare sthaan par band banaakar nadi ke upree bhaag ko ek bade jalashay main parivartit kiya ja sake
 Another agar is built above the dam, from where the water is carried by open canals or taps to the power house
 yah pani bijlighar main sthit bade bade tarabinon ko chalaata he, jinase yojit janitron main vidyut shakti kaa janan hota he
 The turbine is located on the face of the draft tube made of cement concrete
 pani guide wain main hota hua tarabine ke bladon ko ghumata he or is prakaar apane nihit urja kaa tarabine ke chalaane main upyog karata he
 The mechanical energy of the moving turbine is converted into electrical energy and thus the energy contained in water takes the form of hydroelectricity
 tarabine main is prakaar pani main nihit shakti kaa upyog ho jane ke pashchaat, pani draft-tub main se hota hua visarjani kulya main jaataa he, jahaan se vah phir nadi main ja miltaa he
 The design of the draft-tube is such that the remaining energy of the water is slowly depleted, so that it does not damage the river banks when it comes out
 pani main nihit urja, uske aaytan tathaa sheersh par nirbhar karti he
 Hydropower schemes can be divided into three parts according to the head: 1
 ucch sheersh yojana - lagbhag 200 meter se adhik
 2
 Medium Head Plan - 50 meters to 200 meters
 3
 nimna sheersh yojana - 50 meter se kam
 Both the size and the shape of the plan depends on the top and also the type of its turbines accordingly
 is prakaar ucch sheersh ke liye francis tarabine evam paston chakra upyukt hote hai
 Pressurized turbines are used for the middle head
 nimna sheersh ke liye nodak praroop kaa tarabine adhik upyukt hota he
 In high-end schemes, generally, the volume of water is not high
 isliye pani ko nalon dwaara le jaakar tarabine ke tund se ranor kii waltiyon par choda jaataa he, jisase pani main nihit urja ranor ko chalaane main samarth hoti he
 The turbine can control the output of the turbine by controlling the flow and speed of the water and by varying the angle of water released on the buckets and thus control the power generated
 baltiyon ke kone kaa vicharan karnaa bhi sambhav he or donon niyantranon ko swat: chaalit rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The propellant turbine runner has only three or four wings
 ye baari ispaat ke bane hote hai
 Low head plans often have a very high water volume
 at: inamen pani ko nalon main le janaa sambhav nahin hota or khuli naalee kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 To obtain the output corresponding to the load, it is necessary to vary the amount of water going into the turbine, which is edited by opening the door
 ye dwaar guide pichhafalak kii bhanti hote hai or inaki sthiti pani kaa niyantran karti he
 Being heavy, these gates are driven by hydraulic pressure
 jis prakaar peltan chakra ke guide pichhafalak, athwa baltiyon, ke kone kaa vicharan kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar inhen bhi swat: chaalit rup se pravartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The automatic driven variance is performed by the servo motor
 yah chota sa motor hota he, jo dravchaalit daabak kaa vicharan karata he
 Its investment is only a fraction of the output of the turbine, so it varies accordingly
 is prakaar is motor dwaara kiya gaya kaary tarabine ke nirgat par, jo uske upar bhaar ke anuroop hota he, nirbhar karata he or swat: chaalit rup se dravchaalit daabak ko gata badhaakar usee ke anusaar guide pichhafalak, athwa dwaara khulaai, kaa niyantran kar detaa he, athwa baltiyon ke kone kaa vyavasthaapan kar detaa he
 Propellant type turbine is the main one in propellant type turbine
 isaki visheshta isaki majboot or ucch dakshata he
 Another feature of this is that the load variance has very little effect on efficiency, due to which this turbine is very suitable for variable loads
 madhyam sheersh yojanaon main, saamanyat:, mishrit pravaahavala tarabine adhik prayukt hota he, parantu sheersh ke anuroop hi uskaa chayan adhik nirbhar karata he
 Steady guide lanes are used to move water to the turbine
 iske nirgat kaa vicharan unke kone ke vicharan se kiya jaataa he
 a low-heading turbine is usually located above the open shafts
 ye sarpil praroop ke aavaran se ghire hote hai, jisase pani ko ek samaan rup se guide pichhafalak dwaara le jaaya ja sake
 In high-powered turbines, this cover is made of metal
 tarabine kshaitij evam urdhwadhar donon prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 But in general, vertical is more used
 inamen bering vishisht prakaar kaa hota he, jise mashin par pratishthit parshv aghat bhi vahan karnaa hota he
 Hence these are called shock wearings
 vering tathaa duusare gatiman bhaagon kaa snehan bhi apane-aap main ek kathin samasya hoti he
 Pressure lubrication method is used for this
 isamen snehak tel ko dabaakar snehan kiye janevaale sthanon main bheja jaataa he
 Pressure is generated by the oil pump
 daab ghat jane par, mashin ke apane aap band ho jane kii vyavastha bhi hoti he, jisase aisi paristhiti main use kshati na pahunche
 There is an oil filter to clean the lubricating oil and there is also an oil cooler to cool the oil that gets heated after lubrication
 jalavidyut yojanaon main sabase adhik mahatv unki sthiti kaa he
 Their condition depends mainly on natural and physical causes
 mote taur par kisi jalavidyut yojana se 1,000 ghan foot prati second ke pravaah se 150 foot kaa sheersh uplabdh hone par lagbhag 10 megawatt kii shakti uplabdh hogi
 The reservoir can also be estimated on the basis that 1 foot of water over an area of 1
13 square miles generates a flow of only 1 cubic foot per second
 at: 1,000 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah paane ke liye jalashay main 113 varg mile ke kshetrafal main ausat se 10 foot gaharaa pani hona chahie
 For any hydroelectric scheme to be practical, it is necessary to have maximum head and flow
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen tabhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati hai, jab pani kaa pravaah paryaapt ho
 High-top schemes can be practical even at low flows
 bijlighar kii sthiti band ke nikat hona anivaary nahin he
 The reservoir can be on the mountain and the powerhouse can be built at the foot of the mountain to get to the top
 aisi dasha main pani kii badi badi nalikaaon dwaara bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Plans with higher heads are usually of this type
 bahut se sthanon par pahari ko katkar surang ke dwaara pani ko pahari ke duusari or bijlighar tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 It is not compulsory for the power house to be on earth
 bahut se bijlighar prithvi ke andar bhi hote hai or us tak lift dwaara hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 a similar underground power plant has been built in Maithon
 aise bijli ghar swachaalit praroop ke haate hai or duurastha niyantran dwaara prithvital se chaalit hote hai
 Although these power plants are built mainly inside the earth due to natural reasons, they are very important from a strategic point of view
 kam sheershawali yojanaayen hamaare desh main bahut hai
 Many power stations have been built over the Ganges and Sharda canals, in which only the top of 20 to 30 feet is used
 ye yojanaayen pani kaa pravaah adhik hone ke kaaran vyaavhaarik ho saki hai
 Hydropower schemes are mainly in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and USA
 bharat bhi jalavidyut yojanaon main bahut peeche nahin he or yahan kii kuch yojanaayen vishwa kii mahanatam yojanaon main gini jaati hai, jaise, bhakhra-nangal, damodar ghati, rihand, hyrakund, nagarjun sagar, koyna, shivasamudram, periyar aadi
 Many hydroelectric schemes are also multipurpose
 mukhyat: inke saath sinchai evam baadh rodhak yojanaayen bhi shaamil rahati hai, jisase kshetra kaa sarvangin vikaas kiya ja sake
 Damodar Valley Corporation was also established in India on the basis of Tennessee Valley Corporation in USA
 pichley bees varshon main bahut si mahatvapurn jalavidyut yojanaayen bani hai or sabhi jagah jalavidyut sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan kar yojanaayen banaai ja rahi hai
 In hydroelectric planning, although there is a lot of expenditure initially, most of the schemes are successful from the economic point of view due to lower operating expenses
 inke sanyatra kaa jivan bhi apekshaakrit bahut adhik hota he
 Their main drawback is actually their distance from consumer locations
 ye yojanaayen jahaan chahen vahaan ke liye nahin banaai ja saktin
 For example, if the demand for power is in Calcutta, it is not possible to implement the hydroelectric scheme there
 himalay se nikalanevaali nadiyon main apaar jalashakti nihit he, parantu vahaan shakti kii maang nahin he
 In this way, the power generated by the hydroelectric scheme often has to be transmitted to great distances
 at:, jalavidyut yojana kaa saapeksh rup se adhyayan karne ke liye preshnatantr kaa vyay bhi lagaana aavashyak he
 Even then, hydroelectricity is mostly cheap
 surat gujarat praant kaa ek pramukh shahar he
 The city is also the administrative headquarters of Surat district
 tapi nadi surat shahar ke madhya se hokar guzarati he
 Surat is mainly famous for the textile industry and diamond cutting and polishing, hence the city is also known as Silk City and Diamond City
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki aadhunik surat shahar kii sthapana pandrahavi sadi ke antim varshon main hui
 It is said that Gopi, a Hindu Brahmin, settled it in 1516
 12veen se 15veen shatabdi tak yah shahar muslim shaskaon, porttaaaliyon, mughalon or maraathon ke akramanon kaa shikaar hua
 In 1514, Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa described Surat as an important port
 18veen shatabdi main dhire-dhire surat kaa patan hone laga tha
 At that time both the British and the Dutch claimed control over Surat, but in 1800 the British took control of it

 In 1990, cash crop cultivation like sugarcane, grapes and bananas were started
 porttaaaliyon dwaara surat ko jala die jane ke baad yah ek bada vikray centre bana, jahaan se kapade or sone kaa niryaat hota tha
 Textile and ship building were the main industries here
 angrezon ne 1612 main pehali baar apni vyapaarik chaowkee yaheen par sthapit kii thi
 The cotton, silk, Kimkhawab garments and gold and silver items are famous here
 surat ke heere par polish ke udyog ne pravasi mazaduron kon apni or aakarshith kiya he
 Presently the city of Surat ranks first in the manufacture of textiles in the country
 yahan par har prakaar ke vastron sari, dress material or sabhi prakaar ke radimaid vastron kaa bhi vrihat paimaane par utpaadan hota he
 People from almost all the states of India reside here
 isi kaaran yah "laghu bharat"ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Surat was a sedentary city in the mid-19th century, with a population of 80,000, but Surat began to prosper again with the introduction of the Indian Railways

 kisi misi varg vishesh yaa sabhi sevaaon ke niyamadhar tathaa chuttee aadi ke niyamon ke prashnon par bhi sarkaar ukt ayog se paraamarsh karegi
 The rules which were specified for the Commission in the said rules were reformed and stabilized by the White Paper, in which there were proposals for scientific reforms, according to which there was a law to establish commissions for each province

 You can do the same with your IAS course
 jin vishyon par aap achche hai or jin vishyon kii aapako aavashyaktaa hogi unhen dhundhen
 Do this for all subjects and work on them
 paathyakram ko object karnaa Most IAS aspirants are discouraged to make up the bulk of the IAS syllabus
 isamen koi andeh nahin he ki paathyakram vishaal he, lekin yadi aap vishyon ko prabandhaneey hisson main vibhajit karte hai, to asambhav dikhne vaale kaary aapke liye aasaan ho jaaenge
 Enjoy your preparation anjaane main, upiessi taiyaari ek lambii prakriya he
 But the moment you start enjoying your preparation, all the unwanted stress and anxiety associated with the preparation will disappear
 civil seva pariksha ummidavaar apane shauk chhod dete hai, lekin aapke shauk kaa peechha karte hue aapaki taiyaari adhik mjedaar hogi

 Fast bowling players are often called fast bowlers, fastmen, pace bowlers, or pacemen, although sometimes bowlers who use a special technique of fast bowling are also called swing bowlers or seam bowlers
 tej gendbaazi kaa mukhya uddeshy hota he cricket kii sakht gend ko tej gati ke saath daalana or ise itnaa veg dena ki yah oochaal ke saath pich par bouns ho sake yaa hawa main hoti hui said se nikal jaye, taaki ballebaaz ke liye gend ko safai se hit karnaa mushkil ho jaye
 The speed of a typical fast ball is 136 to 150 km / h

 The fastest ball that was officially recorded was 161
3 km per hour and was delivered by Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan during a match against England at the 2003 Cricket World Cup

 Although the speed of a ball from Brett Lee was later found to be the same, it was not recorded properly due to external interference in radar signals

 In most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are considered to be the mainstay of a team's bowling, while slower bowlers play a supporting role
 upmahadweep main, vishesh rup se bharat or srilanka main, aksar iskaa vipareet satya he, jahaan tej gendbaaz spinner ke liye sahi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 This is largely due to the position of the pitch used in these countries, which is more helpful to the spinner than the fast bowler, but internationally the spinner's specific skills are compared to the pace bowler
 iske vipareet, anya mukhya upmahadweep desh, pakistan, main kai kushal tej gendbaaz hue hai, kyonki is desh ko reverse swing main maharath hasil he or yahaan kii pichen tej gendbaazon ke liye adhik sahaayak hai
 It is possible that a bowler only focuses on speed, especially this is true for a young bowler, but as the fast bowler matures, he acquires many more skills and can be used to swing bowling or seam bowling
 His trend towards gendbaaj Most fast bowlers specialize in both of these in one area and are sometimes classified into strike, swing or seam bowlers
 haalanki yah vargeekaran santoshjanak nahin he kyonki shreneekaran paraspar vishisht nahin hota or ek kushal gendbaaz aamtaur par tej, swing, seem or kating gend kaa mishran daalata he, chaahe vah anya prakaaron kii tulana main kisi ek prakaar ko praathamikta de
 Instead, it is more common to categorize fast bowlers according to the average speed of their delivery, as given below
 in shabdon kaa upyog sandarbh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, crickinfo "tej-madhyam" or "madhyam-tej" shabdon kaa upyog antarpariwartit rup se karata he
 It is said that the fastest bowlers bowl at express speed
 tulana ke liye, peshewar cricket main adhikansh spin gendbaaz 45 se 55 meter prati ghanta kii ausat gati se gend daalate hai
 Some bowlers bowl with every type of ball change from fast to slow, this can cause some confusion as they can be placed in different categories, for example Brett Lee puts his fast ball at a speed of 145 km / h , Which makes him a fast bowler, although he sometimes bowls slower at a speed of about 120 kilometers per hour
 iske vipareet, anil kumble ek spin gendbaaz he, ve apekshaakrit tej gend daalate hai, jisaki gati 110 kilometre prati ghanta tak hoti he
 Although these figures are often ignored to determine which category a bowler fits, as the speed of the ball changes, the main intention behind it is to hit the batsman, not Setting a standard bowling speed
 tej gendbaaz jitna dhimaa hota he, utana hi use wicket lene ke liye neeche di gayi badlaav takneekon par adhik nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Whereas fast and moderately fast-medium and medium-fast bowlers often dismiss the batsman with their quickness and speed
 vyavhaar main, bahut kam visheshgy gendbaaz madhyam shrenee main aate hai- is gati se gend daalane vaale gendbaaz aksar ballebaaz hote hai, jo zarurat padane par kuch over daal sakate hai
 These bowlers are called medium pacers
 madhyam-dhimi or dhimi-madhyam shreniyon main aksar spin gendbaazon ko rakhaa jaataa he, chunki tej gendbaazi kii takanic ke saath is gati se daali gayi gend, spin hone ke bajaay, aksar hit karne ke liye bahut aasaan hoti he
 Although the spinner is colloquially called a "slow bowler", very few players in professional cricket actually place the ball in the "slow" category
 pehali cheez jo ek tej gendbaaz ke liye jaruri he vah he gend ko sahi dhang se pakadana yaa grip karnaa
 To achieve maximum speed in basic fast bowling, the ball is held in such a way that the seam is directly up and the pointing finger and middle finger are placed near each other at the top of the seam and the thumb is just below the seam
 is
 sahi karne ke liye chhavi sahi pakad ko darshata he
 The first two fingers and the thumb form the grip on the ball, this part is slightly forward from the rest of the hand and the remaining two fingers are held together with the palm
 gend ko bilkul halake se pakadaa jaataa he, taaki yah haath se aasaani se chhot jaye
 Other types of grip are also possible, as a result of which a different type of ball is put - see below swing and seam bowling
 The bowler usually makes a grip on the ball with one hand and keeps the other hand on this arm for the maximum time possible, so that the batsman does not see what type of grip he is taking, or is preparing to take
 ek tej gendbaaz ko spinner kii tulana main wicket kii ore adhik lambe samay tak daudane kii zarurat padati he
 This long run generates a momentum in the ball for fast delivery
 tej gendbaaz wicket se duuri ko chinhit kar lete hai or apni is daud kii aavashyak duuri ko maap lete hai
 It is very important for the bowler to know the exact length of his or her run, as it must be finished at the popping crease
 agar gendbaaz is kris se aage nikal jaataa he to uske dwaara daali gayi gend no ball kii shrenee main aa jaati he
 At the end of the run-up or run, the bowler keeps his front foot on the pitch, keeping his knee straight as far as possible
 isse gend ko gati dene main madad milti he parantu yah khatarnaak ho saktaa he kyonki is ection se joint par dabaav padataa he
 Knee injuries are not uncommon among fast bowlers: English pace bowler David Lawrence, for example, was out of the game for months after his knee cap broke into two halves
 aage vaale pair par dabaav itnaa zyada hota he ki kuch tej gendbaaz apane pair ke anguuthe ko chot se bachaane ke liye apane juute ke agle hisse ko kaat dete hai, kyonki unhen baar baar juute ke vipareet dabaav daalana padataa he
 The bowler then lifts his bowling arm above his head and drops the ball by moving it to the appropriate height, where he thinks the ball should be bowled
 ek baar phir se, bhujaa sidhi honi chahiye haalanki yah gati ko badhaane main sahaayta dene ke bajaay cricket kaa ek niyam he
 Bowling the elbow makes it easy for the bowler to hit the batsman's wicket directly and dismiss it
 tej gendbaaz aise ection karte hai jisase ve ran-ap ke ant main said-on yaa chest-on rah jate hai
 a chest-on bowler's chest and ax are bowed when the batsman's back foot touches the ground, while a side-on bowler's chest and ax are bent at 90 degrees in the batsman's direction
 His back foot touches the ground
 west indies ke gendbaaz mailkam marshall chest-on gendbaaz ke ek achche udhaaharan the, jabaki australian tej gendbaaz denis lily said-on takanic kaa prayog karte the
 Although the action of a bowler does not affect the speed of the ball, it may limit the style of balls he bowls
 haalanki iske liye koi nirdhaarit niyam or kanoon nahin hai, said-on gendbaaz saamanyatya baahar kii ore swing karte hue gend daalate hai, jabaki front-on gendbaaz andar kii ore swing karte hue gend daalate hai
 Another type of fast bowler's action is the sling, in which when the bowler begins the delivery of the ball, his arm is fully extended behind his back
 sling se atyadhik gati utpann hoti he, lekin isamen niyantran ke saath samjhauta karnaa padataa he
 The most famous bowler to bowl with the sling is Geoff Thomson, who bowled at an extraordinary pace even after taking a short run-up
 vartmaan antarrashtriya khiladi jo sling ke saath gend daalate hai, unamem fidel edwards, shaun tet, lasith malinga or mishael johnson shaamil hai
 When the ball is bowled, the bowler "follows" at the end of his action
 isamen gendbaaz apni gati ko dhimaa karne ke liye kuch ore kadam daudta he or said main hote hue pich se baahar aa jaataa he
 While coming off the pitch at the end of the delivery, the bowler can damage the surface, causing uneven patches on the pitch, with spin bowlers often doing this to get the ball to rotate more; It is illegal according to the rules of the game
 jo gendbaaz pich par bhaagna jari rakhte hai, unhen chetavanee di ja sakati he, ek khel main aisi teen chetavaniyaan milane par gendbaaz us pari ke dauraan phir se gendbaazi nahin kar paata
 An effective fast bowler has to maintain a consistent line and length, or in general terms, it should be absolutely accurate
 In this context, the line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman when he is running in the horizon dimension from the off to the leg side
 jabaki length kaa taatpary us duuri se he jo gend ke dwaara ballebaaz kii disha main bouns hone se pehle tay kii jaati he
 The length is often more important for a fast bowler
 gendbaaz jitna tej hota he, utana hi line or length ko banaaye rakhana uske liye mushkil ho jaataa he lekin tej gati se gend ko jaldi daalaa ja saktaa he
 Fast bowlers who are perfectly accurate in this regard are extremely effective, for example, Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath and South African fast bowler Sean Pollock
 aadhunik cricket main, tej gendbaaz ke liye lakshyit line tathakthith rup se anishchit he; yah ballebaaz ke of stump ke thik baahar kaa kshetra he
 It is difficult for a batsman to tell whether such a ball will hit his wicket or not and thus he does not know whether to drop the ball or hit it to escape
 This technique was theoretically called off theory, but now it is so regular that it is rarely given any name
 Of course, line changes are also important and delivery delivered to the leg stump serves the purpose
 gend kii line kii sateek maharath kaa upyog sarvshereshth rup se tab kiya jaataa he jab ek ballebaaz ko ek vishesh shot ko hit karne kii kamajori ke liye janaa jaataa he, kyonki ek prabhavi line se saath gend daalane vaala gendbaaz sahi samay ke baad kamjor samay main gend daal saktaa he
 Not being able to consistently hit the ball on a certain line ends the career of innumerable batsmen, when they are dismissed to the ball of skilled line bowlers
 ek acchhee length kii gend vah hoti he jo ballebaaz tak pahunchane ke samay uski qamar kii unchai par hoti he
 There is no fixed distance for a good length, or in fact there is no other length for the ball in cricket, since the distance required varies according to the speed of the ball, similarly this distance is the state of the pitch and the bowler and batsman Also depends on the height of
 is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki is arth main ek "acchhee length" kii gend daalana hameshaa upyukt nahin hota-kuch sthitiyon main, kuch pichon par or kuch ballebaazon ke liye koi or length prabhavi ho sakati he
 The diagram on the right will help clarify what the different lengths mean
 ek gend jo acchhee length se jaraa sa pehle bouns ho jaati he or ballebaaz ke pet se adhik upar uth jaati he, use short pich kii gend kaha jaataa he yaa ise long hope ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he or ise hit karnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he kyonki use yah dekhne ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa he ki gend kii oonchai or line bouns hone ke baad gadabadai he yaa nahin
 a short pitch ball is at the right height for the batsman, as he can put an aggressive pull shot on it
 ek gend jo acchhee length se pehle bouns ho jaati he or kandhe yaa sir kii oonchai tak pahunch jaati he, use bounsar kaha jaataa he or yah ek prabhavi delivery ho sakati he
 Any ball that is short enough to bounce above the batsman's head is usually called wide by the umpire
 short pich kii gend yaa wide ball daalana acha nahin mana jaataa kyonki isse ballebaaz ke liye apane aap ko bachaana yaa hamalaa karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 On the other side of the scale, the ball that bounces to the batsman instead of a good length is called a full pitch or over pitch ball, or is also described as a half volley
 acchhee length ke bajaay in gendon ko khelnaa ballebaaz ke liye adhik aasaan hota he kyonki seem se bouns hone ke baad unke paas hilne ke liye jayada samay nahin hota
 The ball placed near the batsman's foot is called a yorker, if it is bowled properly, it is a very effective length
 agar gend ballebaaz tak pahunchane se pehle bouns nahin ho paati to ise phul toss kaha jaataa he
 It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery, as it does not change its path due to the bounce off the pitch
 That's why three effective lengths) are easier for a batsman to hit, as control of the length is very important for a fast bowler
 duusari ore spin gendbaaz hameshaa acchhee length ko lakshya banaate hai parantu unhen line ko prabhavi banane or gend kii udaan par adhik niyantran rakhana hota he
 a fast bowler tries to stay physically fit throughout his cricket career, this period can be more than a decade
 yah kehane kii zarurat nahin he ki aisa karnaa bahut mushkil he or iske liye atyadhik anushaasan ke saath achche bhagya kii bhi zarurat hoti he
 Strike bowling is a type of bowling in which the bowler attempts to dismiss the batsman with high speed and quickness rather than throwing the ball in the air or off the pitch
 chotii ke ballebaazon ke khilaaf ye takneekein aamtaur par tabhi safal hoti hai jab tej gendbaaz ke dwaara tej yaa tej-madhyam shrenee main gend ko daalaa jaataa he
 Slow bowlers rarely use these techniques, especially against the end-of-the-line batsmen, but often the technique is reversed and the batsman is successful in scoring runs
 haalanki, aakraamak gendbaazi kii takneekon ko gendbaazi kii swing yaa seem takanic ke saath sanyukt rup se kaam main liya ja saktaa he taaki gendbaaz kisi bhi gati kii aisi gend daal sake, jise khelnaa sambhav naa ho
 inasvinging yorker ko vishesh rup se ghaatak mana jaataa he
 a bouncer is a ball that is inserted in the first half of the pitch, so that after that it has enough time to rise quickly and reach the height of his chest or head until reaching the batsman
 This may cause the batsman to face two types of problems
 agar vah ise khilne kaa prayaas karata he, to balla uski aankh ke str par hoga jisase shot lagane ke samay vah gend ko dekh nahin paayegaa or is shot ko khelnaa uske liye mushkil ho jayega
 If he leaves it, it can hit his chest or head and sometimes he may get hurt
 isi kaaran se, bounsar ko intimidtary gendbaazi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The normal response of a batsman to a bouncer is to duck it down, but this requires intense reflexes and reaction and sometimes the ball hits the batsman
 balle ko sidhaa kar ke apane sir ko bachaane kaa prayaas karnaa is sthiti main ek saamaanya pratikriya he, lekin agar sambhav ho to aisa nahin kiya janaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se gend ek aniyantrit kone par laut jaati he or ise aasaani se kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 Most of the batsmen are filled with panic and lose their wickets, thus adversely affecting the career of many batsmen
 shaareerik rup se shaktishaalee ballebaaz aksar aisi gend ko upar aane ke samay hit karata he, chaahe vah use dekh nahin paa rahaa hota, chunki yah asaamaanya nahin he, is sthiti main gend kii tej gati or ballebaaz ke balle donon ke sanyukt prabhaav ke kaaran gend boundry se baahar chali jaati he
 There is also the possibility that the wicket-keeper attempts to stop the ball, so for a skilled batsman this ball can be expensive in terms of runs
 ek dhimi gend vah gend he jise ection or ran-ap ke shabdon main saamaanya gati se daalaa jaataa he or isaki gati ko kam karne ke liye isaki grip ko halke se badal diya jaataa he
 This betrays the batsman, as he prepares to play the high-speed ball, suddenly his shot time is lost as the ball speeds down
 aamtaur par iske parinamswaroop gend balle se takaraakar neeche kii taraf chali jaati he or balle kii gati dhimi rah jaati he
 Collides with energy, so energy transfers and speed decreases)
 Also, when the bat hits the ball, it has moved a bit and is in the upper part of its arc, causing the ball to return to a larger angle after being separated from the bat
 is sangyojan ke parinamswaroop dhimi gati se aati hui gend kaich ho jaati he, yah apekshaakrit ek aasaan kaich hota he
 In any case, the batsman plays this shot so quickly that it becomes clean bowled
 kai prakaar kii grip main se ek ko daayin ore dikhaaya gaya he
 Inevitably the only difference is that the middle and the finger tips are away from each other and come down either side of the seam
 iske kaaran jab gend haath se chhootati he, is par adhik khinchaav padataa he or delivery kii gati kam ho jaati he
 Slower balls are also bowled by the off spinner using off break grip and finger action
 kabhi kabhi ek leg spin grip or rist ection kaa upyog karke yaa gend ke upari hisse ko keval ek anguli kaa sahaara dekar bhi dhimi gend daali ja sakati he
 Slower balls are often effective against a batsman who wants to score fast
 natijatan, ek divasiy cricket ke saath isaki prabhavita bad gayi he or vishesh rup se ek pari ke ant main yah phydemand sabit hoti he jab ballebaaz aakraamak tareeke se score banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa hota he
 a more experienced batsman adjusts to the mid-stroke, at which time he hits the ball from the middle of the bat
 dhimi gend ke ek or prakaar ko slobe kaha jaataa he
 It is inserted with the top fingers only
 iskaa uddeshy hota he ek "bimar" daalana, delivery kaa yah prakaar gend ko ajeeb tareeke se deliver karata he or yah yorker length tak pahunch jaati he
 It was often balls delivered by Chris Cairns to Chris Red, ducking into full length and blowing the stumps
 yorker ek aisi gend hoti he jo thik ballebaaz ke pairon ke saamne pich par bouns hoti he, yah kshetra block hole kehalaata he
 Because of the batsman's general attitude and the regular length of the cricket bat, the bat is not usually placed near the ground when the batsman is preparing to strike the ball
 isliye yorker ko khilne ke liye ballebaaz ko turant apane balle kii unchai ko badalanaa padataa he, jaise hi use gyaat hota he kii gendbaaz ne yorker daali he
 It is difficult and often the ball goes out of the middle gap and breaks the wicket
 is prakaar kii delivery ko safaltaapurvak khel janaa ek yorker ko diging out karnaa kehalaata he
 The yorker requires very precise bowling, because if it is put too long, it will be full toss or full pitch delivery, which is easy for the batsman to play, because the ball comes to the bat without bouncing
 is
 ise hairaan karne vaali gend ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 For this two reasons, the yorker is not a commonly delivered delivery in most circumstances
 ek divasiy cricket main ek pari kii antim pravasthaaon main, ballebaaz har gend par prahaar karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 In such circumstances, the yorker is particularly an effective delivery
 is samay main yah wicket lene main madad karti he or gend ko boundry tak jane se rokatii he
 Therefore, under these circumstances a yorker is often thrown, in such a situation bowlers who can bowl a yorker are eligible for the award
 seem gendbaazi main gend kii seem kaa upyog is prakaar se kiya jaataa he kii yah jab pich par takaraati he to apratyaashit rup se bouns ho jaati he
 a good batsman anticipates where the ball will bounce and it gives him an idea of what his height will be when the ball reaches him
 By creating changes in the bounce, the bowler creates the possibility that the batsman may have made a mistake in his guess and lost his wicket
 seem delivery ko kisi bhi gati ke saath daalaa ja saktaa he, parantu seem gend daalane vaale gendbaaz madhyam, madhyam-tej yaa tej-madhyam gati se gend daalate hai
 The basic technique of seam bowling is normal fast bowling or slow ball grip and an attempt to ensure that the seam always remains upright until the ball hits the pitch
 agar seem sidhi khadi avasthaa main he or gend apane kshitij aksh par spin ho rahi he, koi saraahneey maganas prabhaav utpann nahin hoga or gend hawa main gati nahin karegi
 gend kii seem ko uthaaya jaataa he or jisase bouns or gati main badlaav utpann hota he agar yah pich ko hit karne vaali gend kaa pehla hissaa he
 Seam bowlers can benefit greatly from particular types of pitches
 sakht pich jisaki sataha kati fatty hoti he, seem gendbaazi ke liye sarvshereshth hoti he, kyonki pich ke sakht hone ke kaaran gend adhik aasaani se bina apni gati khoye bouns hoti he, jabaki sataha ke asamtal hone ke kaaran gend apratyaashit rup se bouns hoti he, jab vah pich se takaraati he
 This is called variable bounce
 kabhi kabhi atyadhik sakht or asamtal pich ko khilne ke liye khatarnaak ghoshit kar diya jaataa he kyonki ballebaaz gend ke bare main koi purvanumaan nahin laga saktaa or iske parinamswaroop baar baar unke sharir par gend ke hit hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Green pitches are also helpful for seam bowlers, as small tufts of grass serve an uneven surface, although the effect is mixed because the green surface also slows the ball
 seem gendbaaz atyadhik chapati or samtal sataha par prabhavi nahin hote or seem gendbaaz aksar aisi sataha par gendbaazi kii ugr ranneeti or / yaa bowling katrs kaa istemaal karte hai
 The term cutter is used to describe a fast ball that is spinning
 yah ek aise prakaar kii delivery he jo seem ko sidhaa rakhane ke bajaay vipareet aksh ke chaaron or gumti he
 Although this type of rotation is not as beneficial as spin bowling, the small changes it produces can be inconvenient for a batsman, due to the speed of the ball
 kattar seem gendbaaz ke liye prabhavi tarika he
 If they are not getting more help from the pitch then they can benefit from this type of ball movement
 seem ke chaaron or ghurnan karne vaali gend jab pich se takaraati he tab vah daayin yaa baayin taraf chali jaati he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki gend kis taraf spin ho rahi he
 The ball bouncing to the right is called an off cutter as it moves from an off stump to a leg stump for a right-handed batsman
 iske vipareet, baayin or bouns hone vaali gend leg kattar kehalaati he kyonki yah ek daayen haath ke ballebaaz ke liye leg stump se of stump kii taraf jaati he
 The cutter is usually inserted so that it hits the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and goes away from the wicket
 isse gend balle ke madhya bhaag se takaraane ke bajaay uske bahari kinare se takaraayegi or laut kar aane par iske kaich honi kii sambhaavna bad jaayegi
 The bowler uses a different type of grip or grip to insert a cutter type of ball
 daayin or grip ke do prakaar darshaae gaye hai, sabase upar vaala leg kattar utpann karata he jabaki neeche vaala ek of kattar utpann karata he
 Similarly, to change the grip, the bowler has to bring his fingers down to the side of the ball, to produce the necessary spin when releasing the ball
 Cutter bowling increases the stretch on the ball and reduces the speed of the ball like a slow ball and also helps to confuse the batsman
 swing gendbaaz seem gendbaaz ke vipareet gend ko pich se dur naa daalkar, ise hawa main daalata he
 Normal or traditional swing bowling is done by lifting the seam of the ball, and traditional swing is usually highest when the ball is new and therefore has a clear seam
 jaise jaise gend puraani ho jaati he, ise swing karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, lekin aisa kiya ja saktaa he agar kshetrarakshan karne vaali team gend ke ek said ko tareeke se polish kar de or duusari said ko bina polish ke hi rahane diya jaae
 jab gend kii ek said ko atyadhik polish kar diya jaataa he or duusari said ko chhod diya jaataa he or ise tezi se daalaa jaataa he, yah reverse swing utpann karti he jisase gend parmparik swing kii tarah vipareet disha main swing ho jaati he
 Contrary to popular opinion, this swing does not occur because air flows faster over the smooth or "shiny" side than on the rough side
 swing ek said se gend par kaam karne vaale ek shuddh bal ke kaaran utpann hota he; arthath vah said jisaki seemaa parat adhik ashaant hoti he
 For traditional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction in which it is raised determine the direction of the swing
 gend ke koniya seem ke kaaran, seem ke upar se bahane vaali hawa is said par ashaanti utpann karti he, jis taraf seem mud jaati he
 This causes the liquid boundary layer to separate from the ball surface compared to the other side where the laminar layer boundary first separates
 This creates a net pressure difference, thus the net force moves the ball in the direction of the angular seam and swings it
 paaramparik swing gendbaazi ko seem kone ke saath deliver kiya jaataa he taaki gend kii chikani or polish kii hui sataha saamne kii ore hoti he, gend ko seem kii disha main arthath khurdari sataha kii ore gati detii he
 a swinging ball is called an out swinger if it moves away from the batsman, or it is called an inswinger, if it moves towards the batsman
 adhikansh maamalon main outswinger ko adhik khatarnaak gend kaha jaataa he, kyonki agar ballebaaz ise pahchaan naa paae to yah balle ke madhya bhaag se takaraane ke bajaay isaki bahari kinare se takaraati he or slip ho jeet hai, ise is avasthaa main aasaani se kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 Inswinger also has its own importance, especially when combined with the yorker, as inswinger collides with the inner edge of the bat and breaks the wicket, or hits the batsman's pad instead of the bat, There is a possibility of LBW as a result
 swing gendbaazi ko mote taur par jaldi hone vaali swing yaa der se hone vaali swing main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he kii apane prakshep vakr path ke dauraan yah apni disha ko kab badalati he- gend jitani baad main swing hoti he, ballebaaz ke liye swing ke anusaar apane shot ko samyojit karne kii sambhaavna utani hi kam ho jaati he
 Swing balls are also inserted with the same grip and technique as the grip and technique used in fast bowling
 haalanki seem ko sidhaa rakhane ke bajaay halke se kone par jhukaa diya jaataa he or gend kii ek dhimi grip kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 For an outswinger, the shiny side of the ball is close to the batsman and the seam is tilted at an angle in the opposite direction, while for the inswinger, the rough side should be closer to the batsman and the seam must be tilted towards him
 Swing is difficult with a cutter grip, since the ball spins during flight, any rough or shiny surface can come in front of the batsman, as it is flying in the air
 khel main kai khilaadi, tippaneekar or prashansak is baat se sahmati jataate hai ki nam yaa ghatatope paristhitiyon main gend ko adhik aasaani se swing kiya ja saktaa he or saath hi ek divasiy match main prayukt safed gend kii tulana main test cricket main kaam main lee jane vaali laal gend adhik swing hoti he
 Reverse swing is a phenomenon that causes the ball to swing in the opposite direction
 jab gend reverse swing hoti he, us samay gend chamakili said kii ore swing karti he
 The reverse swing occurs slightly later than the traditional swing and occurs more quickly, both factors increasing the batsman's difficulty in preparing to hit the ball
 saamaanya swing kii tulana main reverse swing paristhitiyon par adhik nirbhar karata he, isliye ise lagaataar hasil karnaa lagbhag asambhav he
 The reverse swing usually does not occur until the ball has been used for about 45 overs and requires hot and dry weather
 reverse swing kii takanic ko sabase pehle 1980 ke dashak main pakistani gendbaazon ke dwaara khoja gaya tha lekin tab se lekar ab tak yah cricket khilne vaale sabhi deshon main fail chuki he
 In the reverse swing, the rough surface is placed forward
 seem ko usee tarah se kone par jhukaaya jaataa he jaise paaramparik swing main parantu seemaa parat donon sidon par ashaant hoti he
 The net effect of the seam and rough surface is that the ball actually swings in the opposite direction to which the swing is bent
 acchhee reverse swing gendbaazi ke liye aavashyak he ki gendbaaz bahut tej gati se gend daale, yah gati duniya main gine chune tej gendbaaz hi hasil kar sakate hai
 Now, in one day cricket it is mandatory to change the ball after 35 overs, this is done to reduce the reverse swing
 is prakaar se, kshetrarakshan karne vaali team ke liye 35 over ke baad gend ko badalanaa anivaary hota he or isliye reverse swing nahin hota
 The dipper is a swinging ball that is thrown with the intention of throwing a yorker or full toss, but it turns into a dipper as opposed to the bowler's choice
 indippar daayen haath ke ballebaaz kii ore gati karti he jabaki outdippar usase dur jaati he
 To be effective, a dipper must have a lot of swing to vary its speed, as the ball is not bouncing on the pitch
 haalanki, kyonki aamtaur par ballebaaz ummid karata he ki phul toss par ran bananaa aasaan he, dippar hairaan karne vaali gend hoti he or ise khelnaa bahut mushkil ho saktaa he vishesh rup se yadi gendbaaz bahut sateek ho or phul toss ke bajaay yorker daalane main safal ho jaye
 Furious or aggressive bowling is a bowling strategy in which the bowler bowls the ball with the intention of hitting the batsman with the ball
 yah kuch had tak cricket ke niyamon ke khilaaf he, isamen ve niyam bhi shaamil hai jisamen bounsar ke atyadhik upyog kii anumati nahin di jaati, isamen "bimar" ke upyog kii bhi anumati nahin hoti, jiskaa lakshya puri tarah se ballebaaz ke sir ko hit karnaa hota he
 Successful offensive bowling usually involves a mixture of bouncers and short pitch deliveries, aiming at the batsman's head, chest, and ribs
 is ke peeche mukhya iraadaa hota he, ballebaaz kaa dhyaan bhatkaana, taaki vah galati kare or apana wicket kho baithe
 Often the wicket does not fall on the ball of a bouncer or short pitch, but instead the wicket falls on a normal delivery that the batsman was not expecting, or the batsman fails to play in his normal way
 iske peeche ek pramukh drushtikon hota he, ballebaaz kii chaati ko lakshya banaate hue kai short pich kii gende daalana, jisase ballebaaz balle ko unchaa karke apane aap ko bachaane or pichley pair par khilne ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he or iske baad tej yorker daali jaati he, jisamen stump ke aadhaar ko lakshya bane jaataa he
 If the batsman raises the bat and prepares to play on the back foot, the amount of time the bowler takes to prepare for it is enough to cause the batsman to panic and thus lose his wicket
 ek tej gendbaaz bhi ballebaaz ko krodhit karne yaa use chidhaane ke liye aakraamak gendbaazi kar saktaa he, jisamen vah ballebaaz ko lakshya banaate hue gend daalata he
 Aggressive bowling is used to varying degrees by every fast bowler and even the best batsman is sometimes seriously injured and forced to leave the game
 lagbhag sabhi maamalon main maukhik 'apshabdon' kaa hamalaa bhi iske saath kiya jaataa he
 Excessive use of offensive tactics by good bowlers is not considered in the spirit of the game and iska virodh by many teams and players
 iske atyadhik upyog kaa ek udhaaharan tha bodiline shrinkhalaa, jisamen tatkaaleen english cricket captain duglas jardin ne australian cricket team ke star khilaadi donald breadman par aakraamak gendbaazi kaa prahaar kiya
 In this he was putting very fast and short balls, aiming at the batsman's body, his intention behind this was to hurt him personally
 bodiline shrinkhalaa ke baad cricket ke kai niyamon main parivartan kiya gaya, taaki bhavishya main is prakaar kii ranneeti ke upyog ko roka ja sake
 aise kai kshetrarakshakon par pratibandh laga diya gaya jo is prakaar kii ranneeti kaa upyog karte the
 Because almost all cricket teams have many fast bowlers of varying speed and style, the technique of fast bowling varies not only with the field but also with the bowler
 gendon ko daalane ke anukram ke saath bhi is takanic main parivartan aata he
 The exact strategy depends on many factors, these factors include the state of the game, the state of the pitch, the weather and relative energy, and the level of skill of the different players who bowl
 tej gendbaazi ke liye atyadhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, adhikansh tej gendbaazon se ummid kii jaati he kii ve lagaataar ek saath chaar se chah over tak gendbaazi karne ke baad hi aaraam karen
 paristhitiyon ke anusaar unhen isse zyada samay tak bhi gendbaazi kerani pad sakati he, lekin isse aamtaur par unki prabhavita main kami aati he or gendbaaz thak jaataa he
 The choice of what type of ball will be bowled and the order in which the balls are bowled depends on the bowler himself
 adhikansh pakshon main tej gendbaazon kaa ek mishran maujuud hota he, jo ugr or / yaa seem takneekon main visheshgy hote hai or kuch gendbaaz swing main visheshgy hote hai
 When the ball is new it usually swings very little but it exhibits extreme speed, bounce and a variety of seams
 isiilie nayi gend se gendbaazi karne ke liye seem gendbaazon ko chunaa jaataa he, jab pari shuru hoti he, yaa jab khel ke dauraan nayi gend laayi jaati he tab seem gendbaazon ko gendbaazi karne kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 The fielding side is also given the option of playing with the 80-over ball
 iske vipareet, jab gend reverse swing karnaa shuru kar detii he, us samay swing gendbaaz adhik prabhavi hote hai
 Reverse swing bowlers can produce excessive speed in balls older than 80 overs
 pehle 10 over ke baad agranukram main aamtaur par do seem gendbaazon kii apeksha kii jaati he, is samay ke baad gend swing hone lagati he or un donon yaa donon main se ek ko swing yaa spin gendbaazi kaa mauka diya jaataa he
 This is why most teams have at least two seam bowlers, called opening bowlers
 puraani gend ke saath aamtaur par seem gendbaazi aprabhavi ho jaati he or 60 over ke baad lagbhag bekaar ho jaati he or iske parinamswaroop isliye team main swing ke saath spin gendbaaz bhi hone chahie
 The fielding of a fast bowler is usually fiery, so in that sense it can be said that its purpose is to take wickets and not to stop the batsman from scoring runs
 kabhi kabhi, vishesh rup se tab jab kshetrarakshan team baad main ballebaazi karti he or lakshya score banaae kaa prayaas kar rahi hoti he, us samay surakshatmak kshetrarakshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As a general rule, protective fast bowling is a difficult task - it is better for spin bowlers
 tej gendbaazi kii vibhinn takneekein teen tareeke se ballebaaz ko out kar sakati hai
 They can either be bowled or lbw with speed, the yorker or by the seam or swing can the ball be thrown towards the batsman, in which context the placement of the fielder is irrelevant
 swing yaa seem kaa upyog gend ko ballebaaz se dur daalane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, is maamle main gend balle ke bahari kinare se takaraayegi or udaan ke dauraan kaich kii ja sakati he
 a badly played bouncer either hits the outside edge or goes up or can result in a foul play time and can be caught near the boundary
 iske liye aakraamak tej gendbaazi karne vaale sabase prabhavi kshetrarakshakon ko outfield or slip cordan or gulii main tainaat kiya jaataa he, kyonki in sthitiyon main ballebaaz ke kaich hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 There is the added advantage of deploying fielders in the outfield, which reduces the number of places for a batsman to score runs in the boundary
 anya najadik kshetrakshan sthitiyaan jaise sili mid on / of or kai midwicket sthitiyaan aamtaur par anaavashyak hoti hai
 Conversely, a defensive zone for fast bowling packs multiple positions around the batsman such as gullies, points and full circle
 ek yaa do slip or ek yaa do outfilder kaich kii sthiti main rahete hai
 Because the batsman usually tries to put a shot on the ground to avoid the risk of a catch, in this type of fielding, the entire field is so closed that if the batsman makes even one attempt, he can be run out
 rakshaatmak tej gendbaazi mushkil kaam he kyonki ek kushal ballebaaz is prakaar kii takanic ke liye taiyaar rahata he or boundry se ran score kar letaa he, jab vah midwicket ring par yaa kisi maujuud outfilder se dur hit karata he
 The primary goal of any bowler is to take the wicket of the batsman
 doosraa lakshya hota he use ran banane se rokna
 dusre vaala aksar pehle vaale ke liye maarg banataa he, kyonki jab ballebaaz ran nahin bana pataa, vah pareshaan ho jaataa he or score banane ke liye jokhim bhare shot lagane kaa prayaas karata he
 In addition, a bowler would usually bowl for the same batsman in a row to prevent the batsman from scoring runs, giving him the opportunity to establish some sort of technical sequence
 iske anusaar, wicket par lagaataar gend daalana tej gendbaaz ke liye uchit drushtikon nahin he, kyonki yah ballebaaz ko spasht or aasaan pratikriya ke sanket detaa he
 The batsman saves his wicket and also faces a bad ball
 iske peeche ek or drushtikon he ek line or length kii gendbaazi ke dwaara anischitata utpann karnaa, jisase ballebaaz yah faislala nahin le paata ki vah hamalaa kare yaa apane aap ko bachaae
 mishrit prakaar kii delivery main ballebaaz ko yah nahin paata hota ki agali gend kisi hogi
 In a good bowling, most balls are usually swings or seams that come up to the waist, coming out of the off stump and away from the batsman, as this is the area where it is difficult for the batsman to respond most appropriately
 
 aam bhinnataaon or unki ranneetiyon kii charchaa neeche kii gayi he
 The exact balls the bowler chooses during an over depends on the position of the match, depending on the skill of the batsman, as well as how long the batsman has been at the crease
 us ballebaaz par hamalaa karnaa aasaan hota he jo abhi abhi wicket par aayaa he, use out karne ke liye bounsar or short pich kii sahaayta se us par hamalaa kiya ja saktaa he or use zyada samay tak aakraamak ballebaazi ke liye tikne se roka ja saktaa he
 Short balls are risky for a batsman who has stayed at the crease as they take easy boundaries, but most bowlers still bowl mixed balls, so that the batsman keeps trying to guess
 zyaadaatar ballebaaz front yaa back foot shot lene kaa prayaas karte hai or yah gendbaaz kii gend ke chunaav ko prabhavit karata he
 Short ball is difficult to play on the front foot, so bowlers prefer short ball to the batsman who plays on the front foot
 isi tarah, yorker or phul pich gend ko back foot par khelnaa mushkil he isliye is prakaar kii delivery kaa upyog back foot vaale ballebaazon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 If a bowler successfully puts such balls in opposition to the batsman, he can surprise the batsman by suddenly putting the opposite type of ball - a yorker after several short pitches or a bouncer after several full balls
 a batsman who is not a good observer loses his wicket inadvertently in such a situation
 ek or bhinnata, vishesh rup se us ballebaaz ke liye jo wicket par tik chukaa he or swatantra rup se ran bananaa shuru kar rahaa he, yah he ki thik of stump ke baahar se hamale kii line ko badalanaa or sidhe leg stump par gendbaazi karnaa
 The batsman has to react appropriately to these types of balls as either he can score runs or is at the risk of LBW, but when he does so his bat comes over the leg side and leaves the off side unprotected
 is
 agar gendbaaz swing yaa seem takanic ke saath of said par paryaapt gati utpann kar saktaa he to yah aksar balle ke bahari kinare se takaraati he or sidhe stump par ja lagati he
 It should be remembered that surprise is a big element in bowling, bowlers often use these common strategies to confuse the batsman, so that he makes a wrong shot
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek nae ballebaaz par yorker daalana jo bounsar kii ummid kar rahaa tha, yaa kam se kam kai baar maanak line or length kii gend kai balbajon ko pehali hi gend main out kar detii he
 Human body cannot take the burden of fast bowling
 tej gendbaazi puure sharir par atyadhik dabaav utpann karti he, vishesh rup se pair, peeth or kandhon par
 In this, many parts of the body are at risk of injury
 isamen takhne kii haddi tuutane kii sambhaavna hoti he, kyonki delivery ke samay pair jab jameen par padataa he, to is par kaaphi dabaav padataa he
 There is a possibility of spasm and strain in the back as the body is rotated in an arc at the time of delivery of the ball
 kandhe ke snaayu ke fatne kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki gend ko daalane se thik pehle kandhe par achaanak ek jhatka lagata he
 He is the top fast bowler who has scored at least 850 points in the ICC Player Rankings as of June 2009

 In mathematics, complex numbers are extensions of real numbers
 kisi vaastavik sankhya main ek kaalpanik bhaag jod dene se samishra sankhya banati he
 i is associated with the imaginary part of a complex number that satisfies the following relation: kisi bhi samishra sankhya ko a + bi, ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen a or b dono hi vaastavik sankhyaayein hai
 In a + bi, a is called the real part and b is the imaginary part
 udhaaharan: 3 + 4i ek samishra sankhya he
 Representing a complex number as a + bi is called the Cartesian form of a complex number
 samishra sankhya z = x + iy ko dhruviya nirdeshaankon ke rup main bhi nirupit kar sakate hai
 Polar coordinates r = | z | ≥ 0, is called the absolute value or modulus of the complex number
 isi prakaar φ = arg ko z kaa konank kehete hai
 Angle φ = Angle can be obtained by adding 2π to that negative value if it is in the middle of the main value
 nimnlikhit rup dhruviya swaroop kehalaata he: It is also denoted by cis φ which is an abbreviated form of cos φ + i sin φ
 ular kaa sutara kaa prayog karke ise nimnlikhit tareeke se bhi likh sakate hai: This form is called exponential form

 Which has a dimension and θ art
 dhyaan rahe ki electronic or vidyut abhiyantriki main i ke bajaay j kaa prayog kiya jaataa he kyonki i ke dwaara vidyut dhara kaa nirupan kiya jaataa he
 The absolute value of a complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ {i \ phi}} is defined as | z | = r { \ displaystyle | z | = r}
 Algebraically, if z = x + yi { \ displaystyle z = x + yi}, then | z | = x 2 + y 2
 { \ displaystyle | z | = { \ sqrt {x ^ {2} + y ^ {2}}}
} The absolute value has three important properties: for all complex numbers z and w
 These imply that | 1 | = 1 { \ displaystyle | 1 | = 1} and | z / w | = | z | / | w | { \ displaystyle | z / w | = | z | / | w |}
 By defining the distance function d = | z - w | { \ displaystyle d = | zw |}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a metric space and we can therefore talk about limits and continuity
 The complex conjugate of the complex number z = x + y i { \ displaystyle z=x+yi} is defined to be x − y i { \ displaystyle x-yi}, written as z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} or z ∗ { \ displaystyle z^{*} \ ,} 
 As seen in the figure, z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} is the "reflection" of z about the real axis, and so both z + z ̄ { \ displaystyle z+{ \ bar {z}}} and z ⋅ z ̄ { \ displaystyle z \ cdot { \ bar {z}}} are real numbers
 Many identities relate complex numbers and their conjugates: c + di ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle c + d \ , \ mathrm {i} \ neq 0} yoga: Subtract: guna: run: z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{ \ mathrm {i} \ varphi }} kaa n { \ displaystyle n} vaan ghaat is prakaar nikaala jaataa he Or for the Cartesian form z = a + bi { \ displaystyle z = a + b \ mathrm {i}} kisi samishra aadhaar par samishra ghaataank ke liye saamaanya sutara he: Here ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ ln} will be assumed to be the principal of the complex quadratic
 yahan bahut saavdhaanee kii jarurat hoti he; dekhiye - The following formula is used to extract the n { \ displaystyle n} th root of the complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ { \ mathrm {i} \ phi}}: jahaan k { \ displaystyle k} kaa maan 0, 1, 


, n − 1 { \ displaystyle 0,1, \ ldots ,n-1} 
 Thus the total number of n { \ displaystyle n} th roots of a number is n { \ displaystyle n}
 samishra sankhya z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{i \ phi }} ke prakritik laghuganak kaa mukhya maan hoga: The last formula is very useful for deriving the inverse of a complex number, if that number is given in Cartesian form
