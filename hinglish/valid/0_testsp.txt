 Following the unexpected success of the first film, Walt Disney Pictures reported that a composition triad was in the works
 samundar ke lutere: murde kaa khazaana teen saal baad 2006 main jari kii gai
 Its answer story proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide on the day of its premiere
 In the end it grossed a total of $ 1,066,179,725 at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth and fastest film to reach this amount

 Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology, which was being used to revive the style that had disappeared after the Hollywood golden era, and he remembered his childhood memories of riding, he felt That the film was an occasion to pay tribute to its "scary and funny" tone

 Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew that he would play it not with an effort to complicate but with a simple villain that suited the tone of the story
 Orlando Bloom read the script after suggesting Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly

 There were talks with Tom Wilkinson to play Swan Governor, but the role was passed on to Jonathan Price, who Depp considered his role model

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans

 In ancient times architecture was said to be the mother of all arts
 kintu vritti ke parivartan ke saath or sambhddha vyavsaayon ke bhaag lene par yah samaveshak sangrakshan kii muhar ab nahin rahi
 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period
 yah vahiin tak thik he jahaan tak saamaajik evam anya uplabdhiyon kaa prabhaav he
 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization
 jahaan tak puratatviya prabhaav he, yah thik he kintu vaastukala ke itihaas par ek sankshipt drushtipaat se yah spasht ho jayega ki maanav ke pracheenatam prayaas shikariyon ke adikalin gupha-awaason, charavaahon ke charm-tambuon or kisaanon ke jhopadon ke rup main dekh padate hai

 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation

 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory

 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he

 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies
 yadi is sandarbh main dekhe to vaastukala vyakti ke apane sarjak man kii sampurna evam suviksit rachana honi chahie, jo swayambhu ke ucch str tak pahunchati he

 In numerical analysis, the Newton method is an iterative method of deriving the root of a function with a real value, by which it is progressively derived from the approximate value of the original to obtain a more accurate root
 isko 'newton-repson vidhi' bhi kehete hai
 The description of this method for functions with a variable is as follows: mana vaastavik x ke liye falan ƒ or iskaa avkalaj ƒ ', diya hua he
 This method starts by taking the first approximation of the origin x0 to find the origin of the function f
 ab nimnlikhit sutara se mul kaa adhik yatharth maan x1 nikaala jaataa he: This process is repeated again and again until sufficiently accurate values of the original are attained
 is vidhi ko jyamitiya rup se nimnlikhit chalit-chitra dwaara samajha ja saktaa he: Newton's method is a very powerful technique
 isaki abhisarita dwighati hoti he
 But there are some problems of this method also
 is vidhi kii karypranali samajhane ke liye is udhaaharan kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Let be a positive root of the equation cos ⁡ = x 3 { \ displaystyle \ cos = x ^ {3}}
 ab is sameekaran kaa rup is prakaar badalte hai: Since cos ⁡ ⩽ 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos \ leqslant 1} for all values of x and x3> 1 for x> 1, the origin of this equation will be between 0 and 1
 mana mul x 0 = 0, 5 { \ displaystyle x_{0}=0,5} he
 The first 7 digits of this root are equal to the first 7 digits of the original root
 yadi isse adhik yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin he to mul kaa yahi maan lekar gananaa kaary samaapt kar sakate hai

 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden

 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda

 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 Its structure is very scientific and the language is very concise and simple
 isamen chaar adhyyon main 123 shloke hai
 Aryabhatiya starts from the Dasagitika pad
 iske chaar adhyay is prakaar hai : 1
 das-geetika-pad 2
 ganit-paad - khagoleey achar tathaa jya-sarini ; gananaaon ke liye aavashyak ganit 3
 kaal-kriya-pad - Time-division and rules for calculating the position of planets 4
 gol-paad - trikoshmetiya samasyaon ke hal ke liye niyam; grahan kii gananaa Geetikapada is the smallest, of only 13 verses, but a lot of material has been filled in it
 iske liye inhone aksharo dwaara sankshep main sankhya likhane kii swanirmit ek anokhi reeti kaa vyavhaar kiya he, jisamen vyajanno se saral sankhyaayein or swaron se shunya kii ginati suchit kii jaati thi
 For example khyughri = 43,20,000 main 2 ke liye kh likhaa gaya he or 30 ke liye y
 Both letters are written together and contain a quantity of U, which is the same as 10,000; Hence Khu means 3,20,000; The meaning of Ghrit means 4 and the meaning of r is 10,00,000, hence Ghrit means 40,00,000
 In this way, the above value of blood is obtained
 sankhya likhane kii is reeti main sabase bada dosha yah he ki yadi aksharon main thodaa sa bhi her pher ho jaay to badi baari bhul ho sakati he
 The second drawback is that if the amount of r is applied in L, its form is the same as that of the vowel, but there is a big difference in the meanings of the two
 in dosha ke hote hue bhi is pranali ke liye aryabhat kii pratibha kii prashansa kerani hi padati he
 In this, he has written many things in a few verses; Literally, the ocean is filled in Gagar

 One thing to note here is that Aryabhata also gave the number of rotations of the Earth in a Mahayuga, as he considered the daily rotation of the Earth
 is baat ke liye parvarti acharya brahmagupta ne inaki ninda kii he
 In the next verse, the number of planetary highs and the great epochs of the path is mentioned
 tisare shloke main bataaya gaya he ki brahma ke ek din main kitne manwantar or yug hote hai or vartmaan kalp ke aarambh se lekar mahabharat yuddh kii samaptiwale din tak kitne yug or yugpad biit chuke the
 In the next seven verses, the relationship of the zodiac, fraction, art, etc
, the expansion of the sky, the magnitude of the diameter of the Earth and the diameter of the Sun, the Moon and the planets, the revolution and deflection of the planets, the locations of their addresses and scales, their dims and There is a table of values of the spheres at a difference of 3 degrees 45 arts and the magnitude of the gaps

 ek jagah bataaya gaya he ki paridhi ke chathe bhaag ko jya uski trigya ke samaan hoti he
 The verse states that if the diameter of the circle is 20,000 then its circumference is 62,832
 isse paridhi or vyas kaa sambandh chauthe dashamalav sthaan tak shuddh aa jaataa he
 The two verses describe the method of finding the volumes, which shows how Aryabhata made the table of the blocks
 aage vrutt, tribhuj or chaturbhuj khinchne kii reeti, samtal dharaatal ke parakhane kii reeti, urdhwadhar ke parakhane kii reet, shanku or chaaya se chhayakarn jaanane kii reeti, kisi unche sthaan par rakhe hue deepak ke prakaash ke kaaran bani hui shaku kii chaaya kii lambaai jaanane kii reeti, ek hi rekha par sthit deepak or do shankuon ke sambandh ke prashn kii gananaa karne kii reeti, samakon tribhuj ke karn or anya do bhujaaon ke virgon kaa sambandh, vrutt kii jeeva or sharon kaa sambandh, do shlokon main shrenee ganit ke kai niyam, ek shloke main ek-ek babbti hui sankhyaon ke virgon or ghanon kaa yogafal jaanane kaa niyam, 2 - = 2 k kha ; do raashiyon kaa gunanfal or antar jaanakar raashiyon ko alag-alag karne kii reeti, byaaj kii dar jaanane kaa ek niyam jo vargasamikaran kaa udhaaharan he, trairashik kaa niyam, bhinnon ko ekahar karne kii reeti, bijganit ke saral sameekaran or ek vishesh prakaar ke yugapat samikarnon par aadhaarit prashnon ko hal karne ke niyam, do grahon kaa yutikaal jaanane kaa niyam or kuttak niyam bataae gaye hai

 Its place there is no less than that of Savitri Satyavan
 bihula apane pati bala lakhandar ko, jise, saanp kaat khaataa he, bachaane ke liye swarg jaati hai or vahaan apane abhisht ko praapt karti hai
 Bihula Sati is worshiped on the day of Nagpanchami in eastern Bihar and Bengal
 gayak is gaatha ko badi hi shraddha ke saath gaate hai
 This saga is more popular among women
 is lokgatha kaa maithili or banglaa rup bhi miltaa he
 The name of Raja Gopichand is the official of a specific place under the Nath sect
 nau naathon main inhen bhi ek nath kaa sthaan praapt tha
 His saga is especially prevalent in Jogis
 gopichand rajpaat, bhogavilas sab kuch chhodkar mata minavati ke kehane par vairaygy grahan karne van main chale gaye
 The story of this sacrifice is prevalent in the folklore presented
 bharatvarsh kii praaia: samast janapadiya boliyon main gopichand kii gaatha prachlit he
 Since Gopichand was related to the Pala dynasty of Bengal, this saga is most popular in Bengal
 yah lokgatha bhojpuri, magahi, maithili, punjabi, sindhi ityadi main bhi pai jaati he
 King Bharthari was also a Nathpanthi
 nau naathon main inkaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 The account of King Bharathary and Queen Samadei is the theme of this folklore
 ise praaia: jogi log hi gaate hai
 King Bharthari was related to the dynasty of Ujjain
 kinhin kaarnon se kalantar main inhone guru gorakhnath kaa shishyatv sweekaar kror liya or apni yuva rani ko chhodkar yogi ban gaye
 Many of his texts are also found
 aisi dharna he ki ye raja vikramaditya ke bade bhai tathaa raja gopichand ke bhaanje the
 Looking carefully, it seems clear that the characteristics of folklore of all countries are almost the same
 lokgaathaon kii ye visheshtaayen hi praaia: unhen alankrita kavy se pruthak karti hai
 The main features are - lokgaathaon kii sabase ullekhneey visheshta yah he ki inke rachayita agyaat hai
 It seems that their authors were careless and forgot to give their names after the creation of long folklore
 yahi kaaran he ki parampara se chali aati hui lokgaathaon main jab log apane banaae hue pad jod dete hai tab pataa hi nahin chalata
 These folklore give a glimpse of the social status of the time
 lokgaathaon ke pramanik mul paath kaa abhaav miltaa he
 It is also natural because the author is unknown
 praapt lokgaathaon ke rachayita ek baar lokgaathaon kaa sutarapaat karke unhen samaaj ko saunp dete tathaa swayan hat jate hai, or uske baad lokgaathaon kii ek aisi nirantar dhara pravaahit hone lagati he jiskaa kabhi ant nahin hota
 Each era considers folklore as its personal property, and each singer adds a few lines as he wishes
 jaise jaise ye lokgathaayen ek gavaiye se duusare gavaiye ke paas jaati hai inamen parivartan hota jaataa he
 Thus it has become extremely impossible to find authentic text of these
 lokgaathaon main sangeet kii sthiti anivaary hoti he
 Since there is no euphemism of subtle sentiments in them, they lack literacy
 yadhyapi pracheen bhartiya lokgaathaon main praaia: nrity kaa samavesh anivaary tha, tathaapi dhire dhire yah gaun hota gaya or aaj to dikhaai hi nahin padataa
 Folklore, wherever it is, reaches a particular place and adopts its characteristics there
 unka nirmaan praaia: kisi ghatana ke kaaran hota he or inamen taddeshiy vaataavaran evam sthaniyata kaa samavesh ho jaataa he
 In 'loriki' a clear description of many of the villages of the Vihar is found
 'dholamaru' kii lokgatha main oont kaa vishesh mahatv he kyonki vahaan kaa yatayaat saadhan oont hi he
 Since the winter is more in the mountainous regions, the girls there tell their father not to marry me in such a place where the heat is too much and be disturbed by sweat
 maithili lokgaathaon main vahaan kii sthaneey prathaon kii jhaanki milti he
 The oral tradition in India has been in place since ancient times
 veda sahitya bhi isi paramparantargat guru shishyon ke madhyam se aage badhata rahaa or baad main lipibaddh kiya gaya
 Folktales were not scripted; But continues as an oral tradition
 vastav main inaki mahatta bhi tabhi tak he jab yah lipibaddh na hon
 After being written, their expansion stops and their naturalness is destroyed
 kaaran yah he ki jab tak ye maukhik parampara main rahati hai tab tak to lok kii saamagree rahati hai par jab lipibaddh ho jaati hai tab sahitya kii sampatti ho jaati hai
 Folktales are the wealth of the heart
 inamen apane aap hi maadhurya or swaabhaaviktaa aa jaati he
 The reason for the lack of ornate style in them is that it is not the property of any individual but the property of the whole society
 inaki utpatti chunki pracheen kaal se he tathaa us samay alankrita rup kaa vikaas nahin hua tha isliye alankrita style kaa abhaav swaabhaavik he
 There is an extreme lack of didactic tendency in folklore
 lokajeevan kaa sampurna chitra upasthit karnaa hi praaia: unka uddeshy hota he
 Singing folklore is only the work of singers
 usase kuch praapt kar lenaa shrotaaon kaa kaary hai
 There is a complete lack of personality of the writer in folklore
 chunki in gaathaon ke rachayita ke bare main yah nishchaypurvak nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah koi ek vishisht vyakti he, isliye uske vyaktitv kaa prabhaav bhi samaaj par nahin padataa
 These have only the primacy of the subject, the personality of the writer does not exist
 in gaathaon kaa kathanak atyant vistrut hota he
 Since the narrative songs are called folk songs, the story itself naturally increases with the expansion of the story
 iske vistaar kaa doosraa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki ise samaaj apni sampatti samajhataa he or manamaane dhang se sabhi isamen kuch na kuch badha dete hai
 Since folklore is only intended to tell the story, it becomes very long
 lokgaathaon kii ek ullekhneey visheshta uske tech padon kii punrariti he
 To make the song enjoyable and effective, the practice of singing the songs is found by repeating the songs evenly
 inaki is pravriti se yah vidit hota he ki ye gaathaayen samuhik rup se gaai jaati thim
 There are some benefits from this trend
 gaathaon ke gayan ke liye jab do varg ekatra hote hai tab tech padon kii punrariti se vaataavaran ojasvi ho jaataa he tathaa doosraa samooh bhi ub se batch jaataa he
 Listeners also feel pleasure from this trend and singers also feel relief and excitement
 in lokgaathaon kii aitihaasikta to hoti nahin, or yadi kisi prakaar kahin inkaa aitihaasik aadhaar mil bhi gaya to vah sandigdh hota he
 The folklore of 'alha', 'raja Gopichand', 'raja Bharthari', 'babu Kunwar Singh', etc
 has some support from the history, but there is no source of anything
 udaahranarth 'shobhanayake, banajaara', 'loriki' sorathi ityadi kaa itihaas main koi varnan nahin miltaa
 The Khadi and Village Industries Commission is a statutory body created by the Government of India under the 'khadi and Village Industries Commission Act 1956' of the Parliament
 yah bharat main khaadi or gramodyog se sambandhit sookshm, laghu or madhyam udyog mantralay ke andar aane vaali ek sheersh sanstha he, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy he - "gramin ilaakon main khaadi evam gramodyogon kii sthapana or vikaas karne ke liye yojana bananaa, prachaar karnaa, suvidhaayen or sahaayta pradaan karnaa he, jisamen vah aavashyaktaanusaar gramin vikaas ke kshetra main karyrat anya agenciyon kii sahaayta bhi le sakati he

 kachche maal ke rup main kapaas, resham yaa oon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, jinhen charakhe par katkar dhaagaa banaaya jaataa he
 Khadi was used as a political weapon in Mahatma Gandhi's Swadeshi movement in 1920
 khaadi ko kachche maal ke aadhaar par bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon se praapt kiya jaataa he - pashchim bengal, bihar, urisa or uttar purvi rajyon se reshmi maal praapt kiya jaataa he, jabaki kapaas kii prapti andhra pradesh, uttar pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal se hoti he
 Poly Khadi is cultivated in Gujarat and Rajasthan while Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir are known for woolen khadi
 koi bhi udyog jo gramin kshetra ke andar sthit hota he or jahaan prati karigar nishchit mudra nivesh ek lakh rupee se adhik nahin hota he
 Fixed currency investments can be converted by the central government of India as needed
 khaadi or gramodyog, donon main hi atyadhik shram kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the wake of industrialization and mechanization of almost all the processes, the importance of Khadi and Village Industries increases even more for a labor surplus country like India
 khaadi or gramin udyog kaa ek anya laabh yah bhi he ki inhen sthapit karne ke liye poonji kii aavashyaktaa nahin ke baraabar hoti he, jo inhen gramin garibon ke liye ek aarthik rup se vyavhaarya vikalp banaata he
 In view of low income, regional and rural / urban disparities, its importance in the context of India increases further
 ayog ke teen pramukh uddeshy hai jo iske kaaryon ko nirdeshit karte hai
 These are as follows - ayog vibhinn yojanaon or kaaryakramon ke karyanvayan or niyantran dwaara in uddeshyon ko praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he

 mantralay bhartiya kendra sarkaar se dhan praapt karata he or khaadi or gramodyog se sambandhit kaaryakramon or yojanaon ke kriyanvayan ke liye khaadi evam gramodyog ayog ko pahunchaata he
 The Khadi and Village Industries Commission then uses this fund to implement its programs
