 maanchitrkala ke antargat globe kii akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ko samtal dharaatal par sthanantarit karne kii vidhi ko maanchitr prakshep kehete hai
 The latitude and longitude lines drawn in this way are called "line traps"

 In the early period of the development of projections, scholars tried to display heaven by obscure methods of projections

 Eratosthenes, Ptolemy and Makenter's lifetimes have been important in the history of the development of interpolation
 taduparant satat rup se prakshepon kaa vikaas evam sanshodhan hota rahaa
 In order to move the latitude longitude lines of any map or any part of it, the globe is highlighted by covering it with a developable page or by placing a plane surface in a touching position at some point of the globe, and The shadow of type latitude longitude lines is projected
 is chaaya par hi sthaayee rekhaayen bana lee jaati hai
 The developable page is then cut and opened at a particular longitude
 inako jyamitiya athwa sandarsh prakshep kehete hai
 The above process is easily done with the help of a glass or wire globe
 sadaiv hi yah sambhav nahin ki uparyukt vidhi se prakshep banaae jaaen
 It is often required that interpolation is made with a particular goal in which the geometric or perspective method has to be disregarded and the latitude and longitude lines are drawn on the paper without projecting any shadows based on the principles of mathematics and calculations
 inako ajyamitiya athwa asandarsh prakshep kehete hai
 They are more useful
 upyog kii drushti se maanchitr kii teen visheshtaayen hoti hai : samakshetrafal, yathaakrit tathaa shuddh disha
 These three characteristics cannot be obtained purely on any simultaneous projection
 prayek prakshep par inamen se kisi na kisi visheshta kaa abhaav rahata he
 The names of the projections holding these characteristics in pure form are as follows: samakshetrafal prakshep : in prakshepon ke rekhajaal par bane hue akshansh deshaantareey chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal globe par pradarshit honevaale sangati chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal se maapkanupaat main samaan hota he kintu in prakshepon ke rekhajaal par khinche hue maanchitron kii akruti bhang ho jaati he
 Natural projection: The shape of the maps drawn on these projections is pure
 akruti ko shuddh rakhane ke hetu akshansh or deshaantar rekhaon kaa paraspar lambavat hona aavashyak he or kisi bhi ek bindu par maapak samast dishaao main samaan hota he
 But the scale varies from one point to another
 vastav main purna rup se akruti shuddh rakhana sambhav nahin he
 Only in small areas can the shape be almost right
 visheshkar binduon par hi purna roopen akruti shuddh rahati he
 Equilateral interpolation: The directions of the maps marked on the projections are pure
 maanchitr ke centrebindu se chaaron ore kii dishaaen usee prakaar hoti hai, jaise prithvi par
 If this center is a pole, the longitude lines represent pure directions
 yah prakshep navikon ke adhik upyog main aate hai
 Segmentation based on a developable page is considered more authoritative
 iske antargat prakshepon ke nimnlikhit chaar samooh hai : The globe is covered by a cone in such a way that the cone touches the globe at any one latitude
 parantu dhruv evam vishuvat rekha par shanku kaa sparsh karnaa sambhav nahin, kyonki ye visham paristhitiyaan hai
 The shadow of latitude longitude lines is obtained on the conical plane after lighting the globe with a glowing point
 in chhayarekhaon ko sthaayee banaakar shanku ko kisi abhisht deshaantar par kaat diya jaataa he or is prakaar samtal dharaatal par rekhajaal praapt kar liya jaataa he jisamen akshansh rekhaayen chaap rup hoti hai or deshaantar rekhaayen shanku ke sheershabindu par milanevaali saral rekhaayen hoti he
 The latitude at which the cone touches the globe is called "standard latitude"
 shanku ko kisi anya laghu vrutt par bhi sparsh karaayaa ja saktaa he
 But if the top of the cone is not above the pole, the latitude lines will not be in arc form nor the longitude lines will be in arc form
 is jyamittiya vidhi ke atirikt shanku prakshep ajyamitiya dhang se bhi praapt kiye jate hai
 The globe is covered by the cylinder in such a way that the cylinder touches the globe around the equator
 ab kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daalkar rekhajaal prakshipt kiya jaataa he
 Thereafter, the cylinder is cut open at a particular longitude and thus a rectangular graticule is formed on the plane plane
 is vidhi ke antargat globe ke centre kii dhyutimaan bindu maanate hai
 The longitude lines thus obtained are simple lines drawn from north to south whose length is equal to the equatorial line
 in prakshepon main globe ke centre ko yadi dhyutimaan bindu mana jaataa he to akshansh rekhaon ke bich kii duuri dhruvon kii ore ek saath badhati jaati he
 The cylinder can also be touched on any other large circle without touching the equator, but in such a drawn line the latitude and longitude lines will curve
 belanaakaar prekshepon main dhruv kaa pradarshan nahin ho paata, kyonki belan kaa dharaatal dhruv aksh ke samaantar hone ke kaaran dhruv kii chaaya anyatra pad jaati he or belan ke dharaatal par nahin aati
 In these projections, reflection is taken only on the plane plane
 yah dharaatal globe ko kisi ek bindu par sparsh karata he or is avasthaa main kisi dhyutimaan bindu se prakaash daal kar rekhajaal praapt kiya jaataa he
 The following are the different names of the mean projections based on the position of the dashed point: khamadhya prakshepon kii vidhiyon main samtal dharaatal ko yadi ek dhruv par sparsh karata hua rakhte hai to aise prakshep dhruviya khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai, yadi samtal dharaatal vishuvat rekha ke kisi bindu par globe ko sparsh karata he to aise prakshep vishuvatrekhiy khamadhya prakshep kehalaate hai
 In addition, if the plane touches the ground globe at some point between the pole and the equator, then this type of projection is called oblique horizontal projection
 dhyutimaan bindu kii uparyukt sthiti ke aadhaar par bhi prakshepon kaa namakaran hota he jaise cendrak, lambavat evam tiryak prakshep
 It is clear from the above description that cylindrical and oblique interpolations are odd forms of cone interpolation
 shanku yadi bahut lanbaa he ore brihat vrutt ko sparsh kar saktaa he to shanku belan kaa rup dhaaran kar legaa
 In addition, if the cone becomes very flat, it will touch the globe only at one point

 Historically Brahma, his sons Badarayana and grandson Vyasa and others such as Jaimini, Patanjali, Manu, Vatsyayan, Kapil, Kanad etc
 had good knowledge of the Vedas
 vyas rishi ne gita main kai baar vedon kaa zikr kiya he
 In chapter 2, Krishna tells Arjuna that he will find his words easy in lieu of the rhetorical language of the Vedas
 madhyakaal main sayanacharya ko vedon kaa prasiddh bhashyakaar maanate hai - lekin saath hi yah bhi maanate hai ki unhone hi pratham baar vedon ke bhashya yaa anuwaad main devi-devtaa, itihaas or kathaon kaa ullekh kiya jisko aadhaar maanakaar mahidhar or anya bhashyakaron ne aisi vyakhya kii
 Mahidhar and Uvvat were commentators of this category
 aadhunik kaal main raja rammohan raay kaa brahm samaaj or dayanand saraswati kaa arya samaaj lagbhag ek hi samay main vedon ke sabase bade prachaarak bane
 Apart from these, Shankar Pandurang published Atharvaveda in four volumes besides Sayan Bhashya
 lokmaanya tilak ne orin or da arctic home in vedaz naamak do granth vaidic sahitya kii samiksha ke rup main likhe
 Balkrishna Dixit published his knowledge on Samaveda from Calcutta in 1877
 shripad damodar satavlekar ne satara main chaaron vedon kii samhita kaa shrampurvak prakaashan karaayaa
 The publication of Sayan Bhasya of the Rigveda published in five volumes from Tilak Vidyapeeth, Pune is also considered authentic
 vaidic samhitaon ke anuwaad main rameshchandra dutt bengal se, ramgovind trivedi evam jayadev vedalankar ke hindi main evam shridhar pathak kaa marathi main kaary bhi logon ko vedon ke bare main jaankaree pradaan karata rahaa he
 After this, Shriram Sharma Acharya of Gayatri Tapobhoomi has also published the commentaries of the Vedas - his commentaries are scripted
 satrahavin sadi main mogul badshaah aurangzeb ke bhai daara shukoh ne kuch upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad kiya jo pehle francisi or baad main anya bhashaaon main anudit huin
 In Europe, it was followed by Vedic and Sanskrit literature
 maiks mular jaise europea vidwaan ne bhi sanskrit or vaidic sahitya par bahut adhyayan kiya he
 But the attention of the scholars of Europe is focused on making and proving the theory of the Hindu Aryan language family
 shabdon kii samanta ko lekar bane is siddhant main aitihaasik tathy or kaal nirdhaaran ko tod-marod karnaa hi padataa he
 For this reason, the time of creation of Vedas is considered to be 1800-1000 BC which does not meet Sanskrit literature and Hindu principles
 lekin arya jatiyon ke prayaag ke siddhant ke tahat or bhashaagat drushti se yahi kaal in granthon kii rachana kaa maan liya jaataa he
 The incarnation period of the Vedas is considered to be the beginning of the present creation
 iske hisaab se veda ko avatarit hue 2017 ko 1,97,29,49,118 varsh honge
 The Vedas remained as Shruti after the incarnation and much later the Vedas were scripted and Vedangas were invented from the Vedas to preserve or better understand the Vedas
 isamen upasthit khagoleey vivarnanusaar kai itihaaskaar ise 5000, 7000 saal purana maanate hai parantu aatmachintan se gyaat hota he ki jaise saat din biit jane par punah ravivaar aata he vaise hi ye khagoleey ghatnaayen baar baar hotin hai atah inke aadhaar par gananaa shreyaskar nahin
 Some of the real Vedas, which were the repository of knowledge, were destroyed in the Mughal Empire and some during the British
 veda hame brahmad ke anokhe, aalokik va anant raaj bataate he jo samay va samaj se pare he
 The ancient policies and knowledge of the Vedas not only explain this world, but they can also prove to be helpful in running this world again in a smooth manner
 pracheen kaal se bharat main vedon ke adhyayan or vyakhya kii parampara rahi he
 According to the Vedic Sanatan Varnashrama religion, sages and sages, from Brahma to Veda Vyasatatha Jaimini in Ahasuyuga, have considered these as words, evidence and have also built their texts based on them
 parashar, katyayan, yajyavlky, vyas, panini aadi ko pracheen kaal ke vedavetta kehete hai
 There is a tradition of interpreting the Vedas after the knowledge of the four sages
 atah falswaroop ek hi vedaka swarup bhi mantra,brahman, aaranyak, upanishad ke rupmen chaar hi mana gaya he
 Historical Puranas etc
 were composed in the form of lectures of great texts Vedas
 pracheen kaal or madhyayug main shastrarth isi vyakhya or arthantar ke kaaran hue hai
 The main topic - with words like Dev, Agni, Rudra, Vishnu, Marut, Saraswati etc
 vedavetta maharishi swami dayanand saraswati ke vichaar main gyaan, karm, upasna or vigyaan vedon ke vishay hai
 Knowledge of the individual nature of these three eternal entities is available only through Vedas
 kanad ne "tadvachanadamnaysya prananyam" or "buddhipurva vaakyakritirvede" kahkar veda ko darshan or vigyaan kaa bhi strot mana he
 According to Hinduism, Maharishi Manu, the most ancient covenant, said Vedokhilo Dharmamoolam - Veda is the basic basis of religion and theology in the form of Khmerless Vedas i
e
 Sampradaya Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 na keval dharmik kintu aitihaasik drushti se bhi vedon kaa asaadhaaran mahatva he
 The Vedas are the only way to know the culture and civilization of the Aryans of the Vedic era
 maanav-jati or visheshtah vaidiconne apane shishav main dharm or samaaj kaa kis prakaar vikaas kiya iskaa gyaan keval vedon se miltaa he
 They are known as the oldest text in the world
 aryonkaa-bhashaaon kaa mulswaroop nirdhaarit karne main vaidic bhashaa atyadhik sahaayak siddh hui he
 On 7 November 2003, UNESCO declared Ved Text as the masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage of humanity
 pracheen kaal main, bharat main hi, isaki vivechna ke antar ke kaaran kai mat ban gaye the
 There were many debates in the medieval period about its commentary
 vaidic sanathan varnashrami isamen varnit charitron dev ko poojya or murti roopak aradhy samajhate hai jabaki dayanand saraswati sahit anya kaiyon kaa mat he ki inamen varnit charitra ekmaatr ishwar ke hi rup or naam hai
 According to them, the word Devta means - giving things, learned people and Sukta mantras, not idol-worshiping adorable forms
 yadhyapi aaj ke yug main ham sampoorn sansar main ekta-ekaatmata, prem kii bhaavana bana rahe hai tathaapi us kalkhand main jab britain bharat par shashan karata tha, kuch agl anuwadako ke dwaara vedon ke anuwaad se kai myth utpann ho gaye
 It was nothing but a thought-provoking conspiracy
 unka mukhya kaary bharat ko khokhla karnaa or hinduon ko isai bananaa tha
 Those Anglo translators used to say, "aryans are foreigners
 wo bharat aae or unhone yahan rahane vaale logon ko maaraa, taadit kiya tathaa yahan shashan kiya
 The Indians worshiped the penis, and were called dasyu or demons
 " parantu usee kalkhand ke itihaaskaaron ne yah sabit kar diya ki yah keval myth hi he or isamen ratti bhar bhi sachai nahin he or hadappa mohanjo dado ke purvaj bhi arya hi the
 The evidence of Mohenjo-daro being Vedic was known from the currencies obtained in mining, one of which is described below
 "photostat Of Plate No

 387 excavations at mohanjo-daro
"is sil main jo chitra bana he vah rugveda kii ek richa se purnataya mail khaataa he

 kuch deshbhakt jaise bal gangadhar tilak bhi in angrejon kii baton main aa gaye or utpurang dhang se likhane lage
 When asked, he said that whatever he wrote, he wrote it after studying the Vedic translation of the British
 bharat to ab swatantra ho gaya parantu angrejon kaa boyaa yah paudha aaj bhi fal or phool rahaa he
 The Indian government and people are still lying in such stupidity, a proof of this is a version of Muslim India which was printed on 27 March 1985
 bhartiya vidyalayon main yahi bataaya, padhaayaa jaataa rahaa; isise bharat kaa bhavishya gyaat ho jaataa he
 India is infected with this insane ideology even after independence, the direct evidence of this was the low point of Mr
 Frank Anthony, which he put before the Parliament on 4 September 1977
 vaidicon kaa yah sarvasvagranth 'vedatrayee' ke naam se bhi vidit he
 Earlier this Veda Granth was the same name as Yajurveda - Ekavasiidyajurveda Chaturdha: Personally again, the same Yajurveda became famous as rik-yajusva-samas, from which it was called 'trilogy'
 Later it became very difficult to read Veda, so three or four divisions of the same Veda were done
 tab unako rigyajusamke rupame vedatrayee athwa bahut samay baad rigyajusamatharv ke rup main chaturveda kahalaane lage
 Mantras were categorized on the basis of type and meaning
 iskaa aadhaar is prakaar he - The Vedic tradition is of two types - the Brahma tradition and the Aditya tradition
 dono parampara ke vedatrayee parampara pracheen kaal me prasiddh tha
 There are three styles of word usage in the world: poetry, prose and anthem
 vedon ke mantron ke 'padya, gadhy or gaan' aise teen vibhaag hote hai - There are definite rules of letter-number and foot and punctuation in the verse
 atah nishchit akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam vaale veda-mantron kii sangya 'rik' he
 Mantras, which do not have the letter number and foot and punctuation according to the rules of the verse, are called 'yajuh' and all the chants that are lyrical are called 'sama'
 in teen prakaar kii shabd-prakaashan-shaileyon ke aadhaar par hi shaastra evam lok main veda ke liye ‘trayee’ shabd kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Yajurveda is a prose collection, so the verses of the Rigveda in this Yajurveda are recited as prose at the time of reading the Yajurveda
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke purv vedon ke ukt chaar vibhaag alag-alag nahin the
 At that time, Rik, Yajuh and Sama - in these three word-styles, a specific study of the collective word-amount was called Veda
 peeche jaakar veda ke samakaksh me atharv bhi salagn ho gaya, phir 'trayee' ke jagah 'chaturveda' kahalaane lage | guru ke rusht hone par jinhone sabhi vedon ko aditya se praapt kiya he un yajyavlky ne apni smriti me vedatrayee ke baad or puranon ke aage atharv ko sammilit kar bolaa vedanstharvpuranani iti 
 The present-day Vedas are four - but earlier they were the same
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar maane jate hai
 But these four together were considered to be a single 'veda Granth'
 lakshantah trayee hote huye bhi veda ek hi tha, phir usko charbhagame baanta gaya
 Due to the spread of hearing and memorization from generation to generation, the creator Brahmaji also has Shruti, Amnaya due to self-proof, Amauya due to self-attestation, and Apoorusheya, etc
, due to attaining the form of Aaurusheya Vani
 veda ke pathan-pathan ke kram main gurumukh se shravan evam yaad karne kaa veda ke sangrakshan evam safalataa kii drushti se atyant mahatva he
 For this reason Veda is also called "shruti"
 veda parishrampurvak abhyaas dwaara sangrakshniya he, is kaaran iskaa naam ‘'amnaay’' bhi he
 The Maharshiyans have created the Ashta deformity in the defense of Vedas - Jata Mala Shikha Rekha Dhwajo Dando Ratho Ghanah | Ashtau Deformity: Procto permutative Maharsay: || As a result of which, like ancient times, even today, there is chanting in the form of lust, long, stilted and sublime, unspoken vocal
 iske anusaar prayek shakha kii vaidic shabd-raashi kaa vargeekaran- upar varnit prayek veda ke chaar bhaag hote hai
 Apart from the first part of the mantra, the other three parts are not considered as Vedas, but such an idea has not been proved to be logical
 anadi vaidic parampara main mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad ek hi vedake chaar avyav he
 Overall the parts of the Vedas are: - upar ke chaaron khand veda hone par bhi kuch log keval 'samhita' ko hi veda maanate hai
 At the end of Dwaparyug, Shri Krishna Dvapayan Ved Vyasa ji had four divisions of that Veda keeping in view the use of Yagyushthan and taught these four divisions to four disciples
 ye hi chaar vibhaag rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ke naam se prasiddh he
 The four disciples named Pal, Vaishampayan, Jaimini and Sumantu taught the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda respectively
 in chaar shishyon ne shakal aadi apane bhinn-bhinn shishyon ko padhaayaa
 Due to the propagation and preservation of the Vedas by these disciples under their own, they will be greatly expanded through the Vedic texts, Charan, Branch, Pratiksha and Anushaka
 The same preachers are famous by the name of sages
 purvokt chaar shishyone shurume jitne shishyonko anushravan karaayaa ve charansamuh kahalaaye | prayek charansamuhame bahutse shakha hote he
 And in this way Pratishakha, Anushakha etc
 became
 veda kii anek shakhaaen yani vyaakhyaan kaa tarika bataayi gayi hai
 According to the sage Patanjali's Mahabhashya, 21 of the Rigveda, 101 of Yajurveda, 1001 of Samaveda, 9 of Arthaveda have 1131 such branches, but today only 12 branches are available in the original texts
 veda kii prayek shakha kii vaidic shabdarashi chaar bhaagon main uplabdh he: 1
 samhita 2
 brahman 3
 aaranyak 4
 upanishad
 Some people consider the Samhita as Vedas
 shesh teen bhaag ko vedon ke vyakhya granth maanate hai
 In different branches, the original codes remain the same but there is a difference between the Aranyak and Brahmin texts
 kai mantra bhaag main bhi upanishad miltaa he jaisaa ki shuklayajurveda mantrabhagamen isavasyopanishad| puraane samay main jitani shakhaaen thi utani hi mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad hote the |itani shakhaon ke babajud bhi aajkal kul 9 shakhaon ke hi granth milte hai
 In other branches, some mantras, some Brahmins, some Aranyakas and some Upanishads are found
 itane hi nahi adhik shakhaonke to upanishad hi paaya jaataa he ,tabhi to upanishad adhik milte hai
 The Vedic sages found the Vedas to be popular in public welfare
 nihsandeh jaisaa ki -:yathema vaachan kalyanimavadani janebhyah vaisaa hi veda hi yagnarthambhipravrita kalanupoorvyabhihitashch yagyah tasmadidan kalvidhanshastran yo jyotishan veda sa veda yagyam vedon kii pravritih janakalyan ke kaary me he
 The word Veda is formed by applying the suffix h to vid dhatu
 sanskrit grathon main vid gyane or vid laabhe jaise visheshnon se vid dhaatu se gyaan or laabh ke arth kaa bodh hota he
 The subjects of Vedas depend on their interpretation - topics like Agni, Yajna, Surya, Indra, Soma, Brahma, mana-atma, Jagatna, the qualities of substances, religion, couplets, meditation-yoga, Pran recurrently
 yajna main devtaa, dravya, uddeshy,or vidhi aadi viniyukt hote hai
 According to the texts, their description is as follows - rugveda ko chaaron vedon main sabase pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is divided in two ways
 pratham prakaar main ise 10 mandalon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Circles contain some hymns in Suktas, Suktas
 kul richaayen 10520 hai
 The Rigveda has 64 chapters in another way
 aath-aath adhyyon ko milakar ek ashtak banaaya gaya he
 There are eight such octaves in total
 phir prayek adhyay ko virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The number of classes is different in different chapters
 kul varg sankhya 2024 he
 Each class has some mantras
 sristi ke anek rahasyon kaa inamen udghaatan kiya gaya he
 Earlier it had 21 branches, but at present its branch branch is being promoted
 isamen gadhy or padya donon hi hai
 Yajna is the priority of karma
 pracheen kaal main isaki 101 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main keval paanch shakhaaen hai - kathak, kapishthal, maitrayani, taittiriya, vaajasaneyi
 This Veda has two distinctions - Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda
 krishna yajurveda kaa sankalan maharishi veda vyas ne kiya he
 Its other name is also Taittiriya Samhita
 isamen mantra or brahman bhaag mishrit hai
 Shukla Yajurveda - It was given by Surya as a sermon to Yajnavalkya
 isamen 15 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main madhyandin ko jise vaajasaneyi bhi kehete hai praapt hai
 It has 40 chapters, 303 anuvakas and 1975 mantras
 antim chalisvaan adhyay eshavasyopanishad he
 This is the lyrical book
 isamen gaan vidya kaa bhandar he, yah bhartiya sangeet kaa mul he
 The singing of the hymns is called Sama
 isaki 1001 shakhaaen thim
 But nowadays only three are prevalent - Kothumiya, Jaiminiya and Ranayaniya
 isko purvarchik or uttararchik main baanta gaya he
 There are four scandals in the predecessor - igneous scandal, andra scandal, Powman scandal and Aranya scandal
 chaaron kandon main kul 640 mantra hai
 Then there are 10 mantras of Mahanamanyarchik
 is prakaar purvarchik main kul 650 mantra hai
 There are six readers
 uttararchik ko 21 adhyyon main baanta gaya
 There are nine readers
 isamen kul 1225 mantra hai
 Thus the Samaveda has a total of 1875 mantras
 isamen adhiktar mantra rugveda se liye gaye hai
 It can also be called the originator of worship
 isamen ganit, vigyaan, ayurveda, samaaj shaastra, krishi vigyaan, aadi anek vishay varnit hai
 Some people also find mantra-tantra in it
 yah veda jahaan brahm gyaan kaa upadesh karata he, vahiin moksh kaa upaay bhi bataata he
 It is also called Brahma Veda
 isamen mukhya rup main atharvan or angiras rishiyon ke mantra hone ke kaaran atharv angiras bhi kehete hai
 It is divided into 20 kandas
 prayek kand main kai-kai sutara hai or sutron main mantra hai
 There are a total of 5977 mantras in this Veda
 isaki aajkal do shakhaaen shounik evam pippalad hi uplabdh hai
 The scholar of the Atharvaveda is the author of the four Vedas
 yajna main rugveda kaa hota devon kaa aahnan karata he, samaveda kaa udgaata samgaan karata he, yajurveda kaa adhvaryu dev:kotikarm kaa vitan karata he tathaa atharvaveda kaa brahm puure yajna karm par niyantran rakhata he
 Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva Veda and Sthapatya Veda - These have been told by the Upveda Katyayana of the four Vedas respectively
 vedon ke sarvangin anushilan ke liye shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand or jyotish ke granth hai jinhen 6 ang kehete hai
 Pratipadasutra, Anupada, Chandobhasha, Dharmashastra, Justice and Vaiseshika - These 6 views are also available
 upangon ke vishay is prakaar hai - In the Veda samhita, there are signs of chanting their high, medium, or slow musical vowels by placing standing and horizontal lines in the mantras
 inako udaatt, anudaatt fir swaarit ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 These vowels have been in vogue since ancient times and Mahamuni Patanjali has included his main cardinal rules in his great language
 swaron ko adhik yaa nune rup se bole jane ke kaaran inke bhi do-do bhed ho jate hai
 Such as udatta-udattar, anuadatta-anudattar, swarika-swarittodatta
 inke alaave ek or swar mana gaya he - shruti - isamen teenon swaron kaa milan ho jaataa he
 Thus the total number of vowels becomes 7
 in saat swaron main bhi aapas main milane se swaron main bhed ho jaataa he jiske liye swar chihnon main kuch parivartan ho jaataa he
 Although many methods are used in the marking and typing of these vowels and there is not a single mode common in publisher-commentators, in most places a horizontal line below the letter for the approved and a vertical line above the letter for the vocal
 Is the rule
 udaatt kaa apana koi chihn nahin he
 Due to this problem in marking, many writer-publishers do not use vowel signs at all
 vaidic mantron main prayukt chand kai prakaar ke hai jinamein mukhya hai- According to this, the ritual of Vedokta Yajna is considered to be the main use of the words of Veda
 sristi ke armbh se hi yajna karne main saadharantaya mantroccharan kii style, mantrakshar evam karm-vidhi main vividhta rahi he
 It is due to this diversity that the branches of the Vedas have expanded
 yatha-rugveda kii 21 shakha, yajurveda kii 101 shakha, samaveda kii 1000 shakha or atharvaveda kii 9 shakha- is prakaar kul 1,131 shakhaayen hai
 This number is also mentioned by Maharishi Patanjali in his great language
 uparyukt 1,131 shakhaon main se vartmaan main keval 12 shakhaayen hi mul granthon main uplabdh haih- Out of the above 12 branches, only 6 branches have the learning style - Shakal, Taittariya, Madhyandini, Karma, Kauthum and Shaunak Shakha
 yah kahana bhi anupyukt nahin hoga ki anya shakhaon ke kuch or bhi granth uplabdh hai, kintu unase shakha kaa puraa parichay nahin mil saktaa evam bahut-si shakhaon ke to naam bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 As mentioned above, understanding of many words of Vedas has not been as simple
 vedunkaa vaastavik arth samajhane ke liye inke bhitarase hi vedangunka avishkaar kiya gaya | isaki vajah inamen varnit arthon ko janaa nahi ja saktaa | sabase adhik vivaad-vaarta ishwar ke swaroop, yani ekmaatr yaa anek devon ke sadrishy ko lekar hua he
 The real meaning of Vedoun can be done only by those who know the education - Kalpa, Grammar, Nirukta, Chanda and Astrology
 europe ke sanskrit vidwaanon kii vyakhya bhi hind-arya jati ke siddhant se prerit rahi he
 In the ancient times itself, many such opinions appeared, challenging their power, which are still called religious views but are different in many ways
 inkaa mukhya antar neeche spasht kiya gaya he
 Among them, who are guided by the Vedas, shakhas, and Kalpasutra, who believe in a unique universe, believe in the Vedas by not engaging in any one god, they believe in the Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama religion, they consider Vedon as Sarvopari
 iske alaava alag alag vichaar rakhanevaale or pruthak pruthak devtaa maanane vaale kuch sampradaay ye hai-: The topics which have been disputed are given below
 yajna:yajna ke vartmaan rup ke mahatv ko lekar kai vidwaanon, maton or bhashkaron main virodhabhash he
 The use of fire in the yajna has been so much similar to the ancient Parsi worship method and scholars have been interested in the great importance of havan
 devtaa:dev shabd kaa lekar hi kai vidwaanon main asahmati rahi he
 The Vedokta Nirguna - formless and saguna - in many faiths who believe in the last aspect of the form, consider it to be a great person with special powers as a great man and worship them in idol, while many others call them the names of God
 paroapkaar karne vaali vastuen, vidwaan log or maargdarshan karne vaale mantron ko dev kaha gaya he
 For example, by not understanding the meaning of the word fire, first of all, that is to say, God
 devtaa shavd kaa arth divya, yani parameshwar kii shakti se purna mana jaataa he - jaise prithvi aadi
 Mahadev, in this view, calls God because he is the Lord of the Gods
 isi tarah sarvatra vyapak ishwar vishnu or satya hone ke kaaran brahma kehalaata he
 In this way, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev are not names of any character but names of God
 vyakaran or niruktake valpar hi vaidic or loukik shabdonke arth nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of this, they sit in the waste of meaning
 isi praakar ganesh, prajapati, devi, buddha, lakshmi ityadi parameshwar ke hi naam hai
 The Vedadi scriptures belong to the same God
 jaisaa kii upanishadonme kaha gaya he- eko dev sarvbhooteshu guiah sarvyaapee sarvabhootantaraatma | kuch log ishwarke sagun- nirgun swarupame jhagadte rahete he
 Some of them do idolatry and there are people who are against idolatry and consider God as the only truth, paramount
 ashwamedh:ashwamedh se hinsa or bali kaa vichaar aata he
 This is surprising to many Hindus as purists have been avoiding violence in many places
 kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki medh shabd main adhwaran kaa bhi prayog hua he jiskaa arth he ahimsa
 Therefore, there must have been some other meaning of merit
 isi prakaar ashv shabd kaa arth ghoda na rahakar shakti rahaa hoga
 According to Shri Ram Sharma Acharya languages, the word Ashwa means power, the word Gau means nutrition
 isse ashwamedh kaa arth ghode kaa bali se itar hoti prathit hoti he
 Som: Some people consider it to be wine, but according to many translations it was made by code-grinding
 atah ye sharaab jaisaa koi peya nahin lagata
 But its true form has not been determined
 bharat ke pashchimi tat par sthit mumbai, bhartiya rajya maharashtra kii rajdhani he
 It has an estimated population of 3
29 million, which is the first most populous city in the country
 iskaa gathan lava nirmit saat chote-chote dwipon dwaara hua he evam yah pul dwaara pramukh bhu-khand ke saath judaa hua he
 The Mumbai Port is the best maritime port in India
 mumbai kaa tat kataa-fata he jiske kaaran iskaa potashray prakritik evam surakshit he
 Ship passengers and tourists arriving by waterways or airways from western countries such as Europe, America, Africa etc
 first come to Mumbai, hence Mumbai is called the gateway of India
 mumbai bharat kaa sarvavrihattam vanijyik kendra he
 Which accounts for 5% of India's GDP
 yah sampoorn bharat ke audyogic utpaada kaa 25%, nauvahan vyapaar kaa 40%, evam bhartiya arth vyavastha ke puunji lenden kaa 70% bhagidaar he
 Mumbai is one of the top ten commercial centers in the world
 bharat ke adhikansh bank evam saudagari karyaalayon ke pramukh karyaalay evam kai mahatvapurn aarthik santhaan jaise bhartiya reserve bank, bombay stock exange, neshnal staock exange evam anek bhartiya companiyon ke nigamit mukhyalay tathaa bahurashtriya companiyaan mumbai main avasthit hai
 Hence it is also called the economic capital of India
 nagar main bharat kaa hindi chalchitr evam doordarshan udyog bhi he, jo bollywood naam se prasiddh he
 Mun attracts business Apॊrtyuniti, and high living standards of people across India in Mumbai, which is why the city has become a mixture of different societies and cultures
 mumbai pattan bharat ke lagbhag aadhe samudri maal kii awajahi karata he
 The name "mumbai" is made up of two words, Mumba or maha-amba - a form of the Hindu goddess Durga, whose name is Mumba Devi - and I, "mother", is called in Marathi
 purv naam baanmbe yaa bombay kaa udgam solahavin shatabdi se aayaa he, jab portugali log yahaan pehle-pahal aaye, va ise kai naamon se pukaara, jisane antatah bombai kaa rup likhit main liya
 This name is still in Portuguese usage
 satrahavin shatabdi main, british logon ne yahaan adhikaar karne ke baad, iske purv naam kaa anglikaran kiya, jo bombai bana
 But Marathi people called it Mumbai or Mumbai and Hindi and people called it Bombay
 iskaa naam aadhikarik rup se san 1995 main mumbai bana
 The name Bombay derives originally from the Portuguese name, meaning "good bay", based on the fact that bom in Portuguese means good, and the English word bay is the nearest Portuguese word baia
 saamaanya portugali main good be kaa rup he: boa bahia, jo ki galat shabd bom bahia kaa shuddh rup he
 Yes, in the Portuguese language of the sixteenth century Bam is the word for small bay
 anya sutron kaa portugali shabd bombam ke liye, bhinn mul he
 José Pedro Machado's Dicionário Onomástico Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa explains, what is the first Portuguese reference to this place from 1516, Benamjambu or ten-miambu, Miambu or "MAIAMBU" seems to derive from 'mumba Devi'
 ye vahi mumba devi hai, jinke naam par mumbai naam marathi log lete hai
 In the same century, the spelling of Mombaien changed and became Mombaiam, and finally in the sixteenth century Bombaiam emerged, as Gaspar Correia wrote in Lendas the India
 kandiwali ke nikat uttari mumbai main mili pracheen avshesh sanket karte hai, ki yah dweep samooh pashaan yug se basaa hua he
 Written evidence of the human population dates back to 250 BC, when it was called haptanesia
 teesri shatabdi i
pus

 aise proprietary software kaa pehle bhi astitv tha ,or yah saafe hota ja rahaa tha kii bhavisya main sab software proprietary software hi hoga
 According to Stolman's MIT friend Brewster Kahle, the change in the software's legal character was due to the US Copyright Act of 1976
 jab bryan red ne scrib markup language or verde processing system main analisensod acces niyantrit karne ke liye software time bombs lagaaye tab stollman ne ise " insaaniyat ke khilaaf aparaadh " kaa darja diya

 Klyshe or Ghisa-pita or pishtokti is an element of a sentence, thought, or art that has lost its original meaning due to too much usage
 aksar yah aisi chijen hoti hai jo armbh main bahut arthpurna, naveen yaa najuk samajhi jaati hon
 For example, a lover saying to his girlfriend "I will break the stars for you" once had a lot of meaning but now it has become meaningless as a cliche
 isi tarah bhartiya raajnneeti main "hamaara uddeshy garibon kii madad karnaa he" ek ghisa-pita naaraa ban chukaa he
 The use of such elements in art is considered a sign of being novice or middle-level
 yah zaruri nahin he ke clishe kaa prayog hameshaa jhunth yaa dhoortta dikhalaataa he - yah sachai or imaanadaaree se bhi prayog ho saktaa he

 dhyaan rahe ke vyakaran ke nazariye se "ghisa-pita" ek visheshan he or sangya kabhi nahin hota 
 Conversely "cliche" can also be an adjective and a noun
 "yah vaakya ek clishe he" sahi prayog he
 "this sentence is a cliche sentence" is also correct

 jis samay bharat main bhagwaan mahavir or buddha dharm ke sambadh main nae vichaar rakh rahen the, china main bhi ek sudhaarak kaa janm hua, jiskaa naam kanceyushious tha
 At that time, the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou Dynasty was going on in China
 samay ke saath jhou rajvansh kii shakti shithil padane ke kaaran china main bahut se rajya kaayam ho gayi, jo sadaa aapas main ladate rahete the, jise jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal kaha jane laga
 Therefore, the people of China were suffering a lot
 aise samay main china vaasiyon ko naitikta kaa paath padhaane hetu mahatma kanceyucious kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He was born in Shandong region of China, about 550 years before the birth of Jesus Christ
 bachapan main hi unke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 The aspiration for his knowledge was limitless
 bahut adhik ksht karke unhen gyaan arjan karnaa padaa tha
 At the age of 17, he got a government job
 kuch hi varshon ke baad sarkari naukari chhodkar ve shikshan kaary main lag gayi
 He started giving education to students by opening a school at home
 ve maukhik rup se vidhyaarthiyon ko itihaas, kavy or nitishastra kii shiksha dete the
 He wrote several books on poetry, history, music and ethics
 53 varsh kii umr main lu rajya main ek shahar ke ve shashankarta tathaa baad main ve mantri pad par niyukt hue
 As a minister, he emphasized on the improvement of human character in lieu of punishment
 kanceyucious ne apane shishyon ko satya, prem or nyaay kaa sandesh diya
 He used to put more emphasis on virtue
 ve logon ko vinayi, paropkaaree, guni or charitravaan banane kii prerana dete the
 ve bado env purvajon ko aadar-sammaan karne ke liye kehete the
 ve kehete the ki dusron ke saath vaisaa vartav na karo jaisaa tum swany apane saath nahin karnaa chaahate ho
 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher
 unhone ishwar ke bare main koi upadesh nahin diya, parantu phir bhi baad main log unhen dharmik guru maanane lage
 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him
 kintu uske pautra tje sje dwaara likhit 'ausat kaa siddhant' or uske shishy tsong sin dwaara likhit 'mahan shiksha' naamak pustakon main tatsambandhi samast suchnaayen praapt hoti hai
 a treatise called 'spring and Autumn', also known as the chronicle of Lu, is said to be written by Confucius
 yah samoochee kriti praapt he or yadhyapi bahut choti he tathaapi china ke sankshipt itihaason ke liye adarsh maani jaati he
 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
