 america or europe ke baad japani companiyaan bhi bhartiya ejiniyaron ko apni ore aakarshith kar rahi hai
 There is a huge shortage of engineers in Japan, so Japan has given excellent opportunities to engineers from countries like India and Vietnam to accomplish this
 japan kii digital technolaji ke liye use baari sankhya main ejiniyaron kii aavashyaktaa he yah achraj kii baat he ki japan main takneekee vishyon kii pratibhaaon main acchhee khaasi kami ai he
 Experts believe that the reason for this is to like extreme comfort in Japan and to avoid the clutches of secret subjects, so students here have been found to be away from science

 For this reason, the penetration of talent in this field is not visible, it is not seen even in All India Services

 In the coming times, there will be demand for only talent in the world and other aspects of it will be ignored
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj puri duniya kii najar bharat kii taraf he
 Disruptive activities in some troubled areas of India and demands like reservation also have no adverse effect on the expansion of information technology

 By the time of Nietzsche's death, his compositions had gained fame

 Protestant backgrounds and early introduction to ancient Greek literature gave him anti-rites of these thought traditions, but Kant's epistemology, Schopenhauer's contemplation, Romanticism pervaded in German literature and art, comparative ethics and self-developmentalism served as a philosophical ground for him

 According to Nietzsche, these rules are also not universal, they themselves are restricted by our interests, values and resolutions

 Spontaneous living and voluntarily adopted discipline for him is the criterion of Nietzsche's ideal man
 vyakti ko roodhiyon kaa nahin shreshth purushon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 "" God has died "" is the famous statement of Nietzsche, but by this utterance he intends to direct the end of eternalism in values and the prevailing infidelity in the human mind

 Focus position of adjustment of the object or an optical device required in the same to produce a clear image:
 In focus, out of focus, the aperture adjustment of the measured lens opening, as the F-number controls the amount of light passing through the lens

 The focal length divided by the f-number gives the effective aperture diameter

 ISO speeds are used on traditional film cameras to "tell the camera" the speed of the selected film film, ISO speeds are employed on modern digital cameras and an automatic exposure as an indication of the system's benefits from light to numerical output To control the system
 The film with a lower ISO number is more sensitive to light, while the higher the ISO number the greater the film sensitivity to light

 par kai logon kaa maananaa he ki yah galat he evam asamprdayik desh main ek dharm ke liye kiya gaya pakshpaat he

 Mansarovar lake is in Tibet
 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 Maulana Mahmood Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the Air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Ministry of Minority Affairs formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme - in operation since 1993 — was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely

com> In mathematics, the highest and lowest value of a function is called the highest and lowest of that function
 ucchisht or nimnisht ko sammilit rup se charam kehete hai
 They can be in a limited area of high and low function or in the entire domain of that function
 falan ke kisi simit kshetra main sthit ucchisht or nimnisht ko 'sthaneey charam' kehete hai jabaki falan ke sampoorn domen main falan kaa jo sabase adhik / kam maan ho use 'global charam' kehete hai
 Low and local peak values are shown in the side diagram
 isse adhik vyapak rup se kahen to, kisi samucchy kaa ucchisht or nimnisht, us samucchy ke sadasyon main sabase adhik or sabase kam maan vaale sadsy hote hai
 The objective of optimization is to extract the peak values of the functions
 ham nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karte hai First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki donon binduon par dwitiya avkalaj dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Take the following function iskaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai: The second derivative of the function is: pratham avkalaj ko shunya rakhane par x kaa maan nimnlikhit miltaa he- x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {1} = { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 5 } The value of the second derivative of the function is negative, so x = x_1 has this function specified
 isi prakaar ham dekhte hai ki x 2 = − 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{2}=-{ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan dhanatmak he, atah x_2 par falan kaa nimnisht he
 Consider the following function whose graph is given below- sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if it is positive or negative
 atah ham nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki is falan kaa koi na ucchisht he na koi nimnisht
