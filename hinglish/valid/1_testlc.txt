 Many types of it have evolved over time
 kintu iskaa pracheenatam rup ek-tantri veena he
 Some people say that in the medieval era, Amir Khusro Dahlavi composed the sitar combining Veena and Banjo, some even describe it as a form of guitar

 The thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses isotopic Th-232 of thorium as a fertilizer
 riector main Th-232 badalakar uranium-233 ban jaataa he jo nabhikeey eendhan he
 Thorium is similar to wet wood
 jis prakaar bhigi lakdi ko jalaane ke liye pehle bhatti main sukhaana padataa he usee tarah thorium ko vikhandaneey urenium main badalanaa padataa he 
 " In the thorium cycle, fuel is formed when saanchaa:simplenuclide2 captures a neutron to become saanchaa:simplenuclide2
 This normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino by β− decay to become saanchaa:simplenuclide2
 This then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second β− decay to become saanchaa:simplenuclide2, the fuel: Nuclear fission produces radioactive fission products which can have half-lives from days to greater than 200,000 years
 According to some toxicity studies, the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes, and after a few hundred years, the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the uranium ore that would have been used to produce low enriched uranium fuel for a light water reactor of the same power
 Other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods
 In a reactor, when a neutron hits a fissile atom, it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom
 In the case of saanchaa:simplenuclide2, the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than transuranic wastes
 When saanchaa:simplenuclide2 absorbs a neutron, it either fissions or becomes saanchaa:simplenuclide2
 The chance of fissioning on absorption of a thermal neutron is about 92%; the capture-to-fission ratio of saanchaa:simplenuclide2, therefore, is about 1:12 — which is better than the corresponding capture vs
 fission ratios of saanchaa:simplenuclide2, or saanchaa:simplenuclide2 or saanchaa:simplenuclide2 
the result is less transuranic waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle
saanchaa:thorium Cycle transmutationsazca:simplenuclide2, like most actinides with an even number of neutrons, is not fissile, but neutron capture produces fissile saanchaa:simplenuclide2
 If the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture, it produces saanchaa:simplenuclide2, saanchaa:simplenuclide2, saanchaa:simplenuclide2, and eventually fissile saanchaa:simplenuclide2 and heavier isotopes of plutonium
the saanchaa:simplenuclide2 can be removed and stored as waste or retained and transmuted to plutonium, where more of it fissions, while the remainder becomes saanchaa:simplenuclide2, then americium and curium, which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission
 However, the template: simplenuclide2 formed via reactions with mold: simplenuclide2, while not a transuranic waste, is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel
 Uranium-232 is also formed in this process, via reactions between fast neutrons and saanchaa:simplenuclide2, saanchaa:simplenuclide2, and saanchaa:simplenuclide2: Uranium-232 has a relatively short half-life, and some decay products emit high energy gamma radiation, such as mold: simplenuclide2, mold: simplenuclide2 and particularly mold: simplenuclide2
 The full decay chain, along with half-lives and relevant gamma energies, is: saanchaa:simplenuclide2 decays to saanchaa:simplenuclide2 where it joins the ] Thorium-cycle fuels produce hard gamma emissions, which damage electronics, limiting their use in military bomb triggers
 Template: simplenuclide2 cannot be chemically separated from the template: simplenuclide2 from used nuclear fuel; However, chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product mold: simplenuclide2 and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain, which gradually builds up as mold: simplenuclide2 reaccumulates
 The hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing

 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another
 vyakti kii saamaajik maryaada bahut kuch parivaar se hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal

 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage

 Families have different forms and types based on different forms of marriage, lineage, ownership and authority
 matrusthaneey parivaar main pati apni patni ke ghar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy banataa he, jabaki pitristhaneey parivaar main patni pati ke ghar jaakar rahati he
 Maternal families are generally matriarchal and patrilineal families are patrilineal

 isi prakaar bharat main khaasi, gaaro or america main hopi, hedia jaisi janajatiyaan bhi hai jo matrusthaneey or matruvansheey hai
 In these forms of marriage there is a difference in the composition and form of the family

 In general, women keep this fast for the want of a son and for the skill of the son
 purush bhi puri nishtha se apane manovanchit kaary ko safal hone ke liye vrath rakhte hai
 Chhath festival is basically a festival of worship of the sun, which has a special place in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke devataaon main surya aise devtaa hai jinhen moort rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 The main sources of Sun's powers are his wife Usha and Pratyusha
 chhath main surya ke saath-saath donon shaktiyon kii sanyukt aradhana hoti he
 In the morning, both the first rays of the sun and the last rays of the sun in the evening are paid by offering arghya
 bharat main suryopasna rug vaidic kaal se hoti aa rahi he
 The Sun and its worship are discussed in detail in Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana etc
 madhya kaal tak chhath suryopasna ke vyavasthit parv ke rup main pratishthit ho gaya, jo abhi tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 Due to the creation and rearing power, the worship of the sun started in different form at different places with the development of civilization, but the worship of the sun as a deity is first mentioned in the Rigveda
 iske baad anya sabhi vedon ke saath hi upanishad aadi vaidic granthon main isaki charchaa pramukhataa se hui he
 Yasak, the creator of Nirukta, has placed the Sun in the first place among the local gods
 uttar vaidic kaal ke antim kalkhand main surya ke maanviya rup kii kalpana hone lagi
 It later took the form of idol worship of the sun
 puranic kaal aate-aate surya puja kaa prachlan or adhik ho gaya
 Temples of Suryadev were also built in many places
 puranic kaal main surya ko aarogy devtaa bhi mana jane laga tha
 The rays of the sun were found to have the ability to destroy many diseases
 rishi-muniyon ne apane anusandhan ke kram main kisi khaas din iskaa prabhaav vishesh paaya
 Probably this is the birth of Chhath festival
 bhagwaan krishna ke pautra shamb ko kusht rog ho gaya tha
 Special Suryopasana was done to get rid of this disease, for which Brahmins were called from Shakya Island
 chhath puja kii parampara or uske mahatva kaa pratipaadan karne vaali anek puranic or lok kathaayen prachlit hai
 According to a belief, Lord Rama and Mother Sita fasted and worshiped Suryadev on Kartik Shukla Shashthi on the day of the establishment of Ram Rajya after the Lanka victory
 saptami ko suryoday ke samay punah anushthan kar suryadev se aashirwad praapt kiya tha
 According to another belief, Chhath festival started in the Mahabharata period
 sabase pehle suryaputra karn ne suryadev kii puja shuru kii
 Karna was the supreme devotee of Lord Surya
 vah pratidin ghanton qamar tak pani main khade hokar suryadev ko arghya dete the
 He became a great warrior by the grace of Suryadev
 aaj bhi chhath main arghya daan kii yahi paddati prachlit he
 Some stories also mention the worship of the Sun by Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas
 ve apane parijanon ke uttam swasthya kii kaamana or lambi umr ke liye niyamit surya puja karti thim
 According to a legend, King Priyavad had no children, then Maharishi Kashyapa made a son's sacrifice and offered his wife Malini a pudding made for Yagyahuti
 iske prabhaav se unhen putr hua parantu vah mrit paidaa hua
 Priyavad went to the crematorium with a son and his son started dying in isolation
 usee vakt brahmaji kii maanas kanya devsena prakat hui or kaha ki sristi kii mul pravriti ke chathe ansh se utpann hone ke kaaran main shashthee kehalaati hoon
 Hey! Rajan, you should worship me and inspire people to worship as well
 raja ne putr ichha se devi shashthee kaa vrath kiya or unhen putr ratna kii prapti hui
 This puja was performed on Kartik Shukla Shashthi
 chhath puja kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh isaki saadagi pavitrataa or lokpaksh he
 This festival, full of devotion and spirituality, spreads the sweetness of folk life, consisting of bamboo-made soup, baskets, earthen pots, sugarcane juice, prasad made from jaggery, rice and wheat and sweet folk songs
 shastron se alag yah jan saamaanya dwaara apane reeti-rivaajon ke rangon main gadhi gayi upasna paddati he
 At its center is the peasant and rural life rather than scriptures like Vedas, Puranas
 is vrath ke liye na vishesh dhan kii aavashyaktaa he na purohit yaa guru ke abhyarthna kii
 If needed, it is the support of the neighborhood which is presented with pleasure and gratitude for its service
 is utsav ke liye janata swayan apane samuhik abhiyaan sangathit karti he
 The society does not look for the help of the government for the cleanliness of the cities, the management of the passing paths of the vratas, the proper arrangement of arghya donations on the banks of the pond or river
 is utsav main kharnaa ke utsav se lekar ardhyadaan tak samaaj kii anivaary upasthiti bani rahati he
 It is a monumental and grand performance of the collective work done by the common and poor people, forgetting the difficulties of their daily life, with service and devotion
 lokparv chhath ke vibhinn avasaron par jaise prasad banaate samay, kharnaa ke samay, arghya dene ke liye jate hue, arghya daan ke samay or ghat se ghar lautate samay anekon sumdhur or bhakthi-bhav se purna loakgeet gaaye jate hai
 This song mentions a parrot that is hovering near one such banana bunch
 tote ko daraaya jaataa he ki agar tum is par chonch maaroge to tumhaari shikaayat bhagwaan surya se kar di jaaegi jo tumhen nahin maaf karenge, par phir bhi tota kele ko jutha kar detaa he or surya ke coup kaa bhaagi banataa he
 But what should her Indian Sugani do now, poor thing? How to bear this disconnection? Now Suryadev cannot help him, he has destroyed the sanctity of worship

 Until now, the Brahmi script was believed to have been developed by the Mauryans in the fourth to third centuries BCE, but recent excavations from the Archaeological Survey of India have shown that it existed in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka since the 6th century BCE

 Blast furnaces are considered to be different from bloomery in that the purpose of a blast furnace is to produce molten metal that can be extracted from the furnace through the tap, while the purpose of blumery is to keep it from melting so that the carbon does not dissolve in the iron
 Go Blumery also artificially blows air using a blower, but the term "blast furnace" is generally reserved for furnaces where iron is refined from the ore

 Although the fifth century BC Till date, cast iron and agricultural implements were used in China to a large extent while in the third century BC

 Although for a long time it was believed that the Chinese had developed the blast furnace and made cast iron as their first method of manufacturing iron, but Donald Wagner had just recently neutralized some statements of early work
 Has published a letter to; In the new letter also, the time of the first ironworks were cast in the fourth and fifth century BC
 But it also provides evidence of the use of early bloomery furnaces that came from the West in the early Chinese Bronze Age of later Longshan culture

 Although its timeline is not yet clear, it may not have existed until the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in the late 1530s, as Bloom referred to in an agreement with the Earl of Rutland in 1541 concerning the "smyths"
 phir bhi jin madhyamon se madhyayugin europe main blast fernes kaa prasar hua tha un madhyamon ko abhi tak nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The direct ancestors of these furnaces used in France and England were in the Namur region which is now Wallonia
 vahaan se unka prasar sabase pehle normandi kii purvi seemaa par pes di bre main hua or vahaan se sasex ke vield main hua jahaan baxted kii sabase pehali bhatti kaa nirmaan lagbhag 1491 main hua tha jiske baad 1496 main ashdown forest ke neubrij main ek or bhatti kaa nirmaan hua tha
 By 1530 they were small in number but over the following decades several furnaces were built in the Weald where the iron industry reached its peak by about 1590
 in bhattiyon se zyaadaatar dhalava lohe ko lohe kii pattee ke nirmaan ke liye finary forj main le jaaya jaataa tha
 The first British furnaces outside the Weald began to appear in the 1550s and many more furnaces were built over the remainder of that century and the following decades
 udyog kaa utpaadan shaayad 1620 main apni charam seemaa par pahunch gaya or uske baad atharahavin sadi ke armbh tak isamen thodi si giravat dekhi gai
 The obvious reason for this was that it was cheaper to procure iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to manufacture iron in some of the more remote British places
 udyog ke liye kam laagat par uplabdh charcol kii khapat shaayad utani hi teji se ho rahi thi jitani teji se ped badhate the
 The Backbarrow Blast Furnace, built in Cumbria in 1711, is described as the first efficient example

 In 1709 Abraham Darby in Colebrookdale, Shropshire, England began using coke instead of charcoal as fuel in the blast furnace
 coke lohe kaa istemaal shuru main dhalaai ke kaam ke liye, bartan banane or dhalava lohe ke anya saamaanon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Casting work was a minor branch of the industry but Darby's son built a new furnace in nearby Horshey and began supplying coke pig iron to the owners of the Finery Forge to manufacture bar iron
 is samay tak coke pig lohe kaa nirmaan karnaa charcol pig lohe kii tulana main adhik sasta tha
 The use of coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a major factor in the British Industrial Revolution

 Competition of the industry results in excessive production
 sabase badi blast bhattiyon kaa aaytan lagbhag 5580 ghan me hota he or louh utpaadan kshamta lagbhag 88,000 ton prati saptaah hoti he
 This is a major increase in eighteenth-century typical furnaces with an average iron production capacity of about 360 tons per year
 blast bhattiyon ke bhinn roopon jaise swedish electric blast fernes, ko un deshon main viksit kiya gaya he jahaan koi swadeshi koyala sansaadhan nahin he
 Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of auxiliary facilities such as ore storage yard where the barges are evacuated to increase efficiency
 kachche maal ko ayask pulon yaa rail hoparon or ayask sthanantaran kaaron kii sahaayta se stochouse complex main sthanantarit kiya jaataa he
 Rail-mounted scale cars or computer-controlled wet hoppers measure various raw materials to produce the desired hot metal and sintered chemical
 kachche maal ko ghiraniyon yaa vaahak belton dwaara chaalit ek skip car ke madhyam se blast fernes ke upar le jaaya jaataa he
 a variety of methods are used to charge raw materials in blast furnaces
 kuch blast ferneson main ek "dabl bel" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jahaan blast fernes main kachche maal ke pravesh ko niyantrit karne ke liye do "belon" kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of these two bales is to reduce the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace
 sabase pehle kachche maal ko upree yaa choti ghanti main khaali kiya jaataa he
 The bell is then rotated to a predetermined magnitude to more accurately distribute the charge
 uske baad bade bel main charge ko khaali karne ke liye choti bel ko kholaa jaataa he
 The smaller bell is then closed to close the blast furnace while the larger bell distributes the charge to the blast furnace
 ek adhik haal kii dizin main "bel rahit" pranali kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In these systems multiple hoppers are used for each raw material which is then released through the valve into the blast furnace
 milaae jane vaale prayek ghatak ke pariman ko niyantrit karne main skip yaa vaahak system kii tulana main ye valve adhik sahi sabit hote hai jisase fernes kii kaarykushalta bad jaati he
 In some of these bellless systems, shoots are also used to precisely control the location of the charge
 loha banane vaali blast bhatti khud durdamy eenton vaali ek lambii chimney jaisi sanrachana ke rup main bani hoti he
 Coke, limestone flux and iron ore are charged in the upper part of the furnace in a precise fill order which helps to control the gas flow and chemical reaction within the furnace

 The "casthouse" of the lower half of the furnace consists of basal pipe, ture and casting equipment of liquid iron and sintered
 "nalchhidr" ko durdamy mitti ke plag ke madhyam se kholane ke baad lohe or dhaatumal ko alag karne vaali ek "skimar" opening ke madhyam se ek naand main taral loha or dhaatumal nikalne lagata he
 Modern and large blast furnaces may have a maximum of four tapholes and two casthouses
 nal ke madhyam se kachche lohe or dhaatumal ke nikalne ke baad nalchhidr ko phir se durdamy mitti se band kar diya jaataa he
 Toure is used to implement hot blast which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace
 garm blast ko aadhaar ke paas tour ke naam pani se thanda kiye jane vaale tambe kii tontiyon ke madhyam se bhatti main le jaaya jaataa he
 The hot blast temperature can range from 900 ° c to 1300 ° C, depending on the design and condition of the stove
 unke taapmaana sahane kii kshamta 2000 degree celsius se 2300 degree celsius tak ho sakati he
 Oil, alkatara, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can be added to the furnace at the tier level to release the additional energy required to increase productivity
 pighale hue lohe kaa utpaadan karne vaali mukhya rasinic pratikriya is prakaar he: This reaction can be divided into multiple phases of which the preheated blast air flowing into the furnace as the first phase reacts with carbon in the form of coke resulting in the production of carbon mono oxide and heat: garm carbon mono oxide louh ayask ko kam karne vaala kaarak he or yah aayran oxide ke saath pratikriya karke pighale hue lohe or carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan karata he
 Iron is converted into several phases depending on the temperature of different parts of the furnace
 bhatti ke sabase upree bhaag main jahaan taapmaana aam taur par 200 degree celsius or 700 degree celsius ke bich hota he, aayran oxide ko aayran aayran oxide, fe3o4 main badal diya jaataa he
 At a temperature of about 850 ° C, the iron is converted to iron oxide in a bit more like below: taji bhojya saamagree ke rup main bhatti se hokar guzarane vaali hawa main maujuud nitrogen, garm carbon dioxide or apratikriya vaali carbon monooxide pratikriya kshetra main pravesh karti he
 When these gases move downstream, the unfavorable-current gases heat the feed charge as well as convert limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: jab aayran oxide 1200 degree celsius tak ke ucchtar taapmaana vaale kshetra main pravesh karti he to yah aage chalakar louh dhaatu main parinat ho jaataa he: The carbon dioxide produced in this process converts to carbon mono oxide again with the help of coke
 bhatti ke gasiy vaataavaran ko niyantrit karne vaali mukhya pratikriya ko baudward pratikriya kaha jaataa he: The process of limestone decomposition in the central areas of the furnace proceeds according to the following reaction: apghaton dwaara nirmit calcium oxide lohe main maujuud vibhinn amleey ashuddhiyon ke saath pratikriya karke ek faiyalitic dhaatumal kaa nirmaan karti he jo anivaary rup se calcium silicket, casio3 he: The "pig iron" manufactured by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of about 4 to 5 percent, making it very brittle and used for limited and immediate commercial purposes
 kuch pig aayran kaa istemaal cast aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Most pig iron manufactured by blast furnaces undergo an additional process to reduce carbon content and to manufacture various level steel used for tools and construction materials
 haalanki blast bhattiyon kii kaarykushalta main lagaataar vikaas ho rahaa he lekin phir bhi blast bhatti ke andar hone vaali rasinic prakriya main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 According to the American Iron and Steel Institute: "blast furnaces will exist for millennia because large and efficient furnaces can manufacture hot metal at a lower cost than other iron manufacturing technologies
 " blast bhattiyon kii sabase badi khaamiyon main se ek khami yah he ki inamen anivaary rup se carbon daai oxide kaa nirmaan hota he kyonki carbon dwaara aayran oxide ko parivartit karke loha praapt kiya jaataa he or iskaa koi kifayati vikalp nahin he - ispaat nirmaan duniya main carbon daai oxide utsarjan ke aprihaary audyogic yogadanakartaaon main se ek he 
 The challenge established by the blast furnace's greenhouse gas emissions is being addressed at ULCOS, an ongoing European program
 kam se kam 50% tak vishisht utsarjan main katautee karne ke liye kai nae prakriya margon kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he or unki baariki se jaanch kii gai he
 Some insist on storing CO2 after it is acquired while others suggest decontamination of iron and steel production through hydrogen, electricity and biomass

 Probiotics are a type of food item, which includes living bacteria or microorganisms
 probiotic vidhi roosi vaigyanik eli macnicof ne 20veen shatabdi main prastut kii thi
 For this he was also awarded the Nobel Prize later
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar probiotic ve jivit sookshmjeev hote hai jiskaa seven karne par maanav sharir main jaruri tatv sunishchit ho jate hai
 They improve digestion by increasing the number of good bacteria in the body
 is vidhi ke anusaar sharir main do tarah ke jeevanu hote hai, ek mitra or ek shatru
 If food is ingested by friendly bacteria, then gradually they prove effective in destroying the enemy bacteria available in the body
 mitra jeevanu prakritik sroton or bhojan se praapt hote hai, jaise doodh, dahi or kuch paundhon se bhi milte hai
 So far only three-four such bacteria are known which are used in probiotic form
 inamen lactobasilas, bifido, yeast or basilli hai
 These are collected and added to probiotic foods
 vaigyanikon ke ab tak ke adhyayan ke anusaar is tarah se sharir main pahunchane vaale jeevanu kisi prakaar kii haani bhi nahin pahunchaate hai
 Their role in the prevention of diseases in research has been found to be positive and no side effects are known
 maanav pachan tantra ek badi sankhya main sookshmjivon se bharaa hota he, jinase bhojan ko pachaane main madad milti he
 Along with these associate bacteria, there are many such bacteria in the digestive system, which are prone to spread diseases
 probiotic jeevanuon se pachan tantra main flora vyavasthit hone ke saath hanikaarak jeevanuon ke prasar par niyantran bhi sambhav hota he
 For this reason, often after giving antibiotics for a long time, doctors advise the patient to take probiotics
 lambii beemaari ke maamalon main sahyogi jeevanuon kaa kshay ho jaataa he, jiskaa sidhaa asar pachan tantra par padataa he
 It is also called bio-safe food
 iske alaava probiotic sankraman se hone vaale rogon par niyantran main bhi sahaayak hota he
 They also organize lactose intake in the body
 lactose kii maatra ke kaaran kii vajah se hi kai baar bachche or vayask doodh pachaa nahin pate hai, ise lactose intolerance kehete hai
 Milk intake is essential for children as it is a major source of calcium
 isamen probiotic jeevanu sahaayak rahete hai
 Probiotic contains lactic acid bacteria that convert lactose sugar present in milk into lactic acid
 probiotic khadyon se colon cancer se bachaav bhi hota he
 Some research has shown that people using probiotic products are much less likely to develop colon cancer
 isse cholesterol par bhi niyantran hota he
 Blood pressure is also controlled by the use of milk and supplemented food products
 yah maanav sharir ke pratiraksha tantra ke liye bhi laabhadaayak hota he, jisase sharir rogaanuon se bachaav karne main sakasham ho paata he
 Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium food and supplements also help in the prevention of diarrhea

 There have also been many studies on their effects which prove that they can be beneficial in preventing some diseases
 lekin upachaar main inaki bhoomika kii pushti abhi tak nahin hui he
 Therefore, according to Indian medical practitioners, probiotic food should not be taken as a medicine, but only in complete food form
 bharat ke swasthya vibhaag salaahkaar ke anusaar videshon main pryobiotic khaadya par bahut shodh hue hai
 According to these researches, probiotics have been effective in preventing diarrhea, diabetes, lower respiratory infections, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, etc
 inke niyamit seven se raktchaap or cholestrol vruddhi bhi rukati he
 Their use in diarrhea infection is effective as a treatment
 abhi tak ye parinaam videshi logon par hue adhyayanon par aadhaarit hai, va bhartiya logon par pareekshan abhi baaki hai
 Indian Council of Medical Research has prepared a guide for India to regulate probiotic foods, which will come into effect from January 2010
 ye maargdarshika rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium ke tahat taiyaar kii gai hai
 The main provision in this is that no probiotic company will claim to cure any disease from them
 yadi company aisa karnaa chaahati he, to use apane utpaadon ko praayogic pareekshan ke liye bhi panjikrut karana hoga or dawaaon kii tarah unke maanviya praayogic pareekshan kiye jaayenge tathaa uske parinaam sahi aane par hi company aisa kar sakegi
 And with this, that food can be kept in the category of probiotic medicine rather than food

 ve bengal ke senvansh ke antim naresh lakshmanasen ke ashrith mahakavi the
 The date of 1116 AD on an inscription of Lakshmanasen, therefore Jayadeva must have composed Geetgovind at this time
 ‘shri gitgovind’ sahitya jagat main ek anupam kriti he
 Its captivating composition style, sentimentality, melodious raga-ragini, religious immediacy and melodious gentle-ear-footsteps provide a rare joy to literary Ras Pipasu
 atah dow e bi kith ne apane ‘sanskrit sahitya ke itihaas’ main ise ‘apratim kavy’ mana he
 In the book 'on the Musical Modes of the Hindus' written by William Jones in 1784, Geetgovind has been considered as 'pastoral Drama' ie 'gopanatya'
 uske baad san 1837 main french vidvan edwin arnold tarsan ne ise ‘lirical drama’ yaa ‘geetinaty’ kaha he
 In Van Schroder's 'travel Management' and Pishal Levi's 'melo Drama', in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Geetgovind has been called 'dharmanataka'
 isi tarah anek vidwaanon ne apane-apane dhang se iske sambandh main vichaar vyakt kiya he
 The German poet Goethe praised Geetgovind in the same way as Abhigyanasakuntalam and Meghdootam
 gitgovind kavy main jayadev ne jagadish kaa hi jagannatha, dashavathari, hari, murari, madhuriphu, keshav, madhav, krishna ityadi naamon se ullekh kiya he
 It is a complete book containing 24 arrangements and 72 verses, in which the union and reunion of Radha and Krishna are bound by gentle and graceful positions
 kintu nagari prachaarini sabha dwaara prakashit ‘hastlikhit sanskrit granth suchi, bhaag-i’ main gitgovind kaa 13vaan sarg bhi uplabdh he
 But this mother seems to be archaic
 gitgovind vaishnav sampradaay main atyadhik aadrut he
 Hence, it has been adopted as a regular service in Sri Jagannath temple since the middle of the 13th century
 is geetikavy ke prayek prabandh main kavi ne kavifal swaroop sukhad, yashasvi, punyarup, mokshad aadi shabdon kaa prayog karke iske dharmik tathaa darshanik kavy hone kaa bhi parichay diya he
 Shringar Ras narrates the tradition of Jayadeva Kalidas
 gitgovind kaa raas varnan shrimadbhagwat ke varnan se samya rakhata he; tathaa shrimadbhagwat ke skandh 10, adhyay 40 main akrur stuti main jo dashavathar kaa varnan he, gitgovind ke pratham sarg ke stuti varnan se samya rakhata he
 Later, many 'anukriti' poems of Geetagovind were composed
 atah jayadev ne swayan 12wein sarg main likhaa he - This has been confirmed in Kumbhakarna Praneet 'rasikapriya' vaccine etc
 gitgovind kii lokapriyata or saushthav ke kaaran bharat kii prayek bhashaa main gadhy or padya main tathaa angreji, latin, french, german, arabi, farsi aadi bhashaaon main iskaa anuwaad kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, the translations, commentaries, commentaries and commentaries written in Sanskrit language are impossible to find in any other language
 kisi tikaakar ne iskaa shringaar pradhan kavy ke rup main varnan kiya he to kisi ne bhakthi sampradaay ko mahatva dekar ise bhakthi kavy mana; to kisi ne sangeet ko pradhanta dekar ise sangeet shaastra kaa rup diya he evam kisi-kisi tikaakar ne shabdamadhurya or saushthav ko lekar isaki shabd vyutpatyatmak vyakhya kii he
 Hence, Geetgovind is undoubtedly an all-inclusive independent text
 gitgovind ke pratham tikaakar udaynacharya ne ‘bhavavibhavini’ tikaa likhi he
 Udayanacharya, who lives on the banks of Prachi, very close to Jagannath Puri, was a dear friend and admirer of Jade Dev
 san 1170 se 1198 ke madhya main ‘bhavavibhavini’ tikaa likhi gayi thi, jisamen 100 shloke hai
 Its three maternal families are available in Udaipur and Nagpur
 ‘gitgovind’ kavy main baarah sarg hai, jinka choubees prabandhon main vibhaajan hua he
 These arrangements are subdivided into verses or songs
 prayek pad athwa geet main aath padya hai
 The speakers of the songs are Krishna, Radha or Radha's friend
 atyant nairashya or niravadhi-viyog ko chhodkar bhartiya prem ke shesh sabhi roopon - abhilaashaa, irshyaa, pratyaasha, niraashaa, coup, maan, punarmilan tathaa harshollas aadi—kaa badi tanmayata or kushalta ke saath varnan kiya gaya he
 The description of all these forms of love, apart from being very interesting, succulent and lively, is so beautiful that it seems as if the poet is translating it into poetry by giving the scripture, that is, the form of emotion to the mind, or the abstract into tangible form
 samodadamodar Akleshkeshv mugdh madhusudan Balsamic madhusudan sakanksh pundaricaksh Kunthbachunth nagarnarayan Billikalakshmipati mandamkund Clever quadrilateral sanand damodar Superlative gitgovind 12ve shatvdi main likhi gayi ek aisi kavy rachana he jo hame bhagwaan krishna or radharani ke prem ke bare main bataati he
 It has 12 chapters in total
 yah kavy odisha rajya ke bhubaneshwar or puri shahar ke madhyavarti kendubilva yaa kenduli shashan naam ke gaanv main vaas karne vaale brahman jayadev ki kriti he
 Jaidev, with the help of his wife Padmavati, made such a change that Tatkalin started to be the king of Utkal
 phir jab gitgovind ki praadhanya jagannatha ji ne swapn main raja ko bataayi tab se mandir ke devadasi raat ke ekaant seva or subah ki seva main prabhu jagannatha ke saamne odishi nrity rup main pesh karne lage
 Earlier scholars believed that Jayadeva is the councilor of the king of Bengal
 par shilaalekh evam pracheen mandir jo odisha main maujuud he, unase pramanit hua ki jayadev jagannatha ke bhakt the or utkal rajya ke vaasi the
 Even today, Geetgovind Sarvajanin is becoming beloved through Odissi dance
 odishi nrity hi jayadev kaa odisha praant k hona suchit karata he
 His Geetagovind poetry was propagated in Padoshi, Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 phir uttarbharat main khaastaur par rajasthan main mirabai ke dwaara hua
 In Gurugranth Sahib, we also write the name of Bhagat Jayadev, who is the author of Geetgovind
 ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa rachana-kaushal is prakaar sarvatha naveen evam nitant moulik he ki uske kavy-rup kaa nirnay karnaa hi dushkar ban gaya he
 Some Western scholars call it 'rustic-metaphor', while other reviewers call it 'gitanatak', in some others it is a 'sophisticated journey'
 pishelle is kavy ko ‘sangeet roopak’ sweekaar karte hai
 Levi considers this to be an intermediate or coordinated form of song and metaphor, but Jayadeva has divided his work into cantos and alluded to his conception of poetry as a place of drama
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki is kavy main naatak kii bhaanti ank, prastaavna aadi kuch bhi nahin he
 Some scholars also call it 'shringar Epic'
 krishnaswami ayangaar ne apane granth ‘a history of indian opera' main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko sangeetnataka kaa ek purvarup mana he or uskaa vikaas evam utkrisht paripaak solahavin shatabdi ke shri tirthanarayan swami kii rachana ‘krishnalila tarangini’ main sweekaar kiya he
 In this regard, Acharya Baldev Upadhyay's premise is based on the assumption that the names of ragas and talas with the words of 'gitagovind' infer the fact that the poet's sight may have been towards the Mahotsavas prevalent in Bengal in those days
 , Which used songs with dance and music
 is aadhaar par is kavy ko ‘sangitaroopak’ bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Nature has a very important place in the depiction of human beauty
 is sandarbh main ‘gitgovind’ kavy main ruturaj vasant, chandra-jyotsna, surabhit samir tathaa yamuna tat ke mohak kunjon kaa bada hi sundar varnan dekhne ko miltaa he
 Even in this poetry, birds are visible to the bird singing the power of love and glory
 jayadev ne is kavy main vaidarbhi reeti—maadhurya vyanjak varnon vaali style—kaa prayog kiya he
 In poetry, long spans have been used at some places, but still there was no sense of obscurity
 vastutah kavi ne vishesh-vishesh utsavon par sarv-saadhaaran ke gane ke liye hi to geeton kii rachana kii thi
 Therefore, it was necessary to keep them comprehensible
 geeton main na keval asaadhaaran swaabhaaviktaa he, apitu unamem anupam maadhurya bhi he
 In praise of the composition style of 'gitagovind', macdonal says - "there is no resemblance of 'gitagovind' poetic style in the entire Sanskrit literature in beauty, in musical utterances and in the beauty of composition
 kavy ke adhyayan se spasht ho jaataa he ki kavi main kahin laghu padon kii vegavati dhara dwaara, to kahin chaaturya ke saath rachit deergh samaason kii laypurna gati dwaara apane pathakon-shrotaaon par yathesht prabhaav daalane kii adbhut kshamta he
 The poet Nana is unique not only in the use of verses, but also in bringing rhetoric between the middle and the end of the steps
 ’’ In 'geetgovind' poetry, Jayadev has adopted an all new and original style by not following the traditional composition system
 shloke, gadhy or geet ke mili-jule prayog dwaara kavy main anupam rachana-maadhurya kii sristi hui he
 The poet has used shlokas in descriptive contexts such as the visual planning or stage-specific depiction required for sustaining the narrative
 paatro kii manodasha ko suchit karne vaale sanvadatmak prasangon main gadhy kaa prayog hua he tathaa bhavanubhuti kii abhivyanjana padyon main kii gayi he
 Thus, in the innovative composition system adopted in 'geetgovind', the characters, dialogues and songs are interwoven in such a way that they feel a unique joy
 is anupam rachana-style ke aavishkarta jayadev, apane upmaan aap hi hai
 radha-krishna's racy portrayal of the Keli stories and his convergent pastimes make Geetagovind a captivating book of spiritual adornment
 radha-krishna ke pranay ke chithran main prem kii vividh dashaon—aashaa, niraashaa, utkantha, irshyaa, coup, maan, aakrosh, milanotsukata, sandesh-preshan tathaa milan aadi—kaa jaisaa abhibhoot karne vaala hridaygrahi chithran is kavy main hua he, vaisaa anyatra dhundhane par bhi kahin nahin miltaa
 Radha does not like or tolerate raas-vilas with Sri Krishna's gopis
 radha apni sakhi ke madhyam se shrikrishna ke prati apana aakroshamulak upalambh bhejti he, parantu us anany pranyini ko itane se santosh nahin hota, uskaa prem nirbhar-hriday use apane priyatam ke prati apane pragadh anuraag ko vyaktigat rup se prakat karne ko vivash kar detaa he
 On the arrival of Radha, Shri Krishna leaves Braj and the beauties and is oriented towards him
 radha kii sakhi shrikrishna se radha kii or radha se shrikrishna kii ek-duusare main gahan anurakti kaa tathaa ek-duusare se dur rahane par anubhav kii ja rahi virahajanya vednaa kaa maarmik varnan karti he
 She inspires the two to meet each other with her soft and gentle words
 chandroday hone par pranay-vyathaa se adheer bani radha apane uddipt anuraag par niyantran nahin rakh paati or uski abhivyakti ko vivash ho jaati he
 Radha expresses her anger and resentment towards him with utterances filled with utterances upon Shri Krishna's arrival
 idhar radha kii sakhi radha se maan ko chhodane kaa anurodh karti he udhar swayan shrikrishna radha ke rup-soundarya kii prashansa ke vyaaj se uski chatukaarita karte hue use manaane evam apane anukool banane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 Eventually Radha's values go away and she goes to kadamba-kunj to meet her Kant
 vahaan shrikrishna radha se pranay-yachana karte hue usase lajja-sankoch ko chhodane kaa anurodh tathaa rati-bhoga main sahyog dene kaa manuhaar karte hai
 Both of them indulge in a rishi play with a happy mind, and after this Radha asks Pranayasikthan utterances to make her adornment to her beloved Shri Krishna
 apni pranpriya ke anurodh ko gaurav dete hue shrikrishna saharsha apane haathon se radha kaa shringaar karte hai
 Some critics today accuse Jayadeva of making devotion to radha-krishna as an adornment, but this blasphemy on the poet worshiping the melody is not only unjust but his own indiscretion
 vastutah daampaty pranay main uplabdh tanmayata athwa talleenta ke charam utkarsh kii tathaa bhed main abhed kii kalpana ke chudant nidarshan kii abhivyakti hi bhakthi ke kshetra main maadhurya bhav kii sristi karti he
 For the devotees who worship with a sweet sentiment, the beautiful gestures, luxuries and love stories of God are lyrical and noteworthy
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki vidwaanon ne is saare kavy ko 'aprastut prashansa' maanakar vaacharth main chhipe vyangyarth ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas sweekaar kiya he
 According to his opinion, Shri Krishna is the symbol of 'soul of creatures'
 gopiyon kii krida anek prakaar kaa vah prapanch he, jisamen agyaan-avasthaa main fansi manushyon kii aatma bhatakati rahati he
 Radha is the symbol of Brahmanand, only on achieving that, the individual gets extreme happiness
 katipay vidwaanon ke anusaar jayadev radha kaa upaask na hokar shrikrishna ke hi upaask the
 Therefore, Krishna is not a symbol of the soul of humans but a symbol of God
 is tathy ko vaani dete hue acharya baldev upaadhyaay likhte hai—‘‘shringaar-shiromani shrikrishna bhagwat-tatva ke pratinidhi hai or unki premi gopikaayen jeev kii pratik hai
 The union of radha-krishna is the union of jiva-brahma
 is prakaar sadhana maarg ke anek tathyon ke rahasy ko yahaan suljhaayaa gaya he
 '' ‘gitgovind’ vastutah ek anupam evam adbhut granth he, jiske uddaam-shringaar ke antstal main rahasyamayi maadhurya bhaavana kii nigudh dhara bah rahi he
 In the entire Sanskrit literature, no other composition of this category is sweet
 sanskrit bharti ke soundarya or maadhurya kii paraakaashtha kaa avlokan karnaa ho, to ‘gitgovind’ kaa anushilan karnaa chahie
 Its vignette depicts beauty as it is
 iske geeton ke pad-laalitya alokik maadhurya kaa sanchaar karata he
 The beauty of its verses provides unbeatable joy
 shabd or arth kaa saamanjasy aisa manomuguakari he ki sanskrit se aparichit vyakti bhi usase prabhavit hue bina nahin rah saktaa
 Its Komalakant phrase is rare in the poetry of any language of the world
 is kavy main prayukt deergh samaason main bhi vilakshan prasadikta evam swar-maadhurya he
 The poet is unique in the use of alliteration
 unke geeton main anupras kaa prayog padon ke ant main hi nahin, madhya main bhi apni chata bikherta hua chalata he
 Such a gem-glass combination of fine verses and the Komalakant phrase has been made that the mere expression of the songs leads to the emergence and communication of the corresponding rasa in the hearts of the millennials
 shringaar kii vyanjana ke liye yah anuthi style badi hi sarthak siddh hui he
 'geetgovind' gained immense fame and popularity
 jayadev ne jis gram main rahete hue ‘gitgovind’ kii rachana kii, us gaanv kaa naam hi jayadevapur pad gaya
 King Pratap Rudradeva of Orissa, a contemporary of the poet, issued an order for singers, musicians and dancers of his kingdom to sing the verses of 'geetgovind'
 maharaj ne jayadev ko is kavy rachana ke liye ‘kavirajraj’ kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya
 'geetgovind' had become sufficiently popular and popular during Jayadeva's lifetime - many evidences are found
 dakshin main to vah itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya ki iske padyon ko tirupati balaji ke mandir kii sidhiyon par dravin lipi main khudhvaya gaya
 In the Shrivallabh sect, it has the same reputation as the Srimad Bhagavat Purana
 vaishnavon main yah vishwaas he ki ‘gitgovind’ jahaan gaaya jaataa he, vahaan bhagwaan kaa avashya hi pradurbhaav hota he
 Due to this, a law has been made not to sing it in an inappropriate place in this community, which is strictly followed
 vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev kavi ko is sampradaay kii madhyavastha kaa mukhya mahanubhav mana gaya he
 According to the following verse prevalent in the community, the Vishnu Swami, who was promoted by Vishnu Swami and promoted by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya, gave protection to the community by the devotee poet Jayadeva in the midst of these two great personalities
 is prakaar vaishnav sampradaay main jayadev bhi guru ke rup main vandaneey hai— Jayadeva invented a new formulation system in Sanskrit by creating 'geetgovind'
 ‘gitgovind’ ke anukaran par sanskrit main ‘abhinav gitgovind’, ‘gitaraghav’, ‘gitgangadhar’ tathaa ‘krishnagit’ jaise anek geet kaavyon kii rachana hui, parantu koi bhi kavi apane kavy main ‘gitgovind’ jaisi utkrushtataa laane main safal nahin hua
 Here in India, Bharatendu Harishchandra tried to translate it in Brajbhasha, but the translation of 'true poetry' cannot be done - this statement has proved to be literally true in relation to 'geetgovind'
 anuwaad main mul rachana ke ras-bhav kii avatarana asambhav nahin, to kathin avashya he
 The German poet Goethe's comment on the translation of the 'geetgovind' poem in the Anglo-language by Sir William Jones is very accurate
 ‘A Real Poetry is that, which cannot be translated
’’ arthath utkrisht kavita kii pahchaan kaa aadhaar hi yahi he ki uskaa duusari bhashaa main anuwaad nahin ho saktaa
 Thirty-five scholarly efforts are available to understand the song of 'gitagovind' and to communicate its beauty to the gentlemen, but this poem is such a deep ocean that anyone who dips deep into it
 uske haath main utane hi durlabh evam bahumoolya ratna aa jate hai
 Poetry composed by some poets on the emulation of this poetry is a sign of Jaydev's acceptance of kirti-kaumudi's lightness and excellence
 bhakthi, shringaar or kavitv kii trivenirup ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa krishna-bhakthi sahitya main ek anya drushti se bhi ullekhneey mahatva he
 It is a well-known fact that before this poetry, the names of Rukmini and Satyabhama were used as the beloved or wife of Shri Krishna
 radha naam kii kisi stri kaa koi astitv nahin tha
 In the Srimad Bhagavat Purana, there is a mention of one Gopi worshiping 'anayaradhito Nunam' Sri Krishna, but there is no mention of Shri Krishna's beloved wife, Radha, who attained importance at the same time as Krishna who joined with Krishna
 
 radha ko is ucch sthaan—shrikrishna kii anany sahachari evam unase abhinn tathaa unki nityashaktirupa—par pratishthit karne ke shrey ‘gitgovindakaar’ jayadev ko hi praapt he
 On the basis of the continual vilas of radha-krishna depicted in this book, the Brahma Vyavarta Purana describes the beauty and actions of radha-krishna, but it is a harsh truth that the Puranakas neither describe 'geetagovind' poetry
 No one has been able to sustain dignity and decency, nor has the description been made as simple, interesting and heart-warming
 is kshetra main bhi jayadev apane upmaan aap hi hai
 It is on this basis that perhaps 'geetagovind' poetry in krishna-bhakti literature has the distinction of scripture

 Some of the salient features of the Kepler 22b planet are as follows- amoeba jeevvaigyanik vargeekaran main ek vansh he tathaa is vansh ke sadasyon ko bhi praayah amoeba kaha jaataa he
 There is a very simple type of animal whose most species are found in rivers, ponds, freshwater lakes, pools, water pits etc
 kuch sambandhit jatiyaan mahatvapurn paraseete or rogakaari hai
 The living amoeba is a very microscopic animal, although members of some of its castes are 1 / 2 mm long
 Can be of greater diameter
 sanrachana main yah jivaras ke chote dher jaisaa hota he, jiskaa aakaar nirantar dhire-dhire badalata rahata he
 The cytoplasm is protected from the outer covering of the microscopic shell
 swayan kosharas ke do spasht str pahachaane ja sakate hai-baahar kii ore kaa svachh, kanrahit, kaanch jaisaa, gadha bahya ras tathaa uske bheetar kaa adhik taral, dhoosarit, kanayukt bhaag jise aantar ras kehete hai
 The internal juice also has a large nucleus
 sampurna aantar ras anek choti badi annadhaaniyon tathaa ek yaa do sankochi rasdhaniyon se bharaa hota he
 Each food contains food and some liquids
 inke bheetar hi pachan kii kriya hoti he
 Shatukhirasadhani contains only fluid
 iskaa nirmaan ek choti dhaani ke rup main hota he, kintu dhire-dhire yah badhati he or ant main fat jaati he tathaa iskaa taral baahar nikal jaataa he
 The process of amoeba is very interesting
 iske sharir ke kuch asthaayee pravaradh nikalate hai jinako kutapaad kehete hai
 In the direction of practice, a pseudopod comes out, then in the same pseudopod, gradually all the kosharas flow
 iske baad hi, yaa saath saath, nayaa kutapaad banane lagata he
 According to Hymen, Mast, etc
, the kootapadas are formed due to some physical changes in the kosharas
 sharir ke pichley bhaag main kosharas gadhe godan kii avasthaa se taral sthiti main parivartit hota he or iske vipareet agle bhaag main taral sthiti se jail sthiti main
 Due to being too thick, the gel formed further pulls the cytoplasm towards itself
 amoeba jivit praaniyon kii tarah apana bhojan grahan karata he
 He devours all types of organic particles - living or non-living
 in bhojanakanon ko vah kai kutapadon se gher letaa he; phir kutapadon ke ek duusare se mil jane se bhojan kaa kan kuch taral ke saath annadhaani ke rup main kosharas main pahunch jaataa he
 There is secretion of amalgam, alkaline digestive products first in the food grains from kosharas, due to which the proteins are definitely digested
 kuch logon ke anusaar mand tathaa vasa kaa pachan bhi kuch jatiyon main it happens
 pachan ke baad pachit bhojan kaa shoshan ho jaataa he or apachya bhaag chalankriya ke bich kramash: sharir ke pichley bhaag main pahunchataa he or phir uskaa parityag ho jaataa he
 There is no special part to abandon
 shwasan tathaa utsarjan kii kriyaayein amoeba ke bahm tal par praaia: sabhi sthanon par hoti hai
 Special organs are not required for them because the body is very subtle and surrounded by water
 koshikaras kii rasakarshan daab baahar ke jal kii apeksha adhik hone ke kaaran jal baraabar koshakala ko paar karata hua kosharas main jamaa hota he
 As a result, the body can swell and burst at the end
 at: jal kaa yah aadhiky ek do choti dhaniyon main ekatra hota he
 This marsupial grows slowly and rises to a limit and all water is released
 isiilie isko sankochi dhaani kehete hai
 In this way, amoeba control is controlled
 prajnan ke pehle amoeba golakaar ho jaataa he, iskaa cendrak do centrakon main bant jaataa he or phir jivaras bhi bich se khinchakar bant jaataa he
 Thus two small amoebas are formed by division from one amoeba
 sampurna kriya ek ghante se kam main hi purna ho jaati he
 Before the unfavorable season, the amoeba abandons the cereals and demure granules, and a hard cyst surrounding it is prepared, within which it is safe in summer or winter
 pani suukh jane par bhi puti ke bheetar kaa amoeba jivit bana rahata he
 Yes, meanwhile, all his life processes remain almost nil

 The amoeba inside the cyst does not die even after boiling water is added

 There can be six types of amoebas in the human end
 unamem se ek ke kaaran pravahika utpann hoti he jise amebajanya pravahika kehete hai
 This amoeba pierces the upper layer of the intestine and enters inside
