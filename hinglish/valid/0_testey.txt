 Dev has the distinction of great poet under Brajbhasha poetry of Hindi
 unka puraa naam devdatt tha
 He was born in the Hindi language
 yadhyapi ye pratibha main bihari, bhushan, matiram aadi samakaleen kaviyon se kam nahin varan kuch badhkar hi siddh hote hai, phir bhi inkaa kisi ek vishisht rajdurbar se sambandh na hone ke kaaran inaki waisi khyaati or prasiddhi nahin hui
 Among the writers who have made Dev highly famous, Mishrabandhu is whose idea that Dev's place in Hindi literature comes after Tulsi
 dev or bihari main koun adhik shreshth he isko lekar ek vivaad bhi chalaa tha
 In this connection, the book 'dev and Bihari' was written by Pandit Krishnabihari Mishra and 'bihari and Dev' was written by Lala Bhagwadin
 in donon main dev or bihari kii kavypratibha ko spasht karne kaa praytn he
 Although six-seven poets named 'dev' are found under Hindi literature, other than the famous poet Dev, other poets named 'dev' did not get any special fame
 prasiddh dev kavi kaa janm san
 1730 main hua tha
 These Dyusaria Kanyakubj Dwivedi were Brahmins
 inkaa nivasasthaan itawa tha, jaisaa 'bhavvilas' kii nimnlikhit pankti se spasht hota he- His birth anniversary is also confirmed on the basis of 'bhavavilas', which he composed in Samvat 1746
 vah doha is prakaar he- Dev did his creations by staying at several shelters
 inaki rachana 'ashtyam' aurangzeb ke putr aajamshah ke sanket par hui thi or usne unhen puraskrit bhi kiya tha
 Perhaps 'bhavavilas' is also written in the shelter of Azam Shah
 dev ke duusare ashrayadata dadripati raja seetaram ke bhattije bhavanidutt vaisya the
 These Charkhi were residents of Dadri
 inke liye inhone 'bhavanivilas' naamak granth likhaa
 Dev's third refuge was Kushal Singh
 ye faphund ke rahanevaale the or dev ne inke liye 'kushalvilas' naamak granth kii rachana kii
 Dev's real qualities - customers and refugees were Raja Bhogilal, for whom he composed a book called 'rasavilas'
 inke sambandh main dev ne apane rasvilas main likhaa he- Dev's work 'premchandrika' is dedicated to Udyot Singh, son of Rao Mardansingh of Dyondia Khede
 'sujanvinod' kii rachana dilli ke rais pathiram ke putr sujanmani ke liye hui

 Some say the number of his texts is 72 and some people 52
 parantu inke pramanik granth, jo praapt hote hai, 18 hai
 The other nine texts are also mentioned by his name and thus a total of 27 texts match his name
 nirvivaad rup se jin 18 granthon ko devkrut sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he ve is prakaar hai- Handwritten texts are - devkrut ek sanskrit granth bhi 'shrangar vilasini' naam se bharatpur se prakashit hua tha
 Its theme is also Shringar and heroine, and Hindi verses have been composed in Sanskrit language in this book
 yadhyapi isaki rachana shuddh sanskrit main he, phir bhi dev kii vaastavik pratibha ke darshan isamen nahin hote
 To conclude from these majority texts of Dev that all texts are different from each other is misleading
 inke ek granth ke anek chand duusare granthon main milte hai or praaia: inhone apane kisi purvavarti granth ko ashrayadata kaa naam badalakar doosraa naam de diya he
 Most of Deva's narrative themes are love and adornment, but his perception of love and adornment is extremely high and his spirit is expressed in a sublime and bright form
 dev kaa kavyashastreey vivechan bhi, jo inke granthon main lakshan anshon main praapt hota he, apni moulik visheshta rakhata he
 But much of Dev's fame is contained in examples, not in his traits
 dev ke savaiya or ghanaakshari donon hi apni chhap rakhte hai or dev kii sundar rachanaaon ko kisi duusare kavi kii rachanaaon se milakar chipa rakhana sambhav na hoga
 The more extensive experience one gets in the compositions of Dev, the deeper the emotionality is also gained
 kisi bhi bhav kaa dev jaisaa sajiv or marmasparshi varnan asaadhaaran vastu he
 The imagination of God does not only possess an oratory characteristic, but he is fed with the feeling of sensation and gets plucked
 isi prakaar dev kii shabdaawalee bhi apni he
 The musical flowing vocabulary in Dev's vocabulary makes the verses effortlessly memorable and Dev has had unequaled success in portraying form, beauty, object, character

 a copper vessel, or cylinder containing tin metal lining, is used in the manufacture of phenyl drinks by the paddy process
 ek saath praaia: do paatr athwa do silinderon kaa upyog shreyaskar hota he, kyonki jab ek paatr khaali ho jaataa he tab utane samay main doosraa paatr bharkar sampeden kriya ke liye uplabdh ho jaataa he

 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj

 To improve the discipline within it, a Padasopan Samiti was formed to make the party not a single elite organization but to make it a party of the national people
 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the

 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words

 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence

 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya

 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarians at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 Starting to re-commitment to their success in total control celibacy without staircase, almost failed

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer
 kai dashakon tak ve anek patron kaa sampadan kar chuke the jisame harijan, indian opinian, yang india aadi sammilit hai
 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail

 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925

 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars

 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech

 In addition to this, the collection of selected pieces from Gandhiji's entire literature and small booklets focusing on different topics have also been published under different names
 inamen do sanchayan ati prasiddh tathaa atyupayogi rahe hai or in donon kaa prakaashan bhi gandhi ji ke jivan-kaal main hi ho gaya tha: Gandhiji has also interpreted John Ruskin's Unto This Last in Gujarati

 Due to this reason there was a dispute in India at the time of publication of the book, and the Legislative Assembly of Gandhi's home state of Gujarat prohibited the sale of this book through a resolution
 leliveld ke mutabik, unki pustak ke aadhaar par gandhi kii samalangi yaa dwillingi hone ke lagaae ja rahe aankalan galat hai
 He said, "this book does not say that Gandhi was gay or bisexual

is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, The Homosexual's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 When first written "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" in 1938, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha, offering to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 ek atyaachaari ke haath main apni zaati ko dekar kiya
 Those who fear God are not afraid of the terror of death
 gandhi kii in vaktavyon ke kaaran kaafii aalochana huyi jinka jawaab unhone "yahudiyon par prashn" lekh main diya saath main unke mitron ne yahudiyon ko kiye gaye mere apil kii aalochana main samachar patr ki do kartane bhejin do aalochanaayen yah sanket karti hai ki maine jo yahudiyon ke khilaaf hue anyaay kaa upaay bataaya, vah bilkul nayaa nahin he
 


 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi
