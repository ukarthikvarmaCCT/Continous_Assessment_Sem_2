 == sangeet ==satish gurjar In mathematics, the highest and lowest value of a function is called the highest and lowest of that function
 ucchisht or nimnisht ko sammilit rup se charam kehete hai
 They can be in a limited area of high and low function or in the entire domain of that function
 falan ke kisi simit kshetra main sthit ucchisht or nimnisht ko 'sthaneey charam' kehete hai jabaki falan ke sampoorn domen main falan kaa jo sabase adhik / kam maan ho use 'global charam' kehete hai
 Low and local peak values are shown in the side diagram
 isse adhik vyapak rup se kahen to, kisi samucchy kaa ucchisht or nimnisht, us samucchy ke sadasyon main sabase adhik or sabase kam maan vaale sadsy hote hai
 The objective of optimization is to extract the peak values of the functions
 ham nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karte hai First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki donon binduon par dwitiya avkalaj dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Take the following function iskaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai: The second derivative of the function is: pratham avkalaj ko shunya rakhane par x kaa maan nimnlikhit miltaa he- x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {1} = { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 5 } The value of the second derivative of the function is negative, so x = x_1 has this function specified
 isi prakaar ham dekhte hai ki x 2 = − 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{2}=-{ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan dhanatmak he, atah x_2 par falan kaa nimnisht he
 Consider the following function whose graph is given below- sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if it is positive or negative
 atah ham nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki is falan kaa koi na ucchisht he na koi nimnisht

 Money cannot be taken for free software
 yadi software ke liye paisa nahin milegaa to kaam kaise chalegaa| tab vyapaaree varg ko aisa laga ki free software bekaar he or unhone ise apane se bahut dur rakhaa
 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the meaning of the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part

 aitarey aaranyak aitarey brahman kaa antim khand he
 There are three sections of "brahmin", of which the first section is Brahmin, which is accepted as the main part
 "aaranyak" granth kaa doosraa ansh hota he tathaa "upanishad" teesraa
 Sometimes the Upanishads are only part of the Aranyaka and sometimes it is distinguished as a separate scripture from the Aranyaka
 aitarey aaranyak apane bheetar "aitarey upanishad" ko bhi antarbhukt kiye hue hai
 Aitareya Aranyak has five invertebrates which are designated as Aranyak itself
 ye paanchon aaranyak vastut pruthak granth maane jate hai
 Even today, on the occasion of Shravani, the Rigvedi freely recite the primordial verses of these invertebrate Aranyakas, which can be considered as proof of their independent texts
 granth ke pratham aaranyak main "mahavrath" kaa varnan he jo aitarey brahman ke "gavamyan" kaa hi ek ansh he
 In the last three chapters of the Second Aranyaka there is Aitareya Upanishad
 tritiy aaranyak ko "samhitopanishad" bhi kehete hai, kyonki isamen samhita, pad or kram paathon kaa varnan tathaa swar, vyanjan aadi ke swaroop kaa vivechan he
 In the fourth Aranyaka, the Mahanamani hymns used on the fifth day of the Mahavrata are given, and in the last Aranyaka, the description of the Nishikalya Shastra ends the entire scripture
 in aaranyakon main pratham teen ke rachayita aitarey, chaturth ke aashvalyan tathaa pancham ke shaunak maane jate hai
 There is no consensus among scholars regarding the creation of Aitareya Aranyak
 doctor kith ise yaskarachit nirukt se arvachin maanakar iskaa samay shashth shatee vikrampurv maanate hai, parantu vastav main yah nirukt se pracheenatar he
 Mahidas Aitareya, who composed Aitareya Brahmana, is also the author of the first three parts of this Aranyak
 falat: aitarey aaranyak ko aitarey brahman kaa samakaleen maananaa yuktiyukt he
 The reason for considering this Aranyaka as ancient from Nirukta is that the propitious subject of its third section, which is Vedic grammar, is undoubtedly ancient by the adhoc description of both Pratiksha and Nirukta

 All this had a wide impact in the field of literature and art
 mahoba ke vishaal bhawan, kaalin ke kile or mandir ke utkrisht namoonon ken parvartika main kuch nayaa nahin joda ja sakaa

 Many Tajik refugees from Afghanistan also live in Iran and Pakistan
 apni samskruti or bhashaa ke maamle main tajik logon kaa iran ke logon se gaharaa sambandh rahaa he
 The Tajik people of China differ slightly from other Tajik people because they speak eastern Iranian languages while others speak Tajik Persian

 With the powerful hakmani and Sasani empires of Iran, they began to speak different forms of Persian over time, which is a western Iranian language
 phir bhi tajiki farsi main pracheen soudai or parthianke kai shabd milte hai, jo irani farsi main nahin milte
 Apart from Iranians, Turkish speakers have been a major influence in Central Asia

 aadhunik tajiki bhashaa par roosi bhashaa, uzbek bhashaa or uigur bhashaa ke gahare prabhaav milte hai
 Some Persian-speaking people consider Tajiki to be purer than Iranian Persian, because the Arab invasion and occupation of Iran was heavily influenced by the Arabic language
 irani farsi kii tulana main tajiki farsi main arabi ke shabd kam hai or pracheen farsi mul ke shabd adhik hai
 There are two types of Persian spoken in Tajikistan
 ek to rozaana boli jane vaali farsi he, jise 'zabaan-e-kuuchaa' kehete hai, yani 'gali-kuche kii bhashaa'
 The second formally spoken is 'zaban-e-adabi', ie 'the language of Adab'

 In trade, large scale harvesting of skins is mandatory before leather tanning is started
 isamen dhyaan is baat kaa rakhana padataa he ki kamai ghar pahunchne se pehle khaalen sadane na lag jaayan
 For this, temporary preservation of the skins is done

 Best to pack large or calves on the skins, immediately after being sprayed, sprinkle dry salt powder, or place them in a highly saturated salt solution
 yadi adhik dinon tak rakhana pade to lavanit khaalon ko chaaya main failaa yaa lataka kar sukhaana
 In this, treatment of arsenic solution is desirable to protect the skins from decay or insecticide

 This final cleaning adds softness to the leather
 yahi vah rasinic parivartan he jiske falswaroop chamada banataa he
 In the earliest times, only plants of vegetation were used for this, but modern industrialism has invented many chemical substances for tanning
 aajkal adhiktam chamada krom vidhi se banataa he, kintu kuch chamade abhi tak vanaspatik charmpak dwaara taiyaar kiye jate hai : In ancient times, the only vanjhachal was used for tanning, but now many other botanical materials are used
 inhen parkin mahoday main mukhyatya teen virgon main baanta he : a quality of elongated tannins is that their treatment creates a ruddy, dorsal deposit of ilic acid on the leather, but not from the other two tannins
 is nikshep se taiyaar chamade main dridhtaa aati he, kintu baad main yadi chamade ko rangnaa ho, to yah baadhak hota he
 Synthetic tannins - These include a species called tannin syntheses

 These light parts and small skins cut the skin without cutting
 phir unki motaai yadi aavashyaktaa se adhik ho, to chiraai mashin dwaara vaanchit motiwali samtal parten bana lete hai
 In the entire process of botanical tanning, the concentration of tanned liquids is accurately controlled by devices that have relative density and acidity
 iskaa parichaanal teen kramon main karte hai : To complete removal of lime of these skins, wash them with water and sometimes with acid

75 bhaag salfurik amla ke tanu vilyan ke mishran ke saath pipon yaa pedal chakron main ghumaate hai, taaki avasorana purna ho jaay or khaalon kaa rang chamakdaar naarangi ho jaay
 Then remove them and sterilize them for 24 hours and spread them by machine so that the grains become flat and the wrinkles are removed
 tatpashchaat duusare avagaah main unhen 15 bhaag sodium thayosulphate ke tanu vilyan ke saath peepe ityadi main ghumaate hai
 a portion of sulfuric acid is mixed with water and run again
 isi prakaar lagbhag ek ghante main do baar ek ek bhaag amla or dekar chalaate hai
 The color of the leather finally fades to blue-green
 is vidhi kii visheshta yah he ki pehle avagaah main bicromet or amla kii kriya dwaara jo chromik amla banataa he or khaal main avashoshit hota he, vah duusare avagaah main thayosulphate or amla kii kriya dwaara bane salfuras amla se apachayit hokar samaakshareey chromium sulphate main parinat hokar tantuon main nikshipt ho jaataa he
 In addition, tetrathyonate is formed by the oxidation of thiosulfate and the free sulfur is also deposited above and inside the fibers
 yah duhare avagaah dwaara pakv chamade kii pahchaan he
 This method is simpler, more popular and it makes leather of definite quality
 isamen kramash: badhati hui sandrathawale samaakshareey chromium lavan, ) kii khaal par sidhi kriya hoti he
 In this manner also the Charmpak rotates in casks and starts with dilute solution of pakadrav and increases the concentration so that the drilling is complete
 ek saamaanya pakdrav is prakaar banataa he : In a lead-filled tank, the first 100 pounds of sodium bichromate are dissolved in 25 gallons of water, then 100 pounds of sulfuric acid are dissolved slowly in separate 25 gallons of water and added to the first solution
 thandha hone par 25 pound glucose bhi usamen tab tak chhodte jate hai jab tak vilyan kaa praarambhik naarangi rang badalakar chamakdaar gaharaa haraa na ho jaay
 The chrome tan is a rapid process

 Dayanand Saraswati's real name was Moolshankar and his early life was very comfortable
 aage chalakar ek pandit banane ke liye ve sanskrit, veda, shastron va anya dharmik pustakon ke adhyayan main lag gaye

 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God

 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof

 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis

 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court

 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival

 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist

 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments started coming to the understanding of the people and the opposition decreased
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha
