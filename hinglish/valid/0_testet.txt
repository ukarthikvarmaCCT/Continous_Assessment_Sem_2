 Once Marichi Nandan Kashyap Ji offered Kheer to please the Lord and after ending his worship, sat meditating in the fire in the evening
 usee samay daksh prajapati kii putree diti kamaatur hokar putr prapti kii laalasaa se kashyap ji ke nikat gai
 Diti prayed to Kashyap ji to make Raman with him with sweet words
 is par kashyap ji ne kaha, "he priye! main tumhen tumhaari icchaanusaar tejasvi putr avashya doongaa
 But you have to wait for a stroke
 sandhyaa kaal main suryaast ke pashchaat bhootnath bhagwaan shankar apane bhoot, pret tathaa yakshon ko lekar bail par chadh kar vichrate hai
 At this time, you will be unhappy after seeing you in Kamkrida
 atah yah samay santaanotpatti ke liye uchit nahin he
 The whole world will condemn me
 yah samay to sandhyaavandan or bhagwat pujan aadi ke liye hi he
 At this time those who behave like vampires are hellish
 " Even after explaining this to her husband, she did not understand anything and that lustful Diti took the clothes of Kashyap ji with impudence
 is par kashyap ji ne daiv ichha ko prabal samaj kar daiv ko namaskara kiya or diti kii ichha purna kii or uske baad shuddh jal se snaan kar ke sanathan brahm rup gayatri kaa jap karne lage
 Diti conceived and prayed to Kashyap ji, "O Aryaputra! Lord Bhoothnath forgive my crime and do not destroy my womb
 unka swabhaav bada ugr he
 But they always protect their devotees
 ve mere bahanoi hai main unhen namaskara karti hoon
 " kashyap jab sandhyaavandan aadi se nivruth huye to unhone apni patni ko apni santaan ke hit ke liye prarthana karte huye or thar thar kaanpati hui dekha to ve bole, "he diti! tumne meri baat nahin maani
 Your mind was involved in lust
 tumne asamay main bhoga kiya he
 Two terrible sons will be born from your womb
 sampoorn lokon ke nirparaadh praaniyon ko apane atyaacharon se ksht denge
 Will destroy religion
 sadhu or striyon ko sataayenge
 When the pot of their sins is full, God will be angry and kill them
 " Diti said, "oh God! i wish that my sons should be slaughtered by God
" brahman ke shaap se na ho kyonki brahman ke shaap ke dwaara praani narak main jaakar janm dhaaran karata he
 "then Kashyap Ji said," Oh God! You are very repentant of your karma, so your grandson will be a great devotee of God and will brighten your fame
 vah balak sadhujanon kii seva karegaa or kaal ko jeet kar bhagwaan kaa parshad banegaa
 " kashyap ji ke mukh se bhagavadbhakt pautra ke utpann hone kii baat sun kar diti ko ati prasannataa hui or apane putron kaa vadh saakshaat bhagwaan se sun kar us kaa sara khed samaapt ho gaya
 His two sons Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu were born and according to the laws of law, they went on the path of wickedness

 Once the craze, Sanandan, Sanatan and Santkumar went to the Baikunta world to see Lord Vishnu for peace of mind after being disenchanted with the whole world
 baikuntha ke dwaar par jai or vijay naam ke do dwarpal paharaa diya karte the
 Jai and Vijay stopped these sancadic sages at the door itself and started refusing to enter the Baikuntha lok
 unke is prakaar manaa karne par sanakadik rishiyon ne kaha, "are moorkhon! ham to bhagwaan vishnu ke param bhakt hai
 Our speed does not stop anywhere
 ham devadhidev ke darshan karnaa chaahate hai
 Why do you stop us from seeing them? You people live in the service of God, you should be as equitable as them
 bhagwaan kaa swabhaav param shantimay he, tumhaara swabhaav bhi vaisaa hi hona chaiye
 Let us go to see Lord Vishnu
 " rishiyon ke is prakaar kehane par bhi jai or vijay unhen baikuntha ke andar jane se rokane lage
 On stopping this type of Jai and Vijay, the Sankadik sages got angry and said, "even after being close to Lord Vishnu, egoism has come in you and the egoist cannot live in Baikunth
 isaliye ham tumhen shaap dete hai ki tum log paapayoni main jaao or apane paap kaa fal bhugto
 "jai and Vijay, fearing their cursing, fell at his feet and asked for forgiveness
 yah jaan kar ki sanakadik rishigan bhent karne aaye hai bhagwaan vishnu swayan lakshmi ji evam apane samast parshadon ke saath unke swaagat ke liy padhaare
 Lord Vishnu said to him, "O Munishvara! These are my councilors named Jai and Vijay
 in donon ne ahankaar buddhi ko dhaaran kar aapkaa apmaan karke aparaadh kiya he
 You people are my dear devotees and they have disobeyed you by disobeying you
 inako shaap dekar aapane uttam kaary kiya he
 These followers have despised the Brahmins and i consider them to be my own scorn
 main in parshadon kii ore se kshamaa yachana karata hoon
 Even when there is a crime of servants, the world considers the crime of the owner itself
 atah main aap logon kii prasannataa kii bhiksha chahta hoon
 " bhagwaan ke in madhur vachanon se sanakadik rishiyon kaa krodh tatkaal shant ho gaya
 He became very happy with this generosity of God and said, "you give so much respect to Brahmins for keeping the dignity of religion
 he nath! hamane in nirparaadh parshadon ko krodh ke vash main hokar shaap de diya he iske liye ham kshamaa chaahate hai
 If you think it is appropriate, you can forgive these gatekeepers and get rid of our curse
 " Lord Vishnu said, "O monks! i do not want to make the Brahmin's word untrue even after being omnipotent because it violates religion
 aapane jo shaap diya he vah meri hi prerana se hua he
 They are definitely part of this punishment
 ye diti ke garbh main jaakar daitya yoni ko praapt karenge or mere dwaara inkaa sanhaar hoga
 They will remain engrossed in my attention, even while being hostile to me
 mere dwaara inkaa sanhaar hone ke baad ye punah is dham main waapas aa jaavenge
 " jai or vijay baikuntha se gir kar diti ke garbh main aa gayi
 After some period, two sons were born from Diti's womb, named Prajapati Kashyap named Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha
 in donon yamal ke utpann hone ke samay teenon lokon main anek prakaar ke bhayankar utpaat hone lage
 Heaven earth, sky all started shivering and fierce storms started moving
 surya or chandra par ketu or rahu baar baar baithne lage
 Meteors began to fall

 His body became like a mountain

 Hiranyakashipu meditated and pleased Brahma
 brahma ji se usne vardaan le liya ki uski mrityu na din main ho na raat main, na ghar ke bheetar ho na baahar
 In this way he started ruling a parasol by conquering the three worlds
 uskaa chota bhai hiranyaksh uski ajna kaa palan karte huye shatruon kaa naash karne laga
 One day, while wandering, he reached Varun's Puri
 pataal lok main pahunch kar hiranyaksh ne varun dev se yuddh kii yachana karte huye kaha, "he varun dev! aapane jagat ke sampoorn daityon tathaa daanvon par vijay praapt kiya he
 i beg of you war
 aap mujhase yuddh karke apane yuddh kaushal kaa pramaan den
 Hearing that monster, Varun Dev got very angry, but looking at the time, he laughed and said, "oh brother! Now there is no desire to fight and now we are not even able to fight a powerful warrior like you
 
 tum ko to yajyapurush narayan ke paas janaa chaiye
 They are the only ones capable of fighting you
 varun dev kii baat sunakar us daitya ne devarshi naarad ke paas jaakar narayan kaa pataa poocha
 Devarshi Narada told him that Narayan has taken the form of Varah at this time to take the earth out of the abyss
 is par hiranyaksh rasaatal main pahunch gaya
 There he saw Lord Varah on his molar bringing the earth
 us mahabali daitya ne varah bhagwaan se kaha, "are junglee pashu! tu jal main kahan se aa gaya he? murkh pashu! tu is prithvi ko kahan liye ja rahaa he? ise to brahma ji ne hamen de diya he
 Oh dear! You cannot take this earth from the abyss while i am there
 tu daitya or daanvon kaa shatru he isaliye aaj main tera vadh kar daaloonga
 " hiranyaksh ke in vachanon ko sun kar varah bhagwaan ko bahut krodh aayaa kintu prithvi ko vahaan chhod kar yuddh karnaa unhone uchit nahin samajha or unke katu vachanon ko sahan karte huye ve gajraj ke samaan sheeghra hi jal ke baahar aa gayi
 Chasing him, Hiranyaksha also came out and started saying, "hey coward! You don't feel ashamed to run away? Come and fight me
" " prithvi ko jal par uchit sthaan par rakhkar or apana uchit aadhaar pradaan kar bhagwaan varah daitya kii ore mude or kaha, "are gram singh ! ham to junglee pashu hai or tum jaise gram singhon ko hi dhundte rahete hai
 Now your death is dancing on your head
 " unke in vyang vachanon ko sunakar hiranyaksh un par jhapat padaa
 There was a fierce battle between Lord Varah and Hiranyaksha and in the end Hiranyaksha was killed by Lord Varaha
 bhagwaan varah ke vijay praapt karte hi brahma ji sahit samast devatagan akaash se pushp varsha kar unki stuti karne lage
 Brahma created Manu and Satrupa and commanded to create
 iske liye bhoomi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jise hiranyaksh naamak daitya lekar sagar ke bheetar bhu devi ko apana takiya bana kar soya tha tathaa devataaon ke dar se vishtha kaa gheraa bana rakhaa tha
 Manu showed water only to Satarupa, about whom Brahma told him that Brahma thought that not all the gods go to the Vistha, there is only a boar who can go near the Vistha
 bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhyaan kiya or apane nasika se varah narayan ko janm diya, prithvi ko upar laane kii ajna di
 The Varaha lord descended into the sea and killed Hiranyaksha and freed the earth goddess

 AA Khan, the head of the ATS, who stormed the Lokhandwala complex on 16 November 1991, who carried out it with 400 armed policemen
 khatarnaak gangster maaya dolas unheen imaaraton main chipa baitha tha
 Since the film's main characters are focused on real people, their names have been subtly changed and based on the film's title it was described as "based on witness of the actual incident"
 film kaa pradarshan 25 may 2007 main hua
 The film's scenes begin with a sweep and wipe scene of the dried blood and scattered cartridges surrounding the Lokhandwala complex's Swati building
 tivien reporter mita mattu yah khabar detii he ki police apane vishaal skiwad ke saath bina kisi ghoshnaa ke behad shant samajhe janevaale rihaayshi kshetra main dakhlandji kar 3000 chakra se zyada kii goliyaan or barood chalaai hai
 The film's second stance turns to the office of former Chief Justice Dhingra, a private prosecutor where he interviews the top members of the Mumbai Encounter squad present: Additional Police Commissioner Shamsher S
 Khan, Inspector Kaviraj Patil and Police Constable Javed Sheikh
 film kaa mukhya samayrekha bhi inhen teen afasaron dwaara dhingra ke saakshaatkaar ke saath gujarata he; jahaan ve afasaron jawaab dhingra ke sawaalon par dete hai, jiske saath film main kai flash back main uparokt ghatnaon kaa zikr chalata he
 Dhingra asks him about this encounter squad
 khan bataate hai ki unhone mumbai police vibhaag se kai behtareen 27 karmiyon or afasaron ko chunaa hai
 He got the idea of forming this squad from the American, LAPD SWAT team facing crime
 isi ke saath film ke flash back main khan ko un aadamiyon ke chayan or unhen shaareerik evam maansik str par prakhar laayak "chust, kaabil or ghaatak" banane hetu prashikshan diya jaataa he
 Dhingra is rarely impressed by him: he also points to the case that if Khan believes in "shoots to kill" then there will be no difference between him and the gangsters he wants to eliminate
 maamla tab tool pakadaney lagata he jab khan nishandehi ke liye, vah apane jasuson or khabariyon ke network ke jariye, maaya ke vibhinn aapraadhik or sambhawatah aatanki gatividhiyon par nigaraanee karata he
 At the same time, with Maya's ambitions, he also fulfills his eyes, he begins to wish that he would occupy the whole of Mumbai once he gets rid of the rulers in Dubai
 khan kii aties kaa makasad ab maaya or bhua ko hataane par dhyaan rahata he, jiske saath hi chuhe-billi kaa khatarnaak khel shuru ho jaataa he jahaan iske hamale se bachane kii surat najar nahin aati he lekin is ranneeti main koshish rahati hai dushman ko kisi bhi tarah laachaar kiya jaae
 Khan then meets the families of those criminals and advises their accused to surrender without any hesitation
 iske badale main, maaya or uske aadmi bhi un pulicekarmiyon ke nijee maamle main jabaran dakhlandji kar unase "mulaakaat" karte hai
 Maya meets Khan at the restaurant when he engages in food with his family
 maaya fouran khan ko kahata he: "yah maamla tumhaare aadamiyon or mere bich kaa he
 Do not bring the family in the middle
 " khan bhi uske baton par chot dekar kahata he: "main bhi chahta tha ki tum khud aakar is maamle ko saaf karo
 But the time has come whether this issue will end on the noose or with gunfire
 " At the same time, Maya's anger grows when the famous urban builder Wadhwani expels her
 maaya use 4 karod kii protection mani dene kii dhamkee detaa he; vadhvani yah maamla dubai tak pahunchaata he
 Maya then leads a boy with a nose-like, thick-skinned boy in front of Wadhwani
 vadhvani ke shikaayat karte, big baas tab maaya ko fouran baccha lautaane ko kahata he
 Maya then asks for a very high demand from the boss and tells about ruling the entire Mumbai together
 film ke kai kirdaaron ke tarah unke nijee jivan kaa bhi khulaasa karti he
 Khan's wife Rohini also expresses her inability to live with him due to not being able to give importance to her own family
 or talaak kii arji karti he

 At the same time, his criminal partner Phattu and R
C
 They also struggle with their difficulties
 phir navambar 1991 kaa vah nirnaayak din aa hi jaataa he
 Of the five criminals, Maya and Buva hide themselves in the flat of Swati Building in Lokhandwala, along with the kidnapped Wadhwani's child, to save themselves the most
 khan ko mili gupt jaankaree se us ilaake kii jaankaree maaloom ho jaati he
 Khan sieges the area with his armed soldiers and officers
 vah vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko sakht hidaayat detaa he ki ve ghar bheetar rahen or khidakiyon kii kundiyaan band kar len
 Then a long and fierce battle of guns and bullets erupts
 flats main maujuud buvaa raaket propeled graned laanch kar bahut nuksaan pahunchaata he or bhaagane kii koshish karata he
 But due to the heavy firing by the police, their morale is broken, and all the five criminals are killed
 is bheeshan jang main imaarat ko kaaphi kshati pahunchati he: film ke drishyon main sidhiyon, dalanon or vibhinn nagarikon ke gharon ko lagbhag tabah kar detii he
 Reporter Mita Mattu broadcasts the entire incident live
 is antim nirnay main, dhingra kaa paksh nakaaratmak rahata he or khan tathaa aties ke is karrwai kii apwaad qaraar karte he
 In view of all the press reports in the court and the complaints of the citizens, Khan accuses Khan of contempt for breaching the peace of a residential area with this unilateral decision and his uniquely armed squads
 khan or unki aties par dandaneey nirnay chalanaa hi tha
 But when Dhingra reveals his advocacy on the defense, in this surprising turn, he offers an unconventional argument in defense
 film ke ant main khan evam unke aties daste ko adaalat se bari hote dikhaaya jaataa he

 The Vaishnavi movement gave rise to provincial literature
 shankar dev ne apni lambii jivan-yatra main is andolan ko swarchit kavy, natya va geeton se jivit rakhaa
 The history of Assamese elegant and written literature is divided into five periods: adhyatan uplabdh saamagree ke aadhaar par hem saraswati or hariver wipro asamiya ke praarambhik kavi maane ja sakate hai
 Hem Saraswati's "prahladcharitra" is considered the first written text of Assamese
 ye donon kavi kamataatur ke shaasha durlainarayan ke ashrith the
 There was also a third famous poet Kabiratna Saraswati, who wrote "jayadrathavadha"
 parantu vaishnavapoorvakaal ke sabase prasiddh kavi madhav kandali hue, jinhone raja mahamaniky ke aashray main rahakar apni rachanaayen kin
 Madhava Kandali's translation of the Ramayana gained special fame
 sanskrit shabdasmooh ko asamiya main roopanrit karnaa kavi kii vishesh kala thi
 Some of the other lyrical works of this period are notable
 in rachanaaon main tatkaaleen lokmanas vishesh rup se pratifalit hua
 Legislations of Tantra Mantra, Mansapooja etc
 have become more popular in the works of this class
 is kaal kii purvavarti rachanaaon main vishnu se sambhddha kuch devataaon ko mahatv diya gaya tha
 But later, the worship of Vishnu was particularly revered
 sthiti ke is parivartan main asamiya ke mahaan kavi or dharmasudharak shankardev i
 kaa yoga basase adhik tha
 Most of Shankaradeva's compositions are based on Bhagavat Purana and his view is called Bhagavati Dharma
 asamiya janajivan or samskruti ko uske vishisht rup main dhaalane kaa shrey shankardev ko hi diya jaataa he
 Therefore some critics do not want to restrict his personality as a poet only
 ve mulat: unhen dharmik sudhaarak ke rup main maanate hai
 Sri Krishna was the main refuge of Shankardev's devotion
 unki lagbhag 30 rachanaayen hai, jinamein se "kirtanghosh" unki sarvotkrisht kriti he
 Sankardev is also the initiator of the famous drama form of Assamese literature "ankiya Nataka"
 unke naatakon main gadhy or padya kaa baraabar mishran miltaa he
 Maithili's influence on the language of these plays
 "ankiya naatak" ke padyansh ko "vargit" kaha jaataa he, jisaki bhashaa pramukhat: brajabuli he

 Apart from being a poet, he was also a Sanskrit scholar, playwright, musician and preacher
 "namghosha" inaki vishisht kriti he
 "chordhara" is the more famous composition in Shankardev's plays

 "buranji" is basically a tie word, meaning "storehouse of unknown stories"
 in buranjiyon ke madhyam se assam pradesh ke madhyayug kaa kaaphi vyavasthit itihaas uplabdh he
 The names of Kamrup Buranji, Kachari Buranji, Ahom Buranji, Jayanti Buranji, Beliyar Buranji are relatively more famous under Buranji literature

 In the era of useful literature, science related texts like astrology, mathematics, medicine etc
 were created
 kala tathaa nrity vishyak pustaken bhi likhi gayi
 The tendency towards secularism, nurtured by royalty, can be clearly seen at the root of all this versatile literature
 is kaal main hindi ke do sufi kaavyon ke kathankon ke aadhaar par do asamiya kavy likhe gaye
 But basically this era is the development of prose

 1826 AD is the date of commencement of English rule in Assam

 Assamese writers were influenced by the study of English and European literature in the era of English rule
 kuch paashchaatya adarsh bangala ke madhyam se bhi apanaae gaye
 The name of Anandaram Tekial Phukan is the most important of the early writers of this era

 jonaki samudaay ke samanaantar jin gadhylekhakon ne sahityasrujan kiya unamem se venudhar rajkhova tathaa sharachchandra goswami ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai

 asamiya sahitya ke aadhunik kaal main patr patrikaon kaa madhyam bhi kaaphi prachlit hua
 Of these, "arunodaya", "jonaki", "boli", "aavahana", "jayanti", and "pachhova" have done quite useful work in various fields
 nae prakaar kaa sahityasrujan pramukhat: "ramadhenu" ko centre banaakar hua he
 In this era, western effects have come in more healthy and balanced form
 iliyat tathaa unke sahyogi angreji kaviyon se nae asamiya lekhakon ko pramukhat: prerana mili he
 The trend of these new experiments can be seen not only in poetry, but also in narrative and drama
 samajashastreey tathaa manovaigyanik donon hi prakaar kii samasyaon kaa nae lekhakon ne uthaaya he
 Their craft uses are also no less important

 These songs are associated with religious occasions, pickles and rituals
 kuch lokgaathaon main rajkumaar nayakon ke aakhyaan bhi milte hai
 The importance of philosophical post in this period before the emergence of elegant literature is extraordinary
 uske kathanon ko vedavaky sangya di gai he
 This tradition of postal texts goes as far as Bengal and Bihar
 assam ke praaia: prayek parivaar main kuch samay purv tak in dakvachanon kaa ek hastlikhit sankalan rahata tha
 Assam's ancient name "kamarupa" appears that there has been a tradition of tantra mantra since very ancient times
 in guhyacharon se sambhddha anek prakaar ke mantra milte hai jinase bhashaa tathaa sahitya vishyak praarambhik avasthaa kaa kuch parichay miltaa he
 Many of the Siddhas, the authors of "chariyapad", are said to have a very close relationship with Kamrup, which seems quite natural given the Tantric tradition of this region

 koi bhi sangeetkaar is shart ke kaaran saamne nahin aayaa parantu baiju baavaraa ne yah bidaa uthaaya tathaa apane guru haridas se ajna praapt kar sangeet pratiyogita main bhaag liya
 Baiju eventually lost in this competition, but Akbar later delighted and proposed to keep Baiju in his court
 lekin akbar ke darbar ke itihaaskaar abul fazal or aurangzeb ke darbar ke itihaaskaar faqirullah ke anusaar baiju ne tansen ko pratiyogita main haraaya tha or tansen ne baiju ke pair chhukar apane praanon kii bheekh maangi thi
 Baiju forgave Tansen and went back to Gwalior himself
 baiju baavaraa akbar ke darbar main rahane ke bajaay gwalior aa gaye, jahaan unhen soochna mili ki unke guru haridas samadhisth hone vaale hai
 He reached Vrindavan for the last darshan of his Guru and after visiting him, faced various disasters and reached the last stop of his life at Srinagar, the capital of the King of Kashmir
 us samay unka shishy gopal nayak vahaan darbari gayak tha
 Fatehal Baiju asked the gatekeeper to convey the information of his arrival to Gopaldas, then the gatekeeper replied bluntly that his master had no master
 yah sunakar baiju ko kaafii aghat pahunchaa or ve srinagar ke ek mandir main pahunchakar raag dhrupad kaa gayan karne lage
 Hearing Baiju's excellent singing, a large crowd started to thrive
 jab baiju kii khabar kashmir naresh ke paas pahunchi, to ve swayan bhi vahaan aae tathaa baiju kaa swaagat kar apane darbar main le aae
 The King of Kashmir requested Baiju to re-impart music education to Gopaldas
 raja kii ajna se unhone gopal ko punah sangeet shiksha dekar nipun kiya
 According to another legend, Gopal was the beloved disciple of the hero Baiju
 vah apni patni prabhaa ke saath baiju ko chhod jeevika ke liye kahin or chalaa gaya jiske aghat se baiju apana aapa kho baitha or uskaa naam baiju baavaraa pad gaya
 Gopal Nayak was appointed a singer in the court of the King of Kashmir and there he made it popular that he was self-educated and was not blessed by any guru
 yah sun baiju fatehaal srinagar pahunchaa or apane gayan se sabko mantrmugdh kar diya lekin gopal nayak ne apane guru ko pahchaanane se manaa kar diya
 Ahat Baiju went to a temple and started singing and there was a huge crowd and when the King of Kashmir came to know about this, the King of Kashmir sent Baiju to his court and got Baiju and Gopal to have a music competition
 baiju ko pehle gane kaa mauka mila or gopal ko uskaa uttar dena tha
 Baiju sang the raga Bhimpalasi due to which the stones started melting
 gopal ne uttar main gaaya lekin jeet na paaya
 As per the condition of the competition, the loser was to be given death penalty but Baiju Bawra requested the king to save Gopal from death penalty
 lekin apni morrkhtaa ke kaaran gopal ko apni jaan se haath ganvaana padaa
 His last miracle was done by his daughter Meera on the banks of Sutlej
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki dah sanskaar ke baad jab gopal kii haddiyon ko nadi main phenkaa gaya to vah dub gayin
 According to the legend, when Gopal's widow Prabha requested Baiju to bring those bones, Baiju taught Gopal's daughter Meera a new version of Raga Malhar, which she learned after a week when Meera in front of the crowd on the banks of the Sutlej When he sang, Gopal's bones started coming along the river
 us samay ke baad se us raag ko mira kii malhaar kaa naam diya gaya
 After this episode, the sad Baiju returned to Chanderi
 baiju kaa 71 varsh kii aayu main miyadi bukaar ke kaaran chanderi main san 1613 i

" Ajivik or 'aajeevak', was the first atheist and materialist sect developed on Indian soil in the ancient philosophical tradition of the world
 bhartiya darshan or itihaas ke adhyetaon ke anusaar aajeevak sampradaay kii sthapana makali gosaal ne kii thi
 Before the rise of the 24th Jain Tirthankara Mahavir and Mahatma Buddha in the 5th century BC, it was the most influential philosophy prevalent on the Indian territory
 vidwaanon ne aajeevak sampradaay ke darshan ko ‘niyatwaad’ ke rup main chinhit kiya he
 It is believed that Ajivik Shramana lay naked and roamed like a family
 ishwar, punarjanm or karm yani karmkand main unka vishwaas nahin tha
 The influence of the Ajivak sect on the erstwhile populace and the state seems to reflect the fact that Ashoka and his grandson Dasharatha built seven caves in the equal hills of Jehanabad Dasharatha in Bihar and dedicated them to the livelihoods
 teesri shatabdi isapurv main kisi bhartiya raja dwaara dharmavishesh ke liye nirmit kiye gaye aise kisi drushtaant kaa vivaran itihaas main nahin miltaa
 There has been controversy among scholars about the meaning of the word Ajivik, but this meaning has been particularly accepted by the class of Shramans who have views about Ajivik
 yah mana jaataa he ki vaidic manyataon ke virodh main jin anek shraman sampradaayon kaa utthan buddhapurvakaal main hua unamem aajeevik sampradaay sabase lokapriy or pramukh tha
 Historians have undeniably considered the Aivak sect to be the world's first organized sect in the philosophical-religious tradition
 kyonki aajeevakon se pehle kisi or sangathit darshanik parampara kaa koi sakshya nahin miltaa he
 Mahavira and Buddha were definitely contemporaries of Makkhali Gosal, but their Jain and Buddhist philosophy developed and expanded only after the livelihood philosophy
 chunki aajeevak sampradaay kaa pramanik sahitya uplabdh nahin he, isliye aajeevakon ke darshan or itihaas sambandhi jaankaree ke liye itihaaskaar puri tarah se buddha or jain sahitya tathaa mauryayugin shilalekhon par nirbhar rahe hai
 Despite this, there is no consensus among its historians that the influence and practice of this sect was widespread throughout India until the first century
 vidwaanon kaa spasht mat he ki baad main viksit or lokapriy hue jain or buddha darshan donon iske prabhaav se mukt nahin hai
 By the way, the Charvak philosophy is also the product of the atheist and materialistic 'school' of the Aajeevak sect
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki madhyakaal main is sampradaay ne apana parthaky kho diya
 The Jain and Buddhist scriptures mention Makkhali Gosal as the Tirthankara of Ajivikas, declaring him to be a strong opponent of Buddha and Mahavira
 jain-buddha shastron se hi hamen yah pataa chalata he ki aajeevak mat ko suvyavasthit va sangathit rup dene tathaa use lokapriy banane vaale ekmaatr tirthankar makali gosaal the
 Gosal was the son of Mankh, who made a living by giving religious-moral teachings through Chitra
 unki mata kaa naam bhadraa tha
 Makkhali was born in Goshala
 isi se unke naam ke saath ‘gosaal’ judaa
 According to Jain tradition, 'makkhali' is made of 'mankh'
 mankh ek aisa samudaay tha jiske sadsy chaaran yaa bhaat jaisaa jivan yaapan karte the
 According to Jain literature, Makkhali used to wander with an idol in his hand
 isiilie jainon or baudhon ne unhen ‘macaliputt goshaal’ kaha he
 In ancient texts, they have also been called 'muskari Goshal' because the livelihood Shramana used to hold 'muskari' in hand
 gosaal swayan ko choubeesvaan tirthankar kehete the
 Gosal came from the Shramana tradition because many of his earlier Ajivikas are mentioned in jain-buddhist texts
 makali se purv kiss sankichch or nandavachh naamak do pramukh aajeevikon ke naam milte hai
 In the fifth motive of the eighth century of Bhagwati Sutra, Mahavira has also named 12 Ajivikas which are as follows: Tal, Talpalamb, Uvih, Sanvih, Avvih, Udaya, Namudaya, Omudaya, Anuvalaya, Sankhuvalaya, Aayampul and Kairya
 jainagam bhagwati ke anusaar 'goshaalak nimitt-shaastra ke bhi abhyaasi the
 He was skilled and well-versed in telling the future about loss-profit, happiness-sorrow and life and death
 aajeevak log apni is vidya bal se aajeevika chalaaya karte the
 That is why in Jain scriptures, this view has been called livelier and sexier
 ' “in Jain proceeds Makkhali Goshal is called Gosal Mankhaliputt
 sanskrit main use hi muscari goshalputra kaha gaya he
 
 muscari yaa makali yaa mankhali kaa darshan suvidit tha
 In the Mahabharata, there is only a rendering of fatalism in the story of Manki Rishi
 
 However, the original approach of the sage Nirveda or as Patanjali has said, was peace, that is, do not do anything with your hands and feet
 yah paninevaad kaa thik ulta tha
 There were many recommendations regarding the pure name of Mankhali Gosal
 jain praakrit rup mankhali tha
 According to the Bhagwati sutra, Gosal Mankh was the son of a cognate monk
 shaanti-parv kaa manki nishchayroop se mankhali kaa hi doosraa rup he
 " makali gosaal ke samay main unke alaava purna kassap, ajit keshakambali, sanjay weltthiputt or pukud katyayan chaar pramukh shraman acharya the

 Scholars of philosophy and history have called livelihood philosophy as 'fatalism'
 aajeevikon ke anusaar sansarchakr niyat he, vah apane kram main hi puraa hota he or muktilabh karata he
 Livelihood did not believe in effort and might
 unke anusaar manushya kii sabhi avasthaaen niyati ke adheen he
 We find a clear reference to the philosophy of Ajivikas in the 'samnfalsutra Sutta' of the 'digh-navyas'
 jab ashaantchitt ajatshatru apane sanshay ko lekar gautam buddha se milte hai or chah bhautikwaadi darshanikon ke maton kaa sankshipt varnan karte hai
 Ajatashatru tells Gautama Buddha, 'on the next day i went to Makkhali Gosal
 vahaan kushalakshem poochne ke pashchaat poocha, ‘maharaj, jis prakaar duusare shilpon kaa laabh vyakti apane isi janm main praapt karata he, kya shramanya jivan kaa laabh bhi manushya isi janm main praapt kar saktaa he?’ makali gosaal jawaab main kehete hai, ‘ghatnaayen swatah ghatati hai
 They have no reason, nor any predetermined condition
 unke klesh or shuddhi kaa koi hetu nahin he
 There is also no suffix

 jaise soot kii gend phenkane par uchhalkar girti he or phir shant ho jaati he
 Similarly, wise and foolish people end their misery by going through worldly deeds
 ’ According to the Majjhim Nikaya, the ethics of Ajivikas was - 'they did not take food from the couple who ate together, from the woman who was pregnant and with the milk
 jahaan aahaar kam ho or ghar ke baahar kutta bhookha khadaa ho, vahaan se bhi aahaar nahin lete the
 Always left two houses, three houses or seven houses and took alms
 ‘panini ne 3 tarah ke darshanikon kii charchaa kii he- aastik, naastik or dishtivaadee 
 Makkhali Gosal was a philanthropist

 ' The commentator Acharya Mahapragya has written about the livelihood philosophy on the basis of several evidences - "other evidence also indicates that Panini was introduced to the livelihood philosophy of Muskari
 aastik, naastik, dishtik teen prakaar ke darshanikon kaa ullekh he
 Theists were those who have been called Issar Karanvadis in Buddhist texts who believed that this Jagatu is the creation of God
 
 The philanthropic philosopher of the Pali texts was an atheist of the philosopher Panini
 isamen keshakambali ke natthik dithi anuyaayi pradhan the
 
 yahi lokayat drushtikon tha jise kath upanishad main kaha he-ayan loko na parah iti maani
 The third philosopher of Panini was the Daishtikas or the fatalists of Makkhali who established the divine by denying effort or action
 " According to Jainagam Bhagwati, Aajeevak Shramana would have served his parents
 gooler, bad, ber, anjir evam pilankhu fal kaa seven nahin karte
 Do not stall the bulls

 ' itihaaskaaron ne aajeevikon ke darshan or itihaas par baat karte hue hameshaa yah kaha he ki aajeevak koun the? unka darshan kya tha? yah sab dwitiyak or virdohi sroton par aadhaarit he

 isliye jain-buddha granthon ke aadhaar par aajeevikon ke darshan ko ‘niyatwaad’ ‘akarmanyawad’ yaa ‘bhagyavaad’ maan lenaa gambhir bhul hogi
 Ajivik people were shramana while doing their livelihood or profession, hence they cannot be called as opposed to 'karma' in any case

 The tribal philosophy tradition holds that everything is subject to nature-creation

 Due to lack of understanding of tribal philosophy, the scholars of philosophy and history accepted the philosophy of Ajivikas as fatalism

 gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar
 ise pope gregory ne lagu kiya tha
 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa

 dandiganpudi main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Gyanamimamsa is a branch of philosophy
 gyanamimasaa ne aadhunik kaal main vichaarkon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The goal of philosophy is to understand the nature of truth
 sadiyon se vichaarak yah khoj karte rahe hai, parantu kisi nishchit nishkarsh se ab bhi utane hi dur prathit hote hai, jitna pehle the
 In the modern period, Dekart came to notice that the reason for the failure of the effort is that philosophers have been carrying on some advance imaginations
 darshanashastra ko ganit kii nischitata tabhi praapt ho sakati he, jab yah kisi dharna ko, jo swat:siddh nahin, pramanit kiye bina na maane
 He started with widespread skepticism
 uski apni chetana use aisi vastu dikhaai di, jiske astitv main andeh hi nahin ho saktaa : andeh to apane aap chetana kaa ek aakaar yaa swaroop he
 On this foundation he, in his view, proved the existence of the divine and the creation
 dekart kii vivechan-vidhi nai thi, parantu purvajon kii tarah uskaa anuraag bhi tatvagyan main hi tha
 John Locke chose a new route for himself
 sadiyon se sat ke vishay main vivaad hota rahaa he
 First, it is necessary to know how far our knowledge reaches
 isi se ye prashn bhi jude the ki gyaan kya he or kaise praapt hota he
 The philosophers of the continent of Europe sought to replicate the philosophy of mathematics, Locke turned his attention to psychology and composed an "essay on human intelligence"
 yah ugantkaari pustak siddh hui, ise anubhavvaad kaa muladhar samajha jaataa he
 George Berkeley advanced empiricism by writing the rules of "anthropology" in Locke's criticism, and David Hume took it to the extreme in "human nature"
 hum ke vichaaron kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki unhone kaant ke "aalochanavaad" ke liye maarg khol diya
 Kant made Gyanamimamsa the central question of philosophy
 kintu pashchim main gyanamimasaa ko uchit pad prapt karne main badi der lagi
 It was never ignored in India
 gautam ke nyaysutron main pehle sutara main hi 16 vichaarvishyon kaa varnan hua he, jiske yatharth gyaan se ni:shreyas kii prapti hoti he
 The first two subjects of these are "proof" and "theorem"
 ye donon gyanamimasaa or gyey tatv hi hai
 It is noteworthy that "proof" has been given first place in both of them
 gyaan, gyaata or gyey kaa sambandh he
 Dekart started by analyzing his experience, but man is a social animal, his experience does not develop into a vacuum
 darshanashastra kaa itihaas vadavivaad kii katha he
 Plato expressed his opinion in dialogues
 samvaad main ek se adhik chetnaaon kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In Jnanamimamsa, the subject of deliberation becomes not a personal consciousness, but a social consciousness
 gyaan kaa apana astitv to asandigdh he parantu isamen nimnlikhit sweekrutiyaan bhi nihit hoti hai- A
 Knowledge is different from knowledge, which is knowledge
 kha
 gyaan ek se adhik gyaataaon ke sansarg kaa fal he
 C
 The subject of knowledge is different from knowledge
 prayek dharna satya hone kaa daawa karti he
 But epistemology cannot accept this claim without proper investigation
 ham abhi in dharanaon kii pariksha karenge, parantu pehle gyaan ke swaroop par kuch kahana aavashyak he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- gyaan kaa swaroop : sammati, vishwaas or gyaan jab ham kisi dharna ko sunate hai yaa uskaa chintan karte hai to us sabandh main hamaari vritti is prakaar kii hoti he - There are several levels of acceptance
 adham str par samayik sweekruti he, ise sammati kehete hai
 This acceptance is not certified, if we have to renounce it, we have no disgust
 sammati ke saath tej or sajivta prabal hoti he
 In order to live in religious beliefs, human beings bear all kinds of suffering
 vishwaas or sammati donon vaiyaktik kritiyaan hai, gyaan main yah parisemen nahin hota
 i do not say that there are two and two fours in my committee, nor do i say that according to my belief, if both a and b are equal to c then they are also equal to each other
 ye to aise tathy hai, jinhen prayek buddhivant praani ko avashya maananaa hota he sanmatiyo main bhed hota he gyaan sabake liye ek he
 In the knowledge, the subjectivity of acceptance takes the place of objectivity
 anubhavvaad ke anusaar, gyansaamagree ke do hi bhaag hai -- prabhaav or unke bimb
 There is no knowledge of these for matter
 hum ne kaha ki jis tarah bhautik padaarth gunsamooh ke atirikt kuch nahin, usee tarah anbhavi anubhavon ke samooh ke atirikt kuch nahin
 There is a distinction between these two groups - all the properties of the clan exist together, the conscious states of consciousness appear one after the other
 chetana shrenee yaa pankti he or kisi pankti ko apane aap pankti hone kaa bodh nahin ho saktaa
 There is no place for remembrance in the interpretation of the heart; As William James said, empiricism requires memory
 hum ko gyaata gyansaamagree main nahin mila; vah vahaan mil hi nahin saktaa tha
 The question for empiricism was - what does experience tell? Back Kant asked - How does experience become? Experience cannot exist without the action of the experienced
 manushya saamaajik praani he; hamaara sara jivan or manushyon ke saath vyateet hota he
 Pursuit is a widespread acceptance
 mimasaa ke liye prashn yah he ki is sweekruti kii sthiti drudh vishwaas kii sthiti he yaa gyaan kii? is vishay main swapn andeh kaa kaaran he
 In a dream, i seem to hear; Interaction with other humans also appears to occur
 kya jaagran or swapn kaa bhi swapn kii pratiti to nahin? ahamvaad ke anusaar sari satta baari kalpana hi he
 Our social life is a refutation of egoism, but the question is only in relation to social life - is this life not just faith? There is no evidence against egoism that can be called unbroken
 jab ham aise andeh se grast hote hai to, jaisaa hum ne kaha he, thode samay ke baad ham apane aapako thakaa pate hai or hamaara dhyaan vivash hokar duniya kii ore phirata he, jisamen bhautik padaarth bhi hai or chetan praani bhi
 When intellect does not work, nature helps us
 anubhavvaad ke anusaar sara gyaan ant main prabhaavon or unke chitron se banataa he
 In effect one can distinguish virtue and materialism; In the picture there is a distinction between reflection and suffix
 prayek gyanendriya kisi vishesh gun kaa charichay detii he -- aankh rup kaa, kaan shabd kaa, naak gandh kaa
 Objectivity is achieved by the coordination of these qualities
 ise pratibodh yaa pratyaksh bhi kehete hai
 In such a sense the subject of knowledge is outside the knower; Reflections and suffixes occur inside
 yah baahar or andar kaa bhed kalpana maatr he yaa tathy he, gyanamimasaa main yah pramukh prashn rahaa he
 No other question in Jnanamimansa has attracted as much attention as the Enlightenment or direct knowledge has attracted
 sankhya darshan ke anusaar pratyaksh ke do pramukh chihn hai -- Direct senses and subject interaction result
 pratyaksh main chitt vishay ke aakaar ko grahan kar letaa he
 This means that direct knowledge is not imaginable and there is no misconception in it
 yah to spasht hi he ki hamaare paas pratyaksh se adhik vishwast gyaan nahin, parantu prashn yah he ki vishayi or vishay main sidhaa sampark ho bhi saktaa he yaa nahin
 If such contact occurs, how is the confusion entered? There is some difference between subject and subject
 is antar kii dasha hamaare bodh ko prabhavit karti he
 The trees of the forest do not look green from afar, because along with their color, the color of the air falling in the middle is also found
 phir, hamaari indriya kii avasthaa bhi ek si nahin rahati, kaan kaa rogi padaarthon ko pilaa dekhtaa he
 Some thinkers say that we do not look at external substances, look at their pictures, cannot say with certainty about these pictures that they correspond to external substances; There is always a possibility of confusion here
 vastavvaad ke do rup hai -- saakshatatmak vastavvaad or pratibimbaatmak vastavvaad
 In the first form, the existence of the illusion becomes a problem, in the second form true knowledge is not solved
 vigyaanavaad andar or baahar ke bhed ko samaapt kar detaa he
 Its seed was only in the thoughts of John Locke
 usne kaha ki dravya kaa pratyay aspasht he
 He also said that the main qualities of physical substances are present in them, but the secondary qualities are the results which are expressed in our mind by the trauma of the principal qualities
 barkale ne kaha ki jo yuktiyaan apradhan gunon ke vastugat astitv ke viruddh di jaati hai, vahi pradhan gunon ke viruddh di jaati he
 There is nothing outside, the question of whether its perception is clear or unclear has become a suffix
 indriyadutt bahya padaarthon ke gun nahin, na hi ye maansik avasthaaen hai
 These are different from the knower, beyond him and he has an independent existence
 rassla ke anusaar, "indriyagrahyon" ke samooh vidyaman hai, inke kuch ansh gruhit ho jate hai
 Our understanding is true knowledge, but partial knowledge
 kaant ne apni vikhyath pustak "shuddh buddhi kii samalochna" ko in shabdon ke saath aarambh kiya -- "there can be no doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience
 kyonki yah kaise sambhav he ki bodh shakti kuch karne lage, sivaay iske ki hamaari indriyon ko prabhavit karanevaale padaarth ise yah kshamta den
 But although all our knowledge begins with experience, this does not conclude that all knowledge is the result of experience
 kaant ne anubhav kii banaavat main buddhi ke bhagdan par bal diya
 Even doing this, he said in the beginning that our thoughts cannot go beyond the world of revelations
 peeche usne anushilak buddhi or vyaavhaarik buddhi main bhed kiya or kaha ki anushilak buddhi gyaan detii he, parantu yah gyaan prakatano kii duniya se pare hi satta he
 a human being is a moral being
 niti kii maangen ye hai -- In India, distinction has been made between para lore and placenta and in both, the first is given a high position
 kuch vichaarak to aparaa vidya ko avidya hi kehete hai
 Plato gave the designation of consent to the perception of particular substances and placed the consent between knowledge and avidya
 prayek nirnay satya hone kaa daawa karata he
 What is the meaning of this claim? nirnay main do pratyayon yaa vichaaron ke sambandh kii baat kahi jaati he
 If this relationship also exists in the substances that are the origin of those ideas, then the decision is true
 satya kaa yah samaadhaan anurupatavaad kehalaata he
 Scientism calls the external world as fiction, according to which there is nothing but consciousness and conscious states in power
 yadi koi nirnay shesh gyaan se sansakt ho saktaa he, to vah satya he
 This is antisemitism
 aadhunikwaad kaal main america main vyavahaarwad kaa prasar hua he
 According to this, the notion that proves successful in practice is true
 satya koi sthaayee vastu nahin, jise ham dekhte hai; yah banataa he
 Actually there are two questions here - what is the nature of truth? What is the criterion for an assumption to be true? Conservatism answers the first question and Protestantism and Pragmatism the second question

 is ke baad sudur pashchim kumau kshetra or isaki rajdhani almora samet gorkha rajya main milaayaa gaya| child marriage? a practice that no one is unfamiliar with
 balvivaah keval bharat main hi nahin apitu sampoorn vishwa main hote aaen hai or samooche vishwa main bharat kaa balvivaah main doosraa sthaan hai
 40% of the world's children are married in the whole of India and 49% of the girls in India are married before the age of 18
 bharat main, bal vivaah kerala rajya, jo sabase adhik sakshartaa vaala rajya he, main ab bhi prachlan main he
 According to the UNICEF report, more child marriages occur in urban areas in rural areas of India
 aankado ke anusaar, bihar main sabase adhik 68% bal vivaah kii ghatnaayen hoti he jabaki himachal pradesh main sabase kam 9% bal vivaah hote he
 It is strange to think that in India which is emerging as a superpower in itself, even today there is such a evil life
 ek aisi kuriti jisamen do aparipakv logo ko jo aapas main bilkul anjaan hai unhen jabaran zindagi bhar saath rahane ke ek bandhan main baandh diya jaataa hai or ve do aparipakv balak shaayad puri zindagi bhar is kuriti se unke upar hue atyaachaar se ubhar nahin pate hai or baad main stithiyaan bilkul kharaab ho jaati hai or nattejey talaak or mrityu tak pahuch jate hai
 So was this practice in India since time immemorial? Or was it later introduced? And if brought later, what was the reason for this? yah pratha bharat main shuru se nahin thi
 It came into existence during the time of Delhi Sultanate when the monarchical practice was in vogue
 bhartiya bal vivaah ko ladakiyon ko videshi shaskaon se balaatkaar or apharan se bachaane ke liye ek hathiyaar ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Another reason for starting child marriage was that older elders had more desire to see their grandchildren, so they married children at a young age so that they could spend some time with their grandchildren before dying

 kya balvivaah ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya? Many people came forward in history to stop child marriage, the most prominent of which was Rajaram Mohan Roy, Keshab Chandra Sen who passed a bill by the British government called the Special Marriage Act, under which the age of girls for marriage is 18 and the age of girls is 14
 The year was fixed and it was banned
 phir bhi sudhaar na aane par baad main Child Marriage Restraint naamak bill paas kiya gaya isamen ladko kii umr badhaakar 21 varsh or ladakiyon kii umr badhaakar 18 varsh kar di gayi
 In independent India too, efforts were made by the government to stop it and some laws were made which improved them to some extent but it was not completely abolished
 sarkaar dwaara kuch kaanoon banaaye gaye hai jaise bal-vivaah nishedh adhinium 2006 jo astitv main hai
 The Act strictly prohibits child marriage instead of partially restricting it
 is kanoon ke antargat, bachche apni ichha se vayask hone ke do saal ke andar apane bal vivaah ko avaidh ghoshit kar sakate he
 But this law does not apply to Muslims, which is the biggest drawback of this law
 bal vivaah ko rokane hetu upaay? There may be some measures to prevent kindergarten like- 1

 Brahmi is an ancient script from which many Asian scripts have developed
 devanagari sahit anya dakshin asian, dakshin-purv asian, tibeti tathaa kuch logon ke anusaar korian lipi kaa vikaas bhi isi se hua tha
 The Brahmi script has a clear influence on the Ethiopian script
 abhi tak mana jaataa tha ki brahmi lipi kaa vikaas chauthi se teesri sadi isa purv main mauryon ne kiya tha, par bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan ke taaja utkhanan se pataa chalaa he ki tamilnadu or srilanka main yah 6thi sadi isa purv se hi vidyaman thi
 Many scholars believe that this script originated from the ancient Saraswati script, so it was already in use in India in the previous form
 saraswati lipi ke prachlan se hat jane ke baad praakrit bhashaa likhane ke liye brahmi lipi prachlan me ai
 There is not much written in Sanskrit in Brahmi script that can withstand the times
 praakrit / paali bhashaa me likhe gayi maury samraat ashok ke buddha upadesh aaj bhi surakshit he
 That is why the confusion perhaps developed by the Mauryans

 The names of scripts have been named in Lalitavistar, 'brahmalipi' has also got its name
 is lipi kaa sabase purana rup ashok ke shilalekhon main hi mila he
 In the ancient Buddhist text 'lalitavistar', the names of the 64 scripts that were taught to the Buddha are not named 'nagari script', 'brahmi script'
 'lalitvistar' kaa chini bhashaa main anuwaad i0 sa0 308 main hua tha
 Names of 18 scripts have been given in the 'pannavana Sutra' and 'samavayang Sutra' of the Jains, in which the first name is Bambhi

 The oldest script found in India is that of Ashoka, except in the territories across the Sindh river, it is found in India in the same form everywhere
 jis lipi main ashok ke lekh hai vah pracheen aaryo yaa brahmanon kii nikaali hui brahmi lipi he
 It is written in the 'prajnapanasutra' of the Jains that the script in which the language 'ardhamagadhi' is published is Brahmi script '
 ardhamagadhi bhashaa mathura or patliputra ke bich ke pradesh kii bhashaa he jisase hindi nikali he
 Therefore, the Brahmi script is the script of Middle Aryavarta, which progressively developed the script which was called 'nagari' behind
