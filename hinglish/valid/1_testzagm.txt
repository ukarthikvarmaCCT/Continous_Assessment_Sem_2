 hyperthyroidism yaa atigalagranthita vah shabd he jiskaa prayog galagranthi ke bheetar ke atisakriy utakon ke liye kiya jaataa he jisaki vajah se galagranthi hormone kaa aavashyaktaa se adhik utpaadan hone lagata he
 In this way, hyperthyroidism is a cause of thyrotoxicosis, ie the clinical condition of increased thyroid hormone in the blood
 yah gaur karne laayak baat he ki atigalagranthita or thyrotoxicosis samanarthak nahin hai
 For example, thyrotoxicosis may be due to ingestion of its exogenous thyroid hormone or inflammation of the thyroid gland, due to which it begins to secrete its thyroid hormone stores
 The thyroid hormone is important at the cellular level, affecting almost every type of tissue in the body
 jab avatu granthi bahut adhik maatra main hormone banane lagata he to sharir, urja kaa upyog maatra se adhik karne lagata he
 This is called hyper thyroidism or hyperactivity of the intact girth

 The thyroid gland is a small gland in the middle of a butterfly-shaped lower neck
 iskaa mul kaam hota he ki sharir ke upaapachay ko niyantrit kare
 To control metabolism, the thyroid makes hormones that tell the body's cells how much energy is to be used
 yadi avatugranthi sahi tareeke se kaam kare to santoshjanak dar par sharir ke upaapachay ke kaary ke liye aavashyak hormone kii sahi maatra bani rahegi
 As the hormone continues to be used, the thyroid continues to replace it
 avatugranthi, rakt kii dhara main hormone kii maatra ko pituitary granthi ko sanchalit karke niyantrit karata he
 When the pituitary gland, located in the middle of the skull under the brain, detects that the thyroid hormone is deficient or in excess, it adjusts its hormones and tells the thyroid what to do

 avatugranthi jivan bhar rahata he
 With its careful management, people suffering from thyroid gland can live their life in a healthy and normal manner
 atigalagranthita ke kai kaaran hote hai
 Mostly, the entire gland over-produces thyroid hormone
 ise grevs rog kaha jaataa he
 Generally, in rare cases, a single gland is responsible for excess hormone secretion, which is called the "hot" gland
 thyroditis bhi atigalagranthita paidaa kar sakati he
 In many clinical conditions, excess thyroid hormone is produced by the functioning thyroid tissue
 manushyon main iske pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai: High blood levels of thyroid hormones can occur for many other reasons: rakt main shlashmik granthi dwaara utpaadit thyroid-uttejan hormone )) ke str ko maapna vishisht rup se sandigdh atigalagranthita kaa praarambhik pareekshan he
 a low level of TSH typically indicates that the mucosa is obstructed or "directed" by the brain to cut stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to increased levels of T4 and / or T3 in the blood
 It seems to happen
 kabhi-kabhaar hi, ek nimna ti shlashmik kii praathmik vifaltaa, yaa anya beemaari ke kaaran shlashmik ke asthaayee avarodhan ko ingit karata he or isliye T4 or T3 kii jaanch tab bhi naidanik rup se upyogi he
 Measuring specific anti-thyroid-peroxidases such as anti-tsh-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease or per-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also contribute to the diagnosis
 rakt pareekshanon se atigalagranthita ke nidaan kii pushti hoti he, jo thyroid uttejan hormone str main kami or T4 tathaa T3 staron main vruddhi darshata he
 TSH is a hormone made by the mucous gland in the brain, which tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make
 jab thyroid hormone bahut adhik hota he, tab ti kam ho jaataa he
 Both radioactive iodine ingestion tests and thyroid scans characterize the cause of hyperthyroidism or enable radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism
 thyroid granthi dwaara avashoshit iodine kii maatra ko maapne ke liye udgrahan pareekshan ke dauraan khaali pet radiodharmee iodine injection kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa munh ke dwaara sharir main daalaa jaataa he
 People suffering from hyperthyroidism consume too much iodine
 udgrahan pareekshan ke silsile main vishisht rup se sanchalit thyroid scan chhaviyaan prastut karata he, jisase granthi kii ati-kriyasheeltaa kii drishy jaanch ho paati he
 Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test for characterization of this disease resulting from hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
 yah pareekshan pranali main vishisht rup se ek duusare se jude do pareekshan shaamil hai: ek iodine udgrahan pareekshan or ek gamma camere ke saath ek scan 
 udgrahan pareekshan main radiodharmee iodine kii ek khuraaq, vishisht rup se iodine-123 yaa 123I, ko prabhaav main laana shaamil he, jo thyroid rog ke naidanik adhyayan ke liye iodine kaa sabase upyukt samasthanik he
 I-123 is almost the ideal isotopic of iodine to produce images of thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer mutation

 Some patients may experience mild allergic reaction to clinical radioiodine and may be given antihistamines
 rogi aamtaur par 24 ghante baad radioiodine "udgrahan" kaa str waapas praapt kar letaa he, ise gale main bandhi ek dhaatu shalaka se jude upkaran se mapa jaataa he, jo thyroid se radiodharmita utsarjan ko maapta he
 This test takes 4 minutes, as long as the leverage by machine software is stored
 vishisht rup se, ek scan bhi kiya jaataa he, jahaan gamma camera se visham thyroid granthi kii chhaviyaan lee jaati hai; radiologist uskaa adhyayan karata he or chhaviyon kii jaanch karne ke baad udgrahan % kaa ullekh karte hue ek report taiyaar karata he or apni tippanee detaa he
 Hyperthyroid patients typically "ingest" a higher-than-normal level of radioiodine
 RAI udgrahan kaa saamaanya seemaa 10-30% se hai
 In addition to testing TSH levels, many doctors also test T3, Free T3, T4 and / or Free T4 for more detailed results

 See the complete table of common range limits of thyroid function in the thyroid gland article
 hyperthirodism ke kaaran nimnlikhit hai- Large and commonly accepted modalities for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans include the initial temporary use of suppressive thyrostatics treatment and possibly later permanent surgery or radioisotopic therapy
 sakriy thyroid kaary ke tahat sabhi raste kaaran ho sakate hai, jinhen aasaani se levothairoxin anupuran se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Thyrosthetics drugs inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole and methimazole and propylthurasil
 Thyrostatics is believed to inhibit the iodization of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and thereby inhibit the formation of tetra-iodothyronine
 thyroid granthi ke baahar bhi propylathuresil kaam karata he, sakriy rup T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko roktaa he
 Since thyroid tissue usually contains a large accumulation of thyroid hormones, it takes several weeks for thyrostatics to take effect and the dose often needs to be titrated over a period of months, as well as regular doctor care
 And blood tests have to be done to check the results
 praarambhik upachaar main praayah ek bahut hi ucch khuraaq kii jarurat hoti he, lekin agar lagaataar ek ucch khuraaq kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahe to rogiyon main avatu-alpakriyata ke lakshan viksit ho sakate hai
 This titer of dose is difficult to perform correctly, and is why the "barrier and substitution" method is sometimes adopted
 baadha va pratisthaapan upachaar main thyroid hormone ko puri tarah se band karne ke liye paryaapt maatra main thyrostetics liye jate hai, marij kaa ilaaj is tarah kiya jaataa he jaise ki use puri avatu-alpakriyata he
 Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremors, and anxiety, are mediated by an increase in beta adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces
 vishisht rup se ucch rakt chaap ke ilaaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale beta blowers is prakaar kii dawa he jo is prabhaav ko pratisantulit kar detii he, dhakdhaki ke samvedan se judi teevr dhadkan ko kam karti he or kampan tathaa vyagrata main kami laati he
 Thus, patients suffering from hyperthyroidism can often get immediate temporary relief, as long as the radioiodine test described above characterizes the hyperthyroidism and then more permanent treatment can begin
 dhyaan den ki ye dawaaen atigalagranthita yaa ilaaj nahin karaane kii vajah se iske dirghakaalik prabhaavon kaa koi ilaaj nahin karatin, balki ye keval sthiti ke lakshanon kaa ilaaj karti hai yaa unhen kam karti he
 Some minimal effects on thyroid hormone production, however, also come from propranolol — which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, which is determined by the different isopropyl substances of propranolol
 el-propranolol beta-avarodhan kaa kaaran he, isliye kampan, dhakdhaki, vyagrata or garmi asahansheeltaa jaise atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon kaa upachaar karata he
 D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thus providing some, albeit minimal, effects by blocking the conversion of T4 into T3
 anya beta blowers kaa istemaal keval atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Propranolol in the US and metoprolol in the UK are often used to enhance the treatment of hyperthyroid patients
 aakraamak radio samasthanik chikitsa ke kam upyog ke liye samay se pehle surgery ek vikalp he, lekin aise maamalon main tab bhi isaki jarurat padati he, jinamein thyroid granthi badi ho gayi ho or gardan kii banaavat par dabaav kaa kaaran ho, yaa atigalagranthita kaa aadharbhoot kaaran multah cancer-sambandhi ho
 Surgery is not widely used, as the most common forms of hyperthyroidism are most effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and as the removal of the parathyroid glands and cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve makes it difficult to swallow and cause a large Surgery may even lead to generalized staphylococcal infections
 kuch grevs rog ke marij, tathaapi, is yaa us kaaran se dawaaon ko bardaasht kar sakate hai, ve rogi jinhen iodine se allergy he, yaa jo rogi radioiodine se inkaar karte hai, ve shalya chikitsa kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 In addition, some surgeons believe that radioiodine treatment is unsafe for patients with abnormally large glands, or whose eyes are out of the cotter; There are fears that too high a dose of radioiodine 131 may increase the patient's symptoms
 iodine-131 radio samasthanik chikitsa main, ati sakriy thyroid granthi ke kaary ko sakhti ke saath rokane yaa ekadam se nasht karne ke liye ek baar ke liye radiodharmee iodine-131 munh ke jariye diya jaataa he 
 apadan kaarak upachaar ke liye is radiodharmee iodine ke samasthanik kaa prayog naidanik radioiodine kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee hota he, jiskaa jaivik arddh jivan 8-13 ghante hota he
 Iodine-131, which also eliminates beta particles that are far more harmful to tissues in a limited area, has a half-life of about 8 days
 jin rogiyon par pehali khuraaq kaa asar nahin hota, kabhi-kabhi unhen radio iodine kii atirikt, badi khuraaq di jaati he
 In this treatment, iodine-131 is taken up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, making the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive
 chunki thyroid koshikaon dwaara iodine ko badi saralata se uthaa liya jaataa he or ati-sakriy thyroid koshikaon dwaara or bhi adhik saralata se uthaaya jaataa he, so vinaash sthaneey str par hota he or is chikitsa ke vyapak dushprabhav nahin hote hai
 Radioiodine ablation has been in use for 50 years and the only major reason for not using it is pregnancy and breastfeeding
 Once the thyroid gland is made dormant, replacement hormone therapy can be easily given through the mouth daily to meet the body's requirement of thyroid hormone
 haalanki, ek visham adhyayan kii tippanee he ki atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine ilaaj ke baad cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi dekhi gayi
 The major benefit of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it has a much higher success rate than drug therapy
 radioiodine kii khuraaq ke chayan or ilaaj kiye ja rahe rog par nirbhar, atigalagranthita ke nishchit samaadhaan kii safalataa dar 75-100% par bhinn ho sakati he
 One major potential side effect of radioiodine in Graves' patients is the development of subcutaneous hyperactivity, which requires daily thyroid hormone treatment
 kabhi-kabhi, kuch rogiyon ko ek se adhik radiodharmee upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, yah rog ke prakaar, thyroid ke aakaar or di gayi praarambhik prashasit khuraaq par nirbhar he
 Many patients are saddened at first that they have to take thyroid hormone pill throughout their life
 Nevertheless, thyroid hormones are safe, cheap, and easy to swallow; And hormones are similar to the thyroid and are usually made by the thyroid itself; Generally, this therapy is extremely safe and very tolerable for most patients
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke parinamswaroop thyroid utak ke vinaash se, aksar kai dinon se lekar saptahon tak kii ek chalyman avadhi aati he jab radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad atigalagranthita ke lakshan vastav main or bighad sakate hai
 This is usually due to the release of thyroid hormone into the blood after radioactive iodine-generated destruction of thyroid cells containing thyroid hormones
 kuch rogiyon main, beta blowers jaise aushadhi upachaar is avadhi main upyogi ho sakate hai

 5500 BC Till, small tribes living in the Nile Valley evolved into a range of cultures, which shows their control over agriculture and animal husbandry and can be identified by their ceramics and personal items such as combs, bracelets and beads

 In Northern Egypt, Badari was followed by the Amarshan and Garjean cultures, which demonstrated many superior techniques

 In southern Egypt, the Nakada culture, similar to the Badari, dates back to 4000 BC
 Expansion began along the banks of the Nile River

 Over a period of about 1000 years, the Nakada culture evolved from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders had complete control over the people and resources of the Nile Valley

 During the late phase of the pre-dynastic period, the Nakada culture began to use written symbols that eventually evolved into a complete system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language

 He preferred to begin his official history with a king named "meni", who supposedly united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt
 The transformation into a unified state actually occurred more sequentially than the ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes

 3150 BC Around, in the early dynastic period, the First Dynastic pharaohs strengthened their control over Lower Egypt, establishing the capital in Memphis, from where they gained labor force and agriculture to the fertile delta region, as well as the profitable and important trade routes of the Levant

 The strong institution of governance developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize the state's control over land, labor, and the resources that were necessary for the survival and development of ancient Egyptian civilization

 The pharaohs also provided land to their morgue cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death
 By the end of the ancient empire, five centuries of these feudal practices gradually eroded the economic power of the pharaohs, now incapable of maintaining a vast centralized administration

 Along with these conditions, 2200 and 2150 BC
 The severe drought that eventually took place led to a 140-year famine and a period of conflict known as the First Intermediate Period
 pracheen rajvansh ke ant main misr kii kendra sarkaar ke dhahne ke baad, prashasan, desh kii arthvyavastha ko sthir karne yaa sahaara dene main asamarth tha
 Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and future food shortages and political disputes took the form of famine and small-scale civil war

 Freed from their loyalty to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
 2160 BC Till, the rulers of Herakleopolis held control of Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt
 jaise-jaise intef kii shakti main vruddhi hui or usne apana niyantran uttar kii ore badhaayaa, to donon pratidwandvi rajwanshon ke bich sangharsh anivaary ho gaya
 Around 2055 BC, the Theban forces, under the command of Nebhepetre Mantuhotep II, eventually defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers and reintegrated the two territories to begin an economic and cultural renaissance period, known as the Middle Kingdom
 madhya samrajya ke firoon ne desh kii samruddhi or sthirataa ko behaal kiya or is tarah kala, sahitya or vishaal imaaraton kii pariyojnaon ke punarutthan ko prerit kiya
 The successors of Mantuhotep II and his 11th descendant ruled from Thebes, but at the beginning of the 12th dynasty in 1985 BC
 Wazir Amenemhat I, around power, transferred the capital of the country to the city of Iztawi in Fayum
 From Ijtawi, the pharaohs of the 12th dynasty planned land reforms and irrigation with foresight to increase agricultural production in the region
 In addition, the army reclaimed areas of Nubia enriched by mines and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the East Delta to protect against foreign attack, called "walls-of-the-ruler" " where did it go
 sainya or raajnneetik suraksha or vishaal krishi or khanij sampada behaal karne ke baad, is desh kii aabaadi, kala or dharm kaa utkarsh hone laga
 In contrast to the ancient empire's elitist view of the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in the sense of personal piety and what might be called the democratization of rebirth, in which all people have a soul and after death in the communion of the gods They can be welcomed

 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asian settlers in the delta region to provide sufficient manpower for their particularly active mining and construction operations
 These ambitious activities of construction and mining, however, combined with the inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, made the economy tense and prompted a second intermediate period with a slow decline during the 13th and 14th dynasties

 Around 1650 BCE, as the power of the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom began to wane, Asian immigrants living in the city of Avaris in the Eastern Delta took control of the area and forced the central government to visit Thebes
 , Where pharaohs were treated as slaves and were expected to pay fees

 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic relations with their neighbors
 The military campaigns waged under the command of Thutmose i and his grandson Thutmose III spread the influence of the pharaohs to Syria and Nubia, which strengthened loyalty and gave them access to important imports such as brass and wood
 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom began a massive construction campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak
 He also constructed monuments in glorification of his achievements, both real and imaginary
 The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to justify her claim to the throne

 1279 BC Nearby, Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne and continued to build more temples, statues and obliques and produced significantly more offspring than any other pharaoh in history
 Being an adventurous military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh and after fighting to an impasse, eventually 1258 BC

 Greek influence increased rapidly as the city of Naukratis in the Delta became home to the Greeks
 Situated in the new capital of Sis, the site kings saw a brief but enthusiastic revival in economy and culture, but by 525 BC
 In, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began conquering Egypt and eventually succeeded in capturing the pharaoh Samtik III at the Battle of Pelusim
 Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home in Susa, leaving Egypt under the control of a centurion

 Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies faced the challenges of native contradiction, incisive family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria formed after the death of Ptolemy IV
 Additionally, as Rome relied more heavily on Egypt for grain imports, the Romans took considerable interest in Egypt's political situation
 Continuing Egyptian revolts, ambitious leaders, and powerful Syrian opponents unbalanced this situation, resulting in Rome being forced to send forces to make this country a province of its empire

 However, it was an anti-religion whose tendency was to win converts to paganism and it challenged popular religious traditions
 As a result, persecution of converts to Christianity began which culminated in the great march of Diocletian in 303 AD, but Christianity eventually prospered
 In 391 AD the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced a bill that prohibited pagan rites and closed temples
 Alexandria became the center of great anti-pagan riots where public and private religious symbols were destroyed
 As a result, the Egyptian pagan culture continued to decline

 a combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which is the rich fertile soil resulting from the annual inundation of the Nile River
 Thus, the ancient Egyptians were able to produce much more food, causing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technical, and artistic activities

 Interpretive theories are those that approach the outside world theoretically for theory formation
 rachanaatmak siddhant ve hai jo maanate hai ki siddhant vastav main duniya kaa nirmaan karne main madad karte hai
 Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the inception of the teaching of international relations
 yah siddhant un pracheen paramparaagat drushtikonon par bharosa karne kaa daawa karata he, jisamen thuseedide, maikiyaveli or hobs jaise lekhak shaamil hai
 Early realism can be expressed as a reaction against idealistic thinking
 yathartwaadiyon ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke prakope ko adarshavaadi soch kii kami ke ek saboot ke rup main dekha tha
 There are various varieties in modern realist thought, however, as the main principles of this theory state control, existence and self-help are considered
 yatharthwaad main kai mahatvapurn manyataayen hai
 Realists believe that nation-states are unitary and geographically based actors in this chaotic international system, where no real official world exists as a government capable of regulating interactions or interactions between these nation-states
 duusare, yah antarsarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya sanghathanon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, yaa bahurashtriya companiyon ke bajaay samprabhu rajyon ko hi antarrashtriya maamalon main praathmik abhinayta maanate hai
 Thus, the state itself, as the supreme system, remains in competition with each other
 aise main, ek rajya apane astitv ko banaae rakhane, apni khud kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye or in praathmik uddeshyon ke saath apane swayan ke swaarth kii khoj main ek tarksangat swytt abhinayta ke rup main kaary karata he or is tarah apni samprabhutaa or astitv kii raksha karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Realists believe that nation states, in pursuit of their own interests, attempt to mobilize resources for themselves and determine the relations between states by their respective levels of power
 shakti kaa yah str rajya ke sainya, aarthik or raajnneetik kshamtaaon se nirdhaarit hota he
 Human nature realists believe that states are inherently aggressive, so territorial expansion has been bounded by opposing powers
 jabaki dusre aakraamak / rakshaatmak yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he ki rajya hamensha apane astitv kii suraksha or nirantarata kii chintaa se grast rahete hai
 The defensive approach leads to a security dilemma, because while a nation becomes a weapon to enhance its own security, the opponent also tries to gain parallel benefits as well
 isliye yah prakriya or adhik asthirataa kii ore le ja sakati he yahan suraksha ko keval shunya raashi khel / shunya-sanchay khel ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan keval saapeksh laabh mil saktaa he
 Neo-realism or structural realism was presented by Kenneth Waltz in his book The Theory of International Politics as an advanced development of realism itself
 joseph greeko ne navayathartwaadee vichaaron ko or adhik paramparaagat yathartwaadiyon ke saath joda he
 This type of theory is sometimes called "modern realism"
 waltz ke nav yatharthwaad kaa kahana he ki sanrachana ke prabhaav ko rajya ke vyavhaar ko samajhane ke rup main liya janaa chahie
 Structure is defined in two forms, first — the system theory of the international system, which is chaotic and second — the distribution of capacities in units

 The major theories of constructivism hold that "international politics is produced by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identity
 " rachnawad kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vaastaviktaa saamaajik rup se gyanatmak / boudhik sanrachanaon ke dwaara nirmit hoti he
 This theory emerged as a debate taking into account the scientific method of theories of international relations and the role of theories in the production of international power
 amenul edler ne kaha he ki rachnawad tarkwaadi or vyaakhyaatmak antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton main ek bich kaa rasta he

 frederikh wilhelm joseph phon shelling germany kaa darshanik tha
 Schelling's philosophy is considered difficult to understand due to the nature of constant change

 In 1856, all his works were published in 14 parts titled 'complete Works of Schelling' edited by Schelling's son
 shelling ke darshanik chintan main teen mode spasht drushtigat hote hai
 Initially he was influenced by Fichte's philosophy and was busy developing it
 phir vah brano or spinoja se prabhavit hokar param tatv ke do paksh prakruti or man sweekaar karne laga
 Schelling exhibited his originality in the third turn, but his ideas of this time are also similar to those of Jakov Boehm
 ab vah sansar ko ishwar se utpann hua samajhane laga
 Germany was overwhelmed by Hegel's philosophy during Schelling's time
 at: higel ke jeevankaal main shelling apana munh nahin khol sakaa
 After Hegel's death in 1934, he protested against her
 vah apane dharmik or puranic vichaaron ko higel ke nakaaratmak taarkik yaa pariklpanaavadi darshan kaa sweekaaratmak paripurak samajhataa tha
 Mind and nature are two sides of the same element from Schelling's view
 prakruti drushtigat man he or man adrusht prakruti he
 Because of this relationship of mind and nature, we can understand nature
 prakruti main bhi jivan, vichaar or uddeshy hai
 The same power appears to be subconscious in the mind and works subconsciously in the senses, animal instinct, ecological development, chemical processes, electricity and gravity
 hamaare sharir ko sanchalit karanevaali andh achetan shakti man main swachetan hokar aatma kehalaati he

 ve to nirpeksh man ke vikaas main do bhinn str yaa yug hai
 There is a gradual evolution in the absolute mind

 Schelling's final philosophical views appear to be merely epistemological
 sansar ek jivit, satat vikasshil angik sristi kii bhanti he
 Each of its parts has its own importance
 inaki upeksha karke sansar ke samshti rup ko nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Similarly, every part of the world is also dependent on the whole
 is satya ko shelling kai prakaar se pramanit karne kaa praytn karata he
 For one, he considers the world to be intelligent, so he can also be known through wisdom
 duusare, sansar kaa itihaas tarksangat he, isliye iske sristi-vikaas-kram ko taarkik bhashaa main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Schelling also acknowledges the significance of intuition
 antargyaan se mul tarkvakya praapt hote hai or unke aadhaar par ham sansar ke tarksangat siddhant kii rachana sweekaar kar sakate hai
 Schelling was living in an art environment
 usase prabhavit hokar usne sweekaar kiya he ki sansar ek kalatmak rachana he
 Absolute power fulfills its purpose by creating the world
 isliye manushya kaa bhi sarvocch kaary kala kii sristi karnaa he
 All kinds of duality in art achieve harmony

 It is unveiled in art
 kala kaa sarjan prakruti ke sarjan kii bhanti hi sampann hota he
 Therefore the artist knows how nature works
 is prakaar kala darshan kaa aavashyak or upyogi ang ban jaati he
 Schelling clearly states that there is no mystery in this, but a person who does not have the ability to transcend unrelated details gained from experience can neither become a philosopher nor understand the heart of reality

 In his view, a man becomes infinite by increasing his personality, he attains a rhythm in absolute power
