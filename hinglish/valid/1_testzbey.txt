 yatra udyog main, yatri kaa naam record athwa paisanger nem record ) ek computer reserveshan system ) ke databes main ek aisa record he, jisamen ek yatri yaa saath yatra karne vaale yatriyon ke samooh ke liye pathpradarshak pustak shaamil hoti he
 The PNR principle was first introduced by airlines who needed to exchange reservation information in situations when passengers needed multiple airlines to reach their destination
 To this end, IATA defined a standard for PNR content and layout
 jab ek yatri ek pathpradarshak pustak book karata he, tab yatrakarta yaa yatra website upyogkarta us computer reserveshan system main ek pienaar banaata he jise vah istemaal karata he
 This is typically a large global delivery system, such as Amadeus, Saber, worldspan or Galileo, but PNR can also be in the airline's CRS database if a booking is made directly with an airline
 is pienaar ko yatri or sambhddha pathpradarshak pustak ke liye master pienaar kaha jaataa he
 The PNR is identified by a record locator in a particular database
 jab master pienaar ke dharak dwaara yatra ke bhaag pradaan nahin kiye jate, tab pienaar jaankaree kii pratiyaan un airlinon ke siares ke paas pahunchaai jaati hai jo parivahan pradaan karte hai
 These CRS guides open copies of the original PNR in their own database to handle the parts of the book for which they are responsible
 kai airline apane siares ek jidies dwaara yojit karwaati hai, jo pienaar kii saajhedaari kii anumati detaa he
 The record locator of the copied PNR is reported back to the CRS who owns the master PNR, so that all records are tied together
 This allows the PNR to exchange updates when the travel conditions change in any CRS
 haalanki pienaar mul rup se hawaii yatra ke liye shuru kiye gaye the, par ab ye hotel, car kiraye par dene, railway aadi kii booking karwaane ke liye bhi istemaal kiye jate hai
 Colloquially, "PNR" also refers to the specific six-letter record locator used to identify records
 ek takneekee str se, booking puri karne se pehle pienaar ke paanch bhaagon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They are: ek baar booking is str tak puri ho jaati he to siares ek adwitiya alpha-newmeric record loketor kaa prachaalan karata he, jo aage kiye gaye kisi bhi parivartan kii parvaah kiye bina samaan rahegaa vibhajit ho)
 prayek airline ek vishisht record loketor ke saath apana swayan kaa booking record banaaegi, jo sambhddha airline or siares ke bich samjhaute ke str par nirbhar hoga, yah siares par sanchaarit kiya jayega or booking main store kiya jayega
 While the above list is the minimum requirement, both the passenger and the airline need more information to ensure efficient travel
 inamen shaamil hai: In recent times, many governments now require that the airline provide more information to help investigators track criminals or terrorists
 These include: adhiktar airline yaa yatra agenciyaan ek computer riserveshan system ) yaa global vitaran system ) company jaise sabre, galileo, worldspan or amadeus se apane pienaar kii mezbaani karwaane kaa chayan karti hai
 Some privacy organizations are concerned about the amount of pnr's personal data
 jabaki ek booking puraa karne ke liye nunatam data kaaphi chota hota he, ek pienaar main aamtaur par samvedansheel prakruti kii adhik jaankaree hogi
isamen yatri kaa puraa naam, janm kii taarikh, ghar or kaam kaa pataa, telephone number, i-mail kaa pataa, credit card vivaran or saath hi apaat samparkon ke naam or vyaktigat jaankaree shaamil hogi

 In May 2004, the US government negotiated the 2004 Passenger Name Record Data Transfer Agreement Agreement - a safe harbor PNR transfer agreement with the European Commission
 In particular, the European Commission understood that the level of protection generated for such PNR transfers could meet the standard of "adequacy" required by the 1995 EU Data Directive as long as the data were used only for those purposes

 Keeping the green fodder in a juicy shielded state inside the pit in the absence of air creates lactic acid in the fodder which reduces the ph of the green fodder and protects the green fodder
 is surakshit hare chaare ko saillej kehete hai
 Most farmers use straw or straw, which is very poor compared to silage because there is less availability of protein, minerals and energy from straw or straw
 dane vaali fasalein jaise makka, jowar, jayee, bajra aadi saillej banane ke liye utam fasale hai kyonki inamen carbohydrate kii maatra adhadhik hoti he
 The excess of carbohydrate intensifies the fermentation process in the feed
 dalhneey fasalon kaa silage acha nahin rahata parantu dalhneey fasalon ko dane vaali fasalon ke saath milakar saillej banaaya ja saktaa he
 Otherwise Shashira or jaggery solution should be used, which can increase the amount of lactic acid
 dane vaali fasalon jaise makka, jowar, jayee aadi ko saillej banane ke liye jab dane dudhia avasthaa ho to kaatna chahie
 At present 65-70 percent water is in the feed
 agar pani kii maatra adhik he to chaare ko thoda sukha lenaa chahie
 The choice of place for the pit is very important for making silage

 After stuffing, make a domes from above and cover it with polythene or dry grass and pressurize the soil thoroughly and make a paste from above so that water and air etc
 cannot get out from it
 gadde bharne ke teen maheene baad gaddhon ko kholana chahie
 While opening, keep in mind that the silage is removed in layers from one side and only some part of the landfill is opened and cover it later
 garhdha kholane ke baad saillej ko jitna jaldi ho sake pashuon ko khilaakar samaapt karnaa chahie
 There is some moldiness in the upper parts of the pit and near the walls
 yah dhyaan main rakhen ki aisa saillej pashuon ko nahin khilaanaa chahie
 All types of animals can be fed silage
 ek bhaag sookhaa chaara, ek bhaag saillej milakar khilaanaa chahie yadi hare chaare kii kami ho to saillej kii maatra zyada kii ja sakati he
 The silage can be fed 30-35 days after making silage
 ek saamaanya pashu ko 20-25 kilogram saillej pratidin khilaayaa ja saktaa he
 Feed milch animals after taking out the silage milk so that the silage smell does not come in the milk
 yah dekha gaya he ki badhia saillej main 85-90 pratishat hare chaare ke baraabar poshak tatv hote hai
 Hence milk production can be increased to animals by feeding silage during fodder shortage

 david emil durkhime ko aadhunik samajashaastra kaa sansthaapak or samaaj-vaigyanik shabdaawalee main duniya kaa pehla adhikarik samajashastri mana jaataa he
 He was also the first professor of sociology in the university system of study

 Durkheim's Bill of Sociological Concepts considers humans to be the result of social relations
 is kaaran durkhime kaa samajashaastra apane buniyadi dhaanche main vyaktvaad ke kisi bhi rup ko manyata dene se inkaar karata he
 Durkheim Comt, Marx, Weber etc
 sit close to social thinkers in the context of considering human rights as the product of society
 gauratlab he ki vyakti ko samaaj kaa utpaada maananaa or saamaajik parighatna ko kendriya mahatva dena hi samajashaastra ko anya anushasano kii tulana main ek vishisht swaroop pradaan karata he
 This distinction of sociology was not possible without Durkheim
 haalaanki durkhime ne montescue or ruso jaise vichaarkon se lekar vyavahaarwad, samaajwaad tathaa naitik shiksha jaise masalon par bhi saghan chintan kiya he, parantu samajashaastra ke kshetra main unki chaar rachanaaon— 'da divizan of lebar', 'da rules of sosiolgical mathed', 'suiside' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' ko sabase zyaada mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 David Emile Durkheim was born in a French Jewish family of Epinal, Lorraine
 unke pita or dada donon hi rabbi the
 His early education was also in a religious school, but at the very beginning of his life he decided to live a completely secular life
 ek adhyavsaayee chaatr ke rup main unhone vikhyath echol normel superioyre main daakhila liya or 1886 main apni doctoret ke ansh ke rup main unhone 'da divizan of lebar in socity' kii rachana kii
 In this work, Durkheim shows the difference between modern and traditional societies, suggesting that while modern society is based on the specialization of labor, traditional society runs on shared beliefs
 unke mutabik samaaj ke roopon kaa yah antar niyamon kii vyavastha ke antar ko bhi darshata he
 In this way, modern society is governed by self-regulation, whereas the rules of traditional society are based on external beliefs and approval
 durkhime ke anusaar chunki saajhe vishwaas sarvamaanya naitikta ke praadhikaar par tike hote hai isliye in vishwaason par aadhaarit vyavastha shakti or dabaav ke jariye hi kaayam rah saktaa he
 Whereas self-regulatory or modern society cannot be balanced without elements like freedom, equality and justice
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki saamaajik roopon kii vividhta ko niyamon ke vishisht dhaanche se jod kar dekhne kaa yah sutrikaran aparaadh or kanoon ke samajashastreey adhyayanon ke liye buniyadi prerak tatva rahaa he
 Durkheim believed that due to confusion in traditional and modern forms of society and the tendency to impose traditional laws or rules on modern societies, it has been responsible for many social problems
 aadhunik samaajon kii yah vyakhya durkhime ke krititv kii vishisht uplabdhi maani jaati he
 In this composition, Durkheim also analyzes the social association or affiliation of a person and holds the view that a person needs special social companionship
 durkhime dikhaate hai ki saamaajik sansthaaon ke andar swatah hi ek sansakti kaa tatva hota he jo apane sahabhaagiyon se ek nishchit vyavhaar kii maang karata he
 Durkheim therefore stressed that social processes should be studied instead of individuals
 unke anusaar in saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa thos rup sansthaaon or vyavhaar main abhivyakt hota he jinka anuvikshan ke aadhaar par bhi adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Durkheim calls these processes social factors or social facts
 durkhime ko samajashastreey adhyayan main sankhyikee ke sarjanaatmak upyog karne kaa shrey bhi jaataa he
 In this regard, his creation Suicide is set as a standard
 is kriti main durkhime ne yah pratipaadit kiya tha ki aatmahatya kii alag-alag daron kii vyakhya vyakti ke saamaajik sambaddhta ke staron main pragat antar ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he
 For example, he showed that it is not possible to guess why older men commit suicide based on the individual's personal tendencies
 lekin agar vyakti kii saamaajik sthiti ke karkon jaise uske avivaahit hone yaa samaaj se uske algaav aadi par dhyaan diya jaae to aatmahatya ke kaarnon kii shinaakht kii ja sakati he
 Durkheim uses statistics in his studies to reveal the strength or character of social facts such as forms of mutual association of members of a group
 masalan, agar kisi samooh main aapasi saahchary kii bhaavana kamazor he to uske sadasyon main naitik yaa manovaigyanik samasyaayen paye jane kii sambhaavna zyaada hogi
 Conversely, if there is a deep feeling of companionship in a group, then its members will be more willing to sacrifice for their group
 durkhime kii anya kriti 'da rules of sosiolgilakal mathed' samajashaastra main prayukt kii jane vaali paddatiyon kii aadharbhumi maani jaati he
 Durkheim in this work makes it clear that the central theme of sociology is social system, so it should give priority to institutional and systemic forms of society rather than individual
 is rachana main durkhime samajashaastra ko aise hi saamaajik tathyon kaa adhyayan bataate hai
 According to him, there is a special kind of consistency between these social facts which cannot be called just the accumulated result of their constructive parts
 apni rachana suiside main durkhime isi bindu ko spasht karnaa chaahate the ki aatmahatya jaisi nijee parighatna ko bhi logon ke saahchary-sambandhon tathaa saamaajik banding ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit kiya ja saktaa he
 He argued that things like personal feelings, values or thoughts actually originate from social participation
 durkhime kii do rachanaayen 'da divijan of lebar' tathaa 'da alementary forms of da relijas life' tatkaaleen saamaajik vyavastha kii padtaal main aadhunik upagamon kaa istemaal karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 In the sociological discourse of modernity, both these works remain an essential reference even today due to their fine and intensive study
 durkhime kaa chintan gahare arth main aadhunik tha
 Even psychoanalysts like Fried were not free from the prejudices of their time and compared primitive brains to mental patients in his work Total and Taboo, while Durkheim proposed in his work Elementary Forms of the Religious Life that logic Thus, the social structures and beliefs of primitive tribes cannot be undermined by the rationale of modern man
 durkhime ke samay main vyaapt raajnneetik duragrahon ko dekhte hue yah ek saahasik vichaar tha
 Since Durkheim considers logic to be a social product, he rejects the idea that proves humans to be inferior or superior
 durkhime ke is hastkshep ne samajashaastra ko ek buniyadi samtawaad se las kiya he
 In considering the social utility of religion in the above work, Durkheim argues that human participation is an understanding of the basic forms of human reasoning - space, time, classification, power, work and reason only through participation in religious customs and rituals
 Earns a sense of wholeness
 is rachana main durkhime yah vichaar bhi pesh karte hai ki pavitrataa kaa saamaajik anubhav saamaajik antahsambandhon ko janm detaa he
 According to him, the birth of a social person and the development of reasoning is also canceled by this process
 is rachana main durkhime yah bhi kehete hai ki samast avadharanaon kii utpatti samaaj se hi hoti he
 Therefore, in order to develop an understanding of logic, language and meaning, it should be studied in which social forms and contexts words and concepts have been used
 yahan durkhime dharm ko samaaj kaa prakaarya bataate hue ek or ahm sutrikaran karte hai ki dharm saamaajik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhane kaa madhyam he
 Durkheim does not directly deny the truth of religious beliefs, but for him the truth of religion is determined by his ability to encourage rituals or not
 unke anusaar sangathit dharmon ko keval vishwaason ke aadhaar par nahin samajha ja saktaa kyonki is tarah ke dharm aksar samaaj ke parmparik roopon ko akshunn rakhane ke liye vyaktigat aasthaa kaa daman karte hue bhi paye jate hai
 Durkheim's formula regarding the role of religion in modern and traditional societies is also worth considering that the functions of religion are not the same in these two different varieties of society
 parmparik samaajon main to dharm saamaajik niyantran kaa aujaar hota he jabaki aadhunik samaajon main uskaa yah prakaarya gair-zaruri ho jaataa he kyonki aadhunik samaajon main vah gyaan-mimasaa kaa prakaarya nibhaane lagata he
 That is why his role in the social system is not the same as before
 durkhime kii yah nishpatti samajashastreey chintan ke lihaaz se ek uplabdhi kahi jaaegi ki manushya ke ek jaivik praani se saamaajik praani main roopantarit hone kii parighatna ko vyakti kii jaivik kshamtaaon yaa manovigyaan ke aadhaar par vyakhyayit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He argues that the conversion of biological to social is accomplished through social processes
 isliye durkhime ko lagata he ki man or sharir ko do alag iyatta qaraar dene vaala mat keval samaaj kii prakriya se baahar khadey jaivik astitv or saamaajik praani kaa antar darshata he
 According to him the first stage creature cannot be called a rational human being
 ve is baat par bhi jor dete hai ki manushya main tarkbuddhi yaa vyaktitv jaisi chizein samaaj kii prakriya se hi paidaa hoti hai
 Durkheim believed that to maintain a human being as a social animal, social processes and special forms of association are needed
 yani saamaajik manushya ko uske nishchit saamaajik vinyas or sandarbh se alag hataakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Therefore Durkheim warns that if any method of study of psychology, economics or philosophy undertakes to understand social phenomena only on the basis of the accumulated activities of individuals, then it should be held guilty of bypassing the most important aspect like society
 hgfrtewxurkzaima ke chintan or krititv main samtawaad kii spasht pratishtha ke baavjood nariwadi vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki unhone striyon ke mudde par paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 To a certain extent, it is true that as a sociologist, no work of Durkheim is concentrated on the female side
 lekin unnisvin sadi ke jis daur main durkhime samajashaastra ko vyavasthit kar rahe the us samay striyon ke prashnon par bahut kam saamaajik chintak vichaar kar rahe the
 In Suicide, he mentions a fatalistic type of suicide, which he mainly associates with women
 durkhime kaa khyaal yah bhi tha ki vivaah purushon ke liye to laabhakaari hota he lekin striyon ke jivan par uskaa nakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 In The Division of Labor, Durkheim refers to the indigenous people, stating that the social status of women in such communities was not inferior to that of men, whereas female status in modern societies has become weaker
 tatkaaleen samaaj kii ausat pravriti stri ko komal or kamazor ke rup main chitrit karti thi
 In view of this, Durkheim's vision will surely be called as pioneer
 durkhime kaa avdaan samajashastriyon kii kai pidiyon ke liye prerana, prashnankan, samaveshan or jirah kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the thirties, Talcott Parsons attempted to assimilate Durkheim's work into structural functionalism
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki america main durkhime ke avdaan ko prakaaryawad or pratyakshthawaad ke najaariye se dekha jane laga
 While in France, his vision was used by anthropologists such as levi-strauss who were interested in creating a symbolist anthropology based on the concepts, ideas, and interrelationships of society, as propounded by Durkheim
 lekin durkhime ke vichaaron ko aadhaar banaakar nayi vyakhya karne kaa yah upkram is myne main ekangi sabit hua ki usne durkhime kii mul prastaavnaon ke kuch nishchit hisson kaa hi istemaal kiya
 Marxist stream sociologists have attempted to counterbalance Parsons' approach by emphasizing the radical nature inherent in Durkheim's thinking in his writings, which emphasizes the proving of Durkheim as politically conservative
 samajashastriyon ke ek samooh kaa maananaa he ki durkhime kaa samajashaastra vyakti ko gaun kar detaa he
 But if we look carefully, Durkheim does so intentionally
 unki drushti samaaj ko multah samuhikta main samajhane kaa aagrah karti he tathaa is baat par jor detii he ki agar saamaajik siddhanton kii padtaal or samajashaastra ke vyavhaar main antarvirodhon ke adhyayan ko tavajjo na dekar use vyaktvaad kaa paryaay bana diya jaataa he to samajashaastra kaa buniyadi uddeshy nirast ho jaataa he
 Durkheim's task of sociology is not to provide raw material for philosophical research and then wait for what the philosopher's vision says in his assessment
 iske barakes, durkhime yah israar karte hai ki samajashaastra ko saamaajik tathyon ke adhyayan sambandhi kasautiyon kaa nirmaan khud karnaa chahie
 He rejected the argument of philosophers that social facts have an element of contingency
 is aalochana kaa suchintit jawaab dete hue durkhime ne kaha ki samaaj kii nirantarata banaaye rakhane ke liye kuch khaas tarah ke or sthaayee rup zaruri hote hai

 Today, he and his literature are proud of that huge mass of the world which is engaged in the struggle with imperialism, capitalism and feudalism
 premchand kii rachanaaon main jivan kii vividh samasyaon kaa chithran hua he
 They have shown the struggle of mill owners and laborers, zamindars and farmers and newness and antiquity
 premchand ke yug-pravartak avdaan kii charchaa karte hue dow nagendra likhte hai : "firstly, he raised Hindi fiction from the level of 'entertainment' and made a meaningful connection with life
 chaaron or faile hue jivan or anek samayik samasyaon

 samaaj ke vibhinn ayaamon ko unase adhik vishwasaneeyata se dikhaa paane vaale paridarshak ko hindi-urdu kii duniya nahin jaanati

 This is the philosophy of Premchand
 " Premchand did not sing the glory of the past, nor did he imagine the future
 He kept analyzing his present state of present tense with honesty
 They saw that this bond is from inside, not outside
 Once these farmers, these poor, can feel that no power of the world can suppress them, then they will surely become invincible

 Due to this, there has been a natural fluctuation in the language

 And the language of the educated is pure and sophisticated language

 But this simplicity of language should not be considered synonymous with lifelessness, monotony and idiosyncrasy
 "bhashaa ke sateek, sarthak evam vyanjanapurna prayog main ve apane samakaleen hi nahin, baad ke upanyaaskaaron ko bhi peeche chhod jate hai
 Dr
 Nagendra writes: " premchand ne sahaj saamaanya maanviya vyapaaron ko manovaigyanik sthitiyon se jodakar unamem ek sahaj-teevr maanviya ruchi paidaa kar di
 "even in terms of craft and language, Premchand gave a special level to the Hindi novel
 


chitraneey vishay ke anuroop shilp ke anveshan kaa prayog hindi upanyaas main pehle premchand ne hi kiya
 His specialty is that the scenes he presents are extremely moving and dramatic
 " Premchand has combined both Hindi and Urdu styles

 His style is flirtatious and refined
 premchand kii style kii duusari visheshta saralata or sajivta he
 There is also the quality of figurativeness in his style
 upama, roopak, utpreksha aadi alankaaron ke dwaara style main vishesh laalitya aa gaya he
 Introducing this kind of figurative style, he writes - 'the heavy sword of the Arab has become loose in front of the Christian's dagger
 ek sarp ke bhanti fan se chot karti thi, dusri nagin kii bhanti udati thi
 One was catching like waves and the other glowed like water fishes
 ' Chitropamata is also found in the style of Premchand
 premchand bhav ghatana athwa paatr kaa aise dhang se varnan karte hai ki sara drishy aankhon ke sammukh naach uthta he uskaa ek chitra-sa khinch jaataa he
 The scene of the hut of Surdas of Rangbhumi novel is very lively- 'kaisaa nairashyapurna drishy tha
 Neither cot nor bed, nor utensils
 ek kone main ek mitti kaa gadaa jisko aayu kaa anumaan us par jami hui kaai se ho saktaa tha
 The stove had handi ek puraani chalani kii bhanti chhidron se bharaa hua tawa or ek choti-si kathout or ek lotaa
 This was the property of that house
 ' The responses of Premchand's characters also add characterization to his style
 unki style main hasya-vyangy kaa bhi put rahata he, kintu unka vyangy aisa nahin hota jo kisa kaa dil dukhaae
 It has such sweetness that opens our eyes along with entertainment

 ' premchand ji kii style par unke vyaktitv kii chhap spasht rup se ankit he
 Check out the climax of Premchand's famous poignant novel 'godan': dhaniya ne hori kii deh chhui to kalejaa san se ho gaya
 The face had become radiant
 kaanpati hui awaz se boli - kaisaa ji he tumhaara? Hori looked with unsteady eyes and said - You have come dung? i have taken the cow for Mars
 vah khadaa he, dekho
 Coriander saw the appearance of death
 use pahachaanati thi
 i saw him coming to his feet and looked like a storm
 uske saamne saas mari, sasur mara, apane do balak mare, gaanv ke pachaason aadmi mare
 Prana got a bit of a shock
 vah aadhaar jis par jivan tikaa hua tha, jaise khiskaa ja rahaa tha; lekin nahin yah dhairya kaa samay he, uski shankaa nirmul he, lu lag gayi he, usee se achet ho gayi hai
 Stopping the tears, she said - Look at me, i am, coriander; Do not recognize me? hori kii chetana louti
 Death had come near; The fire was on fire
 dhunaan shant ho gaya tha
 Looked at the coriander with poor eyes, two drops of tears fell from both corners
 ksheen swar main bolaa -- meraa kaha suna maaf karnaa dhaniyaan! ab jaataa hoon
 The craving of the cow remained in the mind
 ab to yahan ke rupye kirya-karam main jaayange
 Don't cry, how long will it live? All the plight happened
 ab marane de
 And his eyes closed again
 usee vakt hira or shobhaa doli lekar pahunch gayi
 After picking up Hori, he lied in the doli and walked towards the village
 gaanv main yah khabar hawa kii tarah fail gayi
 The entire village had accumulated
 hori khaat par padaa shaayad sab kuch dekhtaa tha, sab kuch samajhataa tha; par zabaan band ho gayi thi
 Yes, tears flowing from his eyes were telling how difficult it is to break the bond of attachment
 jo kuch apane se nahin ban padaa, usee ke du:kha kaa naam to moh he
 What is the fascination of frostbitten duties and settled work! Except those orphans jane main he, jinke saath ham apana kartavya na nibhaa sake; un adhure mansoobon main he, jinhen ham na puraa kar sake
 But even after understanding everything, coriander was holding the fading shadow of hope
 aankhon se ansu They were falling, but like a machine, they roasted mangoes and cooked panas, sometimes wheat in the body of hori kii bhusi kii maalish karti
 What to do, no money, no one would send and call a doctor
 hira ne rote hue Said - Sister-in-law, make your heart hard, go and donate, Dada go dhaniya ne uski ore tiraskaar kii aankhon se dekha
 Now how much more hard will it make the heart? The religion she has towards her husband, will she bataanaa padegaa? jo jivan kaa sangi tha uske naam ko ronaa hi kya uskaa dharm he? And many voices came - yes go - don it, now is the time
 dhaniya yantra kii bhaanti uthi, aaj jo sutali bechi thi uske bees aane paise laayi or pati ke thande haath main rakhkar saamne khadey daatadin se boli -- mahraaj, ghar main na gaay he, na bichaya, na paisa

 alternetr prayavarti dhara utpann karne vaala vidyut janitr he
 In fact it is a synchronous machine
 vartmaan samay main adhikansh shakti sanyantron main vidyut utpaadan kaa kaary alternetr hi karte hai
 Over time, very large size alternators begin to form
 50,000 se 1,50,000 kilowat kii kshamtawale janitr ab saamaanya ho gaye hai
 These are continuous actuation machines, so they are also structured on a very standard basis
 mukhyat:, yah swat: kaaryakari mashin hoti he or iske saare pravartan duurastha niyantran dwaara niyantrit kiye ja sakate hai
 Voltage control can be done easily by varying the field current
 bhaar ke anuroop nivesh swayan hi niyantrit ho jaataa he
 For all these reasons, current power generators are very efficient and reliable
 vastav main inke vishwasaneey pravartan ke kaaran hi vidyut sambharan ko vishwasaneey banaaya janaa sambhav ho sakaa he
 As the use of electricity increased, the size and voltage of the generators also increased
 parantu dishtdhaara janitron main, armechar ghoomanevaala hone ke kaaran uske aakaar main bahut vruddhi karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Hence high voltage generating alternating current generators were made, in which the armature was voluntary and the field rotating
 vastut:, voltata janan ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki chaalak hi chumbakeey kshetra main ghume
 Voltage will also be induced in the conductor located in a rotating magnetic field, because even in this case, it is cutting the magnetic current
 at: is siddhant par, sthitik armechar or paribhraman kshetra dwaara voltata janit ho sakati he
 This voltage will be of alternating type and will depend on the relative position of the armature conductor and the field
 prayavarti dhara janitr, saamanyat:, sthitik armechar or paribhramanshil kshetra ke siddhant par aadhaarit hote hai
 In these, field magnets and coils are made revolving and the armature surrounds them
 armechar main kate khaanchon main chaalak sthit hote hai
 Due to the armature being static and outward, its size can be greatly increased, which means, it can have a much higher driver number
 kshetra vinding saapekshatya chote hote hai or unhen adhik veg par ghumaya janaa, vyaavhaarik rup main, koi kathinaayee nahin utpann karata
 Due to these reasons it is possible to generate high voltages in alternating current generators and they are usually applied at 11,000 volts
 in janitron main burushon ke sthaan par sarpi valay hote hai, jo kshetra kundaliyon ko uttejit karne ke liye dhara pahunchaate hai
 They are required to be stimulated by direct current due to the area being revolving
 uttejan dhara yaa to bahari strot se praapt kii jaati he, athwa usee shaft par aropit ek chote se disht dhara janitr se, jise uttejk kehete hai
 The excitation voltage is usually 110 or 220 volts
 sabhi bade janitron main uttejk dwaara sambharan hota he, jisase uttejk ke liye alag se disht dhara strot kii aavashyaktaa na rahe
 Reverse current generators have to act at a fixed velocity, which depends on the frequency of voltage generated in them and the number of field poles
 ise nimnlikhit sameekaran se vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : Here n = revolutions per minute, f = frequency and p = pole number
 is prakaar, 50 chakree aavriti ke liye chaar dhruvi mashin 1,500 parikraman prati minute ke veg se pravartan karegi or do dhruvi mashin 3,000 parikraman prati minute ke veg se
 If the fixed velocity remains the same, then there will be a difference in frequency
 saamanyat: vidyut sambharan nirdhaarit voltata or aavriti ke hote hai
 Therefore, to keep the frequency constant, it is necessary not to keep the velocity of the generator together and this velocity is fixed according to its pole number
 bharat tathaa duusare kaamanwealth deshon main vidyutsambharan kii aavriti saamanyat: 50 chakra prati second nishchit he
 60 cyclic frequency is used in USA and other countries
 aavriti ke anusaar vibhinn dhruvon ke janitron kaa veg bhi nishchit hota he, jise samakramik veg kehete hai
 Based on the above, these generators by velocity have two main types: one is a turbogenerator that is driven by a steam turbine and is driven at high velocity, and the other is a hydroelectric generator, which is usually fired at a low velocity
 kuch kaa veg to 125 parikraman prati minute tak hota he
 They have 48 poles for 50 cyclic frequency
 tervojanitr main dhruv sankhya 2 yaa 4 se adhik nahin hoti
 Larger generators have only 2 poles and operate at 3,000 revolutions per minute
 is antar ke saath saath inaki rachana main bhi bahut antar hota he
 The rotor of a more polarized machine is much larger
 uski rachana ek gatipalak chakra ke samaan hoti he, jo madhya bhaag se cycle ke pahiai kii bhanti spokon par aropit hota he or dhruv golai main chaaron ore lage hote hai
 It is called rotor with salient pole
 iske vipareet, terbo janitr kaa roter bahut lanbaa or belanaakaar hota he
 The poles are not protruding, but the area in the grooves made of cylindrical rotor is formed by the coil
 akruti ke anuroop is prakaar ke roter ko belanaakaar roter athwa chikna roter kehete hai
 Due to the turbogenerator being propelled at high velocity, problems of lubrication and ventilation of the bearings are extremely important
 jalavidyut janitron main vering par bahut adhik bhaar hone ke kaaran tathaa parshv bal ke lagane ke kaaran, snehan kii samasya jatil hoti he, parantu sanvathan swayan apane aap hi paryaapt ho jaataa he
 The oil pump for lubrication is sent with oil pressure to the movable parts, where lubrication is necessary
 tel saaf karne ke liye tel filter bhi aavashyak sahaayak he
 There is also a system of actively shutting down the machine when lubrication pressure decreases
 terbojanitron main sanvathan ke liye bahudhaa valit sanvathan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The ducts in the armature and rotor are made in such a way that air is drawn into these vessels by pulling air from one side and leaving the other side frosting the machine
 ucch veg par is kriya main sahaayta to milti he, parantu bade bade janitron main yah prakritik rup se sanvathan paryaapt nahin hota or hawa ko dabaav ke dwaara mashin main bheja jaataa he
 To protect the machine from dust and moisture, a closed convection system is used
 isamen usee vaayu ko baar baar prayukt kiya jaataa he or garam hone par, vayushitak dwaara use thanda kar liya jaataa he or phir use dabaav ke saath mashin main sanvathan ke liye bheja jaataa he
 In large generators, hydrogen gas is also used instead of air for ventilation
 hydrogen vaayu se 14 guna halkaa hota he
 Therefore, using it for ventilation reduces aerial loss
 ooshmaa nishkasana kaa bhi yah vaayu se adhik prabhavi madhyam he
 But hydrogen combined with air can be explosive and adequate care is taken to protect it
 swami govindanand tirth ji maharaj shaktipaat parampara ke siddh guru hai
 Swamiji is a disciple of the great Guru and writer Swami Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj and the director of Yoga Shri Peeth Ashram, Rishikesh
 bhootkaal main principal rah chuke swamiji ne ab tak lagbhag aath sau logo ko shaktipaat parampara main dikshit karke unka jivan badal diya he
 On Monday, October 29, 1923, the moon landed on the ground
 madhya pradesh ke muraina district main ek gaanv he - kasamada gaanv kasamada ambah tehsil ke antargat aata he
 There used to be a Brahmin family in this village, headed by Shri Mata Prasad Mishra
 On October 29, Mata Prasad's wife gave birth to a son Ratna
 janm ke samay bachche ke mukh par ek alokik tej chamak rahaa tha
 The child was named Krishna Govind after Lord Krishna
 krishna govind bachapan se hi ek honhaar tejasvi balak tha
 Once some saints came to Mata Prasad ji's house
 unhone is tejasvi balak ko dekha to dekhte hi rah gaye
 He predicted that this child will grow up to become a great monk
 After this he prayed to the child's mother to give this child to us
 ye sunakar krishna kii maan itnaa dar gai ki vah bachche ko ghar ke andar le kar chali gai
 He categorically refused to deliver the child
 jab krishna bada hua to uske saath ascharyajanak ghatnaayen hone lagi
 When Krishna b
 a
 i used to study even then a similar incident happened once
 It was night time
 krishna ne zamin pe bistar lagaaya hua tha
 The winter days were on and the weather was very cold
 krishna razaai odhe so rahaa tha, un dinon bijli to hua nahin karti thi
 So the room was completely dark
 tabhi uski razaai main ek saanp ghus gaya
 The snake climbed from his leg and went through the stomach to his neck
 But he could not bear the speed of his face
 vah uski gardan se dusre kandhe par hote hue waapas pair kii taraf jane laga
 At the same time, the child Krishna lost sleep
 usko laga kii ye kya chiz uske sharir par chal rahi he
 He picked it up and took it in his hand
 jab usne dekha kii ye to saanp he to usne saanp ko uthaakar khidki se baahar phenk diya
 The child Krishna was a brilliant student, he received his early education from Ambah
 par un dinon ambah main koi hai skool nahin tha
 So he had to come to Gwalior to study high school
 He passed the High School examination in 1944 from Gwalior
 hai skool karne ke baad uske baad uske mata pita kii ichha thi kii vah naukari kar le
 unke chachere bhai sanskrit ke praadhyaapak the, ek baar wo ambah aaye to krishna ko bhi apane saath ahmedabad le gaye
 Krishna Govind reluctantly went to work there
 par kismat ko to kuch or hi manzur tha
 He spent only one night in Ahmedabad
 vahi raat unki jindagi kii yaadgaar raat ban gai
 The bed they were given to sleep in was bedbug
 puri raat khatmal unhen katate rahe
 Now it can only be said that the poisonous creature like snake could not bear their speed, then how did the despised bedbugs bite them? Somehow he spent that night and left for home as soon as dawn
 naukari karne kaa vichaar unhone tyaag diya
 He returned home from Ahmedabad via train via Agra
 uske baad unhone ucch shiksha praapt karne kii sochi
 After coming home, Krishna was married
 unki patni shrimati revati devi saakshaat lakshmi or saraswati kaa rup thi
 He encouraged Krishna for higher education
 krishna aage kii padhai karne ke liye gwalior aa gaye
 While living in Gwalior, he completed his MA in Hindi
 uske baad b
ed
 kiya
 Money was needed to study higher education
 parantu unke paas itane zyada paise nahin the ki padhai ke kharche puure ho saken
 He returned home in 1951 after completing his studies
 un dinon ambah main shiksha ke haalat bahut karaab the
 There was no school there
 krishna ne vahaan skool shuru karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 unhone vahaan par ek hai skool kii sthapana kii
 In 1952, the first batch of this school passed the High School examination
 krishna padhai main to meghavi the hi, uname prabandhan kii bhi acchhee kshamta thi
 All the students of the first batch of his school passed with good numbers
 is skool ke menager shri ramanivas sharma the
 Krishna's relationship with Sharma was very good
 parantu kismat main to kuch or hi likhaa tha
 Legislative assembly elections were to be held in 1957
 ramanivas sharma ne bhi chunaav kaa tikat bharaa tha
 But Krishna and Ramnivas had different views about politics
 isliye krishna ne ramanivas ke badale dusre ummidavaar shukla ko samarthan diya
 Krishna also participated in Shukla's election campaign
 Ramnivas did not like this
 He gave a 'show cause' notice to Krishna as the manager of the school
 krishna ne kaha kii vot dena tathaa kisi ko saport karnaa vyaktigat maamla he
 And as a school manager, Ramnivas has no right to ask this
 inhi matbhedon ke chalate krishna ne san 1958 main skool se tyaagptr de diya
 But it turned out well
 is ghatana ne unke shiksha abhiyaan ko or bhi zyada tej kar diya
 He started the work of educating more and more children by opening more schools, he opened two new schools in Dharamgarh, District Morena
 After this, two new schools were also opened in Bhind district
 The number of their schools was increasing
 prabandhan main maahir krishna ke skool lagaataar tarakkee kiye ja rahe the
 The meritorious children of his school would go ahead and enroll in the big school
 He also opened a school in Pandri
 is tarah se das saal biit gaye
 Krishna's schools were constantly being promoted
 skool kaa parinaam hameshaa hi acha rahata tha
 Ramnivas had been watching his progress for a long time
 ek din ramanivas ne unhen milane ke liye bulaayaa
 When Krishna went to meet him, Ramnivas proposed to make him headmaster of his school
 krishna ko to sirf bacchon kii shiksha se hi matlab tha
 The management of that school was not good in those days
 bacchon ko bhi acchhee shiksha nahin di ja rahi thi
 So he accepted the offer
 lekin unhone shart rakhi kii wo aavedan nahin karenge
 He will accept this post only if he is appointed as Principal by consensus
 ramanivas tathaa skool trust ke anya sadasyon ne yah baat sweekaar kar lee
 In this way Krishna became the principal
 ek din krishna bazaar main kapade kii dukaan par baithe the
 Just then, Master Madhav Singh appeared to be going along very fast
 unhone poocha kii kya baat he? itani tej kahan bhaage ja rahe ho? madhav singh ne bataaya kii unke guru swami shri shivom tirth ji maharaj aae hue hai
 They were going to meet him
 krishna ne kaha kii hamen bhi unase milwa do
 Ram Niwas also took them along with you
 donon guruuji ke paas pahunche
 Krishna knew that Swamiji is a very perfect teacher of the Shaktipat tradition
 swamiji ke paas pahunchakar krishna ek kone main baith gaye
 Swamiji was reading something while sitting on a bed
 log vahaan aate, swamiji ke pair chhukar baith jate
 swamiji se thodi se baat karte or phir chale jate
 Krishna sat there for a long time
 jab sab chale gaye to swamiji phir padhne lage
 After a long time, Swamiji saw Krishna sitting there
 He asked why are you sitting here
 krishna ne kaha kii mujhe bhi "aapkaa anugrah chahie"
 swamiji swamiji thodi der tak krishna ko dhyaan se dekhte rahe
 Then said that talk to Madhav Singh
 It seems normal to see this incident, but no one knew what was hidden in the womb of this incident
 is saamaanya se ghatana ne anek logo kaa jivan badal kar rakh diya
 Krishna went to Madhav Singh and said that Swamiji has asked you to talk to him
 madhav singh samaj gaye ki swamiji ne diksha ke liye kaha he
 Madhav Singh made all the arrangements
 or san is tarah 1973 main krishna kii shaktipaat parampara main diksha ho gai
 After this, Krishna continued to run his school for 15 years and also used the means in the manner prescribed by Swamiji
 san 1986 main 63 varsh kii aayu main krishna seva nivruth ho gaye
 His Guru Swami Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj used to reside in the Yoga Sri Peeth Ashram situated in the holy land of Rishikesh
 krishna unase milane rishikesh aae
 Swamiji told him that you are a skilled manager
 main kuch samay ke liye devas ja rahaa hoon atah tum ashram kii kaary vyavastha sanbhal lo
 krishna ne swamiji ke aadesh kaa paalan kar ashram kii vyavastha dekhni shuru kar di
 After a while, Krishna started remembering the house
 vah swamiji ke aane kaa intjaar karne lage taaki unase ajna lekar ghar ja saken
 parantu swamiji do varshon tak nahin aae
 After two years, when Swamiji returned in 1988, he ordered Krishna to renounce the desire of home and take sannyasa
 Guru's command was paramount for Krishna
 unhone tunrat hi apni ghar jane kii ichha kaa tyaag karke sanyas le liya
 On June 13, 1988, on the occasion of Ganga Dussehra, the process of renunciation of Krishna was completed
 yah din ek mahaan parivartan kaa din tha
 According to Hindu tradition, the name changes after renunciation
 so, krishna kaa naam badal kar ab swami govindanand tirth maharaj ho gaya
 For Swami Govindananda Tirtha Maharaj, this was not just a change of name
 unki soch, kriya kalap sab kuch badal gaya
 Now, most of his time was spent doing resources and maintaining the ashram
 sanyas ke samay hi swami shivom tirth ji maharaj ne unhen mantra diksha pradaan karne kii shakti bhi de di thi
 In 1992, he also got permission from Maharaj Ji to give Shaktipat initiation
 tab se aaj tak swamiji rishikesh sthit yoga shri peeth ashram main virajman hai
 Swamiji changed his life by giving initiation of Shaktipat to many disciples
 virendra upaadhyaay ne ek pustak likhi kii he - "shri govindamratbhajan bhagirathi"
 yah pustak swamiji ko samarpit he
 The author of the book says that he has completed this book only with the blessings of Swamiji

 Nagpuri or Sadri is an indo-aryan language spoken in Jharkhand and some other states
 ise sadaani samudaay bolta he, jis karanvash ise sadaani bhashaa bhi kehete hai
 These Sadani speakers are called Sadans
 sadaanon kii mul jati he naag jati
 When the rule of Nagajati or Nagavansha was established, its official language became popular in Nagpuri, Chhotanagpur
 nagpuri ke rajbhasha hone par jharkhand main basane vaali nagajati ke atirikt munda, khadiya, uraanv aadi kii yah sampark bhashaa arthath sarsaadhaaran kii boli ho gai he
 The former name of Nagpuri, Sadani, Sadri or Sadari, Gandwari has also been popular
 ab yah nagpuri naam par viraam paa gai he
 Father Peter Shanti Navrangi threw light on its emergence and development and raised the question that how did the Arya of Nagpuri Chhotanagpur lie in the midst of different dialects? Where did you come from? When did it come? 3 The first grammarian of Nagpuri Rev
 E
 H
 Whitley did not mention Nagpuri to any Aryan dialect
 to duusari ore nagpuri ke duusare samarth vaiyaakaran rev
 conrad bucout ne nagpuri ko magahi, bhojpuri, chhattisgadhi ityadi se milti-julati bataaya
 Nevertheless, it is a different language than these, which flourished and developed freely in the villages inhabited between the Aranya and the hills of Chotanagpur
 atah nagpuri kaa shuddh rup ab un gaanvon main hi surakshit he
 5 Father Navrangi has admitted that it is difficult to say that the ancient language of Nagpuria Sadani is the present form of any apostrophe dialect of ancient Prakrit or medieval
 is bhashaa ke sarvanaamon or kriyaaon ke koi-koi rup doorvarti rajasthani or nepali roopon se milte hai, kitne rup pracheen vaiswari or avadhi se sambandh dikhaate he, kitne rup to bangala or oriya kii chalit boliyaan ke rup se mail kha jate hai
 6 nagpuri bhashaa ke prakhyat vidwaan pro kesari kumaar ne bhi kaha he ki magahi or maithili kii tarah nagpuri bhi magadhi apbhransh se prasut or unheen kii tarah ek nishchit boli he jo bihari ke antargat aati he
 7 According to Dr
 Suniti Kumar Chaturjya, on the basis of the ancient material of Magadhi Prasut languages, linguists have concluded that Magahi, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Bangla, Oriya and Assamese all the local forms of the earlier Magadhi apabhramsa from the eighth century to the eleventh century
 The quantity must have met its requirements independently
 yah parthaky kis shatabdi se sampann hua iske sambandh main nishchit rup se kuch kaha janaa sambhav nahin
 We can say the same situation for Nagpuri
