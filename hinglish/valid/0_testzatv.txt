 Often the tribes or traditional tribes have a greater influence of exorcists and are considered a source of both religion and medicine
 ojha dharm aise dharm ko kehete hai jo ojhaaon dwaara hi chalaaya jaataa ho
 Exorcists have been seen in tribal societies around the world, including Siberia, Africa, Mongolia, Native American tribal societies, Japan, and India
 jahaan aadhunik chikitsa uplapdh nahin hoti vahaan aksar ojha hi upachaar karte hai, masalan bharat main parmparik rup se saanp ke kaate kaa ilaaj ojha hi kiya karte the

 The matter was presented before the State Reorganization Commission

 The second reason cited by the Commission in its report was the lack of support of the people in the movement

 However, the state still did not have a clear Punjabi majority, being a large Hindi speaking region

 This thing becomes very clear from the initial closure given in the following quotation
 : Judge-martyr ham bhi aaraam uthaa sakate the ghar par rah kar,hamako bhi paala tha maan-baap ne dukh sah-sah kar,vakte-rukhsat unhen itnaa bhi na aaye kah kar,god main ashk jo tapaken kabhi rukh se bah kar,tifl unako hi samaj lenaa ji bahalane ko! In his destiny, Ajal was the only one, the raj rakha was the hard worker, the gum was rakha, who cared and in whom it was rakha, When we had taken a step in wadi-e-gurbat, yad-e-watan came Was to explain! apana kuch gam nahin lekin e khyaal aata he,maadare-hind pe kab tak ye jawaal aata he,kaumi-azaadi kaa kab hind pe saal aata he,kaum apni pe to rah-rah ke malaal aata he,muntajir rahete hai ham khaak main mil jane ko!

Sirs do the sacrifice, they do whatever they have, they look at their mother, see where the food is deserted, they do it home! Be happy Ahle-watan! We travel, go and settle a wilderness! naujavaano ! yahi mauka he utho khul khelo,khidamate-kaum main jo aaye vala sab jhelo,desh ke vaaste sab apni jabaani de do,phir milengi na ye mata kii duaen le lo,dekhen koun aata he ye farz baja laane ko?

 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons

 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai

 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities
 aam nakaaratmak lakshanon main neeras yaa kunthit karne vaale prabhaav or manobhaav, bhashaa main kripanata, anand kii anubhuti karne kii aakshamata, sambandh sthapit karne kii ichha kaa abhaav or prerana kii kami shaamil hai
 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms
 kunthit karne vaale prabhaav kii upasthiti ke baavjood, haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki schizophrenia main aksar ek saamaanya yaa bhavukta kaa ucch str bhi paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se tanaavpurn yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke pratikriyaswaroop aisa hota he
 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication

 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that it has a high degree of heredity
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes

 The affected person has fewer children than normal people
 is prakaar kii kami 70% purushon or 30% mahilaon main dekhi gai he
 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the 
 ab iske kai udhaaharan maujuud hai ki janmpurv iske sankraman ke prabhaav main aa jane se jivan ke baad ke varshon main bhi schizophrenia kaa vikaas ho jaataa he, basharte isaki alaava udaahranon main utero pathology or is avasthiti ke vikaas ke jokhim ke bich ko kadi ho
 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls

 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe

 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true then it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: aushadhi vah padaarth he jin kii nishchit maatra sharir main nishchit prakaar kaa asar dikhaati he

 These are drugs that affect the spinal cord and brain
 inkaa prayog tantrikeey or maansik rogon ke ilaaj main kiya jaataa he
 For example, anti-epileptic drugs reduce epileptic seizures by decreasing the activity of the brain in the brain
 anti-psycotic aushadhiyaan sijophrenia jaise maansik rogon ke ilaaj main kaam aati hai
 Anti-depressant drugs eliminate the state of mental depression

 Geology is divided into two major classes: bhautik bhuvigyaan ke antargat khanij vigyaan, mrudaa vigyaan, sanrachanaatmak bhuvigyaan or bhuakritik vigyaan sammilit hai
 Historical geology incorporates layered rockology, paleontology and geography

 india get,, nai dilli ke rajpath par sthit 43 meter unchaa vishaal dwaar he
 It is the national monument of independent India, formerly called Kingsway
 iskaa dizin sar edward lutiyans ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The monument is inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris
 ise san 1931 main banaaya gaya tha
 Originally known as the All India War Memorial, this memorial was built by the British rulers to commemorate the 9 xxrep 4 0 Indian soldiers who were martyred in the First World War and the Afghan Wars by joining the British Army
 united kingdom ke kuch sainikon or adhikariyon sahit 13,300 sainikon ke naam, get par utkeern hai
 This monument made of red and yellow sandstones is worth visiting
 jab india get banakar taiyaar hua tha tab iske saamne george pancham kii ek murti lagi hui thi
 Which was later installed in the Coronation Park along with other sculptures from the time of the British Raj
 ab george pancham kii murti kii jagah pratik ke rup main keval ek chhatari bhar rah gayi he
 After India's independence, India Gate has become the site of the tomb of unknown soldiers of the Indian Army
 isaki mehrab ke neeche amar jawan jyoti sthapit kar di gayi he
 In the memory of the unnamed soldiers, a soldier's cap is decorated over a rifle, with a flame always burning around the corners
 is amar jawan jyoti par prati varsh pradhan mantri va teenon senadhyaksh pushp chakra chadhaakar apni shradhanjali arpit karte hai
 The names of thousands of martyred soldiers are engraved on the walls of India Gate and the top is written in English: dilli kii kai mahatvapurn sadaken india get ke konon se nikalati hai
 There is a fair-like atmosphere here at night
 1920 ke dashak tak, puraani dilli railway stesan puure shahar kaa ekmaatr railway stesan hua karata tha
 The agra-delhi railway line then passed through the construction site of the present India Gate located on Lutyens' Delhi and Kingsway, which is now named Rajpath in Hindi
 aakhirkaar is railway line ko yamuna nadi ke paas sthaanantarit kar diya gaya
 Subsequently in 1924, when this road started, construction of the memorial site could start somewhere else
 42 meter unche india get se hokar kai mahatvapurn maarg nikalate hai
 Earlier, a lot of traffic passed through India Gate
 parantu ab ise baari vaahanon ke liye band kar diya gaya he
 In the evening when the memorial is published, a large crowd of people gather in the grasslands around India Gate and on both sides of Rajpath
 625 meter ke vyas main sthit india get kaa shatbhujiya kshetra 306,000 varg meter ke kshetrafal main failaa he
 That umbrella located in front of the India Gate is still intact

 After India became independent, the government removed the idol from there and installed it in the Coronation Park

 Satyarth Prakash was written by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj
 yadhyapi unki maatrubhaasha gujarati thi or sanskrit kaa itnaa gyaan tha ki sanskrit main dharapravaah bol lete the, tathaapi is granth ko unhone hindi main rachaa
 It is said that when Swamiji met Keshav Chandra Sen in Calcutta in 1872, he advised Swamiji that you should leave Sanskrit and start speaking Hindi, there should be immense welfare of India
 tabhi se swami ji ke vyakhyanon kii bhashaa hindi ho gayi or shaayad isi kaaran swami ji ne satyarth prakaash kii bhashaa bhi hindi hi rakhi
 Swamiji was roaming all over the country and doing lectures and lectures
 isse unke anuyaayiyon ne anurodh kiya ki yadi in shastrarthon evam vyakhyanon ko lipibaddh kar diya jaay to ye amar ho jaayenge
 The creation of Satyarth Prakash was possible only due to the request of his followers
 satyarth prakaash kii rachana kaa pramukh uddeshy arya samaaj ke siddhanton kaa prachaar-prasar tha
 Along with this, there is a rebuttal of Christianity, Islam and many other texts and beliefs
 us samay hindu shastron kaa galat arth nikaal kar hindu dharm evam samskruti ko badnaam karne kaa shadyantr bhi chal rahaa tha
 Keeping this in mind, Maharishi Dayanand named it Satyartha Prakash, which sheds light on the true meaning
 samaaj sudhaarak swami dayanand saraswati kii is rachana kaa mukhya prayojan satya ko satya or mithyaa ko mithyaa hi pratipaadan karnaa he
 Although Hindu life takes place before both the individual and society, it is often seen among Hindus that there is more individualistic tendency than collectivist
 dhyaan main leen upaask ke sameep yadi isi samaaj kaa koi vyakti tadap bhi rahaa ho to vah use dhyanbhanga kaa kaaran hi samajhegaa
 It is never that he is also a part of the same society
 phir unnisvin sadi main angreji sabhyataa kaa bahut prabalya tha
 As a result of British propaganda, Hindus started to take pride in accepting their culture as hay and to blind the west
 bharatiyon ko bhartiyata se bhrasht karne kii maikale kii yojana ke anusaar hinduon ko patit karne ke liye angreji shiksha pranali par jor tha
 The foreign government and English society through their agent priests were spending crores of rupees to hoist the flag of Christianity from one corner of the country to the other
 hindu apana dharmik evam rashtriya gaurav kho chuke the
 144 Hindus were becoming Muslims every day and Christians more than that
 padri rangila krishna or sita kaa chhinala jaisi saikadon gandi pustikas baant rahe the
 Instead of answering these baseless allegations, the Brahm Samajis opposed the inverse nationality
 veda aadi kii pratishtha karnaa to dur, bhar pet unki ninda kii
 Swami Dayanand prevented these deadly tendencies through Arya Samaj and Satyarth Prakash
 unhone yahan tak likhaa - "swarajya main utpann hue hi mantri hone chaiye
 God is our king
 vah krupa karke hamako rajdhikari kare
 "along with this, he emphasized the love of the Aryan civilization and culture and reverence for the Vedas, Upanishads etc
, Arya Sanskritiya and traditions of India
 swa-samaaj, swa-dharm, swa-bhashaa tathaa swa-raashtra ke prati bhakthi jagaane tathaa tark pradhan baaten karne ke kaaran uttar bharat ke padhe likhe hindu dhire-dhire idhar khinchne lage jisase arya samaaj saamaajik evam shaikshanik kshetron main lokapriy hua
 Satyarth Prakash has fourteen Samullas
 isamen in vishyon par vichaar kiya gaya he - bal-shiksha, adhyayan-adhyaapan, vivaah evam grihasth, vanprastha, sanyas-rajdharm, ishwar, sristi-utpatti, bandha-moksh, aachaar-anachar, aryavartadeshiy matamtaantar, isai mat tathaa islam
 In relation to its language, Dayanand ji himself wrote in the second edition of this book in 1882 - "at the time when i made this book, at that time
 Due to the cultural speech and the language of birthplace, i have special knowledge of this language
 Neither was
 isse bhashaa ashuddh ban gai thi
 Now it has been printed for the second time by purifying it according to language-grammar
 " Its main messages are different from traditional Hindu customs and sometimes even against them
 ye is prakaar hai - As would be clear, Swami Dayanand's view was to refute many beliefs and opinions and to bring the Vedas opinion back into light
 isliye kai baar unhen prachlit hindu, jain, buddha, islamic or isai maton kii manyataon kaa khandan karnaa padaa
 Incarnationism, Shankaracharya was considered as the incarnation of Shiva, Rama and Krishna as Vishnu, the incarnation of the universal

 If the English text is in a different font, it can be kept unchanged
 balk conwarter dwaara badi aakaar kii filon ko tej gati se parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 Its only drawback is that it has support for limited fonts although the number of fonts supported can be increased by adding the changers of scientific and technical Hindi group
 sil conwarter main nimnlikhit fonton hetu samarthan he
 This is the list of Odia language TV channels in India: - shunagashep aitarey brahman main sthit ek aakhyaan he
 The gist of it is that until death comes, conversion does not happen
 yah aakhyaan maanviya lobh, beimaani or usase upar uthne kii kshamta kii katha he
 King Harishchandra was childless despite his hundred queens
 usne varun devtaa kii upasna kii ki agar mujhe putr prapti ho to pehla putr aapako samarpit karuunga
 He had a son, named Rohit
 lekin raja ne jaise hi putr ko sadeh dekha, uski niyat main khot aa gaya
 He kept avoiding talking of handing Rohit to Varuna Deity on some pretext
 pita kahin use sachmuch varun dev ko nahin arpit kar den, is dar se rohit jangal main bhaag gaya or harishchandr ne apana pran puraa nahin kiya, isliye varun ne use shaap de diya or vah biimaar ho gaya
 Luckily roaming around in the forest, Rohit brought a woman named Azigart to a poor Brahmin
 usase rohit ne apni kahani kahi
 Azigart had three sons - Shun: Pucha, Shun: Langul and Shun: Shep
 shun:shape manjhala putr tha or bachapan se hi bahut samajhadaar or vivekwan tha
 Azigart greedily tells Rohit that he is ready to sell one of his sons in exchange for a hundred cows
 us putr ko vah apane badale varun devtaa ko saunp kar apni jaan bachaa saktaa he
 Shun on the other hand: Shep thought, younger brother is mother's dear, elder brother is father's dear, if i go away, neither of them will have any regret
 isliye vah khud hi rohit ke saath jane ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Varun Dev was also no less greedy
 ve yah soch kar prasann ho gaye ki mujhe apane anushthan ke liye kshatriya balak ke badale brahman balak mil rahaa he jo shreshthatar he
 In the yajna, preparations for the male sacrifice began, four priests were called
 ab shun:shape ko bali stambh se baandhna tha
 But none of those four prepared for this, because Shun: Shep was a Brahmin
 tab ajigart or sau gaayon ke badale khud hi apane bachche ko yajna stambh se baandhne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 After this it was the turn to sacrifice Shun: Shep
 lekin purohiton ne phir manaa kar diya
 Who should kill a Brahmin? Then Azigart and also agreed to cut his son in exchange for one hundred cows
 jab shun:shape ne dekha ki ab mujhe bachaane vaala koi nahin he, to usne usha devtaa kaa stvan shuru kiya
 With each Richa, each bond of Shun: Shep broke, and with the last Richa, not only Shun: Shape was freed, but King Harishchanda also became cursed
 isi ke saath balak shun:shape, rishi shun:shape ban gaya, kyonki vah uske liye roopantaran kii ghadi thi
 According to some other scholars, Shun: The great ascetic born in the clan of Shep Kaushiko and the daughter of Vishwamitra's enemy Shambar was the lost child of Ugra, which Lopamudra hid near Ajitgarta due to fear of Bharato
 bharto ne ugr ko maar diya
 The mind and life of any human born in the Indian culture remains tied to the three quarters
 yah ek nirvivaad hakeekat he
 These three names are named - 1
 Putraksha, 2
 Finance and 3
 Lokaixa
 in teenon main se jo vitaishna he, vah manushya-jivan ke vyaavhaarik jivan se naata rakhti he
 And the Lokaैाaाa, it is related to the post mortal world, the heavens, which are derived from the Yāmāyāgadi, the pre-eminence
 parantu jo putraishna he, vah manushyamaatr kii pruthivilok par sadaiv bane rahane kii shaashvat evam saarvbhaum ichha kaa akatya ankur he
 And in such a daughter-in-law, both son and daughter are desired - this thing is logically implied
 lekin strideh kii prakritik maryaadaaon ke kaaran, strideh kii apeksha purushadeh sabal hone ke kaaran samaaj main purush kaa mahatva badhata gaya he or vishwa main bahushah samaaj purushpradhan aakaarit hota rahaa he
 Therefore, son-in-law has become enlightened in the mind of man
 atah aitareibrahman main aayi hui shunagashep kii jo katha he vah putraishna-grast janamanas ko ativ suchak rup se maardarshak banati he
 
 yadhyapi shunagashep kii katha ko adyavadhi duusare hi pariprekshya main dekhi jaati he
 Such as - whether there were malevolent yagas during Vedas
 shunamshepakhyaan main varunadevataa ko koi manushya kaa bali chadhaane kii baat aati he, is liye duniya bhar ke vidwaanon ne ek hi baat ko charchaa kaa bindu banaaya he ki vaidic yajna-yagadi main pashubali ke saath saath manushyon kaa bhi bali chadhaaya jaataa tha ki nahin
 - But in this narrative no human sacrifice is ultimately offered
 is ke kaaran punarvichaar kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 In the beginning of this Shunashekayakhana, King Harishchandraji has asked Narada that - both wise and ignorant people wish for their sons
 to mujhe yah bataao ki putr kii kaamana kyon kerani chaiye ? is jigyaasa kaa samaadhaan dete huye naradji ne kaha ki putr to param vyom main bhi jyoti-swaroop hota he
 On the other hand, at the end of this narrative, it is said that this story should be recited in the context of the coronation of any king, and whoever wishes a son, these people should also listen to this narrative
 shunagashep aakhyaan ke is upkram evam upsanhaar ko dhyaan main rakhte huye yadi dekha jaay to is aakhyaan main teen putron evam teen pitaaon kii katha prastut hui he
 As it is the case of the first father: - Harishchandra, the king of Ikshvaku dynasty, was ineligible even though he was a wife
 parantu in shat-sankhyak vivaahon ke peeche nishchit rup se, chaalak parible ke rup main putraishna hi rahi hogi
 Narada has explained in detail the benefits that come from having a son
 usko sun kar harishchandr varunadevataa se kisi bhi kimmat par putr kii yachana karata he
 Once a son is born and if he faces it, then he will be grateful
 or uske baad vah varun ko putr kii bali chadhaane ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Harishchandra got a son on this condition
 yahan prastut aakhyaan kii katha se malum hota he ki manushyamaatr main jo putraishna he, vah aadmi ko kadachi andhshraddha main duubo detii he
 a son is obtained by sacrificing to the gods - to believe it is an ignorance
 duusare str par yahan dekha jaataa he ki putr-prapti ke baad pita harishchandr mohandh bhi ho jate he or varun ko balidaan dene ke vaada se baar baar peeche hath karte rahete he
 Whenever Varun Dev comes to ask for sacrifice, then he keeps on pretending to give sacrifice to his son, showing one excuse after another
 jo doosraa pita he vah suyavas kaa putr ajigart he
 The poor person is suffering from hunger
 uske paas ashrith ke rup main unki patni or teen putr bhi he
 Being sold in an extraordinary and unavoidable crisis of hunger, he sells any of his sons in the market is not fair
 atah vah kutumb ke dhurin hone ke naate swayan hi bik jaay to vahi thik mana jaayegaa
 But "everyone loves their own soul more than all" - If this cruel truth is taken into consideration and thought again, the possibility of selling one of the three sons may be tolerable
 isi tarah se, mata-pita kii yugon puraani ek nirbalata bhi kubul kii jaay kii pita ko jyeshthaputra hi priy hota he or mata ko kanishthputra hi adhik priy hota he
 So the poor 'ascetic' Madhyamaputra definitely becomes the goat of sacrifice in such an odd situation
 is tarah, kshudharth pita ajigart raja harishchandr se so gaayon ko le kar, uske badale main ek putr ko bech de to vah kadachit – haan kadachit hi – anichhaa se nyaayik bataaya ja saktaa he
 But if the same father is ready to tie his son as a sacrificial animal, in the sacrificial fire of Harishchandra and ask for other cows for such a cruel act, then it will be said to be the result of greed
 aakhyaankar mahidas aitarey ne lobh kii paraakaashtha bhi bataayi he
 Father Azigart does not relent with his sinful act after tying up son Shunshape with Yup
 yajna main shunagashep kaa bali ke rup main jab tak koi vadh nahin karegaa, tab tak yajna puraa nahin hoga
 None of the chandals from the village is willing to come and kill a man
 atah shunagashep kaa pita ajigart lobhavshaat is paapakarm ke liye taiyaar hota he
 He asked for the third sleeping cows
 tathaa nirdayata-purvak apane hi putr kaa vadh karne ke liye nangi talwaar lekar uth chalata he
 - This picture reveals the iniquity of a greedy father
 darshanashastron main jo shad ripu ke rup main ginaye gayi he – kaam, krodh, mad, moh, lobh or matsar – unamem se uttarottar ripu kaa balwattar hona mana gaya he
 That is, Ripu named fifth greed is more powerful than the first Kamadi four ripu
 is drushti se dekha jaay to duusare prakaar ke pita ne lobhagrast hokar, keval pitrumaryada kaa hi bhang nahin kiya he
 But, by encroaching human dignity, he has gone far to the sinful path
 tisare pita ke rup main rishi vishwamitra he, jinke ek-so ek putr the
 In his leadership, it was certain to sacrifice Shunashep in a yajna
 unhone apane sammukh dayaneey dasha main bandhe hue shunagashep ko yagyeey-pashu ke rup main dekha he
 His pathetic pity and helplessness have also been seen every moment
 or vikat paristhiti main devon kii upasna kaa maarg pakadnevaala, swayan hi apana uddharak banakar mrityu-pash main se chhutne kaa prayaas karanevaala dhairyavan shunagashep unhon ne baariki se dekha he
 Prajapati, Agni, Savita, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Ashvinau, Indra and Usha - all Vedic deities are shown by Shunashep respectively from their mantras
 unase baatcheet bhi karata he
 Who would not like such a true Brahminputra sage? rishi vishwamitra ne aise shunagashep ko hi apni viraasat – gyanrashi – ko sambhalanevaala samajha
 or man hi man shunagashep ko apane putr ke rup main usko sweekaar liya
 Vishwamitra was a man of merit as a father
 unhon ne apane pratham pachaas putron ko bulaayen or shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne ko kaha
 But those sons did not obey the ancestral order
 atah vishwamitra ne un pachaason ko ‘ aputra ’ jaahir kar diye
 They were deprived of the right portion of sage wealth
 is ke baad, jo madhuchhnda naamak ikyanavaan putr tha or unke jo sabhi anuj the, unhon ne shunagashep ko apana jyeshtha bhrata maan liya
 Vishwamitra Rishi then proclaimed Shunasha Shep as "devrat"
 putraishna rakhanevaale manushyon ko chaiye ki ve pehele vishwamitra jaise gungnata pita bane
 Vishwamitra liked this mantradashtha Shunsha Shep as the best son, and accepted him as his son, as expected of his centuries - this is a big indicator
 yadi aisa putr mila ho to hi naarad ne jo kaha tha ki – “ putr param vyom main bhi jyoti hota he, ”- vah charitaarth ho saktaa he, anyathaa nahin
 In this narrative, it is necessary to compare the three fathers like King Harishchandra, the impoverished Azigart and the sage Vishwamitra, in the same way it is worth comparing three types of sons as well
 jaisaa ki – pahela he raja harishchandr kaa putr rohit
 He opposes his father's proposal and, after rejecting the paternal order, commits homicide to protect the life and wanders in the forest
 is ke baad pita ko jalodar naamak rog hua he – aisa sun kar, pitruvatsalya se prerit ho kar vah ghar waapas aane kaa nirnay karata he
 But on the way Indradev is found, comes in his words and he comes again and again in the direction of others and returns to the forest
 in shabdon se indra ne jo upadesh diya tha, iskaa fal yah aata he ki harishchandr ke putr rohit ko van-vicharan ke dauraan, teen putron ko saath main lekar ann kii talash main ghum rahe ek daridr pita ajigart mil gaya
 Being a Rajput, Rohit comes back to the palace on the insistence of Rajalakshmi, that is, on the insistence of father-earning, buying a poor and inferior son of a poor person
 rajkumaar rohit ne man main aisa soch rakhaa he ki is daridr-brahmanputra kaa bali de kar, varun ke pash se pita ko vah mukt kara legaa or apane aap ko bhi maut se mukti mil jaayegi
 Here, Rohit, who has been repeatedly wandering in the place of Indra, is introduced to Rohit, first as a son with an indecisive morale and later, as a Rajput son taking shelter of selfish and father-earning
 sansar main yah pehele prakaar kaa putr he
 
 sansar main jo duusare prakaar kaa putr hota he, vah rishi vishwamitra ke agraj 50 putron hai
 They do not obey even a mantra father like Vishwamitra
 pita kii vivekbuddhi kii avhelnaa karanevaale in putron ne paitruk-viraasat kho di or shaapit bhi huye
 As a result, they start living like dacoits in society
 ikyanavaan madhuchhnda naamak putr or unke anuj 50 bhratri-samooh ne pita kii ajna maan lee
 These sons, who believed in Vishwamitra's eyes, accepted Shunha Sheep as their eldest brother
 
 The third type of son who is always palpable is Shunhashep
 puure aakhyaan ko padh kar lagata he ki vah kshudha-peedit vyakti jarur tha, parantu nity vidya-vyasang karne vaala putr tha
 Because he was well aware of the mantras that have come in the fourth and fourth divisions of the Rigveda to get rid of Varuna's loop
 saath main vah swayan bhi, pratham mandal main sangruhit anek mantron kaa drashtaa rishi bhi he
 Hence, he becomes an intelligent son in the eyes of sage Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ko apane hi 101 orasaputra the
 But he regretted not having a mantra-seer son like Shunha Shep
 atah vah apane orasputron ko bula ke shunagashep ko jyeshtha-bandhu ke rup main swikaarne kii ajna detaa he
 According to him, only a son like Shun Shashep is collectible and palatable
 vishwamitra ne puri yajyakriya ke dauraan dekha he ki shunagashep sahi arth main devraat he
 Gods like Agni, Varuna, Indra, Ashvinau, Vishwadeva and Usha were his property - Rati - and on that he has achieved his salvation
 yahan par, shunagashep vidya-vyasangi hone ke kaaran amuk mantra jaanata he yaa naye mantra dekh saktaa he – itnaa hi kahana paryaapt nahin he
 He has even told his father's sin on his face
 arthath shunagashep satya kaa aparoksh darshan bhi kar saktaa he or pita ke sammukh khada rahe kar vah bataa bhi saktaa he
 That is his greatness
 aise satya ko bolne vaale ko hi varun pash se mukt karata he, duusare ko nahin
 Because Varuna is said to be the fettle god of the policy and the master of the ritual
 atah vah satyaniti ke drashtaa shunagashep ko bandhan se mukt kar detaa he
 Only such a son of truth can become a form of light for the fathers in the Supreme Vyom
 or aise putr kii hi kaamana rakhni chaiye
 That is, the son should also be controlled with discretion
 is tarah se shunamshepakhyaan kaa marmoddhatan ho jane ke baad, is aakhyaan kaa upsanhaar bhi turant samaj main aa jaataa he ki - 1
 kisi bhi raja ke abhishek-prasang main is aakhyaan kaa paath karwaane kii soochna kyun di gai he ?
 It is unfair to be blinded to get an heir to the state

 tathaev, putr kii ichha rakhanevaalon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa pathshravan karnaa chaiye – aisa jo upsanhaar main kaha gaya he vah bhi purvokt teen tarah ke putron ko thik se samaj lene ke liye hi he
 
 yahan aanushanbik rup se yah bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki is aakhyaan ke upakrmopsanhaar ko dekhte hue - “ vedakaal main narbali diya jaataa tha ki nahin ? ” jaisi charchaayen saare sansar main azdin tak hoti rahi he, parantu vah charchaa bhrantadisha main chal rahi he – aisa pratiti hota he
 Now, if seen from the innovative point of view, then the message of Shunshape to this world suffering from sexual harassment is that the opportunity has come to get rid of female murders

 Within a year of Padarohan, Abu Bakr ordered Khalid to mount 18,000 troops with a commander named Musanna to Iraq
 is sena ne irani shakti ko anek ladaaiyon main nasht karke babul tak, jo irani samrajya kii rajdhani madine ke nikat tha, apana aadhipaty sthapit kiya
 After this, Khalid traveled from Iraq towards Syria according to Abu Bakr and crossed the desert and joined 30,000 Arab soldiers and defeated 100,000 Bijantini forces in a place called Ajna Dain of Palestine
 kuch hi dinon baad abu bakr kaa dehanth ho gaya 
 In the regime, Abu Bakr followed the principles of poverty and ease propounded by the Prophet

 bhautikee main kaary hona tab mana jaataa he jab kisi vastu par koi bal lagane se vah vastu bal kii disha main kuch visthapit ho
 In other words, if a force is displaced in the direction of the force by applying a force, it is said that the force worked
 kaary, bhautikee kii sabase mahatvapurn raashiyon main se ek he
 The working rate is called power
 kaary karne yaa karaane se vastuon kii urja main parivartan hota he
 The work done if the object is displaced d distance in the direction of force by applying f force on an object hoga
 Example: 10 Newton's force is applied on an object in the south direction and if that object is displaced 2 m in the south direction, then the work done by the force is w = = 20 n m = 20 J
 kisi vastu par 5 newton kaa bal lagaakar use 4 meter visthapit karne par bhi 20 j hi kaary hoga 
 The unit of work is 'joule'
 ise sankshep main j se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 1 joule = 1 newton-meter
 kaary ek adish raashi he
 If a fixed force is applied on an object and it moves in a straight line, the work done can be extracted from the following formula- jahaan: But if the value of the force is not fixed and the displacement is not in one direction but in different directions, then in this case the vector product of force and displacement have to be integrated to extract the work volume

 Originally democracies are made up of a mixture of different principles, but voting is considered to be a characteristic feature of most forms of democracy
 loktantr kii paribhaasha ke anusaar yah "janata dwaara, janata ke liye, janata kaa shashan he"
 But the concept has become somewhat complicated due to the use of different perceptions in different countries and circumstances

 In representative democracy, the public directly elects government officials

 sach poocha jaae to aaj ke yug main loktantric hone ko daawa karnaa ek fishan sa ho gaya he
 It is difficult to give a completely correct and acceptable definition of democracy
 cranston ne thik hi kaha he ki loktantr ke sambandh main alag-alag dharanaen he
 According to Lancet's definition, "democracy is a political system that provides regular constitutional opportunities for office bearers to change and provides for a mechanism under which a large part of the population receives political charge
" Selecting from the interested contestants influences the decision making
 ” macmmersan ne loktantr ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘ek maatr aisa rachanaatantr mana he jisamen sarkaron ko chaynit or praadhikrut kiya jaataa he athwa kisi anya rup main kanoon banaae or nirnay liye jate hai
 According to Schupter, "democratic law is such an institutional system for political decision-making that serves the common interest by selecting the people who are ready to implement the common will of the people
" vastav main, loktantr multah naagarik or raajnneetik swatantraaa ke liye sahabhaagi raajnneeti se sambhddha pranali he
 The following are the main principles regarding the concept of democracy: loktantr kii udaaravaadi parampara main swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar, dharm nirpekshata or nyaay jaisi avadharanaon kaa pramukh sthaan rahaa he or udaaravaadi chintak aarambh se hi in avadharanaon ko moort rup dene vaali sarvottam pranali ke rup main loktantr kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Democracy was accepted as a natural political system from the point of view of governing the society after liberation from the natives and feudal lords
 macmmersan kaa kahana he ki paashchaatya jagat main loktantr ke aagaman ke pehle hi chayan kii raajnneeti, pratiyogi rajya vyavastha or market kii rajyavyavastha jaisi avadharanaen viksit ho chuki thim
 In fact in this sense, the liberal state was democratized and not liberalized

 Thomas Hobbes, in his book 'leviathan' advocating the dominant democratic principle, wrote that government is formed by the people under a social contract
 jon lock kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar janata ke dwaara or usee ke hit ke liye honi chahie
 Adam Smith presented the paradigm of the free market on the democratic basis that every person has the freedom to produce, buy and sell
 prasiddh upyogetavaadi darshanik mil or bentham ne puri tarah loktantr kaa samarthan kiya or upyogetavaad ke madhyam se ise prabhavi bauddhik aadhaar pradaan kiya
 According to him, democracy provides maximum protection to utilitarianism ie maximum happiness of the people, as people expect protection from their rulers and from each other and the best ways to ensure this protection are representative democracy, constitutional government, regular Elections, secret voting, competitive party politics and majority rule
 je
 es
 mil ne bentham dwaara loktantr ke paksh main prastut tark main ek or bindu jodate hue kaha ki loktantr kisi bhi anya shashan-pranali kii tulana main maanavjaati ke naitik vikaas main sarvaadhik yogadan karata he
 In his view, democracy is the supreme medium for moral upliftment and development and expansion of individual capabilities
 is sambandh main yah ullekhya he ki bentham or mil donon main koi bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar athwa ek vyakti ek mat ke pakshdhar nahin the
 By 1802, Bentham advocated limited suffrage and in 1809 gave the slogan of limited suffrage only to the homeowners of the affluent classes and eventually called for universal suffrage in 1817, but limited this right to men
 isi prakaar mil bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar ke paksh main nahi tha, kyonki use ashanka thi ki ek varg ke log bahusankhyak hone kii sthiti apana prabhutv kaayam kar sakate he or anya virgon ke hit ke viruddh sirf apane hit ke niyam-kanoon bana sakate hai
 Later, in his book Representative Government, he advocated more than one vote for some but not the non-tax payers, the illiterates, the insolvents, the non-tax payers, that is, all those who jointly belong to the working class
 Build, deprived of it
 vah sirf ek aisi pratinidhimulak sarkaar kaa himachati tha jo aadharbhoot samaantaaon main dakhsandaji nahi karti or mukt bazaar or hastkshep kii niti apana kar chalati he
 Later liberal thinkers continued to support democracy and Western Europe and North America worked to further its acceptance
 loktantrke sambandh main puraatan udaaravaadi mat ko samay-samay par anek vichaarkon dwaara chunautiyaan milti rahi hai
 First, questions have been raised on the notion of democracy that everyone knows what is best for them
 lord brice, graham vals ityadi vichaarak maanate hai ki manushya utana vivekshil, tatasth, jaankaar athwa sakriy nahin he jitna ki prajatantr ke sanchaalan ke liye use maan liya jaataa he
 Secondly, democracy rests on the cornerstone of public governance, but it is not easy to clearly state what exactly is the meaning of 'governance' and 'public'
 isliye sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main lokmat ek myth he
 Thirdly, democracy is expected to work for the common good, but there can be no such thing as general interest
 kisi bhi samaaj main saamaanya hit vibhinn logon ke liye vibhinn arth rakh saktaa he
 Fourthly, the archaic liberal theory ignores factors such as group psychology, mass oppression and accreditation and genocidal leadership
 panchmatah, loktantr main daleey pranali praayah abhijatya varg kaa khel ban jaati he athwa unke dwaara niyantrit hoti he jo saadhan sampann he or ve hi mahatvapurn muddon par nirnay lete hai
 Again, the policy-making process is also quite complex
 udaarvaadiyon ne anaavashyak rup se ise saral, paardarshee or nyaaysangat maan liya he
 And the biggest error in this theory is that it is based on political equality but economic inequality
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetik vichaarkon ne prashn uthaanaa shuru kiya ki kya jansadharan pratidin ke jivan main raajnneeti main koi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai? kya saamaanya nagarik, jo apane jivicoparjan main lage rahete hai, raajnneetik bhoomika nibhaane ke liye samay or shakti laga sakate hai? kya jansamooh bina kisi pratibandh ke chunavi loktantr ke madhyam se apni bhaawanaaon kaa khulaa pradarshan karata he to swatantraaa nasht ho jaaegi? in prashnon ke uttar main hi loktantr ke abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi siddhanth viksit hue hai
 The term eligibility is used for a minority of a group who have special status in the community due to certain factors
 yah alpsankhyak varg samaaj main satta ke vitaran main agrani bhoomika main hota he
 The political class, according to Presthas, consumes far more power in community affairs in proportion to its numbers
 prajatantr ke sabandh main abhijan siddhanth kaa abhyuday dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad hua is siddhanth ke pravarttakon main wilfredo parato, gretanomoska, robert michels or america lekhak james bernhaam tathaa si
 rhite mills pramukh hai
 The main basis of this theory is the belief that there are two types of people in the society - a few specific legs and a large population
 vishisht log hameshaa shikhar tak pahonchte hai kyonki ve sari arhataaon se sampann sarvottam log hote hai
 The elite class, especially the political elite, perform all political acts, monopolize power and enjoy all the benefits associated with power
 bahusankhyak samooh abhijan varg dwaara manamaane dhang se niyantrit or nirdeshit hota he
 The organized minority always governs and directs the unorganized population
 robert michels ne ‘alpatantr ke louh kanoon‘ jaisi ukti kaa prayog karte hue kaha he ki saamaanya virgon ko abhijan varg kii adheenta sweekaar kerani hi chahie kyonki jansankhya kaa ek vishaal bhaag udasin karmanya or swa-shashan main aksham hota he
 The main features of the eligibility principle of democracy are: loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kaa suvyavasthit pratipaadan sarvapratham joseph shumptor ne apni pustak ‘capitalism, socialism and demokrasi‘ main kiya
 Later Sartori, Robert Dal, Ixtaine, Raymond Aron, Carl Mann Hiemond, Sidney Verba, etc
 supported this view in their works
 loktantr kii yah avadharana is manyata par aadhaarit he ki jansankhya kaa vishaal bhaag aksham or tatasth hota he or vah yogyata or kshamta ke aadhaar par kuch logon kaa chunaav karata he jo raajnneetik dal kaa niyantrit or sanchalit karte hai
 Majority of the people are busy in earning a living
 unhen raajnneetik maamalon main na to abhiruchi hoti he, na samaj
 So they select a few people from the elite and become their followers
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 yah siddhanth logo kii atisahabhaagita ko bhi khatarnaak maanata he, kyonki taanaashaahee pravriti kaa hitler jaisaa koi taqatvar netaa satta praapt karne ke liye jansamooh ko lamaband kar loktantr ko hi khatm kar de saktaa he jiskaa sidhaa arth he moulik swatantraaaon kaa ant
 Therefore, he claims that in order to preserve democratic and liberal values, it is necessary to keep the masses separate from politics
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aam janata ke dwaara vaastavik shashan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Governance is always for the people, never by the people, because the people whom the people choose to represent belong to the elite
 duusare shabdon main loktantr kaa arth he abhijan vargon ke bich pratidwandvita or janata dwaara yah nirnay ki kaunsa abhijan upar shashan karegaa
 Thus, democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the leaders of the elite classes - political parties, leaders, big business houses, voluntary organizations And even a consensus among labor organizations is necessary so that the basic functioning of democracy is non-responsible
 Can be saved and leaders
 isse yah spasht hota he ki bahya taur par to abhijan varg siddhanth loktantr ke vichaar ko adhik vyavahaaravaadi or anubhavik banane kaa daawa karti he, lekin antat yah loktantr ko ek aise roodhiwaadee raajnneetik siddhanth main badal detaa he jo udaaravaadi athwa nav-udaaravaadi yathasthitwaad se santusht ho jaataa he or iske sthayitv ko banaae rakhana chahta he
 Eliteracy has been criticized by many thinkers, including C
B
 mcpherson, Graeme Duncan, Barry Holden, Robert Dal etc
 are prominent
 is siddhanth ke viruddh mukhya aapattiyaan nimnlikhit hai: The pluralistic principle of democracy also emphasizes the role of groups instead of the common people
 kuch vichaarkon ne loktantr sambandhi aise siddhanton kaa nirupan kiya he jo abhijan siddhanth or bahulwaadi siddhanth kaa mishran he
 But it is also true that the pluralistic theory has its origins as a partial reaction to the elitist theory
 abhijan siddhanth ek aisi sthiti ke nirmaan se santusht he jisamen satta aise abhijanvarg main nihit hoti he jo mahatvapurn nirnay letaa he, lekin bahulwaadi ek aisi pranali par jor detaa he jo udaaravaadi loktantr main abhijanwaad kii pravriti ko nishprabhavi kar degaa or sahi janaakanksha ko prakat karegaa
 The concept of pluralism is old, but it became an important part of modern liberal thinking in the twentieth century
 saamaanya arth main bahulwaad satta ko samaaj main ek chote se samooh tak simit karne ke badale use prasaarit or vikendrikrut kar detaa he
 In modern industrial and technological times, according to pluralists, power has fragmented and the participation of competing public and private groups has increased
 ucch sthanon par asin logon ke paas purv kii bhaanti satta nahin rah gai he, kyonki ve mukhya rup se paraspar virdohi swaarthon ke bich madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaane lage
 Different groups mediate through their leadership and through this the individual is also represented
 yadhyapi audyogic or praudyogic ekikaran or praudyogic abhiyaachanaon ke kaaran satta kuch hi vyaktiyon main kendrit ho gai he lekin alpsankhyak kintu vrihattar, hit-samoohon ke bich pratiyogita saarvajanik hit ke paksh main jaati he
 Competition between the big business houses, labor and government has kept each group abusing its power
 is prakaar, nagarikon ke bich sampatti, shiksha or satta main asamanta ko nimna prabhavit kar diya jaataa he kyonki sanghathan or samooh aashaa se adhik pratinidhitiv pradaan karte he or isse loktantr adhik vaastavik banataa he or is arth main adhik vyavhaarya bhi siddh hota he
 Take the example of India
 yahaan mahendra singh tikait kaa kisaan sanghathan or narmada bachaao aandolan aise jan aandolan hai jo lakhon garib or ashikshit logon kii awaz ban jate hai
 And definitely make democracy more real
 yah sahi he ki abhijanvarg or unke samachar media unki aalochana karte hai or unhen pragati kaa baadhak bataate hai or yada kada sarvocch nyaayalay bhi unhen apane aandolanon ko roak dene ke liye baadhya karata he, kintu is sab ke baavjood aise janandolan bhartiya loktantr ko adhik sarthak or pratinidhimulak banaate hai
 The pluralistic concept of democracy developed mainly in America
 iske pranetaon main es
 em
 linset, robert daal, ve
 presnts, epa
 hunter aadi pramukh hai
 He argues that political power is not as simple as it appears, it is divided between the elite groups including various groups, organizations, classes and associations which usually provide leadership to society
 vibhinn swaarth samooh apni maangon ko sidhe taur par to prastut karte hi hai, vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke madhyam se bhi pesh karte hai
 a definition of pluralistic democracy is given as follows
 yah ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jisamen nitiyaan vibhinn samoohon ke bich parsparik paraamarsh or vichaaron ke aadan pradaan ke dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he kyonki koi bhi samooh yaa abhijanvarg itnaa shashakt nahi he ki vah akele sarkaar par itnaa dabaab daal sake ki vah uski sari maangon ko puraa kar sake
 The pluralists approve of this partnership of power that it benefits that no social group can dominate the policy-making process of the government so that it can ignore the interests of other classes
 lekin, bahulwaadi siddhantakaaron kii ek manyata yah bhi thi ki sabhi nagarikon ko raajnneetik kshetra main apane hiton ko sanghatit karne or unhen saadhane ke liye vaidhanik avasar or aarthik sansaadhan praapt hai
 Without this opportunity, citizens cannot support or oppose any proposed move
 bahulwaadi vichaarak raajnneeti ko vyaktiyon ke badale samoohon ke bich nishchayon kii prakriya maanate hai or ghoshnaa karte hai ki loktantr sarvottam tareeke se tabhi kaam karata he jab naagarik apane vishesh hiton ke samarthak samooh se jud jate hai
 They emphasize that there should be active participation of individuals in a society and join different groups to implement their resolve
 saath hi, saare samoohon or unke sadasyon ko yah sweekaar karnaa chahie ki chunaav raajnneetik nirnyon main vishaal samudaay kii sahabhaagita kaa ek kargar hathiyaar he
 Similarly, all groups and members of the elite class make democracy possible through mutual competition
 isse spasht he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth vastav main abhijanwaad kaa purnatah virodh nahin karata kyonki iske pravartakon ke anusaar abhijanvarg kaa astitv ek hakeekat he or ve uski avasthiti se santusht he
 This is the reason that pluralistic theories are sometimes considered to be only partially different from elite principles
 mahaan america raajnneetik vichaarak robert daal loktantr kii abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi abhidharanaon ko sanyukt karte hue apni loktantric abhidharana ko bahutantr kii sangya detaa he
 According to him, the public is active through both groups and politicians of the elite
 usne anek aise samudaayon kaa hawala diya he jo sarkaar ke niti-nirdhaaran ko prabhavit karte hai- jaise, vyapaaree gharaane or udyogpati, saudagar, shramik sanghathan, kisaan sanghathan, upabhokta, matadaata ityadi
 It is not that their entire agenda is implemented
 saare samooh samaan rup se shashakt nahin hote or anek samooh apni manonukoolnitiyon ko manwaane kii apeksha pratikulanitiyon kii rokthaam main zyada prabhavi hote hai
 Among the objections raised against the pluralist doctrine are the following: raajnneeti kriyalap main sahabhaagita loktantr kaa mul tatva he, lekin khaskar poonjivadi loktantron main yah praayah chunaavon main matdaan tak hi simit rahata he
 The participatory principle of democracy considers augmented participation as an ideal as well as a practical necessity
 is siddhanth ke pramukh prastaavkon main 1960 ke dashak se carol perlman, si
 bi
 macmmersan or en
 polant jaas jaise vampanthi vichaarak pramukh rahe hai
 Following are the two salient features of participatory democracy: sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But this consumption is also possible only when the person is independent and equal
 yadi logon kaa vishwaas ho ki nitigat nirnyon main kargar sahabhaagita ke avasar vastav main vidyaman na hai to ve nishchay hi sahabhaagi banenge
 In such a situation, they will also be able to partner effectively
 jis loktantr main, chaahe vah raajnneetik ho yaa pravidhik yaa shilpatantric abhijanvarg kaa varchasv hota he vah nagarikon ke liye santoshprad nahi hota or amlog sahabhaagita ke dwaara hi us varg ke varchasv ko samaapt kar sakate hai
 Proponents of participatory theory also state that in today's industrial and technological societies, the standard of education has been elevated and the gap between elite and non-elite has reduced in a society rich in intellectual and political consciousness
 isliye kaaryakshmata or vikaas kii drushti se adhikansh maamalon main saamaanya logon kii sahabhaagita koi baadha nahin rah gai he
 Frankly speaking, the denuclearization of power is the strongest defense against tyranny
 sahabhaagita par aadhaarit loktantr hi nagarikon ko tatasthta, agyaan or algaav se bachaa saktaa he or loktantr kii buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The question is, how should the political participation of the common citizen? Its theorists have given the following ways: macmmersan kii tippanee he ki aaj ke raashtra kshetra or jansankhya kii drushti se vishalkay hai or yah sambhav nahin he ki saare naagarik rosemare ke raajnneetik vimarsh yaa niti nirdhaaran main shaamil hon, phir bhi yadi kuch sharto ko sweekaar kar liya jaae to sahabhaagita kaa anupaat nishchit rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa ha
 These conditions are: david held ne sahabhaagita siddhanth par aapatti uthaate hue kaha ki yah puraatan / abhijan bahulwaadi jaise siddhanton se behatar to he, lekin isse yah spasht nahin ho paata ki kaise or kyon sirf sahabhaagita maanviya vikaas, jo loktantr kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshya he, ke ucchtar str ko praapt kar sakegi
 There is no evidence or rational basis that participation will make citizens more cooperative and committed to the common interest
 held is kendriya manyata ko bhi aavashyak rup se satya nahin maanata ki aam log apane jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par niti nirdhaaran karne or nirnay lene main adhik uttaradaayi bananaa chaahate hai
 If they do not want to participate in the determination of socio-economic matters and policies, then it cannot be considered appropriate to force them
 phir bhi maan liya jaae ki aam log apane loktantric rujhaan ko yadi ek seemaa se aage le janaa chahen or buniyadi swatantraaa or adhikaar ke maamle main dakhlandaji karne lage to loktantr kaa kya hashr hoga, aise prashnon par sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon ne paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Cook and Morgan, the realization of participatory democracy is not as easy as it seems on the top
 udaahranarth, sahabhaagi ikai ke samyak aakaar or krity kya hon phir, nagarikon kii sakriy sahabhaagita ke bal par sthaneey staron par liye gaye nirnyon ko sampurna raashtra ke hit ke saath kis prakaar samanvit evam samekit kiya jayega? ek sthaneey sahabhaagi ikai ke nitigat maamle duusari ikai ke virdohi bhi to ho sakate hai
 Then there is one thing that decisions taken on the basis of maximum possible participation are not necessarily the most effective decisions
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthak kaaryakshmata evam prabhaav ke muddon par paryaapt dhyaan nahin dete
 Contrary to popular belief, the idea of democracy has also been accepted by Marx and later Marxist thinkers
 itnaa avashya he ki unki loktantr-sambadhi abhidharana paashchaatya udaaravaadi loktantric abhidharanaon se purnatah bhinn he
 Since the Marxists believe that the democratic right in the capitalist system is not in the true sense, but only in the hands of the resource-rich class, they want to establish a democracy that is 'public democracy'
 marxvaadi loktantr main utpaadan ke sadhano par swaamitv ko khatm karne or sarvharavarg dwaara arthvyavastha ko niyantrit karne ke pashchaat samaajawaadee loktantr kii sthapana hoti he
 Marx was a critic of liberal constitutional democracy because according to him the basis of capitalist democracy is an economic system in which the means of production are always under the control of the capitalist class
 yahi puunjipati varg apni dhan-shakti ke bal par raajnneetik vyavastha kii niyantran main rakhkar sarkaar or rajya-tantra ko apane adheen rakhata he
 State power, rights and privileges rest solely with the same class and the working class only has the freedom and rights of name
 rajya kaa adhikari varg, nyaayalay or police bal bhi tatasth na hokar prabhutasampann varg ke hi hit sadhak hote hai
 Therefore, democracy takes the form of a system of governance which is used to promote the power and privilege of the ruling class and to serve the interests of the upper class
 iske baavjood, marks or angels ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki sampann puunjipati varg dwara niyantrit udaaravaadi burjua loktantr bhi kisi had tak apane nagarikon ko vaastavik adhikaar dene ke aitihaasik daawey kar saktaa he or shramik varg iskaa istemaal apane ko sangathit kar sarvhaara kii kranti ke liye kar sakate hai
 In liberal democracies, the common franchise can be used to set the background of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat
 marxvaadi yah avashya maanate hai ki kuch sthitiyon main hinsak krantikari aandolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he lekin aisi sthitiyon kii sambhaavna atyalp he
 Even if the parliamentary route is adopted to meet the goal of socialist revolution, it can only be an additional tool in other types of conflicts
 marxvaadi vishleshan ke anusaar vaastavik loktantr sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko kaayam karne ke liye sarvharavarg kii kranti ke pashchaat hi sambhav he kyonki udaaravaadi bujuar loktantr kaa adarsh pratibhagita kaa ho saktaa he, lekin yatharth main saadhanheen shramik varg kii sahabhaagita usamen nahin ho paati
 In his work The Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx and Engels wrote in a clear explanation of their concept: 'between capitalist and communist societies lies the period of conversion of one into the other
 isi se mail khaati ek raajnneetik sankraman kii avadhi bhi hoti he jisamen rajya sarvhaara varg ke adhinayakawad or samyawad main bhed kiya he
 They consider it an intermediate period
 isaki parinti samyavaadee samaaj kii sthapana main hoti he
 It is important to understand in what sense Karl Marx and Engels used the term totalitarianism
 unki drushti main prayek rajya shaasha saamaajik varg kaa adhinayakawad rahaa he
 In the capitalist system, this class belonged to the thriving industrial and merchant bourgeoisie, while the state with its own concept would be a state controlled by the proletariat immediately after the revolution and then the process of socialist reconstruction would begin which would end in the establishment of a classless society
 isliye, unki drushti main loktantr or sarvhaara adhinayakawad ek hi saath chalenge, thik vaise hi jaise ki poonjivadi vyavastha main udaaravaadi loktantr vyavharytah loktantr bhi or udyogpatiyon evam vyapaarik gharaanon ke burjua varg kaa adhinayakawadi shaasha bhi
 Therefore, Marx and Engels said that the system after the revolution and the hegemony of the working class would be the system of 'people's democracy'
 janata se unka taatpary muththibhar sampann burjua ke sthaan par jansamanya kii vishaal aabaadi se tha
 The following are the salient features of 'people's democracy' as propounded by Marx: samaajawaadee samaajon kii rachana ne marxvaadi vichaaron ko or aage badhaayaa, lenin jisane rus main 1917 main pratham samaajawaadee rajya kii sthapana kii ne marxvaadi chintan kii nai vyakhyaayein prastut kii
 He accepted the totalitarianism of the proletariat and emphasized its importance of socialist revolution, but he also added with it that the totalitarianism of the proletariat can be exercised only by a large proletarian organization or communist party
 usne loktantr kii teen avasthaaen bataaiah poonjivadi loktantr, samaajawaadee loktantr or samyavaadee loktantr
 According to him, democracy is a form of state and in a class-divided society, the government is both totalitarian and democratic
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power
 lenin sweekaar karata he ki nav sthapit samaajawaadee rajya utana hi damanaatmak hota he jitna ki poonjivadi rajya
 It is also necessary to implement the rule of the proletariat
 chunki burjua kaaphi shaktishaalee hota he, isliye samaajawaadee loktantr ke aarambhik daur main sarvhaara varg ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he ki vah balpurvak poonjivadi varg kaa unmoolan kar de
 The dictatorship of the proletariat has two goals: lenin ke anusaar yah kaary mukhya rup se samyavaadee dal ko karnaa padataa he
 Thus, in Lenin's view, capitalist democracy does not have true democracy, whereas proletarian authoritarianism has more secular democracy, as it is the rule of the majority proletariat
 uskaa yah bhi daawa tha ki antatah sachche samyawad kii prapti ke saath loktantr anaavashyak ho jayega, kyonki us samaaj ke sandarbh main iskaa koi arth nahin rah jayega
 After Marx, Engels and Lenin, many thinkers have presented many interpretations of Marxism
 inamen edward bernstin, karl kotski, rojaa lukjamvarg aadi pramukh hai
 Edward Bernstein claims that Marxist interpretation of capitalism is wrong and totalitarianism of the proletariat is neither necessary nor desirable
 uske anusaar, raajnneetik loktantr or udaaravaadi swatantraaaen adhik mahatvapurn he
 Lenin does not believe that authoritarianism of the proletariat is necessary
 bernstin kaa tark he ki jab tak sarvhaara varg bahumat hasil nahin kar letaa, samaajawaadee kranti asambhav he or yadi vah bahumat hasil kar letaa he to adhinayakawad kii jarurat hi nahin rahati
 According to him, democracy is necessary and socialism can be established only by combining democratic tradition with Marxist socialist theory
 marxvaadi krantikari rojaa lakjamberg ne lenin kii loktantr- virdohi niti ke sambandh main aapatti uthaate hue kaha he ki isse vishaal janasamudaay kaa adhinayakawad nahin, vishaal janasamudaay par adhinayakawad sthapit ho jaataa he
 • The majority of the population, which is the purveyor of the non-elite, is largely non-committal, lazy and indifferent, so it is necessary to have a minority that provides leadership
 • abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 • loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 • According to the proponents of participatory theory, democracy is the real meaning of equal participation of every individual, not merely to keep the government stable as the elitist or pluralist ideologues assume
 sachche loktantr kaa nirmaan tabhi ho saktaa he jab naagarik raajnneetik drushti se sakriy hon or samuhik samasyaon main nirantar abhiruchi lete rahen
 Active participation is necessary so that the major institutions of society have adequate exchange and political parties have more openness and sense of responsibility
 • sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 • Democracy is a form of state and government is both totalitarian and democratic in a class-divided society
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power

 Hatha Yoga Pradipika is its major book

 Other types of yoga are - Mantri Yoga, Laya Yoga, Raja Yoga
 hathyog ke aavirbhaav ke baad pracheen 'ashtaang yoga' ko 'rajyog' kii sangya de di gai
 Shaivism has been the main stream of Hatha Yoga practice
 yah sidhon or baad main naathon dwaara apanaaya gaya

 gorakhnath ke anuyaayi pramukh rup se hathyog kii sadhana karte the
 He is also called Nath Yogi
 shaiva dhara ke atirikt baudhon ne bhi hathyog kii paddati apanaayi thi
 People's belief about Hatha Yoga is that the word 'hatha' is used in the sense 'prachanda' or 'bal' with the suffix + Hatha
 hathen yaa hathaat kriya-visheshan ke rup main prayukt karne par iskaa arth balpurvak yaa prachandta purvak, achaanak yaa duraagrahpurvak arth main liya jaataa he
 'hatha Vidya' is accepted in the feminine sense of the science of 'forceful meditation'
 is prakaar saamanytah log hathyog ko ek aise yoga ke rup main jaanate hai jisamen hath purvak kuch shaareerik evam maansik kriyaayein kii jaatin hai
 For this reason, the hexa activities of body refinement which are different from the processes of normal body refinement are considered as Hatha Yoga
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Shatkarma is only a means of purification of the body
 In fact, Hatha Yoga is one of the four branches of Yogic science, elaborated as the pre-step of attaining Raja Yoga by balancing body and mind
 sadhana ke kshetra main hathyog shabd kaa yah arth beej varna ha or tha ko milakar banaaya hua shabd ke arth main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 In which there are many meanings of ha or ha and ch or ch
 udahranarth ha se pingala naadee dahini nasika tathaa tha se ida nadee bonyi nasika 
 Eda negative energy strength and balance of positive power power and etc
 in donon nasikaon ke yoga yaa samanta se chalane vaale swar yaa madhyaswar yaa sushumna naadee main chal rahe praan ke arth main liya jaataa he
 In this way, the sum of h and t means from the dimension of life
 is prakaar kii pranayam prakriya hi ha or tha kaa yoga arthath hathyog he, jo ki sampoorn sharir kii jadta ko sapreyas dur karata he praan kii adhikta naadee chakron ko sabal evam chaitanya yukt banaati he ore vyakti vibhinn shaareerik, bauddhik evam atmik shaktiyon kaa vikaas karata he
 Broadly, Hatha Yoga or Pranayama is done in three parts - is prakaar sapreyas praanon ko apane niyantran se gati dena hathyog he
 This hatha yoga forms the foundation for the accomplishment of Raja Yoga
 bina hathyog kii sadhana ke rajyog kii prapti bada kathin kaary he
 Therefore, if the practice of Hatha Yoga is proven, it is easy to move towards Raja Yoga
 upanishad chaar prakaar ke yogon kaa varnan, chaar prakaar ke sadhana-sampradaayon ke anuroop karte he, ye he- Maharishi Patanjali's yoga philosophy comes under Raja Yoga
 is mat main chitt vritti ke nirodh ko hi yoga mana gaya he
 The path of worship is also the transformation of Raja Yoga, which has been described in the Ishwar Pranidhan Sutra with the word 'ishwar Pranidhan'
 vartmaan samay main prachlit shakt, shaiva, vaishnav aadi sampradaay ishwar pranidhan naam ke yoga se gruhit hote hai
 The commentator of this Patanjal Yoga Sutra, Shri Ved Vyas Ji has tried to explain it in the following way- bhoj ne bhojavritti main isaki vyakhya nimnlikhit prakaar se kii he- That is, Godless element without Kaleshadi has been said in the scriptures by many names, so it cannot be given a single noun
 isliye vyas bhashya main kaha gaya haih- Therefore, by creating the names of Shiva, Vishnu, Mahashakti etc
 and the Puranadi texts with their names, the trend of Tattadbhavana bhavati-bhakti Yoga has been done by Maharishi Vyasa
 jeev ishwar kaa hi ansh he tathaa ansh main kaleshaadi ke rahane par yoga kii sthiti nahin ban sakati he
 For this it is necessary to remove the tribulation
 karmo ke anuroop vyakti sharir grahan kar bhaavana bhashit hota he
 These feelings are of sattvic, rajasic and tamasic type
 in alag-alag swaroopon kii bhaawanaaon ke saamanjasy hetu yogon ke prakaar bhi pruthak-pruthak ho jate hai
 Mental emotion is the root for making actions, actions and actions
 karm kaa swaroop ek dikhaai dene par bhi maansik bhaavana main antar hone ke kaaran unke swaroop tathaa parinaamon main bhi antar aa jaataa he
 This fact has been stated in the Maitrayasupanishad as follows - arthath manushya kaa man hi bandhan evam moksh dono kaa hi kaaran banataa he
 Being enamored in subjects leads to bondage and salvation if not enamored in subjects
 shrimadbhagwat gita main bhi paanchave adhyay ke gyarahawein tathaa atharahawein adhyay ke pandrahaven sutara main ukt tathy ko nimnlikhit prakaar se spasht kiya gaya he- That is, the Karmayogi only by sensory, mind, intellect and body also abandon attachment and perform actions for purification of conscience
 manushya man, vaani or sharir se shastranukool athwa vipareet jo kuch bhi karm karata he unke ye paanchon kaaran hai
 In this way, the practice of generating karma and controlling the mind is the soul, and the skill of controlling the soul by gaining control over the mind is hatha yoga
 hathyog ‘‘shaareerik or maansik shuddhi tathaa santulan praapt karne kaa saadhan he‘‘
 According to Agama, Nigam, Upanishads and other texts related to yoga science, the word hatha is formed by the combination of two mantras
 iskaa aashay manushya sharir main sthit pranavahi naadiyon ida evam pingala ke sambandh se liya jaataa he
 In the flow of Eda and Pingala, the mind remains calm
 atah man ko antahmukhi karne hetu praan ko sam arthath na to ida or na hi pingala main pravaahit hone dena he, balki in donon ke madhya sthit naadee jise sushumna kehete hai praanon kaa pravaah hone par man shant evam swaniyantran main ho jaataa he
 Hatha Yoga in the above context refers to the sum by which the balance between these two powers can be established
 ida nadee hamaare sharir kii ek pramukh pranic vahika he
 It symbolizes the passive aspect of Prana which is expressed and felt in the form of Manashakti or Chittashakti
 pingala kaa sambandh or shakti, tejasvi shakti yaa sakriyata se he jo shaareerik aayam main pranashakti ke rup main abhivyakt or anubhoot hoti he
 In this way, Hatha Yoga is related to the pranic flow of the body
 praanon ko niyantran kii sadhana paddati se he
 For this reason Hatha Yoga is also called 'pranayoga' in the Vedas
