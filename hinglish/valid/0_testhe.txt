 vastav main, yahi kaaran tha jiske chalate in dinon purvi deshon ke saath pashchimi desh sambandh kaayam nahin kar sake
 Not only this, in the latter part of the fifteenth century their remaining merchant routes were also blocked
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki 1453 i
 main turk jati kaa ek mahaan vijeta muhamd dwitiya ne kustuntuniya par adhikaar kar liya or unke vyapaarik maarg ko band kar diya
 Nevertheless, these inconveniences also led to the struggle of Western travelers and businessmen and to some extent established relations with China
 mongol shaasha yuan jab tak jivit rahaa tab tak china se videshiyon kaa kuch-na-kuch sampark avashya kaayam rahaa
 But as soon as it died, it seemed that now their mutual relations would end
 lekin ming samraaton ne is sambandh ko purnjivit kiya or pashchimi deshon kii ore unmukh hue
 As time passed, the merchants of western countries could not forget the economic prosperity of the eastern countries
 marcopolo kii diary unke liye prerana-strot hi ban gayi thi faltah pandrahavin sadi ke ant or solahavin sadi ke armbh ke bich in yatriyon kii yatra punah hone lagi or unka vistaar bhi hone laga
 At this time, the Spanish, Dutch and Russian castes helped to advance relations towards the eastern and northern regions of Asia
 spain or portugal ne prerana paakar colombo naamak prasiddh yatri ne bhi yatra kii or sudur purv ke deshon main pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya
 The Portuguese arrived in Macao in 1511 AD and came directly to Chinese soil in 1514 AD
 chiniyon ne in portugaliyon ko asabhy tathaa dukhadaayak mana
 They permanently resided in Macao
 china ke prasiddh bandargah canton ke nikat hi yah makaao avasthit he jahaan aajkal bhi acchhee sankhya main portugali nivas karte hai
 At this time the British also came to China
 jab mig vansh kaa shashan samaapt ho rahaa tha or manchu samraat shashan prarambh hone vaala tha, britain ke angrej china aa dhamke
 He became the most influential in China and received the credit for opening the door of China to trade in Western countries
 in vibhinn jatiyon ke aagaman kaa kramik adhyayan karnaa aavashyak prathit hota he
 In East Asia, the caste that first arrived during the reign of the Ming dynasty was Portuguese
 1498 i
 main vascodigama ne africa ke samudr tateey kshetron kii yatra karte hue bharat-bhoomi par apane pairon ko rakhaa portugal yatri vascodigama ko is yatra se laabh hua ki pashchimi deshon ke logon, ko pradhantah tatkaal main portugijon ko, purvi deshon tak pahunchaane ke maarg kaa pataa lag gaya
 Therefore, his departure and expansion now started in other countries as well
 16 veen sadi ke prarambh main hi malakka par adhikaar karne ke samay ve china pahunch gayi
 He reached China in 1514 AD
 china aate hi ve vyapaarik kaaryon main sanlagn ho gayi
 Traders here started buying luxury items from China and selling them in Western countries where there was a demand for cosmetics
 lekin portuguese apane vyavhaar se chiniyon ko prasann nahin kar sake
 Their behavior and habits were not good, not only were the Portuguese bad, other castes also had similar habits
 spain ke log jab america pahunche tab vahaan kii moulik jatiyon kaa jivan bhi unke chalate atyant kshtprad ho gaya
 The people of Spain did not leave America even after being opposed and built settlements there and settled regularly
 niyamit rup se basate hi ve american logon ke dharm, samskruti rahan-sahan vagairah main hastkshep karne lage
 Not only this, along with the construction of settlements, he also oriented towards colonization; in this connection the Spaniards also reached China
 portugijon ke baad spanish hi china aaye
 The people of China were familiar with the kind of action this caste had done in America
 isliye china kii dharti par upnivesh-nirmaan kaa beej liye jaise hi is jati kaa aagaman hua, vaise hi chiniyon ne inkaa virodh karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Ming government even started a vigorous movement against this caste
 yahi kaaran hua ki america kii tarah china main spain waalon kii daal nahin gal saki
 They could neither maintain their existence in China nor could they build the desired settlements
 portugijon se bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam ho gayi the
 This relationship could not be established with them
 phir bhi spanish jidd ke pakke the
 The way they started living forcefully in America, they also tried to stay in China
 inkaa ek jattha china ke prasiddh bandargah canton main thahar gaya or china se vyapaarik sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas karne laga
 Finally, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, he succeeded in his work and started to build his settlement in Macao
 isi samay pashchim kii anek dharmik mishnariyaan bhi china aayin
 In China, these missionaries started propagating religion
 prarambh main in mishnariyon ke vyavhaar achche the, lekin baad main unki swarthpurna niti se china ke log parichit hue
 At the same time, the British and Dutch also arrived in China
 lekin yahan yah baat yaad rakhni chahie ki mingvansh ke shashan main china kaa pashchimi deshon se do prakaar ke sambandh kaayam hue-ek vyapaarik sambandh or doosraa dharmik sambandh
 The countries of the west traded the plots of the south with Macao and Canton
 pashchim ke vyapaaree china main apane deshon se anaaj sambandhi anek paudhe tathaa tambaaku laae
 These people promoted tobacco a lot
 inhen ke chalate china ke adhikansh log tambaaku kaa seven karne lage
 Similarly, his religious relationship with China was also maintained
 china ke bhitari ilaakon main pashchimi deshon kii mishnariyaan dharm-prachaar kaa kaary karti thi
 After the Mongols rule, Christians in China had come to an end and their influence began to decline
 lekin mingvansh ke shashan ke antim varshon main roman cathalikon ne in isaayiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon ko punarujjivit kiya
 At the same time, people from xxwrep 4 France, Agustinian, Jusite, Dominion, etc
 many religious sects reached China
 solahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hi jesuit sampradaay kii pradhanta china main kaayam hone lagi
 The popular promotion of this community was Francis Xavier, who tirelessly and tirelessly tried to popularize this community in South and East Asia
 isi prachaarak ne na is sampradaay kaa prachaar china main bhi kiya
 In fact, the cult was able to survive in China only due to Xavier
 abhi jevisarya ko apane kaary main puri safalataa bhi nahin mili thi ki 1556 i
 main vah sansar se chal basaa
 After his death, the work of his work was carried by Methihar Rikki on his shoulders
 ricki italy kaa nivasee tha
 Rikki's genius was multi-faceted to increase the popularity of the Jesuit community
 vah jyotish tathaa ganit kaa prakand vidwaan tha
 Historians speculate that at present there was no such scholar of astrology and mathematics in China who could equal Rikki
 apane pratibha ke chalate hi usne china sahitya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 This was a completely new subject for Chinese literature Rikki, yet due to his studies and talent, he gained a lot of prestige among Chinese litterateurs
 apane dharm kaa adhyayan to use tha hi, usne canfusius ke dharm tathaa isai dharm kaa kaaphi gaharaa adhyayan kiya or donon dharmon kii samanta tathaa asamanta ko ek vidwaan ke rup main rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He made his residence in Peking, the capital of China
 isi samay philippine se spanian bhi china aayaa
 By now many Western castes had come into China
 1516 i
 main portuguese aa gayi the, 1575 i
 main spanish aa gayi the; dachon kaa aagaman 1604 i
 main hua tha or angrej 1637 i
 main aaye the
 But by this time the Americans and Russians could not come
 ching shashan-kaal main inkaa aagaman bhi china main ho gaya
 The rule of the Ming dynasty came to an end in 1644 AD
 uttar main manchu naamak vijetaon ne ming ko parrast kiya
 Manchu was a resident of Manchuria
 sohalvin sadi ke uttararddh tathaa satrahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main unhone apane ko shaktishaalee bana liya or ming se mukden apahrit kar liya jo unki rajdhani bhi thi
 They also made Mukden their capital
 china main rahanevaale mongolon ne bhi ichha yaa anichhaa se manchuon ke shashan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Manchus attempted to extend their state-limits to the southern wall of China
 isi samay jab china main ming ke viruddh asantosh kii bhaavana kaa janm hua tab mauka paakar manchuo ne peking par apana adhikaar kar liya or tabhi se ve china main shashan karne lage
 Kangxi and China Lung were the most powerful kings of this dynasty
 dirghakaal tak manchuo ne china par shashan kiya
 Westerners also came to China in Manchukaal
 agar sach poocha jaay to yah maananaa padegaa ki isi kaal main china main paashchaatya deshon ke prabhaav kii jad jamani prarambh hui or isi kaal main videshon se china kaa vaastavik sambandh kaayam hua
 During this period people from abroad came from both the place and both routes
 samudr ke raste se portuguese, spanish, french tathaa angrej or kuch italian tathaa german aaye
 At the same time, American traders also came to China in 1784 AD
 jameen ke maarg se keval rus ke log aaye jo china main chaandi kaa vyapaar karne lage
 Also signed a treaty with foreign states in China at this time
 is sandhi ke dwaara rus ko peking main ek mishan bhejne kaa adhikaar mila
 Russian missionaries also started working in Peking
 america or rus se yah sambandh china ke liye mahatvapurn siddh hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived in China at this time
 atharahavin sadi ke china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of Christians in China had grown to 300,000
 1793 i
 main sarvapratham angrejon kaa ek mishan china aayaa
 The mission came to China under mccartney's leadership
 doosraa mishan 1816 i
 main peking aayaa
 It was led by Lord Amherst
 isi samay rabart morishan ke adheen bhi ek mishan china pahunchaa
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, now the Protestant missionaries started their work in China
 protestent log chiniyon ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unhen asabhy samajhate the
 Dutch missionaries also visited China and their first mission reached China in 1795 AD
 isi prakaar 1806 i
 main rus kaa ek doot aayaa
 But China did not show any sympathy towards him
 peking main france ke jemuit bhi pahunche or manchu samraat kii gaurav-gaatha gane lage
 Among the various missionaries, the most clever and influential British proved to be the missionaries of the British
 china main aayi vibhinn mishnariyon se agar angrej mishanri kii tulana kii jaay to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main hi angreji mishanri sabhi se aage nikal gayi
 The reason for this was that the British were very clever and hard-working
 apni vyapaarik kushalta tathaa raajnneeti chaturata ke chalate unhone anya mishnariyon ko pratiyogita main aage nahin badhane diya or bhavishya main china main ve apana prabhaav kaayam karne main samarth hue
 It is clear from the above description that the relationship between China and Western countries was established and by the nineteenth century, many foreigners and their missionaries had become visible all over China
 lekin vah sambandh shantipurvak aage na chal sakaa
 People's government of China gradually began to hate these foreigners and their missionaries
 unka vichaar tha, ki paashchaatya deshon se sampark badhaane par china kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti nasht ho sakati he, isliye china ne paashchaatya pravritiyon kaa anubhav kiya or unase pruthak rahane kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after coming into contact with Western countries, he adopted his dress, religion and customs
 yahi kaaran tha ki manchu sarkaar khule rup se in paashchaatya deshon se pruthak rahane kaa prayaas karne lagi is baat ko drushti main rakhkar samraat kangehsee ne ek rajkeey vijyapti nikaali or china-pravesh se in jatiyon tathaa mishnariyon ko vanchit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The emperor had his own sentiment behind this communique, but at the same time he had to remove this communion to satisfy the people of China
 china kii janata in videshiyon se ghrinaa karne lagi thi or yah sambhaavna kii jane lagi ki china main khun-kharabi bhi ho sakati he
 There was considerable dissatisfaction in China, especially from foreign missionaries
 ‘‘mishanri ke vibhinn adeshon ke bich jhagade, purvajon kaa aadar karte hue kuch dharm pravartit logon kaa samrat ke hukum kii manyata tathaa saath hi naye dharm kii pravriti ke prati unke afasaron ke pratinidhitiv ke dwaara unki satta kii nunata ne dhire-dhire bhraamak vichaaron ke prachaarak ke vaastavik charitra ke prati unki ankhen khol deen
 But it should be remembered that according to this release, foreigners who came to China were not evacuated from China
 keval un par yaa vibhinn deshon se aaye hue vyapaariyon par ek prakaar kaa niyantran rakhane kii baat kahi gayi
 The Manchu government of China had feared that if these merchants were not allowed to trade, they would try to spread unrest by spreading all over China
 isliye is vijyapti main yah spasht kar diya gaya ki ye videshi vyapaaree china ke sabhi tatavarti bandargahon se shantipurvak uchit vyapaar kar sakate hai
 The happiness of foreigners was not open as soon as they were allowed to do business, because they got this permission in a very easy manner
 isse unka utsaah or hausala donon badha
 As a result, due to lack of meaning, these people also started doing illegal business
 ve un vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa bhi durupyog karne lage jo unhen praapt hue the
 Naturally the attention of the Chinese government was again attracted to him
 isiilie manchu vansh ke duusare samrat chien lug ne 1757 i
 main ek duusari vijyapti nikaali jiske chalate vaideshik vyapaar ko china main simit kar diya gaya or vyapaariyon par anek prakaar ke pratibandh lagaaye gayi
 According to this release, these foreign traders were allowed to trade with only one port of southern China
 iske atirikt china main ek vyapaarik dal kaa sanghathan kiya gaya jise ‘ko-hang’ kaha gaya
 Foreign traders could trade with China only under the consultation and supervision of this team
 is tarah atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main un vyapaariyon kii chaal par china kii sarkaar ne ek paini drushti rakhi or yah spasht kar diya ki ve vyapaarik maamalon ke liye kisi anya bandargah kaa daura nahin kar sakate hai
 But this release did not have any special effect on foreign traders
 vyapaar ke saath-saath china kii raajnneeti par bhi inkaa hastkshep hona prarambh ho gaya or isai mishnariyon ke kartrutv to or bhi adhik bure hone lage
 While doing business with Canton, he also started trading with other ports of China
 chiniyon ko opium kaa seven karakar unki aadaten buree banane lage
 Due to the habit of eating opium, traders wanted to get economic benefits by selling opium
 jab opium ke bure parinaamon ko china kii sarkaar dekhne lagi or is vyapaar par roak lagaayi, tab videshi vyapaaree china ke aphisaron ko ghoose dekar apni ore milaane lage or chori chhipe yah vyapaar chalata rahaa
 The British of England were very pathetic in this task
 opium ke chalate china ko do prakaar ke nuksaan hone prarambh ho gayi
 On one hand, the British benefited from increased opium sales, but China had to suffer economic losses
 doosraa yah ki china kii janata kaa naitik dharaatal neeche girane lage
 As a result, the government tried to control the opium trade with full rigor resulting in opium wars in China and Britain
 is yuddh main china safal nahin ho sakaa kyonki uske dushmano ke paas shaktishaalee or kendrit sarkaar thi or china kaa shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore, the Chinese government was weak and decentralized to face these enemies
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china katai taiyaar nahin tha
 '' is tarah anek varshon ke baad unnisvin sadi tak china ke saath videshiyon kaa sambandh kaayam hua
 The consequences of this relationship proved extremely bad for the Chinese
 yah sahi he ki inhen videshiyon ke chalate china main rashtriyata kii bhaavana aayi, lekin jabatak videshiyon kii daal galati rahi ve china main apane samrajyavad ke vikaas kaa pratyan karte rahe
 Indian historian Mr
 Pannikar is of the view that China suffered more from the benefits of contact with Western countries and after five-six years of the First World War, the pride of China kept getting dusty, political integrity kept breaking and administrative persistence Could not be brought aadhunik china China gained dominance over Central Asia as it overtook the Central Asian countries in martial arts, but at the same time began to weaken before European powers

 After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China became politically fragmented, albeit a recognized but genuinely powerless government set up in Beijing by the international community

 Kuomintang was founded in the last years of 1920 by Chiang Kai-shek who reintegrated China and declared the nation's capital as Nanking and implemented a "political patronage" determined by Sun Yat-sen for China's political development The intermediate star of the program undertaken was to make China a modern and democratic nation

 If looked at from a historical point of view, many subjects come under the quantitative analysis, such as tabular, probability, topography etc
 But now each of these subjects has created a space for itself
 ab to sanchayik vishleshan ke antargat keval ve hi prakaran aate hai jinamein kisi na kisi sthal par is baat kaa vichaar kiya jaae ki kisi samasya ke hal karne kii kitni vidhiyaan hai, athwa koi kaam kitne prakaar se ho saktaa he
 Example 1
 - Suppose there are four seats on the berth of a train compartment with the following numbers lying on it: maan len ki hamaare paas yatri k or c hai, to prashn yah he ki in do yatriyon ko shayika par kitne prakaar se baithaaya ja saktaa he
 It is clear that the first passenger a can sit on any of the four seats
 is prakaar k ko baitaane kii chaar vidhiyaan huin
 Suppose we put a on the pedestal number 1
 ab c ko baitaane ke liye teen asana bache
 Therefore, f can be placed on any of the three postures
 at: k ko kisi ek asana par baitaane par c ko baitaane kii teen vidhiyaan hui ore k ko baitaane ke chaar prakaar hai
 Hence 4x3, ie 12 methods of seating both a and f took place, or say there may be 12 sets of methods of seating a and methods of seating F
 isliye is vishay kaa naam sanchayik vishleshan padaa
 The above methods are shown in the table below: udhaaharan 2 - teen ankon, 1, 3, 8, main se koi do lene se kitni sankhyaayein ban sakati hai? spasht he ki nimnlikhit sankhyaayein banengi : The number of these numbers is 6
 yah sankhya 6 kahan se ai? udhaaharan 1
 kii bhanti tark karne se pataa chalegaa ki prashn kaa uttar 3x2 arthath 6 hi hoga
 In this example, it is assumed that no digit will be taken again, otherwise the three numbers would have been 11, 33, 88 and got to be 9 means
 sa vibhinn vastuon main se dha vastuen lene se kitne vinyas ban sakate hai? maan len ki hamen in dha sthanon One has to fill with one item
 pehle sthaan ko bharne kii sa vidhiyaan hai, kyonki sa vastuon main se koi bhi ek lekar ham ukt sthaan par baitha sakate hai
 When one place is filled with one object, then we have things left to fill another place
 at: doosraa sthaan bharne kii vidhiyaan huin
 Thus, the methods of filling both the first positions were done
 isi prakaar prayek pag par ek gunankhand badhata jayega or ant main dha sthaan bharne kii nimnlikhit vidhiyaan praapt hongi : Putting c = 4, d = 2 gives the answer of Example 1
 = 12
 isi prakaar sa=3, dha=2 rakhane se udhaaharan 2
 kaa uttar 6 aa jaataa he
 These configurations are called permutation and the above result is written as follows: ab maan len, udhaaharan 2
 main hamaara prashn yah ho ki teen sankhyaon 1, 3, 8 main se kitne prakaar se ham do sankhyaayein chun sakate hai, jo iskaa yah arth hua ki is chunaav main ankon ke kram kaa koi vichaar nahin hoga
 Therefore, 18 and 81 will not be considered different from each other in this election
 spasht he ki keval teen chunaav honge :- In the technical language we would say that there would be only three accumulations of this type
 sa vibhinn vastuon main se dha vastuen lene par kitne sanchay ban sakate hai? For the illustration, suppose that we take the four letters k, f, t, t in place of c = 4, d = 3, and things, then it is clear that taking three of these letters, ie 24, will form permutation
 in 24 kramachayon main se koi ek kramchay, le lijie
 From this accumulation of three letters, we can form permutation, ie 6: isi prakaar prayek sanchay se 6 kramchay banenge
 Thus, the number of accumulations = / 6
 isi prakaar vyapak drushtaant main prayek sanchay se anek kramchay banenge
 If each cache contains d letters, then the above accumulation will form as many permutations as those configurations will be formed by mutual manipulation of d letters, ie d

 It is the second holiest city in Islam and is the burial ground of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and is historically significant due to his coming home after his Hijrah
 islam ke aagaman se pehle, madina shahar 'yasarib' naam se janaa jaataa tha, lekin vyaktigat rup se paigambar mohammad dwaara naam diya gaya

 After marriage, Darnley moved from his home in England to Mary to Scotland
 lekin is vivaah ne elizabeth ko chintit kar diya kyonki darnle or mairi donon hi uski buaa margaret ke vanshaj the or isaliye england ke singhaasana par donon kaa samuhik daawa zyada prabhaavshaalee tha or jinke bachche angrezi singhaasana ke prabal or pramukh daavedaar ho jate
 However, Mary's persuasion for marriage was more influenced by her attraction to Darnley than political multiplication for power
 angrej rajdoot nicholas throcomorton ne kaha tha ki kaha ja rahaa he ki rani mairi nishchit rup se sammohit ho chuki hai or is vivaah ko ab hinsa ke dwaara hi roka ja sakta he

 Initially, Mary felt that many of the lords had accepted and supported her marriage with Bothwell, but Bothwell, who had now become the queen's husband, and his position was elevated from the other ministers in the court and Relations with the courtiers began to become bitter
 yah vivaah logon ke bich behad alokapriy ho gaya tha
 Catholics considered marriage illegal because they did not consider Bothwell's divorce and marriage to Protestant customs proper
 protestant or catholic donon ko hi is baat kaa yakeen nahin tha ki mairi apane purv pati ke hatyaropee se shaadi kar lengi
 The marriage brought a storm in Mary's life and she was very disappointed and frustrated
 26 darbari va samant jo kii scotland main vibhinn shaharon yaa riyasaton ke swami the mairi or bothewel ke khilaaf ho gayi or unke khilaaf sena banane lage
 Mary and Bothwell were confronted by these feudatories at Carberry Hill, but there was no war because many soldiers of Mary's army escaped during the settlement negotiations and their numbers were greatly reduced

 inamen shaadi ke do anubandh patr the, or 14 panktiyon kii ek prem kavita thi jo ek raja francis 2 kii muhar se susajjit ek foot lambey chaandi ke sandook main pai gayin thim
 Mary is ignorant of these letters and says that following her authorship is not a difficult task to write the same and there is no signature on the letters so they are false
 in chitthiyon ko behad ahm mana gaya kyonki iname mairi ke darnle ke katl ko lekar aatmaglani kii bhavanaayen varnit thim
 The Duke of Norfolk, the chairman of the investigation team, considered these letters to be very serious and fierce and of many different kinds of loving songs, and sent copies of them to Elizabeth stating that Mary was guilty if they were real
 sandook ke in patron kii pramanikta itihaaskaaron ke bich vivaad kaa vishay rahi he

 Authors of biographies of Mary, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, conclude that the letters were either completely fake or that some deliberate passages were added that could become evidence against Mary
 yaa phir in patron ko kisi or shaks ne bothewel ko yaa phir mairi ne kisi or shaks ko likhaa tha
 Guy says that the language of the letter seems to be different from each other and that there are so many grammatical mistakes in sentences and paragraphs written in French that one cannot expect to be educated and knowledgeable in French like Mary

 mairi ko jail bhejne or rani pad se vanchit karne kii kaarywai ko sahi tehraane ke liye in chitthiyon ko kabhi saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya
 Historian Jenny Wormald believes that the Scottish not making these letters public and destroying them in 1584 indicates that there was strong evidence against Mary, while Weir thinks that the events indicate that the Scottish feudal who was Mary's They were opposed, they spent so much time making these letters
 haalaanki mairi ke samakaleen kuch aise vyakti bhi hai jinhone in chitthiyon ko dekha tha or wo inaki sachai par yakeen karte hai jaise kii norflock ke duk jisane sunwaayee ke dauraan mairi se shaadi karne kii gupt yojana banaai thi lekin elizabeth ke dwaara iskaa zikr kiye jane par yah kehete hue isse isse inkaar kar diya ki vah aisi mahila ke saath shaadi karne ke bare main nahin sochataa he jiske saath rahane kaa abhi kuch nahin pataa
 Most of the people of the investigation team considered them right after studying the contents of these letters and matching them with the handwriting of Mary
 elizabeth ne apane chahat ke anusaar jaanch khatm karte hue faisla diya ki mairi yaa uske virdohi scottish saamanton ke khilaaf kuch bhi pakke saboot nahin hai or kuch bhi sabit nahin hota
 For political reasons, Elizabeth did not want Mary to be guilty of Darnley's murder nor innocent, and she did not want to go through the judicial process in this regard
 isaliye is jaanch ko sirf ek rajnatik shigupha hi samajha gaya
 Eventually Morey returned to Scotland and Mary was imprisoned
 is tarah se elizabeth scotland main vahaan kii rani se naahi mitrataa or naahi shatruta pradarshit karte hue ek protestant sarkaar banaae rakhane main kaamyaab raheen
 In Fraser's opinion, this was one of the strangest cases in history in which nothing was proved against both the plaintiff and the defendant, but one was allowed to return to Scotland while the other was held captive
 26 janvari 1569 ko mairi ko tutbari kile le jaaya gaya
 And kept under the supervision of George Talbot and his wife
 elizabeth ne angreji sihansan ke liye mairi ke vichaaron vakaaryon ko apane liye khatra mana or isaliye unhe shrevsbari ke mehalon main bandi bana ke rakhaa
 All these forts were off the border of Scotland and away from London
 mairi ko apane nizi sahaayak va sevak rakhane kii anumati thi jinaki sankhya 16 se adhik rahati thi
 His chambers were decorated with new paintings, decorative items and mats
 unke kaksh main unka rajasi kapadaa jisapar fransisi main mere ant main meri shuruyaat he gutha rahata tha bhi hameshaa susajjit rahata tha
 His servants took care of him, changing sheets and clothes daily by washing and making 32 dishes of his choice which he would serve in silver utensils
 unhen kadi nigaraanee main kabhi kabhi baahar bhi nikalne diya jaataa tha
 He spent most of his time in sewing embroidery
 vyaayaam kii kami, baahar kam nikalne or anya agyaat vajahon se unki tabiyat kharaab hoti gayi, swasth girtaa rahaa or 1580 aate aate unke ghutanon or jodon me dard rahane laga tha
 Overall, it can be said that Elizabeth did not put him in jail, gave him all the royal facilities, but took away his freedom and kept him under detention in various forts in trust of his trusted people
 may 1569 main elizabeth ne mairi ke scotland vaapasi ke liye rasta nikaalane ke liye vahaan protestant dharm kii suraksha va vistaar kii guarantee maangi jise scotland ke perth main yojit ek sammelan main sire se khaarij kar diya gaya
 Norfolk continued to make strategies for marrying Mary, angered by which Elizabeth imprisoned her in the London Tower from October 1569 to August 1570
 agle varsh kii shuruyaat main more kii hatya ho gai va saath hi saath catholicon ke netritv main scotland va uttari england main vidroh shuru ho gaya
 This rebellion of Catholics led Elizabeth to think that Mary could become a proverb for them
 angrej senaaon ne scottish grihayuddh main hastkshep karte hue more samarthak vidrohiyon ko ekajute kiya
 Meanwhile, Elizabeth keeps an eye on Mary with the help of her detectives
 1571 main elizabeth ke mantriyon, cesil or valsingham ne ridolphi shadyantra kaa pardaafash kiya jiskaa uddeshy spani sena or norfott ke duk kii madad se elizabeth ko hataakar mairi ko england kii rani banvaanaa tha
 Norfolk was given the death penalty, and the British Parliament proposed legislation repealing Mary's claim to the English throne, which Elizabeth rejected
 mairi ko badnaam karne ke liye landan main sadook kii chitthiyon kaa mudran or vitaran kiya gaya
 Many such incidents continued to keep Mary at the center
 pope gregory 13 ne 1570 ke purvardh main ek yojana banaai jisamen mairi kaa vivaah spain ke raja philip 2 ke nazaayas bhai or ek praant ke rajyapal austria ke don jon se karne kaa prastaav tha jo spani sena kii madad se netherland kii taraf se england par akraman kii aguwai karne vaala tha
 Following the Throckmorton Conspiracy of 1583, Walsingham proposed to enact a Queen's Protection Act which had legal clauses to punish any of the conspirators against Elizabeth, and to prevent any fictitious heir from gaining the throne by taking advantage of Elizabeth's murder
 farvari 1585 main wiliam peri jo ki ek jasoos tha ko elizabeth kii hatya kaa shadyantra rachate hue giraftaar kiya gaya
 Mary was not aware of this, but her representative Thomas Morgan was involved in the case
 isse elizabeth ko laga ki mairi apane vafaadaaron kii madad se unki hatya karne kii sajeesh rach rahi hai
 In April, Mary was closely supervised by Sir Amias Paulette and at Christmas she was transferred to the Cartley Fort
 11 agast 1586 ko babington shadyantra main doshi paae jane par mairi ko giraftaar kar ke tiksial ke sarkari bhawan le jaaya gaya
 In a successful attempt to prove Mary guilty, Welsingham deliberately made arrangements to get Mary's letters out of Chartley's residence
 mairi ko bataaya gaya ki unki chiththiyaan surakshit haathon main hai lekin vaastaviktaa main vailsingham ne unka kuta khoj liya tha or vah unhen padh letaa tha
 It was clear from these letters that Mary had approved Elizabeth's murder plan
 unhen chaar dinon kii yatra par photheringhe kila le jaaya gaya or oktober main unpar rani suraksha kanoon ke tahat 36 nyayadhishon ke saamne, jinamein se ek vailsingham khud tha, deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya
 In her defense, Mary denied these allegations
 unhone apane virodhiyon ko kaha He pointed out to the judges that he was not even allowed to examine the evidence presented against him, he was not given the liberty to plead and as a foreign queen, he should never be tried for treason under the justice system of England

 Despite this, Elizabeth was reluctant to give him the death penalty

 Elizabeth asks Paulet, the last protector of Mary, if he can find a more illegitimate way to reduce her age than to punish Mary, which she refuses, saying that her conscience does not allow her to do so He does not want to leave a black spot in the name of his descendants
 1 farvari 1587 ko elizabeth ne mrityudand ke aadesh par hastakshar kar diye or apane darbari wiliam davisan ke supurd kar diye
 On 3 February, 10 members of the court of England were summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge and immediately decided to emulate the sentence
 photheringhe main 7 farvari 1587 kii shaam ko mairi ko unhen agali subah mrityudand die jane kii soochna de di gai
 He spent the last hours of his life praying, distributing his personal belongings to the people and writing his last wishes and letters addressed to the King of France
 phaansi kaa takhte ko great haul main banaaya gaya, yah 2 feet unchaa kaale rang main ranga hua chabutara tha
 There were 3 stools, one Mary, and the other two for the Earls of Shrewsberry and Kent who were about to sit to watch the punishment
 chabutare par ek takiya tha jisapar mairi ko jhuk kar baithna tha or sir lakdi ke saanche main fansaana tha
 The executioners bowed down to Mary and apologized
 mairi ne jawaab diya main tumhen puure dil se kshamaa karti hoon, main ummid karti hoon ki ab tum mere saare dukhon kaa ant kar doge
 Her servants Jane Kennedy, Elizabeth Curl, and the executioners helped Mary to land royal clothes, jewelry and other royal marks

 Kennedy blindfolded them and a gold shawl mounted on a pillow placed in front of the white blanket

 Mary's head was not separated from the torso in one stroke and the executioner was able to separate her head in the second blow
 kate hue sir ko uthaate hue chillaaya god seve da queen yani "ishwar rani kii raksha karen"
 At this time Mary's head fell down and the wig was left in the executioner's hand, indicating that Mary's hair was very short and brown in her final years
 kaha jaataa he ki mairi kaa paaltu kutta unke paas hi khada tha or khun main bhigane ke baad usne vahaan se jane se inkaar kar diya va apane maalik ke mrit sharir ke paas hi baitha rahaa
 At the last minute, the jewels, clothing, and other related items worn by Mary, with their blood sprinkled on them, were burnt in the chimney of the Great Hall so that future relics could not be found by memorials to find them
 jab yah soochna elizabeth ke paas pahaunchi to wo behad cruddh ho gayin or kaha ki davidson ne warrant darbariyon ko dikhaakar unke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii he or darbariyon ne bina unki marzi ke yah kaarywai kii he
 However, Elizabeth's uncertainty, back and forth, and ambiguous instructions saved her to some degree from the accusations of Mary's murder
 davisan ko giraftaar kare ke main daal diya gaya
 After Cecil and Welsingham pleaded and were not found guilty, he was freed from prison after 19 months

 His body was excavated in 1612 at the behest of his son and the new King of England, James I, and was buried respectfully in front of Elizabeth I's tomb in Westminster Abbey

 But all his other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia and Prince Rupert of Aine and the children of Queen Anne, were found in the tomb of Mary's grave
 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as "more objective 


 free from the excesses of adulation or attack" that had characterised older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B
 Cowan also produced more balanced works
 Historian Jenny Wormald concluded that Mary was a tragic failure, who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her, but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post-fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen
 There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell
 Such accusations rest on assumptions, and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as "almost complete fantasy"
 Mary's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy

 Aristotle described two types of political revolutions: maanav itihaas main anekon krantiyaan ghatit hoti ai hai or vah paddati, avadhi va prerak vaicharik siddhant ke maamle main kaaphi bhinn hai
 Due to their results, there were major changes in culture, economy and socio-political institutions
 ek kranti main koun se ghatak shaamil hote hai or koun se nahin, is sambandh main vidvattapurna charchaa kai muddon ke ird gird kendrit he
 Early studies of revolutions have primarily analyzed European history from a psychological point of view, but more modern trials also include global phenomena and include the perspectives of many social sciences, including sociology and political science

 The first political use of the term was in 1688 by William III to describe James ii's replacement

 Most often, the term 'revolution' is used to indicate a change in socio-political systems

 Second-generation theorists wanted to develop detailed theories about the causes and times of the early revolutions, which was rooted in more complex social behavioral theories

 The second group, Chalmers Johnson, Neil Smelser, Bob Jessoup, Mark Hart, Edward A
 Tiryakian, composed by academics such as Mark Hagopian, followed Talcott Parsons and the structural-procedural theory of sociology; He observed that society as a whole is in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems

 Finally the third group, consisting of Charles Tilley, Samuel P
 Huntington, Peter Emman, and Arthur L
 Writers such as Stinkokoumbe, followed the path of political science and relied on polytheistic theory and interest group conflict theory
 ye siddhanth maanate hai ki yah ghatnaayen do pratispardhaatmak hit samooh ke madhya adhikaar sangharsh kaa parinaam hai
 In this type of model, revolutions occur when two or more groups fail to agree in a simple decision-making process, which is traditional for any political system, and at the same time they have an army appointment to pursue their goals
 Adequate resources are available for duusari peedi ke siddhantavaadiyon ne dekha ki krantiyon kaa vikaas ek dohari prakriya he; pehle, vartmaan avasthaa main kuch parivartan aisa parinaam dete hai jo bhootkaal ke parinaamon se bhinn hai; doosraa, nayi avasthaa kranti ke ghatit hone ke liye ek avasar pradaan karti he
 In such a state, an event which was not sufficient to cause revolution in the past, is now enough for it - although if the authorities are conscious of such dangers, then even in this stage, they can stop the protest
 krantiyon se sambandhit anekon praarambhik adhyayanon ne chaar moulik muddon par kendrit hone kaa prayaas kiya- prasidd evam vivaad rahit udhaaharan joki vastav main krantiyon kii sabhi paribhaashaon ke liye sateek he, jaise ki glorious rivolushan, francisi kranti, 1917 kii roosi kranti or chini kranti 
 However, the famous Harvard historian, Crane Brinton, in his famous book "the Anatomy of Revolution" focused on the English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution
 samay ke saath, vidvan anya saikadon ghatnaon kaa vishleshan bhi kranti ke rup main karne lage or unki paribhaashaon va paddatiyon main antar ne nayi paribhaasha va spashtikaran ko janm diya
 Second-generation theories have been criticized for their limited geographical spread, difficulties of empirical verification, as well as the fact that although they explain some particular revolutions, they do not provide any explanation that under these circumstances other societies Why did the rebellions not happen in India? duusari peedi kii alochana ke kaaran siddhanton kii teesri peedi kaa janm hua, jisame theda scockpaul, barington moore, jeffri pej or anya lekhak shaamil the joki pracheen marxvaadi varg sangharsh madhyam ke aadhaar par vistaar kar rahe the, vah apana dhyaan gramin krishi rajya sangharsh, ucchwargeey logon ke saath hone vaale rajya sangharsh or antarrajiya aarthik va sainya pratispardhaa dwaara gharelu raajnneetik parivartan par padane vaale prabhaav kii ore kendrit kar rahe the
 In particular, Skokpaul's States and Social Revolutions became one of the most popular works of the third generation; Skoukpaul, while explaining the revolution, said, "it is a rapid, fundamental transformation of society's states and class structure
" 

joki nimna str ke varg aadhaarit vidrohon ke dwaara samarthit va sweekrut hota he" or unhone krantiyon ko rajya, ucchvarg or nimna varg se sambandhit vibhinn sangharshon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraaya
 From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly works began to question the efficacy of third generation theories
 puraane siddhanton ko bhi nayi krantikari ghatnaon ke dwaara khaasaa aghat laga jo unke dwaara saralata se vyakt nahin kiya ja sakaa
 In 1979, the Irani and the Nrikguan Revolutions, the Manpower Revolution in the Philippines in 1986 and the Autum of Nations in Europe in 1989, witnessed the fact that multi-class coincidences demolished many powerful seeming regimes in popular demonstrations and mass strikes in non-violent revolutions
 
 ab kranti yaa vidroh ko europea hinsak avasthaa banaam janata yaa varg sangharsh ke rup main paribhaashit karnaa paryaapt nahin tha
 Thus the study of revolutions developed in three directions, first, some researchers were applying previous or updated structural theories of the revolution in relation to events that were not previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts
 Secondly, according to scholars, in order to shape the revolutionary mobilization and goals in the form of ideological beliefs and culture, more attention was needed to the conscious institution
 teesraa, krantiyon or saamaajik aandolanon, donon hi kshetra ke vishleshkon ne yah anubhav kiya ki donon tathyon ke bich kaaphi kuch ubhaynishth he or vivadpurn raajnneeti ke ek nae 'chauthi peedi' ke sahitya kaa vikaas hua joki donon tathyon ko samajhane kii aashaa main saamaajik aandolanon or krantiyon donon ke hi parigyanon ko jodne kaa prayaas karata he
 Although the revolutions, ranging from the Communist Revolution which was relatively peaceful and which overthrown the Communist regime, to Afghanistan's violent revolution, also included under the Revolution, it was able to cover the Copse d'etitas, the Civil War, the rebellions and such treason
 Does not include those who do not make any attempt to authenticate or transform society into rights or The Civil War), as well as institutional arrangements such as plebiscites and free elections, as the peaceful transition to democracy through, it was after the death of Francisco Franco in Spain also does not incorporated within the revolution
 saamaajik vigyaan or sahitya main krantiyon ke anekon bhinn varg vigyaan hai
