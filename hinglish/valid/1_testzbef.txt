 Depends on the subjects: First, whether the Government of India considers the foreign citizenship of India as true citizenship and on this basis the right of diplomatic protection by another country ceases; and second, whether the individual's own country recognizes it and Accepts India's rejection

 6 inhen bhi dekhen7 sandarbh8 or padhein9 bahari link Cornelia Sorabji was an Indian woman, the first female graduate from Bombay University, the first woman to study law at Oxford University, the first female lawyer in India, and the first woman to practice law in India and the UK
 2012 main, landan ke linkan in main unki pratimaa kaa anaavaran kiya gaya tha
 She was also a social reformer and writer
 15 navambar 1866 ko nasik main janmin carnelia 1892 main naagarik kanoon kii padhai ke liye videsh gayin or 1894 main bharat lautin
 us samay samaaj main mahilaayein mukhar nahin thim or na hi mahilaon ko vakaalat kaa adhikaar tha
 But Cornelia was a passion
 apni pratibha kii badaulat unhone mahilaon ko kanoonee paraamarsh dena aarambh kiya or mahilaon ke liye vakaalat kaa pesha kholane kii maang uthaai
 antat: 1907 ke baad carnelia ko bengal, bihar, urisa or assam kii adaalaton main sahaayak mahila vakil kaa pad diya gaya
 In 1924, after a long struggle, the law prohibiting women from advocating was relaxed and opened this profession for them
 1929 main carnelia hoicourt kii varisht vakil ke taur par sevanivrutt huyin par uske baad mahilaon main itani jagriti aa chuki thi ki ve vakaalat ko ek peshey ke taur par apanaakar apni aawaaj mukhar karne lagi thim
 Although Cornelia died in 1954 when she was in London, her name is still the foundation of women in a complex and prestigious profession like advocacy
 1894 main bharat lautne par, psorabji ne pardaanashin mahilaon kii ore se saamaajik or salaahkaar kaary main shaamil ho gayin, jinhen baahar purush duniya ke saath samvaad karne se manaa kiya gaya tha kai maamalon main, in mahilaon kii kaaphi sampatti hoti thi, lekin unki raksha ke liye aavashyak kanoonee visheshgyata tak pahunch nahin thi
 Sorabji was given special permission from the British agents of the rulers of Kathiawar and Indore to plead on behalf of Pardanshin, but was unable to protect her in court as a woman, not receiving a professional position in the Indian legal system Was
 is sthiti kaa samaadhaan karne kii ummid main, psorabji ne 1897 main bombai uniwarsity kii elelbi pariksha ke liye khud ko prastut kiya or 1899 main elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke vakil kii pariksha main bhaag liya
 Nevertheless, despite his successes, Sorbji was not recognized as a lawyer until the law prohibiting women from practicing in 1923 was changed
 prantiy nyaayalayon main mahilaon or naaballigon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ek mahila kanoonee salaahkaar pradaan karne ke liye psorabji ne 1902 ke shuru main bharat karyaalay main yachika daayar karne kii shuruyaat kii thi
 In 1904, Lady Assistant was appointed to the Court of Wards of Bengal and due to the need for such representation in 1907, Sorabji was working in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam
 agle 20 saal kii seva main, anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki psorabji ne 600 se adhik mahilaon or anathon ko kanoonee ladaai ladane main madad kii, kabhi-kabhi koi shulk nahin liya
 She would later write many of these cases in her work Between the Twilights and two autobiographies
 1924 main, bharat main mahilaon ke liye kanoonee pesha kholaa gaya tha, or sorbaji ne kolkata main abhyaas karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 However, due to male bias and discrimination, she was limited to formulating opinions on cases rather than presenting them before the court
 sorbaji 1929 main ucch nyaayalay se sevanivrutt huin, or landan main bas gayin, sardiyon ke dauraan bharat kii yatra par aatin
 He died on 6 July 1954 at his London home at Northumberland House on Green Lane in Manor House, London

 Apart from social reform and legal work, he also composed many books, short stories and articles

 maa0 mulaayam singh yadav ke mukhyamantri kaal main cabinet mantri laghu sichaai, gram vikaas evam gramin abhiyantran 1990-91 tak | According to the theory of wave-particle duality or wave-particle duality, all substances have both particle and wave characteristics
 aadhunik bhautikee ke kwantem yantriki kshetra kaa yah ek aadharbhoot siddhanth he
 At the level at which the senses of humans perceive the world, at that level any object is either a particle or a wave, but not both simultaneously
 parmaanuon ke bahut hi sookshm str par aisa nahin hota or yahan bhautikee samajhane ke liye paaya gaya ki vastuen or prakaash kabhi to kan kii prakruti dikhaati hai or kabhi tarang kii
 The situation is very unique at the moment
 kuch ghatnaon se to prakaash tarangamay prathit hota he or kuch se kanikamay
 Probably the truth is dual
 rupe ke donon prishthon kii tarah, prakaash ke bhi do vibhinn rup hai
 But both are true
 aisa hi dwait dravya ke sambandh main bhi paaya gaya he
 It also sometimes appears waveful and sometimes granular
 na to prakaash ke ore na dravya ke donon rup ek hi samay main ek hi saath dikhaai de sakate hai
 They are conflicting, but complementary forms
 pracheen unani darshanik arastu ne prakaash kii prakruti ke bare main apni soch prastut kii thi ki prakaash hawa main ek tarang-numa uttejnaa he 
 Another Greek thinker, Damocritus, took the opposite view that everything in the universe is made of particles and the same thing is short on light
 yah matbhed unnisvi sadi tak chalata rahaa
 One of the characteristics of waves is that when two or more pure waves collide, they form a pattern of diffraction
 thik yahi prakaash kii shashakt kirnon ke saath dekha gaya
 Although Sir Isaac Newton believed light to be made up of particles and tried his best to adopt his approach, gradually most scientists began to believe that the basic nature of light is waves
 unnisvi sadi main scotland ke vaigyanik james clerk maxwell ne chaar sameekaran khoj nikaale jo tarangon par aadhaarit the or jo prakaash kii prakruti ko puri tarah ujagar karte the
 After this, light began to appear as electromagnetic waves
 iske vipareet, jo parmaanuon par anusandhan ho rahaa tha, us se lagane laga ke parmaanu or uske chote ansh kan hi hai
 Concepts like atomic weight began to appear as if the atom is actually a particle in which there are only small particles inside
 unnisvi sadi main kai vaigyanik krishnika se utpann hone vaali vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa adhyayan kar rahe the or armbh main iskaa ganit main sahi praturup banane main asafal hote rahe
 It is seen in sounds and other waves that whenever waves are formed in an object, the wavelength of those waves depends on the open space in the object where those waves get an opportunity to form
 sangeet main prayog hone vaali bansuri se jo dhvaniyaan nikalati hai unka tarangadairghy bansuri ke mukh se lekar pehle khule chhed kii lambaai ke baraabar yaa phir us kaa hat hoti he
 There is a theory of thermodynamics that an object that is in thermal equilibrium, must have the same level of energy in every possible way to hold energy
 is adhyayan main kaale padaarth ko ushmiya santulan main liya gaya or, kyonki uske anant hat nikalate the, to laga ke urja bhi anant tarangadairdhyon main dikhni chahie or anant honi chahie
 But it was seen that there was nothing in electromagnetic energy emanating from dark matter
 1900 main german vaigyanik maiks plank ne is duvidha kaa tod niklaa
 He said that when electromagnetic energy falls on a molecule of black matter, it absorbs it and gets into an excited state
 jab vah paryaapt urja paa letaa he to us urja ko ek vidyutchumbakeey kiran ke rup main prasaarit karke waapas apni vishram kii sthiti main aa jaataa he
 He wrote e = hv in mathematics to the energy transmitted by the atom, in which e is energy, v is frequency and h is a constant
 unke kehane kaa matlab tha ke kaale padaarth kii urja kaa strot ushmiya santulan main sthit kaale padaarth ke andar kaa khulaa sthaan nahin balki kaale padaarth ke anu hai jo uttejnaa or vishram kii sthitiyon main aate-jate pehle to urja sokhte hai or phir use chhodte hai
 a larger frequency beam requires more energy and will be released only when its equivalent energy is absorbed
 plank kaa tarika lagaakar jab kaale padaarth se umadane vaali vidyutchumbakeey urja ko dekha gaya, to unhen bilkul thik paaya gaya
 This created panic, as it was immediately revealed that the electromagnetic energy being released by the excited molecules can also be seen as Kiransh
 abhi tak prakaash ko tarang mana jaataa tha
 Seeing the tendency of particles in it created confusion because it means that light is sometimes particle and sometimes wave
 yah dvirup plank swayan maanane ko taiyaar nahin the or unhone kaha ki haalanki unka siddhant thik baithta he, lekin unki ganit main kuch gadabad he
 The coming decades showed that there was no such mess
 prakaash vastav main tarang-kan kaa dvirup rakhata he
 Many scientists agreed with Planck, that light is only a wave and they started trying to find a new way to prove it
 albert oinstin ne is se bilkul vipareet kaam kiya
 He accepted that there is also a tendency for particles in the light and tried to solve an old issue with this truth
 1887 main hikerikh hertz naam ke ek german vaigyanik ne maaloom kiya tha ki jab bahut kam tarangadairghy kaa prakaash kuch dhaatuon or anya padaarthon par padataa he to bijli kaa bahaav paidaa hota he
 In 1901, Nikola Tesla showed that electricity is being produced because electrons are emitted spontaneously from this metal
 agle hi saal, 1902 main, philip lenard ne paaya ki prakaash agar bade tarangadairghy kaa ho to aisa nahin hota, chaahe roshni kitni hi adhik kyon na daali jaae, jabaki chote tarangadairghy vaale halaki roshni main bhi yah hota he
 This came to be called the lightning effect and scientists failed to understand for many years why this happens and only from light with short wavelengths
 inastin ne plank ke siddhant ko lekar yah gutthi sulajhaa di
 He said that light can actually be seen as its particles
 prakaash ke har kan main plank ki bataai hui urja hoti he, yani E=hv
 There is an inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency - larger wavelength means that particles of light will have lower frequency and energy will also be lower according to Planck's law
 kam tarangadairghy kaa matlab he ke prakaash ke kanon main aavriti adhik hogi or plank niyam ke anusaar urja bhi adhik hogi
 He made some predictions based on this, which were found to be perfectly fine in the laboratory
 iske liye inastin ko 1921 main bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 Max Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, even before that, in 1918
 inastin kii khoj ke baad yah jhuthalaanaa asambhav ho gaya ke prakaash main kan or tarang donon kii pravritiyaan hai
 After 1925 particles of light came to be called foton and this name has now become popular
 inastin kii khoj or jeet ke baad, vaigyanikon ne dhire-dhire prakaash ke tarang-kan dvirup ko maananaa shuru kar diya tha, jab 1924 main francisi vaigyanik lui da broai ne bhautikee kii duniya main ek or sansani failaa di
 He said that not only light, but also all matter, wave-particles are twisted and any moving substance can be seen as a wave or particle
 unhone apane ganit se dikhaaya ke gatisheel kan kaa tarangadairghy uske samveg par nirbhar karata he - This is exactly what was found in experiments with electrons three years later
 yah parmaanuon ke ansh hote hai or inhen hameshaa kan samajha jaataa tha, lekin jab electron kiran poonj ek parade par phenki gayi to bilkul shashakt prakaash kii tarah inhon ne bhi tarangon vaale vivartan ke chitra dikhaa die
 For his discovery, The Broy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929
 1927 main german vaigyanik varnor hisenberg ne apana anischitata siddhanth prakashit kiya jisamen unhone kaha ke yah purna nischitata ke saath kabhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ke koi vastu kahan sthit he yaa us kii gati kya he
 He made it clear that this is not due to deficiency in any criterion, but only in nature
 jis tarah se kisi tarang ke bare main yah thik se nahin kaha ja saktaa ke vah kahan sthit he usee tarah se vastuon ke bare main bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The smaller the object, the greater the uncertainty according to its size
 unhone ganit main ise aise likhaa - Where yah anischitata siddhanth jaldi hi kwantem yantriki kii niv kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban gaya or isamen bhi padaarthon ke tarang-kan dvirup kii pahchaan nihit he
