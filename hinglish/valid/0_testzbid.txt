 cendrak kaa aavaran nasht ho jaataa he or uski jagah ek tarkuvat upkaran utpann hota he
 In the cells of most animals, which have the ability to divide, there is a special device called centrosome and in the middle of it there is a corpuscle, which is called tarakendra
 purvavastha main hi tarakendre kaa vibhaajan ho jaataa he or ek se do tarakendre ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai
 This causes them to break away from each other and the centrosome splits into two
 donon centrosom ek duusare se adhik se adhik duuri par vyasabhimukh sthapit ho jate hai
 Around each centrosome, thin thin lines of cytoplasm are formed, called asterisks
 donon ore se tarakirane aakar centrekavaran par aghat karti hai
 By this time the precursor reaches its completion and, as stated above, the centrosome is destroyed

 Puritanism or consequentialism or pragmatism is a synonym for "pragmatism" in English and Pragmatism is derived from the Greek word 'pragma', meaning "verb" or "karma"
 tadnusaar "falanumeyapramanyawad" ek aisi vichaardhaara he jo gyaan ke sabhi kshetron main uske kriyaatmak prabhaav yaa fal ko ek atyant hi mahatvapurn sthaan detii he
 According to this, all our objective assumptions are the perceptions of their possible practical results

 Purposeism is a new philosophical ideology
 vartmaan yug main darshan evam shiksha ke vibhinn vichaardhaaraon main is vichaardhaara ko sabase adhik manyata praapt he
 Realism is an ideology that was planted in the human mind in very ancient times
 yatharthwaad kisi ek sugathit darshanik vichaardhaara kaa naam na hokar un sabhi vichaaron kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo yah maanate hai ki vastu kaa astitv swatantra rup se he
 The idealist holds that the existence of an 'object' depends on our knowledge
 yadi yah vichaar sahi he to vastu kii koi sthiti nahin he
 On the contrary, realists believe that the object has independent existence whether it is in our thoughts or not
 vastu tathaa usase sambandhit gyaan donon pruthak-pruthak sattaayen he
 There are many things in the world that we do not know about, but this does not mean that they do not exist at all
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki vastu kii swatantra sthiti he
 Our knowledge makes us aware of his condition, but our knowledge about him does not destroy his existence
 vaise gyaan prapti ke saadhan ke vishay main yathartwaadee, prayojanavaad ke samaan vaigyanik vidhi ko hi sarvottam vidhi maanata he or nigaman vidhi kaa aashray letaa he
 It cannot be said with certainty when the purposeist ideology was born, but still keeping in mind the uniqueness of this ideology, it can definitely be said that since man caused his problems and difficulties and their solutions
 Started thinking about the truth and practicality of the experiences gained from the efforts made for this, since then this ideology has been planted

 Dr
 Schiller has proposed a theory called Humanitarianism which should really be considered a branch of consequentialism
 james kii to praaia: sabhi kritiyaan is vichaardhaara par aadhaarit hai
 James was often a staunch opponent of spiritualism, especially Hegelian spiritualism
 unhen prayogpriy evam bahyavastuvaadi amareeki janata kaa vaicharik pratinidhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 When he was engaged in the idea of a criterion of truth that was entirely different from the metaphysical paradigm, he wrote "how do we make our ideas clear" in an American monthly paper called "pupular Science" in January, 1878
 - Read the article and after finding the basic framework of modern consequentialism, he became convinced that this is the criterion of truth or truth
 peers ko, jaisaa swayan unhone hi kaha he, falanumeyapramanyawad kaa sabhanarthvachi "pregametism" shabd or uskaa bhav donon hi germany ke suprasiddh darshanik kaant kii kritiyon se mili the
 But even while showing the antiquity of this ideology, James considers himself especially grateful to Peers and has honored him as a pioneer of modern consequentialism in philosophy
 jo bhi ho, is siddhant ko bal evam prakhyati pradaan karne main swayan james kaa hi naam sarvopar ullekhneey he
 All the well-known texts such as his "principles of Psychology", "miscellaneous Forms of Religious Experience", "consequentialism", "meaning of Truth" and "the Nine World" support this ideology
 unke na keval taarkik vichaar hi kintu manovaigyanik evam tathvik-sabhi prakaar ke vichaar falanumeyapramanyawaadee pravriti ke suspasht pratik hai
 According to James "truth is the name of all things that prove themselves superior in the way of faith, and also for certain specific things"
 sankshep main, "satya vichaar kii prakriya kaa ek yogya yaa uchit upkaran maatr hota he, thik vaise hi jaise "shubh" hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek safal saadhan maatr; vah kisi bhi prakaar se laabhprad or, vastut:, antatogatva tathaa sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par laabhadaayak he
 "james considers truth to be the cash value of our personal perceptions, not objective facts
 unke anusaar ham swayan apane satyon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They are not merely reactions of external objects; But the seekers of our purposes are our only faith
 ham un vishwaason ko jo hamen bhavatmak tripti yaa vyaavhaarik safalataa pradaan karte hai satya maanane lagate hai, or iske vipareet parinamawaalon ko asaty
 Therefore, the veracity of our beliefs or thoughts is permissible by their result or result
 uske sthapit hone ke liye samay or anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Just as we get success in behavior with a belief, so also its truth increases
 hamaare simit anubhav dwaara pramanit hamaari kisi bhi aasthaa ko purnataya satya kahalaane kaa adhikaar nahin, yahan tak ki vigyaan ke tathakthith prakritik niyamon ko bhi purna rup se satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We have the right to say as much as possible that as far as our experiences are concerned, they have proved to be true; But this does not prove their eternal truth
 purna satya ke liye purna anubhav, jiskaa hona kabhi sambhav nahin, apekshit he
 Therefore, any truth propounded by humans, whether it is scientific or whether it is scientific or logical, cannot be absolute truth
 jinhen praaia: manushya siddh-satya yaa siddhant sajaate hai unhen falanumeyapramanyawaadee keval upakalpana hi maanate hai
 They strongly criticize rationalist logic and corrupt their principles of justice
 ve maanviya vichaaron ko, buddhivaadee tarkshastriyon kii manyata ke viruddh, sadaiv prayojnatmak maanate hai, ni:swaarth nahin
 The Indian method of testing the truthfulness of knowledge called "tendency, strength and tendencyism", according to which the successor knowledge is considered to be true or false knowledge is inexact or false when it comes into action, resembling this consequential phenomenological method
 parantu, saath hi saath, "tadvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan yathartham" evam tadbhaavvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan bhram:" kahanevaala kattar vastuvaadi nyaayadarshan anurupatavaad kaa samarthak prathit hota he, jab ki james aadi paashchaatya falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ne uski katu aalochana kii he
 Just as in Satyasatya deliberation, similarly in the interpretation of mental processes or ideas, the consequentialist primevalists give a major place to our practical actions
 unke anusaar, ham na keval apane satyon kaa hi kintu vividh anubhavon kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai
 Our primary or basic experience is like an uninterrupted stream and we divide it into various substances and their interrelationships, inspired by self-interest and self-interest, through our mental actions of analyzing and choosing, etc
 is prakaar, inke manovigyaan or lock aadi ke parmanuwaadi manovigyaan main, jiske anusaar hamaare vichaar praarambhik saral pratyayon ke ek yantric dhang se sangrahit anukram maane jate hai, moulik antar he
 Atomicist psychology is an imitation of the physical science of the same name, which is far from the reality and misleading in the eyes of the consequentialists
 vishwaason yaa vichaaron ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan main falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi sweekaar karanevaalon main tatvagyan sambandhi mataiky nahin
 Nevertheless, if any philosophy can be said to be a counterpoint to this ideology, it is the doctrinal principle propounded by Dr
 Schiller in the book "studies in Humanism", supported by Prof
 Dui
 iske anusaar, ham swayan hi sadaiv ek badi had tak or sahi arth main vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality continues to form, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa sambandh he yah nishchay he ki uskaa swaroop nirman, ek atyant mahatvapurn ansh main, hamaar or hamaare us gyaan ke upar nirbhar rahata he jisapar hamaare prayojanon or swaarthon kii chhap anivaaryat lagi rahati he
 Our facts are those in which their Nirmapika have the power or ability to satisfy our desires
 jis prakaar satya hamaare safal vishwaas hote hai usee prakaar tathy hamaari ichchhaaon ko santushti pradaan karanevaale padaarth hote hai
 In short, successful functional effectiveness in our practical life should be understood, according to these thinkers, as a sign of fact or reality
 bhartiya buddha darshan kii sat kii paribhaasha bhi, jiske anusaar "sat vah he jisamen kisi kaary ko utpann karne kii kshamta ho", falanumeyapramanyawaadee vichaardhaara ke anukool prathit hoti he, kyonki usamen bhi vastuon ke sattvaasatva, astitv, anstitv, ke nirdhaaran main unke kaaryrup fal ko hi nirnaayak mana he
 But in many other philosophical matters, all Buddhist philosophers neither agree with each other nor with the modern philanthropist
 ek maanavtaavaadi darshan hone ke kaaran prayojanavaad sansar evam uski vastuon tathaa kriyaaon ke kaarnon par us gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karata jitna maanav jivan main uski upyogita par vichaar karata he
 In order to protect its existence as an independent philosophy, Purposeism has laid down the following basic principles, considering the reasons of the world and its actions, making human the basis
 atah spasht he ki prayojanavaadee kabhi adarshavaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai to kabhi prakrutivaadiyon kaa
 In this way, they place themselves between these two 'vados'
 prayojanavaadee darshan ‘pragati gami shiksha’ ke aandolan ke rup main prasphutit hua parantu aaj uski safalataa ke sambandh main anek ashankayein uthaai ja rahi hai
 The reason is clear that Purposeism has shown to be imperfect ideology by its uncertain objectives, by giving more importance to the instrument and by rendering principles like creativity in the field of human values
 prayojanavaadee darshan ke sambandh main kuch vichaarneey bindu is prakaar hai – Due to the soft education system, children are not prepared to live real life

 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha
 Some Indian films of the 1930s are known as "multilingual"
 in filmo ko milti julati lekin asmaan roopaantar main vibhinn bhashaaon main shoot kiya gaya tha
 According to Rajadhyaksha and Willeman in the Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, a multilingual film in its exact form ek bahubhashi yaa tribhaashi ek prakaar kii film he jo 1930s main studio yug main bani thi, jisame alag bhashaaon main har drishy ke alag lekin samaan shot liye jate the jisame abhinayta alag hote the lekin takaniki karmi or sangeet ek hote the

 hajaari prasad ek kanjus or laalchee kism kaa aadmi he jo din raat apane iklaute putr raja, ke liye kisi dhani ladki kaa sapana dekhtaa rahata he
 Raja is only interested in spending his father's money in expensive parties
 ek din college jate vakt, nikat se guzar rahi ek jeep raja par keechad oochaal jaati he
 Madhu, the jeep girl, is rude to the king
 raja andha hone kaa dhong kar madhu ko bevakoof banaata he
 When reality opens, it imitates it
 donon iske saath hi ek duusare ke dushman ban jate hai or ek duusare ko majaa chakhaane kaa bahaanaa dhundne lagate hai
 The king drops Madhu with his effort during the dance rehearsal
 uske baad madhu usko college ke champion boxr se ladane ke liye majaboor kar detii he
 The king wins in that fist fight
 udhar ladki dhundte dhundte hajaari prasad ko abhas hota he kii uskaa raddi or kabad kaa dhandha raja kii bhavy shaadi main aade aayega
 One day while on a trip to an expensive hotel, he encounters Mr
 Mehra, a millionaire who has only one girl
 hajaari bhaade ke kalakaar lekar apane staff ke taur par bhartee kar letaa he
 Like Mehra, he too, with two big dogs, reaches the beach early in the morning where Mehra is roaming

 He soon becomes Mehra's friend

 When the king meets his future wife, he learns that the girl is Madhu
 madhu or raja shaadi kii sambhaavna se hi inkaar kar dete hai
 Madhu overcame a weekend college tour when he falsely accused Raja of trying to rape her
 raja krodhit hota he ki uski pratishtha barbaad ho gai he or use beyimaani or vichaarheenta ke liye dandit karata he, yah bataate hue ki kai log apana badla lete lekin vah alag he
 Madhu immediately falls in love with the king

 Furious, he insults Hazari in front of everyone
 hajaari bahut zyada bura maanata he
 Raja and Madhu are refused by their parents to meet each other again
 phir bhi, donon gupt rup se milte rahete hai
 When Mr
 Mehra discovered this, he arranged for the king to be beaten by some thugs
 vah madhu ko dur bhejne kaa faisla karte hai jahaan vah raja se sampark nahin kar paaegi
 Before doing so, the king sneaks into Madhu's house and the two get married
 shri mehara ne madhu ko ghar se nikaal diya or ghoshit kiya ki vah unke liye mar chuki he
 Hazari also rejects the king when he finds out that he has married the daughter of his biggest enemy
 phir joda ek chote se jhopadi main chalaa jaataa he or raja ko ek nirmaan majdoor ke rup main kaam mil jaataa he
 Despite their poverty, they are happy
 nirmaan sthal par raja ko gambhir rup se chot lag jaati he
 Madhu begs her father for money to pay for the emergency operation
 hajaari sahamat ho jaataa he, lekin keval tabhi jab vah apane suhaag ko bhul jaae
 She removes her mangalsutra and returns to her father's house in despair
 jab raja thik ho jaataa he, to hajaari use bataata he ki madhu apane pita ke paas laut gai or aspataal main kabhi nahin ai or use marane ke liye chhod diya
 Assuming that Madhu has left him to return to a life of luxury, the king returns to his parents
 baad main, use apni maa se pataa chalaa ki madhu uske pita ke blackmel kii vajah se aspataal main nahin ai thi
 He rebuffs his father a lot and rushes to stop Madhu from flying to London
 lekin hawaii jahaaj pehle hi chalaa jaataa he
 His father realizes his mistake and fortunately he stops Madhu from taking the plane

 aapekshikta siddhantvishisht aapekshikta kaa parichay Specific relativity theory or specific theory of relativity Albert Einstein, in his paper on electrostatics in moving objects, gave a physical theory of measurement in the inertial directive system proposed in 1905
 galileo gallily ne abhigruhit kiya tha ki sabhi samaan gatiyaan saapekshik hai or yahan kuch bhi nirpeksh nahin he tathaa kuch bhi viraam avasthaa main bhi nahin he, jise ab galileo kaa aapekshikta siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Einstein extended this theory, according to which the velocity of light is absolute and fixed, a phenomenon that was recently visible in michelson-morley's experiment
 unhone ek abhigruhit yah bhi diya ki yah sabhi bhautik niyam, yantriki va sthiravaidyutiki ke sabhi niyamon, wo jo bhi hon, samaan rahete hai
 There are a large number of results of this theory that have been observed experimentally, such as time dilation, length contraction, and symmetry
 is siddhant ne nishchar samay interval jaisi avadharana ko badalakar nishchar dik-kaal interval jaisi nai avadharana ko janm diya he
 This theory gave the revolutionary mass-energy relation e = mc2, where c is the velocity of light in vacuum, this formula is a joint derivative of other physical laws, including the two postulates of this theory
 aapekshikta siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyan newtoneey bhautikee ke parinaam ko sahaj hi ullekith karte hai, visheshtah jab prekshaniy vastu kaa veg, prakaash ke veg kii tulana main naganya ho
 According to specific relativity theory, the velocity of light c is not merely the velocity of a hypothesis, such as the velocity of electromagnetic radiation, but is a fundamental characteristic of the integration of macromolecules and time as a period of time
 is siddhant kaa ek parinaam yah bhi he ki aisi koi bhi vastu athwa kan jiskaa viraam dravyaman shunya nahin he kisi bhi paristhiti main prakaash ke veg tak twarit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The reason for calling this theory specific is that this principle applies only to inertial reference systems
 iske kuch varshon pashchaat saamaanya aapekshikta naamak vyapak siddhant diya gaya, jo vyapak nirdeshaankon par kaary karata he or isse gurutvkarshan samajhane main bhi sahaayta milti he
 —albert Einstein: Autobiographical Comments ainstin ne do moolbhoot prastaav die jo sabase adhik sahi prathit hote hai, jo tatkaaleen yantriki or vidyutgatiki ke niyamon kii paripurna vaidhata kii andekhi karke die gayi
 This motion depended on the velocity of light and was independent of the physical rules and inertial reference system
 unhone 1905 main apni pratham prastuti main in abhigrihiton kaa ullekh kiya The derivation of specific relativism depends not only on the above two identities but also on the various implicit hypotheses including the isotropy and symmetry of the macro, freedom of rod measurement and clocks from the history of our past
 vishisht aapekshikta par 1905 main ainstin kii mul prastuti ke anusaar, vibhinn parivarti vyutpan vidhiyon dwaara praapt vibhinn abhigruhit die ja chuke hai
 According to the specific relativity principle, no directional system is absolute
 prithvi par sthir nirdesh tantra jadtviya nirdesh tantra nahin he kyonki yah prithvi kii ghurnan gati ke saath yah bhi ghurnan karata he
 The inertial motion mechanism is also inertial at a fixed velocity relative to an inertial direction system
 atah nirpeksh jadtviya nirdesh tantra kii pariklpana niraadhaar he
 Suppose the directive system s has the time coordinates and the directive system s ′ has coordinates
 tab lorenj roopantaran ke anusaar in nirdeshaankon ko nimna sambandhon dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he : Where lorenj gunak he or c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he or nirdesh tantra S′ kaa veg v x-aksh ke samaantar he
 The y and z coordinates are not affected; Only the x and t coordinates move
 yahan x-aksh main kuch vishesh nahin he, sthaanantaran y athwa z akshon par bhi lagu ho saktaa he, athwa kisi bhi disha main jo disha gati kii disha ke samaantar or lambavat ho
 a zodiac sign that remains undervalued in Lorenz transformation is called Lorenz Neischer
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran or iske vyutkram likhane par, jahaan ek ek ghatana ke nirdeshaank or hai tathaa duusari ghatana ke nirdeshaank or tab unke antaraal nimna tarah se paribhaashit kiye jate hai : So we can write vishisht aapekshikta ke parinaam lorenj samikarnon se vyutpann kiye ja sakate hai
 These transformations and specific relativities also give different results from the notable results when the relative velocity values are equal to the velocity of light
 prakaash kaa veg maanav nirmit kisi bhi samagam se bahut adhik he jo vishisht aapekshikta dwaara kuch prabhaav praapt kiye gayi
 Examples such as symmetry, time dilation, length contraction have been proved experimentally
 do bhinn ghatnaayen jo ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra main samakshanik hai, ho saktaa he duusare jadtviya nirdesh tantra main sthit prekshak ke liye samakshanik nahin hai 
 First equation of Lorenz transformation in different coordinates yahan yah spasht he ki jo ek nirdesh tantra s main samakshanik hai, aavashyak nahin kii anya nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hon 
 If these events are isotropic in the directive system S, then they will be congruent in the other directive system s ′
 ek prekshak se duusare prekshak tak kinhin do ghatanon ke madhya samay nishchar nahin he, balki prekshkon kii gati par nirbhar karata he Suppose a clock instruction is at rest in mechanism S
 is ghadi ke do bhinn tik-tik ko Δx = 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The time between these two ticks is measured in both systems, for this the first equation is given as follows: isse pradarshit hota he ki do tik ke madhya kaa samyaantar nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi viraam avasthaa main thi kii tulana main nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi gatisheel thi main adhik tha
 With the help of time extension, we can understand many physical hypotheses such as the rate of loss of muons generated by the cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere
 ek prekshak dwaara kisi vastu kii vimaa kaa maapan anya prekshak dwaara prekshit maapan se bhinn ho sakati he
 Similarly, in the considered linear pause, the instruction system s is aligned towards the x-axis
 is tantra main rekhak kii lambaai Δx likhi jaati he
 The measurement of the length of the line in the s 'reference system in which the clock is moving where x ′ is measured at the ends of the rod is paralleled in the S' mechanism
 anya shabdon main, is maapan ko Δt′ = 0 main kiya gaya, jise chaturth sameekaran dwaara yugmit kiya ja saktaa he ke liye lambaaiyon Δx or Δx′ main nimna samband sthapit kiya jaataa he: This indicates that the length of the rod in the instruction system in which the rod was moving is lower than its own stop instruction mechanism
 vegon ke sayonjan ke liye inhen saadhaaran rup se nahin joda jaataa
 If according to the observer in the instruction mechanism S, an object is moving with velocity u towards the x axis, then the motion object observed by the observer located in the direction mechanism s ′ which is moving along the x-axis and v velocity relative to the instruction mechanism s The velocity u 'is where: anya nirdesh tantra main prekshit : It is worth noting here that objects which are moving with the velocity of light in the instruction system S, then that object will also be moving with the velocity of light in the direction system s ′
 yadi u or v ke maan prakaash ke veg ke saapeksh bahut nune hai to hamen vegon ke sahaj galilia roopantaran praapt hote hai The common example that is given is that a train is moving eastward and v velocity relative to the tracks
 ek baccha jo train ke andar baitha he ne ek gend purv disha kii or train ke saapeksh veg u se phenkaa
 In orthodox physics, the velocity of the ball of the observer placed at rest on the tracks will observe u = u ′ + v in the east direction, while the specific relativity is not true; Rather, the velocity of the ball is given in the east direction by the second equation: u = / 
 punah, yahan x athwa purv disha ke liye kuch vishesh nahin he
 These formulas will apply in any direction for which we have to take care of the mutually parallel and vertical motions of relative velocity v
 ainstin kaa vegon ke sangyojan kaa niyam phizaau prayog main sahi paaya gaya, jisane prakaash ke veg kaa maapan prakaash ke veg ke samaantar gatisheel taral ke saapeksh kiya tha
 But till date no experiment has tested the formula for a broad form of unequal motion
 thomas agragaman ko thomas ghurnan ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, yah kanon ke prachakran par lagu hone vaala aapekshik shodhan he
 The orientation of an object may be different for different observers
 anya aapekshik prabhaavon ke vipareet, yah prabhaav ati nimna vegon par bhi sarthak he, jaisaa gatisheel kanon ke prachakran main dekha ja saktaa he
 As the speed of an object approaches the velocity of light in the observer's perspective, its relative mass also increases, making it more difficult to accelerate, all of which appears to be from the observer's directive system
 viraam avasthaa main kisi vastu kii urja kaa maan mc2 hota he jahaan m vastu kaa dravyaman he
 By the law of energy conservation, in any action, the decrease in mass should be equal to the increase in its kinetic energy after the action
 isi prakaar, kisi vastu kaa dravyaman ko isaki gatij urja ko isamen lekar badhaaya ja saktaa he
 In addition, Einstein also wrote at least four papers, making self-empirical arguments for equivalence - referring to the above-derived Lorenz transformations and explaining specific relativities
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata vishisht aapekshikta kaa ek parinaam he
 In renewable mechanics, where energy and momentum are different physical quantities, they form a quadrature direction in specific relativity and relate the time component to the macro component
 viraam avasthaa main sthit ek vastu, urja dravyaman chatursadish hota he : iskaa samay ghatak urja he or anya teen samshti ghatak hai jo shunya hai
 The energy-momentum quadrature will change when the direction mechanism changes with the Lorenz transform with a low velocity v in the x-axis direction
 saveg kaa maan urja va veg ke gunanfal ko c2 se vibhajit karne par praapt maan ke saamaan hoga
 For example, the new mass of an object, which is proportional to the momentum and velocity for low velocities, will be equal to e / c2
 urja va samveg, dravya va vikiran kaa naij gundharm he or yah parinaam nikalnaa asambhav he ki vishisht aapekshikta ke do moolbhoot abhigrihiton se ve apane aap chatursadish rup main praapt honge, kyonki ye padaarth athwa vikiran ke vishay main nahin bataate, balki samshti va samay ke bare main bataate hai
 Therefore, its derivative requires more physical knowledge
 iske liye ainstin ne atirikt siddhant kaa upyog kiya jiske anusaar nimna vegon par newtoneey yantriki se sahi parinaam milte hai, atah nimna vegon par keval urja adish va teen-samveg sadish hote hai
 He further hypothesized that the energy and frequency of the light would be transformed by the same Doppler displacement component, which he had already proved true by the Maxwell equations, the subject of the first paper published in 1905 by Einstein, "whether the inertia of a body depends on that energy Does? "was
 yadhyapi paper main ainstin kaa tark bhautik vigyaniyon dwaara satya ke rup main bina kisi pramaan ke lagbhag saarvbhaumikta se sweekaar kiya jaataa he or bahut lekhakon ne pichley kuch varshon tak sujhavit kiya ki yah galat he
 According to other authors, this statement was quite inconclusive as it was based on some underlying assumptions
 ainstin ne sweekaar kiya ki vishisht aapekshikta par unke 1907 ke aalekh main uski vyutpati par vivaad hue
 There he realized that it is problematic to rely on the Maxwell equations for approximate energy-mass reasoning
 unke 1905 main prakashit paper main tark tha ki dravyaman rahit kan kaa utsarjan kiya ja saktaa he, lekin maxwell samikarnon ke anusaar ise nisandeh pratyeksh banaaya ki keval kaary ke parinamswaroop prakaash kaa utsarjan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For the emission of electromagnetic waves, the movement of a charged particle is sufficient and it is definitely work, hence it is the emission of energy
 chunki prakaash ke veg se tej gati sambhav nahin he, jiskaa nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he ki maanav prithvi se 40 prakaash varshon se adhik dur yatra nahin kar saktaa yadi yatri 20 se 60 varsh kii aayu main sakriya rahe
 It can also be easily thought that the traveler may be able to reach only a few solar systems that are located 20–40 light years from Earth
 lekin yah ek galat parinaam he
 Because the hypothetical spacecraft can travel hundreds of light years during the active 40 years of a pilot according to the hypothesis of time-span
 yadi ek aisa antarikshayan bananaa sambhav ho paaya jiskaa twaran 1g ho, to ek varsh se bhi kam samay main prithvi se lagbhag prakaash ke veg ke saamaan veg se gatisheel prekshit hoga
 Due to the expansion of time, his life extension will increase with the instruction system located on the earth, but the clock traveling with him will not change
 uski yatra ke dauraan, prithvi par sthit vyakti yatri kii tulana main adhik samay anubhav karegaa
 The 5 year excursion journey observed by the traveler will be equivalent to 61⁄2 years of Earth and 6 light years will decide
 ek 20 varsh kii bhraman yaatr ke pashchaat yadi prithvi par waapas aata he to vah prithvi ke 335 varsh vyateet kar chukaa he or 331 prakashavarsh duuri tay kar chukaa he
 a 40-year journey with 1 g acceleration would be equivalent to 58,000 years of Earth and cover 55,000 light years
 1

 For this expansion reason, a muon that is moving at almost the same velocity as the light c is c × pause is observed far beyond the half-age distance
 chitra 2 main antaraal AB 'samay-samroop' he; jaise yahan nirdesh tantra he jisamen a or b do ghatnaayen samshti main ek hi bindu par ghatit hoti hai keval alag samay par ghatit hone par hi alag kii ja sakati hai
 If event a occurs before event b in this reference system, then event a will occur before event b in all reference systems
 yah dravya ke liye sambhav he ki vah ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par gati kare, atah yahan ek kaarantv sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 The gap AC in the picture is macro-homogeneous, meaning that here an instruction mechanism is such that events a and c occur at the same time, only the macro is different
 yahan par aise nirdesh tantra bhi praapt kar sakate hai jinamein A, c se pehle ghatit hoti he or nidesh tantra jinamein C, a se pehle ghatit hoti he
 If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship that certain events would occur between a and C, then the paradox of causality would be the result
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi a kaaran tha or c prabhaav he to kuch nirdesh tantra aise bhi hai jinamein prabhaav kaaran se pehle ghatit hua
 Although this is not contradictory in itself, it can be demonstrated that the speed of light can transmit itself to the ghost of its own instruction system at a faster rate
 kaaranta virodhabhash kaa signal bhejkar nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he yadi or keval yadi purv main koi signal nahin mila tha
 Therefore, if the causality is preserved, then no information or matter can move faster than the velocity of light as a result of specific relativity
 tathaapi, kuch vasteen prakaash ke veg se bhi teji se gati karti hai jaise : sthaan jahaan bijli kii chamak ke kaaran kirane badal ke nichle hisse se takaraati he to us samay yah kiran prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se duuri tay kar sakati he jab yah shighrata se mudati he
 Without taking into account the causality, there are many more powerful reasons here
 The speed of light is prohibited by specific relativity
 udhaaharan ke liye ek niyat bal aseemit samay ke liye ek vastu par lagu kiya jaye to nimna vyanjak kaa bina seemaa ke samakalan karne par f = dp / dt saralata se samveg praapt kiya jaataa he lekin yah keval isliye kyonki p = m γ v { \ displaystyle p=m \ gamma v \ ,} anant kii or agrasar hota he jaise-jaise v { \ displaystyle \ ,v}, c kii agrasar hota he
 For an observer who is not quick, this is exemplified although the inertia of the object increases, so a small acceleration is produced under the influence of the same force
 yah vyavhaar vastav main kan twarakon main prekshit hote hai, jahaan prayek aaweshit kan vidyutchumbakeey bal dwaara twarit hota he
 Theoretical and experimental surangan studies propounded by Günter Nimtz and Petrissa Eckley incorrectly claimed that under special circumstances the signal could move at a speed greater than the velocity of light
 yah maapan kiya gaya kii fibre ankikaran signal c se 5 guna veg tak gati karata he or shunya samay surangan electron dwaara le jane vaali soochna ki parmaanu kaa photone se ynikaran or iske baavjood bhi electron surangan main shunya samay lagaataa he
 According to Nimtz and Eckley, this over-illumination process violates only Einstein causality and specific relativity but not primitive causality: hyper-fluorescent communication is not the result of any kind of time travel

 The 4-dimensional Minkowski macro is used in specific relativities; - This is an example of a time period
 minkovesaki dik-kaal maanak trivim eucalidia samshti ke bahut samaan prathit hoti he, lekin samay ke saath isamen kranthik parivartan aa jaataa he
 The differential line in the three-dimensional space is defined as ds jahaan dx = trivim samshti main avakal alpaansh hai
 In Minkowski's geometry, the derivative coordinate x0 over time is over-dimension, so the distance differential is jahaan dx = chaturvim dik-kaal main avakal alpaansh he
 This suggests a deeper theoretical insight: the special relativity is comparable to the normal rotational symmetry over a period of time, corresponding to the rotational symmetry in the Euclidean complex
 eucalidian samshti kii tarah eucalidian doorik kaa bhi upyog hota he atah dik-kaal minkovesaki doorik ko upyog karata he
 Originally specific relativity is seen as the "dormancy of the downtime" when it is seen in "some inertial instruction system"
 vishisht aapekshikta kii sabhi samikarnon va prabhaavon ko minkosaki dik-kaal kii ghurnan samamiti se vyutpan kiya ja saktaa he
 The actual form of the above "ds" depends on the distance and the choice of x0 coordinates
 samay nirdeshaank ko samshti nirdeshaank ke sadrush banane ke liye, ise kaalpanik kii tarah upyog kiya jaataa he : x0 = ict 
 According to Missner, Thorne, and Wheeler, a deeper understanding of both specific and general relativities is ultimately derived from Minkowski's distance study and that the impermeable Euclidean distance time coordinates take x0 = ct instead of ict
 kuch lekhak x0 = t kaa upyog karte hai jahaan c ke gunak ko anyatra samahit kar lete hai; udahaaran ke liye, samshti nirdeshaankon ko c se vibhajit kiya jaataa he athwa c±2 ke gunak ko doorik pradeesh main prayukt karte hai
 Here various practices can be replaced by the Prakrit unit where c = 1

 If we reduce the corresponding dimension to one, so that we can represent physics in stereoscopic tab dwait shanku ki disha main shunya parivartan milegaa, sameekaran ke rup main or jo c dt trigya vaale vrut kaa sameekaran he
 When we increase it in three squares, this amount is exemplified in the quadrilateral cone: atah This null duality-cone represents a point in the macro as one-dimensional
 yah jab ham taron kaa adhyayan karte hai or kehete hai ki "is taare se aaptit prakaash jo main ab dekh rahaa hoon vah amuk varsh purana he", ham is bindu ko vimaa ke rup main dekhte hai : ek ashakt geodesic he
 We call this event the distance d = x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 { \ displaystyle d = { \ sqrt {x_ {1} ^ {2} + x_ {2} ^ {2} + x_ {3} ^ The d / c at {2 xxrep 4 } occurred before time
 is kaaran se ashakt dwait shanku ko 'prakaash shanku' ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In the cone - "t" field means receiving information from the point and sending the point information to the + "t" area of the cone

 Equations of specific relativity can be written in express variable form
 kisi ghatana kii dik-kaal main sthiti pratiparivarti chatursadish dwaara di jaati he jiske ghatak nimna hai : We define x0 = ct so that the dimensions of the time coordinates are the same as the distance, as are the other dimensions; Hence, time and time are equally related, the vertices are used for the reflex index, not for their power and the footprints are variable indices that range from zero to three, such that the quadrature of the scalar region लिखा is written: jadtviya nirdesh tantron main nirdeshaank roopantaran lorenj roopantaran λ dwaara die jate hai
 For a particular state of motion when it is in the direction of the x-axis: jo x va ct nirdeshaankon ke madhya abhivardhan matrix he, jahaan μ' panktiyon ko tathaa ν sthambh kaa suchak he or It can be interpolated for velocity in any direction and can also include forward rotation, see the topic of Lorenz transformation for more information
 ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra se duusare main chatursadish kaa roopantaran lorenj roopantaran dwaara die jate hai: Here μ 'and ν' are added from 0 to 3

 The components of the Minkowski Durik η of the quadratic nature of the time period can be written as a matrix of 4 × 4: jo un nirdesh tantron main apane vyutkram η α β { \ displaystyle \ eta ^{ \ alpha \ beta }} ke saamaan he
 The Poincare Group is a very broad group of converts that comprise Minkowski's distance
 or yah vishisht aapekshikta kii aadharbhoot bhautik samamiti he
 a small change in length in the quadratic position is written as the square of dx μ { \ displaystyle dx ^ { \ mu} \ !} yah ek nishchar raashi he
 By inertia means its value is the same in all inertial reference systems because it is a scalar sign, so no λ appears in its normal transformation
 jab rekhaansh dx2 kaa maan rinatmak hota he Then standard time is derivative, while dx2 is positive, standard is derivative of distance

 Other physical quantities known as pradisha also follow the transformation rules
 chaturveg sadish Uμ nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he We then consider the combination of velocities in a simple sentence related to the conversion of the quadrilaterals from one directive system to another
 Uμ kaa bhi ek nishchar rup hota he : Therefore, the scale of all Chaturveg vector is c

 The quadrature vector is given by the following equation: iske pashchaat uparokt sameekaran ko τ ke saapeksh avaklit karne par Therefore, in relative, the acceleration quadrant and velocity quadrature are perpendicular angular
 samveg va urja ko covariant 4-sadish main sammilit kiya jaataa he : Where m is the mass of mass
 chatursamveg sadish kaa nishchar maan samveg-urja sambandh vyutpan karata he : What is this conclusion we can prove for which we have to prove that it is a scalar, it does not depend on which instruction system we are calculating and the conversion of the instruction system gives us the total momentum minus is
 yahan yah spasht he ki sthaayee dravyaman swatantra va nishchar he
 Static mass is also calculated for moving particles and bodies, for which they are converted into a directive system in which they have zero momentum
 sthir urja kaa sambandh dravyaman se he or yah chirparichit sambandh sameekaran upar ullekith kii gai : Keep in mind that the mass of the body is divided into their mass center reference system, which is given by its total energy in this direction system
 yah anya nirdesh tantra main maapan kiye gayi nijee nikaay dravyamanon ke yoga ke samaan ho aavashyak nahin
 In order to use Newton's third law of motion, both forces must be defined as the rate of change of velocity in the same time direction mechanism
 jahaan, upar paribhaashit trivim balon kaa hona aavashyak he
 Unfortunately, the quadrature does not contain any field that incorporates the components of the stereoscopic force vector into its components
 yadi kan kaa veg c nahin he tab kan ke sahagaami nirdesh tantra se prekshak nirdesh tantra main trivim balon kaa roopantaran sambhav he
 This creates a 4-vector called Chaturbal
 yah uparokt maanak samay ke saapeksh upar paribhaashit urja samveg chatursadish main parivartan kii dar he
 The covariant version of the chaturbal: jahaan τ maanak samay kehalaata he
 In the stationary directive system of objects, the time component of the quadrature remains zero until the fixed mass of the object changes, in which case the rate of change of mass is c times the negative value
 vyapak rup main, yadhyapi, chaturbal ke ghatak trivim bal ke ghatakon ke samaan nahin hote kyonki trivim balon ko samveg main parivartan kii dar ke rup main nirdesh tantra samay ke saapeksh paribhashit kiya jaataa he jo dp / dt hota he balki chaturvim bal ko maanak samay main parivartan kii dar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he arthath dp / dτ
 In a continuous medium, the density of the stereoscopic forces is included in the covariant 4-vector form as the density of the power
 samashti bhaag laghu kaksh par balon ko kaksh ke sampoorn aaytan dwaara vibhajit karne kaa parinaam he
 The time component is equal to the multiplier of -1 / c of the power conversion of the cell divided by the volume of the cell

 Charged particles are widely studied in the form of the Lennard – Wichart potential, which is one level higher towards specific relativity
 sthir prekshak nirdesh tantra main gatisheel aavesh ke vidyut kshetra kaa lorenj roopantaran ke parinamswaroop chumbakeey kshetra naamak ganitiya vyanjak prakat hoti he
 Similarly, by moving charge, the derivative magnetic field disappears in the concomitant directional system and changes only to the electrostatic force
 atah maxwell samikarane brahmand ke chirsmmat pratimaan main vishisht aapekshik prabhaav saralata va anubhavik rup se uchit hai
 As the electric and magnetic fields are dependent on the directional system and are contained in each other, so they are also called electromagnetic forces
 vishisht aapekshikta ke madhyam se ham ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra se duusare jadtviya nirdesh tantra main inke roopantaran niyam praapt hote hai
 The Maxwell equations in stereoscopic form are analogous to the physical properties of specific relativities, although they are implicitly implicitly implied in the corresponding concomitant form
 adhik jaankaree ke liye mukhya sutara dekhen
 The specific relativity in its Minkoski period is only in the case when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than c2 in the field of study
 In the strong gravitational field, the general relativity should be used
 saamaanya aapekshikta durbal kshetra kii seemaa main vishisht aapekshikta ke tulya ho jaati he
 At extreme scales such as the Planck length and even lower, quantum effects must be subjected to quantum gravity
