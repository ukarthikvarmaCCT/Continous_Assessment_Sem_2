 Cathay Dragon is an international regional airline operated by Hong Kong Airlines Limited
 Its main office is located in Cathay Dragon House and its main base center is Hong Kong International Airport

 Cathay Dragon is the wholly owned airline of Hong Kong's leading airlines Cathay Pacific and is also a member of the Airlines Alliance named One World
 It was founded on 25 May 1985 by its current honorary chairman Chao Kuang Piu
 It made its first flight from Hong Kong's Kota Kinabalu City to Hong Kong after the Air Operator's Certificate was granted by the Hong Kong government in July 1985
 In 2010, Dragon Air, along with its parent company Cathay Pacific, flew more than 1,38,000 flights and transported over 180 million kilograms of cargo and postage in addition to 27 million passengers

 1987 me yah internshnal air transport assosiyeshan kii sakriy sadsyta vaala hong kong sthit ek maatr airlines ban gaya
 Dragon Air was the only local airline in the last 40 years to compete with Hong Kong's successful Cathay Pacific Airlines and, therefore, Cathay Pacific made every effort to disrupt its operations, such as halting its flight-slot applications
 In 1987, Dragon Air announced the expansion of its services with the purchase of two long-range macdonnell Douglas M
 D11 aircraft
 However, after a heated debate in front of Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority, the Hong Kong government announced the adoption of the 'one route-one Airline Policy' which continued until 2001
 For this reason, regular routes could not be allocated to effectively challenge the Dragon Air
 Perhaps one of the main reasons for this was that the then Finance Secretary of Hong Kong, Sir John Bremeridge had been the former chairman of Cathay Pacific
 vartmaan me cathe dragon hong kong se 47 gantavyon ke liye udaane sanchalit karata he

, bear the distortions and stresses caused by them, especially due to sea waves
 jahaajon ke chalate samay jab saamne kii hawa kaa mukaabila karnaa hota he
 At that time, if long waves equal to the width of the ship begin to rise, then a single large wave of plum can lift the ship in the balance in the middle
 tab jahaaj ke aage or peeche k sire thik usee prakar se latakate rahenge jaise ki kisi ladi hui shateer ko bich main se sahaara dekar uthaa liya ho
 This condition of the ship is called convexity
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki jahaaj kaa aage or peeche kaa sira to laharon par tik jaataa he or bich kaa sthaan khaali ho jaataa he, thik vaisaa hi jaise koi ladi hui shateer donon siron par tiki ho
 In this situation, the stresses on the structure of the ship are called concave
 kabhi kabhi in donon paristhitiyon kaa mishran bhi ho jaataa he, jisamen padanevaale pratibal kartan kehalaate hai
 When the wind moves diagonally, sometimes there are torsional forces in the structure of the ship
 jab bagali hawa chalati he tab parshviya vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai
 Apart from this, excessive pressure of sea water on the submerged part also shows a tendency to stick to the structure
 sabase adhik tathaa vikat prakaar kii vikrutiyaan to aage or peeche ke siron par us samay paidaa hoti hai jab jahaaj main maal ke visham ladaan or laharon ke prabhaav tathaa pani ke utplavak bal ke kaaran jagah jagah par naman ghurna paidaa hone lagate hai
 When calculating the deformations caused by the waves, it is assumed that the length of each wave is equal to the width of the ship and their height is about one-third of the length
 jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana karte samay uske prayek avyav kii rachana aisi karte hai ki usapar jo bhi pratibal pade, sab main samavibhajit hokar is prakaar se samast dhaanche main fail jaae ki prayek avyav par aanevaale jhatkon ko avyav milakar sah len
 The bottom of the ship is the basic element at the bottom, by which the entire structure is erected
 ise lohe yaa dhale ispaat dwaara teen prakaar se banaaya jaataa he- ikhari moti chhadon, chapati pattiyon athwa platon dwaara
 Mariya is made in more than one and different sizes
 inamen se jo pramukh hota he vah jahaaj ke pende kii madhya rekha par khadaa lagayaa jaataa he
 All together support the whole body
 pathan ke aage ke sire malljod dwaara
 The component that is lifted up and made of cast steel is called Dumbal
 isi main khaanche banaakar bichwala mariya or bahari khol ke plate baitaakar jad die jate hai
 The erected steel component at the back side is added in this way is called Dumbal pillar or Kudas
 radar ko sahaara dene ke liye or yadi ek yaa teen pranoditr yukt jahaaj hon to madhyavarti pranoditr ke ghoomane ke liye bhi isi main jagah banaai jaati he
 The entire structure of the ship is composed
 panjar ke samast ang angel, aayran or pattiyon dwaara hi banaae jate hai
 These registers are double, one inner and the other outer
 jin sthanon par jahaaj kaa nichalaa farsh tikta he, ve bahari or bhitari panjaron ke bich main khadey lagaae jate hai inhen mariya athwa florce bhi kehete hai
 Due to these, the penda becomes very firm
 jahaaj kii donon bagaliyon ke panjaron ko dridhtaa pradaan karne ke liye, unke bich main lamb pattiyaan tathaa aadi sthunaayen laga di jaati hai
 Perpendicular straps are inlayed by rivets with angle plates from the sides of the ship
 sampurna jahaaj kaa panjar kai khandon main banaakar prayek panjar ke upree sire par bhi ek ek dharan laga di jaati he, jo upree deck ke plate ko sahaara detii he
 In ships having more than one deck, one section each is fitted to handle each deck
 upree deck sadaiv ispaat kii platon kaa banaaya jaataa he or usapar lakdi ke takhte baitha die jate hai
 The lower decks are made of wooden planks
 kuch jahaajon main neeche ke deck bhi ispaat kii platon se banaate hai
 It all depends on usage
 jahaaj ke panjar kii aadi dharanon ke bich, unhen sahaara dene ke liye ek ek khambha bhi ispaat kaa laga diya jaataa he
 Ships that have more width have a pillar attached to either side of the middle pillar
 malwahak jahaajon ke godaamon main adhik khuli jagah kii aavashyaktaa padaa karti he
 Hence, other types of tips are employed by not placing pillars in them
 nital patticas- They are protruding out of the outer shell of the ship and are fitted with the purpose of blocking the ambush of the ship
 inke kaaran jahaaj ke khol kii lunthangati main kaaphi avrodh hota he, jisase lunthangati bilkul to nahin rukne paati, parantu kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 Throughout the length of the ship, the steel plates are made of rock-cut rooms, made of steel plates, made of brackets, ranging in height from the bottom of the bottom to the surface of the seawater
 ye kamare bade upyogi hote hai, kyonki jab ki durghatanavash jahaaj ke aavaran main kahin chhed ho jaataa hai, tab samudri pani keval uske nikatavarti kamare main hi bharkar rah jaataa he or shesh jahaaj surakshit rahata he
 Many times water is deliberately filled in a suitable room to balance the balance of goods loaded in the direction of the length of the ship
 kai puraane prakaar ke jahaajon main to ye kamare is prakaar ke bane hote the ki ek se duusare main jane ke liye unki chat main bane chhed main chadhakar duusare ke chhed main utarana hota tha
 Modern ships have doors installed in their walls
 ye chhed or daravaaje rabar kii pattiyaan tathaa clamp lagaakar bilkul jalaabhedya bana die jate hai
 Merchant ships have at most three decks
 ek dekwale jahaaj kii oonchaai pathan se deck tathaa 15 foot, do deck vaale jahaaj kii oonchaai pathan se upree deck tak 24 foot or tan dekwale kii 35 foot ke lagbhag rahati he
 But the overall height of large seaports and cargo ships exceeds this
 jahaajon kaa bahari aavaran - yah ispaat kii chaadaron kaa bana hota he or uski motaai, jahaaj ke pariman, usamen bhare janevaale maal tathaa jis bhaag main vah jadaa jaataa he vahaan ke pani ke dabaav ke anupaat se nishchit kii jaati he
 The bottom of the ship's bottom and the sidewall, also known as the perge, are thickest
 mandaan tathaa kudas kii nikatavarti platen bhi kaaphi moti hoti hai
 Their maximum thickness is one inch
 aavaran platon kii motaai inch ke 20wein bhaag main naapane kii pratha he
 The center of the ship has the maximum width at the bottom, which is called the "joist"
 iske upar kii taraf chaudaai kramash: kam hoti jaati he, jise jahaaj ke madhya bhaag kaa bhitari jhukaav kehete hai
 It is measured on the same side from the top deck
 aage tathaa peeche ke siron ke nikat, neeche kii ore, jahaaj kii chaudaai kramash: kam hoti jaati he, jisase vahaan ke pariched kii akruti v aakaar kii ho jaati he
 The increasing width above this bottom is called divergence of the ship
 inamen unka mukhya dhaanchaa, doharaa panjar or lamb pattiyaan aadi madhya deck tak hi samaapt ho jaati hai
 The superstructure of the vihara deck and the yacht deck is put on the upper and open deck as the upper structure
