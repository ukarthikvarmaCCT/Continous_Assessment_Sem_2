 Major Dhyanchand was born on 29 August 1905 in Allahabad
 unke balya-jivan main khiladeepan ke koi vishesh lakshan dikhaai nahin dete the

 Even in Holland, he was seen breaking his stick in fear of having a magnet in his hockey stick
 japan main dhyanchand kii hockey stick se jis tarah gend chipki rahati thi use dekh kar unki hockey stick main gond lage hone kii baat kahi gai
 There are hardly any tales of Dhyanchand's art of hockey that have been heard about any other player in the world
 unki hockey kii kalakaari dekhakar hockey ke mureed to vaah-vaah kah hi uthte the balki pratidwandvi team ke khilaadi bhi apni sudhabudh khokar unki kalakaari ko dekhne main mashgool ho jate the

 baavjood iske ki kabhi-kabhi in padon kaa prayog ek duusare main gadd-madd ho saktaa he, akaal prasav or mrit-prasav saamanytah garbh vifaltaa ke taur par nahin maane jate
 Accusatory abortion is the only form of medical abortion
 1970 ke dashak main prostaglandin anuroop or 1980 ke dauraan pratiprogestogen mikepristone kii uplabdhta ke pashchaat bheshaj garbhpaat sabhipraay garbhpaat kaa ek vaikalpik tarika ban gaya
 In the quest to get rid of the womb, women sometimes resort to unsafe methods, especially if there is difficulty in getting permission legally
 aisi sthiti main ve yaa to swayan koshish karti hai yaa kisi duusare kii sahaayta leti hai jinka na to paryaapt chikitsakeey prashikshan hota he na hi uchit chikitsakeey suvidhaon tak pahunch
 Such unsafe abortions can cause serious health problems, such as incomplete abortion, sepsis, bleeding and severe damage to internal organs
 prerit garbhpaat lambey samay tak kaaphi bahes kaa strot rahaa he
 Ethical, philosophical, biological, religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to the value system
 garbhpaat kii raay bhrun ke adhikaar, sarkari adhikaar or mahilaon ke adhikaron ke bare main ho sakati he
 In both public and private debates, the argument of the debate was presented in favor of either the moral acceptability of abortion for inducement or abortion, or to support laws prohibiting or prohibiting abortion
 chikitsiya garbhpaat par vishwa medical association ghoshnaptr kehete hai, "paristhitiyon main ek maan ke hit ko uske ajey bachche ke hiton ke saath sangharsh main laane main ek duvidha paidaa hoti he or yah sawaal uthaata he ki garbhavastha ko jaanboojhkar khatm kar diya janaa chahie yaa nahin
 "abortion debates, particularly those related to abortion laws, are often pushed forward by groups advocating one of these two conditions
 virdohi-garbhpaat samooh, jo purna nishedh sahit garbhpaat par adhik kanoonee pratibandhon kaa samarthan karte hai, ve aksar khud ko "samarthak jivan" ke rup main bataate hai, jabaki garbhpaat ke adhikaar samooh, jo is tarah ke kanoonee pratibandhon ke khilaaf hai, swayan ko "samarth vikalp" kehete hai
 Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human with the right to live, making abortion morally akin to killing
 uttararddh kii sthiti kaa tark he ki ek mahila ke paas kuch prajnan adhikaar hai, vishesh rup se chunaav ke liye avadhi ke liye garbhadhaaran karne ke liye yaa nahin
 Abortion can be done on behalf of law due to these reasons- sonographi or eminocentis mata-pita ko prasav ke pehle ling ko jaanane kii anumati detii he
 The development of this technique has led to sex-selective abortion or termination of the fetus on the basis of gender
 ek mahila bhrun kaa chaynaatmak samaapan sabase aam he
 In some countries gender-selective abortions are partly responsible for the birth rate of male and female children
 asia ke kai ilaakon main purush bacchon kii praathamikta kii soochna he, or taiwan, dakshin korea, bharat or china main mahila janmon ko simit karne ke liye garbhpaat kii report kii gai he
 This deviation from the standard birth rate of men and women occurs despite the fact that gender-selective abortions or sex-screening are officially banned in these countries
 china main, ek aitihaasik praathamikta ek nar bachche ke liye ek-bal niti ke kaaran badi he, jo kii 1979 main lagu kii gai
 Many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex-selective abortions
 1994 main 180 rajyon se adhik ne antarrashtriya sammelan main "balika ke viruddh sabhi prakaar ke bhedbhaav or bete kii variyata ke mul kaarnon" ko khatm karne par sahmati jataai, sharton ko 2011 main piesii ke prastaav se bhi ninda kii gai
 The World Health Organization and UNICEF, other UN agencies, have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are significantly less effective in reducing gender-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality

 The number of sub letters is 21, but originally the number of these letters was more than this

 The publication of this poem in the backdrop of full Roman society from the color trains of the time led to two results

 The first dynasty to carry the lead coin was the Satavahana dynasty, and that lead coin was brought from Rome

 Later, the Satavahana dynasty carried this effort forward

 The Satavahana dynasty was established about fifty years before the defeat of the Maurya dynasty
 unka samrajya dakshin bharat kaa sabase pracheen or bada samrajya tha
 In contrast to the ever-changing dynastic landscape of North India, the Satavahanas established an empire in the Deccan unbreakable, indivisible and lasting for a long period, which ruled for nearly four and a half hundred years
 is kaal ke vishay main jitani jaankaree hamen praapt hui he usase hamen satvahanon kii vilakshantaa tathaa vibhinn kshetron main unki advithiya gatividhiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 If the statements of Puranas are to be believed, then the boundaries of this kingdom of Deccan extended to North India
 magadh is samrajya kaa ek hissaa tha, dakshini bharat main bhi failaav tha tathaa purvi se pashchimi samundra tak isaki simaaen vistrut thi
 The empire was formed by the coordination of different species of Malavas, Bhojas, Pathanikas, Rathikas, Andhra, Parindas and Dravidas etc
 of North and South India and in this view the Satavahana Empire was more than that of the Mauryan Empire in the area
 Was structured ye satvahanon dwaara madhya bharat tathaa dakkan main pradutt lambe evam shantipurna shashan kaal kaa hi parinaam tha ki kala evam sthapaty kaa vikaas hua jinke udhaaharan ham pashchim bharat kii shilaon main taraashi hui guhaaon tathaa purvi bharat ke stupon evam viharon main paa sakate he
 During this period, culture also developed immensely and the attraction of Prakrit language reached the courts
 yadhyapi satvaahan rajya ek hindu samrajya tha tathpi unke aadhin buddha dharm kaa advithiya vikaas hua
 There was also great progress in the areas of trade, commerce and water transport

 The number of inscriptions related to them is very less and even in the references given in this presented inscriptions, complete information about the Satavahanas is not available
 unke vishay main hamaare paas purvi dakkan se praapt unniis shilaalekh hi hai
 Which is not used from any point of view to give information about the thirty kings of this dynasty and the long reign of four and a half hundred years

 In this subject, coins received by the kings of the Satavahana dynasty which have been found from eastern and western Deccan and Madhya Pradesh, we get important information about this dynasty

 But due to the dissolution of these coins and the counterfeiting of some coins, many controversies have arisen
 is vishay main saahitiyik stroton ne to or bhi adhik niraash kiya he
 In the original Puranas, due to the parts connected in time, the information given about them in Satavahanas is no longer reliable
 saath hi vibhinn puraanon main satvahanon ke sandarbh main martaky na hone ke kaaran sthiti ore bhi sandehaaspad ho gai he
 Although the Brihada Katha composed by Gunadhaya is believed to have been written under the patronage of the Satavahana kingdom, this work is no longer found in its original form and based on this, the information given in the later versions is different from different scholars
 isi prakaar leelavati jo ki satvaahan shaasha kaal ke sainik abhiyaanon evam vijayon se sambandhit he, par bhi adhik adhik vishwaas nahi kiya ja saktaa
 For this reason, our information about the Satavahana period is limited
 satvahanon ke abhyuday tathaa unke mul nivas sthaan ko le kar vibhinn vidwaanon main gaharaa matbhed he
 The Satavahana and Shatakarni rulers mentioned in the inscriptions and coins are called in the Puranas by the names of Andhra, Andhra-death and Andhra
 is aadhaar par vidwaan is nirnay par pahunche he ki satvaahan athwa shatakarani raja andhron ke samatuly the
 According to Rappson, Smith and Bhandarkar, Satavahana rulers were related to Andhra country

 He is mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmin as a caste that was free from the influence of the Aryans

 Ashoka's inscriptions describe him as one of the people who were under the influence of his empire
 parantu maury samrajya ke patan ke baad unka kya hua iskaa pataa nahi chalata
 Possibly, he had freed himself
 upar varnit itihaaskaar yadhyapi andhrapradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan maanate he tathaapi unki shakti ke kendra ko lekar in vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 Where Smith considers Sri Kakulam as the capital of Satavahanas or Andhra
 parantu satvaahan ke andhron ke saath sambandh ko lekar vidwaanon main matbhed he
 In the inscriptions of the Samavahana dynasty, the rulers of this period are consistently called Satavahanas or Shatakarnis
 saahitiyik granthon main inke liye yadakada shaali vaahan shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But in this context, the word Andhra is not used in any inscription of this dynasty
 duusari ore shilalekhon, sikkon tathaa saahitiyik sroton ke aadhaar par pashchimi bharat ko inkaa mul nivas sthaan mana gaya he
 Evidence of this fact is also found in the early inscriptions of Nanaghat and Saanchi
 is aadhaar par dow gopalchaari ne pratishthan tathaa uske aasapaas ke kshetra ke satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 In addition VS Sukuthankar to Bellary district; h c Rai Chaudhary has considered the southern part of the other country and VV Mirashi as the original abode of Satavahanas on both sides of the river Ganges
 is aadhaar par satvahanon tathaa andhron kaa samatuly evam sajaatiy hona sandehaaspad hi he
 In this subject scholars have suggested that the Satavahanas started their early life in the Deccan and conquered Andhra Pradesh in a short time
 kaalaantar main jab shaq tathaa amir akramanon ke kaaran satvaahan samrajya ke pashchimi tathaa uttari kshetra unke haathon se jate rahe tab kadaachit unki shakti godavari tathaa krishna nadi ke madhya kshetra arthath andhra pradesh tak simit ho gai tathaa ab satvahanon ko andhron ke naam se janaa jane laga
 We do not even know about the origin of Satavahanas
 kuch vidwaanon ne unki tulana ashok ke shilalekhon main varnit satiyaputronse tathaa kuch ne plini dwaara varnit setai se kii he
 Some other scholars have defined the words Shatakarni and Satavahana on the basis of the term Bhasha Vigyan, irrespective of the importance of these words, but based on the inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty it is almost certain that the Satavahanas were also Brahmins like the Sunga and Kanva rulers
 
 is baat kaa pramaan nasik shilaalekh se bhi mil jaataa he jisamen gautami putr shri shatakarni ko ek brahman tathaa khatiya-dap-maan-madan arthath kshatriyon kaa maan mardan karne vaala aadi oopaadhiyon se sushebhit kiya he
 The author of this inscription has compared Gautamiputra to Parasurama
 saath hi datrishatputalika main bhi shalivahanon ko mishrit brahman jati tathaa nagajati se utpann mana gaya he
 There are deep differences among scholars regarding the chronology of the Satavahanas
 aitreyay brahman jo ki paanch sau i0purv main likhaa gaya tha usamen andhron ko aise dasyu bataaya gaya he jo ki arya paridhi se baahar the tathaa jo vishwamitra ke vanshaj the
 On this basis, Dr
 DR Bhandarkar has considered the beginning of the Satavahanas as early as 500 BC
 dovi0e0 smith ke anusaar andhra pehle adhinsth the parantu uski mrityu ke pashchaat ve simukh ke netritv main swatantra ho gaye tathaa yah ghatana teesri shatabdi i0purv main hui
 In this subject, Smith has considered the basis of Puranas according to which a total of thirty rulers of Andhra ruled for about 460 years
 dogopalchaari ne bhi is tathy ko sweekaarte hue yah mana he ki satvaahan vansh kii sthapana lagbhag 235i0purv tathaa uskaa patan lagbhag 255 isvi main hua
 On the basis of the inscription of elephant elephants during the reign of Kharkhel, the ruler of Kalinga, Rappson believes the beginning of the Satavahana dynasty between 220 BCE and 211 AD, but there is a difference in various Puranas regarding the Yasan period of the Satavahanas
 ek ore jaha matsaypurana unka kul yasana kaal 460varsh bataata he vahiin duusari ore brahmanpurana main yah avadhi 456 varsh bataai gai he
 According to the Vayupurana, the Satavahanas ruled for 411 years while Vishnupuran considers their reign as 300 years
 duusari aar dow aar0 ji0 bhandarkar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana 72

 On the basis of a statement mentioned in the Puranas, he has believed that the "shunga Miryatya" Kanva rulers were the servants of the Shunga rulers and ruled alongside them like the Peshwas and the founder of the Satavahana dynasty named Simuk or Shishuka ruled the Kanva king
 After killing Sushraman, he killed both the Kanva and Shung dynasties and subjugated his empire
 parantu yah tathy avishwasaneey he kyoking ham yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanate he ki shunga tathaa kanv vansh ke shaskaon ne kabhi sanyukt rup se shashan nahi kiya tathaa kanv vansh ke sansthaapak vasudev kanv ne antim shunga shaasha devbhuti kii hatya kar shashan kii bagdor sambhaali thi
 The statement of Vayu Purana on the basis of which Dr Bhandarkar has misinterpreted, is rightly defined by Dr Rai Chaudhary
 unke anusaar yah gandyash maatra itnaa hi bataata he ki simuk ne jab kanv vansh kaa ant kar satvaahan vansh kii sthapana kii to usne un shunga upashaskaon bhi samaapt kar diya jo ki kanv vansh ke haathon shunga shaskaon ke parajeet hone ke baad bhi bache rah gaye the
 Hence, Satavahana rulers took over the reins of their rule by ending the Kanva dynasty in 29 BC
 parantu is sab karkon ke hote hue bhi is sambhaavna se inkaar nahi kiya ja saktaa ki simuk jisane 23varshon tak shashan kiya vah kuch samay pehle hi arthath pehali shatabdi i0pus0 ke madhya main hi singhasanarudh ho gaya hoga
 Simuk was the founder of the Satavahana dynasty and ruled for almost 23 years from 235 BC to 212 BC
 yadhyapi uske vishay main hamen adhik jaankaree nahi milti tathaapi puraanon se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki kanv shaskaon kii shakti kaa naash kar tathaa bache hue shunga mukhiyaaon kaa daman karke usne satvaahan vansh kii neenv rakhi
 In the Puranas, in addition to Symek, he is also called Shishuk, Sindhuk and Shiprak etc
 jain anushrutiyon ke anusaar simuk ne apane shashan kaal main jain tathaa buddha mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya, parantu apane shashan kaal ke antkaal main vah pathbhrasht tathaa croor ho gaya jis karanvash use padchyut kar uski hatya kar di
 After Simuk's death, his younger brother Kanha ascended the throne
 apane 18 varshon ke kaarykaal main kanha ne samrajya visataar kii niti ko apanaaya
 The inscription of Nashik suggests that the Satavahana empire spread west to Nashik in the time of Kanha
 shatakarni-p kanha ke uparant shatakarni pratham gaddi par baitha
 According to the Puranas, he was the son of Kanha
 parantu dow gopalchaari simuk ko shatakarni pratham kaa pita maanate hai
 Some scholars have believed that its rule lasted for two years, but Neelkanth Shastri has considered his reign from 194 BC to 185 BC
 jo bhi ho yah suspasht he ki uskaa shashan kaal bahut lambaa nahi tha
 But despite being short, the tenure of Shatkarni i is more important from some perspectives
 satvaahan shaskaon main vah pehla tha jisane is vansh ke shaskaon main priy evam prachlit, ‘‘shatakarni’’ shabd se apana namakaran kiya
 According to the Nanaghat inscription, Shatkarni expanded his empire and performed two Ashwamedha Yajna and one Rajasuya Yajna during his work
 uski rani nayanika ke ek shilaalekh se hamen yah gyaat hota he ki shatakarni pratham ne pashchimi malwa ke saath-saath anup tathaa vidarbha pradeshon bhi jeet liya
 If Shatkarni i is the only ruler mentioned in the archway of the Sanchi Stupa, it also proves that in his time central India was under the authority of the Satavahanas
 vah apane chhate se kaary kaal me samraat ban gaya tathaa usne dakshin pathpati tathaa apratihat chakra aadi oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kii
 It is suggested on the basis of the similarity of the script used in the Nanaghat article and the Elephant Gumpha writings, that perhaps in the second year of the reign of this Shatkarni rulers, the great ruler of Kalinga, Kharkhel was defeated in the battle field
 shatakarni pratham kii patni nayanika athwa naganika angeey kul ke ek maharathi trankairo kii putree thi
 After the death of Shatkarni I, his two minor sons Vedashree and Satashri sat on the throne
 parantu alpavyask hone ke kaaran prashasan kii sari bagdor unki maa nayanika ke haathon main aa gai jisane apane pita kii sahaayta se shashan chalaaya
 It seems that Vedashree died at a young age and Satshri took over as his successor
 parantu puraana is vishay main ekamat he ki shatakarni pratham ke pashchaat purnotsang naamak raja satvaahan singhaasana par asin hua
 Regardless of the name of the fourth Satavahana ruler, it is certain that it was during the reign of this ruler that Pushyamitra Sunga conquered the last Mauryan ruler Brahadratha and took over the kingdom of Magadha
 matsaypurana main skandastambhi kaa ullekh satvaahan vansh ke paanchaven shaasha ke rup main keya he parantu adhiktar vidwaan is naam ko kalpit maanate hai
 Shatkarni II ruled from about 166 BC to 111 BC
 yah kadaachit vahi shaasha tha jiskaa varnan hithigumpha tathaa bhilsa shilalekhon main hua he
 It seems that during its reign, the Satavahanas snatched eastern Malwa from a successor of Pushyamitra Sunga

 After Lambodar, his son Appellant ascended the throne
 apilak jo ki aathvaan satvaahan shaasha tha, in donaan ke madhya kaa kaal satvahanon ke sandarbh main andhkaar yug mana gaya he jisamen keval kuntal shatakarni ke kaal ko hi apwaad mana ja saktaa he
 Kuntal Shatkarni was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas after the appellant
 kamasutra main vatsayan ne kuntal shatakarni kaa ullekh karte hue likhaa he ki usne apni ungaliyon ko kanchi ke rup main prayog kiya tathaa iske prahaar se uski pataraani malayavati kii mrityu ho gai
 In Kavyamamsha, Rajeshwar describes Kuntal Shatkarni as saying that he had ordered his queens living in his Raniwas to use only Prakrit language
 haal satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatpurna shaasha tha
 Although he ruled only four years, his reign was very important in some subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yadi aarmabhik satvaahan shaskaon main shatakarni pratham yoddha ke rup main sabase mahaan tha to haal shantidoot ke rup main agrani tha
 Hall also had a literary interest and became famous as a poet emperor
 uske naam kaa ullekh puraana, leelavati, saptshati, abhidhaan chintamani aadi granthon main hua he
 It is believed that Saptashati or Satsai was written recently in the Prakrit language
 brihadakatha ke lekhak gunanty bhi haal kaa samakaleen tha tathaa kadaachit pashachi bhashaa main likhi is pustak kii rachana usne haal hi ke sangrakshan main kii thi
 In Kalantar, the three books named Buddhavami's Brihakatha-'ilok-sangra ', Kshemendra's brihadatha-manjari and Somdev's Kathasaritasagar originated from the Briha story of Gunadhya

 Hall tried to marry Lilavati
 kivdanti he ki haal ne purvi dakkan main kuch sainik abhiyaan kiye parantu saakshyon ke abhaav main adhiktar vidwaan ise galat maanate hai
 However, in the recent reign of Satavahana rulers, in addition to the political field, there was a lot of development in literary and economic areas as well as the development of trade and commerce cities and the advancement of water transport which during the reign of second Mundlak or Puridransen in the first century AD
 Reached its culmination, however, for about fifty years to come proved very difficult for the Satavahana Empire Happened
 aisa prathit hua maano ke pashchim kshatrapon ke rup main hue videshi akraman ke saath hi satvaahan samrajya kaa patan hone ko he
 The Kushans were spreading in the north-west and under their pressure, the Shaka and Pahlav rulers were eager to fight with the Satavahanas, attracted towards central and western India
 kshahraat vansh ke pashchimi kshatrapon ne apane ko pashchima raajputana, gujarat tathaa kathiyawad main sthapit kar liya tha
 These Shaka rulers attacked the Satavahana kingdom from 35 AD to about 90 AD
 unhone satvahanon se purvi tathaa payichama malwa pradeshon ko jeeta; uttari konkan uttari maharashtra, jo ki satvaahan shakti kaa kendra tha tathaa banavaasi tak faile dakshini maharashtra par bhi apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 The first ruler of the Kshatra dynasty was Ghoomak whose sources of information are some coins which have been found mostly from the coastal region of Gujarat Kathiawar and Yadakada Malwa
 ghumak kaa uttaradhikari nahpaan tha jisaki jaankaree hamen uske bahusankhya sikkon par raja kii oopaadhi dhaaran kii he
 At the same time, inscriptions got his titles Kshatrap and Mahakshatrap
 nasik, karle tathaa junar ke uske shilaalekh; esake bahusankhya sikken tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdaat ke dwaara uttari tathaa dakshini bharat main die gaye daan sab ke sab ye pramanit karte hai ki nahpaan ke samay main kshahraat vansh kaa samrajya kaaphi vistut tha tathaa usne satvaahan shaskaon se kaaphi bada pradesh chin kar hi apane samrajya ko itnaa vishaal banaaya tha
 Nahapan and his Jamaat Shaka Ashwadat unleashed the Satavahana power in the western Deccan by conquering Malwa, the Narmada Valley, northern Konkan, the western part of Berar and and southern Maharashtra
 ve satvaahan raja jo nahpaan ke haathon parajeet hue kadaachit sundar shatakarni, chakor shatakarni tathaa shivsaati the jinka ki kaarykaal bahut hi chota tha parantu yah paristhitiyaan adhik samay tak nahi chali tathaa gautami putr shri shatakarni ke satvaahan shaasha banate hi is kshahraat-satvaahan sangharsh main nayaa mode aayaa
 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 kuch visheshgyon dwaara gautamiputra satkarni ko raja shalivahan bhi mana jaataa he
 He united the whole of India and defended against foreign invaders
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya
 He is described as the doer of Saka, Yavan and Pahlav Sasakas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i
 pus
 main ho gai thi
 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho
 But all the information related to it is found in books called 'the Principle of Average' written by his grandson Tje Sje and 'mahan Shiksha' written by his disciple Tsong Sin
 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China
 kanfushas ke shishyon kii sankhya sab milakar praaia: 3,000 tak pahunch gai thi, kintu unamem se 75 ke lagbhag hi ucch koti ke pratibhashali vidvan the
 His dear disciples used to stay near him
 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
 manushya ko yah swaabhaavik gun ishwar se praapt hua he
 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God
 kaary bindu ek ikai he jiske jariye yah mapa jaataa he ki koi soochna pranali apane prayokta ko kitni vyavsaayik kaary kii suvidha detii he
 Work points are a measuring unit of the IFPUG work size measurement method
 iepapiuji kii ethesam vidhi iesao sweekrut tantransh maapak he jiske jariye soochna pranali ke prayokta ko pradutt suvidhaon ke aadhaar par uske aakaar ko napa jaataa he
 This measurement is not affected by the technology used to implement information systems
 iepapiuji ethesam vidhi iesao maanakon dwaara sweekrut tantransh ko kaary ke aadhaar par maapne ke paanch maanakon main se ek he
 Function points were defined by ibm's Alan Albrecht in 1979 through "a new perspective towards devices"
 tantransh kii kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaayen ke bare main pataa lagaaya jaataa he or phir harek ko in paanch prakaaron main baanta jaataa he - pradaan, prashn, aadan, aantarik filein va bahya antaraprishth
 Once the work is identified and its type determined, the same complexity is assessed and accordingly some action points are provided
 har kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaa kisi prayokta ke vyapaar sambandi kaary se sidhaa sambandhit hota he, udhaaharan ke liye pradaan ke liye saamagree pravishti yaa poochtacha ke liye prayokta dwaara prashn
 This is necessary because through this, the functions captured in the work points can be easily understood as user-centric requirements, but this hides the internal activities, although they will take resources to implement them
 beete kai saalon main is kathith kamazori se nipatane ke liye kai tareeke sujhaaye gaye hai, lekin aisi koi iesao maanya ethesam vidhi nahin he jo maap main kalan vidhi kii jatilta ko tavajjo detii ho
 There are also some different methods to deal with this from the Albrecht based IFPUG method: kisi soochna pranali ke aakaar ko naap ke use kaary binduon main abhivyakt karne kii vidhi ko kaary bindu vishleshan kaha jaataa he
 Global collaborative FPA user groups, such as NESMA and IFPU, continue to work to improve this method continuously
 kaary bindu vishleshan kisi soochna pranali ke kaaryaatmak aakaar ko kaary binduon kii sankhya main abhivyakt karata he 
 There are many benefits to using action points and functional shape can be used for many types of projects and organization decisions such as: kai sanghathan alag alag alag shuddhta str tak kaary binduon ko napate hai, yah is par nirbhar he ki tantrash kaa aakaar antat kis uddeshy se napa ja rahaa he
 FPA can also be used to detect the test effort of an information system; its formula is test case = 1
2 kaary binduon ke jariye kaaryatmak paripekshya se pranaaliyon ko mapa jaataa he
 There is no difference in the technology used
 bhashaa, vikaas vidhi yaa yantransh jo bhi ho, kisi pranali ke kaary binduon kii sankhya nahin badalegi
 If changed, the effort involved in building only those action points
 kaarysambandhi prayokta aavashyaktaayen do prakaar kii hai - saamagree kaary va len del kaary
 These are divided into 5 types by the IFPUG and NESMA FSM methods and based on these, points of action are provided
 saamagree kaary → aantarik taarkik filein: prayokta maanya, taarkik rup se sambandhit saamagree kaa samooh udhaaharan : karmchaaree fil main sanchit karmchaaree saamagree 
 Content Work → External Interface Files: Logically related content, for reference only, content remains outside the application
 bahya antaraprishth fil kisi anya fil ke liye aantarik taarkik fil hogi
 Example: Content shared by a company outside its system
 lenden kaary → bahya aadan: baahar se saamagree praapt kar ke aantarik taarkik fil main sanjona
 Examples - adding users, adding employees
 is len dein main saamagree kaa jo manyakaran hota he vah bahya aadan nahin he
 For example, postal registration is not an external exchange by itself
 isamen kai len dein hai jaise ki dak pate kii pushti, dak pate kii uplabdhta jaanchna or saamagree jamaa karnaa
 Only the eventual submission of material is external input
 baaki sab bahya prashn honge
 Transaction Functions → External Render: In this the internal material goes out and this material is the post received material
 udhaaharan: kar gananaa, aay gananalenden kaary → bahya prashn: bahya saamagree andar aati he par yah aantarik taarkik filon main sanjoyi nahin jaati he
 Internal content goes out but without any calculation
 udhaaharan: atm main jaanchna ki kitne paise hai, ek prashn ke jariye karmchaaree kii jaankaree praapt karnaa
 There has been criticism of work points and many other system measurements, that its benefits are far less than the costs and intricacies of using it
 kaary binduon kii gananaa karne main lage prayaas kaa keval aanshik truti ghataav he, kuch is vajah se ki tantransh kii laagat ke andaaze main bhinnata kaa adhikansh iske tahat aata hi nahin he (jaise ki vyapaar main badlaav, seemaa main badlaav, aniojit sansaadhan simittaayen yaa praathamiktaaon main badlaav aadi
 Also, if using this measure to decide whether to invest in this mechanism or not, it is argued that the benefit of the policy should be measured rather than the cost
 anuprayukt soochna arthshaastra, jo in maapon ke aarthik mulyon kii gananaa karata he, aksar prayoktaaon ke maapan kaa prayaas anya muddon main kharch karne ko prerit karata he

 Alcohol: - If one or more hydrogen atoms are substituted with an organic compound by one or more -OH groups, the compounds formed are called alcohols
 yogic me upasthit -OH samooh kii sankhya ke aadhaar par ise chaar bhaago me baanta gaya he
 It is divided into three parts: - 1
 Primary Alcohol: - When the hydrogen atom is substituted from the primary carbon by the -OH group, the primary alcohol is formed
 jaise :- methenul
 Secondary alcohol: - When the hydrogen atom is substituted from the secondary carbon by the -OH group, the secondary alcohol is formed
 jaise :- 2-propenul tritiyak alcohol :- jab tritiyak carbon se hydrogen parmaanu kaa pratisthaapan -OH samooh dwaara kar diya jaataa he to tritiyak alcohol banataa he
 Such as: - Methyl propane 2-all
 alcohol kaa namakaran :- There are several methods of manufacturing alcohol: - udyog main methil alcohol tathaa ethil alcohol kaa pramukh sthaan he
 Until recently, methyl alcohol in commercial quantities was obtained only by dry distillation of wood
 is vidhi main lakdi ko lohe ke bade-bade bakyantron main, jinamein sheetak lage rahete hai, hawa kii anupasthiti main 500° centegrade par garm karne se nimnlikhit padaarth banate hai : The acid is separated from the pyroliginous acid as calcium acetate; Now the liquid that remains is separated from the lime by dissolving acetone
 is kasht spirit main shuddh methil alcohol 70 se 80% tak hota he
 In this method the expenditure is more and the attainment of alcohol is less
 at: udyog ke liye alcohol sanshleshan vidhi dwaara taiyaar karte hai
 At fifty or more atmospheric pressure, the hydro-gas with an appropriate catalyst at 400 ° C
 But by heating, methyl alcohol is formed
 methil alcohol teevr vishaiylla padaarth he
 Thus, its main purpose is to make ethyl alcohols a must
