 usee raat unani sena kii tukdi ghode se baahar nikal aayi or baaki unani sena ke liye dwaar khol diye, jo andhere kii chadar main waapas aa gayi thi
 The Greek army entered the city of Troy and destroyed it, winning the war and ending it
 unani parampara ke anusaar, homeric ionic bhashaa main ghode ko kaath kaa ghoda tathaa "gift horse" kaha jaataa he
 Symbolically, any such move was called a "trojan horse" by inviting the enemy to a safe place and targeting it
 in dinon ise praayah "virus yukt" computer kaaryakramon se bhi joda jaataa he or upabhoktaaon ko upyogi athwa hanirahit bataakar sthapit karne or chalaane ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 According to Kuintus Smirnas, Odysseus conceived the idea of building a huge wooden horse, hiding a specific army troop inside it, and fooling the Trojans and rolling the horse on wheels as a symbol of their victory
 
 ipeos ke netritv main, unaniyon ne teen din main lakdi ke ghode kaa nirmaan kiya
 According to Odysseus' plan a man was to live outside the horse; Which the Greeks were supposed to pretend to leave the horse as a gift for the Trojans and leave it behind
 keval ek unani sipaahi sinon ne hi is bhoomika ke liye swayamsevak bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Virgil describes the actual encounter between Sinon and the Trojans: Sinon successfully convinces the Trojans that the Greeks have left him behind
 sinon trogence ko bataata he ki vah ghoda unaniyon dwaara devi athena ko unke troy ke mandir ko apavitra karne ke paap kii kshatipurti karne ke liye or unki ghar ke liye surakshit yatra ko sunishchit karne ke liye ek bhent he
 The reason for making the horse so large was to prevent the Trojans from transporting it to their city and to collect Athena's hermitage for themselves
 sinon se poochtacha ke samay, trogen pujari laokun ko sajeesh kaa anumaan ho jaataa he or ve trogence ko chetavanee dete hai, virgil dwaara likhi gayi ye panktiyaan prasiddh hai "timeo Danos et dona ferentes" 
 isse pehle ki kisi trogen ko uski chetavanee par yakeen aata, bhagwaan posidon ne do samudri naagon ko uskaa or uske putron antifntes or thimbreys kaa galaa ghotane ke liye bhej diya
 Kasandra, the prophet of Troy and daughter of King Priam, also said that the horse would collapse the city and the royal family
 uski bhi upeksha kii gayi jiske kaaran unka vinaash or ve yuddh haar gaye
 This incident is mentioned in the Odyssey: !' 4
271 ff The most elaborate and most well-known version is Enid, written by Virgil, in Book 2
 pustak II main laokun kaa kathan "equo ne credite, Teucri shaamil he
 Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et ferentes
 The modern saying, "one should be careful with the gifts brought by the Greeks" originated from here only
 tees sainik trogen horse ke pet main or do jasoos uske munh main chhip gayi
 Other sources have given different numbers; Apollodorus 50; Zetzes 23; And Kuintus Smyrness has given thirty names but it is also said that there were more soldiers there

 Their names are as follows: homer ke anusaar, troy pani kii ek nahar, hellyspont, jo asia minore or europe ko alag karti he, ke upree kinare par sthit he
 In the 1870s, Heinrich Schleiman discovered it
 homer dwaara diye gayi vivaran ke anusaar usne turki main hisarlik main khudaai shuru kii or ek ke upar ek nirmit kai shaharon ke khandhiron ko dhundh nikaala
 anek shahar hinsaatmak dhang se nasht kar diye gayi the, lekin yah spasht nahin he ki homer kaa troy koun sa tha
 The Pusanians, who lived two hundred years after Christ, wrote in their account of Greece, "the work of Epius was to make a crack in the wall of the Trojan by a device, it is known to all that the reason for the foolishness of the Phrygians
 Do not believe "frigians here mean Trojans

 At that time the Assyrians used animal names for siege organizations; So it is possible that the Trojan horse should be something like this
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki vastav main trogen horse kisi bukamp kaa ek rup ho jo ladaaiyon ke bich aayaa ho, jisane troy kii deevaaron ko kamazor kar unhen akraman ke liye khulaa chhod diya ho; devtaa posidon ne samudr, ghodon or bhukampon ke ishwar ke rup main tripaksheeya kaary kiya
 Structural damage on Troy VI - its location is similar to that shown in Homer's Elyad, and the artifacts found also indicate that it was a place of extraordinary trade and power - indicating that there must have been an earthquake indeed
 aam taur par troy viia ko homer kaa troy mana jaataa he
 There may also be a hint towards the Trojan cavalry of the Trojan horse Hector
 ho saktaa he ki dushman ne khud ko is ashwarohi sena tukdi ke rup main chipaaya ho or uski aadh main bina kisi poochtacha ke troy main le jaye gayi hon

 Chang'e The ceremony of the mid-autumn Festival is strongly associated with the legend of Houyi and Chang'e, one of the moon goddess immortality

 haalanki, katha ke sabase sanskarnon nimnlikhit tatwon ke kuch badlaav shaamil: Houyi, archer, ek samraat, yaa to udaar yaa kubuddhi he or ek ke 
 One version of the legend states that Houyi was an immortal and Chang'e was a beautiful young girl, the queen mother of Yudi West, the palace of the Jade Emperor
 Houyi the other immortals, who then aroused him jealousy before the Jade Emperor
 Houyi and his wife, Chang'e, were later banished from heaven

 Houyi had to hunt to survive and became a skilled and famous archer

au Houyi took the pill home and hid it under a manjhi articleid
 One day, Houyi was called away again by Emperor Yao
 During her husband's absence, Chang'e, noticed a white beam of light pointing from the rafter and discovered the bullet
 Chang'e swallowed him and immediately realized that he could fly
 Houyi ghar laut aae, saakaar kya hua tha vah apni patni fatkaar laga

 The second version of the legend, similar to the one above, is saying that Chang'e swallowed the pill of immortality because Peng, a Houyi of several trainee archers, is different in trying to force him to shoot her
 
 jaanate hue bhi ki vah band peng nahin lard saktaa he, Chang'e koi chaara nahin balki khud goli nigal tha saanchaa:prashasti patr kii jarurat Other versions say that Houyi and Chang'e still live in heaven at the time that Houyi nine immortals of the Sun
 Houyi and Chang'e were the sons of punishment by the sun birds Jade Emperor, who forced them to live on Earth as humans
 dekh rahaa he ki Chang'e atyant amarta kii use nuksaan par dukhi mahasoos kiya, Houyi ko goli he ki ise behaal hoga khojane kaa faisla kiya
 At the end of his hunt, he meets the Queen Mother of the West, who agreed to give him the shot, but warns him that each person will only need one half of the shot to achieve immortality
 Houyi brought the pill home and stored it in a case
 He warned Chang'e not to open the case and then left home for a while
 Like Pandora in Greek mythology, Chang'e became inquisitive
 He opened the case and found the bullet, just as Houyi was returning home
 nervas ki Houyi use pakadaney ke liye, cese kii saamagree kii khoj karenge, vah galati se puure goli nigal karne ke liye or adhik maatra kii vajah se aasmaan main naav shuru kar diya
 Some versions of the legend do not refer to Houyi or Chang'e as being previously immortal and initially require them instead of humans as current mortals
 vahaan bhi kahani ke sanskaran jisamen Houyi nau surya kii maut ho gai or logon ko bachaane ke liye ek inaam ke rup main raja banaaya gaya tha
 However, King Houyi became a dictator who either stole the pill of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West or learned that he could make such a pill every night for a hundred nights by grinding the body of a different teenage boy
 Chang'e stole the pill and swallowed it herself, either to stop more boys being killed or her husband's tyrannical mold from lasting forever: the citation needed to stop the rule

 In addition to the indigenous story of the banyan tree, other legends are widely told, including the story of the Moon Lady and the story of the carp who wanted to become a dragon

 computer jagat main, ek scinar ek aisa upkaran he, jo chitron, mudrit paathya-saamagree, hastlekhan yaa kisi vastu ko prakaashiya rup se scan karata he or ise ek digital chitra main roopantarit karata he
 Common examples found in offices include a variety of desktop scanners, in which documents are placed on a glass surface for scanning
 hand-held scanners, jinamein upkaran ko haath se hilaayaa jaataa he, kaa vikaas paathya-samagri ko scan karanevaali "chhadiyon" se lekar audyogic dizine, reverse ejineering, pareekshan or maapan, orthotics, khelon or anya anuprayogon ke liye prayukt 3D scanners tak hua he
 Mechanically operated scanners that rotate the document are commonly used for large-format documents, where flat-bed use would be impractical
 aadhunik scanners main chitra samvedak ke rup main vishisht taur par ek charge-kapald divaais yaa ek contact image sensor kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jabaki puraane drum scinar chitra samvedak ke rup main ek photomultiplir tub kaa prayog karte hai
 a rotary scanner, used for scanning high-speed documents, is another type of drum scanner that uses a series of ccds in place of a photomultiplier
 planetary scinar, jo pustakon or dastavejon ke chitra lete hai, tathaa 3D scinar, jinka prayog vastuon ke tri-aiami model banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, scanners ke anya prakaar hai
 Another category of scanners includes digital camera scanners, which are based on the concept of reprographic cameras
 lagaataar badhate rezolyushan or kampan-pratirodh jaisi nai visheshtaon ke kaaran, digital camere saamaanya scanners ke ek aakarshak vikalp ban gayi hai
 Although they still have some drawbacks compared to traditional scanners, digital cameras also offer some benefits, such as speed, portability, and the gentle digitization of thick documents without damaging the joint of a book
 nai praudyogikiyaan 3D scanners ko digital camaron ke saath sanyojit karke vastuon ke purna-rangeen, prakaash-yathartwaadee 3D pratimaan nirmit karti hai
 In the field of biomedical research, devices used to identify DNA micro-chains are also called scanners
 ye scinar sookshmdarshiyon ke samaan ucch-rezolyushan vaale system hote hai
 Identification is done via CCD or a photomultiplier tube
 scanners ko praarambhik telephotography input upkarnon, jinamein ek ekal photoditactor ke saath 60 yaa 120 rpm kii maanak gati ghumta hua drum hota tha, ke parvarti mana ja saktaa he
 They send a linear analog AM signal through wires carrying standard telephone sound
 , which synchronously print the proportional intensity on a particular paper
 is pranali kaa prayog press main 1920 ke dashak se lekar 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak kiya jaataa rahaa
 Color images were sent as three separate RGB images, chronologically filtered, but they were used only on special occasions due to the high transmission costs
 flatsbed scanners or saste film scanners main pai jane vaali charge-kapald-divaais shrinkhalaaon ke vipareet drum scanners photomultiplir tub kii sahaayta se chitratmak jaankaree ekatrit karte hai
 Reflective and transmitting original artwork is mounted on an acrylic cylinder, scanner drum, which rotates at a high speed when the material being scanned is passing in front of the precision optics to convey the image to the pmts
 sabase aadhunik rangeen drum scanners teen sumelit pmts kaa prayog karte hai, jinamein kramshah laal, nila or haraa prakaash hota he
 The light produced from the original artwork is divided into three separate beam masses consisting of red, blue and green colors on the optical bench of the scanner
 drum scinar kaa naam spasht acrylik silinder, drum, ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, jis par mul kalakriti ko scanning ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 Depending on their size, it is possible to place original artifacts up to 11x17 "in size, but the maximum size depends on the producer
 drum scanners kii ek adwitiya visheshta yah he ki inamen sample kshetra or chhidr ke aakaar ko swatantra rup se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The sample size is the area the scanner encoder produces to read a single pixel
 chhidr vah vaastavik khulaa sthaan hota he, jo prakaash ko scinar ke optical bench main pravesh karne kii anumati detaa he
 This ability to control holes and sample sizes separately is particularly useful for smoothening film particles when scanning for negatives of black-and-white and original color artifacts
 drum scanners jahaan paravartansheel or sancharanshil donon prakaar kii kalakritiyon ko scan kar paane main sakasham hote hai, vahiin ek acchhee gunvattta vaala flats-bed scinar paravartansheel kalakriti se acha scan utpann kar saktaa he
 As a result, drum scanners are rarely used for scan printing, as high-quality, inexpensive flatbed scanners are now readily available
 haalanki, film main drum scanners abhi bhi ucch-shrenee vaale anuprayogon ke pasandida upkaran bane hue hai
 Since wet film can also be placed on a scanner and the sensitivity of pmts is exceptional, drum scanners are able to capture very subtle details from the film's original artwork
 keval kuch hi companiyon ne drum scanners kaa utpaadan jari rakhaa he
 Although both new and used units have fallen in price over the past decade, they still require significant monetary investment compared to CCD flatbeds or film scanners
 haalanki drum scanners kii maang abhi bhi bani hui he kyonki unamem ucch rezolushan, rang shreneekaran or mulya sanrachana vaale scan utpann kar paane kii kshamta hoti he
 Additionally, since drum scanners are capable of resolutions up to 12,000 PPI, it is generally recommended to use them when increasing the size of the image to be scanned
 adhikansh chitra-kala kaaryon main, atyadhik-ucch-gunvattta vaale flatsbed scanners ne drum scanners kaa sthaan le liya he kyonki ve kam mahange or adhik tej hote hai
 However, drum scanners are still used in high-grade applications such as archiving images in a museum-like quality and publishing high-quality advertisements in books and magazines, etc
 iske atirikt, purv main upyog kii ja chuki icaayiyon kii ucch uplabdhta ke kaaran, anek fine-art photographers drum scinar le rahe hai, jisase in mashiinon ke liye ek naye prakaar kaa bazaar nirmit hua he
 The earliest scanner was a drum scanner
 iskaa nirmaan rasel karsh ke netritv main US naishanal beuro of standrds main karyrat ek samooh dwaara 1957 main kiya gaya tha
 The first image scanned on this machine was a 5-square-cm image of Walden's son Walden, who was three months old at the time
 is shwet-shyaam chitra ke ek ore kaa rezolyushan 176 pixel tha
 a flatbed scanner is usually composed of a square piece of glass with a bright light beneath it that illuminates the piece and an optical chain rotating in CCD scanning
 ccd-prakaar ke scanners main vishisht rup se laal, hare or nile filters ke saath samvedakon kii teen panktiyaan hoti hai
 CIS scanning consists of flickering red, green, and blue leds designed for publication and a rotating set of single-color photodiodes attached to it for storing light
 jin chitron ko scan kiya janaa ho, unhen neeche kii ore munh karke kaanch par rakhaa jaataa he, pariveshi prakaash ko baahar rakhane ke liye ise ek apaardarshee cover se dhank diya jaataa he or samvedak shrinkhalaa va prakaash strot puure kshetra ko padhate hue kaanch ke chaukor tukade se guzarate hai
 Therefore, due to its reflected light, the image is visible only to the detector
 paardarshee chhaviyaan is prakaar kaary nahin karatin or unke liye vishesh sahaayak sadhano kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo unhen upree bhaag se prakashit karte hai
 Many scanners provide this feature as an option
 "slide" yaa negative film ko ek upkaran main scan kiya ja saktaa he, jise vishesh rup se isi uddeshy ke liye nirmit kiya jaataa he
 Typically unedited film plaques of up to six frames or four mounted slides are inserted into a carrier, which is carried through a lens and CCD sensor within the scanner by a stepwise motor
 kuch model mukhyatah samaan-aakaar ke scans kaa prayog karte hai
 There are two types of hand scanners: documents and 3D scanners
 Hand-held document scanners are human devices that are dragged across the surface of the image to be scanned
 is prakaar se dastavejon kii scanning karne ke liye haath ko sthir rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he kyonki ek asmaan scanning dar hone par ek viroopit chitra utpann hoga- scinar se nikalne vaala thodaa-sa prakaash yah suchit karegaa ki kya gati bahut adhik tej thi
 They typically have a "start" button, which is captured by the user during the scan; There are some switches to determine the optical resolution; And there is a roller, which produces a clock-pulse for synchronization with the computer
 adhikansh hand held scanners ek rang vaale hote the or chitra ko prakashit karne ke liye hare leds kii ek shrinkhalaa se prakaash utpann karte the
 a typical hand scanner also had a small window through which the documents being scanned could be viewed
 ve 1990 ke dashak ke prarambh main lokapriy the or saamanytah unamem ek vishisht prakaar ke computer ke liye vishisht swaamitv vaala ek interphes modul, saamanytah ek ataari ST yaa camodor emiga, hota tha
 Although the popularity of document scanning has waned, the use of hand-held 3D scanners remains popular for many applications, including industrial design, reverse engineering, inspection and analysis, digital production, and medical applications
 maanviya haathon kii asmaan gati kii kshatipurti karne ke liye, adhikansh 3D scanning system sandarbh chinhon kii sthapana par ashrith hote hai- vishishtatah aasanjak paravartansheel tabs, jinka prayog scinar dwaara tatwon ko panktibaddh karne or sthitiyon kaa sthaan chihnit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Typically scanners read red-green-blue data from the series
 iske baad kisi malikana elgorithm ke dwaara is data par prakriya karke vibhinn pradarshan sthitiyon ke anusaar isamen sudhaar kiya jaataa he or ise upkaran ke input / output interphes ke madhyam se computer tak bhej diya jaataa he
 The color consistency can vary depending on the characteristics of the scanning chain, but is usually at least 24 bits
 ucch gunvattta vaale modelon main rang gaharaai 48 bit yaa isse adhik hoti he
 Another qualifying criterion for a scanner is its resolution measured in pixels per inch, which is often referred to as samples per inch in a more accurate form
 scinar ke vaastavik prakaashiya rezolyushan, ekmaatr arthpurna maapdand, kaa prayog karne ke bajaay utpaadak antarveshit rezolyushan kaa ullekh karnaa pasand karte hai, jo ki software antarveshan ke kaaran bahut ucch hota he
 As of 2009, a high-grade flatbed scanner can scan up to 5400 ppi and a good drum scanner has an optical resolution of 12,000 ppi
 aksar utpaadak 19,200 ppi tak ucch antarveshit rezolyushan kaa daawa karte hai; lekin aise aankadon kii sarthakata bahut kam he kyonki sambhavit antarveshit pixlon kii sankhya aseemit hoti he
 The file size created increases with the square of the resolution; By doubling the resolution value, the file size increases four times
 anivaary rup se ek aisa rezolyushan chunaa janaa chahie, jo upkaran kii kshamtaaon kii seemaa ke bheetar ho, paryaapt vivaran bachaakar rakhata ho or bahut bade aakaar kii file nirmit na karata ho
 File size can be reduced by taking some quality loss by using "lossy" compression methods such as JPEG for a given resolution
 yadi sarvottam sambhav gunvattta aavashyak ho, to kshatirahit sampidan kaa prayog karnaa chahie; aavashyaktaa hone par is prakaar ke kisi chitra se kam gunvattta vaali chote aakaar kii file banaai ja sakati he 
 Density limit is the third important parameter of a scanner
 ek ucch ghanatv seemaa kaa arth yah he ki scinar ek hi scan main chaaya ke vivaranon or dipti ke vivaranon ko punarutpaadit kar saktaa he
 By combining full-color with 3D models, modern handheld scanners can reproduce the entire material electronically
 rangeen 3D printeron kii upasthiti anek udyogon or vyavsaayon main prayukt anuprayogon main in padaarthon ke achook laghurupan kii kshamta pradaan karti he
 Document scanning is only part of this process
 scan kiya gaya chitra tabhi upyogi hota he, jab ise scinar se computer par chal rahe kisi anuprayog tak sthanantarit kiya jaae
 isamen do buniyadi mudde hai: bhautik rup se scinar ko computer se kis prakaar joda gaya he or anuprayog scinar se soochna kis prakaar grahan karata he
 The amount of data generated by a scanner can be very large: a 24-bit uncompressed 9 "X11" image of 600 DPI contains 100 megabytes of data, which must be transferred and stored
 haalia scinar data kii itani maatra kuch hi secondon ke samay main utpann kar sakate hai, jiske kaaran ek teevr sangyojan vaanchit hota he
 Scanners communicate with their host computers using one of the following physical interfaces, which are placed in order from slowest to fastest: nabbe ke dashak ke prarambh main, vyavsaayik flatsbed scanners vyavsaayik prayoktaaon par lakshyit the
 Some vendors) allowed scanners connected to a host computer to act as scanners accessible by all users of a local computer network
 yah, udaahranarth, prakashkon, mudran sthalon aadi ke liye, bahut upyogi sabit hua
 This functionality gradually ended after the mid-nineties as flatbed scanners became more affordable as each year passed
 haalanki 2000 or uske baad, karyaalayon or upabhoktaaon donon ko seva dene par lakshyit ol-in-van bahu-uddeshiy upkarnon main saamanytah ek saath sanyojit printer, scinar, copier or fax puure kaarydal ke liye ek hi upkaran main uplabdh hote hai or prayek prayokta ko fax, scan, copy or print kaaryaatmakataa pradaan karte hai
 Contact with the scanner is mandatory for an application such as Adobe Photoshop
 anek scanners uplabdh hai or unamem se anek scanners vibhinn protocols kaa prayog karte hai
 In order to simplify application programming, some applications programming interfaces were developed
 API scinar ke liye ek samaan interphes prastut karata he
 This means that for direct access to the scanner, the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner
 For example, Adobe Photoshop supports the TWAIN standard; That's why Photoshop can theoretically get a picture from any scanner that supports TWAIN
 vyavhaarik rup se, jab ek anuprayog kisi scinar se saath sampark karata he, to aksar us samay anek samasyaayein utpann hoti hai
 There may be an error in the API implementation made by the application or scanner manufacturer
 vishishtatah, API ko ek gatij rup se judanevaali librari ke rup main kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 Each scanner manufacturer provides software that translates API procedure calls into common commands passed to a hardware controller controller)
 API kaa utpaadak vaala bhaag aamtaur par divaais driver kehalaata he, lekin yah naam puri tarah achook nahin he: API karnel mod main kaary nahin karata or upkaran ko sidhe abhigam nahin karata
 Some scanner producers will provide more than one API
 adhikansh scanners TWAIN API kaa prayog karte hai
 The TWAIN API, which was originally used in low-level and home-based devices, is now widely used in large-scale scanning
 anya scinar api's nimnlikhit hai ISIS produced by Pixel Translations, which still uses the SCSI-II for performance reasons, is used by larger, departmental-level machines
 SANE scanners kaa abhigaman karne ke liye ek mukt / khule strot vaala API he
 Originally developed for Unix and Linux operating systems, it has been extended to API OS / 2, Mac OS x and Microsoft Windows
 TWAIN ke vipareet SANE prayokta interphes ko nahin sambhalata
 yah divaais driver se kisi vishesh samarthan ke bina hi batch scan or paardarshee network abhigam kii anumati detaa he
 Windows Image Acquisition is an API provided by Microsoft
 haalanki scanning upyogita ke atirikt koi bhi anya software kisi bhi scinar kii visheshta nahin he, lekin phir bhi anek scanners software ke saath ekatrit rup main milte hai
 Typically, in addition to scanning utility, some type of image-editing application and optical character recognition software are provided
 OCR software paathya saamagree kii chitratmak chhaviyon ko ek maanak paathya saamagree main roopantarit karata he, jise aam shabd-prakriya or paathya-saamagree sampadan software kaa prayog karke sampadit kiya ja saktaa he; haalanki achookta kabhi-kabhi hi sateek hoti he
 The result obtained after being scanned is a non-compressed RGB image, which can be transferred to a computer's memory
 kuch scanners antahsthapit formaware kaa prayog karke chitra ko sampeedit or saaf karte hai
 Once on the computer, the image can be processed by a rapid raster graphics program and stored on a storage device
 chitron ko saamanytah ek hard discs par bhandarit kiya jaataa he
 Images are usually stored in image formats such as uncompressed bitmaps, "non-lossy" compressed TIFF and PNG, and "lossy" compressed jpegs
 dastavejon ko TIFF yaa PDF praaroop main bhandarit karnaa sarvshereshth hota he; JPEG paathya-saamagree ke liye vishesh rup se anupyukt hota he
 If the text materials are clearly printed and in such an axis and size that they can be read by the optical character recognition software, the software allows a scanned image of the text to be edited in an editable format with tolerable accuracy Allows to convert to
 OCR kshamta ko scanning software ke saath ekikrut kiya ja saktaa he, yaa scan kii gai chitra filon par kisi pruthak OCR program kii sahaayta se prakriya kii ja sakati he
 Different requirements of scanning equipment are used for scanning or digitizing paper documents for storage as compared to reproduction of pictures only
 haalanki dastavejon ko saamaanya-uddeshiy scanners par scan kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah kaary etiz innovations, bove bel and howell, canan, epson, phujitsu, HP, kodaik or anya companiyon dwaara banaaye gayi samarpit dastavej scanners par adhik dakshatapurvak kiya ja saktaa he
 Speed and paper-handling is very important when scanning large volumes of documents, but the resolution of the scan will be much lower than a good reproduction of pictures
 dastavej scanners main dastavej fiders hote hai, jinka aakaar saamanytah coprs yaa sarv-uddeshiy scanners par paye jane vaale fiders se bada hota he
 The scanning process is completed at high speeds, possibly 20 to 150 pages per minute, often in gray-scale, although many scanners also support color
 anek scanners donon ore mudrit mul dastavejon ke donon bhaagon ko scan kar sakate hai 
 Sophisticated document scanners contain firmware or software that cleans the text as well as scans the output of the text and eradicates the blotting error
 This would be unacceptable for pictorial work because the stains in it cannot be reliably distinguished from the desired subtle details
 The files being created are compressed as well as created
 prayukt rezolyushan saamanytah 150 se 300 dpi ke bich hota he, haalanki hardware kuch ucch rezolyushan de paane main sakasham ho saktaa he; yah ucch-rezolushan vaale chitron ke liye aavashyak ucch bhandaran sthaan kii maang kiye bina paathya-saamagree ke aise chitra utpann karata he, jinhen optical kairactor recognishan dwaara acchhee tarah padhaa ja sake
 Document scans are often generated using OCR technology to create editable and discoverable files
 adhikansh scanners ISIS yaa TWAIN kaa prayog karke dastavejon ko TIFF praaroop main scan karte hai, taaki unhen ek dastavej prabandhan tantra main bheja ja sake, jo scan kiye gayi prishthon ke puralekhnan or punah prapti ko sanbhaalega
 kshatipurna JPEG sampeedan, jo ki chitron ke liye bahut daksh hota he, paathya-samagri ke liye avaanchit he kyonki tirchhe kiye gayi sidhe kinare nukile dikhaai dene lagate hai or ek halki prishthbhumi par gahari kaali paathya-saamagree kshatirahit sampeedan praroopon ke saath acchhee tarah sampeedit ho jaati he
 Although paper filling and scanning can be done automatically and quickly, its preparation and sequencing are necessary and these tasks require excessive human intervention
 taiyaari ke kaary main scan kiye jane vaale kaagazon kaa maanviya rup se nirikshan karnaa or is baat ko sunishchit karnaa shaamil he ki ve kram main hai, mude hue nahin he or unamem koi stepal yaa kuch bhi aisa nahin he, jo scinar ko fansaa de
 Additionally, for some industries, such as judicial and medical, documents may require Bates marking or any other mark that states the document identification number and the date / time of the document scan
 anukraman main filon kaa saath mukhya-shabd jodna shaamil hota he, taaki unhen saamagree ke dwaara punahprapt kiya ja sake
 Sometimes this process can be somewhat automated, but it is likely to require human labor
 barcode-pahchaan praudyogiki kaa prayog karnaa ek saamaanya paddati he: taiyaari ke dauraan, foulder naamon se yukt barcode shits dastavej filon, foulders or dastavej samoohon main pravisht kii jaati hai
 Using automated batch scanning, these documents are stored in appropriate folders and an index is created for integration into the document-management software system
 pustakon kii scanning dastavej scanning kaa ek visheshikrut prakaar he
 Since books are tied and sometimes delicate and rare, some technical problems may arise due to this, but some manufacturers have developed specialized machines to deal with this problem
 udhaaharan ke liye etiz DIY scinar najuk pustakon ko sanbhaalane ke liye V-aakaar kii sataha or V-aakaar kii paardarshee platten kaa prayog karata he
 Special robotic procedures are often used to automate the process of turning and scanning pages
 infrared safai ek takanic he, jiskaa prayog film se dhul or kharonch hataane ke liye kiya jaataa he or yah visheshta adhikansh aadhunik scanners main hoti he
 It performs film scanning with infrared light
 aisa karne se dhul or kharonch ko pahchaan paanaa sambhav ho jaataa he kyonki ve infrared prakaash ko roak dete hai; or iske baad unki sthiti, aakaar, banaavat or parivesh ke aadhaar par unhen swachaalit rup se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Scanner producers usually associate their own name with these technologies
 udhaaharan ke liye, epson, nickon, microtech or anya companiyaan digital ICE kaa prayog karti hai, jabaki canan apane swayan ke tantra, FARE kaa prayog karti he
 Some independent software developers are creating their own infrared cleaning devices
 flatsbed scanners apni stepper motor kii badalati gatiyon ke kaaran saamaanya sangeet dhunon ko sanshleshit kar paane main sakasham hote hai
 This feature can be applied to hardware detection: for example if HP Scanjet 5 is started by holding down the scan button and setting the SCSI ID to zero, it plays the tune of Odd to Joy
 flatsbed scanners ke vibhinn brandon or prakaaron ke liye manoranjan ke uddeshy se MIDI filein bajaane hetu vindos - or linaks - aadhaarit software uplabdh hai
 An artwork created by placing and scanning an object on a flatbed scanner is called scanning art
 yah baat bahes kaa vishay rahi he ki kya scinar kala digital photography kaa hi ek prakaar he
 Images made with the help of a scanner are different from pictures taken by a camera because the scanner has a very low field of view and has constant light on its surface

 See text Walnuts are very beautiful and fragrant trees
 isaki do jatiyaan pai jaati hai
 The 'wild walnuts' grow on their own, from 100 to 200 feet high
 iske fal kaa chhilka motaa hota he
 The 'agronomic nut' is 40 to 90 feet high and the skin of its fruit is thin
 ise 'kagaji akhrot' kehete hai
 From this, the guns are made
 akhrot kaa fal ek prakaar kaa sookhaa mewa he jo khaane ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The outer shell of the walnut is very hard and inside is shaped like a human brain
 akhrot kaa vanaspatik naam jaglance nigra he
 Half a handful of walnuts have 392 calories of energy, 9 grams of protein, 39 grams of fat and 8 grams of carbohydrates
 isamen vitamin i or bi6, calcium or mineral bhi paryaaptan maatra main hote he
 The botanical name of walnut is Jaglans nigra and walnut tree is a deciduous tree, in which two species are found
 Walnut fruit is round shaped, single seeded, a very hard shell fruit
 First these fruits Is green, but usually appears brown after fully ripening
 phir chhilka hataane se akhrot kaa khol kaa dikhaai detaa he, is kade khol ko hataane par bhure rang ke beej ek duusare main sanlagn hote hai jisamen antioxident hote hai
 The two most common major species of walnuts are grown for seed - Persian or English walnuts and black walnuts
 angreji akhrot faras main utpann hua, or kaale akhrot purvi uttar america main utpann hua
 Black walnut is much better in taste, but is not produced commercially, due to its hard work and poor hulling characteristics
 par iske kai sankaron ko vyavsaayik str par utpaadan ke liye viksit kiya gaya he, jo lagbhag angreji akhrot ke samaan hi hote hai
 Among other species, the black walnut of California, known as Jaglans californica, is found in Jaglans cinerai and Jaglans Arizona
 akhrot ke utpaadan main china sabase aage hands or iskaa utpaadan karne vaale anya deshon main pramukh hai - iran, america, turki or ukraine i purvi europea deshon main sabase zyada upaj hoti he jinamein pramukhya hai, slovenia or romania
 It produces in the Kashmir Valley in India, the United States is the world's largest exporter of walnuts and is followed by Turkey

 Havan, Yagas, prayers and sessions are envisaged under Shrutasutra
 inke dwaara aihik evam parlokik fal praapt hote hai
 The Shrutasutras perform the rituals of the same veditha karmas which are ritualized by the Ahitagni on the Shrouta Agni
 'shrout' shabd 'shruti' se vyutpann he
 These compositions are authored texts written by Divyadarshi karmic maharishis in the Sutra style on which the commentaries and commentaries and pamphletic methods and many essays by later Yagnik scholars are available
 is prakaar uplabdh sutara tathaa unke bhashya paryaapt rup se pramanit karte hai ki bhartiya sahitya main inkaa sthaan kitna pramukh rahaa he
 The importance of Shrout literature was also diverted to the Western mystics as a result of which the Western scholars also edited several long volumes
 pramukh shrautasutra granth hai: Shruti Karma is called 'shrout' and Smriti Karma is called 'smart'
 shrout evam smart karmon ke anushthan kii vidhi vedang kalp ke dwaara niyantrit he
 Vedang has six and Kalpa is prominent among them
 panineey shiksha use 'veda kaa haath' kahati he
 Kalpa consists of Shrutasutra, Grihyasutra, Dharmasutra and Shulbasutra
 inamen shrautasutra shrautakarm ke vidhaan, grihyasutra smartakarm ke vidhaan, dharmasutra samayik aachaar ke vidhaan tathaa shulbasutra karmanushthan ke nimitt karm main apekshit yajyashala, vedi, mandap or kunda ke nirmaan kii prakriya ko kehete hai

 Nityakarma such as Agnihotrahavan and Naimitikarma which is inspired by some incident or desire, performs Yajaman
 swayan yajmaan apni patni ke saath rutvijon kii sahaayta se yag kar sata he
 The sole goal of the Srautasutra, the rituals performed by the Yajaman, the duties of the Ritjis, the worshiping deity of each Karma, the appropriate substance of the Yagas, the sangopang description of the organs and appendages of the Karma and their sacrificial order, the atonement of the reversal of the law and the type of legislation
 is
 shrautakarmon main kuch karm prakruthikarm hote hai
 The description of the process of their Sangopag ritual has been given by the Shrutasutras
 jin karmon kii mukhya prakriya prakruthikarm kii ruparekha main aabaddh hokar keval falvishesh ke anusandhan ke anuroop vishisht devtaa yaa dravya or kaal aadi kaa hi keval vivechan he ve vikruthikarm hai, kaaran shrautasutra ke anusaar 'prakruti bhanti vikruthikarm karo' yah aadesh diya gaya he

 shrautakarm ke anushthan main chaaron vedon kaa sahyog prakalpit he
 The Rigveda presides over the leadership of the Rigveda, the Yajurveda through the Adhvaryukrama, the Samaveda through the Upadhyaya and the Atharva Veda sustains the work of Brahma
 atev shrautasutra vedachatushti se sambandh rakhte hai
 The Vedas that the Yajaman is a follower of are the prominence of that Veda or branch of that Veda
 isi kaaran yagyeey kalp main prayek vedashakhanusaar prabhed ho gaye hai jinpar deshaachaar, kulachaar aadi sweey visheshtaon kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Due to this, there is some difference in the process of Karmanasuthan due to branch discrimination and the Yajman of each branch is controlled by the discipline of Kalpa related to his own Veda
 is parampara ke kaaran shrautasutra bhi vedachatushti kii prabhinn shakha ke anusaar pruthak pruthak rachit hai

 Jaisi was a Sufi saint and in this composition he has given a message of love cultivation, elaborating the love story of hero Ratansen and heroine Padmini
 ratansen aitihaasik vyakti he, vah chittod kaa raja he, padmavati uski vah rani he jiske saundarya kii prashansa sunakar tatkaaleen sultan allaudin use praapt karne ke liye chittod par akraman karata he or yadhyapi yuddh main vijay praapt karata he tathaapi padmavati ke jal marane ke kaaran use nahin praapt kar paata he
 Prior to this semi-historical tale, the arrangement of Padmavati has been added by Ratansen, the basis of which is a folklore of Hiraman Sugaye prevalent in Awadhi region
 katha sankshep main is prakaar he : Ratansingh Rajput was already married and his married queen was named Nagmati
 ratansen ke virah main usne baarah maheene ksht jhel kar kisi prakaar ek pakshi ke dwaara apni virahagaatha ratansingh rajput ke paas bhijwai or is virahagaatha se dravit hokar ratansingh padamavati ko lekar chittod laut aayaa
 Here, in his assembly was a tantric named Raghav, who was expelled by Ratan Singh due to untruthful speech and served the then Sultan Alauddin and praised Padmavati's beauty with him
 allaudin padamavati ke adbhut saundarya kaa varnan sunakar usko praapt karne ke liye lalayit ho uthaa or usne isi uddeshy se chittod par akraman kar diya
 He laid siege to Chittor for a long time, but did not see any success, so he fraudulently resorted to imprisonment of Ratan Singh Rajput
 usne uske paas sandhi kaa sandesh bheja, jise ratan singh rajput ne sweekaar kar allaudin ko vidaa karne ke liye garh ke baahar niklaa, allaudin ne use bandi kar dilli kii ore prasthaan kar diya
 Padmavati was extremely sad in Chittor and she went to her feudal fair and Badal's house to free her husband
 gora badal ne ratansih rajput ko mukt karaane kaa bidaa liya
 He decorated sixteen squads within which Rajput soldiers were placed and proceeded towards Delhi
 vahaan pahunchakar unhone yah kahalaaya ki padmavati apni cheriyon ke saath sultan kii seva main ai he or antim baar apane pati ratansen se milane ke liy ajna chaahati he
 The Sultan gave the order
 doliyon main baithe hue rajputon ne ratansingh rajput ko bediyon se mukt kiya or ve use lekar nikal bhaage
 The Sultani army pursued him, but Ratan Singh Rajput safely reached Chittor
 jis samay vah dilli main bandi tha, kumbhalaner ke raja devpal ne padamavati ke paas ek doot bhejkar usase premprastaav kiya tha
 On reaching Ratan Singh Rajput, when Padmavati narrated this incident to him, he left Chittor and reached Kumbhalner
 vahaan usne devpal ko dwandv yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 In that war, he was badly hurt by Devpal's cell and though he returned to Chittor after killing him, he died after reaching home from Devpal's cell wound
 padamavati or naagmati ne uske shav ke saath chitarohan kiya
 Alauddin also reached Chittor, chasing Ratan Singh Rajput, but he did not get Padmavati and found the ashes of his funeral pyre
 is katha main jaaysi ne itihaas or kalpana, loukik or alokik kaa aisa sundar sammishran kiya he ki hindi sahitya main duusari katha in gunon main "padmavat" kii oonchaai tak nahin pahunch saki he
 It has often been a dispute that in this the poet has tried to play any metaphor
 rachana ke kuch sanskarnon main ek chand bhi aata he, jisamen sampurna katha ko ek aadhyatmik roopak bataaya gaya he or kaha gaya he ki chittod maanav kaa sharir he, raja uskaa man he, sinhal uskaa hriday he, padmini uski buddhi he, sugga uskaa guru he, naagmati uskaa loukik jivan he, raghav shaitan he or allaudin maaya he; is prakaar katha kaa arth samajhnaa chahie
 But this verse is found only in a few copies of the composition and those copies are also similar which comes down very much in the tradition of composition
 iske atirikt yah kunjee rachana bhar main har jagah kaam bhi nahin detii he : udaahranarth guru-chela-sambandh sugge or ratansen main hi nahin he, vah rachana ke bhinn bhinn prasangon main ratansen-padamavati, padamavati-ratansen or ratansen tathaa uske saath ke un kumaron ke bich bhi kaha gaya he jo uske saath sinhal jate hai
 In fact not only this, the difficulty is not solved even by a key of this kind, and the reason for this is that the subsistence of a metaphor has not been diligently tried in the whole composition
 jaaysi kaa abhisht keval prem kaa nirupan karnaa gyaat hota he
 They present two images of love in a physical form: one that comes as a spiritual instrument, for which the emanation of life can also be done laughing; The love of Ratansen and Padmavati is similar to this: Ratansen enters Sinhalgarh to find Padmavati and proceeds laughingly to climb the shulhi; Padmavati laughs with Ratansen's corpse and laughs and even rejects the temptation to become the beloved of a great Sultan like Alauddin
 doosraa prem vah he jo allaudin padamavati se karata he
 He wants to get the second married wife by his physical force
 kintu jaaysi pratham prakaar ke prem kii vijay or duusare prakaar ke prem kii paraajay dikhaate hai
 The second is hey and only lust in his vision; Love is the first jaaysi is prem ko divya kehete hai

 udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he ‚Äì dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year

 Somebody is of the opinion that Sambapurana, Bhaskar, Aditya, Bhanava and Saurapuran are the same texts, only the names are different, but this statement is wrong, because Devi Bhagwat has counted the Solar as separate from Adityapuran and Sutrasamhita has different Sauraburan from Sambapuran

 Therefore, like other Puranas, it is called Saurapuran

 Even after this completion, the "sargashtha Pratsargash", etc

 The beginning of this Purana is as follows - Suryaputra Manu went to the yagna of the king who performed the yajna in the Kamika forest, with the sages thinking about the element but unable to make a decision, going by the Akashwani and going to the place called Dvadashaditya of the sun, meditated for sun worship Started doing hajaar varshon ke anantar surya ne darshan die or saurapurana sunaaya

 All living organisms on Earth give up carbon dioxide in their respiration
 jabaki hare ped-paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya karte samay is gas ko grahan karke carbohydrate kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Thus, carbon dioxide is a major component of the carbon cycle

 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate

 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly, carbon dioxide can also be taken in various uses

 magahi sahitya se taatpary us likhit sahitya se he jo paali magadhi, praakrit magadhi, apbhransh magadhi athwa aadhunik magahi bhashaa main likhi gayi he
 'sa Magadhi Moolbhasha' suggests that Magadhi was the original language which was practiced by the common people in their day-to-day life at the time of Ajivak Tirthankar Makkhali Gosal, Jin Mahavira and Gautama Buddha
 mauryaal main yah raaj-kaaj kii bhashaa bani kyonki ashok ke shilalekhon par utkeern bhashaa yahi he
 All the ancient texts, literature and teachings of Jains, Buddhists and Siddhas are written in Magahi itself
 bhashavid maanate hai ki magadhi se hi sabhi arya bhashaaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The origin of the word Magahi is assumed to be from 'magadhi' - aadi vyakarnacharya kacchan ne magahi kii pracheenta ke sambandh main kaha he - In 'chulvansh', Magadhi has been called the native language of all languages - maudgalyayan, buddhaghosh or natyacharya bharatmuni ne bhi magahi ko aamajan kii lokapriy bhashaa ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Magahi has been used as a language of common people in Sanskrit plays
 pashchimi bhashavid or bhartiya bhashaaon ke pratham surveykshak jorge abraham grearsan ne aadhunik magahi ke do rupon ko sweekaar kiya he - Eastern Magahi is spoken as far as Chatra in the state of Jharkhand, southeast part of Hazaribagh, Manbhum and southeast part of Ranchi, and south of Mayurbhanj and Bamra in Odisha
 pashchim bengal ke malda jile kaa pashchimi bhaag bhi purvi magahi kaa kshetra he
 Pure Magahi is spoken in its region
 yah pashchimi kshetra main patna, vrahat gaya, chatra,hazaribagh, munger, bhagalpur or begusarai jile main hi nahin apitu purv kshetra main ranchi ke dakshin bhaag main, singhbhum ke uttari kshetra main tathaa sarayakela evam kharasaavaan ke kuch kshetron main magahi boli jaati he
 Linguists have accepted a form of mixed Magahi along with Eastern Magahi and Pure Magahi
 iske anusaar mishrit magahi kaa rup vahaan dikhaai padataa he jahaan adarsh magahi apni seemaa par anya sahodar bhashaaon, jaise maithili or bhojpuri se milakar simavarti boliyon ke rup main vyakt hoti he
 Many forms of Magahi language appear in the modern period
 chunki magahi bhashaa kaa kshetra vistaar bahut hi vyapak he, atah sthaan bhed ke kaaran iske rup main bhi kai bhed ho gaye hai
 The regional differences of Magahi language are indicated by Krishnadeva Prasad in this way - bhashashasthri bholanath tiwari kii manyata he ki magahi kaa parinishthit rup puraane gaya jile main bolaa jaataa he
 Grierson has also considered Magahi of Gaya district as pure Magahi
 grearsan ke bhashaa-surveykshan ke anusaar ‚Äòmagahi‚Äô bhashiyon kii sankhya lagbhag 6,504,817 thi
 But according to the 2001 census, the number of Magahi-speaking people is now about 12 million
 ise prayog main lene tathaa shuddh magahi bolne vaali aabaadi mukhya rup se bihar rajya ke patna, gaya, aurangabad, rajgir, navada, nalanda, jahanabad or araval ke ilaakon main nivas karti he
 Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan has presented the developmental history of Magahi language as follows - rahul ji ke alaava bhashaa-sahitya ke anya kai vidwaanon ne magahi kaa kaal vibhaajan kiya he
 Some literary historians have also envisaged the Magahi literature period like the Baran period, Dr
 Srikant Shastri period, following the time division of Hindi literature of Pt
 Ramachandra Shukla
 jo na keval brahmanvaadi va manuaadi saahitiyik sankalpana he balki vyaktigat mahimamandan or avaigyanik bhi he
 Nevertheless, the period of Magahi literature can be divided as follows by consolidating the divisions till date - aadi paali magahi kaal main mukhyatah ashok ke purv, samakaleen or parvarti samay kaa sahitya he
 Magahi literature of the pre and late period of Ashoka is unavailable, but Maghite literature of the Ashoka period is found in inscriptions, cavities and Mauryan texts
 praakrit magahi kaal kaa sahitya jain or buddha sahitya he
 All Jain Agam and Buddha vows are stored in Prakrit Magahi language itself
 apbhransh magahi kaal kaa samay rahul sankrutyaayan ke anusaar i0 san 550 se 1200 i
 tak kaa he
 Unfortunately Magahi literature of this period is unavailable
 pracheen magahi kaal kaa sahitya atyant samrudh he jiskaa aarambh aathvin shatabdi ke siddh kaviyon kii rachanaaon se hota he
 Among them, Siddha poet Sirhapa is the first whose compositions are compiled and published in 'doha Kosh'
 iskaa sampaadan rahul sankrutyaayan ne kiya he
 In the medieval Magahi period, the tradition of Siddha literature was retained by many saint poets of the medieval period and did excellent works in the Magahi language
 baba karamdas, baba sohangadas, baba hemnath das aadi inamen sarvaadhik ullekhneey sant kavi hai jinaki rachanaaen hamen magahi main praapt hoti he
 The modern Magahi period begins in colonial times
 is kaal main lokbhasha or loksahitya sambandhi adhyayan ke parinamswarup magahi ke pracheen paramparaagat lokgeeton, lokkathaon, lokanatyon, muhaavaron, kahawaton tathaa paheliyon kaa sangrah kaary hua
 Along with the modern and contemporary socio-environment and life-related literature in Magahi language, ie poetry, story, drama, novel, Ekanki, fine essay, etc
