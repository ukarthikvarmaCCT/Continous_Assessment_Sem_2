 Leprosy is primarily a granuloma-related disease of the mucous and external nerves of the upper respiratory tract; Skin lesions are its primary external sign
 yadi ise anupachaarit chhod diya jaae, to kushtarog bad saktaa he, jisase twachaa, nason, haath-pairon or ankhon main sthaayee kshati ho sakati he
 Unlike folklore, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall apart, although they can become numb and / or sick due to the disease

 There was a time when leprosy was thought to be highly contagious and sexually transmitted and treated by mercury — all of which the notion applied to syphilis, first described in 1530
 ab aisa mana jaataa he ki kushtarog ke shuruaati maamalon se anek sambhawatah syphilis ke maamle rahe honge
 ab yah gyaat ho chukaa he ki kushtarog na to yon-sampark ke dwaara sancharit hota he or na hi upachaar ke baad yah atyadhik sankramak he kyonki lagbhag 95% log prakritik rup se pratirakshit hote hai or isse peedit log bhi upachaar ke maatr 2 saptaah baad hi sankramak nahin rah jate
 The age-old social stigma associated with advanced forms of leprosy, in other words the stigma of leprosy, is still present in many areas and still remains a major obstacle towards self-information and early treatment

 Apart from humans, the only organism that has been reported to have leprosy is a nine-striped worm
 chuuhe ke pairon ke panjon main pravisht karke is jeevanu ko prayogshaala main bhi viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 There is evidence that leprosy does not develop in all people infected with M
 leprae and it has long been believed that genetic factors also have a role in it because leprosy has been seen in some specific families and is Success in understanding why lepromatous leprosy develops in some people, while lepromatous leprosy in others Sector are growing
 aisa anumaan he ki anuvaanshik karkon ke kaaran keval 5% logon main hi kushtarog hone kaa khatra hota he
 Mostly this is because the body is naturally immune to this bacterium, and those who become infected with it are experiencing an acute allergic reaction to the disease
 haalanki is chikitsiya vyakhya ke nirdhaaran main anuvaanshik karkon kii bhoomika puri tarah spasht nahin he
 Additionally, malnutrition and prolonged contact with an infected person may also play a role in the development of this manifest disease
 yah vishwaas sabase vyapak taur par prachlit he ki yah beemaari sankramit vyakti or swasth vyakti ke bich sampark ke dwaara sancharit hoti he
 The proximity of contact is usually dependent on the amount of infection, which is automatically dependent on the occurrence of the disease

 In a recent study, Job and others reported receiving substantial amounts of M
 leprae in the upper keratin layer of the skin of lepromatous leprosy patients, suggesting that the removal of this bacterium may be accompanied by sebaceous secretions
 anunasik shleshm, vishesh rup se vran-yukt shleshm, kaa mahatv shapher dwaara 1898 main hi pahchaan liya gaya tha
 The amount of bacilli from nasal mucosal lesions in lepromatous leprosy was demonstrated extensively by Shepard and numbered between 10,000 and 10,000,000

 The path of entry of M
 leprae into the human body is also not known with certainty: the skin and upper respiratory tract are the most likely routes
 puraane anusandhan jahaan twachaa maarg kaa adhyayan kar rahe the, vahiin haalia anusandhan dwaara shwasan tantra kaa samarthan badhata ja rahaa he
 Rees and mcdougal succeeded in the experimental transmission of leprosy through M

 lepri ko samayik anuprayog ke dwaara anunasik chhidr se pravisht kiya gaya tha
 In short, penetration through the respiratory tract is the most likely route, although other routes, especially broken skin, cannot be ignored
 The CDC has expressed the following assumption about the transmission of the disease: "although the route of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most researchers believe that M
 leprae usually spreads from person to person via respiratory drops

 " In leprosy, it is difficult to define reference points for both the incubation period and the time of infection and the measurement of the onset of disease; The first one due to adequate immunological devices and the second due to the slow onset of the disease
 Despite this, various researchers have attempted to measure the incubation time for leprosy
 nunatam ushmaayan kaal kuch saptahon jitna sankshipt hone kii jaankaree mili he or yah navjaat shishuon main kushtarog kii aksar hone vaali ghatnaon par aadhaarit he
 The maximum incubation period has been reported to be 30 years, or longer, as seen in those old soldiers of the war, who are known to have been exposed to local areas of infection for a short time
 Were, but otherwise they were living in non-local areas

 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

 sharir main ye panchtatv ras, rakt, maans, vasa, asthi majja tathaa veery naamak vastuon ke rup main hote hai
 The function of food is to nourish these metals, maintain their balance and to continue digestion
 jo bhojan khaaya jaataa he, vah pehle ek ras main parivartit hota he, tatpashchaat rakt, maance tathaa anya dhaatuon main
 a mild reaction occurs during the digestion process, which produces a foamy substance called phlegm
 kuch samay pashchaat jab bhojan adhpachaa hota he, tab ek khatti pratikriya shuru ho jaati he
 By this reaction, a fluid - bile - is formed from the food in the intestines

 praarambhik garbhasrav, jo alemapi ke chathe saptaah se pehle hota he, use chikitsakeey bhashaa main garbhavastha ke praarambhik daur main nuksaan yaa rasinic garbhavastha kaha jaataa he
 lmps that occur after the sixth week of the last menstrual LMP are medically termed clinical spontaneous abortions
 chikitsa sandarbhon main, "garbhpaat" shabd kaa arth aisi kisi bhi prakriya, jisase garbhpaat yaa use hataanaa yaa uske nishkasana se he jisase garbhavastha kaa ant ho jaataa he, chaahe vah swaabhaavik dhang se hua ho yaa jaanboojh kar kiya gaya ho

 In recent years there has been discussion in the medical community in favor of avoiding the term and using the ambiguous term "miscarriage"
 garbhavastha ke 37 saptaah se pehle prasav pidaa ke parinamswarup hue jivit bachche ko "samay purv prasav" kehete hai, bhale hi janm ke kuch der baad hi shishu kii mrityu ho jaay

 garbhavastha ke dauraan jo mahilaayein khun bahane par naidanik upachaar karaati hai unamem se aadhe kaa garbhasrav ho jaayegaa
 raktasrav ke alaava duusare lakshan sankhyikeey taur par garbhasrav ke lakshan nahin hai
 Miscarriage can also be detected during an ultrasound examination or through testing for human chorionic gonadotropin hcg

 Several medical options exist for the management of intractable pregnancy, which are not naturally expelled
 haalanki iske baad mahila shaareerik rup se jaldi thik ho jaati he lekin aamtaur par abhibhavakon ko manovaigyanik taur par isse ubarne main kaaphi lanbaa samay lag saktaa he

 The fetus may have stayed in the womb for a short time, but this does not reduce their pain
 garbhavastha kaa pataa lagane ke baad se abhibhavak bhrun yaa garbhasth shishu ke saath judana shuru kar dete hai
 When the pregnancy process is not complete, then all dreams, fantasies and future plans are badly affected
 is nuksaan ke baad dusron kaa bhaavnaatmak samarthan bahut mahatvapurn hota he
 For those who have not experienced miscarriage, it is very difficult for them to understand what a person feels and what goes on in such times and it is very difficult to express sympathy
 yah abhibhavak ke ubarne kii avastavik ummiido ko janm de saktaa he
 He rarely mentions pregnancy and miscarriage in any conversation because the issue is too painful
 isaki vajah se mahila khud ko vishesh rup se kataa hua mahasoos kar sakati he
 Inappropriate or insensitive responses by physicians can further aggravate their grief and trauma, leading to the process of using a standard code in most cases
 aise abhibhavakon ke liye jinhone garbhasrav kaa anubhav kiya ho, unke liye garbhvatee mahilaon or navjaat bacchon se milanaa aksar dardanaak sabit hota he
 Sometimes it causes difficulties in meeting with friends, acquaintances and family

 Genetic problems are mostly attributed to older parents, which may be the major reason for higher miscarriage rates in older women
 garbhasrav jaldi hone kaa ek anya kaaran projesteron kii kami ho saktaa he
 Progesterone supplementation may be given to women in the first trimester of pregnancy when progesterone levels are low in their second cycle
 haalanki, kisi adhyayan se yah pataa nahin chalaa he ki pehali timahi main projesteron purakon se garbhasrav kaa jokhim kam ho jaataa he, yahaan tak ki lutiyal charan kii samasyaon kii pahchaan kar garbhasrav main unke yogadan par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 15% of miscarriages in the second trimester may be due to uterine pathology, uterine development, or cervical problems
 in vajahon se bhi samay se pahane janma baccha ho saktaa he
 One study found that 19% of the losses were due to problems with the umbilical cord in the second quarter
 Problems related to the placenta may lead to a greater number of miscarriages later
 ek se adhik bhrun se judi samasyaon kii vajah se baad main garbhasrav kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Uncontrolled diabetes greatly increases the risk of miscarriage
 jin mahilaon kaa madhumeh niyantrit he unhen garbhasrav hone kaa adhik khatra nahin hota he
 Antenatal monitoring will be important for the symptoms of this disease because there will be a risk of developing diabetes in pregnancy
 garbhasrav ke liye policystic overi syndrome jokhim kaa ek bahut bada kaarak he, pisio ke saath garbhadhaaran karne vaali 30-50% mahilaon main pehali timahi main garbhasrav ho jaataa he

 Some diseases increase the risk of miscarriage
 tambaakoo pine waalon main garbhasrav kaa khatra adhik hota he
 One reason for increasing number of miscarriages can also be related to father's smoking
 pati par kiye gayi adhyayan ne paaya ki har din 20 se kam cigarette pine vaale patiyon main 4% kaa khatra he jabaki har din 20 se zyada cigarette pine vaale patiyon main 81% jokhim bad jaataa he

 kai karkon ko garbhasrav kii ucch dar ke saath sambhddha kiya gaya he, lekin yah bahes kaa vishay he ki kya ve garbhasrav ke kaaran hai
 No simple causal mechanism is known, studies showing relationships may be retrospective or both rather than probabilities
 matlee or ulti garbhavastha ke garbhasrav ke jokhim ke saath kam jude rahe hai
 Several mechanisms have been proposed for this relationship, but none are widely agreed upon
 kyonki envipi garbhavastha ke dauraan ek mahila ke bhojan ke seven kii maatr or anya gatividhiyon ko badal saktaa he, garbhasrav ke sambhavit kaarnon kii jaanch ke samay yah ek bhram utpann karne vaala kaarak ho saktaa he
 Exercise is one such aspect
