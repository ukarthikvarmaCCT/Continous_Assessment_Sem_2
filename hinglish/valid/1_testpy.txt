81 square kilometers, located near the historic district of Panna in Madhya Pradesh, Ajaygarh is famous for its nearly 250-year-old fort, natural splendor and wildlife wealth
 yah nagar panchayat he
 Ajaygarh was the capital of the princely state of Ajaygarh during the British Raj

 According to Yadav it is written - "kalanjar Durg received the most fame during the rule of Chandelas
 kalanjar kaa chandel itihaas main mahatv is kathan se satyapit hota he ki chandelon kaa sampoorn itihaas kalanjar evam ajaigarh durg ke chaaron ore hi kendrit rahaa
 The fort of Ajaygarh is 80 km from Khajuraho
 yah durg chandel shashan ke ardhakaal main bahut mahatvapurn tha
 This fort is situated on the top of Vindhya hills
 kile main do pravesh dwaar hai
 The fort has a door in the north and a kind of gateway in the southeast
 daravaajon tak pahunchane ke liye 45 minute kii khadi chattani chadhaai chadhani padati he
 In the center of the fort is a lake called Ajay Palka Talav
 jhil ke ant main jain mandiron ke avshesh bikhare pade hai
 Some ancient temples established on the banks of the lake can also be seen

 The Archaeological Department of India has taken care of this fort some time back
 vindhyachal parvat shrankhla ke samtal parvat par sthit ajaigarh kaa kila aaj bhi logon ke liye rahasyamay va aakarshan kaa centre bindu bana hua he
 This heritage 47 km from Naraini is located to the south-west of Kalinjar

 The vision of architecture, architecture and sculpture is compared to the art craft of Khajurahas
 is kaaran kile ko madar of khajurahon bhi kaha jaataa he
 People believe that the name of Ajaygarh Fort is not found in any inscription

 According to the records obtained from the fort, the name of Ajaygarh is also called Nandipur
 kalinser kila or ajaigarh kila ke madhya kii duuri maatr 25 kilometre he
 The name of Kalinjar is said to be amazing from Shiva
 ajaigarh shiv ke vaahan nandi kaa sthaan bhi kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, it was named Nandipur
 ajaigarh kila pravesh karte hi do dwaar milte hai jo ek darwaja uttar kii ore doosraa darwaja taroni gaanv ko jaataa he jo parvat kii talahati main sthit he
 The first door to the fort comes on climbing the hill

 After years of study, when Albert Einstein announced this theory in 1916, the world of science was stirred up and the universe's vision announced in 1687 by Isaac Newton was permanently reversed for two and a half years
 bhautik shaastra par iskaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa ki log aadhunik bhautikee ko shastreey bhautikee se alag vishay bataane lage or albert oinstin ko aadhunik bhautikee kaa pita mana jane laga
 Dik is a Sanskrit word meaning place around
 ise angreji main "spes" kehete hai
 Humans have the ability to steam the three aspects of a problem - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 aam jivan main manushya dik main koi badlaav nahin dekhte
 Newton's physics used to say that if two objects in space are one kilometer away from each other and neither of them move, they will remain one kilometer away from each other
 hamaara rose kaa saadhaaran jivan bhi hamen yahi dikhalaataa he
 But Einstein said that it is not so
 dik khich or sikud saktaa he
 It is also possible that the two objects which are one kilometer away from each other, should not move themselves, but due to some circumstances the problem may spread to a quarter and a quarter or a quarter to a quarter
 newton kii shastreey bhautikee main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmand main har jagah samay kii raftaar ek hi he
 If you are sitting in one place and a friend decides to travel for ten years at half the speed of light, then after that journey, you will have passed ten years and your friend too
 lekin inastin ne is par bhi kaha ki yah vishwaas galat he
 When something moves at a speed, time becomes slower for it and the faster it moves, the slower it becomes
 aapkaa mitra agar apane hisaab se das varsh tak roshni se aadhi gati par yatra kar ke laut aae, to uske to das saal guzarenge lekin aapke saadhe gyaarah saal guzar chuke honge
 Einstein showed in the theory of relativity that in fact there is a four-dimensional dikala in the universe, consisting of three periods of time and one in which all things and energies are located
 yah dik-kaal sthai nahin he- na dik bina kisi badlaav ke hota he or na yah zaruri he ki samay kaa bahaav har vastu ke liye ek jaisaa ho
 It can be twisted, pulled, and shrunk by affecting the time period, and the same happens in the universe
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se hi samay yatra kii avadharana nirmit hui he
 Changes in times of time produce every object and every speed, but large objects and speeds near light produce more changes
 manushyon kaa aakaar itnaa chota or uski raftaar itani dhimi he ki unhen saapekshata siddhant ke asar apane jivan main nazar hi nahin aate, lekin jab vah brahmand main or chizon kaa gaur se adhyayan karte hai to saapekshata ke chinh kai jagahon par pate hai
 When the velocity of the object becomes even 5% of the velocity of light, then we start seeing signs of the theory of relativity
 newton kaa maananaa tha ki har vastu main apni ore khinchne kii ek shakti hoti he jise usne gurutvkarshan kaa naam diya
 In a big thing like Earth, this gravity is very high, due to which we stick to the Earth and do not fly away from space into space
 lekin yah newton nahin bataa paye ki gurutvkarshan bal vastav main kis prakaar kaary karata he or kyon kaary karata he
 Einstein said that according to the theory of relativity, the idea that material things attract each other is an illusion, which has arisen due to wrong mechanical assumptions about nature
 unhone kaha ki prithvi badi he or uski vajah se uske ird-gird kaa dik-kaal mud gaya he or apane upar tah ho gaya he
 We live in this difficult time and because of this twist, we are pushed closer to the earth
 isaki tulana ek chadar se kii ja sakati he jiske chaar cono ko chaar logon ne khinch ke pakadaa ho
 Now if a heavy ball is placed in the middle of this sheet, then the sheet will sit in the middle, that is, its yarn will be bent in the middle
 ab agar ek halaki gend ham chadar ke kone par rakhe to vah ludak kar bade gole kii taraf jaaegi
 Einstein said that a clumsy man could see that the small ball was pulled by the big ball, so the ball went to him
 lekin asli vajah thi ki gend zamin kii taraf janaa chaahati thi or gole ne chadar main kuch aisi mudan paidaa kii ki gend uske paas chali gai
 Similarly, he said that it is a myth that gravity is caused by some attraction
 gurutvkarshan kii asli vajah he ki har vastu jo antariksh main chal rahi hoti he, vah dik ke aisi mudan ke prabhaav main aakar kisi badi chiz kii ore chalane lagati he
 In fact, gravity is only a part of inertia, the movements of stars and planets arise from their characteristic inertia and their path depends on the circular elements of time and time
 jis prakaar chumbak ke chaaron ore chumbakeey kshetra hota he usee prakaar khagoleey vastu apane chaaron ore ke akaash main ek kshetra bikherti he
 Just as the activity of an iron piece in a magnetic field is guided by the design of the field, similarly the path of an object in a gravitational field is determined by the geometric state of that field
 oinstin kaa gurutvkarshan sambandhi niyam dikkaal satati ke kshetreey tatwon kii jaankaree detaa he
 Primarily a part of this rule expresses the relationship of the structure of the field around the gravitational object
 inastin ke is sansani failaa dene vaale siddhant kaa ek bahut bada pramaan roshni par gurutvkarshan kaa asar dekhne se aayaa
 Newton's theory in physics was that two objects pull each other according to the mass of the two
 lekin prakaash kaa to dravyaman hota hi nahin, yani shunya hota he
 So, according to Newton, there is no question of something that does not have any mass or weight, but it can be pulled from the gravity of another object, no matter how big the other object is
 prakaash hameshaa ek sidhi lakeer main chalata hi rahata he
 But if Einstein is right and due to some big thing, the problem should be turned, then the light should also be turned with difficulty
 yani brahmand main sthit badi vastuon ko lens kaa kaam karnaa chahie- jis tarah chashme, doorabeen yaa sookshmbin kaa lens prakaash modta he usee tarah taron or grahon ko bhi modana chahie
 In 1924, a Russian physicist named Ostra Kholson predicted Einstein's theory of relativity, predicting that such gravitational lenses would be there in the universe
 pachpan saal baad, 1979 main pehali dafaa yah chiz dekhi gai jab twin kwasar naam kii vastu kii ek ke bajaae do-do chhaviyaan dekhi gai
 After that such images of far-flung objects have been seen in which some very large object is placed between those objects and the earth, which acts as lenses on the rays of light coming from the first object and either torsion its image
 Or show more than one image of him in the sky

 Formation of igneous rock Melted under the surface of hot and liquid rocky material, ie magma, as a lava flow above the surface or before it can rise out in order to rise up This is due to the solidification of substances
 atah aagney chattaane pighale hue chattani padaarth ke thande hokar jam jane se banati hai
 It can also be ruddy and without particles or rye
 ye chattaane prithvi par paayi jane vaali anya do pramukh chattaanon, avsaadee or roopantarit ke saath milakar prithvi par paayi jane vaali chattaanon ke teen pramukh prakaar banaati hai
 They are also called 'primary rocks' because they were first formed in the origin of the earth's surface
 aisa isliye bhi kaha jaataa he ki yahi ve pehali chattaane hai jo pighale hue chattani padaarth se banati hanjabaki avsaadee yaa roopantarit chattaane in aagney chattaanon ke tuutane yaa taap or daab ke prabhaav aakaar main badalane se se banati hai

 bahirbhedi aagney chattaane ve chattaane hai jo megma ke prithvi ki sataha ke upar nikal kar lava ke rup main aakar thande hokar jamane se banati hai
 Since this type of eruption is called volcanic eruption, such rocks are also called volcanic rocks
 aagney chattaane teen tarah kii hoti he Volcanic Rocks: ava-volcanic Rocks: Intertidal Rocks: comatite, pikriti besaltkimberlite, lamproitperidotite Basaltdabes Gabro andesicdorite Desitegranoidite ryoliteeplite—pegmtitagrenite Gurujada Apparao was a famous national poet of modern Telugu language

 It is the first member of the alkane class and is the most common hydrocarbon
 jab yah sataha or vaataavaran pahunchataa he, yah vayumandaleey methane ke rup main janaa jaataa he prithvi ke vayumandal main methane kaa ghanatv 1750 ke baad se lagbhag 150% kii vruddhi hui he or yah ek green house gas he

 a business is a legally recognized institution created with the goal of providing a product or service to consumers
 vyavsaay ko 'company', 'interprise' yaa 'form' bhi kehete hai
 Business has a prominent place in the capitalist economies which are mostly in private hands and work with the aim of making profit and at the same time increase the business itself
 kintu sahakaari sansthaayen tathaa sarkaar dwaara chalaayi jaani vaali sansthaaen praaia: laabh ke bajaay anya uddeshyon kii purti ke liye banaayi gayi hoti hai
 We live in a commercial environment
 yah samaaj kaa ek anivaary ang he
 It fulfills our needs by providing a wide variety of goods and services through a wide network of business functions
 anya shabd - vyapaar, vyavsaay-pratishthan, form, dhandha, vyavsaay, karbar, kaarobaar, kaam-kaaj, kaam-dhandha, udhyam When we pay attention to our surroundings, we see that most people are engaged in some work
 adhyaaapak vidyalayon main padhaate hai, kisaan kheton main kaam karte hai, majdoor kaarkaanon main kaam karte hai, chaalak gaadiyaan chalaate hai, dukandaar saamaan bechate hai, chikitsak rogiyon ko dekhte hai aadi
 In this way every man is busy with some work all day, or sometimes overnight
 lekin ab prashn yah uthta he ki ham sab is tarah kisi na kisi kaam main apane aapako itnaa vyast kyon rakhte hai? iskaa sirf ek hi uttar he - 'apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye'
 By working in this way, we either fulfill our various responsibilities or earn money, so that we can buy the goods and services we need
 manushya dwaara kii jane vaali vibhinn kriyaayein maanviya kriyaayein kehalaati hai
 We can divide all these actions into two categories - jo kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati hai, unhen aarthik kriyaayein kehete hai
 For example, the farmer grows the crop by plowing the field and earns money by selling it, the factory or office worker receives salary or wages in exchange for his work, the merchant earns profit from the sale and purchase of goods
 ye sabhi kriyaayein aarthik hai
 Activities that are performed for the purpose of achieving satisfaction, rather than earning money, are called uneconomical actions
 is tarah kii kriyaayein, saamaajik uttardayitvon kii purti, manoranjan yaa swasthya laabh ke liye kii jaati hai
 People visit places of worship, donate to a flood or earthquake relief fund, engage themselves in sports for health benefits, do gardening, listen to radio, watch television or perform other activities
 ye kuch udhaaharan anaarthik kriyaaon ke hai
 Economic activities are usually carried out for the purpose of earning money
 sadhrantaya log is tarah kii kriyaaon main niyamit rup main sanlagn hote hai, jise aarthik kriya kaha jaataa he
 Business can be defined as: vyavsaay kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai : The cultural heritage of India is very rich
 lekin shaayad yah bahut kam log jaanate honge ki pracheen kaal main bharat, arthvyavastha tathaa vyavsaay ke str par bahut hi viksit desh tha
 This is evident from historical evidence, evidence from excavations, literature and written documents
 in sabase adhki bharat kii aseem dhan sampatti se aakarshith hokar vibhinn videshi akramanakariyon dwaara samay-samay par hue akraman bhi is tathy ko pramanit karte hai
 Ancient Indian civilization was not only based on prosperity, but its internal and external trade and commerce were also very advanced
 vyavsaayik jagat ke vibhinn kshetron main bharat kaa aseem yogadan he
 On comparing it with the occupations prevailing in other countries of the time, we find that Indian business was far ahead in its singularity, mobility (dynamic) and quality
 shuru ke dinon main bhartiya arthvyavastha purnatah krishi adhrith thi
 People used to produce their consumption items themselves
 vastuon ko bechney athwa vinimay kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin thi
 But with the development, the needs of the people started increasing
 jiske kaaran vastuon ke utpaadan main bhi vrudhi hone lagi
 People began to specialize in the production of various items of daily use and luxury, and thus they lacked the nature and scope of business and efficiency to produce other items of their use
 is prakaar inaki kushalta main vrudhi hone lagi or ye apni aavashyaktaa se adhki vastuon kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 Hence, to meet their other requirements, a system of exchange of their overproduced goods developed
 yah vyapaar kii shuruuaat thi
 Today, most people believe that much development in the field of business and trade in India has taken place only after attaining independence
 bharat, aaj audyogic utpaadan main itnaa sakasham ho gaya he ki ham sabhi vastuon kaa utpaadan deshi takanic ke prayog se kar sakate hai
 But it should not be taken from this that Indian civilization was not developed or advanced in the past
 jabaki hamen aaj bhi bharat kii samrudhi vyapaarik va vanijyik dhrohar par garv he
 You will be surprised to know that India started its journey in the field of trade and commerce 5000 years BC
 Had started kai aitihaasik saakshyon se yah pramanit hota he ki us samay bharat main suniyojit shahar the
 There was a worldwide fascination for Indian clothing, jewelery and perfumes etc
 yah bhi pramaan mili hai ki kaaphi samay se bhartiya vyapaariyon main vyavsaay ke liye mudra ke prayog kaa chalan tha
 Unions were popularized to protect the interests of traders, craftsmen and producers
 yah bharat main vyapaar va vaanijya ke jatil vikaas kii ore sanket karata he
 The merchants of India at that time not only weaved a network of strong internal trade routes, but also had commercial connections with merchants from Arabia, Central and South East Asia
 bharat vibhinn prakaar kii datu saamagree ke utpaadan main bhi sakriy tha, jaise tamba, pital kii vasteen, bartan, gahane tathaa sajaavati saamaan aadi
 Indian traders exported their products to different parts of the world and imported their products from there
 yah ek sarvavidit tathy he ki angrej sarvapratham bharat main vyapaar karne ke liye hi aae the, jinhone baad main yahaan apana rajya sthapit kar liya
 India has contributed to world trade and commerce in many ways
 gananaa ke liye ank pranali, jiskaa ham aaj bhi upyog karte hai, bharat main pehle se viksit thi
 Joint family practice and division of labor in business also developed here, which is prevalent till date
 aaj aadhnik samay main prayog kii jane vaali upabhokta kendrit vyavsaay takanic puraane samay se bhartiya vyavsaay kaa ek abhinn ang rahi he
 Therefore we can say that India has its own rich commercial heritage, which has contributed significantly to its growth
 sabhi vyavsaayik kriyaayein kuch uddeshyon kii purti ke liye kii jaati hai
 Business objectives can be classified as follows: vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ke antargat laabh kamaane ke uddeshy ke saath ve samast aavashyak kriyaayein bhi aati hai, jinke dwaara laabh kamaane ke uddeshy kii purti kii jaati he, jaise graahak bananaa, niyamit nav pravartan tathaa uplabdh sansadhano kaa behatar upyog aadi
 Profit serves as the life force for business
 iske bina koi bhi vyavsaay pratiyogita ke bazaar main tikaa nahin rah saktaa
 In fact, the purpose of any business entity coming into existence is profit making
 laabh, vyavsaayee ko na keval uski aajeevika arjeet karne main sahaayta karata he, apitu laabh kaa ek bhaag vyavsaay main punah viniojit kar vyavsaayik gatividhyin ke vistaar main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Following are some other objectives of the business to achieve the primary objective of making profit: saamaajik uddeshy vyavsaay ke ve uddeshy hote hai, jinhen samaaj ke hiton ke liye praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, the aim of every business should be to not harm the society in any way
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uddeshyon ke antargat acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuon tathaa sevaaon kaa utpaadan tathaa purti, uchit vyapaarik prathaen apnaanaa, samaaj ke saamaanya kalyankari kaaryon main yogadan tathaa kalyankari suvidhaon main yogadan karnaa sammilit he
 Human purposes mean those objectives which have the goals of the welfare of the disabled and the disabled, deprived of education or training and fulfillment of the expectations of the employees
 is prakaar vyavsaay ke maanviya uddeshyon ke antargat karmchaariyon kii aarthik suraksha, saamaajik tathaa manovaigyanik santushti or maanav sansadhano kaa vikaas nihit he
 Business is an important part of the country, so the achievement of national goals and aspirations should be the objective of every business
 vyavsaay ke rashtriya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai: Earlier India had very limited trade relations with other countries
 tab vastuon kii aayaat or niryaat sambandhi nitiyaan bahut kathor thim, lekin aajkal udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran kaaphi had tak videshi nivesh par pratibandh samaapt ho chukaa he, tathaa aaayaatit vastuon par lagane vaala shulk bhi kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 These changes have increased competition in the market
 aaj vaishvikaran ke kaaran puri duniya ek bade bazaar ke rup main parivartit ho chuki he
 Today, finished goods are easily available in one country
 is prakaar vishwa bazaar main pratispardhaa badhane se prayek vyavsaay apane mastishk main kuch uddeshy rakhkar kaam karne laga he, jise vaishvik uddeshy kaha ja saktaa he
 People run businesses with the aim of making a profit
 lekin keval laabh arjeet karnaa hi vyavsaay kaa ekmaatra uddeshy nahin hota
 Being a part of society, it also has to do a lot of social work
 yah vishesh rup se apane astitv kii suraksha main sanlagn swaamiyon, niveshkon, karmchaariyon tathaa saamaanya rup se samaaj vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra va samudaay kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaataa he
 Therefore, every business should bear responsibilities towards them in one way or the other
 udhaaharan ke liye, niveshkon ko uchit pratifal kii dar kaa aashwaasan dena, apane karmchaariyon ko acha vetan, suraksha, uchit kaary dashaayen uplabdh karana, apane graahakon ko acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuen uchit mulyon par ulabdh karana, paryaavaran kii suraksha karnaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya bahut se kaary karne chahie
 While doing such work, two things should be specially taken care of for sustaining the social responsibilities of the business
 pehali to yah ki aisi prayek kriya rdhmarth kriya nahin hoti
 This means that if a business donates some money to a hospital or temple or a school or college, it will not be called its social responsibility, because donating does not discharge social responsibilities
 duusari baat yah he ki, is tarah kii kriyaayein kuch logon ke liye acchhee or kuch logon ke liye buree nahin honi chahie
 Suppose a businessman earns a lot of money by smuggling or shoving his customers and runs a hospital for free treatment of the poor, then his work is not socially justified
 saamaajik uttardaayitv kaa arth he ki ek vyavsaayee saamaajik kriyaaon ko sampann karte samay aisa kuch bhi na kare, jo samaaj ke liye hanikaarak ho
 Thus the concept of social responsibility encourages the businessman to earn profit through prudent management in lieu of unfair trade practices like hoarding and black marketing, tax evasion, adulteration, expulsion of customers
 yah karmchaariyon ko uchit kaary tathaa awasaiya suvidhen pradaan karke, graahakon ko utpaada vikray uparaant uchit sevaayen pradaan karke, paryaavaran pradooshan ko niyantrit karke tathaa prakritik sansadhanon kii suraksha dwaara sambhav he
 Having learned about the concept of social responsibility of the business and its importance, let us find out what the business has responsibilities towards its various interest groups on which it is dependent
 vyavsaay praayah swaamiyon, vinieveshkon, karmchaariyon, purtikartaaon, graahakon tathaa upabhoktaaon, pratiyogiyon, sarkaar tathaa samaaj par ashrith he
 These are called interest groups because the interests of these groups are directly or indirectly affected by each action of the business
 vyavsaay ke apane swaamiyon ke prati uttardaayitv hai : The business has responsibilities to its creditors: vyavsaay ke apane karmchaariyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business to its suppliers: graahakon ke prati vyavsaay ke uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : The business has the following responsibilities towards its competitors: sarkaar ke prati vyavsaay ke vibhinn uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : a society consists of individuals, groups, organizations, families etc
 ye sabhi samaaj ke sadsy hote hai
 All of them are similar with each other and depend on each other for almost all their activities
 in sabhi ke bich ek sambandh hota he, chaahe vah pratyaksh ho yaa apratyaksh
 Being a part of society, business should also help in maintaining relations between the members of the society
 iske liye use samaaj ke prati kuch nishchit uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah karnaa aavashyak he
 These responsibilities are as follows: pramila bhatta ek purv bhartiya mahila cricket khilaadi he jo gharelu cricket bangalore ke liye khelti thim

 kanthmala lasika grathiyon kaa ek chirkaari rog he
 In this, the glands of the throat enlarge and their rosary becomes like that, hence it is called kanthmala
 ayurveda main iskaa varnan 'gandamala' tathaa 'apchi' do naam se uplabdh he, jinhen kanthmala ke do bhed yaa do avasthaaen bhi kah sakate hai
 The knot of proof of small plum, big plum or amla gets in the throat which takes the form of garland, they are called Gandmala
 parantu yah kshey he or iskaa sthaan keval greeva pradesh hi nahin he apitu sharir ke anya bhaagon main bhi, jaise kaksh, vaksh aadi sthanon main grathiyon ke saath hi iskaa pradurbhaav yaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 Being a series of knots or garlands, it is called Gandmala
 gyatavya he ki maamuli pratishyay, vran ityadi kaarnon se bhi ye granthiyaan vikrut hokar bad jaati hai parantu maala nahin ban paati hai at: inkaa antarbhaav isamen nahin hota
 When there is a pak in the garland of these glands, it is called 'apachi'
 iskaa pradhan lakshan he ki kisi granthi ke paak ho jaataa he or vah footkar bah jaati he, parantu iske saath hi duusari granthi main paak hone lagata he or vah bhi sravit ho jaati he
 In this way, new glands grow, erupt and flow and this sequence keeps on going
 parantu vran bharne par uskaa chihn rah jaataa he jisase uske sthaan kaa pataa lagata rahata he
 In this way, due to repeated anabolism of new glands, it has been called indigestion
 is sandarbh main kai lekhakon kaa drushtikon he ki gandamala or apchi ek hi rog he or isaki do avasthaaen hai
 But it is known that some glands are such that they are never cooked and some are
 in donon kaa kaaran, lakshan evam chikitsa sab kuch bhinn he at: inako do bhinn varg bhi mana ja saktaa he, ek pakanevaali or duusari na pakanevaali
 But in Kanthamala, both are interspersed
 aadhunik chikitsa pranali main kanthmala kaa tatsam rup sarvaaical linfadinitis he
 In this, there is growth of lymph gland of cervical region which is also called lymph node
 mukh main, gale ke bheetar, kaan main yaa shir par kisi prakaar ke shoth yaa paak ke kaaran ye granthiyaan bad jaati hai jo pramukh rog kii chikitsa yaa shanti par pun: baith jaati hai parantu inkaa swaroop kabhi maala kaa nahin hota or ye chirkaari bhi nahin hotin
 They are often dishonest, that is, they both rise and peace in a short time
 chirkaari praakar kii grathiyon ke mukhya kaaran teen hai- 1
 Tuberculous lymph gland 2
 aupdanshik lasika granthi 3
 lymphoma tumors kshay rog kii utpatti kshay ke keetanuon se hoti he, aisa siddh hi ho chukaa he
 There are two types of decaying germs: 1
 human, 2
 bowine
 In this, first type of germs cause lung diseases, second type of germs are from throat, intestines and the corresponding lymphatic glands
 isse spasht he ki kanthmala kii utpatti bowine jati ke keetanu se hoti he
 It is noteworthy that this type of germ is transmitted by cow's milk
 yadi doodh ko acchhee tarah ubalkar piya jaae to is rog ke hone kii sambhaavna nahi rah jaati he
 As far as its symptoms and treatment are concerned, it arises in the form of glands especially in the front part of the throat and keeps ripening and bursting respectively
 saath hi, rajyakshma ke anya sabhi lakshan, jaise fever, bhukh kaa kam laganaa, durbalata aadi bhi paae jate hai
 Streptomycin and isoniazid and nearby are commonly used in its treatment
 is rog se purna mukt hone ke liye chikitsa lambey samay tak kerani chahie
 Otherwise there is a fear of re-emergence
 kisi-kisi avasthaa main shalya chikitsa kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Also, the utility of nutritious food and proper rest is no less than disease prevention
 ye granthiyaan bahudhaa gardan ke saamne ke bhaag main pai jaati hai
 They are difficult and unnatural
 inamen vednaa bhi nahin hoti
 Therefore, they do not take the form of scrofula
 inaki utpatti kaa kaaran upadansh ke jeevanu hai
 Its treatment is also anti-syphilis
 pehle arsenic, bisamath evam mercury aadi dhaatuon kaa prayog inaki chikitsa main hota tha
 But they were very toxic, so slowly they have stopped being used
 aajkal isaki sugam chikitsa pencylin ke dwaara hi hoti he or ab pencylin ke yug main greeva ke aupdanshik lasika grathiyon ke rogi dikhaai bhi kam dete hai
 Hachkin disease, leukemia, and lymphosarcoma are mainly tumors of the lymph nodes
 inamen hachakin dijij pramukh he
 Lymphosarcoma is a malignant disease in which one can die within two to three weeks and leukemia is a type of blood cancer in which spleen enlargement occurs exclusively

 They seem flexible to the touch
 kuch dinon ke baad rogi main rakt kii ati kshinta ho jaati he tathaa rogi ko aniyamit dhang se fever bhi aane lagata he
 In short, it is worth remembering that not all lymphatic glands in the cervix are of the same type and their treatment is also different
 sabhi grathiyon kii kanthmala shabd se sambodhit karnaa bhi uchit nahin he
 The term kanthamala is used exclusively for the caries lymphatic glands
 kankapur, lokeshwaran mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke adilabadu jile kaa ek gaanv he

 The main views of Islamic religion are: musalmaan ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ve allaah kehete hai
 Monotheism is called Tauheed in Arabic, which comes from the word vahid which means one
 islam main ishwar ko maanav kii samaj se pare mana jaataa he
 Muslims have been asked to pray to God instead of imagining him
 musalamaanon ke anusaar ishwar adwitiya he - uske jaisaa or koi nahin
 a unique concept of God has been emphasized in Islam and it is also believed that it is beyond human to describe it completely
 kaho: No one has given birth to him nor is he the father of anyone
 evam us jaisaa koi or nahin he
 " islam ke anusaar ishwar ne dharti par manushya ke maargdarshan ke liye samay samay par kisi vyakti ko apana doot banaaya
 Around 124,000 prophets were sent to the temple to give a message to worship God
 yah doot bhi inso main se hote the or ishwar kii ore logon ko bulaate the
 God used to communicate with these messengers in various ways
 in ko islam main nabi kehete hai
 The prophets to whom God himself provided scriptures or religious books are called Rasul
 mohammad sahab bhi isi kadi kaa bhaag the
 The name of the religious book that was given to him is Quran
 quran main allaah ke 25 anya nabiyon kaa varnan he
 According to the Quran itself, God has sent many more prophets to the earth besides these prophets, which are not mentioned in the Quran
 sabhi musalmaan ishwar dwaara bheje gayi sabhi nabiyon kii vaidhata sweekaar karte hai or musalmaan, mohammad ko ishwar kaa antim nabi maanate hai
 The Ahmadiyya community does not consider Muhammad Sahab the last prophet, yet calls himself a follower of Islam and is accepted by the United Nations, although it is prohibited in many Islamic nations to consider him a Muslim
 bharat ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke anusaar unako bharat main musalmaan mana jaataa he
 All religious books provided by Allah to the Rasools are valid for Muslims
 musalamanon ke anusaar quran ishwar dwaara manushya ko pradaan kii gayi antim dharmik pustak he
 Four more books are discussed in the Quran: musalmaan yah maanate hai ki isaayiyon or yahudiyon ne apni pustakon ke sandeshon main badlaav kar diye hai
 They do not deny the possibility of other religious books other than these four being divine
 musalmaan devdooton ke astitv ko maanate hai
 According to him, the angels themselves have no conscience and obey God as they please
 vah keval roshni se baniin hooi amoort or nirdosh akritiyaan hai jo ki na purush hai na stri, balki manushya se har drushti se alag hai
 Although angels are uncountable, some angels influence in the Quran: madhya asia ke anya dharmon ke samaan islam main bhi brahmad kaa ant pralay ke din dwaara mana jaataa he
 According to this, God will one day finish the world
 yah din kab aayegaa isaki sahi jaankaree keval ishwar ko hi he
 According to Islam, all dead people will be resurrected that day and those who live their lives will be sent to heaven according to the command of Allah and those who do not obey his order will be burnt to hell
 musalmaan bhagya ko maanate hai
 The meaning of fate for them is that God knows all about the past, present and future
 koi bhi ghatana uski anumati ke bina nahin ho sakati he
 Man has the freedom to live on his own volition, but his permission has also been given to him by God
 islam ke anusaar manushya apane kukarmon ke liye swayan uttardaai isliye he kyonki unhen karne yaa na karne kaa nirnay ishwar manushya ko swayan hi lene detaa he
 God also has prior knowledge of his misdeeds
 islam ke do pramukh varg hai, shiya or sunni
 Both have their own Islamic rules but the basic principles are similar
 bahut se sunni, shiyaon ko purnat: musalmaan nahin maanate
 Every Muslim has 5 essential duties in Sunni Islam, also known as the 5 pillars of Islam
 shiya islam main thode alag siddhanton ko stambh kaha jaataa he
 There are 5 pillars of Sunni Islam- arabi:لا اله الا الله محمد رسول اللهlipyaantar : laa elaha illallaah mohammad rasul allaah hindi: allaah ke sivaa or koi parameshwar nahin he or mohammad allaah ke rasul hai
 With this declaration, every Muslim testifies to the monotheism of God and his belief in Muhammad as Rasul
 yah islam kaa sabase pramukh siddhant he
 It is mandatory for every Muslim to accept it musalamaanon ke liye islam jivan ke har pahalu par apana prabhaav rakhata he
 Islamic principles influence the domestic life of Muslims, their political or economic life, the foreign policy of Muslim states, etc
 sharia us samucchy niti ko kehete hai jo islamic kanoonee paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 The study of jurisprudence is called Fiqh by making the policy of Sharia the foundation
 fiqah ke maamle main islamic vidwaanon kii alag alag vyakhyaaon ke kaaran islam main nyaayashastra kai bhaagon main bat gaya or kai alag alag nyaayashastra se sambandhit vichaardhaaron kaa janm hua
 These are called panthas
 sunni islam main pramukh panth hai- Most Muslims believe that the four texts are fundamentally correct and the differences are in the nuanced interpretations of jurisprudence
 mohammad paigambar ko makka kii pahadiyon main param gyaan 610 ke aasapaas praapt hua
 When he started teaching, the rich people of Mecca considered it a threat to their social and religious system and opposed them
 ant main 622 main unhen apane anuyaayiyon ke saath makka se madina ke liye kooch karnaa padaa
 This journey is called Hijra and it is from here that the Islamic calendar begins
 madina ke logon kii zindagi aapasi ladaayeeyon se pareshaan si thi or hazrat mohammad sahab ke sandeshon ne unhen vahaan bahut lokapriy bana diya
 In 630, Hazrat Muhammad sahab invaded Mecca due to a breach of a treaty with his followers
 makkavsiyon ne aatmasamarpan karke islam kabool kar liya
 The Kaaba located in Mecca was declared a holy place of Islam
 632 main paigambar mohammad sahab kaa dehanth ho gaya
 But until his death, all Arab tribes had become part of a political and social civilization under the influence of Islam
 is ke baad islam main khilaafat kaa daur shuru hua
 Muhammad's father-in-law Abu Bakr Siddiq was the first caliph of the Muslims in 632
 kai pramukh musalamaanon ne mil ke unka khalipha hona sweekaar kiya
 According to Sunni Muslims, there was no dispute regarding the struggle against Abu Bakr Siddiq, but all of them had accepted the Khalifa, according to Sunni beliefs, Hazrat Muhammad Sahab himself tried to impose Abu Bakr Siddiq in his place before his exile
 Abu Bakr Siddiq had indicated to be the Khalifa by taking charge of the work, in 632, Muhammad Sahab in his last Haj i had addressed his teammates near the lake
 shiya vishwaas ke anusaar is kitaab main unhone apane damaad ali ko apana vaaris banaaya tha
 Sunnis consider this incident as praise for Hazrat Ali and believe that he did not appoint Hazrat Ali Khalifa
 isi baat ko lekar dono pakshon main matbhed shuru hota he
 After the Hajj, Muhammad Sahib began to remain ill
 unhone sabhi bade sahaabiyon ko bula kar kaha ki mujhe kalam daavaat de do ki main tumko esa navishta likh don ki tum bhatko nahin to umr ne kaha ki ye hijayaan kah rahe he or nahin dene diya 
 According to Shia history, even when news of Prophet's death was received, he did not come back and started gathering in Sakifa, what should be done now
 jis samay hazarat mohammad kii mrityu hui, ali or unke kuch or mitra mohammad sahab ko dafanaane main lage the, abu baqar madina main jaakar kilaafat ke liye vimarsh kar rahe the
 Many people of Medina agreed to make Abu Bakr a caliph
 dhyaan rahe ki mohammad sahib evam ali ke kabeeley vaale yani bani hashim ali ko hi khalipha bananaa chaahate the
 But there was no solidarity among the Muslims to inherit the largest empire of Islam ever
 kai logon ke anusaar ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai the or damaad bhi hi mohammad sahab ke asli vaaris the
 But Abu Bakr was first made Khalifa and after his death Umar was made Khalifa
 isse ali ke samarthak logon main or bhi rosh failaa parantu ali musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye chup rahe
 But according to the Shia Muslim, Muhammad's uncle Jad brother, Ali, whom Muslims respected so much, refused to consider Abu Bakr as a caliph
 lekin yah vivaad islam kii tabaahi ko rokne ke liye vastav main hazarat ali kii sujh bujh ke kaaran tal gaya abu bakr ke kaarykaal main purvi roman samrajya or irani samrajya se musalmaan phujon kii ladaai hooi
 These wars were part of the enmity going on since the time of Muhammad
 abu bakr ke baad umr bin khattab ko 634 main khalipha banaaya gaya
 During his tenure, the Islamic empire spread very rapidly and the entire Iranian Empire and two-thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire were captured by Muslims
 puure samrajya ko vibhinn pradeshon main baat diya gaya or or har pradesh kaa ek rajyapal niyukt kar diya gaya jo kii khalipha kaa adheen hota tha
 Usman bin Affan became the Khalifa in 644, after Umar bin Khatab
 yah bhi mohammad ke pramukh saathiyon main se the
 His opponents began to accuse Usman bin Afan that he made appointments out of favor and that Ali was rightfully entitled to be the Khalifa
 tabhi misr main vidroh kii bhaavana jaagane lagi or vahaan se 1000 logon kaa ek sashastr samooh islamic samrajya kii rajdhani madina aa gaya
 Till that time, all the Khalifa lived like ordinary people
 is liye yah samooh 656 main usmaan kii hatya karne main safal ho gaya
 Some prominent Muslims now accepted Ali as the Khalifa, but some leading Muslims also turned against Ali
 in musalamaanon kaa maananaa tha kii jabatak usmaan ke hatyaron ko sazaa nahin milti ali kaa khalipha bananaa sahi nahin he
 This was the first civil war of Islam
 shuru main is dal ke ek hisse kii aguai aaysha, jo kii mohammad kii patni thi, kar rahi thim
 Between the armies of Ali and Aashya, there is a battle called jung-e-jamal
 is jang main ali kii sena vijay hooi
 Now the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya played the bugle of rebellion
 muavia usmaan ke rishtedaar bhi the muavia kii sena or ali kii sena ke bich main jang hooi par koi parinaam nahin niklaa
 Ali had already changed the capital from Medina to Kufa to overcome the unrest spread in the empire
 muavia kii senaain ab puure islamic samrajya main fail gayin or jald hi kufa ke pradesh ke sivaaye saare samrajya par muavia kaa kabja ho gaya
 Then a radical killed Ali in 661
 ali ke baad haalanki muavia khalipha ban gayi lekin musalamaanon kaa ek varg rah gaya jiskaa maananaa tha ki musalamaanon kaa khalipha mohammad ke parivaar kaa hi ho saktaa he
 He believed that this caliph gets spiritual guidance by God himself
 inke anusaar ali pehle imaam the
 This class became known as Shia class
 baaki musalmaan, jo kii yah nahin maanate hai ki mohammad kaa parivarajan hi khalipha ho saktaa he, sunni kahalaaye
 The Sunni first called the Rashidun Khalifa, which means the Khalifa on the right path
 muavia ke khalipha banane ke baad khilaafat vanshanugat ho gayi
 This led to the Umayyad Khilafat
 shiya itihaas kaaron ke anusaar muavia k bete yajid ne khilaafat praapt karte hi islam kii nitio ke viruddh kaary karnaa shuru kar diya, uske krity se dharmik musalmaan asahaj sthiti main aa gaye, ab yajid ko aayshyaktaa thi kii apni galat nitio ko aise vyakti se manyata dilaa de jis par sabhi muslmaan bharosa karte ho, is kaam ke liye yajid ne hazarat mohammad ke navaase, hazarat ali alaihis salaam or hazarat mohammad kii iklauti putree fatima ke putr hazarat hossain se apni khilaafat par manjuuri kerani chaahi parantu hazarat hossain ne uske islam kii nitio ke viruddh kaary karne ke kaaran apni manjuuri dene se manaa kar diya, hazarat hossain ke manaa karne par yajid kii phujon ne hazarat hossain or unke 72 saathiyo par pani band kar diya or badi hi bedardi ke saath unka qatl karke unke ghar waalo ko bandhak bana liya, kaii sunni itihaas kaaron ne bhi apni pustakon main yajid ko hossain ke qatl kaa zimmedaar mana he parantu ye sabhi shiya itihaas kaaron se prerit the yaa inke gyaan kaa asal kendra shiyaon kii gadi gayi banu umayya ke viruddh juthi kahaniyaan he
 Imam Ahmad bin Humbl, the great Sunni diocese, Imam Ghazali, etc
, has not held Yazid responsible for the killing of Hussain
 is jang main hossain ko shahadat prapti ho gayi

 Post-uranium element or parauranium element or transuranic element are chemical elements having atomic weight greater than 92
 92, uranium kaa parmaanu bhaar he
 Hence, they all come after uranium in the periodic table
 inamen se koi bhi tatva sthir nahin hota he, va radiodharmee kshay ke uparaant anya chote tattvon main badal jate hai
 Looking at the periodic table, it will be known that uranium is the heaviest of the elements found in nature and its atomic number is 92, but there are some man-made elements which have atomic number more than 92
 in tatwon ko ham uranimottar tatv, yaa parauranium tatv, kehete hai
 All these elements are unstable and have radioactive properties

 It has two sub-disciplines: 'dhaatu' ke anya arthon ke liye dekhen - dhaatu According to chemistry, metals are those elements that readily give up electrons and form cations and form metallic bonds with atoms of metals
 electranik model ke aadhaar par, dhaatu electranon dwaara aachhadit dhanayanon kaa ek latis hai
 Traditional definitions of metals are given based on their external properties
 saamanytah dhaatu chamkile, pratyasth, aghatvardhaneey or sugarh hote hai
 Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, while non-metals are generally brittle, shiny, and are conductors of electricity and heat
 rasinic tatwon ko sarvapratham dhaatuon or adhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya, yadhyapi donon samoohon ko bilkul pruthak nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Defining metal is a difficult task
 mote rup se ham kah sakate hai ki yadi kisi tatv main nimnlikhit sampurna yaa kuch gun hon to use dhaatu kahenge : We can say that if an element is not luminous and conducts electricity in a pure state, it is non-metal
 prakruti main asamyukt avasthaa main birli dhaatu hi milti he
 Gold, silver, platinum and sometimes copper metals are occasionally found
 adhikansh dhaatuon ke ayask milte hai jo adhaatuon ke saath dhaatuon ke yogic hote hai
 These compounds are also mixed in other minerals rather than in pure state
 in ayskon se vividh ritiyon dwaara dhaatuen nikaali jaati hai
 Metals are often chemically reactive
 hawa main oxygen se sanyog kar dhatvik aksaid banaate hai
 Alkali metals are the most functional, while alkali soil metals are followed by them
 udaahranarth - Oxidation of transition metals occurs relatively slowly
 dhatvik aksaid dhaatu ke upar ek parat bana lete hai, jaise - lohe main jang laganaa
 Metallic oxides are alkaline while non-metallic oxides are predominantly acidic
 hellojanon se abhikriya karte dhaatu dhatvik heloid lavan banaate hai
 For example - adhik kriyasheel dhaatu jal ke saath abhikriya karke kshar banaate hai or hydrogen gas mukt karte hai
 Less reactive metals do not react with water at ordinary temperatures, but they react with steam in hot state to form metallic oxides
 amlon se abhikriya karke dhaatu lavan banaate hai or hidrogen gas mukt karte hai - Metals are malleable - they can be beaten with a hammer and lengthened
 jaise kisi aluminium yaa tambe ke taar ko par prahaar karan se uskaa prasar hota he
 Metals are also ductile, that is, they can be pulled to form a long wire
 adhaatuon main yah gun nahin paaya jaataa he
 For example, no matter how much phosphorus is drawn, it cannot be made as a long wire
 dhaatuon kaa ghanatv bhi ucch hota he tathaa inamen ek vishesh prakaar kii chamak hoti he jise 'dhatvik chamak' kehete hai
 Most metals range from brownish white to shiny white
 swarna or tamra iske apwaad hai
 All metals are solid except ordinary mercury

 he, parantu tungsten kaa 5,930° sein

 It is estimated that the tantalum is 6,100 ° C
 Will evaporate yadi ham vidyut-chaalakata par dhyaan den, to gyaat hoga ki adhaatuon ke vipareet dhaatuen uttam chaalak hai
 Silver is the best electrolytic among metals
 yadi tulana ke liye uski chaalakata 100 maan lee jaae to kuch anya saadhaaran dhaatuon kii chaalakata nimnlikhit sarini ke anusaar hogi- The conductivity of the boron would be 10–10 on this measurement
 isi prakaar dhaatuen uttam ooshmaa chaalak bhi hoti hai
 In particular, both conductivities of pure metals remain approximately in the same order
 taap ghataane par dhaatuon kaa vidyutpratirodh ghatata he, athwa ham yah bhi kah sakate hai ki chaalakata badhati he
 Metals increase in size as their temperature increases
 is gun ko tapiya prasar kehete hai
 The same properties of mercury are taken advantage of in thermometers
 kuch aisi mishradhatuen bhi bani hai jinka taap ke saath tapiya prasar ati sookshm he
 Magnetic properties are absent in other metals except iron, nickel, and cobalt
 dhaatu main apana aakaar rakhane kii badi kshamta hoti he
 On this side it is very resistant to external pressure
 mangneej sabase kathor dhaatu he or lithium sabase komal
 Tungsten is the best and very low lead in stress
 anek dhaatuon main ghatuvardhyataa or tanyata ke gun hote hai
 They can be beaten and made into thin layers
 tanyata ke falswaroop yadi kisi patale chhidr ke madhya se unhen khinchaa jaae to unke patale taar khinch aayenge
 Metals are crystalline which is mostly of the money system
 dhaatu ke parmaanu dhan ke aakaar main susajjit hone ke kaaran isi shrenee ke crystal banaate hai
 Some metals form the crystalline system
 kabhi kabhi ek hi dhaatu ke parmaanu ek se adhik pranali main vyavasthit hokar vibhinn rup main crystal banaate hai
 These will be called imperfection
 dhaatu ke parmaanu electrondaata hote hai
 Their cations in the crystal will remain in the fixed space and free electrons in their spaces
 is prakaar yah electron swatantra or sachal rahenge, jiske kaaran dhaatu main ucch chaalakata, paravartakata aadi gun aa jate hai
 Almost all properties of metals are the function of their atomic number
 yah aavartita parmaanu aaytan vidyut or ooshmaa chaalakata, ghatvardhyataa, tanyata, sangalan kii gupt ooshmaa aadi main ullekhneey hai
 Ladder Maier first attracted the attention of scientists towards this periodicity by the periodic table of elements

 This is also called 'anti-discrimination'
 bhedabhed siddhanth ke aacharyon main audhulomi, ashmarathy, bhatri prapanch, bhaskar or yadav ke naam aate hai
 The credit for reestablishing this ancient principle in the name of ‘dvaitaadvaita’ goes to Nimbarkacharya

 Angrily, Blackstone compelled the university to fulfill its responsibilities by publishing a lengthy letter written in May 1757 to Thomas Randolph, the heir to Hadesford
 yahan, blackstone ne press ko ek janmajaat sanstha ke rup main prastut kiya jisane "ek aalas bhari gumnami

 Both figures sounded too optimistic

 This was not an unusual arrangement for the press of scholars or archaeologists

 Froud's agency was set up for a timely revised edition, published on 17 May 1881, and sold one million copies at an alarming rate before and after publication, although in the end it was in profit due to excessive production Decreased

 But Froud's distance from the press's decision meant that he was unable to influence this policy unless a representative favored him

 Cassell, considered blasphemously a commercial firm by GAIL representatives, was making a name for himself in a publishing firm called Petter & Galpin
 gail khud ek kuleen vyakti the jo apane kaam se naakhush the jahaan unhone khud ko 'ek varg: nimna madhya' ke swaad ke liye khanpan kaa intjaam karte hue paaya or unhone oupi dwaara aakarshith pathakon or granthon ke saath kaam karne ke maukey kaa phayda uthaaya
 Jowett promised Gayle golden opportunities, some of which he also had the right to provide
 unhone gail kii niyukti ko lambii chuttee or mark patison kii maut ke samay main hi nirdhaarit kiya isliye sambhavit vipakshi mahatvapurn baithkon main bhaag na le sake
 Jowett knew very well why Gayle would be opposed because he had never worked for the press, nor was he a representative, and had lost his career in the city by his raw knowledge of commerce
 unka dar dur hua
 Gail immediately proposed a complete modernization of the press with a marked lack of tact and gave rise to permanent enemies for himself
 phir bhi unhone fraud ke saath milakar bahut kuch kiya or 1898 tak prakaashan kaaryakramon or oupi kii pahunch kaa vistaar kiya
 After that, due to the non-cooperation of the delegates, their health deteriorated due to the impossible working conditions faced by them

 In his view, the press was a consortium of scholars and it will always be so
 Gayle's idea of 'skill' appeared to be in violation of that culture, although a similar reform program was later put into practice from the inside

 Both were Oxford men who were familiar with its inside-out system and the close collaboration with which they worked was the result of their shared background and worldview

 Whatever be the reason for his style of working, both Cannan and Milford had a very rigorous and practical approach required to work and he took his step forward to make this work
 In fact, within a few weeks of Milford entering the London office, Froud found out that he would be replaced
 However, Milford always dealt with Froud dearly and Froud remained in an advisory capacity until 1913

 Not all of them were full-fledged branches: there was a depot in Leipzig run by H
 Bohoon Beat, and small working depots in cities in Canada and Australia, along with books published by companies, selling stock of the press For there was an army of educational representatives with knowledge of rural stability whose agencies were held by the press, often fictitious And light-readable materials

 The press experienced World War II like the First World War, the only difference being that Milford was now about to retire and that he 'hated the movement of young people'
 This time the air invasion in London was very dangerous and the London business was temporarily shifted to Oxford
