 When it comes to the Indian perspective, the right to recall means right to recall stems from the land of Bihar

 Article 13: - The state will not make any law which takes away the fundamental rights

 Article 13: Under the law, there are ordinances, orders, bye-laws, rules, bye-laws, notification, stereotypes and practices similar to the law in India, that is, if any of these violates the basic rights, then by writ in the court
 Can be challenged

 In every political system, power is concentrated only among a few people or minority groups
 yah kis prakaar hota he? raajnneetik samajashaastra main in prashn kaa uttar dhundne ke prayaason ke parinaam-swaroop hi abhijan sambandhi siddhanton kaa vikaas hua he
 Aristocratic principles are based on the fact that there are broadly two distinct classes in each society - one, a class of minorities or minorities who, by virtue of their ability, give the supreme leadership and rule to the society, and the other, People-group or class of innumerable common people, whose fate is written to be governed
 pratham varg ko abhijan varg or duusare ko jansamooh kaha jaataa he
 The concept of aristocracy was first seen only from the political point of view and attention was paid only to the ruling class and powerful elite, but today it is not so
 aaj abhijanon main shaktishaalee abhijan varg, poonjipati varg, sainik abhijan, shaasha-varg, buddhijivi varg, naukarshahon tathaa prabandhakon ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 In addition to the uneven distribution of power, studies of social stratification have also contributed significantly to the development of elite theories
 aaj abhijan kaa sanpratyay raajnneeti shaastra, samajashaastra evam raajnneetik samajashaastra main ek moulik sanpratyay mana jaataa he
 This theory is very important in understanding socio-political reality because some kind of social, political, economic stratification is found in every society

 The names of scholars such as Pareto, Mosca, C
 Wright Mills, Edward Shils, Shumpeter, Roberta Mitchells, James Burnham, Raymond Aron, Carl Manheim, Harold Laswell, etc
 are associated with the elitist theories
 yahan par katipay pramukh vidwaanon ke vichaaron kaa sankshipt vivechan hi samuchit hoga
 Wilfredo Pareto defines eligibility as saying that in every specific human action, if we give marks to the indicators of the area of the person's activities, then the person who gets the highest score is called elation
 duusare shabdon main, abhijanon main un sabhi safal vyaktiyon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he jo prayek gatividhi main or samaaj ke prayek str par sarvocch hote hai
 In his words, if a class is made of those people who get the highest marks in the field of any specific human activity, then they can name that class as elite
 gitaano moska pratham vidwaan hai jinhone ‘abhijan’ tathaa ‘jansamooh’ shabdon kaa prayog vishisht artho main kiya he
 In his words, in all societies, from societies which have developed very little and which have not yet been able to properly touch the first rays of civilization, even those societies which are the most developed and powerful, in all societies There are only two types of people
 ek, us varg ke log jo shashan karte hai or duusare, jin par shashan kiya jaataa he pehle varg ke log alpsankhyak hote hue bhi sabhi prakaar ke raajnneetik kaaryon kaa niyantran apane haathon main rakhte hai, sari satta unke haathon main kendrit hoti he tathaa satta ke laabhon kaa ras bhi unhen hi miltaa he, jabaki doosraa varg bahusankhyak hote hue bhi pratham varg dwaara kabhi vaid tareekon se or kabhi adhik yaa kam maatra main swechhachari evam hinsak tareekon se nirdeshit va niyantrit rahata he
 According to Mosca, in all types of governance, control is always in the hands of the elite
 saath hi shaasha varg main koi na koi aisa gun hota he jiske kaaran vah samaaj main sammanit evam prabhaavshaalee mana jaataa he, bhale hi ve gun yatharth hon athwa mahaj dikhaave maatr ke rup main hi bache hon
 Harold D
 Lasswell has paid special attention to political elite
 inke shabdon main raajnneetik abhijanon main raajnneetik nikaay ke sattadhariyon kaa samavesh hota he
 Those in power also include the leadership and social structure in which leaders emerge and to which they are responsible for a certain period
 remand es ne bhi laswell ke samaan abhijan varg ko mukhyatah shaasha varg hi mana he jo alp-sankhya main hota he
 They have tried to establish a relationship between the elite and other social classes and have discussed the social impact of intellectual elite who are not part of the system of political power
 tii0bi0 botomor ne uparyukt vidwaanon ke vichaaron se is aadhaar par asahmati prakat kii he ki unhone abhijan ke siddhanth main nihit vichaardhaara kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Bottomor, the concept of eligibility has developed in opposition to the importance of democracy
 inke anusaar ‘aaj abhijan shabd kaa prayog aamtaur par vastutah un prakaaryaatmak, mukhyatah vyavsaayik samoohon ke liye kiya jane laga he jinako samaaj main ucch sthaan praapt he
 In his view, the term new generation sociologists have used the term elite for more small and more organized groups which may be more or less related to the mutually united social classes
 batomor ke vichaar main remand eran hi ek maatr vidwaan hai jinhone abhijan varg main sambandh kaa adhyayan kiya he tathaa yah bataane kii cheshtaa kii he ki virgo ke unmoolan se saamaajik starikaran, abhijanon kaa nirmaan evam rajnatik satta kii vishmataaon kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 In other words, the existence of the elite will remain in every type of society and political system
 uparyukt vivechan se spasht hota he ki abhijan kii koi ek sarvamaanya paribhaasha nahin hai tathaa saamanytah sambhraatajanon main un vyaktiyon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he jo saamaajik, aarthik tathaa raajnneetik drushti se anya vyaktiyon arthath jan saadhaaran kii apeksha ucch sthiti rakhte hai is vivechan se hamen pataa chalata he ki sambhratajan vividh prakaar ke hai jaise ki shaasha varg, shaktishaalee sambhrantjan, buddhijivi varg, prabandhak, naukarshah tathaa sainik adhikari ityadi

 alag-alag sroton main in rashtrapitaon ke naam bhi alag-alag bataae jate hai
 American historian Richard Morris, in his 1973 book "the Seven Who Made Our Fortunes: The Revolutionary Form of Presidents", has given a small group of seven individuals the status of the real presidents of America - angrezi main "sanyukt rajya america ke rashtrapitaon" ko "founding faadarz of america" kaha jaataa he
 Tris is an organic compound
 
 According to the present tense grammatical definition, the form of a verb which indicates the presence of a situation or an event in the present time is called 'present tense'
 angrezi main, iskaa prayog vartmaan main ho rahi koi kriya, yaa koi sthiti, yaa bhavishya main hone vaali koi ghatana, yaa koi aisi kriya jo bhoot kaal main shuru hui ho or vartmaan main bhi jari ho darshane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Two common types of present tense are found in most indo-european languages: present indicative and present subjunctive
 angrezi bhashaa ke vartmaan kaal ko boli ke nimnlikhit pahaluon ke saath prayog kiya ja saktaa he: In the simple present tense, verb words in English are used without the ending, but after the other masculine pronouns used in the singular, she, it, your friend, etc
) suffix -s or -es are added to the end of the verb
 is saral vartmaan kaal ko akasar samay se sambandhit kriya visheshan ke saath prayog kiya jaataa he, jaisaa ki in udaahranon main tirchhe aksharon main likhe kriya visheshan: Romance languages are derived from the Latin language, especially the Western 'vulgar Latin'
 parinamswaroop unki upyogita or rup-rachana main bhi samanta hoti he
 In the Latin language, the present tense can be represented as progressive or simple
 nimnlikhit shabd kriyaaroop latin bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 In French, the present tense is used in the same way as in English
 neeche die shabd kriyaaroop francisi bhashaa main vartmaan kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 Expressions such as "en train de" or "en cours de" can be used to express present continuous
 udhaaharan ke liye, Jean est en train de' manger, kaa angrezi anuwaad hoga John is eating', yaa 'john is in the middle of eating' 
 On est en train de chercher un nouvel appartement kaa angrezi anuwaad hoga We are looking for a new apartment, we are in the process of finding a new apartment 
 In Portuguese, the present tense is used almost exactly like the Spanish language
 yahaan die shabd kriyaaroop portugali bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 In Spanish, the present tense is used in the same way as English
 yahaan die shabd kriyaaroop spanish bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 It is important to clarify that vostros and ustedes mean the same and that the Spanish language spoken in Latin America sometimes uses ustedes instead of vostros
 balgerian bhashaa main, apurna kriya pad ke vartmaan suchak kaal kaa prayog angrezi main hone vaale istemaal se bahut miltaa-julata he
 It can also be used as a present progressive
 neeche die shabd kriyaaroop balgerian bhashaa main vartmaan suchak kaal ke udhaaharan hai
 * Used in ancient language, noun is not available in modern language
 mysidonian bhashaa main apurna kriya padon ke istemaal se vartmaan kaal banataa he
 The table below gives examples of how to write, speak, love and open verb terms
 finish bhashaa main, kriya pad main sarvanaamon kaa apana hi alag samaapan hota he
 These verb terms can also be used without pronouns
 turki bhashaa main, swar-sangati ke anusaar sarvanaamon kaa apana alag hi samaapan hota he
 The suffix "r" seems to be in the present tense

 Maharishi Garg mentions two independent Nakshatra enumerations in the Vedic period - one Kritikadi and the other Dhanishtadi
 garg vaakya he ki- teshan sarveshan nakshatrana karmsu krittika prathammachachakshate shravishthatu sankhyayaa: purva lagnanam arthath sabhi nakshatron main agnyadhan aadi karmon main krittika kii gananaa pratham kahi jaati he kintu dhanishtha kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron main pratham he
 The secret is that at the time when the Tarapanja of Kritika was in the equator, Kritikadi Nakshatra calculation started
 jab uttarayan kaa aarambh dhanishtha par hota tha dhanishthadi gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 It is written in the Taittiriya Brahmana that Mukhna va etanakshananam yatakrittika etah va orienti diyo na chyvante i
e
 kritika is the first of all the nakshatras
 yah udai kaal main purv disha se nahin hatati
 It is certain that the planet or constellation that is in the equinox is the same rises everywhere on the earth plane in the east
 krittika kii akashiya sthiti ke anusaar gananaa karne par yah samay lagbhag 5100 varsh purv kaa siddh hota he
 Therefore, our planet's planetary system is so ancient
 hamaari janmkundali kii dasha antardashaon ke kram se prabhavit hokar arab deshavaasiyon ne varshafal kii ek nai pranali prarambh kii jise 'tajik' kehete hai
 In this, by taking the lagna of the time of completion of the solar year from the time of birth of the creature, it is considered to be auspicious within a year
 isamen 16 yogon kii pradhanta he jinamein laabh, haani tathaa shaareerik sthiti kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The names of these 16 yogas are in Arabic language, some have been changed according to their names in Sanskrit texts, such as Iqbal Ashraf, Ittasal etc
 vartmaan samay main raashichakr ke baarah bhaag kar janmkundali ke faladesh kii jo pranali prachlit he iskaa ullekh bhaar ke pracheen vaidic sahitya main nahin he
 But Atharva astrology has long since contained the basic elements of this method
 isamen raashichakr ke 27 nakshatron ke nau bhaag karke teen-teen nakshatron kaa ek-ek bhaag mana gaya he
 Among them, the first 'janma Nakshatra', the tenth 'karma Nakshatra' and the nineteenth 'adhan Nakshatra' are considered
 shesh ko kram se sampat, vipat, kshemya, pratvar, sadhak, naidhan, maitra or param maitra mana gaya he, jaise- Among these, Janma, Sampat and Naidhan i
e
 1, 2 and 7, meet the 1st, 2nd and 8th places of the Dwadavaswali horoscope
 atharv jyotish main dasavaan karm nakshatra he
 Even in the modern system, the tenth place is karma
 isse siddh he ki atharv jyotish main nau sthaan vartmaan kundali ke baarah sthanon ke kisi na kisi sthaan main antarbhukt ho jate hai jo mesh aadi sangyaaon ke prachaar main ane ke pehle hi se hamaari faladesh paddati main vidyaman the
 The description of the constellations falling in the east horizon as lagna nakshatra is also described in 3300 year old Vedang astrology
 jaise,- shravishthabhyo gunabhyastan pragvilagnan vinirdishend
 That is, after counting the property three, the constellations in the horizon before the close should be told
 isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki us samay 27 nakshatron main teen teen bhaag karke nakshatra chakra ke nav bhaag kiye gaye the
 The new departments of Atharva astrology harmonize with this
 europea vidwaanon kaa mat he ki nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag yaa baarah rashiyaan bharat main baahar se ai
 But in our Vedic literature, twelve parts of the constellation cycle based on the movement of the Sun and 27 parts based on the daily movement of the Moon have already been done
 yadhyapi hamaare puraanon main jis prakaar nakshatron or chandramaa se sambandhit kathaayen hai, usee prakar meshadi raashiyon kii kathaayen nahin hai kintu greek sahitya main hai
 Even then, it is not proven that the zodiac calculation and sentiment came from outside India
 europea vidwaanon kii hi uktiyaan iske vipareet sakshya de rahi hai
 Jacobi states that in the horoscope, the method of giving fruits from the twelfth houses is found in the book of Pharimicus Maternus
 yahan yah bhi gyatavya he ki tolemi se pehle greece main bhi kisi jataka granth kaa pataa nahin lagata
 The two Jataka texts of Ptolemy are called Almijasti and Titrabiblas but this is not authenticated
 yadi 354 i
 ke baad formikas matternas ke granth kaa prachaar bharat main hua satya maan liya jaay to varahamihir ke purv 250 varshon main 6 arya granthkaar or paanch aarsh granthkaaron kaa hona sambhav nahin prathit hota
 Varahamihira has named his predecessors Maya Yavan, Manittattha, Satya, Vishnugupta etc
 brihajjatak ke tikaakar bhattotpal kaa mat he ki ye vishnugupt chandramaa ke mantri acharya chanakya hai
 In this way, our zodiac calculation method is proved 300 years before AD
 isse yah kathan tathypurna nahin he ki rashigananaa bharat main baahar se ai
 In Brihatsamhita's Grahacharaadhyay, there are visible fruits
 usamen pratham sthaan chandra kaa he
 'mandavya' is mentioned in that chapter
 mandavy aarsh granthkaar hai
 In the Mandavya text, Chandrakundali was the main one or it was considered from the location of the moon
 yah vichaar atharv jyaatish ke 9 sthanon se hota tha
 After 10 zodiacs came into the publicity, it started to be considered with 12 expressions
 at: janmkundali kii paddati garg aadi kisi rishi ne prachlit kii, yah maananaa hi yuktisangat he
 Because in the specific theory existing 500 years before the year, there is an imagery of ascendant and emotions
 bhartiya jyotish main kuch raashiyon or greek naam is baat ke pramaan hai ki unaniyon se hamaara pracheen-sampark tha
 He also exchanged many disciplines and arts
 varahamihir ne likhaa he ki- It should not be concluded from this that all our Jataka Shastra is borrowed
 bhartiya janmkundali kii paddati jaanakar unaniyon ne uskaa vistaar avashya kiya or naveen rup main use varahamihir ke samay main bharatiyon ke sammukh prastut kiya
 As a result, Varahamihira also named the names of zodiac signs along with their new methods like Hora, Dreshanka, such as our algebra today spread across Europe by Arabs and returned to India in its own form and became known as New Mathematics

 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth were included
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand

 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected

 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal

 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it

 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview

 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 India's 65th Independence Day celebrations were held in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would go on a fast
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given
 antat 13 agast ko anna hajaare ne ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di gai to ve jail baro andolan shuru karenge
 He also announced to abandon water
 dilli police ne jepi park main anshan karne kii anumati 22 pratibandhon ke saath di
 Anna Hazare refused to accept 6 of these conditions
 inamen pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya 5000 tak simit rakhane, anshan 3 din tak hi karne, anshan sthal par laudspikar kaa prayog na karne, tent na lagane aadi kii sharten shaamil thim
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the 65th Independence Day celebrations of India, expressed his desire to end corruption on the one hand, but at the same time termed any demonstration for him as unconstitutional
