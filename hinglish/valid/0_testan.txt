 This is the turning point of a Hindi film
 jahaan badalte samaaj ke saath na sirf soch badalati najar aa rahi he balki filmon kii jubaan se lekar kahaniyon kii prishthbhumi or thikaane tak, sab kuch badal chukaa he
 The stories of the changing times are related to the common man
 ab filmon main heroine sirf glamer kii vastu banakar nahin rah gai hai
 The strong image of urban women has begun to appear strongly on the cinematic screen
 bajet se zyada tavajjo kahaniyon ko milane lagi he or kahaniyaan film ke actors se zyada ahm ho gai hai
 For example, 2015 films can be taken when seven of the 10 highest-grossing films of the year (tanu Weds Manu Returns, Pyaar Ka Panchnama-2, Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Piku, Hate Story-3, Badlapur, NH-10) were relatively low budget

 Due to the excellent content coming from Hollywood and regional cinema, the audience is growing in options and their choice is getting stronger

 In 1986 there were young stars like Anil Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Mithun Chakraborty, while senior actors like Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jeetendra and Vinod Khanna were also in the fray
 karma, nagina, naam, jaanbaaj or aakhri rasta jaisi filmein bhi relies ho rahi thim
 By that time there was a phase of single screen cinemas and watching a film was nothing less than a celebration
 abhi tak filmon ko bazaarwaad kii hawa nahin lagi thi
 Art to commercial films were being made
 donon tarah kii filmon ke bich ek badi khai bhi thi
 But in the last three decades this gap has now disappeared

 Similar is the case with Naseeruddin Shah, he has come a long way from parallel cinema to Tridev (1989) and Dedh Ishqiya (2014)
 unhone villen se lekar hero or rangeen mizaaj aashiq jaise alag-alag kirdaaron ko bakhubi anjaam diya he

 The increasing presence of women before and behind the camera in Bollywood ensured that the best stories unfold
 masalan english winglish ko liya ja saktaa he
 "bollywood is called a mirror of society," says Gauri Shinde, director of the film based on the problems faced by a woman in the English language
 lekin mahilaon par filmon kaa aana or unka kaamyaab hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki hamaara samaaj auraton ko lekar puri tarah samvedansheel hone laga he
 Now our society has to go much further to show sensitivity towards women
 abhi jo bhi chal rahaa he vah to shuruyaat bhar he
 Films are also trying to contribute to this
 " gauri kaa kahana sahi bhi he, lekin badlaav dikh rahe hai
 In Bollywood till a decade ago, Aparna Sen (36 Charangi Lane), Sai Paranjpe (chashmebaddur), Tanuja Chandra (tamanna, Dushman and Sangharsh), Kalpana Lajmi (rudali), Deepa Mehta (fire and Earth) and Meera Nair (salaam Bombay, Kamasutra and Monsoon Wedding) names used to come to mind
 lekin 2016 aate-aate isamen jabardast ijapha ho gaya
 Reema Kagti (talaash), Zoya Akhtar (zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), Farah Khan (om Shanti Om), Leena Yadav (pachred), Kiran Rao (dhobi Ghat), Anusha Rizvi (peepli Live), Nandita Das (firaq) and Ashwini There is a long queue of names like Iyer Tiwari (nil Batte Sannata)

 The rise of real life was the decade of 1980s-90 with Angry Youngman and romantic stories
 film kaa hero larger dain life hua karata tha
 As soon as kissing the new century, stories started moving rapidly towards real life
 asal jindagi se jude paatro kii sankhya main ijapha ho gaya
 The concept of villain itself changed
 2016 tak aate-aate filmon kaa cheharaa-mohara hi badal gaya
 The common man returned from films returned
 gaanv kasbon main tabdeel ho gaye
 Half-century life reached the curtain of cinema
 2010 chote shaharon kii filmon ke maamle main nirnaayak rahaa
 It started with Dabangg and Ishqiya, Udaan, Peepli Live, Trapped Ray Obama carried the trend forward
 phir isi bhadesapan ko aage badhaane kaa kaam tanu vaids manu (kanpur), ranjhna (banaras), dam laga ke haisha (haridwar), maanjhiah da mountain main (bihar), gangs of vasepur-1,2 (vasepur), sultan (haryana) or aligarh jaisi filmon ne kiya
 The funny thing is that these small-town films were far from big
 in filmon ke kam bajet ne inhen kamyaabi kaa nayaa formula diya
 "everyone wants to see their story," believes Zeeshan Qadri, the writer-actor of Gangs of Wasseypur
 phir log asal jindagi kii ghatnaayen dekhne ke shaukeen hai
 If you look at a small town or town, you will find surprising stories there

 Such as Sardar Patel, Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi

 In 2007, when Guru came to Dhirubhai Ambani's life, Shahrukh Khan gave Chak! Hockey player Meeranjan Negi was brought alive on the silver screen in India
 yaheen se khel, film or jindagi se jude khaas logon kii jindagi par film banane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Films such as The Dirty Picture (silk Smita's biopic), Paan Singh Tomar (athlete turned dacoit Paan Singh), Bhaag Milkha Bhag (athlete Milkha Singh), Mary Kom (female boxer) and Sarabjit (indian shuttered in Pakistan) Inspired Bollywood to do something new, away from convention
 in filmon kii safalataa ne is baat ko bhi siddh kar diya ki jab ham asal jindagi se asli kahaniyaan le sakate hai to hamen hollywood, kshetreey cinema ke rimek kii kya jarurat he?yahi nahin, filmon main yuva nirdeshkon kaa dakhal bhi badha he
 Ali Abbas Zafar (sultan), Neeraj Ghevan (masan), Puneet Malhotra (I Hate Love Stories), Vikramaditya Motwane (udaan), Abhishek Sharma (tere Bin Laden), Ayan Mukherjee (wake Up Sid), Mohit Suri (ek Villain) , Is also a new generation of directors such as Zoya Akhtar, Vikas Bahl (queen) and Shonali Bose (margrita with Straw), whose stories are completely different and at the same time very appropriate
 badal gai jubanbharat kii kul aabaadi main 15-24 varsh kii aayu ke yuvaaon kii sankhya 35 fisadi he
 In this way, the bullying of youth can be seen in every aspect of films
 cinema main bhi yah baat dikhti he
 Due to the interference of metro culture and technology, the youth have become more aware
 bollywood or usase jude logon ne bhi is baat ko samajha he
 While keeping a multiplex youth oriented approach, the language of Bollywood also took a beating according to the youth
 filmon main hinglish ragon tak utar gai
 In the 1980s–90s, where there was widespread use of Hindustani, it turned into Hinglish after 2010
 bollywood kii filmon ke lagbhag 50 fisadi tital english yaa hinglish main hai, gaanon main bhi angreji ke shabdon kii bharmaar he
 Gulzar believes that the word of the cinema stays with the times

 All are waiting for the counting of votes for the Karnataka assembly elections on Tuesday
 tamaam agsit pole main ek jaisi tasviir nahin aane se sthiti or uljhi he
 Some exit polls show Congress ahead and BJP in some
 jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he to wo karnataka main sirf sarkaar banane kii baat hi nahin kar rahi he, balki apane aantarik survey ke hawaale se 127 siten jeetne kaa daawa bhi kar rahi he
 However, the Congress has also kept itself ready for every situation
 congress har surat main karnataka ke kile ko apane paas hi barkaraar rakhana chaahati he
 The party has prepared three plans for this and if all three fail then JDS would prefer to sit in the opposition instead of supporting the Chief Minister
 karnataka is baar goa or meghalaya kii galati nahin doharaana chaahati
 Congress's plan 'A' The first plan of the party is so simple that if Congress gets majority then Siddaramaiah should become CM
 is surat main siddharmaiya ke us bayaan ke koi myne nahin hai ki jarurat padi to party se kisi dalit ko siem banane ke liye ve khud peeche hat jaaenge
 After all, Siddaramaiah is the first choice for CM of both Congress and party president Rahul Gandhi
 saath hi party ne unako siem ke chehre ke taur bhi pehle se hi pesh kiya hua he
 Congress' Plan 'B' If the Congress stays on 105 seats while staying away from the majority, then Siddaramaiah has given confidence to the party even in such a situation
 siddharmaiya ke mutabik iske liye ve nirdaleey, gaiyr bijepi or gaiyr jedies vidhayakon kaa saath juta lenge
 Congress' plan 'C' If the Congress remains far from the majority, then at all costs it will try to keep the BJP away from power
 congress ke liye sabase ahm yahi teesraa plan he
 That is, if the Congress stays away from the majority, then the JDS can form a government
 aisi surat main party jedies ko saath laane kii koshish karegi
 But it is certain that the Congress will not give the Chief Minister's chair to the JDS at all
 udhar jedies kii ore se mukhyamantri ke liye siddharmaiya ke naam par raji hone kii sambhaavna naa ke baraabar hoga
 The JDS has not forgotten how Siddaramaiah had broken the JDS and held the Congress in the past
 aisi surat main congress siddharmaiya kii jagah party ke kisi dalit chehre ko siem ke taur par pesh kar degi
 Will Rahul lead the Lok Sabha? If this happens then the Karnataka Congress President
 parameshwar yaa loksabhaa main party ke netaa mallikarjun khadge siem ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 By the way, the discussion in the party is also that, in the changed circumstances, if Kharge had to be sent as CM, Rahul himself can take the position of the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha
 lekin ye sab abhi bhavishya ke adhar main hai
 In terms of strategy, the party's general secretary in-charge KC Venugopal and in-charge secretary Madhu Gaur Yakshi have been posted in the state
 inke alaava siyaasi ghamaasan or aankadon ke ganit ko saadhane ke liye rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or party ke sanghathan mahasachiv ashok gahalot ko congress alaakaman ne khaas taur par dilli se bheja he
 The party fears that events like Goa and Meghalaya may not be repeated in Karnataka
 goa or meghalaya main bijepi kaa chunaav uparaant management congress par baari padaa tha or usne sarkaar banane main kamyaabi pai thi
 Congress leaders are not speaking openly about the plan 'C', but on the question of coordination with JDS, party leader RPN Singh said that, our government is being formed in Karnataka, even if JDS is with us in the name of secular solidarity If she comes then she is welcome
 sutron ke mutabik, congress kii puri koshish jedies ko bijepi ke saath jane se rokane kii hogi
 Sources reveal that the Congress will also explain to the JDS how the BJP treats its allies in the NDA
 iske liye party shivasena or chandrababu naidu kii telegu desham kaa hawala de sakati he
 Even Congress can give the example of Nitish Kumar
 sutron ke mutabik congress jedies ko ye bhi bataaegi ki aane vaale kal main bijepi uske vidhayak tod bhi sakati he
 On the other hand, the Congress will form an alliance of big secular parties for 2019, in which there will be space for JDS to join hands
 lekin bijepi ke saath jane kii surat main jedies ko bijepi or uske matadaataaon kaa hi mohataaj rahanaa hoga, kyonki tab alpsankhyak or secular vot jedies se dur ho jaaenge

 ) Setting the tone of a historic electoral battle in Uttar Pradesh for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav has announced that his alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party is fixed and the two parties will jointly fight the 2019 election battle
 'ajtak' ke saath exclusive intervyuu main akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki donon partiyon kii pehali praathamikta narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bijepi ko haraana he
 Akhilesh, sitting at his residence on Vikramaditya Marg, Lucknow, one kilometer from the Chief Minister's residence, also took a jibe at Yogi Adityanath, who replaced Akhilesh on the Chief Minister's chair
 unhone kaha, 'upi kii janata ne unako vot nahin diya tha
 People had voted in the name of Narendra Modi
 pradhanmantri ko chahie tha ki ve soobe ko ek acha mukhyamantri dete
 There is no justice in UP
 yogiji zyaadaatar dharmik kriyakalapon najar aate hai
 He may be a good monk, but not a good chief minister
 'akhilesh ne bataaya upachunaav main kaise hua 'gathbandhan'samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh ne pehali baar gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke liye parde ke peeche hui jod tod kii kahani bataate hue kaha ki party netaa gathbandhan chaahate the, saath hi kader or voter bhi donon partiyon ke gathbandhan ke paksh main the
 He said, 'first thing started through the back channel and then i talked to Mayawatiji over the phone
 phir hamane congress ke nimantran par dilli main baithak ke dauraan ek saath ek hi teble par khaanaa khaaya, jahaan bahut sari baaten huin, jisko bataanaa jaruri nahin he
 Because BJP is a very clever party
 'basapa ke saath apni pichhali kadavaahaton ko bhulane ke sawaal par akhilesh ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party kii sthapana mulaayam singh yadav ne kii thi, lekin ab yah ek nai party he
 We must forget our previous history to strengthen the alliance
 bataa den ki 2 june 1995 ke kukhyat guest house cond ke baad sapa or basapa ke rishte kabhi bhi sahaj nahin rahe
 After the Babri Masjid demolition scandal in 1993, there was an alliance between Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh to stop the BJP and both the parties captured the power of UP
 'mulaayam ke jod tod se tutaa basapa-sapa gathbandhan'haalanki donon partiyon kaa gathbandhan sahaj nahin rahaa, mulaayam ne basapa ke vidhayakon ko todakar apane sahyogi ko kamjor karne kii koshish kii
 Here the BJP intervened and helped place Mayawati in the chief minister's chair
 iske baad se bhartiya raajnneeti main sapa or basapa ek duusare ke kattar virdohi rahe hai
 However, after defeating the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly elections, the two parties decided to come together for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections in 2018
 upachunaavon main basapa ne koi ummidavaar nahin khadaa kiya or sapa ke ummidavaar ko apana samarthan kiya
 The result was in favor of SP and both parties together embarrassed BJP
 samarthan ke liye mayawati kaa aabhaar jataane gaye the akhileshupachunaav nattejey ke baad akhilesh khud chalakar mayawati ke awaas par unhen dhanyavad karne pahunche the, jahaan donon netaaon ke bich kareeb ghante bhar tak baatcheet chali thi
 Akhilesh said, 'in that meeting we discussed about future strategy
 main bahut zyada to nahin bataa saktaa, lekin hamane ek saath chunaav ladane kii aavashyaktaa par charchaa kii
 Akhilesh also said that in the coming Legislative Council elections, the SP will support the BSP candidate
 isse pehle sapa ne rajyasabha chunaav main basapa ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin bijepi kaa ummidavaar jeetne main safal rahaa
 Mutual consent in the Lok Sabha elections will be more difficult than contesting the two seats of the by-election and it will be more difficult to implement in the 2022 assembly elections, as the two leaders will be fighting for the Chief Minister's chair then
 is sawaal ke jawaab main akhilesh ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav abhi bahut zyada dur he
 Our first priority is the Lok Sabha elections right now
 akhilesh ne yah bhi kaha ki netaji mulaayam singh yadav ne sapa or basapa ke gathbandhan ko apana aashirwad diya he
 On the question of 'friendship with Congress, decision on alliance later' with Congress against all parties against BJP in UP, Akhilesh said that our friendship with Congress will continue, but the alliance will be discussed later
 unhone kaha loksabhaa upachunaav kii donon siton par congress kaa koi janaadhar nahin he, lekin unhone bina kisi charchaa ke donon siton par ummidavaar utaare
 On Rahul Gandhi's temple tour in Gujarat and now Karnataka, Akhilesh said that there is a temple in my house
 meri patni har roj puja karti hai
 One can go anywhere before the elections
 lekin chunaavon ke samay aisa kuch bhi nahin kiya janaa chahie jisase raajnneetik muddon se logon kaa bhatkaav ho
 Indicating about the role of Congress in 2019, Akhilesh said that the agreement that parties like TMC and TDP are trying for, we have their support
 lekin ek prabhavi gathbandhan ke liye jaruri he ki jin rajyon main kshetreey partiyaan majboot hai, vahaan anya partiyon (jaise congress) ko unka samarthan karnaa chahie
 Reacting to the Unnao rape case, Chief Minister Akhilesh said that it is a sad incident
 peedita vidhayak par aarope laga rahi he or sarkaar-police use bachaane main lagi hai
 The Chief Minister should take strong action on this, but the kind of sympathy shown by the DGP towards the MLA indicates the injustice done to the victim

 Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal said that if the Jan Lokpal Bill of Gandhian Anna Hazare is accepted, it will paralyze the judiciary and the executive

 Sibal said, the Prime Minister's Office is the main center of our parliamentary democracy
 ek swatantra lekin nirankush janalokapal puri vyavastha ko buree tarah asthir kar saktaa he
 The Lokpal can do an inquiry against the Prime Minister only to find out whether the allegations against him are baseless
 isse sansadeey loktantr ko thes pahonchegi
 He said that the Prime Minister is not exempt from prosecution under the existing system
 kisi maamle main agar tathy saarvajanik daayre main hon to vyavastha kisi bhrasht vyakti ko pradhanmantri pad par nahin bane rahane de sakati
 In the second episode of his article released through the Press Information Office, Sibal said that it would be a historic mistake to weaken the Prime Minister's institution amidst the volatile neighborhood and the real threat of terrorism

 The Samajwadi Party (SP) paid 12,000 to the unemployed every year
 berogari bhatta dene kaa vaada kiya he
 After the economic reforms, due to increasing opportunities in the private sector and lack of special recruitment in government jobs, the activities of these offices were reduced considerably and its employees became unemployed
 ek din main kuch hi panjikaran hote the lekin aaj haalat yah he ki ab ginati hajaar kaa aankada paar kar rahi he
 The promises of political parties have given employment to officers and employees of employment offices
 is baar kaa vidhansabha chunaav pradesh ke beete chunaavon kii tulana main alag is lihaaj se bhi tha ki isamen pehali baar dedh karod nae or kul 4 karod yuva matadaataaon ne hissaa liya
 In such a situation, it was imperative for all political parties to draw these youths towards themselves
 isi ke chalate sapa ne sabase pehle apane ghoshnaptr main berozegaar yuvaaon ko bhatta dene kii baat kahi
 The party, in its manifesto, paid 12,000 to unemployed youth
 salanaa berogari bhatta dene kii baat kahi
 Then what was left

 After the Samajwadi Party got a majority, the hopes of unemployed youth have got wings

 The scheme of giving unemployment allowance per month was started
 isane yuvaaon ko khaasaa aakarshith kiya tha or varsh 2007 ke shuruaati maheenon main pradesh ke sabhi sevaayojan karyaalayon main panjikrut yuvaaon kii sankhya 34 lakh tak pahunch gai thi
 The plan would have been completely overcome by the fact that the assembly elections were announced during this period and the Mayawati government of the Bahujan Samaj Party, which was formed after this, stopped the unemployment allowance
 iskaa asar pradesh ke sevaayojan karyaalayon main hone vaale panjikaran par bhi padaa
 The unemployed did not take any interest in renewing their registration and in the year 2010 the total number of registered unemployed in the state had fallen to 19 lakhs
 is baar ke chunaav main jis prakaar se sapa ne berogari bhatta dene kaa vaada kiya he usne ek baar phir sevaayojan karyaalayon main bheed badha di he
 Often unemployed young men and women used to come in search of jobs, but after years of waiting, they felt disappointed
 lekin is baar berozegaar yuva bhatte kii aas main bhi sevaayojan karyaalayon kaa rukh karne lage hai
 During the year 2011, on an average, 40 to 50 unemployed youths went to the registration office in Lalbagh, Lucknow
 janvari, 2011 se disambar, 2011 tak kul panjikrut berozegaron kii sankhya 18,163 thi
 At the same time, the registration number has crossed 20,000 in the first two months of this year

 According to these certificates, the unemployed are classified according to their qualifications and according to this they are provided with the available job information
 chunaav ke baad yadi sarkaar berozegaron kii jaankaree maangegi, to vah bhi muhaiyaa kara di jaaegi
 Most of the unemployed coming to the employment office are registering for unemployment allowance

 Regional Employment Officer of the place, Shasibhushan Singh, says that there was a rush in September last year when around 8,000 candidates ran for the teacher eligibility test
 lekin is baar farvari main hi 1,25,000 se adhik panjikaran ho chuke hai
 In Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia districts, the officers and employees of the employment office do not have any time to breathe
 yahaan par har roj 300-500 berozegaar panjikaran ke liye pahunch rahe hai
 Seeing the unemployed fighting for the registration form, some people have also found employment in it

 Senior SP leader and state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary disagrees with him

 Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari termed the promises like unemployment allowance as an electoral hang-up and says that the state does not have enough resources to give allowance to all unemployed
 tiwari kehete hai, ‘berozegaron ko bhatta dene kii bajaae unhen rojgaar ke laayak bananaa zyada jaruri he
 Economists and politicians may differ on the rationale of unemployment allowance, but the cycle of sp's expectation has also raised hopes of unemployed youth
 ab baari netaaon kii he ki ve ise na keval puraa karen balki barkaraar rakhen
 They should also understand that the real need of the youth is employment and not an allowance

 He has scored 517 runs for seven wickets in the innings
 barish ke kaaran duusare din sirf 30
 a 4-over game was possible
 kharaab roshni ke kaaran khel roke jane tak smith ne 231 gendon par 21 chaukon ke saath naabad laute jabaki mishael johnson ne abhi khaataa nahin kholaa he
 Clarke's wicket fell on the second ball of the 120th over of the innings thrown by Karn Sharma
 australia ne clark kaa wicket girane ke baad sirf chaar gendon kaa saamana kiya
 Clarke sent the ball out of the boundary line 18 times in his 163-ball innings
 clark pehle din 60 ke nijee yoga par ritred hart hue the, lekin buudhvaar ko vah har tarah ke shots khelte vakt kaaphi sahaj dikhe
 Clarke shared a 163-run partnership with Smith for the seventh wicket
 pehla din agar david warner (145) ke naam rahaa tha to doosraa din captain clark or khaskar smith ke naam rahaa, jinhone apane kariyar kaa paanchvaan shatak lagaaya
 Along with this, he also established his biggest personal yoga till date
 duusari ore, captain clark ne 28waan shatak puraa kiya
 Clarke averages over 100 in the Adelaide over
 unhone apni is pratishtha ko kaayam rakhte hue kuch behtareen shots lagaae or pehle din se hi kharaab gendbaaji tathaa lachar kshetrarakshan kar rahi bhartiya team ko lagaataar niraash kiya
 Leg-spinner Karn Sharma, playing his first Test match for India, has taken two wickets
 din kaa ekmaatr wicket karn ke hi naam rahaa
 Karna has described his performance as meaningful in this match by taking two important wickets in the form of Warner and Clarke
 barish ke kaaran duusare din kaa khel buree tarah prabhavit hua
 Meals, teas, and even daytime games were finished before the scheduled time
 pehle satr main sirf 12
 2 overs could be bowled, while in the second session only 11 balls could be bowled
 tisare satr main 16
 The game of 3 overs was possible
 ab tisare din kaa khel nirdhaarit samay se lagbhag aadhe ghante pehle shuru hoga or baaki ke dinon main bhi sambhavat: aisa hi hoga kyonki jo 60 over ke khel kaa samay jaaya hua he, uski bharpai jaruri he

 Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said on Saturday that he was laughing at the response given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a statement he had never given
 saath hi, apane bare main 'clerk' sambandhi bayaan par unhen hansi aa rahi he
 Kumaraswamy tweeted, "I am laughing at the response given by the venerable Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a statement that i had never given," Kumaraswamy made it clear that he had never made such a statement
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon ke rin ke baad yah doosraa mauka he, jab vah (modi) juthi soochna / bayaan par pratikriya jaahir kar rahe hai
 Such statements will not affect the development agenda of our (coalition) government
 gauratlab he ki rajya main krishi karj maafee par modi ne pichley maheene kaha tha ki lollypop thamaya gaya he
 At the same time, during the bjp's National Council meeting in New Delhi on Saturday, Prime Minister Modi referred to an alleged statement of Kumaraswamy, which was about working like his clerk
 modi ne kaha, ‘‘abhi kuch hi maheene hue hai, lekin vah (kumaraswami) itane chintit hai ki vah kah rahe hai ki mukhyamantri (kii tarah bartaav kiye jane) ke bajaay unke saath clerk jaisaa vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to media reports, Kumaraswamy had told him at a recent meeting of party mlas that he was acting under pressure
 khabaron main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki mukhyamantri ne vidhayakon se kaha ki vah ek clerk kii tarah kaam kar rahe hai or jedies ke saath gathbandhan main saajhedaar congress par dakhlandaji kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Reacting to the Prime Minister's comments, JDS supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda said, "so will he appreciate and not criticize the coalition government?" He said that no one should speak lightly about anyone
 is bich, pradesh congress ne kannada main twit kar modi par prahaar karte hue kaha, ‘‘aadarneey narendra modi aapane loktantric rup se nirvaachit sarkaar ke mukhyamantri ko ek clerk kaha
 At the same time, Karnataka BJP leaders Prahlad Joshi and Jagdish Shettar defended Modi's remarks saying that he was only quoting Kumaraswamy
 (bhashaa se input) The top Democrat MP for the Internal Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said that this horrific attack reminds that America must always be vigilant against threats against terrorism
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah mahatvapurn he ki sangheey, rajya or sthaneey kanoon lagu karne vaale adhikari milakar kaam karen
 '' kargil yuddh par pakistan ke purv sena adhikari ne bada khulaasa kiya he
 Retired Lt Gen Shahid Aziz of Pakistan has revealed that Kargil was the biggest mistake of Pervez Musharraf and Pakistani army personnel were involved in this infiltration
 ab tak pakistan ye kahata rahaa he ki kargil main hamalaa karne vaale aatankwaadi the
 And there were some taped wireless messages that could not mislead anyone
 shahid ajij kargil yuddh ke vakt iesai kii analysis wing ke pramukh the
 Nawaz Sharif was also aware of the operation of the former Pakistan Army officer, although the Pakistani army did not know much about it
 paak fouj ke purv adhikari ne yah bhi khulaasa kiya ki kargil main ghuspaith karne kaa makasad bharat ko siachin se bedakhal karnaa tha
 It seems that the pressure is being pressured by the Sangh Parivar to make bjp's Prime Minister candidate for the next election
 vishwa hindu parishad ne is pad ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne kii maang kii he
 However, NDA constituents like JDU have indicated that Modi's name is not acceptable to them
 pichley hafte rashtriya swayan sevak sangh va bijepi ke sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat ke baad vihip netaa ashok singhl ne ravivaar ko khulkar kaha ki party ko modi kaa naam pradhanmantri pratyaashee ke liye ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Singhal said, 'if people are themselves demanding that Modi should be made the Prime Ministerial candidate, then BJP should also think about it
 is tarah kii baat pehali baar ho rahi he
 After all, the BJP president himself has said that Modi is the most popular leader at the moment
 ’is baat kii khabaren hai ki vihip or sangh parivaar se sambandhit kuch hindu dharmik samooh elahabaad main chal rahe kumbh meley main paanch-chah farvari ko hone vaale sammelan main modi kii ummidavaari ke bare main kuch vichaar vimarsh kar sakate hai
 BJP President Rajnath Singh's proposed visit to the Kumbh Mela on 6 February has heated up the rumor market
 baharhaal, rajnath singh ne kaha ki vah is prakaar ke kisi ghatnakram se avgat nahin hai tathaa vah pavitra snaan ke liye elahabaad ja rahe hai
 Sources said that Modi may also visit Kumbh, but the program has not been finalized yet
 bijepi sutron ne in khabaron se inkaar kiya ki party bahut jald modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee ghoshit kar sakati he
 nda's constituent JDU has raised strong objections to these rumors
 jediu pravaktaa shivanand tiwari ne kaha, ‘koun pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banegaa yaa koun sa raajnneetik dal kiske netritv main chunaav ladega, yah raajnneetik dal tay karte hai
 i do not understand how this decision can be made by the sadhus or religious quarters
 ham apni raajnneeti ko kahaan le ja rahe hai
 If the religious leaders decide it, then it is complete bankruptcy
 ’ The Rohtak police have registered a case against Haryana Minister of State for Cooperatives Manish Grover for allegedly making criminal threats and using their influence unnecessarily during the Lok Sabha elections

 Blacksmiths are historyheaters
 unhone bataaya ki donon vyaktiyon ke khilaaf sambandhit dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The police action came after a court here issued a notice against Shivaji Nagar police station in-charge Dilbag Singh

 These people created chaos there and they threatened voters with the intention of occupying the booth

 In the complaint, Phogat alleged that Grover and blacksmith had also threatened him to inform the police

 band hone kii kagaar par khadi jet airways ko sanjivani dene ke liye karmchaariyon kii koshish jari he
 In fact, the airline employees have claimed to raise funds of Rs 7,000 crore in the coming days
 karmchaariyon ke samooh ne esbiai (bhartiya state bank) ko patr likhakar karmchaariyon or bahari niveshkon ke sangh ko company ke prabandhan niyantran ke liye boli lagane kii anumati maangi he
 Explain that currently the control of Jet Airways is with the group of banks headed by SBI
 airline kii payalton-ejiniyaron kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale sosayadi for welfare aaf indian payalts (esdablyooypi) or jet aircraft mentanence ejiniers welfare association (jeeemaivie) ne esbiai ke chairman rajnish kumaar ko patr likhakar airline kaa parichaalan apane haath main lene kaa prastaav kiya he
 These unions say they can manage Rs 7,000 crore for the airline's operations
 esdablyooypi ke sadasyon kii sankhya 800 he jabaki jeeemaivie ke sadasyon kii sankhya kareeb 500 he
 This is the first time employees have come up with a proposal to operate a 25-year-old airline
 lekin sawaal he ki karmchaaree kaise 7 hajaar karod rupee kaa intjaam kaise karenge
 In this letter, the union has stated that according to our initial estimate, the income from the five-year employee share ownership program (ISOP) will be Rs 4,000 crore
 iske alaava bahari niveshkon se bhi kareeb 3,000 karod rupee kaa nivesh jutaya ja saktaa he
 The loan of Rs 8500 crore should be reported that the airline temporarily stopped services from 17 April after Jet Airways lenders raised their emergency funds
 vartmaan main airline 8,500 karod rupee se adhik ke karj main dubi hui he
 Because of this, other employees including Jet Airways pilots have not been making salary for many months
 company main kareeb 22,000 karmchaaree hai
 Of these, around 16,000 employees are on the company's payroll and 6 thousand are on contract
 haalanki jet airways ke karmchaariyon ke liye There are many couples who say that their relationship deteriorated after marriage or else there was a lot of love and good understanding between them
 lekin aisa kehane waalon ne shaayad kabhi iske kaarnon ko jaanane kii koshish kii ho
 Many times it happens that the reason for mutual conflict is very small but it is ignored and it gets bigger
 is baat se to koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa kishaadi se pehle or shaadi ke baad, rishton main kaaphi badlaav aa jaataa he
 However, if everything is handled wisely, then these troubles can also be handled very comfortably
 shaadi ke baad sambandhon main badlaav aa jaataa he
 Things which your partner used to take as a joke till some time suddenly, the same things become serious
 aise main khaas dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 Especially right after marriage
 aise main bhuulakar bhi shaadi ke baad in baton kaa zikr apane partner se na karen:1
 Marriage expenses are incurred in marriage but it is not right to raise a dispute about the same thing everyday
 2
 Do not forget to make fun of relatives
 na to ladke ko ladki ke gharavaalon kaa majaak bananaa chahie or na hi ladki ko ladke ke gharavaalon va rishtedaaron ko lekar kisi tarah kii aapattijanak pratikriya deni chahie
 3
 purv premi ke saath tulanaaisa to bilkul bhi nahin karnaa chahie
 You have just been married and this comparative attitude of yours can cause trouble for your married life
 4
 Doing evil of friends, it can prove to be dangerous for you to do evil of his friends over and over again on any single incident of marriage
 5
 Many times girls say that this is your business, so you should do it
 yah sahi he ki jiskaa kaam ho use hi karnaa chahie lekin is baat ko maanakar chalanaa chahie ki ab aap donon pati-patni hai or aapako puri jindagi saath bitaani he
 Without the help of each other, it will be very difficult to walk together
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz sharif kaa aatanki burhan vaani ko kashmiri andolan kaa netaa bataaya janaa kadi aalochanaayen bator rahaa he
 On Thursday, BJP leader Ram Madhav said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is talking like the Supreme Commander of Hizbul Mujahideen
 sanyukt raashtra main pakistan piem ne sabase bure avatar main the, vah pakistan ke pramukh kii tarah nahin hijbul mujahiddeen ke supreme commander kii tarah baat kar rahe the
 
 vah khuleam ek aatanki commander burhan vaani kii tarafdaari kar rahe the
 Ram Madhav, who represented the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir, said that the whole country is angry with Sharif's speech in which he also raised the issue of recent demonstrations in Kashmir
 udhar congress netaa shashi tharur ne kaha ki 'nawaz sharif niraash karte ja rahe hai
 The man who welcomed the PM on his birthday is now praising Burhan Wani
 ' tharur ne kaha ki isse yah baat sabit hoti he ki hamen in mahashay (paak piem) se baatcheet main vakt jaaya nahin karnaa chahie
 We should look at other aspects of Pakistan
 tippaniyan At the same time, India's Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar said that he is completely denying the 'role of Pakistan in the Uri attack' and the glorification of terrorist Burhan Wani reflects Pakistan's involvement with terrorism
 burhan vaani ko netaa bataanaa sharmnaak he or aatanki kii tarif se bharat hairaan he
 Akbar said, 'we heard the glorification of a terrorist
 vaani hijbul kaa ghoshit commander tha, jise aatanki samooh ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 It is surprising that the leader of a nation can glorify a self-propagating terrorist on such a platform
 yah pakistani pradhanmantri dwaara aatm doshaaropan he
 ' vahiin pakistan dwaara atirikt kadam uthaate hue baatcheet ke liye lagaataar koshishon ke navaj sharif ke daawey par akbar ne kaha, 'hamen pehla kadam hi nahin dikhaa, phir atirikt kadam kaa sawaal kahaan aata he?' unhone saath hi kaha ki pakistan 'apane ek haath main bandook thamkar' baatcheet karnaa chahta he
 Both dialogue and violence cannot go hand in hand
 sanyukt raashtra main pakistan piem ne sabase bure avatar main the, vah pakistan ke pramukh kii tarah nahin hijbul mujahiddeen ke supreme commander kii tarah baat kar rahe the
