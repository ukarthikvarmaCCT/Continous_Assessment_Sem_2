 Valentines Day or Saint Valentines Day, is a holiday day celebrated on February 14 by many people worldwide
 angreji bolne vaale deshon main, ye ek paaramparik diwas he, jisamen premi ek duusare ke prati apane prem kaa izhaar vailemtine card bhejkar, phool dekar, yaa mithai aadi dekar karte hai
 The holiday is named after two of the many early Christian martyrs, named Valentines, in the high Middle Ages, when the tradition of civilized love was growing, Geoffrey Chaucer's day became associated with romantic love
 
 ye din prem patron ke "vailemtine" ke rup main parsparik aadan pradaan ke saath gahare se judaa hua he
 Modern valentine symbols include heart-shaped motifs, pigeons and winged cupids
 Since the 19th century, handwritten notes have been replaced by large-scale greeting cards
 great britain main unnisvin shatabdi main vailemtine kaa bheja janaa ek fishan tha or, 1847 main, astor holand ne apane vorcester, maissachusets sthit ghar main british modelon par aadhaarit ghar main hi bane cards dwaara ek safal vyavsaay viksit kar liya tha
 The popularity of valentine cards in 19th-century America has been where many valentine cards are now a precursor to the future commercialization of holidays in the United States, rather than the usual greeting card love declarations
 america ne greeting card association kaa anumaan he ki lagbhag ek arab vailemtine har saal puri duniya main bheje jate hai, jiske kaaran,christmas ke baad, is chuttee ko card bhejne vaale duusare sabase bade diwas ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The association estimates that on average, men in the US spend twice as much money than women
 kai shuruaati chrishchiyan shaheedon ke naam vailemtine the
 By 1969, the Catholic Church formally recognized eleven Valentine's days
 14 farvari ko sammanit vailemtine hai rome ke veletin valentinus presb
m
 rome) or terney ke vailemtine 
 rome ke vailemtine rome ke ek padri the jinako lagbhag 269 AD main shahadat mili or vaaya fleminiya main unhen dafnaaya gaya tha
 His remains are in St
 Praxed Church in Rome and Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland
 terani ke vailemtine AD 197 main interaamana ke bishap bane or kaha jaataa he ki aurilian samraat ke utpedan ke dauraan unki hatya kii gayi thi
 They are also buried in Via Flaminia, but the place of burial is different from Rome's Valentines
 uske avshesh terney main sant vailemtine ke basilica par hai
 The Catholic Encyclopedia also mentions a third saint named Valentin and who appears within the date of 14 February in the earliest martyrs
 unki shahadat africa main apane anekon saathiyon ke saath hui thi, lekin unke bare main zyada kuch pataa nahin he
 There is no mention of romantic elements in the early original medieval biographies of any of these martyrs
 jis samay tak ek saint vailemtine kaa sambandh chaudaavin sadi main prem ke saath judata, rome ke vailemtine or terani ke vailemtine ke bich ke bhed bilkul kho gaye
 In the 1969 revision of the Roman Catholic calendar of the current saints, the feast day of Saint Valentin was removed from the General Roman calendar on February 14 and placed in specific calendars for the following reasons: Although the memorabilia of St
 Valentin is ancient, it is left to specific calendars Given, because, apart from his name, nothing is known about St
 Valentin except that of Via Flemin Or 14 February was buried in
 fist de aaj bhi balzan main manaaya jaataa he jahaan aisa daawa kiya jaataa he ki saint ke avshesh mili hai or puri duniya main bhi un paramparawaadi catholicon ke dwaara manaaya jaataa he jo puraane pre- vatican II calendar ko maanate hai
 The early medieval Acta was cited by Bead and briefly lectured in the Legenda Oria
 us sanskaran ke anusaar, saint vailemtine kaa chrishchiyan ke naate utpedan kiya gaya tha or rome ke samraat claudius II ke dwaara vyaktigat rup se puch tachh kii gayi thi
 Claudius was influenced by Valentin and discussed with him, trying to convert him to Roman Paganism so that his life could be saved
 vailemtine se inkaar kar diya or ulta koshish kii ki clodius chrischian ban jaye
is vajah se, use maar daalaa gaya tha
 It is said that before he was killed, he performed a miracle to cure the blind daughter of the jailer
 leganda oriya abhi bhi prem ke saath koi sambandh nahin jod paa rahi thi, isliye dantakthaon ko aadhunik samay main jod diya gaya
 These depict Valentin as a clergyman who refused to obey a law of the Roman emperor Claudius II that mandated young boys not to marry
 samraat ne sambhawatah aisa apni sena badhaane ke liye kiya hoga, uskaa ye vishwaas rahaa hoga kii shaadishuda ladke achche sipaahi nahin hote hai
 Pastor Valentin meanwhile secretly got marriages of young people
 jab clodius ko is bare main pataa chalaa, usne vailemtine ko giraftaar karwaakar jail main phenk diya
 a few other stories were added to further embellish this beautiful legend
 maare jane se ek shaam pehle, unhone pehla "vailemtine" swayan likhaa, us yuvati ke naam jise unki premika mana jaataa tha
 This young woman was the daughter of the jailer whom he cured and later became friends
 ye ek note tha jisamen likhaa hua tha "tumhaare vailemtine ke dwaara" One such day was celebrated in ancient Persia even before Valentines day
 ise prem or premiyon ke diwas ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 Although the prevailing modern sources link the unspecified greco-roman Farbury holidays, which were said to be devoted to fertility and love, to St
 Valentin, Professor Jack Oruch, of the University of Kansas, argued that before Chaucer
 , There was no relation between the romantic love and the saint named Valentinus
 pracheen ethinian calendar ke anusaar, madhya janvari or madhya farvari ke bich kaa samay gamelian kaa mahina tha, ye samarpit tha jiyas or haara kii pavitra shaadi ko
 In ancient Rome, Lupercalia, celebrated from February 13 to 15, was an ancient custom associated with fertility
 luperkelia rome shahar kaa ek sthaneey tyohaar tha
 The festival of Juno Fabrua, meaning "purifying juno" or "chest juno", was celebrated on February 13–14
 pope gelasias i ne luperkelia ko samaapt kar diya
 It is generally believed that the Christian Church decided to celebrate Valentine's Feast Day in mid-february so that Pagan Lupercalia could be Christianized
 roman catholic carch gahare based luparkelia tyohaar ko samaapt nahin kar sakaa, isliye carch ne ek diwas virgin meri ke sammaan ke liye surakshit kar diya
 Although some claim that Valentine's Day's relationship with love is recorded for the first time in Geoffrey Chaucer's Parliament of Fouls, it may also be the result of an incorrect translation
 chausar ne likhaa he: For this was on Saint Volantyny's Day, and your brother, Komath Tere to Chess His Make
 ye kavita england ke raja richard II kii bohemia kii ain sesagai kii pehali varshganth ke sammaan main likhi gayi thi
 a treaty for marriage was signed on 2 May 1381
 pathakon dwaara bina tark kiye ye maan liya gaya ki chausar 14 farvari ko vailemtine diwas ke rup main ingit kar rahaa he; haalaanki, madhya farvari england main chidion ke prajnan ke liye ek uchit samay nahin he
 Henry Ensiger Kelley pointed out that in the liturgical calendar, May 2 is the saint's day for Genoa's valentines
 yah saint vailemtine genova kaa ek shuruaati bishap tha jiskaa 307 i
 ke aasapaas kaa nidhan hua
 The story of Chaucer's Parliament of Falls is in a fictional context of an old tradition, but in reality there was no such tradition before Chaucer
 bhaavnaatmak prathaon ke anumaanit vivaran ko aitihaasik tathyon ki tarah pesh karnaa, isaki utpatti atharahavi sadi ke itihaaskaaron dwaara hui thi, jaise ki alban butler, batlers livs of cents ke lekhak or is pratha ko aadhunik vidwaanon dwaara bhi jari rakhaa gaya he
 Most notable, "the idea that the Valentine's Day practice was due to Roman Lupercalia has been accepted without any argument and has been repeated in many ways even today
 sabhy prem ke rivaajon ke liye adalati bhashaa ke istemaal karte hue ek "prem ke ucch nyaayalay" kii sthapana paris main 1400 main vailemtine diwas par kii gayi
 This court dealt with contracts of love, cheating and violence against women

 a fifteenth-century present written by Charles, Duke of Orléans, for his "valentine" wife, is the earliest valentine work left
 us samay duk ko agincourt kii ladai,1415 main pakde jane ke baad landan ke tower main rakhaa gaya tha
 The mention of Valentine's Day comes with a sigh of regret by Ophelia in Hamlet
 satrahavin sadi ke aane tak hastnirmit card bade or vistrut hote the, jabaki dukaan se khride gaye card chote or manhage hote the
 In 1797, a British publisher released a valentine writer of youths, suggesting many sentimental verses for young lovers who could not make their own
 chhapakaron ne chhandon or chitron vaale card, jinhen "yantric vailemtine" kaha jaataa tha, kaa simit maatra main utpaadan bhi shuru kar diya tha
 And in the next century, the reduction in postage rates gave rise to the easy but less private practice of sending Valentines by post
 isane pehali baar gumnaam rup se cardon ke aadan pradaan ko sambhav bana diya
 In an era that was purely Victorian, this is believed to be the reason for the sudden appearance of caste verses
 chunki kaagaj ke vailemtine england main 1800 main ati prachlit the, isliye inako kaarkaanon main banaaya jane laga
 Beautiful valentines were created with the help of real lace and ribbon
 madhya 1800 ke aasapaas kaagaj ke feeton kaa prachlan shuru hua
 The Valentine's Day rediscover in 1840 is traced by Lee Eric Schmidt

 ' yah ek bahuarthi shabd he
 a computer virus or computer virus is a computer program that can duplicate itself and infect a computer without the user's permission, and the user is not even aware of it
 vibhinn prakaar ke mailaware or adware programs ke sandarbh main bhi "virus" shabd kaa upyog saamaanya rup se hota he, haalaanki yah kabhi-kabhi galati se bhi hota he
 The original virus can make changes in duplicates, or the duplicates themselves can make changes, as in a transformed virus
 ek virus ek computer se duusare computer main tabhi fail saktaa he jab iskaa host ek asankramit computer main laayaa jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek upyogkarta ke dwaara ise ek network yaa internet par bhejne se, yaa ise hathaaye jane yogya madhyam jaise flopy discs, CD, yaa USB drive par laane se
 isi ke saath virus ek aise sanchika tantra yaa jaal sanchika pramali par sankramit sanchikaon ke dwaara duusare computaron par fail saktaa he jo duusare computaron par bhi khul sakati hon
kabhi kabhi computer kaa keedaa or trogen horces ke liye bhi bhram purvak virus shabd kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a worm can spread itself to other computers, it does not need to be transferred as a fortune to the host, and a Trojan horse is a file that appears to be harmless
 kide or trogen horse ek commuter system ke aankadon, kaaryaatmak pradarshan, yaa kaary nishpaadan ke dauraan netwarking ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 In general, a worm does not actually harm the system's hardware or software, whereas a Trojan payload, at least in theory, is capable of causing any type of damage during execution
 jab program nahin chal rahaa he tab kuch bhi nahin dikhaai detaa he lekin jaise hi sankramit code chalata he, trogen horse pravesh kar jaataa he
 This is why it is very difficult for people to find viruses and other malware and hence they have to use spyware programs and registration procedures
 aajkal adhikansh vyaktigat computer internet or lokar aria network se jude hai or local aria network, dooshit code ko failaane kii prakriya ko suvidhajanak banaata he
 Today's virus can also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, instant messaging and file sharing systems to help spread viruses and insects
 iske alaava, kuch strot ek vaikalpik shabdaawalee kaa upyog karte hai, jisamen ek virus swa-anulipi karne vaale mailaware kaa ek rup hota he
 Some malware is programmed to damage the computer by destroying destructive programs, deleting files, or re-formatting the hard disk
 anya mailaware program kisi kshati ke liye nahin banaaye jate hai, lekin saadhaaran rup se apane aap ko anulipit kar lete hai oe shaayad koi text, video, yaa audio sandesh ke dwaara apni upasthiti ko darshaate hai
 Even these less ominous malware programs can cause problems for the computer user

 The earliest virus creeper was discovered on Arpanet, which first appeared on the Internet in the early 1970s
 yah TENEX oparating system ke dwaara failaa or yah computer ko niyantrit or sankramit karne ke liye kisi bhi jude modem kaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 This message may display "I am the creeper; catch me if you can"
 It was rumored that the Reaper program, which appears shortly after and made copies of the creeper and deleted them, was probably written in a letter of regret by the creator of the creeper
 ek aam dharna he ki ek program jo "rothar j "kehalaata tha vah "in di wild " prakat hone vaala pehla computer virus tha —yah ek computer ke baahar yaa prayogshaala main banaaya gaya, lekin yah daawa galat tha
 See the timeline of well-known computer viruses and insects for other recent viruses
 But this was the first virus to infect computers "at home"
 1982 main richard scranta, ke dwaara likhaa gaya, isane khud ko appal DOS 3
3 oparating system ke saath jod liya or flopy discs ke dwaara failaa
multah yah virus ek hai skool ke chaatr ke dwaara nirmit ek majaak tha or ise ek khel ke rup main flopy discs par daal diya gaya
 On its 50th use, the Elk Cloner virus became active, infecting the computer, and it displayed a short poem "elk Cloner: The program with a personality"
 In The Wild the first PC virus was a boot sector virus that Called Brain Brain), it was created by Farooq Alvi Brothers in 1986, and operated outside Lahore, Pakistan
 inhone is kathith virus ko unke dwaara banaaye gaye software kii pratiyon ki chori rokane ke liye banaaya
yadhyapi, vishleshkon ne daawa kiya ki Ashar virus jo, brain kii ek prajati he, sambhawatah virus ke andar code ke aadhaar par ise purv dinaankit karata he
 Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread to removable mediums, especially floppy disks
 shuruaati dinon main nijee computer, ke kai upyogkartaaon ke bich niyamit rup se jaankaree or prograamon kaa vinimay fluopiyon ke dwaara hota tha
 Many viruses spread from infected programs on these disks, while some installed themselves in the boot area of the disk, ensuring that when the user boots the computer from the disk, it will run unintentionally
 KPC first tried to boot from the floppy if any floppy remained in the drive
 jab tak flopi kaa upyog kam nahin ho gaya tab tak yah sarvaadhik safal sankraman ranneeti thi, in the wild boot kshetra ke virason ko bananaa sabase aasaan tha
 Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, due to increased use of personal computers and as a result increased use of BBS and modems, and software exchanges
 bulatin board software ke aadan pradaan ne pratyaksh rup se trogen horse programs ko failaayaa or virus lokapriy vyavsaayik software ko sankramit karne ke liye banaaye jate the
 Shareware and bootlegs were common carriers for BBS viruses
 hobists ke "piret seen" main jo khudara software, kii avaidh pratiyon kaa vyaek virus ek sankramit mashin par sabhi samparkon ko twarit sandesh ke rup main ek web pataa link bhej saktaa he
 If the recipient thinks that the link is from a friend, they follow the link on the website, the virus present on the site may be able to infect this new computer and start spreading
 virus parivaar kii sabase nai prajati he kros sait patakatha virus
yah virus anusandhan se ubhara or 2005 main iskaa academik rup se pradarshan hua
 The virus is transmitted using cross-site scripting
 2005 ke baad se in the wild, kros sait patakatha virason ke bahut se udahaaran rahe hai, sabase ullekhneey prabhavit saiten hai mispes or yahuu
 To replicate itself, a virus must have permission to execute code and write to memory
 For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of the appropriate program
 yadi ek upyog karta ek sankramit program ko shuru karne kii koshish karata he to, aisa ho saktaa he kii pehle virus kaa code nishpadit ho
 viruson ko do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, unke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par or unke nishpaadan ke aadhaar par
anivaasee virus tunrat anya poshiyon ko khojate hai jinhen sankramit kiya ja saktaa he, in lakshyon ko sankramit karte hai or antat niyantran ko anuprayog program par sthanantarit kar dete hai jise unhone sankramit kiya he
 Resident viruses do not look for Poshi when they begin
 iske bajaay, ek nivasee virus apane aap ko nishpaadan par smriti main lod kar letaa he or niyantran ko poshi program par sthanantarit kar detaa he
 The virus remains active in the background and infects new hosts when these files are accessed by other programs or by the operating system itself
 aisa mana jaataa he ki anivaasee virus ek khojak modul or ek pratikruti modul se yukt hota he
 The Finder module is responsible for finding new files for transition
 har nai nishpaadan yogya fil ke liye khojak modul akraman kar detaa he, yah fil ko sankramit karne ke liye anulipi modul ko bulaata he
 a resident virus has a duplication module similar to the duplication module employed by a non-resident virus
 yadhyapi yah modul khojak modul ke dwaara nahin bulaayaa jaataa he
 Instead, the virus loads the duplication module into memory when it is executed and ensures that this module executes each time the operating system performs a certain operation
 udhaaharan ke liye, har baar jab oparating system ek sanchika ko nishpadit karata he, anulipi modul ko bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 In this case, the virus infects every appropriate program to be executed on the computer
 kabhi kabhi nivasee virus ko aage do shreniyon main upavibhajit kiya jaataa he ek teevr sankramak or duusare dhimen sankramak
teevr sankramak ko is prakaar se banaaya gaya he ki jitani adhik sanchikaon ko ho sake sankramit kar sake
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek teevr sankramak akses ho sakane vaali har sambhav poshi sanchika ko sankramit karata he
 This is a particular problem for anti-virus softwares, as a virus scanner will access every possible host file when it performs a comprehensive system scan
 yadi virus scanner is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakh paata ki aisa ek virus smriti main upasthit he, virus scanner par peeche se waar karata he or is prakaar se scan ho rahi sabhi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Acute infectives rely on rapid infection rates for their spread
 is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki kai sanchikaon ko sankramit karne se pataa lagane kii sambhaavna adhik ho jaati he, kyon ki virus computer ko dhimaa kar detaa he yaa kai sandigdh kriyaaon ko karata he jo virus virdohi software ke dwaara dekhi ja sakati hai
 The second and slower infectives are made in such a way that they infect the host un-covered
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch dhime sankramak sanchikaon ko keval tabhi sankramit karte hai jab unako copy kiya ja rahaa he
 They are not easy to detect due to the limited function of slow infectives: they do not slow down the computer too much, but frequently shock anti-virus softwares that can be detected by the suspicious behavior of the programs
 dhime sankramak bahut adhik safal prathit nahin hote hai, Viruses have targeted different types of transmission media
 yah suchi khatm nahin ho sakati he: pdfs, such as HTML, may be associated with malicious code
 kuch virus lekhakon ne jo likhaa he uskaa koi mahatva nahin he
 PNG at the end of the EXE extension, hoping that the user would stop at the type of the trusted file, would not notice that the computer would start with the final file type
 Trojan Horse) view upyogkarta ke dwaara pataa lagane se bachane ke liye, kuch wiras vibhinn prakaar ke chal karte hai
 Some older viruses, especially on the MS-DOS platform, ensure that when the file is infected by the virus, the date that the host file is "last modified" remains
 yadhyapi yah drushtikon virus virdohi software ko murkh nahin banataa he, vishesh rup se wo jo sanchika parivartan par chakree atirek kii jaanch ki dinaankon ko banaaye rakhata he
 Some viruses can infect files without increasing their size and damaging the files
 ve aisa nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ke aprayukt kshetron main adhilekhan ke dwaara karte hai
 This is called cavity virus
 udhaaharan ke liye kii CIH virus, yaa cheranobil virus, portable nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he
 Because there were many free spaces in those files, the virus, which was 1 KB in length, did not get attached to the file size
 Some viruses do not allow themselves to be exposed to the anti-virus software before it is detected
 Because computers and operating systems are becoming more developed and complex, there is a need to upgrade or replace old concealing technologies
 ek computer ko virus se surakshit rakhane ki maang yah ho sakati he ki sanchika tantra har prakaar ke sanchika acces ke liye vistrut or spasht anumati kii or palaayan kar jaae
 a virus needs to be infected to spread further for a virus
 kuch maamalon main, ek poshi ko sankramit karnaa ek kharaab vichaar ho saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye, kai virus virdohi program apane code kii akhandta kii jaanch karte hai
 Therefore infection of such programs will increase the possibility that the virus has been detected
 is kaaran se, kuch virus un prograamon ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo virus virdohi software kaa hissaa he
 Another type of virus that the virus sometimes tries to avoid is bait files
 Bat files are files created specifically by anti-virus software or anti-virus professionals themselves to be infected by a virus
 
 in sanchikaon ko bhinn kaarnon se banaaya ja saktaa he, ye sabhi virus kaa pataa lagane se sambandhit hai
 Since bat files are used to detect viruses or make probes possible, the infection cannot be taken advantage of by the virus
 aam taur par virus aam taur par aisa virus prograamon se batch kar aisa karte hai, jaise choti program sanchikaaye yaa program jinamein ' kooda nirdesh ' ke vishisht praturup hon
batting ko mushkil banane ke liye ek sambandhit ranneeti he viral sankraman
kabhi kabhi, viral sankramak ek poshi sanchika ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo anya sthitiyon main sankraman ke liye upyukt ummidavaar ho saktaa he
 For example, a virus may decide on a random basis whether to infect a file or not, or a virus can infect host files on particular days of the week
 kuch virus oparating system se anurodh karke virus virdohi software ko dhokhaa dene ki koshish karte hai
 The anti-virus software requests to read the file and the request goes to the virus instead of the OS, thus a virus hides itself
 ab virus virdohi software kii sanchika ke asankramit sanskaran par lot jaataa he, jisase ki aisa prathit hota he ki sanchika " svachh " he
 Modern anti-virus software has several techniques for detecting the theft of viruses
 chori ko rokane kii keval ek vishwasaneey vidhi he ek aise madhyam se boot karnaa jo svachh ho
 Most anti-virus programs try to find virus patterns within simple programs, this is called the signature of the so-called virus
 hastakshar ek lakshanik bit praturup he, jo ek vishesh virus yaa virus parivaar kaa ek bhaag he
 If a virus scanner discovers such a pattern in a file, it notifies the user that the file is infected
 upyogkarta phir is sanchika ko nasht kar sakate hai, yaa sankramit sanchika ko " shuddh " yaa " thik "kar sakate hai
 Some viruses use techniques that not only make it difficult to detect by signature, but also impossible
 ye virus prayek sankraman par apana code badal lete hai
 That is, each infected file contains a different species of virus
 virus ke kutalekhan ke liye ek or adhik unnat vidhi he saral ancripshan kaa upyog
is maamle main, virus ek chote se decrypting modul or virus ke code ki ek ancrypted copy se yukt hota he
 If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file, then only part of the virus remains static is the decrypting module, which will be attached to the end of it
 In this case, a virus scanner will use the signature directly of the virus
 Cannot detect, but it can still detect decrypting modules, which can still indirectly detect possible viruses
 chunki ye sankramit poshi par sangrahit kunjia hongi, vastav main antim virus ko vicode karnaa puri tarah se sambhav he, lekin isaki shaayad zarurat nahin he, chunki swayan sanshodhit code itnaa durlabh he ki iske kaaran se virus scanner kam se kam sandigdh sanchika ko ankit kar saktaa he
 An older but compact, encryption involves a static virus that xoring each byte, so that the operation is repeated only for decryption
 This is ambiguous code that modifies itself, so many virus definitions include an encryption / decryption signature
 Could be part
 bahurupi code pehali takanic thi jo virus scanner ke liye ek gambhir khatra bani
 niyamit ancrypted virus kii tarah, ek bahurupi virus apane ancrypted code ke saath sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he, jo ek dicripshan modul ke dwaara dicode kar diya jaataa he
 In the case of polymorphic viruses, this decryption module is also modified on each infection
 isliye thik prakaar se likhe gaye bahurupi virus main aise koi bhaag nahin hai jo sankramanon main samaan hon, yah hastakshar kaa upyog karke iskaa pataa lagaana mushkil banaata he
 Anti-virus software can detect it by decrypting using a competitor, or by statistical replication analysis of the encrypted virus body
 bahurupi code ko sakasham karne ke liye, virus ke paas iske ancrypted sharir main kahin par ek bahurupi ingine hona chahie 
is tarah ke ingine kaise kaam karte he is par takneekee vistaar ke liye bahurupi code dekhen
kuch virus bahurupi code ko is prakaar se kaam main lete hai ki yah mukhya rup se virus ke utparivartan kii dar ko baadhya karata he
 For example, a virus is programmed to mutate only in a short period of time, or it can be programmed to infect a file that already contains duplicate viruses, So it can avoid mutation
 The advantage of using slower polymorphic code is that it makes it difficult for the anti-virus professional to obtain a representative sample of the virus, because BAT files that are infected once they run are typically identical to the virus
 Will be the sample
 This will increase the likelihood that the probe performed by the virus scanner will be unreliable and it may be that some instances of the virus may not be able to detect the probe
 anukaran ke dwaara jaanch se bachane ke liye kuch virus har baar jab ek nae nishpadanyogy ko sankramit karte hai tab apane aap ko punarlikhit kar lete hai
 Viruses that use such technology are called metamorphic ones
 roopantaran ko sambhav banane ke liye ek roopantarit ingine kii jarurat hoti he
 a transformed virus is usually very large and complex
 udhaaharan ke liye, W32 / Simile main samooh bhashaa code kii 14000 se adhik rekhyen hoti hai, jinamein se 90% roopantarit ingine kaa hissaa he
 Just as genetic diversity in a population decreases, it reduces the chance of a single disease, similarly the diversity of software systems on a network also limits the destructive potential of the virus
 yah 1990 main vishesh vichaar kaa vishay ban gaya jab microsoft ne desktop oparating system or karyaalay suite main bazaar main prabhutv praapt kar liya
 Users of Microsoft software and Internet Explorer) are particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses
 microsoft software ko virus ke dwaara lakshya banaaye jane kaa kaaran he unka desktop prabhutv hona or aksar kai galatiyon or virus lekhakon ke liye chhidron ki vajah se isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 Integrated and non-integrated Microsoft applications and language script applications with access to the file system, and applications with networking features) are also particularly risky
 yadhyapi windos virus ke lekhakon ke liye, sabase lokapriy oparating system he, kuch virus duusare platform par bhi maujuud he
 Any operating system that can allow third-party programs to run can theoretically run viruses

unics aadhaarit OS keval apane upyog kartaaon ko hi apane nirdeshon ke antargat surakshit sthaan ke bheetar nishpaadan kii anumati dete hai
 An Internet-based research showed that there were cases when people deliberately pressed a particular button to download a virus

 The result was 409 clicks
 In 2006 with relatively few security methods that were targeting Mac OS X)
 Older Apple Operating a number of viruses for the system, known as Mac OS Classic, differ greatly in different sources, with Apple being said to have only four types of well-known viruses and 63 according to independent sources There are forms of virus
 yah kahana surakshit he ki bazaar ke kam share ki vajah se Macs ko lakshya banane kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or is prakaar se ek mike vishesh virus keval computaron ke ek chote anupaat ko hi sankramit kar saktaa he
 Virus exposure is the main selling point between

 Windows and Unix have the same scripting capabilities, but while Unix naturally prevents normal users from having access to make changes for the operating system environment, older copies of Windows such as Windows 95 and 98 do not
 In 1997, When a virus called "bliss" was released for Linux - major anti-virus vendors issued a warning to fix Unix-like systems

 bliss virus ko virason kaa lakshanik mana ja saktaa he--unics pranaaliyon par --keedon ke vipareet
bliss kii zarurat he ki upyogkarta ise spasht rup se chalaata he or yah keval aise prograamon ko sankramit kar saktaa he jo upyogkarta ke dwaara sanshodhit kiye ja sakate hai
 Unlike Windows users, most Unix users do not log in as an administrator user except by installing software: even if a user runs a virus it cannot harm the operating system
 bliss virus kabhi bhi vyapak nahin hua or mukhya rup se anusandhan ke liye utsukata kaa vishay bana rahaa
iske nirmaataa ne baad main yuzanet ko iskaa strot code post kiya, shodhakartaaon ko yah jaanane ki anumati di ki yah kaise kam karata he
 Since software is often designed with a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized use of the system source, many viruses help spread software bugs in a system or application
 software vikaas ranneetiyaan jo badi sankhya main bag kaa utpaadan karti hai, saamaanya rup se sakasham dohan bhi utpann karti he
 Many users install anti-virus software, which detects or destroys known viruses after a computer download or after the executable has run
 aise do saamaanya tareeke hai jinhen ek virus virdohi software anuprayog virus kii jaanch karne ke liye kaam main letaa he
 The first and most common method of virus detection is to use a list of signature definitions of viruses
 It works by comparing the components of the computer's memory and the boot sector) and files stored on permanent or temporary drives and comparing these files The "signature" of known viruses is against the database
 jaanch kii is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki upyog karta keval virus se surakshit rahata he jo apni pichhali paribhaasha kaa adhyatan karata rahata he
 The second method is the approximate algorithm in which viruses are based on normal behavior
 is vidhi main virason kaa pataa lagane ki kshamta hoti he jiske liye abhi bhi virus virdohi companiyon ko hastakshar bananaa he
 Some anti-virus programs are able to scan open files as well as e-mails sent and received 'on the fly' in a similar way
 ise "on-access scanning"kehete hai
 Anti-virus software does not change the ability of POSHI software to transmit viruses
 upyogkarta ko ptch suraksha chhidr ke liye apane software niyamit rup se adhyatan karne chahie
anti virus software ko bhi niyamit rup se adhyatan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he taaki aadhunik khataron ko roka ja sake
koi bhi vyakti bhinn media par data ke niyamit rup se byaap se virus ke dwaara kii gai kshati ko kam kar saktaa he, inhen yaa to system se asambaddha, rakhaa jaataa he, yaa anya kaarnon jaise bhinn sanchika pranaaliyon kaa upyog ke liye ise nahin kholaa ja saktaa yaa keval read-only rakhaa jaataa he
 In this way, if data is lost through a virus, anyone can resume using backup
 yadi optical media jaise sidi or dividi par ek byaap satr band ho gaya he, yah read-only ban jaataa he or ab virus se sankramit nahin ho saktaa he
 Likewise, an operating system on a bootable can be used to start a computer if the installed operating system usage is down
 anya vidhi he bhinn sanchika tantron par bhinn aaparating system kaa upyog
ek virus kii donon ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 Data backup can also be performed on different file systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, linaks ko NTFS vibhaajan par likhane ke liye vishesh software kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, isliye yadi koi software ko install nahin karata he or ek NTFS vibhaajan par ek byaap karne ke liye MS vindos ke alag installation kaa upyog karata he, byaap ko lines ke kisi bhi varjan se surakshit hona chahie
isi tarah, MS vindos sanchika system jaise ext3, ko nahin pard saktaa he, isliye yadi koi saamanyatya MS vindos kaa upyog karata he, ek linaks installation kaa upyog karte hue ek ext3 vibhaajan par byaap banaaya ja saktaa he
 Once a computer is compromised by a virus, it is generally unsafe to continue to use the same computer without fully installing the operating system again
 lekin, kai vikalp hai jo computer main virus ke aane ke baad upasthit hote hai
 These actions depend on the severity of the type of virus
 Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista par ek sambhaavna he ek aujaar jo system ristor ke naam se janaa jaataa he jo ki pichley check bindu ke liye registry or jatil tantra sanchika ko ristor kar ke rakhata he
 Often a virus hangs on to a system and after booting again, the system's restore point will have a problem from the same day
 The work has been done to restore point since the last days, now the virus will store stored files Can not infect
 phir bhi kuch virus, system ke ristor ko or anya mahatvapurn aujaaron jaise task menager or cmand prompt ko niskriy kar dete hai
 An example of a virus that does this is ciadoor
 Administrators have options to disable such tools from limited users for different reasons
 virus aisa karne ke liye registry main sanshodhan karata he, keval us samay aisa nahin hota he jab prashaasak computer ko niyantrit kar rahaa ho, yah sab upyogkartaaon ko aujaaron ko acces karne se roktaa he
 When an infected tool is activated it gives a message "task manager has been disabled by your administrator
 "yahan tak kii yadi upyogkarta jo program kholane kii koshish kar rahaa he vah prashaasak he
 Users who are running the Microsoft operating system can visit Microsoft's website to run a free scan if they have their 20-digit registration number
 oparating system ko punah install karnaa virus hataane kaa ek alag tarika he
 This usually involves re-formatting the OS partition and installing the OS through its original means
 yaa ek saafe bedap chhavi ke saath vibhaajan kii kalpana kii ja sakati he yaa Acronis ke saath liya gaya) 
is vidhi kaa laabh yah he kii yah karne main saral he, kai virus virdohi scan ko chalaane kii tulana main yah tej hota he or kisi bhi mailaware ko dur karne kii guarantee detaa he
 Downsides include reinstalling all other software and operating systems
 upyogkarta data ko ek live sidi ko boot karke yaa hard drive ko kisi duusare computer main rakhkar or us computer ke oparating system se boot karke bek ap kiya ja saktaa he

 In theory, the frame relay can operate on the d channel of BRI and PRI, but it is rarely used
 iesdn kii duniya ke do drushtikon hai
 The most common approach is that of the end user, who wants to take a digital connection to the home telephone / data network, whose performance will be better than a simple analog modem connection
 antim-upyogkarta kaa vishisht internet conection is drushtikon se sambandhit he or vibhinn iesdn modemon kii khoobiyon kii charchaa, vaahakon kii peshkash or tarriff isi pariprekshya se sambandhit he
 Much of the next discussion relates to this approach, but it should be noted that as a data connection service, ISDN is mostly superseded by DSL
 ek doosraa drushtikon he jo telephone udyog se sambandhit he jahaan iesdn ek kendriya praudyogiki he
 a telephone network can be considered a collection of wires tied between switching systems
 in taron par sanketon kaa aam vidyutiya vinirdesan T1 yaa E1 he
 Signaling between telephone company switches is done via SS7

 ISDN is much better because messages can be sent much faster than trying to encode numbers up to long tone order

 In addition, more and more facilities become available and fraud is minimized
 iesdn ko ek chatur-network praudyogiki ke rup main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa uddeshy public switchd telephone network ) main nai sevaaon ko shaamil karnaa he jiske liye yah upyogkartaaon ko ek chor se duusare chor ke paripath-switchd digital sevaaon main pratyaksh acces karne kii suvidha pradaan karata he or iske saath hi saath ise ) ko mahatvapurn prayog vaale data paripathon ke ek purtikar yaa nishphal-rakshit paripath samaadhaan ke rup main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 ISDN is widely used by the broadcast industry as a reliable method of low latency, high quality, long distance audio circuit switching
 upyukt kodak ke saath sangyojan ke rup main, 20 Hz-20 khz bandwidth vaale sterio dwi-dishaatmak audio ko bhejne ke liye ek iesdn biarai kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki aamtaur par parinami audio ko ek lo-faai "iesdn dhwani" pradaan karke ek single b channel par puraane ho chale G
722 kodak kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Where very high quality audio is required to provide a circuit switched connection with high bandwidth, multiple ISDN bris can be used in parallel
 bibisi radio 3, sidhe bahari prasaranon ke liye 320kbps audio stream kaa vahan karne ke liye aam taur par teen iesdn biarai kaa prayog karata he
 ISDN BRI services are used to connect remote studios, playgrounds and outdoor broadcasts to the main broadcast studio
 duniya bhar ke kshetra samvaadadaataaon dwaara upgrah ke jariye iesdn kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The use of ISDN for return audio links is also common in remote satellite broadcasting vehicles
 ypi aadhaarit strimming kodak, jaise - comrex acces, doordaraj ke studio se judane ke liye broadband internet kaa prayog karke prasaaran kshetra main apni pakad hasil karnaa shuru kar rahaa he
 However, reliability is crucially important for broadcasters and the quality of service offered by ISDN has not yet been matched by packet switched options
 iesdn-biarai ko canada or america main kabhi ek saamaanya prayog telephone acces praudyogiki ke rup main lokapriyata hasil nahin hui he or aaj yah ek aalaa utpaada bana hua he
 The service was seen as a solution in search of a problem, and it was difficult for most customers to understand and use the broad array of options and features

 The difficulty is that as BRI was entering the service sector, the concept of what the term broadband meant was being revised upward to allow the customer to know it to be at least 256 kbit / s
 jaise hi sanyukt rajya america main adiesel kii lokapriyata main vruddhi hui, vaise hi biarai kaa upabhokta bazaar bikhar gaya
 The only remaining positive element of this is that while the functional distance of ADSL is limited, the BRI working range is relatively large and it can use repeaters
 vaise to, biarai un sthitiyon main sweekaarya ho sakate hai jahaan graahak itane dur hote hai ki ve adiesel kaa istemaal nahin kar sakate hai
 The widespread use of BRI has subsequently faced the hurdle of some North American clecs, such as century-tail, who have abandoned it and will not provide Internet access facilities using it

 It is very expensive and ip-based conferencing is being used instead, but where there is no cost problem and quality is required, BRI is the preferred option

 Home highways have been purchased by many home users for an Internet connection, but still not as fast as ADSL, as it was available before ADSL and in places where ADSL does not reach
 virgin media bhi virgin broadband ke un graahakon ke liye iesdn linon kaa prayog karata he jo cabel tivi ke kshetron main rahete hai
 France Telecom offers ISDN services under its product name Numeris, which has a Professional Duo and Home ITU version
 iesdn ko france main aam taur par arenaies ke naam se janaa jaataa he or bade paimaane par uplabdh he
 The introduction of ADSL has cut the use of ISDN for data transfer and Internet access, although it is still common in more rural and remote areas and for applications such as business voice and sales center terminals

 a study by the German Department of Science shows the following prevalence of isdn-channels per 1000 inhabitants in the year 2005: iesdn main do prakaar ke channel - b or d hote hai
 The b channel is used for data and the d channel is used for signaling and control
 iesdn ke do karyanvayan hai
 Basic rate interface), also called basic rate access) - is composed of two b channels, each with a bandwidth of 64 kbit / s and a d channel with a bandwidth of 16 kbit / s
