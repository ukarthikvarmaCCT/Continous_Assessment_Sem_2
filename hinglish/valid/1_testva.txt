 Endoscope means looking inside, and especially it means looking inside the body with the help of endoscope for medical reasons
 endoscope ek aisa upkaran he, jiskaa prayog sharir ke khokhale ang athwa chhidron ke andar jaanch karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Unlike other medical imaging devices, the endoscope is inserted directly into the body part
 endoscopy, aisi takneekee paristhitiyon, jinamein pratyaksh drushti-rekha avlokan vyaavhaarik na ho, main borescope ke prayog ko bhi ullekith kar sakati he
 An endoscope may consist of the following components: endoscopy ke antargat shaamil ho sakate hai: The first endoscope was invented in 1806 by Philippe Bozzini with the development of the "lichtliter" introduced by him to examine the tubes and troughs of the human body
 haalanki vienna medical socity ne aisi jigyaasa ko asweekrut kar diya
 The first endoscope was developed in 1822 by William Beaumont, a military surgeon from mckinney Island, Michigan

 Carl Storge started making equipment for ENT specialists in 1945
 unka iraadaa aisa upkaran viksit karne kaa tha, jisaki madad se chikitsak maanav sharir ke andar dekh sakane main safal ho sake
 The technology available at the end of World War II was still very simple
 maanav sharir ke andaruni bhaag ke pareekshan ke antargat aane vaala kshetra miniechar electric lamp dwaara prakashit kiya jaataa tha
 Efforts were made to reflect light into the body from an external source through an endoscopic tube
 karl stores ne ek yojana ko apanaaya: unhone sharir ke andar upkaran ke jariye bahut hi chamakili, lekin thandi, roshni daalane kaa prayaas kiya, jisase sharir ke andar behtareen drishyata praapt ho or saath hi chitra prasaaran ke jariye vastunishth dastavejikaran sambhav ho sake
 Karl Storge played an important role towards the development of endoscopy, with over 400 patients and functional samples as guides for the coming time
 haalanki ve harold hopkins the jinhone apni ejineering pratibha or drushti ke saath-saath optical diziner ke kaary dwaara medical optics ke kshetra main aakhirkaar kranti paidaa kar di
 The gastroscope was first developed in 1952 by a Japanese doctor and team of optical engineers
 mutsuo sugiura ne olimpus korporation ke sanyukt tatwadhan main doctor tatsuro yuji or unke sahyogi shoji phukami ke saath aise upkaran ko viksit karne ke liye kaary kiya, jise unhone pehle “gastro camera” naam diya tha
 It had a tiny camera attached to the light bulb at a flexible tip
 isaki madad se ve pet ke ulcer kaa chitra lene tathaa aarambhik avasthaa main pet ke cancer kaa pataa lagane main safal rahe, jo eks-re dwaara pakad main nahin aate the
 In the early 1950s Harold Hopkins produced a "fibroscope", which proved useful in both the medical and industry sectors
 in fibron par hone vaale baad ke shodh or vikaas se chitra kii gunvattta main or bhi sudhaar aae
 In the days to come, the use of additional fibers to bring light from a powerful external source to the ends of the object was included in the new development - allowing for a higher level of full spectral brightness, which was needed to see the nuances of the image and color photography
 Is meant for
 optical kshetra main hone vaale vikaas ke saath hi yah kshamta viksit hui, jisamen endoscopist ke haathon main sthit niyantran dwaara tip ko “sanchalit” karnaa sambhav hua or saath hi endoscope ke andar lage shalya-chikitsa upkaran ko remote ke jariye sanchalit karne kii disha main bhi nai suvidhaayen hasil huin
 This was the beginning of the surgery that we know today as key hole surgery
 portugal ke fernando alwes martins ne pratham fibre optics endoscope kaa avishkaar kiya 
 However, the picture quality of the fibroscope had physical limitations
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main 50,000 fibre kaa ek bandal prabhaavshaalee rup main keval 50,000 picksal kaa chitra hi detaa he, iske alaava istemaal main lagaataar parivartan ke kaaran fibre tuutate hai or is prakaar dhire-dhire picksal kam ho jate hai
 Eventually enough damage occurs that the entire bundle needs to be replaced
 hopkins ne mahasoos kiya ki kisi agle optical sudhaar ke liye ek alag vidhi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Earlier strict endoscopes had very low light transmittance and poor image quality
 sargical kaaryon ke liye shalya-chikitsa ke aujaaron or ilumination system ko endoscope tub se hokar gujaarne kii aavashyaktaa ke kaaran imaging optics ke liye koi khaas gunjaaish nahin thi
 The smaller lens of the traditional system required an auxiliary ring, which acquired a larger portion of the lens; These were quite difficult to construct and put together, as well as optically failing
 hopkins ne jo parishkrut nidaan prastut kiya, vah tha ‘little lens’ ke bich ke sthaan ko glass rod se bhar dena
 These fit precisely into the endoscope tube, making them self-concentrating and requiring no support to fully distribute the 'little lens'
 rod-lens ko sanchalit or istemaal karnaa kaaphi aasaan tha or isane adhiktam uplabdh vyas kaa upyog kiya
 The quality of the image was converted into a 1 mm diameter tube with the correct curvature, coating at the ends of the rod and maximum choices of glass type, as assessed and mentioned by Hopkins
 aise chote vyas vaale ucch gunvattta yukt ‘telescope’ ke saath tul tathaa iluminesh system ko aasaani se ek bahari tub ke bheetar rakhaa ja sakaa
 Karl Storge once again created these new endoscopes first in the form of a long creative collaboration between two individuals
 yadhyapi sharir ke kuch kshetra aise hai, jinhen hameshaa ke liye flexible endoscope kii hi aavashyaktaa hogi, sakht rod-lens endoscopon ke aise apavaadatmak pradarshan rahe hai ki aaj ke samay main bhi ye ek pasandida upkaran hai or vastav main aadhunik kii-hole surgery kii safalataa main sakasham kaarak rahe hai

 Colonization by people of one geographical area in another geographical area and recognizing that it is a good work is called colonialism
 itihaas main praaia: pandrahavin shatabdi se lekar beesvin shatabdi tak upniveshwaad kaa kaal rahaa
 During this period, the people of Europe colonized different parts of the world
 is kaal main upniveshwaad main vishwaas ke mukhya kaaran the - Some colonists also thought that they are helping the local people by making them Christians and making them see "civilization"
 kintu vaastaviktaa main upniveshwaad kaa arth tha - aadhipaty, visthaapan evam mrityu
 The colony was part of the empire of the motherland; Thus, colonialism has a close relationship with imperialism

 Colonialism means the consumption of the various resources of a weak but full of natural resources by a rich and powerful nation to fulfill its various interests

 According to Arganski, vastutah ham kisi shaktishaalee raashtra dwaara nihit swaarthvash kisi nirbal raashtra ke shoshan ko upniveshwaad kah sakate hai
 The Latin word 'colonia' means a property that is systematically established among foreigners
 bumadhyasagariya kshetra or madhyayugin europe main is tarah kaa upniveshikaran ek aam parighatna thi
 An example of this is given as the colonization of Wales and Ireland by the British rule in the medieval and early periods of the modern era
 lekin, jis aadhunik upniveshwaad kii yahan charchaa kii ja rahi he uskaa matlab he europea or america takaton dwaara gair-pashchimi samskritiyon or rashtron par jabaran kabza karke vahaan ke raaj-kaaj, prashasan, paryaavaran, paristhitiki, bhashaa, dharm, vyavastha or jivan-style par apane vijaateey mulyon or sanrachanaon ko thopane kii dirghakaalin prakriya
 a source of such colonialism is also considered to be the voyages of Columbus and Vasco da Gama

 yah silsilaa beesvin sadi ke madhya tak chalaa jab vi-upniveshikaran kii prakriya ke tahat rashtriya mukti sangraamon or krantiyon kii lahar ne iskaa ant kar diya
 The ideological roots of this phenomenon can be seen in the expansion of mercantilist capitalism and the ideology of liberal individualism that developed along with it
 kisi duusari dharti ko apana upnivesh bana lene or swaamitv ke bhukhe vyaktvaad main ek hi tarah kii mul pravritiyaan nihit hoti hai
 Deformities like racism, Eurocentricity and foreign hatred are the product of colonialism
 upniveshwaad samrajyavad hote hue bhi kaafii-kuch parasparavyapee or paraspar-nirbhar pad hai
 It is not necessary for imperialism to seize a country and send its occupiers there and establish their administration
 iske bina bhi samrajyavaadee centre ke prati adhinsthata ke sambandh kaayam kiye ja sakate hai
 However, it is necessary for colonialism to establish its own colony in the conquered country, the majority of the aggressor's conquests by directing themselves to be superior and to impose their own laws and decisions
 aisa karne ke liye samrajyavaadee vistaar ko ek khaas vichaardhaara kaa tark hasil karnaa aavashyak tha
 This role was played by the philosophy of John Locke, propounded in the seventeenth century
 lock kii sthapanaaon main britain dwaara bheje gayi adhivaasiyon dwaara america kii dharti par kabza kar lene kii karrwai ko nyaaysangat tehraane kii daleelein maujuud thim
 The second thesis of his work 'two Treatise on Civil Government' is about a person claiming his rights in 'prakrit Status'
 ve aisi jagahon par naagarik shashan sthapit karne or vyaktigat prayaas dwaara hathiyaan gayi smapda ko apane laabh ke liye viksit karne ko jaays qaraar dete hai
 This thesis later became the basis for accepting the disproportionate ownership of the earth
 lock kii manyata thi ki america main anaap-shanaap zamin bekaar padi hui he or vahaan ke muulavaasi yani indian is dharti kaa sadupyog karne kii yogyata se vanchit hai
 Locke calculated that if an acre of land in Europe gives a profit of five shillings per year to its owner, then the total profit of the Indian settled on it from American land is much less than a penny
 chunki america indian baaki maanavtaa main prachlit dhan-aadhaarit vinimay-pranali apnaane main naakaam rahe hai, isliye ‘sampatti ke adhikaar’ ke mutabik unki dharti ko adhigrahit karke us par maanviya shram kaa nivesh kiya janaa chahie
 In this lock's thesis there were seeds of the European superiority gland on the civilization and culture of the Asian and American continents, on the basis of which the colonization of colonial structures was built
 upniveshon mukhyatah do kismein thim
 On one side there were countries like America, Australia and New Zealand whose climate was comfortable for Europeans
 in ilaakon main safed chamadi ke log bahut bade paimaane par basaaye gayi
 They not only took full control of the local population by carrying out massive projects of destruction and repression, but they turned their country into their own 'homeland'

 On the other hand, there were colonies whose air-water was hostile to the Europeans
 in deshon par kabza karne ke baad european thodi sankhya main hi vahaan based or mukhyatah aarthik shoshan or dohan ke liye un dharatiyon kaa istemaal kiya
 There were also a few colonies like New England which were founded by European Christians in search of religious freedom
 vyapaarik kranti main bhugolic khojon ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Colonialism began with these geographical discoveries
 spain, portugal, dach, france evam england aadi europea deshon ne sudur deshon main upnivesh sthapit kiye
 Following were the reasons for the onset of colonialism in Europe - bhugolic khojon ke falswaroop columbus dwaara america kii khoj ne europea deshon main swarna jaisi bahumoolya dhaatu ke sangrah kii pratisparddha aarambh kii
 The competitive position of gold-collection was that the slogan of 'more gold, more prosperity, more fame' was raised all over Europe
 ab samast europea rashtron kaa pramukh dhyaan sona, kirti evam ishwar arthath Gold, Glory and God par kendrit ho gaya
 With the establishment of colonies, European countries also got gold, fame spread and religion was also promoted
 atah tripal g niti nihsandeh upniveshon kii sthapana kaa ek kaaran avashya thi
 Commercial prosperity resulted in the establishment of many industries in European countries
 europe main in udyogon ke liye aavashyak kachche maal kii kami thi
 Therefore, European countries established natural resources and colonies in African and Asian countries to obtain raw materials
 udyogon kii sthapana evam kachche maal kii uplabdhta se audyogic utpaadan teevr gati se badha
 Because at this time all European countries were following the policy of economic protection
 atah is nirmit maal ko khapaane ke liye bhi upniveshon kii sthapana kii gayi
 That is, each of the colonies was forced to purchase forcibly manufactured goods and export raw materials by powerful nations
 europe ke vibhinn deshon main audyogikaran ke parinamswaroop nagaron kii jansankhya main atyaadhik vruddhi hui
 Later, the establishment of colonies was also encouraged to settle the surplus population
 europavaasiyon ko vyapaarik pragati evam naveen deshon se sampark ke falswaroop kai naveen vastuon kaa gyaan hua, aalu, tambaakoo, bhutta aadi kaa gyaan unhen purvi deshon ke saath sampark se hi hua
 He was also addicted to hot spices, sugar, coffee, rice etc
 pratikul jalwaayu ke kaaran ye sabhi vastuen europea deshon main ugaana sambhav na tha
 Therefore, the British wanted European experts to get such areas where they could be cultivated
 atah anukool jalwaayu vaale sthanon main upnivesh sthapana kii vichaardhaara ko bal mila
 Portugal and Spain established the early colonies as a result of geographical discoveries
 isse unki samruddhi main vruddhi hui
 Therefore, in view of their prosperity, other European countries also started colonizing in the craving for prosperity
 upniveshwaad kii marxvaadi vyakhyaayein bhi yah daawa karti ki unnisvin sadi kii america or european audyogic poonjeewaadi arthvyavasthaaon ke vikaas ke liye gair-poonjeewaadi samaajon kaa pratyaksh raajnneetik niyantran aavashyak tha
 In this context, Marxist scholars distinguish between colonialism before and after the rise of capitalism
 marks ne apni bharat sambandhi rachanaaon main upniveshwaad par khaas taur se vichaar kiya he
 Marx and Engels were of the view that controlling the colonies was necessary not only to grab markets and sources of raw materials, but also to overtake rival industrial nations
 upniveshwaad sambandhi marxvaadi vichaaron ko aage viksit karne kaa shrey roza luckjamburg or lenin ko jaataa he
 The Marxist perspective has also faced criticism
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki marks, roza or lenin ne apni thisis ke paksh main jo pramaan pesh kiye hai ve paryaapt nahin hai, kyonki unase audyogic kranti va poonjeewaad ke vikaas ke liye upniveshwaad kii anivaaryta sabit nahin hoti
 Secondly, Marxist analysis does not have sufficient study and understanding of colonized societies
 marks jis asian utpaadan pranali kii charchaa karte hai or roza jis kii shreniyon ko asian samaajon par aropit karti hai, unhen in samaajon ke itihaas ke gahan adhyayan ke aadhaar par bahut dur tak nahin khinchaa ja saktaa

 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments began to be understood by the people and the protest was reduced
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha
 This is a small conversation book teaching Sanskrit
 vibhinn vishyon par laghu vaakya sanskrit main diye gayi hai
 Their meanings are also given in Hindi
 sampoorn granth yahan yaa yahan padhein

 unka janm 12 may 1964 odisha main, puri ke nankera main hua tha
 He was elected to the eleventh, twelfth and fourteenth Odisha Legislative Assembly
 1999 main rajya ke sabase kam umr ke mantri, banaae gaye the or ghar, vigyaan, praudyogiki or samskruti vibhaagon kaa aayojan kiya
 Was the Chief Whip of the Congress Legislature Party of the 14th Legislative Assembly in 2009-2014
 khoj 1989 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 Creatures that do not have a spine are called invertebrates or invertebrates
 vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag aksheruki bhrunvigyaan kehalaata he jisamen aise praaniyon main bacchon ke janm ke aarambh par vichaar hota he
 Invertebrates are divided into 15–16 categories, however, their embryology proves that this division is only extraterrestrial and that there is an inherent correlation between beings, especially in embryos, through which evolution is confirmed
 praaniyon kii vibhannata unke vaataavaran or tadnusaar unki jeevanapaddati ke kaaran hoti he
 According to this theory, all beings can be divided into only two divisions
 ek to aadyamukhi or doosraa dwitiyamukhi
 Both these branches belong to the sacrum class
 isse yahi siddh hota he ki praaniyon ke vikaas main aadyamukhi pehle bane or uske pashchaat dwitiyamukhi
 All vertebrates evolved from the Second River
 adhiktar praaniyon main nar or maadaa pruthak hote hai
 Males produce sperm and females lay eggs
 in donon ke sanyog se baccha paidaa hota he
 But there are also many low-class animals in which males and females have no discernment and do not give sperm or eggs
 inaki vruddhi inke saare sharir ke dwivibhaajan, yaa ankuran, yaa bijaen nirmaan dwaara hoti he
 From these, two such beings are combined for a short time in some of the more advanced beings and thereafter increase the lineage by division again
 inase bhi adhik unnat praaniyon main dekha jaataa he ki do pruthak praani ek duusare se sampurna rup se sanyukt ho jate hai or unki pruthak satta nahin rah jaati
 After such a coincidence, there is then an increase of dynasty by division and rebuttal
 aise praani eckoshin shrenee ke hai jinka sara sharir keval ek hi kosh kaa bana hota he
 But there are also some who take the shape of sperm and eggs like high-grade animals, and after the combination of these two, rebuttal and division is practiced
 eckoshikeey ke sharir kii, ek hi kosh hone ke kaaran, vruddhi main keval kosh ke aaytan main vruddhi hoti he
 But in Naikkoshin beings, body growth is gradual
 is praarambhik vardhansheel avasthaa main ye bhrun kehalaate hai or purnataa praapt karne ke purv unamem bahut parivartan hota he
 The embryo also belongs to the same cell in its initial stage, although it is a conjunctiva of two different cells, the sperm and the egg, called the zygote
 yah yugmaj kramash: bhedan dwaara bahukoshi banataa he, parantu eckoshinon se isaki bhijhata isi main he ki vibhajit kosh puthak nahin ho jate
 The progress and formulation of these new shells takes place on two confronting methods
 kuch praaniyon main in nae koshon kaa bhavishya bahut hi praarambhik kaal main nirdhaarit ho jaataa he, jisase yah nishchit ho jaataa he ki ve kin kin angon kii sristi karenge
 This method is called special variation or kuttimachitra development
 aise ek vibhaajansheel andey ko do samaan bhaagon main vibhakt karne par prayek khand us praani kii keval ardhang hi bana saktaa he
 In the second method, the organs are not fixed in the first stage and by dividing such eggs into two parts, though they become smaller in volume, each part makes up the whole animal
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko anishyit athwa viniamak bhedan kehete hai
 But after a period of time, the future of the shells in these is determined like the first method and at that time the animal does not become full when the eggs are split
 saadharantaya andon ke andar khadyapadaarth pitak ke rup main sanchit rahata he
 The growing fetus is confirmed by the pups
 andey ke bheetar pitak kaa vitaran mukhyat: teen prakaar kaa hota he
 In the first, the quantity of the Pitak is very small and it is equally spread in all the eggs
 aise andey ko apiti kehete hai
 In the second type, the quantity of the pupa is very high and it is collected in the lower part of the egg
 aise andey ko ekat:piti kehete hai
 In the third type, the pupil is situated in the central part of the egg
 aise andey ko cendrapati kehete hai
 According to the quantity and position of the egg, the egg is divided into different types
 pitak vibhaajan kriya main baadhak hota he
 The undigested eggs are completely differentiated
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko purnabhedan kehete hai
 But due to aggregation of the lower part of the egg in the beaten eggs, the upper part of the egg remains pure and active and the division process remains tied only in the upper part
 neeche kaa bhaag praarambhik kaal main vibhajit nahin hota
 Such partial partitioning system is called incomplete penetration
 jahaan pitak andey ke centresthal main rahata he vahaan vibhaajan kriya keval paridhi par aavddh rahati he
 Such a partition system is called overdevelopment
 adhiktar andon main sakriy upree bhaag or apekshaakrit niskriy nimna bhaag pehle se hi pratyaksh ho jaataa he- upree bhaag ko praani dhruv kehete hai or neeche ke bhaag ko vegetative athwa wegital pole kehete hai
 The division of eggs varies according to different types of symmetries
 dwiparshv samamiti main pratham vibhaajan rekha kharbooze kii dhari kii tarah hoti he, jiske falswaroop do kosh banate hai
 These two shells create the south and left sides of the body
 donon parshwo main samaan rup se vibhaajan hota rahata he
 The characteristic of triangular symmetry is that the dividing lines always intersect each other with vertical lines and the cells grow uniformly around the axis
 iske atirikt ek teesri reeti bhi hoti he jisamen vibhaajan rekha vakr hoti he or kram se ek baar dahini ore ko or duusari baar bain ore ko jhuki rahati he
 Such a system is known as the Kuntal penetrations, but their end result is bilateral symmetry
 dvayar samamiti main pratham vibhaajan dwiparshv hota he, par iske pashchaat donon parshwo main trijya samamiti kii pratha prachlit hoti he
 The division takes place at a rapid pace - the number of cells increases, but they become smaller in volume
 ant main bahukoshwala ek golakaar bhrun banataa he jisko ekabhitika kaha jaataa he
 The new shells are all on the periphery of this sphere and in the middle there is a cavity filled with lymph
 is vivar ko ekabhiktika guha kehete hai
 Such a hollow monocular is called a cavity monocular
 isaki bahari diwaar main keval ek hi kosh kii gaharaai hoti he
 Due to the accumulation of the pituks downwards in the solitary eggs, the monocyte cavity is formed upwards
 vibhaajan keval andey ke upar hi, jahaan pitak kii maatra atyadhik hoti he
 Remains bound and the ecliptic cavity is formed in a very brief form
 is prakaar kii ekabhiktika ko bimbakabhiktika kehete hai
 In eggs in which the pupil lives medially, the division is only in the periphery
 aisi ekabhiktika ko paryacbhiktika kehete hai
 In some beings, the monotony is solid and the shells are filled even inside the circle
 aisi sthiti main ekabhiktika ko sandracbhiktika bhittika athva tuut kehete hai
 The mukhadwar is formed in the monocular position in the cavities, due to which such monocularity is called mukhakabhiktika
 anya shrenee ke praaniyon main aisa nahin hota
 The embryo is called as porous until one layer is made of two layers, respectively
 duusari part kai vibhijh paddatiyon se banati he
 The simplest system is in the apoptotic eggs
 isamen ekabhiktika kaa nimna bhaag, vardhdhriv, kramash: ekabhiktika guha ke andar pravesh karata he
 And finally the inner layer joins the outer layer
 ekabhiktika guha kaa astitv nahin rah jaataa or uske sthaan main ek doosraa vivar banataa he jo ab do parto se dhakaa rahata he
 This hole is open due to a hole in the bottom
 is chhidr ko aadyantrmukh kehete hai
 This system of becoming porous is called the practice of inwardness or emboli
 bahari part ko bahi:str or bhitari part ko ant:str kehete hai
 From the inner level, the digestive system of these animals and all the organs produced from it develop
 is kaaran ant:str se veshtit vivar ko aadyantr kehete hai
 In most unorthodox beings, the Adyantramukh is the director of their forearms and their mouth is formed at or near it
 aise praaniyon ko aadyamukhi kehete hai
 On the contrary, in all the angels and some non-destructive beings, there is a directive of the posterior part of the Adyantmukh creature where the anus is made
 aise vipareetapanthi praaniyon ko dwitiyamukhi kehete hai
 In the eggs in which the pupil is more plentiful and the unicellular cavity is very short, the uppermost cell divides at a rapid rate and propagates over the space of the lower caudate filled with increasing, respectively
 is tarah neeche kii ore do parte banati hai
 This system is called extrapolation
 bimbekabhiktika main pitak atyadhik hone ke kaaran nae kosh keval upree bhaag main banate hai or unamem se kuch kosh alag hokar pehali part ke neeche aa jate hai
 Such a system is called segregation

 In Buddhist philosophy, the meaning of Namajatyadhyasutam has been considered as a word, refuting the general
 nyaayamimasaa darshanon main kaha gaya he ki bhashaa saamaanya yaa jaati ke bina nahin rah sakati
 If there is a different word for each person, the behavior of the language will be destroyed
 anekta main ekatv vyavhaar bhashaa kii pravriti kaa mul he or isi ko tathvik drushti se saamaanya kaha jaataa he
 Not only language, but the field of knowledge also has general importance because if one knowledge is considered separate from other knowledge, then there will be no correlation between multiple knowledge of the same object
 atev saamaanya yaa jaati ko anek vyaktiyon main rahanevaali ek nity satta mana gaya he
 This power is the reason for the behavior of language and this is also the meaning of language
 baudhon ke anusaar sabhi padaarth kshanik hai at: ve saamaanya kii satta nahin maanate
 If it is normal then how does it live in many people? If the normal is regular then what happens to the common person living in the destroyed substance? Therefore, it is not related to any other thing, but a special entity in itself is called Svalakshana
 anek swalakshan padaarthon main hi agyaan ke kaaran ekta kii mithyaa pratiti hoti he or chunki lokvyavahaar ke liye aisi pratiti kii aavashyaktaa he isliye saamaanya lakshan padaarth vyaavhaarik satya to hai kintu parmarthat: ve asat hai

 There are three levels of development of the theory of dialysis
 dinnag ke anusaar shabdon kaa arth anyaabhaav maatr hota he
 Shantarakshit said that the word makes sense of emotional meaning, its distinction from other is known from Oha
 ratnakirti ne anya ke bhed se yukt shabdaarth mana
 These three principles at least consider the distinction from the others to be semantics
 yahi apohawaad kii visheshta he
 Regarding word and meaning relation, Buddhist's opinion is called as apolitical, the father of this opinion is considered Diddnag, the proponent of Buddhist justice, he presents the concept of non-religion in the fifth passage of his proof, Apohi means prohibition of different from object
 
 jaise gau kaa arth he agau kaa nishedh, baudhdho kaa yah apohawaad unke tathvik, taarkik chintan kii parinti he
 Buddhists have established in their thinking that no object has any eternal or absolute power, whatever is true is transient, in such a situation the question arises when there is no stable form of any object
 Then whom is the indicated meaning of a word to be considered and why should it be considered when we look at something like a cow and say that it is a cow, then before pronouncing the word, the object of the object communicated As changes can not be directed st object word file this case
 vastu sat swalakshan he jo gyaata gyey bhed se rahit tathaa nirviklpak he
 The normal form of the object is directed by the word with the suffixes / suffixes produced by the word itself
 This direction is always in prohibition when we say that 'it is a cow, then the word cow here shows the lack of those things
 Who is not a cow apoh ke do rup maane gaye he 1 paryudas rup jo bhavatmak he 2 prasajya pratishedh jo nishedhaatmak he didnag ne shabd buddha ke sanrdabh me prasajya pratishedh ko hi shabd kaa vachya arth mana tha bhavatmak maanas biban kii kalpana unhone shabd ke vachya arth ke rup m nahin kii thi
 Shantarakshita accepts this 1 yahan kisi ek shabd se sanketit vastu ko jaanane ke liye asankhya vastuon kaa nishedh karnaa aavashyak hota he sabhi kaa nishedh karne hetu unka gyaan hona chahie jo ki asambhav he 2 If we believe in apophatism, it will become difficult to explain knowledge in practical life
 kisi balak ko hathi dikhaakar itnaa bataanaa kaaphi he ki yah hathi he yaha dohare nishedh kii aavashyakta nahin he In fact, the purpose of descentism is to remove the tendency of language in which we accept the external objects according to the words, according to which the form of the word \ meaning is composed by humans

 "your luck is your road" Development is weighty, long, wide and stunning, the development of the village becomes dazzling, once the development comes, it keeps coming but there is a quality of development
 Not by Jhadeo and Tote Rasto, we Ali village residents should raise demand for Aali road, this demand will be the first step in making Aali a plush as 1650 poor people with an investment of 1 crore on roads
 c poverty tend to rise above the line! aali mitra mandali No matter how far we live but remain in unity, for unity we should form a group

 yashwantrao holkar tukoji holkar kaa putr tha
 Despite being defiant he was a very courageous and efficient commander

 As a result, the Second anglo-maratha War broke out

 At first Ta Yashwantrao conquered Monson, but he was defeated in Farrukhabad and Deeg
 falswaroop use angrejon se sandhi sthapit kerani padi ant main, purna veikshiptavastha main, tees varsh kii aayu main uski mrityu ho gai 
 An Indian ruler who single-handedly forced the British to chew nuts
 iklauta aisa shaasha, jiskaa khauf angrejon main saaf-saaf dikhataa tha
 The only ruler with whom the British were willing to compromise unconditionally
 ek aisa shaasha, jise apano ne hi baar-baar dhokhaa diya, phir bhi jang ke maidan main kabhi himmat nahin haari
 The Indian ruler was so great, yet he is lost somewhere in the pages of history
 uske bare main aaj bhi bahut logon ko jaankaree nahin he
 His name is unknown to the people even today
 us mahaan shaasha kaa naam he - yashwantrao holkar
 This is the name of that great heroism, which has been compared by the famous historian NS Inamdar to 'napoleon'
 pashchim madhyapradesh kii malwa riyasat ke maharaj yashwantrao holkar kaa bharat kii aazaadee ke liye kiya gaya yogadan maharana pratap or jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai se kahin kam nahin he
 Yashwatrao Holkar was born in 1776 AD
 inke pita the - tukojirao holkar
 Due to the growing influence of the Holkar Empire, Daulatrao Scindia, the ruler of Gwalior, put Yashwantrao's elder brother Malharrao to death
 is ghatana ne yashwantrao ko puri tarah se tod diya tha
 They lost faith in their loved ones
 iske baad unhone khud ko majboot karnaa shuru kar diya
 He was very clever and brave in his work
 iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1802 i
 main inhone pune ke peshwa bajirao dwitiya va sindhiya kii milijuli sena ko maat di or indore waapas aa gaye
 During this time, the British were spreading their feet fast in India
 yashavanth raav ke saamne ek nai chunauti saamne aa chuki thi
 To liberate India from the clutches of the British
 iske liye unhen anya bhartiya shaskaon kii sahaayta kii jarurat thi
 They wanted to stop the growing British empire
 iske liye unhone nagpur ke bhonsle or gwalior ke sindhiya se ekbar phir haath milaayaa or angrejon ko khadedane kii thaanee
 But due to old enmity, Bhonsle and Scindia betrayed him again and Yashwantrao once again fell alone
 unhone anya shaskaon se ekbar phir ekajute hokar angrejon ke khilaaf ladane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin kisi ne unki baat nahin maani
 After this he decided to remind the British of the milk of the sixth on his own
 8 june 1804 i
 ko unhone angrejon kii sena ko dhul chataayee
 Then on 8 July 1804 AD, he drove the British out of Kota
 11 sitambar 1804 i
 ko angrej general velesle ne lord ljuk ko likhaa ki yadi yashwantrao par jaldi kaabo nahin paaya gaya to ve anya shaskaon ke saath milakar angrejon ko bharat se khaded denge
 In view of this, in November 1804 AD, the British attacked Dig
 is yuddh main bharatpur ke maharaj ranjit singh ke saath milakar unhone angrejon ko unki nani yaad dilaai
 Not only this, according to history, he had cut off the nose of 300 British
 achaanak ranjit singh ne bhi yashwantrao kaa saath chhod diya or angrajon se haath mila liya
 After this, Scindia shook hands with Yashwantrao's bravery
 angrejon kii chintaa bad gai
 Lord Luke wrote that Yashwantrao's army takes great pleasure in killing the British
 iske baad angrejon ne yah faisla kiya ki yashwantrao ke saath sandhi se hi baat sanbhal sakati he
 Therefore an unconditional treaty should be made with them
 unhen jo chahie, de diya jaae
 All the empire they have, all should be returned
 iske baavjood yashwantrao ne sandhi se inkaar kar diya
 They were engaged in uniting all the rulers
 ant main jab unhen safalataa nahin mili to unhone duusari chaal se angrejon ko maat dene kii sochi
 In view of this, he made a treaty with the British in 1805 AD
 angrejon ne unhen swatantra shaasha mana or unke saare kshetra lautaa die
 After this, he along with Scindia made another plan to drive out the British
 unhone sindhiya ko khat likhaa, lekin sindhiya dagebaaj nikle or vah khat angrejon ko dikhaa diya
 After this, the whole matter worsened again
 yashwantrao ne hallaa bol diya or angrejon ko akele dam par maat dene kii puri taiyaari main jute gaye
 For this, he opened an ammunition factory in Bhanpur
 isbaar unhone angrejon ko khadedane kii thaan lee thi
 Therefore, they were busy working day and night
 lagaataar mehnat karne ke kaaran unka swasthya bhi girane laga
 But he did not pay attention to this and he went to heaven on 28 October 1811 AD at the age of just 35 years
 is tarah se ek mahaan shaasha kaa ant ho gaya
 a ruler over whom the British could never accumulate authority
 ek aise shaasha kaa jinhone apni choti umr ko jang ke maidan main jhonk diya
 If the Indian rulers had supported them, perhaps the picture would have been different, but this did not happen and a great ruler Yashwantrao Holkar was lost and lost his bravery in the pages of history, which remains unknown today

 riyaad praant, jise aupchaarik arabi main mintaqaah aar-riyaad kehete hai, saudi arab ke madhya najd kshetra main sthit praant he
 It is the second largest province by population and is also the second largest by area
 saudi arab kii rashtriya rajdhani riyaad shahar bhi isi praant main sthit he or 75% prantiy aabaadi isi shahar main rahati he
 According to the 2004 census, 31% of the province's population were non-saudi foreigners and most of them lived in the city of Riyadh
 'riyaad' ko arabi lipi main 'رياض ' likhaa jaataa he jiskaa antim akshar 'ض ' bhartiya upmahadweep, afghanistan or iran main 'za' kaa uccharan rakhata he, jabaki arab deshon main iskaa uccharan 'da' yaa 'dha' se miltaa-julata kiya jaataa he

 They are close to Prajiv but such a division seems artificial and unfair

 The Dadhikikul Brahmanpita Atharvavivah Gbhasthinisantan Pippaladvishka After giving up the body by Dadhichi, the gods handed over his womb to Peepal before his wife became a sati, due to which the boy's name was 'pippalad'
 yask ke matanusaar dadhichi kii mata 'chitti' or pita 'atharva' the, isiilie inkaa naam 'dadhichi' hua tha
 According to some Puranas, he was the son of Atharva, born from the womb of the daughter 'shanti' of Kardam

 Their behavior was satisfied even to the animals and birds of the forest where they lived
 ganga ke tat par hi unka ashram tha
 Whatever guest came to the ashram of Maharishi Dadhichi, Maharishi himself and his wife served the guest with full reverence
 yun to 'bhartiya itihaas' main kai dani hue hai, kintu maanav kalyaan ke liye apni asthiyon kaa daan karne vaale maatr maharishi dadhichi hi the
 Knowing from the mouth of the gods that the Asuras can be killed only by the thunderbolt made from the bones of Dadhichi, Maharishi Dadhichi gave up his body and donated the bones
 parichaylok kalyaan ke liye aatm-tyaag karne waalon main maharishi dadhichi kaa naam bade hi aadar ke saath liya jaataa he
 According to Yask, Dadhichi's mother was 'chitti' and father was 'atharva', hence his name was 'dadhichi'
 kisi puraana ke anusaar yah kardam rishi kii kanya 'shanti' ke garbh se utpann atharva ke putr the
 According to other Puranas, he was the son of Shukracharya
 maharishi dadhichi tapasya or pavitrataa kii pratimurti the
 He had unwavering devotion and devotion to Lord Shiva since his birth
 kathakaha jaataa he ki ek baar indralok par 'vritrasur' naamak rakshas ne adhikaar kar liya tathaa indra sahit devataaon ko devloak se nikaal diya
 All the gods took their agony to Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, but no one could diagnose their problems
 baad main brahma ji ne devataaon ko ek upaay bataaya ki prithvi lok main 'dadhichi' naam ke ek maharishi rahete hai
 If they donate their bones, then a thunderbolt should be made from those bones
 us vajra se vritrasur maaraa ja saktaa he, kyonki vritrasur ko kisi bhi astr-shastr se nahin maaraa ja saktaa
 That Brahm is fast in Maharishi Dadhichi's ashes, from which the Vritrasura demon can be killed
 iske atirikt or koi doosraa upaay nahin he
 Indra's hesitation devraj indra maharishi dadhichi ke paas janaa nahin chaahate the, kyonki indra ne ek baar dadhichi kaa apmaan kiya tha, jiske kaaran ve dadhichi ke paas jane se kataraa rahe the
 It is believed that Maharishi Dadhichi was the only one who had knowledge of Brahmanism
 maharishi maatr vishisht vyakti ko hi is vidya kaa gyaan dena chaahate the, lekin indra brahm vidya praapt karne ke param icchhuk the
 Indra was not eligible for this education in Dadhichi's view
 isliye unhone indra ko is vidya ko dene se manaa kar diya
 On Dadhichi's refusal, Indra refused to give him this lesson to anyone else and said- "if you do this, i will tear your head off"
 maharishi ne kaha ki- "yadi unhen koi yogya vyakti milegaa to ve avashya hi brahm vidya use pradaan karenge
 "after some time, Ashwini Kumar reached Maharishi Dadhichi from Indraloka to take up theology
 dadhichi ko ashvinikumar brahm vidya paane ke yogya lage
 He told Ashwini Kumar about what Indra had said
 tab ashvinikumaron ne maharishi dadhichi ke ashv kaa sir lagaakar brahm vidya praapt kar lee
 When Indra got this information, he came to Prithvi Lok and according to his declaration Maharishi Dadhichi was beheaded
 ashvinikumaron ne maharishi ke asli sir ko phir se laga diya
 Indra expelled the Ashwini Kumaras from Indralok
 yahi kaaran tha ki ab indra maharishi dadhichi ke paas unki asthiyon kaa daan maangane ke liye aana nahin chaahate the
 He was very hesitant for this task
 dadhichi dwaara asthiyon kaa daan The atrocities of the Vritrasura demon on Devlok were increasing day by day
 vah devataaon ko bhaanti-bhaanti se pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 Ultimately, Devraj Indra had to go to the shelter of Maharishi Dadhichi along with the gods to protect Indraloka and for the good of the gods and to save his throne
 maharishi dadhichi ne indra ko puraa sammaan diya tathaa ashram aane kaa kaaran poocha
 Indra narrated his grief to Maharishi and Dadhichi said- "what can i do to protect Devlok
" " devataaon ne unhen brahma, vishnu va mahesh kii kahin hui baaten bataayin tathaa unki asthiyon kaa daan maanga
 Maharishi Dadhichi accepted the donation of his ashes without hesitation
 unhone samadhi lagaai or apni deh tyaag di
 His wife was not in the ashram at that time
 ab devataaon ke samaksh ye samasya ai ki maharishi dadhichi ke sharir ke maans ko koun utaare
 As soon as this work came to mind, all the gods were frightened
 tab indra ne kamdhenu gaay ko bulaayaa or use maharishi ke sharir se maance utaarne ko kaha
 Kamdhenu licked the flesh of Maharishi's body with his tongue
 ab keval asthiyon kaa pinjar rah gaya tha
 Stubbornness maharishi dadhichi ne to apni deh devataao kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag di, lekin jab unki patni 'gabhastini' waapas ashram main ai to apane pati kii deh ko dekhakar vilaap karne lagi tathaa sati hone kii jid karne lagi
 Then the gods refused her a lot, because she was pregnant
 devataaon ne unhen apane vansh ke liye sati na hone kii salaah di
 But she did not listen
 tab sabhi ne unhen apane garbh ko devataaon ko saunpane kaa nivedan kiya
 At this Gabbathini agreed and surrendered her womb to the Gods and became Sati herself
 devataaon ne gabhastini ke garbh ko bachaane ke liye pipal ko uskaa laalan-paalan karne kaa daayitv saunpa
 After some time, she was born and conceived, and because of the upbringing by Peepal, she was named 'piplad'
 isi kaaran dadhichi ke vanshaj 'dadhich' kehalaate hai

 Schwah deletion is a response in which it is necessary to discard the sound of shwa contained in the consonants of their scripts for correct pronunciation in Hindi, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Maithili and many other modern indo-aryan languages
 yah vilopan karnaa un bhashaaon ke maatrubhaashiyon ke dwaara samajhe jane ke liye or bolne vaale kaa lahaza sahi prathit hone ke liye bahut zaruri he
 Without this autopsy, the reader either seems unambiguously non-lingual or may have difficulty understanding it
 shwa vilopan computer dwaara likhit samagri ko padhane main or bhashaaon ko seekhney waalon ke liye chunauti hoti he kyonki in bhashaaon kii lipiyaan aksar yah spasht nahin karti ki shwa kahan rakhana chahie or kahan tyaagna chahie
 The Devanagari script is used to write modern Hindi, in which the sound of 'A' is added if there is no halant formally at the end of each consonant
 lekin hindi ke sahi uccharan ke liye hindi kaa 'shwa vilopan niyam' kahata he ki shabdon ke ant main or kuch or paristhitiyon main aksar yah shwa hataa diya jaataa he
 It is sometimes written as: 'a -> ø | Vowel consonant _vision vowel '
 iskaa arth he ki agar lipi ke anusaar kisi swar ke uparant aane vaale vyanjan ke baad shwa aata he or uske baad ek vyanjan aata he jiske peeche bhi ek swar laga ho, to us bich ke shwa ko tyaag diya jaataa he
 For example, if you look at the word 'dragon', it is 'A + j + a + g + a + r + A' but at the end of the word 'A' and between 'A + J' and 'G + A'
 a 'both are removed, due to which the correct Hindi pronunciation of the word' Ajgar 'is' Azgar'
 aksar yah baat angreji main lipyaantaran karne main spasht ho jaati he
 If we look at the city of Patna, according to the script it is 'p + a + t + a + n + a', which will be written 'patanā' in English
 lekin shwa vilopan niyam bich kaa shwa hataa detaa he, isliye vastav main sahi uccharan 'p+a+t+n+aa' he, yani 'pat
nā'
 Similarly 'uttar Pradesh' should be 'uttara pradesha' if it is seen as per formal script, but due to Schwah elimination it becomes 'uttar pradesh'
 dhyaan dijiye ki shwa vilopan ke kaaran kuch aksharon ke guton kaa uccharan unki shabd main paristhiti ke anusaar badal jaataa he
 The pronunciation of 'saral' is 'S + a + o + a + L', in which the ending is deleted
 lekin 'sarala' main niyamanusaar bich ke 'r' kaa 'a' hataa diya jaataa he, yani 's+a+r+l' 
 Similarly, in 'spinach' and 'palanquin', the middle 'L' is placed first but removed from the second word
 usee tarah 'dil kii dhadkane' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadkane' he, yani 'd' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 But in 'dil Dhadak Laga' the correct pronunciation of 'dhadakne' is 'dhadakne', ie this time the breath of 'D' was kept but the body of 'A' was removed
 hindi ke maatrubhaashi in shabdon ko bina soche aaraam se sahi uccharit karte hai, lekin gair-matibhashiyon or computaron ke liye yah kathinaayee paidaa karte hai
 Often their wrong pronunciation makes their speech 'strange' and 'hard to understand for the hearer'

 Armor valves open and close through the muscular system
 hinj rekha peeche or praavaar guhika aage hoti he
 Upon opening the armor, it appears that most of the space is surrounded by an intricately composed organ, called a lophophore

 This slot is surrounded by a continuous lip in the page and a line of tangents in the balance
 khaanchaa bahut badha rahata he or iske donon kinare do baahuon kaa rup le lete hai
 This arm is usually spiral
 sparshak lambey hote hai or qavach kii daraar se baahar nikal sakate hai
 The nectaries on the surface of the tentacles and the cavity produce two streams of water going in the opposite direction of the two arms of the lophophore by their orbit motion
 baahar nikalne vaali jal kii dhara donon baahuon ke madhya main hoti he
 Inside the shell, each of the above two streams passes between the tentacles of the lophophore, where the light foods floating in the water are filtered
