 kintu kuch darshanik bhashadarshan ko alag vishay ke rup main na lekar, ise tarkshastra kaa hi ek ang maanate hai
 In India, the idea of the philosophical and epistemological aspects of language started from far ancient times
 vyakaran kii rachana ke liye anek paribhaashik shabdon kaa aashray lenaa padaa
 Different forms of language were analyzed through words such as name, famous prefix, nipat, verb, gender, vow, inflection, suffix etc
 gaharaa chintan, sookshm vichaar or satya ke anveshan kii paddati ko darshan kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, language analysis also got the level of philosophy

 Hundreds of words such as divination, method, order, abrogation, subhuman, gender, adverb, chronology, vipsa, countertransference, gesture, semantics used by Panini symbolize that he was fully aware of the philosophical promises of those days and himself was of the highest order
 The philosophers were thinkers

 As an example, we can look at the following formulas: - sach to yah he parvarti bhashadarshan chintakon ke liye panini pramanbhoot acharya hai
 Subsequent grammars have endorsed some ideas related to grammar to Panini's formulas in some way

 Konark Surya Mandir is revered in the city of Puri under Puri district of the state of Orissa in India
 yah bharatvarsh ke chuninda surya mandiron main se ek he
 In 1984, UNESCO has recognized it as a World Heritage Site
 yah mandir surya-dev arthath arq ko samarpit tha, jinhen sthaneey log biranchi-narayan kehete the
 For this reason, this region was called ark-kshetra or padma-kshetra
 puraanon ke anusaar shrikrishna ke putr samb ko unke shraap se kodh rog ho gaya tha
 Samb did penance for twelve years in Konark at the ocean confluence of the Chandrabhaga river at Mitravan and pleased the Sun God
 suryadev, jo sabhi rogon ke naashak the, ne iske rog kaa bhi nivaaran kar diya tha
 Accordingly, Samb decided to build a temple of the Sun God
 apane rog-naash ke uparaant, chandrabhaga nadi main snaan karte hue, use suryadev kii ek murti mili
 This idol was made by Devashilpi Sri Vishwakarma from the same part of Suryadev's body
 samb ne apane banawaaye mithravan main ek mandir main, is murti ko sthapit kiya, tab se yah sthaan pavitra mana jane laga
 It is the opinion of many historians that due to the premature death of King Langul Narsinghdeva, the builder of the Konark temple, the construction work of the temple fell into disrepair
 iske parinamswaroop, adhuraa dhaancha dhwast ho gaya
 But this view is not supported by historical figures
 puri ke madal panji ke aankadon ke anusaar or kuch 1278 i
 ke tamrapatron se pataa chalaa, ki raja langool nrisinghdev ne 1282 tak shashan kiya
 Many historians are also of the opinion that the Konark temple was built between 1253 to 1260 AD
 atev mandir ke apurna nirmaan kaa iske dhwast hone kaa kaaran hona tarksangat nahin he
 It is no less than a complex task to mention the entire reasons for the demolition of the temple here
 parantu yah sarvavidit he ki ab iskaa kaaphi bhaag dhwast ho chukaa he
 The main reason for this is also called Vastu Dosh, but the role of Muslim invasions has been important
 kaha jaataa he ki yah mandir apane vaastu dosha ke kaaran maatr 800 varshon main ksheen ho gaya tha
 Which is heard and heard against Vastu art and rules
 isi karanvash yah apni samyavadhi se pehle hi rugavedakaal evam pashaan kala kaa anupam udhaaharan hote hue bhi dharashayi ho gaya
 The main architectural defects of this Sun-temple are: -
 kai kathaon ke anusaar, surya mandir ke shikhar par ek chumbakeey pathar laga he
 As a result of this, the ocean ships passing through the sea of konark are drawn towards this, causing heavy damage to them
 anya katha anusaar, is pathar ke kaaran poton ke chumbakeey disha nirupan yantra sahi disha nahin bataate
 For this reason, Muslim sailors took out this stone to save their grandsons
 yah pathar ek kendriya shila kaa kaary kar rahaa tha, jisase mandir kii deevaaron ke sabhi pathar santulan main the
 Due to its removal, the balance of the temple walls was lost and as a result they collapsed
 parantu is ghatana kaa koi aitihaasik vivaran nahin miltaa, naa hi aise kisi chumbakeey kendriya pathar ke astitv kaa koi byora uplabdh he
 a very important theory related to the fall of Konark temple is associated with Kalapahad
 urisa ke itihaas ke anusaar kalapahaad ne san 1508 main yahaan akraman kiya or konark mandir samet urisa ke kai hindu mandir dhwast kar diye
 Madan Panji of the Jagannath temple in Puri tells how Kalapahar attacked Orissa
 konark mandir sahit usne adhikansh hindu mandiron kii pratimaayein bhi dhwast kareen
 Although it was impossible to break the 20-25 feet thick walls of the Konark temple, he somehow managed to shake Dadhinauti, which caused the temple to collapse
 dadhinauti ke hatane ke kaaran hi mandir dhire-dhire girane laga tathaa chat se baari pathar girane se, mukashaala kii chat bhi dhwast ho gayi
 He also demolished most of the sculptures here and many other temples in Konark
 san 1568 main urisa main muslimon kaa aatank niyantran main ho chukaa tha
 But even after this, there were continuous efforts to break the Hindu temples
 is samay puri ke jagannatha mandir ke pandon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ji kii murti ko shrimandir se hataakar kisi gupt sthaan par chupa diya tha
 Similarly, the pandas of the Sun Temple of Konark removed the idol of the presiding deity and kept it hidden in the sand for years
 baad main, yah murti puri bhej di gayi or vahaan jagannatha mandir ke praangan main sthit, indra ke mandir main rakh di gayi
 According to others, the worship idols here are still to be discovered
 lekin kai logon kaa kahana he, ki surya dev kii murti, jo nai dilli ke rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he, vahi konark kii pradhan poojya murti he
 Yet in Konark, Surya Vandana ceased after the removal of the idol from the temple
 is kaaran konark main tirthayatriyon kaa aana janaa band ho gaya
 Konark's port also closed due to bandits attack
 konark surya vandana ke samaan hi vanijyik gatividhiyon hetu bhi ek kirtivan nagar tha, parantu in gatividhiyon ke band ho jane ke kaaran, yah ekadam nirvasit ho chalaa or varshon tak ek gahan jangal se dhank gaya
 In 1626, the king of Khurda, Narasimha Dev, son Shri Purushottam Dev, took the idol of Suryadev to Puri along with two other statues of Surya and Chandra
 ab ve puri ke mandir ke praangan main milti hai
 It is known from the history of the Madal Register of Puri that in 1028, King Naseenhadeva ordered the measurement of all the temples of Konark
 maapan ke samay, surya mandir apni amalak shila tak astitv main tha, yani ki lagbhag 200 feet ooncha
 Kalapahad destroyed not only its urn, but also the padma-dhwaja, kamal-kirit and the upper part
 pehle bataaye anusaar, mukhshala ke saamne, ek bada prastar khand – navagraha paat, hota tha
 The then king of Khurda removed that block, as well as took a number of sculpted stones from Konark
 or puri ke mandir ke nirmaan main unka prayog kiya tha
 In the Maratha period, Konark stones were used in the construction of the boundary wall of the temple of Puri
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he, ki nat mandir ke sabhi bhaag, sabase lambe kaal tak, apni mul avasthaa main rahe hai
 And in the Maratha period, they were deliberately broken as an unusable part
 san 1779 main ek maratha sadhu ne konark ke arun stambh ko hataa kar puri ke singhdwar ke saamne sthapit karvaa diya
 By the end of the eighteenth century, Konark lost all its glory and turned into a forest
 iske saath hi mandir kaa kshetra bhi jangal ban gaya, jahaan junglee jaanavar or daakuon ke adde the
 The locals here were also afraid to go till daylight
 konark shabd, 'kone' or 'arq' shabdon ke mail se bana he
 The meaning of the extract is sun while the angle must have been from the corner or edge
 prastut konark surya-mandir kaa nirmaan laal rang ke balua pattharon tathaa kaale grenite ke pattharon se hua he
 It was built in 1236–1264 BC by the erstwhile feudal king of Ganga Dynasty, Narasimhadeva
 yah mandir, bharat ke sabase prasiddh sthalon main se ek he
 It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984
 kaling style main nirmit is mandir main surya dev ko rath ke rup main virajman kiya gaya he tathaa pattharon ko utkrisht nakkashi ke saath ukera gaya he
 The entire temple site has been constructed with twelve pair of chakras pulled by seven horses, in which the sun god is shown seated
 parantu vartmaan main saaton main se ek hi ghoda bachaa hua he
 These twelve chakras define the twelve months of the year, giving beauty to the base of the temple and each chakra is made up of eight arrows, which represent the eight wheels of the day
 yahaan par sthaneey log prastut surya-bhagwaan ko biranchi-narayan kehete the
 The main temple is built in three pavilions
 inamen se do mandap dhah chuke hai
 In the third pavilion where the idol was, the British had filled the sand and stones before the Indian independence, and closed all the gates permanently so that the temple could not be damaged
 is mandir main surya bhagwaan kii teen pratimaayein hai: On its entry, two lions are shown to be aggressive in defense of elephants
 yah sambhavtah tatkaaleen brahman rupi singhon kaa buddha rupi haathiyon par varchasv kaa pratik he
 Both elephants are set on each human

9 feet wide and 9
2 feet high by 28 tons

 They are 10 feet long and 7 feet wide

 There is a Nat temple at its entrance
 ye vah sthaan he, jahaan mandir kii nartakiyaan, suryadev ko arpan karne ke liye nrity kiya karatin thim
 The entire temple has carvings of flowers and geometric patterns
 inke saath hi maanav, dev, gandharva, kinnar aadi kii akrutiyaan bhi andrik mudraon main darshit hai
 His postures are sensual and derived from Kamasutra
 mandir ab anshik rup se khandhar main parivartit ho chukaa he
 a collection of artifacts here is preserved in the Sun Temple Museum of the Archaeological Survey of India
 mahaan kavi va naatakaar ravindra nath tagore ne is mandir ke bare main likhaa he:- konark jahaan pattharon kii bhashaa manushya kii bhashaa se shreshthatar he
 The main Sun Temple of the thirteenth century is built in the form of a great chariot, with twelve pairs of wheels, drawn by seven horses
 yah mandir bharat ke utkrisht smarak sthalon main se ek he
 The architectural proportions here are devoid of defects and surprising dimensions
 yahaan kii sthapatyakala vaibhav evam maanviya nishtha kaa sauhardpurn sangam he
 Each inch of the temple is replete with unique beauty and artefacts of grace
 iske vishay bhi mohak hai, jo sahasron shilp akritiyaan bhagavaanon, devataaon, gandharvon, maanvon, vaadyakon, premi yugalon, darbar kii chhaviyon, shikaar evam yuddh ke chitron se bhari hai
 Among them are elaborate animals and birds and mythological creatures, besides fine and intricate bells and geometric patterns
 oriya shilpakala kii heere jaisi utkrusht gunvattta puure parisar main alag dikhaai detii he
 This temple is also famous for its sculptures with erotic postures
 is prakaar kii akritiyaan mukhyatah dwarmandap ke dwitiya str par milti hai
 The subject of these figures is shown in clear but very tenderness and rhythm
 jivan kaa yahi drushtikon, konark ke anya sabhi shilp nirmaanon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Thousands of human, animal and divine people are seen working in this life-like fair, in which there is a confluence of realism
 yah urisa kii sarvottam kriti he
 Its exquisite craftsmanship, carvings, and accurate display of animal and human figures prove it far superior to other temples

 The tradition of philosophy that emerged mainly from the Greek philosopher Aristotle
 san 1896 main zemaan ne sodium jwaala ko ek prabal vidyutchumbak ke do dhruvon ke madhya rakh kar uske prakaash kii jaanch kii or yah khoj nikaala ki varnakram kii donon teevr pili rekhaayen kuch chaudee ho gayi
 If the resolution of the spectroscope is too high, then each spectral line of a light source placed in a magnetic field is divided into several component lines
 is ghatana ko zemaan prabhaav kehete hai
 In 1892, Faraday tried unsuccessfully to see the same effect
 avasorak madhyam ko chumbakeey kshetra main rakhane par avashoshit rekhaon kaa ghatakon main vibhaajan hota he
 This is called the inverse Zeeman effect
 zemaan prabhaav dekhne ke liye varnakram rekhaon ko ek ucch vibhedak kshamtawale upkaran, jaise lumor-geharke patt or niyam vichlan varnakramalekhi ke yoga dwaara nirikshan kiya jaataa he
 An inspection of the magnetic field in the vertical direction gives a longitudinal view from the transverse view and inspection in the parallel direction
 anudairdhyadrishy ke liye chumbak ke ek dhruv ke madhya main chumbakeey kshetra ke samaantar ek naalee yaa surang kaa hona aavashyak he
 The Lorents interpreted it on the basis of their electron and radiation theory and predicted that these spectral lines should be polarized by the magnetic field
 anudairdhyadrishy main in rekhaon main vrittiya dhruvan or anuprasthadrishy main raikhik dhruvan hona chahie
 These predictions were verified by Zeman
 lorents ne apane siddhant dwaara yah dikhaaya ki prakaash kii varnakram rekha ko chumbakeey kshetra kii lambdisha main dekhne par teen ghatak rekhaayen drushtigochar honi chahie In the Zeman effect when only three component lines are seen at the above displacement, it is called Prakrit Zeman effect and the sample of those component lines is called Prakrit Trika or Lorents Trika
 parantu jab ek varnakram rekha kai adhik ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he, tab use aprakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai, kyonki uski vyakhya chir pratishthit siddhant ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati
 The Prakrit Zeman triad is special form and is represented by the spectral lines of the unit range, while the Lande coefficient of the initial and final energy state is equal to one
 saadhaaran lorents trik jasta or cadmium ke varnakramon main dekhe gaye tathaa unke aavritivisthaapan qdh or kt kii maap se e / m kaa pariman uparyukt sutara dwaara nikaala gaya, jo runagra kirnon dwaara nikaale hue e / m ke baraabar paaya gaya
 This result is the observed direction of rotation of circular polarity in unity and longitudinal view, evidence that radiation in the atomic spectrum emits by moving negative electric charge
 preston ne adhik vikshepan or vibhedan-kshamta vaale upkarnon ke prayog dwaara yah sthapit kiya ki usee varnakram rekhaon kii kisi vishisht shrenee kaa zemin-ghatak-rekhaon kaa namoona ek hi prakaar kaa hota he or us shrenee kaa lakshan hota he
 Thus the Zeman effect became the typical means of spectral analysis
 san 1907 main ruunge ne yah dikhaaya ki aprakrut zemaan namoonon kii ghatak rekhaon kaa visthaapan, prakrut trik rekhaon ke visthaapan gunanfal ke rup main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the p and s components will have displacement and Lorent units
 ke liye yah visthaapan lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 The Zeeman effect is seen only when the external magnet field is weaker than the internal field generated by the electron's ground and orbit motions; But when the external field is stronger than these internal regions, then the Zeeman effect becomes the western-back effect
 yah prabhaav san 1912 main pashchan or back ne dekha or yah paaya ki bahut adhik teevr chumbak kshetra main prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan trik main badal jaataa he
 That is why the zeman effect is the main tool for spectral analysis and to detect the electron formation of atoms and ions

 Xuanzang in India: The egg is the round or elliptical living thing that is produced by the female of many creatures
 adhikansh jaanwaron ke andon ke upar ek kathor aavaran hota he jo ande kii suraksha karata he
 Although eggs are the way for livestock to produce their offspring, but egg feeding is also useful
 poshak tatwon kii drushti se isamen protein evam choline bharpoor maatra main paye jate hai
 The sparrows' eggs of each species may have some variation, but have their own characteristics
 prayek jati ke pakshiyon ke andon kaa aakaar, maap or rang anoothaa hota he
 There is a correlation in the life, size, shape, surface composition and color of birds
 usee prakaar ek thok yaa samooh ke antargat andon kii sankhya or kisi ritu main thokon kii sankhya main ek sambandh hota he
 The measurement of an egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end
 saath saath andon ke nukile bhaag ghonsle ke madhya main kendrit ho jane or unka golakaar bhaag baahar kii ore hone se, yadi ghonsle main teen chaar andey hon to ve sabhi aasaani se ant jate hai
 The eggs of some sparrows are nearly spherical
 ullu ke andey golakaar or bataasi ke andey patale or donon chhoron par gol hote hai
 Some sparrows have smooth surfaces, some have shiny, some have very polished and some have rough and rough
 andon kaa rang bhi bhinn bhinn chidiyon main bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Some sparrows' eggs are white, but some eggs are colored, green, blue, brown, and lacy
 kuch ke andon kaa rang bilkul ek samaan hota he or kuch kaa chitkabara athwa chiththidaar
 The spots are in the form of spots, or rashes, and are small or excessive
 dhabbe andon kii sataha par samaan rup se bikhare ho sakate hai, athwa kisi bhaag main adhik or kisi bhaag main kam
 Some species of birds have individual differences in the color and markings of eggs of different members within the same caste
 andey kaa rang mukhya rup se rakshaatmak hota he
 Therefore, the color of eggs given on green branches is green and the color of eggs given on the ground is often brown
 kotor athwa bill ke andey praaia: safed hote hai, jisase pakshi andhere main bhi unka pataa laga sake
 Gilmatt and Razorbill lay only one egg, two species of Paravat or wild pigeon and Garuda, three different species of Dhomra or Gangchilli and four different species of Tittibha lay four eggs
 anek jatiyaan paanch chah andey tak detii he
 Eggs are found in small rhizomes of some songs from seven to eight to twelve
 shikaar kii kuch chidiyon or batakhon main isse bhi or adhik sankhya pai jaati he
 Most birds, if their eggs are stolen, or destroyed, or they are forced to abandon the eggs, lay eggs again, because every bird has a certain number of eggs
 jab tak yah sankhya puri nahin ho jaati, vah andey dena samaapt nahin karti
 Sparrows usually lay once in a season
 kuch gaanevaali chidiyaan ritukal main do yaa teen baar bhi bachche utpann karti hai
 Sparrows whose eggs and children are more destroyed, or who are young, have a faster reproduction and a greater number of eggs
 chidiyon kii aayu kaa bhi prabhaav unke andon kii sankhya par padataa he
 The first-to-date sparrows lay fewer eggs and the second or third-spawn sparrows lay more eggs
 andon kii sankhya jab puri ho jaati he, tab unka sena prarambh hota hai
 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night
 kuch jatiyon main keval maadaa hi andey seti hai, kintu aisi avasthaa main nar uske liye bhojan jutata he
 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn
 anda-seven-kaal main maadaa kaa dhyaan andey sene main kuch aisa lag jaataa he or usamen aisi ekaagratha utpann ho jaati he ki yadi koi uske andey ko hataakar anya koi vastu, jaise pathar ke tukade, rode ityadi, bhi rakh de to vah bina dekhe sune unpar baithkar unhen seti rahegi
 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period
 kabutaron main nar bade chaav se anda seta he he
 Not only this, but the female removes herself and sits on the eggs
 nar swayan nahin de saktaa, kintu santanprem kii abhilaashaa se vah kisi tarah maadaa ko rijhaakar joda band letaa he, maadaa se andey dilava letaa he or phir uske baad unke sene tathaa shishupaalan kii sari kriya swayan bade chaav se sampann karata he
 Lapland and Auk species have higher numbers of males, fewer females
 at: sabhi nar joda baandhane main safal nahin ho pate, par unki anda sene tathaa santan paalan kaa abhilaashaa dil se nahin jaati
 In contrast, there are some birds who serve eggs to others rather than themselves
 koyal, papiha aadi inamen mukhya hai, jo chori se apane andey kauwe, charkhi athwa satbhiye aadi ke ghonslon main rakh aate hai or unhen murkh banaakar unase dhatri kaa kaam lete hai
 There are some birds, which neither incubate the eggs themselves nor serve them to others, but cook and protect them from the heat of the sun
 shuturamurg naamak pakshi apni chaati kii ragad se gaddha taiyaar karata he or uske chaaron ore chonch se baaluu rakhkar diwaar si khadi kar letaa he
 Then in this, females, usually 20 to 30, lay eggs
 shaturamurg kii ek hi maadaa nahin hoti, ek nar kii kai patniyaan hoti hai or ye sabhi baari se isamen andey parti jaati hai
 After the laying of the eggs is complete, a small layer of sand is laid on them
 din bhar surya kii kirnon se ye andey garam rahete hai
 In the night, these birds sit on them and provide warmth to them
 kai pakshi aise hai, jo kisi ushn jal ke jharne ke sameep gadhe banaakar unamem andey dete hai, phir unhen dhakkar anyatra chale jate hai
 These eggs keep warm with the hot water of the spring
 samay puraa hone ke din ye lautakar aate hai or upar kii mitti ko hataa dete hai, phir bachche andey phodkar baahar chale aate hai
 Where there is extreme heat, the birds arrange to keep the eggs cold, not warm
 iske liye ve jal main apni chonch bhigo bhigokar unase andon ko bhigote rahete hai, taaki atyadhik taap ke kaaran unhen kshati na pahunche
 Seven times are also different among sparrows
 badi chidiyon main athwa un chidiyon main jinke bachche bhalee bhanti viksit hokar utpann hote hai, sevankaal lanbaa hota he
 In some, the intake period is of one month and in others it is less than two weeks
 kisi kisi pakshi ko maheene andey sete bitate hai
 It takes three weeks for the hen to hatch, four to the pheasant, five to the swan and two to the bird named Candor
 pakshiyon ke andey baahar die jate hai or bhrun kaa vikaas baahar ho andey ke andar hota he
 When the embryo is fully developed, the bird strikes repeatedly with its beak to come out of the egg-like prison and, according to race, in the middle of the egg, or any other wide site, there is a crack and the baby comes out
 Comes
 us samay vah ek taral padaarth se bhigaa hua sa rahata he, jo hawa lagane se sheeghra hi suukh jaataa he
 Children of chicken, pheasant, ostrich etc
 start running as soon as they come out, but babies of parrots, fowls and crows etc
 cannot open their eyes for several days
 ve ek nirih si avasthaa main pade rahete he tathaa hafton tak dhonsle main hi apane shishav ke din bitaate hai
 The first few weeks of the baby bird when coming out of the egg have some special difficulties and dangers
 in dinon vah na keval choti or kamjor hoti hai, balki praaia: swayan bhojan chugane main asamarth tathaa udne se bhi laachaar hoti he
 Infants of different species of birds are born in different conditions and on this basis they can be classified into the following two major categories: nidatyagi shishu kii ankhen janm se hi khuli hoti hai or inkaa sharir mulaayam paron se dhakaa hota he
 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge
 From the very beginning, they begin to feed themselves
 batakh or murgi ke shishu iske achche udhaaharan he
 Among wild birds, babies of tittibhas, hyacinths, ducks and other birds of prey do the same
 shikaar kii chidion main ek or visheshta yah hoti he ki ye sheeghra hi udne bhi lagati hai
 Nesting infants remain in the nest until they grow up after birth and have to depend completely on their parents for food
 ye janm ke samay andhe or asahaay hote hai tathaa adhikansh avasthaaon main kam yaa adhik nange; arthath paraheen evam ankarshak hote hai
 Batkhi, Kilkila; And the children of the green wood are born bare
 jalkaag tathaa bak aise pakshiyon kaa samooh he jinke bachche janmkaal main bilkul nange hote hai, arthath unke sharir par bahut kam par rahete hai
 The bird with which eggs hatch, also nurtures and protects their offspring with the same readiness
 santanraksha main bahudhaa dekha gaya he ki pakshi apane praan kii bhi chintaa nahin karte
 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly
 is tarah dushman ko ghonsle se dur le jaakar use pathbhrasht kar dete hai, jisase vah kisi or disha main chal de tathaa need ke shishuon par ai vipadaa is tarah tal jaae
 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others
 jab ve kabhi ghir jaati hai to mritat hokar jameen par let rahati hai, jise dekhanevaala unhen mrit samajhakar aage kii ore bad jaataa he
 Then they leave the ground soon and stand ahead
 kabhi-kabhi pakadi jane par bhi ye mritak hone kaa swaang bharti hai, taaki ham inhen mrit samajhakar chhod de

 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period but mainly Vedavas ji is considered the author of many Upanishads

 In order to fulfill the desire of Kalindi, Krishna married her

 Kavyanushasana distinguished him in the category of poets of high order
 purvaacharyo se bahut kach lekar parvarti vichaarkon ko chintan ke liye vipul saamagree pradaan kii
 There are three main parts of Kavyanushasana - sutra, interpretation and sodhasana vritti
 sutro kii vyakhya karne vaali vyakhya 'alankarchudamani' naam prachlit he
 And to clarify, a version called 'vivek' was written
 'kavyanushasan' 8 adhyyon main vibhajit 208 sutro main kavyashastra ke saare vishyon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 807 examples are presented in 'alankarchudamani' and 825 examples are presented in 'vivek'
 50 kaviyon ke tathaa 81 grantho ke namoka ullekh he
 Kavyanushasana is often a collection book
 rajasekharake 'kavyamimasaa', mammatke 'kavyprakash', aanandavardhan ke 'dhvanyalok', abhinav guptake 'lochan' se paryaapt matraamein saamagree grahan kii he
 Hemachandra is his independent opinion about originality
 hemchandra matse koi bhi granthkaar nayi cheez nahin likhata
 Although Mammatka is very much similar to Hemavandraka 'kavyanushasana' with 'kaviprakash'
 paryaapt sthanon par hemachandracharyane mammatka virodh kiya he
 According to Hemachandracharya, Anand, Yash and Kantulya preaching can only be poetic purposes and according to Hemachandra, according to Hemachandra, meaning, gain, knowledge and negative retirement are not poetic purposes
 'kavyanushasan se kavyashasre ke pathakon kon samajane main sulabhta, sugamawa hoti he
 Mammatka 'kaviprakash' is elaborate, well organized, not accessible
 aganit tikaaen hone par bhi mammatka 'kavyprakash' durgam rah jaataa he
 In 'kavyanushasan' this inaccessibility has been facilitated by 'alankarchudamani' and 'vivek'
 'kavyanushasan' main spasht likhte hai ki ve apana mat nirdhaaran abhinavgupt evam bharat ke aadhaar par kar rahe hai
 In fact, Hemachandra, presenting the quotation of other texts, is fundamental from his own independent opinion, style, approach
 granth evam granthkaaron ke naam se sanskrit-sahitya, itihaas par prakaash padataa he
 The best textbook for all levels of readers

 There is no specific difference between Jainism and Hinduism in general
 jain dharm vaidic karm - kand ke prathibandh evam us ke hinsa sambandhi vidhanokon sweekaar nahin karata
 Acharya Hemchandra's philosophy work 'pramanamamsa' holds a special place
 hemchandra ke antim apurna granth pramanmimasaa kaa pragnachakshu pandit sukhlalji dwaara sampadan hua
 The Sutra style text is similar to Kanad or Akshpad

 Its style is according to the yogasutra of Patanjali

 All the debates, sects, opinions, obsessions of the world are the result
