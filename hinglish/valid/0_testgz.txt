 upanyaas, laghu kathaon or kavitaaon ne upadeshon or ghoshnapatron kaa sthaan le liya joki america ke praarambhik saahitiyik siddhanton se jude the
 Romantic literature was personal and serious and expressed feelings that were never seen in neo-ancientism
 swatantraaa ke saath america kaa purvadhikaar swachhandatavaadi lekhekon ke liye prerana kaa ek mahaan strot ban gaya kyunki vah vivaad or hansi kaa paatr bane bina mukt abhivyakti or bhaawanaaon ke pradarshan se prasann the

 There were many wars during the libertarianism
 Along with the Seven Year War, the French and Indian War and then the American Revolution and the French Revolution immediately thereafter
 ye sabhi yuddh or inke saath chal rahi rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal, svachhndtavaad kii prishthbhumi kaa kaary karti he
 The harsh emotions generated during the war served as a catalyst for the flow of art and literature, as never before
 yah lekhan vastav main itnaa bhinn tha kii isane apane nae romani yug kaa aarambh kiya
 The compositions of the Romani era are a large and unique collection of literature
 haalanki is sabhi rachanaaon main teen baaten saamaan hai- prakruti-prem, rashtrawaad kii bhaavana or vishisht aakarshan kii bhaavana
 in saadhaaran abhilakshanon ko is baat se jod ke dekha ja saktaa he ki ye rachanaayen rajnatik uthal-puthal ke samay likhi gayi hai
 For example, nationalism in Romani literature points to the fact that the writers of the time were proud of their country, countrymen and their cause
 yah un lekhakon ke swayan ladane kaa tarika tha
 In addition, the Romani era's writing is very different from that of his earlier writings, in which he spoke of "the masses"
 romani lekhakon kaa lakshya rahaa ki sahitya evam kala sabhi ke liye, aam aadmi ke liye hon na ki sirf dhani evam vishisht janon ke liye
 Much of the literature and style of pre-romani era focused only on the wealthy upper-class
 romani lekhakon kaa ise badalane main haath tha - or aisa isliye kyonki shaayad ve jan-saadhaaran ke saath judane kii koshish kar rahe the
 In times of war and political uneasiness, these writers were trying to connect with their counterparts, and this was unlike the people above them who encouraged the fight
 romani kaal ke dauraan, ham mahila lekhakon main vruddhi ko dekh sakate hai
 This also confirms the fact that this time was full of war
 mahilaayein apane ghar par hi rahati thim, unke paas apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne, dhyey ke liye ladane or apane saathiyon se judane kaa or koi maarg nahin tha
 Mary Fowrett and female romantic writers like her are influenced by emotions that sometimes become a reference to war itself, for example Fawrett's "war in the Air"
 jo samaykaal yuddh se itnaa aachhadit tha, us samay kaa samaaj or uskaa har pahalu, yahan tak ki kala kaa har rup, us se prabhavit nahin hoga, yah soch hi anuchit he
 Let us take up any piece of literature, the effect of war and social upheaval on them is clearly described

 Turner was in the work of Francisco Goya, Theodore Jerichault, and Eugene Delacroix, emphasizing new distinctiveness in the touch of the brush and also imposing color on the artists' free hand painting, which was pressed into neo-ancientism for a smooth refinement

 Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt and Frederick Edwin Church and others often expressed a Romani style in their paintings
 vah kabhi kabhi pracheen vishwa ke avasheshon kaa bhi chithran karte the, jaise ki fredrick edwin kii carch kriti sunraise in syria main
 in kritiyon main mrityu or patan kii gothic bhaavana parilakshith hoti thi
 He also demonstrated the romantic ideal that nature is omnipotent and will eventually conquer all temporary creations of man
 Many times he painted unique American scenes and natural scenes to prove himself different from European models

 This poem also shows the strong association between the literary and visual arts artists of the Romani period

 Thomas Cole's illustration has a strong narrative such as The Voyage of Life series created in the early 1840s, which depicts that man is trying to live with adorable and vast nature, from cradle to grave

 Early Romantic nationalism was strongly supported by Rousseau and by the suggestions of Johann Gottfried and Herder, who argued in 1784 that geography constituted the natural economy of the individual and gave shape to their social customs
 jo log ek hi bhashaa bolte hai vah ek duusare se prakruti ke anekon adrishy bandhanon ke dwaara jude hai, kisi maanav kala ke viksit hone se bahut pehle hi; vah ek duusare ko samajhane lagate hai or swayan ko or bhi adhik spasht rup se samajhane yogya banane lagate hai; unka astitv ek saath rahane main hi he or vah purnek hai jise alag nahin kiya ja saktaa xxrep 5

 The approach of nationalism encouraged the compilation of folklore by people such as Brothers Grimm, the re-circulation of old epics as national, the creation of new epics that were old-fashioned, such as Calvala, compiled from the stories of folkland and folk literature
 Tha, or Ocean, in which those ancient roots have been discovered
 yah vichaar ki pari-kathaayen, jab tak ki vah bahari saahitiyik strot dwaara dooshit na kii jaaen, tab tak vah hajaaron varsh se usee rup main rahati hai, yah maatr romani rashtravaadiyon main vishesh nahin tha, lekin unke is vichaar ke saath aasaani se saamanjasy bana letaa tha ki aisi kathaayen logon ke moulik swabhaav ko vyakt karti hai
 For example, the Brothers Grimm rejected many of the stories he had compiled because they were similar to the stories of Charles Perrault, which, according to him, demonstrated that these stories were not entirely German; Sleeping Beauty continued to occupy his compilation because the story of Brainehilder led him to agree that the sleepless princess's character was authentically German

 The re-circulation and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romani poets and painters helped to distinguish their fundamental culture from the dominant countries and to crystallize the mythology of Romani nationalism
 swatantraaa ke liye deshbhakti, rashtrawaad, kranti or sainya sangharsh bhi is kaal kii kala kii prachlit style ban gayi
 Controversially, Adam Mickiewicz was the most distinguished poet of this part of Europe, who developed the idea that Poland was the Messiah of the nations and wrote his fate in the same way that Jesus suffered to save all people

 uske sautele pita hameshaa makkhi kii baju lete he jiske karan chulbul hameshaa gussa rahata he
 After 21 years, a gang of gangsters is counting the money by plundering the bank when Chulbul Pandey, now a policeman, saves the money by killing the goons but eventually keeps all the money with him

 Spencer developed an all-inclusive concept of origins as the gradual evolution of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies
 As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, humanities, economics, political theory, philosophy, biology, sociology and psychology

 As both a teenager and a young man, Spencer found it difficult to stabilize in any intellectual or professional field
 During the boom in the field of rail transport during the 1830s, he worked as a civil engineer and also spent most of his time writing provincial magazines, which were non-religious in their religion and in their politics

 Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced him to his seminar, which included many of the capital's most democratic and progressive thinkers, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewis and Mary Ann Evans, with whom he had a brief romantic engagement

 Spencer's next book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, discovered a physiological basis for psychology, his first reward from Evans and Lewis
 yah pustak in buniyadi manyataon par aadhaarit thi ki maanav man prakritik niyamon ke anusaar kaary karata he tathaa yah ki inhen saamaanya jeev-vigyaan ke dhaanche ke bheetar khoja ja saktaa tha
 This allowed an evolutionary approach to be adopted not only in terms of the individual, but also in terms of species and race
 Through this paradigm, Spencer's goal was Mill's logic's associative psychology, the notion that the human-mind was constructed from molecular sensations held together by laws of associative thought, and that the more 'scientific' seem to be the science of craniology
 The theory, in which the core of specific mental functions was traced to different parts of the brain, was to reconcile
 spencer ne tark diya ki, ye donon siddhant satya kaa aanshik varnan karte the: vichaaron ke doharaavpurn saahchary mastishk ke utakon main vishisht reshon ke nirmaan main sammilit the, tathaa inhen prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke madhyam se ek se duusari peedi main bheja ja saktaa tha

 haalanki, yah pustak prarambh main safal nahin thi or iske pratham sanskaran kii antim 251 pratiyaan june 1861 tak nahin bik sakin
 Spencer's interest in psychology was derived from a more basic concern establishing the universality of natural law

 This was in contrast to the views of many theologians at the time, who insisted that parts of the composition, particularly the human soul, were outside the domain of scientific research
 comte kii sistim di philosophy positive prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko pradarshit karne ke lakshya se likhi gai thi or apane lakshya kii purti ke liye spencer ko comte kaa anusaran karnaa tha
 However, Spencer did not agree with Comte's belief that it was possible to find a rule of universal application, which he discovered in progressive development and called the theory of evolution

 Spencer thought that this composition of ten sections would take twenty years to complete; In the end it took him twice as long and it took almost the entire duration of his long life

 By the 1890s, his readers began to abandon him and many of his closest friends died and his mind was skeptical about the confident devotion to development that he had made his philosophical system central

 Although social statics was originally a creation of a democrat who believed in giving women the right to vote and in the nationalization of land to break the power of feudalism, by the 1880s, they were staunch women sufferers
 Had become adversaries and he collaborated with the Liberty and Property Defense League land owners in a common program against him Received, which they believe leaning toward "socialism" elements led by William Ewart Gladstone was largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself
 Spencer's political views of this period were expressed in The Man Versus the State, which has become his best work

 Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in humanity's ultimate perfection based on advanced scientific concepts, such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological origins
 sankshep main, spencer kaa darshanik drushtikon devvaad or pratyakshvaad ke ek sangyojan se milakar bana tha
 On the one hand, he inherited some portions of eighteenth-century Devism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society, and from books such as George Combe's highly popular The Constitution of Man
 isamen vishwa ko sadbhaavpurn rachana vaala ek brahmad or prakruti ke niyamon ko ‘bhavathit rup se dayaalu’ mana gaya tha
 Natural laws were thus statues of the well-known universe, which were created by the Creator for the purpose of propagating human happiness
 haalanki spencer ne kishoravastha main hi apane isai mat kaa tyaag kar diya tha or baad main devatv kii kisi bhi ‘maanavarupi’ avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya, lekin iske baavjood ek lagbhag avchetan str par ve is avadharana ko dridhtaapurvak jakade hue the
 Although he owed much of the credit he gave to positivism, he had received much from it, especially in its creation of a philosophical system as the integration of various branches of scientific knowledge
 He was also following positivism in his insistence that it is possible to get only the real knowledge of facts and hence it was futile to speculate about the nature of the final truth
 pratyakshvaad or unke shesh devvaad ke bich yah tanaav kritrim darshanashasre kii puri pranali main bana rahaa
 Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; In this sense, his philosophy was focused on being 'artificial'
 comte kii hi tarah, ve bhi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ke prati patibaddh the, jiske anusaar prakruti ke niyam bina kisi apwaad ke jaivik kshetra par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne kii ajaev kshetra par or maanav ke man par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne ki shesh sristi par
 is prakaar kritrim darshanashasre kaa pehla uddeshy yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki prakritik niyamon ke rup main, brahmad ke sabhi tathyon ke vaigyanik anveshan ko khoj paane main sakasham hone ke liye koi bhi apwaad nahin he
 All of Spencer's works on biology, psychology, and sociology were intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific areas
 yahaan tak ki naitikta par unke lekhan main bhi, unhone yah vichaar rakhaa ki nashvarata ke 'niyamon' ko khoj paanaa sambhav tha, jinamein niyamaatmak saamagree hone ke baavjood bhi jinaki avasthaa prakruti ke niyamon kii hi thi, yah ek aisi avadharana he, jiskaa mul combay ke constitution of main main dekha ja saktaa he
 The second purpose of Artificial Philosophy was to show that these same rules lead to development in a sustained way
 keval vaigyanik vidhi kii ekta par bal dene vaale comte ke vipareet, spencer ne sabhi prakritik niyamon ko ek buniyadi niyam, utpatti ke niyam, main vighatit karke vaigyanik gyaan ke ekikaran kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, he followed the paradigm proposed by Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous work Vestiges of Natural History of Creation
 haalanki aksar ise charles darwin kii da origin of spisis kaa ek prabhaavaheen agradoot kahkar khaarij kar diya jaataa he, lekin vastav main chembers kii pustak vigyaan ke ekikaran ke liye ek kaarykram thi, jiskaa lakshya yah darshana tha ki saura mandal kii utpatti ke liye laplas kii niharika pariklpana or lemark kaa prajati roopantaran kaa siddhant donon hi 'pragatisheel vikaas kaa ek adbhut samanyikaran' ke udhaaharan the
 Chambers was associated with Chapman's seminar and his work became an undisclosed mold for artificial philosophy

 Spencer expressed the view that all the structures of the universe evolve from a simple, uniform, symmetry into a complex, different, variety and the process of large integration of different parts continues with it
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki yah vikasvaadi prakriya puure brahmad main kaary karti hui dekhi ja sakati he
 It was a universal law, which was as much applicable to stars and galaxies, as much to biological beings and to the human social system as it was to the human mind
 It differed from scientific rules only by its general generality, and special science rules could be demonstrated as examples of this theory
 jatilta ke vikaas kii vyakhya karne kaa yah prayaas do varshon baad prakashit hui darwin kii origin of spisis main milane vaale prayaas se purnatah bhinn tha
 Quite often, incorrectly, it is believed that Spencer simply took over and normalized Darwin's work on natural selection
 However, even after reading Darwin's work, he introduced the phrase 'survival of the best' as his own vocabulary for Darwin's concept and is often mistakenly regarded as a theorist who used Darwinian theory Applied only to society, but still reluctantly included natural selection in their entire existing system prajati roopantaran kii unke dwaara pahachaani gai praathmik kaarividhi lemarkwaadi prayog-uttaradhikaar kii thi, jisane yah pratipaadit kiya ki ang prayog yaa apaprayog ke dwaara viksit athwa nasht hote hai or yah ki ye parinamit parivartan bhavi pidiyon main bhi sanchaarit ho sakate hai
 Spencer believed that this method of gradual development was also necessary to explain 'higher' gradual development, especially for the social development of humanity
 Furthermore, unlike Darwin, he believed that there was a direction and gradual point of gradual development, which is the final stage of the attainment of equivalence
 unhone jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ko samajashasre par lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He propounded that society is the result of a change from lower to higher forms, just as it is said that according to the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life develop into proper forms
 spencer kaa daawa tha ki isi prakaar maanav kaa man bhi nimnatar pashuon kii saral swachaalit pratikriyaaon se lekar vichaarsheel manushya main tark-shakti kii prakriya tak kramik rup se viksit hua tha
 According to Spencer, there were two types of knowledge: knowledge acquired by the individual and knowledge acquired by the species
 Intuition, or unconsciously learned knowledge, was the hereditary experience of the species
 spencer ne bahut utsaah ke saath auguste comte ke mul pratyakshvaadi samajashasre kaa adhyayan kiya
 Comte, a philosopher of science, had proposed a theory of socio-cultural gradual development, according to which the development of society takes place through a general rule of three stages
 haalanki, jeev-vigyaan main vibhinn parivartanon ke baad likhte hue, spencer ne comte ke pratyakshvaad ke vichaaratmak pahaluon ko khaarij karte hue saamaajik vigyaan ko kramik vikaas ke jeev-vigyaan ke sandarbh main punarnirupit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Broadly, Spencer's sociology can be described as socially Darwinist
 spencer ne tark diya ki samaaj kaa vikaas saral, samaan, samarupata se jatil, bhinn, vividhta tak ke kramik vikaas kaa udhaaharan he
 He developed a theory of two types of society, terrorist and industrial, which was in line with gradual evolutionary progress
 aatankwaadi samaaj, jisaki sanrachana padanukram or ajnapaalan ke sambandhon se milakar bani thi, saral or ek samaan tha; audyogic samaaj, jo ki svaichhik, sanvidatmak rup se sweekrut saamaajik dayitvon par aadhaarit tha, jatil or bhinn tha
 Society, which Spencer considered a 'social animal', evolved gradually from a simpler state to a more complex one according to the universal law of evolution
 iske alaava, audyogic samaaj soshal statics main viksit adarsh samaaj kaa pratyaksh vanshaj tha, haalanki spencer ne ab is baat ko spasht rup se vyakt nahin kiya ki kya samaaj kaa parinaam araajaktaavaad ke rup main milegaa yaa kya yah rajya kii ek nirantar bhoomika ko suchit karata he, haalanki ek aisi bhoomika, jo ki sanvidaaon ke pravartan or bahya suraksha ke nunatam kaaryon tak simit ho chuki hogi
 Although Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not less than his influence on structural pragmatism, his attempt to present Lamarckist or Darwinian ideas in the field of social science failed
 Even some people considered it to be actively dangerous
 Interpreters of the time, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, became the promoters of the distinction between natural sciences and human sciences
 In the 1890s, Emil Darkhim established formal academic sociology, with a strong emphasis on applied social research
 beesvin sadi ke mode par, german samajashasreiyon kii pehali peedi, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se maiks webar, ne vidhiparak apratyakshvaad ko prastut kiya tha
 As predicted in Spencer's first book, the creation of the 'ideal man in an ideal society' would be the last point of the process of gradual development, in which humans would have fully embraced social life
 The main difference between Spencer's early and later concepts in terms of this process was the time-scale of the gradual development involved
 manovaigyanik-or atah naitik bhi-sanrachana, jo ki hamaare purvajon dwaara vartmaan peedi ko viraasat main di gai he, tathaa jo aage ham apni bhavi pidiyon ko denge, samaaj main nivas kii aavashyaktaaon ko kramik rup se apanaae jane kii prakriya main thi
 For example, aggression was an intuition associated with survival, which necessitated the primary conditions of life, but it became unnecessary to adopt it in advanced societies
 Since human intuition had a special place in the fibers of brain tissue, it was subject to the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession, so that gradual changes could be transferred to future generations
 With the passage of several generations, the process of gradual development will ensure that humans become less aggressive and incrementally altruistic, eventually resulting in the creation of an entire society in which no one will hurt another person
 haalanki kramik vikaas ke dwaara ek purna vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki vartmaan or bhavi peediyaan apane vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' parinaamon kaa anubhav karen
 keval isi tareeke se vyaktiyon ko aatm-sudhaar kaa kaary karne or is prakaar apane uttaradhikariyon ko ek unnat naitik gathan pradaan karne ke liye aavashyak prerana praapt hogi
 atah vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' sambandh or iske parinaam ke bich vyavdhaan utpann karne vaali kisi bhi baat ko roka janaa chaiye or isamen garibi mitaane, saarvajanik shiksha pradaan karne, yaa anivaary tikaakaran ko aavashyak banane kii rajya kii pratirodhi shakti kaa prayog bhi shaamil tha
 Although charitable donations were to be encouraged, they were also to be limited by the idea that human beings often receive sorrows as a result of their actions
 atah vyaktiyon kaa 'ayogy garibon' kii ore nirdeshit atyadhik paropkaarita vyavhaar or parinaam ke bich us kadi ko tod degi, jise spencer is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye buniyadi aavashyaktaa maanate the ki vikaas ke ucchtar str par maanavtaa kaa kramik vikaas jari rahe
 Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value — the greatest happiness of the greatest number — and according to him the climax of the process of evolution would be the greatest assessment of utility
 People living in an ideal society will not only get pleasure from the practice of synonyms, but they will also try to avoid causing misery to others
 They will also instinctively respect the rights of others, as a result of which the principle of justice will be adhered to globally - each person will have the maximum amount of freedom, consistent with the same amount of freedom that others receive
 'freedom' refers to the absence of coercion and is intimately tied to the right to private property
 spencer ne aacharan ke is niyam ko 'param nitishasre' kaha, jisane niti-shasr kii ek vaigyanik aadhaar vaali pranali pradaan kii, jo ateet kii aloukikta-aadhaarit niti-shasr pranaaliyon kaa sthaan le sakegi
 haalanki, unhone is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki hamaare dwaara viraasat main praapt kiya gaya naitik gathan abhi hamen param nitishasre ke niyamon ke saath purna anurupata se vyavhaar karne kii anumati nahin detaa or yahi kaaran he ki hamen 'saapeksh nitishasre' ke ek niyam kii aavashyaktaa he, jisamen hamaari vartmaan apurnataa ke vikrutisheel karkon par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ho
 Spencer's distinctive approach to musicology was also linked to his ethics
 spencer ne sochaa ki sangeet kaa udgam joshpurna vaktrutv kala main dhundha ja saktaa he
 The speaker exerts affirmative effect, not only by the rationality of his words, but also by his accent and accentuation — as Spencer expressed it, the musical qualities of his vowel act as "commentary of emotion on sentences of intelligence
" We do
 sangeet, jise vaktruta kii unki visheshta kaa ek unnat vikaas mana gaya, prajatiyon kii niti-shasr kii shiksha or vikaas main yogadan detaa he
 "the bizarre ability of us to be influenced by melodies and rhythms, perhaps, lies in both the fact that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those immense pleasures, and that in some way or the other they are Are related
 yadi aisa he, to sangeet kii shakti or arth bodhgamy ban jate hai; lekin anyathaa ve ek rahasy hai
 " spencer ke antim varshon main unka praarambhik ashavad ko nasht hota hua dikhaai diya or iskaa sthaan maanav ke bhavishya ke prati ek nirashavad ne le liya
 Despite this, he devoted most of his efforts to support his arguments and prevent misinterpretation of his important theory of non-interference
 victorian logon ke bich spencer kii pratishtha kaa bahut bada shrey unke agyeyavaad ko he
 He rejected theology as a representative of 'atheism of those who pretend piety'
 His rejection of the traditional religion earned him immense maladjustment and was often condemned by religious thinkers accusing him of being an advocate of atheism and materialism
 Nevertheless, unlike Huxley, whose agnosticism was a concentrated terrorist sect toward 'an unforgivable sin of faith', Spencer emphasized that they did not seek to devalue religion in the name of science, but rather the harmony between the two Were worried about setting up
 spencer kaa tark tha ki ham chaahe dharmik vishwaas se prarambh karen yaa vigyaan se, antat hamen kuch anivaary, lekin shabdic rup se kalpanaateet dharanaon ko sweekaar karnaa hi padataa he
 Whether we are concerned about a manufacturer or the ground level, which lies beneath our experience of facts, we cannot draw a blueprint for its concept
 Spencer concluded that, therefore, religion and science accept the ultimate truth that human understanding is only capable of understanding 'relative' knowledge
 aisa isaliye he kyonki, maanav ke man kii antarnihit simaaon ke kaaran, keval tathyon kaa gyaan praapt kar paanaa hi sambhav he, tathyon ke neeche sthit vaastaviktaa kaa nahin
 atah vigyaan or dharm donon ko yah baat sweekaar kar leni chaiye ki 'samast tathyon main yah sarvaadhik nishchit he ki brahmad main hamen jo shakti dikhaai detii he, va purnatah agamya he
 He called it the realization of the 'agnostic' and he presented the worship of the agnostic as a positive belief capable of replacing traditional religion
 vastav main, unka vichaar tha ki dharm ke kramik vikaas main agyeya antim charan, iske antim maanavarupi avasheshon ke antim nishkasana, kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The Spencerian ideas prevalent in the twenty-first century derive from their political theories of the late nineteenth century and their memorable attacks on reformist movements
 ichaswatantryavaadiyon tathaa rajyaviheen-poonjeevaad dwaara unhen agua tehraaya gaya he
 Economist Murray Rothbard called social statistics "the greatest greatest creation of libertarian philosophies of all time"
 spencer kaa tark tha ki rajya koi "aavashyak" sanstha nahin he or svaichhik bazaar sanghathan dwaara rajya ke avapidak pahaluon kaa sthaan le liye jane par iskaa "kshay" ho jayega
 unhone yah tark bhi diya ki vyakti ke paas "rajya ko andekha karne kaa adhikaar tha
 "as a result of this perspective, Spencer was a staunch critic of patriotism
 jab unhen bataaya gaya ki dwitiya afgaan yuddh ke dauraan british senaayen sankat kii sthiti main hai, to pratikriyaswaroop unhone kaha: "jab log dusron ke aadesh par anya logon ko, unke andolan ke auchity ke bare main kuch bhi puche bina, goli maarane ke liye swayan ko kiraaye par de dete hai or yadi swayan unhen hi goli maar di jaae, to main is baat kii chintaa nahin karata
" In the last part of Victorian Britain, politics moved in the direction that Spencer disliked and his arguments provided so much ammunition for liberals and individualists in Europe and America, that they are used even in the twenty-first century
 abhivyakti 'dir iz no alternetive ’, jise pradhanmantri margarette thechar ne prasiddhi dilaai, kaa mul spencer dwaara iske zordaar prayog main dhundha ja saktaa he
 By the 1880s, he had come to condemn "neo-conservatism"
 In The Man Versus the State, he criticized Gladstone and the Liberal Party for deviating from their true mission and instead promoting paternalistic social law

 niabandh sangrah: Biography strot Imagine what would happen if a straight line was drawn starting from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth and an object is placed exactly in the middle of this simple line? Naturally, the powerful gravitational force of the Sun, which is much higher than the gravitational force of the Earth, will pull this object towards you
 Now if this object placed in the middle of the straight line is moved slowly towards the earth, what will happen? As this object moves closer to the Earth, the effect of the gravitational force of the Earth will increase and the effect of the Sun will decrease in the same proportion and a situation will come when the effect of both Sun and Earth on this object will be equal i
e
 In this, neither the sun will be able to pull this object towards it nor the earth will be able to pull it towards it, rather the object will hang in the balance
 Therefore, the equilibrium points where the gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth are equal are called Lagranja points

 kya aap main se koi apana sir de saktaa he? yah sunate hi vahaan maujuud sabhi sikh aashcharyachakit rah gaye or sannata chaa gaya
 At the same time, a person named Dayasinh came forward who was a resident of Lahore and said - you can take my head
 gurudev use paas hi banaae gaye tamboo main le gaye
 After some time a stream of blood appeared from the tent

 Gurudev came out again and asked for another head, then the young man of Dwarka, Mohkam Chand came forward
 isi tarah paanchavi baar phir gurudev dwaara sir maangane par bidar nivasee sahib chand sir dene ke liye aage aaye
 Even after having so many Sikhs in the field, there was silence, all looking at each other
 kisi ko kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 Then Guru Gobind Singh came out of the tent with five Sikh youth wearing saffron garb
 paanchon noujvaan vahiin the jinke sir kaatane ke liye gobind singh tamboo main le gaye the
 Gurudev and all the five young men came on stage, Gurudev sat on the throne
 paanchon naujavaanon ne kahaan gurudev hamaare sir kaatane ke liye hamen tamboo main nahin le gaye the balki vah hamaari pariksha thi
 Then Gurudev said to the Sikhs present there, these five are my five beloved from today

 Modern photography has helped a lot in the study of birds' routines

 The beginning of ornithology is very ancient
 arestu ke lekhon me pakshi sambandhi anek sahi vaigyanik avlokanon kaa ullekh paaya jaataa he
 But the recognition of ornithology as a branch of science is relatively modern
 gharelu chidiyon kii aakarshak sundarataa, aarthik upyogita or chidiyon ke shikaar dwaara manushya kaa manorajan ityadi anke kaarnon se, anya praaniyon kii apeksha, pakshi varg bhalee bhanti vikhyath he or vyavsaayik tathaa shaukia donon hi prakaar ke vaigyanikon ke liye aakarshan kaa vishay rahaa he
 Many scientific discoveries have been made and new knowledge has been received about birds, which have been included in many new booklets related to birds
 yadhyapi ye pustikas purnat: vaigyanik nahin hai, phir bhi inase anek vaigyanik vrittant uplabdh hote hai
 This is the reason that even in those sections of the earth, which are more rugged forests and which have not been thoroughly investigated, very few new species of birds have been detected, because even in those places, most of the birds have been known very long ago
 More search and information has been done
 kintu yahi ke rup main praapt honevaale pakshiyon ke vishay main nahin kyonki pakshiyon ke jeevashm ke vishay main sam samay ascharyajanak khojein hui hai or abhi bahut adhik khoj kii jaati he
 Charles Darwin's theory of evolution has created a great revolution in ornithology and other branches of biology
 jin dinon pranivigyaan ke anya virgon ke visheshgy nai jati ke varnan main vyast rahe, pakshivigyanvetta pakshiyon kii jati ke sookshm antaron kaa pataa lagane main or is baat kii khoj main lage the ki prakruti main nai jati ke jeevon kaa abhyuday kaise hota he
 It is being emphasized nowadays by the study of birds that the new race of beings originates from their geographical isolation and this is the reason why geographical location has been included in the third section of scientific nomenclature of all creatures
 jeevon ke vaigyanik namakaran se, jisase kisi bhi desh or bhashaa ke vaigyanik praaniyon tathaa pakshiyon kii jati ko pahchaan saken, jeevigyaan main bahut badi pragati hui he
 The method of scientific nomenclature of organisms is adopted from the tenth edition of the treatise "sistema nachuri" by the resident Carolus Linnaeus
 is paddati ke anusaar kisi praani ke naam ke do yaa teen khand hote hai
 The first section of the name refers to his lineage, the second section to his caste and the third section to his subcaste, which is based on geographical area or other characteristics

 There are microscopic observations on many birds in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, then in the Puranas
 sara samskruti sahitya, praakrit tathaa pali sahitya bhi, pakshiyon ke gyaan se samrudh he
 It is even more commendable that hunting of some special birds has been prohibited in Manusmriti, Parasharsmriti etc
 for the conservation of birds
 kautilya ke arthshaastra main bhi aise hi pakshi-sangrakshan ke samachit nirdesh hai
 All these are the events of the period when in addition to domesticated animals and birds were seen mainly as hunting and food
 charakasamhita kaa sankalan kaal saatvin shatee isha purv he 
 Charaka Samhita, Sangeet Ratna and Bharatamuni's Natyashastra have a subtle description of the characteristics of birds, which are based on scientific method
 kintu iske baad ke uplabdh sahitya se aisa lagata he ki, baad main, sambhavatya barbaron se apni raksha main jujhate bharat main, pakshiyon kaa adhyayan vaigyanik drushti se na kiya ja sakaa
 Yes, in Sanskrit literature, birds are described on the basis of microscopic observation, with very tenderness and affectionate feelings
 mithunarat kronch ke vadh ko dekhakar adikavi valmiki kaa hriyad karun ras se otprot hokar kavita ke rup main bah niklaa tha, ‘‘maa nishad pratishthanam tvam xxrep 4 
 ’’ arthath he nishad tumhen samaaj main pratishtha nahin milegi xxrep 5 
 Yes, Babur, Humayun and Jahangir, who were very Sikar lovers in the Mughal period, made a subtle observation of birds and wrote
 lok sahitya main bhi pakshiyon kaa vishesh sthaan he, kintu hindi sahitya main pakshiyon ke vaigyanik adhyayan tathaa sookshm avlokan kii parampamara kinhi kaarnon se aage nahin badi
 And whatever description of birds, it is mostly on the tied tradition whether the birds are chattak, chakor, papiha, stork, chakravak etc
 or parrot, myna, goose, owl, crow, vulture, ababil, khanjan etc
 kintu iske saath yah dukhad sach he ki aaj saamaanya vidhyaarthee yaa vyakti ko pakshiyon tathaa ped-paudhon kii sahi pahchaan batalaane vaala ruchikar sahitya, hindi main, nahin ke baraabar he
 a variety of methods and tools are used in biology
