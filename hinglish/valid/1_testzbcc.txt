 The process of constructing a data model using formal data model descriptions using data modeling techniques in software engineering is called data modeling
 data modelling ek vidhi he, jiskaa prayog kisi sanghathan kii vyapaarik prakriyaaon kaa samarthan karne ke liye aavashyak data aavashyaktaaon ko paribhaashit karne or unka vishleshan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Data requirements are recorded as data definitions associated with a conceptual data model
 vaicharik model ke vaastavik kriyanvayan ko taarkik data model kaha jaataa he
 Implementation of a conceptual data model may require multiple logical data models
 data modelling na keval data ke tatwon, balki unki sanrachanaon or unke bich sambandhon ko bhi paribhaashit karti he
 Data modeling techniques and procedures are used to characterize data in a standard, stable, predictable form so that it can be managed as a resource
 The use of data modeling standards has been strongly recommended for all projects that require a standard means to define and analyze an organization's internal data, e
g
 Data modeling can be used for the following tasks: data modelling vibhinn prakaar kii pariyojnaon main or pariyojnaon ke anek charnon main kii ja sakati he
 Data models are progressive; No data model is ever final for any business or application
 Instead a data model should be considered a living document, which will change as a reaction to the changing business
 Ideally, the data model should be kept in a repository so that it can be retrieved, expanded, and edited over time
 Whiten defined two types of data modeling: data modelling kisi database ke liye vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon ke varnan ke liye bhi ek takanic he
 Sometimes this is called database modeling because a data model is eventually implemented in a database
 data model data kii paribhaasha or uskaa praaroop pradaan karke data or computer tantron kaa samarthan karte hai
 If this is done continuously between systems, then data compatibility can be achieved
 yadi data ke bhandaran or abhigaman ke liye samaan data sanrachanaon kaa prayog kiya jaye, to vibhinn anuprayog data ko saajha kar sakate hai
 Its results are reported above
 haalanki, pranaaliyon or interfeson ko banane, chalaane or inkaa rakh-rakhaav karne kii laagat, jitani honi chaiye, aksar usase adhik hoti he
 They can also hinder business rather than support it
 ek mukhya kaaran yah he ki pranaaliyon or interpheson main lagu kiye gayi data modelon kii gunvattta kam hoti he
 The reason for these problems is the lack of a standard, which will ensure that the data models will also meet business needs and be compatible
 1975 main ANSI ke anusaar data model kaa ek drushtaant teen main se kisi ek prakaar kaa ho saktaa he: The importance of this method according to ANSI is that it allows the three approaches to be relatively independent of each other
 taarkik yaa vaicharik model ko prabhavit kiye bina bhandaran praudyogiki ko badla ja saktaa he
 The table / column structure is subject to change without affecting the conceptual model
 swaabhaavik rup se, prayek sthiti main, sanrachanaayen anya modelon ke saath sangat bani rahani chaiye

 anek software vikaas pariyojnaon ke praarambhik charan ek vaicharik data model ke nirmaan par bal dete hai
 a design of this type can be described in a logical data model
 baad vaale charnon main, is model ko bhautik data model main roopantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, it is also possible to implement a conceptual data model directly
 vyapaarik prakriya ke ekikaran ke sandarbh main, chitra dekhen, data modelling kaa parinaam database ke ekikaran ke rup main milegaa
 yah vyapaar prakriya modelling kaa poorak he, jiskaa parinaam anuprayog program hota he, jo is vyapaar prakriya kaa samarthan karti he
 Real database design is the process of building a detailed data model of a database
 is taarkik data model main dizine ko ek data paribhaasha bhashaa main nirmit karne ke liye aavashyak sabhi taarkik or bhautik dizine chayan or bhautik bhandaran maapdand hote hai, jinka prayog tab ek database ke nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 a data model with all the attributes has detailed attributes for each unit
 database dizine shabdaawalee kaa prayog ek sakal database pranali ke dizine ke vibhinn bhaagon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Primarily and most accurately, it can be understood as a logical construct of the basic data structures used for storing data
 ek sambandhparak model main ye talikaayen or vyuu hote hai
 Units and relationships in an object database are directly associated with object classes and named relationships
 haalanki, database dizine shabdaawalee kaa prayog dizining kii sakal prakriya, na keval mul data sanrachanaon, balki ek database prabandhan tantra yaa DBMS main ek sakal database anuprayog ke bhaag ke rup main prayukt forms or qveries bhi, ko lagu karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This process costs 25% to 70% of the current system development and support costs on the system interface
 is laagat kaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki ye system ek saamaanya data model kaa prayog nahin karte
 yadi data modelon ko ek pranali-dar-pranali aadhaar par viksit kiya jaae, to aachhadit kshetron main na keval samaan vishleshan doharaaya jaataa he, balki unke bich interphes kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aage or vishleshan karnaa bhi anivaary hota he
 Most systems have the same basic components, which are redeveloped for a specific purpose
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit main samaan buniyadi vargeekaran model kaa prayog ek ghatak ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he: The same components are redeveloped because we have no way of telling that they are identical
 data model ruchi ke soochna kshetron kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Although there are many methods for building data models, according to Lane Silverstone, only two of these methods are the best, top-down and bottom-up: kabhi-kabhi model in donon vidhiyon ke mishran ke rup main nirmit kiye jate hai: kisi anuprayog kii sanrachana or data aavashyaktaaon or sanrachana par vichaar karke or ek vishay-kshetra model kaa satat sandarbh dete hue
 durbhaagya se, anek vaataavaranon main, ek taarkik data model or ek bhautik data model ke bich antar aspasht hota he
 Additionally, some CASE tools do not differentiate between logical and physical data models
 data modelling kii anek sanket-paddatiyaan hoti hai
 The real model is often called the "entity relationship model" because it portrays the data in terms of the entities described in it and their relationships
 ek ikai-sambandh model sanrachanabaddh data kaa ek sankshipt vaicharik pradarshan hota he
 Entity-relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, which is used in software engineering to construct a type of conceptual data model of a system, usually a relational database, in a top-down form

 The data modeling technique can be used to describe any element for a specific dialog-world, ie area of interest
 data modelon ke nirmaan ke liye anek takneekein viksit kii gayi hai
 While these practices guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with two different results
 Most notable are: saamaanya data model paaramparik data modelon ke samanyikaran hote hai
 They define standardized general relationship types as well as those types of objects that may be associated with such relation-types
 ek saamaanya data model kii paribhaasha ek prakritik bhashaa kii paribhaasha ke samaan hi hoti he
 For example, in a general data model the types of relations, regardless of the types of objects concerned, are a 'classification relation', which is a binary relation between a single object and a type of objects, and a 'part-full relationship'
 ', Which can be defined as a binary relationship between two objects, one of which is in the role of the numerator and the other in the role of the whole
 
 shreniyon kii ek vitanya suchi kisi ekal vastu kaa vargeekaran karne or kisi ekal vastu ke liye ansh-purna sambandh vinirdeshit karne kii anumati detii he
 By standardizing a canonical list of relationship types, a general data model provides the ability to express an unlimited number of types of facts and will use the capabilities of natural languages
 On the other hand, the domain scope of traditional data models is fixed and limited because the establishment of such models only allows the interpretation of the types of facts that are pre-defined in the model
 kisi DBMS kii taarkik data sanrachana, chaahe vah padanukramik ho, network ho, yaa sambandhaatmak ho, data kii ek vaicharik paribhaasha kii awashyaktaaon kii puri tarah purti nahin kar sakati kyonki iskaa dayera simit hota he or yah us DBMS dwaara prayog kii gai kriyanvayan ranneeti kii ore jhuki hui hoti he
 Hence the need to define data from a conceptual point of view has resulted in the development of semantics data modeling techniques
 arthath, data ke arth ko anya data ke saath aapasi sambandhon ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karne kii takneekein
 jaisaa ki chitra main pradarshit he, sansadhano, vichaaron, ghatnaon ityadi ke sandarbh main vaastavik-vishwa ko sanket-rup main bhautik data bhandaron main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 An econometric data model is an abbreviation that defines how these symbols are related to the real world
 is prakaar anivaary rup se yah model vaastavik-vishwa kaa ek satya pradarshan hona chaiye
 An econometric data model can be used for many purposes, such as: kritrim budhimatta ke kshetra se gyaat shaktishaalee sankshepan avadharanaon ke saath sambandhaatmak avadharanaon ke ekikaran ke dwaara adhik data kaa arth grahan karnaa arth-vigyaan data model kaa sakal lakshya he
 The idea here is to provide archaic elements of high-level modeling as an integral part of the data model to aid in the performance of real-world conditions

 The concept of time-space or space-time was given by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity
 According to him, like the three directions, time is also a dimension and in physics it should be seen as four dimensions simultaneously
 unhone kaha ki vastav main brahmand kii sabhi chizein is chaar-aiami dik-kaal main rahati hai
 He also said that sometimes situations arise when different objects experience different experiences in all these dimensions
 dik or kaal kaa sambadh hamaare nity vyavhaar main itnaa adhik aata he ki inke vishay main kuch adhuri si kintu drudh dharanaayen hamaare man main bachapan se hi hona swaabhaavik he
 Poets have narrated serious, vast and beautiful fantasies of problems and periods
 darshan main or paashchaatya manovigyaan main bhi inke vishay main puraatan kaal se soch vichaar hota aa rahaa he
 In Kanad's Vaishika philosophy, the concepts of sky, trouble and time are explained and their properties are also described
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo gyaan miltaa he usamen dik or kaal kaa sambandh avashya hi hota he
 If the reality of this knowledge is understood, then problems and times cannot be separated from reality
 prayek darshanik sampradaay ne vastaviktaa, dik or kaal, inke paraspar sambandhon kii apni apni dharanaayen di hai, jinamein aikamaty nahin he
 Problems and periods are also related indirectly in mathematics
 at: pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 When some of the experimental fruits of physics appeared to be inconsistent with these assumptions, then these ideas began to deviate, and Relativism established a new form of problem and time, which has been proved and consequently unanimous by many experiments
 dik tathaa kaal kaa yah nayaa swaroop keval bhinn hi nahin varan samajhane main bhi atyant kathin he, kyonki iske pratipaadan main vishisht ganit kaa upyog aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, where problem and time relationship comes, it will be easier to clarify first from macro point of view, then from micro point of view and finally from physics point of view
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo dik ke gunon kaa pratyay aata he, usase dik ke vibhinn prakaar maane ja sakate hai
 Perceptions are formed on the intelligence of experiences, and perceptions are formed
 is prakaar swanubhav se dik kii jo dharna banati he use "swa-dik' athwa "vyaktigat dik' kaha jaataa he
 In sensory experiences, many experiences are the same for all individuals, and the phenomenon that such experiences meet is called "real"
 vastav ghatnaon ke samudaayon se "vaastaviktaa' kii dharna banati he
 The senses give experiences of sight, touch, sound, taste and smell, but these experiences are always worthy of faith, it is not so
 prakashkeey sambhram to suprasiddh hai hi
 Even tactile behavior seems to be frequent, as the lair between two teeth is shorter than the tongue
 praaia: aisa hi prakaar sab tarah ke indriyajanya anubhavon kaa hota he
 Therefore, the perception of personal problems from these imperfect experiences is illusory
 maapndand tathaa anya uchit yantron kii sahaayta se indriyon kii maryaadit graahakta badhaai ja sakati he or is prakaar anek ghatnaon kaa bhramanirasan ho saktaa he
 The perception of a problem by measuring in experiments is called a "physical problem"
 maapan ke liye maapndand kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 There are four types of problems related to problems and by considering these four types practical problems of problems are formed
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh jab vahaan kahkar kiya jaataa he, tab dik ke ek swaroop kii kalpana aati he or iskaa arth yah bhi mana jaataa he ki dik kaa astitv swatantra he
 The direction of the site of an object is shown in the "relative position" of the problem when it is "relative" to the other object
 dik kaa teesraa swaroop vastuon ke "aakaar' se miltaa he, jisase dik kii vibhajyata kii bhi kalpana kii ja sakati he
 Looking up at the sky shows the fourth form of the "vastness" of the problem
 in chaar prakaar ke swaroopon se hi praaia: dik ke sambadh main vyaavhaarik dharanaayen banati hai or dik ke gun bhi suchit hote hai
 If the sensory experiences gained from the events are discussed, they have two types
 ghatnaon ke sthanbhed se dik kii kalpana hoti he or unke kram-bhed se kaal kii kalpana hoti he
 Thus problems and periods enter our ideology suspiciously
 dik jaisaa hi kaal bhi vyaktigat hota he or prayek vyakti kii kalganana swatantra tathaa swecch hoti he
 Not only this, there is also a change in the calculation of this self-time and it depends on the health, condition, etc
 conditions of the person, for example, if a person is engrossed in any work, then the time is cut fast
 at: vyaktigat athwa swa-kaal vishwaas yogya nahin rahata
 The period measured by a natural event - day and night - will not be personal and will be the same for all people
 at: aise kaal ko saarvajanik kaal kaha jaataa he
 There are macro divisions of day and night
 inke chote vibhaag kiye jaaen to vyavhaar main kaalamaapan ke liye ve adhik upyukt hote hai
 Hence Prahar, Ghatika, Pal Vipal or Hour, Minute, Second etc
 departments were done
 saamanyat: kaal kaa maapan ghadi se hota he
 Like problems, four forms of time also appear in practice
 kisi ghatana athwa anubhav se "kab?' prashn upasthit hota he or iskaa dik vishyak "kahan' se samya he
 From this imagination, the existence of Kaal is considered independent
 kisi ghatana ke kaal ke saapeksh duusari ghatana kaa varnan karte samay kaal kaa saapeksh swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 The form of time that appears between the two events is similar to the size of the problem
 vaise hi kaal ke anadi, anant ityadi visheshnon se kaal kii vishalata dikhaai dati he
 If we consider the four forms of problems and times, or qualities, then our perceptions about them are called "self" or "personal" or "psychological" problems and periods
 dik tathaa kaal kii dharanaon ko nishchit rup dene ke liye unka maapan karne ke saadhan aavashyak hote hai
 Penalties, tools and instruments of hard materials are used to measure problems
 in upkarnon se lambaai, kone, kshetrafal, aaytan ityadi vastuon ke gunon ke maapan hote he
 The assumptions of the time point, line, plane, etc
 of these measurements are made
 jab anek punraritiyon se ye dharanaayen drudh ho jaati hai, tab bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kaa sthaan moulik hota he or bhautik vastuen in dharanaon se dur ho jaati hai
 Now the similarity of these assumptions and the fundamental assumptions of Euclide geometry will be clear
 drudh vastuon ko samavisht karke dik ke, athwa vastuon ke, maapan se dik kii jo dharna hoti he use jyamitiya athwa eucalidia dik kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that the properties that are perceived by this notion of problem depend only on the definitions, axioms and imaginations of Euclidean geometry
 dik kii hamaari vyaavhaarik dharna or maapan se nishchit kii hui yah jyamitiya dharna, kramash: hamaari sthool drushti or sookshm drushti ke swaroop hai
 Although this notion of fixed problems on Euclide geometry may seem natural, it needs to be analyzed
 eucalidia jyamiti main kuch paribhaashaayen tathaa kuch swayansiddh tathy die hue hai or inkaa taarkik drushti se vikaas kiya gaya he
 These assumptions are only imaginary and independent
 thodaa hi vichaar karne par yah spasht hoga ki eucalidia jyamiti kaa vyavhaar kii vastuon se koi bhi vaastavik sambandh nahin he
 While developing their original fantasies, they had a mutually rational relationship and created an "imaginary" mathematics, which was the basic objective of this geometry
 is uddeshy main yah jyamiti atyant hi safal rahi
 To make this geometry even more "practical", the definition of "ideal object" is that the difference of its two points remains the same under any circumstance
 maapan dand athwa anya aujaaron kaa upyog isi visheshta par nirbhar karata he
 In fact, by incorporating this "ideal hard object", the form of Euclidean geometry changes and we can now understand it as a department of physics
 kintu vyavhaar main eucalidia jyamiti kaa yah parivartan is drushti se nahin dekha jaataa
 When measuring, the principles of Euclidean geometry for measuring practical objects appear to be accurate
 isliye eucalidia jyamiti ko "vaastavik' samajha jane laga
 From the point of view of practical experience and Euclidean geometry, Newton certainly introduced his problems and conceptions of time and the development of iconic physics often depended on these concepts until the beginning of the present century
 newton ne dik ko swatantra satta samajhakar uske gun bhi die
 According to Newton, the properties of a problem are the same in all directions and at all points, that is, the problem is equidistant, equal and similar
 at: padaarthon ke gun dik main sabhi sthanon par samaan hi hote hai
 The problem is infinite and in Newton's problem is uninterrupted by length, time and speed
 kaal ke vishay main bhi newton ne apni dharna di he or yah dharna bhi us samay ke bhautikee ke vikaas ke anusaar hi thi
 According to Newton, Kaal is also an independent entity
 kaal kaa vishesh gun yah he ki vah samaan gati se satat or sarvatra "bahata' he or kisi bhi paristhiti kaa uske upar koi bhi parinaam nahin hota
 Time is also infinite
 saransh main, newton ke anusaar dik tathaa kaal donon hi swatantra or nirpeksh sattayen hoti hai
 The mechanics of Newton etc
 depended on these assumptions
 yantriki main gati or twaran, in donon ke liye dik or kaal ko nishchit rup dena aavashyak tha or us samay to in dharanaon main koi bhi truti dikhaai nahin detii thi
 Likewise, Newton had such an influence in physics that it was not possible to show doubt on these assumptions
 bolai, lobaatchevsky, riman ityadi ganitagyon ne yah siddh kiya ki eucalidia jyamiti ke kuch swayantathyon main uchit parivartan karne par aeuclidia jyamitiyon kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Although many theories of euclideal geometries differ from theories of euclideal geometry, they are not disqualified
 visheshat: riman ke aeuclidia jyamiti se yah spasht hua ki eucalidia jyamiti hi keval moulik nahin he
 Although euclideal geometries are difficult to visualize, their results are extremely interesting and appropriate due to the logic

 Akon's legal suit has been rejected by "the Smoking Gun"
 "da smoking gan" ke lekh ke anusaar, econ kisi bhi aparaadh main abhiyukt nahin the or jaisaa ki pehle hi daawa kiya gaya hai 1999 se 2002 tak unhone jail main samay nahin guzaara
 unhone kaha ki "da smoking gan" kii use "badnaam" karne kii koshish "koi myne nahin rakhata kyonki yah aisa kuch he jise vah bhul jane kii koshish kar rahe hai"
 econ ne muhantod jawaab dete hue kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi teen saal lagaataar jail main nahin bitaye lekin haa choti-choti avadhiyon ke liye avashya dandadesh milte rahen hai jinhen jod kar teen saal mana ja saktaa he
 He went on to quote that there was a mistaken notion of "the Smoking Gun" article about this

 Evolution does not seek to explain the origin of life
 par kram-vikaas yah samajhaata he ki pracheen saral jivan se aaj kaa jatil jivan kaise viksit hua he
 Seeing the similarities between all the castes of today, it can be said that all the creatures of the earth have a common ancestor
 ise antim saarvjaanik purvaj kehete hai
 All the castes of today have arisen from this through the process of evolution
 sabhi shakson ke paas jeens ke rup main anuvaanshik padaarth hota he
 All the individuals take it from their parents and give it to their children
 santanon ke jeens main thodi bhinnata hoti he
 This is due to mutation and alteration of existing genes during sexual reproduction
 iske kaaran santane mata-pita or ek duusare se thodi bhinn hoti hai
 If those variations are useful, then the chances of survival and reproduction of the offspring are high
 iske kaaran agali peedi ke vibhinn shakhson ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna samaan nahin hoti he
 As a result, the traits that make organisms more adapted to their conditions, become more common in the next generations
 ye bhinnataayen dhire-dhire badhati rahati hai
 This process is responsible for the diversity of organisms seen today
 adhikansh genetic utparivartan shakson ko na koi sahaayta pradaan karte hai, na unki dikhaawat ko badalte hai or na hi unhen koi haani pahunchaate hai
 Through genetic drift, these unbiased genetic mutations are only incidentally established in populations and survive for generations
 iske vipareet, prakritik varan ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he kyonki yah un lakshanon ko bachaati he jo jivit rahane or prajnan karne ke liye jaruri hai
 Natural selection and genetic drift are regular and dynamic parts of life
 arabon varshon main in prakriyaaon ne jivan ke vansh vriksh kii shakhaon kii rachana kii he
 The modern thinking of evolution began with the emergence of the book Charles Darwin's Biology, published in 1859
 iske saath grager mendal dwaara padpon par kiye gaye adhyayan ne anuvaanshiki ko samajhane main madad kii
 The discovery of fossils, advances in population genetics and the global network of scientific research have provided more detailed information on the mechanism of evolution
 vaigyanikon ko ab nayi jatiyon ke udgam kii zyada samaj he or unhone ab prajatikaran kii prakriya kaa avlokan prayogshaala or prakruti main kar liya he
 Evolution is the basic scientific principle that biologists use to understand life
 yah kai vishyon main prayog hota he jaise ayurvigyaan, maanas shaastra, jaev sangrakshan, maanavshaastra, forensik vigyaan, krishi or anya saamaajik-saanskrithik vishay
 The main ideas of evolution are summarized as follows: 19 veen shatabdi main prakritik itihaas ke sangrahalay kaafii lokapriy the
 During this time European explorations and naval expeditions carried the natural scientists and collectors of large museums together
 charles darwin ek graduate the jo prakritik itihaas vigyaan ke vishay main shikshit or prashikshit the
 Natural historians like him used to collect specimens for museums, catalog them, describe and study them
 darwin echemes beagal naamak jahaaj par prakritik vaigyanik kaa kaam kar rahe the
 He was assigned a five-year research trip around the world
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone bahut se jeevon ke namoonay ekatrit kiye or unka nirikshan kiya
 He was particularly interested in the diverse fauna of the coasts of South America and the nearby Galápagos Islands
 darwin ko dur-dur ke sthanon se namoonay ekatrit karne or unka adhyayan karne se vyapak anubhav praapt hua
 From these studies he introduced the idea that every caste evolved from ancestors with similar traits
 1938 main unhone samajhaayaa ki yah ek prakritik prakriya se kaise ho saktaa he
 He named this natural process natural selection
 kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar uske parivesh main maujuud sansadhano kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 For the population to remain stable for years, it is necessary to balance the population size and available resources
 parivesh jitani santanon ko aashray de saktaa he, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai
 Due to this, not all persons of any generation can survive
 isliye uttarjivan ke liye jaruri sansadhano ke liye hameshaa ek pratyogi sangharsh bana rahata he
 This made Darwin realize that survival does not depend on mere coincidence
 unhen ehsaas hua ki uttarjivan shakson kii bhinnataaon, yaa "lakshanon", par nirbhar karata he
 Some traits aid the survival of individuals and some hinder it
 parivesh ke zyada anukulit shaks apane kam anukulit pratidwandviyon kii tulana main agali peedi ko zyada santaanen dete hai
 Characteristics that hinder survival and reproduction disappear after a few generations
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main sahaayta karte hai wo peedi dar peedi jamaa hote rahete hai
 In this way, due to the unequal ability of the person's survival and reproduction, the population changes gradually
 praaniyon or padpon main bhinnataaon ke avlokan prakritik varan ke siddhant kii buniyaad bane
 Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a special partnership that helps in pollination of plants
 unhone dekha ki orchidon main aisi bahut sari sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo kiton ko aakarshith karti hai, taaki pushpon kaa paraag unke sharir main chipak jaae
 In this way the kits carry pollen from a male orchid to a female orchid
 orchidon kii jatil dikhaawat ke baavjood, ye visheshikrut bhaag unheen moolbhoot sanrachanaon se banate hai jinase anya pushp banate hai
 In his book Fertilization of Orchids, Darwin proposes that orchid flowers are more adapted to the environment by the process of natural selection from the existing floral parts
 darwin abhi apane vichaaron par anusandhan or prayog kar hi the ki unhen alfred rasal vailes se ek chitthee mili
 In this letter, Wallace described a theory similar to Darwin's theory
 iske kaaran donon ne in siddhanton kaa sanyukt prakaashan kiya
 Wallace and Darwin both looked at the history of life as a family tree, with the tip of the branch representing today's castes and a common ancestor rather than the branching of the branches
 darwin ne kaha ki jivit chizein rishtedaar hai
 This meant that the whole life originated from a few simple ancestors
 or yah bhi sambhaavna thi ki sabhi jeevon kaa ek hi purvaj ho
 Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in his book The Emergence of Animals
 unke siddhant kaa matlab he ki maanav samet sabhi jeev aviraam prakritik prakriyaaon kii upaj hai
 Due to this some religious groups have raised objection to the theory of evolution
 iske vipareet vaigyanik samudaay main 99 pratishat se zyada log is siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai
 Natural selection is often synonymous with survival of the fittest, but this expression originates from Herbert Spencer's book Biology Theory, published in 1864, five years after Darwin's book
 swasthitam kii uttarjivita prakritik varan kii prakriya ko galat dhang se samajhaati he kyonki prakritik varan keval uttarjivan ke bare main nahin he or hameshaa swasthitam hi nahin jivit rahata he
 Darwin's theory of natural selection laid the foundation for the modern theory of evolution
 unke anusandhanon or avlokanon ne dikhaaya ki ek aabaadi ke shaks ek duusare se bhinn hote hai, in bhinnataaon main se kuch bhinnataayen mata-pita se milti hai or prakritik varan in bhinnataaon ko chunata or tyaagta he
 But they could not give a reason for these differences
 apane se pehle ke jeev vaigyanikon kii tarah ve samajhate rahe ki anuvaanshik lakshan upyog yaa anupyog kaa kaaran the, or apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan apane bacchon ko die ja sakate hai
 He tried to find examples of this
 unhone sochaa ki shuturamurg jaise bade udaan rahit pakshiyon kii taangen zyada chalane ke kaaran peedi dar padhi shaktishaalee hoti rahi hongi, or unke pankh kam udne ke kaaran peedi dar peedi kamazor hote rahe honge
 This misconception was called the "heredity of acquired traits", which was part of the theory "change of castes" proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809
 19 veen shatabdi ke ant main yah siddhant ko lamarkwaad kehalaata tha
 Darwin proposed an unsuccessful theory called pangenesis to explain the heredity of traits acquired over a lifetime
 1880 ke dashak main august visman ke prayogon ne dikhaaya ki apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan bacchon ko nahin die ja sakate hai
 Due to this, Lamarckism was abandoned in some time
 nae lakshan mata-pita dwaara santanon ko kaise die jate hai, iskaa uttar anuvanshiki par grager mendal ke agrani kaary se mila
 His experiments conducted over several generations of pea plants proved that genetic information is split at the time of formation of sex cells in the mother and father and that information from the mother and father is added at random during fertilization
 isaki tulana taash ke patton se kii ja sakati he jahaan kisi jeev ko aadhe pattey mata se yadrichhik dhang se milte hai or baaki aadhe pita se yadrichhik dhang se
 Mendel called this information factors, but later the name Jean became more prevalent
 jin anuvanshiki kii mul ikai he
 They contain information that directs the physical development and behavior of the organism
 jin diene se banate hai
 DNA is a long molecule made up of small molecules called nucleotides
 anuvaanshik jaankaree diene main newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main sangrahit hoti he
 DNA can be compared to an article in which nucleotides act as characters
 jis prakaar varnon kii shrunkhlaa se ek bana lekh jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he, usee prakaar newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa se bana diene anuvaanshik jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he
 Genes are instructions made from the letters of the alphabet of DNA
 sabhi jin milakar ek "nirdesh pustika" ke jaise hote hai jisamen ek jeev ko banane or kaam karaane kii sari jaankaree hoti he
 Changing these instructions written in DNA due to mutation increases the genetic variation of the population
 diene keshikaon ke andar chromosomon main hota he
 a random mixture of chromosomes from parents at fertilization gives the offspring a unique combination of genes
 langik janan ke dauraan jeenon kaa yah yadrichhik mishran bhi aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 Genetic variation of a population also increases with breeding with another population
 is kaaran aabaadi main wo jin aa sakate hai jo usamen pehle se maujuud nahin the
 Sequence is not a random process
 haalanki diene main utparivartan yadrichhik dhang se hota he, par prakritik varan yadrichhik prakriya nahin he, uttarjivan or prajnan kii sambhaavna parivesh par nirbhar karti he
 The evolution is the result of natural selection over billions of years of flawed copying
 kram-vikaas kaa parinaam bakubi rachaa gaya jeev nahin hota he
 The result of natural selection is adapted organisms of their existing environment
 kram-vikaas kisi param lakshya kii taraf pragati nahin he
 Evolution does not attempt to create more developed, more intelligent or more complex organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, pissu bichchhu makkhi kehalaae jane vaale ek pankhons vaale jeev ke vanshaj hai, or ajagaron main abhi bhi nanhee sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo unke purvajon ke pichley pairon ke avshesh hai
 Rapid changes in the environment usually lead to extinction of the maximum castes
 prithvi par rahi 99 pratishat se adhik jatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 Five major mass extinctions have occurred since the beginning of life on Earth
 inke kaaran jatiyon kii vividhta main badi or aakasmik giravat hui he
 The most recent of these is the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event, which took place 6
6 million years ago
 genetic drift ek jati kii aabaadiyon main eleelon kii aavruti ke badalane ko kehete hai
 a allele is a variation of a gene
 ye baalo kaa rang, twachaa kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, rakt prakaar aadi nirdhaarit karte hai
 Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles into the population, but it can reduce genetic diversity by removing any alleles from the population
 genetic drift eleelon ke yadrichhik chayan se hoti he
 Selection is truly random when no external force influences it
 udhaaharan ke liye, samaan maap or bhaar par bhinn rangon ke kanchon se bhare ek apaardarshee thile se kuch kanche nikaalnaa ek yadrichhik chayan he
 Whether or not a person will be able to give their alleles to their children depends on their survival in which coincidence also plays a role
 sanyog ke kaaran aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti ke badalane kii is prakriya ko genetic drift kehete hai
 Genetic drift has a greater impact on small populations than on larger populations
 hardi-venberg niyam kahata he ki hardi-venberg samyavastha main hone vaali ek badi aabaadi main pidiyon ke saath eleelon kii aavruti nahin badalegi
 But it is impossible for a population of sufficient size to reach this system because these five things are necessary to reach this system
 1) aabaadi kaa aakaar anant hona chahie
 2) The mutation rate should be zero percent, because mutation can change alleles or create new alleles
 3) aabaadi se yaa main pravrajan nahin hona chahie, kyonki aabaadi main aane vaale yaa aabaadi ko chhodane vaale shaks eleelon kii aavruti ko badal sakate hai
 4) There should be no selective pressure on the population, that is, the probability of survival or reproduction of a person should not be more than others
 5) samagam puri tarah se yadrichhik hona chahie, jahaan sabhi nar baraabar aakarshak saathi hon
 This ensures truly random adulteration of alleles
 hardi-venberg samyavastha main aabaadi taash ke patton ke ek deck ke anuroop he; deck ko chaahe jitani baar phenta jaae, usamen na koi nayaa patta aayega or na koi patta nikalegaa
 The alleles in the population here have been compared to deck leaves
 aabaadi bottlenake paryaavaran kii ghatnaon ke kaaran kisi jati kii aabaadi ke teji se kam ho jane ko kehete hai
 a truly random population bottlenac does not favor any allele; That is, it is random which person will survive
 ek bottlenake aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko kam yaa khatm kar saktaa he
 The subsequent genetic drift may further reduce the genetic diversity of the population
 genetic vividhta kii kami aabaadi ko anya chaynaatmak dabaavon ke jokhim main daal sakati he
 An example of a population bottleneck is the "northern Elephant Seaway"
 19 veen ke atyaadhik shikaar ke kaaran uttari eliphant jalavyaghron kii aabaadi tees shakson se kam ho gai thi
 Due to conservation, the population of these has crossed one lakh and is increasing continuously
 par aabaadi bottlenake ke prabhaav saafe dikhaai dete hai
 In the absence of genetic diversity in the population, these aquifers are at great risk from diseases and are very likely to have genetic disorders
 sansthaapak kaa prabhaav tab hota he jab aabaadi kii ek choti toli baaki aabaadi se alag hokar ek nai aabaadi ban jaati he
 Often this is due to geographical isolation
 is nai aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti aksar puraani aabaadi se alag hoti he
 The genetic designs of the next generations will depend on the genetic designs of the founders, which will be different from the older population
 sansthaapak ke prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan amish logon ke 1744 ke pencilvenia deshaantaran se miltaa he
 The two founders of the Amishite colony of Pennsylvania had recessive alleles of the Ellis – van Kreveld syndrome

 Meetings are a common process in business and other organizations

 If meetings are not arranged on time and efficiently, and decisions taken in this are not implemented in terms of quality, then there is a sharp decline in efficiency

 Meetings should be organized for the following purposes: baithken vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 Broadly, they can be classified into public and commercial meetings
 jaisaa ki pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, baithkon kii yojana samay se pehle kii jaani chahie taki unka safaltaapurvak aayojan kiya ja sake
 The first step in organizing the meeting is that it should be properly organized and constituted
 ek baithak ko tabhi uchit prakaar se yojit kaha ja saktaa he jab sabhi vyaktiyon ko uchit pradhikari dwaara baithak kii soochna jari kii jaati he
 a meeting is duly constituted only when the proper person is present to preside over the meeting and the requisite quorum is present of the persons who are eligible to attend and vote
 isliye, ek vaiyaktik sahaayak / nijee sachiv ko baithak ke liye apekshit vaid karrwai kaa gyaan hona chahie
 The notification is advance notice of the meeting so that the person receiving the information gets an opportunity to prepare himself for the meeting

 The notification should be issued as prescribed in the rules or statutory provisions of the organization or body concerned

 The period required to convene a meeting is also determined by the organization's rules and statutory provisions
 udhaaharan ke liye, company kii varshik aam baithak ke maamle main baithak kii aadhisuchana sadasyon tak baithak se 21 din pehle pahunch jaani chahie
 The Secretary should ensure that the notification of the meeting is received by all the members within the stipulated time
 baithak kii aadhisuchana main baithak kaa din, samay tathaa sthaan kaa ullekh hona chahie
 It should also mention the purpose and nature of the meeting
 yadi niyamon ke antargat apekshit ho to aadhisuchana ke anulgnak yaa sanlagnak ke rup main kuch reporto, vivaranon aadi kii pratiyaan bhi bheji jaani chahie
 a sample of the annual general meeting notification and agenda is given at the end of this lesson
 baithak main shamil hone vaale sadasyon ko baithak kii aadhisuchana ke saath baithak kii kaarysoochee pradaan karnaa ek paramparaagat reeti he
 The schedule of the details of the work to be completed in the meeting is called the 'agenda'
 kaarykram kaa vivaran jis kram main diya jaataa he baithak main usee kram main un par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The agenda is sent to all members of the committee or organization so that they have sufficient time to study the business issues discussed in the meeting before the meeting
 sachiv dwaara adhyaksh ke paraamarsh se yah kaarysoochee taiyaar kii jaati he or ise taiyaar karte samay pichhali baithak kii kaary-madon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 The Secretary should prepare a note on the issues that require the attention of the members, so that they can be included in the agenda of the next meeting
 baithak kii kaarysoochee kii madon ko nimnlikhit sroton se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie: The agenda can also be a part of the notification of the meeting and it can also be attached to the notification
 jab kaarysoochee ko aadhisuchana ke anulgnak ke rup main shamil kiya jaataa he yaa alag se paripatrit kiya jaataa he to isamen nimnlikhit suchanaaen hoti hai: Although the agenda is only part of the notification, it only covers the issues to be raised as other details already exist in the notification
 saamanyat: kysoochee kii pratham mad `pichhali baithak ke kaaryavrihon kii pushti ` hoti he or antim mad `adhyaksh kii anumati se kisi mudde kii anumati` hoti he
 Other issues are arranged based on their importance
 baithak main nemi muddon ko pehle or vivaadaaspad muddon ko baad main lenaa chahie
 The agenda can be prepared in two ways: adhyaksh kii kaarysoochee main saamaanya kaarysoochee kii tulana main aadhik soochna hoti he tathaa adhyaksh kii tippanee ke liye kaagaj kii dahini ore khaali jagah chodi jaati he
 Additional information provides all relevant details to the Chairman which is required during the meeting
 ganapurti ke bina baithak kii karrwai aarambh nahin ho sakati he
 The word 'quorum' originated from the Latin language and is defined as the minimum number of members who attend the meeting compulsorily as required by rules or statutory provisions, if the quorum is not complete, the meeting is not properly organized it could happen
 yadi ganapurti kaa mukhya uddeshy baithak main upasthit sadasyon kii kam sankhya hone par koi nirnay liye jane se rokna he joki aadhiktar sadasyon ko sweekaarya ho
 The number of members required for quorum is detailed in the rules of the organization
 5û adhyaksh: baithak ke mukhiya ko adhyaksh kaha jaataa he
 Another important requirement for a valid meeting is that the meeting is chaired by the Chairman to ensure proper functioning of the meeting in accordance with the rules and statutory provisions
 adhyaksh vah vyakti he jise baithak kii kaarividhiyon kii adhyakshata tathaa aayojan ke liye niyukt kiya jaataa he
 They are appointed for the following purposes: in kartavyon kaa nirvaahan karne ke liye, adhyaksh ko nimnlikhit shaktiyaan yaa pradhikar die gaye hai: The proceedings of the meeting run as per the proposals
 prastaav vichararth tathaa nirnay lene ke liye baithak se pehle hi shamil kiya jaataa he
 This proposal must be in writing and submitted to the Chairman or Secretary before the meeting
 vah sadsy jo prastaav ko parit karana chahta he, sarvapratham adhyaksh kii anumati legaa or tatpashchaat prastaav ko baithak ke samaksh prastut karegaa
 The member bringing this proposal has the right to speak and answer questions at the end of the discussion
 tatpashchaat is prastaav ko kisi anya sadsy dwaara samarthan diya jaataa he or is sadsy ko samarthak kehete hai
 If a member in the meeting does not support the proposal, the motion is dropped and it is not taken up again
 yadi koi prastaav adhyaksh dwaara prastut kiya jaataa he to uske liye samarthak kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 After the proposal is formally presented before the meeting, the Speaker asks the members to express their views
 isprakaar, jab prastaav baithak main rakhaa jaataa he to vah `prashn` ban jaataa he or charchaa ke pashchaat jab us par nirnay le liya jaataa he to ise parit kiya jaataa he, tab yah `sankalp` banataa he
 The proposal can also be brought without joining the agenda, but if the President gives consent for 'any other work' to be included as a 'purpose of urgency' or it is included in a conventional item
 sankalp ko sweekaar kiye jane tathaa baithak ke kaaryvrih main darj kiye jane ke baad yah baithak kaa karyalayi nirnay ban jaataa he
 It should be traditionally proposed, supported and presented before the meeting
 ek sankalp ko us baithak main vikhandit nahin kiya ja saktaa he jisamen use sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Thus, the resolution can be defined as a formal decision on a motion presented before the meeting
 saamanyat:, niyamon main do prakaar ke sankalpon ko parit karne kaa prastaav he: saamaanya sankalp or vishesh sankalp
 When a resolution is passed by a simple majority, it is called a general resolution
 is prakaar saamaanya bahumat se taatpary he ki sankalp ke paksh main pade mat vipaksh ke maton se aadhik hai
 a special resolution is a resolution that is passed by a three-fourths majority
 is prakaar, vishesh sankalp ke paksh main padane vaale mat vipaksh ke maton se teen guna aadhik hone chahie
 The issues to be met by special resolution are specified in the rules of the concerned body
 prastaav par matdaan karne yaa use sweekaar kiye jane se purv us par sanshodhan prastaav kiya ja saktaa he
 Amendment is a proposal by which certain words of a proposal can be added or removed
 ise paramparaagat rup se baithak main prastavit samarthit tathaa parit kiya janaa chahie
 When a proposal is revised, dedicated and accepted, discussion on the revised proposal begins by stopping the discussion on the original proposal
 charchaa ke pashchaat is par matdaan kiya jaataa he or yadi yah paas ho jaataa he to mul prastaav main sanshodhan kiya jaataa he
 The changed proposal is called the 'original proposal' and is then presented in front of the meeting
 yadi matdaan sanshodhan ke paksh main nahin hota he to aadharbhoot prastaav par charchaa ko behaal kiya jaataa he
 In view of the articles, rules and statutory provisions of the organization, the Speaker may suspend the meeting with the consent of the members pending the proceedings of the meeting
 iskaa arth he ki baithak kii kaarywahi ko nishchit yaa anishchit kaal ke liye lambit kiya jaataa he
 This adjournment order can be made for each motion
 jab sthagan aadesh mukhya prastaav ke liye vidhivat rup se prastavit, samarthit kiya jaataa he to aarambhik prastaav par charchaa ko roak diya jaataa he
 If the adjournment motion is approved, it is adjourned for the agreed date or indefinite period and the adjournment motion is discussed and voted upon
 adhyaksh apane visheshadhikaar ke antargat baithak yaa charchaa ko sadbhaavna prayojan ke liye sthagit kar saktaa he
 In other situations, it may also postpone the meeting or discussion when there is no quorum of meeting or there is a lot of chaos during the meeting due to which it is not possible to carry out the proceedings of the meeting or the time required for voting or poll by the ballot Be it or to get information on controversial points, then it cannot stop its proceedings till the end of the meeting for its wish or pleasure
 sthagan baithak kii aadhisuchana jari nahin kii jaati he kyonki ise usee baithak kaa bhaag mana jaataa he tathaa is baithak kii taarikh, samay tathaa sthaan kaa nirdhaaran saamanyat: sthagan prastaav ke samay hi kiya jaataa he
 If the meeting is adjourned for an indefinite period or for more than ten days, a fresh notification is required to be issued
 jab kisi vishesh prastaav par charchaa pragati par ho to kuch sadsy `vyavastha kaa prashn` uthaa sakate hai
 The question of arrangement relates to meeting procedures or standard orders or the structure of the meeting
 udhaaharan ke liye sadsy adhyaksh kaa dhyaan baithak kii kaarywahi sambandhi muddon kii ore aakarshith kar saktaa he jaise ganapurti ke puraa na hone yaa baithak ke saamne rakhaa gaya prastaav baithak ke kaaryakshetra ke adheen nahin ho yaa baithak main anuchit bhashaa yaa abhadra vyavhaar kaa pradarshan kiya gaya ho
 When the question of arrangement is raised, the discussion on the main proposal is stopped
 adhyaksh tatkaal apana nirnay detaa he or vah antim tathaa sabhi ke liye maanya hota he
 After the settlement of the question of arrangement, discussion on the main proposal is resumed
 `kaaryvritt` kaa shabdik arth he sangyaan ko sangrakshit rakhana
 It can be defined as the records of the proceedings of the meeting which are recorded in a concise, precise and clear form
 baithak main upasthit hone tathaa liye gaye nirnaayon kaa vivaran likhane ke liye sachiv uttaradaayi hota he
 It is very important that the names of each resolution pledged and the proposers and endorsers be recorded
 baithak ke kaaryvritt ko taiyaar karne kaa praathmik uttardayitv karypalak kaa hota he
 The personal assistant / private secretary will take dictation and type cleanly

 There are two types of minutes
 kaaryvruth ko khule pannon main rakhana laabhprad he kyonki inhen aasaani se tip kiya ja saktaa he
 If this method is adopted then its safety needs to be ensured
 kaaryvrih ko surakshit rakhana mahatvapurn he kyonki yah baithak, meeting kii kaaryvahiyon kaa mahatvapurn sthaayee abhilekh he jo baad main vyavsaay ke punarikshan ke ullekh main sahaayak hota he
 This helps to find out why certain decisions have been taken
 baithak ke turant pashchaat kaaryvrih taiyaar kar lenaa chahie kyonki ve us samay yaad hote hai
 He should be written as a third person in the past
 kaaryvrih bilkul sahi hona chahie taki usase sahi kaaryvahiyon kaa pradarshan ho
 The brief should be so that talks on important subjects and decisions taken at the next meeting to ensure that those who were absent in the meeting are fully informed about the proceedings and that there is no doubt in the prior deliberations
 kaaryvrih masauda aksar vibhinn kramik rup main anuchhedon, sankhyaon main or samuchit up-sheershak main banaaya jaataa he

 lekin phir jab pehla masauda chapa gaya or elversan kii fil se vaastavik kahani ke vikaas se sambandhit kagaz praapt hue, to gilium ne anichhaapurvak kahani badal di
 But by now it was too late for Elverson to get credit for Phil or to feature in the failed Oscar nomination list
 unhone kaha ki auskar main namakan paane se unhen koi aapatti nahin hoti, haalaanki unhone is katha yaa taiyaar film ke bare main bahut vichaar nahin kiya tha

 It is all about the "eccentricity of our peculiarly organized society and the desire to flee from it by any possible means"

 Gilliam has stated that Brazil is inspired by George Orwell's 1984 - which he admits never to read - but the film is written from a present-day perspective, not looking at the same future as Orwell

 The compiler's art of penetrating the lighting and design of the set and attention to detail was combined with Gilliam's wide hobby and specific hobby of inclined camera angles; It would have been too wide for the general audience who were used to mainstream Hollywood films, with Gilliam taking the film's wide-angle scenes with 14mm, 11mm and 9

"zaldi se sweekaar kar lo, anyathaa tum apni saakh yogyata ko khatre main daal loge

 This pointless, unknown machinery is also evident in the fact that the entire plot of the film comes into motion by a fly, which no one knows about
 In the end, no other but the viewer is fully aware of all the events and their causes or how each person fits in their character

 It can be discussed that the existence of "terrorists" and many "terrorist" activities have been obscured in the film - it is very likely that the main threat of terrorism lies in the government's policy of decentralization, which makes it difficult Hides mistakes and presents another enemy as a goat of sacrifice

 There is no direct evidence that Jill has anything to do with the blasts, or even that Tuttle has committed any terrorist act for which the government blames him — he keeps a firearm for soul protection and is the only one The occasion when he appears to be involved in the explosion also leads to a dream scene of Sam later

 Since nowhere in the film is shown who is actually responsible for the blasts, the task of searching for it is left to the audience

 Violent results that are said to be inspired by Hindu nationalism are called saffron terrorism
 yah shabd hindu dharm ko sambodhit karne vaale kesari rang ke payaiwachi se aya he
 The first use of saffron terrorism was in English in 2002, in an article in an English magazine called Frontline, to address the Gujarat riots
 lekin is shabd kaa adhik prayog 29 sitambar san 2008 ke mumbai ke maalegaanv dhamaake ke baad hua kyonki jaanch ke silsile main dhamaake se sambaddhit, kathith taur par, ek hindu sanghathan se jubie logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 However, the Islamic militant organization Indian Mujahideen was also blamed as it was suspected that the Indian Mujahideen might be involved in the 2006 blasts in the same area
 lekin, jaanch aage badhane ke baad kisi hindu sanghathan ke shaamil hone kii kathith taur par pooshti ho gai
 According to Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar was the first to use the word saffron terrorism
 iskaa jawaab dete hue pavaar ne kaha ki unhone sabase pehle maalegaanv visphot ke baad is shabd kaa upyog kiya tha

 Major Hindu nationalist parties, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, began after the advent of the Hindu ideology
 lekin bhagava rang baudd dhram ke log bhi apanaate he
 Hence saffron terrorism is considered a misnomer and hence names like Hindu terrorism and Hindutva terrorism are adopted

 ye do prakaar kii hoti hai- Chronology or chronology is the science through which we can construct historical events
 isliye yah aavashyak he ki sab ghatnaon ko kisi ek hi sanvatsar main pradarshit kiya jaae
 Only by doing this can we find the sequence of all events and the time span between them
 yah sanvatsar koi bhi ho saktaa he—pracheen yaa arvachin
 Today, most of the year AD is used for this work
 hamaare yahan is kaam ke liye gatkali varsh prayukt hota tha or europe main, pracheen kaal main or kabhi-kabhi aajkal bhi, julian piriad vyavahrut hota he
 Different cultures were prevalent in different countries and diverse periods of the world
 itnaa hi nahin, bharat jaise vishaal desh main aajkal or bhootkaal main bhi bahut se sanwat prachlit the
 The propagation of all these Samvatas started in different periods and their years also started in different seasons
 iske atirikt varsh, maas or dinon kii gananaa kaa prakaar bhi bhinn tha
 Normally, the year was tried to be equal to the Riturachakra, but according to the Islamic period, it was only the year of the twelve lunar months, that is, 354 days, which is not the same as the Ritachakra
 kuch varsh chandra or saura ke mishran hote the, jaisaa aajkal bharat ke anek praanton main prachlit he
 It consists of a year of 12 lunar months, but in two or three years, a half-year is increased to make the middle value of the year equal to that of the season cycle
 prayek ritu-chakra-tulya varsh ko saura varsh bhi kehete hai, kyonki uskaa maan surya se sambhddha hota he
 The lunar month we have mentioned above should actually be called the solar moon, because its base is in combination with the sun and the moon
 poornima tak athwa amavasya se amavasya tak is chandramaada kaa maan hota he
 Just as Varshman's imagination is dependent on the seasons and the month's imagery is dependent on the arts of the Moon, similarly the day is conceived from sunrise, sunset, midnight or midnight
 saamanyat: ek madhyahn se aagaamee madhyahn ke madhya kaal ko ek din kehete hai
 Where the lunar month is prevalent, such as in different regions of India, dates are counted, which are primarily related to the arts of the moon
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki jagat ke vividh pradeshon main alag-alag sanwaton se gananaa hoti he, varsh kaa prarambh bhi bhinn-bhinn rituon main hota he or masganana tathaa dinaganana bhi vividh prakaar kii hoti he
 Now, if we read in an ancient inscription that that day was the most auspicious day of so-and-so month, then the question arises as to what day it was
 bahudhaa iskaa uttar paanaa kathin hota he, kyonki us sanwat kaa aarambh kab hua, uskaa varshmaan kya tha or uske maas tathaa din kis prakaar gine jate the, in sab baton kaa gyaan praapt kiye bina ham us din kaa kalnirnay nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, it is necessary that the beginning of different vows of the world, that is, the beginning of their first year, should be told in any one of the certified vows
 jagat main pracheen kaal se aaj tak bahut se sanvatsar chalate aae hai
 The instruction of them all is the subject of a detailed article
 at: parishisht main bharat ke pracheen evam arvachin kuchhek mukhya sanwaton ke prarambh kaa kaal hi denge
 Nowadays there is a system of giving the period of most events in the year AD
