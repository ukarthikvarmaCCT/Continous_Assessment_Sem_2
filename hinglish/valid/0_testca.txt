 Not only this, the rally of BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain in Bengal has also not been approved
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath purulia ke liye nikal chuke hai
 Let me tell you that where CM Yogi was to hold a rally in Purulia, Shahnawaz Hussain in Murshidabad
 sutron kii maane to sarkaar ne paper work puraa nahin hone ko vajah bataaya he
 However, the Bharatiya Janata Party says that the rally will take place at the same place
 kyonki siem yogi adityanath raily ke liye ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Earlier, in the event of CM Yogi not getting permission for landing of helicopter in Bengal, BJP had made a new plan
 bijepi kii nai yojana ke tahat purulia main raily ko sambodhit karne ke liye siem yogi pehle vimaan se ranchi gaye, vahaan se helicopter se bokaro or phir sadak ke raste purulia pahunchane vaale hai
 Expressing his displeasure over not getting permission from the state administration to hold a rally in Murshidabad in West Bengal, senior BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said on Tuesday that there was no rule of law in the state, and insisted that he would go to Murshidabad 
 shavanvaaj hossain ne kaha, ‘mamata banerjee kii sarkaar ne murshidaabad main meri sabha ko ijaajat na dekar mujhe rokane kii koshish kii he, lekin main darane vaala nahin hum or na hi rukne vaala hum
 He said that the BJP will give a befitting reply to the oppressive Mamta government
 pehle yogiji kii sabha ko rokane kii koshish hui, phir meri sabha rokane kaa prayaas hua he
 He asked 'what kind of forest rule does Mamata Banerjee want in West Bengal
 ' ullekhneey he ki isse pehle uttarapradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko rajya main sabha karne kii anumati nahin mili
 Due to this, allegations between BJP and Trinamool Congress were seen
 siem yogi adityanath kii aaj purulia main raily kareeb dopaher teen baje honi he
 The Mamta government of Bengal has not allowed her helicopter to land
 yahi vajah he ki ab unka helicopter jharkhand ke bokaro main land karegaa or vah yaheen se sadak maarg se purulia ke liye niklenge
 Explain that the distance from Bokaro to Purulia is about 50 to 55 kilometers

 The two countries are discussing trade in petroleum products, including import of liquefied natural gas from India
 adhikari ne kaha ‘‘ bharat se shuruuaat main kul jarurat ke paanch se 10 fisad ke baraabar aayaat karne kaa prastaav he kyonki hamen tel aapurti suraksha or nirbharta maamle par satark or chaukas rahanaa he

 desh kii pavitra nadi ganga kii safai ke liye sarkaar ne plan taiyaar kar liya he
 As per the information received from the sources, the government has now made up its mind to make a law in this regard

 If reliable sources are to be believed, a one-hour sound show will also be conducted for the Ganga river cleanup campaign in Varanasi and Haridwar to make people aware

 The old saying is 'one who will sleep, sleep will lose and one will wake up, sleep will get' but scientists have concluded that staying in bed in the weekend is beneficial for health

 On Monday, the Prime Minister said one thing while launching the digital version of Ramcharitmanas by Goswami Tulsidas in Delhi

 If you do not understand the Prime Minister, then you can understand the same thing from this part of the poem by the famous poet Loop
 tippaniyan Is the most dangerous hamaare sapanom kaa mar janaa Is the most dangerous murda shanti se bhar janaa Yearning sab kuch sahan kar janaa Get out of home at work or kaam se lautakar ghar aana Is the most dangerous hamaare sapanom kaa mar janaa You must also be tired of reading such a long report
 darasal girohon ko maaloom he ki aap thak jate hai
 It is a matter of pride that the BJP leaders said that the path of violence is not right
 lingayat samaaj ke netaa yeduyrappa ne kaha ki kalburgi lingayat samaaj kii shaan the
 Condemn his murder
 hatya hone par hatya kii ninda thik he
 Now all this is changing in practice
 pune main narendra dabholkar kii hatya kar di jaati he
 Gobind Pansare is killed
 ham chup ho jate hai
 How sad it is to question the intent to condemn

 kalburgi maar die gaye
 Someone who writes more than a hundred books must be committing a crime, which when killed, our society would change the channel and start seeing colorful stories
 vaise kai log khush bhi the
 Will anyone take action against the tweeter of happiness after the murder
 koi naam lekar ninda karegaa
 You keep watching who does what
 karnataka main congress kii sarkaar he
 When Narendra Dabholkar was killed in Maharashtra, Congress N
 si
 P
 kii sarkaar thi
 The Congress leaders have given sharp statements but there is no struggle on the streets against the politics of guarding against communalism and morality
 congress shaayad naap rahi hogi ki kitna bole to koun naaraaz hoga or kitna bole to koun naaraaz nahin hoga
 The inspector can also declare an inquiry in the name of action
 sampradayikta ek zehar he
 The society should have been taken seriously when Prime Minister Narendra Modi said to the Red Fort on August 15
 ravivaar ko kalburgi kii hatya ke baad se lekar lekar somvaar ko din ke gyaarah baje tak ke unke twit dekhe
 There was no news condemning this murder
 thik baat he ki jaanch hone tak koi kaise kah de ki kis sanghathan kaa haath he
 Not to say that at all
 lekin kya tab bhi kuch nahin kahana chahie jab kisi ladke ko kisi ladki ke saath ghoomane ke jurm main car se utaar kar bijli ke khambhe se baandh diya jaae
 Surrey market should be killed
 ye jo ladkaa pita wo mazahab se musalmaan he, gunaah sirf itnaa ki ek hi jagah kaam karne vaali hindu mahila ke saath ja rahaa tha
 On the way, the mob stopped and started hitting the car
 police ke aane tak is pitayee kaa video local channel par chalaaya ja chukaa tha
 13 people of Bajrang Dal were also arrested, but will we always take such incidents in the usual way
 kya aap vaaki sweekaar karne liye taiyaar ho gaye hai ki koi aapke likhane-bolne se lekar kisi ke saath ghoomane tak par nazar rakhe, tay kare
 Many such incidents have happened in Karnataka
 har ghatana ke baad shok sabha hoti he magar koi raajnneetik sakriyata nahin hoti
 Our politicians are scared
 daraane waalon ko shah dene lage hai
 As a result, school college institutions are also becoming timid
 itani darpok ki mangalore main teen saal puraani tasviir nikaal kar do ladakiyon ko sharmasaar kiya jaataa he
 After taking his picture out of fun, the people of ABVP came to the college and told the Principal that this is causing the downfall of morality
 college un do ladakiyon ko nilambit kar detaa he
 Have the girls given political organizations the right to monitor their wear and tear
 dena chahengi
 
 
 
 ham sab kya hote ja rahe hai iskaa andaaza desh ke sabase shaktishaalee netaa ko to he
 You must have listened to his talk too, but once again listen, you can get an answer
 somvaar ko pradhanmantri ne dilli main goswami tulsidas krit ramcharitamanas kaa digital sanskan laanch karte hue ek baat kahi he
 Their reference was to the government employees but it applies to all of us
 jivan mashin ban jaataa he
 Same morning, same files to return in the evening
 zindagi ke bade mahatvapurn saal you hin guzar jate hai
 Entered this pipeline after thirty thirty five years will come out there
 kahin ham sab pipeline main to band nahin ho gaye hai
 May it not happen that when we get out on the other side, someone else is waiting for us
 bandook lekar
 To calculate your writing
 pradhanmantri kii baat samaj nahin ai to aap isi baat ko mashhoor kavi pash kii ek kavita he uske is ansh se bhi samaj sakate hai
 The comments sabase khataranaak hota he Our dreams die sabase khataranaak hota he Fill the dead peace tadap kaa na hona Bear everything ghar se nikalnaa kaam par And come home from work sabase khataranaak hota he Our dreams die aap bhi thak gaye honge ki itani lambii report padhakar

 ' bharat ke purv cricketer akaash chopra ne bhi is khilaadi kii tarif kii
 Centuries of emperor Sachin Tendulkar (108 not out), showing his charismatic batting brilliantly, hit the 48th hundred on Wednesday to take the Indian Naiya, trapped in the vortex in the second Test cricket match against Sri Lanka, almost to a safe place
 virendra sahvaag (99) keval ek ran se shatak se chook gayi or madhyakram ladkadaane se bharat kaa score chaar wicket par 241 ran ho gaya
 Tendulkar remained at one end and found a good partner in his first Test match playing as Suresh Raina (66 not out) with whom he has shared an unbroken 141-run partnership for the fifth wicket
 in donon kii saahasik pariyon se bharat ne tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone par chaar wicket par 382 ran banaaye
 Trailing 0-1 in the three-match series, India are now 260 runs behind Sri Lanka and need 61 runs to save the follow-on but Tendulkar and Raina are on course
 tendulkar ne phir se chamakdaar pari kheli to raina kii bhi tarif kerani hogi jinhone apane adarsh ballebaaj ke saath puure damakham ke saath doosraa chor sanbhale rakhaa
 Tendulkar has so far faced 181 balls with 14 fours and a six while Raina's 133-ball innings included eight fours
 subah sahvaag or murali vijay (58) ne shuruaati dedh ghante main puri sahajata se gendbaajon kaa saamana kiya lekin 29 gend or aath ran ke andar teen wicket ganvaane se bharat baikfoot par chalaa gaya
 While Sehwag became India's seventh batsman to be dismissed for 99, Vijay did not last long after completing his half-century and Rahul Dravid (3) failed for the third consecutive inning
 srilanka kii taraf se donon spinner ajanta mendis or suraj randiv ne do-do wicket liye
 India started the day playing 95 runs without any loss
 sahvaag ne din ke duusare over main hi dilhara furnando kii gend par do chauke jamaaye lekin iske baad unhone bhi sanbhalkar khilne ko tarjeeh di
 When the Delhi batsman was on 89, Thilan Samaraweera off Mendis left his easy catch in the backward point area
 sahvaag haalanki iskaa phayda uthaane main naakaam rahe
 When everything was going in favor of India and Sehwag, this aggressive opener gave Sri Lanka his wicket in reward
 sangakaara ne randiv ko akraman par lagaaya
 Sehwag missed his first ball in his attempt to send it for six runs and Prasanna Jayawardene stumped him out easily
 sahvaag ne vijay ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 165 ran kii saajhediri or is dauraan 101 gend khelkar 15 chauke lagaaye
 India could still recover from the shock that Mendis mislead Vijay in his next over, who went to the backfoot to play but had to lbw and return to the pavilion
 vijay kii 124 gend kii pari main aath chauke shaamil hai
 The team had great confidence with Dravid but his first shot after landing at the crease was not full of confidence
 iske baad unhone haalanki sahaj hone kii koshish kii lekin randiv ne lunch se thik pehle unhen elbeadblyoo karke bharat ko bhavar main fansaa diya
 Laxman, on the other hand, was slowly pushing the innings after going through some odd situations, but then Mendis entangled his beloved victim into the trap of googly
 lakshmana is gend ko aage badhkar khelnaa chaahate the lekin chook gayi or ampire ne elbeadblyoo kii joardaar apil par ungali uthaa di
 This is the sixth occasion when this Hyderabad batsman became the victim of Mendis
 tendulkar ne haalanki jeevandaan kaa puraa phayda uthaaya or iske baad puure adhikaar se ballebaaji kii
 He hit a six off long on off Randiv's ball to reach his run-rate of 50 runs and then hit two consecutive fours in the next over of the same bowler
 tendulkar ne randiv kii gend par hi sweep shaat khelkar apana 48waan shatak puraa kiya
 This is his ninth century against Sri Lanka and he has again become the highest run-scorer between these two teams
 raina par shuru main pehali baar test pari khilne kaa dabaav dikhaa lekin vah jald hi isse ubar gayi
 The left-handed batsman played several strokeful strokes after Mendis survived one of two reliable appeals of LBW

 While the announcement of debt waiver has brought relief to the farmers, on the other hand, the problems of banks have increased
 kanpur main state bank of india ke staff association ke jonal mantri susheel pandeya kehete hai ki recovery ke aakhri maheene main karj maafee ke vaade se bainkon ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In fact, it will not be easy for the SP government to forgive the debt of farmers
 rajya ke krishi nideshaalay main tainaat ek ucch adhikari bataate hai ki rajya main kareeb 30 lakh kisaan aise hai jinhone vibhinn sahakaari samitiyon, sahakaari or rashtriyakrut bainkon se fasali rin, khaad or upkaran kharidne ke liye karj liye hai

 Modi said in an election rally that it is shameful to propagate Sonia Gandhi on the issue on which the Congress has lost the right to speak
 modi ne kaha, ‘shrimati gandhi ne kaha he ki gujarat kii sadaken khastahal hai
 Is it worth believing? He (sonia) described the farmers of Gujarat as inferior
 kya isi se gujarat krishi main 11 pratishat kii vikaas dar paa rahaa he
 Significantly, earlier in the day, while addressing election rallies in Mandvi in south Gujarat and Keshod in Saurashtra, Sonia criticized the bjp's claim of development in Gujarat as hollow and inaccurate

 On the social media, where the statements of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and his supporters are being discussed in recent days
 vahiin 4 saal puraani arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party (aap) ne bhi pichley kuch maheenon main soshal media par lakhon samarthak jutaaye hai
 What is the reality of millions of social media supporters associated with Aam Aadmi Party? Are these supporters faked? Or is it not a new strategy of the Aam Aadmi Party for mere fame? Till date, reporter Ashutosh Mishra tried to find answers to all these questions
 twitaralgbhag 4 saal se zyada puraani aam aadmi party ke twitor pej par march 2017 tak 4
 There were 1 million followers but from April 2017 to the third week of October there has been a huge increase in the supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party's Twitter page and about one million new supporters have added to the party's Twitter page
 fasebukayah keval aap ke twitor acount nahin balki fasebuk acount kaa bhi he
 Aam Aadmi Party's reach on Facebook 1
 2 million tak ho gai he
 Members of the party's cyber army point out that the party's reach on Facebook has increased by more than 50% in a more active way in the last 5 months
 ab sawaal yah he ki aakhir in chaar paanch maheenon main aam aadmi party ko itane samarthak kaise mili? kya samarthan jutaney ke liye nakli acount kaa sahaara liya gaya he? in sawaalon ke jawaab dhundne ke liye hamane aam aadmi party ke fasebuk pej or twitor acount par post kiye jane vaale sandeshon kii tulana kii
 Till the Punjab assembly elections and the Municipal Corporation elections of Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party leader of all his party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal continued to attack fiercely against BJP and Central Government almost daily
 aae din nae- nae muddon par aam aadmi party kaa puraa netritv pradhanmantri modi or bijepi par hamale karata rahaa
 The entire series, which lasted more than 1 year, started receiving negative feedback after a time
 aam aadmi party sutron ke mutabik dilli kaa nagar nigam chunaav haarane ke baad party ne manthan kiya or apni ranneeti main baari badlaav laane kaa nirnay kiya
 The effect of this changed strategy began to appear in the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party in the last four to five months whether it was their statements in the media or their reactions in social media
 lagaataar chunaav haarane ke baad ek nai ranneeti seam aadmi party soshal media par bijepi or piem modi ke khilaaf nakaaratmak prachaar ko chhodkar aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or party kii nitiyon ke sakaaratmak muddon par baatcheet shuru kar di
 Social media members and leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party were also instructed to take the decisions of the Delhi government among the public
 fasebuk se lekar twitor par dilli sarkaar dwaara swasthya or shiksha ke kshetra main uthaae har kadam or har faisle ko zyada se zyada prasaarit karne kii ranneeti banaai gai
 Not only this, the Aam Aadmi Party handed over the entire earnings of its social media team to Arvind Jha, close to Arvind Kejriwal, on the party's supporters
 pichley kuch maheenon main aam aadmi party dwaara vipakshi dalon or khaskar bijepi ke khilaaf chalaae ja rahe abhiyaan main ek badi tabdili najar ai he
 The party resorted to sarcasm and cartoons on social media, barring offensive language and role played by party leaders and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 party ke soshal media prabharee arvind jha ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki soshal media par netaaon ke bayanon se zyada cartoon kaa asar hota he kyonki cartoonon ko bolne ke liye bhashaa kii jarurat nahin hoti or yah zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane main kargar sabit hote hai saath hi cartoon se sandesh behatar madhyam se pahunchataa he
 How big AAP supporters on social media? Arvind Jha, the head of the Aam Aadmi Party's IT cell, said that in the last few months, the party has made a drastic change on social media under which the party has a dialogue between the government leadership cadres and the social media team in Delhi
 a synergy has been established that was previously lacking
 aam aadmi party ke fasebuk pej or twitor handle par cartoon ke alaava kejariwal sarkaar ke faislon or project kii choti-choti video clip bhi share kii ja rahi he
 Arvind Jha says that these small videos are getting more support than ordinary photos and through which the Aam Aadmi Party is able to put forth its point in a strong way
 main chaar-paanch maheene main lakhon samarthakon ke party ke soshal media se judane ke sawaal par arvind jha ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne logon ke bich apni nitiyaan or sarkaar ke kaamon ko le jane kii koshish kii he
 According to Arvind Jha, till the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, the government was not able to reach the people about the work being done in Delhi and this was a big reason why we were not able to reach the people and more people were not getting party Were able to connect with aam aadmi party ne apane twitor or fasebuscountse puche jane vaale sandeshon kii sankhya main bhi badlaav kiya
 As of March 2017, where the average Aam Aadmi Party used to post 24 to 30 messages on social media, it has been reduced from 16 to 18
 in sabhi post par sarkaar se jude video yaa phir vipaksh ke khilaaf cartoon ke jariye muddon par charchaa kii ja rahi he
 Your social media head Arvind Jha says that despite reducing the number of posts on social media, its effect is being seen more
 arvind jha kaa kahana he ki vipakshi dal hone ke naate ham bijepi or centre sarkaar par sawaal uthaanaa nahin chhod sakate kyonki maujuuda halaat main arthvyavastha se lekar saamaajik samarasata main jo badlaav dekhne ko mil rahaa he uske liye sawaal uthaanaa jaruri he
 Arvind Jha said that the manner of these questions has now been changed by the Aam Aadmi Party
 arthvyavastha se lekar ke nafrat kii raajnneeti tak har muddon par vah sarkaar ko kataaksh yaa cartoon ke jariye gherne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party is going to conduct a new experiment on social media from next month
 is prayog ke tahat party ab sabhi rajyon main soshal media kii team gathit karegi or isi prayog ke tahat har rajyon main maujuuda rajya sarkaron ke kaamkaaj kii tulana dilli main kejariwal sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se kii jaaegi
 The case comparison of the government and your government's work of opposition parties will be made effective content through video or graphics and will be broadcast on social media
 kaise kaam karti he aap kii soshal media team?arvind singh ke mutabik ek phul time soshal media team banaakar uski or uske kaamkaaj kii saptahik samiksha kii jaati he
 In the review, the kind of content which gets more supporters and more impact, the kind of content is spread more aggressively on social media and tries to reach and connect more and more people

 Rahul Gandhi Social Media Controversy: Talking about the issue of getting Retreat on Rahul Gandhi's social media account and his tweet, Aam Aadmi Party's social media head Arvind Jha said till date that the proliferation of social media accounts by bots is not new because it The US was also seen in the presidential election, which was used extensively by Russia
 arvind jha ke mutabik boats ke istemaal se paripeksh badalane main madad milti he lekin yah purnakalik nahin he
 According to Arvind Jha, not only the boats but also the statements of Rahul Gandhi in recent days on social media and the changes in his style are also being liked by the people due to which he is getting support

 bisisiai sachiv pad se istipha de chuke sanjay jagadale kaa kahana he ki khel premiyon kaa vishwaas behaal karne ke liye badi str par safai kii jarurat he
 Jagdale said that the spot-fixing episode of IPL has caused a huge loss to cricket
 jagadale ne shanivaar ko kuch sanvadaataaon ke saamne kaha, ‘ipel main phixing kii ghatnaon se cricket ko khaasaa nuksaan hua he
 To overcome this, a lot of cleaning will have to be done
 parantu yah kaam itani jaldi nahin hoga, kyonki nuksaan bahut bada he
 The 62-year-old sports administrator said that it is difficult to stop fixing in cricket and the BCCI has its limitations, but the BCCI can curb the fixing by further strengthening its monitoring system
 iske saath hi, bisisiai ko phixing ke doshi cricketron ke liye kadi sajaa ke praavdhaan karne honge
 Jagdale said, "to restore the lost faith of cricket lovers, all the BCCI actors must first show strong will and take steps together
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki bisisiai ko soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) kanoon ke daayre main laaye jane se phixing rokane main madad mil sakati he
 Jagdale said, "if Sreesanth (under spot fixing) threw the handkerchief Khonskar the ball in the waist, then what will RTI do in it
 ’unhone kaha ki vah is vichaar ke bhi paksh main nahin hai ki bisisiai yaa kisi anya khel sanghathan ko kendriya khel mantralay ke tahat laayaa janaa chaiye
 Jagdale, pointing to the alleged scam of crores of rupees at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, said, “the Delhi Commonwealth Games were also held under the Sports Ministry
 in khelon ke aayojan se khel mantri sidhe jude the
 i do not need to speak much about it
 ’bisisiai ke sachiv or koshadhyaksh padon se kramash: jagadale or ajay shirake ke istifon se bisisiai adhyaksh en
 There has been increasing pressure on Srinivasan to step down as the chairman of this cricket organization
 is bare main puche jane par jagadale ne kaha, ‘mere istife kaa shrinivasana ke pad chhodane yaa nahin chhodane se koi sambandh nahin he
 My resignation was my personal decision
 shrinivasana istipha denge yaa nahin, yah unka nirnay hoga
 Jagdale made it clear that he would not attend the BCCI emergency meeting on 2 June in Chennai
 unhone kaha, ‘jab maine bisisiai sachiv pad se istipha de diya he, to meraa is baithak main shaamil hone kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 Now in what capacity will i go to this meeting? ’baharhaal, varisht prashaasak ne is apaat baithak ko ‘jaruri’ bataate hue bharosa jataayaa ki isamen bisisiai ke ‘paripakv’ padaadhikari cricket or is khel sanghathan ke hit main nirnay lenge
 On the news of International Cricket Council (ICC) warning about Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, Jagdale said, "no such warning ever came to my notice
 mujhe is bare main tivi kii khabaron se hi pataa chalaa he
 He denied the mutual tussle between different factions in the BCCI against the backdrop of the IPL spot-fixing case, saying, "I never felt during my tenure as BCCI secretary that there was any factionalism in this organization
" ’jagadale ne ipel spot phixing prakaran kii jaanch ke liye gathit ayog main shaamil nahin hone ke apane faisle ke bare main kaha, ‘main is jaanch ayog main nahin rahanaa chahta, kyonki main isamen sahaj mahasoos nahin kar rahaa tha
 Anyway, i have not been much associated with IPL
 is ayog main un logon ko rakhaa janaa chaiye, jo ipel ke sanchaalan se sidhe jude hai
 Asked whether Jagdale's return as BCCI secretary is open after Srinivasan's resignation, he said, "I (in this position) have not even looked towards the door of return

 ' kitaab:karnaj wif: da outcasts queenlekhika:kavita kaneprakashan:roopa publikeshnakimat:295 rupecovar:paperbazham sabane kabhi na kabhi, kisi na kisi rup main mahabharat ko padhaa he or iske kirdaaron ko janaa-samajha he
 Be it Bhishma Pitamah or the blind King Dhritarashtra, the eldest brother of the Kauravas, Duryodhana or the Gandivadhari Arjuna
 in sabhi kirdaaron ke bare main aapane vistaar se padhaa hoga
 But have you thought about the character who is one of the most interesting characters in this epic
 ji haa, daanveer karn
 Karna is a character who did not leave his friend Duryodhana
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki vah galat paksh kaa saath de rahaa he, usne aakhri samay tak apni mitrataa ko nibhaayaa
 Knowing the truth of his birth, he also fought against his brothers
 aakhir kyon?karn se jude kai sawaal aapke or ham sabake dimag main aate honge or shaayad lekhika kavita kaane ke dimag main bhi aae
 That is why, based on Karna's life, he wrote 'karnaz Wife: The Outcasts Queen'
 kavita ne mahabharat ke har adhyay main karn ke mahatv ko bahut hi sundar dhang se pesh kiya he
 He created a fictional character to explain Karna's sentiments and named him 'uruvi'
 pukeya kii rajkumarior kitaab main karn kii duusari patni uruvi ke madhyam se kavita kaane ne mahabharat ko ek nayaa aayam diya he
 Uruvi like this is the brainchild of poetry, but the way in which it is threaded into Karna's life does not seem to be just imagination
 kahani shuru hoti he us teerandaji pratiyogita se jise bhishma pitamah ne kauravon or pandavon ke teerandaji kaushal ko duniya ke saamne pesh karne ke liye yojit kiya tha
 Where Karna arrived without calling and claimed that he was a better warrior than Arjuna and was ready to fight immediately with Kuntiputra
 yaheen uruvi ne karn ko pehali baar dekha tha
 The celestial splendor of his face, the sparkle of his eyes, his powerful body, his golden armor and the coil, all tied Uruvi at first sight
 uruvi karn se prem karne lagi
 Knowing that Karna is a sutputra, Uruvi decided that she would put a necklace of flowers in Karna's neck in her swayamvara
 karn ke saath-saath uruvi ne uske jivan ke sangharsh ko bhi apana liya
 Uruvi adopted not only Karna but also his parents, brother and first wife Vrishali
 karn bhi uruvi ke bina adhuraa tha
 He had an open book in front of Uruvi and considered it his strength
 donon hi ek saath apni duniya main behad khush the magar ek dar or chintaa uruvi ko andar hi andar khaati thi or vah thi uske pati kii duryodhana se atoot mitrataa
 Uruvi feared that Karna's friendship with Duryodhana might not take her away from her husband forever
 vah jaanati thi ki karn kii salaamati pandavon ke khilaaf nahin balki unke saath khadey hokar hi he
 Each important event of the Mahabharata has been shown by Kavita very deeply from the perspective of Karna
 amuk samay karn ke antarman main kya chal rahaa tha, kya the uske vichaar, uski bhavanaaen, yah sab gaharaai se jaanane ke liye aapako yah kitaab zarur padhani chahie
 This book will connect you with itself, or rather it will connect with Karna
 jitani khubsuurati se karn kii bhaawanaaon ko likhaa gaya he, aap bhi is daanveer se prem karne ko majaboor ho jaayenge
 And speaking of Uruvi, Kavya Kane has to be admired that the beautiful narration of a real legend through a fictional character without twisting it is not common
 karn kii zindagi se jude aapke har sawaal kaa jawaab is kitaab main rakhane kii koshish kii gai he
 Everyone believed that Karna, who believed in religion, accepted the friendship of Duryodhana and went on the path of wrongdoing himself
 lekin yah kitaab ek baar phir yahi baat sthapit karne kii koshish karti he ki karn ke liye dosti hi sabase bada dharm thi or isi mitrataa ke liye usne hansate hansate apni jaan de di

 Ever since the Indian team has been announced for the three odis played in Australia and the series of five odis and 3 T20 matches to be played in New Zealand tour after that, only two things are being discussed the most
 karodon crickteprami mahendra dhoni kii tii-20 team main vaapasi ke bare mencharcha kar rahe hai, to baaten is bare main bhi ho rahi hai ki rishabh pant ko vanade team main kyon nahin liya gaya
 However, now Chief Selector MSK Prasad has clarified why Rishabh Pant was ignored
 vaise is faisle ke baad yah dekhne kii baat hogi ki kahin is faisle kaa asar pant ke baaki do test maichon ke pradarshan par to nahin padegaa
 What does @ msdhoni's return to the T20 side say? That he wants to play till the T20WC in 2020? After team selection, a lot of people questioned that where KL Rahul was retained in the team of both the formants despite the poor form, then Pant was not convinced
 Why was there no place in odis
 baharhaal, emesake prasad ne is par sahmati nahin jataai ki kisi or khilaadi ko samyojit karne ke liye pant ko bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 Also, he pointed out that Pant is not out of India's World Cup planning
 Cricket: Rishabh Pant out as Dinesh Karthik returns to India's ODI fold https: / / t
 co / hucetcxcfe Prasad said that not taking Pant into the team is a purely strategic decision
 unhone kaha ki dhoni ko chah tii20 maichon ke liye rest diya gaya tha
 Dhoni did not play in the first T20 matches played in Windid and thereafter in Australia, allowing Pant and Karthik to play more matches
 or is dauraan pant or karthik ne kaaphi match khele hai
 He said it was time for 37-year-old Dhoni to return to the team
 dhoni kii anpusthiti me pant ne khele teen tii20 muqablon main ek ardhashatak banaaya
 Pant said that we had clearly said that we are going to give Dhoni rest for six matches so that Dinesh Karthik and Rishabh Pant can get more time
 prasad ne kaha ki dhoni kii vaapasi kaa ekmaatr yahi kaaran he
 He said that now that only 13 odis are to be played before the World Cup, we have identified twenty such players, who will be seen playing in these 13 matches to be played
 chif selector bole ki test siries ke baad pant ko brake diya jayega, jisase vah vishwa cap ke liye taro-taaja hokar laut sake
 He made it clear that Pant would play five odis against England a before preparing for the World Cup
