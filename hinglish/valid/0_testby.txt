 Eminent lawyers say that it is a surprising joke of the law that Sudhindra Kulkarni, former assistant to senior BJP leader LK Advani, who tried to highlight corruption in the note-for-vote scam and who reported crime from all angles Thea is in jail

 ve spasht karte hai, ''yahi baat kulkarni par lagu honi chahie, jinhone yah kaam bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne ke liye kiya, na ki khud ko laabh pahunchane ke liye
 Vaidyanathan says that the court should take this as an aspect to exonerate and free Kulkarni
 ve kehete hai, ''is tarah ke maamalon main vyaktiyon ke saath bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie or na unke saath abhiyukt kii tarah pesh aana chahie
 "the judge is bound by the fundamental principles of the criminal justice process," says senior advocate Dushyant Dave
 is kaaran use aparaadh karne vaale vyakti or aparaadh ko saamne laane vaale vyakti main bhed jarur karnaa chahie
 If a judge is not able to do this, then in my view he is committing judicial misconduct and denial to the rule of law, especially in the present circumstances, when one of the biggest challenges facing the country is corruption

 The bugle of assembly elections in Gujarat is over
 donon pramukh partiyon ne apni ranneeti par kaam shuru kar diya he
 Meanwhile, the Congress has refused to contest elections in association with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 gujarat congress ke adhyaksh bharat singh solanki ne buudhvaar ko hi kaha ki congress aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main ensipi ke saath gathbandhan nahin karegi
 Solanki made this announcement, describing the NCP as bjp's B-party
 magar, bada sawaal ye he ki kya congress kaa ensipi ke saath chunaav main na janaa use koi nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he? yaa kya phir koi aisi surat banegi, jo bijepi ke vijayi rath ko aage badhaane main bhoomika nibhaa sakati he? isse bhi bada sawaal ye ki kya ensipi gujarat main itnaa dam-kham rakhti he ki chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakati he?vidhansabha chunaav nateezon ke aankadon par gaur karen to tasviir dhoomil najar aati he
 The NCP was established in 1999 and the party contested the 2002 assembly elections in Gujarat
 ensipi ne 81 siton par chunaav ladaa, jinamein se 77 siton par uske ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Just 1 to NCP
 71 fisadi vot mila
 In 2007, NCP tried again in the 2-seat 2007 assembly elections
 is chunaav main ensipi ne sirf 10 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare or party kaa pradarshan kaaphi behatar rahaa
 Total 1 to NCP candidates
 65 fisadi vot mili or party ke 3 vidhayak jitkar aae
 After this, the performance of NCP declined in the 2012 assembly elections and just 0
 95 fisadi vot mila
 The NCP won 2 seats in this election
 aankadon se saaf he ki 182 siton vaali gujarat vidhansabha main ensipi khaasi kamjor he
 However, the party tries to contest as many seats as possible
 congress gujarat kii satta se 20 saal se baahar he, aise main agar ensipi ke saath milakar chunaav ladati he to mumkin he party ke vot share or siton main kuch badhotaree ho jaae
 However, after being ousted from power in 1995, the Congress has not even touched the figure of 60 seats
 aise main ensipi kii 2 yaa 3 siton kaa sahaara bhi use satta ke shikhar tak pahunchaa paae, aisa sambhav najar nahin aata
 If the ncp's support to the BJP is estimated, then in such a situation it can prove to be a bonus for the BJP
 haal main hue rajyasabha chunaav main bhi ensipi ke ek vidhayak ne bijepi ummidavaar ko vot karne kaa daawa kiya tha
 At the same time, the past of NCP in Gujarat also appears to be inclined towards BJP
 lihaaja, pratyaksh rup se gathbandhan main na sahi, paroksh rup se team-bi ke rup main bhi agar ensipi chunavi samar main aati he, to bijepi ke liye phydemand hi sabit hoga
 Apart from NCP in Gujarat, JDU, Gujarat Parivartan Party and Bahujan Samaj Party also try on a large number of seats
 in teenon party ke aankadon ko dekha jaae to siton kii sankhya main na ke baraabar he, magar vot pratishat donon main kisi bhi party ke nateezon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Gujarat Parivartan Party 3 in the last election
 63 fisadi or bahujan samaaj party ne 1
 It had secured 25 percent votes
 vahiin jediu ko mahaj 0
 67 percent of the votes were received
 baharhaal, abhi kisi prakaar ke gathbandhan kii koi ghoshnaa nahin ho pai he
 But, the Congress is getting weaker continuously, the absence of Congress in the electoral fray with smaller parties can worsen its situation
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ke grih janapad itawa main unpar jamkar prahaar kiye or aarope lagaaya ki chunavi mausam main yadav bemaani vaadon kii jhadi laga rahe hai

 According to Danish, the minibus belonged to the Justice Department of the neighboring Maidan Varadak province and at the time it was attacked, it was carrying employees
 is hamale ke ek ghante ke bheetar taliban ne is hamale kii jimmedaari le lee
 The Taliban have often targeted government employees in their fight against the government
 america ke ek sheersh commander kaa maananaa he ki bharat, uttar korea ke sankat ko khatm karne main bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 It may help the North Korean leadership explain the seriousness of the threat posed by its nuclear programs
 america prashanth cmand ke commander admiral harry haris kaa kahana he ki iskaa faisla bharat ko karnaa he ki vah kis tarah kii bhoomika nibhaana chahta he
 He said, "I believe that India's voice is strong, so people will pay attention to it

 "let us tell you that North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July

 film kaa naam:mohenjo darodiarector:ashutosh goarikar :star cast:rithik roshan, puja hegade, kabir bedi, arunoday singh, nitish bharadwaj, narendra jha, manish choudhary :reating:1 starrithik roshan or nirdeshak ashutosh goarikar kii jodi super hit film 'jodha akbar' ke baad ek baar phir taiyaar he
 However, Ashutosh's previous film 'khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se' proved to be a flop at the box office and Hrithik's previous film 'bang Bang' could not show any special feat
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki 'mohenjo daaro' main donon milakar phir se koi jaadu chalaa pate he yaa nahin
 Let us know how this film is: Kahani: Kahaani is Grisipiti
 ek ladkaa sampann jo apana gaanv chhod mohanejo daaro janaa chahta he kyonki wo shahar or usase judi baaten uske khwaabon main aati hai
 Finally, after celebrating his Kaka, he reaches the city and meets the heroine there and with the love story, he comes to know that Mohenjo Daro's mahant is his father's murderer
 jo log uske pita ke khilaaf the unase wo badla letaa he or heroin ke saath sabakaa dil jeet letaa he
 Screenplay: The screenplay of the film is extremely weak
 pehla bhaag khatm hi nahin hota
 The first love story of Interval and the revenge after Interval, Na Prem Kahaani has some merit and revenge is also very clichéd
 gaanon ke saath hero kii bahaduree dikhaane ke liemgaramchhake saath ek fiting seen he
 The song and fight are equally kept with one villain's son, one fight with two Adam Khor wrestlers and the last fight with the main villain
 phir ek hero kaa bevakoof comidian dost, heroin ke saath uski ek saheli, main villen kaa ek nalayak jaalim betaa or heroin kaa imaanadaar pujari pita jo aakhir main maaraa jaataa he
 Every spice of the 60s is in 'mohenjo Daro'
 yakeen nahin hota he ki ye ashutosh goarikar kii film he jinhone 'lagaan' banaai thi
 His last film 'khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se' was also a very bad film
 badi film banane ke bajaay ashutosh ek acchhee kahani banane kii koshish karen to unke liye bhi behatar hoga or unke nirmaataa ke liye bhi
 Acting: Hrithik Roshan's move and style is according to today's era
 dialog bolne kaa andaaj shuru main akharata he, phir aadat pad jaati he
 In this film, no one except Hrithik left an impression
 puja hegade pehali film ke hisaab se thik-thaak abhinay karti najar ain
 The rest of Kabir Bedi and Arun Udai Singh keep trying desperately to become terrible by making a mouth out of force
 film main aisa koi bhi kalakaar nahin jo yaad rah jaae
 Weak link: Weak songs, funny costumes, fake art directions, special effects are also known in many places and most importantly, weak story can never assume the appearance of a good screen play

 uttar pradesh sarkaar jald hi rajya ke 2682 madrason kii manyata radd kar sakati he
 These are the madrasas who have not yet given their details on the madrasa portal
 upi sarkaar ne baar-baar isaki samaysima badhaai thi lekin in madrason ne abhi tak ditels nahin di hai
 Significantly, the portal for madrasas was created by the UP government in August, in which it was necessary to provide details for all madrasas
 abhi takaupi sarkaarne do baar ditels dene kii taarikh ko badhaayaa tha
 But out of around 19,000 madrasas, these 2682 have not given details
 sarkaar ab taarikh ko aage nahin badhayegi, jiske kaaran aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki madrason kii manyata radd ho sakati he
 On August 18, the Yogi Adityanath government of the state had issued a web portal and ordered all the madrasas to make their information available on the portal by September 15, members of its management committee, teachers, students, teaching in the madrasa
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar kaa makasad madrason main hone vaali aniyamittaaon ko rokna or shiksha kii gunvattta main sudhaar karnaa he
 There are 19 thousand recognized in the state, about 4,600 partial grants and 560 madrassas with 100 percent grant
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko janata party pramukh subrahmanyam swami se 2 ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale main grih mantri pi chidambaram kii kathith bhoomika kii jaanch kii maang ko lekar unke dwaara sibiai ko likhe gaye sabhi patron ko saunpane ko kaha
 The court said that it would first study those documents and then seek answers from the CBI and the government if needed
 nyaayamurti ji es singhvi or nyaayamurti e ke ganguli kii peeth ne kaha, sibiai ke saath aapane jo bhi patrachaar kiya use darj karaaen
 The bench asked Swamy to file an affidavit within a week with all relevant documents and correspondence with the CBI director seeking investigation into Chidambaram's alleged role
 sarkaar ne haalanki swami kii yachika kaa joardaar khandan karte hue kaha ki agar unke paas koi saboot he to unhen ise sibiai ke samaksh rakhana chahie, jo maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 On behalf of the Center, senior advocate PP Rao said, instead of coming directly to the Supreme Court, they should go to the CBI
 unhone kaha, jo kuch bhi saboot he use agency ke samaksh rakhaa janaa chahie
 Rao asked the bench not to hear such petitions
 unhone kaha, sibiai ne pehle hi maamle kii jaanch kii or kuch bhi nahin paaya he
 My disability is that i am not a CBI
 jab tak mujhe sibiai report nahin milti main kuch bhi nahin kah saktaa
 The CBI has to tell you this
 peeth ne haalanki unki daleelon par aapatti jataate hue kaha, kya hamaare paas aisa koi niyam he ki agar koi aavedan daakhil kiya jaataa he or aarope lagaae jate hai to use hamaare samaksh nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Swamy stated in his plea that the price of 2G spectrum was set by the then Telecom Minister a Raja and the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram and their role should be investigated by the agency
 swami ne kaha, spectrum kii keemat ke maamle main unke :chidambaram: ke shaamil hone ko lekar kaaphi saboot hai
 Raja is behind bars on this issue
 isliye chidambaram ke khilaaf bhi uchit jaanch honi chahie
 Swamy said, he had written to the CBI and lodged a complaint but it seems that the CBI is hesitant to interrogate Chidambaram
 swami ne kaha ki mantriyon ke ucchadhikaar samooh ke 2003 ke faisle ke tahat spectrum kii keemat ke formula ko doorsanchaar vibhaag or vitt mantralay dwaara sanyukt rup se antim rup diya janaa tha
 He said that Chidambaram was the Finance Minister when the spectrum allocation was done
 unhone kaha, spectrum kii keemat ke liye formula tab tak vaid or badhyakaari nahin hoga jab tak ki doorsanchaar vibhaag or vitt mantralay donon main sahmati na bane
 He said that, therefore, it is necessary to interrogate Chidambaram and then evaluate his answer to determine the full investigation and accountability of the charge of flattening the state exchequer by not revising the entry fee
 swami kii daleelon kaa adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan ne samarthan kiya
 He appeared on behalf of the NGO Center for Public Interest Litigation

 The government has decided to re-review the Lohia Path Chakra and Patna Metro Rail Project after the Belly Road subsided by heavy rains in Patna, Bihar's capital
 sarkaar maan rahi he ki 100 saal puraane beli road kaa dhans janaa badi durghatana kaa sanket he
 So before erecting any new structure on that road, it will be thought a thousand times
 sarkaar ne maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh bhi de die hai
 Belly Road, considered the lifeline of Patna, was built during the British
 100 saal se bhi zyada puraani ye sadak kabhi dhansi nahin thi
 But this time the road collapsed in two days of rain
 ye ghatana beli road par bipiessi ke paas hui, jahaan lohia path chakra ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Lohia Path Chakra, built from Lalit Bhawan to the striking turn on Bailey Road, is Nitish Kumar's dream project
 is path chakra se puure ilaake main jam kii samasya khatm hone vaali thi
 But the road collapsed even before Lohia Path Chakra elevated road
 ghatnasthal ko dekhne pahunche nitish kumaar bhi ye najaara dekhakar sakate main aa gaye
 After seeing the condition of Bailey Road, Nitish Kumar has directed to stop all construction work to be done here

 The underground route of Patna Metro has to pass from where Bailey Road is Dhansi
 in donon kaa kaam philhal rokane ko kaha gaya he
 The Chief Minister has said that now experts will be talked about afresh
 export isaki jaanch padtaal karenge phir aage kaa faisla hoga
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who visited the spot, said that in fact, the section of Bailey Road where the incident took place has been the path of the old stream of Son River
 visheshgy bataa chuke hai ki do-teen sau saal pehle usee raste se son nadi baha karti thi
 Later the Son River changed its stream
 iske baad puraani dhara ko samtal kar beli road or mantri-vidhayakon ke karyaalay or awaas bana liye gaye
 Even after boring in that area, sand like the Son River comes out
 yani jameen ke andar baaluu bharaa he
 In such a situation, it can be dangerous to erect some kind of big structure there
 mukhyamantri ne inhen tathyon ko dekhte hue export kii team bulaane ko kaha he
 They will conduct a thorough investigation and only then will the work of Lohia Path Chakra and Patna Metro begin

 If you have purchased a mobile or any other item by shopping online and it is defective or any other goods have been received from the online company, then you can get the right goods or money back by resorting to the law
 iske liye bhartiya sansad ne 1986 main kanjumar protection act banaaya he
 Under this, every consumer has the right to get the goods that he has bought by giving money, in a perfect condition

 iske alaava agar aapane online shopping kii or company kii ore se koi doosraa saamaan mil gaya, to company kii jimmedaari hogi ki wo usko badalakar de
 Suppose if you have purchased a mobile by visiting the online site and the company has filled the stone instead of the mobile and sent it to your address, then the company will have to change and give the mobile again
 agar company aisa nahin karti he, to aap kanjumar forum main shikaayat kar sakate hai
 In the Consumer Protection Act 1986, a three-tier consumer court has been set up to hear such cases
 agar koi maamla 20 lakh rupee tak kii keemat kaa he, to aap jila kanjumar forum main shikaayat kar sakate hai

 One who has bought any goods or services by paying
 agar seva yaa saamaan main koi kami pai jaati he, to wo cese kar saktaa he
 However, if someone buys goods or services to sell, he cannot file a case under this law
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar koi footkar vikreta koi saamaan kisi thok vikreta se kharidta he, to vah is kanoon ke tahat kanjumar nahin mana jayega or wo cese nahin kar saktaa he
 2
 koi company jisane saamaan yaa koi seva kharidi he or vah uskaa upbhog khud yaa uske karmchaaree kar rahe hai, to wo is kanoon ke tahat cese kar sakati he
 3
 kisi kanjumar kaa koi vaaris yaa jisko kanjumar ne saamaan yaa seva gift main diya he, wo khariddaar kii taraf se cese kar saktaa he

 The right to security means the right to get the right goods and services
 agar koi vastu yaa seva kanjumar ke jivan or sampatti ke liye khatarnaak he, to uske khilaaf suraksha paane kaa adhikaar he
 2
 soochna ke adhikaar yani kanjumar ko vastuon or sevaaon kii gunvattta, maatra, shakti, shuddhta, maanak or keemat ke bare main jaankaree paane kaa adhikaar he
 This means that if a shopkeeper or supplier or company does not give you the right information about any item or goods, then you can file a case against it
 3
 The right to choose means that the consumer has the right to choose goods and services
 wo apni pasand kii seva yaa vastu kaa chunaav kar saktaa he
 No consumer shall be compelled to take any special goods or services

 The incident took place in the festive apartment flat of Rohini Sector 18
 jahaan virendra yadav naam ke yuvak kii goli markar hatya kar di gai
 Actually the deceased Virendra Yadav was drinking alcohol late night along with some of his acquaintances, it is feared that during this time Virendra had a quarrel with the people present there and the matter increased so much that people sitting with Virendra were shot dead by him
 Granted

 But in a recent study, it was found that a person's dog is determined by its genetic make-up (genetic)
 yah baat bahut hi ajeeb he, lekin he sach
 According to a study recently released in the journal Scientific Reports, genetic variation describes differences in dog owners

 The author of this study and Professor Tov Fall of the University of Uppsala, Sweden, said that the genetic makeup of humans in the ownership of dogs is surprising
 vahiin britain ke uniwarsity of liverpool ke professor kairi westegarth ne kaha ki insaanon ke genetic mechap kii yah khoj bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 In some studies, the health benefits of dog breeding can be partially explained by the genetic of the people studied
 kute or anya paaltu jaanavar aaj insaanon ke gharelu sadsy se kam nahin hai
 But there is no idea how much effect they have on our lives and health

 Researchers point out that the next step will now be to identify which genetic variants affect people's liking and dislike towards dogs, and how this is associated with personality traits and personality allergies

 'on the other hand, Fakirchand appeared satisfied with the arrangements of the administration, but at the same time he was praying that the same atmosphere should continue
 fakirchand ne kuch kshatriya pariwaron ko bhi nyauta bheja tha
 Some of them attended the reception for the wedding procession and attended the wedding

 muqabla buudhvaar ko bangla tigers se he or wo bhi unke ghar par
 Yet most of the experts seem confident about India's victory
 team diarector ravi shastri ne team ko salaah di he ki 'jeetna ek aadat he' or team india ko asia cap main is lay ko barkaraar rakhana chahie
 Ravi Shastri also says that every match of the Asia Cup in Bangladesh is important for Team India
 wo chaahate hai ki bangladesh main team india sabhi maichon main jeet hasil kare
 India has to play matches with Bangladesh on 24 February, Pakistan on 27 February, Sri Lanka on 1 March and the United Arab Emirates on 3 March
 inamen se kam se kam teen maichon main bharat ko prayog karte hue bhi chaukanna rahane kii jarurat hogi
 Team India is not only the world number one in the ICC rankings, but no team in the current form can make it easy
 bangladesh ke khilaaf bharat ne ab tak do tii-20 match khele hai or He has won both
 pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ne 6 main se 4 match jite hai, ek match taai rahaa jabaki ek match main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Defending champion against Sri Lanka bharat ne 9 main se 5 maichon main jeet hasil kii, jabaki chaar main use munh kii khaani padi
 The account of the T20 match between UAE and India, the number 15 team in the world rankings, is yet to open
 isliye shastri jo team india se ummid rakh rahe hai wo chand hasil karne jaisaa nahin he
 Ravi Shastri advises the team that it should focus on its strengths, avoid overconfidence and lethargy
 australia ko 3-0 se haraane ke baavjood srilanka ke khilaaf (bharattippaniyan Won 2–1) The Indian team lost the first match due to these deficiencies
 world cap se pehle ab isaki gunjaaish nahin he
 Shastri told the team not to care about how the pitches would get there
 8 maheene pehle team india kii vanade main bangladesh ke haathon 1-2 se hui haar ko bhi shastri gujarey hue vakt kii kahani kehete hai or maanate hai ki use lekar fikr karne kii zarurat nahin
 Despite all this, it is clear that Team India will also experiment in Bangladesh so that in the World T20, Team India will chase the title with its best balance
 ravi shastri ye bhi kehete hai team india ke liye bangladesh main asia cap kaa har match ahm he
 They want Team India to win all the matches in Bangladesh
 bharat ko 24 farvari ko bangladesh, 27 farvari ko pakistan, 1 march ko srilanka or 3 march ko sanyukt arab emirate ke saath match khelnaa he
 India will need to be vigilant even when using at least three of these matches
 isisi ranking main team india naa keval world number van he, balki maujuuda form main koi bhi team use aasaan nahin aank sakati
 India has played two T20 matches against Bangladesh so far and donon main use jeet hasil hui he
 India have won 4 out of 6 matches against Pakistan, one match being tie while in one match they lost
 dephending champion srilanka ke khilaaf India won 5 out of 9 matches, while four had to face it
 world ranking main 15wein number kii team sanyukt arab emirate or bharat ke bich tii-20 match kaa khaataa khulanaa baaki he
 So Shastri who is expecting from Team India is not like gaining the moon
 ravi shastri team ko salaah dete hai ki use apni takat par focus karnaa chahie, atiaatmavishvaas or susti se bachanaa chahie
 Despite defeating Australia 3–0 against Sri Lanka (india comments 2-1 se jeeta) bhartiya team inhen kamiyon kii vajah se pehla match haar gai thi
 Now there is no scope before the World Cup
 shastri ne team ko is baat kii bhi parvaah nahin karne ko kaha ki vahaan pichen kisi milengi
 Shastri also tells the story of the time passed by Bangladesh in the ODI team of India 8 months ago and believes that there is no need to worry about it
 baavjood in sabake ye saafe he ki bangladesh main team india prayog bhi karegi taaki world tii 20 main team india apane best balance ke saath kitaab kaa peechha kare

 Janata Dal United's (JDU) national vice-president Prashant Kishor is facing criticism from his party leaders for his outspoken remarks
 vahiin vipakshi argedy (RJD) ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari (shivanand tivary) ne ek bayaan main prashanth kishor ko salaah di he ki ve janata dal united se nikalen
 Shivanand Tiwari wrote in a post shared on Facebook that 'prashant Kishore will not be able to stick with Nitish Kumar
 nitish ji ko main lambey arase se jaanata hum apane ird-gird kisi bhi swabhimani or swatantra vichaar rakhane vaale vyakti ko ve sahan nahin kar sakate hai
 'shivanand has said that' i have heard and read Prashant
 har masale par unki apni suchintit raay he
 It is not necessary that his every opinion matches Nitish's opinion
 lekin prashanth apni baat bahut bebaaki se rakhte hai, jhanjhat yaheen he
 You cannot live with him by keeping a different opinion from Nitish ji
 agar rakhte hai to use prakat nahin kar sakate hai
 If Prashant moves away from Nitish ji then it is not going to harm him
 prashanth kaa naam or shoharat dur tak fail chuki he
 So they will be welcome anywhere
 'tiwari ne kaha he ki 'meraa unase ek hi anurodh hoga
 That is also because at the level of karma they have been very closely associated with elections
 isliye desh main chunaavon ke jariye hi sarkarein bane, iske prati unki nishtha jarur hogi
 People they are with today do not believe in democracy
 unka bas chale to aaj ve loktantr ko desh se mitaa den
 By creating an atmosphere of frenzy, they want to gain power by diverting the attention of people from problems of livelihood, bread, employment, farming etc
 'shivanand tiwari ne kaha he ki 'deshbhakti ke naam par unmaad kaa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he
 Any kind of question is being called treason
 isliye prashanth ji se meraa anurodh hoga ki inako chhodie
 Join any party fighting them and shoulder your noble and holy campaign to save democracy
