 a combination of art, science and technology of rational, intelligent construction of all types of places to satisfy human needs according to the time, technology and interest of buildings, design and design of buildings comes in the definition of architecture
 iskaa or bhi spashtakin kiya ja saktaa he
 Architecture has been and is a branch of fine arts, with the aim of taking the support of industrialization and constructing a good building in terms of utility, whose environment is highly cherished, cherished and cherished and cherished for the cultured and artistic interest
 prakruti, buddhi evam ruchi dwaara nirdhaarit or niyamit katipay siddhanton or anupaaton ke anusaar rachana karnaa is kala kaa sambhddha ang he
 Such a configuration of maps and objects and enriching the structure in the most appropriate way, which creates a lot of interestingness, beauty, greatness, unity and power with maximum features
 praarambhik avasthaaon main, athwa swalpasiddhi ke saath, vaastukala kaa sthaan maanav ke simit prayojanon ke liye aavashyak peshon, yaa vyavsaayon main-praaia: manushya ke liye kisi prakaar kaa rakshasthaan pradaan karne ke liye hota he
 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 Let's demonstrate this with Φ

 The year 2929 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 In 1562, he made an agreement with the ruler of Amer - thus Rajput kings also turned towards him
 isi prakaar usne iran se aane waalon ko bhi badi sahaayta di
 He turned Indian Muslims towards him with his efficient behavior
 dharmik sahishnutaa kaa usne anokhaa parichay diya - hindu tirth sthanon par laga kar jazia hataa liya gaya 
 This made the entire people feel that they are capable of adopting a changed policy
 iske atirikt usne jabardasti yudhbandiyo kaa dharm badalawaanaa bhi band karvaa diya
 Akbar introduced copper, silver and gold currencies during his reign
 in mudraon ke prishth bhaag main sundar islamic chapai hua karti thi
 Akbar made many changes in the postures of his era
 usne ek khuli taksaal vyavastha kii shuruyaat kii jiske andar koi bhi vyakti agar taksaal shulk dene me sakasham tha to vah kisi duusari mudra athwa sone se akbar kii mudra ko parivartit kar saktaa tha
 Akbar wanted the same currency to prevail throughout his empire
 panipat kaa dwitiya yuddh hone ke baad hemu ko markar dilli par akbar ne punah adhikaar kiya
 He then began to expand his kingdom and annexed Malwa in 1562, Gujarat in 1572, Bengal in 1574, Kabul in 1581, Kashmir in 1586 and Khandesh in 1601 under the Mughal Empire
 akbar ne in rajyon main prashasan sanbhaalane hetu ek-ek rajyapal niyukt kiya
 He took Delhi away from many places to take over the rule and it seemed that this could cause problems in administration, so he decided that the Mughal capital should be moved to Fatehpur Sikri near Agra which was almost in the middle of the empire
 ek puraane based gram sikri par akbar ne nayaa shahar banwaaya jise apni jeet yani fatah kii khushi main fatehabad yaa fatehpur naam diya gaya
 Soon it came to be called by its full current name Fatehpur Sikri
 yahaan ke adhikansh nirmaan un 14 varshon ke hi hai, jinamein akbar ne yahaan nivas kiya
 Royal gardens, rest houses, accommodation for the feudal and courtiers and madrasas for children were built in the city
 blair or bloom ke anusaar shahar ke andar imaaraten do pramukh prakaar kii hai- seva imaaraten, jaise kaarvanseri, taksaal, nirmaaniyan, bada bazaar jahaan dakshin-pashchim / uttar purv aksh ke lambavat nirmaan hue hai or doosraa shahi bhaag, jisamen bharat kii sabase badi samuhik masjid he, saath hi awasaiya tathaa prashaskeey imaarte hai jise daulatakhaana kehete hai
 They are situated at some angle from the hill and form an angle with the Qibla
 kintu ye nirnay sahi siddh nahin hua or kuch hi samay ke baad akbar ko rajdhani fatehpur sikri se hataani padi
 Lack of water was the main reason behind this
 fatehpur sikri ke baad akbar ne ek chalit darbar kii rachana kii jo puure samrajya main ghumta rahata tha or is prakaar samrajya ke sabhi sthanon par uchit dhyaan dena sambhav hua
 He later made Lahore the capital for the northwestern part in 1585
 mrityu ke purv akbar ne san 1599 main rajdhani waapas agra banaayi or ant tak yaheen se shashan sambhala
 The city of Agra was renamed Akbarabad which became the largest city in the empire
 shahar kaa mukhya bhaag yamuna nadi ke pashchimi tat par basaa tha
 a good system of drainage of rain water was made here
 lodhi samrajya dwaara banavaayi gai gaare-mitti se bani nagar kii puraani chaharadivari ko todakar 1565 main nayi balua pathar kii diwaar banavaayi gai
 According to the British historians Duet Blair and Bloom, it was because of this red wall that it got its name Red Fort
 ve aage likhte hai ki yah kila pichley kile ke nakshe par hi kuch ardhavritakar bana tha
 It is surrounded by a double security wall from the city, outside which a deep moat is built
 is dohari diwaar main uttar main dilli get va dakshin main amar singh dwaar bane hai
 Both these gates are known by their ornamentation by their arched arch-shaped niches and bastions, and blue glazed tiles on the red and white marble
 vartmaan kila akbar ke pautra shahjahan dwaara banwaaya hua he
 It has Jahangiri Mahal and Akbar Mahal on its southern side
 amber ke kushwaha rajput raaj bhaarmal ne akbar ke darbar main apane rajya sanbhaalane ke kuch samay baad hi pravesh paaya tha
 He accepted to marry his princess Harkha Bai to Akbar
 jodhabai shehzade Salim ke janm ke pashchaat mariyam-uz-jamaani kahalaayi
 He died in 1623
 uske putr jahangir dwaara uske sammaan main lahore main ek masjid banavaayi gai thi
 Bharamal was elevated to the court of Akbar and after that his sons Bhagwant Das and grandson Mansingh also remained elevated feudatories of the court
 hindu rajkumariyon ko muslim raajaaon se vivaah main sambandh banane ke prakaran akbar ke samay se purv kaaphi hue the, kintu adhikansh vivaahon ke baad donon pariwaron ke aapasi sambandh achche nahin rahe or na hi rajkumariyaan kabhi waapas laut kar ghar aayin
 Akbar, however, distinguished the case from previous episodes, where brothers or fathers of those queens enjoyed the same respect as daughters or sisters after Akbar's Muslim in-laws, except for eating and praying with them
 un rajputon ko akbar ke darbar main achche sthaan mili the
 All were adopted by him except a few conservative families who saw it as an insult
 anya rajpur rajavaadon ne bhi akbar ke sang vaivaahik sambandh banaaye the, kintu vivaah sambandh banane kii koi shart nahin thi
 The two major Rajput dynasties, the Shishodia of Mewar and the Hodha dynasty of Ranthambhore, always shied away from these relations
 akbar ke ek prasiddh darbari raja maansingh ne akbar kii ore se ek hadha raja surjan hadha ke paas ek sambandh prastaav bhi lekar gayi, jise surjan singh ne is shart par sweekaarya kiya ki ve apni kisi putree kaa vivaah akbar ke sang nahin karenge
 Ultimately, no marital relations took place, but Surjan was honored by handing over the bastion of garh-katang
 anya kai rajput saamanton ko bhi apane raajaaon kaa putriyon ko mughalon ko vivaah ke naam par dena acha nahin lagata tha
 Rathore Kalyanadas of Garh Siwan also threatened to kill Mota Raja Rao Uday Singh and Jahangir, as Uday Singh decided to marry his daughter Jodha Bai to Akbar's son Jahangir
 akbar ne ye gyaan hone par shahi phujon ko kalyandas par akraman hetu bhej diya
 Kalyanadasa worked in the war with that army and his women committed jauhar
 in sambandhon kaa raajnneetik prabhaav mahatvapurn tha
 Although some Rajput women accepted Islam upon Akbar's entry into the harem, they had full religious freedom, as well as their relatives who were Hindus; High-places were also found in the court
 inke dwaara jansadharan kii dhwani akbar ke darbar tak pahunchaa karti thi
 Due to increased interaction between the Hindu and Muslim courtiers of the court, exchange of ideas and possible progress in both religions
 isse agali peedi main donon rakton kaa sangam tha jisane donon sampradaayon ke bich sauhaard ko bhi badhaava diya
 As a result, the Rajputs became the most powerful assistants of the Mughals, the Rajput generals stayed in the Mughal army and won many wars
 inamen gujarat kaa 1572 kaa abhiyaan bhi tha
 Akbar's policy of religious tolerance opened up jobs and employment opportunities for all in the royal administration
 iske kaaran prashasan or bhi drudh hota chalaa gaya
 In the erstwhile society, prostitution was patronized by the emperor
 uski ek bahut badi haram thi jisame bahut si striyaan thim
 Most of the women were abducted and kept there
 us samay main sati pratha bhi joro par thi
 Then it is said that some of the people of Akbar, who saw the beautiful woman being Sati, would forcefully stop being Sati and tell the Emperor's orders and put the woman in the harem
 haalanki is prakaran ko darbari itihaaskaaron ne kuch is dhang se kaha he ki is prakaar badshaah salaamat ne sati pratha kaa virodh kiya va un ablaa striyon ko sangrakshan diya
 In his biography, Akbar himself has written - If i had got this intelligence already, i would not kidnap any women of my sultanate in my harem
 is baat se yah to spasht hi ho jaataa he ki vah sundariyon kaa apharan karwaata tha
 Apart from this, the futility of the matter of not kidnapping is also known from the fact that the harem was closed neither in Akbar's time nor in his time
 aaine akabari ke anusaar abdul kaadir badayunni kehete hai ki begmein, kuleen, darbario kii patniyaan athwa anya striyaan jab kabhi badshaah kii seva main pesh hone kii ichha karti hai to unhen pehle apane ichha kii soochna dekar uttar kii pratiksha kerani padati he; jinhen yadi yogya samajha jaataa he to haram main pravesh kii anumati di jaati he
 Akbar used to force his subjects to collectively organize naked performances of the women of his house, which Akbar named Khudroz
 is utsav ke peeche akbar kaa ekmaatr udeshy sundariyon ko apane haram ke liye chunanaa tha
 
 gondvanaa kii rani durgavati par bhi akbar kii kudrushti thi
 He invaded his kingdom to obtain the queen
 yuddh ke dauraan virangana ne anubhav kiya ki use maarane kii nahin varan bandi banane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he, to usne vahiin aatmahatya kar lee
 Akbar then forced his sister and son-in-law into his harem
 akbar ne yah pratha bhi chalaai thi ki uske parajeet shatru apane parivaar evam paricharika varg main se chuni hui mahilayen uske haram main bheje
 At the time of Akbar's accession in 1556, the Portuguese had built a number of fortifications and constructions on the west coast of the continent and largely controlled shipping and maritime trade in that region
 is upniveshwaad ke chalate anya sabhi vyapaaree sansthaaon ko portugaliyon kii sharton ke adheen hi rahanaa padhata tha, jis par us samay ke shaskaon va vyapaariyon ko aapatti hone lageen thim
 The Mughal Empire made Gujarat the first target after Akbar's coronation and won the first victory on the sea coast in 1572, but keeping in view the power of the Portuguese, for the first few years he only took a pass called Kartaz to travel in the Persian Gulf region
 Kept going 1572 main surat ke adhigrahan ke samay mughalon or portugaliyon kii pratham bhent hui or portugaliyon ko mughalon kii asli shakti kaa anumaan hua or faltah unhone yuddh ke bajaay niti se kaam lenaa uchit samajha va portugali rajyapal ne akbar ke nirdesh par use ek rajdoot ke dwaara sandhi prastaav bheja
 Akbar accepted the proposal of his harem and other Muslim people from that area with a view to securing Hajj's visit to Mecca
 1573 main akbar ne apane gujarat ke prashasnic adhikariyon ko ek farmaan jari kiya, jisamen nikatavartti daman main portugaliyon ko shanti se rahane diye jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 In return, the Portuguese issued passes for the family of Akbar to go to Haj
 1576 main main akbar ne yahya saleh ke netritv main apane haram ke anek sadasyon sahit hajiyon kaa ek bada jattha haj ko bheja
 The batch arrived in two ships from Surat at Jeddah port in 1577 and proceeded to Mecca and Medina
 1577 se 1580 ke bich chaar or kaaravaan haj ko ravaanaa hua, jinke saath makka va madina ke logon ke liye bhenten va garibon ke liye sadake the
 These travelers belonged to the economically lower class of society and their departure increased the economic burden on those cities
 tab turk prashasan ne inase ghar laut jane kaa nivedan kiya, jis par haram kii striyaan taiyaar na huin
 After much controversy, he was forced to read his return
 adan ke rajyapal ko 1580 main aaye yatriyon kii badi sankhya dekhakar badha rosh hua or usne lautate hue mughalon kaa yathasambhav apmaan bhi kiya
 Due to these cases, Akbar had to stop the visits of the Hajis
 1584 ke baad akbar ne yaman ke samrajya ke adhinsth adan ke bandargah par portugaliyon kii madad se chadhaai karne kii yojana banaayi
 a Mughal envoy was permanently stationed in Goa from October 1584 to form a plan in this regard from the Portuguese
 1587 main ek portugali tukdi ne yaman par akraman bhi kiya kintu turk nausena dwaara haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this, the mughal-portuguese alliance also got a shock as the Portuguese were being continuously pressurized in Janjira by the Mughal Jagirdars
 akbar ek musalmaan tha, par duusare dharm evam sampradaayon ke liye bhi uske man main aadar tha
 As the age of Akbar changed, so did his interest in religion
 use visheshkar hindu dharm ke prati apane lagaav ke liye janaa jaataa hai
 He married many Hindu princesses, unlike his ancestors
 iske alaava akbar ne apane rajya main hinduo ko vibhinn rajasi padon par bhi asin kiya jo ki kisi bhi bhootpurv muslim shaasha ne nahi kiya tha
 He had come to know that in order to rule India for a long time, he should give proper and equal place to the original inhabitants here
 hinduon par lage jazia 1562 main akbar ne hataa diya, kintu 1575 main muslim netaaon ke virodh ke kaaran waapas lagaana padaa, haalanki usne baad main nitipurvak waapas hataa liya
 Jiziya tax was imposed on poor Hindus to take refuge in Islam after being forced out of poverty
 yah muslim logon par nahin lagaaya jaataa tha
 Due to this tax, many poor Hindu population was burdened, due to which they used to convert to Islam
 firoz shah tughlaq ne bataaya he, ki kaise jazia dwaara islam kaa prasar hua tha
 Akbar's occasional decision to lift the tax on Jaziya and Hindu pilgrimage had little effect on the Hindus, as it did not benefit them much, as they were withdrawn after some interval
 akbar ne bahut se hinduon ko unki ichha ke viruddh bhi islam grahan karavaaya tha iske alaava usne bahut se hindu tirth sthanon ke naam bhi islamic kiye, jaise 1583 main prayag ko elahabaad kiya gaya
 It was during the reign of Akbar that one of his warriors, Hussain Khan Tukriya, forced the Hindus to force discriminatory spectators on their shoulders and arms
 jwalamukhi mandir ke sambandh main ek katha kaaphi prachlit he
 It would be between 1542 and 1605 only when Akbar was the king of Delhi
 dhyanubhakt mata jotavaali kaa param bhakt tha
 Once he went out to Jwalaji along with his villagers to see the goddess
 jab uskaa kafila dilli se gujara to mughal badshaah akbar ke sipaahiyon ne use roak liya or raja akbar ke darbar main pesh kiya
 When Akbar asked Dhyanu where he was going with his villagers, Dhyanu replied that he was going to visit Jotwali
 akbar ne kaha teri maa main kya shakti he ? or vah kya-kya kar sakati he ? tab dhyanu ne kaha vah to puure sansar kii raksha karne vaali hai
 There is nothing that she cannot do
 akbar ne dhyanu ke ghode kaa sar katwa diya or kaha ki agar teri maa main shakti he to ghode ke sar ko jodakar use jivit kar den
 Hearing this word, Dhyanu started praising Goddess and cut off her head and offered it to Mata as a gift
 mata kii shakti se ghode kaa sar jud gaya
 Thus Akbar realized the power of the goddess
 badshaah akbar ne devi ke mandir main sone kaa chhatra bhi chadhaaya
 But he was proud in his mind that he brought the umbrella of gold, then the mother dropped the umbrella from his hand and made it of a strange metal which is a mystery till date
 yah chhatra aaj bhi mandir main maujuud he
 Historian Dasharatha Sharma says that we call Akbar great according to the history and narratives of his court such as Akbarnama, etc
 yadi koi anya ullekhneey kaaryon kii ore dekhe, jaise dalpat vilaas, tab spasht ho jayega ki akbar apane hindu saamanton se kitna abhadra vyavhaar kiya karata tha
 Hindus boycotted the temple because of Akbar's Navratna king Mansingh's construction of Vishwanath Temple after Akbar's permission
 kaaran saaf tha, ki raja maansingh ke parivaar ke akbar se vaivaahik sambandh the
 The Hindu feudatories of Akbar could not get the temple built without his permission
 bengal main raja maansingh ne ek mandir kaa nirmaan bina anumati ke aarambh kiya, to akbar ne pataa chalane par use rukvaa diya or 1595 main use masjid main badalane ke aadesh die
 The extent of outrage for Akbar is revealed by an incident
 hindu kisaanon ke ek netaa raja ram ne akbar ke makbare, sikandra, agra ko luutane kaa prayaas kiya, jise sthaneey faujadaar, mir abul fazal ne asafal kar diya
 Shortly thereafter, Raja Ram reappeared at Sikandra in 1688 and taking advantage of the delay in the arrival of Shaista Khan, he made a dent in the tomb and looted many valuable things, such as gold, silver, precious carpets, lamps, etc
 And those who could not take them were ruined
 raja ram or uske aadamiyon ne akbar kii asthiyon ko khod kar nikaal liya evam jala kar bhasma kar diya, jo ki muslimon ke liye ghor apmaan kaa vishay tha
 In later years, Akbar was also attracted towards other religions
 akbar kaa hindu dharm ke prati lagaav keval mogul samrajya ko thos banane ke hi liye nahi tha varan uski hindu dharm main vyaktigat ruchi thi
 Apart from Hinduism, Akbar was also interested in Shia Islam and Christianity
 isai dharm ke moolbhoot siddhant jaanane ke liye usne ek baar ek portugali isai dharm prachaarak ko goa se bula bheja tha
 Akbar had built a special place in the court called ibadat-khana, where he used to have religious discussions with various religious leaders and preachers
 uskaa yah duusare dharmon kaa anveshan kuch muslim kattarpanthi logon ke liye asahneeya tha
 He began to feel that Akbar was deviating from his religion
 in baton main kuch sachai bhi thi, akbar ne kai baar rudhivaadee islam se hat kar bhi kuch faisle liye, yahan tak ki 1582 main usne ek naye sampradaay kii hi shuruyaat kar di jise deen-e-ilaahi yani ishwar kaa dharm kaha gaya
 Akbar created a new religion called din-i-ilahi in 1582, in which the core elements of all religions were inserted, mainly Hindu and Islam religions
 inke alaava parsi, jain evam isai dharm ke mul vichaaron ko bhi sammilit kiya
 However, he did not do much industry for the promotion of this religion, but only included his trusted people in it
 kaha jaataa hai ki akbar ke alaava keval raja birbal hi mrityu tak is ke anuyaayi the
 According to dabestan-e-mazhab, only 19 people adopted this religion after Akbar
 kalantar main akbar ne ek nae panchang kii rachana kii jisame ki usne ek ishwariya samvath ko armbh kiya jo uske hi rajbhishek ke din se prarambh hota tha
 He wrote "allah-o-akbar" on the back of the coins which was the word Anakarthi
 akbar kaa shabdic arth he "mahaan" or ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ shabd ke do arth ho sakate the "allaah mahaan hai " yaa "akbar hi allaah hai"
 din-e-ilahi was, in true sense, a religion rather than a code of conduct
 isame bhoga, ghamand, ninda karnaa yaa dosha lagaana varjit the evam inhe paap kaha gaya
 Kindness, thoughtfulness and moderation were its pillars
 yah tark diya gaya he ki deen-e-ilaihi kaa ek nayaa dharm hone kaa siddhant galat dharna he, jo ki baad main british itihaaskaaron dwaara abul fazal ke kaaryon ke galat anuwaad ke kaaran paidaa hua tha
 However, it is also accepted that the policy of sulah-i-kul, which had the essence of din-i-ilahi, was adopted by Akbar not just for religious purposes but as a part of the general imperial administrative policy
 isane akbar kii dharmik sahanubhuti kii niti kaa aadhaar banaaya
 At the time of Akbar's death in 1605 there was no sign of dissatisfaction among his Muslim subjects, and a theologian like Abdul Haq had the impression that close relations remained
 nirakshar hote hui bhi akbar ko kalakaaron evam buddhijivio se vishesh prem tha
 Due to this love of his, there were nine very quality courtiers in Akbar's court which is also known as Akbar's Navratna
 akbar kaa vyaktitv bahucharchit rahaa he
 Therefore, Indian literature and cinema have created many characters inspired by Akbar
 kopgahen vishvavidhyalay denmark kii shodhasanthaan he
 It is the oldest and second largest university in Denmark
 isaki sthapana 1479 main ek samanya adhyayan kshetra ke rup main hui
 It is the second oldest university in Scandinavia which was founded after Uppsala University

 Two small hemispheres of the cerebellum appear connected towards the back of their back
 iske aage kii ore vah bhaag he, jisko madhyamastishk yaa madhyamasturlug kehete hai
 Going down from it is called Merushirsha, or Medula Oblangeta
 pramastishk or anumastishk jhilliyon se dhake hue hai, jinako tanikaaye kehete hai
 These three are: tenacious, lattice and lactuous

 The characteristics of the human brain is that both of its Golarghas are much larger than other parts
 donon golardh kapaal main dahini or bain ore saamne lalaat se lekar peeche kapaal ke ant tak faile hue hai
 Other parts are hidden from them
 golardho ke bich main ek gahari khai he, jiske tal main ek chaudee feete ke samaan mahasanyojak naamak rachana se donon golardh jure hue hai
 The color of the hemispheres appears gray from above
 golardho ke bahya prishth main kitne hi gahare vidar bane hue hai, jahaan mastishk ke bahya prishth kii vastu uske bheetar ghus jaati he
 It seems as if the bottom of an object on the page has been stretched and folded, causing folds
 is kaaran mastishk ke prishth par anek badi choti khaaiyaan ban jaati hai, jo parikha kehalaati hai
 The folded chakrasanavathaddha portion of the gray brain page between the sakhas is called Karnak, because they are as bent as the Karnasakshli
 bady or gahari khaio vidar kehalaati he or mastishk ke vishisht kshetron ko pruthak karti he
 Large parts of the front, lateral and back of the brain are called khand and khandika according to their position
 golardh ke saamne kaa khand lalatkhand he, jo lalatasthi se dhankaa rahata he
 Similarly, there are parietal block and occipital block and conch block
 in sab par parishakhaayen or karnak bane hue hai
 There are also many special fissures
 chitra 2
 or 3 main inke naam or sthaan dikhaae gaye hai
 Some specific schools and sakhas are discussed here
 parshivak khand par madhyaparikha, jo rollado kaa vidar bhi kehalaati he, upar se neeche or aage ko jaati he
 On the front side of it is the conducting part of the cerebrum, whose action causes the muscles to contract
 yadi vahaan kisi sthaan par vidyutdutejnaa di jaati he to jin peshiyon ko vahaan kii koshikaon se sutara jate hai unka sankoch hone lagata he
 If cells are destroyed or indolent by any tumor, inflammatory pressure, etc
, the muscles do not hesitate

 Here the signs of hearing originate
 yahan kii koshikaaye shabd ke rup ko samajhati hai
 On the inner surface of the conch shell is the hippocampi Karnak, where there is knowledge of smell
 swaad kaa kshetra bhi isse sambandhit he
 Parts and powers of smell and taste are much more developed in some animals than in humans
 yaheen par rolando ke vidar ke peeche sparshagyan praapt karanevaala bahut sa bhaag he
 Frontal block is increased in humans than all other animals, the advance of which has developed special
 yah bhaag samast prerak or aavegkendron se sanyojaksutron dwaara sambhddha he, visheshkar sanchaalak kshetra ke sameep sthit un kendron se, jinka netra kii gati se sambandh he
 Therefore, it is believed that this part regulates subtle skills, which depend on the impulses reached in the eye and which require memory and perception
 manushya ke bolne, likhane, haath kii anguliyon se kala kii vastuen taiyaar karne aadi main jo sookshm kriyaayein hoti hai, unka niyantran yaheen se hota he
 The cerebrum is considered a place of high emotions

 Lateral ventricles - If the hemispheres are cut in a transverse direction, then an empty space or cavity will be found inside it
 donon golardho main yah guha he, jisko nilay kaha jaataa he
 These extend from the frontal part of the hemisphere to the posterior extremity
 inke bheetar mastishk par ek ati sookshm kala aachhadit he, jo antareey kehalaati he
 The endoplasmic reticulum is located in both ventricles

 Cerebral cortex - The thick layer of gray colored material on the surface of cerebral cortex is called cortex
 iske neeche shwet rang kaa antasth bhaag he
 There are also gray islands and many small islands
 inako cendrak kaha jaataa he
 The cortex level is composed exclusively of nerve cells, although it also contains formulas derived from cells and connective tissue called neuromlia, but at this stage the cells predominate
 swayan praantastha main kai str haate hai
 There are two types of formulas in the level of sutras: one which are interlinked different centers; There are those sessions that go out of the cells there and go down into the inner compartment and reach the degree of hawker collected in the pyramidal path there

 Benedetto Croche, the originator of expressionism, is basically an autistic philosopher
 unka uddeshy sahitya main aatma kii antah satta sthapit karnaa tha
 Prior to this, Kant neglected the visual world, rendering the identity and coordination of the mind and the external world, and Hegel also gave importance to the visual world by accepting the recognition of Kant
 iske vipareet kroche ne keval maansik prakriya ko hi mahatva diya he
 In his view, external devices are only secondary instruments
 kroche kaa abhivyanjanawad kala ke mul tatva kii khoj kaa prayaas he
 What is the real element of art or what is its soul? In this subject Croche has given his serious discussion, which is also subtle
 kroche ke samast soundarya-vivechan main aatm-tatva pratishthit he
 This self-essence is the artist's consciousness
 is aatm-tatva ko kroche ne aantarik abhivyakti kaha he, jo is jagat main mukhya rup se do prakaar kii pratikriya karata he
 According to Croche, there are two distinctions between mental or knowledge actions - theoretical or mental and practical
 inhen ko kroche ne kramshah sansaarik gyaan bodh or sansaarik kriyaayein kaha he
 The mental power of the artist or his worldly perception is expressed in two ways
 ek prakaar sahaj bodh kaa he, jo bhavatmak he
 There is no resort to logic in this, but there is an attempt to mark the smooth movement of the heart
 ise kroche ne sahjanubhuti yaa antavpragyatmak kaha he
 Art is born from this spontaneity
 maansik bodh kaa doosraa prakaar buddhi pradhan he
 In this, one understands the mysteries of the world by thinking or reasoning and makes his own belief about them
 ise kroche ne tarkgyan kaha he
 There are also two types of practical action - one is economic and the other is moral
 aarthik kaa arth he upyogita tathaa naitik kaa arth he jivan or jagat ke vyavhaaron kaa saamaajik drushti se moolyankan
 Among them, spontaneous action is the main one
 vahi kroche ke kala-vivechan kaa aadhaar prastut karti he
 These four trades are as follows- sahaj-gyaan yaa antavpragna or abhivyanjana kaa abhinn sambandh he
 Where there is spontaneous knowledge, there must be expression
 sahaj-gyaan abhivyanjana ke bina yaa abhivyanjana sahaj-gyaan ke bina sambhav nahin he
 Kroche has used the term 'expressionism' in a broader sense, which is a sign of all means of line, tone, song, etc
, along with a sense of literal expression
 jise chitra, sangeet, nrity aadi ko kisi bhi rup main abhivyanjana hoti he
 One who cannot take the form of intuitive expression is not really true genius, he remains only natural fact and sensation
 udaahranarth, jab koi chitrakaar kisi vastu kii jhalak maatr dekhtaa he to ham yah nahin kah sakate ki use sahaj-gyaan hua he
 We will consider the achievement of spontaneous knowledge only when he can articulate it, ie when he can express it fully in his inner self
 is prakaar kroche sahjanubhuti ko aantarik abhivyanjana yaa aantarik rup-rachana maanata he, jo soundarya-tatva ko janm detii he
 He considers it a manifestation of the soul
 isi karm ke dwaara kalakaar bhaawanaaon tathaa sanvegon ke aaveg ko niyantran main rakhata he or prabhaavon ko bimbon main abhivyakt kar swayan unase mukt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, croche considers spontaneity as an expression
 yah abhivyanjana aantarik hoti he, bahya nahin
 Explaining aesthetics, Croche has established four categories of artistic works - kintu duusari shrenee main aane vaali aantarik abhivyakti hi sachhee abhivyanjana he, kyonki kroche isi ko sarvaadhik mahatva pradaan karata he
 The poet of Croche does not speak any language, but he enjoys the mind, which remains idolized
 lekin jab tak bahya abhivyakti nahin hoti tab tak sansar main kavita kaa janm nahin hota
 By the way, in general language, expression is only by expressive words
 kala main shabdon ke atirikt abhivyanjana ke anya madhyam bhi hote hai; jaise- rang, pathar aadi
 But the principle of expression is the belief that without external publication or communication, the entire process of expression is completed
 kroche ke saundarya-darshan main kendriya tatva he sahaj-gyaan
 He refuted the earlier belief that intuitive knowledge is not possible without intelligence
 sach to yah he ki bauddhik tatva bhi sahaj-gyaan main ghul-milakar usee kaa rup grahan kar lete hai
 Similarly, there is a difference between intuitive knowledge and direct knowledge
 pratyaksh-gyaan kaa sambandh vaastavik-avastavik tathaa desh-kaal main rahata he, jabaki sahaj-gyaan inkaa bhed nahin karata
 The boundary of intuitive knowledge is not only obvious to the objects but also beyond the direction and periphery of time
 sahaj-gyaan or samvednaa main bhi spasht antar he, kyonki samvednaayen samuchit bimb arthath rup kii sristi nahin kar paatin, vah sahaj-gyaan nahin samajhi ja saktin
 Intuition is the active expression of influences, while sensation is mechanical, passive
 atah sahjanubhuti hi abhivyanjana he
 Scott James states that "according to Croche's philosophy, art is nothing but an expression of innate perception or human influences
" ’’ is prakaar sahaj gyaan anya maansik vyapaaron se bhinn he
 Art is related to intuitive feeling
 jis samay sahjanubhuti jaagrit hokar abhivyanjit hone lagati he tabhi kala janm leti he
 According to Croche this process is sufficient for the expression of art
 saamanytah jab ham kala kii charchaa karte hai to hamaara abhipraay likhit kritiyon athwa rachanaaon se hota he
 But when Croche talks about art, it means internal expression, which is not external expression
 jab sahjanubhuti sfurit hoti he to vah abhivyanjana ke dwaara kala main parinat ho jaati he
 This whole process is internal, that is, the creation and accomplishment of art happens within the artist, not outside, because- atah kala kii sristi hi nahin, uski satta bhi baahar nahin he
 According to Croche, art is internal as well as unbroken, because inner wisdom or innate perception is unbroken
 jab sahjanubhuti akhand hogi to uski abhivyanjana bhi akhand hogi, tab swabhaavatah kala bhi akhand hogi
 In fact, the meaning of croche is that any poem, picture or idol in its full, unbroken, undivided form thrives in the mind of the poet and it is in that memory that it takes expression or artistic form
 baad main kavi us antakasthit rup ko kaagaj par keval lekhnibaddh karata he
 Therefore, the wider and more subtle and rich the artist whose sensation and sensation is, the more excellent, captivating and influential his art is
 atah kroche ke anusaar- The question arises, what is the place of artistic external publication and communication in expressionism? Crouche considers external publication pictures, poetry, idols etc
 as 'aids to remind' or 'stimulants'
 iske dwaara kalakaar phir se us sahaj-gyaan ko yaa us kshan kii anubhuti ko lautaa laata he jab uske man main us soundarya kaa pradurbhaav hua tha
 Hence external expression is for practical use only
 yahi kaaran he ki kala ke saamaajik upyog evam sahruday samvedh hone ke liye bahya prakaashan kaa aashray lenaa padataa he
 But the entire process of external revelation relates closer to will power than knowledge
 dusron ke anand ke liye, naitik parivaar ke liye, aalochak ke man main punrariti ke liye abhivyanjana kaa bahya nirupan ke rup me hona use gaun bana detaa he
 In expressiveism, the practical utility of external publication is considered, but it has no place in the original form of art
 abhivyanjana gyaan-rup he or bahya prakaashak karm-rup
 Karma is impossible without knowledge, but the existence of knowledge does not depend on karma
 vah apane main hi paripurna he
 In conclusion - kroche ne soundarya jaise vivaadaaspad vishay ko bhi saral dhang se samajhaate hue kaha he- ‘‘safal abhivyakti kaa hi doosraa naam soundarya he athwa ‘‘safal’’ visheshan bhi anaavashyak he, keval abhivyanjana ko hi soundarya ke naam se jaananaa chahie, kyonki jo abhivyanjana safal nahin hoti use abhivyanjana kii sangya nahin di ja sakati
 '' kroche kii manyata he ki kala antar kii bhaavana yaa sahaj-gyaan he or kalatmak vastu kaa astitv uske abhivyanjit hone main he
 We consider a poem or a beautiful landscape to be beautiful when our feelings are expressed in it and we express our feelings in those things
 kalakaar apni kalakriti dwaara apni bhaawanaaon ko abhivyanjit karata he
 The one who enjoys it can be the one in whom that feeling exists
 kroche ke anusaar kisi kalakaar ke kavy athwa shilp main hi soundarya kii yatharth abhivyakti hoti he
 There is no beauty in nature, nor is there external power of beauty
 vastutah soundarya-bodh hi sundar hota he
 Therefore, to call an external object beautiful should be considered a symbolic use of the word 'beautiful'
 kroche ke matanusaar soundarya sahaj-gyaan kii abhivyakti he
 Since instincts and expressions are impulsive, it can also be said that beauty is intuitive or beauty is expression
 is prakaar kroche soundarya ko sahaj gyaan yaa antar kaa dharm maanata he
 Therefore, he is hesitant to accept his external expression
 kroche kaa mat he ki prayek vyakti main kalakaar kaa ansh avashya rahata he
 It means that every person has sensing power, he has the ability to feel comfortable and express
 saadhaaran vyakti kii apeksha kalakaar main yah sahjanubhuti prakhar hoti he
 According to this view, the critic does not study and evaluate the artwork rationally, but his study takes shelter of his feeling or feeling
 vah kalakriti main nihit antardrushti yaa sahjanubhuti ko hridyangam karata he
 Thus the critic is also proved to be artist
 kalakriti par nirnay dene ke kshan main aalochak apni anubhuti dwaara kavi kii aatma se ekikaran sthapit kar letaa he
 Dr
 Savitri Sinha's view in this context is remarkable and worth considering
 unki dharna he ki ‘‘sahjanubhuti pandit ramachandra shukla kii muktavastha ke nikat he
 Shuklji has believed that the poet attains the heart's freedom while writing the poem and while reciting the poem
 shuklaji ke vichaar main kavy-rachana athwa kavyaswadan ke samay vyakti itnaa bhav-vibhor ho uthta he ki vah apane sharir tathaa sharir-saapeksh sambandhon kii chintaa ko kuch samay ke liye swatah bisar detaa he
 Both his body and intellect are weakened, his conscience begins to absorb the innate qualities of the soul
 aatma ke vyapak or aanandamay hone ke kaaran us kshan vyakti kaa hriday vyaktigat simaaon ko paar karke vyapak ho jaataa he or apurv anand kii anubhuti praapt karne lagata he
 In a nutshell, Muktastha means comprehensiveness and joy of the heart
 dow sinha ke mat ko yadi sweekaar kiya jaae to kalakaar yaa vyakti sahjanubhuti kii sthiti main apni simaaon ko bhul jaataa he or uski anubhuti itani prakhar ho uthati he ki vah ekagra hone ke kaaran anand kii uplabdhi karata he
 The literary utility of Croche's expressionism is considerable
 kroche ne kavy ke mul tattvon or kavi ke maanas main kavy-srijan kii prakriya kaa digdarshan is siddhanth dwaara kiya he
 According to this theory, in the taste and criticism of poetry, the emphasis has been on making the heart of that self
 jahaan tak kavy kii aatma or isaki rachana-prakriya kaa sambandh he, yah siddhanth bada moolyawaan he
 Any sensation or art is published in the form of artwork and they become a critique for the social and the critic, in such a situation, the medium of transmission between the social is the artwork
 kala ke sambandh main vichaar karte samay kalakriti kii nitant upeksha nahin kii ja sakati, bhale hi kalakriti ke bahya rup kaa is sampoorn sthiti main gaun mahatva kyon na ho
 To clarify this, man's simile can be given
 manushya main aatm-tatva yaa praan-tatva hi pramukh he, iske bina uske astitv kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati he
 But still the physical elements of man can never be ignored
 manushya kaa sharir bhale hi gaun mahatva kaa ho kintu us sharir ke bina usamen nihit aatm-tatva kaa prakaashan asambhav he
 Without the body, the soul cannot express its existence
 atah spasht he ki kroche ke siddhanth main kalakriti ke shilp-vidhaan kii charchaa ko anaavashyak samajhakar asweekaar kiya gaya he
 Craft is an essential aspect of expression
 is par yadi vichaar nahin kiya jayega to aatm-tatva kii abhivyakti or use hridyangam karne kii vidhi main asuvidha hogi
 According to Croche, criticism of the artist based on stylistic features would be meaningless
 yah sahi he ki upyog or auchity kaa sambandh multah soundarya yaa abhivyanjana se nahin he
 Yet when poetry takes the form of artistry by obtaining external revelation, then the simple rules of life, utility and justification become natural parts of it
 is tathy kii kroche ne avhelnaa kii he
 As it has been said, this theory of croche is of great importance, but it has become one-sided because of its absolute subjectivity
 hindi main kroche ke siddhanth ko lekar kaaphi bhram failaa he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla called the expression 'vagavachitrayaivism', calling it the 'exaltation of Indian quibbleism'
 shukla ji ke is kathan ke baad se acharya kuntak ke vakroktvaad ke saath kroche ke abhivyanjanawad kii tulana karne kii parampara chal padi he
 But this does not seem appropriate
 vastutah kroche ke abhivyanjanawad main ukti vaichitraya nahin he, ise vakroktvaad kahana bhi galat he
 The famous Sanskrit Achanta Kuntaka considered Vakrokti as the soul of poetry
 vakrokti se unka abhipraay kathan kii vakrata se he
 There is a certain synergy in the theories of Kuntak and Croche, but the contrast is much more, which is briefly as follows- hossain kuwajarawala ek bhartiya abhinayta he, inhone kai dharawahikon tathaa filmon main kaary kiya he
 Social accounting or social audit is the process related to the evaluation of social executions of any program or action, which directly or indirectly is related to the society
 iskaa prayog kisi kaary ke praathmik str arthath udbhav se lekar kriyanvayan evam us kriyanvayan ke dirghakaal tak ke prabhaavon kii swatantra va nishpaksh jaanch or us jaanch main parilakshith kamiyon main sudhaar kaa pareekshan, auchityata ke saath kiya jaataa he taaki samaaj ke hit main har str tak vikaas ho sake
 Generally in social accounting, an account is made of what and how much the economic activities of an institution have an impact on society and the environment
 praaia: saamaajik lekha kii baat kisi vyapaarik yaa audyogic pratishthan ke sandarbh main kii jaati he
 Social accounting is different from traditional accounting in many ways
 paramparaagat lekha main samaaj or sanstha ke paraspar sambandhon evam aadan-pradaan ko bahut kam mahatv diya jaataa he
 Conversely the concept of accounting in social accounting is expanded more - jai pandas bharat kii solahavin loksabhaa main saansad hai

 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 539 BCE, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 kya dil ne kaha 2002 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 The film's music album, composed by Himesh Reshammiya, was released by Sony on 12 April 2002

 He was the first Test-cricketer to score a half-century in Test matches for India
 bhautikee main, urja vastuon kaa ek gun he, jo anya vastuon ko sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he yaa vibhinn roopon main roopantarit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The ability of any worker to work is called energy
 oonchaai se girte hue jal main urja he kyonki usase ek pahiye ko ghumaya ja saktaa he jisase bijli paidaa kii ja sakati he
 It is difficult to give a simple definition of energy
 urja vastu nahin he
 We cannot see it, it does not surround any place, nor does it have any shadow
 sankshep main, anya vastuon kii bhanti yah dravya nahin he, yadyapi bahudhaa dravya se iskaa ghanishtha sambandh rahata he
 Yet its existence is as real as that of any other object and because in a mass community, which does not have the influence of any external force, its quantity is not deficient
 saadhaarant: kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 When a hunter with a bow pulls the strings, the bow brings energy which is used to drive the arrow to the hunt
 behate pani main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog panchakki chalaane main athwa kisi duusare kaam ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, gunpowder has energy, which can be used to break stone rocks or fire with cannon
 bijli kii dhara main urja hoti he jisase bijli kii motor chalaai ja sakati he
 Sunlight has energy that can be used to generate electric current by light cells
 aise hi anubam main nabhikeey urja rahati he jiskaa upyog shatru kaa vidhwans karne athwa anya kaaryon main kiya jaataa he
 Thus we see that energy is found in many forms
 tane hue spring main jo urja he use sthitij urja kehete hai; behate pani kii urja gatij urja he; barood kii urja rasinic urja he; bijli kii dhara kii urja vaidyut urja he; surya ke prakaash kii urja ko prakaash urja kehete hai
 The energy in the sun is due to its high temperature
 isko ushma urja kehete hai
 Energy can be converted from one form to another by various measures
 in parivartanon main urja kii maatra sarvada ek hi rahati he
 There is no lack in it
 ise urja-avinashita-siddhant kehete hai
 It is said above that the ability to work is called energy
 parantu sari urja ko kaary main parinat karnaa sarvada sambhav nahin hota
 Therefore it would be more appropriate to say that energy is an object that decreases as much as work
 is kaaran urja ko naapane ke ve hi ekak hote hai
 To measure the work
 yadi ham ek kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaate hai to prithvi ke gurutvkarshan ke viruddh ek vishesh maatra main kaary karnaa padataa he
 If we lift the same weight two meters high or lift two kilograms one meter high, then in both cases double work will have to be done as before
 isse prakat hota he ki kaary kaa pariman us bal ke pariman par, jiske viruddh kaary kiya jaae or us duuri ke pariman par, jis duuri dwaara us bal ke viruddh kaary kiya jaae, nirbhar rahata he or in donon parimaanon ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 We can consider any quantity of work as a unit of work
 udhaahrant: ek kilogram bhaar ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use ekak mana ja saktaa he
 But the attraction of the earth is not the same everywhere
 iskaa jo maan chennai main he vah dilli main nahin he
 Therefore, this unit is inconclusive
 phir bhi bahut se deshon main ejeeniyar aise hi ekak kaa upyog karte hai
 Which is called foot-pound
 yah us kaary kii maatra he jo landan ke akshansh main samudratat par ek pound ko ek duusare hi ekak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo centimetre-gram-senkad ke upar nirbhar he
 In this, the unit of force is called "dine"
 dine bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek gram ke pind main ek second main ek centimetre prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 The point of action of this force is one cent against it
 m The amount of work that is required to be removed is called a square
 parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se kaary kaa yah ekak bahut chota he
 Therefore, a second unit is used in daily practice
 isamen lambaai kaa ekak centimetre ke sthaan par meter he tathaa dravyaman kaa ekak gram ke sthaan par kilogram he
 The unit of force in it is "newton"
 newton bal kaa vah ekak he jo ek kilogram ke pind main ek second main ek meter prati second kaa veg utpann kar saktaa he
 In this way, Newton equals 1 xxrep 5 0 dines
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko uske viruddh ek meter tak hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use jul kehete hai
 One joule equals 107 argo
 urja ko bhi inhen ekakon main napa jaataa he
 But sometimes some other units are used at special sites
 inamen ek electron volt he
 It is the unit of energy that an electron receives when it passes through the voltage difference
 yah bahut chota ekak he or keval 1
60 x 10 -19 jul ke baraabar hota he
 Additionally, a second unit is used to measure the electrical energy used in homes, called kilowatt-hours and which is equal to 3
6x 10 6 joules
 The unit of energy is the energy fields of Zon Percott Joule
 i kept 'joule' in memory of bringing a revolution
 un vastuon kii apeksha, jinke astitv kaa anumaan ham keval tark ke aadhaar par kar sakate hai, hamen un vastuon kaa gyaan adhik sugamawa se hota he jinhen ham sthool rup se dekh sakate hai
 The feeling of that form of energy first emerged in the brain of man, which is related to the big bodies and which can be seen clearly when it is turned into a work with the help of instruments
 is yantric urja ke do rup hai : ek sthitij urja evam doosraa gatij urja
 On the contrary, knowledge of the energy which is related to the movement of atoms and atoms occurred to humans later
 is kaaran yah kam aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki newton se bhi pehle francis bekan kii yah dharna thi ki ushma dravya ke kanon kii gati ke kaaran he
 The work we have to do to lift a body of one kilogram weight against the attraction of the earth one meter high, we can say kilogram-meter and it is equal to about 981 joules
 yadi ham ek door lekar ore use ek ghirani ke upar daalkar uske donon siron se lagbhag ek kilogram ke pind baandhe or unhen aisi avasthaa main choden ki ve donon ek hi oonchaai par na hon or unche pind ko bahut dhire-se neeche aane den to ham dekhenge ki ek kilogram ke pind ko ek meter unchaa uthaa degaa
 The lower the friction in the pulley, the second body can be kept equal to the weight of the first body
 isak arth yah hua ki yadi ham kisi pind ko prithvi se unchaa bad jaati he
 If a body of one kilogram is raised to 5 meters high, it has the capacity to work 5 kilogram-meters, and its energy increases to the same magnitude as before
 yah urja prithvi tathaa pind kii aapekshik sthiti ke kaaran hoti he or vastut: prithvi evam pind dwaara bane tantra kii urja hoti he
 That is why it is called potential energy
 jab kabhi bhi pindon ke kisi samudaay kii parsparik duuri athwa ek hi pind ke vibhinn bhaagon kii swaabhaavik sthiti main antar utpann hota he to sthitij urja main bhi antar aa jaataa he
 Pressing the segmental or bowing the bow brings potential energy to them
 nadiyon main band baandhakar pani ko adhik oonchaai par ikattha kiya jaae to is pani main sthitij urja aa jaati he
 Newton defined the force as the force equal to the rate of change of momentum
 yadi m kilogram kaa koi pind prarambh main sthir ho or usapar ek niyat bal F, t senkad tak kaary karke jo veg utpann kare uskaa maan v meter prati second ho to bal kaa maan m v t { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv}{t}}} newton hoga
 At the same time, if the distance the body moves is d m, then the work done by the force will be equal to Fd joules
 arthath m dravyamanvaalen pind kaa veg yadi v ho to uski urja 1 2 m v 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}} hogi
 This energy is due to its motion in that body and is called kinetic energy
 jab ham dhanush ko jhukaakar tir chhodte hai to dhanush kii sthitij urja tir kii gatij urja me parivartan ho jaati he
 The most beautiful example of the reciprocal transformation of potential energy and kinetic energy is simple pendulum
 jab ham lolak ke golak ko ek ore khinchate hai to golak apni saadhaaran sthiti se thodaa unchaa uth jaataa he or isamen sthitij urja aa jaati he
 When we release the ball, the ball starts swinging here and there
 jab golak latakane kii saadhaaran sthiti main aata he to isamen keval gatij urja rahati he
 Due to momentum, the ball moves to the other side and the kinetic energy is again converted to potential energy
 saadhaarant: vaayu ke gharshan ke viruddh kaary karne se golak kii urja kam hoti jaati he or isaki gati kuch der main band ho jaati he
 If there is no force of friction then the pendulum will go on for eternity
 gati vigyaan main urja-avinashita-siddhant ke pramanit ho jane ke baad bhi iske duusare swaroopon kaa gyaan na hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa tha ki kai sthitiyon main urja nasht bhi ho sakati he; jaise, jab kisi pindsamudaay ke vibhinn bhaagon main apekshik gati ho to gharshan ke kaaran sthitij or gatij urja kam ho jaati he
 In fact, in such situations the energy is not destroyed, but the heat energy changes
 parantu 18veen shatabdi tak ushma ko urja kaa hi ek swatantra swaroop nahin samajha jaataa tha
 Till that time, there was a belief that heat is a substance
 19veen shatabdi main prayogon dwaara yah nirvivaad rup se siddh kar diya gaya ki ushma bhi urja kaa hi ek doosraa rup he
 Even in prehistoric times, humans used to produce fire by rubbing wood, but Benjamin Tamson first noticed the close connection of energy and heat
 yah sanyukt rajya ke maisachusets pradesh kaa rahanevaala tha
 But at that time it was the war minister of the King of Bavaria
 dhali hui pital kii top kii naliyon ko chhedate samay isane dekha ki nalee bahut garm ho jaati he tathaa usase nikle buraade or bhi garam ho jate hai
 In one experiment, by filling the water in the lumbar vessel around the canal cord, he saw that the heat generated by the lathe reached the temperature of boiling in two and a half hours
 is prayog main uskaa vaastavik dhyey yah siddh karnaa tha ki ushma koi drav nahin he jo pindon main hoti he or daab ke kaaran vaise hi baahar nikal aati he jaise nichodne se kapade main se pani; kyonki yadi aisa hota to kisi pind main yah drav ek simit maatra main hi hota, parantu chhednevaale prayog se gyaat hota he ki jitna hi adhik kaary kiya jaae utani hi adhik ushma utpann hogi
 Rumford did this experiment in 1798 AD
 iske 20 varsh pehle hi lavvajie tathaa laagranz ne yah dekha tha ki jaanwaron main bhojan se utani hi ushma utpann hoti he jitani rasinic kriya dwaara us bhojan se praapt ho sakati he
 In 1819, French scientist Duals observed that the compression of a gas produces heat in the same proportion as the work done in compression
 san 1842 i
 main isi bhaavana kaa upyog julius rabart mir ne, jo us samay keval 28 varsh kaa tha or germany ke hylebron nagar main doctor tha, is baat kii gananaa ke liye kiya ki ek calories ushma utpann karne ke liye kitna kaary aavashyak he
 We know that each gas has two specific heat: one at a fixed volume and the other at a fixed pressure
 pehali avasthaa main gas koi kaary nahin karti
 In the second stage, the gas has to work against the external pressure and the difference between the two specific heat is equivalent to this work
 is tarah mir ko ushma ke yantric tulyank kaa jo maan praapt hua vah lagbhag utana hi tha jitna count rumford ko praapt hua tha
 At the same time in England, James Prescott Joule was also engaged in extracting a mechanical equivalent of heat
 iske prayog san 1842 i
 se san 1852 i
 tak chalate rahe
 In its experiment, it took water in a copper thermometer and churned it with a churner
 mathni ko do ghiraniyon par se latake hue do bhaaron par chalaaya jaataa tha
 The door with which these loads were hanging was wrapped in the end of this churn and when these loads were falling down, the churn used to rotate
 jab ye bhaar neeche girte the to inaki sthitij urja kam ho jaati thi
 Part of this reduction was converted into kinetic energy of loads and some part was spent moving the churn
 is tarah yah gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha ki mathni ko ghumne main kitna kaary kiya ja rahaa tha
 With the increase in the temperature of the thermometer water, it could be known how much heat was generated; And then the mechanical equilibrium of heat could be found
 jul ne ye prayog pani tathaa paara donon ke saath kiye
 In 1847, Hermann Phan Helmholts wrote a book in which heat-indestructibility theory was given by examples of various fields such as heat, magnet, electricity, physicochemical etc
 jul ne prayog dwaara vaidyut urja tathaa ushma-urja kii samanta siddh kii
 See - Electrical Energy san 1905 i
 main ainstin ne apana aapekshik siddhant pratipaadit kiya jiske anusaar kanon kaa dravyaman unki gatij urja par nirbhar rahata he
 This means that the value of energy is obtained by multiplying the mass increase by the square of the velocity of light
 is siddhant kii pushti nabhikeey vigyaan ke bahut se prayogon dwaara hoti he
 This is how energy is produced in the sun
 surya main ek shrinkhal kriya hoti he jiskaa fal yah hota he ki hydrogen ke chaar nabhikon ke sanyog se helium kaa nabhik ban jaataa he
 The mass of the four nuclei of hydrogen is slightly more than the nucleus of helium
 yah antar urja main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The same mass-energy-equivalent is also used in atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs
 varnakram ke vibhinn varnon ke anusaar krishna pind ke vikiran ke vitaran kaa thik sutara kya he, iskaa adhyayan karte hue plank is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki vikiran kaa aadan pradaan aniyamit maatra main nahin hota pratyut urja ke chote kanon dwaara hota he
 These particles remain
 aavritisankhya ko jis niyatank se guna karne par urjaaquantum kaa maan praapt hota he use plank niyatank kehete hai
 Niels Burr showed in 1913 that this quantum theory is very broad and the orbits in which electrons move in atoms
 ve kakshaayen bhi kwantum siddhant ke anusaar hi nishchit hoti hai
 When the electron moves from a high-energy orbit to a low-energy orbit, the difference of these two energies comes out as light
 hikeenberg, shrodinger tathaa diraaq ne is kwantum siddhant ko or bhi vistrut kiya he
 In modern physics, energy is said to be essential for every task
 urja sangrakshan siddhant ke anusaar urja ko na to janaa ja saktaa he or naa to nasht kiya ja saktaa keval iskaa swaroop badla ja saktaa he
 We use energy in many forms for use in our daily life, such as mechanical energy, electrical energy, thermal energy, light energy, chemical energy, etc
 motor main vidyut urja ko yantric urja main badal kar kaam liya jaataa he to bydaree main rasaynic urja ko vidyut urja main
 The human body digests the chemical energy of foods and performs mechanical work with it
 isi prakaar ek vidyut balb vidyut urja ko prakaan tathaa ooshmiya urja main badal detaa he
 The engine of a car or bus converts the chemical energy of petrol first into thermal energy and then into mechanical energy
 in sabhi kaaryon ke liye prayukt urja in sroton se praapt hoti he - The concept of energy came in the nineteenth century
 yah maanav dwaara avishkrut ek atyant mahatvapurn evam moulik avadharana he
 It is very useful in expressing the interactions occurring in various types of events in numerical form
 ise ek tarah se vibhinn bhautik phenamena ke bich hone vaali antalakriyaaon ke liye sarvanisht mudra kii tarah samajha ja saktaa he
 The concept of energy is related to change and transmission, which are the basis of the industrial revolution
 jab tak keval maanvi yaa pashavik urja se hi kaam hota tha, tab tak urja simit thi; use swachaalit evam niyantrit karnaa kathin kaary tha
 But this situation changed with the invention of machines like steam, which led to the industrial revolution
 aadhunik kaal main kisi desh dwaara khapat kii jane vaali urja uske vikaas kii pramukh maap he
 Relative energy of free radicals of m { \ displaystyle m} mass and v { \ displaystyle v} velocity: praudyogiki, vyaavhaarik or audyogic kalaon or prayukt vigyaanon se sambandhit adhyayan yaa vigyaan kaa samooh he
 Many people use the terms technical and engineering interchangeably
 jo log praudyogiki ko vyavsaay rup main apanaate he unhe abhiyanta kaha jaataa he
 Humans have been using technology since time immemorial
 aadhunik sabhyataa ke vikaas main takneekee kaa bahut bada yogadan he
 Societies or nations that are technically competent are also able to be strategic and they can also become financially competent
 aise main koi aashcharya nahin hona chaiye ki abhiyantriki kaa armbh sainik abhiyantriki se hi hua
 After this, civil engineering emerged to solve the problems and requirements related to construction of roads, houses, fortifications, bridges etc
 audyogic kranti ke saath-saath yantric takneekee aayi
 This was followed by electrical engineering, chemical technology and other technologies
 vartmaan samay computer praudyogiki or soochna praudyogiki kaa he

 yahan se vartmaan vidhayak benedic aar maarak hai
 Following is the list of mlas from this constituency - rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh, jinhen angrezi main kaamanwealth rfyalm kaha jaataa he, rashtron ke rashtramandal ke un 16 saarvbhaumik rashtron ko kaha jaataa he, jinpar ek hi shaasha, maharani elizabeth dwi kaa raaj he
 All these countries share the same state, ruler, royal family and succession order
 is vyavastha kii shuruyaat 1931 kii westminster kii sanvidhi ke saath hui thi, jiske dwaara britain ke tatkaaleen dominian, australia, canada, newzealand, irish mukt rajya or newfoundland ko british rashtramandal ke baraabar ke sadsy hone ke saath hi purna yaa purnatmat vaidhik swatantraaa pradaan kii gayi thi
 Since the Second World War, all countries of the British Empire, extended around the world, were granted independence as a Dominion
 jiname se kuch rajyon ne purnatah swadhin hone ke baavjood rajtantr ke prati apni vafadaari ko barqaraar rakhaa, jabaki kuch rajyon ne british rajtantr ko nammaatr pramukh maanane se inkaar kar swayan ko ganatantric rajya ghoshit kar diya
 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he
 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present
 atah in pradeshon kaa bodh karne hetu, kisi raja ke adheen bhoomi kaa bodh karaane vaale kisi bhi shabd kaa upyog kiya jaasakata he
 Ordinarily, words like prajbhoomi, pradesh, and paribhumi are used, besides these, the terms mandal and rajbhumi can also be used
 vartmaan sthitinusaar, varsh 1992 se, vishwa main kul 16 rashtramandal prajabhumiyaan hai, jinka kul kshetrafal 1,87,00,000 varg kilometre he, or aabaadi 14,30,00,000 he
 Of which 6 are the most populated countries: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica
 rajmukut athwa da crown kii vyavastha ek vishesh raajnneetik sankalpana he, jisaki britain tathaa anya rashtramandal pradeshon ke vidhishastra tathaa rajatantric vyavastha main atimahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress
 ek santhaan ke rup main, rajmukut, britain kii raajnneetikvyavastha kaa sabase purana kaaryshil santhaan he
 The concept of Rajmukut in each Commonwealth region is the same, but divided legal concepts
