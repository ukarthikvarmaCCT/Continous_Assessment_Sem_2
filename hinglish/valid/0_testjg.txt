 rawal, rajasthan ke sirohi, paali, jalor jilon kaa nivasee brahman samudaay he
 'rawal' was a title given to the priest or Rajguru, the best scholar among the Brahmins
 yah padavi rajasthan ke sirohi jile main basane vaale brahmanon ko di jaati thi
 Later, he started adopting his surname caste 'rawal' and later called 'rawal Brahmin'
 sirohi ,paali tathaa jalor main based rawal brahaman samaaj ek swatantra samooh he jaati nahin he
 In the Brahmin castes of India, a group called Rawal Brahman is neither mentioned in Jati Bhaskar nor is there any such mention in the Brahmins Uttapati Martand, but from the depths it is known that when the establishment of Saraneshwarji after Shri Sthal
 It was then that the Brahmins who passed from Siddhpur went to a village called Gol which is presently near Sirohi and there was a Jagiri rate which in time Gorwal Brahman One group of the same group called Gautama gotra became Rawal Brahmin as the focal point of the group which is commonly called Vadakiya
 usee prakaar siddhapura se padhaare brahamanon ke ek varg ko jise harishchandra ke putr rohit ke naam se vikhyath rohitpur main basaaya gaya jo kalantar main rodwal brahaman kahalaaye uname se ek samooh kaa rawal brahaman samudaay main vilinikaran ho gaya jinhen krishnatraiya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Similarly, the Kashyapa gotra brothers from Pali area merged into the Raval community, which was later called Lurkiya, Shanai: Kapil Tilua and other advanced Brahmin gotras got merged in this community which later became a separate identity called Raval Brahman
 rawal brahaman naamak jaati kaa ullekh kahi bhi nahin miltaa he parantu rawal shabd atak kaa ghotak he rawal se taatpary he rajyakul raja ke guru ko rawal kehete he
 Similarly, from the Sirohi royal family, it was received as Rawal title and also as many villages were received as Jagiri, so it is right here that rawal shabd padavi kaa ghotak rahane ke kaaran ek varg ne inhen pruthak rup de diya jo kalantar main rawal brahman naam se pruthak pahchaan ban gai
 But in all this, the Vadakiya group became the first citizen of Rawal Brahmin group, this is reflected here which came as the priest of Lord Saraneshwarji
 avantak jise ham atak kehete he shabd se taatpary tha karm
 All were Brahmins, but there was a division of karmos into Brahmins

 lekin uski ek shart thi - ki wo vigrah band kamare main banaayegaa or uskaa kaam khatm hone tak koi bhi kamare kaa dwaar nahin kholegaa, nahin to wo kaam adhuraa chhod kar chalaa jaayegaa
 After 6-7 days, when the sound of working ceased, he could not keep up with the king and thinking that something must have happened to the Brahmin, he opened the door
 par andar to sirf bhagwaan kaa adhuraa vigrah hi mila or boodhaa brahman lupt ho chukaa tha
 Then the king realized that Brahmins were none other than Vishwakarma, the architect of the gods
 raja ko aghat ho gaya kyonki vigrah ke haath or pair nahin the or vah pachhtaawaa karne laga ki usne dwaar kyon kholaa
 But then Narada Muni came in the form of a Brahmin and he told the king that God wanted to incarnate in this form and the thought of opening the door was put by Shri Krishna himself in the mind of the king
 isaliye use aghat chintan karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he or vah nishcint ho jaye kyonki sab shri krishna kii ichha hi he
 The second story is from the Mahabharata and tells what is the secret of Jagannath's form

 The queens requested him to tell them about Shri Krishna's Bal Lilao
 subhadra ji dwaar par paharaa de rahi thi, ki agar krishna or balram aa jaayenge to wo sabko aagaah kar degi
 But she too became so engrossed in listening to Krishna's Bal Leelao, that she had no idea of krishna Balarama's arrival
 dono bhaaiyo ne jo suna, us se unhe itnaa anand mila kii unke bal sidhe khadey ho gayi, unki ankhen badi ho gayi, unke hothon par bahut bada smit chaa gaya or unke sharir bhakthi ke prembhav vaale vaataavaran main pighalane lage
 Subhadra became very emotional, so her body melted most
 tabhi vahaan naarad muni padhaare or unke aane se sab log waapas aavesh main aaye
 Seeing this form of Shri Krishna, Narada said, "lord, how beautiful you look
 aap is rup main avatar kab lenge?" tab krishna ne kaha ki kaliyug main wo aisa avatar lenge or unhone ne kaliyug main raja indradyumna ko nimit banaakar jagannatha avatar liya

 The year 1918 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00721 uttar pradesh ke jile Quibble is a word formed from the treaty of two words 'curve' and 'utterance'
 iskaa shabdic arth he- aisi ukti jo saamaanya se alag ho
 Tereda statement means that the word has power
 bhamah ne vakrokti ko ek alankaar mana tha
 His later Kuntaka developed curvature as a complete theory and incorporated all the parts of poetry into it
 isliye kuntak ko vakrokti sampradaay kaa pravartak acharya mana jaataa he
 Kuntaka is credited with the prestige and rendering of the Vibhokti theory, but its tradition is ancient
 bhamah ke purvavarti kaviyon baan, subandhu aadi main iske sandarbh praapt hote hai
 Bhamah has used curvature in a broader sense
 unhone vakrokti main shabd or arth, donon kaa antarbhaav mana he
 They have used quibble and exaggeration in the same sense
 atishyokti kaa arth he lokatikrant gocharata
 Vibhokti is considered as the original decking for the same reason
 iske bina vaakya kavy na rahakar vaarta maatr rah jaataa he
 Dandi has also given importance to Vakrokti as Bhamah
 dandi ne waniumay ke do bhed bataaye hai- swaabhaavokti tathaa vakrokti
 Dandi has accepted curvature and exaggeration at the root of all ornaments
 bhamah or dandi main keval yah antar he ki bhamah sbhavokti ko vakrokti kii paridhi main sweekaar karte hai or dandi use bhinn maanate hue vakr kathan se kam mahatvapurn samajhate hai
 Anandavardhana has not given an independent interpretation of quibble
 unhone ise vishisht alankaar maanakar iske saamaanya tathaa vyapak rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhana, while acknowledging the curvilinear significance of Bhamah, considered the exaggeration and quibble synonymous and accepted all the embellishments as exaggerated
 abhinavgupt ne vakrokti ke saamaanya rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 According to them, the curvature of words and meanings is their extraterrestrial position and the meaning of this extraterrestrial is excessive
 vakrokti siddhant ke pravartak kuntak ne apane granth vakrokti jivitam main vakrokti ko kavy kii aatma kaha he
 He has given proper place to all poetry - Varna miracle, word beauty, elegance of content, unpredictability, management imagination etc
 by adhering to all poetic principles under curvature
 kuntak ke anusaar vakrokti keval vaak-chaaturya athwa ukti chamatkaar nahin he, vah kavi vyapaar athwa kavi kaushal he
 According to Dr
 Nagendra "in modern terms, it can be called artism - the most important element of poetry is art
" iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kuntak ne apane siddhant main vishay-vastu kaa nishedh kiya he
 He has accepted the natural elegance of the poetic object
 kavi ko kavy vastu ke sahruday-romantic dharmon ko vyakt karnaa chahie
 This is possible only with the talent of the poet
 is prakaar unke anusaar antat kavi vyapaar hi pramukh he
 " bhartiya kavy siddhant main ras siddhant anubhuti athwa bhaavana par aadhaarit he or alankaar siddhant kavi kalpana par aadhaarit he
 The quibble theory is related to the decking principle in this respect
 vakrokti main alankaaron ke kalpana vaichitrya ko vyapak aadhaar par sweekaar kiya gaya he
 This imagination is unique, not congenial
 dhwani tathaa vakrokti kaa antar bhi yahi he ki dhwani kii kalpana sahrudayanishth he or vakrokti kii kalpana kavyanishth
 Therefore, the approach of sound is subjective and objective of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrokti kaa praan maanakar kalpana ke saath bhaavana ke mahatv ko bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Kuntaka has also considered angular curvature as a part of curvature
 vakrata ke bina ras kii sthiti sambhav nahin he jabaki ras ke bina vakrata kii apni swatantra sthiti he
 Kuntaka considers desperation curvature to be contemptible, not giving importance to such a situation
 kuntak kaa vakrokti siddhant vyapak or samanvayshil siddhant he
 At the core of its origin is sound theory with a tradition of ornamentation theory
 kuntak ke vakrokti siddhant main sampurna kavy ko sweekruti mili he
 Even if the force in his theory is on the art side, his explanation has the full support of the object side and the emotional side

 While the calendars share a common ancestry, they also have minor but significant changes such as intercalation schedules, month names and numbers, access cycles, etc
 thailand main, naam buddha yug he ek varsh numbering pranali dwaara saajha paaramparik thai chandra-saura calendar or thai saura calendar
 The Southeast Asian lunar-solar calendars are based largely on an earlier version of the Hindu calendar, which uses the solar year as the sidereal year
 ek pramukh antar yah he ki dakshin purv asian pranaaliyon ke vipareet, unke chachere bhai kaa upyog nahin karte, spasht gananaa karne ke liye ke saath sinc main rahane nakshatra varsh he
 Instead, he employs his version of the Metonic cycle

 Among all the Theravada traditions, the important year 0 of the calendar was the date of the day in which the Buddha attained parinibbāna
 However, all traditions are agreed upon when it actually took place
 main burmi buddha parampara main, yah tha 13 may 544 isa purv 
 lekin thailand main, yah tha 11 march 545 isa purv kii taarikh he, jo vartmaan thai chandra-saura or saura calendar ke rup main upyog mahatvapurn tithi he
 Yet, the Thai calendar has fixed for some reason the difference between their Buddhist era numbering and the Christian / Common Era number 543, which points to an important year in 544 BC, not 545 BC
 In Myanmar, the difference between CE and CE can be 543 or 544 dates for CE, and dates for 544 or 543 BC, depending on the Buddhist era of the month
 In Sri Lanka, there can be difference between CE and 544

 The Buddhist calendar is a lunar-solar calendar in which the lunar months are based on the month and the solar years are based on the year
 main se ek apni praathmik uddeshyon sincranaise karne ke liye chandra ke saath bhaag saura hissaa he
 For the lunar month, normally twelve, consisting of them alternately for a total of 29 days and 30 days, that would include such a normal lunar year as opposed to 354 days ~ 365

2456 dinon or ek maheene ke bare main 29
530496 dinon main, yadi sahi nahin he,
 As such, the calendar connects the leap year to an intercalary month and sometimes even the great leap year into an intercalary day
 ke intercalary maheene na keval sahi lambaai saal ke liye lekin yah bhi sahi jamate kii truti ke liye is maheene kii had tak aadhe se ek din
 To improve the average length of the month by adding further one day Nayon at irregular intervals — two cycles in a little over seven times
 The intercalary day is never inserted except in one year, which is an intercalary month
 The Hindu calendar inserts an intercalary month at any time of the year as soon as a month for accumulated varying amounts
 The Burmese calendar however always inserts the intercalary month after the time of the same year, the summer solstice while the Arakanese calendar inserts it after the spring equinox
 vaastavik burmi calendar varsh ke hote hai, 354, 384 yaa 385 dinon kaa he
 Note: Arakanese calendar says intercalary day in Tagu, not Nayon
 cambodia, lao or thai chandra calendar kaa upyog ek alag vidhi ke liye jagah intercalary din he
 Instead of it as a leap year in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it a different year
 is prakaar, thai chote lip varsh he 355 dinon jabaki thai great lip varsh he 384 dinon ke liye
 Since the main purpose of the solar year is to keep pace with the Buddhist calendar, the new year is always marked by the solar year, which falls when the sun enters Aries at the time

 Therefore, all kinds of sidereal-based calendars are lunar-solar calendars, slowly drifting away from the seasons
 The calendar flows approximately every 60 years and 4 months in a day
 jamate bahaav ke khilaaf sijan kaa matlab he jo nav varsh diwas ke liye istemaal kiya par gir 22 march main 638 CE ab gir jaataa he par 17 april 2013 main CE

 Buddha's lifetime during date events to be used 11 march 545 isa purv The tradition of using different reference calendars continued in Siam in 1912 when King Vajiravudh ruled that the Buddhist era now tracked the Thai solar calendar, the Gregorian calendar of the Siamese version, on 1 April of New Year's Day
 Therefore, the year 2455 of the Thai Buddhist era began on 1 April 1912
 The Thai Buddhist era was further to reorganize on the Gregorian calendar on 6 September 1940 when Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram decreed 1 January 1941 as the beginning of the year to be 2484
 As a result, the year 2483 was only 9 months long, and equals the Thai Buddhist era that the common era plus 543 years

 arabi bhashaa main shabd sira yaa sirat kriya sara se aata he, jiskaa matlab he yatra karnaa yaa yatra karnaa
 a person's sera is a person who travels through life, or biography, events in their birth, events, etiquette and characteristics, and their deaths
 aadhunik upyog main yah kisi vyakti ke phir se shuru karne kaa bhi ullekh kar saktaa he
 It is sometimes written as "sira", "sirah" or "siraat", meaning "life" or "journey"
 islamic sahitya main, bahuvachan rup, siyaar, yuddh ke niyamon or gaiyr-musalamaanon se nipatane kaa bhi ullekh kar saktaa he
 The phrase Sirat Rasul Ilaha, or al-sira al-nabawiya, refers to the study of Muhammad's life
 sira shabd pehali baar ibin shihab al-juhari dwaara mohammad kii jeevani se judaa hua tha, or baad main ebn hisham ke kaam se lokapriy hua
 In the first two centuries of Islamic history, Sira was commonly known as Maghazi, now considered only a subset of Sira
 sira ke shuruaati kaaryon main kai aitihaasik report, yaa akhbaar shaamil hai, or prayek report ko khabar kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes the word tradition or hadith is used
 sira sahitya main vibhinn visham samagriyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, jinamein mukhya rup se mohammad or unke saathi dwaara kiye gaye sainya abhiyaanon kii kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 These stories are intended as historical accounts and are used for worship
 sira main kai likhit dastavej bhi shaamil hai, jaise ki raajnneetik sandhi, sainya suchi, adhikariyon ke kaary, videshi shaskaon ko patr, or aage bhi
 It also records some speeches and sermons made by Muhammad, like his speech in the Farwell pilgrimage
 kuch sira khaaton main kavita ke chand shaamil hai jo kuch ghatnaon or ladaai kaa jashn manaate hai
 While some of these are considered to be of low quality and lack of authenticity, the most serious of them are by Hasan ibn Thabit
 baad kii avadhi main, sira main shaamil kuch prakaar kii kahaniyaan apane swayan ke alag-alag shaileyon main viksit huin
 One genre is concerned with stories of prophetic miracles, called alam al-nubuwa
 ek anya style, jise flyal vaa mathlib kaha jaataa he - kahaniyaan jo vyaktigat saathi, dushmano or mohammad ke anya ullekhneey samakaleen logon kii yogyata or dosha dikhaati hai
 Some of Sira's works also put the story of Muhammad as part of a narrative that included stories of former prophets, Persian kings, pre-islamic Arab tribes, and Rashidun
 quran main varnit ghatnaon se sira ke kuch hisson ko prerit kiya gaya tha, yaa vistrut kiya gaya tha
 These parts were often used by the authors of Tafsir and Essb al-nuzul to provide background information for the events mentioned in some sections
 haddees or aitihaasik report ke bich mukhya antar yah he ki ek haddees is tarah kii ghatana se chintit nahin he, or aamtaur par samay yaa sthaan nirdisht nahin karata he
 Rather the aim of the hadith is to record a religious doctrine as the official source of Islamic law
 iske vipareet, jabaki ek kabar main kuch kanoonee yaa dharmik prabhaav ho sakate hai, iskaa mukhya uddeshy kisi nishchit ghatana ke bare main jaankaree dena he
 In terms of structure, Hadith and Khabar are very similar
 donon main isanad shaamil hai
 Thus beginning in the 8th and 9th centuries, many scholars have devoted similar efforts to both types of texts
 iske alaava kuch itihaaskaar sira or magahaaji sahitya ko haddees kaa up-samooh maanate hai
 During the early centuries of Islam, Siyara literature was taken less seriously than hadith
 umayyaad kaal main, kahanikar nijee sabhaaon or masjidon main mohammad or pehle ke bhavishyavaktaaon kii kahaniyon ko bataane ke liye istemaal karte the, kyonki unhen adhikariyon se anumati praapt hoti thi
 Many of these storytellers are now unknown
 umayyaad kaal ke baad, unki pratishtha atiranjit or kalpana karne ke icchhuk hone or israeliat par bharosa karne ke kaaran unki pratishtha bighad gai
 Thus they were banned from preaching in mosques
 baad kii avadhi main, haalanki, sira ke kaam adhik pramukh ban gaye
 Recently, Western historical criticism and the debate concerning Sira has gained a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote apologetic literature defending their material
 sadiyon se, muslim vidwaanon ne haddees kii pramanikta kii samasya ko pahachaanaa he
 They have thus developed sophisticated methods of evaluating isnadas
 yah prayek haddees ko "dhwani" main pramanik report ke liye vargeekrut karne ke liye kiya gaya tha, kyonki anya shreniyon ke alaava, shaayad kamjor logon ke liye "kamjor" ke vipareet
 Since many Sira reports also include information on the Isnad and some Sira compilers themselves were practicing jurists and hadith transmitters, it was possible to apply the same methods of hadith criticism to Sira reports
 haalanki, kuch sira report isnaad ke ek aparichit rup kaa upyog karke likhi gai thim, yaa aadhunik itihaaskaaron ne "samuhik isnaad" yaa "sanyukt report" ko kya kaha tha
 The use of collective isnad was that a report could be related to one person over another person's authority without distinguishing the words of one person
 parishuddhta kii is kami ne kuch haddees vidwaanon ko aisi koi report lene kaa netritv kiya jo pramanikta kii kami ke liye ek samuhik isnaad kaa upyog karata tha
 According to Wim Raven, it is often noted that a coherent image of Muhammad cannot be constructed from the literature of Syrah, whose authenticity and factual value have been questioned on many different grounds
 vah sira kii pramanikta ke khilaaf nimnlikhit tarkon ko soochibaddh karata he, yahaan die gaye tarkon kaa paalan karke: Nevertheless, other contents of Sira, like the constitution of Medina, are generally considered authentic
 nimnlikhit praarambhik haddees colectoron main se kuch kii suchi he jo sira or magahaaji report ekatra karne or sankalit karne main vishisht hai: Coordinates: 25 ° 36′40 ′′ n 85 ° 08′38 ′′ e / 25

 The traditional method of counting has been to continuously increment a "count" for each element of a set in one sequence, while still marking those elements so that the element is not presented more than once
 Ho, unless there are no undetected elements left; If the counter was placed on one after the first object, then the value that comes after meeting the last object gives the desired number of elements

 For example, the values of 'temperature', 'volume', 'pressure,' molecular 'mass' and 'internal' energy are describing the finite state of any physical gas, the 'current' intensity changes That number, 'and' magnetic permittivity are physical quantities completely at the center of a solenoid describing 'magnetic field' intensity

 ek bhautik maatra ke shaareerik aayam dharna foorier dwaara 1822 main shuru kii gai thi
 By convention, physical quantities are organized into systems built on a dimensional quantity basis, each of which is perceived as having its own dimensions

 For example, the physical quantity velocity is derived from the base volume length and time and the dimension is l / T
 Some derived physical quantities have dimension 1 and are said to be dimensionless quantities
 ek maatra kaha jaataa he When its broad magnitude is additive to subsystems intensive when magnitude systems are prefixed to some physical order of magnitude and their meaning: vishisht karne ke liye ek maatra jo prati unit vishisht ooshmaa kshamta chav ke liye ek maatra jo prati unit padaarth kii maatra chav ke rup main raashi vahaan bhi bhautik udhaaharan ke liye vyapak he ki na to or na hi gahan ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he maatra, koniya gati, kshetra, bal, lambaai or samay he
 The term physical quantity generally means well
 It is clear that behind a set of quantities like temperature - inverse temperature - logarithmic temperature, there is a qualitative assumption: colder hot quality

 For example, the elastic properties of an ideal medium, we need to represent 21 coefficients that can be 21 components of elastic stiffness cijkl tensor, or elastic compliance, or tensors of any of the appropriate two elements, etc
 again , We are choosing coordinates on a 21 dimensional space quality
 At this location, each point represents a particular elastic medium
