rajawat dist Ujjain mp Ajanta Caves There are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist caves located in Maharashtra, India, which belong to the 2nd century BCE
 yahan buddha dharm se sambandhit chithran evam shilpkaaree ke utkrisht namoonay milte hai
 Live illustrations are also available with them
 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings
 guphaayen ek ghaney jangal se ghiri, ashv naal aakaar ghati main ajanta gaanv se 31⁄2 kimi dur bani he
 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra

 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows
 yahan kul 29 guphaayen hai, jo ki nadi dwaara nirmit ek prapaat ke dakshin main sthit he
 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet
 ajanta kaa math jaisaa samooh he, jisamen kai vihaar evam chaityas grih hai, jo ki do charnon main bane hai
 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462–480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he— ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part
 porch kaa adhikansh kshetra kabhi muraal se bharaa rahaa hoga, jiske kai avshesh abhi bhi shesh hai
 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways

 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high
 baarah stambh andar ek vargakar coloned banaate hai jo chat ko sahaara dete hai, saath hi deevaaron ke saath-saath ek galiyara-sa banaate hai
 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation

 Mural paintings on its roofs and walls have been published in sufficient quantity

 There is a doorway between the back walls of the porch, which leads to the hall

 From the evidence just found, it appears that Warren Hastings had tried his best to save the Nawab from his inefficiencies and was also very soft towards the Begums

 The Nawab's sense of care about the dignity of the upper class can be gauged from the story of making Imambara

 On the night of every fourth day, the nobles and upper class people were given the task of breaking the secret structure and they were paid in return

 is jyotirling kii sthapana ke vishay main shivpurana main yah katha varnit he- Once the wives of Brahmins living in Maharishi Gautama's Tapovan got angry with his wife Ahilya on something
 unhone apane patiyon ko rishi gautam kaa apkaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Those Brahmins worshiped Lord Shree Ganeshji for this
 unki aradhana se prasann ho ganeshji ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha un brahmanon ne kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap ham par prasann hai to kisi prakaar rishi gautam ko is ashram se baahar nikaal den
 On hearing this, Ganeshji persuaded him to ask for such a bridesmaid
 kintu ve apane aagrah par atal rahe
 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry
 saare brahman ekatra ho go-hatyara kahkar rishi gautam kii bhartsana karne lage
 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to the Brahmins that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation
 tab unhone kaha- 'gautam! tum apane paap ko sarvatra sabko bataate hue teen baar puri prithvi kii parikrama karo
 Then return and fast here for a month
 iske baad 'brahmagiri' kii 101 parikrama karne ke baad tumhaari shuddhi hogi athwa yahan gangaji ko laakar unke jal se snaan karke ek karod parthiv shivlingon se shivaji kii aradhana karo
 After this, bathe in Gangaji again and revolve this Brahmagiri 11 times
 phir sau ghadon ke pavitra jal se parthiv shivlingon ko snaan karaane se tumhaara uddhaar hoga
 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
 chal purvak aisa karwaane vaale tumhaare ashram ke brahmanon ko main dand dena chahta hoon

 Dalit used to mean pidit, exploited, suppressed, disgusted, depressed, broken, fragmented, broken, crushed, burnt, crushed, mashed, roughed, destroyed, but now SC is now called dalit The term Dalit is used collectively for all the exploited castes considered untouchable or untouchable for thousands of years for uttering a particular caste which is Hindu society by Hindu scriptures It is located at the lowest rung in the system
 or buddha granth main paanchave paaydaan par he sanvaidhanik bhashaa main inhen hi anusuchit jati kahaan gaya he
 According to the Census of India 2011, Dalits constitute around 16
6 percent or 20
14 crore population of India
 aaj adhikansh hindu dalit buddha dharm ke taraf aakarshith hue hai or ho rahe hai, kyonki buddha banane se hindu daliton kaa vikaas hua hai
 If we look at the meaning of the term "dalit" from a comparative point of view, the poisoning against it is as follows
 "dalit" - : pidit, shoshit, dabaa hua, khinn, udhaas, tukda, khandit, todna, kuchalanaa, dala hua, pisa hua, masalaa hua, rondahua, vinasht "fruited" -: piedamukta, high, happy, joyful, unbroken, unbroken, connecting, equality, uniform, complete, complete dalit shabd kaa shabdic arth he- dalan kiya hua
 Under this comes every person who has been exploited and harassed
 ramchandra verma ne apane shabdkosh main dalit kaa arth likhaa he, masalaa hua, mardit, dabaaya, ronda yaa kuchlaa hua, vinasht kiya hua
 The meaning of the term 'dalit' has changed considerably in the last six-seven decades
 dow bhimrao ambedkar ke andolan ke baad yah shabd hindu samaaj vyavastha main sabase nichle paaydaan par sthit hajaaron varshon se asprishy samajhi jane vaali tamaam jatiyon ke liye samuhik rup se prayog hota he
 Now the post of Dalit has become a symbol of agitationalism of the castes considered untouchable
 bhartiya samvidhan main in jatiyon ko anusuchit jati naam se janaa jaataa he
 Valmiki or Bhangi is considered the lowest caste in Indian society and its traditional profession has been to clean the human excreta
 parantu aaj ke samay main is sthiti main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 The meaning of dalit is derived by Shankaracharya from dvaita in Madhurashtakam
 unhone "dalitan madhuran" kahkar shrikrishna ko sanmbodhit kiya he
 The Dalit movement in India started under the leadership of Jyotirao Govindrao Phule
 jyotiba jati se mali the or samaaj ke aise tabake se sambadh rakhte the jinhe ucch jati ke samaan adhikaar nahin praapt the
 Despite this, Jyotiba Phule always advocated the rights of the so-called 'low' caste people
 bhartiya samaaj main jyotiba kaa sabase daliton kii shiksha kaa prayaas tha
 Jyotiba was the first person who advocated the rights of Dalits as well as education of Dalits
 iske saath hi jyoti ne mahilaon ke shiksha ke liye saharaneey kadam uthaae
 Jyotiba was the first person in Indian history who not only advocated school for the education of Dalits but also established the first Dalit school
 jyoti main bhartiya samaaj main daliton ko ek aisa path dikhaaya tha jisapar aage chalakar dalit samaaj or anya samaaj ke logon ne chalakar daliton ke adhikaron kii kai ladaai ladi
 Though Jyotiba had initiated the Dalit movements in India, but Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar did the work of connecting it with the mainstream of society
 ek baat or jiskaa zikr kiye bina dalit andolan kii baat bemaani hogi wo he buddha dharm
 In 600 BCE, Buddhism raised the voice for the rights of the lower sections of Hindu society
 bhagwaan gautam buddha ne iske saath hi buddha dharm ke jariye ek saamaajik or raajnneetik kranti laane kii bhi pahal kii
 It is important to call it a political revolution because at that time religion dominated the power and the direction of society was decided by religion
 aise main samaaj ke nichle talabe ko kranti kii jo disha bhagwaan buddha ne dikhaai wo aaj bhi prasangik he
 After Charvak in India, Lord Buddha was the first person who not only raised voice against Brahminism, casteism and superstition but also gave a philosophy
 jisase ki samaaj ke log bauddhik dasyata kii zanjeeron se mukt ho saken
 If the history of the movements of the lower sections of society is seen from time to time, it will not be possible to deny Charvak
 yadhyapi charvak par kai tarah ke aarope lagaae jate hai iske baavjood charvak wo pehla shaks tha jisane logon ko bhagwaan ke bhay se mukt hone sikhaaya
 In Indian philosophy, Charvak imagined happiness without religion and God
 is tarj par dekhne par charvak bhi daliton kii awaz uthaata nazar aata he
 Well, let's return to that point when Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar started a fight to legalize the rights of Dalits
 

vakt tha jab hamaara desh bharat british upnivesh kii shrenee main aata tha
 It may have been a time of enslavement of the people but in many ways it was a golden period for the Dalits
 aaj daliton ko bharat main jo bhi adhikaar mili hai uski prishthbhumi isi shashan kii dein thi
 Human values were glorified after the renaissance and enlightenment movements in Europe
 yahi maanviya mulya europe kii kranti ke adarsh bane
 Through these ideals, a society was created in Europe in which human values were given priority
 ye alag baad he ki audyogikeekaran ke chalate in mulyon kii jagah sabase pehle puunji ne bhi europe main lee
 

 But in spite of this human rights were first recognized in Europe
 iskaa sidhaa asar bharat par padana laazmi tha or padaa bhi
 We can see its direct effect in the Constitution of India
 bhartiya samvidhan kii prastaavna se lekar sabhi anuchhed inhi maanviya adhikaron kii raksha karte nazar aate hai
 Dr
 Ambedkar took up the task of fighting the legal battle of Dalits in India as the most powerful
 dow ambedkar dalit samaaj ke praneta hai
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar first advocated social, political and economic rights for Dalits in the country
 saaf daur bhartiya samaaj ke taatkaalik swaroop kaa virodh or samaaj ke sabase pichhade or tiraskrit logon ke adhikaron kii baat kii
 Its opposition in all forms, political and social, was natural
 yahaan tak kii mahatma gandhi bhi in maangon ke virodh main kud pade
 Baba Saheb demanded that Dalits should get separate representation
 This was the most powerful and strong demand in Dalit politics till date
 desh kii swatantraaa kaa bidaa apane kandhe par maanane vaali congress kii saansen bhi is maang par tham gai thim
 The reason was obvious: People had a direct interest in the fabric of the society and no one wanted to change even a little
 mahatma gandhi ji ko iske virodh kii lathi banaaya gai or baitha diya gaya aamaran anshan par
 The fast unto death was likewise the most powerful weapon of the Mahatma of the country and he used to use this weapon to celebrate his words on the coming days
 baba sahab kisi bhi keemat par is maang se peeche nahin hatana chaahate the wo jaanate the ki is maang se peeche hatane kaa sidhaa sa matlab tha daliton ke liye uthaai gai sabase mahatvapurn maang ke khilaaf main hami bharna
 But there was pressure on them from all around
 or antat puna pact ke naam se ek samjhaute main daliton ke adhikaron kii maang ko dharm kii duhai dekar samaapt kar diya gaya
 In spite of all this, Dr
 Ambedkar did not give up and continued the fight of the people from the lower strata of the society
 ambedkar kii prayaason kaa hi ye parinaam he ki daliton ke adhikaron ko bhartiya samvidhan main jagah di gai
 Even attempts were made to protect the rights of Dalits through the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution

 hindu daliton ke 936 kii tulana main baudhon ke bich mahila or purush kaa ling anupaat 953 prati hajaar he
 This proves that the status of women in Buddhist families is far superior to that of Hindu Dalits
 yah kaaphi buddha samaaj main mahilaon kii ucch sthiti ke anusaar he
 This proportion of Buddhists is higher than that of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains
 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar baudhon ke bich ladakiyon or ladakon kaa ling anupaat 942 he, hindu daliton ke 938 ke mukaable ke anusaar yah adhik hai
 This sex ratio is much higher than Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains
 yah hindu dalit pariwaron ke saath tulana main he ki ladakiyon ko baudhon ke bich behatar dekhbhaal or sangrakshan mila hai
 The literacy rate of Buddhist followers is 72
7 percent, which is much higher than Hindu Dalits

 While it is less than Jains
 jain mahila sakshartaa dar 90% he
 The rate for Buddhists is the highest at 40

 This proves that Buddhism is more employed than Hindu Dalits

 This title is associated with the names of many famous women in India, for example "habba Khatoon" was a famous poetess of Kashmiri language
 "khatun" main 'kh' kii dhwani kaa uccharan 'kha' se thodaa bhinn hota he
 Although the name "khatoon" was first used by turkish-mongols, it is not actually a word derived from Turkish languages, but is derived from Sogdi, a indo-iranian language spoken in ancient Central Asia

 It marks the Jewish New Year
 isaki utpatti bible se judi he : ek pavitra avasar jo joardaar dhamaakon ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 The term Rosh Hashanah is rabbinical, referring to the beginning of the year
 is tyohaar ke prasang hai : praayshchit, divine faisle ke din kii taiyaari or laabhadaayak saal ke liye prarthana
 This two-day festival is celebrated in Jewish calendar on 1-2 Tishri, which according to the English calendar usually falls in September

 For many years after the non-cooperation movement ended, Mahatma Gandhi kept himself focused on social reforms
 1928 main unhone pun:raajnneeti main pravesh karne kii sochi
 In that year, an all-india campaign was being carried out against the Simon Commission, which was sent from England to investigate the conditions of the colonies, with all white members
 gandhi ji ne swayan is andolan main bhaag nahin liya tha par unhone is andolan ko apana aashirwad diya tha tathaa isi varsh bardoli main hone vaale ek kisaan satyagrah ke saath bhi unhone aisa kiya tha
 In the end of December 1929, the Congress held its annual session in the city of Lahore
 yah adhiveshan do drushtiyon se mahatvapurn tha : jawaharlal nehru kaa adhyaksh ke rup main chunaav jo yuva peedi ko netritv kii chadi saunpane kaa pratik tha or ‘purna swaraj’ athwa purna swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa
 Now the pace of politics had increased once again
 26 JAN 1930 ko vibhinn sthanon par rashtriya dhvaj faharaakar or deshbhakti ke geet gaakar ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaaya gaya
 Gandhiji himself gave clear instructions as to how this day should be celebrated
 unhone kaha ki yadi ;swatantraaa kii udghoshnaa sabhi gaanvon or sabhi shaharon yahan tak ki— acha hoga
 It would be nice if all the places have seminars at the same time
 gandhi ji ne suzav diya ki nagaade petakar paaramparik tirake se sangoshtee ke samay kii ghoshnaa kii jaae
 The celebrations will begin with the hoisting of the national flag
 din kaa baaki hissaa kisi rachanaatmak kaary main chaahe vah soot katai ho athwa ‘achhuton’ kii seva athwa hinduon va musalamaanon kaa punarmilan athwa nishiddh kaary athwa ye sabhi ek saath karne main vyateet hoga or yah asambhav nahin he
 Those participating in it will take a firm pledge that the Indian people, like others, have an inalienable right to enjoy the freedom and fruits of their hard work and that if any government deprives the people of these rights or suppresses them If it does, then people also have the right to change or eliminate it
 ‘swatantraaa diwas’ manaae jane ke turant baad mahatma gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve british bharat ke sarvaadhik ghrunit kanoonon main se ek, jisane namak ke utpaadan or vikray par rajya ko ekadhikaar de diya he, ko todane ke liye ek yatra kaa netritv karenge
 The issue of salt monopoly which he had selected was another example of Gandhi's skillful prudence
 prayek bhartiya ghar main namak kaa prayog aprihaary tha lekin iske baavjood unhen gharelu prayog ke liye bhi namak banane se roka gaya or is tarah unhen dukaanon se unche daam par namak kharidne ke liye baadhya kiya gaya
 State's monopoly on salt was quite unpopular
 isi ko nishaanaa banaate hue gandhi ji angreji shashan ke khilaaf vyapak asantosh ko sangathitakarne kii soch rahe the
 Most of the Indians understood the importance of this challenge of Gandhiji but not the British Raj
 haalaanki gandhi ji ne apni ‘namak yatra’ kii purv soochna visarai lard ervin ko de di thi kintu ervin unki is kaarywahi ke mahatv ko na samaj sake
 On 12 March 1930, Gandhiji started walking towards the sea from his ashram in Sabarmati
 teen hafton baad ve apane gantavy sthaan par pahunche
 There he made himself a criminal in the eyes of the law by making a handful of salt
 isi bich desh ke anya bhaagon main samaantar namak yatraayen ayojit kii gai
 Apart from the officially sanctioned national campaign like the Non-cooperation movement, there were numerous streams of protest
 desh ke vishaal bhaag main kisaanon ne damankaaree aupniveshik van kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya jiske kaaran ve or unke maveshi unheen jangalon main nahin ja sakate the jahaan ek jamaane main ve berokatoke ghoomte the
 In some towns, factory workers went on strike, lawyers boycotted British courts and students refused to study in government educational institutions
 1920-22 kii tarah is baar bhi gandhi ji ke aahvaan ne tamaam bhartiya virgon ko aupniveshik shashan ke viruddh apana asantosh vyakt karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In response, the government started arresting dissidents
 namak satyagrah ke silsile main lagbhag 60,000 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Gandhiji was also among those who were arrested
 samudr tat kii ore gandhi ji kii yatra kii pragati kaa pataa unki gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye tainaat police afasaron dwaara bheji gai gopneey repot se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In these reports, Gandhiji's speeches are also given in the villages of the road in which he called upon the local authorities to leave government jobs and join the freedom struggle
 vasana naamak gaanv main gandhi ji ne unchi jati waalon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki yadi aap swaraj ke haq main aawaaj uthaate hai to aapako achhuton kii seva kerani padegi
 You will not get swaraj only by the abolition of salt tax or other taxes
 swaraj ke liye aapako apni un galtiyon kaa praayshchit karnaa hoga jo aapane achhuton ke saath kii hai
 For Swaraj, all Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Sikhs will have to unite
 ye swaraj kii seedhiyaan hai
 Fpulis' spies wrote in their report that women and men of all castes are attending Gandhiji's meetings
 unka kahana tha ki hajaaron walantier rashtravaadi uddeshy ke liye saamne aa rahe hai
 Many of them were government officials who resigned their posts in colonial rule
 sarkaar ko bheji apni report main jila police suparintendent ;police adheekshak ne likhaa tha ki fshri gandhi shant or nishcint dikhaai die
 As they are advancing, their strength is increasing
 namak yatra kii pragati ko ek or baat se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 American news magazine Time used to laugh at Gandhiji's stature
 patrika ne unke takue jaise shariray or makadi jaise pairo kaa khub majaak udaaya tha
 In his first report about this journey, Time had expressed his deep doubts on reaching the destination of the Salt Yatra
 usne daawa kiya ki duusare din paidal chalane ke baad gandhi ji jameen par pasar gaye the
 The magazine did not believe that there was any strength left to go further in the body of this saintly monk
 lekin ek raat main hi patrika kii soch badal gai
 Time wrote that the huge public support that this journey is receiving has made the British rulers restless
 ab ve bhi gandhi ji ko aisa sadhu or jananetaa kah kar salaami dene lage hai jo isai dhirmaavalambiyon ke khilaaf isai tareekon kaa hi hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kar rahaa he
 The salt trip was notable for at least three reasons
 pehla, yahi vah ghatana thi jiske chalate mahatma gandhi duniya kii najar main aae
 The trip was given extensive coverage by the European and American press
 duusare, yah pehali rashtravaadi gatividhi thi jisamen auraton ne bhi bad-chadh kar hissaa liya
 Socialist activist Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay explained to Gandhiji that he should not confine his movements to men
 kamaladevi khud un asankhya auraton main se ek thim jinhone namak yaa sharaab kanoonon kaa ulanghan karte hue samuhik girafatari di thi
 The third and perhaps most important reason was that it was due to the Salt Yatra that the British realized that now their rule would not last long and they would have to share power in the Indians

 Abhigyan Shakuntalam is a world-famous drama by Mahakavi Kalidas, which has been translated into almost all foreign languages
 isamen raja dushyant tathaa shakuntala ke pranay, vivaah, virah, pratyaakhyaan tathaa punarmilan kii ek sundar kahani he
 In the legend, Dushyant is realized by Akashvani, but in this drama the poet has made it known by Mudrika
 isaki naatakeeyata, iske sundar cathopakathan, isaki kavy-saundarya se bhari upmaayen or sthaan-sthaan par prayukt hui samyochit sukhtiyaan; or in sabase badhkar vividh prasangon kii dhvanyaatmakataa itani adbhut he ki in drushtiyon se dekhne par sanskrit ke bhi anya naatak abhigyaan shaakuntal se takkar nahin le sakate; phir anya bhashaaon kaa to kahana hi kya ! to yaheen sabase zyada acha he
 Kalidas did not choose Abhigyan Shakuntal's story as original
 yah katha mahabharat ke adiparv se lee gai he
 Thus the story of Shakuntala is also found in Padmapuran and it is more close to the story of Shakuntala than Mahabharata
 is kaaran vinternitz ne yah mana he ki shakuntala kii katha padmapurana se lee gai he
 But scholars have said that this part of Padmapurana was written after the creation of Shakuntala and later appears projectile
 mahabharat kii katha main durvasa ke shaap kaa ullekh nahin he
 The Mahabharata is very different from Dushyant, if not exactly the opposite
 mahabharat kii shakuntala bhi kalidas kii bhaanti salajj nahin he
 She narrates the story of her birth to Dushyant as a result of Vishwamitra and Maneka's relationship with her mouth
 mahabharat main dushyant shakuntala ke rup par mugdh hokar shakuntala se gandharv vivaah kii prarthana karata he; jis par shakuntala kahati he ki main vivaah is shart par kar sakati hum ki rajsinghaasana mere putr ko hi mili
 Dushyant at that time accepts and later returns to his capital and does not deliberately accept the shameful Shakuntala
 kalidas ne is prakaar aprishkrut rup main praapt hui katha ko apni kalpana se adbhut rup main nikhaar diya he
 By imagining the curse of Durvasa, he elevated the character of Dushyanta
 kalidas kii shakuntala bhi abhijatya, saundarya or karunaa kii murti he
 Apart from this, the manner in which Kalidas has performed the whole story, portraying emotions, etc
 is original and unique
 shakuntla raja dushyant kii patni thi jo bharat ke suprasiddh raja bharat kii mata or menka apsara kii kanya thi
 It is written in the Mahabharata that Shankutla was born from the womb of Maneka Apsara, who left it in the forest
 van main shankuton aadi ne hinsak pashuon se isaki raksha kii thi, isi se iskaa naam shakuntla padaa
 Kanva Rishi brought it out of the forest and kept it like a girl, keeping it in her ashram
 ek baar raja dushyant apane saath kuch sainikon ko lekar shikaar khilne nikle or ghoomte phirte kanv rishi ke ashram main pahunche
 The sage was not present there at that time; With this, the young woman Shakuntala welcomed King Dushyant
 usee avasar par donon main prem or phir gandharva vivaah ho gaya
 a few days later King Dushyant left his kingdom from there
 kanv muni jab lautakar aae, tab yah jaanakar bahut prasann hue ki shakuntla kaa vivaah dushyant se ho gaya
 Shakuntala was pregnant at that time
 samay paakar uske garbh se bahut hi balvan or tejasvi putr utpann hua, jiskaa naam 'bharat' rakhaa gaya
 It is said that the name 'bharat' was named after 'bharat'
 kuch dinon baad shakuntla apane putr ko lekar dushyant ke darbar main pahaunchi
 But Shakuntala had got the curse of Durvasa Rishi in the middle
 raja ne ise bilkul nahin pahachaanaa or spasht kah diya ki na to main tumhen jaanata hoon or na tumhen apane yahan aashray de saktaa hoon
 But on this occasion there was an All India Radio, which informed the king that this is my wife and this son is also mine
 unhen kanv muni ke ashram kii sab baaten samaran ho ain or unhone shakuntla ko apni pradhan rani banaakar apane yahan rakh liya
 'abhigyan Shakuntalam' mentions many touching episodes
 ek us samay, jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa pratham milan hota he
 Secondly, when Kanva leaves Shakuntala from her ashram for her husband's house
 us samay to swayan rishi kehete hai ki mere jaise rishi ko apni paalita kanya main yah moh he to jinaki oras putriyaan patigrih ke liye vidaa hoti hai us samay unki kya sthiti hoti hogi
 The third episode is Shakuntala's presence at Dushyant's meeting and Dushyant's refusal to recognize her
 chauthaa prasang he us samay kaa, jab machuaare ko praapt dushyant ke naam vaali anguthi usko dikhaai jaati he
 And the fifth episode of the union of dushyant-shakuntala in the ashram of Maarishi Maharishi
 shakuntala main kalidas kaa sabase bada chamatkaar uske dhvanyatmak sanketon main he
 In this, the poet has had a unique success in that he did not use any object anywhere
 koi bhi paatr, koi bhi cathope-kathan, koi bhi ghatana, koi bhi prakritik drishy nishprayojan nahin he
 All the events give a miraculous indication of the events ahead
 naatak ke prarambh main hi greeshm-varnan karte hue van-vaayu ke patal kii sugandhi se milakar sugandhit ho uthne or chaaya main letate hi neend aane lagane or diwas kaa ant romantic hone ke dwaara naatak kii katha-vastu kii mote taur par soochna de di gai he, jo kramshah pehle shakuntala or dushyant ke milan, uske baad neend-prabhaav se shakuntala ko bhul jane or naatak kaa ant sukhad hone kii suchak he
 Similarly, the initial song of the play by the illusors kissing the flowers of Shirish a little bit indicates that Dushyant and Shakuntala's union would be short-lived
 jab raja dhanush par baan chadaaye harin ke peeche daude ja rahe hai, tabhi kuch tapasvi aakar rokte hai
 It is said - 'maharaj' this is the stag of the ashram, do not shoot arrows at it
 ’ yahaan harin ke atirikt shakuntala kii ore bhi sanket he, jo harin ke samaan hi bholi-bhali or asahaay he
 'whereas the very fickle life of the stag and the hard arrow like your thunderbolt!' It also has a poignant indication of Shakuntala's helplessness and simplicity and the ruthlessness of the king
 jab dushyant or shakuntala kaa prem kuch or badhane lagata he, tabhi nepathy se pukaar sunai padati he ki ‘tapasviyo, ashram ke praaniyon kii raksha ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 The hunter king Dushyant has come here
 ’ isamen bhi dushyant ke haathon se shakuntala kii raksha kii ore sanket kiya gaya prathit hota he, parantu yah sanket kisi ke bhi kaan main sunai nahin diya; shakuntala ko kisi ne nahin bachaaya
 This increases the compassion of the situation even more
 chauthe ank ke praarambhik bhaag main kanv ke shishy ne prabhaat kaa varnan karte hue sukh or dukh ke nirantar saath lage rahane kaa tathaa priy ke viyog main striyon ke asay dukh kaa jo ullekh kiya he, vah dushyant dwaara shakuntala kaa parityag kiye jane ke liye pehle se hi prishthbhumi-si bana detaa he
 In the fifth issue, Rani Hanspadika sings a song, in which the king is praised for his sweet-heartedness
 dushyant bhi yah sweekaar karte hai ki unhone hansapadika se ek hi baar prem kiya he
 This gives the poet a serious indication that even though Shakuntala was forgotten by Dushyant because of Durvasa's curse, it was not new for him to ignore the queens once they were in love
 anya raniyaan bhi uski is madhukar-vritti kaa shikaar thim
 The incident of Shakuntala's abandonment seems even more cruel and harsh in the backdrop of this song from Hansapadika
 isi prakaar ke dhvanyatmak sanketon se kalidas ne saatven ank main dushyant, shakuntala or uske putr ke milane ke liye sukhad prishthbhumi taiyaar kar di he
 Indra King confers uncommon respect to Dushyant
 uske baad hemkut parvat par prajapati ke ashram main pahunchate hi raja ko anubhav hone lagata he ki jaise vah amrit ke sarovar main snaan kar rahe hon
 After such signs, the union of Dushyant and Shakuntala becomes even more delightful
 german kavi gete ne abhigyaan shaakuntalan ke bare main kaha tha- Similarly, this verse is famous among Sanskrit scholars- iskaa arth he - kavy ke jitne bhi prakaar hai unamem naatak vishesh sundar hota he
 In plays also, Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top in terms of poetry
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 His fourth verse in Abhigyan Shakuntalam and fourth verse in this issue is very delightful
 abhigyaan shaakuntal main naatakeeyata ke saath-saath kavy kaa ansh bhi yathesht maatra main he
 Shringar is the main juice in it; And its coincidence and disconnection have matured beautifully on both sides
 iske atirikt hasya, vir tathaa karun ras kii bhi jahaan-tahaan acchhee abhivyakti hui he
 Beautiful and enchanting expectations from place to place not only amazes the reader, but also helps in increasing the intensity of the desired emotion
 saare naatak main kalidas ne apni upamaaon or utprekshaon kaa upyog kahin bhi keval alankaar-pradarshan ke liye nahin kiya
 Their simile or catalysis at each place has helped in making the expression of meaning juicy
 kalidas apni upamaaon ke liye sanskrit-sahitya main prasiddh hai
 In Shakuntal too, his power to choose the appropriate simile was well known
 shakuntala ke vishay main ek jagah raja dushyant kehete hai ki ‘vah aisa phool he, jise kisi ne suungha nahin he; aisa navpallav he, jis par kisi ke nakhon kii kharonch nahin lagi; aisa ratna he, jisamen chhed nahin kiya gaya or aisa madhu he, jiskaa swaad kisi ne chakhaa nahin he
 'through these similes, a unique glimpse of Shakuntala's beauty comes before our eyes
 isi prakaar paanchaven ank main dushyant shakuntala kaa parityag karte hue kehete hai ki ‘he tapaswini, kya tum vaise hi apane kul ko kalankit karnaa or mujhe patit karnaa chaahati ho, jaise tat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi tat ke vriksh ko to giraati hi he or apane jal ko bhi malin kar leti he
 'upma, given here by the river flowing through the river of Shakuntala, is particularly helpful in expressing the king's mood
 isi prakaar jab kanv ke shishy shakuntala ko saath lekar dushyant ke paas pahunchate hai to dushyant kii drushti un tapasviyon ke bich main shakuntala ke upar jaakar padati he
 By not giving a detailed description of Shakuntala's beauty there, the poet has only said to her mouth that 'who is that veiled beauty among these ascetics, which looks like a new spring in the midst of yellow leaves
 ’ is choti-si upama ne pile pattey or konpal kii sadrishyata ke dwaara shakuntala ke soundarya kaa puraa hi chitrankan kar diya he
 Similarly, looking at Sarvadamana, Dushyant says that 'this majestic child appears like the fire that is burning, looking for fuel to become a blazing fire
 ’ is upama se kalidas ne na keval balak kii tejaswita prakat kar di, balki yah bhi spasht rup se suchit kar diya he ki yah balak bada hokar mahapratapi chakravarti samraat banegaa
 Many examples of such delightful similes can be given from Shakuntal because 180 similes have been used in Shakuntal
 or unamem se sabhi ek se ek badhkar hai
 It is fine that Kalidas had special skill in the choice of Upma and it is also true that some of his beautiful analogies are rare in the compositions of other poets, yet Kalidasa's biggest feature is not upma-kaushal
 upama-kaushal to unke kavy-kaushal kaa ek saamaanya-sa ang he
 Kalidas knows many methods to express his mood or to perfect a rasa or to awaken the intense feeling of an emotion
 shabdon kaa prasangochit chayan, abhisht bhav ke upyukt chand kaa chunaav or vyanjana-shakti kaa prayog karke kalidas ne apni style ko vishesh rup se romantic bana diya he
 Where Kalidas has descended on Shakuntala's aesthetic narrative, he has not satisfied by merely drawing the form of Shakuntala by similes and incantations
 pehle-pehle to unhone keval itnaa kahalwaya ki ‘yadi tapovana ke nivaasiyon main itnaa rup he, to samajho ki van-lataaon ne udyaan kii lataaon ko maat kar diya
 Then he told Dushyant's face that 'it is like to plant such a beautiful girl in the rules of the ashram, like cutting the acacia tree from the petals of Neel Kamal
 ’ uske baad kalidas kehete hai ki ‘shakuntala kaa rup aisa manohar he ki bhale hi usne motaa valkal vastra pahana hua he, phir usase bhi uskaa saundarya kuch gata nahin, balki badha hi he
 Because whatever is given to a beautiful person becomes his ornament
 ’ uske baad raja shakuntala kii sukumaar deh kii tulana hari-bhari phulon se ladi lata ke saath karte hai, jisase us vilakshan saudarya kaa swaroop pathak kii ankhon ke saamne chitrit-sa ho uthta he
 After this, Kalidasa has brought a bhramar to bring that beauty to the climax; Who considers the face of Shakuntala as a beautiful blossoming flower and hovers over it to make it juicy
 is prakaar kalidas ne shakuntala ke saundarya ko chitrit karne ke liye anlakaaron kaa sahaara utana nahin liya, jitna ki vyanjanashkti kaa; or yah vyajana-shakti hi kavy kii jaan maani jaati he

 a color indicator is a simple number from which to color an object
 khagolashastra main kisi taare ke rang or uske tapamaap main gaharaa sambandh hota he, isliye usamen kisi taare ke rang suchak se uske taapmaana kaa pataa chalata he
 To measure the color indicator of an object, its brightness is measured by looking at it with two different light-filters
 kuch filter is prakaar hai: Color indicators like u – B, b – v and v – r are defined on the basis of these
 taare ke liye rang suchak jitna chota ho, tara utana hi nila or utana hi adhik garm hota he
 If a star's color indicator is large, the star is as red and equally cold
 hamaare suraj kaa B–V rang suchak 0
656 ± 0
005 he or yah pile-se rang kaa he, jabaki rajanya taare kaa B–V rang suchak –0

 If the magnitudes measured from the b and v filters of the state star are observed, then its b magnitude is 0

 dhyaan rahe ki magnitude ek aisa ulta maap he jo jitna zyaada ho chamak utani hi kam hoti he

 lekin bahot se sunni inhen "shiya" yaa "shiyane ali" nahin balki "rafazi" naam se bulaate hai ! According to this religious ideology, Hazrat Ali, who was both a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad Saheb, was the real heir of Hazrat Muhammad Saheb and should have become the first Khalifa
 yadhyapi aisa hua nahin or unako teen or logon ke baad caliph, yani pradhan netaa, banaaya gaya
 Ali and then his descendants should have become the chief of Islam, a Shia who believes so
 sunni musalmaan maanate hai ki hazarat ali sahit pehle chaar khaliph satpathi the jabaki shiya musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki pehle teen khaliph islam ke gaiyr-vaazib pradhan the or ve hazarat ali se hi imaamon kii ginati aarambh karte hai or is ginati main caliph shabd kaa prayog nahin karte
 Sunni Muslims also consider Ali as the Khalifa and Khalifa Yajid, who killed his son Hussain, is called a misguided Muslim in many places
 is sampradaay ke anuyaayiyon kaa bahumat mukhya rup se iraan,iraq,bahrain or azarbaijan main rahete hai
 Apart from this, Syria, Kuwait, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Oman, Yemen and India also have Shia population as a major minority
 shiya islam ke vishwaas ke teen upkhand hai - barahwaree, ismaili or zadi
 In a famous hadith Munkunto Maula Fah Ja Ali Un Maula, which Muhammad Sahab had opened on his last hajj at a place called Ghadir, the Muslim community had to follow the community's dictum
 san 632 main muhammd sahab ne apane aakhri haj main khumm sarovar ke nikat apane saathiyon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 According to Shia faith, he made his son-in-law Ali his heir in this title
 sunni is ghatana ko ali kii prashansa maatr maanate he or vishwaas rakhte hai ki unhone hazarat ali ko caliph niyukt nahin kiya
 Differences between the two sides begin about this
 haj ke baad mohammad sahab biimaar rahane lage
 He called all the big sahabis and said, give me a pen claim that i should write such a statement that if you don't stumble, Omar said that he is saying hejyaan and did not let it
 shiya itihaas ke anusaar jab pigambar sahab kii mrityu kaa samachar mila to bhi ye waapas na aakar sakipha main sabha karne lage ki ab kya karnaa chaiye
 At the time when Hazrat Muhammad died, Ali and some of his other friends were engaged in burying Muhammad saheb, Abu Bakr went to Medina and discussed for Khilafat
 madina ke kai log abu bakar ko khalipha banane par sahamat ho gayi
 According to Shia beliefs, Mohammad Saheb and Ali's clan i
e
 Hashim Ali wanted to make Khalifa only
 par islam ke ab tak ke sabase bade samrajya ke vaaris ke liye musalamaanon main ekajutata nahin rahi
 According to many, Ali, who was the cousin of Muhammad Saheb and son-in-law, was also the real heir of Muhammad Saheb
 parantu abu baqar pehle khalipha banaaye gayi or unke marane ke baad umr ko caliph banaaya gaya
 This caused more fury among the supporters of Ali, but Ali remained silent for the good of the Muslims
 umr ke baad tisare khaliph osman bane
 But during his time, the Shia Rafazi rebels came from Egypt and Iraq and other places in Medina and surrounded Osman's house for 40 days and finally besieged Usman's house
 osman bin afphan ko jab shahid kiya gaya tab unki umr 79 thi, unhen sar main baar baar waar kar ke maaraa gaya unki patni unako bachaane bich aayi isse unki oongali cat gayi, baghi unke ghar main peeche kii taraf se andar aaye ,saamne ke taraf hazarat ali ke donon bete hossain ibne ali or hasan ibne ali ,rakhwali kar rahe the ! The Caliphate was now vacant again and the Islamic empire was growing
 musalamaanon ko hazarat ali ke alaava koi na dikhaa par ali khaliph banane ko na maane
 On some days the people of Shura could not fill the post of Khalifa
 ant main ali ko vivash kiya gaya to aap ne kaha ki mere khilaafat main ilaahi nizaam chalegaa
 He was appointed the fourth Khalifa
 ali apane insaaf ke liye mashhoor the ,ali ke khalipha banane par purv khalipha osman ke kaatilo kaa badla lene or unako sajaa dene kii maang uthne lagi lekin vakht or musalamaanon ke halaat dekh kar ali ne us vakht koi kadam nahin uthaaya par logo ko ye na raas aayaa to unhone osman ke kaatilo ko sajaa dilwane ke fouz ikkthi kii
 Ali said Usman's Katillo would be punished, but his purpose was something else, so there was a war called Jamal
 kuch samay baad syria ke soobedaar muavia ne bhi ali kaa virodh kiya
 Mu'awiya was a relative of the third Khalifa Usman and the demand for the punishment of Katilo of the same Usman led to a battle in Siffin, in which Mu'awiya also lost
 san 661 main kufa main ek masjid main imam ali ko dhoke se shahid kar diya gaya
 After this Mu'awiya declared himself the Caliph of Islam
 hazarat ali or saidhantik rup se mohammad satho sahab ke rishtedaaron ke samarthakon ne unke putr hasan ke prati nishtha dikhaai, lekin kuch unka saath chhod gaye
 Hasan Ibne Ali did not fight, but made a treaty with Mawiya
 asal main ali ke samay main sifphine kii ladaai main maavia khalipha bananaa chahta the par na ban sakaa
 He was the governor of Syria because of the previous caliphs, now he was preparing a large army, now he put the same question in front of Imam Hasan: either war or subjugation
 imam hasan ne adheenta sweekaar nahin kii parantu wo musalamaanon kaa khun bhi nahin bahaanaa chaahate the is kaaran wo yuddh se dur rahe
 Now even if Mavia wanted power in any way, Imam was forced to make a treaty with Hassan
 imam hasan ne apni sharto par usko sirf satta saunpi
 Some of these conditions are: is prakaar kii sharto ke dwaara wo sirf naam maatr kaa shaasha rah gaya
 His dynasty ruled until 750 CE and was called Umayyad
 shiya musalamaanon kii sabhi taharik hazrat mohammad sahab ke baad ali ke chote putr va unki 11 putron ko silsilewar santaanon ko islam kaa uttaradhikari maanate hai
 The first of these comes the name of Imam Hasan Alyssalam, you were the eldest son of Imam Ali, and you followed Khilafat at the age of 47 after Imam Ali
 aap keval 6 maah tak hi khalipha rahe jiske paashchaat aapane mavia se sandhi ke pashchaat rajnatik shashan se tyaag patr de diya magar aap apane anuniyao kaa maarg darshan imam ke sammanit pad ke antargat karte rahe jo aapke paas imam ali acco ke pashchaat aayaa tha
 According to Shia history, Mavia conspired and killed you
 aapke vasiyat ke anusaar aapke pashchaat imam hossain ne aapke pashchaat imam ke pad ko sambhala
 Great story of Karbala is related to you
 aapane jab mavia ke duraachaari putr yajid kaa samarthan karne se jab spasht rup se manaa kar diya tab aapako apane parivaar evam mitron sahit, jo kul 72 kii sankhya main the, 30,000 yaa adhik kii fouj dwaara gher kar shahid kar diya gaya
 Water was closed for 3 days before you and your family
 isi kii yaad main har saal aapke anuyaayi muharram kaa vishwa prasiddh evam pavitra tyohaar manaate he
 In this festival, religious meetings and mourning meetings etc
 are organized
