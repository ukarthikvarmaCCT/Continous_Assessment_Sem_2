 His wife was the history-famous queen Padmini or Padmavati
 1303 i0 main allaudin khilji ke akraman se parivaar tathaa shashan sahit ye bhi nasht ho gayi
 After the rule of only one year and with the end of his dynasty, his name was lost in the stories of the bhatan-bardan
 yahan tak ki inhen sroton par mukhyatah aadhaarit hone ke kaaran karnal tod ke suprasiddh rajasthan ke itihaas sambandhi granth main bhi inkaa naam tak nahin diya gaya he
 In his place, his wife Rani Padmini's relationship with Bhimsingh has been very misleading

 Ojha ji has clarified all the misconceptions and truth, writing that "behind Rawal Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh sat on the throne of Chittor
 us ko shashan karte thode hi maheene hue the, itane main dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittod par akraman kar diya or chah maheene se adhik ladane ke anantar usne kila le liya
 Some of Mewar's fame, royalty, epic and Colonel Tod's Rajasthan did not even name Ratnasinh
 summersingh ke baad karan singh kaa raja hona likhaa he, parantu karansingh summersingh ke peeche nahin, kintu usase 8 peedi pehle hua tha
 Muhnot Nainasi writes in his fame that Ratanasi fought against Alauddin in the case of Padmini; But he calls Ratnasinh at one place the son of Samarasi and the son of Ajasi at another and the brother of Bhadlakhamasi, the last of which is not believable, because Lakhmsi was not the son of Ajasi but the father and head of Sisode
 is prakaar ratnasingh lakhamasi kaa bhai nahin kintu mewar kaa swami or summersingh kaa putr tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke vi0 san0 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh or eklingamahatmaya se paaya jaataa he
 It is also written in these two that after Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh became king
 uske maare jane par lakshmanasingh chittod kii raksharth mlecchon kaa sanhaar karata hua apane saat putron sahit maaraa gaya
 " pracheen abhilekh aadi se isse adhik ratnasingh ke sambandh main koi vivaran uplabdh nahin hota he
 Details related to Alauddin Khilji's attack are found in Amir Khusro's 'tithi Alai'
 amir khusro ke ukt granth se pataa chalata he ki sultan allaudin khilji 28 janvari 1303 i0 ko chittod lene ke liye dilli se ravaanaa hua tathaa 26 agast 1303 i0 ko kila fatah ho gaya
 In connection with the invasion of Alauddin Khilji, Mahakavi Malik Muhammad Jayasi has written in his famous epic Padmavat that this attack was to obtain Padmavati, the unique beautiful wife of King Ratansen, and after many years of siege he failed to return to Khilji
 And was victorious by attacking again
 parantu ab aitihaasik tathy saamne aa jane se itihaaskaar maanane lage hai ki akraman kaa pramukh kaaran allaudin kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha evam chittod kii sainik evam vyapaarik upyogita thi
 The commercial routes of Gujarat, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces, Sindh etc
 passed through Chittor
 swaabhaavik he ki allaudin khilji jaisaa mahatvakankshi sultan isko avashya adhikrut karnaa chahta
 It is possible that knowing the beauty of Padmini, one of her aims has also been to achieve it
 kaaran jo bhi ho parantu allaudin ke akraman ne shashan sahit rawal ratnasingh ke jivan ko bhi nasht kar diya tathaa apni bahusankhyak sakhiyon evam anya raniyon ke saath rani padmini johar karke sati ho gayi

 The amplifier can indicate the following - electronix main electrons kaa pravaah hi karant kehalaata he
 We also know that electrons are negatively charged
 iskaa matlab ye he kii jab electones kaa pravaah shuru hota he to electrons ek sthaan se dusre sthaan par jate he
 When an electron leaves a place, there is an absence of negative charge at that place which we can say in a way that there is a positive charge present and that is what we call a hole

 However, in some methods, benign bacteria, such as yeast or fungi, are used to enhance special properties and preserve foods
 Creating and maintaining nutritional value, structure and taste is important to preserve its qualities as a food
 yah saanskrithik rup se ashrith he kyonki jo ek samskruti ke logon ke liye khaane yogya he, vah duusari samskruti ke logon ke liye nahin bhi ho sakati he
 The preservation process typically involves inhibiting the growth of bacterial fungi and other bacteria, as well as slowing the oxidation speed of rotten deodorant-producing fats
 isamen vah prakriya bhi shaamil he jiske tahat bhojan taiyaar karte samay prakritik paripakvan or vivarnataa kaa pravrodh kiya jaataa he, jaise kate hue sebon main pratikriya swaroop pachakaras sambandhi bhuraapan kaa hona

 Common methods of applying these processes include drying, spray drawing, freeze drawing, refrigeration, vacuum-packing, canning, syrup, sugar crystallization and preservation in food irradiation and mixing preservatives or inert gases such as carbon dioxide
 Other methods that not only preserve the food but also enhance its flavor include pickling, adding salt, fuming, preserving in syrup or alcohol, sugar crystallization and curing
 sangrakshan kii prakriya main shaamil hai: One of the oldest methods of food preservation is the drying and preservation of food, which reduces the water activity in it in sufficient quantity, which stops the growth of bacteria or begins to occur late

 Refrigeration is a process used commercially and domestically to preserve a range of diverse foods, including prepared food items that do not require refrigeration in their unopened form
 For example, potato waffles are kept in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cold dark place to ensure several months of storage

 Under vacuum-packing, food is stored in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle
 The vacuum environment cuts off the source of oxygen necessary for bacteria to survive, thus slowing down the decomposition process
 nirvaat-packing kaa prayog aam taur par mewan ke bhandaaran ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he jisase oxikaran ke kaaran swaad ke nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sake
 The process of salting or processing is a process of osmosis to remove moisture from meat
 maance ko namak yaa chini, yaa donon ke sangyojan se sansaadhit kiya jaataa he
 Nitrates and nitrites are often used to process meat and contribute to the characteristic pink color, as well as to restrict Clostridium botulinum
 chini kaa prayog falon ke sangrakshan main kiya jaataa he, yaa to syrup ke rup main jaise seb, naashpati, aadu, khubaani, aalubokhaara yaa crystal rup main jahaan sangrakshit saamagree ko chini main crystaleekaran kii seemaa tak pakaaya jaataa he or falswaroop praapt utpaada ko shushk sangrahit kiya jaataa he
 This method can be used for citrus fruit peels, angelica and ginger
 a modification of this process produces glitter fruits such as glace cherries, in which the fruit is preserved in sugar but is then sold out of the syrup, the preservation process involves the outer coating of the sugar and syrup present in the fruit
 Is maintained by lakjri utpaadon jaise brandi yaa anya nashili peya main falon ke sangrakshan main, chini kaa upyog praayah sharaab ke saath mila kar kiya jaataa he
 It should not be confused with fruit flavored intoxicating drinks such as cherry brandy or sloe gin

 Established in May 1976, it wanted to establish an independent Tamil state in north and eastern Sri Lanka by launching a violent separatist campaign

 The Tigers, while at the peak of their development, developed an army contingent

 He killed many people like the high-ranking 'sri Lankan' people and Indian politician Rajiv Gandhi
 He also invented the suicide belt and suicide bombings as a strategy

 During this conflict, the Tamil Tigers repeatedly exchanged rights over the control area with north-eastern Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan army after fierce opposition in the process

 After the peace process failed in 2006, Sri Lankan troops started a major offensive against the Tigers, defeating the LTTE and bringing the entire country under their control
 Their victory over the Tigers was declared by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajpaksa on 16 May 2009 and the LTTE conceded defeat on 17 May 2009
 vidrohi netaa prabhakaran baad main sarkari sena dwaara 19 may ko maare gaye the
 The LTTE launched its first major attack on 23 July 1983 on the transport of a Sri Lankan army contingent outside Jaffna

 Initially, the LTTE was run in collaboration with other Tamil militant groups whose objectives were similar, later formally joining a common terrorist front in April 1984, the Eelam National Liberation Front, a union between the LTTE, Tamil Eelam Mukti Sangathan, Eelam Revolutionary Students Organization, People's Liberation Organization Tamil Eelam and Revolutionary Eelam People's Liberation Front

 The LTTE condemned the telo's approach and said that India was acting only in its own interest
 iske parinamswarup 1986 main, littey ENLF se alag ho gaya
 This led to conflict between the TELO and the LTTE for the next few months
 Almost the entire TELO leadership and TELO militants were killed by the LTTE
 littey ne kuch maheenon baad EPRLF par hamalaa kiya or jafana prayadweep se hat jane ko majaboor kiya
 The LTTE then demanded all the remaining Tamil rebels to join the LTTE
 The notifications were then released in Jaffna, Madras, India, where the Tamil groups were headquartered
 With the withdrawal of the main contingent TELO and EPRLF, the remaining Tamil rebel groups, numbering around 20, were included in the LTTE
 unhone jafana ko littey kaa ek prabhavi kshetra banaaya
 Another practice that increased the support of the Tamil people was the pledge by the LTTE to establish a new state for Sri Lankan Tamils
 1987 main, littey ne blike tiger kii sthapana kii, jo littey kaa ek aisa dal tha jo raajnneetik, aarthik or sainya lakshyon ke khilaaf aatmghaatee hamalon ke liye jimmedaar tha, ne sabase pehle srilanka sena ke shivi ke khilaaf apana pehla aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya jisamen 40 sainik maare gaye
 In 1987, along with the influx of refugees, the Tamils faced growing anger, India intervened directly and poured food parcels over Jaffna
 After subsequent negotiations, India and Sri Lanka negotiated with India and Sri Lanka adopted the agreement
 Although the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed the peace agreement, while both these sides were defeated
 Was signed

 Although the agreement was signed between the governments of Sri Lanka and India, and Tamil militant groups had no role in the agreement, most Tamil militant groups accepted it
 lekin littey ne samjhaute ko asweekaar kar diya, ve un logon ke virdohi the jo EPRLF ke sadsy the or jo uttari or purvi praanton ke sanyukt mukhya prashasnic adhikari the
 The LTTE thus engaged in a military conflict with the Indian Army, attacking it for the first time on an Indian Army ration truck on 8 October, killing five Indian paramilitary commandos on board with burning tires around their necks
 The Indian government then decided that the IPKF would defeat the LTTE army
 The Indian Army signed a long month-long campaign on the LTTE, including Operation Pawan, to gain control of the LTTE on the Jaffna peninsula
 is abhiyaan kii nishthurataa or bhartiya sena ke littey virdohi aaparishan se yah srilanka main kai tamilon ke bich behad alokapriy ho gaya
 Indian intervention among the Sinhalese majority also became unpopular, the IPKF got badly into it and suffered heavy losses in more than 2 years of fighting with the Tamil Tigers
 The last member of the IPKF, whose count is believed to be more than 50,000 , Left the country in 1990 at the request of the Sri Lankan government
 ek asthir shanti sarkaar or littey ke bich main chalati rahi baad main yojit shanti vaarta ne desh ke uttar or purv main tamilon ko pragati kii ore le gaya
 The fighting continued unabated in the 1990s and marked two major killings, one in 1991 by former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993, using suicide bombers on both occasions
 yah ladaai 1994 main thodi der ke liye rukii jab srilanka ke raashtrapati ke rup main chandrika kumarathunga kaa chunaav hua or shanti vaarta sampann hua
 But the fight resumed when the LTTE sank two Sri Lankan naval boats in April 1995
 sainya gatividhiyon kii shrunkhala main shri lanka sena ne jafana prayadweep par kabja kar liya jo tamilon kaa praan tha
 Many such attacks took place over the next three years, then later the army occupied the northern LTTE province, including the Vanni region, Kilinochchi and several smaller towns
 haalanki, 1998 ke baad se littey ne in kshetron par phir se niyantran praapt kar liya
 a strategy after a prolonged battle with the Sri Lankan army led to the capture of an important province at the entrance of the Jaffna peninsula called Elephant Pass Base Complex in April 2000

 It is believed that he wanted to distance Prabhakaran from the leadership of the LTTE in collaboration with the Indian Research and Analysis Wing

 After the electoral defeat of Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickramasinghe came to power in December 2001, the LTTE declared a unilateral ceasefire
 The Sri Lankan government agreed to a cease-fire
 In March 2002, both sides officially signed a ceasefire agreement
 As a part of the deal, Norway and other Nordic countries agreed to jointly monitor the ceasefire through the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission

 Although the LTTE claimed that the people under their control were free to vote, they threatened and prevented people from voting
 The United States condemned this act

 The LTTE leadership accused him that he was misusing funds and also questioned him about his personal behavior
 They tried to control the ltte-controlled eastern province, which led to a conflict between the TEMVP and the LTTE
 The LTTE also suggested that the TEMVP was supported by the government and the Nordic SLMM monitor also confirmed this

 UN secretary-general Baan Ki-moon appealed to the LTTE not to hold children as hostages, not to be selected as child soldiers or to cause any harm
 Claude Heller, United Nations Security Council's Claude Heller, said that 'we demand that the LTTE immediately surrender arms, abandon terrorism, assist in the evacuation of remaining civilians in the area of UN conflict and engage in the political process Ho
 The chairman of this council of 15 members said on behalf of everyone that 'they strongly condemn the LTTE, it is a terrorist organization which is not allowing citizens to leave the territory using it as a human shield

 The Black Tigers were the group that first killed prominent politicians
 It is believed that it carried out around 100-200 missions which proved to be very deadly
 All LTTE enemies, including men and women, were attacked so that they could control their areas in advance
 haalanki littey kaa ek sainya dal ke rup main gathan kiya gaya tha par baad main vah ek vaastavik shashan main badal gaya
 The LTTE placed its control to the north of the island, particularly the areas surrounding the cities of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu
 littey ne ek nyaayik pranali ko lagu kiya jo ki adaalaton ko aapraadhik or asainik maamalon kaa nirnay lene ke liye tha
 The Tamil Eelam judicial system consisted of the District Court, High Court, Supreme Court and Court of Appeal

 These two high courts handled criminal cases like rape, murder, treason and arson

 Police stations were established in all areas controlled by the LTTE
 littey ne yah daawa kiya ki unke police dal ke kaaran hi aparaadhon kaa dar kam rahaa he
 Critics believe that the police force is a unified force of the LTTE armed force and that the reduction of the crime rate was a result of the ltte's authoritarian rules
 haalanki, yah baat har koi jaanata he ki littey dwaara niyantrit sthanon par police bal or nyaayik pranali ucch str par the
 Another administrative duty of the LTTE was social welfare

 In 1984, an all-party women's unit of the LTTE was established called Freedom Birds

 As a result, the LTTE became the first militant group of Tamils to train women on the battlefield

 Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from the ethical questions arising from their main functions

 Another concern is that sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other harmful business practices
