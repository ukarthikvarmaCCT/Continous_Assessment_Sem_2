 Shringar and Shanta are the predominance of juices
 shringaar ke donon pakshon kaa bhaaratendu ji ne sundar varnan kiya he
 There is also an excellent scheme of humor in his poetry
 bhaaratendu ji ne apane samay main prachlit praayah sabhi chhandon ko apanaaya he
 He has given verses in Urdu, Sanskrit, Bangla language not only in Hindi
 unke kavy main sanskrit ke basant tilka, shardool, vikreedit, shalini aadi hindi ke chaupai, chappay, rola, soratha, kundaliyaan kavitt, savaiya ghanaachari aadi, bangala ke payaar tathaa urdu ke rekhta, ghazal chhandon kaa prayog hua he
 Apart from these, Bharatendu ji has also introduced folk verses like Kajali, Thumri, Lavani, Malhar, Chaiti etc
 alankaaron kaa prayog bhaaratendu ji ke kavy main sahaj rup se hua he
 Bharatendu ji is more interested in upma, catalyst, metaphor and skepticism
 shabdalankaron ko bhi sthaan mila he
 In the following lines, the scheme of catalysis and alliteration ornamentation is clearly visible: aadhunik hindi sahitya main bhaaratendu ji kaa atyant mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharatendu was a master of multifaceted talent
 kavita, kahani, naatak, upanyaas, niabandh aadi sabhi kshetron main unki dein apurv he
 Bharatendu ji appeared in Hindi with the message of Nav Jagran
 unhone hindi ke sarvangin vikaas main mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 By incorporating novelty and originality in sentiment, language and style, they made them conform to the modern period
 aadhunik hindi ke ve janmdata maane jate hai
 The plays of Hindi were also originated by him
 bhaaratendu ji apane samay ke saahitiyik netaa the
 Many talented writers were born to them
 matra-bhashaa kii seva main unhone apana jivan hi nahin sampurna dhan bhi arpit kar diya
 His main theme was the advancement of Hindi language
 1882 main shiksha ayog ke samaksh apni gavaahi main hindi ko nyaayalayon kii bhashaa banane kii mahatta par unhone kaha- In this context, in 1868, he wrote a satirical poem from 'urdu Ka Sipa' Naam- apni inhen kaaryon ke kaaran bharatendu hindi saahityakaash ke ek daidipyaman nakshatra ban gaye or unka yug bharatendu yug ke naam se prasiddh hua
 Publications such as Harishchandra Chandrika, Kavikavasudha, Harishchandra Magazine, Stree Bala Bodhini reveal his thoughtful and progressive editorial approach
 bharatendu kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaary yah he ki unhone hindi sahitya ko, or uske saath samaaj ko samrajya-virdohi disha main badhane kii prerana di
 In 1870, when he wrote an article titled 'levi Pran Levi', aiming at Lord Mayo, in Kavibhasudha, a new anti-imperial consciousness began to spread in Hindi literature
 6 july 1874 ko kavivachansudha main likhaa ki jis prakaar america upniveshit hokar swatantra hua usee prakaar bharat bhi swatantrata laabh kar saktaa he
 He established a Tadiya society whose members pledged to treat indigenous goods and boycott foreign goods
 bharatendu ne vilayati kapadon ke bahishkaar kii apil karte hue swadeshi kaa jo pratigya patr 23 march, 1874 ke 'kavivachansudha' main prakashit kiya, vah samooche hindi samaaj kaa pratigya patr ban gaya
 Bharatendu said in that, sabase pehle bharatendu harishchandra ne hi sahitya main jan bhaawanaaon or aakankshaon ko swar diya tha
 For the first time, Bhartendu incorporated 'jan' in literature
 unke pehle kavy main reetikalin pravritiyon kaa hi bolbalaa tha
 Literature had become the fountainhead of the decadent feudal culture, but Bharatendu made literature a means of portraying and opposing the poverty, subjugation, inhuman exploitation of foreign rulers
 apane naatakon, kavitt, mukariyon or prahasanon ke madhyam se unhone angreji raaj par kataaksh or prahaar kiye, jiske chalate unhen angrejon kaa kopbhaajan bhi bananaa padaa
 Bharatendu understood the exploitation system of the British very well
 apni patrika kavivachansudha main unhone likhaa tha – Not only this, Bhartendu understood this form of exploitation long before Dadabhai Naoroji introduced the theory of Drain of Wealth in the beginning of 20th century
 unhone likhaa tha – The British carry India's wealth with them and this is the root cause of the poverty and sufferings of the people of the country, this truth was understood by Bharatendu
 kavivachansudha main unhone janata kaa aahvaan kiya tha – Bharatendu's global consciousness was also very intense
 unhen acchhee tarah pataa tha ki vishwa ke koun se desh kaise or kitni unnati kar rahe hai
 Therefore, he gave a very pithy speech at the Dadri fair in Ballia in 1884 on 'how can Bharatvarshanoti be there'
 yah lekh unki atyant pragatisheel soch kaa parichaayak bhi he
 In this, he called upon people to abandon evil practices and superstitions and get good education, develop industries, emphasize cooperation and unity and be self-reliant in all fields
 dadri jaise dharmik or lok meley ke saahitiyik manch se bhaaratendu kaa yah udbodhan agar dekha jaae to aadhunik bhartiya saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik chintan kaa prasthaanbindu he
 See a small part of the speech- vichaaron kii spashtataa or use vinodpriyata ke saath kis tarah prastut kiya ja saktaa he, iskaa yah nibandh bejod udhaaharan he
 See, how Bharatendu expresses India's concern in this essay, vastav main unka yah lekh bharat durdasha naamak unke naatak kaa ek tarah se vaicharik vistaar he
 In India's predicament, he says, bharatendu acchhee tarah samaj chuke the ki 'angreji shashan bharatiyon ke laabh ke liye he' yah purnatah khokhla daawa tha or dushprachaar tha
 Bharatendu gave an indication of how the British were looting the wealth of India, in his commentary in the March 7, 1874 issue of 'kavikavasudha', bharatendu stri-purush kii samanta ke itane bade pairokaar the ki 'kavivachansudha' ke 3 november, 1873 ke ank main unhone likhaa, Falundica is a part of the human's throat
 yah ek prakaar kaa utak hai jo bahari rogaanuon se akraman ke viruddh pehali raksha-pankti kii tarah kaam karata he
 The throat is an important part of our body
 iskaa mahatv isi baat se spasht he ki sharir ke bheetar pahunchane vaale khaadya−padaarth tathaa hawa−pani ke pravesh kaa daayitv isi par he
 Due to performing this important work, this part is first affected by any poisonous elements present in food, water and air
 naak or kaan bhi isse achoote nahin rahete
 Although looking outward, our nose, throat and ears are seen separately, but inside the throat, the cells of these three organs merge together
 is kaaran in teenon angon main se kisi ek bhi ang main kisi prakaar kaa sankraman ho jaataa he to uskaa prabhaav teenon angon par padataa he
 For this reason, it is important that any infection is treated quickly
 bahari vaataavaran main upasthit kisi bhi jahrile tatv ke sankraman se in angon ko bachaane ke liye prakruti ne mukh tathaa gale kii sanrachana is prakaar kii he ki un jahrile tatwon ko hamaare munh ke andruni tantra par koi prabhaav na pade
 Nose and mouth appear only as a whole organ when seen in external form, their separate parts are not visible
 parantu vastav main yah ang kai hisson main bante hote hai
 Although the nitcalcavity marantz and natalchapter appear to be different in view, but in the back they are joined together in a cavity called 'oroferringles'
 oropherigles ke upar naak ke peeche ke bhaag ko 'lejopheringles' kehete hai
 The cause of tonsil problem can be any type of infection or infection that is entering our body through the mouth and nose
 ye pradooshan yaa infections viral yaa bacterial kisi bhi prakaar ke pradooshak se dooshit hawa saans ke madhyam se jab sharir main pravesh kar jaati he to yah turant samasya paidaa kar sakati he
 In places where the atmosphere contains stink, dampness and any other chemical element, in such places due to continuous exposure to poisonous elements through air, the problem of tonsil disease can arise
 bacchon main is rog ke zyada maamle drushtigat hote hai kyonki unki rog pratirohak kshamta kam hoti he
 It is not that this problem can be seen in older people who cannot suffer from it
 tonsillitis is rog kii ek khatarnaak avasthaa hoti he kyonki sharir main antibadis hone ke kaaran pratikriya hoti rahati he
 In this state, as soon as the antigen enters our body, the tonsil tissue starts to fight it
 The antigen produced by it reacts with the proteins present in other parts of the body and makes similar antibodies there
 in antibadis kaa dil ke volve par sidhaa prabhaav padataa he tathaa dil ke volve kharaab hone kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa he
 Tonsil happens mostly to children, but its side effects can occur at any age
 bachapan main gale ke sankraman kaa uchit upachaar na hona bhi hamaare desh main dil kii bimariyon kaa ek kaaran he
 In addition, tonsils can also cause diseases such as barrafangil's apishish, neutrafringel's apache
 sharir kii yantric sanrachana main vifaille tatwon ko gadabadi ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali is samasya kii pahchaan kuch praarambhik lakshan dekhakar kii ja sakati he jaise− baar-baar galaa kharaab hona, gale main sujan hona, dard hona, baar−baar bukhaar aana aadi
 If such symptoms are occurring again and again to the patient
 jaise ek varsh main paanch yaa chah baar to use tonsil kaa aaparishan karvaa lenaa chahie
 Laser operation takes two to three hours and does not rip at all
 tonsil se bachaav ke liye jaruri he ki bacchon ko santulit bhojan diya jaae taaki unke sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta majboot ho
 The most important thing is that immediately after seeing the symptoms of tonsils, contact the doctor immediately
 doctor dwaara die gaye dawaai ke course ko puraa karnaa chahie
 Often people stop the medicine as soon as they get a little rest, but doing so makes the disease more severe
 is rog ke dauraan rogi ko khaanaa−pani nigalane main takalif hoti he
 So many people eat less, it is not right
 rogi ke sharir kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti naram yaa taral khaadya padaarth dekar kii jari chahie
 By this, the body's immunity remains
 hindu dharm ke anusaar, pradosh vrath kaliyug main ati mangalakaari or shiv krupa pradaan karanevaala hota he
 Evening time in the month of Trayodashi is called Pradosh Kaal
 manyata he ki pradosh ke samay mahadev kailash parvat ke rajat bhawan main is samay nrity karte hai or devtaa unke gunon kaa stvan karte hai
 Those who want their welfare can keep this fast
 pradosh vrath ko karne se har prakaar kaa dosha mit jaataa he
 Pradosh fast of seven days of the week has its own special significance
 pradosh vrath ke vishay main gaya he ki agar At some point on the banks of the Ganges, the master of the Vedas and the devotee of God, Sutaji, narrated the significance of this fast to the Shaunakadi sages
 sutaji ne kaha he ki kaliyug main jab manushya dharm ke aacharan se hatakar adharm kii raah par ja rahaa hogaahar taraf anyaay or anachar kaa bolbalaa hoga
 Human will be distracted from his duty and will engage in low karma, at that time Pradosh fast will be such a fast that will make human eligible for the grace of Shiva and by getting rid of low speed, man will get good people
 soot ji ne shaunkadi rishiyon ko yah bhi kaha ki pradosh vrath se punya se kaliyug main manushya ke sabhi prakaar ke ksht or paap nasht ho jaaenge
 This fast is very welfare, due to the effect of this fast, man will get desired
 is vrath main alag alag din ke pradosh vrath sekya laabh miltaa he yah bhi soot ji ne bataaya
 Soot ji told the Shaunkadi sages that Lord Shankar had first heard Mother Sati on the occasion of this fast
 mujhe yahi katha or mahatmay maharishi vedavyas ji ne sunaaya or yah uttam vrath mahatmaya maine aapako sunaaya he
 Pradosh Vrat Vidasutji ji has said that the fast of Trayodashi of each party is called Pradosh Vrat
 suryaast ke pashchaat raatri ke aane se purv kaa samay pradosh kaal kehalaata he
 Mahadev Bhole Shankarki is worshiped in this fast
 is vrath main vrati ko nirjal rahakar vrath rakhana hota he
 After bathing in the morning, worship Lord Shiva with Bel Patra, Ganga water with incense lamp
 sandhya kaal main pun: snaan karke isi prakaar se shiv ji kii puja karnaa chahie
 In this way, fasting gets merit by observing Pradosh
 eent ke kaam yaa 'eent kii chinai' kaa arth he iton ko is prakaar chinana ki unase bani diwaar sudrudh ho
 In bricks plowing or masonry, bricks, lime and sand, lime and lime, shade and lime or cement and sand are used between the bricks
 parantu deevaaron kii dridhtaa keval gaare aadi par nirbhar nahin he
 The bricks are placed in such a way that they rest on each other, but if necessary, two four bricks can be pulled out of the wall without desiccating it
 shabdaawalee : diwaar ke anudish rakhi eent ko varanasi kii ore patta kehete hai or anuprastha rakhi eent ko todaa yaa tudiya; eent kii lambaai ke anudish chirakar do aadhi iton main se prayek ko khanda kehete hai; chaudaai ke anudish todakar do aadhi iton main se prayek ko addha kehete hai
 Half of the block is called a snag
 eent ke kaam main kai tarah kii chaale kaam main laai jaati hai
 The main practices are given below
 ingshil reeti - is reeti main baahar se dekhne par prayek radde main yaa to keval patte yaa keval tode dikhaai padate hai
 Leases and breakers keep coming up one by one
 dvigun flemish reeti - prayek radde main patte or tode ek ke baad ek aate rahete hai
 It looks like this on both sides of the wall
 ekal flemish reeti - makaan ke baahar se dekhne par prayek radde main patte or tode ek ke baad ek aate rahete hai, parantu bheetar se dekhne par diwaar english reeti se judi jaan padati he
 Leases only - Some leagues are made by keeping only leases in each trash
 aisi bhit aadhi eent moti hoti he
 Breaks only - Only weights can be applied to each trash; Such plucking is done in the work of making vaulted plinth, wall pad, visor, cornice etc
 bageeche yaa haate kii bhit - aisi bheeton main teen patton kii bagal main ek todaa rahata he
 English plowing is stronger than Flemish plowing, but Flemish plowing makes a more flat wall
 udhaahrant:, yadi 9 inch lambii hai or 9 inch moti diwaar banani he to do patton ke bich main newnaadhik gaara rakhkar diwaar kii motaai thik 9 inch kar di ja sakati he, parantu iton kii vaastavik lambaai newnaadhik rahati he 
 Now on adding a 9-inch wall, where the leasing will remain, the wall of bricks will penetrate or exit according to the magnification
 flemish jodai main patte adhik or tode kam rahete hai
 From this, Flemish plowing is more flat
 haate kii chaharadivari ke liye bhi isi kaaran teen radde patton ke or tab keval ek radda todon kaa rakhaa jaataa he
 This makes the wall somewhat weak, but there is not much burden on such wall that special reinforcement is required
 diwaar par plasters karnaa ho to bhi diwaar yathasambhav sapaat hi banani chahie, anyathaa adhik masala kharch hota he
 The systematic uniformity in brick work depends not only on the fixation of the brick core, but also on the size of the joint, because if the height of the spices between each waste does not match properly, the bricks remain true
 What will you do? In order to keep the thickness of the joints in the brick work controlled, the thickness of the four laps is pre-determined
 udhaahrant: yadi eent kii unchaai 23⁄4 inch he or gaare ke jod kii oonchaai ko chauthai inch rakhana he to yah niyam bana diya ja saktaa he ki jodai ke kaary main prayek chaar raddon kii oonchaai thik 12 inch rahe

 By participating in the war of Crimea with England and France, it made a successful attempt to turn these powerful states against Austria
 kreemian yuddh kii samaapti par paris kii sandhiparishad main kavur sammilit hua
 By taking advantage of this opportunity, the task of making Italy's problem Europe's problem and the sympathy of European states against Austria was the result of Kavur's diplomacy
 parantu is samay shantipurna dhang se italy kii samasya kaa hal asambhav tha
 Austria could not be removed from Italy without breaking the Treaty of Vienna of 1815
 parantu 1848 i
 kii kranti se bhaybheet europe main 1815 kii vienna sandhi kaa sanshodhan karne kaa saahas nahin tha
 In doing so, he feared a revival of revolutionary movements

 uttari italy se austria ke shashan kaa ant hone par nise or sevoy pradeshon ko, jo france tathaa italy ke madhya sthit the, france ko de dene kaa bhi nishchay hua
 Kavur began to encourage revolutionary parties in the states of Italy
 'karbonari' tathaa 'yuvak italy' aadi samast krantikari sanghathanon se usko sahyog mila
 With the encouragement of Kavur, the revolutionaries of Lombardy and Venezia started opposing the Austrian rule
 iske atirikt pidmant main nirantar prasha kaa anukaran karke sainik shakti sanghathan bhi aarambh kar diya gaya
 The rulers of Austria were frightened by these protests and ordered Kavur to disband the newly recruited army
 parantu kavur to isi avasar kii pratiksha main tha
 Therefore, on 18 April 1859, a war was declared on behalf of Austria
 kavur ko apana dhyey safal hone kii purna aashaa thi
 But Napoleon III changed his policy at this time
 apane rajya ke nikat ek shaktishaalee raashtra kaa udai use france ke liye vaanchhneeya drushtigochar nahin hota tha
 In addition, the Emperor of France did not want to do anything against the Pope so that indigenous Catholics would turn against him
 kavur akelaa hi yuddh chalaanaa chahta tha
 But he resigned after his differences with King Viktor Emanuel II of Piedmant
 parantu kavur dwaara sanchalit is yuddh ke parinamswaroop 10 navambar 1859 ko jurich main hui sandhi ke anusaar lombardi, parama, modena, tathaa tuskani pradesh pidmant ke adhikaar main aa gaye

 viktar emanuele kii ore se ladane kii ghoshnaa karte hue garibaldi ne dakshin italy ke sicili evam nepuls naamak pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya
 Although Kavur did not support Garibaldi's revolutionary manner and feared dissolution of Garibaldi's military power, he was successful because of Garibaldi's great support and the territories came under the King of Padimant
 rome ko chhodkar pope kaa sara rajya bhi pidmant main mila liya gaya

 He was one of the greatest winners of history
 uske saamne koi ruk nahin paa rahaa tha
 Until he invaded Russia in 1812, where his army was greatly damaged by the cold and the atmosphere
 18 june 1815 waterlu ke yuddh main paraajay ke pashchaat angrazon ne use andh mahaasaagar ke dur dweep saint helena main bandi bana diya
 He died there at the end of six years
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar angrezon ne use sankhiya kaa vish dekar maar daalaa
 Napoleon was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajasi, the following year after the reunification of Carcica and France
 uske pita charles bonapart ek chirkaalin kuleen parivaar ke the
 Their lineage is said to be from the Tuscany region of Italy adjacent to Carcica
 charles bonapart french darbar main carsika kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 He was married to an aristocratic beauty named Leticia Remolino, who was born Napoleon
 charles ne french shashan ke viruddh carsican vidroh main bhaag bhi liya tha, kintu antat: french shakti se samya sthapit karnaa hi shreyaskar samajha
 By the grace of the French Governor Marbiff, he also had the opportunity to join a consultation in Versailles
 charles ke saath uski dwitiya putr napolian bhi tha
 Inspired by the bright future that his personality indicated, the French authorities offered Breen a scholarship to study at the military academy and received his education there from 1779 to 1784
 taduparant paris ke sainik skool main use apana topakhane sambandhi gyaan pusht karne kaa avasar lagbhag ek varsh tak mila
 Thus Napoleon's childhood was spent in the French environment
 balyavastha main hi saare parivaar ke bharan poshan kaa uttardaayitv komal kandhon par pad jane ke kaaran use vaataavaran kii jatilta evam uske anusaar vyavhaar karne kii kushalta mil gai thi
 Therefore, his entry into the French Revolution was indicative of epoch-making events
 france ke vibhinn virgon se sampark sthapit karne main use koi sankoch yaa hichkichaahat nahin thi
 He also entered the Jacobin contingent and was introduced to events directly on the occasion of Tuileri's right on 20 June
 france ke rajtantr kii durdasha kaa bhi use purna gyaan ho gaya tha
 This is where the huge personality of Napoleon emerges
 napolian ke udai tak french kranti purna araajaktaa main parivartit ho chuki thi
 The 'reign of terror' was conducted as a result of the rivalry and disharmony of the Jacobin and Girndist parties, in which all the revolutionaries, even Rabspier himself, were killed one by one
 1793 i main tulaan ke ghere main napolian ko pratham baar apana shaury evam kalapradarshan kaa avasar mila tha
 Bairas, a prominent ruler of the directory, was attracted by his talent
 phir 1795 main jab bheed kanrveshan ko hui thi, to directory dwaara vishesh rup se ayukta hone par napolian ne kushaltapurvak kanvension kii raksha kii or samvidhan ko hone diya
 These successes drew the attention of all France to Napoleon and the directory gave him the lead in the Italian campaign
 ek saptaah pashchaat usne jojephin se vivaah kiya or taduparant apni sena sahit italy main pravesh kiya
 The Italian campaign was a vivid example of Napoleon's military and administrative ability
 is baat kii ghoshnaa purv hi kar di gai thi ki french sena italy ko austria kii daastaa se mukt karaane aa gayi he
 He severed ties with Austria by defeating the enemy at the first three places
 tab sardenia ko yudhviram karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 He then received Milan in Lodi's place
 revoli ke yuddh main mentua ko samarpan karnaa padaa
 Archduke Charles also had to submit the treaty and the Luban agreement was reached
 in saare yudhon or vaartaon main napolian ne paris se kisi prakaar kaa aadesh nahin liya
 The Pope also had to make a treaty
 lombardi ko sisalpine tathaa jinoa ko ligurian ganatantr main parivartit kar french namoonay par ek vidhaan diya
 These successes caused Austria to lose its footing and had to turn to Napoleon for the Treaty of Campo Fermi, and in this complex situation, Austria had to withdraw its hand from its Bellary territories and from the Rhine frontiers and Lombardy
 napolian ke in yudhon se tathaa chote rajyon ko samaapt kar vrihat ikai main parivartit karne ke kaaryon se, italy main ek rashtriya andolan khadaa hua jo itihaas main risorgimento ke naam se prasiddh he
 On his return from the Italian expedition, Napoleon received a grand welcome
 directory bhi bhaybheet ho gai tathaa napolian ko france se dur rakhane kaa upaay sochane lagi
 At this time, the rival of France was left only to Britain
 napolian ne britain ko haraane ke liye uske samrajya par kutharaghaat na karnaa uchit samajha tathaa apni misr-abhiyaan-yojana rakhi
 The directory immediately accepted him
 1798 i main bonapart ne misr ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The plan of ending the eastern kingdom of Britain through Egypt instead of making a direct attack on Britain seemed compatible with the French rulers
 mimluk turki se iskaa saamana paramid ke tathakthith yuddh main hua
 But the Mediterranean president of the British Navy was chasing Commander Nelson Napoleon efficiently
 usne aage badhkar francisiyon ko nil nadi ke yuddh main teetar-bitar kar diya tathaa turki ko bhi englad kii ore se yuddh main pravesh karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Nelson's success gave Britain the opportunity to form a second bloc, and the nations of Europe, which Napoleon had suppressed, began preparing for a campaign against France
 turki ke yuddh main pravisht ho jane par napolian ne syria kaa abhiyaan chhedaa
 With only a limited contingent of thirteen thousand marched towards Acker but stopped by a skilled fighter like Sidney Smith
 yah napolian ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Now Napoleon was involved in the creation of another French empire in Syria
 kintu france is samay ek najuk sthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 Therefore, Napoleon considered it desirable to appear in France, despite being successful in establishing his power in Egypt
 napolian ke france main pravesh karte hi halchal paidaa ho gai
 Finding a favorable environment, in November 1799, Napoleon seized power and disbanded the directory and enacted a new legislation
 is vidhaan ke anusaar teen kaunsal niyukt hue
 After some time all the powers were concentrated in the first Council Napoleon
 france ek deergh ashaanti se thak chukaa tha tathaa kranti ko sthapitv kii ore le jane ke liye antarkalin shanti param aavashyak thi
 But before the peace was established, an Italian campaign was necessary to defeat Austria
 napolian ne 1800 i main italy kaa doosraa abhiyaan basant ritu main prarambh kiya tathaa merengo kii vijay praapt kar austria ko lunvil kii sandhi ke liye vivash kar diya, jisamen pehle kii campoformiyon kii sari sharten doharaai gai
 Now the second bloc broke out and Napoleon made a treaty of Amiens from England in 1801 AD, under which the two nations returned each other's conquered territories
 ab nepolian ne ek sudhaar yojana karyanvit kar france ko shashan or vyavastha di
 Disciplined the economic condition of France

 paris kaa saundaryikaran kiya
 Made considerable changes in the army and gave a scientific basis to the French system, which is still known as the Napoleonic Code
 pope se ek con courdet kar catholic jagat kaa samarthan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon achieved considerable success with these reforms and in March 1804 he became the Emperor of France
 is ghatana se saare europe main ek halchal paidaa hui
 Again the war between France and Britain began to cloud
 napolian ne england par akraman karne ke liye uttari samudri tat par bolon main apni sena bheji
 England awakened to the north of its naval contingent on the English Channel and then surprised Napoleon at every encounter
 aamiain kii sandhi ke samaapt hote hi wiliam pit shashan main aayaa or usne england, austria, yas aadi rashtron ko milakar ek tritiy gut banaaya
 Napoleon then barricaded against Austria and ended the Republic of Sisalpine and assumed the position of King of Italy himself
 austria ko ulm ke yuddh main haraaya
 Francis, the ruler of Austria, fled and took refuge in the Tsar
 idhar trafalgar ke yuddh main nelson ne napolian kii jalsena ko haraa diya tha, jisase austria ko phir se napolian ko chunauti dene kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system
 parinamswaroop napolian ne spain par chadhaai kii or vahaan kii satta chin lee
 This sparked a national uprising in Spain
 nepolian isko dabaa bhi nahin paaya tha ki use austria ke vidroh ko dabaanaa padaa or phir kram se prasha or rus ne bhi is vyavastha kii avagya kii
 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon
 uske moscow abhiyaan kii barbaadi itihaas main prasiddh ho gayi he
 Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon again collected an army, but was again defeated at Leipzig by the united armies of Prussia, Russia and Austria
 chaaron ore rashtriya sangram chhid jane se vah sakriy rup se kisi ek raashtra ko na dabaa sakaa tathaa 1814 i main alba dweep bhej diya gaya
 The Allied forces were not able to return even after it was reported that Napoleon's century-long rule began
 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system to unite all the institutions from primary to higher education
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them

 The company may change the cross value after the initial issue
 koi company paar vailu se adhik mulya ke share jari kar sakati he, jise premium kaha jaataa he, yadi vah sebi ke laabhpradata maandand yaa laabh dein sakane ke paimaane par khari utarati he
 This means that a company will be able to issue fewer shares to raise the required amount and at the same time its dividend liability or dividend liability will be reduced accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi company ke shares kii paar vailu 50 rupee hai lekin company sebi ke profitability criteria par khari utarati he isliye wo apane sheyaron ko 75 rupee kii keemat par jari kar sakati he
 That is, it can issue at a premium of Rs 25
 yahan ye dhyaan yogya he ki company apana labhaansh yaa dividend share ke paar yaa phase vailu par ghoshit karti he, chaahe wo share kitne bhi premium par jari kyon naa hua ho
 In the case of an initial public offer, companies decide the share price using one of the following three methods: yani phixd price methd ke anusaar jis mulya par share ofer kiye jate hai use company tay kar detii he
 This work is done before the issue opens
 sheyaron kii maang kitni he iskaa pataa company ko tabhi ho paata he jab ishyu band ho jaataa he
 Shares can also be reported at a premium through this method
 is vidhi main niveshak ko ofer kiye share kaa shuddh mulya kaa anumaan nahin ho paata he
 Instead, the company fixes a nominal price range for the stock
 niveshak apni kshamta ke anusaar alag-alag sheyaron ke liye boli lagaate hai
 These bids can be anything within the fixed price range
 sheyaron ke liye ai boli kii maatra ko dekhte hue share kii keemat tay kii jaati he or jitne bhi niveshkon ne iske liye aavedan kiya hota he unhen isi keemat par share die jate hai, chaahe unhone boli main koi or rakam tay kii ho

 The true nature of the numerator cannot be explained easily, because the division is completely different from the group of shareholders who make it

 It is also equally universal, not mandatory, that capital be divided into fraction of the nominal value

 Be it advertisements published in magazines or magazines or presented through hoardings etc
, its decoration should be so original that it automatically draws the eyes of the people towards it

 The agency that makes the advertisement should create an advertisement that is literate for all, educated and illiterate, urban and rural
 jis vigyaapan ko samajhane main darshak ko dimag lagaana padegaa uske prati vah judaav mahasoos nahin kar paaegaa

 vigyaapan se keval upabhokta kaa hi laabh nahin praapt hota balki use bechney vaale dukandaar arthath vikreta ko bhi laabh praapt hota he
 The ad seller makes the task so easy that he does not have to repeatedly tell the consumers about the new item
 sachai to yah he ki vigyaapan vastu ke saath hi saath vah kahan-kahan uplabdh he, isaki jaankaree muhaiyaa karaata he
 Hence, both consumers and sellers benefit from advertising
 vigyaapan ke madhyam se nayi vastua ke utpaadan tathaa uski upyogita kii jaankaree di jaati he jisase upabhokta kaa dhyaan us vastu ke istemaal kii ore kendrit hota he
 This is how advertising creates the market

 Due to this, language is developing and Hindi is becoming a living language of new times and society, not just the language of books
 prayek bhashaa kii apni bhashaa samskruti hoti he
 His vocabulary, syntax, idioms etc
 are special
 hindi kaa bhi apana bhashaa sanskaar he
 In the present form of advertising, the status of renunciation of traditionalism and acceptance of modernity can be seen
 usamen keval utpaadak, utpaadit vastu or upabhokta hi nahin aata, balki jansanchaar ke sabhi madhyam or yatayat ke saadhan bhi aate hai, ye sabhi vigyaapan ke prasar main sahaayak hote he
 The use of Hindi verbs creates the ability to say more in advertisements
 bikaoo he, jararat he, chaahate ho, aate hai, jate hai, aaie jaise shabdon ke prayog se vigyapanon kii arthvatta badhati he
 The Hindi-vocabulary used in printed advertisements such as letters and magazines changes with the change of medium
 radiyon main jahaan dhvanyatmak shabdon kaa mahatv hota he vahiin televijan tathaa cinema main drishyaatmak kriyaapadon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if an advertisement like 'apply Boroline' is printed to keep the skin soft on frosty days, then for radio - words like 'remove frosty sweetness Boroline', but Doordarshan and audio-visual
 Visuals in mediums such as' Have you seen? Did you know? Etc
 words are used
 vigyaapan ko aarthik vikaas ke liye dekha ja saktaa he, kai log vigyapanon ke saamaajik lagat par bhi dhyaan dena chaahate he
 Internet advertising is the prime example of this criticism

 Exploits the desires of a consumer by making the ads more attractive
 janata ke hit kii raksha ke prayaason kaa dhyaan dene ke liye vigyapanon kaa viniman kii gai he

 We use semiotics to study and interpret messages

 Before creating an advertisement, it is clear in the mind of the entrepreneur that who is his consumer? And in its advertisements, the entrepreneur / advertising agency addresses the same consumer group
 us samooh kii ruchi, aadaton evam mahatvakankshaon ko lakshya karke hi vigyaapan kii bhashaa, chitra evam akhbaar, patrikaon, sampreshan madhyamon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 For example - if an entrepreneur prepares an item for women, then his style will be determined on the basis of: upabhokta samooh - mahilaayein Economic - Medium / Low / High shaikshik str - saadhaaran / ucch i do not use any such cream for my saloni skin
 yadi vastu kii khariddaar madhyam shrenee kii mahilaayein ho to vigyaapan fusfusaayegaa - Which was waiting for you xxrep 12 
 a cream that will make your skin look soft
 xxrep 5 
 aapke pati aapako dekhte rah jaayen xxrep 21 
 Not only language and style, but also visuals or drawing is an important part of the advertisement
 ye chitra, graphs ityadi bhashaa ke prabhaav ko or bhi prabalata pradaan karte he
 All these are also prepared keeping the consumer group in mind
 udhaaharan swaroop yadi kaanlej ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye koi vastu taiyaar kii gai he to chust- furt yuvak - yuvatiyon kaa samooh vigyaapan main darshaya jaayegaa yaa phir ek khubasurat yuvati ko nihaarte yuvak dikhaaye jaayenge

 nitishastra jise vyavahaardarshan, nitidarshan, nitivigyaan or achaarshastra bhi kehete hai, darshan kii ek shakha hai
 Although the definition and field of ethics have been subject to differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 By defining concepts such as good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and blame, justice and crime, ethics attempts to address questions of human morality
 bauddhik samiksha ke kshetra ke rup main, vah naitik darshan, varnatmak nitishastra, or mulya siddhant ke kshetron se bhi sambandhit hai
 Three major areas of practice in ethics are recognized: isame vakilo ore apane pakshakaar ko jo bhi salaah di jaati he usee ke hisaab se pakshakaar kaam karata he 
 Rushworth Keyder states that "definitions of" ethics "have generally included phrases such as 'science of ideal human character' or 'science of moral duty'
 " richard wiliam paul or linda elder kii paribhaasha ke anusaar, nitishastra "ek sankalpanaaon or siddhanton kaa samucchy hai, jo, kaunsa vyavhaar samvedan-samarth jeevon kii madad karata hai yaa unhen nuqasaan pahunchataa hai, ye nirdhaarit karne main hamaara maargdarshan karata hai"
 The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the term ethics "is commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' 'and is sometimes more narrowly used to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual"
 paul or elder kehete hai ki zyaadaatar log samjik prathaon, dharmik aasthaaon or vidhi inke anusaar vyavhaar karne or nitishastra ke madhya bhramit ho jate hai or nitishastra ko akeli sankalpana nahin maanate
 The term "ethics" has many meanings
 iskaa sandarbh darshanik nitishastra yaa naitik darshan se ho saktaa hai
 The behavior of man is studied in many scriptures from many perspectives
 maanavvyavahaar, prakruti ke vyapaaron kii bhaanti, kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa ke rup main hota he or uskaa karanmulak adhyayan evam vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 This is what psychology does
 kintu prakritik vyapaaron ko ham acha yaa bura kahkar visheshit nahin karte
 When we get wet due to sudden rain on the way, we do not say bad words to the clouds
 iske vipareet saathi manushyon ke karmon par ham baraabar bhale-bure kaa nirnay dete hai
 Thus the universal human tendency to pass judgment is the mother of ethics
 achaarshastra main ham vyavasthit rup se chintan karte hue yah jaanane kaa praytn karte hai ki hamaare achchhai-buraai ke nirnyon kaa buddhigrahya aadhaar kya he
 It is said that ethics is a regulatory or ideal science, while psychology is a theoretical science
 nishchay hi shastron ke is vargeekaran main kuch tathy he, par vah bhraamak bhi ho saktaa he
 The above classification may give rise to the notion that the work of ethics is not the exploration and inauguration of the rules of ethical behavior, but rather artificially inflating such rules on human society
 kintu yah dharna galat he
 The moral laws that ethics explores are inherent in the basic consciousness of man himself
 avashya hi yah chetana vibhinn samaajon tathaa yugon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karti dikhaai detii he
 The main reason for this diversity is the complexity of human nature and the diversity of human credit
 vibhinn deshkalon ke vichaarak apane samaajon ke prachlit vidhinishedhon main nihit naitik paimaanon kaa hi anveshan karte hai
 In our own era, due to the incorporation of many new old cultures, it may be possible for thinkers to rise above countless stereotypes and ambiguous beliefs, leading to the inauguration of virtually universal moral principles
 meta-nitishastra yah poochta hai ki ham isse kaise samajhate hai, iske bare main kaise jaanate hai or iskaa kya arth nikaalte hai, jab ham 'kya sahi hai' or 'kya galat hai' kii baat karte hai
 This is a positive squeeze of the problems going on in the mind
 mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kriya kaa adhyayan hai
 It is that branch of ethics that examines a set of questions that originate when thinking how one should work ethically
 mandandak nitishastra meta-nitishastra se alag hai, kyonki yah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa parikshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa ke arth or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Traditional, normative ethics was the study of what makes an action what is right or wrong
 ye siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu vyapak naitik siddhanth pradaan karte hai
 Utilitarianism has always been a dominant view of humans
 yah vichaardhaara manushya ke aacharan ke us paksh ko parilakshith karti he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki == moral philosophy == manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain raajnneetik nitishastra raajnneetik karrwai or raajnneetik agenton ke bare main naitik naitik nirnay lene kii pratha he
 Descriptive ethics is less inclined to the philosophical end of the screen because its purpose is to obtain specific information about how people live and to draw general conclusions based on vision patterns
 nitishastra kaa mul prashn kya he, is sambandh main do mahatvaparn mat paae jate hai
 According to one wish, the main problem of ethics is to tell what is the ultimate credit of human life
 param shrey kaa bodh ho jane par ham shubh karm unhen kahenge jo us shrey kii ore le janevaale hai; vipareet karmon ko ashubh kaha jayega
 According to the second wish, the main task of ethics is to clarify the notion of auspicious or religious
 duusare shabdon main, nitishastra kaa kaary us niyam yaa niyamsamooh kaa swaroop spasht karnaa he jis yaa jinke anusaar anushthit karm shubh athwa dharmik hote hai
 A
 Two intentions give rise to ideologies of two different categories
 param shrey kii kalpana anek prakaar se kii gai he; in kalpanaaon athwa siddhanton kaa varnan ham aage karenge
 Here we will discuss briefly how the rules of morality - if there are such rules - can be of any kind
 niyam yaa kanoon kii dharna yaa to rajya ke dandvidhaan se aati he yaa bhautik vigyaanon se, jahaan prakruti ke niyamon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 State laws are created by the modifiable will of one type of ruler
 ve kabhi-kabhi kuch virgon ke hit ke liye banaae jate hai, unhen todaa bhi ja saktaa he or unke paalan se bhi kuch logon ko haani ho sakati he
 In contrast, the laws of nature are indivisible
 rajya ke niyam badale ja sakate hai, kintu prakruti ke niyam aparivartaneey hai
 The rules of policy or virtue are considered immutable, welfare for the follower and unenforceable
 in drushtiyon se nitishastra ke niyam swasthyavigyaan ke niyamon ke purnataya samaan hote hai
 It seems that man or human nature is spread under the control of two different categories of rules
 ek ore to manushya un kanoonon kaa vashwarti he jinka udghaatan yaa nirupan bhautik vigyaan, rasayanashastra, pranishastra, manovigyaan aadi tathyanveshi shastron main hota he or duusari ore swasthyavigyaan, tarkshastra aadi aadarshanveshi vigyaanon ke niyamon kaa, jinase vah baadhya to nahin hota, par jinka paalan uske sukh tathaa unnati ke liye aavashyak he
 The rules of ethics are of this second category
 nitishastra kii pramukh samasyaayein nimnlikhit he- We can divide the problems of ethics into three classes: param shrey ke bare main purv or pashchim main anek kalpanaayen kii gai hai
 Almost all philosophies in India believe that happiness is the ultimate goal of life, but most of them have a concept of happiness completely different from so-called euphemism
 is duusare yaa prachlit arth main ham keval charvak darshan ko saukhyavaadee kah sakate hai
 There is no systematic description of Charvak's moral intentions, but it is understood that in his euphemism, gross sensual pleasure is given importance
 bharat ke duusare darshan jis atyantik sukh ko jivan kaa lakshya kehete hai use apvarg, mukti yaa moksh athwa nirvana se samikrut kiya gaya he
 In the Nyaya and Samkhya Darshans, the category of exclusion or liberation is envisaged, it cannot be said to be an emotional pleasures but the liberation of the Upanishads and Vedanta can be said to be inward
 vedant kii mukti tathaa baudhon kaa nirvana, donon hi us sthiti ke dyotak hai jab vyakti kii aatma sukh du:kha aadi dwandvon se pare ho jaati he
 This condition can also come in lifetime; The pragya situated in the Bhagavad Gita is said to be a life-free one
 paashchaatya darshanon main param shrey ke sambandh main anek matvaad paae jate hai : There is also different scholasticism regarding what is the source or source of knowledge of our ultimate credit or good and inauspicious
 adhikansh pratyayvaadiyon ke mat main bhalaai-buraai ko bodh buddhi dwaara hota he
 This is the view of Hegel, Bradley etc
 and Kant's intent is also not opposed to it
 kaant maanate hai ki antat: hamaari krityabuddhi hi naitik aadarshon kaa strot he
 According to empiricists experience is the source of knowledge of our auspicious inauspiciousness
 yah mat naitik saapekshyatawad ko janm detaa he
 The third opinion is pratibhānavāda or up jhhvhjj)
 is mat ke anusaar hamaare bheetar ek aisi shakti he jo saakshaat dhang se shubh ashubh ko pahchaan yaa jaan leti he
 There are many forms of reflection
 shaiftsbari or hachesan naamak british darshanikon kaa vichaar tha ki rup ras aadi ko grahan karanevaali indriyon kii hi bhaanti hamaare bheetar ek naitik indriya bhi hoti he jo sidhe bhalaai buraai ko dekh leti he
 In the opinion of a thinker named Bishop Butler, we have a motivating instinct called Sadasadbuddhi which shows us the path of justification while resolving the duality between selfishness and altruism
 hamaare aacharan kii anek prerak vrittiyaan hai; ek vritti atmprem he, duusari par-hit-aakanksha 
 The place of Sadasadabuddhi is above these two, he is decisively distinguished above these two
 german vichaarak kaant kii gananaa pratibhanvaadiyon main bhi kii jaati he
 One common feature of the prescient moral principles is that they do not consider it necessary to focus on the consequences of an action in order to decide the good of evil
 koi karm isliye shubh yaa ashubh nahin ban jaataa ki uske parinaam ek yaa duusari koti ke hai
 Or the preconception of all the results of a task is as difficult as it is to control them
 karm kii achchhai buraai uski prerana se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The karma that has an auspicious motivation at its core is satta karma, karma born in inauspicious inspiration is asatta karma or sin
 kaante kaa kathan he ki shubh sankalpabuddhi ek aisi cheez he jo swayan shreyrup he, jiskaa shreyatv nirpeksh evam nishchit he; shesh sab vastuon kaa shreyatv saapeksh hota he
 Only auspicious willpower is illuminated by its own form of light
 naitik shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhartiya vichaarkon ne bhi kai mat prakat kiye hai
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, the ethics inspired by Shruti is dharma and the Karma prohibited by Shruti or Veda is unrighteousness
 is prakaar dharm evam adharm shrutiyon ke vidhi-nishedh-mulak hai
 Along with the teaching of Nishkam Karmayoga in the Bhagavad Gita, it has been said that the scripture is the proof for the knowledge of duty and duty
 shaastra ke antargat shruti tathaa smriti donon kaa pariganan hota he
 Different duties have been directed for each varna and ashram of Hinduism; a detailed explanation of these duties is found in the Dharmasutras and the Memoirs
 is koti ke kartavyon ke atirikt saamaanya dharm athwa saarvbhaum dharmaniyamon ke bodh ke liye ko bhi pramaan mana gaya he
 The ethos of gentlemen has been accepted as a pioneer
 naitik aacharan kii anivaaryta ke aadhaar bhi anek roopon main kalpit hue hai
 Religion has been the most important regulator of morality in the history of man
 hamen naitik niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, kyonki vaisaa ishwar yaa dharmavyavastha ko isht he
 The second regulatory power of ethics is the state
 logon ko aniatik kaaryon se virat karne main rajagna ek mahatvapurn hetu hoti he
 Similarly, fear of society also gives power to moral rules
 kaant ke anusaar hamen swayan dharm ke liye dharm karnaa chahie; kartavyapaalan swayan apane main isht yaa saadhy vastu he
 Those thinkers who preserve duty and duty with the expectation of supreme sacrifice can say that the motivation of moral conduct is basically the motivation for self-promotion
 ham shubh karm karte hai, kyonki vaisaa karne se ham apane param shrey kii ore pragati karte hai
 An important problem of ethics is whether man is free to act? When we call a person good for any of his or her actions, then we clearly consider him responsible for that work, which means that there is a hidden belief that that person was free not to do the work under consideration
 kaant kehete hai : chunki mujhe karnaa chahie, isliye main kar saktaa hoon
 This means that a system of moral living and moral evaluation is not possible without respecting the freedom of the subject
 ham prakruti ke vyapaaron ko bhala bura nahin kehete, keval manushya ke karmon par hi vaisaa nirnay dete hai; isse jaan padataa he ki prakritik tathaa maanviya vyapaaron main kuch antar he
 This difference is due to human freedom
 kisi kriya ke anushthan ko ichha kaa vishay banane na banane main manushya kii sankalpabuddhi swatantra he
 The above opinion is not acceptable to the determinants of determinism
 bhautik vigyaan batalaata he ki vishvabrahmad main sarvatra kaary-kaaran-niyam kaa akhand shashan he
 Each present event is determined by the past
 sampurna vishwa ek brihat kaary-kaaran-parampara he
 All types of events are subject to unbroken rules
 aisi dasha main yah kaise mana ja saktaa he ki manushya sankalp vikalp tathaa vyapaar akaaran evam niyamaheen hote hai? manushya ke kriyakalapon ko vishwa ke ghatnasmooh main apvaadrup nahin mana ja saktaa
 If on many occasions we cannot make a successful prediction regarding human trades, then the reason for this is incomplete knowledge of the regulatory rules of those trades, not the rulelessness of those trades
 nirdharanwad ke siddhant ko bhautik shastron se bal mila he; use prakrutijagat kii yantravaadi vyakhya se bhi avlamb miltaa he
 But this does not mean that determinism is a physical theory
 kaha gaya he ki spinoja tathaa hegel ke darshanon main vyakti kii swatantraaa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 In Sankhya philosophy, Purush is considered to be nirgun and passive
 samast karmon ko buddhi main aropit kiya gaya he or buddhi ko teen gunon se sanchalit batalaaya gaya he
 It is written in the Gita - All the work is done by the three qualities of nature, ego man considers himself the doer
 gita main hi prayek karm ke sankhyasmmat paanch kaaran ginaae gaye hai, arthath adhishthan, katrta, karan, vividh cheshtaayen or daiv; aisi dasha main keval karm ke liye uttaradaayi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Some thinkers like Mackenzie etc
 hold the principle of self-determination apart from the above two opinions
 jahaan manushya swatantraaa kii bhaavana se karm karata he, vahaan karm swayan uske vyaktitv main nihit shaktiyon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 In this sense man is free
 bure kaam ke baad utpann honevaali pashchaattap kii bhaavana karta kii swatantraaa siddh karti he

 Taking the prevailing legend as the basis, he has written that during the mythological period, King Ben Praja, the vicious son of King Angaraja of Dharma dynasty, came here in the fierce struggle and died in the end
 chunki raja angaraj bahut hi sahishnu, dayaalu or dharmik pravriti ke the at: unke pavitra vansh kii raksha karne ke liye unke duraachaari putr raja ben ke mrit sharir kii rishi-muniyon ne isi sthaan par manthan kiya

 The construction of the temple started in 1949 and the completion in 1953, the same year there is mention of the establishment of the statue in the hands of Hirasayi Teli and the fair
 isi prakaar pithampur math ke mahant swami dayanand bharti ne bhi sanskrit main ``pithampur ke shri shankar mahatmaya`` likhakar san 1953 main prakaashat karaayaa tha
 36 "in the Loks, he brought Shivaji of Pithampur to Kal Kaleshwar Mahadev, the opening of the branch of the Sanatan Dharma Sanskrit Pathshala of Champa in Pithampur, in 1953 to get the silver Panchmukhi Shivji statue erected from Tilbhandeshwar, Kashi and from the same year at the Pithampur Fair
 Mentioned about Shivaji's procession
 unhone pithampur main mandir kii vyavastha ke liye ek math kii sthapana tathaa uske 50 varshon main das mahanton ke naamon kaa ullekh is mahatmaya main kiya he

 Whatever the fact, the temple is very ancient and there is no harm in believing that when the Sri Jagmal Gangaji contractor built the temple in the year 1755, the idol must have been established before that
 


or kisi mandir ko dhwast hone ke liye 185 varsh kaa antaraal paryaapt hota he
 Therefore, there is no harm in assuming that after 185 years its re-emergence took place in 1940 and the temple would have been constructed in which the inscription which was built in the east of the temple would have been re-rooted in the wall
 pithampur main kaal kaleshwarnath mandir ke nirmaan ke saath hi mela laganaa shuru ho gaya tha
 Initially, the fair used to be held only from Phalgun Purnima to Chaitra Panchami, later the fair expanded and according to the Imperial Gazetteer, the fair started for 10 days

 It is useful where many types of physical quantities are responsible for the result of an event
 bhautikavid aksar iskaa upyog kisi sameekaran aadi ki vaidhata kii jaanch ke liye karte rahete hai
 On the other hand it is used to relate variables related to complex physical conditions by equations
 vimiya vishleshan kii vidhi se praapt in sambhavit samikarnon ko prayog dwaara jaanchaa jaataa he, yaa anya siddhanton ke prakaash main dekha jaataa he
 Buckingham's theorem is the basis of dimensional analysis
 newton dwaara likhit pustak 'princepia' main vimayein tathaa vimiya vishleshan 'saadrishy kaa siddhant' naam se varnit hai
 Those who have contributed to increase this subject are: E
 Buckingham, Lord Rally and P
W
 Bridgman
 prarambh main vimiya vishleshan yantriki kii samasyaon main prayukt kiya gaya, kintu aajkal yah sabhi prakaar kii bhautikee evam ejiniyari kii samasyaon main prayukt hone laga he
 Dimensional analysis assumes that it is helpful in solving the theoretical and practical problems of everyday physicists and engineers
 sampurna bhautik rashiyaan do virgon main vibhajit kii jaati hai : Three obvious elementary quantities, length, mass, and time, were recognized in mechanical problems
 kintu yadi chumbakeey, vidyutiya or ooshmiya raashiyon ke liye bhi inkaa upyog karen to hamen baadhya hokar do anya raashiyon ko samavisht karnaa hoga
 All other derived physical quantities can be expressed in terms of these five fundamental signs
 baad main param taap tathaa jyoti tivrata ko bhi mul maatrak maan liya gaya
 For example, the dimensions of the force are ML T-2, the heat conductivity volume LM T-3 q-1 and the capacitance Q2 T2 M-1 L-2
 vaastavik upyog main maatrak paddati prayog main aati he : The dimensions and units of some mechanical quantities are given in the table below
 jal kisi sameekaran kaa rup maapan ke moulik maatrakon par nirbhar nahin karata, tab vah vimiya rup se samaangi kehalaata he
 For example, the oscillator of simple pendulum t = * 0
5 is valid whether the length is measured in feet or meters, or the time t is measured in minutes or seconds
 kisi prashn ke vimiya vishleshan kaa pratham sopan prashn main aae charon kaa nirnay karata he
 If in the event those variables, which are really ineffective, are used, then a large number of terms will appear in the final equation
 phir ham pradutt char-samucchy ke vimaavihin utpaadon ke purna samucchy kaa pariklan karte hai or unke bich ek saamaanya sambandh likhte hai
 In this regard, the following fundamental theorem proclaimed by E
 Buckingham is important: vilomat: ise is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki yadi moulik charon kaa sambandh in charon ke utpaadon ke nimnatam samucchy main badla ja saktaa he, to ye sabhi utpaada vimaavihin honge
 Buckingham's theorem, also called the Second Theorem, summarizes the entire theory of dimensional analysis
 kisi pipe se taral kaa pravaah hone par daab main kami hoti jaati he
 Suppose this deficiency depends on the following amounts
 jahaan a { \ displaystyle A} se f { \ displaystyle F} tak niyatak sankhyaayein hai
 And, donon taraf kii raashiyon kii vimaaon ko likahar saral karne par, According to the theory of dimensional analysis, the powers on both sides will be the same on the same physical amount
 atah On solving the above equations antatah nimnlikhit sutara praapt hote hai: Where Re - Reynolds number is Eu - Eiler number
