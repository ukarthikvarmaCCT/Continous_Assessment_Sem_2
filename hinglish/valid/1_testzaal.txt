 The amplifier made of bipolar transistors has to be fitted properly, only then it can function as expected otherwise a variety of problems may occur
 bijetti ko abhinath karne ke liye kai tarah ke network prayog kiye jate hai, jinaki apni-apane gundosh hai
 Amplifiers constructed from different bjts are often characterized with the help of different configurations of resistors, whereas integrated circuits use a more advanced inductance than this
 abhinati kii dizin main is baat ko sunishchit kiya jaataa he ki transistor kaa taap badalane par, transistor kaa β badalane par yaa thodaa alag β vaala transistor lagane par, yaa disi supplai ke voltage main thodaa parivartan hone par bhi transistor kaa sanchaalan bindu utana adhik na badale taaki transistor apane sakriy kshetra main hi bana rahe or apekshit dhang se kaary kar sake
 The 'operating point' of a transistor means the DC collector-emitter voltage and collector current of the transistor when the input signal is not in place
 ise 'bis-bindu', 'quicent bindu' yaa 'kyuu-bindu' bhi kehete hai
 The following inductance circuits are mainly used to introduce transistor amplifiers into class-a
 is abhinati ko 'base bis' athwa 'phixd registeens bis' bhi kehete hai
 The front diagram uses the same DC supply for both the collector and the base, but two different supplies can also be used
 is chitra ke sandarbh main- Hence, For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use
 As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed
 Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit
 Also for given circuit, Therefore, The common-emitter current gain of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor
 It is denoted as β on this page
 atah we can obtain Ic as well
 In this manner, the operating point given as can be set for given transistor
 laabh: Advantage: upyog: Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits
 Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch
 However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage
 This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point
 In this form of biasing, the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source v cc { \ displaystyle V_{ \ text{cc}}} 
 So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the r c { \ displaystyle R_{ \ text{c}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage VR b { \ displaystyle v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}} is By the ebers–moll model, i c = β i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{c}}= \ beta I_{ \ text{b}}}, and so From Ohm's law, the base current i b = VR b / r b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}} = v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b}}} / r _ { \ text {b}}}, and so Hence, the base current i b { \ displaystyle I_{ \ text{b}}} is If v be { \ displaystyle v _ { \ text {be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}} increases
 However, a larger i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor r c { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage VR b { \ displaystyle v _ {{ \ text {R}} _ { \ text {b xxrep 4 } across the base resistor r b { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {b}}}
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current i b { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {b}}}, which results in less collector current i c { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {c}}}
 Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable
 laabh: Advantage: which is the case when Usage: The negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted
 The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter
 This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is From Ohm's law, the base current is The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows
 If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases
 However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = iere, which in turn reduces the voltage vrb across the base resistor
 a lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β Ib
 Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable
 Like, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic
 By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable
 For the given circuit, Advantages: The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and β-value
 Disadvantages: which is approximately the case if Use: The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous
 Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved
 collector-stabilized Biasing The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2
 The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction
 By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β
 In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current
 However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor
 The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns
 By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much
 In this circuit the base voltage is given by: v b = { \ displaystyle V_{B}= \ } voltage across r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{2} \ } = v c c r 2 − i b r 1 r 2 { \ displaystyle =v_{cc}{ \ frac {r_{2}}{}}-i_{b}{ \ frac {R_{1}R_{2}}{}}} Also VB = v be + i e r e { \ displaystyle V_ {B} = V_ {be} + I_ {e} R_ {e} \ } For the given circuit, Benefit: alaabh: which is approximately the case if where R1 || R2 denotes the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 connected in parallel
 Use: The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits
 The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback - AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain
 This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram
 The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the ac-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of r c / r e { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {c}} / r _ { \ text { e}}} without the capacitor
 When a split supply is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load
 The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re
 The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse-bias the collector junction
 Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage
 We know that Vb − Ve = Vbe If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero
 Therefore, emitter current is, Ie = / Re The operating point is independent of β if Re >> Rb / β Advantages: Disadvantages: This type can only be used when a split power supply is available
 Class b and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow
 Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal
 Class b bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just organized
 class-ab bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1 / 4 of maximum possible value
the class-ab push – pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier
 Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices
 The output pair are arranged in class-ab push–pull, also called a complementary pair
 The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized
 That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-ab mode 
 This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond
 The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors
 If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage
 a common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so
 Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier

 The length of this cave is 19 meters and width is 16 meters
 gupha 11 meter unchi he
 The Amarnath cave is one of the major shrines of Lord Shiva
 amarnath ko tirthon kaa tirth kaha jaataa he kyon ki yaheen par bhagwaan shiv ne maan parvati ko amartv kaa rahasy bataaya tha
 The main feature of this place is the formation of natural Shivling in the cave in the snow
 prakritik him se nirmit hone ke kaaran ise swayambhu himani shivlinga bhi kehete hai
 Starting from Ashada Purnima till Rakshabandhan, lakhs of people come here for the holy Himling Darshan to be held throughout the month of Sawan

 On Shravan Purnima it comes in its full size and gradually becomes smaller till Amavasya
 aashcharya kii baat yahi he ki yah shivlinga thos barf kaa bana hota he, jabaki gupha main aamtaur par kachi barf hi hoti he jo haath main lete hi bhurabhura jaae
 Ganesh, Bhairav and Parvati have similar icebergs several feet away from the original Amarnath Shivling
 janashruti prachlit he ki isi gupha main mata parvati ko bhagwaan shiv ne amarkatha sunai thi, jise sunakar sadyojaat shuk-shishu shukdev rishi ke rup main amar ho gayi the
 Even today, a pair of pigeons are seen in the cave, which the devotees call immortal birds
 ve bhi amarkatha sunakar amar hue hai
 There is also a belief that Shiva Parvati, who sees devotees who are associated with pigeons, provides salvation to that creature by taking a direct view of their visions
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne adrdhagini parvati ko is gupha main ek aisi katha sunai thi, jisamen amarnath kii yatra or uske maarg main aane vaale anek sthalon kaa varnan tha
 This story later became known as Amarkatha
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bhagwaan shankar jab parvati ko amar katha sunaane le ja rahe the, to unhone chote-chote anant naagon ko anantnag main choda, maathe ke chandan ko chandanbari main utaara, anya pissuon ko pissu top par or gale ke sheshnag ko sheshnag naamak sthal par choda tha

 There are two ways to go on Amar Nath Yatra

 The route from Pahalgam is considered to be simple and convenient
 baltaal se amarnath gupha kii duuri keval 14 kilometre he or yah bahut hi durgam rasta he or suraksha kii drushti se bhi sandigdh he
 That is why the government does not consider this route safe and motivates most of the travelers to go to Amarnath via Pahalgam
 lekin romaanch or jokhim lene kaa shauk rakhane vaale log is maarg se yatra karnaa pasand karte hai
 People traveling through this route travel at their own risk
 raste main kisi anhoni ke liye bharat sarkaar jimmedaari nahin leti he

 There is a beautiful blue water lake between the ranges

 The route has to cross the Beauvel Top and Mahagunas Pass, which are 13,500 feet and 14,500 feet in height respectively

 This place is named Panchtarni due to five small streams flowing here

 The cold is also more due to the height

 isi din gupha ke najadik pahunch kar padaav daal raat bitaa sakate hai or duusare din subah puja archana kar panchatarani lautaa ja saktaa he
 Some travelers reach Sheshnag by evening
 yah rasta kaaphi kathin he, lekin amarnath kii pavitra gupha main pahonchte hi safar kii sari thakaan pal bhar main chhu-mantar ho jaati he or adbhut atmik anand kii anubhuti hoti he

 The king wanted to know which is the compulsion which is motivating him to commit suicide

 The ascetic said that this condition should be fulfilled
 vah apane liye haath maang rahaa he yaa kisi anya ke liye, yah baat myne nahin rakhti he
 He tried to convince the king that this princess would have to remain a virgin
 jab vikram ne use bataaya ki ve khud hi is yuvak ke hetu kadaah main kudane ko taiyaar hai to tapasvi kaa munh vismay se khulaa rahaa gaya
 They were talking that the princess came there with her friends
 vah sachmuch apsaraon se bhi zayaada sundar thi
 If the youths lost their lives by jumping in a boiling cauldron, then they did nothing wrong

 When the oil started simmering, Vikram jumped into the oil remembering mother Kali
 khaulate tel main kudate hi unke praan nikal gaye or sharir bhunakar syah ho gaya
 Mother Kali took pity on him and ordered the hospitals to bring Vikram alive
 betaalon ne amrit kii boondein unke munh main daalkar unhen zindaa kar diya
 As soon as he was alive, he asked for the princess's hand for Vasu
 rajkumaari ke pita ko khabar bhej di gai or donon kaa vivaah dhooma-dham se sampann hua

 kanoon main, grahanadhikaar yaa lian kisi sampatti ke evaj main die gaye rin shodhan yaa kisi anya daayitv ke nirvaah ke badale main bhugtan ko surakshit karne ke liye hit suraksha kii manjuuri kaa ek prakaar he
 The owner of the property, who grants the lien or lien, is called the liener and the person who gets the benefit of the lien
 anglo-french lian, loyen "bond", "ristrent", latin ligamen se, ligare se "tu bind" shabd vyutpatti kaa mul he
 In the United States, the term lien usually denotes a wide range of fee weights and includes other types of mortgages or fees
 sanyukt rajya america main, lian vilakshan rup se gaiyr-swaamitvkaari suraksha hiton yaa byaaj pratibhutiyon ke liye sanderbhit he 
 In other similar law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of interest securities; Under it, a passive right of retention on the property is obtained until it is free from debt or other liability
 anya deshon main vishuddh rup se pratibhuti byaaj kaa swatv sambandhi rup kehalaata he; iske vipareet USA main is shabd kaa upyog nishchit taur par us samay hota he, jab sampatti par dakhal nahin rahata or tab lian arthath grahanadhikaar nirmukt hota he
 However, in countries with similar laws, it is also identified as a slightly inconsistent type of securities interest, called an "equitable lien", which occurs in some rare cases
 shabdaawalee or iske amal main antaron ke baavjood, USA or saamaan kanoon vaale deshon ke vibhinn grahanadhikaron ke bich anek prakaar kii samanthaayen hai
 Lien may be consensual or non-consensual; Consensual lien is imposed by a contract between the lender and the debtor: asahmatijnya grahanadhikaar khaas taur par adhinium dwaara yaa saamaan kanoon kii kaarywahi se saamne aate hai
 Those laws give the lender the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or movable property by maintaining the relationship between the lender and the debtor
 un grahanadhikaron main shaamil hai Liens are also "flawless" or "defective"
 Flawless liens are those liens for which a lender establishes a priority right over the encumbered property, respecting third-party lenders
 saadharantaya tisare paksh ko lian kii notice bhejkar kanoon dwaara apekshit kadam uthaakar purnataa pramanit hoti he
 The fact is that if a part or part of the property is in the hands of the lender, then perfection is usually established
 jab sampatti rini ke hi haathon main rahati he, tab upyukt karyaalay main byaaj pratibhuti kii notice kii recording jaisi kuch karrwai kar lee jaani chahie
 The perfection of a lien is an important part of the job of securing the lender's interest in the property
 sampatti ke asli khariddaar ke liye doshahin lian vaid he or yahaan tak ki diwalia hue nyaasi ke maamle main bhi, jabaki doshapurn lian nahin bhi ho saktaa he

 kanoon main, aise grahanadhikaar chaar paristhitiyon main vishesh rup se saamne aate hai: Outside the USA, a common law lien is defined in general terms as a passive right to hold movable property conferred by law
 aadhunik paristhitiyon main lagu karne ke liye bagaiyr kisi vaastavik prayaas ke jab koi maamla aitihaasik taur par sthapit ho, tab aadhunik kanoon aamtaur par kanoonee grahanadhikaar ko chhod detaa he
 Tappenden v
 Artus 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ refers to the lien of a "self-service" remedy, such as "other earlier measures such as termination of nuisance, self-protection or eviction of trespassers from the ground"
 Equitable liens are an unusual type of property right, commonly considered sui generis
 vishesh grahanadhikaar or saamaanya grahanadhikaar main vibhajit hai ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar
 ek vishesh grahanadhikaar, jo bahut hi saamaanya prakaar kaa hota he, ko sampatti or pradaan kii jane vaali seva ke bich ek ghanishtha sambandh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Only a special lien or lien can be exercised in connection with fees related to the instant transaction; Also, leni or debtor cannot use the property withheld as security of old debts
 a general lien affects all of the property of the debtor that is in the possession of the lender and guarantees the security of all debts owed by the lender to the debtor
 ek vishesh grahanadhikaar ko anubandh dwaara aam grahanadhikaar main vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he or yah aam taur par kariers ke maamle main kiya jaataa he
 a common law lien gives only a passive right of retention; The same law does not give the right to sell, although some statutes also provide additional rights to sell, and it is possible to confer a separate right through contract
 samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ghanishtha rup se tathakthith "kaaman collings" ke saath sanrekhit hote hai, lekin ve aapas main sah-vistari nahin hote hai
 a common law lien is a very limited type of securities interest
 is sach ke baavjood ki yah kabje kaa sirf niskriy adhikaar detaa he, ek grahanadhikaar hastantarit nahin kiya ja saktaa he; kisi tisare paksh dwaara is par adhikaar nahin jataayaa ja saktaa, jiske kabje main maal he un sevaaon ke liye jise mul paksh dwaara kiya janaa chahie;; or agar chal-sampatti rindaata ko adhyarpit kar di jaati he to lian kii hakdaari hardam ke liye samaapt ho jaati he 
 koi rini jo avaidh rup se chal-sampatti ko bechata he, vah roopantaran kaa jimmedaar ho saktaa he, saath hi lian ke samarpan kaa bhi
 Equitable lien or equitable liens in countries with similar laws have increased unique and difficult issues
 ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kanoon kii kaarywahi dwaara pradutt ek gaiyr-swaamitv vaala suraksha adhikaar he, jo prabhaav main ek samyik prabhaar ke samaan he
 It differs from any charge when it is non-consensual
 yah bahut hi simit paristhitiyon main pradutt hota he, inamen sabase aam he bhoomi kii bikri ke sambandh main; ek abhukt vikreta kaa kharid keemat ke liye bhoomi par ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar hota he, baavjood iske ki kreta kaa sampatti par kabja ho chukaa ho
 ise equitable niyam par ek pratibhaar ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo kharidgi ke anubandhon ke vinimay ke baad khariddaar ko bhoomi par ek laabhakaari hit pradaan karata he
 It is a matter of speculation as to how much of the equitable lien can be extended outside the impregnated seller's lien
 kriyasheel chizon ke shaamil rahe anek maamalon main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar ko roak rakhaa gaya he, lekin chal-sampatti ke sambandh main ab tak nahin
 australian adaalatein vyaktigat sampatti se sambandhit nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar ke maamalon main sabase adhik grahanshil hai 57 ALJR 211 dekhen), lekin ek nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kis par lagaaya jaay isse sambandhit siddhanton kii spashtataa kii kami maamalon kii samiksha main dekhi gayi
 But overall, there is still a lack of central synergy
 haalanki charchaa kiye gaye grahanadhikaar ke rup main tark saadhy na bhi ho, lekin rin bhaar ke do anya roopon kaa bhi kabhi-kabhi grahanadhikaar ke rup main ullekh hota he
 Some statutes provide a passive right to retain property against its owner as a security for obligations
 udhaaharan ke liye, united kingdom ke civil aviation act 1982 kii dhara 88 hawaii adde ko abhukt hawaii adda shulk or vimaanan eendhan ke liye kisi vimaan ko rokane kii anumati pradaan karti he
 Although this right is treated as a lien under UK insolvency law, it is argued that such statutory rights are not actually liens, but these rights are in line with the lien; However some people may say that this is a distinction without any difference
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki ek samjhaute ke dwaara kiya gaya anubandh grahanadhikaar nahin he, jisamen ek paksh duusare paksh ke maal ko tab tak roke rakh saktaa he jab tak ki bhugtan nahin ho jaae, kyonki ek samaan kanoon ke tahat grahanadhikaar gaiyr-sahmatijnya grahanadhikaar nahin ho saktaa
 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki diwalia kanoon ke tahat, aise adhikaron ko grahanadhikaar kii tarah hi liya jaayegaa, bhale hi vah grahanadhikaar kii tarah nahin vyakt kiye jaaen
 Maritime lien is a lien that is awarded on a vessel to ensure the claim of a lender who provides maritime services on the vessel or is injured in using the vessel
 The maritime lien is also sometimes referred to as an informed sight mortgage
 samudri grahanadhikaar anya grahanadhikaron ke kanoonon ke tahat zyaadaatar adhikaar kshetron main ek jaise hai
 The maritime lien is known as "one of the peculiarities of very unique naval law"
 ek samudri grahanadhikaar jahaajon par is prakruti ke pratibhuti byaaj kaa nirmaan karata he jo ek samaan kanoon yaa equity ke liye agyaat he
 This arises purely from the proceeding of the law and exists as a claim on the property concerned, both secret and invisible, which is often preferred over other forms of interest protection registered by the statute
 haalanki ye visheshtaayen vibhinn deshon ke kanoonon ke tahat alag-alag hai, jinhen is tarah varnit kiya ja saktaa he: Around the world, there are a large number of different types of liens and many subdivisions of it
 nimnlikhit sabhi prakaar ke liens sabhi vaidhanik pranali main maujuud nahin hote hai jisase grahanadhikaar kii avadharana ko pahachaanaa jaae

 Parmar dynastic kings ruled from Malwa's capital Dharanagri from the eighth century to the first half of the fourteenth century
 bhoj ne bahut se yuddh kiye or apni pratishtha sthapit kii jisase siddh hota he ki unamem asaadhaaran yogyata thi
 Although most of his life was spent on the battlefield, he did not allow any kind of hindrance in the progress of his kingdom
 unhone malwa ke nagaron va graamon main bahut se mandir banawaye, yadhyapi unamem se ab bahut kam kaa pataa chalata he
 It is said that the capital of present-day Madhya Pradesh was settled by Raja Bhoj, then its name was Bhojpal Nagar, which later became Bhupal and then Bhopal
 raja bhoj ne bhopal nagar ke paas hi ek samudr ke samaan vishaal talab kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha, jo purv or dakshin main bhojpur ke vishaal shiv mandir tak jaataa tha
 Even today, on the way to Bhojpur, near the Shiv temple, a huge sail made of stones of that pond is seen
 us samay us talab kaa pani bahut pavitra or bimariyon ko thik karne vaala mana jaataa tha
 It is said that Raja Bhoj had a skin disease when a sage or a Vaidya advised him to bathe and drink in the water of this pond, which cured his skin
 us vishaal talab ke pani se shivmandir main sthapit vishaal shivlinga kaa abhishek bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Raja Bhoj himself was a very great scholar and he is said to have written books on various subjects such as religion, astronomy, art, lexicography, building construction, poetry, pharmacology etc
 which still exist
 inke samay main kaviyon ko rajya se aashray mila tha
 He ruled from 1000 AD to 1055 AD
 inaki vidwata ke kaaran janamanas main ek kahawat prachlit hui kahan raja bhoj kahan gangu taili
 Bhoja was very brave, majestic, and virtuous
 inhone anek deshon par vijay praapt kii thi or kai vishyon ke anek granthon kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He was a very good poet, philosopher and astrologer
 saraswatikanthabharan, shringarmanjari, champuramayana, charucharya, tatvaprakash, vyavaharasamucchy aadi anek granth inke likhe hue batalaaye jate hai
 His meeting was always decorated with great priests
 inaki patni kaa naam leelavati tha jo bahut badi vidhushi thi
 When the banquet was alive it was said- he; saraswati ko sadaa aalamb mila hua he; sabhi pandit aadrut hai
 ) jab unka dehant hua to kaha gaya - Raja Bhoj was the son of Munj's younger brother Sindhuraj
 rohak inkaa pradhan mantri or bhuvanpaal mantri tha
 Kulachandra, Sadi and Taraditya were his commanders, with whose help Bhoja handled the operations smoothly
 apane chachaa munj kii hi bhanti yah bhi pashchimi bharat main ek samrajya sthapit karnaa chaahate the or is ichha kii purti ke liye inhen apane padosi rajyon se har disha main yuddh karnaa padaa
 Parmar was very agitated after Munj died in a mourning situation and hence Parmar was inspired by the Bhoj Chalukyas to march south with the idea of revenge lane
 unhone ne daahal ke kalburi gangeyadev tathaa thanjore ke rajendra chol se sandhi kii ore saath hi saath dakshin par akraman bhi kar diya, parantu tatkaaleen raja chalukya jaisingh dwitiya ne bahaduree se saamana kiya or apana rajya bachaa liya
 Sometime after 1044 AD, Someshwar II, the son of Jai Singh again turned hostile to the Paramaras and attacked the Malwa kingdom and forced Bhoja to flee
 dharanagari par adhikaar kar lene ke baad usne aag laga di, parantu kuch hi dinon baad someshwar ne maalav chhod diya or bhoj ne rajdhani main lotakar phir sattadhikaar praapt kar liya
 Shortly before 1018 AD, Bhoja defeated a person named Indaratha, possibly a feudatory of the Gang kings of Kalinga
 jaisingh dwitiya tathaa indrarath ke saath yuddh samaapt kar lene par bhoj ne apni sena bharat kii pashchimi seemaa se lage hue deshon kii ore badhaai or pehle laat naamak rajya par, jiskaa vistaar dakshin main bombai rajya ke antargat surat tak tha, akraman kar diya
 King Chalukya Kirtiraj surrendered there and Bhoja held the authority for some time
 iske baad lagbhag san 1020 i
 main bhoj ne laat ke dakshin main sthit tathaa thana jile se lekar malagaar samudratat tak vistrut konkan par akraman kiya or shilaharon ke arikeshari naamak raja ko haraaya
 The Konkan were annexed into the kingdom of Paramaras and the Shilahars as their feudatories reigned here for some time
 san 1008 i

 In 1043 AD, Bhoja sent his fellow soldiers to the king of Delhi to fight against the Muslims of Punjab
 us samay punjab gazani samrajya kaa hi ek bhaag tha or mahmud ke vanshaj hi vahaan rajya kar rahe the
 The Raja of Delhi got help from other parts of India and he traveled towards Punjab and defeated the Muslims and occupied some part of that country for a few days but in the end the king of Ghazni defeated him and lost the lost part again in his empire
 Got it
 bhoj ne ek baar daahal ke kalchuri gangeyadev ke viruddh bhi chadhaai kar di jisane dakshin par akraman karne ke samay uskaa saath diya tha
 Ganga Deva lost but did not have to surrender
 san 1055 i
 ke kuch hi pehle gangey ke putr karn ne gujarat ke chaulukya bhim pratham ke saath ek sandhi kar lee or maalav par purv tathaa pashchim kii ore se akraman kar diya
 Bhoja was making arrangements to save his kingdom that he died suddenly due to illness and the state easily went to the invaders
 uttar main bhoj ne chandelon ke desh par bhi akraman kiya tha jahaan vidyadhar naamak raja rajya karata tha
 But there was no benefit from it
 bhoj ke gwalior par vijay praapt karne ke praytn kaa bhi koi acha fal na hua kyonki vahaan ke raja kachchapaghat kirtiraj ne uske akraman kaa datakar saamana kiya
 It is believed that Bhoja had also conquered Kannauj for some time during the post-transformation period of the decline of Pratiharas
 bhoj ne rajasthan main shakambhari ke chaahamanon ke viruddh bhi yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii or tatkaaleen raja chaahmaan veeryaram ko haraaya
 He then threatened to win a kingdom called Shalit Nadul by the Anhil of the family of Chahmanas, but Parmar was defeated in the war and his chief commander-in-law, Sadi, lost his life
 bhoj ne gujarat ke chaulukyon se bhi, jinhone apni rajdhani anhilapattan main banaai thi, bahut dinon tak yuddh kiya
 Chamudaraja, son of Chalukya Solanki King Moolraj I, had to be humiliated by the arms of Parmar Bhoja in Malwa while going to Varanasi
 uske putr evam uttaradhikari ballabhraj ko isapar bada krodh aayaa or usne is apmaan kaa badla lene kii sochi
 He prepared a large army against Bhoja and attacked Bhoja, but unfortunately he died of smallpox on the way
 iske baad vallabhraj ke chote bhai durlabhraj ne satta kii bagdor apan haathon main lee
 After some time, the BJP also defeated him in the war
 durlabhraj ke uttaradhikari bhim ke rajyakaal main bhoj ne apane senapati kulchandra ko gujarat ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye bheja
 Kulchandra conquered the entire region and looted his capital Anhilapattan
 bhim ne ek baar abu par akraman kar uske raja parmaar dhandu ko haraaya tha, jab use bhagkar chitrakoot main bhoj kii sharan leni padi thi
 As mentioned above, shortly before 1055 AD, Bhima attacked Malwa by entering into a treaty with Kalachuri Karna, but he could not get possession of that region during the banquet
 raja bhoj bahut bade vir or pratapi hone ke saath-saath prakand pandit or gungrahi bhi the
 He produced many texts of many subjects

 Many texts like Saraswati Kantabharan, Shringaramanjari, Champuramayan, Charuchara, Tattvaprakash, Behavansamuchya etc
 are written in this

 His wife's name was Lilavati, who was a great student

He held 10% shares in Sony TV, which he sold in 2012! naanaa sahib san 1857 ke bhartiya swatantrata ke pratham sangram ke shilpkaar the
 His original name was 'dhondupant'
 swatantraaa sangram main naanaa sahib ne kanpur main angrejon ke viruddh vidrohiyon kaa netritv kiya
 
 naanaa sahab ne san 1824 main venugram nivasee madhavnarayan raav ke ghar janm liya tha
 His father Peshwa was the real brother of Bajirao II
 peshwa ne balak nanarav ko apana dattak putr sweekaar kiya or unki shiksha diksha kaa yathesht prabandh kiya
 He was taught the method of riding elephants, swords and guns and also made good knowledge of many languages
 28 janvari san 1851 ko peshwa kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 Nanarao cremated the Peshwa with great pride
 divangat peshwa ke uttaradhikaar kaa prashn uthaa
 The company's government ordered the Bithur-based commissioner to inform Nanarao that the government considered him to be the heir of the Peshwa Dhan wealth and not the title of Peshwa or the political and personal facilities attached to it
 etdarth peshwa kii gaddi praapt karne ke sambandh main va koi samaaroh yaa pradarshan na karen
 But the ambitious Nanarao took all the property in his hand and took possession of the Peshwa's armory
 thode hi dinon main nanarav ne peshwa kii sabhi oopaadhiyon ko dhaaran kar liya
 Immediately he gave the application to the British Government and demanded a justification for the introduction of the Peshwai pension
 saath hi unhone apane vakil ke saath kharita aadi bhi bheja jo kanpur ke colector ne waapas kar diya tathaa unhen suchit karaayaa ki sarkaar unki peshwai oopaadhiyon ko sweekaar nahin karti
 Nanarao Dhupandant suffered a lot because he had to take care of many dependents
 naanaa sahab ne pension paane ke liye lard dalhousie se likhapadhi kii, kintu jab usne bhi inkaar kar diya to unhone ajimullah khan ko apana vakil niyukt kar maharani victoria ke paas bheja
 Azimulla made many efforts but failed
 lautate samay unhone france, italy tathaa rus aadi kii yatra kii
 After coming back, Azimullah made Nana Saheb aware of his failure, the real situation of the British and the freedom movements of Europe
 nanarav dhoondhupant ko angrej sarkaar ke rukh se bada ksht hua
 They were not silent
 unhone isi samay tirthayatra prarambh kii
 Nana Saheb's departure on a pilgrimage in this age seems somewhat mysterious
 san 1857 main vah kalpi, dilli tathaa lakhanu gaye
 In Kalpi, you met the famous Kunwar Singh of Bihar and imagined a future revolution
 jab meerut main kranti kaa shriganesh hua to naanaa sahab ne badi veerta or dakshata se kranti kii senaaon kaa kabhi gupt rup se or kabhi prakat rup se netritv kiya
 As soon as the revolution started, his followers received eight and a half lakh rupees and some war material from the English treasury
 kanpur ke angrej ek garh main kaid ho gaye or krantikariyon ne vahaan par bhartiya dhwaja fahraai
 All the revolutionaries gathered in Kanpur to go to Delhi
 naanaa sahab ne unka netritv kiya or dilli jane se unhen roak liya kyonki vahaan jaakar ve or khatra hi mol lete
 Nana Saheb declared war from Kalyanpur
 apane sainikon kaa unhone kai tukadiyon main baanta
 When all the British were going on boats from Satichora Ghat in Kanpur, the revolutionaries opened fire on them and many of them were killed
 angrej itihaaskaar iske liye naanaa ke hi doshi maanate hai parantu uske paksh main yathesht pramaan nahin miltaa
 
 1 july 1857 ko jab kanpur se angrejon ne prasthaan kiya to naanaa sahab ne purn swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kii tathaa peshwa kii oopaadhi bhi dhaaran kii
 Nana Saheb's indomitable courage never waned and he led the revolutionary armies equally
 fatehpur tathaa ang aadi ke sthanon main naanaa ke dal se or angrejon main bheeshan yuddh hue
 Sometimes the revolutionaries won and sometimes the British won
 tathaapi angrej badhate aa rahe the
 After this, Nana Saheb saw the rise of British forces and crossed the river Ganges and departed to Lucknow
 naanaa sahab ek baar phir kanpur laute or vahaan aakar unhone angreji sena ne kanpur va lakhanu ke bich ke maarg ko apane adhikaar main kar liya to naanaa sahab avadh chhodkar ruhelkhand kii ore chale gaye
 On reaching Ruhelkhand, he supported Khan Bahadur Khan
 ab tak angrejon ne yah samaj liya tha ki jab tak naanaa sahab pakade nahin jate, viplav nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 When the revolutionaries were defeated in Bareilly, then Nana Saheb suffered a lot like Maharana Pratap but he did not surrender before the Firangi and his friends
 angrej sarkaar ne naanaa sahab ko pakadvane ke nimitt bade bade inaam ghoshit kiye kintu ve nishphal rahe
 Truly Nana Saheb's renunciation and independence, his valor and military ability place him on the seat of a prominent figure in Indian history

 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah ise 1969 main nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 It was eventually replaced by the 1973 Constitution, which is still in force
 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan

 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic
 iske alaava, isamen, samta ke siddhant ko bhi pehali baar pesh kiya gaya tha
 By constitution, Iskandar Mirza assumed the office of president, but due to his continued unconstitutional involvement in national affairs, the four elected Prime Ministers were dismissed in just two years
 janata ke dabaav ke tahat, raashtrapati iskundar mirza ne 1958 main takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya; or is prakaar yah samvidhan lagbhag nilambit ho gaya
 Shortly afterwards General Ayub Khan deposed Iskandar Mirza and declared himself President
 or isliye is yah samvidhan keval 3 saal ke liye hi chal paaya
 On 17 February 1960, Ayub Khan appointed a commission to report on the future political structure of the country

 This constitution contained 250 articles divided into twelve parts and three programs
 pichley samvidhan kii tarah hi isamen bhi pakistan ko islamic mulyon par banane kii baat kii gai thi or ekasadaneey vidhayika ko tathst rakhaa gaya tha

 They were empowered to promulgate ordinances and vetoes against laws that could only be disabled by a two / thirds majority of the National Assembly
 haalanki, raashtrapati ne apane karyaalay kii laagat ko chhodkar vidhayika bhang karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 10) Ban on the President The President was not allowed to hold any office of profit in the service of Pakistan, but it was not prevented from holding private property by the management
 11) islamic kanoonkoi bhi kanoon quran or sunnat ke shikshan ke khilaaf paarit nahin kiya jayega or maujuuda kanoonon kaa islamickaran kiya jayega
