 baiju baavaraa hindi bhashaa kii ek film he jo 1952 main pradarshit hui
 It is based on the life of the famous musician Baiju Bawra, although there are significant differences between the film's story and the popular legend Baiju Bawra
 film ke nirdeshak hai vijay bhatta or mukhya kalakaar hai bharat bhushan or minaa kumari
 The film dates back to Emperor Akbar and Baiju Bawra wants to avenge the death of his father from Sangeet Tansen
 tansen akbar ke darbar ke nav ratnon main se ek tha
 Emperor Akbar's order was that no one would sing around Tansen's palace because it disrupts Tansen's practice and if someone made such a misdeed, it would be understood that he was daring Tansen to contest and forced him Music will have to compete with Tansen
 is muqaabale main haarane vaale ko mrityudand diya jaayegaa
 Baiju is a child when Tansen's sentries try to stop Baiju's father from singing and his father dies in a scuffle
 marane se pehle baiju ke pita usase vaada lete hai ki vah unki maut kaa badla legaa
 In the fire of revenge, the boy steals a sword from the group of Baiju soldiers and when the soldiers chase him, a Pandit Sankaranand Manmohan Krishna of the village saves his life and he stays with them where he befriends Gauri, a Sailor girl
 It happens
 bade hote-hote yah dosti pyaar main badal jaati he or baiju bharat bhushan or gauri minaa kumari ek saath kaafii samay bitaane lag jate hai jo gaanv waalon ko acha nahin lagata he
 Baiju forgets the promise given to his father in Gauri's love
 ek din gaanv main daaku aa jate hai or baiju apane geet ke zarie gaanv waalon ko un daakuon ke haathon lutane se bachaa letaa he lekin dasyu sardarani baiju se iske aivaz main apane saath chalane ko kahati he
 For the sake of saving the village, Baiju takes Gauri and leaves with the bandits
 daakuon ke adde main sardarani baiju ko bataati he ki vah darasal ek jagirdaar kii ladki he or uskaa naam he rupamati
 The village where Baiju lives belonged to his father who was taken away by Raja Man Singh and had his father killed
 ab vah isi baat kaa badla us gaanv main daaka daal kar le rahi he
 Upon hearing the word revenge, Baiju remembers the promise given to his father and takes out the princess's sword to take revenge on Tansen
 tansen ke mahal pahunchakar jab vah tansen ko maarane ke liye talwaar uthaata he to tansen kaa aalaap sunakar uske haath se talwaar gir jaati he
 He then lifts the sword and attacks Tansen's Tanpura
 jab tansen usase poochta he ki baiju ne tansen kii gardan ke bajaay tanpure ko nishaanaa kyon banaaya to baiju jawaab detaa he ki tanpure ke sur usko aisa karne se roak rahe the
 Tansen says that Baiju seems to be knowledgeable of some notes and also says that he is not going to die by any sword and if someone indulges in Baiju notes, he will die himself
 yah sunakar baiju asli sangeet seekhney ke liye vahaan se swami haridas kii sharan main chalaa jaataa he or unase nivedan karata he ki ve use apana shishy bana len taaki sangeet sikh kar vah tansen se badla le sake
 Swami Haridas tells him that music practice succeeds not with anger but with love and gives him a harp so that he can start the music practice and accepts it as his disciple
 baiju ke man se badale kii aag to nahin jaati he lekin vah ek shiv mandir main jaakar puure man se riaz shuru kar detaa he or swami haridas par uski apaar shraddha ban jaati he
 One day when he comes to meet Swami Haridas, he comes to know that he is so sick that he is unable to move
 vah unke ashram ke mandir main aisa geet gaata he ki swami haridas charpai chhod mandir kii ore chal padate hai
 Upon reaching the temple, he blesses Baiju and takes the initiative to teach him music
 idhar baiju ke gam main gauri zehar khaane ja rahi hoti he tabhi rajkumaari rupamati aakar usase baiju se milane ke liye chalane ko kahati he
 Gauri meets Baiju and asks to go back to the village but Baiju refuses, saying that he has to avenge his father's death with Tansen and leaves Gauri behind and walks out of the Shiva temple
 tabhi swami haridas aate hai or baiju ko aakiri gurumantra yah kah kar dete hai ki sachcha sangitajna banane ke liye use sachche dard kaa aihsaas hona zaruri he or uske liye use sachcha prem or uske dukh kaa aihsaas karnaa hoga
 Gauri overhears this and bites herself with a snake and tells Baiju that now she will never come in the way between Baiju and her meditation
 gauri ko mara hua jaan baiju badahavaas sa ho jaataa he or baavaraa ban jaataa he, jiske kaaran film ko uskaa naam mila he
 He reaches outside Tansen's palace singing a painful song, cursing the Lord and is imprisoned
 rajkumaari rupamati use karagaar se chhudaane aati he lekin khud bhi pakadi jaati he
 Now Baiju has no choice but to compete with Tansen
 muqaabala shuru hota he lekin haar-jeet kaa faisalaa nahin ho paata he
 Emperor Akbar then proclaims that the one who melts the stone of the Sangarmermar will be declared victorious
 baiju muqaabala jeet jaataa he or badale main teen chizein maangata he ki sangeet se paabandi hataa di jaye, rajkumaari rupamati ko reeha kar diya jaye or uski jafair lautaa di jaye or ant main tansen kii jaan baqsh di jaye
 Then he leaves Akbar's court for his village
 yamuna ke is paar pahunchakar use pataa chalata he ki gauri kii shaadi ho rahi he
 He requests Mallah to take him to the other side, but the Yamuna is flooded and Mallah refuses
 tab baiju swayan hi naav main savaar ho use khene kii koshish karata he
 Seeing this, Gauri from the other shore, who knows how to swim, jumps into the river to save Baiju
 usee samay baiju kii naav palat jaati he or gauri baiju ke paas pahunch jaati he
 Baiju asks Gauri to go back to shore because even after swimming, Gauri will not be able to save Baiju in such a rapid flow
 gauri saafe inkaar kar detii he or donon dub jate hai

 The word slogan, used in English for slogans, is derived from the slogorn, the English and the Irish Gallic sluagh-ghairm
 likhit or drishy se lekar alaape or asabhy tak, naaron main vividhta ho sakati he
 Their often eloquent nature leaves little room for detailed descriptions, and therefore perhaps serves more as a social expression of a unified purpose than as a projection for the intended audience

 He created and developed the geometry of numbers
 unhone sankhya siddhanth tathaa ganitiya bhautikee kii samasyaon ke hal ke liye jyamitiya vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya
 Herman Minkowski's contribution to the development of modern mathematics has been extremely important
 unhone aadhunik falan vishleshan kaa aadhaar nirmit kiya
 He greatly expanded the knowledge of quadratic forms
 unhone ganit ke ek up-vishay kii aadharshila rakhi jise 'sankhyaon kii jyamiti' kaha jaataa he
 It was Minkowski who laid the mathematical foundations of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 minchovsky ne yah samaj liya tha ki oinstin ke aapekshita ke siddhant ko ek a-yuklidia spes main hi sabase adhik acchhee tarah saraahaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, while developing the geometrical implications and strong mathematical structures of relativity theory, Minkowski first proposed a quadratic time continuum by interconnecting the periods and periods considered to be uncorrelated
 dikkaal satatya, jise dikkaal bhi kaha jaataa he, kaa abhikalpan minchovsky dwaara bhautik samshti kii jyamiti ke sanketan ke liye kiya gaya tha jaisaa ki ve aapekshikta baad ke siddhant dwaara sujhaayaa gaya tha
 We know that in Newtonian physics or classical physics, time and time were considered to be two completely different quantities
 parantu, minchovsky ne pradarshit kiya ki aapekshikta ke siddhant kii sankalpana ke kaaran yah ganitiya drushti se aavashyak ho gaya he ki teen spes sambandhi vimaaon-lambaai, chaudaai or oonchai ke saath samay ko chauthe vimaa ko bhi jod liya jaae
 Therefore, Einstein and Minkowski's work showed that in fact, time and time are very closely related to intimacy
 dik or kaal kii ekal chaturvim sattata ko isaki sampoornataa main ghatana samshti athwa minchovsky samshti bhi kaha jaataa he jisamen ekal spes bindu kaa samay ke saath itihaas ek vakr yaa rekha se tathaa dikkaal main simit ek ghatana ek bindu se nirupit hoti he
 These geometrical concepts in the Minkowski society are often expressed as world curves or lines and world points, respectively, and must be distinguished from their analogous shapes in the normal three-dimensional plane
 yahaan yah bhi ullekh kiya janaa chahie ki sthaan evam samay kii ekta kii dharna hendrick lorange ke roopantaranon ke vishleshan main dekhi ja sakati he
 Minkowski first recognized the importance of Lorenz's conceptions of conversion
 minchovsky dwaara dikkaal model kii prastuti se purv oinstin ke aapekshikta ke vyapak siddhant ko oinstin samet sabhi bhautikeevid kaa bhaan unhen nahin tha
 It was Minkowski who studied the mathematical structure and its geometric implications of this new theory

 Both Minkowski and David Hilbert influenced each other's careers

 Both of them went into theoretical mathematics physics
 ve ‘ganit or bhautikee ke bich ek purv sthapit samarasata’ se prabhavit the or unhone ise pusht bhi kiya
 It was also recognized that the use of high-level mathematics is necessary to cover up the mysteries of nature
 yah suvigyaat he ki hilbert ne apane san 1900 ke prasiddh vyaakhyaan main pramukh ganitiya samasyaon kii suchi pradaan karke beesvin sadi ke ganitiya anusandhan prakram ko bahut adhik prabhavit kiya tha
 However, not many people know that Minkowski suggested Hilbert to choose this topic for his lecture
 minchovsky ne ek patr main hilbert ko likhaa thah ‘‘sarvaadhik prabhavakaari vishay hoga bhavishya kaa purvadarshan karaane kaa prayaas, arthath un samasyaon kii ruparekha jinase jujhane main bhavi ganitagyon ko vyast rahanaa chahie
 This way you can ensure that people keep discussing your lecture for many decades to come

 Minkowski taught mathematics to Albert Einstein at the Zurich Polytechnic
 vidhyaarthee ke rup main oinstin ke prati unki koi vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 The only student of Polytechnic he mentioned in his correspondence with Hilbert was Walter Ritz
 kaha jaataa he ki baad ke vidhyaarthiyon ko unhone bataaya tha ki unhen oinstin kaa aapekshikta kaa siddhant ganitiya drushti se anupyukt laga tha
 Herman Minkowski was born on 22 June 1864 in Alexandrov, Russian Empire under the rule of Jar Alexander II

 Minkowski was educated at home until he was 7 years old
 san 1872 main unke mata-pita waapas germany laut aae or konnigsburg main bas gaye
 Minkowski studied at the Elshadische Chase Gymnasium where his junior classmates included Wilhelm Wein and Arnold Sommerfeld, who later became distinguished physicists
 april 1880 main minchovsky ne konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main pravesh liya jahaan anya logon ke saath unke sahpaathiyon main shaamil the : hinarik webar, voldemar voit, adolf hurviz or ferdinand linderman
 He completed three sessions at the University of Berlin, where he was educated by Ernst Eduard Coomer, Leopold Kronecker, Herman von Helmholt and Gustav Robert Kirkhof

 The announcement for this award was made in 1881
 puraskaar kaa vishay kisi purnank ko paanch virgon ke yoga ke rup main nirupit karne ke vibhinn tareekon sambandhi samasya kaa hal talash karnaa tha
 The problem was solved by Einstein in 1847 and he gave a formula to know the number of such representations
 parantu, unhone is baat kii koi vyakhya nahin kii thi ki ve is sutara tak kaise pahunche
 In 1867, Smith solved this problem and presented its subpoena
 paris academy of sciensej ne jab is puraskaar ke liye vishay kii ghoshnaa kii to unhen smith ke kaary kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Smith elaborated his earlier work on the subject

 In 1892, he was promoted to the post of co-principal
 bone main unhone ganitiya bhautikee ke kshetra main kaary karnaa shuru kiya
 The first problem he chose was the study of the motion of solids immersed in ideal liquids
 is samasya par pehle dablyoo
 thomson, kirkhof, claybsk or anya logon ne adhyayan kiya tha
 Minkowski developed a method that could be applied to any solid, regardless of its shape
 bone main minchovsky kii ruchi ganit se bhautikee main adhik ho gai
 He began spending time at Bonn's Institute of Physics, which at the time was headed by Heinrich Hertz
 yahaan tak ki unhone ek prayonshaala paathyakram bhi puraa kiya
 There are reports suggesting that Hertz invited the young Minkowski to dinner
 hertz ke saath minchovsky kaa mail-jol adhik din tak nahin chal paaya kyonki san 1894 main hertz kii mrityu ho gai
 The same year Minkowski left Bone
 yadi hertz or adhik jivit rahete to shaayad sthiti kuch or hoti
 But it had a decisive effect on Minkowski, his interest became in the theoretical journey
 yah tathy note karne yogya he ki hertz yantriki ke nae siddhant san 1890 ke dashak ke praarambhik varshon main banaae the
 While at Bonn, Minkowski also worked on number theory, which introduced a new subdivision of mathematics called the geometry of numbers
 san 1896 main unhone apni sankhyaon kii jyamati kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kiya jisamen unhone sankhya siddhant kii kuch samasyaon ke hal ke liye jyamitiya vidhiyaan viksit kii
 He has explained his findings in his book Geometry of the Geometry of the Geometry of Numbers
 san 1894 main minchovsky jurikh politechnic kii faikalti main apane purv shikshak hurvitz ke saath aa gaye
 Minkowski received a higher salary in Zurich and also had the opportunity to interact with engineering and mathematics students
 unhone politechnic main chah varsh bitaye or vividh vishyon par bhaashan die jo vishleshnatmak yantriki, dravgati, vibhav siddhant, vicharan kalan, sankhya siddhant, falnon kaa siddhant, aanshik avakal siddhant or bijganit se sambandhit the
 While teaching at Zurich Polytechnic, Minkowski wanted to study at the University of Zurich
 parantu unhen isaki anumati nahin di gai
 He was not very satisfied with this situation because he considered the polytechnic as a school "from which complete knowledge of mathematics cannot be obtained
" ’’ Minkowski returned to the university system in 1902, this time he went to Gottingen University
 minchovsky ke liye vishesh rup se ganit kii ek nai chair sthapit kii gai 
 This was an extraordinary task
 yah hilbert ke dwaara minchovsky ko goatingan aamantrit karne main lee gai ruchi ke kaaran hi sambhav hua
 Earlier Hilbert had come to Gottingen at the invitation of Felix Klein, one of the greatest German mathematicians to have formally influenced the development of modern geometry
 clin ne san 1886 main goatingan vishvavidhyalay main ganit kii chair grahan kii thi or goatingan ko ganit adhyayan kaa ek mahaan kendra banane kii muhim main jute gaye the
 To serve his purpose, Klein prepared the authorities to establish another chair in pure mathematics and invited Hilbert to accept it
 hilbert ko pehle hi berlin vishvavidhyalay main ganit kii lajaaras phuk chair ke liye prastaav praapt ho chukaa tha
 Hilbert made up his mind to accept Gottingen's offer with the condition that Minkowski also join him at Klein University at Klein
 clin ke aagrah par prusian shaikshanik adhikariyon ne hilbert chair sthapit karne kaa abhootpurv nirnay liya
 After coming to Gottingen, Minkowski's main concern was mathematical physics
 san 1905 main minchovsky ne hilbert ke saath milakar electron sambandhi siddhanton kii samiksha par ek seminar kaa ayejan kiya
 In 1907, he organized a joint seminar on the equations of electrodynamics
 apane jivan ke shesh do varshon main minchovsky puri tarah vidyutgatiki ke samikarnon or oinstin dwaara pratipaadit aapekshikta ke siddhant ke adhyayan main jute rahe
 Minkowski reproduced the broad theory of specific relativism in terms of the time continuum
 unhone darshaya ki is siddhant ke mukhya nishkarshon ko keval ganitiya niyamon ke aadhaar par vyutpann kiya ja saktaa tha or uske liye prayog karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 Minkowski's presentation gave this theory a level of clarity and superiority that led it to surpass Einstein's original theory
 maiks won lou or arnold jaise suvikhyath bhautikeevidon ne minchovsky ke vichaaron ko or aage badhaaya
 Lau's introductory text book on the comprehensive theory of relativity published in the subject in 1911, coincidentally was the first text book in which Minkowski's formulation was used
 minchovsky ‘four color map kanjekchar’ kaa hal prastut karnaa chaahate the, lekin antat ve isamen safal nahin ho paae
 Interestingly, before commenting on this problem, he remarked that the problem had not yet been solved because only third-grade mathematicians worked on it
 unhone jor dekar yah bhi kaha tha ‘‘mujhe vishwaas he main ise hal kar saktaa hum’’
 But later when he realized that he could not give satisfactory evidence, he said, "the gods have become angry with my ego, my proof is also flawed
 ’’ Minkowski died on 12 January 1909 in Gottingen, Germany
 unki mrityu achaanak hi ho gai
 He was only 40 at the time of his death

 According to Shree Neeradarvana, Savitri was written 12 times by Sri Aurobindo - because with the power of yoga, the revision of Savitri as it rose up in the sky of consciousness became inevitable
 According to Sri Aurobindo, the right path to reach truth is not philosophy, but the path of poetry
 According to Shri Ramdhari Singh 'dinkar' Savitri is not a poetry of merit, no singular poetry is written only on the strength of merit
 In fact, Savitri pranayana is done by sitting with the Sun of the same folk, whose address is a small light particle, which creates the supernatural poetry from the Mahakavis' mind, or what is known, Sri Aurobindo has become united with that sun

 Rawls, in his famous book 'A Theory of Justice', has contradicted the ideas of utilitarians by presenting his theory of justice

 Rawls has argued about justice at the beginning of his theory of justice, that in a good society many virtues are required and justice is also an important place in them

 Bhaskaracharya discusses permutations in Lilavati's chapter titled 'akpash' At number of places which are filled with equal nymbers of digits, place 1, 2, 3, 4 


 in increasing order
 The product of these digits is the required number of permutations
 Similarly, In the given digits, if some digits are repeated, then at those number of places find number of permutations assuming different digits
 Divide by this number, the number of permutations of all given digits, assuming different digits at all places
 Similarly, Mahaviracharya has given the following formula for the total accumulation of some given items in the Mathematics collection
 in order below; the product in the reverse order is divided by the product in order; is the result
 It is noteworthy that several centuries later, in 1634 AD, exactly the same formula was given by Herrigon

 In the second half of the twentieth century, the study of permutation gained momentum and dozens of journals of this subject came into existence and many seminars were held on this subject
