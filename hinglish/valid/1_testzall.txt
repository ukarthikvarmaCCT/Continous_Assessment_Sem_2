 Its story is about two opposite-minded people, Meera and Vivaan, who did not like each other at all, but later both fell in love with each other, but they both could not meet for some reason
 mira dingra ek aazaadee pasand ladki he
 Due to this nature, many marriage proposals are broken, which upset her mother
 vahiin landan main rahane vaala vivaan kapur apni maan kii talash main bharat aata he
 They both meet, but they are not good
 jab mira waapas ghar aati he to vivaan uske hi ghar main miltaa he
 Later it is revealed that he is the owner of that house, Vivaan Kapoor
 mira kii shaadi sumer ke saath tay ho jaati he
 Before marriage, Sumer realizes that Vivaan has a relationship with another girl
 wo sumer ko ye sachai shaadi se pehle hi bataane bol detaa he
 On the wedding day, Sumer runs a fake video on Vivaan and Meera instead of telling their truth, in which they both appear to be in an objectionable position with each other
 is video ke kaaran mira kii shaadi ek or baar tut jaati he, or mira iskaa doshi vivaan ko maanane lagati he
 There are many allegations against Meera
 un sabhi se bachaane ke liye vivaan vahiin usase shaadi kar letaa he
 Although both did not want to get married
 shaadi ke turant baad hi donon ek duusare ko talaak dene ke bare main sochate hai, par har baar kuch na kuch kaaran se talaak ke kagajaat par dastakhat nahin kar pate hai
 Meanwhile, there is a fight between the two on trivial matters every day
 na girane laayak jagahon par bhi mira girte rahati he or vivaan use girane se bachaa letaa he
 At the same time, Vivaan slowly comes to know the truth of his mother
 ek din roma kapur mauka dekh kar vivaan ke car kaa brake kharaab kar detii he, or use aisa karte hue pammi kapur dekh leti he
 Vivan leaves the car before telling her Vivaan
 uske baad mira vahaan aa jaati he or tabhi pammi use bataati he ki roma ne mere bete, vivaan ke gaadi main kuch kar diya he
 Meera comes to know that Mrs
 Singh is Pammi Kapoor
 vivaan kii jaan bachaane ke liye mira us gaadi ke peeche nikal padati he
 To save her life, Meera's fake hair is also removed and Vivaan comes to know that Meera was Saddi Kaur
 mira baad main vivaan ko kahati he ki misses singh hi vivaan kii maan pammi kapur he
 She then gets a call from Roma, who kidnaps Pammi
 vivaan khatre ko dekh kar mira ko ek kamare main band kar ke roma ke bataae jagah pe aa jaataa he
 There she asks to leave Pammi in the property papers in exchange for signature
 isi bich mira vahaan aa jaati he or bandook apane haathon main le leti he
 Meanwhile, Roma snatches the gun and shoots towards Vivaan, but Pammi arrives in the middle and is shot
 jiske baad roma or uske saathi vahaan se bhaag jate hai or vahiin vivaan or mira use aspataal le jate hai
 In the hospital, Vivaan is saddened by his actions, thinking about how he had thought and said so badly about his mother and never believed anything of Meera
 pammi ke thik ho jane ke baad vivaan or amaaya ke saath wo ghar aa jaati he or ghar main mira or uske ghar vaale pammi kaa swaagat karte hai
 Pammi starts talking to Meera's mother that Meera and Vivaan should get married once, with full custom, and all agree
 ve log taiyaari karne lagate hai, vahiin unhen pataa chalata he ki vivaan ke pita kii tabiyat kharaab he, is kaaran amaaya or pammi unhen dekhne ke liye landan nikal jate hai
 While leaving both of them to the airport, he tells Meera that he wants to talk to her and goes away leaving them by saying so
 hawaii adde main unhen chhodte vakt wo bolta hi aaj main mira ko bataa duungaa ki main usase kitna pyaar karata hoon
 While there Meera keeps getting well prepared and keeps waiting for Vivaan

 The Pike Rebellion was an armed rebellion against the rule of the British East India Company in Orissa
 pike logon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ko oriya ekta kaa pratik maanakar baksi jagabandhu ke netritv main 1817 main yah vidroh shuru kiya tha
 Soon this movement spread all over Orissa, but the British mercilessly suppressed this movement

 The freedom struggle of 1857, which is generally considered to be India's first freedom struggle, is being prepared to be converted into textbooks
 Now the Paika Rebellion of 1817, which took place before the revolution of 1857, will be considered as the first war
 Union Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that the Paika Rebellion of 1817 will get a place as the 'first freedom struggle' in the history text books from the next session
 Let's know what is Paika Bidroh
 1817 main odisha main hue pika bidroh ne purvi bharat main kuch samay ke liye british raaj kii jade hilaa di thim
 mul rup se pika odisha ke un gajpati shaashakon ke kisaanon kaa asangathit sainya dal tha, jo yuddh ke samay raja ko sainya sevaayen muhaiyaa karaate the or shaantikaal main kheti karte the
 in logon ne 1817 main bakshi jagabandhu bidyadhar ke netritv main british raaj ke viruddh baghawat kaa jhanda uthaa liya
 The ruler of Khurda was traditionally the patron of the Jagannath temple and ruled the earth as his representative
 He was a symbol of political and cultural freedom of the people of Odisha
 Odisha was also annexed by the British in 1803 after the British Raj took control of Bengal province in the north of Odisha and Madras province in the south
 The Gajapati king Mukundadeva II of Odisha at that time was a minor and the initial resistance by his mentor Jai Rajguru was brutally repressed and dismembered while Jayaguru was still alive
 kuch saalon ke baad gajpati raajaaon ke asangathit sainya dal ke vanshanugat mukhiya bakshi jagabandhu ke netritv main pika vidrohiyon ne adivaasiyon or samaaj ke anya virgon kaa sahyog lekar baghawat kar di
 pika vidroh 1817 main aarambh hua or bahut hi teji se fail gaya
 haalanki british raaj ke viruddh vidroh main pika logon ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi, lekin kisi bhi myne main yah vidroh ek varg vishesh ke logon ke chote samooh kaa vidroh bhar nahin tha
 The tribals and other sections of Ghumsur, which is currently part of Ganjam and Kandhamal district, played an active role in this rebellion
 In fact, the right opportunity to expand the Paika rebellion came when 400 tribals of Ghumsoor entered Khurda, rebelling against the British Raj
 While traveling towards Khurda, from where the British fled, the Paika rebels attacked police stations, administrative offices and the treasury, attacking the symbols of the British Raj
 pika vidrohiyon ko kanika, kujang, nayagarh or ghumsur ke raajaaon, jameendaaron, gram pradhanon or aam kisaanon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 yah vidroh bahut teji se praant ke anya ilaakon jaise purl, pipli or katak main fail gaya
 vidroh se pehle to angrej chakit rah gaye, lekin baad main unhone aadhipaty banaae rakhane kii koshish kii lekin unhen pika vidrohiyon ke kade pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 baad main hui kai ladaaiyon main vidrohiyon ko vijay mili, lekin teen maheenon ke andar hi angrej antat: unhen parajeet karne main safal rahe
 After this, there was a massive phase of repression in which many people were put in jail and also lost their lives
 a large number of people had to face atrocities
 Many rebels fought guerrilla warfare until 1819, but were eventually captured and killed
 Bakshi Jagabandhu was finally arrested in 1825 and died in 1829 while in captivity
 haalanki pika vidroh ko odisha main bahut ucch darja praapt he or bachche angrejon ke viruddh ladaai main veerta kii kahaniyaan padhate hue bade hote hai, lekin durbhaagya se is vidroh ko rashtriya str par vaisaa mahatv nahin mila jaisaa ki milanaa chahie tha
 aisi mahatvapurn ghatana ko itnaa kam mahatv die jane ke peeche kai kaaran ho sakate hai, lekin yah santosh kii baat he ki bharat sarkaar ne is vidroh ko samuchit pahchaan dene ke liye is ghatana kii 200veen varshganth ko uchit rup se manaane kaa nirnay liya he

 internet movie database par nil patric haris Yogavasistha is the most important text of Advaita Vedanta in Sanskrit literature
 isamen rishi vasishtha bhagwaan ram ko nirgun brahm kaa gyaan dete hai
 According to Adikavi Valmiki tradition, the author of Yogavasishtha is considered
 mahabharat ke baad sanskrit kaa yah doosraa sabase bada granth he
 It is also an important book of yoga
 'maharamayana', 'yogavasishth-ramayana', 'aarsh ramayana', 'vaasishth-ramayana' tathaa 'gyanavasishth' aadi naamon se bhi ise janaa jaataa he
 The Yogavasistha has a representation of the inclinations of the world and the Paramatmatta through various parables
 yogavasishth ke tritiy prakaran kaa naam utpatti prakaran, chaturth kaa naam sthiti prakaran tathaa pancham kaa naam upsham prakaran he
 On this basis, it seems that this case is an interpretation of the letters A, u and m of Onkar
 vidvatjanon kaa mat he ki sukh or dukh, jaraa or mrityu, jivan or jagat, jad or chetan, lok or paralok, bandhan or moksh, brahm or jeev, aatma or paramatma, atmagyaan or agyaan, sat or asat, man or indriyaan, dharna or vaasana aadi vishyon par kadachit hi koi granth ho jisamen ‘yoga vaasishth’ kii apeksha adhik gambhir chintan tathaa sookshm vishleshan hua ho
 The importance of this book is further enhanced by the combination of countless fascinating stories along with the experiences of many sages and sages
 moksh praapt karne kaa ek hi maarg he aatmanusndhan
 a unique description of the activities of many saints and great men engaged in Atmanusandhan is given in this book
 yogavasishth main jag kii asatta or parmatmasatta kaa vibhinn drushtaanton ke madhyam se pratipaadan he
 Along with the representation of the effort and knowledge of the elements, it also has a subtle discussion on scriptural virtue, renunciation, ritualism and ideal behavior etc
 isamen baudhon ke vigyaanvaadee, shoonyavaadee, madhyamik ityadi maton kaa tathaa kashmiri shaiva, trik, pratybhigna tathaa spand ityadi tatvagyanon kaa nirdesh hone ke kaaran iske rachayita usee naam ke anya kavi maane jate hai
 Hence there is a difference of opinion regarding the actual author of this book
 yah granth arshramayana, maharamayana, vasishtharamayana, gyanavasishth or keval vaasishth ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 Verse number of Yogavasistha is 32 thousand
 vidwaanon ke matanusaar mahabharat ke samaan iskaa bhi teen avasthaaon main vikaas hua— The Yogavasistha text is complete in six episodes
 isamen shlokon kii kul sankhya 27687 he
 Its 'maharamayana' designation is very meaningful due to the fact that there are about four thousand more verses than Valmiki Ramayana

 Following the Allahabad Declaration of August 1858, after the 1857 War, the British government abandoned the expansionist policy and announced to pursue relations with the princely states under the treaty that had been signed so far
 riyasaton se hue sahaayak sandhiyon ke tahat rajyon par british taj adhipaty tha or rajyon ke videshi maamalon or suraksha ke liye zimmedaar tha
 The treaty gave territorial autonomy to the rulers of the princely state, but this autonomy was only theoretical, in fact, the British had considerable influence and interference in the internal affairs of the princely states

 At the time of India's independence in 1947, the British Government had left all the princely states with 3 options under the "indian Independence Act" to merge with India or Pakistan or remain independent

 mahaar regiment bhartiya sena kaa ek infantry regiment he
 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company

 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Rebellion of 1857], and joined the two regiments The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"

 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 Panini is the largest grammarian of the Sanskrit language
 inkaa janm tatkaaleen uttar pashchim bharat ke gandhar main hua tha
 His grammar is named Ashtadhyayi with eight chapters and about four Sahasra Sutras
 sanskrit bhashaa ko vyakaran sammat rup dene main panini kaa yogadan athulaneey mana jaataa he
 Ashtadhyayi is not just a grammar text
 isamen prakarantar se tatkaaleen bhartiya samaaj kaa puraa chitra miltaa he
 The themes of geography, social, economic, education and political life, philosophical thinking, food, food, living, etc
 were written from place to place
 panini kaa janm shalatur naamak gram main hua tha
 This village was a few miles from the confluence where the river Kabul is found in the Indus
 use ab lahur kehete hai
 According to his birthplace Panini is also called Shalaturya
 or ashtaadhi main swayan unhone is naam kaa ullekh kiya he
 Chinese travelers had come to Shalatur village when Yuvanchuan arrived from the northwest
 panini ke guru kaa naam upavarsh pita kaa naam panin or mata kaa naam dakshi tha
 When Panini grew up, he studied grammar deeply
 panini se pehle shabdavidya ke anek acharya ho chuke the
 By reading his texts and observing their mutual differences, Panini got the idea that he should organize grammar science
 pehle to panini se purv vaidic samhitaon, shakhaon, brahman, aaranyak, upanishad aadi kaa jo vistaar ho chukaa tha us vaanmay se unhone apane liye shabdasaamagree lee jiskaa unhone ashtaadhi main upyog kiya he
 They collected and studied the material of the second nirukta and grammar which was already there
 iskaa pramaan bhi ashtaadhi main he, jaisaa shakatayan, shaakalya, bharadwaj, gargy, senak, apishali, galb or sphotayan aadi aacharyon ke maton ke ullekh se gyaat hota he
 The Shaktaayan was certainly the grammarian prior to Panini, as Niruktakar Yask has written
 shakatayan kaa mat tha ki sab sangya shabd dhaatuon se banate hai
 Panini accepted this view but did not make any request in this matter and also said that there are many words which have come in the lore of the people and they can not catch the metal suffix
 teesri sabase mahatvapurn baat panini ne yah kii ki unhone swayan lok ko apni aankhon se dekha or ghumkar logon ke bahumukhi jivan kaa parichay praapt karke shabdon ko chaanaa
 In this way, he collected many thousands of words
 shabdon kaa sankalan karke unhone unako vargeekrut kiya or unki kai suchiyaan banaai
 There was a list of "metal text" which Panini has set aside from Ashtadhyayi
 usamen 1943 dhaatuen hai
 There are two types of metals in the metalwork - 1
 which were used in literature before Panini and the other which were found in people's conversation
 unki duusari suchi main vedon ke anek acharya the
 Which stage became famous in the name of which Acharya, and under what name were the students studying in it and what were the names of those verses or branches, Panini has given the conclusion of all of them by applying different suffixes; Just like a teacher was Tittiri
 unka charan taittareey kaha jaataa tha or us vidhyalay ke chaatr evam vahaan kii shakha yaa samhita bhi taittiriya kehalaati thi
 Panini's third list was regarding "gotras"
 mul saat gotra vaidic yug se hi chale aate the
 By the time of Panini, they had expanded a lot
 gotron kii kai suchiyaan shrout sutron main hai
 Like in the Bodhayan Shrout Sutra which is called Mahaparavar Kand
 kintu panini ne vaidic or loukik donon bhashaaon ke parivaar yaa kutumb ke naamon kii ek bahut badi suchi banaai jisamen aarsh gotra or loukik gotra donon the
 They are short family names or alleys called Gotravayava
 ek gotra yaa parivaar main honevaala dada, buudhe evam chachaa aadi vyaktiyon ke naam kaise rakhe jate the, iskaa borevar ullekh panini ne kiya he
 Several names of gotras in the ganas, along with the twenty-two sutras, are in the Appendix treatise called "ganapath" of Panini
 panini kii chauthi suchi bhugolic thi
 Panini's birthplace was in the northwest, the region we call Gandhara
 unani bhugol lekhakon ne likhaa he ki uttar pashchim arthath gandhar or punjab main lagbhag 500 aise gram the jinamein se prayek kii jansankhya das sahasr ke lagbhag thi
 Panini has also given the actual names of the 500 villages from which lists of geographical accounts have been made
 graamon or nagaron ke un naamon kii pahchaan tedha prashn he, kintu yadi bahut parishram kiya jaay to yah sambhav he jaise sunet or sirsa punjab ke do chote gaanv hai jinhen panini ne sunetra or shairishak kaha he
 The names of many castes of Punjab were according to the villages where the caste resided or where their ancestors came from
 is prakaar nivas or abhijan in donon se jo upnaam banate the ve purush naam main jud jate the kyonki aise naam bhi bhashaa ke ang the
 Panini stood in the central part of Punjab and made her vision to the east and west
 unhen do pahari ilaake dikhaai pade
 The Kullu Kangra on the east, called Trigart at that time, was the hilly region on the western side that extended from Takshshila, the eastern capital of Gandhara, to the western capital Pushklavati
 isi main vah pradesh tha jise ab kabyli ilaaka kehete hai or jo sindhu nad ke uttar se dakshin tak vyaapt tha or jiske uttari chor par darad or dakshini chor par soubir tha
 Panini made a detailed list of the tribes living in this region and studied the constitutions
 is pradesh ko us samay gramaniya ilaaka kehete the kyonki in kabeelon main, jaisaa aaj bhi he or us samay bhi tha, gramani shashan kii pratha thi or gramani shabd unke netaa yaa shaasha kii padavi thi
 The ruling assembly of these castes is currently called Jirga and in the era of Panini it was called "bratapugh", "sangha" or "gana"
 vastut: sab kabeelon ke shashan kaa ek prakaar na tha kintu ve sangh shashan ke vikaas kii bhinn bhinn avasthaaon main the
 Panini has told from these nouns Vrat and Poog that many of these tribes used to spend their lives by looting or looting, which is still the truth of life there
 us samay ye sab kabeeley yaa jatiyaan hindu thim or unke adhipatiyon ke naam sanskrit bhashaa ke the jaise devdattak, kabeeley kaa purvapurush yaa sansthaapak koi devdatt tha
 Now the names have changed, but it is the same as if the ancestor of the Isaakhel clan was someone named Isa
 in kabeelon ke bahut se naam panini ke ganpaath main milte hai, jaise afridi or mohamad jinhen panini ne aprit or madhumant kaha he
 a list in the geographical lists of Panini is of the districts
 pracheen kaal main apana desh janapad bhoomiyon main baitha hua tha
 In the sub-division of the Vanxu River in Central Asia, Kamboj district, Kutch district of Saurashtra in the west, Surmas district of Assam in the east and Ashmak district on the banks of Godavari in the south, the entire territory was divided between the four peaks and the people
 District development of political and social life and languages went on for thousands of years
 panini ne sahasron shabdon kii vyutpatti bataai jo ashtaadhyagi ke chauthe paanchaven adhyyon main he
 mixing with hundreds of professionals such as Brahmins, Kshatriyas, soldiers, merchant farmers, rangers, carpenters, cooks A, cobblers, cowherds, shepherds, shepherds, weavers, potters etc
 panini ne yah bataaya ki kis shabd main koun sa pratyay lagata he
 The letters that form the vowel and consonant forms of the alphabet are formed from them
 jaise- varsha se vaarshik, yahan mul shabd varsha he usase ik pratyay jud gaya or vaarshik arthath varsha sambandhi yah shabd ban gaya
 The episode of Tadvita in Ashtadhyayi is interesting
 kahin to panini kii sookshm chaanbin par aashcharya hota hai, jaise vyas nadi ke uttari kinare kii bongar bhoomi main jo pakke baramasi kuen banaae jate the unke naamon kaa uccharan kisi duusare swar main kiya jaataa tha or usee ke dakkhini kinare par khadar bhoomi main har saal jo kachche kuen khod liye jate the unke naamon kaa swar kuch bhinn tha
 Panini has said this in the "udta Bipasha" formula
 gaayon or belon kii to jeevanakatha hi panini ne sutron main bhar di he
 While studying the economic life, Panini also checked the coins which used to go in the markets
 jaise "shatmaan", "karshapan", "suvarna", "andh", "paad", "maashak" "trinshatk", "vinshatik" 
 Some people also sold goods from Abla Badli
 use "niman" kaha jaataa tha
 During Panini's time there was a great expansion of education and poetry
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhone bahut hi gaharaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He was thoroughly familiar with both Vedic and cosmic languages
 unheen kii saamagree se panini ne apane vyakaran kii rachana kii par usamen pradhanta loukik sanskrit kii hi rakhi
 They have called colloquial Sanskrit language
 unhone na keval granthrachana ko kintu adhyaapan kaary bhi kiya
 
 panini kaa shiksha vishyak sambandh, sambhav he, takshashila ke vishvavidhyalay se rahaa ho
 It is said that when he had collected his material, he spent some time in seclusion and composed Ashtadhyayi
 panini kaa samay kya tha, is vishay main kai mat hai
 Some call them 7th century BC, 5th century or 4th century BC
 Says patanjali ne likhaa he ki panini kii ashtaadhi kaa sambandh kisi ek veda se nahin balki sabhi vedon kii parishadon se tha 
 This was also the reason for the unanimous reputation of Panini's texts
 panini ko kisi matvishesh main pakshpaat na tha
 The word means a person or caste, in this subject he has considered both sides
 gaoo shabd ek gaay kaa bhi vaachak he or gaoo jati kaa bhi
 The two acharyas, named Vajapayan and Vyadi, urged different opinions, but Panini readily accepted both
 panini se purv ek prasiddh vyakaran indra kaa tha
 In it, the words were thought to be natural or epistemological
 usee kii parampara panini se purv bharadwaj acharya ke vyakaran main lee gai thi
 Panini considered it
 bahut si paribhaashik sangyaayen unhone usase le leen, jaise sarvnaam, avyay aadi or bahut si nai banaai, jaise ti, ghu, bha aadi
 Panini has been called Manglik Acharya
 unke hriday kii udaar vritti mangalatmak karm or fal kii icchhuk thi
 It is a witness to this that he started his Vardushan with the word "old"
 kuch vidvan kehete hai ki panini ke granth main na keval aadimangal balki madhyamangal or antmangal bhi he
 His last sutra has come hraswakaar varnasamanvay kaa mul he
 Panini is also called a well-known Acharya, that is, a friend of all and a certified Acharya
 pantajali kaa kahana he ki panini ne jo sutara ek baar likhaa use kaata nahin
 Each of their letters in grammar is considered proof
 shishy, guru, lok or veda dhatuli shabd or deshi shabd jis ore acharya ne drushti daali use hi ras se seench diya
 Even today, Panini "word: Locke Prakasate", meaning his name is universally published
 ur Their timing is uncertain and disputed
 itnaa tay he ki chhathi sadi isa purv ke baad or chauthi sadi isapurv se pehle kii avadhi main inkaa astitv rahaa hoga
 It is believed that he was born in Shalatula in Punjab, which is close to modern-day Peshawar
 inkaa jeevankaal 520-460 isa purv mana jaataa he
 The quotation of the word Yavanani is used to measure Panini's lifetime
 iskaa arth yunaan kii stri yaa yunaan kii lipi se lagaaya jaataa he
 The direct information about Yavano in Gandhara was not before Alexander's invasion
 sikandar bharat main isa purv 330 ke aasapaas aayaa tha
 But it may happen that Panini will have knowledge of the wild life through Persian sex and Panini may also be in the period of Dara I
 plutark ke anusaar sikandar jab bharat aayaa tha to yahaan pehle se kuch unani bastiyaan thim
 It is believed that Panini must have used some medium to write because the words he used were extremely clean and his analysis without writing seems unlikely
 kai log kehete he ki unhone apane shishyon kii samaran shakti kaa prayog apni lekhan pustika ke rup main kiya tha
 The script was reused in India in the 6th century BC and the first use of the Brahmi script took place in Tamil Nadu in South India, away from Gandhara in northwest India
 gandhar main 6thi sadi isa purv main farsi shashan tha or aisa sambhav he ki unhone armike varnon kaa prayog kiya hoga
 Panini's Sanskrit grammar is in four parts - patanjali ne panini ke ashtaadhi par apni tippanee likhi jise mahabhashya kaa naam diya )
 More than a century ago, the famous German Indologist Max Müller said in his Science of That - "main nirbhiktapurvak kah saktaa hoon ki angrezi yaa latin yaa greek main aisi sankalpanaayen naganya hai jinhen sanskrit dhaatuon se vyutpann shabdon se abhivyakt na kiya ja sake
 On the contrary, i believe that the number of metals desired for an explanation of the entire wealth of the English Dictionary, comprising 2,50,000 words, is less than the paneled metals within reasonable limits
 xxrep 4 
 angrezi main aisa koi vaakya nahin jiske prayek shabd kaa 800 dhaatuon se evam prayek vichaar kaa panini dwaara pradutt saamagree ke saavdhaneepurvak veshleshan ke baad avishasht 121 moulik sankalpanaaon se sambandh nikaala na ja sake
 " panini ke sutron kii style atyant sankshipt he
 He took place in the Sutra Yuga itself
 shrout sutara, dharm sutara, grihasthasutra, praatishakhya sutara bhi isi style main he kintu panini ke sutron main jo nikhaar he vah anyatra nahin he
 That's why Panini's formulas have been called Pratishtana Sutras
 panini ne varna yaa varnmaala ko 14 pratyaahaar sutron main baanta or unhen vishesh kram dekar 42 pratyaahaar sutara banaae
 This is the biggest feature of Panini so that they can fill more material in a small space
 yadi ashtaadhi ke aksharon ko gina jaay to uske 3995 sutara ek sahasr shloke ke baraabar hote hai
 Panini did more concise scriptures, such as taking possession of one or several words of the sutra, ie possession and transcendence, into further sutras so as not to repeat them
 arth karne kii kuch paribhaashaayen bhi unhone banaai
 a very peculiar tactic he derived from imperfect sources
 arthath baad kaa sutara apane se pehle ke sutara ke kaary ko ojhal kar de
 This imperfect law of Panini was his system of mechanism which is not found in any other book of the world

 Panini's work became known in Europe in the 19th century, which had a great impact on modern philology
 aarambh main frenz bop ne panini kaa adhyayan kiya
 Later many compositions of European Sanskrit scholars such as Fernandes de Sauser, Leonard Bloomfield and Roman Jacobsen were influenced
 frits stall ne yorape main bhashaa par bhartiya vichaaron ke prabhaav kii vivechna kii
 Panini and the later Indian philosopher Bhartrihari had considerable influence on many of Ferdinand de Saucer's basic ideas

 The stomach can "taste" sodium glutamate using glutamate receptors and this information is passed through the vagus nerve to the parietal subcutaneous and marginal systems in the brain as a tasty signal
 amashay bhi jeebh or maukhik swaad grahiyon kii tarah swatantra rup se glucose, carbohydrate, protein, or vasa ko samaj saktaa he
 This allows the brain to associate the nutritional value of the diet with their taste
 aitihaasik rup se, vyapak taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki amashay kaa ucch amleey parivesh pet kii sankraman se pratiraksha kar saktaa he
 However, a large number of studies have indicated that the majority of cases of colic, gastritis and gastric cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection
