 Traditionally, most Nairs, especially those belonging to the largest two subdivisions, were not vegetarians, as fish intake was permissible
 lekin swarupatil nair, marr, akatu charna nair, akatu charna nair, puuratu charn nair or padmangalam nair jaisi upjatiyaan sakht shaakaahaari hai

 Sweet dishes like Palpayasam and Ada Prathaman are prepared on ceremonial ceremonies and festive occasions

 The Nairs in Kerala's caste hierarchy are ranked just below Namboodri and three or four major Nair subcastes constitute the strategic dynasty of Kerala

 During the 19th and 20th centuries in India, many social movements by social reformers and spiritual leaders such as Swami Vivekananda, Narayana Guru, Chattambi Swamikal etc
, along with others, demolished the strict caste barriers supported by the Nairs in Kerala
 kerala kii parampara ke anusaar daliton ko majabuuran nambudriyon se 96 fit kii duuri, nairon se 64 fit kii duuri or anya oonchi jatiyon se se 48 fit kii duuri banaae rakhana padataa, chunki manyata thi ki ve unhen dooshit karte hai

 Nairs also felt the need to improve in response to such changes
 Throughout the medieval period and until the 19th century, the Nairs had an outstanding role in Kerala
 19veen sadi ke madhya tak, tathaapi, is prabhutv kaa ksheen hona shuru ho gaya
 Institutions like Sambandham and the matrilineal joint family system, which had earlier ensured the power of the Nair community, now became productive of many evils in the changing socio-political backdrop of Kerala

 The realization of the fall encouraged a reform consciousness that found expression in religious figures like Chattambi Swamikal, literature, press and forums, and later legislative laws such as marriage, inheritance, property rights
 Finally, in 1914, the movement assumed certainty as the foundation of the Nair Service Society

 shakti-santulan kaa siddhanth yah maanata he ki koi raashtra tab adhik surakshit hota he jab sainik kshamta is prakaar banty hui ho ki koi akelaa rajya itnaa shaktishaalee na ho ki vah akele anya rajyon ko dabaa de
 The concept of balance of power has been prevalent in the international stage since about the 15th century
 shaayad isiilie kuch lekhak ise antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa buniyadi siddhanth to kuch ise saarvajanik siddhanth yaa raajnneeti ke moulik siddhanth kii sangya dete hai
 In general terms, balance of power means when one state / group of states increases its power relative to another state / group of states so that it becomes equivalent to it
 parantu is dharna kii paribhaasha ko lekar vidyaman ekamat nahin hai
 Perhaps this is why Inins L
 Claude says that this is a concept that does not have a definition problem but rather that it has many definitions
 in paribhaashaon se pehle yah bataanaa bhi aavashyak he ki yah do prakaar kii hoti hai -saral evam jatil
 Simple or simple power balance occurs when the comparison is directly between two nations or between two nations
 lekin yadi yah santulan do samudaayon ke paraspar tathaa inamen sammilit samudaayon main aantarik rup main bhi ho tab yah jatil santulan kehalaata he
 In this context, scholars have given various definitions which are as follows- prayek raashtra yathasthiti ko banaaye rakhane athwa parivartit karne ke liye duusare raashton kii apeksha adhik shakti praapt karne kii aakanksha rakhata he
 As a result, the structure required is called balance of power
 shakti santulan vah samyavastha yaa antarrashtriya sambandh main kuch maatra main sthirataa yaa sthayitv he, jo rajyon ke bich maitra-sandhiyon yaa anya duusare sadhano kii madad se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 The balance of power is the system under which every state constantly tries to maintain the belief that if states try aggression they will have to resist a group of invincible other nations
 shakti santulan se abhipraay raashton ke pariwaron ke sadasyon ke bich shakti kii nyaaypurna samyavastha se he jo kisi raashtra ko itnaa shaktishaalee hone se roktaa he taaki vah duusare raashtra par apni ichha lad na sake
 Thus, the balance of power has been seen by scholars from different countries
 koi ise shakti ke vitaran ke rup main dekhte hai to koi ise samoohon ke bich samyavastha ke rup main, koi ise sthayitv ke rup main, to koi ise yuddh va asthirataa ke rup main
 This is to say that these definitions lack consensus
 shaayad yah isliye hai ki shakti santulan ke anek arth / prayog hai jis vajah se yah bhranti bani hui he
 Mainly, the balance of power is used in four contexts - quinci rhit ke anusaar shakti santulan kaa siddhanth paanch manyataon par aadhaarit he- The balance of power has the following characteristics: saamaanya rup se yah yathasthiti banaae rakhane kii niti he, parantu vastav main yah hameshaa gatisheel va parivartaneey hoti he
 It is not a divine boon but it is the result of continuous human intervention
 yah vyaktiparak va vastunishth donon prakaar se paribhaashit hota he
 Historians always objectively assess it, while diplomats always subjectively analyze it
 yadhyapi yah shaanti sthapit karne kaa tantra he, parantu yah mushkil se hi kabhi shaanti sthapit karata he
 It is mainly a game of superpowers
 chote raashtra to maatra darshak kii bhoomika hi nibhaate hai
 An operator is needed for its correct operation which is absent in today's era
 yah samyavastha ke aadhaar par shaktiyon kaa samaan vitaran karata he
 But it is known from looking at the history of international politics that there has never been such a time
 shakti santulan kii vyavastha antarrashtriya raajnneeti main shaayad hi dashshtigochar ho, kyonki shakti tatv kaa maapna va sthir kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 www
ncert
com shakti santulan kii sthapana hetu nimnlikhit tareekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he- Sometimes big powers divide the land of small states for mutual power balance
 yah seemaa parivartan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki aapasi shaktiyon main se koi bhi ek duusare se shaktishaalee na ban jaae
 In 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain's land was divided between Bourbon and Hapsburg after the Treaty of Utrecht
 isi prakaar poland ko teen baar main is prakaar vibhajit kiya gaya ki shakti santulan na bigade
 Similarly, in the 18th and 19th centuries, various treaties were made keeping this view in mind
 maitri sandhiyaan bhi shakti santulan kaa pramukh saadhan rahi he
 But when a nation increases its power through Maitra treaties, then other states also become apprehensive and start making treaties with each other
 is kram kaa ant vishwa ke sabhi raashton dwaara virdohi guton main sangathit hokar hota he
 This type of Maitra treaties and the era of Maitra treaties are commonly seen in the politics of Europe
 udhaahranswaroop 1882 ke trirashtriya sandhi ke gathan ke virodh swaroop anya rashtron ke bich bhi virdohi trirashtriya maitri sandhiyon par sahmati hui taaki europe kii raajnneeti main santulan banaaya ja sake
 Similar examples emerged in the form of alliances established between the superpowers after World War II
 shastreekaran shakti kaa pratyaksh evam agratam rup he
 That is why among the states, especially from their rival, there is a competition to store weapons
 is sanchay se unki sainya shakti kaa vikaas hota he tathaa apane virodhiyon par dabaav badhaane ke kaam aata he
 But the other nation or group of states also does not want to be left behind, so both want to balance each other
 udhaahranswaroop, shityudh yug main purv soviet sangh va america ke bich shastreekaran hi donon dwaara ek duusare ko santulit karne kaa madhyam rahaa he
 Along with international political armament, disarmament also sometimes works to balance between the powers
 jab shastreekaran ek charam seemaa ke baad aage badhanaa sambhav na rah sake tab shaktiyaan nirastrikaran kii taraf kadam badhaati he
 As an example, the Salt-1 Salt-2 Start-1 and Start-2 INF Treaty etc
 agreements between the two superpowers are proof of this
 anya raashton ke bich bhi vartmaan samay main shastrakaran se tang aakar vishwasaneeyata badhaane vaale kadamon kaa uthaaya janaa iskaa pramaan he
 Many times the two powers maintain a mutual balance by avoiding any direct confrontation and keeping any one state at the center
 atah aisa kamjor va tatasth rajya hameshaa do badi takaton ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavnaaen tali rahane ke saath-saath shakti santulan bhi bana rahata he
 For example, for a long time Poland remained an intermediate state between Russia and Germany
 afghanistan, rus va england ke bich is sthiti main kaaphi der tak rahaa
 Sometimes two non-allies divide the intermediate region equally
 aisi sthiti main madhyavarti kshetron kaa prabhaav nunatam ho jaataa he
 For example, the partition of Germany, Korea, indo-china
 vartmaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ye kshetra samaapt praaia ho gayi hai
 Therefore, their effect has also become negligible for the balance of power
 hastkshep kii niti hameshaa shaktishaalee raashton dwaara duusare ke maamle main dakhlandaji karke apane prabhaav ko badhaane se he
 Its purpose is in the form of continuation or change of a regime there by the big nation
 is saadhan ke madhyam se shakti santulan banaaye rakhane kaa prayaas hota he
 It was used extensively by both the superpowers during the Cold War period
 purv soviet sangh ne jahaan hungary, checkoslovakia va afghanistan main hastkshep kiya, vahiin america ne grrenada, cuba, nikaragua, korea, iraq, afghanistan aadi main hastkshep kiya he
 The policy of balancing laissez-faire has generally been adopted by smaller nations
 isse chote rajyon dwaara tatastha ke rup main apanaaya gaya he
 In some circumstances, even large nations have resorted to it
 zyaadaatar asia, africa evam latin america deshon ne gut nirpekshata kii niti apanaakar ahastkshep niti kaa paalan kiya he
 Due to this, attempts to not fight or keep it limited or to give it its local form etc
 come under this
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main badi takaton dwaara foot daalo, raaj karo kii niti kaa bhi anusaran kiya he
 Even by dividing the states into two opposing factions, the powers establish the balance of power in that region
 yah niti mukhya rup se britain dwaara apane samrajya ko ekikrut rakhane hetu kaaphi baar prayog kii gai
 The indo-pak partition of 1947 is a strong example of this
 is niti ke antargat apane pratidwandiyon ko kamjor karke santulan banane kaa prayaas kiye jate rahe hai
 In the Cold War period, the superpowers have also followed this type of policy in non-aligned countries
 yadi shakti santulan kaa moolyankan karen to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki is tareeke se shakti par purna simaaen to na lag saki
 Yes, to some extent this theory was successful in its objectives
 is siddhanth ke purna rup se shakti ke vikaas par ankush na laga paane ke nimnlikhit kaaran rahe- It is clear from the above thoughts that this principle is not fully capable of expanding power or preventing power struggle
 lekin iske madhyam se aanshik safalataa avashya milti he, kyonki - pratham, chote rajya apni suraksha aashwast kar sakate hai
 Second, it will also curb the establishment of the hegemony of a large power
 tritiy, yah yudhon ko bhi taalane main sakasham he
 Fourth, in the absence of any central authority over sovereign states, international law is also possible only with the balance of power
 atah yah kuch had tak shakti ke nirankush yaa aadhipaty sthapit karne kii sambhaawanaaon ko aanshik rup main rokane main sakasham he

 a clear mention of this principle can be seen in the main arguments of Viktor Shklovsky's early writing "art as a tool"
 rupavaadi shodh adhyayan karne kaa vah maarg apanaataa he jisamen vidhyaarthee apana lekhan prastut karte hai
 In this way, the language gets the place of the owner writer

 In this way, instead of language, the teacher is in the position of the author

 The main reason for this is the one-sided trend of formalism

 They have also considered an element of poetry such as ritual or ornamentation to be the soul of poetry, but they have not boycotted other elements but have also tried to make them complete by including other elements in their thinking

 pratham mahayuddh ke pehle germany main bodish analeen or soda fabric company ne vyapaarik maatra main haibar prakram dwaara, nitrogen or hydrogen gaison se ammonia gas banane main, sarvapratham ucch daab kaa prayog kiya tha
 Other useful compounds, such as ethyl, methyl and other higher alcohols, phenol, polyethylene, naphtha and high pressure are also used to make petrol from coal or gas
 kranthik taap par kisi gas yaa vaashp ke upar daab badhaane se ek vishesh daab par, jo prayek gas yaa vaashp ke liye bhinn hoti he, vah gas yaa vaashp drav main parivartit ho jaataa he
 This special pressure is called critical pressure
 is siddhant kaa upyog telakupon se mitti kaa tel nikaalane main hota he
 Here at any temperature, the same pressure is applied to the gas or vapor, so that the conversion of gas or vapor into a liquid
 ucch daab kaa upyog nirmaleekaran, pruthakkaran tathaa graphite se kritrim hira banane main bhi hota he
 Pressure has many functions
 yah rasinic santulan ko prabhavit karti he
 The speed of many chemical processes is also accelerated at high pressure
 at: kuch padaarth kam samay main adhik maatra main taiyaar ho jate hai
 Water or other organic fluids remain in liquid form even at high temperature due to high pressure
 saadhaaran daab par yah sambhav nahin he
 In some chemical processes it has yielded particularly beneficial fruits
 nitrogen tathaa hydrogen gaison se ammonia gas kaa bananaa nimnlikhit rasinic sameekaran ke anusaar hota he: According to l'shatleye's chemical-equilibrium-theory, the process in which the volume of producers is less than the volume of the reactants increases by increasing the pressure in the producers
 upar likhe sameekaran se yah spasht he ki nitrogen ke ek aaytan tathaa hydrogen ke teen aaytan ke sanyukt hone se ammonia ke do aaytan banate hai
 Therefore, at high pressure ammonia gas will be produced in greater quantity
 chunki yah prakriya ushmakshepak he, at: nune taap par hi ammonia gas adhik banegi
 Based on these principles, ammonia is made in commercial quantities by the Haber process
 nune taap par anya duusari prakriyaaon kii gati kii bhanti is prakriya kii bhi gati ksheen hoti he
 Hence, commercial quantities are made
 nune taap par anya duusari prakriyaaon kii gati kii bhanti is prakriya kii bhi gati ksheen hoti he
 Thus the pressure of mixing of nitrogen gases in the Haber process to produce ammonia in commercial quantities is 200 atmospheric pressure and in the Claude process, which is used only in France, it is 900 to 1,000 atmosphere pressure and the temperature is 200 ° c to 700 ° c till
 prakriya kii gati ko teevr karne ke liye sookshm louh kan kaa, jisamen molibdinum yaa calcium oxide ke mishran kaa, yaa nikal ke sakshm kan se sansikt jhaanve or sodamide ke mishran kaa utprerak ke rup main upyog karte hai
 The catalyst used today consists of ferric oxide 66%, ferrous oxide 31%, potassium oxide 1% and alumina 1
8%
 400 degree sein
 taap par 3 gramanu hydrogen or 1 gramanu nitrogen ke mishran se 10 vayumandal daab par 3
85%, 100 vayumandal daab par 25
1% tathaa 1,000 vayumandal daab par 79
8% ammonia gas praapt hoti he
 At 4,000 to 5,000 atmospheric pressure, ammonia is 100 per cent without any catalyst
 claude prakram se 900-1,000 vayumandal daab tathaa 700 degree sein
 par 25 pratishat ammonia praapt hota he
 Like ammonia synthesis, methyl alcohol is synthesized by the process of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
 yah prakriya 200 vayumandal daab tathaa 400 degree sein
 par, utprerak alumina, tamra oxide, zinc oxide tathaa chromium ke mishran kii upasthiti main kii jaati he
 High pressure and temperature are 400 ° to 550 ° C, just like methyl alcohol
 However, other higher alcohols are also obtained in industrial quantities by mixing potassium-chromium oxide, or potassium carbonate, with the above catalyst
 ucch daab par prakriya karke phenol aadi kai anya upyogi padaarth bhi taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Morgain, Taylor and Headley found mixtures of several oxides extremely useful as catalysts to speed up chemical processes at high pressure
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : zinc oxid; zinc churna a zinc oxide, zinc a tamra oxide, zinc oxide a rajat oxide; zinc oxide a uranium oxide; zinc-chromium oxide, basic zinc oxide or basic zinc oxide a cadmium karbonate, yaa tamra-chromium oxide, yaa zinc mangenet yaa tungstate, yaa uranet, yaa melibdet, yaa vanedet
 High pressure also affects the physical properties of the substance
 agar claarobenzin or sodium hydroxide ke vilyan par 5,000 pound prati varg inch kii daab di jaae to yah vilyan 360 degree sein
 taap par bhi drav rup main rahata he
 At this pressure and temperature, these two compounds react together to form sodium phenolate
 sodium phinolet ko hydrochloric amla dwaara udasin karke phenol praapt karte hai
 The mutual solubility of these two components increases at high pressure and provides the best conditions for hydrolysis of chlorobenzene
 baraf tathaa phosphorus kii vividh kismein ucch daab par praapt hoti hai
 Some varieties have unusual properties, such as Barf VII at around 30,000 kg per square centimeter of pressure at 100 degrees Celsius
 But it remains solid even when the ordinary ice is 100 degrees Celsius
 But evaporates baraf VI bhi lagbhag 10,000 kilogram prati varg centimetre daab par 0 degree sein
 se adhik taap par bhi thos hi rahata he
 Mwasson was commercially unsuccessful in making artificial diamonds from graphite, but in 1955 AD, the General Electric Company of the United States, and scientists in Sweden succeeded in making cheaper artificial diamonds by keeping graphite longer at high temperatures
 vyapaarik gopneeyata ke kaaran sanshleshan prakram ko vistaar se prakashit nahin kiya gaya he, kintu pi
dablyoo
 brijman kaa anumaan he ki graphite ko 1,00,000 vayumandal daab se bhi adhik daab par rakhkar, 2,500 degree se lekar 3,000 degree sein
 par kai ghante tak garam karne se kritrim hira banataa he
 The diamond obtained in this way is smaller in size and yellowish crystal than the natural diamond and the cost is much higher than the value it is estimated
 ucch daab par rasinic tathaa bhautik prakriyaaon ke adhyayan ke liye jin dhaatuon ke paatr banaae jate hai, ve ooshmaa pratirodhi hote hai
 500 degree centimeters Up to and including chromium, or chromium vanadium steel, and at higher temperatures

 san 1921 se 23 ke bich janendra ne apni mata kii sahaayta se vyapaar kiya, jisamen inhen safalataa bhi mili
 But in 23 he moved to Nagpur and started working as a correspondent in political papers there
 usee varsh inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or teen maah ke baad chhot gaye
 On returning to Delhi, he separated himself from the business
 jeevika kii khoj main ye kalkatte bhi gaye, parantu vahaan se bhi inhen niraash hokar lautnaa padaa
 After this, he started writing
 24 disambar 1988 ko unka nidhan ho gaya

 Zainendra was a unique explorer of his path
 unhone premachand ke saamaajik yatharth ke maarg ko nahin apanaaya, jo apane samay kaa rajmarg tha
 But he was not the antonym of Premchand, as many critics have proved; He was a complement to Premchand
 premachand or jainendra ko saath-saath rakhkar hi jivan or itihaas ko uski samagrata ke saath samajha ja saktaa he
 Jainendra's greatest contribution was in the creation of Hindi prose
 bhashaa ke str par jainendra dwaara kii gai tod-phod ne hindi ko taraashne kaa abhootpurv kaam kiya
 The prose of the unknowable would not have been possible if Jainendra's prose were not there
 hindi kahani ne prayogshiltaa kaa pehla paath jainendra se hi siikhaa
 Zainendra gave Hindi a transparent language and break, gave a new tone, a new `syntax '
 aaj ke hindi gadhy par jainendra kii amit chhap he
 - Ravindra Kalia has come out of the inclusion of philosophical and metaphysical elements in almost all the novels of Zainendra, but wherever these elements are included in the novels, they seem to create a difference of characters
 yahi kaaran he ki janendra ke paatr bahya vaataavaran or paristhitiyon se aprabhavit lagate hai or apni antarmukhi gatiyon se sanchalit
 Their reactions and behavior are also often in line with these motions
 isi kaa ek parinaam yah bhi hua he ki janendra ke upanyaason main charitron kii bharmaar nahin dikhaai detii
 The lack of characters has also led to the prominence of individual elements in Zainendra's novels
 krantikarita tathaa aatankvadita ke tatv bhi janendra ke upanyaason ke mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 The leading male characters in all his novels believe in a strong revolution
 bahya swabhaav, ruchi or vyavhaar main ek prakaar kii komalta or bhirutha kii bhaavana liye hokar bhi ye apane antar main mahaan vidhvansak hote hai
 This subversive personality of hers is created as a result of her reaction to the romantic disapproval of the woman
 isi kaaran jab ve kisi nari kaa thodaa bhi aashray, sahanubhuti yaa prem pate hai, tab tuutakar gir padate hai or tabhi unka bahya swabhaav komal ban jaataa he
 Janendra's female characters are often prominent in the novel
 upanyaaskaar ne apane nari paatro ke charitra-chithran main sookshm manovaigyanik drushti kaa parichay diya he
 Jainendra has been able to credibly mark the diverse forms of women, her abilities and reactions
 'sunita', 'tyaagptr' tathaa 'sukhada' aadi upanyaason main aise anek avasar aae hai, jab unke nari charitra bheeshan maansik sangharsh kii sthiti se guzare hai
 The feeling of incompleteness and interdependence of woman and man is the basic basis of this struggle
 vah apane prati purush ke aakarshan ko samajhati he, samarpan ke liye prastut rahati he or poorak bhaavana kii is kshamta se aalhadit hoti he, parantu kabhi-kabhi jab vah purush main is aakarshan moh kaa abhaav dekhati he, tab kshubdh hoti he, vyathit hoti he
 In the same way, when it comes to expectation of harshness from a man, it also becomes unbearable
 vrindavan main sthit yah isckon mandir angrejon kaa mandir ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 ISKCON - International name for Krishna Jagran, which was founded by Swami Prabhupada ji
 kesaria vastron main hare rama–hare krishna kii dhun main tamaam videshi mahila–purush yahan dekhe jate hai or unheen kii upasthiti kii vazah se is mandir ko angrajon ke mandir kaa naam mila
 It has gorgeous and quite beautiful idols of Radha Krishna

 This latitude is related to the Earth's axial inclination
 kark or makar rekhaon main ek saurya varsh main ek baar or inke bich ke puure kshetra main ek saurya varsh main do baar suraj thik sir ke upar hota he
 a large part of the world's population lives in this region and it is estimated that due to the increasing population, this population will only increase further
 yah prithvi kaa sabase garm kshetra he kyonki prithvi ke aksheeya jhukaav ke kaaran surya kii adhiktam ooshmaa bumadhya rekha or uske aas-paas ke ilaake par kendrit hoti he
 Although the general opinion is that the tropical region is a warm region which is always raining and green, but the reality is not like this
 yahan aise kai kshetra hai jahaan par kushk or nam mausam paae jate hai
 Humid weather occurs when the area receives the maximum rainfall of the year average
 isko paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye harith ritu kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he
 The moist areas are spread throughout the warm and sub-tropical regions
 nam maheenaa vah hota he jisamen 60 mi
me
 yaa adhik varsha ho
 Dry and humid weather is not found in the tropical forests as it receives uniform rainfall throughout the year
 aamtaur par varsha ritu kushk garm mausam ke ant main shuru hoti he
 In some areas, it rains so much that there is flooding which causes soil erosion and soil fertility also decreases
 is kshetra ke adhikansh jaanwaron ke liye yah bahutayat kaa mausam hota he or unka prajnan kaal isi se sambaddh rahata he
 The world's deadliest diseases are also abundant in this region
 kyonki yahan kaa vaataavaran machharon ke panpane ke liye bhi anukool hota he isliye yahan machhar-sambandhi bimaariyaan bhi bahut adhik hoti hai
 Many diseases are not found in other areas
 jab ek hi tatv kai roopon main miltaa he to tatv ke is gun ko aparupata kehete hai or uske vibhinn roopon ko us tatv kaa ghan sanrachana aparup kehete hai
 For example, various forms of carbon are diamond, graphite, coal, coke, charcoal or wood, astikoyala, kajal, carbon black, gas carbon and petroleum coke, and sugar coal, etc
 carbon ke atirikt oxygen, gandhak, phosphorus aadi bhi aparupon main paae jate hai
 Appellations are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit vastly different physical properties and chemical behavior
 bahurupi roopon ke bich parivartan kuch vishesh karkon arthath daab, prakaash va taap ke prabhaav se shuru hota he
 Therefore, the stability of particular designs depends on the particular conditions

 Simlipal National Park is a national park located in the Mayurbhanj Scheduled District of Odisha state of India and is an elephant sanctuary
 is udyaan kaa naam simal yaa laal kapaas ke pedo kii vajah se padaa he jo yahan bahutayat main paye jate hai
 The park is spread over an area of 845
70 sq km and has beautiful waterfalls like Joranda and Barehipani
 is udyaan main 99 baagh, 432 haathiyon ke alaava gaur tathaa chousinge bhi vaas karte hai
 This hunting spot of the erstwhile rulers of Mayurbhanj State, located in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, has been included under Project Tiger
 1956 main iskaa chayan aadhikarik rup se tiger rigerv ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Located 60 km from Baripada, it was declared as a wildlife sanctuary spread over an area of 2277
07 square kilometers
 ghaney jangalon, jharanon or pahadiyon se samrudh is park main vividh vanyajeevon ko najadik se dekha ja saktaa he
 Tigers, deer, elephants and many other animals are found in this park
 manovishleshan ke janmdata doctor sigmund frid ne putr kii apni mata ke prati kamvasana kii granthi ko idipas granthi kii sangya di
 According to Freud, this story of Oedipus is a symbolic representation of a gland of sex hidden within every human being
 manushya kii pratham kamvasana kaa lakshya mata or pratham hinsa or ghrinaa ke bhav kaa lakshya pita hota he
 He addressed this sexual desire in the name of Eidipus gland
 manushya ke jivan par iske prabhaavon kii charchaa karte hue inhone kaha ki yahi granthi hamaare naitik, dharmik or saamaajik niyamon tathaa pratibandhon kii prishthbhumi main karyrat he
 The feeling of sin and guilt was born from it
 apane ko kisi prakaar kaa swat: aghat pahunchaane, aatmahatya karne yaa apane ko swat: dandit karne ke bhav isi ke karanvash utpann hote hai
 According to them, this gland is at the root of human development because at the beginning of development, humans first imposed only two restrictions on themselves
 pehla, apane janmdata yaa pita kii hatya na karnaa or doosraa, apni janani yaa mata se vivaah na karnaa
 These are the first two moral and religious rules
 kisi bhi prakaar kii maansik vikrutavastha or mukhyatya manodaurbalya kaa bhi mul kaaran inhone idipas manogranthi ko mana
 His statement was that this gland is found in both normal and abnormal persons, the only difference being that one has conquered it and is therefore normal while the other is his slave and therefore he is abnormal
 vibhinn samoohon, jatiyon or samaajon ke aapasi matbhed tathaa sangharsho kaa mul kaaran bhi unke apane mata-pita ke prati sthapit pratyayon kii bhinnata hi he, aisa inkaa vichaar tha
 He also considered the 'eidipus gland' as the reason for the existence of contrary feelings of love and hatred towards the same object
 hamaara samvegatmak jivan, moulik rup main, ek hi vastu ke prati is prakaar ke vipareet bhaavon ke samavesh se aparichit tha
 Firstly, such expressions probably originate from our emotional relations with the parents because their predominant form is found only in the feelings towards the parents
 mata ke prati prem or pita ke prati ghrinaa ke bhaavon ko kabhi kabhi dhanatmak idipas granthi tathaa pita ke prati prem or mata ke prati ghrinaa ko rinatmak idipas granthi kaha jaataa he
 One form of this gland is also found in the daughter's sense of sexuality towards her father, which is called the Elektra gland
 frid ke is kathan ke virodh main ki idipas granthi saarvbhaumik he, iskaa aadhaar janmajaat he tathaa yah ek hi swaroop main har manushya main pai jaati he, nav-frydiya tathaa anya aadhunik siddhanton ne kaha ki iskaa aadhaar samskruti mana jaataa he, yahi iske swaroop kaa vibhinn vyaktiyon main nirdhaaran karti he
 According to Fenichal, one's own family experiences determine the origin and actual nature of this gland
 aidler ne is granthi ko moulik yaa janmajaat nahin mana varan usne kaha ki yah mata ke adhik laad pyaar kaa aprakritik parinaam he
 According to Jung, this gland represents a symbolic representation of man's original desire for rebirth, that is, man's original desire is to return to his birthplace
 rank ne jung kii is kaalpanik udaan ko sweekaar karte hue bhi yah kaha tha ki is granthi kaa saar balak ke apane mata pita ke prati sampurna sambandhon main he
 While acknowledging the importance of family ties, Harney described it as based on two conditions
 pehali paristhiti mata pita kii uttejk kamvasanaye hai or duusari, dusron par ashrith rahane kii aavashyaktaaon tathaa mata-pita ke prati hinsaatmak bhaawanaaon ke maansik dwandv se utpann chintaa kii sthiti he
 Fromm has considered the spirit of patriarchal societies to be empowered by not considering sex as the basis of this struggle among the fathers
 salivan, tamson aadi anya vidwaanon ne bhi parivaar ke antargat parsparik sambandhon ko hi is granthi kaa aadhaar mana he
 a quality of blood oxidation blood is that it absorbs oxygen, transmits it to various organs and tissues where it is used
 is prakaar jeevon ke rudhir main avashoshit oxigen kii thodi maatra rahati hi he
 The average magnitude of blood oxygen can be reduced sufficiently under certain conditions, this stage of blood oxygenation
 is avasthaa main rudhir main oxigen kaa aanshik dabaav avanamit ho jaataa he
 When the partial pressure of oxygen is degraded, the saturation of oxygen in arterial blood also decreases
 jab bhi kinhin kaarnon se fefdon main rudhir kaa uchit oxijnikaran avaruddh ho jaataa he, yah avasthaa utpann hoti he
 The following situations produce: saans lenevaali hawa main oxigen kaa nunikrut dabaav, Lung diseases that block gaseous exchange and spasht andakaar randhra ke kaaran janmajaat hridrog
 When man flies upwards, the pressure of oxygen decreases gradually and a situation of height can occur when he cannot get enough amount of oxygen
 isliye atirikt oxigen kii purti ke liye oxigen ke paatr saath le jaae jate hai
 Humans suffering from certain diseases, due to lack of pleural tissue, are unable to absorb the dissolved oxygen, thereby not saturating the blood by the normal amount of oxygen
 is kshati kii purti ke liye shwasandar kii sankhya bad jaati he
 Congenital heart disease - In this, the blood of the left heart gets mixed with the blood of the right heart and thus the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix, causing proper circulation and saturation in the lungs and this condition occurs
 ab ham is rog se grast jeevon ke sharirastha rudhir ke rasayan par vichaar karenge
 The illustrative image presented is to illustrate the facts
 chitra main dhamni rudhir or shirarudhir kii oxigen santrupti, saamaanya sthiti or rakt oxikshinta kii sthiti main dikhaai gai he
 The black part of each column represents the percentage of hemoglobin that is reduced in the blood and the white part is the oxyhemogoglobin
 saamaanya sthiti main vyakti ke rudhir kii praarambhik oxigen dharita ek si thi
 Arrows indicate the coefficient of oxygen utilization, ie the volume of oxygen removed from one unit of blood by the tissue
 ham yah maanakar chale hai ki manushya oxigen ke avanamit dabaav vaale vayumandal main saans letaa he
 In normal faith, blood in the direction of blood oxidation can be considered in the blood coming out of the lungs, which 100 ml contains 15 ml oxygen
 5 pratishat utakon ke upyog main aata he or at: shirarudhir ke prati sau ghan centimetre main 10 ghan centimetre oxigen rah jaataa he
 Arterial and venous unsaturations are 5 and 10 cubic centimeters respectively, and capillary unsaturation will be the mean, that is, 7
5 percent volume will produce this blackness
 is prakaar shyaamata rakt oxikshinta kaa ek lakshan he
 a minimum of 5 grams of reduced hemoglobin should be present in 100 ml capillary blood to produce blackness
 shyaamata kii dasha main twachaa kaa rang badal kar nilabh ho jaataa he
 This change is evident from the lips, ears, hands, feet, and nails
 rudhir ke oxigen dabaav kaa hraas lagbhag sabhi angon se, jaise hriday, fefde, yaa paad se, lasika pravaah ko badha detaa he
 In this situation, some other things also become clear
 rogi kaa hriday dar bad jaataa he, vah du:shwasagrast ho jaataa he or haanfne lagata he evam use ullas, sangyaheenata, unmaad or sthir vichaar ke rup main maansik vikshobh bhi hota he
 Whenever there is a lack of oxygen in the blood, the tissues start getting less oxygen
 aisi sthiti main oothkakshati hoti he
 The tissues of the central nervous system and vasculature are most susceptible to this type of damage
 jab bhi keshikaon kii ant:kalaayen kshatigrast hoti he, unamem se taral baahar kii ore ris padataa he or parisancharan se taral kii haani hoti he
 The intensity of effects on the body in blood oxidation is influenced by the contingency of the attack of blood oxidation, the same amount, duration and normal physiologic state of the body
 yadi raktaoxikshinta bahut ugr rup na dhaaran kare, yaa adhik samay tak bani na rahe, to hrideey utpaadan bahut bad jaataa he
 If the condition persists for a long time or becomes agitated, then the cardiac output decreases gradually due to the detrimental effect on the hepatic level
 chunki yah dasha oxigen kii kami ke kaaran hoti he, at: oxigen-chikitsa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Before using oxygen, it is very important to know whether the patient is fit for oxygen use
 yah kuch tathyon par nirbhar karata he
 If a completely avascular part is present in the oval region or lungs, the patient does not get the desired benefit from oxygen inhalation
 andakaar rudhir kii upasthiti ke kaaran parshvapathit rudhir kii kshatipurti ke liye swasth or suvaatit koopika kii purti karanevaala rudhir atirikt oxigen kaa mahatvapurn pariman avashoshit na karegaa
 In bronchoal or pulmonary pleurisy, part of the lung does not work and consequently blood oxidation occurs
 batsfiti, phupfusshoth or gas vishaaktata main oxigen prayeg bahut safal siddh hota he
 Due to the lack of oxygen, the penetration of the pleural epithelium increases towards the liquid and becomes acutely inflamed
 at: shoth rakt oxikshinta prerit karata he or rakt oxikshinta se shoth ko badhaava miltaa he
 This vicious cycle can be broken using oxygen
 drut or uthle shwasan ke kaaran utpann rakt oxikshinta main oxigen prayog se raahat milti he, kyonki usase anshat: sanvaatit alvioli kaa oxigen tanaav bad jaataa he
 Shallow respiration can persist for some time, mainly due to localized actions inside the lung acting at the ends of the nerve and not due to blood oxygenation
 uthlaa shwasan chunki oxigen kii kami se or bhi gambhir rup letaa he, at: isamen oxigen upachaar laabhprad siddh hota he
 So, in short, blood oxidation is the condition in which the partial pressure of oxygen located in the blood is degraded
 yah fefde ke rudhir ke uchit oxijnikaran main baadha denevaali sabhi avasthaaon main utpann hota he
 This condition can be cured by oxygen use in almost all situations, if no bio-cause is present
 sharir ke vibhinn ang vibhinn roopon main prabhavit hote hai
