 Sardesai was an influence on addicted historians and other Marathi thinkers
 Instead of saying the effect, these people were presenting the revision of 'colonial History'
 The most important thing was that the caste-tribe movements pushed backward and marginalized were in full swing, their literature was coming out in a big way
 This situation was being discussed in Solapur
 The politics of the riots had started from 1981-82 onwards
 In 1969 the rioting wave had come and gone
 Riots were being instigated

 Since the 12th century, around 42 Muslim saints have written literary works in Marathi

 As a result, in 1990, the first All India Muslim Marathi Sahitya Sammelan was held in Solapur
 So far, more than a thousand Muslim writers are writing compositions in Marathi
 Today Muslim Marathi accounts speak about Muslim community issues like illiteracy, unemployment, polygamy and children's rights

 safal traasadee virechan dwaara karunaa or traas ke bhaavon ko udbud karti he, unka saamanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 Decontamination does not only cause emotional relaxation, it also has emotional refinement
 is tarah arastu ne kala or kavy ko prashansaneey, grahya or sayas rakshneey siddh kiya he
 Aristotle made a successful attempt to restore the importance of art and poetry through this principle
 arastu ke guru plato ne kaviyon or kalakaaron ko apane adarsh rajya ke baahar rakhane kii sifarish kii thi
 He believed that poetry is helpful in nurturing and inciting our lusts and is therefore condemnable and discordant
 dharmik or ucch koti kaa naitik sahitya iskaa apwaad he kintu adhikansh sahitya is adarsh shrenee main nahin aata he
 The importance of the theory of arbitration is multiple
 pratham to yah he ki usne plato dwaara kavy par lagaae gaye akshep kaa niraakaran kiya or doosraa yah ki usne gat kitne hi varshon ke kavyashastreey chintan ko kisi-na-kisi rup main avashya hi prabhavit kiya
 'virechan' is the Hindi version of Greek Katharsis
 unani chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘catharsis’ or bhartiya chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘virechan’
 Its meaning is the purification of physical disorders i
e
 abdominal disorders by interesting medicine
 swasthya ke liye jis prakaar shaareerik mel kaa nishkasana-shodhan aavashyak he, usee prakaar irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, moh or krodh aadi maansik malon kaa nishkasana evam shodhan aavashyak he
 Aristotle uses the term 'catharsis' to symbolically inaugurate the impact of the tragedy on the human mind
 traasadee ke prati plato kii aapatti thi- ‘‘vah maanav kii vaasanaon kaa daman karne ke sthaan par unka poshan or sinchan karti he
 It creates chaos in the soul by raising the lower elements instead of the higher elements
 ’’ Aristotle refuted this invasion of Plato by the catharsis theory and established the utility of tragedy
 plato ne jise dosha siddh kiya tha, arestu ne usee ko gun ke rup main prastut kiya
 Aristotle's opinion is- arthath traasadee kisi gambheer swatah purna tathaa nishchit aayam se yukt kaary ko anukriti kaa naam he
 


 Whose mentality is properly discussed by the apostle from the compassion tragedy
 isi prakaar traasadee keval avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon ko hi uddipt nahin karti, apitu karunaa or traas ke kritrim udrek dwaara maanav ke vaastavik jivan kii karunaa or traas kii bhaawanaaon kaa nishkasana karti he
 Virechan is mentioned only in two places in Aristotle's compositions
 pratham ullekh uske ‘poytics’ granth main, jahaan tragedy ke swaroop kii ore sanket kiya gaya he or doosraa ‘raajnneetik’ naamak granth main jahaan unhone sangeet kii upyogita pratipaadit kii he
 At these places, he has discussed the form of the word Virechan and its form
 arestu kaa kathan he- ‘‘sangeet kaa adhyayan ek nahin varan anek uddeshyon kii siddhi ke liye hona chahie, arthath shiksha ke liye virechan ke liye
 Music also brings intellectual joy
 xxrep 5 
 dharmik raagon ke prabhaav se ve shant ho jate hai, maanon unke aavesh kaa shaman or virechan ho gaya ho
 Thus purgation means purification
 arestu ke ye vichaar traasadee-vivechan ke sandarbh main footkar rup main milte hai
 They have not been edited in a particular orderly fashion
 aadhunik yug main arestu ke simit or alp shabdon ne purna kavy-shastreey siddhanth kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 So a question naturally arose that what did Aristotle originally mean by the motives and catharsis of compassion and tragedy? In this context, the later interpreters of Aristotle presented different meanings and interpretations of the interpretation
 arestu ke vyakhyakaaron main pro gilbert mare or livi ne virechan kii dharmaparak vyakhya prastut kii he
 Religious meaning has a particular background
 iskaa sambandh dharmik utsavon se he
 Prof
 Gilbert Murray states that - "the celebration of the deity of Deonusus in Greece was a symbol of purification in itself, in which liberation from past times and sins and death-consoles
 is prakaar bahya vikaron dwaara aantarik vikaron kii shanti kaa yah upaay arestu ke samay main dharmik sansthaaon main kaaphi prachlit tha
 They have used it figuratively on the basis of this and purgation means "spiritual purification and peace through external stimulation and ultimately its mitigation
" ’’ a German scholar named Barnez gave a strategic interpretation of Virechan
 uske anusaar maanav-man anek manovikaron se akraant rahata he
 Karun and fear are basically sadistic emotions
 traasadee rangamanch par avastavik paristhitiyon dwaara inhen atiranjit rup main prastutkar kritrim aspasht upayon se prekshak ke man main vaasana rup main sthit in manovegon ke desh kaa niraakaran or uske parinamswaroop maansik saamanjasy kii sthapana karti he
 Therefore, purgation has a strategic meaning - mitigation of excitement after stimulation of psychologists and mental mental vividness
 vartmaan manovigyaan tathaa manovishleshan shaastra bhi is arth kii pushti karte hai
 Being a practitioner of mental health, this method is considered ethical
 gete or angreji ke svachhndatavaadi kavi aalochakon main virechan ke kalaparak arth ke sanket milte hai
 Aristotle's famous interpreter Prof
 Butcher is of the opinion that ecclesiology is not merely a sign of a particular fact of psychology or diagnostics, but an expression of an art-theory
 is prakaar traasadee kaa karttavya-karm keval karunaa yaa traas ke liye abhivyakti kaa madhyam prastut karnaa hi nahin apitu inhen ek sunishchit kalatmak parithosh pradaan karnaa he
 They have to be refined and clarified in the medium of art
 virechan kaa arth yahan vyapak he- maansik santulan iskaa purv bhaag maatr he, parinti uski kalatmak parithosh kaa parishkar hi he jiske bina traasadee ke kalaagat aswaad kaa vrutt puraa nahin hota
 The question arises that which of the above three meanings is closest to Aristotle's view? Although Aristotle is naturally influenced by the then religious conditions and Aristotle himself has indicated towards religious music that just as religious music stimulates the audience's emotions and restores, so does the fear of the tragedy observer and the feelings of compassion Wakes up and subjugates them later
 traasadee ke sambandh main yah mat aksharshah thik nahin he, kyonki sangeet dwaara thik kiye janevaale vyakti pehle hi bhavakrant hote the, jabaki prekshagrih main janevaale vyakti karunaa yaa bhay kii maansik sthiti main nahin hote
 Therefore, the effect of the said practice on the concept of the doctrine can be considered indirect; But it is necessary to establish a direct relationship
 jahaan tak nitiparak arth kii baat he, manovigyaan bhi isaki pushti karata he
 Aristotle's means of expulsion not only expel expressions, but also their balance
 isi prakaar pro bujar kaa arth bhi vichaarneey he
 According to him, arbitration has two sides - one is emotional and the other is emotional
 abhavatmak paksh yah he ki vah pehle manovegon ko uttejit karen, taduparant unka shamankar manakshanti pradaan kare
 After this, artistic fulfillment is his emotional side
 virechan ko bhavatmak rup dena uchit nahin he
 Aristotle's intention is only up to the harmony of mind and taciturnism, on the basis of which the current critic Richards has given the theory of 'a set of inertia'
 dow nagendra kaa mat he ki ‘‘virechan kala-swaad kaa sadhak to avashya he- samanjit man kala ke anand ko adhik tatparta se grahan karata he, parantu virechan main kala-swaad kaa sahaj antarbhaav nahin he
 Therefore, it is perhaps not justified to give effect to the theory of purgation
 ’’ According to modern scholars, feelings of tragedy and compassion are manifested in their natural form by becoming more annoying
 traasadee ke prekshna ke falswaroop ve apane anugr evam anaapattijanak rup ko prakashit karti he
 In this form, they emerge as personal and universal
 isse virechan or saadhaaraneekaran kaa ghanishtha sambandh sahaj hi dekha ja saktaa he
 Here the question arises that is the devolution theory the only expedient medium to understand the impact or purpose of the tragedy? Indeed, restricting the act of tragedy to catharsis is like narrowing its purpose
 iske vipareet bhavvaadi samikshakon ne virechan kaa kshetra atyant vistrut banaakar yah siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki virechan se avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon main bhi parivartan hota he or unka atirek mitata he
 Scholars such as Dryden, Edison, etc
 gave this comprehensive view
 kuch vidwaan virechan prakriya ke astitv ke bare main shankaa karte hai
 Their objection is that such arbitration does not happen in real life
 traasadee se karunaadi manoveg udbuddha to ho jate hai, kintu unke virechan se manah shaanti sarvatha nahin hoti
 In fact, the miracle of tragedy is basically emotional
 vah virechan-prakriya dwaara bhaavon ko udbuddha karti he unka samanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 This is an important contribution of the theory of purgation
 doosraa akshep yah he ki traasadee main pradarshit bhaag avastavik hote hai, atah ve hamaare bhaavon ko udbuddha nahin kar pate, virechan kii to baat hi nahin
 Actually, this opinion is also not appropriate
 traasadee dwaara bhavodwek nishchay hi kala-chamatkaar kaa pratifal nahin, ragaatmak prabhaav kii parinti he
 a significant complementary effect is the reason for its success
 atah akshep sarvatha nirmul he
 According to psychoanalytic science, the inattention or suppression of emotions is the leading cause of mental illnesses
 inkaa vichaar bhaavon kii uchit abhivyakti or parithosh dwaara ho saktaa he
 Expressions in the unconscious mind give rise to mental glands due to lack of proper expression
 in grathiyon ko chetan str par laakar man kii ghutan or atrupti ko dur kiya jaataa he
 This relieves the tension of the mind and the mind experiences a kind of vividness and lightness
 manovishleshan shaastra kii unmukt vichaar-pravaah-pranali kaa aadhaar yahi prakriya he
 From this point of view, the psychological basis of purgation is absolutely strong
 frid aadi vidwaanon ne anek sthalon par arestu vaakyon ko apan mat ke samarthan main prastut kiya he
 The impact of the tragedy propounded by Aristotle has a substantial resemblance to Karun Ras in Indian poetry
 traasad prabhaav ke aadharbhoot manoveg he- karunaa or traas
 Both these expressions are basically sad
 udhar karun ras kaa sthaayee bhav ‘shok’ he
 Indian poetics 'mourning' accepts the existence of tragedy with compassion under the permanent sense
 isht naash yaa vipatti shok ke kaaran hai
 They evoke both compassion and tragedy
 vipatti ke saakshaatkaar se karunaa kii, waisi hi vipatti kii punrariti kii ashanka se traas kii anubhuti hoti he
 But the major difference between the views of Indian Acharyas and Aristotle is that the tragic effect of Aristotle is a mixed emotion, while the mourning lasting feeling of Indian poetry is fundamentally immortal, as in the compassion produced by Sita's misfortune, there is no touch of tragedy, whereas Aristotle In the eyes of the tragic Karun incident is not an ideal situation

 The strong signature of the new poetry movement has been among the major poets of the third saptak edited by Kunwar Narayan Agnayya
 kunwar narayan ko apni rachanashiltaa main itihaas or myth ke jariye vartmaan ko dekhne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Kunwar Narayan's creation world is so wide and complex that it is not possible to give him a name
 yadhyapi kunwar narayan kii mul vidha kavita rahi he par iske alaava unhone kahani, lekh va samikshaon ke saath-saath cinema, rangamanch evam anya kalaon par bhi bakhubi lekhnee chalaayi he
 Due to this, while there was easy communicability in his writing, he also remained experimental
 unki kavitaaon-kahaniyon kaa kai bhartiya tathaa videshi bhashaaon main anuwaad bhi ho chukaa he
 He has also translated poems of Kawafi and Brokhes for the magazine 'stress'

 Due to his experimentation in a short time, he got established and Nitijan Agnayji included his poems in the 'third Saptak' in 1959 with Kedarnath Singh, Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena and Vijaydev Narayan Sahi
 yahan se unhen kaaphi prasiddhi mili
 With the publication of Manav Kavya like 'atmajayi' in 1965, Kunwar Narayan made a mark as a poet with immense potential
 phir to aakaaron ke aasapaas, parivesh : ham-tum, apane saamne, koi doosraa nahin, in dinon, aaj or aaj se pehle, mere saakshaatkaar or haal hi main prakashit vajashrava ke bahaane sahit unki tamaam kritiyaan ain
 Kunwar Narayan is the best writer of our times
 unki kavyayatra 'chakravyuuh' se shuru hui
 Along with this, he created a new kind of understanding among Hindi poetry readers
 unke sangrah 'parivesh ham tum' ke madhyam se maanviya sambandhon kii ek viral vyakhya ham sabake saamne ai
 He presented the eternal problem of death as a medium of kathopanishad in front of us with wonderful interpretation in his management 'atmajayi'
 isamen nachiketa apane pita kii ajna, 'mrity ve twa dadamiti' arthath main tumhen mrityu ko detaa hoon, ko shirodharya karke yama ke dwaar par chalaa jaataa he, jahaan vah teen din tak bhookha-pyaasa rahakar yamraj ke ghar lautne kii pratiksha karata he
 Pleased with this practice, Yamraj allows him to ask for three boons
 nachiketa inamen se pehla vardaan yah maangata he ki uske pita vajashrava kaa krodh samaapt ho jaae
 Based on this statement of Nachiketa, in the work of Kunwar Narayanji, which came in 2008, 'vajashrava's excuses', he has poeticized the upheaval that was going on in the mind of father Vajashrava
 is kriti kii viral visheshta yah he ki 'amoort'ko ek atyadhik sookshm samvednaatmak shabdaawalee dekar nai utsaah parakh jijeevishaa ko vaani di he
 While on the other hand, Kunvarnarayan ji has interpreted the subject like death in self-respect, on the contrary, in the 'under the pretext of Vajashrava', he has highlighted the light of life with his legislative compassion
 yah kriti aaj ke is barbar samay main bhatakati hui maansikta ko na keval raahat detii he, balki yah prerana bhi detii he ki do pidiyon ke bich samanvay banaae rakhane kaa samajhadaar dhang kya ho saktaa he

 The Babri Masjid was a mosque on the Ramkot hill in the city of Ayodhya in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh

 More than 2,000 people died in riots that resulted in several major Indian cities, including Mumbai and Delhi
 bharat ke pratham mogul samraat babar ke aadesh par 1527 main is masjid kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 After taking away the Hindu structure or construction from the priests, Mir Baqi named it Babri Masjid
 1940 ke dashak se pehle, masjid ko masjid-e-janm asthaan kaha jaataa tha, is tarah is sthaan ko hindu ishwar, ram kii janmabhumi ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 After the Hindu structure was snatched from the priests, Mir Baqi named it Babri Masjid
 babari masjid uttar pradesh, bharat ke is rajya main 3 karod 10 lakh muslim rahaa karte hai, kii sabase badi masjidon main se ek thi
 Although there are many old mosques in the surrounding districts, including the Hazrat Bal Mosque built by the Shariqi kings, the Babri Masjid became the largest due to the importance of the disputed site
 iske aakaar or prasiddhi ke baavjood, zile ke muslim samudaay dwaara masjid kaa upyog kam hi hua karata tha or adaalaton main hinduon dwaara anek yachikaaon ke parinamswaroop is sthal par ram ke hindu bhakton kaa pravesh hone laga
 The political, historical and socio-religious debate on the history of the Babri Masjid and its location and whether it was built by breaking or altering an earlier temple is known as the "ayodhya dispute"
 is masjid kii vaastukala mandiron yaa gharelu sheliyaan se viksit hui, jo ki vahaan kii jalwaayu, bhubhag, samagriyon dwaara anukulit the; isiilie bengal, kashmir or gujarat kii masjidon main baari antar he
 The Babri Masjid followed the architectural pattern of Jaunpur
 ek vishisht style kii ek mahatvapurn masjid babari mukhyatya vaastukala main sangrakshit rahi, jise dilli sultanate kii sthapana ke baad viksit kiya gaya tha
 The large arches, pylons and towers of Charminar Chowk in Hyderabad are very special
 is kala main pathar kaa vyapak upyog kiya gaya he or 17veen sadi main mughal kala ke sthanantarit hone tak jaisaa ki tajmahal jaisi sanrachanaon dwaara dikhaai padataa he; musalamaanon ke shashan main bhartiya anukulan pratibimbit hota he
 The traditional hypostyle scheme with an enclosed courtyard was imported from West Asia, usually associated with the entry of Islam into new territories, but was later abandoned due to local climate and more suitable plans for the need
 
 babari masjid sthaneey prabhaav or pashchim asian style kaa mishran thi or bharat main is prakaar kii masjidon ke udhaaharan aam hai
 The Babri Masjid had a grand structure with three domes, one of the three domes was prominent and two were secondary
 yah do oonchi deevaaron se ghira hua tha, jo ek duusare ke samanaantar thim or ek kuen ke saath ek bada-sa angan sanlagn tha, us kuen ko uske thande va mithe jal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The high entrance of the domed structure has two inscriptions with two inscriptions in the Persian language declaring that a Mir Baqi built this structure on Babur's orders
 babari masjid kii deevaaren bhounde safed retile pathar ke khandon se bane hai, jinke aakaar ytaakar hai, jabaki gumbad patale or chote pake hue eenton ke bane hai
 Both of these structural devices are plastered with a lumpy mixture of coarse chun with granulated sand
 madhya angan badi maatra main vakr stambhon se ghira hua tha, chat kii oonchai badhaane ke liye aisa kiya gaya tha
 Planning and architecture were influenced by the Friday mosque of Jahangapanah in Begumpur, not the Mughal style, where Hindu masons used their own straightforward structural and decorative traditions
 unki dastakaari kii utkrushtataa unke vanaspatik imarti sajaavat or camel akruti main saaf dikhti he
 They are also present in the Feroz Shah Mosque of Belboote Firozabad, now in a dilapidated condition, Qila Kuhna Mosque, Darsbari Mosque in the southern suburb of Wall Gaur city and Jamali Kamili Mosque built by Sher Shah Suri
 yah akbar dwaara apanaai gayi bharat-islamic style kaa agravarti tha
 According to Lord William Bentick's architect Graham Pickford, "A whisper from the arch of the Babri Mosque can also be heard from the other end, 200 feet away and the length and breadth of the middle courtyard
" " unki pustak "historic strecchars of avadh" main unhone masjid kii dhvaniki kaa ullekh kiya he, jahaan ve kehete hai "kisi 16veen sadi kii imaarat main manch se aawaaj kaa failaav or prakshepan atyadhik unnat he, is sanrachana main dhwani kaa adwitiya failaav aagatuk ko chakit kar degaa
" Modern architects have attributed this acoustic feature to the large blank space in the wall of the arch and the numerous spaces in the surrounding walls, which serve as resonant circuits; This design helped everyone to hear the speaker of the arch
 babari masjid ke nirmaan main istemaal kiye gayi retile pathar bhi anunadak kism ke the, jinka adwitiya dhvaniki main mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa
 The Tughlaqi style of the Babri Masjid was integrated with other indigenous design components and techniques, such as the air-conditioned system covered with Islamic architectural elements such as arches, arch ceilings and domes
 babari masjid kii ek shantipurna paryaavaran niyantran pranali main oonchi chhaten, gumbaj or chah badi jalidaar jharokhe shaamil rahe the
 This system naturally kept the inner part cool and also helped in the arrival of sunlight
 1527 main fargana se jab muslim samraat babar aayaa to usne sikari main chittorgarh ke hindu raja rana sangram singh ko topakhane or gola-barood kaa istemaal karke haraaya
 After this victory, Babur captured that area, he made his commander Mir Baqi as the Subedar there
 mir baaki ne ayodhya main babari masjid kaa nirmaan kar iskaa namakaran samraat babar ke naam par kiya
 There is no mention of any new mosque there in Babur's Roznamcha Baburnama, although the pages related to that period are missing in the Rosmanche
 samakaleen taarikh-e-babari kahata he ki babar kii sena ne "chanderi main bahut saare hindu mandiron ko dhwast kar diya tha
 " 1992 main dhwast dhaanche ke malbe se nikle ek mote pathar ke khand ke abhilekh se us sthal par ek puraane hindu mandir ke peliographic pramaan praapt hue
 On the day of the demolition, more than 260 other artifacts and many more facts of being part of the ancient Hindu temple were also extracted

" It further states that this temple was built in the temple town of Ayodhya
 ek anya sandarbh main, ek mahant raghubar das dwaara daayar shikaayat par faijabad ke jila nyaayadhish ne 18 march 1886 ko faisla sunaaya tha
 Although the complaint was dismissed, two relevant facts emerged in the judgment: "maine paaya ki samraat babar dwaara nirmit masjid ayodhya nagar kii seemaa par sthit he
 The most unfortunate thing is that the mosque has been built on such a special ground that is revered by Hindus, but since this incident happened 358 years ago, it is now too late to retaliate this complaint

 In such a case, as is the case now, any kind of innovation will create more harm and disturb peace than profit
 " According to Jain Samata Vahini, the social organization of the Jains, "any structure found here during excavation can only be a sixth-century Jain temple
 " Jain Samata Vahini general secretary Sohan Mehta claims that the excavation done by the ASI on the order of the Allahabad High Court to settle the Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi dispute testifies that the disputed demolished structure is, in fact, an ancient Jain temple

 Nehra is a tribe of Jats in India and Pakistan
 ye rajasthan, dilli, haryana, punjab, uttar pradesh or pakistan main paae jate hai
 The origin of Nehra is believed to be from Narishyant, son of Vaivasvata Manu
 pehle ye pakistan ke sindh praant main nehra parvat par nivas karte the
 From there, he settled in the Jangladesha region of Rajasthan and came to Jhunjhunu to live on the Nehra mountain

 unke dil main yah baat paidaa ho gayi ki bharat main jat samrajya sthapit ho
 Jujhar Singh had heard about the Jat kings of Punjab, Bharatpur, Braj and the sacrifice of Gokula
 unki hardik ichha thi ki navabashahi ke khilaaf jat log mil kar baghawat karen
 At the same time Sardar Jujhar Singh met a Rajput

 His name was Shardul Singh

 The method of coating metals by electric current is called electrolysis
 bahudhaa lohe kii vastuon ko sanksharan se bachaane tathaa chamak ke liye, un par taanbe, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 After the base metal is coated, the outer properties of the metal being coated are visible
 isse vastu kaa bahari rup rang nikhar jaataa he tathaa saath hi vastu sanksharan se bhi bachati he
 The metal to be coated by electrolysis is well attached to the base metal and coating can often be done in a permanent way
 vidyutlepan sajja ke mukhya ansh nimnlikhit hai - 1
 Electrophoresis bath - filled with a metal compound to be coated, which breaks down into metal ions as the current flows and these ions get coated on the base metal surface
 2
 disht dhara kaa strot - yah saamanyat: ek dishtakaari hota he or prayavarti dhara ko disht dhara main badalata he
 3
 The base metal object to be coated - it is associated with the loan terminal of the stream
 dhan terminal anode se sambhddha hota he, jo lepan kii janevaali dhaatu ke yogic main duba rahata he
 When current flows between the two terminals, the metallic silver ions move toward the bottom of the cathode and are converted into metallic form and cling to the bottom
 lepan kii motaai dhara ke ghanatv evam lepan ke kaal par nirbhar karti he
 The direct current can be used for electrification, otherwise there will be no ablative action
 jahaan sambharan prayavarti dhara kaa hota he vahaan ise disht dhara main parivartit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 This can be done by directional or motor-generator sets
 kisi vastu par vidyutlepan karne se pehle, use acchhee prakaar saaf kiya jaataa he
 There should not be any kind of oily substance, grease, or dust particles on it, otherwise the coating will not be strong
 saaf karne ke liye kuch rasinic vilyanon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he or unase dhone ke baad, dhatviya oxidon ko hataane ke liye, lepan kii janevaali vastu ko salphurik amla athwa hydrochloric amla ke tanu vilyan main daal diya jaataa he
 After that, the object is hung in the lapan vath as a cathode to be coated
 lepan bath, saamanyat: achaalak padaarth kii tank ke rup main hota he, jisamen lepan kii janevaali dhaatu kaa rasinic vilyan bharaa hota he
 For copper coating, this solution is of copper sulphate
 nikal lepan ke liye nikal salphet kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some of their other chemical compounds are used for their specific coating
 vaise to koi bhi dhaatu, kisi duusari dhaatu par lepit kii ja sakati he, parantu vyaavhaarik rup main adhikanshat: lohe kii vastuon par tamra, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he or taanbe tathaa pital kii vastuon par chaandi athwa sone kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 Lapan has another practical difficulty
 yadi kisi sakriy dhaatu ko aise dhaatu ke yogic ke vilyan main daal diya jaae jisamen aayan prachur maatra main hon, to pruthakkaran kriya hone lagati he
 Such coatings are not durable
 taanbe yaa pital par chaandi-sone kaa lepan karne main bhi yahi kathinaayee hoti he inamen prayog honevaale rasinic vilyanon kaa sanghatan bahut santulit rakhaa jaataa he
 In lapan vath, in general, another compound, called additive factor, is added
 gond, gelatin, albumin aadi saamaanya prayog main aanevaale yojit kaarak hai
 Copper cyanide is also used in place of copper sulphate in copper coating
 ise bahudhaa ispaat par pehla tamra aavaran dene ke liye prayog karte hai or baad main tamra aavaran par nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 In copper coating also, the first cover is given by copper sulphate after copper cyanide gives the first cover
 chamak paidaa karne ke liye, saadharantaya, kuch sodium thayoslphet bhi lepan bath main mila diya jaataa he
 The stream density is about 100 amperes per square meter for good and durable coating
 is vishay main anubhav hi mukhya kasuti he
 Mati Maange Khoon is a 1984 Hindi language film

 While donkeys have 62 chromosomes, their number in horses is 64
 khachchar ko aamtaur par bojha dhone ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Before industrialization, mules played an important role in transporting goods
 sabhi nar khachchar bandhya hote hai, jabaki maadaa khachchar kuch durlabh maukon par garbhadhaaran kar sakati hai
 The size of the mule depends on the size of the mare that produces it

 He was also fined £ 20,000

 It was also feared by many that he would never be able to make his place in the English football team again, as the taunts and comments of the players of the opposition team and especially his supporters may prove unbearable for him
 apni vaapasi ke khel main, cantona ne khel ke duusare hi minute main niki bat ke liye ek gol banaaya or uske baad rayaan gibs ke palati maar dene ke baad ek penalty bhi praapt kar liya
 It was undoubtedly impacted for eight months without a competitive football match and Cantona struggled to regain their pre-christmas form and the gap between them and leading team Newcastle United rose to 10 points by December 24
