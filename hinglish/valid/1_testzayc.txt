 According to Lantnouma, initially 435 men settled here, most of whom lived in the northern and southwestern regions of the island
 laantanomapuk ko kisne likhaa is baat ko lekar matbhed he
 According to some, it is the work of a writer, while others believe that it was created by combining it with narratives told at meetings held during that period
 iceland main norse log europe ke viking kaal ke dauraan 870 isvi se 930 isvi ke bich aakar based the
 The names of the descendants of Lantnomapuk are recorded after that period, so this story seems to have been completed around the 11th century after that period

 Black Salt ; Nepali: Bire Nun; Hindi Black Salt; Gujarati: સંચળ સંचलાલ) is an edible salt produced in the Indian subcontinent and extensively used in Indian food

 Hydrogen sulfide is the main cause of its odor
 kuch sroton main kaala namak banane kii nimnlikhit vidhi bataayi gayi he- To make black salt, salt seeds are boiled by adding myrobalan seeds, after boiling, the water evaporates and the remaining is crystalline salt, which is black in color, hence its name is black salt

 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki yah pet kii gas or pet kii jalan main raahat pradaan karata he
 It is also sometimes used by people with high blood pressure or a low-salt diet because it is believed to contain less sodium than common salt and does not increase the amount of sodium in the blood
 harad ke bijon ko ayurvedic chikitsa main kamottejak mana jaataa or yah raktchaap ko kam karne or jalan main madad karata he
 The reason for this effect is the sulfurous compounds of myrrh seeds that become part of the black salt during the manufacturing process

 jeevani vigyaan se adhik poochta he ki koun si prajatiyaan hai or kahaan hai? yah bhi kyon poochta he? or, kabhi-kabhi zyada mahatvapurn kyon he, kyon nahin?" Modern biology often uses geographic information systems to understand the factors affecting the distribution of organisms, and predicts future trends in organism distribution
