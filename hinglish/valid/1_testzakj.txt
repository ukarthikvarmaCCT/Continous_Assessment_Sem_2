 unka nidhan 1909 main hua
 Through his deep research and analysis, Dutt showed that the British rule not only failed to improve the physical condition of India, but also during its period India was de-industrialized

 Apart from highlighting the ill effects of British economic policy, Dutt's second major contribution to the development of economic ideas was that he advocated setting limits to government intervention in the economy

 Dutt said that the government should avoid private initiative interventions but should be prepared to intervene under specific circumstances so as to avoid conflict of interest by avoiding temporary types of crises
 yatharth kaa akalan karne kii dutt kii paddati bhi us jamaane ke hisaab se alag tarah kii thi
 Dutt developed the concept of interdependence of economic and political facts, instead of considering one as the major and the other as his influence among the many reasons of reality
 unki manyata thi ki samaaj ke tantra main har chiz ek-duusare par nirbhar he, paraspar judi hui he isliye santulan bigaadane jaisaa koi bhi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, Dutt also understood that balance is not always the same

 Therefore, the government should focus on the underlying dynamics of the immediate situation while intervening, or else its interventionist actions may result in the opposite

 Dutt questioned why the people of India had to face ten horrific famines in the span of forty years since 1858? He asked that during this time the ruler was in the hands of the Empress rather than the East India Company

5 crore people lost their lives due to hunger? Dutt did not agree to believe that the cause of famines is due to the rapid increase in population or that the farmers of India are careless, unconcerned and cynical
 unhone yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ki kisaanon kaa soodakhor mahajanon ke shikanje main fasaa hona akaal kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Dutt showed in his study that the growth rate of population in India was not only always lower than in England, but in the ten years before his study, the population of this country had stopped increasing
 dutt ke anusaar bharat se zyaada parishramee or kam karch main guzar-basar karne vaale kisaan duniya main or kahin nahin hai
 He cited the reports of commissions investigating the causes of famine and said that it is due to the rigorous recovery of government revenue that farmers have to depend on the Mahajans
 angrez sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaate hue dutt ne pradarshit kiya ki akaal ke baavjood aisa koi saal nahin tha jab sari fasalen chaupat ho gayi hon
 Grain was always full in government warehouses
 ek praant main agar fasal karaab ho gayi ho, to duusare praant main fasal acchhee hui
 Farming has expanded, it has become denser, yields have also increased compared to earlier, prices of agricultural produce have also increased, but even after this the condition of farmers has continued to deteriorate
 iske liye dutt ne british nitiyon ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 In 1902, the first volume of Dutt's great treatise 'the Economic History of British India' was published
 ise british hukumat par likhe gayi sabase behtareen granth kii sangya di jaati he
 In this, economic history was introduced from the establishment of British power in 1757 till the emperor's rule was implemented
 isamen east india company ke tahat apanaayi gayi kheti or bhoomi bandobast sambandhi nitiyon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa utpaadan sambandhi nitiyon ke saath-saath vitt or prashasan sambandhi nitiyon kaa vishleshnatmak vivaran tha
 British reviewers of the book also considered its impartiality and depth iron
 1904 main is mahagranth kaa doosraa khand prakashit hua
 He claimed on the basis of authentic facts that selfish policies adopted in the early years of British rule have been responsible for the decline of Indian industries
 dutt ne bharat main garibi ke kaarnon par prakaash daalate hue sabit kiya ki angrezon kii niti ke kaaran deshi udyog or hastkalaon ko tabah ho janaa padaa
 Millions of people became unemployed, leaving no other option but to live for them
 is tarah kheti ke bharose jivit rahane waalon kii sankhya had se zyaada bad gayi or sabhi ke rahan-sahan kaa str gir gaya
 Along with this, the British continued to spend huge money to rule India, which did not benefit the country
 rajkoshiya niti or bhu-rajasav pranali kuch is tarah kii banaayi gayi ki kisaan ke paas sirf zindaa bache rahane laayak sansaadhan hi rah gayi
 Dutt also had a prescription for curing these problems
 unhone sifaarish kii ki bhartiya mil udyog se utpaadan shulk hataa liya jaae, nichi daron ke naram lagaan ke alaava baaki sabhi taxon se kisaanon ko chhutkaaraa diya jaae, england main hone vaali faujee or shahi karch bharat se nahin vasule jane chahie or bharat main bhi faujee karch ghataaye jane chahie
 As soon as Dutt made these suggestions, the British government and its supporters started criticizing them all-round
 unke tathyon or vishleshan ko kaarij karne kii koshish kii gayi
 It should be noted that Dutt was a senior officer of Indian Civil Services and was bound by the responsibility of serving British rule
 lekin, apni baat par jame rah kar unhone apane virodhiyon ke saath bahes kii or sarkaar se lagaataar anurodh kiya ki vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar ke liye nitiyaan badale
 His unique talent was not limited only to administrative work, but he was also an original writer and historian

 Irrigation is the act of artificially watering the soil to increase the amount of water available in it and is commonly used during crop growing, to meet the water requirement of plants in dry areas or in the event of insufficient rainfall
 
 krishi ke kshetra main iskaa prayog iske atirikt nimna kaarane se bhi kiya jaataa he: - Agriculture which depends entirely on rainfall for its water requirements is called rainfed agriculture
 sinchai kaa adhyayan aksar jal nikasi, jo pani ko prakritik yaa kritrim rup se kisi kshetra kii prishth yaa upprisht se hataane ko kehete hai ke saath kiya jaataa he
 The history of irrigation is very old

 is
 yah vidhi un kheton main prayog kii jaati he jo aakaar main bade hote he or puure khet kaa samatleekaran ek samasya hota he
 In this situation the field is divided into several strips and these strips are divided into small beds by bugs
 The biggest advantage of this method is that water can be poured in a uniform manner in the entire field
 is
 yah paas-paas ugaai jane vaali fasalon ke liye jaise moongfalee, gehun, chote khaddann paara ghaas aadi ke liye upyukt vidhi he
 It has demerits, it takes more labor, is vidhi main yantra jinhen e
meter yaa aplicater kehete hai ke dwaara jal dhire-dhire lagaataar boond-boond karke yaa chote phuhaar ke rup main podho tak plastic kii patali naliyon ke madhyam se pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This method is used in places with extremely shortage of irrigation water
 mukhyatah yah nariyal, angoor, kelaa, ber, nibu prajati, ganna, kapaas, makka, tamaato, bangan or planteshan fasalon main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In this method, the water in the sutra is carried to the field with pressure and is sprayed throughout the field like raindrops by an automatic spraying machine
 ise over head sinchai bhi kehete hai
 Several types of spraying equipment are available
 centre pivot system sabase bada chhidkaav system he jo ek mashin dwaara 100 hectares kshetra kii sinchai kar saktaa he
 This is the surface method of water source
 jiske antargat sichaai kiya jaataa he
 The canal is a man-made structure of water transport and transfer

 On 9 August 2003, Anna Hazare sat on fast unto death at Azad Maidan in Mumbai

 Broadly, it points to a movement that envisages "a world where, to the extent possible, the poor and those on the verge of poverty, not only debt but high savings including savings, insurance and fund transfers The appropriate quality of financial services should be permanently accessible
 " In general, promoters of micro-finance believe that such access helps the poor to come out of poverty

 But the fixed expenses for processing any amount of loans will be quite high: eg, determining potential customers, their repayment prospects and collateral; Administration of outstanding debts, recovery from defaulting customers etc
 While lending or taking a deposit, a profit-free situation has to be established, below which banks have to bear losses on every transaction
 garib log, saamanyat: is rekha se neeche jivan basar karte hai
 Further, most poor people do not have assets that the bank can take on collateral as collateral

 Modern micro-finance emerged in the 1970s, with a greater orientation towards private sector solutions
 This was evidenced by the evidence that state-owned development banks in the developing world, in fact, ignored their development-oriented goals
 While doing that, she failed
 However, the government officials of many countries have different ideologies and do not desist from interfering in micro-finance markets

 While considerable progress has been made in the last few decades to develop a viable, commercial micro-finance sector, there are many problems before the industry is able to meet the plethora of worldwide demand

 sudrudh vanijyik vyashti-vitt udyog kaa nirmaan karne main baadhaaen yaa chunautiyaan is prakaar hai: • Inappropriate funding of donors • viniman or jamaarashi sweekaar karanevaali vyashti-vitt sansthaaon kaa karaab paryvekshan • a number of micro-finance institutions that cater to savings, remittances or insurance needs • vyashti-vitt sansthaaon kii simit prabandh kshamta • Institutional inefficiencies • gramin, krishi unmukh vyashti-vitt paddatiyon kaa adhik prasar or angikaran karne kii zarurat
 Rutherford argues that the basic problem for poor people as wealth managers is to raise 'normally big' money

 In some cases, the development of the overall financial system has stagnated due to poorly designed programs, distorting the market and taking domestic commercial initiatives with little interest or non-interest bearing currency
