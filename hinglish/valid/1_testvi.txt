 During that season, the relationship between De Angeles and Senna soured, as both drivers were in demand for the top driver level in Lotus, and after spending six years on the team, deangelles left for Brabham at the end of the year as he It was firmly believed that Lotus's attention was now focused only on Brazilians

 The foundation of fierce competition between the army and Proust was laid, many dramatic race events reached a climax for the next five years between them
 In 1988, at the start of the Portugal Grand Prix, Proust went a little faster than the army, but the Brazilians quickly overtook the first corner
 prost ne pratikriya dikhaate hue pehle lap ke ant main sena se aage nikal gaye
 Senna bent over to block Prost and forced the Frenchman to walk the pitwall at 180 mph
 prost ne apane pairon ko neeche rakhaa or jald hi pehle kone main sena ko kinare par kar diya or teji se use baahar karne ke liye kheenchna shuru kiya
 Although Prost was angered by the maneuver of the army, the Brazilian ignored the warning from the FIA

 The following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified as a battle on the track and a psychological warfare
 do chaalkon ke bich tanaav or avishvaas badhata gaya jab san marino grand pricks ke punah armbh hone ke baad sena, prost se teji se aage nikal gaye, ek aisa prayaas jise prost ne purv-res samjhaute kaa ulanghan karne kaa daawa kiya
 Senna took an early lead in the competition with victories in three of the first four races, but the title went in favor of Prost due to unreliability in Phoenix, Canada, France, the UK and Italy, with a bump in Brazil and Portugal 
 japan ke suzuka circuit main sena ke saath takaraav ke baad prost ne 1989 kaa vishwa khitaab apane naam kiya, sizan kii aakhri se pehle vaali res jisamen sena ko khitaabi daud main apane ko banaae rakhane ke liye jeetna jaruri tha
 Senna attempted to overtake an inside path that led to Proust moving to the corner and both of mclaren ending with a tire interlock in the Suzuka Shicken Conviction Road

 unhone alesandro nanini ke beneton se lead liya or pratham ho gaye, lekin takkar ke baad dohare mode se aage nikalne or pit len pravesh ke liye unhen FIA dwaara ayogy qaraar diya gaya
 In the winter of 1989, a huge fine and his super license were temporarily suspended and the military negotiated bitterly with the FIA and then-president jean-marie Bellestre
 sena ne doosraa sizan chah jeet or ek dwitiya sthaan ke saath samaapt kiya
 Proust left mclaren to rival Ferrari for the following year
 1990 main, chah jeet, do dwitiya sthaan or teen tisare sthaan ke saath pratiyogita main sena ne ek prabhaavasheel badhat banaai
 His most memorable victories were in the inaugural season in Phoenix, where he competed with then-unseed Jeanne Alessi for several lap leads before coming into the top, and in Germany where he competed with Benetton driver Alessandro Nanini throughout the race

 Suzuka's pole position was on the right side, which comes towards the muddy part of the track
 prost kii pheraari ne ek behatar shuruuaat kii or sena ke mcleren se aage nikal gai
 In the first turn, Senna aggressively maintained their line, while Prost came in and mclaren started driving at around 270 km / h in the rear wheel of Prost's Ferrari, leaving both cars off the track and this time Became world champion of Army Formula 1
 ek saal baad, apane tisare vishwa championships ko lene ke baad, sena ne sujuka main pichley saal kii apni gatividhiyon ko press ke saamne abhivyakt kiya
 Before qualifying the fastest, he said that, he had received assurances from the race officials that the pole position would be placed on the clean side of the track i
e
 the left-hand side, but after obtaining his pole position, he found that This decision was overturned by jean-marie Balestre
 prost ke saath takaraav kii charchaa karte hue sena ne kaha ki ve chaahate the ki yah spasht ho jaae ki ve belestrey ke dwaara liye gaye nirnay ko sweekaar nahin karenge, jise unhone ek anuchit nirnay mana tha, jisamen 1989 main unki ayogyata or 1990 main pole pojishan shaamil he: "I think whatever happened in 1989 was unforgivable and i will never forget it
 i am still struggling to cope with it
 You know what happened here: Prost and me in a double twist
 i bumped into him when he turned towards me
 Later, i rejoined the race and i won, but they decided against me and it was not justice
 baad main jo bhi hua
 

that was the play, but i could not say what i felt
 yadi aap kuch karte hai to, aapako dand miltaa he, aapako jurmaana miltaa he, ho saktaa he aapako apana license hi khona pad jaae
 kya yah kaam karne kaa uchit tarika he? yah sahi nahin he
 

 Last year in Suzuka, i asked the officials to shift the pole position from right to left
 yah anuchit tha, kyonki daayan hissaa hameshaa ganda hota he or vahaan grip bhi kam hoti he - aap pole pojishan paane ke liye kaaphi parishram karte hai or paane ke baad iske liye aapako dand bhugatna padataa he
 And he said, "yes, we will change, there is no problem"
 After that, you know what happened? Belestre ordered that it not be changed
 i know how the system works and i felt it was really unfair
 isliye maine apane aap se kaha, "thik he, chaahe jo bhi ho, main pehle corner kaa pehla pojishan lene ja rahaa hum - main us khilaadi ko us corner main mujhase pehle aane dene ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 If i am close enough to him, he can never turn in front of me, he will have to let me go
 "I didn't care if we collided; i was ready for it
 or use ek mauka mila, vah meri taraf muda or ham durghatnagrast ho gaye
 It was a big and unavoidable accident
 ise to hona hi tha
 "so someone said that it really happened because of you
 "mere kaaran kaise aisa ho gaya?" sena ne pratikriya vyakt kii
 "agar aapako system main rahakar apana kaam behtareen rup se karne ke liye har baar sajaa bhugatni pade to aap kya karoge? peeche khadey rahakar, dhanyavad kahana chahie? aisa nahin ho saktaa
 aap jise sahi maanate hai uske liye ladanaa chahie
 yadi pole bain taraf hota, to main aasaani se badhat ke samay pehle corner main tabadil kar letaa, koi samasya nahin hoti
 pole ko daaen taraf rakhane kaa faisla galat tha or yah nirnay belestrey se prabhavit tha
 And the result of which was the first Corner incident
 maine isamen yogadan diya he, lekin yah meri jimmedaari nahin he
 Proust later called the military activities "disgusting" and said he should seriously consider retiring from the sport after the incident
 sena ne 1991 main apane tisare khitaab par kabja kiya, jisamen saat jeet shaamil hai or bade paimaane par spasht rup se vivaadon se mukt rahe
 Proust did not remain a serious competitor due to a performance decline on Ferrari
 sena ne pratham chaar res main jeet hasil kii
 By the middle of the season, Mansell was able to challenge in the more advanced Williams
 isse sambandhit kai yaadgaar pal rahe hai, jaise spanish grand pricks main jab sena or mancel sidhe trek main 320 km / h kii gati se keval centimetre ke faasale ke saath wheel tu wheel chunauti de rahe the, antat is res ko britone ne jeeta tha
 Mansell's win at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone was followed by a different performance offering
 sena kii car antim lap main tham gai thi lekin unhen circuit par fanse hue nahin choda gaya, kyonki mancel ne apane parade lap ko khinchaa or unhen williams ke said-pod par peeche pit tak jane diya

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: Bilsadi a village in Farrukhabad district

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 vah apne naate-rishtedaaron, wajiron par hameshaa andeh karata tha, apane har shatru ko gambhirtha se letaa tha tathaa kai aise nirnay liye jisase aarthik kshetra main uthal-puthal ho gaya
 For example, he ordered copper coins to be replaced in place of silver coins
 yah nirnay asafal sabit hua kyoki logon ne apane gharon main jaali sikkon ko dhaalnaa shuru kar diya or usase apana jajia kar chukaane lage
 In another decision, he shifted his capital from Delhi to Devgiri in Maharashtra and forced the people of Delhi to move to Daulatabad
 jo sthanantarit hue unki maarg main hi mrityu ho gai
 The decision to shift the capital proved to be wrong as Daulatabad was a dry place due to which there was very little drinking water available according to the population there

 This Sunni Sultan also wrote that he did not tolerate the conversion of the Sunni community, nor did he bear the effort in which Hindus would rebuild their demolished temples
 usne likhaa he ki dand ke taur par bahut se shiya, mahadi or hinduon ko mrityudand sunaaya
 In his memoir, he has written as his achievement that he initiated many Hindus into Sunni Islam and gave them freedom from Jaziya tax and other taxes, which gave a grand welcome to those who accepted Islam
 iske saath hi, usne sabhi teenon staron par karon va jajia ko badhaakar apane purvavartiyon ke us faisle par roak laga diya jinhone hindu brahmanon ko jajia kar se mukti di thi

 bahalul khan lodi ne lodi vansh ko shuru kiya or dilli sultanate par shashan karne vaala pehla pashtun tha
 Bahulal Lodi began his rule to expand the influence of the Delhi Sultanate by invading the Muslim Jaunpur Sultanate, and partly by a treaty
 iske baad, dilli se varanasi kaa kshetra waapas dilli sultanate ke prabhaav main tha
