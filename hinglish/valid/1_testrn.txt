 Naina Devi Temple is at the northern end of the river
 nainital main pichley kuch samay se badhati jansankhya or paryatakon kii baari bheed ne naini jhil ko pradushit kar paristhitik asantulan kii sthiti utapann kar di he
 There are many reasons for this, such as dumping of sewage and sewer by the locals in the drains called Nainital Nagar and the arteries of the lake, throwing garbage and plastic in the lake, putting food in the lake and others in place of environmentally useful fish in the lake Increase in the number of species of fish
 nainital kii yah vishwa prasiddh jhil aaj pradooshan or paristhitik asantulan ke kaaran apana saundarya khoti ja rahi he
 Eutrophication is one of the main reasons why this lake is polluted
 parisancharan tantra yaa vahikaatantr angon kaa vah samucchy he jo sharir kii koshikaon ke bich poshak tatwon kaa yatayaat karata he
 This protects the body from diseases and keeps the body temperature and ph constant
 amino amla, vidyut apghaty, gaisen, hormone, rakt koshikaaye tathaa nitrogen ke apshisht utpaada aadi parisancharan tantra dwaara yatayaat kiye jate hai
 Some people consider the blood-delivery network to be the vasculature only, while others include the lymphatic system as well
 maanav evam anya kasheruk praaniyon ke parisancharan tantra, 'band parisancharan tantra' hai 
 The circulatory system of invertebrates is the 'open circulatory system'
 bahut se tuchh main parisancharan tantra hota hi nahin
 But the lymphatic system of all beings is an open system
 vahikaatantr hriday, dhamniyon tathaa shiraaon ke samooh kaa naam he
 a wide group of capillaries between the arteries and veins is also part of this system
 is tantra kaa kaam sharir ke prayek bhaag main rudhir ko pahunchaana he, jisase use poshan or oxigen praapt ho saken
 The center of this system is the heart, which keeps the blood pumping continuously, and the arteries are the vessels through which the blood reaches the organs and is distributed by capillaries
 keshikaon ke rudhir se poshan or oxigen utakon main chale jate hai or is poshan or oxigen se viheen rudhir ko ve shira main lautaakar hriday main laati hai jo usko phupfus main oxigen lene ke liye bhej detaa he
 Nutrients are also absorbed into the blood after being absorbed from the bowel, and again this blood is sent by the arteries to carry oxygen and nutrition to the organs
 yah peshi-utak se nirmit chaar koshthonvaala khokhla ang, vaksh ke bheetar, upar, duusari parshuka or neeche kii ore chhathi parshuka ke bich main bai ore sthit he
 On both sides of it there are left pleura
 iskaa aakaar kuch trikon ke samaan he, jiskaa chaudaa aadhaar upar or vistrut nimna dhara neeche kii ore sthit he
 It has a double built-in cover, which is called cardiac
 isaki donon paraton ke bich main thodaa snigdh drav bharaa rahata he
 The heart is divided into four cells from within
 do koshth dahini ore or do bai ore hai
 There is a dividing board between the right and left side cells, which does not allow the blood on both sides to meet
 prayek ore ek koshth upar he, jo alind kehalaata he or neeche kaa koshth nilay kaha jaataa he
 In the right ventricle, there are two holes in the upper half of the apex, through which blood returns to the heart
 ek bada chhidr alind or nilay ke bich main hai, jisapar kapatika lagi hui he
 At the time of contraction of the heart, the atrophy of the atrium opens towards the ventricle, causing the blood to enter the ventricle
 daahine nilay main phupfusi dhamni kaa bhi chhidr he
 On narrowing of the ventricle, the blood passes into the pleura, which occurs in the pulmonary artery
 isi prakaar bai ore bhi upar alind he or neeche nilay
 In the left ventricle there are four pus venous holes, by which the purified blood in the pleura comes back and when the atrium is secreted, it goes into the ventricle by the hole between the ventricle and the atrium
 bai ore ke is chhidr par bhi kapatika lagi hui he
 There is a perforation of the aorta in the left ventricle, from which the blood flows out into the aorta and by its multiple branches communicates throughout the body, returning by the veins and then back to the right atrium of the heart
 ye bade mahatv kii sanrachanaayen hai, jo rudhir ko keval ek maarg se agrasar hone detii hai, lautne nahin deteen
 The right side capillary is made up of three caudal parts and is called the trivalon capillary
 bai ore dwivalan kapatika he
 On the side of the ventricle, there are fine fibers similar to those of the rope, the other end of which are on the shoots coming out of the ventricular wall
 ye condaryrajju kehalaate hai or ankuron ko peplia peshi kaha jaataa he
 When the atrium is filled with blood in the ventricle due to the atrial fibrillation, when it narrows, the blood reaches behind the cords and raises them towards the holes, so that their ends meet together to stop the passage of the hole and the blood does not return to the atrium
 Finds
 peplia peshi bhi sankuchit ho jaati hai, jisase condaryrajju tan jaati he or kapaticaon ke kapard alind main ulatney nahin pate
 With this type of management, the blood can move in only one direction, from the atrium to the ventricle
 phupfusi or mahadhamani ke chhidron par bhi ardhachandrakaar kapatikaay lagi hui hai
 It is clear from the above description that the hemisphere comes in the right atrium
 vahaan se hritsankunchan ke samay nilay main jaataa he
 After narrowing of the ventricle, the pleura passes into the pleural artery
 vahaan oxigen lekar, rudhir chaar phupfusi shiraaon dwaara baayein alind main jaataa he or uske sankuchan karne par rudhir baayein nilay main chalaa jaataa he
 When narrowing in the left ventricle, the blood advances into the aorta
 is dhamni kii shakhaayen, jinka neeche ullekh kiya gaya he, sharir main faili hui hai
 Blood circulates through them in the capillaries and through the capillaries, veins then return to the right part of the heart and then the same cycle begins
 yahi rudhir parisancharan kehalaata he
 The heart itself has the power to contract
 vah prati minute 72 baar sankuchan karata he, arthath ek baar sankuchan main 0
8 second lagata he
 During this period, the atrial contraction takes place for 0
1 second, the remaining 0
7 seconds remains in a relaxed state
 nilay main 0
3 second tak sankuchan hota he, shesh kaal main vah shithil rahata he
 In this way, the whole heart remains in relaxation for 0
4 seconds
 hriday kaa sankoch prakunchan or shithilavastha anushithilan kehalaata he
 There are flexible tubes or vessels carrying pure blood from the heart through which the blood reaches the organs
 hriday se nikalanevaali mukhya mahadhamani he, jo vaksh main se hoti hui udar ke ant par pahunchakar, do antim shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati hai
 Branches protrude from the aorta and go into the organs
 jyon jyon shakhaayen, nikalati jaati hai, unka aakaar chota hota jaataa he
 These are called small size arteries
 dhaminyon kaa nikatavarti shakhaayen ek duusare se mil jaati hai, jisase yadi ek kaa maarg cat jaataa he yaa rog ke kaaran ruk jaataa he, to duusari dhamni se use vistaar kshetra main rudhir pahunchataa rahata he
 This is called branching
 hriday se nikalanevaali do mukhya dhamni hai, phuffusi or mahadhamani
 After the pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle, it divides into two branches and one branch goes into each pleural
 is dhamni kaa prayojan oxigen lene ke liye rudhir ko phuffus main pahunchaana he
 After going out of the left ventricle of the heart, go first to the right, then backwards, then to the left, where the fourth thorax reaches the left side of the vertebra and goes straight down to the end of the thoracic descending
 is prakaar prarambh main iskaa jo mode banataa he, vah mahadhamani chaap kehalaata he
 At the end of the thorax, by passing through the ventral muscle, reaching the fourth lumbar vertebrae, crossing the entire abdomen, the two common series pane terminates by dividing the arteries

 Their branches go straight down and provide nutrition to the heart muscle
 mahadhamani chaap ke anuprastha bhaag main, dahini ore se kramash: anami, baani mulgriva dhamni or bai adhojatruk shakhaayen nikalati hai
 Anami is the largest branch and reaches right into the cervical mucus, transmits blood in the right root cervix and head and heals the subcutaneous vertical branch
 mulgriva sidhi greeva main upar jaakar avatu upasthi kii urdhv dhara par bahya or ant:greeva shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati hai
 After giving a branch to the cervical eyeball, it penetrates the cranium through the cranium, dividing into the forebrain and middle cerebral branches, which give blood to the front and middle parts of the brain
 donon ore kii ant: greevaayen pramastishk ke tal par pahunchakar aage kii ore swayan ek sanyojani shakha dwaara aapas main or peeche kii ore bhi duusari shakha dwaara aadhaar dhamni se sammelan karti hai
 Thus a circle is formed there, which is called the ring of the villum

 Its other branches are: yah kaksh main pahunchakar kakshiya or bahu main bahuk dhamni ban jaati he
 Upon reaching in front of the elbow, it has two branches, hence and extracellular
 isse nimna shakhaayen nikalati hai : From the subclavian - vertebral, subacute artery, endometrium, and subacute
 kakshiya bhaag se - vankhiya shakhaayen - vahu kii peshiyon ko; ansatund vakshiya ; agrapariveshthani; pashchapariveshthani tathaa adhcensafalki; bahya bhaag se, urdhv or adhonital or peshiyon ko tathaa asthiposhak shakhaon ko
 This ulna starts from the front of the cusp and runs straight down to the palm on the inner edge of the forearm and there, turning the thumb, together with the branch of the exudate, forms a convex arc, in which the inferior, middle and ring fingers are present
 On either side of the index finger, only the inner edge of the index finger leaves
 agrabahu main vah sab peshiyon ko tathaa asthiyon ko poshak shakhaayen detii hai
 Two recurrent branches originate from Kuhni
 agrabahu ke bahari kinare par sidhi neeche manibandh par pahunchakar, peeche kii ore ko ghumkar, pehali or duusari kartal shakhaon ke bich se peeche kii ore se kartal main aakar, ant:prakaashthika kii ek shakha se milakar, nital kartal chaap bana detii hai, jisase anguthe ke donon ore or tarjani ke bahi:prishth ko shakhaayen jaati hai
 Two recurrent branches arise from the brain and branches of muscles and bones
 vaksh main mahadhamani se nimnlikhit shakhaayen nikalati hai : grasika, shwasanalika tathaa hridayavarni shakhaayen, jo in angon main chali jaati hai
 There are pairs of some of the branches arising from the aorta in the abdomen
 stavak, vrikk tathaa shukravha shakhaon ke jode hai, jo mahadhamani ke parshvon se nikalate hai
 From its front are the abdominal cavity and the upper and lower intestinal branches

 After descending some, it divides into two branches called the forebrain and the posterior arterioles
 uru main utarane ke pashchaat hi usase nitlu dhamneen naam kii do shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 It is only after landing in the femur that the Nitlu branch comes out of it, which has its precursors and multiple branches in the muscles of the femur and the blood of the bone

 dhamniyaan shuddh rakt ko hriday se le jaati hai or angon main sookshm koshikaon main ant ho jaati hai, jinke dwaara ang poshan or ksigen rudhir se grahan kar lete hai
 Veins start from these capillaries, by which they are absorbed by blood without nutrition and oxygen
 in keshikaon se shirayen prarambh hoti hai, jinke dwaara poshan or oxigen se rahit rudhir hriday ko lautakar aata he
 This is called impure blood, although there is no impurity in it
 atev shirayen ve vahikaaye hai jo ashuddh rudhir ko hriday main lautaakar laati hai
 An exception to this has been mentioned earlier
 phupfusi dhamni ashuddh rudhir ko hriday main le jaakar phupfus se hriday main le jaati hai
 The veins start from the capillaries itself
 dhamni kii keshikaon main rudhir sancharit hokar, poshan or oxigen ko de chukne ke pashchaat, keshikaon ke us bhaag main aa jaataa he jinase shirayen banati hai
 The formation of these capillaries forms the first microscopic veins
 ye sookshm shirayen milakar bade prakaar kii shira banaati hai
 Larger veins are made from them
 isi prakaar mukhya shirayen ban jaati he, jo ant main mahashiraayen bana detii hai
 There are three main shiratantras in the body: the normal shiratantra, the pulmonary shiratantra and the yakriti or yakritriya navarati shratantra
 sharir main uttal or gambhir shirayen hoti hai
 The convex veins are usually located in the severe fascia below the skin and also accompany the lymphatic vessels and most of the arteries
 avatal shirayen sadaa dhamniyon ke saath rahati hai or is kaaran ve gahari sthit hoti he, chote yaa madhyam aakaar ke saath praaia: unke donon ore ek ek shira hoti he, kintu badi dhamniyon ke saath keval ek shira hoti he
 Both veins are joined by small branches
 saare sharir main shiraaon ke vahi naam hai jo dhamniyon ke, jinke saath ve rahati hai
 Somewhere the names are different, such as ganglion and cervical artery
 kintu praaia: ye samaan hi hai or unki shakhaayen tathaa vitaran bhi dhamniyon hi ke samaan he
 For this reason, it is not necessary to describe their snakes and routes and branches separately
 keval mukhya-mukhya shiraaon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Its convex veins are located along the arteries below the vein, and collect blood from that area and return it through the extraocular and normal facial veins
 vahi: galshira gale ke parshv par twachaa ke neeche dikhaai detii he or neech jatruk ke neeche pahunchakar adhojatruk shira main mil jaati hai
 Within the cranium, the cotrans are formed between two layers of hard meninges

 The normal facial vein is found in this
 mukh, jihva, tonsil, grasani aadi se aane vaali shirayen bhi isi main khulti hai
 The vein nerves on the surface of the hand are visible by the skin
 inase tathaa gahari shiraaon kaa rudhir kartal chaapon main hota hua, bahi:prakoshthika, madhyam or poor: or pasch ant:prakoshthik shiraaon dwaara kuhani ke saamne pahunchakar, madhyam shira main pahunchataa he
 The deep vein from the deep parts also merge into it and then it divides into middle base vein and middle head vein
 ek yaa do inch aage chalakar ant:prakoshthik shirayen aadhaar shira main or bahi:prakoshthik sheersh shiraaon main jute jaati hai
 The base and apex veins move upward on the inner and outer sides of the arm, and after joining the veins of the external artery, the veins open into the orbital vein which itself becomes the posterior end and the subclavian to join the intercostal
 Anami then makes vein
 paanv ke prishth par kii shira jalikaon main bheetar kii ore ant:sakthi or baahar kii ore bahi:sakthi shirayen aarambh hoti hai, jo ant: or bahi: gulf ke neeche se nikalakar jangha ke bheetar kii ore tathaa bich main hoti hui upar ko chali jaati hai
 The inner vein joins the normal O-degree vein by reaching directly into the femoral cortex, originating from the genus, and entering the inner thoracic suture below the inguinal nerve
 bahi:sakthi shira paanv se jangha ke peeche lagbhag madhya main hoti hui upar janupasch khaat main pahunchakar, janupasch shira main mil jaati he
 The joining of the arterial venous veins and the convex and severe femoral veins forms the normal femoral vein, which originates from the bottom of the inguinal nerve and becomes the external pelvic vein
 bahi:shroni falak shira shroni main upar jaakar ant: shronifalak shira se milakar, saamaanya shronifalak shira ban jaati he
 These two veins join at the fifth cutaneous vertebrae and form the lower superstructure, which goes straight upwards and enters the thorax through the ventral muscle
 yakrut ke pashchprishth par yah ek parikha main sthit hoti he
 It comes from Venus or ovum and renal and cutaneous veins
 amashay, samasat antra, pleeha or agnyashay se rudhir ko laanevaali shirayen milakar pratihaarani shira banaati hai
 This large size vein is located about three inches long in front of the inferior venus
 isaki donon shakhaon kii, yakrut main pahunchakar, anek shakhaayen ho jaati he, jo ant main keshikaon main vibhakt ho jaati he
 This is the specialty of the vein
 duusari visheshta unamem kapaticaon kaa na hona he
 The subclavian comes into the thoracic cavity through the hole, going straight upwards, and opens backwards to the underside of the right atrium
 donon ore kii adhojatruk or ant:gat shiraaon ke milane se anami shirayen banati hai
 The left side is longer than the right and protrudes from the back of the aurohastak, joining the right anonymity just below the first appendage, forming a vertical mahsera, which enters the jar at the right atrium below
 isamen adhivatu ant:stanika or kasheruki shakhaayen khulti hai
 The conjunctival vein starts from the abdomen and comes to the chest, opening in the vertebral column at the fourth vertebrae
 do urdhv or adho arkheyugma shirayen bhi hoti hai, jinamein upar or neeche kii antarpashuka shirayen khulti hai
 Three from the right pleura and two veins from the left pleura bring pure blood into the left atrium
 daahine phuffus se aanevaali shirayen praaia: aapas main judakar do rah jaati hai
 Even then sometimes three meet, leading to the entry of three veins on one side and two veins on the other side
 dhamni kii chaudaai kii ore se ek sookshm kaat banaakar or usko rangkar sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se, usamen kai str dikhaai dete hai
 Out of everything is the element level
 uske bheetar pit sthitisthaapak tantu kaa str he
 The third is the level of involuntary muscles within it
 badi dhamniyon main pit sthitisthaapak tantu kaa str kam ho jaataa he or peshistar bad jaataa he
 The nerves end up in the muscle
 is str ke bheetar ek sthitisthaapak kala nirmit str hota he or sabake bheetar antarkala koshikaon kaa ek chikna str rahata he, jisapar rudhir pravaah kiya karata he
 Veins have a similar structure to the wall, but their thickness is much less than that of the arteries
 mansapeshi utak visheshtya kam hota he or jahaan tahaan antarkala str kii vruddhi se kapatikaay ban jaati hai
 There are usually two cupards in the capillaries, although somewhere three and one are also found, the cupards are similar to the sac, which is located in the path of the vein in such a way that if the blood starts returning, these bags are filled
 That is, they swell and close the path
 vahikaatantr kaa ek mahatvapurn avyav keshikas kehalaata he
 a group of capillaries is located between the arteries and veins
 hriday se dhamniyon main rudhir aata he
 These arteries divide into capillaries
 keshikaon ke duusari ore se shirayen prarambh hoti hai
 In this way, the capillary group is similar to a lake, in which a river enters from one side and another river from the other side
 keshikas atyant sookshm vahikaaye hoti hai, jinaki bhitiyaan ant main keval ek koshika moti rah jaati hai
 When the blood flows through the arteries into these capillaries, the nutrients and oxygen present in the blood diffuse from it into the tissues of the organ, and the resultant chemical or chemical reactions in the organ, which form inferior or final substances, are blood
 i come yaheen se shira kaa prarambh ho jaataa he
 First it flows into the blood capillaries
 keshikas aapas main judakar sookshm shira bana detii hai
 Some large veins are formed by mixing them
 ye judakar phir or badi shirayen banati hai
 In this way the size of the veins increases
 yahan tak ki mahashira ban jaati hai
 When the blood enters the aorta from the left ventricle from the systole of the heart, it puts pressure on the reef walls
 ve dabati hai or thodi baahar ko fail jaati hai
 When the blood escapes, the reefs revert
 yah dabaav hi raktchaap kehalaata he
 It is highest in the aorta
 jyon jyon usase shakhaayen nikalati jaati hai, unamem dab kam hoti jaati he
 It is very less in capillaries
 shiraaon main usase bhi kam hoti he
 The larger the vein, the lower the pressure, because their size is larger and they have less blood

 Janakiharan is a high-quality epic composed by Mahakavi Kumaradas of Sri Lanka
 sarvapratham sinhalai bhashaa main praapt 'sannai' ke aadhaar par iske pratham 14 sargo tathaa 15wein ke kuch ansh kaa mul sanskrit rup banaakar prakashit kiya gaya he, jisamen angad dwaara ravan kii sabha main daitya tak kii katha aa jaati he
 The 10 Sargo manuscript of this epic is in Sanskrit at the Government Oriental Manuscript Library, Madras
 kintu yah lipi atyaadhik sadosh he
 There is also doubt about its authenticity and it is not known to what extent it has taken its form from Sinhalese 'sonna'
 sambhavat: is mahakavy kii rachana 25 sargo main hui thi or ram ke rajbhishek se katha kii samaapti hui thi - yah anumaan 'sanne' main udhrut sarvatya shlokon se lagaaya jaataa he
 Hence, its plot can be said to be very similar to 'bhattikavya'
 sargkram se isaki katha is prakaar he : The arrival of Ayodhya and coronation in the remaining Sergo must have been described
 antim padyon ke vivechan se gyaat hota he ki is mahakavy ke rachayita kaa naam 'kumaardaas' tha, jinhen kumarbhatt yaa kumaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 He was the king of Sinhaldwip
 inke pita kaa naam kumaarmani tha
 Kumaradas's fame was enough in India
 jalhan ne apni sookhtimuktawali main 'janakiharan' ke anek shloke uddhrut kiye hai
 Rajeshwar has praised Kumaradas's 'janakiharan' with a strong statement: kehete hai jis din pita kumaarmani yuddh main maare gaye usee din balak kumaardaas kaa janm hua tha
 Two of his matulas - Shri Megh and Agrabodhi - nurtured him
 kavi ne badi kritagyata ke saath apane un maatulon kaa samaran is kavy ke ant main kiya he
 These Kumaradas were different from Kumar Muttalsen, the son of Maudgalyayan, mentioned in the Mahantavantha Mahavansha of Sinhaldwip
 kinvadanti he ki apane kavy 'janakiharan' ke prashansak mahakavi kalidas ko kumaardaas ne saprem sinhaladweep bulaayaa
 Kalidas was tragically killed by being trapped there in the courtship of a beauty queen
 apane atithi evam mitra kii is jaghanya hatya se khinn raja kumaardaas ne bhi apane ko usee chita par jala daal
 Even today, the tomb of Kalidas exists in the south province of Lanka
 rajasekhar kii purvollikhit ukti se yahi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kumaardaas kalidas ke pashchaat hi hue honge
 Raghuvansh and Kumarasambhava also have a great influence on their composition
 yamak ke prati atishay aagrah hote hue bhi vaidarbhi reeti evam prasad gun is kavy kii apni vishistataaen hai
 Seeing the use of some specific words mentioned in Vamana Jayaditya's grammar treatise 'kashika' in the same sense, 'janakiharan', the time of Kumaradas can be placed between Vaman and Rajashekhar in the late eighth century and early ninth

 mahaar regiment bhartiya sena kaa ek infantry regiment he
 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company

 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Rebellion of 1857], and joined the two regiments The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"

 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 Under Jahangir the Hindu features vanished from the style; his great mosque at Lahore is in the Persian style, covered with enamelled tiles
 At Agra, the tomb of itmad-ud-daula completed in 1628, built entirely of white marble and covered wholly by pietra dura mosaic, is one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation anywhere to be found
 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for the agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India

 He also built a mosque after himself in Thatta called Shahjahan Mosque
 Another mosque was built during his tenture in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor
 The Taj Mahal, the "teardrop on eternity", was completed in 1648 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to his 14th child
 The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire
 The Taj Mahal is completely symmetric other than the sarcophagus of Shah Jahan, which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor
 This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red sandstone, to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure
 The Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Shalimar Garden in Lahore, Pakistan, are two sites which are on the world heritage list of UNESCO
 One can see the architectural similarities and the love for water that the Mughals expressed in many of their buildings
