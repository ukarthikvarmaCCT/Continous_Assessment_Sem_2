 yah lekh sangeet se sambandhit 'swar' ke bare main he
 For information about the voice of humans and other mammals, see - Voice sangeet main vah shabd jiskaa koi nishchit rup ho or jisaki komalta yaa tivrata athwa utaar-chadhaav aadi kaa, sunate hi, sahaj main anumaan ho sake, swar kehalaata he
 There are seven vowels in Indian music, namely, Satchj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad
 yon to swaron kii koi sankhya batalaai hi nahin ja sakati, parantu phir bhi suvidha ke liye sabhi deshon or sabhi kaalon main saat swar niyat kiye gaye hai
 In India, the names of these seven vowels are sequentially named Shatj, Rishabh, Gandhara, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, whose short forms are Sa, Re Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni
 vaigyanikon ne pariksha karke siddh kiya he ki kisi padaarth main 256 baar camp hone par shadj, 298 2 / 3 baar camp hone par rishabh, 320 baar camp hone par gandhar swar utpann hota he; or isi prakaar badhate badhate 480 baar camp hone par nishad swar nikalataa he
 This means that the higher and faster the vibration, the higher the tone goes up
 is kram ke anusaar shadj se nishad tak saaton swaron ke samooh ko saptak kehete hai
 The second octave is followed by an octave, whose number is doubled by this number
 isi prakaar teesraa or chauthaa saptak bhi hota he
 If the number of each vowel is less than the fixed number, then the vowels will be equally low and the group of those vowels will be called the octave below
 bharat main yah bhi mana gaya he ki ye saaton swar kramshah mor, gau, bakrii, kronch, koyal, ghode or hathi ke swar se liye gaye hai, arthath ye sab praani kramshah inhen swaron main bolte hai; or inhen ke anukaran par swaron kii yah sankhya niyat kii gai he
 The pronunciation locations of different vowels have also been called different variants
 jaise,—nasa, kanth, ur, taalu, jeebh or daant in chah sthanon main utpann hone ke kaaran pehla swar shadj kehalaata he
 The tone whose speed reaches from the navel to the head is called Rishabh, etc
 ye sab swar gale se to nikalate hi hai, par baajon se bhi usee prakaar nikalate he
 The sa and p of these seven are called pure vowels, because they have no distinction; But the remaining five vowels are of two types - soft and intense
 prayek swar do do, teen teen bhaagon main banta rahata hai, jinamein se prayek bhaag 'shruti' kehalaata he
 Scholars have assumed that sounds that are in a certain rhythm and rhythm produce music there
 dhvaniyon ke mote taur par do prakaar ‘aahat’ or ‘anahath’ dhvaniyaan sangeet ke liye upyogi nahin hotin, inkaa anubhav dhyaan kii paravastha main hota he atah ‘aahat’ naad se hi sangeet kaa janm hota he
 This sound is produced by rubbing two objects together, friction or striking of one object over another
 ‘aahat’ naad ham tak kampan ke madhyam se pahunchataa he
 The sound creates a stir in the air with its waves
 dhwani tarangon kii chaudaai or lambaai par dhwani kaa unchaa yaa nicha hona tay hota he
 The sound of 'ray' is higher than the sound of 'sa' in seven tones of music
 isi tarah ‘ga’ kaa naad ‘re’ se unchaa he
 It can also be said that the length of waves in the sound of 'c' is less than the sound waves of 'ray' and the number of vibrations is more than that of 'ray'
 iske alaava dhwani se sambandhit or bhi kai siddhanth hai jo dhwani kaa baari yaa patala hona, der yaa kam der tak sunai dena nishchit karte hai
 Keeping these qualities in mind, seven vocals were fixed mainly for music
 shadj, gandhar, madhyam, pancham, dhaivat va nishad swar-naamon ke pehle akshar lekar inhen sa, re ga, m, pa, dha or ni kaha gaya
 This is all pure tone
 inamen ‘sa’ or ‘pa’ achal maane gayi hai kyonki ye apni jagah se jaraa bhi nahin hatate
 The remaining five vowels are also called distorted or distorted vowels, as there is scope to move away from their place
 koi swar apane niyat sthaan se thodaa neeche khisakta he to vah komal swar kehalaata he
 And when it moves up, it becomes a loud tone
 phir apane sthaan par laut aane par ye swar shuddh kahe jate hai
 When ray, c, d, n move down, then they become soft and 'm' reaches up and becomes intense
 is tarah saat shuddh swar, chaar komal or ek teevr milakar baarah swar taiyaar hote hai
 Seven vowels have been called 'saptak', but depending on the height and lowness of the sound, there are three types of octaves in music
 saadhaaran dhwani ko ‘madhya’, madhya se upar kii dhwani ko ‘taar’ or madhya se neeche kii dhwani ko ‘mandra’ saptak kaha jaataa he
 The palate is stressed in the ‘tar Saptak’, the throat in the ‘middle Saptak’ and the heart in the ‘mandra Saptak’
 sangeet ke aadhunik-kaal ke mahaan sangitagnon pandit vishnu digambar paluskar or pandit vishnunarayan bhatkhande ne bhartiya sangeet parampara ko likhane kii paddhit viksit kii
 Bhatkhandeji used dots to write the voices of the octaves
 swar ke upar bindu taar saptak, swar ke neeche bindu mandra saptak or bindu rahit swar madhya saptak darshaate hai
 Soft and intense vowels are also sung in these octaves, which are shown in the bhatkhande script by placing the pie vertically above the vowels and soft by putting the pie under the vowels
 in swaron kii dhwani kaa keval str badalata he
 Their softness and intensity remain
 sangeet main swar ko lay main nibaddh hona padataa he
 The rhythm also passes through three levels like the octaves such that the normal rhythm is called the 'middle rhythm', the faster than normal 'fast rhythm' and less than the normal is called 'delayed rhythm'
 sangeet main samay ko baraabar matraaon main baantne par ‘taal’ banataa he
 The 'tal' is repeated again and again and every time it completes its last piece and gets on the piece of time it started with
 har tukade ko ‘maatra’ kaha jaataa he
 Time in music is measured by volume
 teen taal main samay yaa lay ke 16 tukaden yaa matraayen hoti hai
 Each piece is given a name, which is called 'bol'
 inhen bolon ko jab vaadya par bajaayaa jaataa he to unhen ‘theka’ kehete hai
 The quantities of the 'tal' are divided into different parts, so that the song or the player knows which volume he is on and after how many quantities he will reach the 'sum'
 taalon main bolon ke chand ke hisaab se unke vibhaag kiye jate hai
 Where the cycle starts again is called 'sum'
 ‘taal’ main ‘khaali’ 'bhari' do mahatvapurn shabd hai
 That part of the 'tal' is called bharhi, on which more emphasis is to be given according to the lyrics
 ‘bhari par tali di jaati hai
 In 'taal' it is called the empty um part which is not clapped and which gives the singer an idea of the arrival of Sama
 taal lay ko gaanthta he or use apane niyantran main rakhata he
 When 12 vowels were discovered, then ways of using them were found
 12 swaron ke mail se hi kai raag banaae gayi
 Many of them had similarities in the ragas
 kavi lochan ne ‘raag-tarangini’ granth main 16 hajaar raagon kaa ullekh kiya he, lekin itane saare raagon main se chalan main keval 16 raag hi the
 The raga was said to be the vocal group in which the movement of the vowels and the composition formed in their combination could enchant the listener
 yah jaruri nahin ki kisi bhi raag main saaton swar lagen
 It was decided long ago that it is necessary to have at least five vowels in any raga
 aise or bhi niyam banaaye gayi the jaise shadj yani ‘sa’ kaa har raag main hona bahut hi jaruri he kyonki vahi to har raag kaa aadhaar he
 Some vowels that are repeated in raga are called 'vadi' and such vowels are less than two 'vadi' vowels but more often than other vowels are called 'conversational'
 lochan kavi ne 16 hajaar raagon main se kai raagon main samanta pai to unhen alag-alag virgon main rakhaa
 He prepared 12 sections, each of which contained some similar voice ragas
 in virgon ko ‘mail’ yaa ‘that’ kaha gaya
 'thaat' must have 7 vowels ie 'sa', 'ray,' 'C', 'M', 'P', 'dh', 'ni'
 yah baat or he ki kisi ‘that’ main komal or kisi main teevr swar honge yaa mili-jule swar honge
 In these 'thaats' the same ragas were kept, whose voices were similar
 iske baad satrahavin shatabdi main dakshin ke vidwaan pandit shrinivas ne sochaa ki raagon ko unke swaron kii sankhya ke sihaab se ‘mail’ main rakhaa jaye yani jin raagon main 5 swar hon ve ek ‘mail’ main, chah swar vaale duusare or 7 swar vaale tisare ‘mail’ main
 Many scholars have been discussing how to classify ragas into 'fairs'
 dakshin ke hi ek anya vidwaan vyankatmakhi ne ganit kaa sahaara lekar kul 72 ‘mail’ bataae
 He chose 19 of these 'melas' for the ragas of the south
 idhar uttar bharat main vidwaanon ne sabhi raagon ke liye 32 ‘mail’ chune
 In the end, Bhatkhandeji decided that all the ragas of North Indian music can be contained in 10 'fairs'
 ye ‘mail’
 'chatur Pandit' composed a poem to remember which ones are there
 chatur pandit koi or nahin swayan pandit bhatkhande hi the
 He has also composed many compositions under the names 'manjarikar' and 'vishnu Sharma'
 uttar bhartiya sangeet main ‘kalyaan that’ yaa ‘yaman that’ se bhoopali, hindol, yaman, hamir, kedaar, chayanat va gaudsarang, ‘bilavat that’ se bihag, dekhkaar, bilaval, pahari, durga va shankara, ‘khamaaj that’ se jhizoti, thilang, khamaaj, rageshwari, sorath, desh, jaijayavanti va tilak kaamod, ‘bhairav that’ se ahir bhairav, gunakali, bhairav, jogiya va meghranjani, ‘purvi that’ se puriyadhnashri, vasant va purvi, ‘kaaphi that’ se bhimpalasi, pilu, kaaphi, bageshwari, bahaar, vrundaavanee saarang, shuddh mallaah, megh va miyaan kii malhaar, ‘asaavari that’ se jonpuri, darbari kanhda, asaavari va adana, ‘bhairavi that’ se malkauns, bilaskhaani todi va bhairavi, ‘todi that’ se 14 prakaar kii todi va multani or ‘marva that’ se bhatiyaar, vibhaas, marva, lalit va sohani aagi raag paidaa hue
 Even today, musicians are making new ragas with the help of these ten "thaats"
 yahan yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki har ‘that’ kaa naam usase paidaa hone vaale kisi vishesh raag ke naam par hi diya jaataa he
 This raga is called 'ashraya Raag', because some part of this raga is visible in other ragas
 ‘raag’ shabd sanskrit kii dhaatu 'ranj' se bana he
 Rang means to paint
 jis tarah ek chitrakaar tasviir main rang bharkar use sundar banaata he, usee tarah sangitajna man or sharir ko sangeet ke suron se rangata hi to hai
 The meaning of the idiom is to forget everything and be merry or absorbed
 sangeet kaa bhi yahi asar hota he
 The composition which gives color to the human mind with the color of pleasure is called kag har raag kaa apana ek rup, ek vyaktitv hota he jo usamen lagane vaale swaron or lay par nirbhar karata he
 The caste of a raga is determined by how many vowels it contains
 aaroh kaa arth he chadhnaa or avaroh kaa utarana
 In music, the order of the vowels is decided on the basis of their height
 ‘sa’ se unchi dhwani ‘re’ kii, ‘re’ se unchi dhwani ‘ga’ kii or ‘ni’ kii dhwani sabase adhik unchi hoti he
 Just as we climb the stairs one by one to reach the upper floor of a house, similarly the singers travel to Sa-re-ga-m-pa-dh-ni-sa
 isi ko 'aaroh' kehete hai
 In contrast, coming down from the top is called 'avaroh'
 tab swaron kaa kram unchi dhwani se nichi dhwani kii ore hota he jaise saan-ni-dha-pa-m-ga-re-sa
 When there are seven voices in the ascension, the raga is called the 'whole caste'
 paanch swar lagane par raag ‘audav’ or chah swar lagane par ‘shadav’ raag kehalaata he
 If there are seven vowels in the ascension and five vowels in the ascension, then the raga will be called 'complete audav'
 is tarah kul 9 jatiyaan taiyaar ho sakati hai jinhen raag kii upjatiyaan bhi kehete hai
 According to simple mathematics, 484 ragas can be prepared in the seven vowels of a 'thaat'
 lekin kul milakar koi dedh sau raag hi prachlit hai
 The case seems very complicated but it is only a matter of simple mathematics
 aaroh main 7 or avaroh main bhi 7 swar hone par ‘sampoorn-sampoorn jati’ banati he jisase keval ek hi raag ban saktaa he
 At the same time, when there are 7 vowels in Aroh and 6 vowels in Avarog, the entire Shadva caste is formed

 iske liye vah takneekee maanakon kaa prayog karte hue vidhiyaan, dizin or vinirdesh pradaan karti he
 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run

 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"
 aitihaasik rup se ejiniyari kaa upyog sabase pehle sena or sainik kaaryon main hua

 Civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering are the traditional branches of engineering

 In order to get a proper knowledge of the vast area covered by the word engineering, it would be enlightening to give the names of the subjects under its various branches as an example
 jaanapad athwa asainik abhiyantriki ke antargat agralikhit vishay he : sadaken, rail, nautaran maarg, saamudr abhiyantriki, band, apaksharannirodh, baadh niyantran, naunivesh, pattan, jalawaahiki, jalavidyutsakti, jalavigyaan, sinchai, bhumisudhar, nadiniyantran, nagarpalika abhiyantriki, sthavar sampada, moolyankan, shilpabhiyantriki, purvanirmit bhawan, dhvanivigyaan, sanvathan, nagar tathaa gram pariyojna, jalsangrahan or vitaran, jalotsaaran, mahapvahan, kooday-kachade kaa apvahan, sanrachnik abhiyantriki, pul, kancreet, jaetvik sanrachanaayen, purvapratibalit kancreet, neenv, sanjan, bhusurvekshan, saamudrapareekshan, photography surveykshan, parivahan, bhuvigyaan, dravayantriki, pratikruti, vishleshan, mrudayantriki, jalsravi staron main chikani mitti pravisht karnaa, shailapoorit band, mrittika band, pooran kii reetiyaan, jalaashyon main jal risaav ke adhyayan ke liye vikiransheel samasthanikon kaa prayog, avsaad ke ghanatv ke liye gamma kirnon kaa prayog

 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning

 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Keeping in mind the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality control to manufacture the required goods or services

 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem
 Do away

 See this article about Jagdish Kashyap separately about the monk Jagdish Kashyap
 agar sabhi kuch thik-thaak rahata


samay par hota to jagadish kashyap dwaara laghukthaon par sampadit pustak beesvin sadi or hindi laghukatha is shatabdi ke pehle hi varsh main pathakon kii najar hoti
 sambhav he tab iskaa swaroop kuch alag or sheershak bhi kuch or hi hota
 Probably the best short stories of the twentieth century, or the hallmark of the best short stories of the century or anything else
 Then it would have been some more sharp, some more sharp, some more chilli, some more adorned, some more artistic, some more lively and some more useful
 We could call it the precious gem of Hindi literature, the unique Nagina of world short story literature, the standard book of Hindi short story, the precious treasure of editorial consciousness
 In the vast forest of possibilities, there is also a sad possibility that the book is like that, it would have remained without being printed in that form
 Kashyapji's other manuscripts, compositions along with his manuscript would have been licking the dust lying in one of his cupboards
 It would not have been sacrificed in the name of termites to hunger, increase their lineage
 However, a devious publisher kept the manuscript of this book in anonymity for five years, while the readiness of another is passing it on to the readers
 achchhai or buraai kaa sambandh sanathan he, iskaa pramaan detii hui
 For those who are familiar with the short story and who have known or heard the name of Kashyap ji, it is not new information that the short story and Jagdish Kashyap are synonymous with each other
 laghukathaayen likhane, uski vidhaagat saaj-sanvaar ke liye unhone apni anginat raaten kaali kii thim
 For this, thousands of times, they have had to bear the complaints of children, rebuke of the wife and the sourness of relatives
 laghukatha ke kaaran hi unhen bharpoor prasiddh, pathakon kaa pyaar-dulaar, sahyogiyon kii maitri praapt hui, to isi ke kaaran unhen dushmano kii adaavat bhi jhelni padi
 or haa, laghukatha ke hi madhyam se unhen khalil jibran kaa aashirwad praapt hua, jisane unako swabhaav se akkhad or fakkad banaaya
 He gave a new attitude to his pen and a way to test the conditions deeply
 It is a different thing that they could never bring philosophies like their guru and good sentiment
 iske kai kaaran ho sakate hai, jinamein saamaajik paristhitiyon ke saath-saath lekhkeey kshamta bhi sammilit he
 Perhaps the struggle of life may not have given him an opportunity to sharpen himself or his initial successes have raised his mind so high, where, instead of giving patient, reasonable answers to criticisms, furiously dismissing all possibilities of dialogue 
 is kamajori kaa shikaar akele jagadish kashyap hi nahin rahe, balki jin logon ke kandhon par savaar hokar laghukatha andolan apane shikhar ko choona chahta tha, un sabhi kii niyati lagbhag aisi hi thi
 All were supposed to be the messiahs of their respective circles, the martands of their class
 jagadish kashyap ke maamle main yah alag kissa ho saktaa he ki unki dhardaar lekhnee kii maar se tilamilaae, kagaji lekhakon ne saahitiyik aalochana ko bhi vyaktigat str par liya, donon ore se hi phijul kii laffaaji, adaalaton ke chakkar, rachanaatmakataa kaa durupyog, samvednaaon kaa makhul, gutbandi or saahitiyikta ke naam par nikhalis raajnneeti barason-baras chalati rahi, jisko saadhaaran pathak kinchit aashcharya or gahare avsaad ke saath dekhtaa rahaa
 The result was that the stubbornness, personal ambitions, frustrations and insults of those who had carried the short story movement on their shoulders left no stone unturned to bring this movement back to the ground
 That too long ago
 Except in sporadic articles, in the field of short story review, there can be no other achievement of the movement
 Most of it is also full of criticism of each other
 hindi sahitya main yah apni kism kaa shaayad akelaa udhaaharan he
 Even then everyone will agree that Jagdish Kashyap dedicated his important years filled with struggle and creativity to the short story
 unhone laghukatha ke rachanaatmak paksh ko sanvaarane ke saath-saath uski avadharana ko spasht karne main bhi apana moulik yogadan diya
 Jagadish Kashyap not only gave Hindi many unique short stories
 saath hi duusari vidhaon main jame-jamaaye lekhakon se bhi unhone laghukathaayen likhwain, unke kaam ko rekhaankit karne kaa kaary kiya, to unke parakram ke aise bhi udhaaharan hai, jab apni aalochana na jhel paane ke kaaran kai sahityakar laghukatha ke kshetra se palaayan karte hue najar aae
 They still used to curse him and even today, the arrows of his displeasure continue to taunt him or start mumbling over his name
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki ve ab is duniya, yahaan ke raag-viraag se bahut dur ja chuke hai
 Even critics of Jagdish Kashyap could hardly deny that the golden era of Hindi short story period was the most energetic period of the short story movement, when Jagdish Kashyap was active in it
 jaise hi ve udasin hue, apni kunthaon ke kaaran athwa kisi or dabaav se unki kalam kii dhar kunthit hui, to laghukatha andolan kii garmaahat bhi jaati rahi
 His sharpness disappeared
 swayan jagadish kashyap ne is traasadee ko dohare str par bhoga
 ek to na likh paane kaa malaal, jisane unhen bheetar hi bheetar todakar rakh diya tha or doosraa laghukatha andolan ke apane lakshya se bhatak jane kii pidaa, jisase laghukatha ke samikshashastra ke vikaas ko lekar jo tatparta un dinon dikh rahi thi, vah alag-alag aalekhon main vyakt chhut-put vichaaron se aage nahin bad saki
 Moreover, by organizing these scattered ideas here and there, the task of reaching a logical conclusion could not be done
 sach yah bhi he ki jagadish kashyap ke rahete laghukatha ke prati jitani gambhirtha ke saath unka naam judaa, utana shaayad hi kisi or laghukthakaar kaa jud sakaa, kam se kam pashchimi uttarapradesh or dilli parimandal main to koi bhi nahin; yadhyapi sankhya kii drushti se unhone zyada laghukathaayen nahin likhin
 naa hi laghukatha ke samikshashastra par unhone bahut ullekhneey kaary kiya he, jo is kshetra main mile kaa pathar sabit ho sake
 However, what he did proves his authorship honesty and originality of expression
 laghukatha ke kshetra main jagadish kashyap kaa yogadan laghukatha kii moulik avadharana ko lekar he
 Before them, the short story had been struggling for its identity
 laghukatha ke aakaar-prakaar ko lekar jab bahut adhik sawaal uthne lage to unhone rachanaatmak lekhan ke saath laghukatha ke samikshashastra par bhi kaam karnaa prarambh kar diya
 In those days most scholars were basing the word number to reflect the short story and the variance of the story
 jagadish kashyap ne laghukatha kii gunatmak visheshtaon par jor diya, jo kahin adhik taarkik tha
 Which was later accepted by all
 Whatever be the Jagdish Kashyap, the criterion developed for the assessment of the short story, first of all tightened his own compositions
 And the creations which he found to be weak on that criterion, ruthlessly evicted him from his creed
 nikaali gai laghukathaayen aaj unke kisi bhi laghukatha sankalan main nahin he
 The person who can be so ruthless towards his creations, why did he spare others
 So he harshly started to tighten the short stories of others on his test
 yah kaam vivaadon ko janm dene vaala tha, isliye un sampadakon ne us samay jagadish kashyap ko khub uksaaya jo apni vivadprayita yaa chaunkaauun patrakarita ke madhyam se swayan ko kisi na kisi bahaane charchaa main banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Such editors handed him the columns of his journals and weeklies
 bas yaheen se unke jivan main vivaadon kaa pravesh hone laga
 ho saktaa us samay unke man main swayan ko maseehaa maanane kaa gumaan bhi panpa ho
 But Jagdish Kashyap, along with those editor-journalists, were guilty of using them cleverly by instigating them
 jagadish kashyap jaise eemaandaar or sapatabayani karne vaale ke liye samiksha kaa kshetra zyada mufeed nahin kaha ja saktaa
 khaskar aise maahaul main jahaan lekhak hi sameekshak or sameekshak rachanaatmak lekhak hone kaa bhram paale hue hon
 jahaan vastunishthata kaa abhaav ho tathaa laghupatrakion se aage samiksha kii sthiti bahut santoshjanak na ho
 Where the intention of reviewing work is limited to scratching each other, where the sensations are weighed on the scales of politics
 Not for a blunt writer like Kashyap ji
 Here the same name can be knotted whose commitment changes color everyday
 jo jis manch par bhi jaae, jiskaa khaae, usee kaa gungan kare, usee kii aarti utaare
 laghukatha ke kshetra main kashyap ji kii khyaati isliye bhi he ki unhone us samay laghukathaayen likhni shuru kin jab use vidha ke rup main manyata nahin thi, unhone puri eemaandaaree ke saath is vidha ko apanaaya
 haalanki is bich bhram ke shikaar ve swayan bhi rahe
 The most skeptical of these was also about the name of this new genre
 laghukatha andolan ke praarambhik charan main is nai, tikhi or tejatarraar vidha ko nae-nae naamon se nawaja ja rahaa tha
 If someone wanted to give it the name Laghukahani, then some were coming up with names like Kathaika, short-story, genre apart from story, minichaat, satire
 swayan kashyap ji is bare utane nishchit nahin the
 He also approved the name 'minikatha' on the lines of the English short story
 apni patrika ko ‘miniyug’ naam bhi unhone isi avadharana ke saath diya tha
 But with the passage of time, the rest of the names were left behind and the name of the short story got recognition
 laghukatha andolan kii safalataa yah rahi ki dhire-dhire laghukatha naam sabaki jubaan par chadhataa gaya or baaki naam kaaphi peeche chhutate chale gaye
 As a result, those who wanted to take credit for renaming this genre, went cold
 iskaa kinchit shrey ham kamaleshwar or ramesh battara ko bhi de sakate hai, sarika kaa laghukatha visheshank nikaalkar unhone anjaane hi naam ko lekar hone vaali raajnneeti tathaa nirarthak bahason kii hawa nikaal di thi
 Jagdish Kashyap's debut in literature, like other writers of the time, was also through poetry
 jin dinon vah sahitya ke kshetra main aae, nishchit rup se vah samay laghukatha kaa nahin tha
 She was not a respectable genre of Hindi at all, but she lacked the authority of those who followed her
 adhikansh to usko vidha maanane se bhi inkaar karte the
 Then what must have been such a thing that brought them into the field of short story
 Because of which he could connect with the short story so seriously
 is bare main unhone swayan to kuch bhi nahin likhaa
 magar apane samarpan or sangharsh se ve laghukatha ko sahitya kaa vaikalpik praveshdwar banane main kaamyaab rahe the
 Many litterateurs gave their first knock in literature through short story
 nishchit rup se us andolan main jagadish kashyap akele nahin the
 No movement can achieve success by walking on the shoulders of someone alone
 The names of many committed miniaturists like Prithviraj Arora, Satishraj Pushkaran, Ramesh Battra, Balaram, Satish Dubey, Sukesh Sahni are coming to my memory, who were playing the role of their allies at some places and at other times their role was the carrier of parallel movement
 
 ye sabhi laghukatha main rachanaatmak lekhan ke saath-saath uske samikshashastra ko viksit karne kaa kaam bhi kar rahe the
 That is, a competition environment was created in those days to decide the concept of short story, and to make new criteria for it, which was natural
 laghukatha ke prati samarpan, eemaandaar tathaa apni bebaak tippaniyon ke kaaran unka is andolan main dabadabaa bhi rahaa
 Reasons for making short story only medium for expression? An attempt can be made to find its sources from their lives
 jagadish kashyap ke jivan ko dekhen to vahaan keval sangharsh or asthirataa kaa vaataavaran dikhaai padataa he
 Keep in mind that instability does not give any person an opportunity to stop and think and then execute it
 Unrest in the family, then struggle for studies 


 Some friends resort to a wordbomb when it is mentioned
 


 sankari gali main ek choti-si kothri
 jisamen bamushkil ek charpai kii jagah he
 To save books and magazines, a stool has been replaced in the same way as a cot
 din main kaam karnaa, likhnaa-padhanaa he, mitron ko baithne ke liye bhi thikaana chahie, isiilie savera hote hi charpai kamare se baahar thel di jaati he or farsh par hi kapadaa bicha diya jaataa
 jisase palathi markar baithne or kaam karne laayak jagah nikal aati
 yadi kisi mitra yaa rishtedaar ko aana he to use farsh par hi baithna hoga

 Except the unemployed, working people
 unke liye vah farsh or farsh par bicha taat kaa vah maamuli tukdaa bhi kisi reshmi kaaleen se kam nahin tha
 a faint, seated on the same, the young man of the Shyamale Varna bowed the neck, marked with pen on the magazines, his cuttings, saving the letters of readers and fans diligently
 usee kamare main vivaad panpate hai to usee ke daayre main unke samaadhaan bhi khoj liye jate hai

 jis jamaane kii yah kahani he usamen kishoravastha bitate hi vivaah ho janaa badi baat nahin
 magar vah is baat par shukr manaata he ki abhi tak is jhanjhat se dur he
 There is no peace in the house, so its night and day are tied with this cell
 jab or kahin kuch karne ko na ho to lekhkeey junun vakt bitaane kaa acha madhyam to ban hi jaataa he, jiske madhyam se apane aakrosh ko dhakne kaa kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 This image of the youth of Jagdish Kashyap has been shown to me many times by people that now it feels like a picture in your own eyes
 jaahir he ki us yuvak ko apane vartmaan main kuch najar nahin aata
 paristhitiyaan uske man main aakrosh ko bhadakaati hai
 In such a situation, Khalil Gibran gives him direction
 

ki uske gusse ko sahalaate


hausale ko badhaate hai
 He draws authentic expressions of situations, pours out his life
 kalam ko hathiyaar banaakar ladanaa usne khalil jibran se hi siikhaa he
 He does not even deny this
 Khalil is Gibran whose inspiration drives him to write short stories like Saraswatiputra, Blackhars, Varshadan, Darpakal, Aakhri Khamba
 lekin jagadish kashyap, sirf jagadish kashyap hai, khalil jibran nahin
 na unki paristhitiyaan or paariwarik jimmedaariyaan unhen iskaa avasar dete hai
 Yes, they tried to live it for a lifetime
 isi koshish main unhone na jane kitnon kii dushmani mol lee
 Differentiation Even litigation was fought
 jivan ke lambey sangharsh, paraajayon, abhaavon tathaa lambii niraashaa ne hi sambhavat: unhen sahitya kii sharan main jane ko majaboor kiya hoga
 At the same time, he must have met Khalil Gibran at some point
 vahi unke jivan kaa parivartankaree daur siddh hua, khalil jibran ek baar jo unke dilo-dimag par savaar hue, phir jindagi-bhar nahin utre
 kintu unke jaisi jivan kii talkhi, bhavapravanta or gahan darshaniktaa ko kisi badi rachana main sambhaal paanaa aasaan nahin tha
 And even if handled, it would have been a problem for the readers
 Perhaps this is why Khalil himself wrote small compositions, which are prose in a way
 yah ek sutara tha jisane jagadish kashyap ke lekhan ko disha di
 And which he later adopted as a movement
 ek baat jo jagadish kashyap ko apane samakaleen laghukthakaron se alag siddh karti he, vah yah he ki unhone jaisaa sochaa use usee eemaandaaree or bebaaki ke saath shabdon main bhi vyakt kiya
 Never cared for the result
 sarkari naukari main rahete hue sarkaar kii nitiyon ke virodh main aag ugali
 chhadam naam se sthaneey akhabaaron main likhaa
 unki tippaniyon se bavela machaa
 The editor of the newspaper, who used to enjoy the politics of making those comments, and pressurizing them, sweat themselves when they came under pressure
 gaaj kashyap ji par giri
 nateeja saspand hue


jis mahakme main naukari main the, vahaan par rahanaa bhaagyashaalee hone kaa pramaan hota
 The newly arrived recruit would also buy his scooter and his house in five-six years
 Kashyap ji kept walking on a broken old cycle for his whole life
 ghar ve saans rahane tak nahin kharid paae
 or jab gaye to sir par karj kii gathree laade hue
 sharaab kaa shauk jarur tha par karj kaa kaaran mitron-sahyogiyon ko diya gaya karj tha
 Helping had become part of his nature
 ek or udhaaharan isi pustak ke sampadan ke saath judaa hua he
 At the time when the work of composing for this book was going on, then a short story came in between a litterateur with whom Kashyap ji was fighting
 donon ke bich lambii mukademebaaji bhi ho chuki thi
 At that time there was Subhash Chander in addition to both of us
 ham sochate the ki kashyapaji us lekhak kii rachana ko to lene vaale haragij nahin hai
 But it was surprising when Kashyapji not only included the short story of the author in his compilation, but also the comment that the man, though a man is dirty, but his work entitles him to be included in this book
 ek or laghukthakaar kii rachana kii bhi unhone mukt kanth se prashansa kii thi, sanyogvash vah bhi unke virdohi kheme kaa tha
 See the discrepancy that Jagdish Kashyap did not even have a name when the short story writer compiled a compilation of short stories
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki unke yogadan ko khaarij karne kii raajnneeti bahut pehle hi prarambh ho chuki thi
 Keep in mind that most of these disgruntled writers were the ones whose Jagdish Kashyap had dared to question his creativity
 prithviraj aroda ko sambodhit ek patr unke puure vyaktitv kaa aainaa ho saktaa he
 This paper has been published in the short story special issue of Kathasanasar
 patr main vyaktitv kii taralata or uskaa khurdarapan saaf najar aata he
 Kashyap ji writes in the letter- priy aroda, New Year bride, not you sister-in-law and children
 kaaran tum swayan main hi spasht nahin ho

 At present, i am busy in the last decade of Miniyug

 Right now i have written history from Vedkal to 1989
 But i am very angry with you
 Although it is my compulsion to include your short story published in 1997 in history
 


jagadish kashyap
 From the letter, we can know that the man who looked blunt and ballos from above was as holy as Ganga water from within
 yah patr baad ke varshon main jagadish kashyap kii dagamagaati manodasha kii sahi-sahi tasviir darshane ko bhi paryaapt he
 In it, they are claiming that under the pain of not writing, sometimes they used to make excuses for the next issue of Miniyug and sometimes on the pretext of working on a new novel
 isamen unki safagoi bhi he jo apni talkhi main shaleenta kii hadein paar karti hui najar aati thi
 But what is most important in this is his authorial honesty
 This is the essential element for the establishment of truth
 yahi kisi bhi sachche aalochak, sachche sahityakar kii pahchaan ho sakati he
 Jagdish Kashyap was devoted to the short story from beginning to end in his literary life
 unhone vishwaspurvak kavita manchon se laghukatha pathan kii shuruyaat kii, jise bharpoor saraahna mili
 So much affection for his genre, so much dedication is seen only in rare writers
 vidambnaa yah he ki hamaara sahitya-samaaj laghukatha ke kshetra main jagadish kashyap yogadan ko samajhane main hi asamarth rahaa
 In the compilation of the short story, edited by those 'great' short stories, not to mention the name of Jagdish Kashyap, where he shows the mentality of those litterateurs and also points towards the dirty politics in the name of literature
 , Whose biggest loss is the literature and through it the society has to bear
 bhatka hua sahitya samaaj kaa netritv karne, kisi bhi prakaar kaa adarsh sthapit karne main asamarth rahata he, parinamat: aise logon kii ban aati he jo samaaj ko vivekshunya banaakar apana swaarth-saadhan karnaa chaahate hai
 In my view, Jagdish Kashyap was one of the few writers who struggled tirelessly to enrich the Hindi short story, recognizing it as an independent genre
 ek samarpit senaanee kii tarah ve jute rahe-aaajeevan, karte rahe laghukatha andolan kaa netritv
 apni rachanaatmak prakharata kaa parichay dete hue unhone anuthi laghukathaayen likhin, acchhee laghukthaon ko chinhit kiya
 

heartedly praised their creators and even reprimanded the imitators and irresponsible minor writers
 For this, some call him the watchman of the short story and some call him the ladha of the short story
 The truth is that as long as they live, they are synonymous with short story
 ‘aalochakon ke majaar nahin banate’μunka yah sutara vaakya unhen nisprih sangharsh kii prerana detaa rahaa
 Jagdish Kashyap, who considered Khalil Jibran his literary guru, also faced all-round criticism for his frankness and outspoken comments
 Despite this, the criterion he developed for reviewing short story writing was accepted by his opponents in one way or the other
 Those who did not accept were unable to offer any fundamental option
 jagadish kashyap kii rachanaatmak prakharata kaa anumaan keval isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yadi hindi kii pachaas shreshthatam laghukthaon kaa sankalan taiyaar kiya jaae to usamen chaar-paanch laghukathaayen unheen kashyap kii hongi or yah koi choti uplabdhi nahin he

 Here is a list of incarnations mentioned in the Mahabharata and together with which god they are incarnated
 pablo emilio escobar gaviria ek colombian drug lord tha
 Pablo Escobar, once called the "greatest criminal in the world", was possibly the most trafficker of cocaine ever
 use vishwa itihaas main sabase amir or sabase kaamyaab apradhi mana jaataa he kyonki, varsh 1989 main, fors patrika ne escobar ko duniya kaa saatvaan sabase amir vyakti ghoshit kiya tha, jisaki anumaanit vyaktigat sampatti 25 billian america dollar thi
 He owned innumerable luxury accommodations and vehicles, and in 1986 he attempted to enter Colombia politics, even offering to repay the nation's $ 10 billion national debt
 Pablo Escobar is said to have burned $ 2 million in cash for the summer while traveling
 kuch inhen kisson or anya kukhyat uplabdhiyon ne escobar ko aparaadh kii duniya kaa ek maharathi bana diya
 Escobar was born to Abel de Jesus Escobar, a rural farmer, and Hemilda Gaviria, an elementary school teacher
 pablo, escobar ke ghar main chah bacchon main se ek the
 Pablo and his family lived in a house that had no electricity but had water facilities
 use or uske bhai ko ek baar skool se ghar bhej diya gaya tha kyonki pablo ke paas juute nahin the
 Escobar studied political science at Universidad de Antiochia, but was forced to stop studying when he could not collect the required fees
 This was the time when he allegedly started his criminal career by stealing grave stones and selling them to smugglers
 His brothers deny that the tomb stones came from the cemetery's owners, whose clients stopped paying for their care, and had a relative who would trade the statues legally Was
 pablo ek chalbaaz ke rup main aage badhata rahaa or usne paise kamaane ke liye vah sab kuch karnaa shuru kar diya jo vah kar saktaa tha—apane giroh ke saath chote-chote ghotaale karne se lekar varjit cigareton or nakli lottery tikaton ko bechney tak
 yahan tak ki usne bank se baahar aate hue logon se nakadi bhi lootnaa shuru kar diya
 us samay vah keval 20 varsh kaa tha or ek sampurna car chor ban gaya tha 1970 ke dashak ke aarambh main, vah ek chor or ek angrakshak tha or nashili dawaaon ke vyapaar main pravesh se pehle usne ek medelin agjicutive ke apharan or phiroti se jhatpat 100,000 dollar juta liya tha
 His next step up the ladder of success was to become a millionaire working for अलlvaro Prato, a multi-millionaire and banned smuggler
 Through his dedication and deceit, Pablo had by that time become a millionaire at the age of 22
 pablo ke bhai, roberto escobar dwaara relies kii gayi ek pustak, "da acountents story" main yah charchaa kii gayi he ki kis prakaar pablo garibi or gumnami kii sthiti se uthakar duniya ke sabase amir vyaktiyon main se ek ban gaya
 By logical point of view, the largest and most successful criminal institution in world history, the Medellin Drug Cartel smuggled 15 tons of cocaine several times a day, costing more than half a billion dollars inside the United States
 pablo ke lekhaakaar, roberto ke anusaar, uske or uske bhai ke kaarobaar main sirf nagdi kii gaddiyon ko baandhne ke liye kharide janevaale rabar band par prati saptaah 1,000dollar kharch hota tha—or chunki unke paas itnaa adhik kaala dhan tha ki ve ise bank main bhi jamaa nahin kar sakate the, phir unhone nagdi kii gaddiyon ko apane bhandargrihon main jamaa kar diya, jinamein se prativarsh 10% "raddi" ke rup main nasht hota rahaa, jab raat ko chuhon ne ghuskar sau-sau dollar ke bilon ko kutarna shuru kar diya
 In 1975, Escobar started growing his cocaine business
 He even flew a plane himself for a smuggling deal in the United States
 Then he dismantled the aircraft and hung it on top of one of his cattle farms in Hacienda Napoles
 His reputation grew further in 1975 when Fabio Restrepo, a well-known Medellin dealer, was apparently killed by Escobar, from whom he had bought 14 kg
 baad main, restrapo ke sabhi aadamiyon ko suchit kiya gaya ki ve ab pablo escobar ke liye kaam karte hai
 In May 1976, Escobar and several of his men were arrested and after returning to Medellin with a heavy load from Ecuador, they were found to have thirty-nine pounds of white paste
 aarambh main, pablo ne medelin ke un nyaayadhishon ko rishwat dene kii asafal koshish kii, jo uske viruddh maamla bana rahe the
 Instead, Pablo killed two arresting officers after several months of legal wrangling, and the case was then closed
 yahi vah samay tha jab usne adhikariyon ke saath nibatane kaa apana tarika, yaa to unhen rishwat dena yaa unki hatya kar dena, ijad kiya
 Roberto Escobar says that Pablo landed in the trade only because the ban had become so dangerous that it was difficult for traffic
 vah cocaine se bhare ek trek se, sharaab or cigarette ke 40 petiyon ke banispat kahin adhik paise kama saktaa tha
 There was no drug cartel at that time and there were only a few drug barons, so there was a lot of trade for everyone
 peru main unhone cocaine paste kharida, jise unhone medelin main ek domanjila makaan main bani ek prayogshaala main parishkrut kiya
 During his first visit, Pablo bought a modest £ 30 paste, which became his first step towards building his empire
 sabase pehle, usne vimaan ke puraane tiron main cocaine kii taskari kii or tab ek payalat prati udaan adhik se adhik 500,000 pound kama saktaa tha jo is baat par nirbhar karata tha ki vah kitne kilo kii taskari kar saktaa he
 Soon the demand for cocaine in the United States skyrocketed and Pablo arranged for more and more smuggling shipments, routes and delivery systems to South Florida, California and other parts of the USA
 He and Carlos Leder together developed a new island transit-shipment point in the Bahamas called Nourence Key
 carlos or robert vesco ne dweep kii adhikansh jameen kharid lee, jisamen 3,300 foot kii ek hawaii pattee, ek bandargah, hotel, makaane, naukaaen, vimaan or yahan tak ki cocaine ko jamaa rakhane ke liye banaaya gaya ek shitalikrut bhandargrih shaamil tha
 From 1978–1982, it was used as the central route of smuggling for the Medellin Cartel
 escobar kai million dollar kharch kar 7

1-1-1
 It is evidenced by the above example that in the first mantra of the Rigveda, Agni is called Ratna Dhatam
 aise hi aage bhi anek mantron main prayog hua he tathaa anya pracheen granth ramayana, mahabharat aadi anek granthon main bhi ratna shabd kaa varnan dekhne ko mila he
 In Vriddha Samhita, Bhavaprakash, Ras Ratna Samukhi, Ayurveda Prakash, there is a clear description of the qualities and defects of gemstones
 rugveda ke pratham shloke main hi jo ratna dhattamam shabd aayaa he

 Gemstones are formed when different elements combine with each other through a chemical process
 jaise sphatik, manibh, crystal aadi
 After this chemical process, the elements unite together to become luminous types of luminous types and the effect of many wonderful properties is also adjusted
 yah nirmit tatv hi ratna kehalaata he, jo ki apane rang, rup va gunon ke kaaran manushyon ko apni taraf aakarshith karata he

 Therefore, it is well known that gemstones are made from different chemical compounds in different quantities
 maatr kisi ek rasinic tatv se nahin banataa
 The difference in color, form, hardness and aura in gems is due to the combination of different chemical elements by location
