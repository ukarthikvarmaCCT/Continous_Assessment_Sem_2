 Then there is a description of the Punyabhuti dynasty of Sthanishwar, in which Harsha's father Prabhakarvardhan was born
 baan ne prabhakarvardhan kii putree rajyashri or kannaujadhipati grahaverma maukhari ke vivaah kaa varnan kiya he
 By sending his eldest son Rajavardhan to kill the Huns, Prabhakarvardhan became feverish
 baan ne uske rog, mrityu, dah-sanskaar evam samragi yashomati ke aatmadah kaa varnan kiya he
 Then, after hearing about the invasion of Kannauj of Gaur and Malava forces and the killing of Graha Varma, Rajyavardhana moved towards Kannauj
 shatruon ne hathiyaar daal die
 But played smartly
 rajyavardhan ko shatru shivi main aamantrit kiya gaya or unki nirmam hatya kar di gai
 Harsha vowed to avenge the murder of his brother-in-law and brother and proceeded towards Kannauj
 harsh kii badhati hui sena ke saamne shatru bhaag niklaa
 Hearing this, there was no end to Harsha's astonishment that Rajyashree left from captivity and went towards Vindhyachal
 bahut parishramyukt khoj ke pashchaat harsh ne aatmadah karne ko tatpar rajyashri ko divakar mitra rishi ke ashram ke paas paaya or ganga ke tat par apane shivi main le aayaa
 Here the script ends abruptly
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki baan kaa vichaar harsh ke charitra ko purnroopen likhane kaa nahin tha
 He wanted to write only one part of it because he told his listeners' Harsha's life cannot be described even in hundreds of lives
 yadi aap uskaa ek ansh sunanaa chaahate ho to main taiyaar hoon
 It is also rightly said that 'joyful' is only an incident in Harsha's life because the historical knowledge available from Harsha Charit is very less
 parantu is granth kii samalochna karte hue hamen ise aitihaasik rachana ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie

 He has not even given the names of Bhoota Gaur and Malav kings, who represent the masterpiece
 bhoomi ko gaudon se shunya karne ke harsh ke nishchay hone par bhi, baan ne gaudon kii bhavi ghatnaon ko chhod diya he
 Where readers are eager to listen to the result of the discovery of Harsha from Vindhyaparvat, Baan is engaged in making a subtle description of Vindhyaparvata
 astu, baan ne harsh kii prasthaan karti hui sena kaa, rajyasabha kaa, dharmik sampradaayon kaa, graamon kaa sundar chitra prastut kiya he jo ki itihaas kii drushti se bahut mahatvapurn he Swahili Wikipedia is the Swahili-language version of Wikipedia

 The Baghdawat Devanarayana folklore begins with Mandalji, the brother of King Bisaldevji of Ajmer, who was the ancestor of Devnarayan
 mandalji ke bade bhai raja bisaldevaji unhen ghode kharidne ke liye mewar bhejte hai
 Upon reaching Mewar, Raja Mandal Chauhan Gurjar buys some horses, but he spends a lot of money to build a pond and asks for more money from his brother who keeps sending them
 bisaldevaji yah pataa karne aate hai ki mandalji itane saare paiso kaa kya kar rahe hai
 When Mandalji realizes that his elder brother Bisaldevji is coming, then he gets down with a horse and takes water samadhi in the pond he had built

 budhiya unhen sher ke bare main bataati hai, or kahati hai ki mere do bete the, ek betaa pehle hi sher kaa bhojan ban chukaa he or aaj raat duusare bete kii baari he
 Hearing this, Hariramji tells Budhia that mother, i go today to replace your son with a lion's meal
 jangal main jaakar hariramji aate kaa ek putala banaakar apni jagah rakh dete hai or khud paas kii jhaadi main chup jate hai

 Decomposition is the fifth state of the body after death
 marane ke baad sabase pehle sharir pilaa padana shuru ho jaataa he
 Then comes a different moment
 phir sharir kathor hona shuru ho jaataa he
 Then comes a live moment
 or ye sabhi prakriya puri hone ke baad ant main sharir sadana shuru hota he
 During this process, the dead body of a human or animal begins to perish, or begins to rot
 vistaar se dekhen to sadan kaa matlab protein kaa vighatan hona, utakon ke bich saamanjasy kaa tootna tathaa angon kaa draveekaran ho janaa hota he
 It is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion
 joki sharir main gaison kaa utpaadan karte hai, jo utakon or shaareerik ango ke kshay kaa kaaran banati hai
 The exact time of body decay depends on many different reasons
 andruni kaarak jo ki sharir ke sadane ke samay ko prabhavit karte hai, uname mukhyata he, umr arthath kis umr main vyakti ki mrityu hui, marane kaa kaaran kya tha or kisi chot ki vajah se mrityu hui
 The external factors that affect the sediment include the temperature of the place, humidity, air flow, clothing and light etc

 Breakdown of the decomposed body proteins is a spontaneous process
 kosiya protein kaa jeevanu pachan sharir ke utakon ko kamazor kar detaa he
 As proteins begin to break down into smaller components, bacteria begin to discolor gas and organic matter
 lagaataar babbti gas ki maatr utakon kon or kamazor kr detii he or ant main ve tuutane lagate hai
 Constant gas formation, breakdown of protein, all these processes eventually change the body structure, the whole body starts decomposing
 jivanuo ke is lagaataar kriya ke kaaran sharir main ithenul bhi banane lagata he, jo ki sharir main postmortem main alcohol ki sahi maatra kaa pataa lagane main mushkil paidaa karata he
 The decomposition of the body is the biochemical process that begins after the death of a life and continues until it is transformed into a body structure

 David Imile Durkheim was a great sociologist in France
 karl marks tathaa maiks webar ke saath ve bhi aadhunik samaaj vigyaan ke mukhya shilpi evam samajashaastra ke janak kahe jate hai
 David Emile Durkheim is considered the founder of modern sociology and the first official sociologist in the world in sociological terms
 adhyayan kii vishvavidhyalayan vyavastha main ve samajashaastra ke pehle profesar bhi the
 In the three decades of his academic life, he not only established sociology as a specific discipline, but also laid the theoretical and methodological ground of this discipline
 durkhime kii samajashastreey sankalpana kaa vidheyak tatva manushya ko saamaajik sambandhon kaa parinaam maanata he
 For this reason Durkheim's sociology refuses to recognize any form of individualism in its infrastructure
 manushya kii iyatta ko samaaj kii upaj maanane ke sandarbh main durkhime comt, marks, webar aadi saamaajik chintakon ke nazadik baithte hai
 It is important to consider that the person is the product of the society and giving central importance to the social phenomenon itself gives sociology a distinct form compared to other disciplines
 samajashaastra kii yah vishistataa durkhime ke bina sambhav nahin thi
 Although Durkheim has also thought intensively on issues ranging from thinkers like Montescue and Rousseau to pragmatism, socialism and moral education, his four works in the field of sociology - 'the Division of Labor', 'the Rules of Socioeconomic Method', ' Suicide 'and' The Elementary Forms of the Release's Life 'are considered most important
 david emil durkhime kaa janm apinal, loren ke ek francisi yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 Both his father and grandfather were rabbis
 unki shuruaati shiksha bhi ek dharmik skool main hui, lekin jivan ke shuru main hi unhone puri tarah se secular jivan guzaarane kaa nishchay kiya
 As an undergraduate student, he enrolled in the renowned Ecol Normale Superiorie and in 1886, as part of his doctorate, he created 'the Division of Labor in Society'
 is rachana main durkhime aadhunik or parmparik samaajon kaa fark dikhaate hue yah pratipaadit karte hai ki aadhunik samaaj jahaan shram ke vishesheekaran par aadhaarit hota he vahiin parmparik samaaj saajhe vishwaason par chalata he
 According to him, this difference of forms of society also reflects the difference in the system of rules
 is tarah aadhunik samaaj swa- niyaman se sanchalit hota he jabaki parmparik samaaj ke niyam bahari vishwaason or anumodan par tike hote hai
 According to Durkheim, since shared beliefs rest on the authority of common morality, a system based on these beliefs can only be sustained through power and pressure
 jabaki swaniyamkaari yaa aadhunik samaaj swatantraaa, samanta tathaa nyaay jaise tattvon ke bina santulit nahin rah saktaa
 Scholars believe that this formulation of looking at the diversity of social forms by linking them to specific frameworks of rules has been a fundamental driving force for sociological studies of crime and law
 durkhime maanate the ki samaaj ke parmparik or aadhunik roopon main vibhram ke kaaran tathaa aadhunik samaajon par parmparik kanoon yaa niyam thopane kii pravriti hi kai saamaajik samasyaon ke liye jimmedaar rahi he
 This interpretation of modern societies is considered a distinct achievement of Durkheim's work
 is rachana main durkhime vyakti ke saamaajik saahchary yaa judaav kaa vishleshan karte hue yah vichaar bhi rakhte hai ki vyakti ko khaas tarah kii saamaajik saahchary kii zarurat padati he
 Durkheim shows that within social institutions there is an element of self which demands a certain behavior from its partners
 durkhime isiilie is baat par jor dete the ki vyakti ke bajaay saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 According to him the concrete form of these social processes is expressed in institutions and behavior which can also be studied on the basis of monitoring
 durkhime in prakriyaaon ko soshal facts yaa saamaajik tathyon kii sangya dete hai
 Durkheim is also known for his creative use of statistics in sociological studies 
 is sambandh main unki rachana suiside ek maanak kii tarah sthapit he
 In this work Durkheim proposed that different rates of suicide can be interpreted on the basis of differences in the individual's levels of social affiliation
 masalan, unhone dikhaaya ki vyakti kii nijee pravritiyon ke aadhaar par is baat kaa andaaza nahin lagaaya ja saktaa ki umrdaraj purush hi kyon aatmahatya karte hai
 But if the factors of a person's social status such as his being unmarried or his isolation from society, etc
, the cause of suicide can be identified
 durkhime apane adhyayan main sankhyikee kaa istemaal saamaajik tathyon jaise kisi samooh ke sadasyon ke aapasi saahchary ke roopon kii takat yaa charitra ujagar karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, if the feeling of mutual companionship is weak in a group, then there will be more chances of moral or psychological problems in its members
 iske ulat agar kisi samooh main saahchary kii bhaavana bahut gahari ho to uske sadsy apane samooh ke liye tyaag karne ke liye zyaada tatpar paye jaaenge
 Durkheim's other work, 'the Rules of Socioecological Method', is considered to be the cornerstone of the methods used in sociology
 is rachana main durkhime spasht karte hai ki samajashaastra kii kendriya vishay- vastu saamaajik vyavastha he, lihaaza usamen vyakti ke bajaay samaaj ke saansthanik or vyavasthaagat roopon ko pramukhataa di jaani chahie
 In this composition Durkheim describes sociology as a study of such social facts
 unke anusaar in saamaajik tathyon ke bich ek khaas tarah kii sangati hoti he jise keval unke nirmaankari anshon kaa sanchit parinaam nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In his work Suicide, Durkheim wanted to clarify the same point that even a private phenomenon like suicide can be explained on the basis of people's associative relationships and social bonding
 unki daleel thi ki vyakitgat bhavanaaen, mulya yaa vichaar jaisi chijen vastav main saamaajik sahabhaagita se hi upajati hai
 Durkheim's two compositions, 'the Division of Labor' and 'the Elementary Forms of the Religious Life', are known to use modern approaches to the then social order
 aadhuniktaa ke samajashastreey vimarsh main ye donon rachanaayen apane baarik or saghan adhyayan ke kaaran aaj bhi ek anivaary sandarbh bani hui hai
 Durkheim's contemplation was modern in a deep sense
 froid jaise manovishleshak bhi apane samay ke purvagrahon se mukt nahin ho paye the or apni kriti totum and tabu main aadim dimaag kii tulana maansik rogi se kar baithe the, jabaki durkhime ne apni rachana alementary forms of da relijas life main yah pratipaadit kiya ki tarkbuddhi ke lihaaz se aadim kabeelon kii saamaajik sanrachanaayen or vishwaas aadhunik manushya kii tarkbuddhi se kamatar nahin tehraye ja sakate
 This was a bold idea given the political ramifications prevailing in Durkheim's time
 chunki durkhime tarkbuddhi ko saamaajik utpaada maanate hai isiilie manushya ko kamatar yaa shreshthatar sabit karne vaale vichaar ko ve sire se kaarij kar dete hai
 Durkheim's intervention has equipped sociology with a basic egalitarianism
 ukt rachana main dharm kii saamaajik upyogita par vichaar karte hue durkhime yah daleel pesh karte hai ki manushya dharmik reeti-rivaazon tathaa karmkandon main bhagidaari ke zariye hi maanviya tarkbuddhi ke buniyadi roopon- spes, samay, vargeekaran, shakti, kaary-kaaran kii samaj tathaa sampoornataa kaa bodh arjeet karata he
 Durkheim also introduces the idea that the social experience of purity gives rise to social interrelations
 unke mutabik saamaajik vyakti kaa janm tathaa tarkbuddhi kaa vikaas bhi isi prakriya se nirast hota he
 Durkheim also says in this work that all concepts originate from society
 isliye tark, bhashaa or arth kii samaj viksit karne ke liye is baat kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki shabdon or avadharanaon kaa kin saamaajik roopon or sandarbhon main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Here, Durkheim describes religion as a function of society and makes another important formulation that religion is a means of maintaining social order
 durkhime dharmik vishwaason kii satyata ko sidhe to nahin nakaarte lekin unke liye dharm kaa satya uski is kshamta se tay hota he ki vah karmkandon ko protsaahit kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 According to him, organized religions cannot be understood only on the basis of beliefs, because such religions are often found while suppressing personal faith to keep traditional forms of society intact
 aadhunik or parmparik samaajon main dharm kii bhoomika ko lekar durkhime kaa yah sutara bhi kaabile gaur he ki samaaj kii in do alag kismon main dharm ke prakaarya ek jaise nahin hote
 Religion is a tool of social control in traditional societies whereas in modern societies its function becomes non-essential because in modern societies it becomes a function of knowledge and epistemology
 isiilie saamaajik vyavastha main uski bhoomika pehle jaisi nahin rah jaati
 Durkheim's conclusion that sociopolitical thinking would be considered an achievement is that the phenomenon of a human being transforming from a biological being to a social animal cannot be explained on the basis of one's biological abilities or psychology
 unki daleel he ki jaivik kaa saamaajik main roopantaran saamaajik prakriyaaon ke madhyam se sampann hota he
 Therefore, Durkheim feels that the opinion that the mind and body are called two separate rights, only shows the difference between biological existence and social animal standing outside the process of society
 unke anusaar pehali avasthaa ke praani ko rashnal manushya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 They also emphasize that in human beings, things like rationality or personality arise from the process of society itself
 durkhime kaa mat tha ki manushya ko ek saamaajik praani ke rup main banaaye rakhane ke liye saamaajik prakriyaaon or saahchary ke khaas roopon kii darkaar hoti he
 That is, a social man cannot be seen apart from his fixed social configuration and context
 isliye durkhime aagaah bhi karte hai ki agar manovigyaan, arthshaastra yaa darshanashastra ke adhyayan kii koi paddati saamaajik parighatna ko keval vyaktiyon kii sanchit gatividhiyon ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa upkram karti he to use samaaj jaise sabase mahatvapurn paksh ko darkinar karne kaa doshi samajha janaa chahie
 hgfrtew Despite egalitarianism's apparent reputation in Durkheim's contemplation and work, feminist analysts say she has not paid enough attention to the issue of women
 ek had tak yah baat sahi he ki samajashastri ke taur par durkhime kii koi bhi rachana stri-paksh par ekagra nahin he
 But at the time of the nineteenth century when Durkheim was organizing sociology, very few social thinkers were considering the questions of women
 suiside main unhone aatmahatya kii ek bhagyavaadee kism kaa zikr kiya he jise ve mukhyatah striyon ke saath jod kar dekhte hai
 Durkheim also thought that marriage is beneficial for men but it has a negative effect on the lives of women
 da divizan of lebar main durkhime muulavaasiyon ke hawaale se bataate hai ki aise samudaayon main striyon kii saamaajik sthiti purushon ke mukaable kamatar nahin thim jabaki iske ulat aadhunik samaajon main stri kii haisiyat kamazor hoti gayi he
 The average tendency of erstwhile society portrayed the woman as soft and weak
 ise dekhte hue durkhime kii drushti nishchay hi agragami kahi jaaegi
 Durkheim's contribution has been a matter of inspiration, questioning, inclusion and cross-examination for many generations of sociologists
 tees ke dashak main talcott parcens ne durkhime ke krititv ko sanrachanaatmak prakaaryawad main sametane kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, Durkheim's contribution to America began to be viewed through formalism and positivism
 jabaki frans main unki drushti kaa levi-stros jaise maanavshastriyon ne upyog kiya jinaki dilchaspee durkhime dwaara pratipaadit sankalpanaaon, vichaaron or samaaj ke antarsambandhon ke aadhaar par ek pratikwaadi maanavshaastra rachane main thi
 But this venture to make a new interpretation based on Durkheim's ideas proved to be one-sided in that he used only certain parts of Durkheim's original preface
 marxvaadi dhara ke samajashastriyon ne apane lekhan main durkhime ke chintan main nihit radical swaroop ko mahatva dete hue parcens ke drushtikon ko pratisantulit karne kaa prayaas kiya he jo durkhime ko raajnneetik rup se roodhiwaadee sabit karne par jor detaa he
 a group of sociologists believe that Durkheim's sociology is secondary to the individual
 lekin dhyaan se dekhen to durkhime aisa iradatan karte hai
 His vision urges society to be understood as collectivism and emphasizes that the basic aim of sociology is to be synonymous with individualism if it does not pay attention to the investigation of social theories and the study of contradictions in the practice of sociology
 Is canceled
 durkhime ke tain samajashaastra kaa kaam yah nahin he ki vah darshanashastreey sandhan ke liye kachi saamagree muhaiyaa karaaye or phir is baat kaa intazaar kare ki darshanikon kaa khemaa apane moolyankan main kya kahata he
 On the other hand, Durkheim argues that sociology should formulate the criteria for the study of social facts
 unhone darshanashastriyon kii is daleel ko kaarij kar diya ki saamaajik tathyon main aakasmikta kaa tatva hota he
 While giving a well thought out response to this criticism, Durkheim said that certain types of and permanent forms are necessary to maintain the continuity of society
