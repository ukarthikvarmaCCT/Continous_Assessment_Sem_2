 The roots of al-qaeda can be traced back to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan
 Immediately after the invasion, Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan, where he helped organize the Arab Mujahideen and founded the Maktab al-khidmat) organization to resist the Soviets
 sangh soviet ke saath yuddh ke dauraan, bin laden or uske ladaakon ko dhan america or saudi arab se praapt hua tha, america or adhikansh saudi dhan pakistan kii khufia seva iesai ke madhyam se aapurti kii gai thi
 When the Soviet Union retreated in 1989, the MAK was transformed into a "quick reaction force" in jihad against governments throughout the Muslim world
 ayman al-zawaahiri ke maargdarshan main osama bin laden adhik kattarpanthi ban gaya
 In 1996, bin Laden issued his first fatwa, which said that American soldiers should leave Saudi Arabia

 The idea of the September 11 plot came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who presented the idea to Osama bin Laden in 1996
 is samay, sudan se waapas afghanistan sthanantarit hokar, bin laden or al kaayda sankraman kii avasthaa main the
 The 1998 bombing of the African Embassy and the 1998 edict of bin Laden marked a new twist, with bin Laden intending to attack America
 disambar 1998 main, nideshak kendriya khufia aatankwaad pratirodhi centre ne raashtrapati bill clinton ko report di ki apane karmiyon ko vimaan apharan kaa prashikshan dene ke saath, al-kaayda america main hamalon kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden approved Mohammed to proceed with the plot
 a series of meetings took place in the spring of 1999 between Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden and his Naib Mohammad Attef
 mohammad ne, lakshya ke chunaav tathaa aparankartaaon kii yatra kii vyavastha main sahaayta sahit sajeesh hetu kriyaatmak sahyog pradaan kiya
 Bin Laden overturned Mohammed's selection, rejecting such important goals as the US Bank Tower in Los Angeles because "there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation"
 bin laden ne aarthik sahaayta ke saath, sajeesh ke liye netritv pradaan kiya or vah sajeesh ke liye pratibhaagiyon ke chayan main shaamil tha
 Bin Laden initially selected veteran jihadists Nawaf al-hazmi and Khalid al-mihadhar who fought in Bosnia

 Binalshibh also gave bin Laden's message that the attacks should be carried out as quickly as possible

 Bin Laden initially denied it, but later accepted participation in the events

 "this denial was broadcast on news channels in the US and around the world
 november 2001 main america sena ne jalalabad, afghanistan main ek nasht makaan se baraamad ek video tepe baraamad kiya jisamen osama bin laden khalid al-harabi se baat kar rahaa tha
 In the tape, Laden confessed that he had foreknowledge of the attacks
 is tepe ko 13 disambar 2001 se vibhinn samachar network par prasaarit kiya gaya
 The tape transfer technique has been attributed to its distorted image on the tape

 On 27 December 2001, a second video of bin Laden was released

 In his taped statement, shortly before the US presidential election in 2004, bin Laden publicly acknowledged al-qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the US and acknowledged his direct contact with the attacks
 usne kaha ki hamale kiye gaye the, "kyonki ham azaad hai
 

and want to regain independence for our country
 jis prakaar aap hamaari suraksha ko kamjor samajhate hai, usee prakaar ham aapaki suraksha ko kamjor samajhate hai

 On 26 September 2005, on the direction of Judge Baltasar Thunder, the Spanish High Court sentenced Abu Dahdah to 27 years imprisonment for conspiring in the 9 / 11 attack and being a member of the terrorist organization al-qaeda
 At the same time, the other 17 al-qaeda members were sentenced to sentences ranging from six years to eleven years
 On 16 February 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court reduced Dahdah's penalty to 12 years because he thought his involvement in the conspiracy was not proven
 hamalon ke uddeshyon main se ek, saudi arab main america upasthiti he
 Israel's support by the US, and sanctions against Iraq
 al-qaeda clearly stated these objectives in the declarations before the attacks, including an August 1996 fatwa and a small fatwa published in February 1998
 hamalon ke baad, bin laden or al zawaahiri ne atirikt video tepe or audio tepe prakashit kiye, jinamein se kuch main hamale ke kaarnon ko doharaaya gaya tha
 Two particularly important publications were bin Laden's 2002 "letter to America", and the 2004 bin Laden videotape
 In addition to direct declarations by bin Laden and al-qaeda, many political analysts have conceived motivations for the attacks

 In a 1999 interview with Rahimulla Yusufzai, bin Laden said, he felt that Americans were "very close to Mecca" and considered it provocative to the entire Muslim world
 november 2002 main apane "america ke liye patr" main bin laden ne israyal ko sanyukt rajya america ke samarthan ko ek prerana bataaya: israyal kaa nirmaan or uski nirantarata sabase bade aparaadhon main se ek he or aap in aparaadhiyon ke netaa hai
 And of course there is no need to explain or prove the amount of US support for Israel
 israyal kaa nirmaan ek aparaadh he jise mitaa dena chahie
 Each and every person whose hands have been polluted by contributing to this crime, will have to pay the price for it and pay a heavy price
 " 2004 or 2010 main, bin laden ne phir se 11 sitambar ke hamalon or sanyukt rajya america dwaara israyal ke samarthan ke bich sambandh ko doharaaya
 Many analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also consider Israel's support by the United States as the motivation for the attacks

on this basis and in compliance with the command of Allah, we issue this fatwa to Muslims: "every Muslim's decision to kill Americans and their allies - civilians or soldiers - is a duty of Muslims
 

" In addition to the objectives published by Al Qaeda, analysts have suggested other objectives, including insults arising from the Islamic world lagging behind the Western world, a discrepancy that appears particularly due to recent globalization

 The prevailing statement regarding Kabir's Guru is that Kabir was looking for a suitable Guru
 vah vaishnav sant acharya ramanand ko apana apana guru bananaa chaahate the lekin unhone kabir ko shishy banane se manaa kar diya lekin kabir ne apane man main thaan liya ki swami ramanand ko hi har keemat par apana guru banaaungaa ,iske liye kabir ke man main ek vichaar aayaa ki swami ramanand ji subah chaar baje ganga snaan karne jate hai uske pehle hi unke jane ke maarg main sidhiyon let jaaounga or unhone aisa hi kiya
 One day, Kabir fell on the stairs of the Panchganga Ghat as soon as one night
 ramanand ji gangasnan karne ke liye seedhiyaan utar rahe the ki tabhi unka pair kabir ke sharir par pad gaya
 The word 'ram-ram' immediately came out of his mouth
 usee ram ko kabir ne diksha-mantra maan liya or ramanand ji ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya
 In Kabir's own words- jivicoparjan ke liye kabir julahe kaa kaam karte the
 Kabir had a strong belief that one gets his end in accordance with his deeds and not because of particular place
 apni is manyata ko siddh karne ke liye ant samay main vah magahar chale gaye ;kyonki logon manyata thi ki kaashi main marane par swarg or magahar main marane par narak miltaa he

 Kabir's Ram is not even a monotheistic, monotheistic God of Islam
 islam main khuda yaa allaah ko samast jagat evam jeevon se bhinn evam param samarth mana jaataa he
 But Ram of Kabir may be supremely capable, but he is never different from all beings and the world
 balki iske vipareet ve to sabamein vyaapt rahane vaale ramata ram hai
 He says that the universal Brahman Sabnimayi I, will worship the Pandit
 ravan-raav kawnasuun kavan veda ko rogi
 Kabir does not imagine any special design of Rama, because Rama would be bound in a particular structure as soon as he imagined the design, which was not acceptable to Kabir under any circumstances
 kabir ram kii avadharana ko ek bhinn or vyapak swaroop dena chaahate the
 There were some specific reasons for this, which we will discuss further in this article
 kintu iske baavjood kabir ram ke saath ek vyaktigat paariwarik kism kaa sambandh jarur sthapit karte hai
 His love for Rama is distinguished by his supernatural and glorious power without forgetting even a single moment on the surface of a spontaneous romantic human relationship
 kabir naam main vishwaas rakhte hai, rup main nahin
 Although it is commonly distinguished in the principles of devotion-sensation that 'the name is greater than the form', Kabir made this general principle a revolutionary use
 kabir ne ram-naam ke saath lokmanas main shatabdiyon se rache-based sanshlisht bhaavon ko udaatt evam vyapak swaroop dekar use puraana-pratipaadit brahmanvaadi vichaardhaara ke khaanche main baandhe jane se rokane kii koshish kii
 Kabir's Ram is beyond the distinction of nirgun-saguna
 darasal unhone apane ram ko shaastra-pratipaadit avtari, sagun, varchaswashil varnashram vyavastha ke sangrakshak ram se alag karne ke liye hi ‘nirgun ram’ shabd kaa prayog kiya–‘nirgun ram japahu re bhai
 There is no need to get confused about this 'nirguna' word
 kabir kaa aashay is shabd se sirf itnaa he ki ishwar ko kisi naam, rup, gun, kaal aadi kii simaaon main bandha nahin ja saktaa
 Those who are beyond all limits and still everywhere, are Nirgun Rama of Kabir
 ise unhone ‘ramata ram’ naam diya he
 Despite giving his Nirguna adjective to Rama, Kabir talks of a kind of human love affair with him
 kabhi vah ram ko maadhurya bhav se apana premi yaa pati maan lete hai to kabhi daasya bhav se swami
 Sometimes he considers Rama as the mother of Vatsalya idol and himself as his son
 nirgun-niraakaar brahm ke saath bhi is tarah kaa saras, sahaj, maanviya prem kabir kii bhakthi kii vilakshantaa he
 This dilemma and problem may occur to others that how Ram, with whom Kabir is so unique, human relational, can be good, but it is not a problem for Kabir himself
 vah kehete bhi hai “santau, dhokhaa kaasuun kahiye
 Gunam i nirgun, nirgunam gun, baat chaandi kya bahis! profesar mahavir saran jain ne kabir ke ram evam kabir kii sadhana ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha he : " kabir kaa sara jivan satya kii khoj tathaa asaty ke khandan main vyateet hua
 Kabir's cultivation begins by knowing "not obeying"
 ve kisi ke shishy nahin, ramanand dwaara chetaye hue chela hai
 For him, Rama is not a form, Dasharathi is not Rama, his Rama is a symbol of spiritual practice
 unke ram kisi sampradaay, jati yaa desh kii simaaon main kaid nahin he
 In the particle of nature, even in Ramana in the limb, which one cannot touch, he is Alakh, the imperishable, the supreme element Rama
 unke ram manushya or manushya ke bich kisi bhed-bhav ke kaarak nahin hai
 They are the symbols of the element of love
 bhav se upar uthakar mahabhaav yaa prem ke aradhy hai - 'prem jagavai virah ko, virah jagavai piu, piu jagavai jeeva, joi piu soi jiu' - the one who is piu is the same creature

 This goose cannot be revived by the reading of Pothis, and two and a half can be done only by the conduct of love
 dharm odhane kii cheez nahin he, jivan main aacharan karne kii satat satya sadhana he
 His practice begins with love
 itnaa gaharaa prem karo ki vahi tumhaare liye paramatma ho jaae
 There is so much eagerness to get it that one becomes the most reclusive, disrespectful, only then can that meditation be awakened in meditation
 vahi piu tumhaare arntman main baithe jeev ko jagaa saktaa he

 All arrogance, all malice will go away

 With this great spirit, the whole world becomes Piu's home

 Rama marched to Lanka to rescue Sita
 unhone ladaai ke bina sitaaji ko chhudwane kaa bahut praytn kiya, par jab ram safalataa na mili to vivash hokar unhone yuddh kiya

 Both these Shivling are worshiped in the main temple of this shrine even today

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift

 Main article: History of Evolutionism prastaav he ki ek prakaar kaa ek jeev duusare prakaar se utar saktaa he, kuch purv-secretic greek darshanikon jaise ki aneximundar or empodoclas main waapas jaataa he
 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still looked at species determined according to a divine plan

 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents
 Is obtained

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians
 , Which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and was praised by Charles Darwin Did

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around
 yah, udhaaharan ke liye, kaaran jeev dhire-dhire sabhi ek hi oonchaai ban jaaenge
 a special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is the selection for any trait that enhances the success of sexual intercourse and the attractiveness of creatures of potential friends

 This knowledge was transmitted in joy from Mahakashyapa
 is tarah yah gyanadhara guru-shishy parampara se nirantar pravaahit hoti rahi
 In India, Bodhidharma became the twenty-seventh and last guru of this tradition

 Have i benefited from these works? bodhidharm - bilkul nahin
 Boo-ti - What is real virtue? bodhidharm - vishuddh pragna, jo shunya, sookshm, purna evam shant he
 But the attainment of this virtue is not possible in the world
 bu-ti - sabase pavitra dharm siddhanth koun he? Bodhidharma - Where everything is nothing, nothing holy can be said there
 bu-ti - tab mere saamne khadaa koun baat kar rahaa he? Bodhidharma - i do not know

 In fact, he told the king that donating, building viharas, etc
, are not more important, they are eternal
 is prakaar unhone samraat ko ahambhaav se bachaaya or shoonyata ke ucch satya kaa upadesh kiya, jo punya-paap pavitra-apavitra sat-asat aadi dvandvon or prapanchon se ateet he
 After seeing the above offering, Bodhidharma, seeing no benefit in staying there, crossed the yansi-tsi river and went to a kingdom called Bei in northern China
 iske baad unka adhiktar samay un rajya kii rajdhani lo-yaks ke sameep shug-shan parvat par sthit 'shaashv-shaanti' naamak vihaar main beetaa, jiskaa nirmaan paanchavin shatee ke purvarddh main hua tha
 Bodhidharma was enchanted as soon as he saw this magnificent vihara and folded hands and stood in front of the vihara for four days
 yaheen nau varsh tak rahete hue bodhidharm ne dhyaan kii bhaavana kii
 They stood in front of the wall
 yaheen nau varsh tak rahete hue bodhidharm ne dhyaan kii bhaavana kii
 He used to meditate facing the wall

 Previously he was a follower of Kunfusian religion

 He stood at the door for seven days and seven nights, but Bodhidharma was not allowed to meet
 jaade kii raat main maidan main khadey rahane ke kaaran barf unke ghutanon tak jam gai, phir bhi guru ne krupa nahin kii
 Then Shan-kkung cut off his left arm with a sword and appeared near the Guru with it and said that if he did not get discipleship, he would sacrifice his body too
 tab guru ne uski ore dhyaan dekar poocha ki tum mujhase kya chaahate ho? shain-kkang ne bilakhte hue kaha ki mujhe man kii shaanti chahie
 Bodhidharma said sternly that take your mind out in front of me, i will calm it down
 tab shain-kkang ne rote hue kaha ki main man ko kaise nikaal kar aap ko de saktaa hoon? is par kuch vinamr hokar karunaa karte hue bodhidharm ne kaha- main tumhaare man ko shant kar chukaa hoon
 Immediately Shan-qang experienced peace, all his doubts were dispelled, and intellectual conflicts were forever erased
 shain-kkang china main dhyaan sampradaay ke dwitiya dharmanayake hue
 Before departing from China, Bodhidharma called his disciples and asked about his achievements
 unamem se ek shishy ne kaha ki meri samaj main satya vidhi or nishedh donon se pare hai
 This is the way to communicate truth
 bodhidharm ne kaha- tumhen meri twachaa praapt he
 After this another monk disciple said that truth is seen only once, never again, Bodhidharma said that you have got my flesh
 iske baad tisare shishy ne kaha ki chaaron mahabhoot or paanchon skandh shunya hai or asat he
 There is no object acceptable in true form
 bodhidharm ne kaha ki tumhen meri haddiyaan praapt hai
 Finally, Hui-ke came and bowed and did not say anything, stood quietly in his place
 bodhidharm ne is shishy se kaha ki tumhen meri charbi praapt he
 Only after this did Bodhidharma enter
 antim baar jin logon ne unhen dekha, unka kahana he ki ve nange pair tsug-ling parvatashrenee main hokar pashchim kii ore ja rahe the or apana ek juuta haath main liye the
 Later, at the behest of these people, the tomb of Bodhidharma was opened in Loyang, but nothing other than a shoe was found in it

 Nature is a great use in the realization of truth in the meditation community
 prakruti hi dhyani santon kaa shaastra he
 In the process of the attainment of knowledge, they resort to nature and as a result of its ingrained influence, it is possible to have an immediate incarnation of truth in consciousness
 bodhidharm ke vichaaron ke anusaar vastutatva ke gyaan ke liye pragna kii antardrushti kii aavashyak he, jo tathyata tak sidhe pravesh kar jaati he
 It does not require any argument or inference

 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
