 Ices: varun, naptune yaa napchayune hamaare saura mandal main surya se aathvaan grah he
 It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the third largest planet by mass
 varun kaa dravyaman prithvi se 17 guna adhik he or apane padosi grah arun se thodaa adhik he
 According to the celestial unit, Varuna's orbit is at an average distance of 30
1 km from the sun, that is, Varun is about thirty times more than the sun in comparison to the Earth
 varun ko suraj kii ek puri parikrama karne main 164

 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size

 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"
 varun pehla grah tha jisaki astitv kii bhavishyavaanee use bina kabhi dekhe hi ganit ke adhyayan se kii gayi thi or jise phir us aadhaar par khoja gaya
 This happened when some strange disturbances were found in Arun's orbit, which could only mean that an unknown neighbor is exerting its gravitational influence on him
 khagol main khojbin karne ke baad yah agyaat grah 23 sitambar 1846 ko pehali dafaa doorabeen se dekha gaya or iskaa naam "naptune" rakh diya gaya
 "neptune" was the god of the sea in the ancient Roman religion, the place of the god "varuna" in ancient India, so this planet is called Varuna in Hindi
 roman dharm main naptune ke haath main trishul hota tha isliye varun kaa khagolashastriy chinh ♆ he
 Where the planet Arun looks like just a sphere with no marks or spots on it, there is a clear cloud, storm and change of weather on Varun
 mana jaataa he ke varun par tufaani hawa saura mandal ke kisi bhi grah se zyaada tej chalati he or 2,100 kimi prati ghanta tak kii gatiyaan dekhi ja chuki hai
 When the Voyager II vehicle passed by Varun in 1989, Varun saw a "big thick spot", which has been compared to Jupiter's "big red spots"
 kyonki varun suraj se itnaa dur he, isliye uskaa upree vayumandal bahut hi thanda he or vahaan kaa taapmaana -128 °centegrade tak gir saktaa he
 Due to its large size, the temperature of the planet reaches 5,000 ° c due to the severe pressure of its gravity in the center of the planet
 varun ke ird-gird kuch chhitare-se upgrahi challe bhi hai jinhen wayager dwitiya ne dekha tha
 The light blue color of Varuna comes from the methane gas present in its upper atmosphere

 On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first mass-centric En orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not show in its exact position in our skies, as the Earth was in a different location in its 365
25-day orbit
 Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 july Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011

 The work done in the direction of a virtual displacement by a force on a particle is called 'virtual work or imaginary work'
 abhaasi kaary ke siddhanth kii sahaayta se kisi yantric tantra par lagane vaale balon evam unke kaaran hue visthaapan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The principle of virtual function is derived from the least action rule

 If you use this principle in the context of the equilibrium of a mechanical system, then one can say that the sum of virtual actions done by all the forces on a system is zero
 abhaasi kaary = bal x abhaasi visthaapan
 By applying the principle of virtual force to a mechanical system, as many equations can be obtained as the 'degree of freedom' of that system
 dhyaan rahe ki abhaasi visthaapan atyant sookshm liye jate hai taaki balon kii dishaao evam duriyon ke sambandh aparivartit rahen

 This type of thought pervaded many texts and sects during Buddha's time

 Monolithicism, dictatorship or dictatorship is the government of a person who has not gained power as a result of succession of governance and who has absolute sovereignty - that is, not only the entire political power arises from the resolve of the same but unlimited in terms of scope and time

 In this situation, the democratic system seemed to disintegrate
 falat: yuddh se sarvaadhik prabhavit deshon main saamanyat: log aise 'louhpurush' ke swaagat ke liye tatpar the jo apane shaury, aatmavishvaas or katibaddhta ke bal par unka mat liye bina raashtra ke naam par apni ichha tathaa aadesh se samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar de
 Therefore, for the people, generally, a monknayak became a hard working person who himself could become a national emblem with a mystical charm to awaken a sense of respect for himself and make people feel great on the basis that they are related to him
 ekadhinaayakatv kii pratham visheshta uske udgam main hai

 uske liye yah aavashyak he ki uski neenv vidhaan ke ulanghan par ho, yadhyapi uskaa astitv kisi vidhaan ke na maanane par ashrith nahin he

 Its second major feature is that unlike democracy, it operates in the hands of one person or class to rule over others
 tisare, sattadhari khule dhang se yah ghoshit karata he ki raashtra main uskaa ek vishisht sthaan he
 Therefore, in a broad sense, a monopolistic government is a system in which one or several members of the state openly and systematically exercise power over the entire nation - which they have gained from the violence resulting from the violation of all the legitimate rights and establishments of the past - in the government Those who do not participate, remain independent of the consent of the public
 sarkaar ke swaroop ke aadhaar par ekadhinaayakatv do virgo main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : In individual monopolies, the monarch governs independently on the basis of the principle of 'furor' with the help of his personal employees
 furar kii visheshta yah he ki vah apane sahaayakon ke prati uttaradaayi nahin hota, varan apane se upar-raashtra, itihaas yaa ishwar-ke prati apana daayitv ghoshit karata he
 The furor appoints his assistants who employ the employees under him, and these workers then appoint their subordinates
 is prakaar puri vyavastha main nirvachanpaddati kaa koi sthaan nahin hota or sampurna dhaanchaa sarvopari charam bindu par avlambit hota he
 The collective monopolist consists of the leader responsible for the Furer's place; One category of leaders chooses higher-class leaders, each leader being responsible to their electors
 is prakaar sampurna dhaanchaa nimnatam aadhaar par avlambit hota he
 There can be two classes of monopolies depending on social powers
 atev yah vibhaajan shaasha tathaa sahaayak varg ke aadhaar par hota he
 There are three major modern types of class monopolies: military, party and administrative
 teesraa vargeekaran parimanatmak swaroop ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he; yatha, The three classifications of totalitarianism can also be related to each other
 yatha, sainya ekadhinaayakatv, nijee tathaa samuhik donon hi ho saktaa he
 All important monopolies have the characteristic of religious communalism, such as worship of the promoter with zeal and reverence for a specific method
 mahaan vyaktiyon se sanchalit, sadaiv aakarshak vichaardhaara se prerit, apane anuyaayiyon se kartavya ke rup main balidaan kii maang karata hua, ekadhinaayakatv sakriy vyakti dwaara sthapit sarkaar kaa ek swaroop he
 He carries with them the mighty and dynamic classes which are naturally prone to rebellion: for example, the army, the Shur class or the proletariat
 ekadhinaayak apane sankalp or bhav shasiton par aropit karata rahata he
 There are two means of this implantation: negative, positive
 nakaaratmak saadhan hai, aalochana ko rokna, virdohi bahumat yaa alpamat ko nasht karnaa, rajya sambandhi aavashyak or mahatvapurn tathyon ko gupt rakhana
 Aids to these means are: the abolition of Parliament, the dissolution of unions and parties, restrictions on the press, control over education, expulsion of major opponents, etc
 is sambandh main hinsa tathaa aatank kii bhi charchaa kii jaati hai, parantu vastut: ye ekadhinaayakatv kii keval praarambhik avasthaa ke lakshan hai jo saamanyat: krantikari or isliye avaidh hote hai
 If monolithicism is successful in passing through this stage, it usually establishes administrative legislation in place of violence and terror
 sainya ekadhinaayakatv saamanyat: inhen nakaaratmak sadhano se santusht rahata he; parantu varg ekadhinaayakatv inke atirikt sakaaratmak sadhano kaa bhi prayog karata he; yatha, prachaar dwaara adhinaayak ke bhaavon, vichaaron or maton kaa janata par aropan, icchaanukool janamat kaa srijan aadi
 Helpful tools for these tools are: the worship of national or class worshipers, the propagation of provocative music, the eloquent or the hate speech, giving military education to the whole nation for habit of obedience, preparing books for schools, propagating anti-ideology
 , To bribe politicians, journalists and scholars by bribing them
 parantu kisi bhi sabhy desh main, jiskaa nikat ateet audaaryavaadee yaa janatantric rahaa ho, ye saadhan ekadhinayakawad kii sthapana ke liye tab tak paryaapt nahin hai jab tak unke saath janata se lubhaavne aadarsho, yatha aagyaakaarita, anushaasan, satta, ekta, shakti, deshprem aadi ke liye satat apil na kii jaae or vyakti main apane nijee adhikaron ko ekadhinaayak ke haathon sompane kaa utsaahpurn bhav na ubhaara jaae
 For this, the expressions related to religion are distorted and converted into expressions of praise or worship of their state, nation, caste or class
 jis avaidh dhang se ekadhinaayakatv kii sthapana hoti he usee dhang ke atirikt uskaa unmoolan praaia: asambhav he
 Monolithicism prevents the nation from learning the methods of autonomous governance and hence the rivalry for power among individuals and classes after the death of a monopolist can lead to disaster for the nation
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha ke vyavhaar main itane laabh hai ki anek loktantric rajyon main janata loktantr main kuch logon kii manamaani karne kii swatantraaa se uubakar adhinayakatantr vyavastha kii kaamana karne lagati he
 If the reasons for the rise of the dictatorship are discovered, then it will be known that the country where there was despair, disarray, dissatisfaction and absence, the emergence of the dictatorship
 jin deshon main loktantr vyavastha logon main niraashaa tathaa abhaav utpann karne vaali bani, vahiin is vyavastha kii sthapana ho gai
 Even today, in many states, the public sees the dictatorship as good and fully supports the autocratic rulers
 isse yah spasht he ki adhinayakatantr main kuch aise gun hai jo anya vyavasthaaon kii saiddhanthik shreshthata ke baavjood is vyavastha ko apnaane ke liye prerana ke jimmedaar hai
 In short, the following benefits of such governance are- adhinayakatantr main shashan kushalta hoti he
 Due to all the power vested in one person, not only can decisions be taken quickly, but the implementation of decisions is also arranged
 adhinayakatantri vyavastha main shaasha se sabhi bhaybheet rahete hai is kaaran ve kaary main deree yaa shithilataa nahin kar sakate hai
 The entire administration is not only responsible towards the autocratic ruler, but is also alert, alert and active at all times
 isse shashan main kaary-dakshata aa jaati hai
 The second quality of this system is the rapid development of the country
 desh main ek hi netaa, ek hi yojana tathaa ek hi vikaas lakshya rahane se desh kii sampoorn shakti isi lakshya ke maarg ko prashast karne main prayukt hoti he
 Proper development and use of economic resources is possible
 desh ke vikaas ke liye ekta, shaanti va vyavastha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Due to their solid system in the dictatorship, all the resources of the country can be put into development
 desh main ekta kii sthapana main adhinayakatantr bahut sahaayak rahata he
 By suppressing various parties and opponents, due to the establishment of one party and one leader in the country, the whole public becomes loyal to it
 netaa ke chaaron taraf, sari vyavasthaaen gunth jaati hai tathaa desh ek thos ekta ke sutara main bandha jaataa he
 The party or leader becomes a means of tying in unity and in that everyone starts to feel a sense of belongingness
 hitler va musolini isi tarah germany va italy ko ek karne main safal rahe the
 It is helpful in awakening the feeling of nationalism
 desh ke nagarikon ko parsparikta main baandhne ke liye ek vichaardhaara, ek dal va ek netaa kaa hona paryaapt hota hai
 All citizens are motivated by a sense of brotherhood
 ek raashtra kaa naaraa, ek hi jhande ke neeche sabko khadaa kar detaa he
 Desh bhakti has so much importance that citizens are ready to sacrifice even for their country and leader
 sankat kaal main taanaashaahee vyavastha sarvottam rahati he
 In this, due to all decisions and ideals given by one person to face the crisis, there is unity of orders
 isse samay par uchit kaarywahi karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 This system gives victory in wartime crisis
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha main desh kaa bahumukhi vikaas hota he
 There is also a system of rapid development in the economic sector
 ekta, anushaasan va kartavya-parayanata ke kaaran vikaas kii shreshth vyavastha ho jaati he
 The history of Russia, Germany, China, Italy, Turkey and Spain so far is a testimony to this fact
 jekson ne apni pustak ‘europe cins di war’ main thik hi likhaa he- ”spainvaasiyon ke itihaas main yah pehla avasar he jabaki railen samay par chali hai
 Trade and industry have prospered under the dictatorship
 krishi faliphuli he
 Labor crises have gone away
 “ Some scholars consider the Adhinayakatantra to be human-friendly
 iske paksh main unka kahana he ki manushya main swabhaavatah apane hiton kii raksha kii ichha avashya hoti he
 He wants his protection whether it is done by anyone
 apni samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chahta he
 Does it not matter to the general public that his defense system is powerful? She wants security, wants her interests fulfilled
 adhinayakatantr main aisa sambhav hone ke kaaran yah maanav swabhaav ke anukool vyavastha bhi maani jaati he
 The dictatorship has also been considered useful for developing states in transitional conditions of political and economic development
 vikasshil rajyon main janaichha kii anushaasit abhivyakti kii samasya atyant prabal rahi he
 In an effort to cross various stages of development, budding nations awaken to the people's aspirations, but the faster the public aspirations, the faster they are not able to fulfill them
 iske kaaran rajya vyavastha par tanaav badhate hai evam uske tuutane kaa dar rahata he
 In such a situation the dictatorship may be more useful for maintaining political discipline
 hanitagton ne thik hi kaha he ki ‘navdith raashton main pratham kaary raajnneetik sahbhaag, shiksha aadi kii vruddhi ke sthaan par moolbhoot, sansthaatmak dhaanche kaa nirmaan hona chahie tathaa iske liye ekadaleey shashan yaa sainik adhinayakatantr bhi upyukt ho saktaa he
 ' adhinayakatantr main gunon ke hote hue bhi is pranali kaa kisi bhi desh main lambi avadhi tak prachlan nahin rah paata he
 History is replete with such evidence that wherever the dictatorship is established, there is a situation when the public does not hesitate to resort to a violent revolution to overthrow the supreme ruler in power
 isse spasht he ki is vyavastha main kuch kamiyaan avashya pai jaati hai
 In short, the defects of this system are as follows- is vyavastha main vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa sammaan nahin hone ke kaaran vyakti ko sab kuch suvidhaayen hote hue bhi use apane vyaktitv ko apni icchaanusaar viksit karne kaa vaataavaran nahin mil paata he tathaa vah apane jivan ko apurna hi rakhane par majaboor ho jaataa he
 The person does not have freedom in any way
 isse uskaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Fundamental rights and personal liberty are not given any importance in the dictatorship system
 atah taanaashaahee vyavastha kaa sabase bada durgun vyakti ke vyaktitv ke daman kaa vaataavaran bananaa he
 Atrocity and incest is dominated by the dictatorship regime
 adhinaayak apni satta ko bana rakhane ke li aatank failaa rakhata he
 Opponents are eliminated by barbaric methods
 isse maanav bhaygrast hokar jail ke sikhchon main band sa ho jaataa he
 If anything said in the interest of the country is contrary to the dictator's will, he is turned down and the person who speaks against him is called a traitor
 taanaashaahee vyavastha desh ke liye ahitkar hoti he
 In this arrangement the decision is taken by a person who does not accept any kind of protest or suggestion
 isse taanashaah dwaara liye gayi galat nirnyon kaa ahitkar prabhaav sari praja ko bhugatna padataa he
 Every directive of the Adhinayak has to be accepted by the people, whether it is in the national interest or not
 is prr car taanaashaahee vyavastha main rashtiy hiton kaa samuchit sangrakshan nahin rahata he
 In the Adhinayaktantra, the sense of self-reliance, action and freedom is completely lost in ordinary people, because they have no freedom to speak or think, etc
 is vyavastha main vyakti kaa tan, dhan or yahaan tak ki man bhi adhinaayak ke liye ho jaataa he or use adhinaayak jidhar hankey udhar hi chalane ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 It is clear from the discussion of the merits and demerits of the Adhinayaktantra that this system does not make man a human being and does not even allow him to live as a human being
 isamen maanav kaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Even after fulfilling all his material needs, he feels something lacking
 uskaa jivan kaidi kaa sa ho jaataa he
 That is why despite many benefits of Adhinayaktantra, a person does not like to live under this system
 is shashan main vyakti ke liye sab kuch rahata he parantu phir bhi usko aisi vyavastha main ghutan hone lagati he, kyonki vyakti keval roti ke liye hi jivit nahi rahata he
 Apart from this, he wants to achieve and do a lot of things which are possible only in the atmosphere of freedom of thought and expression
 atah adhinayakatantr sabhi aakarshanon ke baavjood bhi tanaav mastishk kii bhukh mitaane ke sadhano par roak lagane vaala hone ke kaaran jan saadhaaran dwaara amaanya hi rahata he
 After thinking about the merits and demerits of this regime, it becomes easy to indicate about its future

 Its experts affirm that the highest standards of occupational safety and health can be attained
 iskaa sambandh udyog ke sthalon main antarvyaapt paristhitiyon ke adhyayan tathaa niyantran se he
 Health practitioners have long believed that the conditions of health and well-being of the workers have an effect, as is evident from this comment by Bardardine Rumzne) shramik saamanyat: apane samay kaa ek tihaai apane kaam ke sthal main vyateet karata he or isliye apane kaam kii bhautik, rasinic tathaa manovaigyanik paristhitiyon se vah vishesh rup se prabhavit hota he
 Generally physical conditions are: heat, coolness, humidity, light etc
 rasinic tatv hai : vividh ganse, dhuaan, dhul aadi
 Psychological elements are: health facilities, lighting, drinking and handwashing water, recreation, refreshments, patron equipment, seating and rest facilities, living conditions, managers' behavior, and access to higher officials
 in tatwon kaa prabhaav jatil hota he or inamen se kisi ek athwa sammilit kriya dwaara shramik ke swasthya, kalyaan tathaa yogyata par prabhaav pad saktaa he
 It has been observed that when heat or cold produces discomfort, then production is affected badly, small accidents increase, workers die and dissatisfaction spreads
 britain main kaarkaane ke taap se sambhddha durghatnaon kaa jo adhyayan kiya usase vidit hua ki 67 degree celsius taap par durghatnaayen sabase kam thim, isse kam or adhik tapon par durghatnaayen adhik huin
 Similarly, in the United States, an important study took place in electric-powered factories
 isamen utpaadan ke sambandh main prakaash kii tivrata tathaa chakachaundh ke prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya tha
 It showed that such elements have a very significant effect on the happiness and production of artisans
 britain kii iluminating ejineering socity ke anusaar maheen kaam ke liye 50 foot-candal kaa prakaash chahie, saadhaaran kaamon ke liye 15 se 25 foot-candal tak kaa or mote kaamon ke liye 6 se 10 foot-candal tak kaa
 Less light causes less work, impurities and more accidents occur
 shramikon kii aankhon main pidaa utpann hoti he or saradard hota he, man khijalane lagata he or udaasi utpann hoti he
 If the light comes from the north sky, it is best to work during the day

 It is not very difficult to identify industrial diseases as they grow, but it is somewhat difficult as well as interesting to investigate the initial symptoms and identify their causes
 audyogic rogon kaa vargeekaran karnaa kathin he, saadhaarant: unako nimnlikhit kotiyon main rakhaa ja saktaa he : Natural medium-term diseases - cold cramps, heatstroke or heat stroke, cataract, frostbite, pressure, caesan's disease, in which sudden decrease in air pressure causes great pain in the entire body and vasoconstriction - including air bubbles Due to this, the flow of blood stops
 rasinic kaarnonvale rog - ve rog jo potas, enilin, rasinic raj, asbestus, paara, sisa, sankhiya tathaa anya vishon se kaam karanevaale shramikon ko hote hai
 Poisoning of chemical gases such as ammonia, phosgene, nitrous smoke, benzene, etc
 manovaigyanik kaarnonvale rog - aankh kii putliyon kii canpakanpi 
 Some of the industrial diseases mentioned above are very important
 adhikansh deshon kii sarkaron ne niyam bana diya he ki rog hote hi unhen soochna mili
 In India, 17 diseases have been advertised by the Factory Act, it is mandatory for the doctor to give information to the government if any patient comes to see the doctors who are suffering from any of these diseases
 ye rog hai : sisa, tetrethil, fosfaras, paara, sankhiya, nitras dhuaan, carbon bisolphid, benzin, chromium ke lavan, dhuli, iodine, bromine, radiodharmee padaarth tathaa eksre se utpann rog or anthraks, charm kaa karkat, vishakt raktaheenata tathaa vishakt pilia naamak rog
 Almost all of the industrial diseases can be prevented, so the study and occupation of occupational medicine is highly self-evident
 prayek prayek desh main vyavsaayik ayurvigyaan seva kaa kshetra ek sa nahin he, kintu saamanyat: iske antargat nimnlikhit audyogic kaary samavisht hai : rogon kii rokthaam, kaarkaanon main kaam kii dashaon main sudhaar, audyogic durghatnaon kaa upachaar tathaa ghayal athwa aapng audyogic kaarigaron ko phir koi kaam karne yogya bananaa
 For proper industrial therapy service, there should be a doctor, a physiotherapist, a qualified engineer, a chemist, a physiologist, a physiotherapist and an industrial nurse
 is puure dal ko paraspar sahyog se kaam karnaa chahie kyonki audyogic rogon ke aarambhik lakshanon kaa pataa tathaa unka nidaan is dal ke prayek sadsy ke nirikshan par hi nirbhar rahegaa
 For example, to diagnose lead poisoning, it is necessary that the doctor conducts a simple examination of the artisan, the physiotherapist gives a drawing of the patient's blood, the biochemist detects the accumulation of the disease in the excreta, the chemist investigates the amount of lead in the air, Engineers should find out which machines of the factory produce this poison
 yadi koi karigar audyogic rog athwa chot se apahiz ho gaya ho to visheshgy use phir se kaam karne yogya banane main sahaayta de saktaa he
 The industrial nurse not only helps the physician, but she also works to advise the artisan about health and welfare
 audyogic chikitsak ko karigar kii praarambhik chikitsa or uske rog kaa nidaan to karnaa hi hota he, saath hi kaarigaron kii pariksha karke kaarkaanon main unke pravesh se purv yah bhi nirdhaarit karnaa hota he ki vah karigar apni shaareerik kshamta ke anukool kis vishesh kaam par lagaaya janaa chaahe, athwa use kaarkaane main kaam karne dena hi nahin chahie
 Similarly, he has to periodically conduct medical examination of the artisans who are put on the dreaded processes, so that the exposure of the dreaded material to the gradual ill effects on the artisans is timely
 audyogic chikitsak kaa yah bhi daayitv he ki vah choti-choti sevaayen, jaise daanton kii raksha aadi kaa bhi kaary karata rahe
 He also has to give advice in relation to the psychological problems of the workers, so if he wants to be the trust of both the labor bosses then he should be specially skilled in his work
 yah siddh ho chukaa he ki jin bade karkhaanon main acchhee audyogic rogopchaar seva kii vyavastha rahati he, vahaan keval uskaa vyay hi nahin nikal aata varan yathesht atirikt laabh bhi hota he, kyonki iske dwaara udyog main kam se kam vyay par badhiya saamaan utpann kiya ja saktaa he

 enpisiai bhartiya reserve bank dwaara gathit sanstha hai
 In 2009, the Reserve Bank had asked the Indian Banks Association to start a non-profit company and design a card domestically like Visa and mastercard
 The rupay card is meant to promote a payments and settlement platform for card transactions at a low processing fee, making it viable for smaller merchant establishments to accept card payments for even low-value transactions
 This is expected to provide a further fillip to card transactions in the country, thereby reducing the use of currency
 In the 2009–12 vision document, the Reserve Bank of India considered the possibilities of establishing an indigenous card for India
 tadnusaar, rupe card ke liye praayogic taur par laanch karne ke liye enpisiai ko adhikrut kiya gaya
 The card was subsequently launched in March 2012
 enpisiai ne 14 may 2011 ko maharashtra main shahari sahakaari kshetra ke gopinath patil parteek janata sahakaari bank ke saath pehla rupe card laanch kiya tha

 kuch samay pashchaat in vyapaariyon ne burma sarkaar ke nirdeshon evam niyamon kaa ulanghan karnaa prarambh kar diya

 baharhaal, maanav basti ke adhikansh avasheshon ko marusthal kii ret dwaara dafan kar diya gaya or bade paimaane par sadiyon se yah kshetra viraan rahaa
 In early 1923, a family of Al Dosari tribe and several families of Hovela settled here in Ad Dammam
 in pariwaron kaa netritv shaikh ahamed ebn abdullah ebn hasan al dosari karata tha jo bahrain se aayaa tha or in pariwaron ko echarem swargeey raja abdulajiz dwaara basane ke liye bhoomi chunane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Soon Ad Dammam was chosen to see that the island of Bahrain was close by and the clan was expected to return there soon, but as British rule was established in the region, it was very important for them to do so It became difficult and eventually he realized that it would be better for him to settle there permanently
 kai saal baad, shaikh ahamed kaa bhai dakshin chalaa gaya jahaan vah or uskaa parivaar al khobar main bas gaye jo ki us samay pehle se hi basaa hua tha
 This small episode, however, boosted the population in Khobar and led to closer ties with the big city of Dammam
 "dammam" kaa mul naam vivaadaaspad he, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah dhwani anukaranaatmak he or is ilaake ke nazadik hi ek drum rakhe hone ke kaaran is kshetra ko yah naam diya gaya, jab ise chetavanee ke liye bajaay jaataa tha to isse ek madhur dhwani nikalati thi jise "damdamah" kehete the, anya logon kaa maananaa he ki is naam ko arabi shabd "davama" ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he, jo paas ke ek samudri sthal ko ingit karata tha jisase dho logon ko aksar bachanaa hota tha
 When the modern state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932, the life of many settlements in the region depended on fishing and pearling
 sadi kii aadhe se adhik kii avadhi ke dauraan, is kshetra kaa vikaas udyog, vaanijya or vigyaan ke centre ke rup main hua or kareeb paanch lakh log yahaan rahane lage
 Changes started here with the discovery of commercial quantities of oil in the region
 purvi praant, duniya ke ek sarvaadhik bade tel maidan ke sheersh par sthit he or vah dahraan hi tha jahaan saudi arab kii rashtriya tel company, saudi aramko kii purvavarti aramko ne 1936 main prasiddh dammam number 7 kuan khoda jisane bina kisi shaq ke yah siddh kar diya ki is samrajya main hydrocarbon kaa ek vishaal aapurti bhandar he
 New oil fields in the south, west and north of Dammam were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, now known for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, and which encouraged building construction in response
 is desh or duniya bhar se visheshgy or takanisian nae tel ke kshetron kii khoj main madad karne ke liye or unhen dhara par laane ke liye ekatra hue
 nai pipelinon ko sthapit kiya janaa tha, bhandaaran suvidhaon kaa nirmaan karnaa tha or tankeron ko sanbhaalane ke liye jaiti kaa nirmaan kiya janaa tha
 The increasing number of specialists working in Dhahran required housing, construction of hospitals, schools for their children and other facilities
 bina adhik antaraal ke, dahraan, saudi aramko kaa korporate mukhyalay jo duniya main sabase badi tel company thi, registan main sabhi dishaao main failane lagi
 The development of the oil industry in the region had similar effects on the small fishing villages of Dammam and the village of Al Khobar
 Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mud houses of fishermen mostly built on the seabed and which were the only permanent dwellings in the area, soon turned into concrete buildings, modern dwellings, highways and orchard paths
 parasian gulf tat par dahraan ke purv main sthit al khobar sankshipt rup se saudi arab ke kachche tel ke liye bahrain main rifinary kaa ek shipping kendra ban gaya
 In the early years of World War II, oil production in Saudi Arabia was very limited and as the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent to Bahrain by small tankers
 bahrain tak ek pipe line ke nirmaan or yuddh ke baad ke varshon main tel udyog main vistaar ke baad shipping or tel udyog kaa dhyaan al khobar ke uttar kii ore dammam or raas tanura main sthanantarit hua, jo ki duniya bhar main ek sabase bada tel bhandaaran or shipping kendra he or dammam ke uttar 25 kimi duuri par sthit he
 As a result, Al Khobar gradually gained a new role as a commercial center for the entire region
 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh main purvi kshetra kii rajdhani dammam ek alag shahar tha, lekin al khobar or dahraan se vah itnaa kareeb tha ki ek yatri kuch hi minuton main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan main ja saktaa tha
 Dammam was more affected than any other city in Saudi Arabia by the discovery of oil in Dahran and its surrounding areas and the increasing importance of the entire region
 teen dashakon ke bheetar, machhlee pakadaney vaala yah chota sa gaanv eastern provins kii rajdhani ban gaya
 The simultaneous development of Dammam and Dahran and Al Khobar merged the three jurisdictions, the three cities were essentially merged into one and created a single municipality known as the Dammam Metropolitan Area, commonly known as the Dammam Area
 Is referred to as
 dammam kshetra kaa gathan karne vaale teenon shaharon ne apni khud kii visheshtaayen or kuch sthaneey prashasnic kaaryon ko banaae rakhaa he lekin kingdom main apni sthiti ke aadhaar par dammam kshetra ek ekal prashasnic ikai he
 The development of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in most parts of the world led to rapid development in the region
 jaise-jaise tel utpaadan main vruddhi hui, vaise-vaise is udyog ko chalaane ke liye adhik logon kii aavashyaktaa hui
 The growing population needed more housing and services
 uttam darje ke aspataalon or skulon ne logon ko is kshetra main aane ke liye prerit kiya
 The service industry flourished to assist the oil industry and to meet the needs of the people living in the Dammam area
 natijatan, ek aisa kshetra jahaan tees saal pehle kuch sau nivasee the aaj vahaan kii jansankhya badhkar das lakh ho gai he, yahaan jansankhya main vruddhi prativarsh paanch pratishat se bhi adhik raftaar se ho rahi he
 One of the main reasons for the immense success of the Dammam region is that unlike other oil cities in the world, it has developed in all areas
 vartmaan main yah ek aadhunik shahari or audyogic kendra he jo ki saudi arab ke tel udyog kaa mukhyalay hone vaala he
 Since the region was growing in the early years, the Saudi Arabian government took steps towards the development of the Dammam region
 New roads and highways added the state to other cities and industrial centers in the Kingdom
 ek railway line dwaara al kharj ke krishi kendra ke liye or riyaad ke liye dammam ko joda gaya
 The Daharan International Airport was established between Dhahran and Al Khobar to establish connectivity with the region and other parts of the world
 tel ke alaava anya udyogon ke vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye ek audyogic shahar ko teen shaharon ke bich khuli jagah main sthapit kiya gaya
 Where currently more than 124 factories are located, the industrial complex is completely surrounded by the urban population
 parinamswaroop, ek duusare audyogic shahar ko dammam kshetra se thodi duuri par riyaad rajmarg ke saath sthapit kiya gaya he
 Situated on nearly 6,000 acres of land, this second industrial city has 120 factories in addition to 160 under-construction factories
 in kaarkaanon main kai prakaar ke upabhokta utpaadon or audyogic utpaadon kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he jiskaa vipanan sampoorn kingdom main hota he or duniya bhar ke anya deshon main niryaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 Shipping agents and commercial companies responsible for handling such exports as well as imports from abroad are located in Dammam and Al Khobar, making the Dammam region a major oil producer and export area, plus a commercial and shipping hub

 The new King Fahd International Airport has been established 30 miles west of Dammam which not only serves Dammam but also served the industrial city of Jubail, 40 miles to the north
 chunki rajya ke anya bhaagon main bhi yah sthit he, swasthya mantralay ne dammam kshetra main kai aadhunik aspataalon or swasthya dekhbhaal kendron ke ek network ko sthapit kiya he
 These are supplemented by hospitals and clinics set up by the private sector
 jamini str se banaae jane ke kaaran dammam kshetra ko aadhunik shahari niyojan ke siddhanton ke anusaar dizin kiya gaya he
 The residential areas are separated from the commercial sections, the roads are broad and straight and the buildings are designed to conform to a master plan
 kshetra ke vikaas kii mukhya visheshtaon main se ek visheshta bhoomi sudhaar he
 Wide stretches of shallow waters of the bay have been filled and where once marshes used to be there are hotels and office buildings today

 The availability of water strengthens the urban and industrial development of the Dammam region and provisions for expansion of existing desalination facilities have been made to cater for future development
 dammam-dahraan-khobar kshetra nauvahan, tel, vaanijya or udyog ke liye ek pramukh centre hai
 Tankers carry oil from the terminal at Ras Tanura
 dammam kshetra manoranjan suvidhaon kii vyapak vividhta ke liye bhi prasiddh he, jo nivaasiyon or aagantukon ko samaan rup se uplabdh he
 In many ways, the Dammam region has been developed as a link between Saudi Arabia and the outside world, the Kingdom exports products and imports products of need, and builds relations between Saudi Arabia and other countries
