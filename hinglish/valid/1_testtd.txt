 neeche inaki kuch pramukh jatiyon kii suchi di gayi he- 1 After seasoning at 12% moisture content purna pratiyogita bazaar ke us rup kaa naam he jisamen vikritaon kii sankhya kii koi seemaa nahin hoti
 Hence, no single producer can influence the price of a commodity in the market
 arthshaastra main bazaar ko mukhtyah do roopon main baanta jaataa he : purna pratiyogita or apurna pratiyogita
 The two extreme points of the market structure are absolute competition and monopoly
 purna pratiyogita ke hone ke liye kuch purvanumaan liye jate hai jo is prakaar hai : 1
 Each producer provides such a small share of the entire supply of the market that it alone cannot have any effect on the price of the commodity in the market
 2
 prayek utpaadak ke dwaara banaai gayi vastu samaan hoti he
 3
 Each producer has access to the production technology available in the market
 4
 kisi bhi naye utpaadak ke bazaar main aane par athwa bazaar main upasthit kisi utpaadak ke bazaar se nikalne par koi roak tok nahin he
 5
 Every buyer and seller present in the market has complete knowledge of the market
 yadhyapi purna pratiyogita vyaavhaarik jivan main sambhav nahin he, par share bazaar isaki visheshtaon kii drushti se bahut paas pahunch jaataa he
 Competition in agriculture is also similar to full competition
 purna pratiyogita main koi bhi vikreta wastu kaa mulya swany nirdhaarit nahin kar saktaa
 Hence the price of the commodity is determined in the market
 mulya nirdhaaran kii prakriya ko samajhane ke liye maang or aapurti ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 Demand: The quantity of a commodity that people want to buy and use at a certain price is called the demand for goods
 aapurti: kisi vastu ke utpaadak uski jitani maatra ek nirdhaarit mulya par bazaar main bechnaa chaahate hai use wastu kii bazaar main aapurti kehete hai
 When a commodity arrives in the market, the relationship between its demand and its supply is established and the price is determined
 vikreta dwaara upyukt vikray pariman kaa nirdhaaran In absolute competition, the seller's demand-curve is resilient because he can produce and sell as much as the market wants at a fixed price
 atah use upyukt pariman nirdhaarit karne ke liye apane seemaant laagat vakr kaa nirdharan karnaa hota he
 Marginal cost means the cost of producing another item in the present case
 seemaant laagat vakr angreji ke akshar 'U' ke aakaar kaa hota he
 This means that the marginal cost is decreasing when the production capacity is not fully utilized, it starts increasing after reaching a certain capacity
 jis bindu par seemaant laagat vakr utpaadak ke maang vakr ko katata he, us bindu par upyukt utpaadan kaa nirdhaaran hota he
 When the producer produces a commodity, its main purpose is profit
 jab seemaant laagat arthath ek ikai ke utpaadan kaa laagat bazaar main sthapit vastu ke mulya se upar chalaa jaataa he to iskaa arth he ki vikreta ko uske utpaadan se ghaataa hoga
 Therefore, at the point at which the marginal cost curve crosses the seller's demand curve and goes over it, producing beyond that point, the seller must sell his product at a price below cost
 atah utpaadak is bindu par pahunchane ke uparant utpaadan roak detaa he

 But Aragorn continues his search for Mary and Pippin, and Fangorn walks into the forest
 vahaan unako ek jaadugar miltaa he, jise pehle to wo log saruman samajhate hai, par baad main unhen gyaan hota he ki wo gandailf he, jo ki moriya kii khadaan se ballrog ko haraakar or phir punerjeevit hokar vaapis aayaa he
 From there, the four depart towards the capital of the Sultanate of Rohan
 rohan ke aadhe-pagal ho chuke raja theoden ko gandailf thik karata he or uske dusht salaahkaar greema kentuazbaan ko desh nikaala de diya jaataa he 
 Gandalf explains to Theodon that Saruman has an evil eye on his kingdom
 udhar saruman ne rohan par apni uruk-haai sena dwaara chadhaai kar di
 a fierce war ensues between the Uruk-hai and the Rohanites in the valley of Helm
 us samay gandailf aomer kii aadamiyon ko ikattha karne pahadiyon par chalaa jaataa he
 By dawn, the gandaif returns with all the men who have defeated the demons
 bhaagate hue daitya ek naye van main sharan lete hai, jo asal main anton dwaara laaye gayi huorn the
 All the monsters there are killed by the Hoorn
 iske baad badla lene theoden or anya log ek sena lekar orthank jate hai
 The Antons had taken possession of the Orthank, except the tower, and had submerged the river crossing and submerged it
 saruman kii dushtataa barkaraar rahane kii vajah se gandailf ne uski jaadui chadi tod di or use jaadugar shrenee se nikaal diya
 Saruman accidentally killed a Palantir on behalf of those whom Pippin caught
 jigyaasu hobit pippin ne jaadui palantir kaa upyog karte hue usamen chupake se nazar gadai
 There he got a glimpse of Sauron and his next move
 iske baad gandailf or pippin gondor kii sultanate kii ore ravaanaa ho gayi
 Frodo and Sam cannot find Mordor's path due to fog
 raah main unako gollum miltaa he, jo saare raste unka pich kar rahaa tha
 Crazy Gollum behind the ring tries to snatch the ring from them, but Frodo and Sam catch him
 sam use maar daalana chahta he, par frodo us par taras khaakar use apana maardarshak bana detaa he, is shart par ki gollum unako mordor ke dwaar tak le jaayegaa or anguthi chhinane kii koshish nahin karegaa

 He takes them to the main gate of Mordor, but it was impossible to cross his guard

 The shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle, scapula and humerus, as well as the mespasia, condyle edema and bandha

 The shoulder joint is a group of structures in the area
 jod main do prakaar ke upasthi hote hai
 The first type of cartilage is white cartilage which is at the boundaries of bones
 This allows the bones to slip and slide over each other
 jab is prakaar kii upasthi ghisne lagati he, jod dardanaak or kathor ho jaataa he
 There is a second type of cartilage in the shoulder, the labrum, which is clearly different from the joint cartilage
 yah upasthi gola oe gartika jod ke siron par upasthit upasthi se adhik reshedaar or kathor hoti he
 In addition, this cartilage is also found on the socket where it connects
 kandhaa haath or bhujaao main gati ke liye lacheela hona chahie or uthaane, khichne or dhakka dene jaisi kriyaao ke liye majboot bhi hona chahie
 in do kaaryo ke bich samajhote se kai prakaar kii kandhe se judy samasyaayen ho sakati he jo kii anya jod jaise, nitamb main nahin hoti
 There are three types of joints in the shoulder - glenohumeral, asymptomatic and zygomatic and sternoclavicular
 glenoheumoral jod kandhe kaa pramukh jod hota he jise aamtaur par kandhe kaa jod kehete sandhrbit karte he
 It is a ball and socket joint that is useful in making the arm spin round and in and out

 Banabhatta was a seventh-century Sanskrit prose writer and poet
 vah raja harshavardhan ke aasthaan kavi the
 His two major texts are: Harshacharitam and Kadambari
 harshcharitam, raja harshavardhan kaa jivan-charitra tha or kadambari duniya kaa pehla upanyaas tha
 Even before the completion of Kadambari, when Banabhatta ji died, his son Bhushanbhatt took up the task of completing the novel
 donon granth sanskrit sahitya ke mahatvapurn granth maane jate he
 Place of Birth - Chandreh M
 Q
 mahakavi banbhatta ne gadhyrachana ke kshetra main vahi sthaan praapt kiya he jo ki kalidas ne sanskrit kavy kshetra main
 The Western writers have in one voice recorded the commendations on the arrow
 aaryasptati ke lekhak govardhanacharya kaa kathan he- The praise of Dhanapala, the author of Tilakamanjari is as follows - trilochan ne nimnlikhit padya main baan kii prashansa kii he- According to Kaviraj, author of Raghavapandaviya- pashchaadvarti lekhakon kii anant prashastiyon main ye kuch hi hai
 Baan is one of the few Sanskrit writers whose life and times are definitely known
 kadambari kii bhoomika main tathaa harshcharitam ke pratham do uchhvaason main baan ne apane vansh ke sambandh main vistaarpurvak soochna di he
 In the village named Pritikoot on the banks of the Son River, the arrow was born in the Vatsyayagotri Vidyabrahman clan
 baan apane vansh kaa udbhav saraswati tathaa dadhichi ke putr saraswat ke bhai vatsa se batalaate hai
 The descendant of Vatsa was Kubera whose fourth son Pashupat was the great-grandfather of Baan
 baan ke pitamah kaa naam arthpati tha jinako gyaarah putr hue
 Baan's father's name was Chitrabhanu
 baan ke shaishavkaal main hi unki mata rajyadevi kii mrityu ho gai
 He was raised by his father
 baan abhi chaudaa varsh ke hi the ki unke pita unke liye kapaphi sampatti chhodkar chal based
 Due to the onset of youth and wealth, the arrow left the house to see the world itself
 unhone vibhinn prakaar ke logon se sambandh sthapit kiya
 Among his comrades and friends, Baan called Ishaan, a poet of Prakrit, two sons, a son of a physician, a reader, a goldsmith, a ratnakar, a writer, a bookkeeper, a chord, two singers, a prathari, two announcers, one anthem
 The teacher is a teacher, a dancer, a teacher, a nut, a dancer, a tantric, a master of metaphysics and an andrajaalik etc
 kai deshon kaa bhraman karke vah apane sthaan preetikut lautaa
 While living there, he received a message from Harshavardhan's cousin Krishna that some chewed men had blasphemed the king, so he immediately went to meet the king and after a two-day visit met the king on the banks of Ajiravati
 pratham saakshaatkaramen baan ko bahut niraashaa hui kyonki samraat ke saathi malwadhish ne kaha ‘ayamsaubhujangah’ he) astu, baan ne apni sthiti kaa spashtikaran kiya or samrat usase prasann hue samraat ke saath kuch maas rahakar baan vaapis lautaa or unhone prastut harshcharit ke rup main harsh kii jeevani likhni prarambh kii
 The autobiography of the arrow ends here and we do not know anything about the last time of the arrow
 parantu aisa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki baan ko rajsangrakshan mila or unhone bhi harsh charit likhakar uskaa mulya chukaa diya
 Baan had a son named Bhushanbhatta or Bhattapulind, who completed Kadambari after Baan's death
 at: kadambari ko do lekhakon ne purna kiya
 There is no difficulty in deciding the timing of the arrow
 harshcharit ke prarambh main ve harsh ko rajya karata hua raja batalaate hai- The description of Harsha's dynasty, for example the names of Prabhakarvardhan and Rajyavardhana, proves that the Banas were the kings of Harshavardhana, the emperor of Kannauj
 baan kaa yah kaal bahya saakshyon se bhi samya rakhata he
 The arrow was mentioned by Anandavardhana, a scholar of the Alankara scripture in the 9th century
 sambhavtah baan anandavardhan se bahut pehle ho chuke the
 Vamana also mentions the arrow
 goudvaho ke lekhak vaakpati raaj bhi baan kii prashansa karte hai
 Apart from Kadambari and Harsharitam, many other compositions are also considered as arrows
 unamem se markendeya puraana ke devi mahatmaya par aadhaarit durga kaa stotra chandistak he
 Often a play 'parvati Parinay' is also considered to have been composed by Baan
 parantu vastutah iskaa lekhak koi pashchaadvarti vaaman bhattabaan he
 According to a scholarly critic, the adjective has the characteristic of the adjective in very syntactic, syllabic meanings and in the use of unused meanings of words
 unke gadhy main laalitya he or lambe samaason main bal pradaan karne kii shakti he
 They use plurality, metaphor, metaphor, provocation, syllogism, parody and especially a multiplicity of contradictions
 jaisaa ki achchhodasarovar ke ullekh se spasht he unka prakruti varnan tathaa anya prakaar ke varnan karne par adhikaar he
 In Kadambari, the teachings of Shuknas and Harshacharitam's Prabhakarvardhan's in-depth study of human nature is evident
 baan kii shabdaawalee vistrut he or praayah vah ek shabd ke sabhi paryaayon kaa prayog karte hai
 He has used 19 words for 'sound'
 isi prakaar visheshnon ke prayog main baan nishnaat hai or aisa prathit hota he ki visheshnon kaa ant nahin hoga
 His descriptions like Ujjayini and Diwakar Mitra's ashram are flawless, diverse and impressive even when detailed
 banbhatta kaa maanav prakruti kaa gyaan ascharyajanak he
 None of his elements remained unanswered
 yah thik hi kahagaya he- Baan did not leave out any utterances, due to which no later writer could encroach Baan
 kavi kii sarvatomukhi pratibha, vyapak gyaan, adbhut varnan style or prayek varnya-vishay ke sookshmatisookshm varnan ke aadhaar par yah subhashit prachlit he ki baan ne kisi varnan ko achoota nahin choda he or unhone jo kuch kah diya, usase aage kehane ko bahut kuch shesh nahin rah jaataa
 Baan has analyzed the inner nature and emotions as deeply as the external nature has been described with beauty, warmth and subtlety
 unke varnan itane vyapak or sateek hote hai, ki pathak ko yah anubhav hota he ki un paristhitiyon main vah bhi aisa hi sochataa yaa karata
 In the morning Kaal, Sandhyavarnan, Shudrakavarna, Shukavarnan, Chandalakanya narration etc
, the arrow has not only described, but has made a living picture of every object
 chandrapid ko diye gayi shukanasopadesh main to kavi kii pratibha kaa charmotkarsh parilakshith hota he
 The writing of the poet seems to be flowing in the spirit
 shukanasopadesh main aisa prathit hota he maano saraswati saakshaat murtimati hokar bol rahi hai
 In the description of the arrow, the harmony of language and language, the use of a sense of language, the concomitant use of ornaments, the short verse after the accusation and descent in the language, and the long concatenated phrase, etc
 prayek varnan main pehle vishay kaa sangopang varnan miltaa he, bahut samastapad milte hai, tatpashchaat shleshamulak upamaayen or utprekshaayen, tadnantar virodhabhas yaa parisankhya se samaapti

 Pidgin is not the native language of a conversational community, but a language learned as a second language
 pigin kaa nirmaan vividh anya bhashaa or samskritiyon ke shabdon, dhvaniyon yaa sanket bhashaaon se ho saktaa he
 Pidgin generally has a lower reputation than other languages
 bhashaa ke sabhi sarlikrut yaa "khandit" rup pigin nahin hai
 Each pidgin has different usage criteria that must be learned to achieve proficiency in the pidgin
 shabd pidgin ke mul ke bare main anischitata he
 The word pidgin was first printed in 1850 and many sources exist about the etymology of the word
 udahaaran ke liye: The word pidgin, which has also been previously spelled with the pigion spelling, originally used to describe Chinese pidgin English, later became popular for referring to any pidgin
 pigin kaa upyog sthaneey pigin yaa creole ke liye vishisht naam ke rup main nirdisht kii ja sakati he, jahaan vah boli jaati he
 For example, the name Tok Pisin is derived from the English word talk pidgin
 isko bolne vaale aam taur par angrezi bolte samay iskaa ullekh bas "pidgin" ke rup main karte hai
 The term jargon is also used to describe pidgin and has also been found in some pidgin names, such as Chinook Jargon
 In this context, linguists nowadays use jargon to denote a particularly underdeveloped type of pidgin; However, this usage is often rare and the term jargon often refers to specific terms of a profession
 pigin Tok Pisin jaise vyapaar kii bhashaa ke rup shuru ho sakate hai yaa ban sakate hai
 Business languages can often be advanced languages such as Swahili, Persian or English
 vyapaar kii bhashaaen "yaneey bhashaaon" kii ore abhimukh hoti hai, jabaki pigin deshi bhashaa ke rup main viksit hoti hai
 Since the Pidgin language is fundamentally the simplest form of communication, its grammar and phonetics are generally simple as far as possible and usually include: pigin ke nirmaan main aam taur par nimna kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: In addition, Keith Vuhinom suggests that three languages are needed to build a pidgin, with one clearly being more effective than the other
 aksar yah mana jaataa he ki jab pigin bolne vaale mata-pita kii ek peedi apane bacchon ko use pratham bhashaa ke rup main sikhaati he, to pigin creole bhashaa ban jaati he
 Creole then replaces a mixture of current languages to become the native language of the community
 However, not all pidgin Creole languages are made up; Pidgin can be finished before this stage
 saaliquoco magavene jaise anya vidwaan tark dete hai ki pigin or creole bhinn paristhitiyon main swatantra rup se ubhartee hai or zaruri nahin ki creole se pehle hameshaa hi pigin ho or naa hi pigin se creole viksit hoti hai
 According to Mfvane, Pidgin emerged among the trade colonies "users preserving their native dialect for day-to-day interactions"
 Meanwhile, Creole developed into colonized colonies where European-speaking, often contracted workers with lower-than-standard linguistic level, interacted extensively with non-european slaves, with some words from slaves in non-european native languages And features assimilated, resulting in a heavily graded version of the original language
 ye sevak or ghulaam, na keval ucchstareey bhashaa bolne vaale ke saath sampark kii zarurat padane par hi nahin, balki apni dainandin sthaneey boli ke rup main creole kaa upyog karne lagate hai

 The Indian numeral system is known as hindu-arabic numeral system in the countries of the west because European countries had knowledge of this numeral system from the Arab country
 jabaki arabon ko yah gyaan bharat se mila tha
 The Indian numeral system consists of 10 digits totaling zero
 bhartiya ank pranali, sansar kii sarvaadhik prachlit ank pranali hai
 According to the famous French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace, neeche bhartiya ankon kaa devanagari evam antararashtriya swaroop dikhaaya gaya he- According to historians, Brahmi numerals were prevalent in India in the fourth century BC
 pune evam mumbai ke kshetra kii gufaaon main mili shilalekhon main tathaa uttar pradesh main mili prachinkaal ke sikkon main brahmi ank paye gayi hai
 The decimal system and zero were not used in Brahmi numerals
 apramanik dastavezon ke anusaar bharat main shunya, jo ki dashamalav pranali kaa aadhaar he, kaa avishkaar isvi san kii pratham shatabdi main ho chukaa tha
 However, authentic documents of the invention of zero have been found in India only in the fifth century
 gwalior main paye gayi shilaalekh, jo ki isvi san 870 kaa he, main shunya ke sanket paae gaye hai
 This inscription has been recognized by all historians by one opinion
 shunya ke avishkaar ho jane par bharat main das anko vaali ank pranali kaa prachlan armbh ho gaya jo ki is sansar main prachlit aadhunik ank pranaaliyon kaa aadhaar bani
 In the seventh century CE, Arabia acquired the Indian numeral system
 arab main bhartiya ankon ko gubaar ank or bhartiya ank pranali ko hindusa ank pranali ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Due to the number system obtained from Hindustan, it was named 'hindusa' there
 arab ke mohammad ebn musa al-khwaarizmi naamak vidwaan ke kalkram vivaran ke anusaar, Roman numerals were used in Europe until the twelfth century
 roman ank pranali main keval saat ank hai, jo aksharon dwaara vyakt kiye jate hai

 For example, if you want to write three then write the symbol of one three times III
 aath likhnaa he to paanch ke daayin taraf teen ek-ek ke chinh likhakar jod die or VIII ho gaya
 This system is so difficult and complicated that when Europe was introduced to the Indian numeral system in the twelfth century, it not only accepted it, but adopted it completely
 europe main kuch shatabdiyon baad jo vaigyanik-audyogic kranti hui, uske mul main bhartiya ank gananaa kaa hi yogadan he
 India invented nine digits and zero for calculation
 yahi nahin, ankon ke sthaneey maan kaa bhi avishkaar bharat main hi hua
 There is no value of zero, but if it is written to the right of a digit, it will indicate ten because now the local value of 1 becomes ten
 yadi dahini ore ek or shunya badha diya jaae, to yah sankhya sau ho jaaegi
 In this way, the valueless zero when written to the right of the digit increases the value of the second digit
 sankshep main, sthaan ke anusaar ankon ke mulya nirdhaaran ke siddhanth ko sthaneey maan kehete hai
 It is very easy to write any number from this system
 jis teen sau chavalis ko ham roman pranali main CCC XL IV likhte hai, use bhartiya vidhi se 344 likh sakate hai
 Through this, the largest number can be written briefly without any difficulty
 bhartiya ganit ne dashamalav pranali kaa bhi avishkaar kiya
 The first use of decimal digits in India is found by Aryabhatta I
 sambhav he ki iskaa avishkaar isse bhi bahut pehle hua ho
 But in Europe, the general publication of decimal numbers was done in the seventeenth century, whose knowledge he had definitely gained from India
 ye bhartiya ganitiya siddhanth europe ko arab ke madhyam se praapt hue the
 In Arabic language these numbers are called Hindsa
 hindasa arthath 'hind se praapt'
 The Arabic script is written from right to left, but in Arabic the digits are written from left to right
 yah bhi is baat kaa pramaan he ki arabi ankon kii utpatti arabi bhashaa ke saath arab desh main nahin hui, apitu ye baahar se aayaat kiye gaye hai
 When these Indian numerals reached Europe through the Arabs, they felt that these numbers were invented originally by the Arabs

 During the reign of Khalifa al-mansur, some emissaries from Sindh went to Baghdad, including some scholars
 ve apane saath brahmagupta rachit brahmasfoot siddhanth evam khandakhadyak naamak granth bhi anya granthon ke saath baghdad le gaye
 With the help of these scholars, al-fajari and Yakub Khan Tariq translated them into Arabic, which had a special effect on Arabic mathematics

 The books of Alexandre de Viladi and Jan Aq Halifax also disseminated the 'hindu numeral system'
 prarambh main iskaa virodh hua, kint pandrahavin shatabdi ke madhya tak europe ke sabhi deshon ne inako sweekaar kar liya tha
 Other European countries learned the Indian numeral system from Arabia
 chunki unhen yah ank pranali arab se mili thi isaliye unhone iskaa naam 'arabi ank pranali' rakh diya
 After having a good knowledge of history, it is now being called 'hindu-arabic numeral' or 'hindu numerology' or 'indian numerology'
 samay samay main tathaa desh desh main bhartiya ank pranali ke ankon ke sanket main anek parivartan huye
 In the end, these numbers became in the form of 0, 1, 2, 3, xxrep 4 
 and they got international recognition
 aadhunik ank evam ank pranali vastav main bhartiya hi hai
 Presently, these modern numerals are known as the "international form of Indian numerals"

 Weight training should be considered different from bodybuilding, Olympic weight lifting, power lifting and Strongman, which are sports rather than types of exercise
 haalanki, bhaar prashikshan, aksar ek athlete ke prashikshan satr kaa hissaa hota he
 Strength training is an inclusive term that describes all exercises that are devoted to increasing physical strength
 bhaar prashikshan ek prakaar kaa bal prashikshan he jisamen bal badhaane ke liye lochadar, acentric training yaa mansapeshi pratirodh, ke bajaaye bhaar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Strength training is associated with aerobic exercise while elasticity training is associated with stretching exercises such as yoga or Pilates
 Weight training is often used as a synonym for force training, but in fact it is a distinct type in the inclusive class

 Another Greek man, physician Galen, described strength training in the second century using holtars
 ek or purv upkaran tha bhartiya club, jo pracheen faras se aayaa tha jahaan vah "miles" kehalaata tha
 It later became popular during the 19th century and recently made a comeback as a clubbell
 pracheen unani murtiyon bhi bharottolan kartab darshaati hai
 Weights were usually stones, but later dumbbells were used
 Barbels also joined these dumbbells in the late 19th century

 The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of exercise machines into the then-rare strength training gyms of the time
 Weight training became increasingly popular in the 1970s following the release of the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron and the popularity of Arnold Schwarzenegger

 The basic principles of weight training are essentially the same as strength training and involve the manipulation of repetitive numbers, set, speed, exercise type and weight changes to achieve the desired increase in strength, capacity, and size
 The specific combination of reps, sets, exercises and weights depends on the purpose of the person performing the exercise; Less repetitive sets can be performed with more weight

 upkaran ke prakaar main shaamil he bhaar mashin ke rup main barbel, dambal, ghirani or stack or chin-ap or push-ap ke maamle main sharir kaa apana bhaar
 vibhinn prakaar ke bhaar vibhinn prakaar kaa pratirodh dete hai or aksar ek hi nirpeksh bhaar ke alag-alag saapeksh bhaar ho sakate he jo istemaal kiye jane vaale upkarnon ke prakaar par nirbhar karte hai
 For example, lifting a 10 kg weight using a dumbbell can sometimes take more force than lifting 10 kg on a weight stack if a special pulley is used
 anya maamalon main, bhaar stack ko baraabar dambal ke bhaar ke mukaable adhik bal kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he jiskaa kaaran he atirikt tork yaa mashin main pratirodh
 Weight training also requires 'better posture' so that the movement is edited by proper muscle group and there is no transfer of weight to different parts of the body for maximum weight lifting
 Failure to adopt a correct posture during the training set can cause injury or make it difficult to meet training goals; Since the desired muscle group is not stressed enough, the limit of overload is not attained and muscle strength does not increase
 bhaar prashikshan kaa samgr laabh, bal prashikshan ke adhikansh anya prakaaron ke saath tulaneey he; ve vardhit mansapeshi, puttha or ligament shakti, asthi ghanatv, lacheelaapan, tone, chayapachay dar or mudratmak samarthan karte hai
 Weight training has advantages and limitations compared to other types of force training
 pratirodh prashikshan main gurutvkarshan ke bajaay loch yaa hydrolic pratirodh se lekar mansapeshi sankuchan kaa prayog shaamil he
 Weight training provides most of the resistance at the outset, the joint angle of movement at the beginning, when the muscle has to move out of the weight inertia
 is bindu ke baad, kul pratirodh jod ke kone ke aadhaar par badalata he
 In comparison, hydraulic resistance provides a certain amount of resistance across the entire range of movement, depending on the speed of movement
 loch pratirodh, harakat ke ant main sabase bada pratirodh pradaan karata he jab loch tatv ko sarvaadhik seemaa tak khinchaa jaataa he
 Isometric exercises provide a certain amount of resistance, depending on the force output of the muscle
 isse mansapeshi kaa vishisht jod kone majboot hota he jahaan samametiya vyaayaam ghatit hota he, jiske tahat bal kaa alp laabh nikatavarti jod kone par ghatit hota he
 In comparison, weight training strengthens the muscle over the entire range of movement in which the joint is exercised, resulting in an increase in physical force from the beginning of the joint angle to the end
 haalanki bhaar prashikshan, sharir saushthav ke samaan he, unke uddeshy bhinn hai
 Bodybuilders use weight training to increase the size, shape, and symmetry of their muscles, whether or not there is an increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding competition; They train to maximize their muscle size and develop extremely low levels of body fat
 iske vipareet, kai bhaar prashikshu apni takat or anaerobics kshamta main sudhaar karne ke liye prashikshan karte hai jabaki ve shaareerik vasa ko saamaanya str se kam karne ke liye vishesh dhyaan nahin dete hai
 The bodybuilding community has been the source of many theories, techniques, terminology and practices of weight training
 bhaar prashikshan, vyaayaam or bhaar main jabardast lacheelepan kii anumati detaa he, jo sharir shilpiyon ko vishisht mansapeshiyon or mansapeshi samoohon ko lakshith karne kii anumati detaa he or iske alaava vishisht lakshyon ko praapt karne main madad bhi karata he
 Of course, not all bodybuilding is introduced to competition in bodybuilding contests, and in fact the majority of bodybuilders do not compete at all, but they create bodies for their own personal reasons, except for any other The jury does not take care of the panel
 bhaar prashikshan, vyaayaam kaa ek surakshit rup he jab gatividhiyaan dhimi, niyantrit or saavdhaneepurvak paribhaashit hoti hai
 However, as is the case with any form of exercise, improper execution and failure to take proper precautions can cause injury
 jab vyaayaam ek set ke ant main mushkil ho jaataa he, to beyimaani karne kaa man karata he, arthath, prayaas main anya mansapeshi samoohon ko shaamil karte hue kharaab mudra kaa upyog karnaa
 isse prayaas kaa asar, kamjor mansapeshiyon par ja saktaa he jo vajan ko niyantrit nahin kar sakati
 udhaaharan ke liye, squat or deadlift kaa upyog sharir main sabase badi mansapeshiyon ke vyaayaam ke liye hota he - paanv or kuulhe - isliye unhen paryaapt bhaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Beginners try to bend their back while performing these exercises
 merudandi irector jo nichali peeth ko ghumaane kii anumati dete hai ve ridh kii kasherukaon main kartan paidaa kar sakate hai or sambhavit rup se merudandi discs ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Weight trainers typically spend 5 to 20 minutes in an initial light muscle workout before starting a workout
 samgr loch str ko badhaane ke liye puure sharir ko kheenchna aam he; tathaapi; bahut se log sirf usee hisse kaa khinchaav karte hai jiskaa vyaayaam unhen us din karnaa hota he
 Warm up sets are also important
 udhaaharan ke liye, apane seene par kaam karne vaale samaan prashikshu ko apane "kor tunnej" ko shuru karne se pehle kam se kam do varm ap set karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Core tonnage refers to the heavy weight that actually produces tension in your muscles
 udhaaharan ke liye agar prashikshu ke mukhya set bench par 205 lbs, 225 lbs or 235 lbs hai to varm ap ke liye 135 ke 5 doharaav or 185 ke 5 doharaav kii salaah di jaayegi
 thik se varm ap ho jane ke baad liftor main adhik bal or kshamta aa jaati he kyonki rakt kaa pravaah mansapeshi samoohon main hone lagata he
 Performing shallow breathing or exhaling while exercising limits the oxygen supply to the muscles and brain, leading to decreased performance and the risk of blackout or stroke by aneurysm under extreme stress
 kuch log shuddh antajkaran se bhaar prashikshuon ko "prayaas par shwaas lene" or bhaar chhodte samay shwaas chhodane kii salaah dete hai
 This technique ensures that the trainee breathes during the most difficult part of the exercise, while a person automatically stops breathing
 anya coach, prashikshuon ko vyaayaam ke dauraan valsalva harakat karne kii salaah dete hai jo ridh par bal daalata he, kyonki dhamneevisphar dwaara stroke kaa khatra dhad kii aparyaapt kathorta ke kaaran hone vaali ek orthopedic chot kii tulana main kaaphi kam hota he
 As is the case with other sports, weight trainees should avoid dehydration throughout the exercise by drinking enough water, even when not thirsty
 Unless you are sweating to the climax, thirst does not mean that you are already dehydrated
 haalanki, agar ek khilaadi kab or kitna pani piya jaae is baat kaa faisla apni pyaas se karata he, to isse uske nirjalit hone kaa khatra rahata he
 This is especially true in hot environments, or for those above 65 years of age
 kuch athlettic prashikshak, athleton ko vyaayaam karte samay har 15 minute par kareeb 7 british taral ounce pine kii salaah dete hai or din bhar main kareeb 80 british taral ounce 
 However, a more accurate determination of how much water is needed can be made such that weights should be measured before and after a typical exercise session, to determine how much fluid is spent during a workout
 vyaayaam ke dauraan sabase zyada taral padaarth kii haani paseene ke madhyam se hoti he, lekin jab tak aapkaa taral padaarth kaa seven mote taur par pasinaa nikalne ke baraabar rahata he, jalyojan str bana rahata he
 In most circumstances, sports drinks do not provide more physical benefits than water during weight training
 baharhaal, kam se kam ek ghante kii satat avadhi tak ucch tivrata vaale vyaayaam ke liye electrolites kii punahpurti kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he jo ek sports peya pradaan kar saktaa he
 Some people believe that energy drinks improve performance in weight training and other physical exercises, but in reality, these energy drinks can lead to dehydration, tremor, heat stroke and heart attacks if taken too much
 Huh
 uparokt sandarbh kaa sambandh red bul jaise 'urja peya' se he jisamen caffeine hota he, naa ki 'sports peya' se jisamen saadhaaran carbohydrate or pani hota he jo upar ullikhit bure prabhaav nahin daalata
 But it is also important not to consume too much water in a short period of time, as this can cause water intoxication and other electrolyte disturbances which in turn can cause nausea, vomiting, convulsions, brain swelling, fainting and possibly death
 aparyaapt jalyojan thakaan, vyathaa yaa mansapeshiy anthan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The urine of a person with better hydration should be almost colorless, while a deeper yellow color is normally a sign of insufficient hydration
 agar achaanak dard mahasoos ho to vyaayaam ko roak dena chahie, taaki aage chot naa lage
 haalanki, sabhi asuvidha, chot ko nahin darshaati he
 Weight training exercises are brief but very intense and many people are unaware of this level of effort
 yah abhivyakti "dard nahin, faaydaa nahin" aise joardaar prayaason se apekshit asuvidha se guzarate hue vyaayaam karne kaa ullekh karata he, naa ki jaanboojhkar bheeshan dard ko nazarandaz karne ko, jo naram utak chot se panpa ho saktaa he
 Discomfort can arise from other factors
 ve vyakti, jo prayek peshi samooh ke liye badi sankhya main doharaav, set or vyaayaam karte hai, ve apni mansapeshiyon main jalan kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 These individuals may also experience swelling in their muscles due to increased blood flow
 sahi mansapeshi thakaan kaa anubhav mansapeshiyon main shakti ke bekaabu nuksaan ke rup main samajha jaataa he, jo khud mansapeshiy tantuon se utpann hone ke bajaay tantrika tantra se utpann hota he
 Extreme nerve fatigue can be experienced as temporary muscle failure
 kuch bhaar prashikshan kaarykram, sakriy rup se asthaayee mansapeshi vifaltaa kii maang karte hai; aise prashikshan kaa samarthan karne ke liye saboot sabase achche rup main mishrit he
 However, whatever their schedule, most athletes who engage in high intensity weight training will experience muscle failure during their diet regimen
 shuruuaati logon ko bhaar prashikshan kaarykram ke liye dhire-dhire taiyaar hone kii salaah di jaati he
 In untrained individuals some muscles may be relatively stronger than others
 kisi vishesh vyaayaam main tab chot lag sakati he jab ek praathmik mansapeshi apni sthir mansapeshiyon se adhik majboot he
 By doing it slowly, the muscles have time to develop strength relative to each other
 isse vilamb peshiy vednaa shuruyaat ko kam karne main madad milti he
 Sudden adoption of an intense exercise program can cause severe muscle pain
 bina vyaayaam vaali mansapeshiyon main paar-sambandh hota he jo gahan vyaayaam ke dauraan tut jaataa he
 a person who begins intensive physical exercise training is usually advised to consult a physician, as there may be a condition of the heart or some other unknown condition that is against this action
 bench press yaa squat jaise vyaayaam jisamen bhaar ko uthaane main asafalataa ke parinamswaroop, liftor sambhawatah bhaar ke neeche funs saktaa he, bhaar ko saamanytah power rack ke andar yaa ek yaa adhik spotter kii upasthiti main karnaa chahie, jo bhaar prashikshu ke asamarth hone kii sthiti main barbal ko surakshit rup se punah rack par rakh sake
 Weight training usually requires different types of equipment, the most common being dumbbells, barbells and weight machines
 Special exercise of various combinations of machines, dumbbells and barbells allows weight trainers to exercise body parts in many ways
 kuch vyaayaam tareekon main sirf shaareerik bhaar vyaayaam kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jaise ki press-aps, jisamen upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he, jabaki dusron main, jaise ki pul-ap main kisi bhaar kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he, lekin ek pul-ap baar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo itnaa majboot hona chahie ki prashikshu kaa bhaar sah sake
 Other types of equipment include: in shabdon main "tonic" ke saath upsarg "iso" or "pliyo" ke saath "metric" kaa milaap he
 In "isotonic" exercises, the strength applied to the muscle does not change, while in "pleometric" exercises the muscle length is stretched and compressed to increase the muscle's energy production
 bhaar prashikshan vyaayaam kaa pramukh rup se ek isotonic rup he, chunki vazani vastu ko dhakelne yaa khinchne ke liye mansapeshi dwaara utpaadit shakti main parivartan nahin hona chahie 
 bhaar prashikshan ke liye kisi bhi vastu kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin dambal, barbel or anya vishisht upkaran saamaanya rup se isliye istemaal kiye jate hai kyonki inhen vishisht bhaar ke anusaar samyojit kiya ja saktaa he or aasaani se pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Many exercises are not really isotonic because the force on the muscle changes as the joints move through the range of motion
 gurutvkarshan ke saapeksh shakti ke kone ke aadhaar par gati aasaan yaa kathin ho sakati he; udhaaharan ke liye, ek maanak bicep karl tab aasaan ho jaataa he jab haath kandhe tak pahunchate hai kyonki adhikansh bhaar kohni kii sanrachana dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he
 Some machines, such as the Nautilus, include special simulation to keep the resistance constant regardless of the angle of the joints
 pliometric, myotatic riflex ko badhaane ke liye mansapeshiyon ke khinchaav-ghatautee chakra kaa upyog karata he
 This includes accelerated alternation of elongation and reduction of muscle fibers against resistance
 The resistance involved is often a weighted object such as a medicine ball or sandbag, but it can also be the body itself such as in a jumping exercise or a body with a contained load that moves the motion with resistance
 pliometric kaa upyog visphotak gati viksit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or mansapeshi ke sankuchan kii tivrata ko ek yatha sambhav choti avadhi ke liye sampeedit karne ke dwaara adhiktam urja ke bajaay adhiktam bal par dhyaan kendrit karata he or iskaa istemaal ek boxr ke ghunse ke prabhaav ko unnat banane ke liye, yaa ek basketbaal khilaadi kii urdhwadhar kud kshamta main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Caution should be exercised when performing pleometric exercises as they place more strain on the joints and tendons used than other forms of exercise
 pruthak vyaayaam ek aisa vyaayaam he jisamen harakat keval ek hi jod tak simit hoti he
 For example, leg extension is a separate exercise for quadriceps
 vishisht prakaar ke upkarnon ke upyog se yah sunishchit kiya jaataa he ki anya mansapeshi samooh keval nunatam maatra main hi shaamil hon-ve sirf vyakti ko ek sthir mudra banaae rakhane main madad karte hai-or harakat keval ghutane ke aasapaas hoti he
 Most isolated exercises involve the use of machines instead of dumbbells and barbells, although free weights can be used in combination with special postures and joint bracing
 mishrit vyaayaam main ek baar main kai mansapeshi samoohon kaa kaary hota he or isamen do yaa adhik jodon ke aasapaas kii harakat shaamil he
 For example, in leg press, movement occurs around the hip, knee, and ankle joints
 yah vyaayaam mukhya rup se quadricepse ko viksit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, lekin isamen hemestring, glutese or pindli bhi shaamil he
 Mixed exercises are generally similar to the way people naturally push, pull, or lift something, while isolated exercises often seem a little unnatural
 mishrit vyaayaam main aam taur par dambal or barbel shaamil hote hai, jo sharir or jodon ke saath-saath bhaar ko uthaane ke liye adhik mansapeshiyon ko shaamil karte hai
 Each type of exercise has its own use
 mishrit vyaayaam, buniyadi takat kaa nirmaan karte hai jisaki zarurat khinchne, dhakelne or uthaane kii dainik gatividhiyon ke liye hoti he
 Isolated exercises are important in "completing" a routine, for which they directly exercise muscle groups that cannot be fully exercised in a mixed exercise
 kiya jane vaala vyaayaam kaa prakaar, vyaktigat lakshyon par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Those who want to improve their performance in sports will mostly focus on mixed exercises and isolated exercises will be done only to strengthen the muscles that the player is lagging behind
 isi tarah, ek powerliftor un vishisht mishrit vyaayaamon par dhyaan kendrit karegaa jinka pradarshan powerlifting pratiyogitaaon main kiya jaataa he
 However, people who want to improve the appearance of their body without necessarily maximizing their strength (including bodybuilders), they will put more emphasis on separate exercises
 Both types of athletes, although generally mixed and isolated, use both exercises
 mukt bhaar main shaamil he dambal, barbal, dawa gend, sandbell or ketelbel
 bhaar mashin ke vipareet ve upyogkartaaon ko vishisht, nishchit harkaton ke liye vivash nahin karte or isliye inhen vyakti ke stablizer mansapeshiyon ke dwaara adhik prayaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is often argued that free weight exercises are better for this reason
 chunki bhaar mashin kharaab mudraon ko rokane kii disha main kaary kar sakati he, ve mukt bhaar kii tulana main nausikhia prashikshuon ke liye kuch had tak surakshit hoti hai
 iske alaava, chunki upyogkartaaon ko behatar mudra banaae rakhane par dhyaan kendrit nahin karnaa padataa he, ve vyaayaam ko karne main daale gaye prayaas par dhyaan kendrit kar sakate hai
 However, most athletes, bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts, prefer to use mixed free weight exercises to gain functional strength
 kuch mukt bhaar vyaayaam, ek vyaayaam gend par baith kar yaa let kar kiye ja sakate hai
 This makes it more difficult to maintain a correct posture, which helps exercise the deep torso muscles which are important in maintaining posture
 aisi kai bhaar mashine hoti hai jo aamtaur par pados ke jimon main pai jaati hai
 a Smith machine is a barbell that is limited to moving vertically up or down
 cabel mashin main do bhaar stack hote hai jo 2
5 meter kii duuri par hote hai, jisamen vibhinn prakaar ke handlon ke saath samyojya puli main se cabel guzarate hai 
 vyaayaam-vishisht bhaar mashine bhi hoti he jaise leg press
 ek multigim main vibhinn kismon kii vyaayaam-vishisht mashine ek hi tantra main shaamil hoti he
 a limitation of many free weight exercises or exercise machines is that, during only a small part of the lift, the muscle acts maximally against gravity
 kuch vyaayaam-vishesh mashiinon main ek andakaar cam hota he, jo pratirodh ko is prakaar badalata rahata he ki pratirodh or aavashyak mansapeshi bal, vyaayaam kii puri shrinkhalaa ke dauraan samaan bana rahata he
 a study published in 2009 revealed that weightlifting reduces symptoms of lymphedema in women who have undergone a mossetectomy
 is adhyayan se pehle ke dashakon main, mahilaon ko "bhaar uthaane se bachane" kii salaah di jaati thi kyonki aisa samajha jaataa tha kii isse limcadema ke viksit hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Dieters have also been seen to benefit from weight training as it prevents loss of body mass without fat when it comes under caloric reduction
 bhaar prashikshan haddiyon ko bhi majboot karata he or haddiyon kii haani or haddiyon kii kamajori ko rokane main madad karata he
 Weight training reduces falls in elderly persons, increasing muscle strength and improving balance

 Among the many notations of Sanskrit criticism, ornamentation is the most popular designation
 iske pracheen naamon main kriyalap vatsyayan dwaara nirdisht 64 kalaon main se anyatam he
 The naming "sahitya Vidya" mentioned by Rajasekhar depends on the Indian imagination of poetry, but these nomenclature could not become famous
 "alankarishastra" main alankaar shabd kaa prayog vyapak tathaa sankeern donon arthon main samajhnaa chahie
 The two meanings of the ornament are valid - vyapak arth sweekaar karne par alankarishastra kavyasobhaa ke aadhaek samast tatwon - gun, reeti, ras, vritti dhwani aadi--kaa vijaek shaastra he jisamen in tatwon ke swaroop tathaa mahatv kaa ruchir vivaran prastut kiya gaya he
 The name expresses its historical significance when taken in a narrow sense
 sahityashastra ke aarambhik yug main "alankaar" hi kavy kaa sarvasv mana jaataa tha jiske abhaav main kavy ushntahin agni ke samaan nishpraan or nirjeev hota he
 Critical analysis of "ornamentation" gave rise to the element of "quibble" on the one hand and a review of the meaning on the other gave a clear indication of the principle of "sound"
 isliye ras, dhwani, gun aadi kavyatatvon kaa pratipadak hone par bhi, alankaar praadhanya drushti ke kaaran hi, aalochanashastra kaa naam "alankarishastra" padaa or vah lokapriy bhi hua
 The achievement of ornaments, especially the metaphor, metaphor, utterance and exaggeration, is certainly found in the mantras of the Rigveda, but there is no evidence of the emergence of this scripture in the Vedic age
 nirukt ke anushilan se "upama" kaa saahitiyik vishleshan yask se purvavarti yug kii aalochana kii parinat fal prathit hota he
 Yasak has not only instructed the epithet of any ancient Acharya, he has also described the fundamental metaphor-types like Pratyapat Karmopama, Bhootopama, Roopopama, Siddhopama, Arthopama: Parasantpur: Sir
 isse spasht he ki alankaar kaa udai yask se bhi purv ho chukaa tha
 The names of Kashyapa and Varruchi, Brahmadatta and Nandiswami, Tarunavachaspati, have taken place among the adorned figures, but their texts and opinions are not known
 rajasekhar dwaara "kavyamimasaa" main nirdisht brihaspati, upamanyu, suvarnanabh, prachethayan, shesh, pulasthya, parashar, utathy aadi ashtadash aacharyon main se keval bharat kaa "naatyashaastra" hi aajkal uplabdh he
 Other Acharyas hold only imaginary power
 itnaa to nishchit he ki unani aalochana ke udai shatabdiyon purv "alankarishastra" pramanik shaastrapaddati ke rup main pratishthit ho chukaa tha
 Samudrabandha, the commentator of "alankarasarvasva", has given a beautiful account of the uniqueness of many sects of this scripture
 kavy ke vibhinn angon par mahatv tathaa bal dene se vibhinn sampradaayon kii vibhinn shatabdiyon main utpatti hui
 The number of main sects can be considered as six- in sampradaayon ne apane naam ke anusaar tattat 'kavy kii aatma' arthath mukhya praan sweekaar kiya he
 The chief Acharya of the Rasa sect is Bharata Muni who mainly analyzed the Natyaras and that description was considered authentic by the Avantar Acharyas also for the Kavyaras
 alankaar sampradaay ke pramukh acharya bhamah, dandi, udbhat tathaa rudrat hai
 In this view, ornamentation is considered to be the soul of poetry
 is shaastra ke itihaas main yahi sampradaay pracheenatam tathaa vyapak prabhaavapurn angeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The chief of the Reeti sect is Acharya Vamana, who in his "kavyalankarsutra" has considered Reeti as the soul of poetry in clear terms
 dandi ne bhi reeti ke ubhay prakaar--vaidarbhi tathaa gaudi--kii apane "kavyadarsh" main badi maarmik samiksha kii thi, parantu unki drushti main kavy main alankaar kii hi pramukhataa rahati he
 The origin of the Vakrokti sect is attributed to Acharya Kuntak, who in his "vakrokhivishiva" has accepted the "vakrokti" as the soul of poetry
 dhwani sampradaay kaa pravatrthan aanandavardhan ne apane ugantarkari granth "dhvanyalok" main kiya tathaa iskaa pratishthapan abhinav gupt ne dhvanyalok kii lochan tikaa main kiya
 Mammat, Ruyak, Hemachandra, Piyushvarsha Jayadeva, Vishwanath Kaviraj, Panditraj Jagannath - are the distinguished masters of this sect
 auchity sampradaay ke pratishthata kshemendra ne bharat, aanandavardhan aadi pracheen aacharyon ke mat ko grahan kar kavy main auchity tatv ko pramukh tatv angikaar kiya tathaa ise swatantra sampradaay ke rup main pratishthit kiya
 The rhetoric has thus been reviewing poetry for almost two thousand years
 yah shaastra atyant pracheen kaal se kavy kii samiksha or kavy kii rachana main aalochakon tathaa kaviyon kaa morganirdesh karata aayaa he
 This analysis of poetic both intimate and outmoded presents poignantly
 samikshasansar ke liye alankarishastra kii kavyatatvon kii chaar atyant mahatvapurn dein he jinka sarvang vivechan, antarang pareekshan tathaa vyaavhaarik upyog bhartiya saahitiyik manishiyon ne badi sookshmata se anek granthon main pratipaadit kiya he
 These are important poetic elements - justification, quibble, sound and rasa
 auchity kaa tatv lok vyavhaar main or kavyakala main nitant vyapak siddhant he
 On the basis of justification, the palace of Rasamimamsa stands
 aanandavardhan kii yah ukti samikshajgat main moulik tathy kaa upanyaas karti he ki anauchity ko chhodkar rasbhang kaa koi doosraa kaaran nahin he or auchity kaa upanibandhan ras kaa rahasybhoot upanishat he- Vakrokti Lokatikranta is the literary noun of the configuration of the transitional word
 vakrokti ke mahatmaya se hi koi bhi ukti kavy kii raspecial sookhti ke rup main parinat hoti he
 There is a lot of poetic touchiness to the "expressionism" quibble referred to by Crochet in Europe
 dhwani kaa tatv sanskrit aalochana kii teesri mahati dein he
 Our critics say that poetry does not reveal as much to our ears as it does, but it also has the ability to convey extremely deep meanings to our hearts
 yah sundar manoram arth "vyanjana" naamak ek vishisht shabdavyapaar ke dwaara prakat hota he or is prakaar vyanjak shabdaarth ko dhvanikavy ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Luckily, the vision of Abercrombie and Richards, a recognized critic of English, has just attracted this element
 rastatv kii mimasaa bhartiya aalochakon ke manovaigyanik samikshapaddati ke anushilan kaa manoram fal he
 Poetry is a reflection in the euphoria of supernatural bliss whether it is poetry, audio or visual
 hridayapaksh hi kavy kaa kalapaksh kii apeksha nitant madhutar tathaa shobhan paksh he, is tathy par bhartiya aalochana kaa nitant aagrah he
 Indian criticism is not at all providential in its scrutiny of the problem solving philosophy of life and thus it alone represents the three scriptures of the Western world - "poetics", "retarics" and "aesthetics"
 pracheenta, gambhirtha tathaa manovaigyanik vishleshan main yah pashchimi aalochana se kahin adhik mahatvashaalee he; is vishay main do mat nahin ho sakate

 Vedic civilization is the civilization of ancient India in which the Vedas were composed
 bhartiya vidvan to is sabhyataa ko anadi parampara aayaa hua maanate hai | pashchimi vidwano ke anusaar aaryon kaa ek samudaay bharat me lagbhag 1500 isvi isa purv aayaa or unke aagaman ke saath hi yah sabhyataa aarambh hui thi
 Generally, most scholars consider the period of Vedic civilization from 1500 BC to 500 AD, but the remains found from new archaeological excavations have found many remains of Vedic civilization, which modern scholars like David Frawley, Telagiri, BB Lal, s r Rao, Subhash Kak, Aurobindo have started to believe that Vedic civilization started in India itself and the Rigveda was composed in the Sunga period, kyonki aaryo ke bharat me aane kaa na to koi puraatatva utkhanno se pramaan mila he or na hi di en e anusandhano se koi pramaan mila he is kaal main vartmaan hindu dharm ke swaroop kii neenv padi thi jo aaj bhi astitv main he
 Apart from Vedas, many other Sanskrit texts were also composed during this period

 Max Müller first attempted to determine the Vedas
 usne buddha dharm se peeche kii ore chalate hue vaidic sahitya ke teen granthon kii rachana ko manamaane dhang se 200-200 varshon kaa samay diya or is tarah rugveda ke rachana kaal ko 1200 isa purv ke kareeb maan liya par nishchit rup se uske aankalan kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 The Vedic period can be mainly divided into two parts - the Rigvedic period and the post-vedic period

 It is believed that a group of Aryans went towards Iran and Europe in addition to India
 irani bhashaa ke pracheenatam granth avesta kii sukhtiyaan rugveda se milti julati hai
