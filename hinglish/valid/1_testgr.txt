 bhautikee kaa mahatv isaliye bhi adhik he ki abhiyantriki tathaa shilpavigyaan kii janmdatri hone ke naate yah is yug ke akhil saamaajik evam aarthik vikaas kii mul prerak he
 Long ago, it was called Natural Philosophy or Natural Philosophy, considering it as part of philosophy, but around 1870 AD it started to be addressed by current name Physics or Physics
 dhire-dhire yah vigyaan unnati karata gaya or is samay to iske vikaas kii teevr gati dekhakar, agraganya bhautik vigyaniyon ko bhi aashcharya ho rahaa he
 Gradually, it led to many important branches, such as chemical physics, star physics, biophysics, geophysics, nuclear physics, celestial physics, etc
 bhautikee kaa mukhya siddhant "urja sangrakshan kaa niyam" he
 According to this, the amount of energy of any mass is constant
 samudaay kii aantarik kriyaaon dwaara is maatra ko ghataana yaa badhanaa sambhav nahin
 Energy has many forms and can be transformed, but it cannot be possible to change its quantity in any way
 oinstin ke saapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar dravyaman bhi urja main badla ja saktaa he
 Thus both energy conservation and mass conservation principles are coordinated and through this theory physics and chemistry become interconnected

 Modern physics is directly related to the infrastructure

 This new branch of physics has given a new and revolutionary twist to the scientific ideology and social science and philosophy have also been significantly affected by it
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest
' At present, Electronics topic is considered to be a focal point, with the help of which the whole world is in motion! yokohama bandargah japan ke purvi tat par sthit nagar evam bandargah he jo yokohama shahar main he

 The following identities are related to the three-dimensional Euclidean holiday vector, some of which are also true for more Vima vector
 udhaaharan ke liye, do sadishon kaa sadish gunanfal sabhi vimaaon ke liye uplabdh nahin he
 The magnitude of vector a is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the components in the three mutually perpendicular directions of this vector
 yah pariman adish gunanfal kaa prayog karte hue nimnlikhit prakaar se bhi abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Here the notation denotes the dot product of vectors a and B
 The vector product and the scalar product of two vectors define the angle between them, say θ: To satisfy the right-hand rule, for positive θ, vector b is counter-clockwise from A, and for negative θ it is clockwise
 Here the notation a × b denotes the vector cross product of vectors a and b
the Pythagorean trigonometric identity then provides: If a vector a = makes angles α, β, γ with an orthogonal set of x-, y- and z-axes, then: and analogously for angles β, γ
 Consequently: with i ^, j ^, k ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ mathbf {i}}}, \ { \ hat { \ mathbf {j}}}, \ { \ hat { \ mathbf {k xxrep 5 } unit vectors along the axis directions
 The area σ of a parallelogram with sides a and b containing the angle θ is: which will be recognized as the magnitude of the vector cross product of the vectors a and b lying along the sides of the parallelogram
 That is: The square of this expression is: where γ is the Gram determinant of a and b defined by: In a similar fashion, the squared volume v of a parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors A, b and c is given by the Gram determinant of the three vectors: This process can be extended to n-dimensions
 Some of the following algebraic relations refer to the dot product and the cross product of vectors
 These relations can be found in a variety of sources, for example, see Albright

 He is our home


 our land
 Every person you love, whom you know, about whom you have heard, the one who was ever born, spent his entire life at this point
 All our joys and sorrows, thousands of religions and beliefs, every hunter, brave and coward, every king and farmer, every young couple in love, every mother and father, every child and scientist full of expectations, every teacher, every teacher Corrupt leaders, every 'superstar', every saint and sinner in our history lived there - on that particle of dust floating in a ray of sun

 un anginat atyaacharon ke bare main socho jo is bindu ke ek kone main rahane vaale logon ne kisi duusare kone par rah rahe apane hi jaise logon par kiye
 hamaari kitni galatchhemiyaan hai, ek duusare ko maar daalane kaa kitna utavlaapan he, duusare insaanon ke prati kitni nafrat he! We dupes humans, our pride, our illusion that we have a special place in the entire universe, this dull light point challenges all these things
 Our planet is a small lonely spot in this dense darkness of the universe
 In this vastness of the universe, there is no indication that someone will come from another planet to save our world from our evils
 abhi tak gyaat grahon main keval prithvi hi he jisamen jivan he
 aisi duusari koi jagah nahin he jahaan nikat bhavishya main ham rah saken

 – karl segan, khagolvaigyanik Carl Segan was three times married
 In 1957, he married biologist Lynn Margulis
 The couple had two children, Jeremy and Dorian Sagan
 karl sigan or margulis ke talaak ke baad, unhone 1 9 68 main kalakaar linda salzaman se vivaah kiya or unke paas ek baccha bhi tha, nik sagan in vivaahon ke dauraan, karl saagan ne apane kariyar par bahut jor diya, ek kaarak jisane saagan ke pehle talaak main yogadan diya ho
 In 1981, Sagan married Ann Drewian and later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan
 karl sigan or drunayan 1996 main apni mrityu tak shaadi kar chuke hai
 He lived in Ithaca in an Egyptian resurrected house on the edge of a cliff that was formerly the headquarters of the Cornell Secret Society
 ishak asimov ne keval do logon main segan ko ek ke rup main bataaya, jinaki budhimata apane aap ko paar kar gai thi
 The second, he claimed, was computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky
 saagan ne dharm or vigyaan ke bich dharm or sambandh ke bare main praayah baar baar likhaa he, jo ki bhagwaan kii paaramparik avadharana ke bare main apane andeh vyakt karte hai, jo ki ek shreshth vyakti he
 for example: kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bhagwaan ek chaunkaa safed dadhi vaala ek halkaa-chamade vaala purush he, jahaan kahin bhi ek singhaasana par akaash main baithe hue hai, har chimney ke patan ke saath milakar kaam karte hai
 Others — for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein — believe that God is basically the total amount of physical laws that describe the universe
 maanavpatiyon ke kuch chhipe hue khagoleey bindu se manushya ke bhagya ko niyantrit karne vaale manavputra kulapati ke liye koi sammohak sakshya nahin hai, lekin bhautik kanoonon ke astitv se inkaar karne main paagalpan hoga
 In another account of his idea of the concept of God, Sagan emphatically wrote: yah vichaar he ki bhagwaan ek behate hue dadhi ke saath ek vishaal safed nar he jo akaash main baithta he or har spairo ke patan ke str ko kam karata he yah ajeeb he parantu yadi ishwar ek hi bhautik kanoonon kaa matlab he jo brahmad ko niyantrit karata he, to spasht rup se aisa ek parameshwar he yah bhagwaan bhaavnaatmak rup se santoshjanak he 


 yah gurutvkarshan ke kanoon se prarthana karne ke liye zyada myne nahin rakhata he
 On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: ek naastik koi aisa vyakti he jo nishchit he ki bhagwaan astitv main nahin hai, koi vyakti jo ishwar ke astitv ke khilaaf majaburi saboot he mujhe koi aisi majaburi saboot nahin pataa he kyonki bhagwaan ko dur-samay or jagahon or antim kaarnon par le jaaya ja saktaa he, hamen is baat kii pushti karne ke liye brahmad ke bare main bahut kuch pataa hona chahie ki aisa koi bhagwaan maujuud nahin he
 Something about the existence of God and being something of the existence of God, i seem to have faith extremes in a subject with doubt and uncertainty as to actually inspire very little confidence 1996 main unke dharmik vishwaason ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main, sagon ne jawaab diya, "main agyeyavaadee hum
 "sagan said that it was difficult to prove or falsify the idea of god, the creator of the universe, and that the only scientific scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinite universe
 dharm par sagon ke vichaaron ko spinoja ke devtaa main oinstin ke vishwaas ke samaan tuchh samanta ke ek rup ke rup main vyakhya kiya gaya he
 His son, Dorian Sagan, said, "my father believed that the gods of Spinoza and Einstein, God is not behind nature, but nature
" " unki antim patni, en dryuyan ne kaha: When my husband died, because he was very famous and not known for being a believer, many people would come to me — sometimes it does — and ask me if Carl finally changed and Later changed to a belief
 ve mujhe aksar poochhate hai ki kya mujhe lagata he ki main use phir se dekhuunga
 Carl mustered the courage to face his death and never sheltered in confusion
 traasadee yah thi ki ham jaanate the ki ham ek-duusare ko phir kabhi nahin dekhenge
 i never hope to be with Carl again

 pashchim main pasta sabase pehle barahavin sadi ke aas-paas dakshini italy main lambey, patale rup main prayog kiya jaataa rahaa hoga
 After the establishment of pasta factories in the nineteenth century, the popularity of pasta spread throughout Italy, causing it to be mass produced for the Italian market
 unnisvin sadi ke antim bhaag main, sanyukt rajya america main restaurenton main spagati ko spagati italini ke naam se parosa jaataa tha or ise lahasun yaa kaali mirch ke saath banaae jane kii shuruyaat kai dashakon baad hui

 Escapism has come to be regarded as an antithesis of realism, especially in literature
 sanskrit sahitya main kathasaritsagar, dashakumarcharit, vaasavadatta, kandabari jaisi kathaon main palaayanwadee tatv kam nahin hai
 Even in plays with a very realistic view, Sanskrit litterateurs have often presented more of the dynastic aspects than the actual state of life for the entertainment of the upper class, except for the suicidal play of Sudraka
 kavy main "kaviparamparaon" or baad main "kaamshaastra" ke prabhaav ke kaaran jo nayak-nayika-tatv-vaadi sahitya likhaa gaya, use bhi ek seemaa tak palaayanwadee kaha ja saktaa he, yadhyapi yatharth kaa sarvatha abhaav usamen kahin nahin he

 Ritikalin Shringar is considered by Acharya Shukla and progressives after him to be a form of escapism because there is a complete lack of mass poetry in this poem
 bhaaratendu yug se hindi main samasyaon kaa sidhaa chithran prarambh hota he, kintu chhayavaad main pun: kavigan kalpit lok main vichrate hai; pant kii "jyotsna", prasad kii kamayani ke "rahasy" or "anand" sarg or niraala kaa "sookshm brahm" - yah sab dvivediyugin pratyaksh kavita ke sandarbh main palaayan prathit hota he
 This line of prasad is considered to be the level line of escapism - "let me forget my sailors slowly"
 yatharthwaad saamaajik samasyaon se sidhe takaraane main vishwaas karata he
 Escapism takes the person from imagination to the realm of imagination
 palaayanwaad ko vastut: manoranjan kaa paryaay nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Both memory and oblivion are necessary for life
 kintu aisi rachanaayen or kalaroop avashya palaayanwadee kehalaayenge jinamein jaagruk hokar pathak yaa darshak ko vaastaviktaa se dur rakhane kaa praytn ho
 This tendency is evident in the drinking of Sharadchandra's Devdas
 aaj ke yathartwaadee or vaigyanik yug main prayek prakaar kaa rahasyavaad palaayanwaad mana jayega; yon rahasywaadee sadhak keval usee ko yathartwaadee kahenge
 There are more types of crime fiction, detective novels and tapestry in America, Europe and now India too, but not all of these works and paintings can be called escapist

 These are the permanent winds moving from subtropical high-pressure lanes to sub-polar low-pressure lanes
 inaki pashchami disha ke kaaran inhe 'pachhuva pawan' kehete hai
 Permanent winds flowing from subtropical high air pressure tropics towards subipolar low air pressure in both the Earth's hemispheres are called westerly winds due to their westward movement
 In the northern hemisphere, it flows from southwest to northeast and in the southern hemisphere from northwest to southeast
 The best development of the westward winds is found between 40 ° to 65 ° south latitudes, because of the vast expanse of the waters here, the speed of the winds is relatively fast and the direction is fixed
 Due to their intensity in the southern hemisphere, they 'scream chalis' between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, 'prachanda Pachasa' in the adjacent areas of 50 degrees south latitude and 'screaming satha' near 60 degrees south latitude
 It is said that due to the huge land segment of uneven high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and the changing seasonal pattern of air pressure, the flow of this wind from the general western direction is unclear
 The range of these winds towards the pole is very unstable, which changes according to the weather and other reasons

 Gambling is an ancient game
 bharat main jue kaa khel akshakreeda yaa akshadyut ke naam se vikhyath he
 It has been an extremely popular Indian game since the time of Vedas
 rugveda ke ek prakhyat sookt main kithav apni durdasha kaa rochak chitra khinchataa he ki jue main haar jane ke kaaran uski bharya tak use nahin puuchhati, dusron kii baat hi kya? vah swayan shiksha detaa he- akshderma divyah krushimit krishasv 
 a catastrophic war like the Mahabharata also resulted in Akashrida
 panini kii ashtaadhi tathaa kashika ke anushilan se akshakreeda ke swaroop kaa puraa parichay miltaa he
 Panini calls him Akashik
 
 Patanjali has used the words Akatitav or Akshadhuta for Siddhasta gaming
 vaidic kaal main dyut kii saadhan saamagree kaa nishchit parichay nahin miltaa, parantu panini ke samay main yah khel aksh tathaa shalaka se khelaa jaataa tha
 Kautilya's Arthashastra states that it is the duty of the ambassador to give the gamblers axes and spindles to play on behalf of the state

 kashika isi kaaran is khel ko panchika dyut ke naam se pukaarti he 
 Panini's Akshashalaaka number: The Parina Sutra mentions the conditions in which the goat thrower was defeated, and the terms Axar, Shalakaparika, Ekpari, Dwipari, Tripari and Chaturpari were used in Sanskrit to inform this situation
 kashika ke varnan main spasht he ki yadi uparyukt paanchon gotiyaan chitt giren yaa patt giren, to donon avasthaaon main goti phenkane vaale kii jeet hoti thi 
 That is, if a clot was different from the position of other pieces, the mind or platen, then there was defeat and for this, different words were used
 isi prakaar do gotiyon se hone vaali haar ko dwipari teen se tripari tathaa chaar kii haar ko chatushpari kehete the
 Kali was the winner and the bet to lose was called Kali
 buddha granthon main bhi krit tathaa kali kaa yah virodh sanketit kiya gaya he 
 Betting is also done in gambling and for this matter, Panini has considered the accomplishment of the word glah
 mahabharat ke prakhyat juadi shakuni kaa yah kahana thik hi he ki baaji lagane ke kaaran hi jua logon main itnaa badnaam he

 According to the Arthashastra, the gambler had to pay money to the state for his game

 Later, many scholars have written the story of Lord Rama according to their wisdom, knowledge and opinion
 is tarah se anekon ramaayanon kii rachanaayen hui hai
 According to Hindu scriptures, Lord Rama was an incarnation of Vishnu
 is avatar kaa uddeshy mrityulok main maanavjaati ko adarsh jivan ke liye maargdarshan dena tha
 Finally, Shriram killed Ravana, the king of the demon race and restored the religion
 ayodhya nagari main dasharath naam ke raja huye jinaki kaushalya, kaikeyi or sumitra naamak patniyaan thim
 Ayodhyapati Dasaratha, to get children, under the command of his Guru Shri Vashistha performed a son Kameshti Yajna, which was performed by the Rishi Rishi
 bhakthipurna aahutiyaan paakar agnidev prasann huye or unhone swayan prakat hokar raja dasharath ko havishyapaatr diya jise ki unhone apni teenon patniyon main baant diya
 The consumption of Kheer resulted in the birth of Rama from Kaushalya's womb, Bharata from Kaikeyi's womb, and Laxman and Shatrughan from Sumitra's womb
 rajkumaron ke bade hone par ashram kii rakshason se raksha hetu rishi vishwamitra raja dasharath se ram or lakshmana ko maang kar apane saath le gayi
 Rama killed demons like Tadka and Subahu and killed Maricha with no fruit arrows and sent them across the sea

 On receiving the invitation of King Janak for Dhanushagya, Vishwamitra came to his city Mithila with Ram and Lakshmana
 raste main ram ne gautam muni kii stri ahalya kaa uddhaar kiya
 In Mithila, Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, also known as Janaki, was also organized as a swayamvar where Rama married Sita by breaking the rainbow according to the Janakprati
 ram or sita ke vivaah ke saath hi saath guru vashishtha ne bharat kaa mandavi se, lakshmana kaa urmila se or shatrughna kaa shrutakirti se karvaa diya
 Shortly after Rama's marriage, King Dasaratha wanted to crown Rama
 is par devtaa logon ko chintaa hui ki ram ko rajya mil jane par ravan kaa vadh asambhav ho jaayegaa
 Distraught, he prayed to Goddess Saraswati for some kind of remedy
 saraswati ne manthra, jo ki kaikeyi kii daasi thi, kii buddhi ko pher diya
 Kaikeyi went to Kop Bhavan with Manthara's advice
 dasharath jab manaane aaye to kaikeyi ne unase vardaan maange ki bharat ko raja banaaya jaye or ram ko chaudaa varshon ke liye vanvaas main bhej diya jaye
 Sita and Lakshman also went to the forest with Rama
 rungverpur main nishadaraaj guhya ne teenon kii bahut seva kii
 After some hesitation, the boatman drove the three across the river Ganges
 prayag pahunch kar ram ne bharadwaj muni se bhent kii
 Ram Yamuna, bathing from there, reached the ashram of Valmiki Rishi
 valmiki se hui mantranaa ke anusaar ram, sita or lakshmana chitrakoot main nivas karne lage
 Dasaratha died in Ayodhya due to the disconnection of the son
 vashishtha ne bharat or shatrughna ko unke nanihaal se bulavaa liya
 On coming back, Bharata did his mother Kaikeyi, for his wretchedness, repented a lot and performed the funeral procession of Dasaratha according to the gurus
 bharat ne ayodhya ke rajya ko asweekaar kar diya or ram ko manaa kar waapas laane ke liye samast snehijanon ke saath chitrakoot chale gayi
 Kaikeyi also felt very sorry for his actions
 sita ke mata-pita sunayana evam janak bhi chitrakoot pahunche
 Bharata and all the other people proposed Ram to go back to Ayodhya to be ruled by Rama, who obeyed his father and obeyed Raghuvansh
 bharat apane snehi janon ke saath ram kii paduka ko saath lekar waapas ayodhya aa gayi
 He enshrined Rama's Paduka on the throne and started living in Nandigram himself
 kuch kaal ke pashchaat ram ne chitrakoot se prayaag kiya tathaa ve atri rishi ke ashram pahunche
 Atri praised Rama and his wife Anasuya explained the merits of Pativrat Dharma to Sita
 vahaan se phir ram ne aage prasthaan kiya or sharbhang muni se bhent kii
 Sharabhang Muni was residing there only by wishing to see Rama, so having fulfilled his desire for Rama's darshan, burnt his body with yogagni and made Brahmaloka move
 or aage badhane par ram ko sthaan sthaan par haddiyon ke dher dikhaai pade jinke vishay main muniyon ne ram ko bataaya ki rakshason ne anek muniyon ko kha daalaa he or unheen muniyon kii haddiyaan hai
 On this, Rama vowed that he would slay all the demons and make the earth devoid of demons
 ram or aage bade or path main sutikshn, agastya aadi rishiyon se bhent karte huye dandak van main pravesh kiya jahaan par unki mulaakaat jataayu se hui
 Ram made Panchavati his place of residence
 panchvati main ravan kii bahan shurpanakha ne aakar ram se pranay nivedan-kiya
 Rama sent him to Laxman, saying that he is with his wife and his younger brother is alone
 lakshmana ne uske pranay-nivedan ko asweekaar karte huye shatru kii bahan jaan kar uske naak or kaan kaat liye
 Shurpanakha asked for help from khar-khoan and he came to fight with his army
 ladaai main ram ne khar-dooshan or uski sena kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Shurpanakha went and complained to her brother Ravana
 ravan ne badla lene ke liye marich ko swarnamrig bana kar bheja jisaki chaal kii maang sita ne ram se kii
 After ordering Laxman to protect Sita, Rama went after him to kill the golden form of Maricha
 marich ke haathon maaraa gaya par marate marate marich ne ram kii aawaaj bana kar ‘ha lakshmana’ kaa krandan kiya jise sun kar sita ne ashankavash hokar lakshmana ko ram ke paas bhej diya
 After Laxman's departure, Sita alone deceived Ravana and took him with him to Lanka
 raste main jataayu ne sita ko bachaane ke liye ravan se yuddh kiya or ravan ne uske pankh katkar use adhamra kar diya
 Not finding Sita, Ram became very sad and started mourning
 raste main jataayu se bhent hone par usne ram ko ravan ke dwaara apni durdasha hone va sita ko har kar dakshin disha kii ore le jane kii baat bataai
 After telling all this, Jatayu gave up his life and Rama proceeded within the dense forest in search of Sita after performing his last rites
 raste main ram ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran rakshas bane gandharv kabandh kaa vadh karke uskaa uddhaar kiya or shabari ke ashram ja pahunche jahaan par ki uske dwaara diye gayi jhuthe beron ko uske bhakthi ke vash main hokar khaaya
 Thus Rama proceeded inside the dense forest in search of Sita
 ram rishyamook parvat ke nikat aa gayi
 Sugriv lived with his ministers on that mountain
 sugriv ne, is ashanka main ki kahin baali ne use maarane ke liye un donon veeron ko na bheja ho, hanuman ko ram or lakshmana ke vishay main jaankaree lene ke liye brahman ke rup main bheja
 After knowing that he was not sent by Bali, Hanuman befriended Rama and Sugriva
 sugriv ne ram ko santvana di ki janaki ji mil jaayengin or unhen khojane main vah sahaayta degaa saath hi apane bhai baali ke apane upar kiye gayi atyaachaar ke vishay main bataaya
 Rama fraudulently slaughtered Bali and gave the kingdom of Kishkindha to Sugriva and gave the post of crown prince to Angad's son Angad
 rajya prapti ke baad sugriv vilaas main lipt ho gaya or varsha tathaa sharad ritu vyateet ho gai
 On Rama's displeasure, Sugriva sent the monkeys to search for Sita
 sita kii khoj main gayi vaanron ko ek gupha main ek tapaswini ke darshan huye
 Tapaswini brought the search party to the beach with the power of yoga where she met Sampathi
 sampaati ne vaanron ko bataaya ki ravan ne sita ko lanka ashokavatika main rakhaa he
 Jambavant encouraged Hanuman to cross the sea
 hanuman ne lanka kii ore prasthaan kiya
 Sursa took the test of Hanuman and blessed him by finding him worthy and capable
 maarg main hanuman ne chaaya pakadaney vaali rakshasi kaa vadh kiya or lankini par prahaar karke lanka main pravesh kiya
 He met Vibhishan

 Hanuman killed Ravana's son Akshay Kumar by destroying the Ashokavatika
 meghnath hanuman ko nagapasha main baandh kar ravan kii sabha main le gaya
 In response to Ravana's question, Hanuman introduced himself as the messenger of Rama
 ravan ne hanuman kii punch main tel main duba hua kapadaa baandh kar aag laga diya is par hanuman ne lanka kaa dahan kar diya
 Hanuman approaches Sita
 sita ne apni chudamani de kar unhen vidaa kiya
 They came back across the sea and met all the apes and all went back to Sugriva
 hanuman ke kaary se ram atyant prasann huye
 Ram reached the beach with the army of apes
 udhar vibhishana ne ravan ko samajhaayaa ki ram se bair na len is par ravan ne vibhishana ko apamaanit kar lanka se nikaal diya
 Vibhishana came under the shelter of Rama and Rama declared him king of Lanka
 ram ne samudr se rasta dene kii vinati kii
 Rama was angry at not accepting the request and fearing his anger, Samudra himself came after pleading for Rama and told him how to build a bridge by Nal and Neel
 jambavant ke aadesh se nal-nil donon bhaaiyon ne vanar sena kii sahaayta se samudr par pul baandh diya
 Sri Rama established Sri Rameshwar and worshiped Lord Shankar and crossed the ocean with the army
 samudr ke paar jaakar ram ne deraa daalaa
 Ravana was deeply disturbed by the news of the bridge being tied and Rama crossing the sea
 mandodari ke ram se bair na lene ke liye samajhane par bhi ravan kaa ahankaar nahin gaya
 Here Rama along with his vanarasena started living on the Subel mountain
 angad ram ke doot ban kar lanka main ravan ke paas gayi or use ram ke sharan main aane kaa sandesh diya kintu ravan ne nahin mana
 The war started when all the peace attempts failed
 lakshmana or meghnad ke madhya ghor yuddh hua
 Lakshman fainted due to the power of Shaktiban
 unke upachaar ke liye hanuman sushen vaidya ko le aaye or sanjivani laane ke liye chale gayi
 On receiving the news from the intelligence, Ravana sent Kalanemi to interrupt Hanuman's work, which Hanuman killed
 aushadhi kii pahchaan na hone ke kaaran hanuman puure parvat ko hi uthaa kar waapas chale
 On the way, in the suspicion of Hanuman being a demon, Bharat fainted by hitting the arrow, but knowing the truth, he sat on his arrow and sent it back to Lanka
 idhar aushadhi aane main vilamb dekh kar ram pralaap karne lage
 Hanuman brought medicine at the right time and Lakshman became healthy with the treatment of Sushen
 ravan ne yuddh ke liye kumbhkarna ko jagaaya
 Kumbhakarna also unsuccessfully prayed to Ravana to go to Rama's shelter
 yuddh main kumbhkarna ne ram ke haathon paramgati praapt kii
 Laxman fought Meghnad and killed him
 ram or ravan ke madhya anekon ghor yuddh huai or ant main ravan ram ke haathon maaraa gaya

 While Tulsidas ji has abolished Ramcharitmanas by writing the above description, Adikavi Valmiki in his Ramayana narrates the birth of Ravana and Hanuman in Uttarakhand, Sita's exile, Raja Nriga, Raja Nimi, Raja Yayati and the dog's justice in Ramrajya, The birth of Lavkush, the ritual of Ashwamedha Yajna by Rama and the Ramayya composed by Mahakavi Valmiki by his sons Love and Kush in that Yagya

 Inspired by the Ramayana itself, Maithilisharan Gupta composed the clauses named Panchavati and Saket

 Zamindari system was a political-social practice prevalent in India during the Mughal era and the British period in which the land was owned by someone else rather than by the people who collected taxes from the cultivators

 According to the ancient ideology of India, land was public property, so it could not be the property of the person

 According to Maharishi Jaimini, "the king could not surrender the land because it is not his property but the combined property of human society

 Manu also has a clear statement that "according to the rishis, the first right to own land is the one who plowed the forest and cleaned it"

 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help
 is prakaar bharatvarsh ke itihaas main sarvapratham in bandobaston dwaara rajya or krishakon ke bich main jameendaaron kaa varg angrejon kii niti dwaara sthapit hua jiske fal swaroop krishakon ke bhu-sampatti adhikaar, jo anadi kaal se chale aa rahe the, chhin gaye
 This intermediate class became wealthier day by day as the British rulers continued to give more and more of their money as a bait
 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system
 is pratham charan main, jo san 1859 i0 se 1929 i0 tak rahaa, jo kanoon bane unase jameendaaron ke lagaan badhaane ke adhikaron par kuch pratibandh lagaae gaye or ucch shrenee ke krishakon ko laabh bhi hue
 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers
 kintu jameendaar phir bhi krishakon ko apane nyaaypurna tathaa anyaaypurna karon ko vasuulne ke liye nichodte rahe jisase kisaanon main ghor asantosh tathaa bechaini failene lagi
 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
 is samay main saare desh main kisaan andolan hone lage
 The seed of these movements was sown by a Kisan Sabha which took place on 11 February 1918 in Allahabad meeting of All India Congress
 tatpashchaat congress kisaanon ke hiton ko aage badhaane lagi
 As a result, there was a lot of awareness among the rural masses

 Influenced by the peasant movements, new Acts were enacted in the Raiyatwadi areas to protect the interests of the farmers

 After this, Bhopal Land Revenue Act, 1935 and Assam Tenancy Act 1935 passed

 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan
 yah pratha british shashan ke aagaman main laai gai or isse gramin jivan purnataya tahas nahas ho gaya he’
 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted
 yuddh kii samaapti ke baad jameendaari pratha ke ant kaa antim charan aarambh hua jo san 1945 se 1955 tak chalaa
 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr
 Bennet ',' Surtijsquire 'drunk
 bengal land kamishan bhi is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki ‘san 1793 i0 kaa sthaayee bandobast us samay jin bhi kaarnon se uchit samajha gaya ho, aaj kii paristhiti main anupyukt he or jameendaari pratha main itani buraaiyaan upaj chuki he ki yah ab raashtra ke hit main kisi bhi prakaar upyogi nahin rah gai he
 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state

 The seven wonders included: The earliest lists had the Ishtar Gate as the seventh wonder of the world instead of the Lighthouse of Alexandria
 The Greek category was not Wonders but "thaumata", which translates closer to "things to be seen"
 The list that we know today was compiled in the Middle Ages—by which time many of the sites were no longer in existence
 Today, the only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza
 Many lists of wonders of the world are said to have existed during the Middle Ages, although it is unlikely that these lists originated at that time because the word medieval was not even invented until the Enlightenment-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century
 Brewer's refers to them as "later list" suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages
 Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages, but were well known
 These lists go by names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Medieval Mind and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages
 Typically representative of the seven greatest wonders of the Medieval world are: Other sites included on such lists: Many lists have been made of the greatest structures built during modern times or of the greatest wonders existing today

 Twenty-one finalists were announced January 1, 2006
 Egypt was not happy with the fact that the only original wonder would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and other landmarks; and called the project absurd
 To solve this, Giza was named an honorary Candidate
 The results were announced on July 7 2007 in Benfica's stadium in a big ceremony in Lisbon, Portugal, and are listed here: In November 2006 the American national newspaper USA Today in conjunction with the American television show Good Morning America revealed a list of New Seven Wonders as chosen by six judges
 The wonders were announced one per day over a week on Good Morning America
 An eighth wonder was chosen on November 24 from viewer feedback
 Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, as there has been debate over how large the list should be
 One of the many lists was compiled by CNN: new7wonders of Nature is a contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen by people through a global poll, organized by New Open World Corporation, which ran the New Seven Wonders of the World campaign
