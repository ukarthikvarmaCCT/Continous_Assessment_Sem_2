 At the same time, the fortress of Purandar died and a fight broke out between his three sons for the succession of the fort
 do bhaaiyon ke nimantran par shivaji maharaj purandar pahunche or kootneeti kaa sahaara lete hue unhone sabhi bhaaiyon ko bandi bana liya

 Shivaji had both Bijapur and Mughal enemies

 At the same time, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur died on 1 November 1656, after which an atmosphere of chaos arose in Bijapur

 Aurangzeb migrated to North India as soon as he was afflicted and became the Shah of the Mughal Empire after imprisoning Shah Jahan there

 After taking over Kalyan and Bhiwandi, they established a naval base there
 is samay tak shivaji 40 durgon ke maalik ban chuke the
 After Aurangzeb returned to Agra, the Sultan of Bijapur also breathed a sigh of relief
 ab shivaji hi bijapur ke sabase prabal shatru rah gaye the
 Shahaji was already asked to keep his son under control but Shahaji showed his inability to do so
 shivaji se nipatane ke liye bijapur ke sultan ne abdullah bhatari ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja
 Afzal traveled in 1659 with 120,000 soldiers

 But Shivaji stayed on the fort of Pratapgarh
 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan

 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji
 2 oktober 1665 ko bijapuri sena ne panhala durg par adhikaar kar liya
 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry

 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army

 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year

 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe

 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back

 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time

 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony

 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD

 Today, "game theory" is like an umbrella or 'unified field' theory for the logical side of social science in which 'social' is interpreted to include human as well as other players
 game theory ke paaramparik anuprayogon main in gemon main samyavasthaayen khojane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In equilibrium, each player of the game adopts a policy that they might not change
 is vichaar ko samajhane ke liye samyavastha kii kai sari avadharanaen viksit kii gai hai 
 The motivation of these concepts of equilibrium varies and depends on the field in which they are being used, although their meanings are somewhat intermingled and harmonized
 yah paddati aalochana rahit nahin he or samyavastha kii vishesh avadharanaon kii upyuktata par, samyavasthaaon kii upyuktata par or aamtaur par ganitiya modelon kii upyogita par vaad-vivaad jari rahete hai
 Although there were already some developments in this area, the field of game theory came into being with John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern's 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is siddhant kaa vikaas bade paimaane par 1950 ke dashak main kai vidwaanon dwaara kiya gaya
 Later game theory was explicitly used in biology in the 1970s, although it had begun only in the 1930s
 game theory kii pahchaan vyapak rup se kai kshetron main ek mahatvapurn upkaran ke rup main kii gai he
 Eight Game Theorists have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, and John Maynard Smith has been awarded the Crowford Prize for experimentation in biology of game theory
 game theory main awalokit game spashtatya paribhaashit ganitiya 'objects'hote hai
 a game is made up of a set of players, a set of moves available to the players, and determining the benefit of each combination of policies
 adhikansh 'kooparative game' vishesh function form main nirupit kiye jate hai, jabaki ekstensive or normal form kaa prayog noncooparative gemon ko paribhaashit karne main hota he
 Extensive forms can be used to 'formalize' games with some important sequences
 isamen game aksar 'treez' ke rup main nirupit kiye jate hai yahaan prayek vartex ek khilaadi ke liye vikalp kii ek bindu darshata he
 The player is specified by a number listed by 'vertex'
 vartex se baahar nikali rekhaaen us khilaadi ke ek sambhavya kriya ko darshaati hai
 The benefits are specified at the bottom of the tree
 yahaan chitrit game main do khilaadi dikhaae gaye hai
 Player 1 first moves and chooses either f or U
 khilaadi 2 khilaadi 1kii chaal ko dekhtaa he or phir yaa to a yaa r chunata he 
 Suppose player 1 chooses u and then player 2 chooses A, then player 1 gets 8 and player 2 gets
 ekstensive form, vaise game jinamein donon chaalen ek saath nahin chali jaatin or aise game jiname jaankaree pakki nahin hoti, in do prakaar ke gemon kii bhi vyakhya kar saktaa he
 To represent this, different vertexes — to show them part of the same information set — are either joined by a dotted line, or a closed line is drawn between them
 normal aamtaur par ek metrics ke dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he jisamen khilaadi, chaalen or laabh ankit rahete hai 
 Generally this can be represented by a function that is associated with the benefit of all combinations of moves of each player
 saath main die gaye udhaaharan main do khilaadi hai; ek ro kaa chayan karata he or doosraa kollam kaa
 prayek khilaadi ke paas do ranneetiyaan hai jo ro or cholemon kii sankhya ke dwaara nirdisht kii gayi hai
 The benefits are given inside
 pehali sankhya ro vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he; duusari sankhya kollam vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he
 Suppose if player 1 moves up, player 2 moves left
 tab khilaadi 1 ko 4 laabh praapt hota he or khilaadi 2 ko 3 praapt hota he
 When a game is presented in normal form, it is assumed that each player plays simultaneously or is at least ignorant of the other's moves
 yadi khilaadiyon ko ek duusare ke vikalpon kii koi jaankaree hoti he to game ko aam taur par ekstensive form main prastut kiya jaataa he
 'cooperative' games with transferable utility do not offer any independent distinct benefits
 iske bajaay, kairactaristic function prayek gathbandhan ke liye laabh nirdhaarit karata he
 The standard assumption is that the empty alliance gains 0
 is form kaa praarambhik strot won neumann or morganstern kii aadharbhoot pustak se praapt hota he
 While studying coital normal form games, he assumed that when an alliance formed c { \ displaystyle C} C, it played against complementary coalitions as if they were playing a 2-player game
 c { \ displaystyle C} c kaa samyavastha laabh kairactaristic hota he
 Now there are different models for extracting coefficient values from normal form games, but not all games of characteristic form can be derived from normal form games
 niyamanusaar, ek kairactaristic function form game ek peyar { \ displaystyle } ke rup main nirupit kiya jaataa he jahaan n { \ displaystyle N} khilaadiyon ke ek set ko vyakt karata he or v : 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v:2^{n} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R} } ek kairactaristic function hota he
 The characteristic function form is generalized in games with no transferable utility routing
 kairactaristic function form 'coalishan' ke gathan ke sambhavya 'externalitiz' ko nazarandaz kar detaa he
 In partition function form, the benefit of 'coalition' depends not only on its members but also on how the other players are divided
 game theory kaa prayog maanav or pashu ke vividh vyavhaaron ke vistrut adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including the behavior of companies, markets, and consumption theory
 saamaajik vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog or vistrut hua he or game theory raajnneetik, saamaajik or manovaigyanik vyavhaaron ke adhyayan main bhi prayukt hua he
 Game theory-based analysis was initially used by Ronald Fisher in the 1930s to study animal behavior
 yah kaam "game theory" ke naam ke aastitiv main aane se pehle kaa he, lekin isaki or game theory kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Its development in economics was later used in biology by John Menard Smith in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games
 vyavhaar ke anumaan or vyakhya ke alaava game theory kaa prayog naitik yaa maanak vyavhaar ke siddhanton ko viksit karne ke prayaas main bhi kiya gaya he
 In economics and philosophy, scholars have also used game theory to understand good or appropriate behavior
 agar ham peeche jaaen to dekh sakate he ki game theory aadhaarit is prakaar ke bhavarth ko plato ne bhi prastut kiya tha
 The use of game theory in political science focuses on the overlapping areas of fair division,]]]
 in kshetron main se prayek main, shodhakartaaon ne game theory aadhaarit modelon ko viksit kiya he jinamein khilaadi aksar matadaata, rajya, special interest group or raajnneetijna hote hai
 For early examples of game theory used in political science, see the work of Anthony Downs
 apni pustak ain iconomik theory of demokrasisaanchaa:harvard citations / core main unhone 'hoteling form lokation model'ko raajnneetik pranali main prayukt kiya he
 In the Downsian model, political candidates are committed to principles in a one-dimensional policy 'space'

 is tarah riyaayaten pradaan karne ke prati avishvaas or anichhaa hogi yadi vivaadadheen dalon main se kam se kam ek dal gaiyr-loktantric saanchaa:harvard citations / core he
 Economists have long been using game theory to analyze a wide range of economic facts, including auctions, bargains, duopoly, equitable division, oligopolies, the construction of social networks, and voting mechanisms
 yah anusandhan saamanytah ranneetiyon ke vishisht samucchyon par kendrit hota he, jinhen khelon main santulan kehete hai
 These "solution concepts" are generally based on the requirements of the rules of rationality
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main, naish santulan inamen se sabase prasiddh he
 If a set of strategies represents the best response to other strategies, it is Nash equilibrium
 isaliye yadi sabhi khilaadi apni chaalen naish santulan main chal rahe hai, to unke bich path se hatane ke liye koi ekatarfa pralobhan nahin hoga, chunki unki ranneeti sarvshereshth he, atah ve vah kar sakate hai, jo anya khilaadi kar rahe hon
 The profits of the game are usually taken to represent the individual game theory utility of the players
 adarsh sthitiyon main munaafaa aksar dhan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo sambhawatah kisi vyakti kii upyogita se sambandhit hota he
 However this assumption may be flawed
 arthshaastra main game theory par ek pratimanaatmak shodhpatr kisi aise khel kii prastuti ke dwaara prarambh hota he, jo kisi vishisht aarthik sthiti kaa sankshepan ho
 One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which set of strategies are appropriately balanced in the presented game
 swaabhaavik rup se hamen yah aashcharya ho saktaa he ki is jaankaree kaa kya upyog kiya jaae
 Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses: descriptive and prescriptive
 pehla gyaat upyog is baat ko varnit karnaa he ki maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karti he
 Some scholars believe that by discovering game equilibria, they can predict how the actual human population will behave when confronted with situations similar to those described in the game being studied
 game theory kaa yah vishisht drushtikon naveenatam aalochana kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 First, it is criticized for noting that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated
 game theoricar yah maan sakate hai ki khilaadi apni vijayon ko pratyaksh rup se adhiktam str tak badhaane ke liye sadaiv ek hi prakaar se kaary karte hai, lekin vyavhaarik taur par, maanav swabhaav aksar is model se bhinn hota he
 There are many interpretations of this fact: irrationality, new models of deliberation, or even various motivators
 pratyuttar main game theoricar apni dharanaon kii tulana bhautik-shaastra main prayukt dharanaon ke saath karte hai
 Thus although their assumptions do not always prove true, they can use game theory as a scientific ideal similar to the patterns used by physicists
 haalaanki is game theory ke prayog par kuch atirikt aalochana bhi laadi jaati he kyonki kuch adhyayanon ne yah pradarshit kiya he ki vyakti santulan ranneetiyon kaa prayog nahin karte
 For example in the game of centipede, 2 / 3 of an average game is based on guessing and in dictator games people do not play regularly with Nash equilibria
 in adhyayanon ke mahatv ke sandarbh main bahes jari he
 Alternatively, some authors claim that Nash equilibria do not provide predictions for human populations, but rather explain why populations playing with Nash equilibria remain in that state
 haalaanki yah sawaal fir bhi khulaa rahata he ki aabaadiyaan us bindu tak kaise pahunchatin hai
 Some theorists have turned to evolutionary game theory to address their concerns
 ye pratimaan yaa to khilaadiyon ke liye koi taarkikta nahin maanate yaa paribaddh taarkikta maanate hai
 Despite its name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily consider natural selection in a biological sense
 vikasvaadi game theory jaivik or saath hi saanskrithik vikaas tathaa vyaktigem theory shiksha ke pratimaan donon ko shaamil karata he
 On the other hand, some scholars view game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of humans, but as a suggestion of how people should behave
 chunki kisi khel kaa ek naish santulan anya khilaadiyon kii game theory vidhiyon ke prati vyakti kii sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa nirmaan karata he, atah aisi chaal chalanaa upyukt prathit hota he, jo naish santulan kaa ek bhaag ho
 However, this experiment has also come under criticism for game theory
 sabase pehle, kuch maamalon main gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karnaa tab upyukt hota he, jab vyakti ko anya khilaadiyon dwaara bhi ek gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karne kii ummid ho
 For an example, see 2 / 3 estimate of average
 doosraa, qaidi kaa asamanjas ek anya sambhavit prati-udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Confused by the prisoner, each player trying to fulfill their selfishness brings both players in a bad situation, in which they would have stayed if they had not tried to fulfill their selfishness
 arthshaastra ke vipareet, jeevigyaan main khelon ke liye laabh kii vyakhya aksar yogyata ke sambandh main kii jaati he
 In addition, less attention has been focused on the balance of the idea of rationality and more on the equilibria that can be maintained by the evolutionary forces
 jeevigyaan main gyaat sarvshereshth santulan ko vikasvaadi sthir ranneeti ke rup main janaa jaataa he or ise sabase pehle main prastut kiya gaya tha
 Although its initial motivation did not include any mental requirement of Nash equilibrium, each ESS is a Nash equilibrium
 jeev vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog anek bhinn tathyon ko samajhane main kiya gaya he
 It was first used to explain the origin of the 1: 1 sex ratio
 ne yah suzav diya ki 1:1 ling anupaat un vyaktiyon par kaary kar rahi vikasvaadi shaktiyon kaa parinaam he, jinhen apane pautron kii sankhya ko adhiktam str tak badhaane kaa prayaas karne waalon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and ESS to explain the emergence of communication between animals
 sanket khelon or anya sampreshan khelon ke vishleshan ne pashuon ke bich sampreshan kii utpatti kii kuch jaankaree pradaan kii he
 For example, in many species of animals, in which a large number of predatory animals attack a large predator, the behavior of mass invasion appears to be an example of spontaneous organization
 kshetreeyata or ladaai ke vyavhaar kaa vishleshan karne ke liye jeev-vigyaniyon ne chuzon ke khel kaa prayog kiya he
 In a preface to the origins and theory of games, Maynard Smith writes, "incidentally, it has been found that game theory applies more to biology than to the field of economical behavior for which it was originally designed
 "
 vikasvaadi game theory kaa prayog prakruti main asangem theory prathit hone vaale anek tathyon kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 One such fact is called biological altruism
 yah ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen ek jeev aisi paddati se kaary karata hua dikhaai detaa he, jo anya jeevon ke liye laabhadaayak or swayan uske liye ahitkar hoti he
 This differs from the traditional notion of altruism, because such actions are not conscious, but appear as evolutionary adaptations to increase gross worthiness
 iske udhaaharan pishaach chamagaadadon, jo raat ke shikaar se hasil kiye gayi khun ko ugalkar apane samooh ke un sadasyon ko de dete hai, jo shikaar kar paane main asafal rahe hon, se lekar karmi madhumakhiyon, jo aaajeevan rani madhumakhi kii seva karti hai or kabhi milan nahin karatin, se lekar varvet bandaron, jo samooh ke sadasyon ko shikari ke aagaman kii chetavanee dete hai, bhale hi isse unka swayan kaa jivan khatare main pad jaye, tak main paye ja sakate hai
 All of these tasks increase a group's overall worth, but an organism has to lose its life to do so
 vikasvaadi game theory is paropkaarita kii vyakhya sambandhiyon ke chayan ke vichaar ke rup main karata he
 The philanthropists make distinctions between the beings they help and they favor their relatives
 hamiltan kaa niyam is chayan ke peeche vikasvaadi tark kii vyakhya sutara c<b*r ke dwaara karata he, jahaan paropkaaree ko laganevaali laagem theory praptakarta ko milanevaale laabh va sambhddhata ke gunank ke gunanfal se kam honi chaiye
 The greater the proximity between the two organisms, the greater the incidence of altruism as they will have many of the same genetic elements
 iskaa arth yah he ki paropkaaree jeev, is baat ko sunishchit karte hue ki uske nikat sambandhiyon ke genetic tatv aage prasaarit hote hai,, swayan kii santan ko janm dene ke vikalp kaa tyaag kar saktaa he kyonki samaan sankhya main genetic tatv aage prasaarit hue hai
 For example, the coefficient of support for a sibling is 1 / 2 because the organism shares 1 / 2 genetic element in its sibling's offspring
 is baat ko sunishchit kar lenaa ki kisi sahodar kii santanon kii paryaapt sankhya vayask hone tak jivit rahati he, paropkaaree vyakti ke liye swayan kii santan utpann karne kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar detaa he
 The coefficient values are highly dependent on the scope of the playground: for example, if the selection of those to be favored includes all genetic living objects, not just relatives, we assume that the difference between all humans is the playground
 Contains about 1% of the variation, the coefficient that was 1 / 2 in a small area becomes 0
995
 isi prakaar yadi is par vichaar kiya jaye ki genetic swaroop kii kisi soochna ke atirikt koi anya soochna samay ke saath bani rahati he, to khel kaa maidan or bada va bhed-bhav chote ho jate hai
 Game theory is beginning to play an increasingly important role in logic and computer science
 anek taarkik siddhanton kaa aadhaar khel arthvigyaan main he
 In addition, computer scientists have used games to construct many interactive calculations
 saath hi, game theory bahu-abhikarta tantron ke kshetra kaa ek saidhantik aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Separately, game theory has also played a role in the online algorithm
 vishishtatah, k-sarwar samasya, jiskaa ullekh ateet main chal-laagem theory vaale khel or nivedan-uttar khel ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 Template: Harvard citations / core Yao's theory is a game-theoretic technique to prove the lower limits of the computational complexity of randomized algorithms, and especially online algorithms
 elgorithmik game theory kaa kshetra jatilta or elgorithm kii rachana kii computer vigyaan kii avadharanaon ko game theory or aarthik siddhant ke saath sanyojit karata he
 The emergence of the Internet has led to the development of algorithms for exploring games, markets, calculative auctions, peer-to-peer mechanisms, and balances in the security and information markets
 darshanashastra main game theory ke anek upyog hai
 In response to two papers presented by Harvard citations / core, Lewis used game theory to develop a philosophical understanding of the conference
 aisa karte hue, unhone saamaanya gyaan kaa praarambhik vishleshan pradaan kiya or taal-mail sambandhi khelon main khel ke vishleshan ke liye iskaa prayog kiya
 Additionally, he first suggested that one could understand meaning in the context of hint games
 louis ke baad anek darshanikon dwaara is suzav kaa prayog kiya gaya he ,saanchaa:harvard citations / core)
 sammelnon ke khel-saidhantik Lewis ke baad, ulman margelit or bicheri ne saamaajik niyamon ke aise siddhant viksit kiye hai, jo unhen ek mishrit-uddeshy vaale khel ko ek taal-mail sambandhi khel main roopantarit karne ke parinamswaroop praapt hone vaale naish santulanon ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 Game theory also challenges philosophers to think in terms of interactive metaphysics: what similar beliefs or knowledge means to a group, and what effect this knowledge has on the social consequences of agents' interactions
 is kshetra main kaary karne vaale darshanikon main bicheri, skirms, tathaa stallnekar shaamil hai
 In ethics, some authors have attempted to follow the project of selfishness, initiated by Thomas Hobbes
 chunki qaidi kaa asamanjas naitikta or swaarth ke bich ek abhaasiya sangharsh ko prastut karata he, atah is baat kii vyakhya karnaa is pariyojna kaa ek mahatvapurn ghatak he ki swaarth ke liye sahakaarita kii aavashyaktaa kyon hoti he
 This general strategy is a component of the general social contract approach in political philosophy and see Kavka)
 anya lekhakon ne naitikta ke prati maanviya drushtikon ke udbhav tathaa is sambandh main pashuon ke vyavhaaron kii vyakhya karne ke liye vikasvaadi game theory kaa prayog karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 These authors view various games including prisoner's dilemma, reindeer hunting, and Nash bargaining games as providing explanations for the emergence of an ethics approach
 game theory ke kuch bhaagon main prayukt kuch purvanumaanon ko darshanashastra main chunauti di gai he; manovaigyanik ahambhaav kahata he ki taarkikta swaarth ko kam karti he-ek daawa, jo darshanikon ke liye bahes kaa vishay he
 a game is cooperative if players are able to make binding commitments
 udhaaharan ke liye kanoonee tantra unke liye apane vachanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak banaata he
 This is not possible in non-cooperative games
 aksar aisa mana jaataa he ki sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke bich samvaad kii anumati di jaati he, lekin gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main nahin
 This classification is rejected on the basis of two binary criteria
 khel ke do prakaaron main se, gaiyr-sahakaari khel sarvshereshth vivaranon tak paristhitiyon ke pradarshan main sakasham hote hai or sateek parinaam utpann karte hai
 Cooperative games are widely focused on sports
 in do margon ko jodne ke lakshaneey prayaas kiye gayi hai
 The so-called Nash-program has already established many cooperative conditions as non-cooperative equilibria
 sankarit khelon main sahakaari va gaiyr-sahakaari tatv hote hai
 For example, in cooperative games, players' alliances are formed, but they play in a non-cooperative style
 ek samamit khel aisa khel hota he, jisamen kisi vishisht ranneeti ke anusaar khilne kaa laabh keval anya prayukt ranneetiyon par nirbhar karata he, na ki unhen khelanewaalon par
 If the identity of the players can be changed without changing the profits from the strategies, the game is symmetrical
 saamanytah adhyayan kiye jane vaale 2 × 2 khelon main se anek samamit hote hai
 Chicken, prisoner's dilemma, and stag hunting prey are all symmetrical games
 kuch vidwaan in khelon ke udaahranon ke rup main vibhinn asamamit khelon par vichaar kar sakate hai
 However the most prevalent benefits for each of these games are symmetric
 sarvaadhik adhyayan kiye jane vaale asamamit khel ve khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy nahin hote
 For example, Ultimate Game and Dictator Game have different strategies for each player
 haalaanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki kisi khel main donon khilaadiyon ke liye ek samaan ranneetiyaan hon or fir bhi vah asamamit ho
 For example, the game depicted on the right is asymmetric despite having the same set of strategies for both players
 shunya-raashi khel sthir-raashi khelon ke vishesh udhaaharan hai, jinamein khilaadiyon dwaara kiye gayi chayan uplabdh sansadhano ko na to badhaate hai or na hi ghataate hai
 In zero-sum games, for each combination of strategies, the sum of the total profits of all players in the game is zero
 pokar kaa khel ek shunya-raashi khel kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he kyonki koi bhi khilaadi thik utani hi raqam jeetta he, jitani uske pratidwandvi haarate hai
 Other zero-sum games include coin matching and most classical board games including Go and Chess
 game theorycaron dwaara jin khelon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, unamem se adhikansh gaiyr-shunya-raashi khel hai kyonki unamem se kuch praptiyon ke sakal parinaam shunya se zyaada yaa kam hote hai
 Informally, in non-zero-sum games, the gain of one player is not necessarily associated with the loss of another player
 sthir-raashi khel chori or jue jaisi game theory vidhiyon se sambandhit hote hai, lekin us moolbhoot aarthik paristhiti se nahin, jisamen vyapaar se laabh sambhavit hote hai
 It is possible to convert any game into a zero-sum game by adding an additional fake player, whose losses compensate the player's net profit
 samakalik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadi apni chaal ek saath chalate hai, yaa yadi ve ek saath chaal nahin chalate, to baad vaale khilaadi pehle khilne vaale khilaadiyon kii chaal se anbhigya hote hai 
 Sequential games are games in which players playing later have some knowledge of the preceding moves
 yah aavashyak rup se purvavarti khilaadiyon kii prayek game theory vidhi kii purna jaankaree nahin hoti; yah bahut thodi jaankaree ho sakati he
 For example, it is possible that a player knows that a preceding player did not perform a specific move, while he does not know which of the other moves the first player had made, among other available moves
 samakalik or aanukramik khelon main mukhya antar upar charchit vibhinn pradarshnon main sammilit kiye gayi hai
 Often, the general form is used to represent synchronized games and the broad form is used to represent sequential games; However, technically this is not a strict rule
 aanukramik khelon kaa ek mahatvapurn up-samucchy purna jaankaree se milakar bana hota he
 a game is full of information if all players are aware of the moves previously made by other players
 is prakaar, keval aanukramik khel hi purna jaankaree vaale ho sakate hai kyonki samakalik khelon main prayek khilaadi anya khilaadiyon kii chaalon ko nahin jaanata
 Most games studied in game theory are incomplete-information games, however, some interesting examples of full-information games, including the Ultimate Game and the Shatapada Game, are available
 purna-jaankaree vaale khelon main shatranj, go, mankala or arima shaamil hai
 Complete information is often understood as all information, which is a similar concept
 samast jaankaree ke liye prayek khilaadi ko anya khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon va praptiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak he, lekin unki game theory vidhiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak nahin he
 Games studied by economists and real-world players generally end up with a limited number of moves
 shuddh ganitagya utane baadhya nahin hote or samucchy siddhantkaar vishishtatah un khelon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jo chaalon kii aseemit sankhya tak jari rahete hai or unamem vijeta un sabhi chaalon kii samaapti ke baad tak gyaat nahin hota
 Generally, the focus is not on what is the best method to play such games, but only on whether a player has a winning strategy
 
 The existence of such strategies has important implications in descriptive set theory for skillfully designed games
 game theory kaa adhikansh bhaag simit, asatat khelon se sambandhit hota he, jinamein khilaadiyon, chaalon, ghatnaon, parinaamon aadi kii sankhya simit hoti he
 However many concepts can be extended
 satat khel apane khilaadiyon ko ek satat ranneeti samucchy main se kisi ranneeti kaa chayan karne kii anumati dete hai
 For example, the cornet competition is typically designed in such a way that players' strategies are any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities
 antareey khel, jaise continyus percyut and evejan khel satat khel hai
 Individual game theory decision problems are sometimes considered "one-player games"
 haalaanki ye sthitiyaan khel saidhantik nahin hai, lekin unki rachana nirnay siddhant ke niyamon ke antargem theory unheen upkarnon main se anek kaa prayog karke kii jaati he
 Only when two or more players have a problem does the game become theoretical
 aksar betaratib bhang se khilne vaala koi khilaadi joda jaataa he, jo "avasarwaadi chaalen" chalata he, jinhen "swaabhaavik chaalon" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In a two-player game, this player is not considered a third player, but instead plays a role of dice where necessary in the game
 khilaadiyon kii aseemit sankhya vaale khelon ko aksar n-vyakti khel kaha jaataa he
 These are the games that have to be developed to develop rules for any other game, goal or subject game

 No general game theoretic analysis was followed until Antony Augustine Cornut published the Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses in 1838
 is kaary main cornt ne ek dwayadhikaar par vichaar kiya he or ek samaadhaan prastut kiya he, jo naish santulan kaa ek simit sanskaran he
 Although Cornett's analysis is more general than Waldegrave's analysis, game theory had virtually no existence as a unique field before John von Neumann published a series of papers in 1928
 haalaanki francisi ganitagya emily borol ne khelon par kuch praarambhik kaary kiya, lekin won newman ko game theory kaa avishkaarak hone kaa shrey uchit rup se diya ja saktaa he
 Von Neumann was an intelligent mathematician whose work spread widely from aggregation theory to his calculations, which were the key to the development of both molecules and hydrogen bombs, and ultimately to the task of developing computers

 In 1950, the prisoner's confusion appeared and an experiment was carried out on the game at RAND Corporation
 isi samay ke aas-paas, jon naish ne khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon kii paraspar sangem theory ta ke liye ek maapdand viksit kiya, jise naish santulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jo won newman or morgenstem dwaara prastaavit maapdand kii tulana main khelon kii ek vyapak shrenee par lagu hota he
 This equilibrium is sufficiently general that it allows analysis of non-cooperative games in addition to cooperative games

 Additionally, it was during this time that game theory was first applied in philosophy and political science

 In 1967, John Harsanyi developed the concepts of complete information and Bayesian games

 In the 1970s, game theory was deeply applied in biology, primarily as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy

 Then Lord Parashuram ji was happy on Bagdalia Muni and asked him for a beautiful journey, then Bagdalia Muni said that you give us the womb of the same woman

 In January 1822, there was a proposal to put 'a replica of the Parthenon of Athens on the Calton Hill as a national monument' at a total cost of £ 42,000
 The proposal received positive support from many of the elite of Edinburgh, Such as Sir Walter Scott, Lord Henry Cockburn and Lord Francis Jeffrey in July 1822 for contributors to the National Monument of Scotland Shri Shahi Sangat was constituted by the Parliamentary subordinate

 aay kaa paripatr pravaah arthshaastra kaa ek model he
 This model refers to the transactions in the major markets of the economy as the flow of money and goods and services between economic agents
 ek close circuit main paise or maal ke aadan-pradaan kaa pravaah dikhaaya jaataa he jisame yah do aarthik charo kaa pravaah vipareet disha main chalata hai
 Circular flow analysis is the basis of national accounts, and hence, macroeconomics
 paripatr pravaah kaa vichaar pehle se hi richard cantilon ke karyo main maujud the
 François Cusne developed this model whose tableau was present in "économique"
 karl marks ke "prajnan yojanaon" ke dusre bhaag me kyusane ke vichaaro ko or viksit rup main bataaya gaya he
 Its integral parts are - Criticism of Political Economy, John Maynard Keynes's "general Theory", Interest and Money, etc
 aay kaa paripatr pravaah ek pramukh avadharana he arthvyavastha kii behatar samaj ke liye
 It depicts a simple economy that is only skewed by businesses and individuals and can be considered a "circular flow diagram"
 yahan vyavsaay "vyapaar kshetra" av vyakti "gharelu kshetra" ke antargat aate he
 In this simple economy, labor is provided from the domestic sector which enables the production of traded goods and services
 is shram ke badale main, gharelu kshetra ko vyapaar kshetra se mazdooree milti he
 On the other hand, goods and services are provided to the domestic sector from the business sector which is the income of the business sector
 paripatr pravaah aarekh arthvyavastha me ho rahe maal or sevaaon ke utpaadan or is utpaadan se utpann aay ke bich ke paraspar nirbharta ko darshata he
 The circular flow also shows the similarity between "income earned from production" and "value of goods and production services"
 kul arthvyavastha is akalan kii tulana main bahut adhik jatil he
 An economy is not only about exchange of economic activities between individuals and businesses, but also between federal, state and local governments and residents of the rest of the world
 iske alaava arthvyavastha ke is saral udhaaharan main aarthik gatividhi ke anya pahalu hai nahin dikhaaya gaya he jaise puunji nivesh, vittiya puunji, or achal sampattiyon kaa sanchay karne ke liye in pravaah kaa yogadan
 One of the most pervasive ideas of circular flow was explained in the work of the 18th-century irish-french economist Richard Cantillon, inspired by the works of earlier economists such as William Patty
 cantilon ne is avadharana kaa varnan apni 1730 ke niabandh- "ese on da nachar off tred in janeral" ke paath 11-13 main kiya he
 The economist Thornton concurs with Cantillon's views and states that - "cantilon ke paripatr pravaah model me krishi utpaadan kaa vitaran sampatti ke maalik, kisaanon or mazdooron ke bich hota he
 Although property owners are "independent", the model reflects a mutual dependency between all classes, which Adam Smith has described in his work - "the Theory of Moral Sentiments", as "the invisible hand"
 cantilon ne aarthik agenton ke kam se kam paanch prakaar bataye he: sampatti ke maalik, kisaan, udhyami, majdoor or karigar - jaisaa unke paripatr pravaah ke aarekh main dikhaaya gaya he
 Cusne further developed these concepts
 unhone sabase pehle is avadharana kaa chithran apane "tableau économique" me kiya
 He believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth
 apitu, kiraaya, vetan, or kharid ke rup main krishi adhishesh hi vaastavik aarthik movers the
 There are two reasons for this - 1) sabhi saamaajik virgon me aay ke pravaah me niyaman, baadha utpann karti he or natijatan, aarthik vikaas me baadha utpann karti he
 2) Tax should be removed from the productive class like farmers and landlords like Anwar class should be taxed more because their excellent way of life distorts the income flow
 kyusane ke model me teen aarthik agent shaamil he - "malikana" varg me keval jameendaaron shaamil he, "utpaadak" varg me sabhi krishi majdoor shaamil he or "anutpaadak" varg karigar or vyapaariy se bana he
 The flow of production and income between these three classes begins with the proprietary class as they own the land, and they purchase from the other two classes
 marxvaadi arthshaastra main aarthik prajnan, un aavartak prakriyaaon ko sanderbhit karata he jiske dwaara praarambhik aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye aavashyak sharten lagaataar phir se banaaya jaataa he
 Economic reproduction includes material production and distribution of goods and services, the "trade" of goods and services, and consumption of goods and services
 marks ne kyusane ke "rajdhani, paisa, or vastuon ke sanchalan ke model" ke mul antardrushti ko viksit kiya
 In the second category of his book "das Capital", he showed how the reproduction process can run through the circulation of money in a capitalist society
 marks "saral prajnan" or "vistaar prajnan" ke bich bhed karte he
 There is no economic growth in "simple breeding" and "expansion breeding" produces more than what is necessary to maintain the economy, which makes economic growth possible
 isame fark yah he ki pehle prakaar main adhishesh maalik dwaara upbhog vyay ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he or duusare prakaar main, adhishesh utpaadan kii prakriya main punarnivesh kiya jaataa he
 "the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money", published in 1933 by John Maynard Keynes, was an important development in circular flow theory
 keens ke sahaayak richard stone ne is avadharana ko or viksit kiya jo ab antarrashtriya str par istamaal kiya jaataa he
 In 1933 Frank Knight in his "the Economic Organization" first conceived the circular flow model of modern income
 aay kaa buniyadi paripatr pravaah main, yaa do sector aay model ke paripatr pravaah me santulan kii sthiti aisi sthiti he jisame aay kaa str, vyay or utpaadan me koi badlaav nahi dikhaai padti he
 meaning: vaai = i = he This means that buyers expenditures become income for sellers
 vikreta phir is aay ko utpaadan ke kaarak jaise shram, puunji or kachche maal kharidne me kharch karte he taaki in karko se aage kaa utpaadan kiya jaay
 In this way, the factors reach their owners
 yahan kaarak maalik gharelu kshetra he
 Factor owners re-spend this income on goods and production services that are made in the business sector, and so this income flows like a circular flow
 aay model kii yah buniyadi paripatr pravaah chah manyatae hai: 1) Domestic Sector and Business Sector: There are only two sectors of the economy
 2) pariwaron maal or sevaaon kii khapat me apni aay kharch karte hai
 There is no savings in this
 3) companiyon dwaara utpaadit sabhi nirgam pariwaron dwaara unki vyay ke madhyam se kharida jaataa he
 4) There is no financial sector in it
 5) isamen koi sarkari kshetra nahin he
 6) There is no foreign territory
 isame teen kshetra he - gharelu kshetra, vyapaar kshetra ev sarkari kshetra
 It will study the circular flow of income in these areas, except in the rest of the world, ie in a closed economy
 dhan kii pravaah yahan gharelu kshetra ev vyapaar kshetra se sarkari kshetra me karon ke rup main hoti he
 Income from the government sector goes to the business and domestic sector in the form of payment and landed and transfer payments of government purchases of goods and services
 har bhugtan yah kii ek raseed he jisase ek arthvyavastha ke vyay, kul aay ke samaan rahata he or is paripatr pravaah ko antaheen banaata he
 a modern monetary economy consists of four sectors: 1) gharelu kshetra 2) Business Area 3) sarkari kshetra 4) Rest of the world region uparokt kshetron main se prayek kshetra anya tino kshetron se maal or sevaaon ke evaj main kuch bhugtan praapt karata he
 "paiso" facilitates such exchange smoothly
 in chaar kshetron main se prayek ke avshesh bachat ke rup main puunji bazaar aata he jo companiyon or sarkari kshetra main nivesh kiya he
 Technically, the circular flow will continue as long as debt and borrowing are equal
 yah kaam arthvyavastha ke vittiya sansthaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the five-sector model, the economy is divided into five sectors: 1) gharelu kshetra 2) Business Area 3) vittiya kshetra: bank or non-bank bichauliyon jo udhaar lete or dete he 4) Government Sector: Economic activities of local, state and federal governments 5) baaki duniya kshetra: ek khuli arthvyavastha se ek band arthvyavastha me model badal detii he The five-sector model is a more realistic representation of the economy
 do sector model ke vipareet, jahaan chah manyatae he, paanch sector paripatr pravaah sabhi chah manyataon ko rad kar detaa hai
 Since the first assumption is canceled, three more fields are included
 arthvyavastha ke paanch sector model main vahaan "likaij" or "injection" he
 -> When the domestic sector and business sector save part of their income, this saved portion is called "leakage"
 yah bachat, kar bhugtan, or aayaat ke rup main hota he
 Leakage reduces the flow of income
 ->"injection" pravaah main aay ko jodatii he
 When the domestic sector and the business sector borrow savings, they are called "injections"
 injection aay ke pravaah ko badhaate hai
 These injections are in the form of investment, government expenditure, and export
 aay kaa paripatr pravaah anishchit kaal ke liye jari rahegaa jab tak likai or injection samaan ho
 Financial institutions or capital markets play the role of middlemen
 iskaa matlab yah he ki vyaktiyon ko kaam se praapt aay or unhe beche gayi maal or sevaayen, injection yaa likaij nahin kehalaate hai, kaaran koi paisa, pravaah main pesh nahin kiya ja rahaa he or naahi koi paisa, pravaah se baahar le jaaya ja rahaa he
 Leakage and injection may occur in the financial sector, government sector and foreign sector
 1) "real" flo gharelu kshetra or vyapaar kshetra ke bich vastuon or sevaaon ke aadan-pradaan he jabaki "mani" flo do kshetron ke bich paiso kaa aadan-pradaan he
 2) Under Real Flow, the domestic sector gives raw materials, land, labor and capital to the business sector, instead of which the business sector provides the finished goods and services to the domestic sector
 mani flo ke antargat vyapaar kshetra gharelu kshetra ko mazdooree or vetan, kiraaya, byaaj aadi ke rup main paarishramik detaa he
 The three stages of circular flow are the creation of production, consumption expenditure and income
 yah teen ek arthvyavastha ke antaheen buniyadi aarthik gatividhiyon hai
 Production gives rise to income, income gives rise to demand for goods and services, such demand gives rise to expenditure and expenditure leads to overproduction
 yah puri prakriya aay kaa paripatr pravaah ke liye aadhaar kaa rup hai
 a book titled "A General Approach to Macroeconomic Policy" identifies four possible areas of importance - 1) rashtriya aay kaa maapan 2) Knowledge of interdependence of economic activities 3) aarthik gatividhiyon kii antaheen prakruti kaa gyaan 4) leakage and injection yah uttari dilli kaa awasaiya evam audyogic kshetra he
 In the history of south-east Asia, the board was a concentrated state system
 mandal kaa shabdic arth 'vrutt' hota he
 The Mandala doctrine is a model of Rajashakti as opposed to the unified political power of the present era
 kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya he
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apeksha mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations

 Political, ideological or religious violence perpetrated by non-state factors is also considered as a category of terrorism

 In many countries the acts of terrorism are legally criminal acts committed for other purposes and "terrorism" is distinguished by statute, see Definition of terrorism for specific definitions

 In these definitions there are many that do not identify the possibility of the legitimate use of violence against an invasion by civilians in a occupied country, and thus will label all resistance movements as terrorist groups
 Others of violence Distinguishing between legal and illegal use

 Terrorists also attack national symbols to show their power and shake the foundations that they are opposed to the country or society
 Increasing the validity of the time given to this may negatively affect the legitimacy of a government, terrorist organization and / or Ideology behind a terrorist action

 Terrorism is not a political strategy contrary to writing letters or protests, that is used by activists when they believe that any other means of change they wish would have such effect
 is badlaav ko itani buree tarah se asafalataa he ki nagarikon kii maut se bhi badtar ek parinaam ke rup main dekha jaataa he vaanchit he
 This often happens, where there is terrorism and religion between each other
 jab ek raajnneetik sangharsh ek yaa "dharmik brahmadia ke dhaanche main" ekikrut he is tarah ke ek pushtaini mathrubhumi yaa israel or jerushlem jaise pavitra sthal ke niyantran se adhik ke rup main sangharsh, raajnneetik lakshya main asafal aadhyatmik vifaltaa, ke saath baraabar ho jaataa he jo, ke liye atyant patibaddh, apni khud kii mrityu yaa mrityu se bhi badtar he nirdosh nagarikon kii
 Intentional targeting of non-combatants - it is common that the specific nature of terrorism is rooted in its deliberate and specific selection of civilians as direct targets
 In particular, criminal intent when infants, children, mothers and the elderly
 , Is shown to have been slaughtered or injured and put in the path of evil
 bahut samay kii, aatankwaad ke shikaar logon kyonki ve dhamkiyon rahe hai, par nahin lakshith kar rahe hai kyonki ve vishisht "pratikon, upkaran, jaanwaron yaa bhrasht praani" duniya ke ek vishesh drishy main taai he ki aatankwaadi ne kaha ki adhikari ho rahe hai

 When an enemy is identified as a warrior, the term terrorism is rarely used

 Unlawful or Unreasonable - Some officials add a criterion of the definition of terrorism to a "legitimate" government-authorized distinction between demeanor or impersonal action to make it legitimate and other actors, including those individuals and small groups
 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 From this point of view "terrorism" and "terrorist" carry a strong negative connotation
 These terms are often used to denounce violence or threats of violence by some actors as labeled as political, indiscriminate, immoral or Inappropriate
 Those "terrorists" labels are rarely so and usually use other euphemistic words or words specific to their situation, such as: separatist, independent Fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, as the paramilitaries, guerrilla rebel ,, ,, jihadi or mujaheddin, identify himself or en: fedayeen, or meaning of any word in other languages similar

 The relationship between domestic terrorism and democracy is complex
 anusandhan ki is tarah ke aatankwaad ko sabase jatiyon main madhyavarti raajnneetik swatantraaa ke saath saamaanya he or pataa chalata he ki kam se kam aatankwaad ke saath is desh desh ke sabase loktantric desh desh ke hai
 However, one study showed that this general rule of suicide terrorism may be an exception
 saboot aatankwaad ke is vishesh vidhi ke sambandh main he ki har aadhunik aatmahatya abhiyaan ek loktantr-raajnneetik swatantraaa kaa ek kaaphi degree ke saath ek rajya lakshith kiya he pataa chalata he
 The study showed that concessions have been awarded to terrorists during the 80s and 90s for suicide attacks, increasing their frequency
 gaiyr main "aatankwaad"-loktantr ke kuch udhaaharan francisco franco ke antargat he, shining path peru main alberto phujimori ke antargat he, kurdistan workars party, jab turki dakshin africa main sainya netaaon or ANC ne is par raaj kiya ETA spain main shaamil hai
 Democracies such as the United States, Israel, and the Philippines have also experienced domestic terrorism
 jabaki ek loktantric raashtra anya shasno, is tarah ke ek rajya ke bheetar aatankwaad ke ek adhinium kii tulana main ucch naitik jameen kii bhaavana kaa daawa may naagarik swatantraaaon espousing ek kathith duvidha kaaran ho saktaa he: ki kya or iske naagarik swatantraaa banaae rakhane ke liye is prakaar se nipatane main nishprabhavi mana ja rahaa jokhim samasya; yaa vaikalpik rup se or iske naagarik swatantraaaon ko pratibandhit karne ke liye is prakaar naagarik swatantraaaon kaa samarthan karne ke apane daawey jokhim
uthaaya is duvidha, kuch saamaajik siddhanton, bahut acha abhinay aatankwaadi khel sakate hai; arthath, rajya delegitimize ko samaapt hogi
 Acts of terrorism can be run by individuals, groups, or states
 kuch paribhaashaayen, gupt yaa arddh gupt rajya abhinaytaon ke liye bhi yuddh ke ek rajya ke dhaanche ke baahar aatankwaadi vaardaaton se baahar le janaa may anusaar
haalanki, aatankwaad kaa sabase saamaanya chhavi he ki yah chote or gupt koshikaon dwaara, ucch ek vishesh kaaran seva karne ke liye or sabase ghaatak aapareshnon ke ke rup main haal ke dinon, aise main kai prerit 9 / 11, landan bhumigat bam visphot, or kiya jaataa he 2002 ke bali bam visphot kii yojana banaai rahe the or kareeb ek gut, kareebi doston, parivaar ke sadasyon or anya majboot saamaajik network se bana dwaara chalaaya
 These groups benefited from the free flow of information and skillful telecommunications to achieve success where others had failed

 Others, such as Roderichik Hinderi, have sought to consider profiles of this propaganda strategy in use by terrorists
 ek rajya ke vitt poshan yaa ek aatankwaadi sanghathan madad dwaara aatankwaad ko pryojit kar sakate hai
 Considerations as acts by states of violence to which states do not meet or sponsor terrorism vary widely
 jab rajyon samoohon kuch aatankwaadi hone dwaara vichaar ke liye dhan uplabdh karaate hai, ve kabhi kabhi hi jaise unhen sweekaar karte hai
 The concept of state terrorism is controversial
 Wars during military action by states are generally not considered terrorism, even when they involve significant civilian casualties
 adhyaksh ne sanyukt raashtra counter ke aatankwaad samiti kaa maananaa he ki is samiti is vishay par 12 antarrashtriya samjhauton ke prati jaagruk kiya gaya hai or unamem se koi bhi nahin he jo ek antarrashtriya kanoonee avadharana nahin thi rajya aatankwaad, ko bheja

 " rajya aatankwaad sarkari agenton yaa balon dwaara aatankwaadi vaardaaton kaa ullekh karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya he
 This involves the use of state resources by employing foreign policies of a state, such as performing acts of state terrorism considered directly by using its military
 Professor of Political Science, Michael Stohl, of London, Germany Examples of bombing and US nuclear destruction include cites Hiroshima during World War II
 He said the use of terror tactics is more common in international relations that the state has been and remains a more likely possibility of terrorism than employer insurgents argue within the international system
 "ve bhi adaalat main talab pehali hadtaal "sankat prabandhan main parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa prayog kar ke garbhit dhamkee ke saath is kaa jo" bandhak duniya dhaaran ek rup he, ke rup main balpurvak dipolomacy ke "aatank kaa ek udhaaharan ke rup main vikalp", '
 "ve kehete hai ki aatankwaad ke sansthagat rup he ki vishwa yuddh daaloonga nimnlikhit jagah le lee parivartan kaa ek parinaam ke rup main hui bahes he
 In this analysis, the presence of state terrorism as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction and shaped the rapidly growing accepted form of behavior of the state to lead such Legitimizing violent behavior of

 pratikriyaaon ko aatankwaad ke daayre main vyapak rahe hai
 They can include re-alignments of the fundamental values of the political spectrum and reassessments
 The word terrorism, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors, has a narrower connotation
 pratikriyaaon ke vishisht prakaar main shaamil hai: Media risk is the primary goal of taking them out of terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media
 kuch herpher or shoshan ko media ke liye is par vichaar karen
 Others, expressed by a view of itself, consider terrorism to be a symptom of a highly controlled mass media, which would otherwise not give voice to alternative viewpoints because Paul Watson who "filled you in any other way" i cannot find your information that the controlled media is responsible for terrorism, "he said
 paul watasan kaa sanghathan samudr Shepherd swayan kiya gaya "branded heparisthitiki aatankwaadi ", haalanki yah daawa he ki koi bhi hataahat kaaran nahin he
 This mass media will often censor organizations further involved in terrorism to discourage further terrorism

 It was said in this act that on 15 August 1947, two autonomous investments will be made called the Dominion of India and Pakistan and the British Government will hand over power to them

 In this development, mainly the province of Bengal in British India was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal state of India and similarly Punjab province of British India was divided into Punjab province of western Pakistan and Punjab state of India
 isi dauraan british bharat main se ceylone or burma ko bhi alag kiya gaya, lekin ise bharat ke vibhaajan main nahin shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the partition of Pakistan in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh are also not counted in this development

 But Pakistan's power conversion rituals were performed in Karachi on 14 August so that the last British Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, both in Karachi and New Delhi could participate in the rituals
 isliye pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat main 15 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 Crores of people were affected by the partition of India

45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 In a speech by the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal at the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, for the first time raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war

 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer

 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here

 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries
 pakistan main bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko balaat beghar kar diya gaya
 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted

 According to the displaced census of 1951, 72,26,000 Muslims left India after partition and went to Pakistan and 72,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs left Pakistan
 isamen se 78 pratishat sthanantaran pashchim main, mukhyatya punjab main hua
 The transfer of power to India and Pakistan in August 1947 was the first significant step by Britain towards ending colonial rule, with far-reaching consequences for its international power

 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions
