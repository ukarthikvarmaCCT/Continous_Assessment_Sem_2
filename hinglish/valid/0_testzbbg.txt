 The ancient and early period of English literature can be divided into several dimensions
 yah vibhaajan keval adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye kiya jaataa he; isse angreji sahitya pravaah ko akshunnata par koi prabhaav nahin padana chahie
 English literature of the ancient era has three distinct dimensions: anglo-saxon; From Norman Vijay to Chaucer; From Chaucer to the English Renaissance period
 england main basane ke samay anglo-sackson kabeeley barbarta or sabhyataa ke bich kii sthiti main the
 Apart from hunting, sea and war, he also had experience of agricultural life
 apane saath ve apane veeron kii kathaayen bhi lete aae
 These stories were common in all the tribes of the Teuton caste
 ve deshon kii simaaon main nahin bandhi thim
 It was from these languages that English literature began in the form of poetry in the seventh century
 isliye dablyoo
pi
 kar ke shabdon main anglo-sackson sahitya puraani duniya kaa sahitya he
 But by this time the anglo-saxon people had become Christians
 in bhashaaon ke rachayita bhi aam taur se purohit hua karte the
 Therefore, valor, valor, compassion, service etc
 were also attributed to the valor and valor described in these languages
 anglo-sackson kavita kaa shuddh dharmavishyak ansh bhi in gaathaon ke rup se prabhavit he There is also an exaggeration of style with valor in these gathas
 anglo-sackson bhashaa kaaphi angadh thi
 Poets used to make it very artificial in the stories
 chand ke anuprasic aadhaar ke kaaran bharti ke shabdon kaa aa janaa anivaary tha
 There is a stiffness in music or rhythm due to the abundance of vocal consonants
 vishyon or style ko sankeernanta ke bich angreji kavita kaa vikaas asambhav tha
 It was rejuvenated after the Norman conquest that many scholars have called it inappropriate to add hereditary relations to this and subsequent poetry
 duusari ore angreji gadhy main, jiskaa udai kavita ke baad hua, vikaas kii kramik or atoot parampara he
 The language of the Christian world was Latin and the famous prose writer of this period, Beed, wrote in this language
 anglo-sackson main gadhy kaa prarambh alfred ke jamaane main laathini ke anuwaadon tathaa upadeshon or vaartaon kii rachana se hua
 The prose was composed for education and knowledge
 isliye isamen anglo-sackson kavita kii kritrimata or anya shailigat dosha nahin hai
 Their language was much closer to the local language
 anglo-sackson kavita kii tarah baad vaale yugon main uskaa sambandh viched karnaa asambhav he
 But the entire literature of this era lacks elegance chosar purv madhyadeshiy angreji kaal na keval england main hi balki europe ke anya deshon main bhi france ke saahitiyik netritv kaa kaal he
 From the 12th to the 14th century, France gave ideas, culture, imagination, stories and poetry to these countries
 dharmayudhon ke is yug main saare isai deshon ko bauddhik ekta sthapit hui
 This is an era of development of the feudal system and the central beliefs of valor and valor
 nari ke prati prem or poojabhaav, saahas or parakram, dharm ke liye pranotsarg, asaaayon ke prati karunaa, vinay aadi isai niton ke jivan ke abhinn ang maane gaye
 At the same time, the Barans of France composed ancient might stories and love songs, and Latino, Tuton, Kelty, Ayeri, Carney, and French songs were widely used
 france kii gaathaon main karm kii, britain kii gaathaon main bhavukta or shringaar kii ore laathini gaathaon main in sabhi tatwon kii pradhanta thi
 In literature, softness, melody and songs were emphasized
 is yug main angreji bhashaa ne apana rup sanvaara
 He came to terms in Romance languages, especially French, he adopted rhymes in poetry instead of Karnakatu epigraphic verses, his subjects broadened
 sankshep main, usne chosar yug kii purvapithika taiyaar kii
 Prose requires a rougher and more stable form of language
 puraani angreji ke rup main vighatan ke kaaran is yug kaa gadhy puraane gadhy jaisaa santulit or swasth nahin he
 But in spite of the morphological instability, the religious and romantic prose of this era developed the tradition of anglo-saxon prose from the point of view
 chosar ne is yug kii kavy parampara ko aadhunik yug se samanvit kiya
 He took elegance from French poetry and 'modern perception' from contemporary poetry in Italy
 kavita main yatharthwaad ko janm dekar usne angreji kavita ko europe kii kavita se bhi aage kar diya
 Therefore, to understand it, it is necessary to know the literary movement of medieval France and modern Italy instead of the old anglo-saxon world and its poetry
 uske baad tathaa elizabeth yug se pehle koi bada kavi nahin hua
 In this era, the form of prose flourished through translations and original works of Latin and French literature
 lekhakon ne laathini or french gadhy kii vaakya rachana or lay ko angreji rup main utaara
 In 1350, the English received the honor of the official language, and by breaking the circle of religion, the prose came to the common people
 gadhy ne vigyaan, darshan, dharm, itihaas, raajnneeti, katha or yatra varnan ke dwaara vividhta praapt kii
 By the end of the 15th century, famous prose makers such as Mandeville, Chaucer, Wickliffe, Fartescue, Caxton, and Mallory built the foundations of English prose
 15veen shatabdi angreji naatak kaa shishav kaal he
 With the need of sermon and virtue education, development of cities and rise of powerful categories, the drama emerged from the ramparts of the church and came to Janpath
 in naatakon kaa sambandh bible kii kathaon, kumari meri or santon kii jivaniyon, sadachaar or manoranjak prahasanon se he
 These plays, living in a narrow area of religion and uncouth, can be called ancestors of the great plays of the Elizabethan era
 vichaaron or kalpana ke aviraam manthan, vidhaon main prayogon kii vividhta or krititv kii praudhata kii drushti se angreji punarjagran kaal angreji sahitya kaa swarna yug he
 Culturally, this era is an era of materialism against semioticism, contemplative individualism against medieval feudal curbs, science struggle against superstition
 punarjagran ne england ko italy, france, spain or germany ke kaaphi baad andolit kiya
 The period from 1500 to 1580 is the development of humanism and the assimilation of the literary ideals of ancient Greece and Italy
 lekin 1580 or 1660 ke bich kavita, naatak or gadhy main adbhut utkarsh hua
 The great personality prior to 1580 belongs only to Chaucer
 1580 ke baad spencer, shakespeare, bekan or milton kii mahaan pratibhaaon se kuch hi neeche str par naatak main marlo, ben johnson or bebstor, gadhy main hookar, barten or thomas brown, kavita main ben johnson or dan hai

 The years between the end of 1660 and 1700 AD are the germination of rationalism
 parantu punarjagran kaa prabhaav shesh rahata he; uske antim or mahaan kavi milton ke mahakavy 1660 ke baad hi likhe gaye; swayan dryden main maanavtaavaadi pravritiyaan hai
 But a new twist is in front
 buddhivaad ke atirikt yah charles dwitiya ke punarrajarohan ke baad french ritivaad ke udai kaa yug he
 Influenced by French formalism and court values of 'love and respect', the drama of this era is lifeless in feeling and expression
 duusari ore madhyavargeey yatharthwaad se prabhavit vikarli or congrove ke saamaajik prahasan apni sajivta, parishkrut kintu paini bhashaa or tikhe vyangy main adwitiya he
 The epithet of lower middle class morality and ideal against the mechanical rationalism and immorality of the upper middle class is John Wilden's metaphorical novel, 'the Pilgrim's Process'
 aalochana main ritivaad kaa prabhaav shakespeare ke romani naatakon ke viruddh rimer kii aalochana se spasht he
 The most important criticism of that era is Dryden's play-poetic essay based on the coherence of humanist freedom and formalism
 varnan main yathartwaadee gadhy ke vikaas main samuel pepiz kii diary kii bhoomika bhi smaraneey he
 In a nutshell, there is cleanliness and balance in the prose and verse of these last years of the 17th century, but overall it is the mahta-viral-yuga
 ritivaadee yug – yah shatabdi tark or reeti kaa utkarshkaal he
 Leibniz, Dakart, and Newton developed rationalism and mechanical materialism through the method of work-cause
 unke anusaar sristi or manushya niyamanushasit the
 This approach had little room for demonstrating personal interest
 is yug par haaavee french reetikaron ne bhi saahitiyik prakriya ko reetibaddh kar diya tha
 This era placed religion in place and emphasized on the ordinary social life of man, politics, practical ethics etc
 isliye iskaa sahitya kaam kii baat kaa sahitya he
 This era preferred to say it in clear, straightforward, measured, sharp words
 kavita main yah pope or praayar ke vyangy kaa yug he
 The 18th century is called the prose era because of the primacy of logic
 sachmuch yah aadhunik gadhy ke vikaas kaa yug he
 Ethics of middle class conscious of their power in party struggles, coffeehouses and clubs gave birth to journalism in this era
 sahitya or patrakarita ke samanvay main edison, steel, difo, swift, fielding, smallett, johnson or goldsmith kii style kaa nirmaan kiya
 This led to the release of the paranoia of poetry, firm in the rules of composition, the flow of prose of short sentences containing the subjectivity of conversation
 jehar main buje tir kii tarah swift ke gadhy ko chhodkar adhikansh lekhakon main vyangy kii udaar style he
 For the first time in criticism, Chaucer, Spencer, Shakespeare, Milton, etc
 were tested as a test of conscience
 reeti or tark kii paddati romentic sahityakaron ke prati anudaar ho jaaya karti thi, lekin aaj bhi edison, pope or johnson kii aalochanaon kaa mahatv he
 In terms of the stylism of prose, this era produced stylists such as Chesterfield and Walpole in fine letterwriting, Gibbon in memoirs, Fanny Burney and Bosewell, Gibbon in history, Berkeley and Hume in philosophy, Burke in politics and Butler in religion
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke vikaas ne aadhunik angreji upanyaason kii chaar prasiddh dhuriyaan deen : difo, richardsan, folding or smallet
 The same era in the novel is also of Swift, Stern and Goldsmith
 angreji katha sahitya ko yatharthwaad ne hi, goldsmith or sheridan ke madhyam se, kritrim bhavukta ke daldal se ubaara
 But this era was not untouched even by the emotional morality of the middle class
 iske spasht lakshan bhavuk kamedi or stern, richardsan ityadi ke upanyaason main maujuud he
 In the last years of the century, the ground of romantic poetry was ready
 blake or burns is yug kii sthirataa main aandhi kii tarah aae
 Romantic Era or Rhetorical Era - After the Renaissance, in the Romantic Era one again hears a rousing and hilarious tone of one's soul
 praaia: romentic sahitya ko reetiyug kii pratikriya kaha jaataa he or uski visheshtaon kaa is prakaar ullekh kiya jaataa he- tark kii jagah sahaj geetimay anubhuti or kalpana; abhivyakti main saadhaaraneekaran kii jagah vyakti nishthata; nagaron ke kritrim jivan se prakruti or ekant kii ore mudana; sthulata kii jagah sookshm adarsh or swapn; madhyayug or pracheen itihaas kaa aakarshan; manushya main aasthaa; lalit bhashaa kii jagah saadhaaran bhashaa kaa prayog; ityadi
 Certainly many of these elements are found in Romani poets, but to understand their great cultural role it is necessary to keep in mind the rise of populist ideas in 19th century Germany, France, Spain, Italy, England, Russia and Poland
 
 is ubhaar ne saamaajik or saahitiyik roodhiyon ke viruddh vyakti swatantry kaa naaraa lagaaya
 The Russian and French revolutions were his central inspirations
 england main 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh ke kavi- vardsworth, colorij, shelli, keats or byran — isi nae unmesh ke kavi hai
 Prose also received the same euphoria of sensation, imagination and expression in Lamb, Hunt and Hazlitt's essays, Keats's love letters, Scott's novels, De Quincey's 'confessions of an Opium Eater'
 aalochana main colorij, lamb, hazlit or di quinci ne reeti se mukt hokar shakespeare or uske charitron kii aatma kaa udghaatan kiya
 But the nature of imposing personality hindered the development of the play
 victoria ke yug main jahaan ek ore janavaadee vichaaron or vigyaan kaa atoot vikaas ho rahaa tha, vahaan abhijaat varg krantibhiru bhi ho uthaa
 Therefore, if there is healthy social consciousness among some litterateurs in this era, then there are also trends of despair, doubt, uneasiness, coherence, artism, austere optimism
 vyaktvaad shatabdi ke antim dashak tak pahonchte-pahonchte cathalik dharm, rahasyavaad, atmarati yaa atmpeedan main is tarah lipt ho gaya ki is dashak ko khal dashak bhi kehete hai
 The populist, realist and scientific ideology was represented by Morris in poetry, Ruskin in prose and the Branthe sisters, Thackray, Dickens, Kingsley, Reid, George Elliott, Tomas Hardy, Butler, etc
 in the novel

 This is the central fact of literature of this century
 is shatabdi ke sahitya ko samajhane ke liye uske vichaaron, bhaavon or roopon ko prabhavit karne vaali shaktiyon ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 Those powers are Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Kirkgaard, Freud and Marx, Ibsen, Chekhov, French expressionist and symbolist, Gorky, Sartre and Elliot; Fear of two wars and the third, Fascism, Russia's socialist revolution, the establishment of socialism in many countries and the freedom struggle of the subjugated countries; The immense possibilities of social development due to the victory of science over nature and the problem of association with the individual

 At the same time, there were also poets who continued to express the human faith of the era in spite of their personal mental complications

 The langar tradition began in the 15th century
 shri guru nanak dev ji ke upadeshon se vaani main, jo ekta or bhaichaare kaa sandesh miltaa he, usase spasht he ki lungar pratha shri guru nanak dev ji ke samay shuru hui thi
 While staying with Bala Mardana, wherever he went, he used to sit and eat on the ground

 The example of Bhai Lalo, in which the example of milk is given in ordinary bread, the simple bread of honesty is as pure as milk, in which there is a bounty of honesty

 In some constellations the number of strings is so high that the number of letters of the Greek alphabet falls short for them
 aise taron ke namakaran ke liye taramandal ke purv latin akshar tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par sankhyaayein likh dete hai
 Some stars are famous for being over-illuminated and their names can be known without reference to the constellations, such as Lubbhak, Magha, Chitra etc

 The difference between photographic and visual parameters on yellow sensitive plates with yellow color filters is called character indicator
 isse taron kaa taap gyaat hota he
 The intensity of light is measured by accepting and multiplying the light on current photographic cells

 Accurate knowledge of radiance helps us to know the distances of stars and many physical substances
 bahut se taron kaa nijee prakaash bahut adhik he, kintu atyaadhik duuri par sthir hone ke kaaran unka drishy kantimaan adhik dikhalaai padataa he
 The true scale can be known only if they are located at equal distance from the subsurface
 samast taron ko 10 parsek kii duuri par kalpit karke gyaat kiye gaye kantimaan ko nirpeksh kantimaan kehete hai
 If we know the visible radius of the star and its distance, then we can know the absolute radius from the following formula: nirpekshkantimaan drishyakantimaan 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri, parsekon main he
 Opposite: If we know the absolute record, then we can also know the distances of stars
 surya kaa nirpeksh kantimaan 4
7 he
 The radius of a star relative to the sun is called relative radiance
 isamen surya kii kanti 1 maan lee jaati he
 With this type of study, we study the energy obtained by stars, which helps in the study of their physical conditions
 na8na In the perfectly clear sky, we do not see more than 3,200 stars of vision aids
 chunki ham akaash ke keval aadhe hisse ko hi dekh pate hai at: chakshudrishy taron kii sankhya 6,500 ke lagbhag he
 In these 1,5 kantimaan se adhik chamkile 20 taare 50 stars up to 2 radiant 3 kantimaan tak chamkile 150 taare hai 4 stars up to 500 radiant tara 5 kantimaan tak chamkile 1500 taare hai The rest of the image is of the sixth record of stars

 To find the true speed and movement of a star, we divide its speed into two parts
 drushtisutra par lamb disha kii gati ke koniya maan ko taare kii nijee gati kehete hai
 Personal speeds of stars are less
 unhen gyaat karne ke liye hamen bahut doorvarti kaalon main liye gaye taron ke photographon kii tulana kerani padati he
 The stars that are closest to us move back and forth relative to distant stars
 is koniya maan ko kaal ke antaraal se bhaag dene par nijee gati gyaat ho jaati hai
 The asterisks of the direction of this angular sight is called the radial velocity
 traigy veg jaanane ke liye ham varnakramdarshi kii sahaayta se taare kaa varnakram le lete hai
 If the spectral lines move towards the blue end, then we know with the help of the Doppler principle that the star is coming towards us and, if the spectral lines are towards the red end, it is moving away from us
 rekhaon kaa sthanantaran unke tragyveg kaa anukramanupati hota he
 Benard has known the personal speed of the star of a dashing radius of the Ophiucus planetarium at 10

 nijee gati kaa gyaan tarapunjon ke adhyayan main sahaayak hota he tathaa isse ham yah bhi jaan jate hai ki adhik neeli gati ke taare apekshaakrit hamaare nikat hai
 To understand the radius of the velocity relative to the Sun, we also have to take into account the speed of the Earth
 nijee gati tathaa traigy veg ke gyaan se bal-samaantar-chaturbhuj ke siddhant dwaara vaastavik gati tathaa uski disha gyaat ho jaati he
 Trigonometric methods are used to find distances of stars
 hamase ati sameep tara bhi itani duuri par he ki yadi ham prithvi ke vyas ko aadhaar maanakar uski dishaao ko dekhen to ve samaantar prathit hotin hai, arthath taare kaa lamban shunya hi aata he
 Therefore, to find the parallax of stars, we need a larger base
 at: prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas ko ham aadhaar banaate hai
 If we observe a star's direction six months after its perforation, we get the basis of the diameter of the earth's orbit
 is prakaar ke vedh se samipsth taare duurastha taron ke saapeksh thodaa dik parivartan dikhalaate hai
 While extracting this, we also have to consider the effect of the personal motion of the star
 to bhi yah itnaa kam he ki nikatatam taare kaa lamban 76 he
 If a star has a parallax of 1, it is 2,06,265 times the radius of the Earth's orbit from Earth
 is duuri ko ek parsek kehete he
 Another unit used to measure distance is the light year
 prakaash kaa veg 1,86,000 mile prati second he
 The distance that light travels in a year with this velocity is called a light year, this distance is about 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 miles

 The following are other methods of finding the perpendiculars of stars: in vargikarnon kaa nijee mahatv he or inase hamen taron ke vishleshan main vishesh sahaayta milti he
 The following is a brief introduction to these classifications: surya hamaara nikatatam tara he, jiskaa ham bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kar sakate hai
 Most stars are available to us by studying the elements of stars, which were born around the same time as our Sun
 ye taare taap, aakaar tathaa kanti ke avaroh anukram main hai
 This class is called the main sequence
 isamen atyaadhik taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar se lagbhag 10 guna tathaa nimna taap ke taron kaa aakaar surya ke aakaar kaa lagbhag dashamansh hoga
 The Sun is a medium-sized star of this sequence, whose mass and temperature are below average
 mukhya anukram ke vakr main upar kii ore taare atyant viral hai
 Most of the stars in this sequence are smaller than the Sun and warmer
 inamen uplabdh tatwon kii maatra surya jaisi he
 From the study of the Sun, we have two more main classes of stars in addition to this class: there are three main differences of the Danvar stars
 daanavaakar, tathaa vamanakaar taare
 The three main differences of donor stars - demonetisation, extreme donor and donor
 atidanavaakar taare aakaar main bahut vishaal hote hai
 For example, the diameter of Jyestha is about 300 times the diameter of the Sun
 daanavaakar taron main khagaashv ke dwitiya beta pigasi kaa vyas surya ke vyas se 170 guna tathaa brahmahruday kaa, surya ke vyas se, 12 guna he
 The sublingual stars lie between the main sequence and the star of the demon class
 vamanakaar taron ke bhi vaaman, upwaman, lalarang vaaman tathaa shwet-vaaman bhed hai
 White left-wing stars have special significance in these sections
 inaki visheshta yah he ki inaki dravyamatra madhya shrenee kii tathaa kanti kam hoti he, kintu inkaa aakaar bahut chota tathaa inkaa ghanatv atyant adhik hota he
 Of the many stars we see, there are a large number of stars, which are members of our Galaxy
 hamaari gallexi apane main ek vishwa he
 Its shape is spiral
 bahut se anya taravishwa bhi hai, jinka aakaar sarpil he
 To study their composition and shape, we get help from the study of some special types of stars of our Akashganga
 in taron ke gukhyat: do varg hai
 Some stars are always available in the spiral arms of the Galaxy and others are found near the nucleus of the Galaxy
 inamen pratham varg ke taare hamaare surya ke nikat padosi hai tathaa duusare varg ke taare surya se dur hai
 Walter Wade named the stars of the first class as the first star series, or population first, and the stars of the second class named the second star series, or population second
 in donon prakaar ke taravargo ke varnakram-kanti-vakron main bhinnata hoti he
 The very bright stars of the first star are blue and have an absolute radius of 7 or 8, while the bright stars of the second star are red and have an absolute radius of 3 or more
 pratham tarashrenee ke taron main taron kii antarvarti gas tathaa dhul atyadhik maatra main he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke taron main yah atyant kam maatra main he
 The study of these stars gives us not only to determine the spiral arms and nuclei of galaxies, but they also help us to study the origin and evolution of stars
 taron kii dravyamatra ke anu, jo mulavastha main udasin rahete hai, taap main uttarotar vruddhi hone ke kaaran ynikrut hokar apane rin vidyutkanon ko adhikadhik maatra main khone lagate hai
 Due to this effect, there are variations in the bright and black lines formed in the spectrum of such stars
 duusare shabdon main rekhaayen taron ke prakaash vikeern karanevaale anuon ke taap kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii dyotak hai
 Thus, their main 10 distinctions have been made by the study of the spectrum of stars, which are expressed by the capital letters O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and s of the Roman script
 chunki varnakram vargeekaran kaa taap se sambandh he, at: ek hi varg ke taara ke taap main uttarottar hraas bataane ki liye o varnakram ke taron ke liye o ke baad angraji varnmaala ke chote e se i tak ke varna rakh die jate hai tathaa o, oba aadi
 To express a similar intent, the digits from b to m are numbered from 0 to 9, followed by their indicator letters
 ye ynikrut helium vaale taare hai
 The lines of ionized helium and double triple ionized oxygen and nitrogen are found in their spectrum

 o The number of known stars of the spectrum is not more than hundred, in which most cannot be seen with naked eyes
 is varg ke teen taare, gamma belorum oe,, jita papsis oe tathaa jitaorin, oi5 chakshu drukshya hai
 These are neutral helium stars
 inkaa prishthiya taap 25,000° se 12,000° sein0 tak rahata he
 Although this heat is unable to ionize helium, ionized oxygen lines are available in its spectrum

 Automatic moving stars can be placed in three categories: vibratory moving, explosive moving and other moving stars
 inamen kuch taron kaa aavartan kaal ek din se bhi kam hota he
 Such stars belong to the RR Lira class
 kuch kaa aavartan kaal 1 se lekar 50 din tak kaa he
 Such stars are stars of the Cepheid class
 kuch taron kaa aavartankaal 100 se lekar 1000 din tak kaa he
 These are called long-term stars
 is varg ke taare laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Some stars are semi-regular, their cycle ranges from 40 to 150 days
 ye taare bhi laal rang ke daanavaakar taare hote hai
 Among these, RR Lyra and Cepheid stars are very important
 aar lira taron kaa yah naam isliye padaa ki ye sab gunon main lira taramandal main varnit us chal taare ke samaan hai, jiskaa naam aar aar lira rakhaa gaya
 It should not be understood from the name that such stars occur only in Lyra constellations, but stars in this category are everywhere in our galaxy and other constellations etc

 Even when the period of rotation of the stars of RR Lira class does not differ in their absolute value
 iskaa arth yah he ki kisi ek taraguchh tarapranali main aar aar lira taare hon, to ve samaan nirpeksh kantimaan ke honge or yah samaan nirpeksh kantimaan lagbhag shunya ke tulya he
 In such a state, their distance from knowledge of their visual radiance can be known by the following formula
 nirpeksh kantimaan = drishy kantimaan + 5 - 5 laghuganak duuri He got this name because his nature is similar to Delta Cepheus, or Charuth Kapish
 chaturth kapish sefiod varg kaa sarvaadhik chamkila tara he, jise chakshu se dekha ja saktaa he
 The periodicity of cephaid wires ranges from a few days to more than 45 days
 hamaari gallexi ke sefiid taron main 7 din kaa aavartankaal praaia: hota he
 The biggest feature of cepheid stars is to be consistent with the periodic-radius-associative rule
 iskaa arth he ki sefiid taron ke aavartan kaal main jaise jaise vruddhi hoti he vaise vaise unke nirpeksh kantimaan main vruddhi hoti jaati he
 This relationship is very important
 isaki sahaayta se sefiid taron kaa nirpeksh kantimaan jaanakar purv sutara dwaara inaki duuri gyaat kii ja sakati he
 With the help of cepheid stars, the distances of galaxies and starfish are determined

 These types of stars are called Navtara
 1918 i0 ke ekvilla tarapunj ke navtare kii chamak chaar hi din ke bheetar pehle se chalis hajaar guna bad gai thi
 Other famous navataras are: Navtara of the Percuss planetarium, 1925 Victorian Navtara and Navtara of the Hercules planetarium of 1934
 jo navtare visphot ke baad atyant asaadhaaran rup se chamkile ho jate he, unhe atinavtara kehete hai
 In 1885, the supernatural of the Andromeda nebula radiated so much light in six days that the sun would be able to radiate as much light in 10 million years

 Spherical galaxies have relatively more stars
 ye praaia: ghundle se dikhaai dete hai
 They are seen only through visionaries
 omenga centari tathaa 47 tukane panchal kantimaan ke, chakshudrishy, golakaar taraguchh kaa population dwitiya se sambandh he
 Of course, they have knowledge of the stages of development of stars
 in taron main vidyaman aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taron kii sahaayta se gucchh kii duuri gyaat kii jaati he
 Their study helps a lot in studying the appearance of the Galaxy
 adhikash taare dohare, athwa bahusankhyak, hote hai, inamen kuch taron kii jodiyon main paraspar kuch bhi sambandh nahin hota, kintu ve ati sameep isliye dikhaai dete hai ki ve hamaari drushtirekha kii ore sthit hai
 Such stars are called double stars
 aise taare kam hai
 Most stars are actually with one or more stars
 do taare, jo paraspar aakarshan se ek nishichat prakaar ke dirdhavritakar maarg main bhraman karte hai, tara-yugma kehalaate hai
 Having determined that a star is actually a pair, we can know many things about its relationship, because its, or its companion star's, motion follows a broader gravitational law
 yugma taron kii gati tathaa dravyamatra ko nishchit rup se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are mainly three types of pairing: visual, receptive and spectral
 drishy yugmataron kii kaksha kaa gyaan karne ke liye unki duuri tathaa sthiti kone kaa vegh karnaa padataa he
 Most visual pairings have a long rotation period, which requires hundreds of years of weights to detect
 isiilie yadhyapi 25,000 se bhi adhik drishy yugmatare gyaat ho chuke hai, tathaapi 200 se adhik kii kaksha kaa gyaan abhi tak nahin ho sakaa he
 The orbit of the eclipse of the receptive pair often tends to tilt a little in the direction of our line of sight, so that one star covers the other completely or partially, and the light of one star is not visible to us
 isse yugmatare kii pahchaan ho jaati hai, kyonki saamaanya sthiti main is taare kaa jitna prakaash rahata he grahan ke samay pehle kii apeksha kam ho jaataa he
 These eclipses occur from the appointed time
 is tarah ke taron main beta parasyus, arthath algul, ati prasiddh he
 In the normal state, its record is 2
2, leaving 3
4 at the time of eclipse
 grahan ke pashchaat iskaa kantimaan pun: 2
2 ho jaataa he
 The level of the orbit of some of the couriers does not go near the Earth, so we cannot see the position of its eclipse
 kintu uske varnakram kii rekhaon ke parivartan se hamen pataa chal jaataa he ki yah tara kabhi hamaari ore aata tathaa kabhi hamase dur jaataa he, jisase spasht he ki yah kisi adrishy taare ke chaaron ore dhooma rahaa he
 Such stars have a shorter rotation period for spectral pairs
 lagbhag 309 varnakrameey taron kii kakshaayen gyaat ho chuki hai
 The sizes of stars are often known by three methods: nirpeksh kantimaan tathaa taap se, From the eclipse of the receptive couriers and vyatikaranmaapi se
 The first method is based on Planck's following formula: drishy nirpeksh kantimaan Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 Where r = radius of the star
 grahauakari taare ke grahan ke kaal ke vegh se uski kaksha ke saapeksh uski trigya gyaat ho jaati he
 The angular diameter of the star is known by the telemetrometer and by knowing its distance, its simple linear diameter is also known
 taron ke vyas ke aadhaar par hi unke daanavaakar tathaa vamanakaar aadi naam pade hai
 Direct methods for determining the mass of stars are obtained by studying the speed of association of pair wires
 vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kii sahaayta se in taron kii dravyamatra gyaat kii jaati he
 The drafts of any Vamana star have not been available less than the tithe of the Sun's Drayaamatra, and stars of more than 10 times Drayaamatra from the Sun are also rare
 kisi taare kaa ghanatv = dravyamatra / aaytan
 Thus, it is seen that the density of the Danvar wires is very low and the left side wires are very low
 jyeshta jaise vishaal taare kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa 480 guna he, to bhi isaki dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke 20 gune se adhik nahin
 As a result, its density is less than 
 xxrep 7 0 2 of the Sun's density
 yah saadhaaran hawa ke ghanatv se bhi bahut kam he
 The density of the Svetavaman star Cerium B, whose radius is 
034 of the radius of the Sun and 86 of the mass of the Sun, is so high that one cubic inch of its mass would weigh one ton
 saamanyata photometer kii sahaayta se, taron ke prakaash ke vibhinn rangon ke ghanatv kii prayogshaala main pehle se gyaat tapon ke rangon ke ghanatv se tulana kar, taron ke prishth kaa taap gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But the best method to determine this is spectral analysis of their light
 isi ke aadhaar par taron kaa varnakrameey vargeekaran he, jo vastut: unke taap kaa dyotak he
 Stars derive their energy from nuclear reactions
 taron ke nabhik ke taap ke kaaran taron ke hydrogen ke parmaanu nabhikriya se helium ke parmaanuon main parivartit hote rahete hai
 As a result, excessive heat is produced in the stars, which they radiate as light
 bahut adhik urja utpann karne ke liye inhen atyalp vidyutkan khone padate hai
 Therefore, there is no significant decrease in their volume and their life also becomes millions of years
 taron ke vayumandal kaa adhyayan bhi varnakram kii rekhaon se kiya jaataa he
 We have come to know from the study of the atmosphere of the Sun that it contains excessive amounts of hydrogen
 doosraa sthaan helium kaa he
 Other elements are in small quantities, however magnesium and oxygen atoms certainly exist
 gyaat rasinic tatwon main 61 tatv surya ke vayumandal main pahachaane ja chuke hai
 The atmosphere of most stars is like the Sun, however the atmosphere of all stars is not exactly the same
 inamen carbon tathaa oxigen kii matraaon main antar he
 The basic elements of stars are known by the study of their spectral lines
 prayogshla main vibhinn mul tatwon ke varnakram le liye jate hai tathaa taron ke varnakramon kaa unase milan karke taron main upalabadh mul tatwon kii pahchaan kii jaati he
 This type of study has shown that the average stars have about 70 Hydrogen, 28 Helium, 1
5 Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Niran and 0
5 iron group and other heavy elements
 baari tatv population pratham ke taron main lagbhag 3 hote hai tathaa population dwitiya waalon main 1 se bhi kam
 The stars originate from the interstellar gas and dust particles of the stars
 gas ke badalon ke vidyutkan saamanyatya udasin avasthaa main rahete hai, kintu jab koi atyadhik ushn tara inke sameep se jaataa he to ye ynikrut hokar gatisheel ho jate hai tathaa inamen ek nabhik ban jaataa he, jo aasapaas ke gas tathaa dhul ke dravyakanon ko aakrisht karke vishalaroop dhaaran karne lagata he
 When the temperature of the nucleus increases due to speed and shrinkage, the nuclear reaction starts in them, which causes them to radiate light energy and show us the appearance of new stars
 vibhinn prakaar ke taron kii urja vikeernata ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki population dwitiya ke taare bahut pracheen hai tathaa papulation pratham ke taare apekshaakrit baad main nirmit hai
 The life of stars refers to their luminous life
 taron ke prakaash kaa aadhaar he, unka hydrogen kaa bhandar, jisaki nabhikeey abhikriya se ve ooshmaa urja praapt karte hai
 The stars which are very bright, naturally consume more of their hydrogen reserves and convert them to helium more quickly
 yadhyapi hydrogen kaa bhandar samaapt hone par bhi taare sankochan dwaara apni ooshmaa urja ko bahut varshon tak praapt kar sakate hai, tathaapi unke jivan kaa mukhya aadhaar unke hydrogen ke upbheg par hi nirbhar rahata he
 The stars that appear bright enough have a lifetime of about 109 years and the main sequence of blurred stars has a life of about 1013 years
 surya kaa jeevankaal lagbhag 1010 varsh hai
 Our desire to unravel the mystery of the starry world around us is very old
 taron ke adhyayan se hamane vishwa ko gallexi jaisi anek tarapranaliyon purna paaya he
 We have learned so much by studying the spectrum of stars by moving the lines towards red color that our world is expanding
 tathaapi apane simit sadhano ke kaaran ham vishwa ke vaastavik rup ko nahin jaan sake hai
 To what extent does our world expand, to what extent can the spreading world, how is the curvature of the world, and what is the radius of curvature? sabase bada mount palomar veghashaala kaa, 200 inch vyas kaa hell doordarshee ek arab parsek, athwa lagbhag 20, xxwrep 2 00, 00 mile ke lagbhag, duriyon ke drishy tak hi pahunch paaya he

 Therefore, now our attention has shifted to radio telescopes

 Despite scientific facts, this aerial view has been important in worldwide beliefs since time immemorial
 puraakathaon, pracheen puranic tathaa ardhetihaasik vrutanton or lokkathaon se is ghatana ke vishay main prachlit vividh manyataon kaa pataa chalata he
 This unique phenomenon of the sky is most concerned with astrology as a result of predictive belief, in which its fruit is constituted
 varahamihir krit brihatsamhita main kaha gaya he ki ve log jo swarg main apane sampurna sukarmon kaa fal bhoga chukte hai, ulka ke rup main gir padate hai
 According to predictive beliefs, a meteor is somewhere auspicious and elsewhere auspicious
 kintu adhiktar bhavishya main honevaali kisi durghatana ke daivi sanket ke rup se yah ashubhasuchak hi samajha jaataa he
 According to Pliny, if the magistrate of the Sparta, the city of Sparta, ancient Greece, in 1200 BC, after the reign of eight years, meteorites were seen in a lunarless clean night, he would take the throne as a divine sign of the ruler's sin
 nakshatron or taron ke sambandh main yah vilakshan andhvishwaas saamaanya rup se asia, europe, america or africa ke vistrut kshetron main prachlit he ki akaash ke prayek taare se dharti ke alag alag manushya yaa manushyon ke jivan tathaa bhagya niyantrit hote hai
 This belief is the basis for the interpretation of the future life of a person in the horoscope based on the imagination of the form, nature, location and motion of the constellations, which has been given a mathematical or scientific method
 bhagya se inkaa sambandh ukt bhubhag kii abhivyakti main prachlit 'tara' or 'nakshatra' shabd ke arthon main sugamawapurvak khoja ja saktaa he
 Similarly, the color and sharpness of a star also represents the nature and fate of a human being on the earth; Also, his breakdown means the person dead
 pune jatiyon kii purakatha ke anusaar jab sabhi taare tut chukegein tab maanviya sristi kaa ant ho jayega
 Somewhere its meaning is also a sign of a new birth, but this auspicious position of Tarapat is very rare in the faith world
 ganit sanketan ve chinh athwa sanket hai jo kisi ganitiya kriya athwa sambandh ko vyakt karne main, kisi ganiti raashi kii prakruti athwa gun ko darshane main, athvaganit main praaia: prayukt honevaale vaakyansh, vishisht sankhya yaa ganitiya raashi ko nirdisht karne ke liye prayukt kiye jate hai
 Thus the sign of money in a + b specifies that b is added to A; The sign of unevenness in a <B indicates the relation of a to be smaller than b In F, the sign indicates that the function f is a uniform incremental function
 ganitiya sanketan kii sahaayta se ganit ke tark sankshipt rup se likhe ja sakate hai or is prakaar yah ganitiya chintan main sahaayak he
 The reader can easily understand complex relationships with the help of subtle and rational language

 In solid state physics, the band gap is the range of electron energy in which no electron state exists
 ise 'urja interval' bhi kehete hai
 In the graph of the electronic bond structure of solids, the difference of energy between the upper limit of the connective band and the lower limit of the conduction band is called band gap

 Due to family feud, Narayan Lal left his ancestral village with his wife Vichitra Devi and two sons - Muralidhar and Kalyanmal
 unke gaanv chhodane ke baad barbai main keval unke do bhai - amaan singh va samaan singh hi rah gayi jinke vanshaj aaj bhi usee gaanv main rahete hai
 Today, a statue of Ram Prasad Bismil has been installed by the Madhya Pradesh government in a park in Barabai village
 vahiin 'barbai' gram ko 'saansad adarsh gram yojana 'ke tahat bhi viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, a temple of Bismil in Morena and 'amar Shaheed Pt Ramprasad Bismil Museum' has also been built at the district headquarters, which provides information about the immortal martyrs of Chambal region and historical and ancient sites of the region
 kaalaantar main yah parivaar uttar pradesh ke aitihaasik nagar shahjahanpur aa gaya
 Narayan Lal got a job at an attar shop located near the gate of Munnuganj in Shahjahanpur for just three rupees a month
 itane kam paise main unke parivaar kaa guzaaraa nahin hota tha
 Bismil's grandmother, Vichitra Devi, started grinding grains to get her husband's hand
 yah silsilaa lagbhag do-teen varshon tak chalata rahaa
 Local people often addressed him as "pandit ji" due to his ethics, honesty and religious tendencies
 isse unhen ek laabh yah bhi hota tha ki prayek teej - tyohaar par daan - dakshina va bhojan aadi ghar main aa jaaya karata
 Meanwhile, Narayan Lal got a job in a school with the help of local residents for seven rupees monthly
 kuch samay pashchaat unhone yah naukari bhi chhod di or rejgaari bechney kaa kaarobaar shuru kar diya
 With this, they started earning five-seven daily

 After marriage, Muralidhar got a job in Shahjahanpur municipality at a monthly salary of Rs 15
 kintu unhen yah naukari pasand nahin aayi
 a few days later, he quit his job and started selling stamp paper in the court

 "both the parents were of Leo zodiac and the child also looked like a lion-cub, so astrologers thought very carefully and suggested the name of Libra sign
 mata-pita donon hi ram ke aradhak the atah balak kaa naam ramprasad rakhaa gaya
 Mother Moolmati always said that she wanted a son like Rama
 balak ko ghar main sabhi log pyaar se ram kahkar hi pukaarte the
 Before the birth of Ramprasad, his mother had lost a son, so the use of witchcraft was also taken
 ek khargosh laayaa gaya or navjaat shishu ke upar se utaar kar aangan main chhod diya gaya
 The rabbit made two or four rounds of the courtyard and died instantly
 iskaa ullekh ram prasad bismil ne apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 Muralidhar had a total of 9 children, including five daughters and four sons
 aage chalakar do putriyon evam do putron kaa bhi dehant ho gaya
 From childhood, special attention was paid to the education of Ramprasad
 uskaa man khilne main adhik kintu padhane main kam lagata tha
 Because of this his father used to beat him a lot, but mother always used to explain with love that "son Ram! This is a very bad thing, don't do it
" " is pyaar bhari sikh kaa uske man par kahin na kahin prabhaav avashya padataa
 His father first made the letter sense of Hindi, but neither did he learn to read an owl from u nor showed it by writing
 un dinon hindi kii varnmaala main u se ullu hi padhaayaa jaataa tha
 He was opposed to this and in return also ate his father's body
 haar kar use urdu ke skool main bhartee kara diya gaya
 Perhaps this natural quality can make Ramprasad a revolutionary
 lagbhag 14 varsh kii aayu main ramprasad ko apane pita kii sandukchi se rupee churaane kii lat pad gayi
 With the stolen money, he started reading by buying novels etc
 and also got used to smoking cigarettes and offering cannabis
 kul milakar rupee - chori kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa or ramprasad ab urdu ke premuras se paripurna upanyaason va gajalon kii pustaken padhane kaa aadi ho gaya tha
 Incidentally one day Ramprasad was caught stealing because of cannabis being drunk
 khub pitayee hui, upanyaas va anya kitaaben faad daali gayin lekin rupee churaane kii aadat nahin chhuti
 Later, when he understood a little, only then could he be free from this badness
 ramprasad ne urdu middle kii pariksha main uteern na hone par angreji padhanaa prarambh kiya
 At the same time, a priest of the neighborhood got Ramprasad knowledge of the method of worship
 pujari ek sulajhe hue vidwaan vyakti the
 His personality also had an impact on Ramprasad's life
 pujari ke upadeshon ke kaaran ramprasad puja-paath ke saath brahmacharya kaa paalan karne laga
 Ramprasad also started exercising after seeing the priest
 kishoravastha kii jitani bhi kubhaavnaayen evam buree aadaten man main thim ve bhi chhot gayin
 Cigarette smoking did not stop
 parantu vah bhi kuch dinon baad vidhyalay ke ek sahpaathee sushilchandra sen kii satsangati se chhot gayi
 After giving up cigarettes, Ramprasad's mind started studying
 bahut sheeghra hi vah angreji ke paanchaven darze main aa gaye
 There was an unexpected change in Ramprasad
 sharir sundar va balishtha ho gaya tha
 Time was spent in regular worship
 isi dauraan vah mandir main aane vaale munshi indrajit se uskaa sampark hua
 Munshi Indrajit told Ramprasad about the Arya Samaj and gave the book Satyarth Prakash written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 satyarth prakaash ke gambheer adhyayan se ramprasad ke jivan par ascharyajanak prabhaav padaa
 When Ramprasad was an eighth grade student at Government School Shahjahanpur, then by chance, Swami Somdev came to the Arya Samaj Bhavan
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko swamiji kii seva main niyukt kar diya
 It was here that changes in both the condition and direction of his life began
 ek ore satyarth prakaash kaa gambheer adhyayan va duusari ore swami somdev ke saath raajnneetik vishyon par khuli charchaa se unke man main desh-prem kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 At the Congress session of 1916, when Ramprasad took out the procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire Lucknow city, while disguising the order of the late Pt
 adhiveshan ke dauraan unka parichay keshav baliram headgavar, somdev sharma va mukundilal aadi se hua
 Later these same Somdev Sharma along with some Siddhagopal Shukla also published a book from the Nagari Sahitya Library, Kanpur titled - History of American Independence
 yah pustak babu ganeshprasad ke prabandh se kurmi press, lakhanu main san 1916 main prakashit hui thi
 Ramprasad published this book from his mother with two hundred rupees in two times
 iskaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main kiya he
 This book was confiscated as soon as it was printed and later when the Kakori case was prosecuted, this book was presented as evidence
 ab yah pustak sampadit karke sarfaroshi kii tamanna naamak granthavali ke bhaag-teen main sankalit kii ja chuki he or teen murti bhawan pustkaalay, nai-dilli sahit kai anya pustakaalayon main dekhi ja sakati he
 On hearing the news of the hanging of Bhai Parmanand in 1915, Ramprasad had pledged to destroy the British Empire, a book had come out in 1916, some young men had joined him, they had also received the blessings of Swami Somdev
 ek sanghathan unhone pan gendaalal dikshit ke maargdarshan main matruvedi ke naam se khud khadaa kar liya tha
 a commercial and a pledge were also published on behalf of this organization
 dal ke liye dhan ekatra karne ke uddeshy se ramprasad ne, jo ab tak 'bismil' ke naam se prasiddh ho chuke the, june 1918 main do tathaa sitambar 1918 main ek - kul milakar teen dakaiti bhi daaleen, jisase police satark hokar in yuvakon kii khoj main jagah-jagah chaape daal rahi thi
 In the Congress session held in front of the Red Fort in Delhi from 26 to 31 December 1918, the youth of this organization started selling books as they screamed that the police raided but all the books were saved due to Bismil's understanding
 pandit gendaalal dikshit kaa janm yamuna kinare sthit may gaanv main hua tha
 He was a teacher in the DAV school of Auraiya, a famous town in Etawah district
 deshbhakti kaa junun savaar hua to shivaji samiti ke naam se ek sanstha bana lee or hathiyaar ekatra karne shuru kar diye
 He was caught bringing weapons to Agra
 kile main kaid the vahaan se police ko chakma dekar rafuchakkar ho gayi
 After the merger of Bismil's maternal institution with the Shivaji Committee, the two worked together
 ek baar pun: pakade gayi, police peeche padi thi, bhaag kar dilli chale gayi jahaan unka praanant hua
 Bismil has given a very touching description of Pandit Gendalal ji in his autobiography
 mainpuri shadyantra main shahjahanpur se 6 yuvak shaamil hue the jinke leader ramprasad bismil the kintu ve police ke haath nahin aaye, tatkaal faraar ho gayi
 On 1 November 1919, Magistrate b s Chris pronounced the Mainpuri conspiracy
 jin-jin ko sajaayen huin unamem mukundilal ke alaava sabhi ko farvari 1920 main aam maafee ke elaan main chhod diya gaya
 Bismil remained underground for the entire 2 years
 unke dal ke hi kuch saathiyon ne shahjahanpur main jaakar yah afvaah failaa di ki bhai ramprasad to police kii goli se maare gayi jabaki sachai yah thi ki ve police muthbhed ke dauraan yamuna main chalaang lagaakar pani ke andar hi andar yogabhyas kii shakti se tairte hue milon dur aage jaakar nadi se baahar nikle or jahaan aajkal greater noida aabaad ho chukaa he vahaan ke nirjan bihadon main chale gayi
 There used to be only acacia trees in those days; And the man did not appear anywhere in the desert
 ram prasad bismil ne yahan ke ek chote se gaanv rampur jaagir main sharan lee or kai maheene yahan ke nirjan jangalon main ghoomte hue gaanv ke gujaron kii gaay bhens charaayi
 He has described this very interestingly in the second volume of his autobiography: Swadesh Prem
 yaheen rahakar unhone apana krantikari upanyaas bolshevikon kii karatuut likhaa
 In fact, this novel is originally a Hindi-translation of the book nihilist-rahasya written in Bangla language, whose language and style are both very interesting
 aravind ghosh kii ek ati uttam bangla pustak yogic saadhan kaa hindi - anuwaad bhi unhone bhumigat rahete hue hi kiya tha
 In those days, the land on the banks of Yamuna was considered safe to escape from the police, so Bismil made full use of that safe place
 vartmaan samay main yah gaanv chunki greater noida ke beta van sector ke antargat aata he at: uttar pradesh sarkaar ne rampur jaagir gaanv ke kshetra main aane vaali van vibhaag kii arakshit bhoomi par unki smriti main amar shahid pan ram prasad bismil udyaan viksit kar diya he jisaki dekharekh greater noida prashasan ke vitt-poshan se pradesh kaa van vibhaag karata he
 a feature of 'bismil' was also that they did not stay at any place for long
 kuch din rampur jaagir main rahakar apni sagi bahan shastri devi ke gaanv kosma jila mainpuri main bhi rahe
 Interestingly, even his own sister could not recognize him
 kosma se chalakar bah pahunche
 After a few days, then from Pinhat, Agra, went to his grandfather's village Barabai in the princely state of Gwalior
 unhone vahaan kisaan ke bhes main rahakar kuch dinon hal bhi chalaaya
 While living in exile, he translated the English book The Grandmother of Russian Revolution published in 1918 in Hindi
 unke sabhi saathiyon ko yah pustak bahut pasand aayi
 He named this book Catharine

 In January 1923, wealthy people like Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das formed a Swaraj Party
 navayuvakon ne tadarth party ke rup main revolutionari party kaa elaan kar diya
 In the special Congress session of Delhi held in September 1923, the disgruntled youths decided that they too would start interfering in politics by fixing their party's name and constitution etc
 Otherwise the loot system would dominate in the name of democracy in the country

 The well-known revolutionary Lala Hardayal, who was working in those days to strategize to free India from abroad, was in contact with Ram Prasad Bismil since the time of Swami Somdev

 Due to the difficulty of collecting funds for the party, the method of revolutionaries of Ireland was adopted and the first robbery was committed by the party in Bamrauli on 25 December 1924, which was efficiently led by Bismil

 Ram Prasad Bismil, in the 4-page pamphlet "the Revolutionary", published by the revolutionary party from an anonymous place on 1 January 1925 and distributed to all major places throughout India between 28 and 31 January 1925, under the pseudonym Vijay Kumar While disclosing in writing in writing the party's ideology, it was declared in clear terms that what kind of change in the governance system of this country's revolutionary Want to run and what can they do for it? Not only this, while mocking Gandhi's policies, he also asked why the person who calls himself spiritual is afraid to talk openly to the British
 He had given an open call to all the youth of India to join the revolutionary party by advising such pseudo-mahatma not to fall under the influence of the British

 The infamous Hindi poetry of this paper is now also available on Hindi Wikisource

 Incidentally, Shachindra Nath Sanyal was arrested in Bankura when he was going to post this manifesto to a colleague

 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it
 party ke kaary hetu dhan kii aavashyaktaa pehle bhi thi kintu ab to or bhi adhik bad gayi thi
 Seeing that money was not received from anywhere, he committed two political dacoities on 7 March 1925 in Bichpuri and on 24 May 1925 in Dwarkapur
 parantu unhen unamem kuch vishesh dhan praapt nahin ho sakaa
 In these two robberies, one person was killed on the spot
 isse bismil kii aatma ko apaar ksht hua
 Finally, he made sure that he would now only loot the state treasury, not to rob the house of any of the nobles of India

 In addition to the pistols, all of them had four German-made Mauser pistols, with a butt in the butt that looked like a small automatic rifle and caused fear in the front

 In those days, these mausers were known like today's A-47 rifles

 The CID, after a serious investigation, confirmed to the government that the Kakori train robbery is a planned conspiracy by the revolutionaries
 police ne kakori kand ke sambandh main jaankaree dene va shadyantr main shaamil kisi bhi vyakti ko giraftaar karwaane ke liye inaam kii ghoshnaa ke vigyaapan sabhi pramukh sthanon par laga diye
 As a result of this, the police found that the sheet was found by someone from Shahjahanpur only because of the washer's mark on the sheet found at the scene
 shahjahanpur ke dhobiyon se poochne par maaloom hua ki chadar banarsi laal kii he
 The police obtained all the distinction by meeting Banarsi Lal
 yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki 9 agast 1925 ko shahjahanpur se uski party ke koun-koun log shahar se baahar gayi the or ve kab-kab waapas aaye? jab khufia taur se is baat kii pushti ho gayi ki ram prasad bismil, jo ech aar e kaa leader tha, us din shahar main nahin tha to 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat main bismil ke saath samooche hindustan se 40 se bhi adhik logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Only 10 people actually participated in the Kakori case, so all of them were nominated

 were released

 Not only this, before sending the case to the sessions court, all the witnesses and evidence were collected so that even if an appeal is made, not a single accused should be released without conviction
 banarsi laal ko hawalat main hi police ne kadi sajaa kaa bhay dikhaakar tod liya
 In the Shahjahanpur District Congress Committee, this Banarasi had a fight with Bismil over the party fund
 bismil ne, jo us samay jila congress cameti ke auditor the, banarsi par party-fund main gaban kaa aarope siddh karte hue use congress party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Later, when Gandhiji came to Shahjahanpur on 16 October 1920, Banarasi met him and made his stand
 gandhi ji ne us samay yah kahkar ki choti-moti hera-pheri ko itnaa tool nahin dena chaiye, in donon main sulah kara di
 But Banarsi was a very sly man
 usne pehle to bismil se maafee maang lee phir gandhi ji ko alag le jaakar unke kaan bhar diye ki ramprasad bada hi apradhi kism kaa vyakti he
 They neither believe anything about it nor allow anyone else to do it
 aage chalakar isi banarsi laal ne bismil se mitrataa kar lee or mithi-mithi baton se pehle unka vishwaas arjeet kiya or uske baad unke saath kapade ke vyapaar main saajheedaar ban gaya
 When Bismil formed his own party criticizing Gandhiji, Banarasi Lal was overjoyed and kept quiet in search of an opportunity
 police ne sthaneey logon se bismil va banarsi ke pichley jhagade kaa bhed jaanakar hi banarsi laal ko apruvar banaaya or bismil ke viruddh puure abhiyog main ek achook aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya
 Banarasi Lal, being a partner in trade, knew such secret things related to the party, which no one but Bismil could have known

 The 11 district barracks of the Lucknow District Jail, which was then called the Central Jail of the United Provinces, housed all the revolutionaries together and built a temporary court in a luxurious building called Ring Theater near Hazratganj intersection
 ring theatre naam kii yah building kothi hayaat baksh or mallika ahad mahal ke bich hua karti thi jisamen british afasar aakar film va naatak aadi dekhakar manoranjan kiya karte the
 In the same ring theater for 18 consecutive months, the British government spent 10 lakh rupees when the value of gold used to be 20 rupees in a historic trial in the name of King Imperial Versus Ram Prasad 'bismil' and Others
 british hukmaranon ke aadesh se yah building bhi baad main dhaha di gayi or uski jagah san 1929-1932 main ji pi o lakhanu ke naam se ek doosraa bhavy bhawan bana diya gaya
 When India became independent in 1947, the Nehru government completed the true task of installing a grand statue of Gandhiji here

 In this landmark case, Harkarnanath Mishra was appointed as the lawyer of the revolutionaries from government expenditure, while Jagatnarayan 'mulla', a well-known lawyer in relation to Jawaharlal Nehru, was made a government lawyer under a thoughtful strategy
 jagat narayan ne apni ore se sabhi krantikariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dilwane main koi kasar baaki na rakkhi
 It was the same Jagat Narayan against whose will Bismil organized a grand procession of Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in the entire city of Lucknow in 1916
 isi baat se chidh kar mainpuri shadyantra main bhi inhen mullaji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se kaaphi jor lagaaya parantu ve ram prasad bismil kaa ek bhi bal bankaa na kar paye kyonki mainpuri shadyantra main bismil faraar ho gayi the or do saal tak police ke haath hi na aaye
 On 6 April 1927, Special Sessions Judge A
 Hamilton, in a 115-page decision, considering the charges leveled against each revolutionary, wrote that this was not a simple train robbery, but a planned conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire
 haalaanki inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye is yojana main shaamil nahin hua parantu chunki kisi ne bhi na to apane kiye par koi pashchaatap kiya he or na hi bhavishya main is prakaar kii gatividhiyon se swayan ko alag rakhane kaa vachan diya he atah jo bhi sajaa di gayi he soch samaj kar di gayi he or is haalat main usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi chhot nahin di ja sakati
 However, if any of these accused expresses remorse in writing and pledges not to do so in future, the Upper Court may consider their appeal
 faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bahut baad main police giraftaar kar paayi
 An additional case of Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge J
 R
 Bennett and on 13 July 1927, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was hanged and sentenced to life imprisonment to Shachindranath Bakshi, repeating the same thing

 Ram Prasad Bismil made his own defense because at the government expense he was given a big simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 On this reasoning ability of Bismil, Chief Justice Louis Shurtas had to ask him - "mr
 Ramprasad! From which university you have taken the degree of law?" At this he laughed and said- "excuse me sir! a kingmaker did not require Anne's degree
" " adaalat ne is jawaab se chidhkar bismil dwaara 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate
 use pard kar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the court allowed the same Laxmishankar Mishra to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 kakori kand kaa mukadmaa lakhanu main chal rahaa tha
 Pandit Jagatnarayan Mulla was a poet of Urdu along with the government lawyer
 unhone abhiyukton ke liye "muljiman" kii jagah "mulajim" shabd bol diya
 What was it then, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' blatantly lashed out at him with a sarcasm: "don't tell me, mooljim, we are very sorry; we have brought it here with the help of the court
" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant that he is not a servant, but a mullah who earns salaries from the government
 ve to raajnneetik bandi hai at: unke saath tameez se pesh aayen
 Along with this he also warned that they have the power to reverse even the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the big deal to overturn the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed in front of Bismil
 mullah ji ko paseene chhot gayi or unhone kanni kaatane main hi bhalaai samajhi
 They quietly slipped through the back door

 All the revolutionaries, except Shachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal, appealed in the Chief Court
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendra nath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai pi si kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 = kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindra Nath Sanyal, while in jail, had expressed his remorse in writing and had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action
 iske aadhaar par unki umr-kaid barkaraar rahi
 Shachindra's younger brothers Bhupendra Nath Sanyal and Banwari Lal had confessed to their crime and had already given the undertaking to face any punishment of the court, so they did not appeal and the order for imprisonment of 5-5 years remained unchanged
 chif court main apil karne ke baavjood yogeshchandra chatarji, mukundi laal va govindcharan car kii sajaayen 10-10 varsh se badhaakar umr-kaid main badal di gayin
 The decorations of Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and Vishnusharan Dublish also remained the same
 khubasurat handriting main likhakar apil dene ke kaaran keval pranavesh chatarji kii sajaa ko 5 varsh se ghataakar 4 varsh kar diya gaya
 Ramnath Pandey was the least punished in this case
 manmathanath gupt, jinaki goli se musafir maaraa gaya, kii sajaa 10 se badhaakar 14 varsh kar di gayi
 Since the cartridges of the Mauser pistol used in the Kakori case were purchased on the arms license of Premkrishna Khanna, due to sufficient evidence, Premkrishna Khanna was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 5 years
 chif court kaa faisla aate hi samooche desh main sansani fail gayi
 Thakur Manjit Singh Rathore informed the Central Legislative Council to submit a proposal to convert all the hanged prisoners of Kakori case to life imprisonment
 kauncil ke kai sadasyon ne sar wiliam moris ko, jo us samay sanyukt praant ke governor the, is aashay kaa ek prarthana-patr bhi diya kintu unhone use asweekaar kar diya
 78 members of the Central Council sent the then Viceroy and Governor General Edward Frederick Lindley Wood with a signed memorial in Shimla, prominently Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, NC Kelkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, Govind Vallabh Pant , Etc
 had signed but they had no effect on the Viceroy

 The Chief Court in its decision also wrote this matter
 iske baavjood vysarai ne unhen saaf manaa kar diya
 Finally, barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent the documents for clemency petition in the Privy Council to England's renowned lawyer SL Polak
 parantu landan ke nyaayadhishon va samraat ke vaidhanik salaahkaaron ne us par badi sakht daleel di ki is shadyantr kaa sutaradhar ram prasad bismil bada hi khatarnaak or peshewar apradhi he
 If he is granted pardon, he can commit a bigger and more terrible scandal in future
 us sthiti main sarkaar ko hindustan main shashan karnaa asambhav ho jaayegaa
 The result of all this was that the appeal for clemency sent to the Privy Council was also rejected
 16 disambar 1927 ko bismil ne apni aatmakatha kaa aakhri adhyay purna karke jail se baahar bhijwa diya
 Last met the parents on 18 December 1927 and on Monday 19 December 1927, they were hanged in the District Jail of Gorakhpur at 6

 Stunned by this incident, Bhagat Singh wrote the pseudonym 'rebel' in the character of January 1928: "while carrying on the gallows you said very loudly - 'vande Mataram! Bharatmata ki Jai!' And walking in peace, he said - 'O master, you are the one who remains, and you are the one, and neither can i live or be my father; as long as your body lives in blood, your mention and your good will remain!' Standing on the gallows, you said - 'I wish the downfall of the British Empire! That is, i want the fall of the British Empire!' After this the lion said - 'now there are neither Ahle-valvle nor the crowd of arrogance, the desire to eradicate one is now in the heart! Then prayed to God and started reading a mantra

 Ramprasad ji hanged
 " At the end of his article Bhagat Singh writes - "today that hero is not in this world
