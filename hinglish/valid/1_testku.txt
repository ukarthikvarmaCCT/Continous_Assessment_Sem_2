 11 / 03 / 2011 ko bhi yahi hua There are many reasons behind the tsunami waves but the most effective reason is earthquake
 Apart from this, tsunami waves also arise due to land subsidence, volcanic eruptions, some kind of eruption and sometimes meteor impact

 But it is also not necessary that every earthquake causes tsunami waves

 When these tsunami waves reach the shallow waters of any layer of any continent from which it is connected to another continent and can be seen as a crack

 That is because the other continent is also joining at that place and due to the connected layer of earth there is a crack-like place which gives way to the water inside itself

 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth

 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary

 saanchaa:baluchistan, pakistan ke rajyapal Uttararamacharitam is a famous Sanskrit play by Mahakavi Bhavabhuti, in seven points of which is the story of Rama's north life
 bhawabhooti ek safal naatakkaar hai
 In Uttararamacharitam, he has selected a history related to such a hero who is the soul of Indian culture
 is kathanak kaa aakarshan bharat ke saath saath videshi janamanas main bhi sadaa se rahaa he or rahegaa
 With his writing tact, the poet removed the flaw of the character of abandonment of Rama's wife forever
 saath hi sita ko vanvaas dene vaale ram kaa rudan dikhaakar kavi ne sita ke apamaanit tathaa dukh bhare hriday ko bahut shant kiya hai
 In literature, where there is a law for the predominance of Shringar or Veer Ras in plays, the same Bhavabhuti brought a unique revolution in the Natyajatas, by writing Karun Ras Pradhan plays opposite him
 bhawabhooti to yahon tak kehete hai ki karun hi ekmaatr ras he
 The same compassion is expressed in other forms through distinction
 vivaah se purv nayak nayika kaa shringaar varnan to praayah sabhi kaviyon ne safalataa ke saath kiya he parantu bhawabhooti ne daampaty prem kaa jaisaa ujjwal evam vishad chitra khinchaa he vaisaa anyatra dularbh he
 The Uttararamcharitam composed in seven digits is the best drama of Bhavabhuti
 isamen raamarajyamishek ke pashchaat jivan kaa lokottar charit varnit he jo mahaviracharit kaa hi uttar bhaag mana jaataa he
 
 sanskrit natyasahitya main maryadapurshottam shri ramachandra ke paavan charitra se sambaddh anek naatak he kintu unamem bhawabhooti kaa uttarram charitam apana ek alag hi vaishishty rakhata he
 In poetry poetry where Shringar or Veer Rasa predominates in plays, Bhavabhuti has created an incomparable revolution in theatrical world by creating Karun Rasa-based drama opposite him
 uttarramcharitam main prem kaa jaisaa shuddh rup dekhne ko miltaa he vaisaa anya kaviyon kii krittiyon main durlabh he
 Through this drama, the poet has presented the ideal form of the king, who is the idol of selfishness and sacrifice, and Prajranjan is the main religion
 praja sukh ke liye pranpriya patni kaa bhi tyaag karne main jise koi hichak nahin he
 In this play, more than the description of the soft and sweet form of nature, its serious and severe form has been described which are unique and embellished
 vastav main yah naatak anya naatakon kii tulana main niraala hi he
 That is why it has a special place in the Sanskrit theater world
 saar rup main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vishwaas kii mahima main, prem kii pavitrataa main, bhaawanaaon kii tarangakreeda main, bhashaa ke gambheery main or hriday ke mahatmaya main uttarramcharitam shreshth evam athulaneey naatak he
 Rama abandons Sita despite not wanting due to massacre
 sitatyag ke baad virahi ram kii dasha kaa tritiy ank main karun chitra prastut kiya gaya he, jo kavy kii drushti se is naatak kii jaan he
 Bhavabhuti has inscribed the ideal form of romantic love in this voyeur
 komal evam kathor bhaavon kii ruchir vyanjana, romantic or bhayaavah prakruti chitron kaa kushal ankan is naatak kii visheshtaayen hai
 The dynamics of dramatic trade in Uttararamcharit is relaxed and it is more reflective of poetry and lyrical drama than drama drama
 bhawabhooti kii bhavukta or paandityapurna style kaa charam paripaak is kriti main purnat: lakshith hota he

 jeetne kaa prastaav bedford associats of bedford, masachusets se aayaa
 The first PLC, 084, was specified as it was the result of the Choracian project of Bedford Associates
 bedford associats ne vikaas, vinirmaan, bikri or naye utpaada ke liye samarpit ek nai company shuru kii: medicon, jo maudular digital niyantrak ke liye sankshep tha
 One of the people working on the project was Dick Morley, known as the father of PLC
 medicon brands, 1977 main gold electronics ko bech diya gaya, tathaa baad main german company AEG dwaara adhigrahan kiya gaya or uske baad iske maujuuda maalik french shaneder electronic dwaara
 One of the 084 models initially built is now on display at Medicon's headquarters in North Andover, Massachusetts
 jab unit lagbhag bees saal kii abaadh seva ke baad seva nivruth hua, tab yah ji em dwaara medicon ko diya gaya tha
 Until the appearance of 984, Medicon used 84 monikers at the end of its product range
 automotive udyog abhi bhi PLC ke sabase bade upyogkartaaon main se ek he
 Early PLC relays were designed to replace logic systems
 yah plcs "leader laajik" main yojanabaddh the, jo dridhtaa se riley laajik ke arekhiy chitra jaisaa dikhta he
 This program marking was chosen to reduce the training demands of existing technicians
 anya praarambhik plcs instrection list programing, kii ek avasthaa kaa upyog karte the, jo steke-aadhaarit laajik solver par aadhaarit thi
 Modern PLC can be programmed in various ways, from ladder logic to traditional programming languages such as BASIC and C
 Another method is state logic, a very high level programming language based on state transition diagrams of PLC programs
 Is designed for 1980 ke madhya tak praarambhik PLC, swaamitv programing panelon yaa vishesh-prayojan ke programing terminlon ke prayog se yojanabaddh kiye jate the, jinamein aksar samarpit kaary keez hoti thi jo PLC prograamon ke vibhinn lajical tatwon kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi
 Program cassettes were stored on tape cartridges
 mamori kshamta kii kami ke kaaran mudran or pralekhan ke liye suvidhaayen bahut kam thi
 Very old plcs used static magnetic core memory
 PLC kii kaaryakshmata, samay ke saath viksit hui he, ab inamen anukramik riley niyantran, gati niyantran, prakriya niyantran, vitarit niyantran pranali or netwarking shaamil hai
 The data handling, storage, processing power and communication capabilities of some modern plcs are roughly equivalent to desktop computers
 plc-jaisi programing ke saath sudur i / o hardware kaa sangyojan, ek saamaanya-prayojan desktop computer ko kuch anuprayogon main kuch PLC ko atichhaadan karne kii anumati detaa he
 The main difference from other computers is that plcs are armored for critical situations and have facilities for extensive input / output systems
 yah PLC ko samvedak or pravartak se jodate hai
 PLC limit switches read analog process variable and complex setup system state
 kuch mashin drushti kaa upyog karte hai
 On the promoter side, PLC electric motors, aerial or hydraulic cylinders, magnetic relays, solenics or analog outputs, operate
 nivesh / nirgam vyavastha ek saral PLC main gathan kii ho sakati hai, yaa PLC ke paas bahari i / o maapdand ho sakate hai jo PLC main plag hone vaale computer network se jude hote hai
 In a small PLC a fixed number of connections are made for input and output

 ek vishesh ucch gati kramik i / o link istemaal kii jaati he taaki rack, procesar se dur vitarit kiye ja sake, isse bade sanyantron ke liye viring kii laagat kam ho jaati he
 The PLC may need to interact with people for the purpose of everyday control, alarm reporting, or configuration
 is prayojan ke liye ek hayuman-mashin interphes niojit kiya jaataa he
 hmis are also referred to as mmis and guis
 ek saral pranali upyogkarta ke saath baatcheet karne ke liye batan or roshni kaa upyog kar sakati he
 Text display is available as well as graphical touch screen
 More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, in which the PLC is connected via a communication interface
 PLC main anternihit sanchaar port hote hai, aam taur par 9-pin RS-232, par vaikalpik rup se EIA-485 yaa ethernet
 modbas, bacnet yaa DF1 aam taur par ek sanchaar protocol ke rup main shaamil hota he
 Other options include various fieldbases such as devicenet or Profibus
 anya sanchaar protocol jo istemaal kiye ja sakate hai, swachaalan protocol kii suchi main soochibaddh hai
 Most modern plcs can communicate from one network to another system, such as a SCADA system or a computer operating a web browser
 bade i / o system main prayukt PLC main processron ke bich pear-tu-pear sanchaar ho saktaa he
 This allows individual control for individual parts of a complex process and at the same time commands the subsystem to coordinate from above the communication link
 These communication links are also often used for HMI devices such as keypads or pc-like workplaces
 PLC program vishisht rup se ek vyaktigat computer par ek khaas aavedan main likhe jate hai, phir ek sidhe-conection cabel yaa ek network ke dwaara PLC main downlod kiye jate hai
 The program is stored in the PLC in either battery-baked-up RAM or some other static flash memory
 aksar, ek ekal PLC hajaaron rilage kii jagah lene ke liye program kiya ja saktaa he
 Under the IEC 61131-3 standard, plcs can be programmed using standard-based programming languages
 ek graphic programing sanketan jise anukramik function chart kaha jaataa he, kuch programable niyantrakon par uplabdh he
 Most plcs initially used ladder logic diagram programming, a model simulating electro-mechanical control panel equipment, which was replaced by PLC
 yah model aaj aam he
 IEC 61131-3 currently defines five programming languages for programmable control systems: FBD, LD, ST, IL and SFC
 These techniques emphasize the logic pure organization of the operation
 jabaki PLC programing kii moolbhoot avadharanaen sabhi nirmaataaon ke liye aam hai, i / o parichayan, mamori sanghathan or nirdesh set ke bich bhinnata kaa matlab he ki PLC program kabhi bhi vibhinn nirmaataaon ke bich purnatah anternimeya karne yogya nahin hai
 Even within the same product line of the same manufacturer, different models may not be directly suitable
 PLC swachaalan kaaryon kii ek shrenee ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit hai
 These are typically industrial processes, in construction where the cost of building and maintaining the automation system is higher than the total cost of automation and where some changes to the system will be expected during its working period
 PLC main nivesh / nirgam upkaran hai, jo audyogic payalat upkarnon or niyantran ke saath anukool hai; thode se vidyut dizine kii aavashyaktaa he or dizine samasya aaparishan ke vaanchit anukram kaa varnan karne par kendrit ho jaati he
 PLC applications are usually highly customized systems so the price of a clustered PLC is lower than the price of a uniquely customized controller design
 duusari ore, aadhiky-utpaadit maal ke maamle main, anukulit niyantran system ghatakon kii kam keemat ke kaaran kifayati hai, jinhen ek "saamaanya" hal kii bajaay sarvotkrisht rup se chunaa ja saktaa he or jaha gaiyr-punaravarti ejineering qeemat hajaaron yaa lakhon ikaayiyon main faili hoti he
 Various techniques are used for high-volume or very easy scheduled automation tasks
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta dishvashr ek vidyut-yantric kem timer dwaara niyantrit kiya jayega, jisaki laagat utpaadan maatra main keval kuch dollar hogi
 a microcontroller-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units would be generated and thus the cost of development could be spread across multiple sales and where the end user would not need to change the controls
 automotive aavedan ek udhaaharan he, prayek varsh lakhon ikaiyaan banaai jaati hai or bahut kam ant upyogkarta in niyantrakon kii programing ko badalte hai
 However, some special transports such as transit buses use economical PLC rather than specially designed controls, as they are smaller in volume and development costs would be uneconomical
 bahut jatil prakriya niyantran, jaise rasayan udyog main istemaal hone vaale, ko algoridm kii or yahan tak kii ucch-pradarshan PLC kii kshamta se bhi pare pradarshan kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Very high speeds or precise controls may also require customized solutions, for example, aircraft flight control
 programable niyantrak gati niyantran, sthaapan niyantran or tark niyantran main vyapak rup se upyog kiye jate hai
 Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be compiled with PLC so that the G-code can be used in ordering machine movements
 PLC main ekal-parivartaneey feedback analog niyantran loop ke liye laajik, ek "anupatik, sampurna, sanjaat" yaa "PID niyantrak" shaamil ho saktaa he
 For example, a PID loop can be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process
 aitihaasik rup se, PLC saadharantah keval kuch analog niyantran loop ke saath configar kiye jate the, jaha prakriyaaon ko saikadon yaa hajaaron loop kii aavashyaktaa hoti, vahaan isaki jagah ek vitarit niyantran system istemaal ho jaati
 chunki PLC adhik shaktishaalee ho gaye hai, DCS or PLC anuprayogon ke bich kii seemaa kam spasht ho gai he
 The PLC has the same functionality as remote terminal units
 ek RTU baharhaal, aam taur par niyantran algoridm yaa niyantran loop kaa samarthan nahin karata
 hardware ke teji se adhik shaktishaalee or sasta ho jane se,rtus plcs or dcss tezi se jimmedaariyon main atichhaadan karnaa shuru ho gaye hai or kai vikreta plc-jaisi suvidhaon ke saath rtus bech rahe hai or vilomtah
 udyog ne IEC 61131-3 kaaryaatmak block bhashaa ko rtus or plcs par chalane vaale program banane ke liye manakikrut kiya he, haalanki lagbhag sabhi vikreta swaamitv vikalp or sambandhit vikaas ke vaataavaran bhi pradaan karte hai
 Digital or discrete signals behave as binary switches and easily generate an on or off signal
 Push buttons, limit switches, and photoelectric sensors are examples of devices providing a discrete signal
 asatat sanket yaa to voltage, yaa bijli ke prayog se bheje jate hai, jaha ek vishisht shrenee on ke rup main niyukt kii jaati he or duusari of ke
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek PLC sambhawatah 24 v DC i / o upyog kar sakati he, jisamen 22 v DC ke upar ke mulya on darshaate hai, 2VDC se neeche ke mulya of or madhyavarti mulya anishchit hote hai
 Initially, the PLC had only discrete i / O
 analog sanket maatra niyantran kii tarah hai, jinamein shunya or purna paimaane ke bich mulyon kii ek pankti he
 These are typically translated as integer values by the PLC, depending on the different range of accuracy or number of bits available on the device and to store data
 kyunki PLC aamtaur par 16 bit sankethik binary procesar upyog karte hai, isliye purnank mulya -32,768 or +32,767 ke bich simit hai
 Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals
 analog sanket, prakriya sanket ke mulya se anupatik gurutv kii voltage yaa bijli kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, an analog 4-20 ma or 0 - 10 v input would be converted to an integer value of 0 - 32767
 maujuuda nivesh vidyut awaz ke sambandh main voltage nivesh, se kam samvedansheel hai
 For example, suppose a facility needs to collect water in a tank
 zarurat padane par, pani ek anya system dwaara tanks se khinchaa jaataa he or hamaare udahaaran system ke liye tanks ke jal str kaa prabandhan karnaa aavashyak he
 Using only digital signals, the PLA has two digital inputs from the float switch
 When the water level is above the switch, it closes a contact and sends the signal to an input
 PLC, tanks main pravesh valve ko kholane or band karne ke liye digital nirgam kaa upyog karata he
 When the level of the water gets low enough that the float switch at the bottom level closes, then the PLC will open the valve so that more water comes in
 Once the water level rises high enough so that the switch to the top level is turned on, the PLC will close the entrance to prevent water from flowing out
 yah seedhi sil-in laajik kaa ek udhaaharan he
 This output remains closed until a situation breaks the circuit
 ek analogus system ek pani kasaav sensor yaa ek baari cell or ek tenk ke baahar tapakaav karte samyojya kaa prayog kar saktaa he, valve pani ko dhire dhire vaapis tenk main samyojit kar detaa he
 This system incorporates PLC "hysteresis", which basically creates a "deadband" of activity, to prevent 'flutter' adjustments that can break the valve
 ek takanisian is deadband ko samyojit kar detaa he to valve rate main keval ek mahatvapurn badlaav ke liye chalata he
 This in turn reduces the speed of the valve, reducing its rigidity
 ek asli system donon drushtikon kaa gathbandhan kar saktaa he, jisamen flot switch or saral valve kaa upyog chhalkaav rokane ke liye hota he or ek rate sensor or rate valve kaa phir se bharne ke rate ko anukultam karne env pani ke haimer ko rokane ke liye
 Backup and maintenance methods can make a real system very complex
