 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5

 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics

 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox

 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood

 This determinism and centralization will be required

 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary

 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in

 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox

 He was a critic of Hinduism and Islam
 unhone saamaajik andhvishwaas kii ninda kii or saamaajik buraaiyon kii sakht aalochana kii thi
 During his lifetime both Hindus and Muslims threatened him for his views
 kabir panth naamak dharmik sampradaay inaki shikshaaon ke anuyaayi hai
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body
 unke mukh se tatkaal 'ram-ram' shabd nikal padaa
 Kabir accepted the same Rama as the deeksha-mantra and accepted Ramanand ji as his guru
 kabir ke hi shabdon main- Kabir used to work as a weaver to earn a living
 kabir kii drudh manyata thi ki karmon ke anusaar hi gati milti he sthaan vishesh ke kaaran nahin
 He went to Maghar at the end of time to prove his belief; because people believed that one dies in Kashi and one gets heaven when Maghar dies
 magahar main unhone antim saans lee
 Even today the tomb and mausoleum are located there
 kabir kii bhashaa sadhukkadi he
 Their language includes the language of all the dialects of Hindi language

 The disciples collected their works in a book titled "bijak" which has three main parts: Sakhi, Sabad, Ramani sadhu santon kaa to ghar main jamaavada rahata hi tha
 Kabir was not educated - 'don't touch my paper, i don't touch a pen
 'unhone swayan granth nahin likhe, munh se bhakhe or unke shishyon ne use likh liya
 The glory of Ramnama is echoed in all your thoughts
 ve ek hi ishwar ko maanate the or karmkand ke ghor virdohi the
 They did not consider avatar, idol, Roza, Eid, Masjid, temple etc
 ve kabhi kehete hai- 'harimor Piu, i am Ram's daughter-in-law', sometimes say, 'hari janani main balak tora'
 or kabhi "bada hua to kya hua jaisai" At that time, the Hindu public was affected by the terror of Muslim terror
 kabir ne apane panth ko is dhang se suniyojit kiya jisase muslim mat kii ore jhuki hui janata sahaj hi inaki anuyaayi ho gayi
 He kept his language simple and comprehensible so that it could reach the common man
 isse donon sampradaayon ke paraspar milan main suvidha hui
 Their creeds were against Muslim culture and cow-feeding

 ' Who should tell the elephant who has fallen in the pit lost by the fowler while running from the forest? saransh yah ki dharm kii jigyaasa sein prerit ho kar bhagwaan gosai apana ghar chhod kar baahar to nikal aaye or harivyasi sampradaay ke gadde main gir kar akele nirvasit ho kar asanvaadya sthiti main pad chuke hai
 Targeting the idol worship, he made a appearance - paahan puuje hari milain, to main poojon pahaar
 Well, it is good, PC Khay Sansar
 
 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable
 par kabir ke ram param samarth bhale hon, lekin samast jeevon or jagat se bhinn to kadaapi nahin hai
 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram
 vah kehete hainvyapak brahm sabanimain ekai, ko pandit ko jogi
 ravana-rao Kavansun Kavan Veda
 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise

 According to Dave mccomas, executive director of the South West Research Institute in San Antonio, USA, these winds that move at millions of miles per hour from the Sun create a protective bubble around the solar system

 In the early 21st century, Bollywood-style Assamese films began to appear on the big screen
 bazaar ke paimaane par vah hindi chalchitron se bahut peeche he
 Assamese cinema began with the vision of a visionary, Roopkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also an eminent poet, playwright, musician and freedom fighter
 He played a key role in the production of Assam's first film Joymoti, under the banner of Chitralekha Movietone

 Despite Joymoti's huge financial losses, another film Indramalati was shot between 1937 and 1938 which was screened in 1939
 vipareet paristhitiyo kaa majbootee se saamana karte hue agarwal ne do saal baad apni duusari or aakiri film indramalati kaa nirmaan kiya
 Famous singer and musician from Assam, Bhupen Hazarika played an outstanding role in this film
 jyotiprasad ke nidhan ke baad asamiya filmo main kuch samay ke liye khamoshi kaa daur chaa gaya
 But after World War II there were some changes in the Assamese film industry

 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha

 It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the third largest planet by mass

 According to the celestial unit, Varuna's orbit is at an average distance of 30
1 km from the sun, that is, Varun is about thirty times more than the sun in comparison to the Earth

 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size

 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"
 varun pehla grah tha jisaki astitv kii bhavishyavaanee use bina kabhi dekhe hi ganit ke adhyayan se kii gayi thi or jise phir us aadhaar par khoja gaya

 "neptune" was the god of the sea in the ancient Roman religion, the place of the god "varuna" in ancient India, so this planet is called Varuna in Hindi
 roman dharm main naptune ke haath main trishul hota tha isliye varun kaa khagolashastriy chinh ♆ he
 Where the planet Arun looks like just a sphere with no marks or spots on it, there is a clear cloud, storm and change of weather on Varun

 kyonki varun suraj se itnaa dur he, isliye uskaa upree vayumandal bahut hi thanda he or vahaan kaa taapmaana -128 °centegrade tak gir saktaa he
 Due to its large size, the temperature of the planet reaches 5,000 ° c due to the severe pressure of its gravity in the center of the planet
 varun ke ird-gird kuch chhitare-se upgrahi challe bhi hai jinhen wayager dwitiya ne dekha tha
 The light blue color of Varuna comes from the methane gas present in its upper atmosphere

 On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first mass-centric En orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not show in its exact position in our skies, as the Earth was in a different location in its 365
25-day orbit
 Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 july Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011
