 The Pratibhagya philosophy neither considers an object to be false nor transitory
 isaki drushti main prayek vastu kii apni satta he, balki satta hi vastu kii niamak he
 That is, if there is an object then it will surely have power and if it does not have power then it is not an object
 inke anusaar to vastu, vastu kaa karta or vastubodh kaa madhyam teenon hi yatharth hai
 This is Shaivism
 kashmir kaa advait shaiva darshan teen mukhya naamon se prakhyat he - Pratibhigya philosophy - It is called 'pratibhigya philosophy' because it believes that it is monotheistic but forgetting its form, it establishes the country and soul

 Ultimate Element: The vision of this philosophy is Advaita or Advaita
 param tatv dwaitarahit yaa advay he
 He has been designated with the words Parameshwara, Paramashiva, Chitparasvitta, Anantara etc
 chit vah he jo apane ko sab aavarnon se dhakkar bhi sadaa anaavruth bana rahata he, sab parivartanon ke bheetar bhi sadaa parivartanrahit bana rahata he
 There is no dualism of Pramata theorem, Vedak Vedya, because there is nothing other than that
 iskaa swaroop prakashvimarshmay he
 Shankar Vedanta also considers Chitta to be Advaita, but in Shankar Vedanta, Chit is only light, it is illuminating in Pratibhagya philosophy
 mani bhi prakashrup he
 Merely speaking as a form of light cannot be a representation of the divine
 trik yaa pratybhigna darshan kaa kahana he ki param tatv vah prakaash he jise apane prakaash kaa vimarsh bhi he
 "discourse" is a technical term
 iskaa arth he chit kii atmachetana, prakaash kaa atmagyaan, prakaash kaa yah gyaan ki "main hoon"

 vimarsh chetana kii chetana he
 Kshemraj called the discourse "akritrimamaham iti visfuranam" as a natural ego
 kritrim ahan hri "aswabhaavik main" kaa gyaan vedyasaapeksh he
 Discourse is complete knowledge of the natural ego, it is "completelessness", because the whole world is in it
 usase vyatirikt kuch he hi nahin
 Kshemaraja has said "if Nirvimarsha: Siyat Anishvaro Jdash Prajjyate means that if the supreme element was just light and not conversational, then it would become insensible and root
 chit apane ko chitshakti ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Chitra's view of itself in this form is called discourse
 isi vimarsh ko is shaastra ne parashakti, parawak, swatantry, aishwarya, kartrutv, sphurataa, saar, hriday, spand ityadi naamon se abhihit kiya he
 When we say that the divine light is illusory, then it means that it is not just a sign, it is also a power
 yah paramtatv vishvoteern bhi he or vishvamay bhi he
 The world is an expression of Shiva's power
 pralayavastha main yah bhakthi shiv main sanhrut rahati he, sristi or sthiti main yah shakti vishvakar main vyakt rahati he
 The world is inseparable from Paramashiva, it is the memory of Shiva
 parameshwar yaa paramshiv bina kisi upadan ke, bina kisi aadhaar ke, apane swatantry se, apni swechha se, apni hi bhitti yaa aadhaar main vishwa kaa unmolan karata he
 The painter makes a painting on some basis, with the help of paintbrush and color, but the painter, base, paintbrush, color of this world painting is all Shiva
 parameshwar hi multatv he
 This philosophy is called "godlessism" because there is nothing more than God
 agyaan yaa maaya usase bhinn kuch nahin he
 This is the unconstrained form of the same
 vah apane swatantry se, apni ichha se apane ko dhak bhi letaa he
 And it also manifests itself at will
 shankar vedant yaa brahmavaad bhi advaitavaadi he, kintu brahmavaad or ishwaradvayavaad main paryaapt antar he
 Brahmanism considers Brahman as Nirguna, Nirvikar Chaitanya
 uske anusaar brahm main kartrutv nahin he, kintu ishwaradvayavaad ke anusaar paramshiv main swatantry yaa kartrutv he jiske dwaara vah sadaa sristi, sthiti, sanhaar, anugrah or vilay in panchakrutyon ko karata rahata he
 According to this philosophy, Samvita or Param Shiva's connection to the world is Darpanbhbavat
 jaise svachh darpan main nagar, vriksh ityadi padaarth pratibimbit hone par usase abhinn hote hue bhi usase bhinn dikhalaai detaa he
 That is why the vision of this philosophy is called "thankfulness"
 darpan ke udhaaharan main ek baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie
 There is reflection in the world from the object itself, but in this philosophy the world reflection takes place in God
 is darshan kii drushti ko swatantryavad bhi kehete he
 Param Shiva has infinite powers, but mainly five powers are heart, bliss, desire, knowledge, action

 There is a gland of soul in the form of soul-reverence in the dehthics
 iskaa bhed kar apane vaastavik swaroop kii pratybhigna hi moksh he
 The goal of this philosophy is not Kaivalya, Chidananda or Shiva
 yah akrutrim purnarhata kaa udai hone par hi praapt ho saktaa he
 When the mind or individual consciousness culminates in the mind or the collective consciousness, the fullness that arises is the consciousness of Shiva, in which the whole world becomes blissful as it becomes chinmaya or shirupa
 kaivalya vichaar yaa shivaroop ho jane se anand rup ho jaataa he
 Kaivalya is derived from thought or wisdom
 isamen gyaan he kintu kartrutv nahin, chit chitshakti nahin
 Shiva has a present with Chit Shakti
 isamen gyaan or kartrutv donon rahete hai
 In fact, there is no absolute distinction between knowledge and action in this philosophy
 kriya gyaan kaa hi ek rup he
 Knowledge in Shankar Vedanta is considered the means of salvation
 pratybhigna yaa trikdarshan shushk gyanmarg nahin he
 It has a sweet harmony of knowledge and devotion
 is darshan ke anusaar gyaan hone par paran ke prati swaabhaavik bhakthi udit hoti he jise gyanottara yaa parabhakti kehete hai
 This devotion is not the means, but the practicable form
 vaastavik chidanand vahi he jisamen jeevatma or paramatma kaa madhur milan hota he, jisamen samrasya kaa anubhav hota he
 But chindananda cannot be achieved by syntax or logic
 yah shiv ke anugrah se hi siddh ho saktaa he
 This grace is called Shaktipat
 anugrah se hi guru miltaa he
 After receiving initiation from the guru, the living being attains salvation
 mel kaa kshay karke anugrah praapt kar moksh kaa adhikari banane ke saadhan ko "upaay" kehete hai

 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis

 aisi do pranaliyaan hai, jo atiparasarniya majja kaa nirmaan karti hai or is prakaar sharir main plasma kii maatra ko badhaati hai: uria punarchakran tathaa ‘ekal prabhaav 
' Urea is usually excreted from the kidneys as a waste material
 haalanki, jab plasma rakt-maatra kam hoti he or adiech choda jaataa he, to isse khulne vaale equaporins bhi uria ke prati bhedya hote hai
 This allows urea to form a hyperosmotic solution that 'attracts' water by leaving a hyper collecting tube and entering the medulla

 Long-term blood pressure control is mainly dependent on the kidneys
 mukhyatah aisa koshiketar drav upkhand ke anurakshan ke madhyam se hota he, jiskaa aakar plasma sodium sandrata par nirbhar karata he
 However, the kidneys cannot directly estimate blood pressure, but changes in the delivery of sodium and chloride to the distal parts of the nephron alter the secretion of the renal fermentin used by the kidney
 jab koshiketar drav upkhand vistaarit ho or raktchaap ucch ho, to in yanon kii supurdagee bad jaati he or renin kaa srav ghat jaataa he
 Similarly, when the extracellular fluid subdivision is compressed and blood pressure is low, the delivery of sodium and chloride decreases and the renin secretion increases in response
 renin un rasinic sandeshvaahakon kii shrinkhalaa kaa pehla sadsy he, jo milakar renin-angiotencin tantra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Changes in renin eventually alter the output of this mechanism, mainly angiotensin II and aldosteron

 When renin levels are increased, the concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone increases, resulting in increased reabsorption of sodium chloride, expansion of extracellular fluid subdivision, and increased blood pressure
 iske vipareet, jab renin ke str nimna hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron ke str ghat jate hai, jisase koshiketar drav upkhand kaa sankuchan hota he or raktchaap main kami aati he
 The kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol, and renin

 Renin, which is part of the renin – angiotensin – aldosteron mechanism, is an enzyme involved in the control of aldosteron levels
 stanpayi jeevon main gurde kaa vikaas madhyavarti mesoderm se hota he
 The development of the kidney, also known as nephrogenesis, passes through three successive stages, each of which is marked by the development of a more advanced pair of kidneys: pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros
 vibhinn jaanwaron ke gurde vikasaatmak anukulan ke pramaanon ko pradarshit karte hai or lambey samay se unka adhyayan paristhitiki-sharir vigyaan tathaa tulanaatmak sharir vigyaan main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Kidney morphology, often listed as marrow thickening, is related to the dryness of the natural habitat in species of mammal organisms
 gurde se judi chikitsiya shabdaawaliyaan aamtaur par vrikkeey jaise shabdon tathaa nefro- upsarg kaa prayog karti hai
 The adjective renal, which means, related to renal, is derived from the Latin word renes, meaning kidney; The prefix nephro- is derived from the ancient Greek word nephros) used for the kidneys
 udhaaharan ke liye, shalyachikitsa ke dwaara gurde ko nikaal dena nefrectomi kehalaata he, jabaki gurde ke kaary main kami ko vrikkeey dushkriya kehete hai
 In general, humans can survive normally even with only one kidney because the number of renal tissues in each is more than the number required to survive

 In most vertebrate organisms, mesonephros is transformed into an adult kidney, although it is often associated with more advanced metanephroses; In amniote only the mesonephros is restricted to the embryo
 machhlee or ubhaycharon ke gurde vishisht rup se sankare, lambey ang hote hai, jo dhad kaa ek bahut bada bhaag gher lete hai
 The collecting tubes of each flock of nephrons are emptied into an archinephric tube, which resembles the habitat defenses of amniote organisms
 haalanki, yah sthiti sadaiv hi saral nahin hoti; upasthissom machhliyon main or kuch ubhaycharon main, emniot jeevon main pai jane vaali mutrvahini ke samaan, ek choti nalika hoti he, jo gurde ke pichley bhaagon ko rikt karti he or mutrashay yaa mori par archinephric nalika se jud jaati he
 In fact, in many adult cartilage fishes, the anterior part of the kidney may be deformed or stop functioning altogether
 sarvaadhik aadim kasheruki jeevon, hegfish or lampre main, gurde kii sanrachana asaadhaaran rup se saral hoti he: yah nefron kii ek pankti se milakar banati he, jinamein se prayek sidhe archinephric nalika main rikt hota he
 Invertebrates may have excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as "kidneys", but, even in amphioxus, they never resemble the kidneys of vertebrates and more accurately Other names, such as nephridia, are used for them
 sarisrupon ke gurde anek khandon se bane hote hai, jo ki mote taur par ek rekhiy pattern main vyavasthit hote hai
 There is a single branch of the ureter in the center of each segment, in which the collecting duct is empty
 sarisrupon main usee aakaar ke anya amniot jeevon kii tulana main apekshaakrit kam nefron hote hai, sambhawatah isaliye kyonki unamem chayapachay kii dar nimna hoti he
 Birds have relatively large, long kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct segments
 ye khand anek chote, aniyamit rup se vyavasthit khandon se milakar bane hote hai, jinamein se prayek mutrvahini kii ek shakha par kendrit hota he
 The glomeruli of birds are small in size, but the number of nephrons in them is nearly double that of mammals
 maanav gurda stanpayi jeevon kaa ek bahut vishisht udhaaharan he
 Typical features of the mammalian kidney, compared to other vertebrate organisms, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and the presence of a clearly identifiable bark and marrow
 baad vaala lakshan lups of henle ke bade aakaar kii upasthiti ke kaaran hota he; pakshiyon main ye bahut chote hote hai or anya kasheruki jeevon main vastutah ye nahin paye jate 
 keval stanpayi jeevon main hi gurda apni paaramparik “gurda” akruti main hota he, haalanki iske kuch apwaad hai, jaise timivarg ke sadasyon ke bahu-khand reniculett gurde
 The Latin word renes is related to the English language word "reins", a synonym for kidney in English) of the Shakespearean period, which is also the period in which the King James version was translated
 ek jamaane main gurdon ko antahkaran or chintan kaa ek lokapriy sthaan mana jaataa tha or bible kii anek panktiyaan 7:9, rev
 2:23) kahati hai ki ishwar manushyon ke gurde yaa “vrikk ” ko khojataa or unka nirikshan karata he
 Similarly, the Talmud states that one of two kidneys recommend what is good and the other tells what is bad
 jaanwaron ke gurdon ko manushyon dwaara pakaakar khaaya ja saktaa he 
 The kidneys are usually roasted or fried, but in very complex foods they are cooked on a slow flame with a salt, which will enhance their taste
 anek padaarthon, jaise mixd gril yaa murav jerushalmi main, gurdon ko maance yaa yakrut ke tukdon ke saath milaayaa jaataa he
 Among the most iconic foods made by the kidneys, the British Steak and Kidney Pie, the Swedish Hockarpana, the French Rognos de Vieu Sauce Mottrarde and the Spanish "rinons al Jerez", are particularly notable

 nechar ' - yah british kii ek pramukh vaigyanik patrika he jo pehali baar 4 navambar 1869 ko prakashit kii gayi thi
 This magazine is cited at the highest position among the world's interdisciplinary scientific journals
 ab to adhikansh vaigyanik patrikaayen ati-vishisht ho gayin hai or nechar un gini-chuni patrikaon main se he jo aaj bhi, vaigyanik kshetra kii vishaal shrenee ke mul anusandhan lekh prakashit karti he
 There are many areas of scientific research in which information about new and important developments to be made and research-related articles or papers are published in Nature
 haalanki is patrika ke pramukh pathakagan anusandhan karne vaale vaigyanik hai, par aam janata or anya kshetra ke vaigyanikon ko bhi adhikansh mahatvapurn lekhon ke saransh or up-lekhan aasaani se samaj aate hai
 In the beginning of each issue, editorial, articles and news on issues of common interest of scientists, latest news including science-funding, business, scientific ethics and new research related research are printed
 pustakon or kala sambandhi lekhon ke liye bhi alag-alag vibhaag hai
 Most of the research-related articles are printed in the rest of the journal, which is often quite deep and technical
 chunki lekhon kii lambaai par ek seemaa nirdhaarit he, atah patrika main aksar anek lekhon kaa saransh hi chapa jaataa he or anya vivaranon ko patrika ke website par supplementary material ke tahat prakashit kiya jaataa he

 After that, technological and industrial changes took place on a large scale in Britain and there was a lot of progress
 The most well-known journals of this century were - printed journals published by the Royal Society, with research papers published by great scientists such as Charles Darwin to Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday
 iske alaava, is avadhi ke dauraan, lokapriy vaigyanik patrikaon kii sankhya -1850 ke dashak se 1860 ke dashak kii tulana main - duguni ho gayi
 According to the editors of these popular journals, these publications were conceived so that they could become the "mouthpieces of science" to connect the general public with the scientific world
 haalanki nechar ' kaa janm 1869 main hua, par apane khaas dhang kii yah pehali patrika nahin thi
 Even before 'nature', there used to publish a journal called Recreative Science: a Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation, which started in 1859 - as a general historical journal, but later it included physical observation science and technical subjects
 Happened and articles decreased
 The original name of the magazine has undergone several changes - first the Intellectual Observer, a review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreational Science and finally the Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art
 The 'recreational Science' consisted mostly of physics science subjects such as astronomy and archeology, but the magazine was also expanded to include literature and arts-related subjects in the Intellectual Observer

 Prior to Nature, two other magazines were published in England, namely, Quarterly Journal of Science and Scientific Opinion, which were founded in 1864 and 1868 respectively
 jo patrika nechar ' ke sampadakeey or pariklpana se sabase zyaada milti-julati thi, vah thi - da reader ' - jiskaa janm hua tha 1864 main or jisamen -popyular siance rivyuu ' kii hi tarah - vigyaan ke saath-saath sahitya va kala-sambandhi vishyon kaa bhi samavesh kiya gaya taaki vaigyanik-samudaay ke alaava anya pathakagan bhi faaydaa uthaa saken
 All these similar magazines ultimately failed
 Only Popular Science Review 'lasted the most - that is, for 20 years and finally in 1881 its publication also stopped
 ricreative siance ' or student and intlectual obzarwar ' -in donon kaa prakaashan to 1871 main pehle hi band ho chukaa tha
 All these similar magazines ultimately failed
 Only 'popular Science Review' lasted the most - that is, for 20 years and finally in 1881 its publication also stopped
 quarterli jarnal ' ke sampadakeey vibhaag main anekanek badlaav hue or aakhir 1885 main yah patrika bhi band ho gayi

 The line was - "to the solid ground of nature trusts the mind that builds for income"
 Nature's effort, first published by owner and publisher Alexander Macmillan, was similar to that of its ancestral journals, namely - "to provide an accessible platform for sophisticated readers to read information about scientific progress"
 Janet Brown states, "'nature' was designed, born and developed only to serve a polemical purpose, far surpassing that of any other science journal at the time
" " nechar ' ke praarambhik sanskarnon main, x club naamak ek samooh ke sadasyon dwaara likhit lekh prakashit hote the
 It was a group of scientists who believed in free, progressive and, to some extent, controversial scientific beliefs of the time

 In the late 19th century, this group was strongly criticized by a group of conservative scientists
 Perhaps due to scientific immunity, Nature has achieved, in some parts, more success than her ancestral journals
 John Maddox, editor of Nature 'magazine from 1966 to 1973 and from 1980 to 1995, suggested at the lunchtime edition of the magazine's hundredth edition that "perhaps the quality of journalism of' Nature 'gave readers of' Journalism ' attracted
 madox ne kaha ki "yahi wo tarika he jisase logon main - jo anyathaa ek duusare se alag-alag rahete hai - ek samudaay main hone kii bhaavana ko jagaaya ja saktaa he
 Laukier's magazine did the same thing from the beginning

 In the 20th century, especially in the late 90s, there were many developments and expansions in the journal 'nature'
 imperial college ke professor'norman loukyar nechar ' ke sansthaapak the
 He was followed by Richard Gregory, who took over the reins of the magazine in 1919
 Gregory was instrumental in establishing Nature 'in the international scientific community
 The Royal Society wrote in his death note, "gregory was always very interested in international contacts with science and he always published articles related to the activities of the International Scientific Associations in Nature 'very generously
" From 1945 to 1973, there were three changes in the editorship of Nature - first in 1945 AJV Gail and LJF
 Brimble, then John Maddox in 1965 and finally David Davis in 1973
 In 1980, Meadowx became editor again and remained until 1995
 Since then, Philip Campbell has held the title of 'editor-in-chief' of all publications of Nature

 Therefore, after catching him, the police put him in jail
 itane main trailang swami jail kii chat par dikhaai pade
 The cell where Tralang Swamy was locked by the police was locked and the lock of that cell was intact and how the Tralang Swami came on the roof of the jail was a matter of surprise

 swami ji ne to use pi liya kintu kuch hi der baad naastik vyakti pidaa ne chatapataane laga or swami ji se apane praano kii raksha kii bheekh maangane laga
 Tralang Swami, dissolving his silence, said that you gave me poison to drink, then you did not know that your life is in harmony with my life
 yadi main yah nahin jaanata hota ki mere pet main usee tarah ishwar virajman he jis tarah vah vishwa ke anu-parmaanu main he tab to chooney ke ghol ne mujhe maar hi daalaa hota
 Now you have understood the meaning of the Goddess of Karma, so do not ever try to trick anyone
 trailang swami ke in shabdo ke saath hi vah naastik ksht mukt ho gaya
 There are many examples of the powerful spiritual power of Tralang Swami

 Here are some incarnations of Gaushala: The essence of the history of Rama Krishna is Goshala, an element in Goshala, Smriti, Vedo, Upanishads
 
 Religion itself becomes a habit of being a cow, in the country, religion and Sanskrit is the definition of a cow shed
 
 i drank a little more then felt drunk, the drinker drank the cup on the cup and dried it
 
 But there is no restriction on drinking cow vigorously, the more you drink, the stronger the goshala
 
 Disappeared pitu-mat, the brothers all became sister-in-law, sister-in-law was alienated, Jag became alienated, God was angry, angry Allahtala
 
 Broken Gaushala strengthens all relations with the world, by adding easy affection to the drinker
 
 At the party, no matter who drinks a cup of tea, even if you empty the urn, why not drink it? 
 But if the dessert is not there, everything will be called in vain, the gaushala feeds us the mustard sweets in the alms
 
 Before me, behind me, right - left cow, outside me, whatever is inside me, just cow shed
 
 i am the cow of the cows, let me always have goodwill, so i am happier than Surpur, i am my cow 
 Religion is not my hindu-muslim religion; Goshala, karma and duty, work
 Daily Sab Gaushala
 
 The caste of Gobhakta is varna - Go, Gobind - of worshiper, in one word my complete, introduction, only - Goshala
 
 Hun, Yavan, Shaka, Mlechha erased and drank, drunk, and imbibed everyone's poison
 
 But on whose strength the caste is alive till today? 
 The orgy of Danujata also happened to shake the heart, the thunderbolt fell on the monasteries and the monasteries in the temple
 
 But the pennant and the safe cowshed did not bow down, the traitors did their own work of caste
 
 Forgiveting Ripu for seventeen times, Singh Bhola spear, blinded Kehri and did not let it flow
 
 But even with blind eyes, the cowshed, the fire test took place, the drunken drunkenness of patience
 
 Payyapi cut off his head, but the broken, broke but did not bow, who were those advanced heads? His - their, whom - whom he loved, the goshala, who left the country with him and took his face black? Those whose arms were on my lips and lips
 
 Country - Pride of caste who fought, died and were alive, in the heart of sons, was a rotating cow
 
 Just yesterday, the Asura lying in the Chittor fort was brought up, where is that extinguished flame of Jauhar
 
 The deity of the demons failed, the divine goddesses became immortal, the hands were rubbing alcohol, and the cow was glowing
 
 Ghori and Gajnavi lootera Allahdheen poisonous Kala, Bakhtiyar Aurangzeb Ripu - Darun Griever
 
 Green! Come on! There have been so many problems on Gaushala, everyone has been standing with grief, Goshala is standing
 
 Spear started with Dhar, Prithviraj, Saridarsha Nar Bapparaval from Ala, Rana Sanga and Pratap
 
 Rakshita Goshala from Chhatrasal, Gobind, Shiva, Vairagi Sam Veer, Tilak, Subhash Prabirti's sons
 
 Goshala on the page-page of my pride history, this gaushala in every particle of my beloved India mother
 
 i have covered the body of my blood and blood, i will disappear on that day when it will not remain
 
 This slash will go away, this blackness will be black, on the new morning it will fall on the ground, then with golden dreams
 
 Heaven - will be like a world experience, we will again have our own country, village - village house - the day the house will open
