 According to Grove Music Online, "the pop genre derived from the West spread across the world, creating a commonality in global commercial music culture, whether they merged with local genres or created a distinctly different identity

 baad main begum kaa chaay singh ke vidroh main sahyog dene ke aarope main ye jaagiren jabt kar lee gayi, baad main is sahyog kaa dastavezi pramaan bhi mila
 From the evidence just found, it appears that Warren Hastings had tried his best to save the Nawab from his inefficiencies and was also very soft towards the Begums

 In this famine, even the nobles had run out of money
 kaha jaataa he ki nawab aasaf ne is pariyojna main 20,000 se zyaada logon ko kaam diya, yah na masjid tha na kabrgah 
 The Nawab's sense of care about the dignity of the upper class can be gauged from the story of making Imambara

 On the night of every fourth day, the nobles and upper class people were given the task of breaking the secret structure and they were paid in return

 Konark Surya Mandir is revered in the city of Puri under Puri district of the state of Orissa in India
 yah bharatvarsh ke chuninda surya mandiron main se ek he
 In 1984, UNESCO has recognized it as a World Heritage Site
 yah mandir surya-dev arthath arq ko samarpit tha, jinhen sthaneey log biranchi-narayan kehete the
 For this reason, this region was called ark-kshetra or padma-kshetra
 puraanon ke anusaar shrikrishna ke putr samb ko unke shraap se kodh rog ho gaya tha
 Samb did penance for twelve years in Konark at the ocean confluence of the Chandrabhaga river at Mitravan and pleased the Sun God
 suryadev, jo sabhi rogon ke naashak the, ne iske rog kaa bhi nivaaran kar diya tha
 Accordingly, Samb decided to build a temple of the Sun God
 apane rog-naash ke uparaant, chandrabhaga nadi main snaan karte hue, use suryadev kii ek murti mili
 This idol was made by Devashilpi Sri Vishwakarma from the same part of Suryadev's body
 samb ne apane banawaaye mithravan main ek mandir main, is murti ko sthapit kiya, tab se yah sthaan pavitra mana jane laga
 It is the opinion of many historians that due to the premature death of King Langul Narsinghdeva, the builder of the Konark temple, the construction work of the temple fell into disrepair
 iske parinamswaroop, adhuraa dhaancha dhwast ho gaya
 But this view is not supported by historical figures
 puri ke madal panji ke aankadon ke anusaar or kuch 1278 i
 ke tamrapatron se pataa chalaa, ki raja langool nrisinghdev ne 1282 tak shashan kiya
 Many historians are also of the opinion that the Konark temple was built between 1253 to 1260 AD
 atev mandir ke apurna nirmaan kaa iske dhwast hone kaa kaaran hona tarksangat nahin he
 It is no less than a complex task to mention the entire reasons for the demolition of the temple here
 parantu yah sarvavidit he ki ab iskaa kaaphi bhaag dhwast ho chukaa he
 The main reason for this is also called Vastu Dosh, but the role of Muslim invasions has been important
 kaha jaataa he ki yah mandir apane vaastu dosha ke kaaran maatr 800 varshon main ksheen ho gaya tha
 Which is heard and heard against Vastu art and rules
 isi karanvash yah apni samyavadhi se pehle hi rugavedakaal evam pashaan kala kaa anupam udhaaharan hote hue bhi dharashayi ho gaya
 The main architectural defects of this Sun-temple are: -
 kai kathaon ke anusaar, surya mandir ke shikhar par ek chumbakeey pathar laga he
 As a result of this, the ocean ships passing through the sea of konark are drawn towards this, causing heavy damage to them
 anya katha anusaar, is pathar ke kaaran poton ke chumbakeey disha nirupan yantra sahi disha nahin bataate
 For this reason, Muslim sailors took out this stone to save their grandsons
 yah pathar ek kendriya shila kaa kaary kar rahaa tha, jisase mandir kii deevaaron ke sabhi pathar santulan main the
 Due to its removal, the balance of the temple walls was lost and as a result they collapsed
 parantu is ghatana kaa koi aitihaasik vivaran nahin miltaa, naa hi aise kisi chumbakeey kendriya pathar ke astitv kaa koi byora uplabdh he
 a very important theory related to the fall of Konark temple is associated with Kalapahad
 urisa ke itihaas ke anusaar kalapahaad ne san 1508 main yahaan akraman kiya or konark mandir samet urisa ke kai hindu mandir dhwast kar diye
 Madan Panji of the Jagannath temple in Puri tells how Kalapahar attacked Orissa
 konark mandir sahit usne adhikansh hindu mandiron kii pratimaayein bhi dhwast kareen
 Although it was impossible to break the 20-25 feet thick walls of the Konark temple, he somehow managed to shake Dadhinauti, which caused the temple to collapse
 dadhinauti ke hatane ke kaaran hi mandir dhire-dhire girane laga tathaa chat se baari pathar girane se, mukashaala kii chat bhi dhwast ho gayi
 He also demolished most of the sculptures here and many other temples in Konark
 san 1568 main urisa main muslimon kaa aatank niyantran main ho chukaa tha
 But even after this, there were continuous efforts to break the Hindu temples
 is samay puri ke jagannatha mandir ke pandon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ji kii murti ko shrimandir se hataakar kisi gupt sthaan par chupa diya tha
 Similarly, the pandas of the Sun Temple of Konark removed the idol of the presiding deity and kept it hidden in the sand for years
 baad main, yah murti puri bhej di gayi or vahaan jagannatha mandir ke praangan main sthit, indra ke mandir main rakh di gayi
 According to others, the worship idols here are still to be discovered
 lekin kai logon kaa kahana he, ki surya dev kii murti, jo nai dilli ke rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he, vahi konark kii pradhan poojya murti he
 Yet in Konark, Surya Vandana ceased after the removal of the idol from the temple
 is kaaran konark main tirthayatriyon kaa aana janaa band ho gaya
 Konark's port also closed due to bandits attack
 konark surya vandana ke samaan hi vanijyik gatividhiyon hetu bhi ek kirtivan nagar tha, parantu in gatividhiyon ke band ho jane ke kaaran, yah ekadam nirvasit ho chalaa or varshon tak ek gahan jangal se dhank gaya
 In 1626, the king of Khurda, Narasimha Dev, son Shri Purushottam Dev, took the idol of Suryadev to Puri along with two other statues of Surya and Chandra
 ab ve puri ke mandir ke praangan main milti hai
 It is known from the history of the Madal Register of Puri that in 1028, King Naseenhadeva ordered the measurement of all the temples of Konark
 maapan ke samay, surya mandir apni amalak shila tak astitv main tha, yani ki lagbhag 200 feet ooncha
 Kalapahad destroyed not only its urn, but also the padma-dhwaja, kamal-kirit and the upper part
 pehle bataaye anusaar, mukhshala ke saamne, ek bada prastar khand – navagraha paat, hota tha
 The then king of Khurda removed that block, as well as took a number of sculpted stones from Konark
 or puri ke mandir ke nirmaan main unka prayog kiya tha
 In the Maratha period, Konark stones were used in the construction of the boundary wall of the temple of Puri
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he, ki nat mandir ke sabhi bhaag, sabase lambe kaal tak, apni mul avasthaa main rahe hai
 And in the Maratha period, they were deliberately broken as an unusable part
 san 1779 main ek maratha sadhu ne konark ke arun stambh ko hataa kar puri ke singhdwar ke saamne sthapit karvaa diya
 By the end of the eighteenth century, Konark lost all its glory and turned into a forest
 iske saath hi mandir kaa kshetra bhi jangal ban gaya, jahaan junglee jaanavar or daakuon ke adde the
 The locals here were also afraid to go till daylight
 konark shabd, 'kone' or 'arq' shabdon ke mail se bana he
 The meaning of the extract is sun while the angle must have been from the corner or edge
 prastut konark surya-mandir kaa nirmaan laal rang ke balua pattharon tathaa kaale grenite ke pattharon se hua he
 It was built in 1236–1264 BC by the erstwhile feudal king of Ganga Dynasty, Narasimhadeva
 yah mandir, bharat ke sabase prasiddh sthalon main se ek he
 It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984
 kaling style main nirmit is mandir main surya dev ko rath ke rup main virajman kiya gaya he tathaa pattharon ko utkrisht nakkashi ke saath ukera gaya he
 The entire temple site has been constructed with twelve pair of chakras pulled by seven horses, in which the sun god is shown seated
 parantu vartmaan main saaton main se ek hi ghoda bachaa hua he
 These twelve chakras define the twelve months of the year, giving beauty to the base of the temple and each chakra is made up of eight arrows, which represent the eight wheels of the day
 yahaan par sthaneey log prastut surya-bhagwaan ko biranchi-narayan kehete the
 The main temple is built in three pavilions
 inamen se do mandap dhah chuke hai
 In the third pavilion where the idol was, the British had filled the sand and stones before the Indian independence, and closed all the gates permanently so that the temple could not be damaged
 is mandir main surya bhagwaan kii teen pratimaayein hai: On its entry, two lions are shown to be aggressive in defense of elephants
 yah sambhavtah tatkaaleen brahman rupi singhon kaa buddha rupi haathiyon par varchasv kaa pratik he
 Both elephants are set on each human
 ye pratimaayein ek hi pathar kii baniin hai
 They are 8
4 feet long, 4
9 feet wide and 9
2 feet high by 28 tons
 mandir ke dakshini bhaag main do susajjit ghode bane hai, jinhen urisa sarkaar ne apane rajchihn ke rup main angikaar kar liya he
 They are 10 feet long and 7 feet wide
 mandir surya dev kii bhavy yatra ko dikhaata he
 There is a Nat temple at its entrance
 ye vah sthaan he, jahaan mandir kii nartakiyaan, suryadev ko arpan karne ke liye nrity kiya karatin thim
 The entire temple has carvings of flowers and geometric patterns
 inke saath hi maanav, dev, gandharva, kinnar aadi kii akrutiyaan bhi andrik mudraon main darshit hai
 His postures are sensual and derived from Kamasutra
 mandir ab anshik rup se khandhar main parivartit ho chukaa he
 a collection of artifacts here is preserved in the Sun Temple Museum of the Archaeological Survey of India
 mahaan kavi va naatakaar ravindra nath tagore ne is mandir ke bare main likhaa he:- konark jahaan pattharon kii bhashaa manushya kii bhashaa se shreshthatar he
 The main Sun Temple of the thirteenth century is built in the form of a great chariot, with twelve pairs of wheels, drawn by seven horses
 yah mandir bharat ke utkrisht smarak sthalon main se ek he
 The architectural proportions here are devoid of defects and surprising dimensions
 yahaan kii sthapatyakala vaibhav evam maanviya nishtha kaa sauhardpurn sangam he
 Each inch of the temple is replete with unique beauty and artefacts of grace
 iske vishay bhi mohak hai, jo sahasron shilp akritiyaan bhagavaanon, devataaon, gandharvon, maanvon, vaadyakon, premi yugalon, darbar kii chhaviyon, shikaar evam yuddh ke chitron se bhari hai
 Among them are elaborate animals and birds and mythological creatures, besides fine and intricate bells and geometric patterns
 oriya shilpakala kii heere jaisi utkrusht gunvattta puure parisar main alag dikhaai detii he
 This temple is also famous for its sculptures with erotic postures
 is prakaar kii akritiyaan mukhyatah dwarmandap ke dwitiya str par milti hai
 The subject of these figures is shown in clear but very tenderness and rhythm
 jivan kaa yahi drushtikon, konark ke anya sabhi shilp nirmaanon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Thousands of human, animal and divine people are seen working in this life-like fair, in which there is a confluence of realism
 yah urisa kii sarvottam kriti he
 Its exquisite craftsmanship, carvings, and accurate display of animal and human figures prove it far superior to other temples
 yah surya mandir bhartiya mandiron kii kaling style kaa he, jisamen koniya attalika ke upar mandap kii tarah chhatari dhaki hoti he
 In shape, this temple does not seem to be much different from other Shikhar temples in Orissa
 229 feet ooncha mukhya garbhagrih 128 feet oonchi naatyashaala ke saath hi bana he
 It has many figures protruding from outside
 mukhya garbh main pradhan devtaa kaa vaas tha, kintu vah ab dhwast ho chukaa he
 The theater is still full
 nat mandir evam bhoga mandap ke kuch hi bhaag dhwast hue hai
 The main courtyard of the temple is 857 feet x 540 feet
 yah mandir purv –pashchim disha main bana he
 The temple is surrounded by natural greenery

 ek katha ke anusaar, gang vansh ke raja nrisingh dev pratham ne apane vansh kaa varchasv siddh karne hetu, rajasi ghoshnaa se mandir nirmaan kaa aadesh diya
 The army of twelve hundred architects and artisans built it with twelve years of tireless work with their creative talent and full of energy
 raja ne pehle hi apane rajya ke baarah varshon kii kar-prapti ke baraabar dhan vyay kar diya tha
 But the completeness of the construction was nowhere to be seen
 tab raja ne ek nishchit tithi tak kaary purna karne kaa kadaa aadesh diya
 Under the supervision of Bisu Maharana, this team of architects had already put all their skills
 tab bisu maharana kaa baarah varshiya putr, dharm paad aage aayaa
 He thoroughly inspected the construction till then, although he did not have practical knowledge of temple construction, he had studied the scriptures of temple architecture thoroughly
 usne mandir ke antim kendriya shila ko lagane kii samasya suzav kaa prastaav diya
 He surprised everyone by doing this
 lekin iske turant baad hi is vilakshan pratibhavan kaa shav sagar tat par mila
 It is said that Dharmapada even gave his life for the benefit of his caste

 abul mujaffar muhiuddeen mohammad aurangzeb alamgir jise aamtaur par aurangzeb yaa alamgir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha bharat par rajya karne vaala chatha mogul shaasha tha
 His reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707
 aurangzeb ne bhartiya upmahadweep par aadhi sadi se bhi zyada samay tak rajya kiya
 He was the longest reigning Mughal ruler after Akbar
 apane jeevankaal main usne dakshini bharat main mogul samrajya kaa vistaar karne kaa bharsak prayaas kiya par uski mrityu ke pashchaat mogul samrajya sikudne laga
 The Mughal Empire reached the climax of its expansion under Aurangzeb's rule
 wo apane samay kaa shaayad sabase dhani or shaatishalee vyakti tha jisane apane jeevankaal main dakshin bharat main praapt vijayon ke jariye mogul samrajya ko saadhe baarah lakh varg mile main failaayaa or 15 karod logon par shashan kiya jo kii duniya kii aabaadi kaa 1 / 4 tha
 Aurangzeb imposed fatwa-e-alamgiri on the entire empire and also imposed an additional tax on non-muslims for some time
 gair-musalmaan janata par shariat lagu karne vaala wo pehla musalmaan shaasha tha
 During his reign, the Mughals had the highest number of Hindus among their court
 or sikhon ke guru teg bahadur ko darashikoh ke saath milakar baghaavat ke jurm main mrityudand diya gaya tha
 Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618 in Dahod, Gujarat
 wo shahjahan or mumtaz mahal kii chhathi santan or teesraa betaa tha
 His father was the Subedar of Gujarat at that time
 june 1626 main jab uske pita dwaara kiya gaya vidroh asafal ho gaya to aurangzeb or uske bhai daara shukoh ko unke dada jahangir ke lahore vaale darbar main nur jahaan dwaara bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya
 Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra Fort on 26 February 1628 when Shah Jahan was proclaimed the Mughal Emperor
 yaheen par aurangzeb ne arabi or farsi kii aupchaarik shiksha praapt kii
 According to Mughal practices, Shah Jahan appointed Shahzada Aurangzeb as the Subedar of the Deccan in 1634
 aurangzeb kirki ko gaya jiskaa naam badalakar usne aurangabad kar diya
 In 1637 she married Rabia Durrani
 idhar shahjahan mogul darbar kaa kaamkaaj apane bete daara shikoh ko saunpane laga
 Aurangzeb's sister died in an accident in 1644
 aurangzeb is ghatana ke teen hafte baad agra aayaa jisase uske pita shahjahan ko usapar behad krodh aayaa
 He dismissed Aurangzeb from the rank of Subedar of Deccan
 aurangzeb 7 maheenon tak darbar nahin aa sakaa
 Later Shah Jahan made him the Subedar of Gujarat
 aurangzeb ne sucharu rup se shashan kiya or use iskaa sila bhi mila, use badakhshaan or balkh kshetra kaa soobedaar bana diya gaya
 After this he was also made governor of Multan and Sindh
 is dauraan wo faras ke safaviyon se qandahar par niyantran ke liye ladata rahaa par use haar ke alaava or kuch mila to wo tha- apane pita kii upeksha
 In 1652 he was rebuilt the Subedar of the Deccan
 usne golconda or bijapur ke khilaaf ladaaiyaan kii or nirnaayak kshan par shahjahan ne sena waapas bula lee
 This greatly hurt Aurangzeb as Shah Jahan was doing this at the behest of his brother Dara Shikoh
 san 1652 main shahjahan biimaar padaa or aisa lagane laga ki shahjahan kii maut aa jaaegi
 The power struggle started in Dara Shukoh, Shah Suja and Aurangzeb
 shah suza, jisane apane ko bengal kaa governor ghoshit karavaaya tha ko harkar burma ke arakaan kshetra janaa padaa or 1659 main aurangzeb ne shahjahan ko tajmahal main shahi khajaane ko karch karne ke zurm main najarband karne ke baad apane ko badshaah ghoshit karavaaya
 Dara Shikoh was hanged for treason
 aurangzeb ne kabhi bhi shahi khajaane ko swayan par karch nahin kiya
 The Mughals, especially since Akbar, had been lenient on non-muslims, but Aurangzeb was just the opposite
 aurangzeb ne jazia kar phir se aarambh karavaaya, jise akbar ne khatm kar diya tha
 He forced the Kashmiri Brahmins to accept Islam
 kashmiri brahmanon ne sikhon ke nauven guru teg bahadur se madad maangi
 When Tegh Bahadur opposed this, Aurangzeb hanged him
 is din ko sikh aaj bhi apane tyohaaron main yaad karte hai
 During the reign of Aurangzeb, there was a wave of war-rebellion-repression-climbing etc
 pashchim main sikhon kii sankhya or shakti main badhottaree ho rahi thi
 He eventually defeated Bijapur and Golconda in the south, but in the meantime Shivaji's Maratha army plagued him
 shivaji ko aurangzeb ne giraftaar kar to liya par shivaji or sambhaaji ke bhaag nikalne par uske liye behad fikr kaa sabab ban gaya
 After all, Shivaji Maharaja defeated Aurangzeb and Marathas in India increased their strength throughout the country even after Shivaji's death the Marathas harassed Aurangzeb
 is bich hinduon ko islam main parivartit karne kii niti ke kaaran rajput uske kilaaf ho gaye the or uske 1707 main marane ke turant baad unhone vidroh kar diya
 Aurangzeb's administration had more Hindus than other Mughal emperors and Shivaji was also involved
 mughal itihaas ke bare main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki duusare baadshahon kii tulana main aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sabase zyada hindu prashasan kaa hissaa the
 Historical facts show that during the reign of Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, Hindus constituted 24 per cent of the various posts in the army, other important posts in the court and various geographical administrative units, which rose to 33 per cent during Aurangzeb's time
 em athar ali ke shabdon main kahen to yah tathy is dharna ke virodh main sabase tagada saboot he ki badshaah hindu manasabadaaron ke saath pakshpaat karata tha
 a large number of Rajputs were appointed to senior positions in Aurangzeb's army
 maratha or sikhon ke khilaaf aurangzeb ke hamale ko dharmik chashme se dekha jaataa he lekin yah nishkarsh nikaalte vakt is baat kii upeksha kar di jaati he ki tab yuddh kshetra main mughal sena kii kaman aksar rajput senapati ke haath main hoti thi
 Historian Yadunath Sarkar writes that at one time Shivaji himself was a mansabdar in Aurangzeb's army
 kaha jaataa he ki ve dakshin bharat main mughal sultanate ke pramukh banaae jane vaale the lekin unki sainya kushalta ko bhaanpane main naakaam rahe aurangzeb ne is niyukti ko manjuuri nahin di
 Aurangzeb lived a holy life
 apane vyaktigat jivan main vah ek adarsh vyakti tha
 He was completely free from all the enemies that were common among the kings of Asia
 vah yeti-jivan jeeta tha
 He was restrained in eating, drinking, dressing and all other amenities of life
 prashasan ke baari kaam main vyast rahete hue bhi vah apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye quran kii nakal karke or tapiyaan sikar kuch paisa kamaane kaa samay nikaal letaa tha
 Not only Aurangzeb, one thing is said about all the Muslim kings of medieval India that none of them were Indians
 vaise ek str par yah bachakaana or bematlab kaa tark he kyonki 17veen shatabdi ke bharat main raashtra jaisi avadharana kaa to kahin astitv hi nahin tha
 Even after this, however, this thing does not apply at least in the case of Aurangzeb
 yah mughal badshaah pakkaa ucchwargeey hindustani tha
 Its simple logic is that he was born in Dahod, Gujarat and was raised like children of upper-class Indian families
 puure mughalkaal main braj bhashaa or uske sahitya ko hameshaa sangrakshan mila tha or yah parampara aurangzeb ke shashan main bhi jari rahi
 Columbia University historian Alison Bush says that there was an atmosphere of encouragement to Braj in Aurangzeb's court
 badshaah ke bete ajam shah kii braj kavita main khaasi dilchaspee thi
 He patronized some big names of Braj literature such as Mahakavi Dev
 isi bhashaa ke ek or bade kavi vrund to aurangzeb ke prashasan main bhi niyukt the
 The official writing language of the court during the Mughal period was Persian, but before the rule of Aurangzeb, the language prevailing between the emperors and the courtiers had become hindi-urdu
 ise aurangzeb ke us patr se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo usne apane 47 varshiya bete ajam shah ko likhaa tha
 The emperor had presented a fort to his son and ordered to be sung on the occasion
 ajam shah ko likhe patr main aurangzeb ne likhaa he ki jab vah baccha tha to use nagaadon kii aawaaj khub pasand thi or vah aksar kahata tha, ‘babaaji dhan-dhan!’ is udhaaharan se yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki aurangzeb kaa betaa tatkaaleen prachlit hindi main hi apane pita se baatcheet karata tha
 Emperor Aurangzeb acknowledged the importance of the religion of Islam, making the 'quran' the basis of his rule
 usne sikkon par kalma khudwana, nauroj kaa tyohaar manaanaa, bhaang kii kheti karnaa, gaanaa-bajaanaa aadi par roak laga di
 Banned the practice of sati in 1663 AD
 tirth kar punah lagaaya
 In 11 years of his rule, 'jharokha Darshan', in the 12th year, banned 'tuladan system', banned Hindu festivals in 1668 AD
 1699 i

 'muhtasib' was appointed by Aurangzeb in large cities
 1669 i
 main aurangzeb ne banaras ke ‘vishwanath mandir’ evam mathura ke ‘keshav raay madingr’ ko tudwa diya
 He abolished about 80 taxes levied against the Sharia
 inhen main ‘aabwab’ naam se janaa jane vaala ‘raaydaari’ or ‘pandari’ naamak sthaneey kar bhi shaamil the
 Aurangzeb considered converting 'darul Herb' to 'darul Islam' as his important goal
 aurangzeb ke samay main braj main aane vaale tirth−yatriyon par baari kar lagaaya gaya jazia kar phir se lagaaya gaya or hinduon ko musalmaan banaaya gaya
 Aurangzeb's atrocities are mentioned in the compositions of poets of that time
 aurangzeb dwaara lagaaya gaya jajia kar us samay ke hisaab se tha
 Akbar abolished the Jaziya tax, but it was re-enacted during Aurangzeb
 jajia saamaanya karon se alag tha jo gaiyr muslimon ko chukaana padataa tha
 It had three levels and it was determined by the income of the person concerned
 is kar ke kuch apwaad bhi the
 The poor, unemployed and physically challenged people did not come under its purview

 Such was the religious tax zakat imposed on Muslims, which was necessary for every rich Muslim
 aadhunik mulyon ke mandandon par jajia nischitarup se ek pakshpaati kar vyavastha thi
 Modern nations cannot make such a distinction on the basis of religion and caste
 isiilie jab ham 17veen shatabdi kii vyavastha ko aadhunik rashtron ke paimaane par ise dekhte hai to yah bahut arajak vyavastha lag sakati he, lekin aurangzeb ke samay aisa nahin tha
 Other examples are also found in that period
 jaise maraathon ne dakshin ke ek bade hisse se mughalon ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 Their tax system was also biased at about the same level
 ve musalamaanon se jakaat vasuulate the or hindu aabaadi is tarah kii kisi bhi kar vyavastha se baahar thi
 Aurangzeb had built more temples than he had broken
 vishwaprasiddh itihaaskaar richard iton ke mutabik mughalkaal main mandiron ko dhahaana durlabh ghatana hua karti thi or jab bhi aisa hua to uske kaaran raajnneetik rahe
 According to Eaton, the same temples were demolished in which the rebels were given shelter or with the help of which a conspiracy was made against the emperor
 us samay mandir todane kaa koi dharmik uddeshy nahin tha
 Aurangzeb, notorious in this case, also followed the same rule of the Sultanate
 uske shasankaal main mandir dhahaane ke udhaaharan bahut hi durlabh hai or jo hai unki jad main raajnneetik kaaran hi rahe hai
 Aurangzeb, for example, never targeted temples in South India, while most of the army was stationed here during his reign
 uttar bharat main usne jarur kuch mandiron par hamale kiye jaise mathura kaa keshav raay mandir lekin iskaa kaaran dharmik nahin tha
 The Jats of Mathura revolted against the Sultanate, hence the attack
 thik iske ulat kaarnon se aurangzeb ne mandiron ko sangrakshan bhi diya
 This was his offering to Hindus who were loyal to the emperor
 kings college, landan kii itihaaskaar catherine butler to yahaan tak kahati hai ki aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tode, usase zyada banawaye the
 Scholars like Catherine Frank, m Athar Ali and Jalaluddin also point out that Aurangzeb had given grants to several Hindu temples, including the movable Bari Math in Banaras, Balaji Temple in Chitrakoot, Someshwar Nath Mahadev Temple in Allahabad and Umananda Temple in Guwahati
 Famous names are
 jis kalkhand yani mughalkaal main mandiron ko tode jane kii baat itani zyada prachlan main he, usamen hinduon dwaara kahin is baat kaa vishesh zikr nahin miltaa
 It can be argued that doing so in those times would not have been empty of danger, but even when the Sultanate came to an end in the 18th century, there is no mention of this
 ateet main mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mandir tode jane kaa mudda bharat main 1980-90 ke dashak main garm hua 
 a big argument is also made in trying to prove Aurangzeb as fanatical that he had banned music, but this is also not true
 catherine bataati hai ki sultanate main to kya sangeet par uske darbar main bhi pratibandh nahin tha
 On the day the emperor took over the throne, every year there was a lot of dancing and singing in the festival
 kuch dhrupadon kii rachana main aurangzeb naam shaamil he jo bataata he ki uske shasankaal main sangeet ko sangrakshan hasil tha
 Some historical facts also point to the fact that he himself was well versed in music
 mirat-e-alam main bakhtawar khan ne likhaa he ki badshaah ko sangeet visharadon jaisaa gyaan tha
 Mughal scholar Fakirullah has recorded the names of Aurangzeb's favorite singers and instrumentalists in a document titled Raag Darpan
 aurangzeb ko apane beton main ajam shah bahut priy tha or itihaas bataata he ki shah apane pita ke jeevankaal main hi nipun sangeetkaar ban chukaa tha
 Talking about music flourishing during Aurangzeb's reign, Catherine writes, 'the highest commentary on music was written in Persian during the time of Aurangzeb, compared to the entire Mughal period of 500 years
 ’ haalanki yah baat sahi he ki apane jivan ke antim samay main aurangzeb zyada dharmik ho gaya tha or usne geet-sangeet se duuri bana lee thi
 But looking at the things we have mentioned above, it can be assumed that he never made his personal wish the official policy of the Sultanate
 aurangzeb ke antim samay main dakshin main maraathon kaa jor bahut bad gaya tha
 The imperial army was not getting success in suppressing them
 isliye san 1683 main aurangzeb swayan sena lekar dakshin gaya
 He stayed away from the capital, in the same campaign for the last 25 years of his reign

 On the other hand, environmental geography studies them as a natural disaster because it causes loss of ecosystems and life and property
 jwalamukhi Geologists are not unanimous about the activity, but if a volcano is currently erupting, or it is expected to burst soon, or if it has signs of activity like gas leaking, smoke or lava, or earthquake, then it Is considered active

 Eruptions cause severe earthquakes
 inhen visphot kii tivrata ke aadhaar par punah kai prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: In this type of eruption, the amount of gas with lava is small, which causes the lava to freeze on the ground through the crevices

 style kii drushti se lok bhashaa- style kaa unnayan is andolan kii sabase badi dein he
 Regulation and discipline of the governing style is relaxed
 vastugat udaattata pramukh ho jaati he
 Initially, the nirguna content is accepted
 parinamtah vishay- vastu se sambhddha bhugolic sthaniyata kaa utkarsh nahin hota or na kisi kshetreey bhashaa kaa hi vishay- vastu se sambandh hota he
 Only in terms of practical beauty and convenience does a mixed sadhukkari style take birth and a wider genre area begins to form
 nitant vaiyaktik kshanon main santon kii unmukt or taral chetana sthaneey bhashaa- rupon yaa bhavatmak sandarbhon main rudhstyli ko grahan kar leti he
 Thus other styles coexist with Sadhukkadi
 sagun vastukaram main bhugolic sthaniyata alamban ke bhavapaksh kaa ang ban jaati he
 The emotional and divine connections of Ayodhya, Mathura, Vrindavan begin to appear
 sthaneey bhashaaon ke prati bhi aisi hi ek bhavukta kasmasaane lagati he
 The vernacular-style-based style moves along the object's journey and begins to create its own independent genre - islands or colonies
 jab ramcharitra kii maryaadaayen, amaryadit divya shringaar- maadhurya main nimajjit ho jaati hai, nirgun vaani se nirgat rahasyamoolak shringaaroktiyaan apana swatantra astitv banane lagati he or rajashrith shringaar main radhakrishna ke pratik rudh ho jate hai, tab aarambhik sthitiyon main maadhurya- shringaar ke liye rudh brajabhasha style, anya vishay- vastu dwipon main bhi pravisht hone lagati he, anya bhashaa- dwipon main bhi vistaar karne lagati he
 The object structure of Briji also begins to impose on other object areas and the Brajbhasha style determines the boundaries of friendship style areas from other local languages
 sant- sahitya sadhukkadi style main likhaa gaya he
 The linguistic basis of this style is not that of traditional poetry or language
 khadi boli or rajasthani kii mishrit sanrachana par is style kii pratishtha hui
 Like the 2 Siddhas, double style is also found in saint literature
 sant kaviyon ke sagun bhakthi ke padon kii bhashaa to braj yaa paramparaagat kavyabhasha he, par nirgunbani kii bhashaa nathpanthiyon dwaara gruhit khadi boli yaa sadhukkadi bhashaa he
 3 yah dwividh shaileyojna namdev se lekar parvarti santon tak chalati rahi
 Sadhukkari style mixes Rajasthani, Punjabi, Khadi Boli and Eastern forms
 sant kaa vyaktitv ek paramparaagat, parinishthit style ko sweekaar karke nahin chalaa
 Khadi Boli was related to Kuru-district in terms of ancient style of geography
 shauraseni panchali style kshetra se is kshetra kii bhashaa sanrachana kuch bhinn thi
 The forms of Brazi and Khadi Boli are also found in ancient compositions
 in donon kii prakruti main aakarant- aukarant, ukarant- acarant kaa bhed pramukh he
 The nature of these two is similar in nature to Punjabi Kaurvi
 aadhunik rajasthani or braji main donon hi pravritiyaan milti hai
 The region of Kannauji is a relatively pure period style
 bhugolic drushti se punjabi or rajasthani ke kuch rupon ko samete hue, khadi boli style dilli ke aasapaas punap rahi thi
 The historical importance of this geographical area increased during the Muslim period
 yahan kii bhashaa- style ko prachaar or protsaahan mila
 This style was adopted by saints
 isamen braji ke rupon kaa nitant abhaav nahin tha, par mul sanrachana khadi boli kii hi maani jaani chahie
 Muslim writers should be given credit for adopting and popularizing this style
 sankrantikalin sant bhi muslim samskruti se pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main prabhavit the
 In the early nath-yogi tradition there is definitely a tradition of pure sadhukkari
 gorakhbani kii bhashaa- style kii mul sanrachana khadi boli kii he tathaa usamen purvi kaa mishran he
 The effects of Rajasthani are also not lacking
 saath hi gorakhanathji ne brajabhasha ke pad bhi likhe
 It seems that Briji was becoming increasingly used for poetry
 nath or sant bhi geeton main isi style kaa prayog karte the
 Theoretical discussion or nirgana-vani used to be in Sadhukkari
 jis prakaar bhakthi- andolan kaa sagunavaadi paksh braji kii style ko lekar chal rahaa tha, usee prakaar nirgunavaadi paksh sadhukkadi ko apane prachaar kaa madhyam bana rahaa tha
 Perhaps the saint's personality was less familiar with the elegant or refined language style, but the nature of the narrative seems to be the main reason for the eclipse of this new style
 saamaajik khandan- mandan, nirgun- charchaa aadi kuch aise vishay the, jinako rudh madhyam vahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence a new style - medium was discovered
 yah bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kurukshetra main is style kii parampara pehle bhi prachlit rahi hogi
 Shaurseni - It was not important in front of the established style of Panchali region
 is parampara kaa pracheen sahitya bhi nahin miltaa
 Medieval Nath-saints and Muslim poets revived this style
 grearsan ne gujarati ko bhartiya aryabhashaon kii antavarti shakha ke antargat rakhaa he bhugolic drushti se bahirvrutt rahete hue gujarati kaa is prakaar kaa vargeekaran donon kshetron ke saanskrithik prabhaav evam sambandh kii hi sweekruti he
 Mythological evidence also proves the relationship between Mathura Mandal and Gujarat
 krishna samast yadavon ke saath dwaravati main jaakar bas gaye the
 The speedway of Abhiras also appears towards Gujarat in Madhya Pradesh
 aabhir jaisi hi ek shaq jati thi
 The spread of this caste was also from Gujarat to Madhya Pradesh

 Probably these were the worshipers of the Panchavirs - Krishna, Sankarshan, Balarama, Som and Anirudh
 peeche jain dharm kaa bhi mathura ek kendra ban gaya or gujarat or braj kaa sambandh bana rahaa
 The language of Jainism was also influenced by Shaurseni
 jain aagmon or parvarti sahitya krishna vaarta se anupranit he
 The relationship between Braj and Gujarat remained close even during the rise of Vaishnavism
 vallabh sampradaay kaa yah sabase pramukh prabhaav- kshetra rahaa he or aaj bhi he
 The culture of Gujarat and the culture of Braj was not only equitable and close, the regional languages and literature also came very close to each other
 gujarat kii aarambhik rachanaaon main shauraseni apbhransh kii spasht chaaya he
 There is also the influence of Brajbhasha on the language of poets like Narsi, Keshavdas etc
 and they have also written sputum poetry in Briji
 hemchandra ke shauraseni ke udaahranon kii bhashaa ko brajabhasha kii purvapithika mana janaa chahie
 4 gujarat ke anek kaviyon ne brajabhasha athwa braji mishrit bhashaa main kavita kii
 The names of poets like Bhalan, Keshavdas and Arva are notable in this regard
 brahmadev kii ek kriti main bhi brajabhasha kaa ek pad nikalataa he
 Lakshmidas composed the Sphuta posts in Brajbhasha
 krishnadas kaa naam bhi is suchi main mahatvapurn he
 The language of Narsi Mehta is influenced by the traditional Western Apabhramsa, which brings her closer to Braj Bhasha
 inhone brajabhasha main bhi padon kii rachana kii
 The octogenarian poet Krishnadas was also from Gujarat
 inke pashchaat to gujarat main brajabhasha kaviyon kii ek deergh parampara hi ban jaati he
 Which lasts till the twentieth century
 gujarat ke rajdarbaron main bhi brajabhasha ke kavi samaadrut rahe
 Thus, Brajbhasha became a personal style for Gujarati poets
 malwa or gujarat ko ek saath ullekh karne kii parampara braj ke loksahitya main bhi milti he
 In many songs, there are lines like Sagara Tau Dhoondhayou Maluvo and Sabu Dhoondhi Gujarat
 gujarat, malwa or braj ke parsparik sambandh kii chetana braj ke saamanyajan ko bhi thi
 Munj was related to Malwa

 Some scholars believe that these couplets were popular in Madhya Pradesh or Braj

 The apabhramsa compositions compiled in his Saraswati Kanthabharana also have the influence of Braj's language-nature
 kuch panktiyaan to brajabhasha ke atyant nikat hai
 "gwaliori" has also been used for Braj Bhasha
 jayakirti ne "krishna rukmini kii bel' kii tikaa main "gualeri' kaa prayog bhashaa ke sambandh main ek pracheen prachlit doha ullikhit kiya he 5
 Braj - Gwalior is considered one end of a border of the country
 gwaliori bhashaa or brajabhasha is drushti se ek duusari ke paryaay hai
 Lallulal has called Gwalior a saras
 sambhawatah: braj bundeli sammilit kshetra main gwaliori kaa vikaas hua tha
 In ancient times, the region gave birth to many poets
 hariharnivas dvivedi ne brajabhasha style kaa janm gwalior main mana he
 His opinion is as follows - Hindi developed in Bundelkhand from 11th to 15th was adopted by poets in 16th, 17th, 18th century
 yadi is jhagade ko chhod den ki brajabhasha style kaa janm gwalior main hua yaa mathura ke aas- paas, to aasaani se yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he ki brajabhasha style kii seemayen vistrut thim
 The situation in both Gwalior and Mathura was in this style area
 gwalior sadaa se brajakshetra main mana jaataa rahaa he
 Dr
 Grierson has placed northwestern Gwalior in Brajkshetra and the language here is considered as Briji
 yah style shauraseni parampara main aati he
 There is no doubt that the structure of Briji and Bundeli is often similar
 saahitiyik style to donon kshetron kii bilkul samaan rahi
 The cultural connection between Braj and Bundelkhand has also been constant
 brajabhasha kaa ek naam gwaliori bhi ho gaya tha
 It appears that the Gwalior region was the area of musical use of Braj Bhasha
 maansingh tomars dwaara pravartit dhrupad kii rachana sambhawatah isi kshetra main hui
 The name "sudesh" has come up in Mankutuhl
 is par tippanee karte hue hariharnivas dvivedi ne likhaa he -- sudes se matlab he gwalior se, jo agra kaa rajya kendra he
 The specialty of the Gwalior region lies in giving rise to the musical style of Brajbhasha
 vaise keshav, bihari jaise anek brajabhasha kaviyon ko bhi bundelkhand ne janm diya
 Tulsidas or Goswami Lalji's name comes to mind as soon as Sindh's name comes

 Shivprasad Singh, the language of the posts compiled in Guru Granth Sahib
 ek sthaan par inaki bhashaa ko mishrit bhi kaha he
 The opinion of the editors of Saint Namdev's Hindi version is as follows - Only the verses of the Guru Granth do not represent the Hindi creation of Namdev
 saikadon kii sankhya main anya pad bhi praapt hue hai jinaki bhashaa sanyat or surakshit bhi he
 Looking at all these compositions, it can be said that the language of Namdev is basically Braj and has influence of Punjabi, Rajasthani, Rekha and Marathi
 is prakaar namdev ke dwaara likhit saikadon hindi pad praapt hote hai, jinaki mul sanrachana braji kii he or prabhaav anya bhashaaon kaa bhi he
 Not only Namdev, other saints of Maharashtra region also created posts in Hindi

 ' chunki braj-bhashaa is samay tak saahitiyik rup se ek ucch sthaan grahan kar chuki thi or afjal ko mathura ke brajabhasha ke vaataavaran kaa purn anubhav tha, isliye uski bhashaa main us prabhaav kaa aana anivaary tha

 The total net worth is an estimate measured in United States dollars, based on the closing stock prices of the stock exchanges on which each person's company is listed, and exchange rates on February 11, 2008
 Stock prices are defined as shares of ownership in a corporation, and exchange rates are defined as how much one currency is worth in terms of another
 This list only represents each person's valuation on a single day due to daily fluctuations among exchange rates and stock valuations
 The list does not include heads of state whose wealth is tied to their position
 The following list is the ranking of the world's richest billionaires on February 11 2008, and does not reflect changes since that date
 The top three countries with the most billionaires are: United States with over 400, Russia with 87, and India and Germany with 56 each
 Notable-mentions lists those people who have been claimed by credible sources to possess fortunes to the tunes of multi-millions and billions but claims which have not been directly endorsed by Forbes
 These claims are well-referenced and credible
 This list is necessary because it is appropriate neither for Wikipedia nor for others to depend on a single-source to estimate the richest people in the world
 Former State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin claimed that President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, "is the biggest oligarch in Russia" and that Russian businessmen Gennady Timchenko, Mikhail Kovalchuk, Yuriy Kovalchuk, and Roman Abramovich are "looking after Putin's business interests and swallowing up a vast share of the nation's financial flows"
 Such claims have been supported later by Russian political insider Stanislav Belkovsky
 Economist Anders Åslund, author of "russia's Capitalist Revolution", described this story in his Moscow Times article: When asked at a press conference on February 14, 2008 if these allegations were true, Putin was quoted as saying the following in response: "this is true

 jab gehun ke beej ko acchhee upjau jameen main boyaa jaataa he to kuch hi dinon main vah ankurit hokar badhane lagata he or usamen pattiyaan nikalne lagati he
 When this germination becomes of five-six leaves, this part of the sprouted seed is called wheat sorghum
 aushadhiy vigyaan main gehun kaa yah jwara kaaphi upyogi siddh hua he
 Wheatgrass juice has the ability to fight many diseases like cancer
 prakruti ne hamen swasth, urjavan, nirogi or ayushmaan rahane ke liye hamen anek prakaar ke paushtik fal, phool, mewa, tarkariyaan, jadi-bootiyaan, masaale, shahad or anya khadyann diye hai
 One such lifespan of Sanjivani is wheat sorghum
 iskaa vanaspatik naam “triticam vesticum” he
 Dr
 N
 Vigmore calls the sorghum juice "green blood"
 ise gehun kaa jwara yaa ghaas kahana thik nahin hoga
 This is actually sprouted wheat
 gehun kaa jwara ek sajiv, supachya, paushtik or sampurna aahaar he
 It is rich in chlorophyll, fermenters, amino acids, sugars, fats, vitamins and minerals
 chlorophyl suryaprakash kaa pehla utpaada he atah isamen sabase zyada surya kii urja hoti he or bharpoor oxigen bhi
 Wheat sorghum is the best source of chlorophyll
 isamen sabhi vitamins prachur maatra main hote hai jaise vitamin e, bi1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12 or 17 ; si, i tathaa ke
 It contains calcium, magnesium, iodine, selenium, iron, zinc and many other minerals
 letrial yaa vitamin bi-17 balavaan cancerrodhi he or mexico ke oysis of hope chikitsaalay main pichley pachaas varsh se letrial ke injection, goliyon or aahaar chikitsa se cancer ke rogiyon kaa upachaar hota aa rahaa he
 Since ancient times, doctors of India have been using wheat sorghum in the treatment of various diseases like osteoarthritis, cancer, skin diseases, obesity, diabetes etc
 hamaare kai tyoharon par gehun ke jwaron ko ugane, puja karne ke rivaaj sadiyon se chale aa rahe hai
 Like Gangaur is a festival celebrated by virgins and suhagins in many states of India like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh, which is celebrated with great pomp
 pehle din caitra krishna gyaras ko mataji kii 'mooth' rakhi jaati he
 Wheat sorghum is sown in small bamboo baskets
 jware vaali paramparaagat jagah ko mataji kii 'baadi' kehete hai
 Worship of Bari is done throughout the week, water is given in the tides and aarti is also done
 jware lahraane ke saath gram lakshmi gane lagati he- 


 and then Gangaur Mata leaves on Chaitra Shukla Chaturthi
 saji-dhaji shobhaayatra ke saath talab-baavdi par shraddha ke saath jware visarjeet kiye jate hai
 Method of treatment of wheat tides in Western countries Vigmore started
 bachapan main unki daadi pratham vishwa yuddh main ghayal hue javaanon kaa upachaar jadi-bootiyon, paid-paudhon or vibhinn prakaar kii ghaason se kiya karti thi
 Since then, he has made a hobby of healing and research of diseases by the use of herbs and various grasses
 50 varsh kii umr main dow en
 vigmor ko aant main cancer ho gaya tha
 For which he took the wheat sorghum juice and a raw diet and was happy that in a year, he became cancer free
 unhone boston main en vigamore institute kholaa jo aaj bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 From then until her death, she continued to treat patients with wheat sorghum and inadequate diet
 unhone is vishay par 35 pustaken bhi likhi hai
 It contains 8 essentials and 13 of the remaining 16 amino acids
 inke kaary sanlagn saarini main darshaye hai
 Some wasteful and harmful molecules are also formed in various metabolic activities in the body
 in anuon main electrons kii sankhya protons kii apeksha kam hoti he jisase ye ati sakriy tathaa asthir hote hai
 We call them "free radicals" and these opportunities steal electrons from our healthy molecules, this process is called oxidation
 electron kho kar hamaare swasth anu bhi mukt kanon kii bhaanti vyavhaar karne lagate hai
 And in order to cool the electron-dipstick of the protons sitting in their conscience, they leave their main job and go out to collect electrons
 is tarah nirantar electron churaane kaa ek shrankhla-baddh silsilaa shuru ho jaataa he, jisase hamaari ayuvruddhi kii gati tej ho jaati he, twachaa main jhurriyaan banane lagati hai or ham vibhinn bimariyon jaise ucch raktchaap, madhumeh, asthi-sandh shoth, parkinsons, cancer aadi kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 Free radicals also enter the body through our external environment and food
 mukt kanon se raksha karne ke liye hamaare sharir main anek anu jaise vitamin-i, vitamin-si, beta-caroten, kinvak aadi hote hai, jinamein kai atirikt electrons hote hai or jo bina asthir hue mukt kanon ko electrons daan dekar unhen niskriy kar dete hai
 These are called "anti-oxidants" or antioxidants
 hamen falon, subjiyon yukt achche aahaar se prati-oxikaarak praapt hote hai tathaa hamaare sharir main bhi kai prati-oxikaarak nirantar banate rahete hai
 Antioxidants are age enhancers and healers
 ye diene kii sanrachana main vikruti nahin hone dete hai, rakt vahikaaon ko swasth rakhte hai or twachaa ko yuva banaaye rakhte hai
 Wheat sorghum has many powerful anti-oxidants, but here we will describe four specific anticoagulants
 superoxide dismutage ek kinvak he jo koshikaon kaa jirnoddhar karata he or koshikaon kii superoxide se hone vaali kshati ko kam karata he
 Superoxide is a very common free radical
 yah twachaa kii donon paraton main paaya jaataa he or swasth fibroblast ke nirmaan main sahaayak hai
 sods increase the usefulness of zinc, copper and manganese in the body
 es o di utkrisht prati-oxikaarak or shoth nivarak he or mukt kanon ke prabhaav se banane vaali jhurriyon or twachaa kii jeernata ko kam karata he
 Researchers say that as we move towards maturity, the amount of SOD in the body decreases
 superoxide dismutage unamem vidyaman dhaatuon ke aadhaar par teen virgon main baante gayi hai
 sods are helpful in treating arthritis, male gland disease, cancer, corneal ulcers, burn wounds, IBS and the ill effects of smoking, radiation, and anticancer drugs
 isaki kriim chehre kii jhurriyon, jalane se hue ghaavon, twachaa ke ghaavon va gahare daag dhabbon aadi main bahut upyogi he
 It protects the skin from harmful UV rays
 gehun ke jware, broccoli, pattagobhi, jau kii ghaas or hare pattevali tarkariyaan iske pramukh strot hai
 Its injections, tongue-holding and enteric coated tablets and creams are available
 amashay main banane vaale amla ise niskriy kar dete hai, isliye ise jeebh ke neeche rakhane vaali yaa anteric coted goliyon ke rup main hi diya jaataa he
 Muco-polysaccharides are a mixture of common and complex sugars that are important for body maintenance
 sharir kii koshikaayen nirantar kshatigrast or nasht hoti rahati hai
 The renovation of cells and the construction of new cells also goes on simultaneously, which will continue to be as young and healthy as possible with smooth and balsamic
 muco-policesreides khaastaur se hriday or rakt vahikaaon kii kshatigrast koshikaon ke rakh-rakhaav ke kaam ko praathamikta se karte hai
 P4D1 is a gluco-protein
 yah prati-oxikaarak kii bhaanti kaary karata he
 It has three main functions
 gehun ke jware kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv he chlorophyl
 It occurs in special types of cells called chloroplasts
 chloroplast suryakiranon kii sahaayta se poshak tatwon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 This is why scientist Dr
 Bersher calls chlorophyll a "concentrated solar power"
 vaise to hare rang kii sabhi vanaspatiyon main chlorophyl hota he, kintu gehun ke jware kaa chlorophyl shreshth he, kyonki chlorophyl ke alaava inamen 100 anya paushtik tatv bhi hote hai
 Everyone knows that human blood contains hemoglobin
 is haemoglobin main ek laal rang kaa dravya hota he jise hime kehete hai
 The chemical structure of heme and chlorophyll is very similar
 donon main carbon, hydrogen, oxigen or nitrogen ke parmaanuon kii sankhya tathaa unka vinyas lagbhag ek jaisaa hota he
 The only difference between the structure of heme and chlorophyll is that magnesium is in the center of chlorophyll, while hemoglobin has its iron in the center
 hamaara rakt halkaa kshareey he or uskaa hydrogen anu gunank ph 7
4 he
 Sorghum juice is also mildly alkaline and has a ph of 7
4
 isliye jware kaa ras shighrata se rakt main avashoshit ho jaataa he or sharir ke upyog main aane lagata he
 Wheat sorghum provides complete nutrition to humans
 saavdhaanee purvak chuni hui 23 kilo tarkariyon jitna poshan 1 kilo gehun ke jware ke ras se praapt ho jaataa he
 a human can spend his entire life just by drinking sorghum juice
 100 gram taaja ras main 90-100 mi
gram chlorophyl praapt ho jaataa he
 We get magnesium from chlorophyll
 hamaari prayek koshika main megnesium sookshm maatra main hota he
 But it is very important for the body
 sampurna sharir main lagbhag 50 gram megnesium hota he
 Magnesium is the essential mineral for the formation of our bones
 yah naadiyon or mansapeshiyon ko tanaav rahit avasthaa main rakhata he
 Magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of calcium and vitamin c in the body, functioning of the nerves and muscles
 calcium-magnesium santulan main gadabadi aane se snaayu-tantra durbal ho saktaa he
 Magnesium is required for the activation of about three hundred enzymes within the body
