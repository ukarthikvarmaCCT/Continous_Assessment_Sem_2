 The Wildlife Institute of India estimates showed that tiger numbers fell from 61% in Madhya Pradesh, 57% from Maharashtra, and Rajasthan by 40%
 The first census of the government started in 1973, organized under the initiative of tiger, the tiger project, is the year that counted 1827 tigers in the country
 Using that method, the government observed a steady population growth, reaching 3700 tigers in 2002

 The feeling that comes from juice is the permanent feeling of juice
 ras, chand or alankaar - kavy rachana ke aavashyak avyav hai
 Rasa literally means squeeze
 kavy main jo anand aata he vah hi kavy kaa ras he
 The joy that comes in poetry means that the juice is supernatural and not supernatural
 ras kavy kii aatma he
 In Sanskrit, it is said that "rasamiktam saktam kavyaam" means only the juicy sentence
 ras ant:karan kii vah shakti he, jiske kaaran indriyaan apana kaary karti hai, man kalpana karata he, swapn kii smriti rahati he

 yahi anand anya sabhi anubhavon kaa atikaraman bhi he
 If man is restrained on the senses, then he automatically turns away from the subjects
 parantu un vishyon ke prati lagaav nahin chhutata
 The use of rasa is found in Charaka, Sushruta in the sense of essence
 duusare arth main, avyav tatva ke rup main miltaa he
 Everything is destroyed, it is wasted, but whatever remains in the form and object, it is the juice

 naatyashaastra main bharat muni ne ras kii vyakhya karte huye kaha he - That is, the combination of passion, feeling, adulterous feeling results in the conclusion of the juice
 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do

 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance

 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 Once King Parikshit went to the forest for hunting
 vanya pashuon ke peeche daudane ke kaaran ve pyaas se vyakul ho gayi tathaa jalashay kii khoj main idhar udhar ghoomte ghoomte ve shamik rishi ke ashram main pahunch gayi
 There, Shamik Rishi closed his eyes and was calmly absorbed in Brahmadhyana sitting on Ekasana
 raja parakshit ne unase jal maanga kintu dhyanamgn hone ke kaaran shamik rishi ne kuch bhi uttar nahin diya
 With the influence of Kali Yuga residing on the golden crown on the head, King Parikshit felt that this sage is insulting me by pretending to be Dhyanastha
 unhen rishi par bahut krodh aayaa
 To avenge his humiliation, he picked up a dead snake lying nearby and put it in the neck of the sage and returned to his city
 daari naag rishi kanth main, nrip ne kinhon paap
 Hutto be promising, Ringi dinhon curse shamik rishi to dhyaan main leen the unhen gyaat hi nahin ho paaya ki unke saath raja ne kya kiya he kintu unke putr rungi rishi ko jab is baat kaa pataa chalaa to unhen raja parakshit par bahut krodh aayaa
 The sage Rini thought that if this king survives, he will continue to insult the Brahmins
 is prakaar vichaar karke us rishikumar ne kamandal se apni anjuli main jal le kar tathaa use mantron se abhimantrit karke raja parakshit ko yah shraap de diya ki ja tuje aaj se saatven din takshak sarp dasega
 Sometime after the tomb of Shamik Rishi, his son Ringi Rishi told him about the ill-treatment of King Parikshit and his curse
 shraap ke bare main sun kar shamik rishi ko bahut dukh hua or unhone kaha - "are murkh! tuune ghor paap kar daalaa
 For the slightest mistake, you cursed the godly king
 mere gale main mrit sarp daalane ke is krity ko raja ne jaan boojh kar nahin kiya he, us samay vah kaliyug ke prabhaav main tha
 People are happy in his kingdom and we keep chanting, austerity, sacrificing fearlessly
 ab raja ke na rahane par praja main vidroh, varnsankartadi fail jaayegi or adharm kaa samrajya ho jaayegaa
 This king was not able to curse but you have committed a grave crime by cursing him
 kahin aisa na ho ki vah raja swayan tuje shraap de de, kintu main jaanata hoon ki ve param gyani he or aisa kadaapi nahin karenge
 " rishi shamik ko apane putr ke is aparaadh ke kaaran atyant pashchaatap hone laga
 When King Parikshit landed his crown on reaching the Rajgriha, the influence of Kali Yuga was over and knowledge was reintroduced
 ve sochane lage ki maine ghor paap kar daalaa he
 i have done a great misfortune by putting a dead snake in the throat of a innocent Brahmin
 is prakaar ve pashchaatap kar rahe the ki rishi shamik kaa bheja hua ek shishy ne aakar unhen bataaya ki rishikumar ne aapako shraap diya he ki aaj se saatven din takshak sarp aapako das legaa
 King Parikshit gave the disciple a happy posture and said - "hrishikumar has done a great favor on me by cursing
 meri bhi yahi ichha he ki mujh jaise paapi ko mere paap ke liy dand milanaa hi chaiye
 You send my message to Hrishikumar that i am extremely grateful to him for his kindness
 " us shishy kaa yathochit sammaan kar ke or kshamayachna kar ke raja parakshit ne vidaa kiya
 King Parikshit resolved to spend the remaining seven days of his life in enlightenment and devotion
 apane samarth putr janamejay kaa rajbhishek kar diya or samast rajasi vastrabhupanon ko tyagkar tathaa keval cheer vastra dhaaran kar ganga ke tat par baith gayi
 Abandoned all his attachments and absorbed himself in devotion to Lord Shri Krishna Chandra
 unke is tyaag or vrath ke vishay main sun kar atri, vashishtha, chyavan, arishtanemi, sharadwan, parashar, angira, bhrigu, parashuram, vishwamitra, indramad, utathy, medhatithi, deval, maitrey, pippalad, gautam, bharadwaj, aurv, kandav, agastya, naarad, vedavyas aadi rishi, maharishi or devarshi apane apane shishyon ke saath unke darshan ko padhaare
 King Parikshit gave them proper posture by treating them all in a timely manner, worshiped their feet and said - "it is my great fortune that you have got visions of sages like gods
" maine satta ke mad main chur hokar param tejasvi brahman ke prati aparaadh kiya he phir bhi aap logon ne mujhe darshan dene ke liye yahan tak aane kaa ksht kiya yah aap logon kii mahanata he
 i wish that i spend the remaining seven days of my life in the best of knowledge and devotion
 atah aap sab logon se meraa nivedan he ki aap log vah sugam maarg bataaiye jis par chal kar main bhagwaan ko praapt kar sakun
 " raja parakshit ke vachanon ko sun kar sabhi atyant prasann huye or yathayogy unki ichha ko purna karne kaa nishchay kar liya
 At the same time, the son of Vyas Rishi, the supreme scientist Shri Shukdev Ji died without birth
 samast rishiyon sahit raja parakshit unke sammaan main uth kar khadey ho gayi or unhen pranaam kiya
 After that, Ardhya, Padya and Mala etc
 worshiped Shri Shukdev ji as bright as the sun and provided high seas for sitting
 unke baithne ke baad anya rishi bhi apane apane asana par baith gayi
 After taking everyone's seat, King Parikshit said in a sweet voice - "O Brahmarup Yogeshwar! o Mahabhaga! The way the demons flee in front of Lord Narayana, in the same way, great sins also arise from your presence without any reason
 aap jaise yogeshwar ke darshan atyant durlabh he par aapane swayan meri mrityu ke samay padhaar kar mujh paapi ko darshan dekar mujhe mere sampoorn paapon se mukt kar diya he
 You are also the guru of yogis, you have attained ultimate accomplishment
 atah krupa karke yah bataaiye ki maranasann praani ke liye kya kartavya he? use kis katha kaa shravan, kis devtaa kaa jap, anushthan, samaran tathaa bhajan karnaa chaiye or kin kin baton kaa tyaag kar dena chaiye? All the sages gave thanks for asking these questions of King Parikshit and requested Mahayogi Shri Shukdev ji to answer their questions
 samast dharmon ke gyaata paramgyani shri shukdev ji jinhone naal chhedan ke samay se hi is sansar kii maaya ko tyaag kar paramhans vrath se brahmagyaan praapt kiya he unke prashnon kaa uttar dene ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 Mahayogeshwar Shri Shukdev Ji said - "O King Parikshit! As a king you are concerned about your welfare as well as the welfare of all, that's why you have asked this very best question
 isse tumhaare kalyaan ke saath hi saath dusron kaa bhi kalyaan avashya hi hoga
 After taking birth, a human gets trapped in the magic of the world and he does not get the real benefit of human vagina

 The ignorant person understands everything from woman, son, body, wealth, property etc
 vah murkh pagal kii bhanti unamem ram jaataa he or unke moh main apni mrityu se bhaybheet rahata he par ant main mrityu kaa grass ho kar chalaa jaataa he
 Human beings should not be scared and distraught when death comes
 us samay apane gyaan se vairaygy lekar sampoorn moh ko dur kar lenaa chaiye
 Tame your senses and remove them from worldly desires and stabilize the fickle mind like the flame of a lamp
 is samast prakriya ke madhya kaa nirantar jaap karte rahanaa chaiye jisase ki man idhar udhar na bhatke
 While meditating in this way, the mind is filled with the joy of Bhagwat love
 phir chitt vahaan se hatane ko nahin karata he
 If the foolish mind is not stable due to Rajoguna and Tamoguna, then the seeker should not be distraught and should slowly take measures to subdue him with patience
 usee yoga dharna se yogi ko bhagwaan ke darshan hriday main ho jate hai or bhakthi kii prapti hoti he
 " raja parakshit ne poocha - "he mahabhag! vah koun si dharna he jo agyanrupi mile ko sheeghra dur kar detii he or us dharna ko kaise kiya jaataa he?" In response to his question, Shri Shukdev Ji said - "O Parikshit! The practitioner of yoga practice should first sit in the proper posture to subdue his body
 tatpashchaat kriya shakti ko vash main karne ke liye pranayam kaa saadhan karnaa chaiye
 At the same time, senses should be given up under their control after renouncing the subject and desires
 phir gyaan kaa prayog kar man ko chaaron ore se is prakaar samet lenaa chaiye jaise ki kachuva apane sir pair ko samet letaa he
 After doing so, you should meditate on the great form of God

 However, a field study published in 2009 shed some light on this
 narontapu rashtriya udyaan main tasmanian dawilon ko nikatataa samvedak radio collar se sajjit kiya gaya, jinase farvari 2006 se june 2006 tak anya dawilon ke saath unki sahabhaagita ko record kiya gaya
 It turns out that all devils were part of the same vast contact network, with male-female interactions characterized by this during the confluence season, while female-female interactions were common at most other times, although frequency and patterns of contact were clearly The seasons did not vary between seasons
 pehle sochaa jaataa tha ki ve bhojan par ladate the, naron ne shaayad hi kabhi duusare nar se baatcheet kii thi
 Therefore, all devils in a region are part of a single social network
 ve saamaanya rup se gaiyr kshetreey maane jate hai, kintu maadaaen apni gufaaon ke aasapaas kshetreey hoti hai
 This allows a larger number of devils to take over a given territory without conflict
 iske bajaay tasmanian dawilon ne grih seemaa par kabja kiya
 According to an estimate, between 14 and 28 days, the devils dominated the average of 13 km2 with a data range of 4–27 km2 
 in kshetron kii sthiti or jyamiti khaadya ke vitaran par nirbhar karti he, khaskar aasapaas ke wolebi or padimein lan
 Devils use three or four dens regularly
 purv main wambats ke swaamitv main rahi maadon ko unki suraksha ke kaaran prasuti maand ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
 The dense vegetation, thick grass clumps and caves near creeks are also used as dens
 vayask divil usee maand kaa puure jivan ke liye upyog karata he
 It is believed that because a safe den is prized, some may have been used by generations of animals for centuries
 adhyayanon ne sujhaayaa he ki khaadya suraksha, maand suraksha kii tulana main kam mahatvapurn he, kyonki awaas vinaash kaa duusare par adhik prabh kam mrityu dar par suraksha, ke rup main nivas ke vinaash he ki prabhaavon kaa prabhaav tha or adhik he uttararddh

 However there are also reports that an upper bound may be 50 km per night
 tikhi dhalaanon yaa chattani bhu-bhaag ko chhodkar, ve tarai, ghati or khadi ke kinaaron ke saath-saath, khaskar bani hui pagarhndiyon or pashudhan ke margon ko pasand karte hai
 It is believed that the amount of activity remains the same throughout the year except for mothers who have recently given birth
 naron or maadaaon ke liye yatra kii duuri main samanta yon dvirupi, ekaantavasi maansaahaari ke liye asaamaanya he
 Since a male needs more food, he will eat more instead of traveling
 Devils typically circuit their home range during hunting
 basti ke nikat maanav aabaadi main, ve kapade, kambal or takie churaane or lakdi ke bhawanon main maand main istemaal ke liye le jane ke liye jane jate hai
 While the diet and anatomy of dasyurids are similar, different body sizes affect temperature control and thus behavior
 In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 degrees, the devil was able to maintain body temperature between 37
4 and 38 degrees
 jab taapmaana 40 se badhaya gaya tha or ardrata 50% rakhi gai to 60 minute ke bheetar divil ke sharir kaa taapmaana do degree upar ho gaya, lekin iske baad dhire-dhire kam hota hua do ghante baad praarambhik str par pahunch gaya or do ghante tak ise banaae rakhaa
 is dauraan is divil ne pani piya or kisi prakaar kii takalif kaa koi lakshan dikhaai nahin diya, isse vaigyanikon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki pasinaa or vashpikarniya shithan ooshmaa apvyay kaa praathmik madhyam he
 a later study found that devils gasp, but do not sweat to remove heat
 In contrast, many other marsupials were unable to lower their body temperature
 chunki chote jaanwaron ko adhik garm or adhik shushk paristhitiyon main rahanaa padataa tha, jiske liye ve achachhi tarah se anukulit nahin the, isliye ve nishachar kii jivan style apanaate hai or din main apane sharir kaa taapmaana giraate hai, din main divil sakriy rahata he or uske sharir kaa taapmaana 1
8 degree badhata he, raat ke nunatam taapmaana or din ke adhiktam taapmaana main sirf 1
8 degree kaa antar rahata he
 The standard metabolic rate of a Tasmanian devil is 141 kj / kg per day, which is several times lower than smaller marsupials
 ek 5 kilogram divil prati din 712 kilogul upyog karata he
 The field metabolic rate is 407 kg / kg
 quol ke saath saath, tasmanian divil kii chayapachay dar samaan aakaar ke gaiyr maansaahaari dhaani se tulaneey he
 This rate is different from placental carnivores, which have a relatively high metabolic rate
 dawilon ke ek adhyayan ne dikhaaya ki garmi se sardi tak vajan main 7
9 se 7
1 kilogram kii kami ai he, lekin isi samay dainik urja upbhog 2591 se 2890 kiju bad gaya
 This is equivalent to an increase in food from 518 to 578 g
 aahaar 70% jal tatv ke saath protein-aadhaarit he
 Each gram of insects consumed generates 3
5 kg of energy while Walebi meat produces 5
0 kg
 khaadya ke sandarbh main, purvi quol ke bhojan kii tulana main, divil keval chauthai hi khaataa he, jisase khaadya kii kami hone par yah adhik samay tak jivit rah saktaa he
 The devil is the predominant species in Tasmania's ecosystem
 tasmanian divil ek chote kangaroo ke aakaar tak ke shikaar kar saktaa he, kintu vyavhaar main ve avasarwaadi hote hai or jitani baar ve shikaar karte hai usase adhik baar sada hua maance khate hai
 Although the ease of devil predation favors the vombat, due to its high fat content, it can eat all native mammals such as betongs and potoruses, domestic mammals, birds, fish, fruits, plant material, insects, tadpoles, frogs and reptiles
 inkaa aahaar bade paimaane par bhinn hota he or ye aahaar kii uplabdhta par nirbhar karte hai
 Before the extinction of the thylacine, the Tasmanian devils ate the thylacine's children left alone in the den when their parents were out
 isse thailacin ke viluptikaran kii prakriya tej karne main sahaayta mili hogi, jo swayan bhi divil ko khate the
 They are known to hunt mice in prey sea waters and find dead fish thrown ashore
 maanav basti ke nikat, ve juute chori kar sakate hai or un ko chaba sakate hai, or lakdi ke kaarkaane main aakar funs gai, anyathaa majboot bhed kii jhulati taangon ko kha sakate hai
 Other unusual materials seen in the devil's feces include the animal's leash and tags, the echidna's secure spine, pencils, plastic, and jeans
 Although devils can cut metal nets, they protect their strong jaws to escape from bondage instead of encroaching into the food store
 apni apekshaakrit gati kii kami ke kaaran ve, ve wolebi yaa khargosh kaa peechha nahin kar sakate, lekin beemaari ke kaaran dhimen pad gaye jaanwaron par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 They sniff a flock of sheep from 10-15 meters away and attack a sheep if they become ill
 takat dikhaane ke liye bhed bhi apane pair jamaa detii he
 There are reports that despite the lack of extreme speed, they can run from 25 km / h to 1
5 km and it is estimated that before the introduction of European immigration and animals, vehicles and death on the road, they have to find food
 Other native animals had to be chased at the proper speed
 pemberton ne bataaya he ki ve prati saptaah kai raaton ko "vistaarit avadhi" main 10 kimi prati ghanta kii gati se daud sakate hai, ve sthir hokar baithne se pehle lambii duriyon tak daud sakate hai, aisa kuch jise ghaat laga kar hamalaa karne kaa pramaan mana gaya he
 They can also dig to find the corpse, in one case digging to eat the corpse of a horse that died of disease
 divil, jaanwaron ke shavon ko khate samay pehle, sharir rachana ke sabase narm bhaag, unke pachan tantra ko khaane ke liye jane jate hai or khate samay ve praayah banaai gai guha main rahete hai
 They consume an average of about 15% of their body weight per day; However, if given the opportunity, they can eat up to 40% of their weight in 30 minutes
 iskaa matlab yah ki ek bade bhojan ke baad yah bahut baari or sust ho saktaa he, is sthiti main yah dagamagaate hue dhire dhire jaataa he or let jaataa he or us tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 This has led to the belief that such eating habits have become possible due to the lack of predatory predator attacks on such bloated animals
 tasmanian divil ek chote jaanavar ke shav ke sabhi avshesh saaf kar saktaa he, jarurat padane par fer or haddiyaan tak nigal jaataa he
 In this regard, the devil has earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, the speed with which it cleans the carcass, helping to prevent the spread of insects that may harm livestock
 inamen se kuch mrit jaanwaron kaa nipataara tab hota he, jab divil atirikt bhojan ko baad main khaanaa shuru karne ke liye ghaseet kar apane nivas par le jate hai
 According to a study in Cradle Mountain, the devil's dose may vary by male, female and season, in winter, males prefer smaller mammals in the ratio of 4: 5 than in adults, but in summer they prefer 7: 2
 Prefer larger prey in proportion to
 unki khuraaq kaa 95% se adhik in do shreniyon se puraa ho jaataa he
 Females are less inclined to target less large prey, but seasonal bias also occurs in them
 sardiyon main bade or madhyam standhari 25 or 58% prayek tathaa 7% chote stanpayi or 10% pakshi khaae jate hai
 In summer, 61 and 37% are consumed respectively for the first two categories
 kishor divil kabhi kabhi pedo par chadhane ke liye jane jate hai; kasherukeey or aksherukiyon ke alaava, bhringkon evam pakshiyon ke andon ko khaane ke liye kishor divil pedo par chadhate hai
 Teens have also been seen climbing trees and catching birds from nests
 puure varsh ke dauraan, vayask divil aple jaiwabhaar seven kaa 16
2% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se, joki lagbhag sara posam maance hota he, tathaa 1% bade pakshiyon se praapt karte hai
 From February to July, juvenile devils derive 35
8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12
2% from small birds, and 23
2% from possum meat
 sardiyon main maadaa divil apane jaiwabhaar seven kaa 40
0% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se praapt karti hai jisamen 26
7% posam or 8
9% vibhinn pakshi hote hai
 Not all of these animals were caught in the trees, but this elevated figure of females, which is higher than the spotted-tailed male quoll in the same season, is unusual, because the devil's skill at climbing trees is weak
 haalanki ve akele shikaar karte hai, samuhik shikaar ke apusht daawey kiye gaye hai jahaan ek shikaar ko uske awaas se baahar nikaalata he or uske saathi hamalaa karte hai, khaanaa tasmanian divil ke liye ek saamaajik ghatana he
 a solitary animal that collectively eats, this combination makes it unique among carnivores
 is jaanavar ke saath judaa hua adhikansh shor iske karkash samuhik khaane kaa parinaam he, jahaan 12 tak divil ikatthe hote hai, or aksar kai kilometak dur se suna ja saktaa he
 This is due to informing associates of their involvement in food so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is also saved
 shor kii maatra shav ke aakaar se sahasambaddha he
 Devils eat according to a system
 kishor godhuli bela main sakriy hote hai, isliye ve vayaskon se pehle strot tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Usually, the powerful animal eats until it is satisfied and leaves, fighting off any challenges in the meantime
 haare hue jaanavar khadey bal or poonch ke saath jhaadi main daud jate hai, unka vijeta peeche se kaat kar unhen khadedta he
 Fights are less common as the source of food increases, as they are aimed at getting enough food and not suppressing other devils
 When the quolls are eating a corpse, the devils try to chase them away
 chiththidaar poonch vaale quol ke liye yah ek mahatvapurn samasya he, kyonki ve apekshaakrit bade posam ko maarthe hai or dawilon ke aagaman se pehle khaanaa khatm nahin kar pate
 iske vipareet, chote purvi quol bahut chote shikaron kaa shikaar karte hai or dawilon ke aane se pehle khaanaa puraa kar sakate hai
 This is seen as a possible cause of the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls
 khate hue dawilon ke ek adhyayan main unki 20 shaareerik mudraaen pahachaani gai hai, jinamein unki visheshta krurtapurna jamhai tathaa khate samay sanchaarit karne ke liye divil dwaara upyog kii janevaali 11 bhinn awaajen shaamil hai
 They usually establish dominance with voice and physical tone, although fighting also ensues
 divil ke safed dhabbe sahyogiyon ko raat main dikhaai de jate hai
 Chemical signals are also used
 vayask purush sarvaadhik aakraamak hote hai, or kshatigrast karnaa aam he
 They can stand on their hind legs and push each other's shoulders with their front legs and head, like sumo wrestling
 Occasionally torn flesh near the mouth and teeth, as well as holes on the tendon, can be seen, although these injuries may have occurred during reproduction
 dacyurids main pachan bahut teji se hota he or tasmanian divil ke liye, khaane ko choti si aant main se guzarane ke liye siya gaya kuch ghanton kaa samay anya dacyurids kii tulana main lanbaa samay he
 Devils are known to return to the same place for defecation, due to doing so at a community location, the place is called Devil Toilet
 yah mana jaataa he ki saamudayik shouch, sanchaar kaa ek saadhan ho saktaa he jise thik se samajha nahin gaya
 The size of the devil's wings is much larger than that of the body; It has an average length of 15 cm, but also a sample of 25 cm in length
 ve haddiyon ko pachaa vajah se rang main bhure rang ke visheshta he, yaa haddi ke tukade bhi shaamil hai
 Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between the Tasmanian devil and the thylacine is "close and complex", as they competed directly for hunting and perhaps also shelter, the thylacine hunted the devils and the devils ate the dead thylacine, and Devils ate the thylacine's baby
 Mena Jones hypothesizes that the two species share the role of Tasmania's top predator
 keel-poonch chil kaa laash aadhaarit aahaar dawilon ke samaan he isiilie inhen bhi ek pratiyogi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Quoll and Devil are also seen in direct competition in Tasmania
 jones kaa maananaa tha ki quol ne apane ko 100-200 pidhiyon ke baad lagbhag do varsh main viksit kiya he, jaisaa ki dawilon, sabase badi prajati, chiththidaar-poonch vaale quol, sabase choti prajati purvi quol par baraabar rikti prabhaav dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Females usually start breeding when they reach sexual maturity in their second year
 is bindu par, ve saal main ek baar upjau hoti hai or kamottejnaa main kai dimbon kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Since hunting is abundant in spring and early summer, the reintroduction cycle of devils begins in March or April so that weaning time coincides with the maximization of food supplies in the wild for newborn devils
 Occurring in March, mating occurs during both day and night in shelters
 prajnan ke mausam main nar maadaaon ke liye ladate hai or maadaa divil prabhutv paane vaale ke saath sahavaas karti he
 Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and intercourse can be five days; For example, a pair is recorded in a rati den for eight days
 dawills, ekapatnik nahin hote hai or maadaaen sambhog ke baad raksha nahin kii jaati he to kai naron ke saath sambhog karti hai; nar bhi mausam ke dauraan kai maadaaon ke saath punarutpaadan karte hai
 Females have been shown to be selective in an effort to ensure the best genetic progeny, for example by driving small males away
 nar aksar, apni sathin ko maand main hiraasat main rakhte hai, yaa pani pine janaa ho te apane saath le jate hai, aisa na ho ki ve bevafaayee main vyast ho jaaen
 nar, apane purna jivan main 16 bacchon kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he, jabaki maadaaon ke jivan main ausatan chaar sambhog mausam or 12 santaanen aati hai
 Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and overcome the species with high mortality
 garbhavastha kii dar oonchi he, do varsh aayu kii maadaaon main se 80% ko sambhog mausam main unki theliyon main navjaat ke saath dekha ja saktaa he
 More recent studies suggest that the mating season occurs between February and June, not between February and March

 As with most other marsupials, the front limb is longer than the hind limb, has eye spots and the body is pink

 Tasmanian devil children are called by various names, "paps", "joyce" or "imps"
 When young are born, competition fierce as they move from the vagina to the sac in a viscous flow of mucus
 ek baar thili ke andar aane par, unamem se prayek agle 100 dinon ke liye ek nipal se judaa rahata he
 The female Tasmanian devil's bag, such as the Wombat, opens backwards, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with the children inside the pouch
 ek saath janmen bacchon kii badi sankhya ke baavjood maadaa ke keval chaar nipal hai, to thili main chaar se adhik shishu kabhi nahin pal sakate; maadaa divil jitani badi hoti he, ek saath janmen bacchon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 Once the baby makes contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the enlarged nipple tightening tightly inside the newborn, ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch
 On average, females live longer than males, and up to 60% of puppies do not live to mature
 thili ke andar, poshit navjaat jaldi se viksit hote hai
 In the second week, the nasalia becomes specialized and becomes heavily pigmented
 15 din main, ke kaan ke bahari bhaag dikhaai dene lagate hai, haalanki ye sir se jude hote hai or divil kii aayu das saptaah hone par hi khulte hai
 The ear begins to become almost black after 40 days, when it is less than 1 cm long and by this time the ears are erect, it is between 1
2 and 1
6 cm
 16 din baad palken spasht ho jaati hai, moonchhen 17 din baad or hont 20 din baad spasht hote hai
 After eight weeks the devils can start making creaking noises and after about 10–11 weeks the lips may open
 papoton ke gathan ke baavjood, ve teen maheene tak khulte nahin hai, haalanki palken 50 dinon ke aasapaas ban jaati hai
 Babies who were pink by this time start growing fur in 49 days and by 90 days the whole layer of fur is ready

 Just before the start of the furrowing process, the skin of the bare devil becomes black or dark gray on the tail
 divil ke aanan drudhrome or antahprakoshthik andap kaa purna set hota he, haalanki yah pakshaprishthak drudhrome se rahit hota he
 During the third week, the vertebral and endodermal axillary are formed first
 iske baad, avanetrakotor, antarshakhiya, adhyakshi or avchibukeey drudhrome banate hai
 The last four are usually between the 26th and the 39th day
 unki ankhen unka fer kot viksit hone ke kuch baad hi- 87wein or 93wein din ke bich- khulti hai or unke manh 100wein din nipal kii pakad se aaraam kar sakate hai
 They leave the pouch 105 days after birth, appearing in small copies of parents and weighing about 200 grams

94 semi piies kii lambaai, 2
30 semi manus, 4
16 semi taang, 4
34 semi agle pair or taj-dum lambaai 11

 During this period, the devil length increases roughly at a linear rate
 baahar nikalne ke baad, divil thili ke baahar rahete hai lekin ve lagbhag or teen maheene ke liye maand main hi rahete hai, janvari main aatmanirbhar banane se pehle oktober or disambar ke bich pehali baar maand ke baahar nikalate hai
 During this transitional phase outside the sac, young devils are relatively safe from predation because usually someone is with them
 jab maa shikaar karti he to ve ek aashray ke andar rah sakate hai yaa saath aa sakate hai, aksar maa kii peeth par sawari karte hue
 is samay ke dauraan ve apni maa kaa doodh pinaa jari rakhte hai
 The female devil is busy almost all year long, except for six weeks, to raise her baby

 In Guiller's 1970 study, no female died while carrying her children in the pouch
 After releasing the sac, the devil grows at a rate of 0
5 kg per month until it is six months old
 jabaki sabhi pille doodh chhudaane tak jivit rahete hai, guiller ne bataaya ki teen bata paanch divil paripakvata tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 As juveniles are more dusky than adults, their presence in the open during summer creates a perception of a population boom in people
 bhrun uparati ghatit nahin hoti he
 Guiller has reported that hostile devils have had frequent hermaphroditism, while Pemberton and Mooney recorded in 2004 an animal with a scrotum and a non-functional sac
 divil chehre ke tumor rog se hui pratiyogita main kami kii ek spasht pratikriya karne ke liye, rog prabhavit kshetron main maadaa dawilon ke ab ek varsh kii aayu main prajnan shuru karne kii adhik sambhaavna he
 The disease has made reproduction seasons less pronounced, with reproduction spread throughout the year

 There was a decline in widespread Tasmanian devils on all sides in Australia in the Old Age and they were banned in three residual populations around the middle of the Abhinav era around 3000 years ago

 The reason for their extinction is not clear, but their scarcity is the same time of indigenous Australians and wild dogs expanding across the mainland
 yadhyapi, kya yah logon dwaara pratyaksh shikaar kiye gaye the yaa junglee kutton ke saath pratispardhaa, yaa phir badhati maanav aabaadi dwaara laaye gayi badlaav, jo 3000 varsh pehle mahadweep ke sabhi ore, har tarah ke awaas kaa upyog kar rahe the, yah agyaat he; divil junglee kutton ke saath lagbhag 3000 varsh tak miljulkar rahe the
 Brown also proposed that the El niño-southern Oscillation strengthened during the innovative era, and that the devil was highly sensitive to it, with a short life span as a scavenger
 junglee kutton se mukt tasmania main, jab european aaye tab maansaahaari dhaani bhi sakriy the
 The thylacine is well known after the arrival of the Europeans, but the Tasmanian devil was threatened

 While thylacine was present, apart from hunting devils, competition for inadequate food and dens would have also pressurized the survival of the devils, with both animals finding caves and burrows

 It is difficult to estimate the size of the devil's population
 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main, anumaanit jansankhya 130,000-150,000 jaanavar thi, lekin yah ek adhik anumaan ke jaisaa prathit hota he
 The population of Tasmanian devils was calculated by Tasmania's Primary Industries and Water Department in 2008 in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 animals, with perhaps 20,000 to 50,000 mature animals
 visheshgyon kaa anumaan he ki divil ko 1990 ke madhya se apni jansankhya main 80% se adhik giravat kaa saamana karnaa padaa tathaa 2008 tak keval 10,000-15,000 jangalon main bache hai
 The species was listed unprotected in 2005 under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and in 2006 under the Australian Environment Protection and Conservation Act 1999, meaning it is at risk of extinction in the "medium term"
 aiusien ne 1996 main tasmanian divil ko kam jokhim / sabase choti chintaa main vargeekrut kiya lekin 2009 main ve luptpraaya ke rup main punarvargeekrut kiye gayi
 The first Tasmanian residents ate the Tasmanian devil and described it as a meat of calf when tasted

 However Guiller's research asserts that the real cause of cattle loss was poor land management policies and wild dogs
 un kshetron main jahaan divil ab anupasthit he vahaan murgi paalan ko nirantar quol dwaara maaraa ja rahaa he
 In earlier times, Valleby's hunting for Possum and Fur was a big trade — more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923 — and resulted in constant hunting of devils as they were considered a major threat to the fur industry

 This is not considered a sufficient problem for the devil to survive

 The decline in the number of devils is also seen as an ecological problem, with its presence in the Tasmanian forest ecosystem believed to be the reason for the establishment of red foxes, which were illegally introduced in Tasmania in the early 21st century Is, and because of the devils' eating of dead animals, it limited the number of foxes, wild cats and dogs, otherwise In den as killing adult foxes and young foxes that are their food
 In all other Australian states, foxes are a problematic invasive species, and in Tasmania, fox settling will disrupt the health of the Tasmanian devil and will be prey to many vertebrate species
 It is believed that young Tasmanian devils are insecure from eating red fox meat, and there will be direct competition for the den and habitat of those devils and foxes
 a common means of trying to prevent foxes is to use meat that is decorated with sodium fluoroacetate to trap
 As devils and other native animals can also be attracted to poisonous meat, which is placed inside the M-44 ejector device, adaptations have been made to the geometry of the device and the force and jaws required to open it
 Geometry, which fits the fox but does not fit the local species
 The foxes have not yet been fully established in Tasmania to intimidate Tasmanian devils

 At the same time, there was a greater increase in vehicular deaths along the new road; While there were no deaths in the last 6 months

 X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation and exposure to them can be harmful to health

 The measurement of the ionizing potential of an X-ray is called the unveiling: haalanki padaarth par insheel vikiran kaa prabhaav utpann aavesh kii apeksha unamem jamaa urja kii maatra se bahut kareeb se sambandhit hota he
 The measure of this absorbed energy is called the absorbed quantity: samatuly maatra, maanav utak par vikiran ke jaivik prabhaav kii maap he
 As for X-rays, it is equal to the absorbed volume

 X-rays are generated from the X-ray tube, which is a vacuum tube using a high voltage to increase the speed of free electrons by a hot cathode to a high velocity
 ucch veg vaale electron, anode naamak ek dhatvik lakshya se takaraate hai, jisase eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he
 In medical X-ray tubes, the target is usually tungsten or a highly resistant alloy of rhenium and tungsten, but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as in mammography when soft X-rays are needed

 The maximum energy of a photon of the generated X-ray is limited by the energy of the electrons that are equal to the voltage of the tube, so a tube of 80 kv cannot produce an X-ray with more energy than 80 kg electro volts
 jab electron, lakshya par prahaar karte hai, tab do alag-alag parmanvik prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he: Therefore the resulting product of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrolung spectrum falling to zero at the voltage of the tube and also several spikes along characteristic lines
 naidanik eks-re naliyon main prayukt voltage or is tarah eks-re kii ucchtam urja lagbhag 20 se 150 kevi tak hoti he
 In medical clinical applications, low-energy X-rays are unwanted because the body absorbs them completely, necessitating increased volume

 The most commonly known methods are photographic plates, photographic film in cassettes and rare earth screens
 chhavi main samavisht hone vaale tatwon kii parvaah kiye bina in sabhi ko "image receptor" ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Photographic plates were used to generate most radiographic images before the advent of digital computers and the invention of digital imaging
 in chitron ko bilkul kaanch ke platon par utpann kiya jaataa tha
 Photographic films largely replaced these plates and were used in X-ray laboratories to produce medical images

 While wet processing facilities were required for photographic films, these new technologies are not necessarily all this
 in nai takneekon ke istemaal se chitron ke digital sangrahikaran se bhi bhandaaran sthaan kii bachat hoti he
 Since photographic plates are sensitive to X-rays, they provide a means of recording the image, but they also require a lot of X-ray exposure, so the intensifying screen was designed
 ve rogi ko bahut kam maatra pradaan karte hai, kyonki screen, eks-re praapt karti he or isaki tivrata badhaati he, taaki ise intencyfoing screen ke aage rakhe gaye film par record kiya ja sake
 The organ from which the X-ray of the patient has to flow is placed between the X-ray source and the image receptor, so that the internal structure of that particular part of the body can form a shadow
 ye eks-re aanshik rup se asthi jaise ghaney utakon dwaara avaruddha ho jaati hai or mridu utakon se badi aasaani se guzar jaati hai
 The areas through which these X-rays pass, they develop a darker color as they develop, making the bones appear slightly lighter than the surrounding tissue
 barium yaa iodine yukt vipareet yogicon, jo radiopek hote hai, ko jathrantra path main antargrahit kiya ja saktaa he yaa in vahiniyon ko ujagar karne ke liye dhamni yaa shiraaon main pravisht kiya ja saktaa he
 These contrasting compounds have high atomic numbered elements that essentially block the X-ray and therefore a hollow organ or duct can be more easily seen once
 ek gaiyr vifaille vipareet padaarth kii khoj main, kai prakaar ke ucch parmaanu sankhya vaale tatwon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa tha
 For example, the representation our ancestors used for the first time was chalk and was used on the corpse of a corpse
 durbhaagya se, kuch chune hue tatv hanikaarak sabit hue - udhaaharan ke liye, thorium kaa prayog nirupan ke ek madhyam ke rup main kiya jaataa tha - jo kuch maamalon main vishaiylla ban gaya 
 aadhunik nirupan padaarth main sudhaar hua he or jabaki yah nirdhaarit karne kaa koi tarika nahin he ki kismen nirupan ke prati samvedansheeltaa he, "allergy jaisi pratikriyaaon" kii ghatana bahut kam he
 One increasingly common method is the use of photostimulated luminescence), which was introduced by Fuji in the 1980s
 aadhunik aspataalon main photographic plate kii jagah photostimulabl fosfar plate kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 After X-rays flow over the plate, the excited electrons of the phosphor material remain "trapped" in the "color centers" of the crystal lattice until they are excited by a laser beam passing through the plate surface
 During laser excitation, the free light is collected by a photomultiplier tube and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives the process its common name, computerized radiography
 PSP plates can be reused, and do not require any modification to existing X-ray equipment to use them
 prarambh main, sabase aam pataa lagane vaale tareeke gaison ke ynikaran par aadhaarit the, jaise ki gijar-mular counter main: ek cield wolum, aam taur par ek silinder, jiske saath ek abhrak, bahulak yaa patali dhatvik khidki main gas, belanaakaar cathod or ek taar anode hota he; cathod or anode ke bich ucch voltage pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 When an X-ray photon enters the cylinder, it ionizes non and forms ions and electrons
 is prakriya main electron, anode kii taraf teji se badhate hai, jisaki vajah se unke prakshepvakr ke saath aage chalakar ynikaran hota he
 This process, known as Townsend Avellanche, is detected as a contingency clause known as a "count" or "event"
 urja varnakram kii jaankaree praapt karne ke liye, vibhinn photon ko alag karne ke liye sabase pehle ek vivartaneey crystal kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This method is called wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
 failaanevaale tatwon ke saath aksar sthiti ke prati samvedansheel detectaron kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Other detection devices that naturally solve the energy, such as pre-determined proportional counters, can be used
 donon main se kisi bhi maamle main, upyukt pulse-processing upkarnon kaa upyog, baad ke vishleshan ke liye digital spectra ke nirmaan kii anumati detaa he
