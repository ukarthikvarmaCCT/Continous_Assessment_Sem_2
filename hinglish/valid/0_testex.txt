 arthshaastra saamaajik vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiske antargat vastuon or sevaaon ke utpaadan, vitaran, vinimay or upbhog kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The word 'arthashastra' is derived from the Sanskrit words meaning and treaty of scripture, which literally means 'study of wealth'
 kisi vishay ke sambandh main manushyon ke kaaryo ke krambaddh gyaan ko us vishay kaa shaastra kehete hai, isliye arthshaastra main manushyon ke arthsambandhi kaayon kaa krambaddh gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Economics is also used to understand how the economy works and how the economic relationship of different sections in the society is
 arthshaastreey vivechna kaa prayog samaaj se sambandhit vibhinn kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise:- aparaadh, shiksha, parivaar, swasthya, kanoon, raajnneeti, dharm, saamaajik santhaan or yuddh ityadi

 According to Samuelsson, british arthshaastri alfred marshall ne is vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘manushya jati ke rosemara ke jivan kaa adhyayan’ bataaya he
 Marshall had found that whatever is happening in society, economic powers are behind it
 isiilie saamaj ko samajhane or ise behatar banane ke liye hamen iske arthik aadhaar ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 According to Lionel Robinson the definition of modern economics is as follows- durlabhta kaa arth he ki uplabdh sansaadhan sabhi maangon or zaruraton ko puraa karne main asamarth hai
 Economics is of relevance due to rarity and alternative uses of resources
 atev yah vishay prerakon or sansadhano ke prabhaav main vikalp kaa adhyayan karata he
 In economics, it is natural for economic matters to be predominant
 parantu hamako yah na bhul janaa chahie ki gyaan kaa uddeshy arth praapt karnaa hi nahin he, satya kii khoj dwaara vishwa ke liye kalyaan, sukh or shanti praapt karnaa bhi he
 Economics also tells how happiness and peace can be achieved in the world by the economic efforts of humans
 sab shastron ke samaan arthshaastra kaa uddeshy bhi vishwakalyaan he
 The view of economics is international, although it also takes into account personal and national interests
 yah sambhav he ki is shaastra kaa adhyayan kar kuch vyakti yaa raashtra dhanwaan ho jaaen or adhik dhanwaan hone kii chintaa main duusare vyakti yaa rashtron kaa shoshan karne lagen, jisase vishwa kii shanti bhang ho jaae
 But all these works related to their exploitation cannot be said to be appropriate or appropriate to economics, because economics can only support those works by which the growth of world welfare can be done
 is vivechan se spasht he ki arthshaastra kii saral paribhaasha is prakaar honi chahie-arthshaastra main munshyon ke arthsambandhi sab kaaryo kaa krambaddh adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 His mission is world welfare and his vision is international
 jisamen dhan sambandhit kriyaaon kaa aadhyayan kiya jaataa he, arthshaastra kehalaata he
 The content of economics is indicated by its definition
 arrathshaatra vah vigyaan he jo maanav ke swabhaavik vaikalpik upyog karne vaale sadhano ore unke prayog ke madhya sambandh kaa adhyayan karaata hai
 Economics has theoretical and practical importance
 arthshaastra par likhi gayi pratham pustak kautilya rachit arthshaastra he
 Economics is a very ancient discipline
 chaar upved ati pracheen kaal main banaae gaye the
 The Earth Veda is also considered to be a Upveda in these four Upvedas, but it is no longer available
 vishnupurana main bharat kii pracheen tathaa pradhan 18 vidyaon main arthshaastra bhi pariganit he
 Presumptive and Cautical economics are available at this time
 arthshaastra ke sarvapratham acharya brihaspati the
 His economics is obtained in the form of formulas, but it does not include everything related to economics
 kautilya kaa arthshaastra hi ek aisa granth he jo arthshaastra ke vishay par uplabdh krambaddh granth he, isliye iskaa mahatv sabase adhik he
 Acharya Kautilya is also famous by the name of Chanakya
 ye chandragupta maury ke mahaamantri the
 His book 'arthashastra' is often 2,300 years old in the opinion of the pundits
 acharya kautilya ke matanusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra prithvi ko praapt karne or uski raksha karne ke upayon kaa vichaar karnaa he
 He has included many things in his economics from initiation of celibacy to conquering countries
 shaharon kaa basaanaa, guptcharon kaa prabandh, sena kii rachana, nyaayalayon kii sthapana, vivaah sambandhi niyam, daybhag, shutraon par chadhaai ke tareeke, kilabandi, sandhiyon ke bhed, vyuharachna ityadi baton kaa vistaarrup se vichaar acharya kautilya apane granth main karte hai
 Authentically, how many things in this book are outside the specified area in the modern period of economics
 usamen raajnneeti, dandniti, samajashaastra, nitishastra ityadi vishyon par bhi vichaar hua he
 The meaning of the four efforts in Indian culture is also included
 jain dharm main aparigrah kaa upadesh kiya gaya he
 Many ancient Sanskrit texts have praised or condemned wealth
 bhartruhari ne kaha he, 'survey guna kanchanam ashrayante' 
 Chanakyasutra says- arthshaastra kaa vartmaan rup main vikaas paashchaatya deshon main hua
 Adam Smith is considered the father of current economics
 aapane 'rashtron kii sampatti' naamak granth likhaa
 It was published in 1776 AD
 isamen unhone yah batalaaya he ki prayek desh ke arthshaastra kaa uddeshy us desh kii sampatti or shakti badhanaa he
 He was followed by Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Kaal Marx, Sizvik, Marshall, Walker, Taussig and Rabins, who wrote beautiful works on economics
 parantu arthshaastra ko ek nishchit rup dene kaa shrey profesar marshall ko praapt he, yadhyapi profesar robins kaa profesar marshall se arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main matbhed he
 Three parties certainly appear in Western economists regarding the field of economics
 pehla dal professor robins kaa he jo arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan maanakar yah sweekaar nahin karata ki arthshaastra main aisi baton par vichaar kiya jaae jinke dwaara aarthik sudhaaron ke liye maargdarshan ho
 The second group is of Professor Marshall, Professor Pigu, etc
, who accepts economics as a science, recognizes that the main subject of the study of economics is man and all the things which are needed for his economic growth, he considered all things in economics
 It is necessary to go
 parantu is dal ke arthshaastri rajiniti se arthshaastra ko alag rakhana chaahate hai
 The third party belongs to socialists similar to Karl Marx, who considers man's labor as the only means of production and seeks the advancement of laborers by destroying capitalists and landlords
 vah mazdooron kaa raaj bhi chahta he
 There is a lot of difference in the three parties regarding the field of economics
 isliye is prashn par vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he: After World War II, Cold War broke out in USA and Soviet Union
 yah koi yuddh nahin tha parantu isse vishwa do bhaagon main bant gaya
 America, England, Germany, Australia, France, Canada, Spain were side by side during the Cold War
 ye sabhi desh loktantric the or yahan par khuli arthvyavastha kii niti ko apanaaya gaya
 People were open to trade
 share bazaar main paisa lagane kii chhot thi
 Many big companies were formed in these countries
 in companiyon main naye-naye anusandhan hue
 Universities, information technology, engineering industry, banks, etc
 have all grown rapidly
 ye sabhi desh duusare deshon se vyapaar ko badhaava dene kii niti ko sweekaarte the
 All these countries have progressed well since 1945
 duusari taraf rus, china, myanmar, purvi germany sahit kai or desh the jahaan par samaajwaad kii arth niti apanaayi gayi
 Most of the industries here had strict government control
 udyogon se hone vaale laabh par sarkaar kaa adhikaar rahata tha
 Generally these countries did very little trade with other democratic countries
 is tarah kii arth niti ke kaaran yahaan ke udyogon main adhik pratispardhaa nahin hoti thi
 Even ordinary people had no incentive to make profit
 in karanon se in deshon main aarthik vikaas bahut kam hua
 On 3 October-1990, East Germany and West Germany merged
 sanyukt germany ne pragatishilath pashchimi germany kii tarah khuli arthvyavastha or loktantr ko apanaaya
 This was followed by the fragmentation of Soviet Russia in 1991 and the birth of 15 countries including Russia
 rus ne bhi samaajwaad ko chhodkar khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 China did not abandon socialism completely, but adopted liberal policies from the late 1970s and made great progress in the next 3 years
 checkoslovakia bhi samaajawaadee desh tha
 It fragmented into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1-january-1993
 in deshon ne bhi samaajwaad chhod ke loktantr or khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 The concept of value is central in economics
 isko maapne kaa ek tarika vastu kaa bazaar bhav he
 Adam Smith defined labor as the main source of value
 "mulya ke shram siddhanth" ko karl marks sahit kai arthshaastriyon ne pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this theory, the value of a service or commodity is equal to the labor used in its production
 adhikansh logon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mulya vastu ke daam nirdhaarit karata he
 This labor theory of price is closely linked to the "production cost theory of value"
 maang aapurti kii sahaayta se purnatah pratispardhi bazaar main beche gayi vastuon keemat or maatra kii vivechna, vyakhya or purvanumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 It is one of the most fundamental forms of economics
 kramash: bade siddhanton or praroopon ke vikaas ke liye iskaa vishad rup se prayog hota he
 Demand is the quantity of a product in a fixed period that a consumer wants to buy at a fixed price and is able to buy
 maang ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or icchit maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 Supply is the quantity of goods that a producer or seller is ready to sell in the market at a given price in a given time
 aapurti ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or aapurti kii maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 According to Prof
 Rabins, economics is the science that studies the functions of human beings which are present as the intended object and its finite means, which are used in alternative or at least two ways
 arthshaastra kii is paribhaasha se nimnlikhit baaten spasht hoti hai- Man experiences happiness from the fulfillment of his desires
 isliye prayek manushya apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karnaa chahta he
 The means, liquids, etc
 he possesses for the fulfillment of desires are finite
 vyakti kitna bhi dhanwaan kyon na ho, uske dhan kii maatra avashya parimit rahati he; phir vah is parimit saadhan dravya kaa upyog kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, according to the appropriate definition, economics considers all the functions of human beings, which he does by finite means to satisfy his desires
 is prakaar uske upbhog sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, how the means of purchasing many items in the market of a human being is limited
 is parimit saadhan dwaara vah apni aavashyak vastuen kis prakaar kharidta he, vah koun si vastu kis dar se, kis pariman main, kharidta yaa bechata he, arthath vah vinium kis prakaar karata he, in sab baton kaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya jaataa he
 When man prepares an object, the means of preparing it remain finite and he can use those means in many ways
 isliye utpati sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona swaabhaavik he
 Man has many desires to use his time
 parantu samay hameshaa parimit rahata he or uskaa upyog kai tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose a person is sleeping, worshiping or playing a game
 profesar robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar in kaaryon kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona chahie, kyonki jo samay sone main puja main yaa khel main lagaaya gaya he, vah anya kisi kaary main lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 In any work a human being does, there is a need for time, and the use of this finite means of time must be considered in economics
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha itani vyapak he ki iske anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa vivechan, chaahe vah dharmik, raajnneetik yaa saamaajik hi kyon na ho, arthshaastra ke andar aa jaataa he
 By accepting this definition, the explanation of the limitations of economics, politics, theology and sociology is not equal
 professor robins ke anuyaayiyon kaa mat he ki parimit sadhano ke anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa aarthik pahalu rahata he or isi pahalu par arthshaastra main vichaar kiya jaataa he
 They say, if a work is related to the state, then its aspect should be considered in political science and if that work is also related to religion, then that aspect should be considered in theology
 maan len, ek manushya chorbazar main ek vastu ko bahut adhik mulya main bech rahaa he
 Due to finite resources, the work that he is doing and what effect it has on the production or fulfillment of the object will be considered in economics; What is the duty of the state in relation to the perpetrator will be considered in political science or politics
 yah kaary acha he yaa bura, iskaa vichaar samajashaastra, achaarshastra yaa dharamshastra main hoga
 And, the idea of how to prevent this may not be in any scripture
 kisi bhi kaary kaa keval ek hi pahalu se vichaar karnaa uske uchit adhyayan ke liye kahan tak uchit he, yah vichaarneey he
 The second note to Professor Robbins's definition of economics is that he considers economics only as science
 usamen keval aise niyamon kaa vivechan rahata he jo kisi samay main kaary kaaran kaa sambandh batalaate hai
 These serious questions cannot be considered in what kind of changes should happen in the circumstances and what are the ways of changing the circumstances, because all these works are outside the science
 maane len, kisi samay kisi desh main sharaab pinevaale vyaktiyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 According to Professor Robbins's definition, the only consideration in economics will be how the increase in the number of drinkers will affect the price of alcohol, the drinkers and alcoholics themselves
 parantu unke arthshaastra main is prashn par vichaar karne ke liye gunjaaish nahin he ki sharaab pinaa acha he yaa bura or sharaab pine kii aadat sarkaar dwaara kaise band kii ja sakati he
 He lacks guidance in economics
 prayek shaastra main maargdarshan uskaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag mana jaataa he or isi bhaag kaa professor robins ke arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main abhaav he
 Due to this deficiency, the study of economics cannot be beneficial to the public
 samaajawaadee chaahate hai ki poonjipatiyon or jameendaaron kaa astitv na rahane paae, sarkaar mazdooron kii ho or desh kii aarthik dasha par sarkaar kaa purna niyantran ho
 They also consider these questions in their economics books about how a labor government should be established
 jameendaaron or poonjipatiyon kaa astitv kaise mitaayaa jaae
 What kind of organization of labor government and how their organization can be done world wide
 is prakaar samaajawaadee lekhak arthshaastra kaa kshetra itnaa vyapak bana dete hai ki usamen raajnneetishastra kii bahut si baaten aa jaati hai
 We should define the field of economics in such a way that it does not include the things of political science or any other scripture
 arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main professor marshall kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha par bhi vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he
 According to Professor Marshall, economics studies the ordinary work related to human life
 vah manushyon ke aise vyaktigat or samjik kaaryon kii jaanch karata he jinka ghanishtha sambandh unke kalyaan ke nimit bhautik saadhan praapt karne or unka upyog karne se rahata he
 Professor Marshall has increased the field of economics by placing the welfare of the municipality in the definition of economics
 parantu is arthshaastri ne bhi arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main apni pustak main kuch vichaar nahin kiya
 In the present day Western economists have increased the field of economics, but even today they do not accept the idea of economics with respect to the field of economics
 ab to arthshaastra ko kala kaa rup diya ja rahaa he
 Economic plans are discussed everywhere in the world
 aarthik yojana taiyaar karnaa ek kala he
 No plan can be prepared without a goal
 arthshaastra ko koi bhi sarvasafal nishchit dhyey na hone ke kaaran in yojana taiyaar karanevaalon kaa bhi koi ek dhyey nahin he
 Each scheme assumes a different goal
 arthshaastra main ab deshavaasiyon kii dasha sudhaarney ke tareekon par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he, parantu is dasha sudhaarney kaa antim lakshya abhi tak nishchit nahin ho paaya he
 In the absence of a well-known goal, there has been so much difference among economists that one opinion of two economists on a subject is difficult
 is matbhinnata ke kaaran arthshaastra ke adhyayan main ek badi baadha upasthit ho gai he
 To overcome this hurdle, Western economists should think seriously about the objective of economics in their texts and should, as far as possible, make a well-known goal of economics early
 sansar main prayek vyakti adhik se adhik sukhi hona or du:kha se bachanaa chahta he
 He knows that happiness is attained when his desire is satisfied and when the desire is not fulfilled, then he experiences sorrow
 dhan dwaara icchit vastu praapt karne main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, every person tries to get wealth
 vah samajhataa he ki sansar main dhan dwaara hi sukh kii prapti hoti he
 To get maximum happiness, he tries to get more and more wealth
 is dhan ko praapt karne kii chintaa main vah praaia: yah vichaar nahin karata ki dhan kis prakaar se praapt ho rahaa he
 The result of this is that money is also obtained by means of which others are exploited, others are hurt
 is prakaar dhan praapt karne ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 The capitalist does not give fair wages to his laborers in the worry of getting more money
 isse mazdooron kii dasha bigadane lagati he
 The shopkeeper destroys the health of his customers by adulterating foods
 chorbazari dwaara anek saral vyakti thage jate hai, mahajan karjadaaron se atyadhik sood lekar or jameendaar kisaanon se atyadhik lagaan lekar asankhya vyaktya ke pariwaron ko barabaad kar dete hai
 It is the unwavering law of nature that what one sows has to be reaped
 dusron kaa shoshan kar yaa du:kha pahunchaakar dhan praapt karanevaale is niyam ko shaayad bhul jate hai
 The wealth that you get by hurting others, you only get sorrow in the end
 usase sukh kii aashaa karnaa vyarth he
 It is true that the desired things can be obtained from the wealth which is obtained by hurting others and by getting these things, you can get happiness
 parantu yah sukh asthaayee he or ant main dukh kaa kaaran ho jaataa he
 There are many such things in the world, which brings immediate happiness by using it, but in the long run, they get sadness
 udaahranarth maadak vastuon ke seven se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, paratu jab unki aadat pad jaati he tab unka seven atyadhik maatra main hone lagata he, jiskaa swasthya par bura prabhaav padataa he
 This causes sadness in the end
 dusron ko haani pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt hota he vah nishchit rup se buree aadaton ko badhaata he or kuch samay tak asthaayee sukh dekar vah du:kha badhaane kaa saadhan ban jaataa he
 Money obtained by giving grief to others can never be a seeker of lasting happiness and peace
 sukh do prakaar ke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by hurting others
 inke udhaaharan upar die ja chuke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by making others happy
 ve manushya ke man main shanti utpann karte hai
 The happiness that comes from performing one's duty also gives peace, the labor that one has to do while performing duty, definitely brings some pain, but on completion of the work, that sorrow results in happiness and from that Peace arises in is prakaar kaa sukh bhavishya main du:kha kaa saadhan nahin hota ore is prakaar ke sukh ko anand kehete hai
 When pleasure is attained, then there is no more than just a trace of sorrow
 aisi dasha ko paramanand kehete hai
 Achieving ecstasy is the best goal of every person
 vahi aatmakalyaan kii charam seemaa he
 It is the welfare of every human being in this that he always tries to achieve ecstasy
 vah hameshaa aisa sukh praapt karata rahe jo bhavishya main du:kha kaa kaaran yaa saadhan na ban jaae or vah shanti or santosh kaa anubhav karne lage
 When we bring happiness to others through our efforts and become the means of their welfare, then according to the adamant law of nature, our welfare also starts to increase by these efforts
 aatmakalyaan praapt karne kaa saral upaay dusron ke kalyaan kaa saadhan bananaa he
 Similarly, not to hurt anyone through your actions is the simplest way to avoid your misery
 prayek vyakti ko yah acchhee tarah samaj lenaa chahie ki uskaa sachcha hitsaadhan dusron ke hitsaadhan yaa parmarth dwaara hi siddh ho saktaa he
 It is clear from this that the happiness of others ie Vishwakalyan is the only means of their lasting happiness and peace ie autobiography
 jab prayek vyakti apana kalyaan karne ke liye dusron ke kalyaan kaa hameshaa praytn karne lagegaa tab kisi bhi tarah se swaartho kaa virodh na hoga, sansar main sab prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho jayega or sarvatra sukh or shanti sthaayee rup se sthapit ho jaaegi
 It is necessary for autism that each person gives as much importance to the selfishness of others as he gives to his selfishness
 jaise vah apane sukhon ko badhaane kaa praytn karata he, vaise hi use dusron ke sukhon ko badhaane kaa bhi praytn karnaa chahie
 The result of this will be that such works will be stopped due to which the suffering of others increases
 isse vishwa ke jeevon main sukh kii nirantar vruddhi hone lagegi or vishwa kaa kalyaan badhate badhate charam seemaa tak pahunch jayega
 Without Vishwakalyan, no person can be autistic
 sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt ho saktaa he
 Autism is the best goal of every person and when economics studies the economic efforts of man, then his aim should also be autism
 parantu, jaisaa upar batalaaya ja chukaa he, sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the aim of economics should be world welfare
 ham yah pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki jab kisi ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Therefore, if there is no desire for anything, then there is no opportunity to get sorrow
 kuch sajjanon kaa mat he ki sampurna ichchhaaon kii nivruti dwaara du:kha kaa abhaav or sthaayee sukh tathaa shanti praapt ho sakati he
 Therefore, if seen from this point of view, then lack of all desires should be the aim of economics
 yah thik he ki abhyaas dwaara ichchhaaon kaa niyantran avashya kiya ja saktaa he, parantu aisi dasha praapt kar lenaa jab kisi bhi prakaar kii ichha utpann hi na hone paae, saadhaaran manushya main se ek ke liye bhi vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Astu, the goal of economics is to accept the lack of complete desires for the welfare of only a few people and the public will not benefit anything from it, so it will not be appropriate to accept this goal
 kuch vyakti maanavkalyaan hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanate hai
 They do not consider it necessary to take care of the interests of animals and animals
 ve shaayad yah maanate hai ki jeevajantuon or pashu pakshiyon ko ishwar ne manushya ke sukh ke liye hi utpann kiya he
 Therefore, if the desires of human beings can be fulfilled by hurting or killing them, then there should be no objection in making them sad
 kintu dharamshastra or mahatma gandhi kaa to yah mat he ki prayek vyakti ko aisa hi kaary karnaa chahie jisase 'saarvbhaum hit' arthath sab jeevadhariyon kaa hit ho, kisi kii bhi haani na hone paae
 When a person starts treating the interest of every living being as his own, only then he gets permanent happiness and peace
 mahatma gandhi ne is maarg ko 'sarvoday' naam diya he
 It is only through this Sarvodaya Path that every type of conflict in the world can be overcome, exploitation can end and world peace can be established
 sarvoday kaa maarg prayek vyakti kaa kalyaan ore vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi karne kaa uttam saadhan he
 Therefore, according to him, the aim of economics should not be to consider human welfare but only to believe in world welfare
 arthshaastra kii vishay saamagree ke sambandh main aarthik kriyaaon kaa varnan bhi jaruri he
 Earlier, production, consumption, exchange and distribution were considered as the four major parts of economics
 aadhunik arthshaastra main in kriyaaon ko paanch bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 On the basis of the purpose of economic activities, in 1933, Regner Frisch first divided economics into two parts
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinium, banking aadi samshti arthshaastra ke rup hai
 In short, from the point of view of study, we can put different parts of economics in this way: yah vaiyaktik ikaayiyon kaa adhyayan karata he, jaise vyakti, parivaar, form, udyog, vishesh vastu kaa mulya
 According to Bolding, microeconomics is the study of special firms, special families, individual prices, workers, incomes, individual industries, and specialty goods
 yah seemaant vishleshan ko mahatv detaa he
 Many important topics of modern economic theory such as international trade, foreign exchange, revenue, banking, business cycle, national income and employment theory, economic planning and economic development etc
 are studied under it
 boldig ke shabdon main, samshti arthshaastra, arthshaastra kaa vah bhaag he jo arthshaastra ke bade samoohon or ausaton kaa adhyayan karata he, na ki uski vishesh madon kaa
 He tries to define these groups in a useful way and examines their mutual relations
 sankshep main ye hi arthshaastra ke ang he
 Modern economists after Cannes now discuss various parts of economics by some new names, such as economics of capital, capital formation, labor economics, economics of traffic, monetary economics, canyon economics, economics of underdeveloped countries, economics of development , Comparative economics, international economics etc
 aadhunaki kaal main desh videsh main arthshaastra vishay kii snatakottar shiksha bhi inhen naamon ke prashnpatron ke anusaar di jaati he
 Economic system) is a system under which people earn their livelihood by working in various occupations
 aarthik kriyaaon ko sucharu rup se sanchalit karne ke liye prayek desh alag-alag aarthik pranali apanaataa hai
 Economic systems are mainly divided into three parts
 aadhunik arthik praniliyon main samaajwaad tathaa poonjeevaad kaa sarvaadhik ullekh ho rahaa he
 Every country, whether it works under any economic system, has to face various economic problems like poverty, inequality of wealth and income, unemployment, inflation and recession
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vah vibhinn nitiyon ko apanaataa he
 The main economic policies are as follows
 bharat kii arthshaastra ko jaanane, samajhane or prayog main laane kii apni vishesh panrapara rahi he
 It is a matter of sorrow that the major works of ancient and new Indian economists have not yet been properly evaluated and our students have been studying only Western economists and their theories
 pracheen kaal ke aarthik vichaaron ko ham vedon, upanishdon, mahakavyon, dharamshastron, grihmasutron, naarad, shukr, vidura ke nitigranthon or sarvaadhik rup se kautilya ke arthshaastra se praapt karte hai
 Among the main Indian economists in modern India - mahatma gandhi dwaara pranit tathaa acharya vinoba bhaave dwaara prayog main laai gai arthshaastra kii yah vichaardhaara ati aadhunik he or bharatiyon kii vishisht dein he
 Under this, there are ideas like Gramswarajya, Swavalamban, use of coexistence and non-violent revolution, which, in Jayaprakash Narayan's words, can bring economic revolution anytime anywhere in the world, not only in India
 inkaa prayog nai shiksha ke saath saath bharat main ho rahaa he
 Modern economics is tied up in more than half of mathematical models, practices, equations and formulas
 purv main sankhyikee kaa prayog arthshaastri aichhik rup se karte the parantu ab vah arthshaastra ke hetu anivaary ho gaya he
 Apart from this, econometrics is also being developed in full in development
 pravagic rup main 'in-put out-put vishleshan' se lekar arthshaastra ne 'game theory' tathaa 'technical flo' tak nikaal daalaa he
 All economists are using mathematical tools to clarify economic principles
 lenior programing' tathaa 'vibhedikikaran prakriya' ke antargat arthshaastri ganitiya drishy prabhaavon ke saath-saath adrishy aarthik prabhaavon ko bhi dikhaane kaa praytn kar rahe hai
 From the small machine of calculation to the largest computer, economists have practical forms of mathematical progress
 sambhavat: agle do teen dashak tak aisi vidhiyaan avishkrut ho jaayengi jinase ganitiya vidhiyon dwaara ati sankshep main keval nishkarsh praapt honge tathaa prakriya kaa koi bhi talmail baithaana aavashyak na hoga
 Nowadays economists are relying most on mathematical economics method

 In 1927, when Davison and Jarmar allowed electron rays produced by electron guns to collide with a large and single crystal of nickel, they observed that diffraction of accelerated electron rays by different voltages occurred in different directions
 eks-kirnon kii tarah jab unhone in electranon ke tarangadairdhyo ko sameekaran : m λ = 2 d sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle m \ lambda =2d \ sin \ theta \ ,} ke aadhaar par nikaala ; λ = tarangadairdhya), tab unhen gyaat hua ki in tarangadairdhyon dai ke mulya thik utane hi nikalate hai jitne di brogali kaa sameekaran : λ = h p { \ displaystyle \ lambda ={ \ frac {h}{p}} \ ,} detaa he

 The thin pages of the electrons are placed in the path of electrons in such a way that the electrons cross them and go out to the other side and the thicker ones are set up in such a way that the electrons collide with their surface and reflect at a very small angle

 Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan along with their supporters were put to death because of their involvement in revolution against the British
 lekin unki shahadat ko hapur ke nivasee aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The Martyr's Fair is organized every year since 1975 AD in Hapur to commemorate the revolutionaries who died in 1857
 jo 10 may se shuru hokar ek maah tak chalata he
 This type of fair associated with 1857 is not held anywhere else in the whole country
 choudhary jabardast khan kaa parivaar multah asoda gaanv kaa rahane vaala tha jo apni jameendaari hone ke kaaran baad main hapur ke muhalla bhanda pattee main rahane lage
 Chaudhary had seven brothers, including Zahir Khan, Samast Khan, Ulfat Khan, Amjad Khan, Groom Khan, and a sister
 malagarh ke nawab validaad khan tathaa choudhary jabardast khan ke madhya dostana sambandh the
 "the son of Nawab Walidad Khan was married to the only daughter of Nawab Muzaffarnagar
 baraat malagarh se mujffarnagar ke liye ravaanaa hui
 The procession was to pass through Hapur as it was on the way
 yahan aane par nawab validaad khan ne choudhary jabardast khan ko baraat kaa mukhiya banaakar bheja or swayan waapas laut gaye
 This incident confirms the friendly relationship between the two
 nawab mujffarnagar dwaara baraat tathaa choudhary jabardast khan kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 The procession stayed at Nawab Muzaffarnagar for more than two months, even the people who used to get the information of the procession are not allowed to return, due to which the number of the processions increased considerably
 nawab validaad ke sthaan par choudhary jabardast khan ne var ke pita kaa uttardatiytav nibhaayaa
 The Nawab was the only daughter of Muzaffarnagar, so the Nawab surrendered his entire property to his girl and son-in-law
 " Our guess is that Walidad Khan would not have been able to go to the son's wedding due to his involvement in some secret and very important work, and that this work would not have been scheduled in advance, but it would have suddenly taken place
 yadi is kaary vishesh kaa pehle se abhas bhi hota, to nawab validaad shah kii tithi peeche hataa sakate the
 Also, work will be of such great importance that at the time of marriage, they could neither postpone the marriage nor delay the work

 The evidence group under the then circumstances reinforces the presumption that the time of marriage will be around the spring of 1857
 is par vichaar karne se sahaj hi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Historians are unanimous that a sudden revolution erupted from Meerut on 10 May 1857
 atah aise main yah sakshyasangat na hoga ki iske prasphuton kaa validaad khan ko purv abhas ho
 Therefore, it can be easily arrived at the conclusion that the date of marriage must have been long before the 10th of May
 aisa maan lene par pita validaad khan ne apni putr kii shaadi main amuly samay nasht karne kii apeksha yah uchit samajha hoga ki yojanakaaron se sampark sthapit kar kranti main apni bhoomika nirvahan kiya jaye

 kyonki unhone kranti ke dauraan choudhary jabardast khan ke viruddh britaniyon kii madad kii thi, atah unki vinati ko wilson ne sweekaar kar liya
 When tremendous Khan was drinking water, he shot at his temple
 choudhary jabardast khan desh ke liye shahid ho gayi
 The British officer also ordered the confiscation of his entire property and the death penalty to other family members

 achal sampatti ke lenden main, ek varantee vilekh yah vaada he ki ek bhoomi ke kharidaar ke swaamitv kaa bachaav kiya jayega
 a warranty may be expressed or implied
 utpaada ke vikreta kii taraf se ek guarantee he jo us seemaa ko nirdisht karti he jabatak us utpaada kii gunvattta yaa pradarshan kaa aashwaasan kaa bharosa diya jaataa he or un sthityon kaa spashtikaran hota he jinke antargat us utpaada ko waapas kiya ja saktaa he, badla ja saktaa he, yaa marammat kii ja sakati he
 It is often given as a specific, written "warranty" document
 haalanki, vikreta dwaara maal ke vivaran or shaayad unke strot or gunvattta ke aadhaar par kanoonee niyamon se bhi ek varantee utpann ho sakati he or us vinirdesh se kisi bhi prakaar kii saamagree bhinnata guarantee kaa ulanghan hogi
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi utpaada kaa varnan karne vaala vigyaapan aksar express varantee se bharaa hota he; us utpaada ko vigyaapit vivaran ke anukool hona chahie
 kai vigyapandaata is uddeshy ke liye asveekaran shaamil karte hai 
 saamanytah, ek likhit varantee kharidaar ko vishwaas dilaati he ki us vastu kii gunvattta acchhee he or vah "saamagree or banaavat" main dosha rahit he
 An express warranty can be made verbally, in writing and without any intention by the seller to actually make the warranty
 sanyukt rajya america main, ek vikreta ko mulya ke liye apni raay banane kii anumati hoti he jise pafari ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jis par ek kharidaar saude ke aadhaar ke rup main bharosa nahin kar saktaa
 udhaaharan ke liye, "yah shikari chaaku duniya main sabase behtareen chaaku he" maatr ati prashansa he, jabaki ek bayaan jaise ki "is shikari chaaku ko dhar karne kii kabhi aavashyaktaa nahin he" ko ek express varantee ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he jab tak ki us chaaku ko uske icchit prayojan ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some other countries, consumer protection laws exist that prohibit advertisers from making untrue or inaccurate statements
 kisi prasiddh trademark kaa durupyog bhi ek express varantee ko vyakt kar saktaa he, jiskaa ulanghan "passing of" kehalaata he; maal ke strot or gunvattta ko galat prastut kiya gaya
 Some products have warranties under which there is a promise of a month, year or lifetime repair or replacement
 siddhant rup main, ek vyakti marammat ke liye kisi utpaada ko "dealer" ko waapas kar saktaa he, lekin adhikansh dukaane -or nirmaataa bhi- jo is tarah ke utpaadon ko bechate hai unke paas marammat suvidhaon kaa abhaav hota he
 Car dealers have repair shops that cause many people to buy new cars; Computer dealers and consumer electronics dealers used to have such shops in the 1990s, but most of them are now extinct
 abhyaas main, ek utpaada jo ek maheene ke bheetar vifal ho jaataa he use dukaan kii guarantee ke tahat nae dwaara pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he; yaa ek utpaada jo dukaan kii guarantee ke samaapt hone ke baad vifal hota he lekin jisaki nirmaataa kii guarantee baaki he use nirmaataa dwaara badla ja saktaa he - store guarantee or nirmaataa kii varantee paraspar anany hai
 There were once repair shops that provided warranty service for small electrical appliances, such as electric razors or lamps and toasters; But in the 1980s, most of those letters turned to forwarding service that sent warranty products to manufacturers to replace them, and most of them disappeared in the 1990s
 kuch apwaad bhi hai: kuch companiyaan - visheshkar toshiba - vastav main varantee ke antargat utpaadon kii marammat karti he
 Thomas Freedman explains how Toshiba built an arrangement to handle warranty operations in the case of UPS: a customer, who ordered a computer directly from Toshiba's website, sent the malfunctioning computer via UPS to Toshiba Can
 vastav main, vah kabhi toshiba tak nahin pahunchataa he
 Rather, UPS maintains its own Toshiba-computer repair shops
 jab upies, upyogkarta ke computer ko uthaata he, vah use upies kii dukaan par bhej detaa he, jahaan use thik kiya jaataa he, pareekshan kiya jaataa he or ek nirdisht samay seemaa ke bheetar upyogkarta ke paas lautaa diya jaataa he
 In general, the user's software and data are preserved
 ek nihit varantee vah hoti he jo vikreta ke vyakt abhyavedan kii bajaay saude kii prakruti or kharidaar dwaara nihit samaj se utpann hoti he
 The warranty of commercial use is implied, unless expressly denied by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase "as-is" or "with all defects
" To be "marketable", the goods must suit the expectations of an ordinary buyer, meaning they are what they say
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek fal jiskaa swaroop or khushboo acchhee he lekin jisamen chupe hue dosha hai, vah vanijopayogita kii varantee kaa ulanghan karegaa agar uski gunvattta aise fal ke maanakon ko puraa nahin karti jo "vyapaar main aamtaur par sthapit he"
 masachusets ke upabhokta sangrakshan kanoon main, gharelu upabhokta vastuon par is varantee ko asweekaar karnaa gaiyrkanoonee he aadi
 a fitness warranty for a specific purpose is implied when a buyer relies on the seller to select goods to suit a specific request
 udhaaharan ke liye, is varantee kaa tab ulanghan hota he, jab ek kharidaar ek maikenic se snow tair kii maang karata he or badale main aise tair praapt karata he jo barf main prayog ke liye asurakshit hai
 This implied warranty can be expressly denied by name, putting the risk of malfunction back on the buyer
 ek aaajeevan varantee, aamtaur par bazaar main ek utpaada ke jivan par hoti he na ki upabhokta ke jeevankaal par, 
 yadi ek utpaada ko band kar diya gaya he or ab uplabdh nahin he, to varantee ek simit avadhi tak lambi chal sakati he
 For example, the Cisco limited lifetime warranty currently lasts five years after the product is discontinued
 kul bazaar ke hisse ke rup main prayukt / second-hand utpaada bazaar kaa mahatv ikkisvin sadi kii shuruyaat ke baad se kaaphi bad rahaa he
 Second-hand products include products that have previously been used by a consumer / user
 upyogkarta apane utpaadon ko tab bhi badal dete hai jab vah acchhee haalat main hai
 Some products, such as computers and mobile phones, have a short lifespan and the technologies of these products continue to be marketed
 natijatan, nae utpaadon kii bikri aksar, badale jane kii vyavastha se judy hoti he, jisase second-hand utpaadon ke liye ek bazaar falit hota he
 For example, unit sales of used cars in France increased from 4
7 million to 5
4 million between 1990 and 2005, with new car sales falling from 2
3 million to 2
07 million units in the same period
 ek varantee kaa ulanghan tab hota he jab vaade ko todaa jaataa he; bikri ke samay jab maal vaisaa nahin hota jaisi usase ummid hoti he, chaahe vah dosha spasht ho yaa nahin
 vikreta ko us varantee kaa sammaan karte hue samay se paise waapas yaa vaastu kaa pratisthaapan karnaa chahie
 agar vikreta varantee kaa sammaan karne se inkaar kar detaa he to varantee ke ulanghan kii adalati shikaayat ke liye vah bikri avadhi sambandhi kaanoon ke tahat samay ko shuru kar detii he
 This period is often overlooked where there is an "extended warranty", in which a seller or manufacturer contracts to provide additional service to repair or replace goods that fail within that extended period
 haalanki, agar maal bikri ke samay hi kharaab the or sambandhit avadhi sambandhi kaanoon samaapt nahin hua he, to kisi bhi "vistaarit varantee" kaa astitv yaa avadhi dwitiyak hoti he: vahaan ek praathmik varantee kaa ulanghan hota he jiske liye vikreta uttaradaayi ho saktaa tha
 Attempting to avoid liability for breach of the primary warranty while claiming the termination of the irrelevant extended warranty can be an unfair and misleading business practice
 ek anubandh main avadhi sambandhi kaanoon kaa daawa ek apkrutya daawey kii tulana main chota ho saktaa he or varantee ulanghan ke kuch maamle der se daayar kiye jate hai or unhen ek dhokhadhadi yaa anya sambandhit apkrutya ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa he
 For example, a consumer buys an item that is broken or missing parts before it is removed from the package
 yah ek doshapurn utpaada he or use vikreta ko lautaaya ja saktaa he yaa badla ja saktaa he, bina isaki parvaah kiye ki vikreta kii "vaapasi niti" kya he, tab bhi jab is samasya kaa uddhatan "vistaarit varantee" ke samaapt ho jane ke baad hua ho
 isi tarah, agar utpaada samay se pehle hi kharaab ho jaataa he, to ho saktaa he ki vah usee samay kharaab tha jab use bechaa gaya tha or tab use lautaaya yaa badla ja saktaa tha
 If the seller insults the warranty, a contract claim can be initiated in court
 khudara vyapaar main, ek varantee, saamanytah saadhaaran prayog kii sharton ke tahat ek utpaada kii vishwasaneeyata kii guarantee ko sanderbhit karti he
 This is called an "extended" warranty because it covers defects that may arise after the date of sale
 agar ek utpaada kharidne ke baad, samay kii nirdhaarit avadhi ke bheetar kharaab hota he to to nirmaataa yaa vitarak ke liye yah aam taur par aavashyak hota he ki vah graahak ke liye us vastu ko badal de, yaa marammat kare, yaa paise waapas kare
 aisi varantee main aamtaur par, "prakritik aapadaa", maalik dwaara durupyog, durbhaavnapurna vinaash, vanijyik upyog, yaa waisi hi kuch baat jo saamaanya nijee upyog main hui yantric kharabi ke baahar hui ho
 adhikansh varantee ke antargat ve hisse shaamil nahin kiye jate jo saamaanya rup se kharaab hone vaale hote hai or ve aapurtiyon jinhen nishchit samyavadhi ke baad pratisthapit kiya janaa chahie kyonki saamaanya rup se unka upyog kiya ja chukaa hota he 
 ek vistaarit varantee ko kharid mulya main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, yaa vaikalpik rup se ek atirikt shulk ke saath vistaarit kiya ja saktaa he or unka vaarshik vistaar ho saktaa he or saath hi saath us utpaada main "aaajeevan" jaise aspasht shabd ho sakate hai
 Third-party warranty providers offer an optional "extended warranty" agreement for multiple products, which is considered a contract of insurance for that product
 tritiy-paksh ko vibhinn choti, swa-bimit companiyon ke madhyam se bechaa jaataa he or saath hi saath vishaal, prasiddh store shrinkhalaa dwaara bhi jaise ki best bai or circuit city
 jaisaa ki beemaa ke anya prakaar ke maamle main hota he, companiyaan jua khelti hai ki utpaada vishwasaneey honge or varantee ko bhul jaaya jayega, yaa kisi bhi tarah ke daawey ko saste main nipta diya jaayegaa
 kuch tritiy paksh kii companiyaan khud kii sahaayta pradaan karti hai jaise ki jettief bijness system; ye companiyaan kharaab hisson ko nikaal detii hai or pratisthaapan ke liye nirmaataa ke paas waapas bhej detii hai
 Extended warranties are not usually provided through the manufacturer, but are extended through independent administrators
 kuch paristhitiyon main yah upabhokta ke hit main kaam kar saktaa he ki utpaada kaa beemaa ek aisi company se kiya gaya he jo kharid ke sthaan or / yaa seva ke sthaan se baahar kii he
 For example, when an auto warranty is provided through a car dealership, it is usually a subcontracted warranty, where the vehicle repair deal is settled at a lower rate, often including service, The following standard is negotiated with Labor and Part
 kai baar is prakaar kii varantee ke liye marammat ke samay ek apratyaashit kharch kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jaise ki:-varantee sharton ke baahar pradaan kii gai apratyaashit sevaayen-gaiyr-varantee hisse or shram dar-purna shesh raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa jabaki ek pratipurti kii vyavastha dilarship / varantee daawa karyaalayon ke madhyam se kii gai ho
kuch yantriki or vyapaaree seva kendra aavashyak marammat ko taal sakate hai yaa badal sakate hai jab tak ki dilarship varantee samaapt na ho gai ho taaki marammat kii laagat unki varantee ke antargat naa aae, yaa saadhaaran dukaan dar lagu ho
 The * true literature of an insurance service agreement is the most important aspect of determining the quality of your extended auto warranty
 ek puri tarah se bimit auto varantee, jo kabhi-kabhi thok daron yaa isi tarah par mil jaati he, vah mulya antar ke laayak ho sakati he, yadi koi he to
 sachcha sahitya ek anubandh he jo aapaki ore se likhaa gaya ho jisamen aapkaa naam zarur hona chahie or aapaki utpaada idi sankhya yaa vaahan idi sankhya kaagaj par zarur likhi honi chahie
 yah aapkaa sachcha sahitya he or jab bhi kisi anubandh ke saath kaary karte hai to vahaan hameshaa bhinn "niyam evam sharten," hoti hai, to sunishchit karen ki aap sirf unhi companiyon ke saath sauda karen jo aisa seva anubandh pradaan karte hai 
 is prakaar kii varantee company, up-anubandhit, aatanrik, khudara or third-party varantee companiyon kii tulana main ullekhneey rup se kaafii alag hoti he, sirf isliye kyonki vah ucch dukaan dar ko aavruth karegi or graahak ko dilarship ke baahar or saath hi saath desh bhar main ek alag maikenic kaa chayan karne kii anumati degi
 bimit varantee aksar vaahan kii sarvice hone se pehle hi marammat, shram dar or prayukt parts kii laagat ke liye bhugtan kar detii hai, jisase maalik ko marammat kiye gaye vaahan yaa utpaada ko praapt karte samay sirf nune sah-bhugtan / katautee dena hota he
 The rights and treatment of buyers and sellers in the United States is governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code because it differs from state to state in its form
 UCC, express varantee or nihit varantee, donon ko niyantrit karata he
 It also includes limitations under which sellers may reject certain types of warranties (eg, commercial warranties or qualifications for a specific purpose or in the case of merchandise sold "as-is")
 is
 jabaki america main, varantee ko aam taur par likhit rup main diya jaataa he jo kanoon ke niyantran ke adheen he, anya deshon main varantee vishisht vidhiyon se niyantrit ho sakati hai
 For example, a country's law may provide that goods must be insured for a period of 12 months by the seller and may provide other special rights and remedies in the event of a product failure
 haalanki, america main bhi aise vishisht kanoon he jo khariddaaron ko varantee yaa varantee kii tarah aashwaasan uplabdh kara saktaa he
 For example, many states have statutory warranties on new housing construction and many have so-called "lemon Laws" that govern motor vehicles that deteriorate repeatedly
 jatil vyavsaayik lenden main, kharidaar or vikreta aapas main ek vishisht abhyavedan or varantee pradaan kar sakate hai
 In common parlance, these are known as "representations and warranties"
 ye bayaan he jiske dwaara ek paksh duusare paksh ko kuch nishchit aashwaasan detaa he or jis par doosraa paksh bharosa kar saktaa he
 In this context, a representation is usually a specific fact that can be verified as being true or false, "the seller represents that it is a duly held corporation and exists lawfully under the laws of the State of Delaware
" " yahaan, ek varantee, aashwaasan ke rup main adhik he, jaise "aapurtikarta varantee detaa he ki is pariyojna par kaam kar rahe uske sabhi karmchaaree gopneeyata samjhauton ke adheen honge jisamen ulanghan ke liye nishedhagna raahat paane kii aapurtikarta kii kshamta shaamil he
 "if the representations and warranties are not true or not fulfilled then often specific treatment or consequences for such a condition are specified
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vikreta yah abhyavedan or varantee de saktaa he ki bike hue saamaan main uskaa purna swaamitv adhikaar he or us lenden ko lekar vikreta ke liye koi kanoonee baadha nahin he
 If it is discovered that the seller does not have full rights or is subject to any other consent that prohibited the sale and if it affects the ownership of the buyer or he has to spend for it, the buyer has The seller has the right to seek relief under the agreement
 in lendenon main partiyaan aamtaur par un muddon ko lekar abhyavedan or varantee kii maang karti hai jinako lekar ve chintit hai
