 However, to counter the process of money laundering, an intergovernmental body, the FATF, was formed which acknowledged that "it is entirely impossible to provide a reliable estimate of the amount of money laundering as a whole" And hence no data in this context is published by the FATF
 isi prakaar shaikshik tippaneekar bhi sweekruti ke kisi bhi str tak is dhan kii maatra kaa anumaan lagane main asamarth rahe hai
 Despite the difficulty in measurement, the amount of black money that is legalized every year is in the billions and has become an important policy concern for governments
 iske parinaam swaroop sarkaron or antarrashtriya nikaayon dwaara kaale dhan ko vaid banane waalon ko daraane, rokane or pakadaney ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 Similarly, efforts have been made by financial institutions to detect and prevent transactions related to black money, both as a result of the requirements of the government and to avoid the reputation-related risks involved

 Recent activities to legalize black money in India have occurred through political parties, corporate companies and the stock market
 britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane or aatankwaadi vittaposhan ke kaanoon kaa niyantran praathmik vidhaan ke chaar adhiniyamon dwaara niyantrit hota he:- The Criminal Income Act 2002 contains primary UK anti-money laundering legislation as well as necessary provisions for businesses within the "regulated sector" through which customers or other individuals suspected of money laundering are informed 
 britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii prakriya ko vyapak rup se paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 In fact the operation or participation of any proceeds of any crime can be a crime to legalize black money
 kisi apradhi dwaara apane swayan ke aparaadh kii aay kaa swaamitv britain main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kii paribhaasha ke daayre main aata he
 This definition also includes activities that fall within the traditional definition of money laundering as a process by which the proceeds of crime are kept secret or hidden so that it comes from a legitimate source Seems to have happened

 Under UK law, money is not required to be involved in any crime that legalizes black money because the law of money laundering includes property of any kind
 iske parinaam swarup koi bhi vyakti jo britain main ek arjansheel aparaadh karata he vah britain ke kanoon ke tahat anivaary rup se ek kaale dhan ko vaid banane kaa aparaadh bhi karata he
 This also applies to a person who escapes an obligation by criminal conduct - referred to by lawyers as "receiving a pecuniary benefit" - because it is deemed to be the kind of liability he thus escapes He has received an amount of equal value
 kaale dhan ko vaid banane vaale pramukh aparaadhon main adhiktam 14 saal ke karawas kii sajaa di jaati he

 The United States is one of the few countries in the world that is required to report all cash transactions above a certain threshold, although some businesses may be exempt from this imperative
 iske atirikt, vittiya sansthaanon ko aise lenden kii soochna anivaary rup se ek sandehaaspad gatividhi report par deni chahie jise ve "sandehaaspad" samajhate hai jise yah jaanane yaa andeh karne ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he ki yah dhan avaidh gatividhi se aayaa he yaa avaidh gatividhi ke jariye dhan ko chipaaya gaya he or yah ki ise biese kii aavashyaktaaon se bachakar nikalne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he yaa aisa lagata he ki isse koi gyaat vyavsaay athwa pratyaksh kanoonee uddeshy judaa hua nahin he; yaa yah ki sanstha kaa istemaal aapraadhik gatividhi ko suvidha pradaan karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he

 graahakon ke anya varg jaise ki nijee banking khaaton or videshi sarkari adhikariyon se sambandhit graahak ko adhik tatparta ke saath dhyaan diya jaataa he kyonki kaanoon yah samajhataa he ki is tarah ke khaaton main kaale dhan ko vaid banane kaa jokhim kahin adhik hota he

 haalanki, yaa to ek vittiya lenden yaa chhipaane ke kisi iraade ke bina dhan kaa akelaa swaamitv sanyukt rajya america main koi aparaadh nahin he
 The law contained in section 1957 of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibits the expenditure of more than $ 10,000 arising from an SUA in addition to legalizing black money, even if the person wishes to conceal it
 isamen kaale dhan ko vaid kii tulana main kam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he or mani londering kaanoon ke vipareet isamen aavashyaktaa yah he ki dhan ek vittiya santhaan se hokar gujarata he

 software un naamon ko bhi suchit karegaa jinhen sarkaar kii "kaali suchi" main rakhaa gaya he or un lendenon ko bhi jisamen aise desh shaamil hai jinhen mejabaan desh kaa virdohi samajha jaataa he

 The English word cowboy has its origins in many old terms, in both eras it has come to the care of cattle or cattle

 It appears to be a direct English translation of vaquero, which is a Spanish word used to refer to a horse and cattle caretaker

 Another English word for cowboy is bakaru, which is an Englishization of vaquero

 Originally, the word literally could mean - "a boy who cares for cows
" " 1849 tak yah america pashchim ke ek vayask charvaahe yaa maveshi prabandhakarta ke rup main aadhunik arth main viksit ho gaya
 Variations in the word "cowboy" later emerged

 The term "cowboy" is common throughout the West and especially in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, while "buckaroo" is used primarily in the Great Basin and California, and "cowpuncher" is used mostly in Texas and surrounding areas

 Originally, the English word "cowherd" was used for a shepherd, just like a shepherd or shepherd) and was called before a teenager or for a teenage boy, who usually worked on foot

 Due to the need for time and physical ability to develop the necessary skills, cowboys often began their careers as a teenager, earning sufficient wages once they had enough skills and were not crippled by injuries
 However, cattle or horses could be taken care of for life

 One author states that cowboys "


 belonged to two classes - one recruited from Texas and other states of the Eastern Slope; and the other being Mexicans from the southwestern region
 


" janaganana record ke anusaar sabhi couboy main se 15% africa- america vanshaj the-jiname se 25% texas se baahar chale gayi, unamem se bahut kam uttar-pashchim kii ore gayi
 Similarly, the number of cowboys of Mexican ancestry averaged 15% of the total, but they were very common in Texas and the Southwest

 In many cases, various animal farm owners formed "associations" and left their cattle to graze at one place

 Once the cattle were separated, most of the cowboys would tie young calves and then mark them and castrate them
 Sometimes it would also be necessary to tame large cattle for marking or other treatment

 kuch maamalon main, ghodon ko vash main karne ke liye behad krur tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha or aise pashu kabhi bhi puri tarah se vishwasaneey nahin hua karte the
 However, other cowboys felt the need to treat animals more humanely and improved their horse training method, often re-learning techniques used by vaquero, especially techniques from the California tradition
 vinamr dhang se prashikshit kiye gayi ghode adhik vishwasaneey hote the or vibhinn prakaar ke kaamon ke liye upyogi the
 An informal competition between cowboys began to test their skills of handling cattle and horses, and thus, the rodeo competition evolved from the essential tasks of working cowboys

 However, after the end of the American Civil War, Philip Danforth Armor opened a meat packing plant in Chicago, which became known as Armor & Company, and the expansion of the meat packing industry led to a significant increase in demand for beef
 1866 se, uttari bazaaron main maveshi beche ja sakate the $40 prati kii dar se, isse bazaar se dur maveshi paalan karnaa sambhavi rup se laabhadaayak ho gaya, khaskar texas se
 For the first time in 1866, an effort was made to move cattle from Texas to a nearby railway station for the purpose of mass shipping to Chicago; At that time, many cattle farm owners united to take their cattle to the nearest railway station, which was then in Sedalia, Missouri
 However, farmers in eastern Kansas were afraid that local cattle from clovehorn might cause cattle fevers, as well as fear of trampling of crops, causing farmers to form groups and warn that their land Cattle personnel found will be beaten or shot
 Therefore, this campaign of 1866 failed to reach the railroad and herds of cattle were sold at low prices
 haalanki, 1867 main, abilene, consas main railway stesan ke aasapaas farm country ke pashchim main ek maveshi potvahan suvidha kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or wo sthaan maveshi potvahan kaa ek centre ban gaya, us saal vahaan se 36,000 maweshiyon ko ladaa gaya
 That route from Texas to Abilene became known as the Chisholm route, as that route was marked by Jessie Chisholm
 yah vartmaan oklahoma se hokar gujarata tha, jo us samay indian kshetra tha
 However, despite Hollywood's portrayals of the West, there were relatively few conflicts with homegrown Americans, who generally allowed herds of cattle to pass in lieu of a tax of ten cents per cattle
 baad main, vibhinn railway steshnon ke liye anya maarg banaae gayi, inamen doj city or vicita, consas ke maarg shaamil hai
 By 1877, 500,000 head of cattle had been shipped from large cattle-shipping cities such as Dodge City, Kansas
 maweshiyon ko haankane ke kaam main maweshiyon kii gati or unke vajan ke bich santulan banaae rakhana jaruri tha
 While cattle can be manhandled up to 25 miles in a day, their weight would be reduced so much that it would be difficult to sell them by reaching the destination
 They were usually taken to short distances daily, allowed to rest and graze in the afternoon and night
 On average, an animal group can maintain a healthy weight by walking 15 miles per day
 is gati kaa matlab hua ki pashu farm se railway stesan tak pahunchane main do maheene tak lag jate the
 The Chisholm route, for example, was 1,000 miles long
 ausatan, maweshiyon ke ek jhund ke ek haank abhiyaan main lagbhag 3,000 maveshi hua karte
 maweshiyon ko jhund main le jane ke liye kam se kam 10 couboy kii jarurat padati or ek couboy ke liye teen ghode kii jarurat hoti thi
 Cowboys worked 24-hour shifts to monitor cattle, to move them in the right direction during the daytime and to prevent stampede and thieves at night
 karmiyon main ek bawarchi bhi shaamil hota, jo ek bhojan vaahan chalaaya karata, aam taur par jis par ek bail juta hota or ek ashwapal hota jiske jimme remuda yaa atirikt ghodon kaa tabela hua karata

 By the 1880s, the expansion of the cattle industry necessitated the need for additional open spaces or extent
 tab anek pashu farm maalikon ne uttar-pashchim main vistaar kiya, jahaan tab bhi avyavhrut bade ghaas ke maidan maujuud the
 Texas cattle moved northward into the Rocky Mountain West and Dakota

 Starting in the 1880s, barbed wire kept cattle in a particular area, so that the cattle would not move beyond the limits in that area
 In Texas and surrounding areas, population growth made animal farm owners feel the need to encircle their land
 uttar main, khule kshetra main seemaa se adhik char lene ke kaaran jaade main maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa abhaav ho jaataa, jisase bhukhmaree kaa saamana karnaa padataa, khaskar 1886-1887 ke bhayaavah jaade ke samay, jab uttar-pashchim main lakhon maweshiyon kii mrityu ho gayi, jisase maveshi udyog kaa patan ho gaya tha
 By the 1890s, barbed wire fences became standard in the northern flat areas as well, with railroads expanded to cover most of the nation and meat packing plants were built close to large animal farm areas, from Texas to Kansas railway stations
 The long hank drive to bring cattle became unnecessary
 is vajah se, khule kshetra kaa ant hua or maweshiyon ke bade haank abhiyaan samaapt hue
 maweshiyon ke chote haank abhiyaan kam se kam 1940 ke dashak tak jari rahe, kyonki aadhunik maveshi trek banane se pehle tak, stockyard or packing plant tak parivahan ke liye farm maalikon ko sthaneey railway stesan tak pashuon ko haankna tab bhi jaruri tha
 Meanwhile, cattle ranches continued to grow throughout the developing West, cowboy employment also increased, although they continued to receive low salaries, but they also became somewhat inhabited
 samay ke saath, america pashchim ke couboy ne apni nijee samskruti viksit kii, seemaant or victorian mulyon kaa ek mishran jisamen veerta ke avasheshon ko bhi banaae rakhaa gaya
 Such dangerous work in isolated situations also created a tradition of self-reliance and individualism, with a strong emphasis on personal honesty, with lyrics and poems presented

 Although anti-homosexuality laws were common in the Old West, they were often applied selectively

 Beginning in the 1920s, western films to date have popularized the cowboy lifestyle, but at the same time created a constant bias both positively and negatively
 kuch maamalon main, aksar couboy or hinsak hatyare ko ek-duusare ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 On the other hand, some actors playing the role of cowboys promoted positive values, such as Jean Autry's "cowboy Code", which encouraged respectful behavior, respect and patriotism
 isi tarah, filmon main couboy ko america indian ke saath ladate hue aksar dikhaaya gaya he
 However, the reality is that cowboys were armed against robbers and human thieves and often used guns to attempt to steal cattle or to evade those who illegally carried them, while virtually all actual armed conflict took place among the Indian people

 The history of women working in the West, and especially in animal farms, is not as well documented as men
 haalanki, neshnal cougirl museum or haul of fame jaise sansthaanon ne haal ke varshon main mahilaon ke yogadan ko ikattha karne or unke dastauez taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn prayaas kiya he
 There are some records of mention of cattle being hauled by women as far as the cattle routes of the Old West
 haalanki, mahilaon ne pashu formon main kaaphi kaam kiya he or kuch maamalon main to unhen chalaaya bhi he
 There is no doubt that women, especially the wives and daughters of the owners of small farms, have worked shoulder to shoulder with men who could not keep large numbers of outside workers; And that's why they needed the ability to complete horse riding and related tasks
 The non-documented contributions of women from the West have been largely acknowledged in law; Western states have led the United States in the right to vote for women, beginning with Wyoming in 1869
 evalin camerun jaise praarambhik photographeron ne 19veen ke ant or 20veen sadi ke prarambh main pashu formon main kaam karne vaali mahilaon or cougirl ke jivan ko pralekhith kiya

 The most important horse in an animal farm is one that performs everyday tasks and that can perform a variety of tasks; Such horses are trained for special work such as separating or trapping cattle from herds, this is very rare in animal farms

 In the popular culture of the long history of the West, it is a practice to call them cowboys or cowgirls, whose clothes would be western, whether they were riding horses or not

 Conversely, some people who are involved with animal farming do not describe themselves as cowboys or cowgirls until they realize that their primary job is to be involved with animals or to participate in a equestrian competition
