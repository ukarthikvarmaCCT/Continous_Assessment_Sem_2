 kisi samvedansheel samay main padi chhap ke kaaran iske utprerak kaaphi vividh prakaar ke ho sakate hai, yaa anuvanshik rup se nirdhaarit bhi ho sakate hai
 Permanent patterns of instinctual activity can be seen in animal behavior, engaging in activities that are not based on prior experiences, such as breeding and feeding activities among insects
 Sea turtles bred on the beach automatically move towards the sea and bees dance about the direction of the food source; These occur without any formal education
 anya udaahranon main jaanwaron kii ladaai, jaanwaron kaa premalap sambandhi vyavhaar, bachane ke aatanrik tareeke or ghoslon kaa nirmaan shaamil hai
 Another term for this concept is 'spontaneous behavior'
 sahaj vritti vaali gatividhiyon - shikshan aadhaarit gatividhiyon ke vipareet, jo smriti par aadhaarit hoti hai or anubhavon ke aadhaar par vyaktigat rup se sangrahit safal pratikriyaayein pradaan karti hai - main koi prashikshan shaamil nahin hota he, ve anternihit hoti hai or kisi prashikshan ke bina hi istemaal ke liye taiyaar rahati hai
 Some instinctual behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear
 jaivik pravritiyaan sahaj tathaa jaivik rup se utprerit vyavhaar hote hai jinhen aasaani se siikhaa ja saktaa he
 For example, a calf can learn to stand, walk, jump and run in just one hour
 ek jaivik pravriti kaa matlab yah bhi he ki kuch vyakti apni anuvanshik sanrachana ke kaaran kuch vishesh paristhitiyon tathaa bimariyon ke prati adhik samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 Training is needed to further improve behavior such as neurological reflexes
 vishuddh prartiwarton tathaa sahaj vritti main, tantrika pranali main unki maujuudagi kii sthiti ke anusaar antar kiya ja saktaa he; prativart ridh sambandhi yaa anya paridhiy gangliya dwaara niyantrit hote hai, jabaki sahaj vritti par mastishk kaa adhikaar hota he
 In situations where two spontaneous circles conflict with each other, an animal may turn to displacement activities
 sahaj vritti ke ek siddhant ke anusaar nihit jhukaav diene main sangrahit hota he or isliye vah abhibhavakon se unke bacchon main bhi paarit hota he
 Spontaneous behavior can be demonstrated quite widely in animal life
 darwin ke 'prakritik chayan dwaara vikaas' ke siddhant ke anusaar pratispardhaa main vijayi hone tathaa jivit rahane kii behatar dar ke liye praaniyon main sahaj vritti jaise anukool gunon kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 Thus, for evolutionary biology, instincts can be explained as a behavior conducive to survival of the fittest
 kuch khaas kism ke pakshiyon main tatkaal sahaj vritti kaa ek acha udhaaharan he 'chhap chhodana '
 yah vahi vyavhaar jo battakh ke bacchon ko apane saamne aane vaali pehali chalati hui vastu ke peeche jane ke liye prerit karata he, kyonki yah aamtaur par unki maa hi hoti he
 There has been considerable work on this concept by psychologist Konrad Lorenz
 chhap chhodane kaa ek anya mahatvapurn pahalu he yon sambandhi chayan
 yuva pakshi pasandida saathi ke chunaav ke liye apane vipareet ling ke abhibhavak ke gunon ko adhik mahatva dete hai
 One inhibitory effect is the Westmark effect, that is, the tendency not to be attracted to one's siblings due to very close contact during a sensitive period
 yah vichaar ki sahaj vritti sambandhi vyavhaar ke liye kisi shikshan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he, hameshaa lagu nahin hota, khaskar jab swayan vyavhaar kii baat ho
 But the key catalyst and specific results may be somewhat different due to different inputs
 parinaam is arth main bhinn ho saktaa he ki ek finch chidiya swaabhaavik rup se gaanaa gaayegi, lekin wo praayah unhi gaanon ko gaayegi jinhen usne ek samvedansheel avadhi ke dauraan grahan kiya he; finch chidiya ke gaanon main alag kshetreey shaileyon kii maujuudagi kaa kaaran bhi yahi hota he
 The Baldwin effect operates in two stages
 sabase pehle, phinotipic plasticity ek vyakti ko ek aanshik rup se safal utparivartan ke saath samanvay bithaane main sakasham banaata he, jo anyathaa us vyakti ke liye bilkul hi bekaar hota he
 If this mutation enhances overall fitness then it will be successful and will expand throughout the population
 phinotipic plasticity saamanytah kisi vyakti ke liye kaaphi mahangi sabit hoti he; shikshan ke liye samay or urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or kai baar isamen khatarnaak galtiyaan bhi shaamil hoti hai
 So there is also a second step: given sufficient time, development can find a continuous process to remove the plastic process
 is prakaar ek vyavhaar jise pehle siikhaa gaya tha, baad main samay ke saath sahaj vritti main parivartit ho jaataa he 
 At first cursory vision seems similar to Lamarck development, but there is no direct change in genotype based on the experience of the phenotype
 "sahaj vritti" shabd kaa manovigyaan main ek lanbaa or vividh prayog rahaa he
 In the 1870s, Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychology laboratory
 us samay, manovigyaan multah darshan kii ek shakha thi, parantu vyavhaar kaa vaigyanik paddati ke dhaanche ke bheetar adhikadhik pareekshan kiya jane laga
 Although words were beginning to be defined in a more precise way due to the use of scientific method, by the end of the 19th century most repetitive behavior was considered to be instinctive
 us samay sahitya ke ek surveykshan main ek shodhakarta ne 4000 maanav sahaj vrittiyon ko soochibaddh kiya, arthath aisa prayek doharaaya jane vaala vyavhaar jiskaa kisi na kisi ne namakaran kiya ho
 As research progressed and words were better defined, instincts were used less often to describe human behavior
 1960 main tulanaatmak manovigyaan kii shuruyaat karne vaale frank bich kii adhyakshata vaale ek sammelan main, is shabd ke prayog ko kaaphi simit kar diya gaya
 During the 60s and 70s, textbooks still included some discussions of instinct in the context of human behavior
 varsh 2000 tak, parichayatmak manovigyaan kii 12 sarvaadhik bikri vaali pathyapustakon ke ek surveykshan main sahaj vritti ke keval ek sandarbh kii charchaa kii gayi thi or vah sigmund frid ke "id" sahaj vritti ke sandarbh main tha
 Any repetitive behavior can be called "instinctual", the same term can also be used for any other behavior for which there is a strong underlying reason
 haalanki, kisi jeev ke niyantran se baahar ke vyavhaar tathaa dohraye jane vaale vyavahar ke bich bhed karne ke liye ham 1960 ke sammelan se nikal kar aane vaali pustak "instinct" kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 Several criteria were established to distinguish between instinct and other types of behavior
 sahaj vritti maane jane ke liye kisi vyavhaar ke liye nimna kaa hona aavashyak he - 1) swachaalit, 2) prabal, 3) vikaas ke kisi bindu par prakat hona, 4) vaataavaran kii kisi ghatana dwaara utprerit, 5) prajati ke prayek sadsy main dikhaai dena, 6) asanshodhaneey, 7) aise vyavhaar ko niyantrit karnaa jiske liye jeev ko kisi prashikshan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he 
 Lack of one or more of these criteria is an indication that behavior is not a purely instinctive attitude
 sahaj vrittiyaan keedon or jaanwaron main maujuud hoti hai, jaisaa ki unke un vyavhaaron main dekha ja saktaa he jinhen shikshan dwaara parivartit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 manovaigyanik is baat ko maanate hai ki manushyon main kai aisi jaivik pravritiyaan or vyavhaar maujuud hote hai jinhen unki jaivik sanrachana ke kaaran siikhnaa aasaan hota he, udhaaharan ke liye chalanaa yaa baat karnaa
 If these criteria are used in a purely scientific manner, the use of the term "instinct" cannot be used in the context of human behavior
 When words like mamata, territorial suzerainty, food, sexual intercourse, etc
 are used for human behavior, it appears that they do not fully meet the above criteria
 pashuon ke shitaswapan, pravaas, ghonsle kaa nirmaan, sambhog aadi jaise vyavhaaron ke vipareet, koi bhi maanav vyavhaar aavashyak mandandon ko puraa nahin karata he
 And in relation to animals too, in many cases these instinctive behaviors also disappear if true learning is prevented from appearing, indicating that they are powerful but limited biological tendencies
 antim vishleshan main, is paribhaasha ke tahat koi bhi maanav sahaj vritti maujuud nahin he
 Some social and natural biologists have tried to understand human and animal social behavior in terms of instinct
 manovishleshkon kaa kahana he ki sahaj vritti maanviya prerak shaktiyon ko sanderbhit karti he, jo kabhi-kabhaar jivan sambandhi sahaj vritti yaa mrityu sambandhi sahaj vritti ke rup main dikhaai detii hai
 This use of the term motivational powers has been largely replaced by the term instincts
 maanviya sahaj vrittiyon ko swatah hone vaali kriyaaon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Spontaneous actions such as the Babinski reflex can be seen in infants and indicate stages of development
 in sahaj kriyaaon ko vishuddh rup se sahaj vritti mana ja saktaa he kyonki ve aamtaur par paryaavarniya prabhaavon yaa anukulan ke bina hi hoti hai
 Additional human traits that have been seen as innate instinct are: sleeping, hatred, face reading, language learning, "fighting or running" and "subjugating or being"
 Some experiments conducted in humans and monkey societies have also come to the conclusion that a sense of fairness can be regarded as a natural instinct, where humans and apes harm their own interests in opposition to the biased behavior of themselves and others
 Also ready to deliver
 kai vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki baalkon dwaara sabhi chizon ko apane munh main daalana ek sahaj vritti he kyonki isi ke dwaara ve apni pratiraksha pranali ko apane vaataavaran tathaa parivesh ke bare main yah bataate hai ki use kis cheez ko apnaanaa he
 Other sociologists argue that there is no instinct in man; They define it as, "complex behaviors present in each member of a particular species, which are spontaneous and cannot be controlled
" " aise samajashastriyon kaa tark he ki sex or bhukh jaisi pravritiyon ko sahaj vritti nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki unpar kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 This terminological argument is present in many introductory textbooks in biology and sociology, but it is still hotly debated
 manovigyaani ibrahim maslo kaa tark he ki manushyon main ab koi bhi sahaj vritti maujuud nahin rah gayi he kyonki hamaare paas kuch paristhitiyon main unpar kaabo paane kii kshamta maujuud he
 He believes that what we call instinct is often not defined accurately and is in fact nothing but a strong will
 maslo ke liye, sahaj vritti vah he jisapar kaabo na paaya ja sake or isliye ateet main sambhawatah yah manushyon par lagu hoti rahi hogi lekin aaj aisa nahin he
 In his book An Instinct for Dragons, anthropologist David E
 Jones proposes that humans, like apes, have inherited innate responses to snakes, big cats and predatory birds from their ancestors
 lokgeeton main paae jane vaale dragon main in teenon ke gun hote hai, jo is baat kaa uttar pesh karata he ki samaan gunon vaale dragon sabhi mahadwipon kii swatantra samskritiyon kii kahaniyon main kyon dikhaai dete hai
 Other authors suggest that this instinct in drug effects or dreams may produce fantasies related to dragons, snakes, spiders; For this reason, these symbols are very popular in the drug culture
 haalanki, lokgeeton main dragon kii maujuudagi kii paaramparik mukhyadhara vyakhya maanav sahaj vritti kii bajaay is dharna par nirbhar karti he ki dianasor ke jeevashm avasheshon ne puri duniya main samaan atakalon ko janm diya tha

 For example, a wheat crop is ready when its grains are ripened to yellow and all the wheat plants growing in a field at that time are cut and their particles are separated
 aam kii fasal main kisi baag ke pedo par aam pakane lagate hai or, bina pedo ko nuksaan pahunchaae, falon ko todakar ekatrit kiya jaataa he
 Since agriculture was invented, crops have been of great importance in the lifespan of many humans
 udhaaharan ke liye uttar bharat, pakistan va nepal main rabi kii fasal or kareef kii fasal do badi ghatnaayen hai jo badi had tak in kshetron ke gramin jivan ko nirdhaarit karti hai
 Similarly, crops based on local weather, earth, vegetation and water in other places have a profound effect on the life-order of the place
 bhartiya fasalon kaa vargeekaran bhinn-bhinn aadhaaron par kiya ja saktaa he
 The classification of Indian crops is given on some grounds below
 angrejon ke shasankaal main bharat kii rajdhani jab kalakatta thi, vahaan 1854 main pehali baar angreji naatak manchit hua
 Inspired by this, the newly educated Indians wished to make their own theater

 Apart from these, people were also entertained by religious works like Ramayana and Mahabharata, traditional folk plays, harikathas, religious songs, traditional stage performances like Jatras
 parsi thiatak se lok rangamanch kaa janm hua
 The Parsis at one time took the initiative to open a drama company and gradually it became a popular medium of entertainment
 isaki jaden itani gahari thim ki aadhunik cinema aaj bhi is prabhaav se puri tarah mukt nahin ho paaya he
 The Parsi Theater was based on the model of 19th-century British theater
 ise parsi rangamanch isliye kaha jaataa tha kyonki isse parsi vyapaaree jude the
 They used to put their money from it
 unhone parsi rangamanch kii apni puri takanic britain se mangaai
 It also had complex machinery from proscenium stage to back stage
 lekin lok rangamanch-geeton, nrityon paramparaagat lok haas-parihaas ke kuch aavashyak tatwon or inaki prarambh tathaa ant kii ravaaiton ko parsi rangamanch ne apni katha kehane kii style main shaamil kar liya tha
 It was a confluence of the two best traditions, and all the stage performances were on mythological themes with more traditional songs and effective stage instruments used
 kathanak gadhe hue or manchi hote the jisamen bhramavash ek vyakti ko doosraa samajha jaataa tha, ghatnaon main sanyog kii bhoomika hoti thi, joshilay bhaashan hote the, chattaanon se latakane kaa romaanch hota tha or antim kshan main unka bachaav kiya jaataa tha, sachharitra nayak kii dushcharitra khalanaayak par jeet dikhaayi jaati thi or in sabhi ko geet-sangeet ke saath vishwasaneey banaaya jaataa tha
 In the colonial period, Alha, Qawwali were the main places of modern theater and films in the special popular media of Hindi region of India
 lekin parsi theatre aane ke baad darshakon main gane ke madhyam se bahut si baaten kehane kii parampara chal padi jo darshakon main lokapriy hoti chali gayi
 Later in the 1930s, the facility of voice recording started and this legacy was adopted in films in a new way
 varsh 1853 main apni shuruyaat ke baad se parsi theatre dhire-dhire ek 'chalit theatre' kaa rup letaa chalaa gaya or log gum-gum kar naatak desh ke har kone main le jane lage
 "melodrama" was an important element in the performance of Parsi theater and the dialogue was played in a very dramatic way
 unhone kaha ki aaj bhi filmon ke abhinay main parsi naatak ke tatv dikhaai dete hai
 For 80 years, the Parsi theater and its various forms kept their coinage in the entertainment sector
 film ke aagaman ke baad parsi rangamanch ne vidhiwat apni parampara cinema ko saunp di
 Many professional theater heroes, heroines are collaborators, lyricists, directors, musicians in the field of cinema
 ardeshir irani, vaajia bros, prithviraj kapur, soharaab modi or anek mahaan diggaj rangamanchaki pratibhaaen thim jinhone shuruaati taur main bhartiya filmon ko samrudh kiya
 The Parsi theater has four major features
 pehla, pardon kaa nayab prayog
 Different scenes are used for every scene on the stage to bring depth and reliability to the scenes
 aajkal filmon main alag alag lokation dikhaae jate hai
 In Parsi theater, this work is done through curtains
 isliye parsi rangamanch kii manch sajja kaa vidhaan bada hi jatil hota he
 The second feature is the use of music, dance and singing in them
 parsi naatakon main nrity or gayan kaa yahi mail hindi filmon main gaya
 For this reason, Indian films began to diverge from Western films
 teesri khubi vastra sajja yani costum he
 The colors and embellishments are taken care of in the clothes that the actors wear on the Parsi colormatch
 chunki darshak bahut peeche tak baithe hoten hai isliye unako dhyaan main chhakhte hue vastron or paatro ke alankaran main rangon kii bahutyaat hoti he
 The fourth major feature of the Parsi Theater is the lengthy dialogues
 parsi naatakon ke samvaad oonchi aawaaj main bole jate hai isliye sanvaadon main atinaatakeeyata bhi rahati he
 Singing was an important element in Parsi theater and the actors used to sing to express their deep feelings
 parsi theatre main ek abhinayta ke liye ek acha gayak hona behatar mana jaataa tha kyonki aadhi kahani gaanon main hi chalati thi
 The effect of Parsi theater is that songs are used extensively in our Hindi films today
 gaanon ke bagaiyr aaj bhartiya darshak film ko adhuraa maanate hai
 Our modern Hindi films have started appearing influenced by the realism of the West, but even today it is maintaining the tradition of Parsi theater by singing and speaking
 hindi filmon kii safalataa ke liye passport ban chuke ‘item song’ kii jaden darasal parsi theatre tak jaati he or aaj bhale hi cinema or rangamanch se is pracheen style ke abhinay ke tatv gaayab ho gayi hon lekin is natya style ke gane gaakar apni bhaawanaaon se darshakon ko udwelit karne kii adaa aaj bhi kaayam he

 The circulatory system or vasosphere is the set of organs that carry the transport of nutrients between the cells of the body
 isse rogon se sharir kii raksha hoti he tathaa sharir kaa taap evam ph sthir bana rahata he
 Amino acids, electrolytes, gases, hormones, blood cells and nitrogen waste products etc
 are transported by the circulatory system
 keval rakt-vitaran network ko hi kuch log vahika tantra maanate hai jabaki anya log lasika tantra ko bhi isi main sammilit karte hai
 The circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates is the 'closed circulatory system'
 aksherukon ke parisancharan tantra, 'khule parisancharan tantra' hai
 Many trivial systems do not have a circulating system
 kintu sabhi praaniyon kaa lasika tantra ek khulaa tantra hota he
 Vascular system is the name of a group of heart, arteries and veins
 dhamniyon or shiraaon ke bich keshikaon kaa vistrut samooh bhi isi tantra kaa bhaag he
 The function of this system is to transport blood to each part of the body, so that it can get nutrition and oxygen
 is tantra kaa centre hriday he, jo rudhir ko nirantar pump karata rahata he or dhamniyaan ve vahikaaye hai jinamein hokar rudhir angon main pahunchataa he tathaa keshikaon dwaara vitarit hota he
 Nutrition and oxygen from the capillary blood move into the tissues and they bring the blood without this nutrition and oxygen back to the vein which sends it to the lungs to take oxygen
 antra se avashoshit hokar poshak avyav bhi is rudhir main mil jate hai or phir se is rudhir ko angon main oxigen tathaa poshan pahunchaane ke liye dhamniyon dwaara bhej diya jaataa he
 It is a four-legged hollow organ made of muscular tissue, located on the left side, inside the thoracic, at the top, at the middle of the second retina and the sixth perpendicular at the bottom
 iske donon ore daahine ore baayein phupfus hai
 Its shape is similar to that of some triangles, whose broad base is situated above and the broad low current lies downwards
 isapar ek doharaa kalanirmit aavaran chadha hua he, jiskaa hridayaavaran kehete hai
 a little aliphatic fluid is filled between its two layers
 hriday bheetar se chaar koshthon main vibhakt he
 There are two cells on the right and two on the left
 dahini or bai ore ke koshth ke bich main ek vibhaajak pat hai, jo donon ore ke rudhir ko milane nahin detaa
 On each side there is a vault upwards, which is called the atrium and the bottom vault is called the ventricle
 daahine nilay main urdhv ore adho mahashiraaon ke do chhidr hai, jinke dwaara rudhir lautakar hriday main aata he
 a large opening is between the atrium and ventricle, on which the capillary is attached
 hriday ke sankuchan ke samay alind ke sankuchit hone par kapatikaay nilay kii ore khul jaati he, jisase rudhir nilay main chalaa jaataa he
 There is also perforation of the pulmonary artery in the right ventricle
 nilay ke sankuchit hone par rudhir phupfusi dhamni main hota hua phupphuson main chalaa jaataa he
 Similarly, the left side also has atrium above and ventricle below
 baayein nilay main chaar phupfusi shiraaon ke chhidr hai, jinke dwaara phupphuson main shuddh hua rudhir lautakar aata he or alind ke sakuchan karne par vah nilay or alind ke bich ke chhidr dwaara nilay main chalaa jaataa he
 This hole on the left side also has a capillary
 baayein nilay main mahadhamani kaa chhidr he, jisase rudhir nikalakar mahadhmani main chalaa jaataa he or uski anek shakhaon dwaara saare sharir main sanchaar karke shiraaon dwaara lautakar phir hriday ke daahine alind main laut aata he
 These are structures of great importance, which allow the blood to move through only one path, not to return
 dahini ore kii kapatika teen kaudi ke samaan bhaagon kii bani he or trivalan kapatic kehalaati he
 On the left is the double-capillary capsule
 nilay kii ore ke prishth par inamen baarik rajju ke samaan tantu lage hue hai, jinke duusare sire nilay kii diwaar se nikle hue ankuron par lagate hai
 These are called condylarx and the sprouts are called papillary muscles
 alind ke sankoch se nilay main rudhir bhar jane par, jab vah sankuchit hota he, to rudhir kapardon ke peeche pahunchakar unako chhidron kii ore uthaa detaa he, jisase unke sire aapas main milakar chhidr ke maarg ko roak dete hai or rudhir alind main nahin laut paata
 The papillary muscles also become narrower, causing the condyle cord to expand and the cervix of the capillaries are not able to overturn in the atrium
 is prakaar ke prabandh se rudhir keval ek hi disha main, alind se nilay main, ja saktaa he
 There are also crescent capillaries on the pleural and aortic vents
 uparyukt varnan se spasht hai ki rudhir mahashiraaon sak daahine alind main aata he
 From there, it goes into the ventricle at the time of exertion
 nilay ke sankuchit hone par phupfusi dhamni main hota hua phupfus main chalaa jaataa he
 Taking oxygen there, the blood enters the left atrium by four pulmonary veins and when it is contracted, the blood enters the left ventricle
 baayein nilay main sankuchit hone par rudhir mahadhamani main agrasar ho jaataa he
 The branches of this artery, which are mentioned below, are spread throughout the body
 rudhir inke dwaara angon main sanchaar karke keshikaon main hota hua, shiraaon dwaara phir hriday ke daahine bhaag main laut aata he or phir vahi chakra aarambh hota he
 This is called blood circulation

 The ventricles contract for 0
3 seconds, the remaining period is relaxed
 is prakaar sara hriday 0
4 second tak shithilavastha main rahata he
 The heart's systolic systole and relaxation is called diastolic
 hriday se shuddh rudhir ko le janevaali lacheelee naliyaan yaa vahikaaye hai, jinke dwaara rudhir angon main pahunchataa he
 The main aorta arises from the heart, which, at the end of the abdomen passing through the chest, divides into two final branches
 mahadhamani se shakhaayen nikalakar angon main chali jaati hai
 As the branches grow, their size gets smaller
 ye chote akaarwali dhamnikaaye kehalaati hai
 The proximal branches of the arteries merge with each other, so that if the path of one is cut off or stops due to disease, then it reaches blood from the other artery to the expansion area
 isko shakhamilan kehete hai
 There are two main arteries arising from the heart, the pleura and the aorta
 phupfusi dhamni daahine nilay se nikalne ke pashchaat do shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati he or prayek phuffus main ek ek shakha chali jaati he
 The purpose of this artery is to transport the blood to the lungs to take oxygen
 hriday ke baayein nilay se nikalakar pehle kuch dahini ore, tab peeche kii ore, tatpashchaat mudati hui bai ore ko chali jaati hai, jahaan chauthi vaksh kasheruka ke baayein parshv par pahunchakar vahaan se sidhi neeche ko utarati hui vaksh ke ant tak chali jaati he
 Thus, the bend that is formed in the beginning is called the aortic arch
 vaksh ke ant par madhyachhda peshi main se chhidr dwaara nikalakar, saare udar ko paar karti hui chauthe kati kasheruk par pahunchakar, do saamaanya shreni falak dhamniyon main vibhakt hokar samaapt ho jaati he
 In the thoracic heart arteries are the first branches of the aorta, which form a circle around the heart at the place of the aorta's exit from the heart
 inaki shakhaayen sidhi neeche ko jaakar hritpeshi main poshan pahunchaati hai
 In the transverse part of the aortic arch, the right side arises from the right, anatomical artery and the left inferior branch respectively
 anami sabase badi shakha he or dahini ore upar greevamul main pahunchakar, dahini mul greeva or shir main rudhir pahunchaati hai tathaa adhojatruk urdhv shakha kaa rudhir sambharan karti he
 Moolagriva divides into external and intercervical branches on the vertical stream of cartilage going upward in the straight cervix
 ant:greeva netragolak ko ek shakha dene ke pashchaat shankhaasthi kii greeva nalika main hokar, kapaal ke bheetar pahunchakar, puropramastishk or madhya pramastishk shakhaon main vibhakt ho jaati he, jo pramastishk ke agr or madhya bhaag ko rudhir detii hai
 The cervix on either side reaches the base of the cerebrum and fuses with itself by one connective branch in front and the other side also by the other branch by the base artery
 is prakaar vahaan ek chakra ban jaataa he, jo villim kaa valay kaha jataah he
 After reaching the top of the cupric gland, lateral to the cervical cervix, the endothelium ends in the convex conical branch branches, which spread to the muscles of the mouth and the surface of the cervix
 uski anya shakhaayen ye hai : It reaches the chamber and becomes the brachial artery in the orbital and brachial
 kuhani ke saamne pahunchakar isaki at: or bahi:prakoshthik do shakhaayen ho jaati hai
 This leaves the following branches: adhojatruk se - kasheruki, avatukamul dhamni, ant: stanika tathaa urdhv parshukantarika 
 From the orbital part - axillary branches - to the muscles of the vasculature; Ansatund Vaxal; Precursor; Postsynaptic and subdural; From the outer part, to the vertical and subepithelial and muscles, and to the adnexal branches
 yah kuhani kurper ke saamne se prarambh hokar agrabahu ke bhitari kinare par sidhi neeche hatheli tak chali jaati he or vahaan anguthe kii ore ko mudakar, bahi:prakoshthika kii shakha ke saath milakar uttal kartal chaap bana detii hai, jisamen kanishtha, madhyamaa or anamika anguliyon ke donon ore, tarjani ke keval bhitari kinare par, shakhaayen chali jaati hai
 In the forearm, it gives nutritious branches to all muscles and bones
 kuhani ke paas usase do aavartak shakhaayen nikalati hai
 Reaching the mandibular straight down on the outer edge of the forearm, rotating backward, coming from the back and forth between the first and second lanceolate branches to the larynx, forming a branch of the endothelium, forming an oblique lanceolate arc, Branches are placed on either side of the thumb and the outer surface of the index finger
 manibandh par isse do aavartak shakhaayen nikalati hai tathaa peshiyon or asthiyon kii shakhaayen jaati hai
 The following branches originate from the aorta in the thoracic: pharyngeal, bronchial, and cardiovascular branches, which migrate to these organs
 udar main mahadhamani se nikalanevaali shakhaon main se kuch ke jode hai
 The larynx, renal and the venous branches are pairs of branches originating from the sides of the aorta
 uske saamne se udarguhadhamni or urdhv or adho antrayojani shakhaayen hai
 Branches from the abdominal artery to the liver, stomach and spleen
 antrayojani dhamniyaan samast antra ko tathaa udar main sthit anya angon ko rudhir pahunchaati hai
 There are branches carrying blood in the breasts of the thoracic and abdominal: peritoneal, stern medulla, and median sacral
