 Mahakavi had different experiences in his life, which is reflected in his creations
 pranay vishyak sukhaant naatakon main kalpanavilas he or kavi kaa man aishwarya or yauvan kii vilasita main rama he
 Grief plays express such sad experiences that make life toxic
 shakespeare ke krititv kii parinti aise naatakon kii rachana main hui jinamein unki samyak buddhi kaa pratifalan hua he
 The poet now sees with his prudent view that both happiness and sorrow remain embedded in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: donon hi kshanik hai
 Happiness comes after grief in life, so equality in thought and behavior is desirable
 in antim naatakon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki hinsa or pratishodh kii apeksha dayaa or kshamaa adhik shlaghneey hai
 These plays have special significance due to their serious moral message
 shakespeare ke naatak svachhndathawadi hai tathaa pracheen unani or latin naatakon kii parampara se pruthak hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to find classical features of object in them
 keval apane antim naatak 'di tempast' main unhone teenon anvitiyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 In almost all other plays, only the implementation has been taken care of, in terms of time and place, they are absolutely essays
 kathavstu main sadaiv paryaapt vistaar miltaa he or saamanyat: usamen kai kathaayen antarnihit rahati hai
 For example, we can take a Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Merchant on Venice, As You Like It or King Lear
 in sabhi main anek kathaon ke mishran dwaara vastunirmaan sampann hua he
 But this does not mean that the design of Shakespeare's plays is flawed
 ant:kathaon kaa natyavastu main sundar, kalapurna reeti se gunfan kiya gaya he tathaa sampurna kathanak se sankalit ekta kaa abhas miltaa he
 In spite of the lack of inventions in the classical sense, emotional and imaginative integration has taken place in these romantic plays
 patrakalpana main shakespeare ko or bhi adhik safalataa mili he
 In his plays he has created many fascinating characters who come before us in their lively form
 samay ke saath charitranirupan kii prakriya adhikadhik sookshm evam kalatmak hoti gai
 For example, we can take Rosalin, Porcia, Viartrus, Rosalind, Vayala Prabhriti Pragalbha, women included in the Sukhanta plays, who constantly introduce their sharp intellect and speech
 duusari koti kii ve naariyaan hai jinke anupam saundarya or sankatpurna anubhavon ke kaaran man main karunaa kaa udrek hota he
 The major among such females are Juliet, Ophilia, Desdimona, Cardilia, Imogen etc
 du:khant naatakon main charitrachitran kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 For example, we can take Hamlet
 naatak kii samast ghatnaayen nayak ke charitra par kendrit hai or usee ke vyaktitv ke prabhaav se katha kaa vikaas hota he
 Partially the same is true for other sad plays
 pracheen unani naatakon main anek smaraneey paatr milte hai kintu naitik or manovaigyanik upkarnon ke sahare ankit kiye hue shakespeare ke pramukh paatr kahin adhik rochak evam aakarshak hai
 The characterization of grief plays has become even more miraculous with the use of internal duality
 shakespeare ke naatakon ke kuch anya paatr bhi ullekhneey hai jaise vidooshak or khalanaayak
 Among the clowns, Falstaff Touchstone, Feste and King Lear's loyal clowns are important
 khalnaayakon main richard tritiy, iyago, edmund iatiyon aadi kii gananaa hoti he
 As Hazlitt wrote, the power of Shakespeare shows that not only is his character distinguished but his majority of minor characters also hold their own personal importance
 yadhyapi shakespeare ke naatakon main kahin kahin gadhy kaa prayog hua he, tab bhi ve mulat: kaavyatmak he
 Most of his part is stitched
 yahi nahin, praaia: sabhi natya rachanaayen kaavyatmak gunon se bhari padi hai
 Shakespeare has created an enchanting effect by the production of imagination, figurative expressions, musical rhythms and gentle emotions
 pracheen kaal se naatakon kaa kavita kaa ek bhed maatr maanate aae the or shakespeare ne pracheen dharna sweekaar kii
 Prose has been used occasionally for special purposes
 kintu saamaanya rup se ham shakespeare ke naatakon ko kavyanaty kii sangya de sakate hai
 Poetry was excessive initially, but shanai: shanai: his form became restrained and he began to control the idea of purpose
 isi bhanti shakespeare kii style main samavisht karne ke liye nirantar prayaas kiya; falat: praarambhik naatakon main vistrut varnanon ev sundar rupakon kaa bahulya he apni pratibha kii praudhavastha main jab shakespeare apane prasiddh du:khant naatakon kii rachana kar rahe the us samay tak unki style santulit ho gai thi
 In primary stage, expression was more important and ideas were less important
 kintu is madhyamik kaal main vichaaron, bhaavon tathaa abhivyakti ke sadhano kaa samyak samanvay hua he
 This balanced system focused on Shakespeare's ideas and moral paradigms in the last years and ignored stylistic miracles
 isiilie antim naatakon kii style kahin kahin angadh ho gai he
 Shakespeare wrote his plays primarily for theater, although we also enjoy reading from him because of his poetic qualities
 tatkaaleen rangamanch kii banaavat abhinay kii vyavastha, darshakon kii lokaruchi, in sabhi kaa prabhaav shakespeare ke natyanirmaan par padaa
 Two examples will suffice
 us samay range hue paradon kaa upyog nahin hota tha, isliye naatakon main anek varnanaatmak anshon kaa samavesh hua he
 Location, time and situation were indicated by these descriptions
 naatakon main swagat evam swabhaashit kaa nirantar upyog isiilie sambhav ho sakaa ki rangamanch kaa aglaa trikonakar bhaag prekshkon ke bich tak aage badha rahata tha
 Shakespeare did the surgeon for many male and female characters only because his suitable actors were available
 darshakon ke manoranjanarth anek drishyon kii avatarana hui he jiname rangamanch par uttejk evam manoranjak paristhitiyon kaa pradarshan hua he
 Like today's realistic theater, the Elizabethan era theater was bound by abundant means and fixed arrangements
 abhinay or pradarshan donon hi apekshaakrit unmukt the, isliye shakespeare ke naatakon main paryaapt rujuta milti he
 In almost all types of plays, Mahakavi has embodied lyrical freedoms that are unique for their beauty and melody
 inke atirikt shakespeare kii vistrut kavitaayen hai, jinamein 'vinas and adonis', 'di rape aav lukris' tathaa sanets kaa ullekh aavashyak he
 All these works belong to the last decade of the 16th century when Shakespeare's heart was charmed by the effects of beauty and love
 'vinas and adonis' main ek pracheen premakatha ko atyant kaavyatmak reeti se varnit kiya gaya he
 'the Rape of Lucreus' tells the story of the misfortune and death of a supremely beautiful Roman woman
 sanets main kuch aise hai jo kavi ke ek mitra se sambandh rakhte hai jisane vivaah na karne kaa nishchay kar liya tha
 Shakespeare, referring to his form and qualities, urges him to change his determination
 saneton kaa doosraa kram ek shyamvarn mahila se sambandhit he jise prati kavi ke man main teevr aakarshan utpann hua tha kintu jisane us sneh kaa aadar na karke kavi ke us mitra ko apana pranay diya, jisko dhyaan main rakhkar saneton kaa pratham kram likhaa gaya tha
 The question of whether Shakespeare has published his inner feelings in these sennets or whether they are merely traditional works is highly disputed

 Like Sun Rise + = sunrise, at + Requires = urgent, Saints = Conference + Trustee, Sun + Indra = Rveend tax do shabd aapas main milakar ek samast pad kii rachana karte hai
 Such as Raj + son = Rajput, small + big = big and small etc
 There are six compound: dwand, dwigu, tatpurush, karmdharay, avyayibhav or bahubrihi Sentence thought is the third section of Hindi grammar in which rules related to the definition, distinction, structure, etc
 of a sentence are considered
 shabdon ke samooh ko jiskaa puraa puraa arth nikalataa he, vaakya kehete hai
 There are two essential elements of a sentence - jiske bare main baat kii jaay use uddeshy kehete hai or jo baat kii jaay use vidhey kehete hai
 For example, Mohan lives in Prayag
 isamen uddeshy- mohan he or vidhey he- prayag main rahata he
 Sentences can be distinguished in two ways- arth ke aadhaar par aath prakaar ke vaakya hote han- 1- Legislative sentences, 2- Prohibitive sentences, 3- Interrogative sentences, 4- Exclamatory sentences, 5- Objectionable sentences, 6- Desirable sentences, 7- Doubtful sentences

 In ancient times, linguistic study was basically an attempt to explain the language correctly
 sabase pehle chauthi shadi isa purv main panini ne sanskrit kaa vyakaran likhaa
 Language thinking has been happening in almost all the countries of the world
 bharat ke atirikt china, yunaan, ronm, france, england, america, rus, chekoslavia, denmark aadi deshon main bhashadhyayan ke prati atyadhik sacheshtataa barti gai he
 The history of linguistic studies can be divided mainly into two sections, for the convenience of study: paurasty paashchaatya Linguistics has a long standing tradition in India
 yahan bhashaa ke sabhi angon evam tattwo par sookshmatisookshm rup se vichaar kiya gaya he
 In short, Indian philological thinking can be presented in the following forms: pracheen bhashaa-chintan Modern philological studies bharat ke pracheen bhashaa-chintan par nimnlikhit roopon main vichaar karnaa adhik yuktisangat prathit hota he : Paninpu language panini or paninikalin bhashashastreey chintan Post Panini language study

 Speech-deliberation is a very complex subject in philology
 'vaak' vah mul shakti he, jise ham saamaajik sandarbho ke madhyam se bhashaa ke rup main grahan karte hai
 In the Veda, Saraswati has been called as the presiding deity of this speech power, in which it has been wished to confirm the world by making the speech powerful

 In order to simplify his study, 'veda-vakya' was divided into posts by creating a text and in this sequence, subjects like Sandhi, Samas, Achastra were also analyzed
 yah nishchay hi bhashaa kaa vaigyanik adhyayan tha
 After 'padpath', the preparation of sounds and learning scripts, the classification of sounds, pronunciation, accent, volume, etc

 Among the poems, Ripratisakhya, Shuklayaju: Pratishakhya, Maitrayani Pratishyakhya etc
 are prominent and Yajnavalkya, Vyasa, Vasistha etc
 are famous among the makers of the teachings

 sansar ke bhashavigyaniyon main panini kaa sthaan sarvopari he
 Not only the Pourstya scholars, but also the Western scholars have accepted Panini's superiority from Muktakantha
 isa ke lagbhag paanch sau varsh purv aisa vilakshnabhashavigyaani utpann hua tha, yah prasang vishwa ko prerit karne ke saath hi chakit karne vaala bhi rahaa he
 Panini's unique linguistic treatise, being divided into eight chapters, is called Ashtadhyayi
 aathon adhyyon main chaar-chaar paad hai
 The entire book is composed in sutra form and the total number of sutras is about four thousand
 prasiddh chaudaa maheshwar sutara hi ashtaadhi ke muladhar maane gaye hai
 The eight chapters of Ashtadhyayi discusses noun, verb, concise, causative, concord, krut and tddit suffixes, vowel-sound-disorder and verse
 parishisht main ganpaath evam dhatupath dekar granth kii upadeyata or badha di gai he
 The key features of 'ashtadhyayi' are: panini ke anya granth hai - unadisutra, linganushasan or panineey shiksha
 Katyayan and Patanjali are particularly notable in Paninikalin
 katyayan ne karthik main panini ke sutron kaa vishleshan to kiya hi, anek dosha kii ore bhi sanket kiya
 From the linguistic point of view, those signals also have great importance, because with time-changing and language-development, there is a need for change in language-related rules as well
 abtak sampoorn sansar main mahabhashyakaar ke rup main pratishthit hone kaa shrey keval patanjali ko he
 Whether or not Patanjali was a contemporary of Katyayan remains a matter of controversy
 parantu itnaa nishchit he ki mahabhashya likhane ke mul main katyaneey vaartiko kii prerana kaam karti rahi he
 The reason is that most of the great language is concerned with resolving the doubts raised by Katyayana
 patanjali kaa mukhya uddeshy un panineey sutron ko doshamukt siddh karne kaa rahaa he, jo katyayan kii drushti main yaa to doshamukt the athwa bahut upadey nahin the
 In addition, he has also presented a commentary on Ashtadhyayi's difficult formulas, which is very clear and detailed
 mahabhashya main kul 1689 sutron kii vyakhya kii gai he
 Although the basis of Mahabhashya has been Ashtadhyayi, Patanjali has elaborated the public language as it is rare elsewhere
 unka bhashavishyak adhyayan to gahan evam vyapak tha hi, bhashaa-vishleshan kii kshamta bhi unamem vilakshan thi
 Keeping in mind these three types of languages sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa, he gave the language a systematic form
 bhashaa-chintan ke kshetra main unka yah vishisht avdaan mana jaataa he
 Panini, Katyayan and Patanjali are remembered as 'munitriya'

 Not only is Bhruthari great in terms of ancient philology, but modern philologists are also deeply influenced by his thinking
 teen kando - brahmakand, vaakyakand or padakand main vibhakt vaakyapadiya bhashavigyaan kaa ek utkrisht granth he
 Very briefly the features of this book can be highlighted in the following forms: bhartruhari ke baad ke bhashaachintakon main kaundbhatta or nagesh bhatta pramukh hai
 Nagesh has given a very subtle discussion of his 'shabhendushekhar', 'definementushekhar', 'sphotism' and 'vayikaran siddhanta-manusha' texts

 The earliest known linguistic references to the Western world are found in the second chapter of the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament in relation to the naming of animals
 unani itihaaskaar herrodotus ne misr ke raja sanmeticos dwaara sansar kii bhashaa gyaat karne ke liye do navjaat shishuon par prayog karne kaa ullekh kiya he
 The oldest linguistic discourse in Greece is found in Plato's dialogue, which is predominantly Ohapahoti
 arestu paashchaatya bhashavigyaan ke pita kahe jate hai
 He expressed different views on the origin and nature of language than his Guru Plato

 They have called the language random

 The cow is not called "cow" because it is necessary to understand this particular quadruped animal with this word, but rather it is said that the word was sometimes used randomly to make sense of the said animal, which was recognized Found and those who are following the tradition, they made three distinctions of the words "noun", "verb", "nipat"

 The Greeks have tested the language from the point of view of metaphysics

 Like the Greeks, the Romans also made grammar and lexicons
 madhyayug main isai mishnariyon ko auron kii bhashaayen seekhni padi
 Preaching the people in the language of the people was mandatory for publicity

 The nineteenth century was the era of historical comparative linguistics
 The credit for its introduction is due to the introduction of Westerners from the Sanskrit language
 tulanaatmak bhashaa vigyaan kaa sutarapaat ek prakaar se us samay hua jab 2 farvari 1786 ko sar wiliam jones ne kalkatte main yah ghoshnaa kii ki sanskrit bhashaa kii sanrachana adbhut he, vah greek se adhik purna, latin se adhik samrudh or donon se hi adhik parishkrut he
 Yet it is closely related to both
 unhone dekha ki sanskrit kii ek ore greek or latin tathaa duusari or gothic, kelti se itani adhik samanta he ki nishchay hi in sab kaa ek hi strot rahaa hoga
 This family belief is at the core of this new science
 is disha main pehla suvyavasthit kaary denmark vaasi rask kaa he
 Rask stressed more on the comparison of the overall structure of languages and said that only vocabulary could be equated with incoming words
 inhone swanon ke samya ko bhi paariwarik sambandh nirdhaaran kaa mahatvapurn ang mana
 This notion was well-received by Yakov Graeme, whose Swan law is famous in linguistics
 in swan niyamon main bharat-europea bhashaa se praggermaneey main, tadnantar ucchgermaneey main honevaale vyavasthit vyanjan swan parivartanon kii vyakhya he
 Meanwhile, with the introduction of Sanskrit, the order of family comparison became more and more profound
 bop ne sanskrit, avesta greek, latin, lithuani, gothic, german, pracheen slav kelti or albani bhashaaon kaa tulanaatmak vyakaran prakashit kiya
 Rask and Grimm shed light on the Swan transformations, with Bop mainly taking the form of the morphology
 rask, grim or bop ke pashchaat maxmooler or shlikhar ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 maxmüller's important work is "lessons in the Science of Language"
 shlikhar ne bharat-europea parivaar kii bhashaaon kaa ek suvyavasthit sarvageen tulanaatmak vyakaran prastut kiya| shlikhar ne tulanaatmak bhashaa vigyaan ke saidhantik paksh par bhi vishesh kaary kiya
 According to them, if similar changes are found in two languages, then these two languages must have been together in a period
 is prakaar unhone tulanaatmak aadhaar par adibhasha kii punarrachana ke liye maarg prashast kiya
 Apart from restructuring, another major reason for linguistics is its symbolic classification of languages

 He wrote books on language development and language studies
 1876 main prakashit inak sanskrit vyakaran apane kshetra kaa adwitiya granth he
 Soon after Schlaikhar, Fick first published a comparative dictionary of indo-european languages in 1868, which also gave redesigned forms of the Adi language

 Denmark-based Warner established one such anomaly in 1875 as a ruleful exception
 yah asangati thi bharat-europea p, t, k kaa germaneey main saghosh ban janaa
 Warner found an exception to this by the comparison of Greek and Sanskrit which is popularly known as the Warner Rule
 aise apwaadon kii sthapana se vidwaanon ke ek sampradaay ko unke apane vishwaason main pushti mili

 Swan changes are not accidental and chaotic, but are fixed and well-ordered
 asangati is kaaran milti he ki ham unki prakriya ko puri tarah samaj nahin paae hai, kyoki bhashaa ke namoonon kii kami he
 There is an analogy in the origin of some inconsistencies, which was neglected by the former

 Historical comparative linguistics has also been worked on in the 20th century
 bharat europea parivaar par brugaman or delbruk evam harman hart ke tulanaatmak vyakaran mahatvapurn granth hai
 Meiya's treatise called the role of comparative study of indo-european languages can be said to be of eternal importance

 This method is derived by radio chemistry
 beesvin shatee kaa bhashavigyaan mukhyat: varnanaatmak athwa sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaha ja saktaa he
 Prominent among those who gave it a modern look are the bows, Henry Sweet and Sosur
 swiss bhashavaigyanik sosur dwaara pratipaadit siddhanton se bhi purv hambolt ne pratipaadit kiya tha ki bhashavishesh kaa adhyayan kisi anya bhashaa se tulana kiye bina usee bhashaa ke aantarik avyavon ke aadhaar par hona chahie
 Sosur, first highlighting the trend of language, considered the relation of sign and notation as an object and not a function and identified it with a linguistic mark
 chihn yadrichhik he arthath ‘sanketit’ kaa ‘sanketak’ se koi tarksangat sambandh nahin he
 There is no logic in saying 'tree' to a tree; 'P', 'A', 'D', there is nothing in the swans to be indicative of the tree, it is only due to tradition
 iske atirikt chihn kaa mulya bhashaa main prayukt puri shabdaawalee ke pariprekshya main hota he, arthath unke virodh se hota he
 Relying on the functionality of these oppositions of language is the cornerstone of descriptive linguistics
 in kii satta virodh ke siddhant par hi ashrith he
 Sosur also made a distinction between two language uses of parole and long
 pratham bhashaa kaa jivit rup he, hamaara bhaashanucchar parole he
 But there is an abstract feeling emanating from the process of second sentiment
 aapaki hindi, hamaari hindi, sabhi kii hindi vyaktigat str par uccharan, shabdaprayogadi ke bhed se bhinn he: phir bhi hindi bhashaa jaisi amoort dharna long he jo bhavanayan prakriya kaa parinaam he or jo in anek vaiyaktik bhedon se pare or saamanyakrit hai
 It is real time
 sosur kaa mahatv sanrachantmak bhashavigyaan main krantikari mana ja saktaa he
 Later many schools of Europe have developed linguistic sects of Copenhagen, Praha, London and America with some of its basic principles
 europe main sosur kii prerana se viksit ek sampradaay praah skool ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its founder was the Russian scholar Trubejkoy
 bad main iske mukhya prachaarak roman yakobasan bane
 The theory of this school is the principle of self-process, written by the book Trabezkoa
 In this school special emphasis is given to phonology
 inke yahan yah shabd ek vishesh vistrut arth main prayukt hota he
 Under this, speech is an all-round study of the function of swans and for this reason these people are called functionalists
 is sampradaay kii mahatta bhashasanrachana kii nirdharak paddati main he jisamen vichaar kiya jaataa he ki swan ikaiyaan vishisht bhashaa sambandhi vyavasthaaon main kis prakaar sanghatit hoti he
 This method is dependent on opposition
 swanatmak antar jab arthathmak antar ko bhi prakat karte hai, virodhatmak arthath swanimatmak maane jate hai
 Take for example the words 'kaal' and 'cheek' in Hindi
 inamen swanatmak antar swanimatmak he
 As a result, 'a' and 'c' are two separate separate phonemes
 yahan yah dhyaan dena chahie ki k or ga swat: swanim nahi he, ye swanim keval is kaaran hai ki arth ke anusaar ye virodhatmak hai
 Swans do not automatically determine phoneme
 The determinant of phonology is the opposing function of these swans
 is prakaar, swanim ‘k, ga’ swanon ke samaan vaastavik nahin he
 These are only the sum of abstract expressions or opposing functions
 yah virodh is sampradaay main bade vistaar ke saath varnit hua he
 Many of its model pairs, such as binomial, multilateral proportional, discordance, etc
 are defined
 nivaishamyikaran, archiswanim, sahasambadh, aadi technical shabd isi skool ke hai
 André Martine of France also used the significance of this protest in historical self-development and laid the foundation for chronological self-processing
 kalkram se utpann anek swanparivartan bhashaa kii swansanghatna main bhi antar upasthit karte hai
 These are called functional changes
 ye prakaaryaatmak parivartan bhi vyavastha se aate hai or saamanjasy athwa laghav kii disha main hote hai
 Thus the Praha School has also succeeded in rational interpretation of historical developments
 inhen dinon europe main ek anya sampradaay chal niklaa
 It is famous as 'copenhagen School', 'danish School', or 'glassymetics'
 iske prarvatak helmslave hai or inaki siddhant darshika he Omkring Sprogteorienx Grundloeggelse, 1943 angreji anuwaad hwitfield dwaara Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, 1953
 This sect remained mostly confined to the interpretation of doctrines
 par abhi in siddhanton kaa bhashavishesh par prayog atyalp maatra main hua he| is sampradaay kii mahatta isamen he ki yah shuddh rupavaadi he
 It also considers language as a system of values like Sosur, but does not want to take the support of non-linguistic elements in linguistic analysis and non-linguistic sciences such as physics, physiology, sociology etc
 vishleshan paddati shuddh bhashaparak honi chahie swayan main samarth or swayan main purna
 In this sect, expression and intent are two distinct forms of each and the form of the abstract language
 rup shuddh bhashaparak tatv he jo saar tatwon kii sanghatana vyavastha ke rup main he
 Thus the expression is formed and the structure in the form of expression is viz
, Phoneme, morph etc
 isi prakaar aashay ke saar ke antargat shabdaarth hai or rup main arthsanghatana he| Henry Sweet can be called its foundation
 iskaa vishesh parivardhan landan vishvavidhyalay ke bhashaa vigyaan tathaa swanvigyaan ke vidwaan professor farth dwaara hua he
 This school also recognizes the meaning
 iske anusaar bhashaa ek sarthak kriya he or arthprasang ke mahatv ko bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 This school discusses phonetic interpretation as well as emotional elements
 ragaatmak vishleshan america swanim vaigyanik vishleshan se bhinn he or iskaa kshetra kahin adhik vistrut he
 Positive analysis is polycentric, while phonemic science is a systematic one
 farth ne jis ragaatmak svanaprakriya kaa pravartan kiya use aage badhaanewaalon main mukhya hen robins, liance, heliday or diction
 As far as phonology is concerned, the work of Daniel Jones after Sweet under the London School is particularly notable
 yadhyapi ‘prahaskool’ or ‘copenhegan skool’ jaise shabdon ke vajan par amareeki skool namakaran uchit nahin hoga, kyonki yahan keval ek paddati par kaam nahin hua; phir bhi suvidha ke liye america skool kaha gaya he
 Boaz, Sapir, and Bloomfield are among the promoters of structural linguistics in the United States
 inamen pehle do mulat: maanavvigyaani the tathaa bhashavishleshan unke liye vyaavhaarik aavashyaktaa thi
 He has attempted to describe the languages of the American wild nations
 bluemfield nihsandeh aitihaasik tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke achche gyaata the or germaneey bhashaaon par unka purna adhikaar tha
 Bloomfield has been an inspiration for American linguistics and your book language is read with great respect
 bluemfield kii mahatta isamen he ki inhone bhashavigyaan ko vigyaan kii koti main sthapit kiya or vyakaran tathaa bhashaai vivechan ko sahi artho main vigyaan kaa rup diya
 It has been urged that the analysis and classification of the language should be done in a scientific manner
 arth kaa bhashavishleshan se koi pratyaksh sambandh nahin he
 Psychology philosophy etc
 should not be taken shelter of, nor speculate nor reveal facts in loose, ambiguous terminology
 swan niyamon kii atootata main inkaa vishwaas tha
 But Bloomfield did not throw any specific light on the analysis method
 yah kami unki agali peedi ke vidwaanon ne puri kii
 Pike discusses the analysis method in detail in "self-science" and Nida in the process
 pike ne tegmemic paddati nikaali jo ki rupaprakriya or vakyaprakriya donon main ek samaan prayukt hone se spruhaniya ho gai he
 Analysis and descriptions of several languages have been presented on this method and it has been successful everywhere
 inhen ke samakaleen jalig haris ne bhi sanrachanaatmak paddati par apni pustak likhi
 At the same time, Wells began analyzing sentences using the method of disorganized components, which was adopted by many linguists
 phir haris ke shishy choumuski ne ek nitant ganitiya evam tarksangat paddati nikaali
 This is the conversion-generation method
 This is the most modern method and has become the favorite of linguists
 ab haris ne avyavhit avyav paddati or roopantaran vishleshan paddati kii kamiyon ko dekhte hue sutara avyav kaa siddhant prastut kiya he| yah vishleshan paddati or roopantaran paddati ke bich kaa rasta he

 National Film Award 2013 for Best Direction: Shahid rajanya yaa rijal, jiskaa bair naam "betaa oryonis" he, kalpurush taramandal kaa sab se roshan tara he

 rajanya ek nila mahadaanav tara he jo hamaare suraj ke dravyaman se 17 guna dravyaman he
 Its inner luminosity is 85,000 times that of our sun
 rajanya ko angrezi main "rijal" kehete he, jo arabi bhashaa ke mul naam "ribil al-jabbaar" se aayaa he, jiskaa arth he "bhimkaay aadmi kaa bayen paaun"
 Scientists came to know in 1831 that Rajani is a double star, named "rajanya A" and "rajanya B"

 saamaajik anubhuti ankoding, bhandaaran, punah prapti, or prasanskaran he 
saamaajik manovigyaan ke kshetra main, saamaajik anubhuti in prakriyaaon sangyanatmak manovigyaan or soochna sansaadhan siddhant ke tareekon ke anusaar adhyayan kar rahe hai, jisamen ek vishisht drushtikon ko darshata he
 According to this view, there is a level of analysis that aims to understand social, psychological phenomena by examining cognitive processes that underlie them in social cognition
 drushtikon kii pramukh chintaaon main dharna he, faisle main shaamil prakriyaaon, or saamaajik uttejnaaon kii smriti kar rahe hai; jaankaree ke prasanskaran par saamaajik or bhavatmak karkon ke prabhaav ; sangyanatmak prakriyaaon kii or vyavhaar or parsparik parinaam hai
 This level of analysis can be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on interpersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes
 saamaajik anubhuti der se 1960 ke dashak or 1970 ke dashak main sangyanatmak manovigyaan kii vruddhi ke saath pramukhataa se aayaa tha or ab mukhyadhara ke saamaajik manovigyaan main prabhavi model or drushtikon he
 Social cognition theories have the idea that common information is represented in the brain as "cognitive elements" such as schemas, possession, or stereotypes
 in sangyanatmak tatwon sansaadhit kar rahe hai par dhyaan kendrit aksar karyrat he
 Social cognition therefore applies and can be identified in cognitive reasoning that extends many disciplines, theories, and norms from psychology, attention, and memory
 yah saamaajik manovigyaan hameshaa yah paramparaagat rup se is tarah ke vishwaason ke rup main aantarik maansik rajyon charchaa ke rup main, saamaanya manovigyaan ke drushtikon kii tulana main ek adhik sangyanatmak tha or mukhyadhara manovigyaan vyaavhaarikta kaa varchasv tha jab ichchhaaon he ki sambhaavna he
 Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from schema theory in cognitive psychology to describe how ideas or "concepts" are represented in the brain and how they are classified
 is vichaar ke anusaar, ham dekhte hai yaa ek maansik pratinidhitiv yaa skima association dwaara mul avadharana se judaa hua he jo anya jaankaree ke man laa "sakriy" he, ek avadharana ke bare main soch rahe hai
 This activation often occurs inadvertently
 aise skima ko sakriy karne kaa ek parinaam ke rup main, nirnay skima di gai jaankaree ke baahar kaa vistaar udhaaharan bhi dete hai sanghon ke kai ke baad se, vastav main uplabdh jaankaree se pare janaa he, jo banate hai
 These decisions are true or not, regardless of whether it can affect social cognition and behavior
 ek vyakti ko ek shikshak ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he, to udhaaharan ke liye, to ek " shikshak skima " sakriy ho saktaa he
 Later, we can associate this person with knowledge or authority, or we remember and consider important teachers' past experiences
 ek skima yah he ki yah adhik teji se sakriy he or ek vishesh sthiti main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki iskaa matlab he or adhik sulabh ho gaya he
 Two cognitive processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are prominence and instigation
 pramukhataa ek vishesh saamaajik vastu aisi sthiti main anya saamaajik vastuon ke saapeksh baahar khadaa karne ke liye jo degree he
 Priming causes a schema to be more accessible that immediately precedes any experience for a situation

 yah ek lata vaali vanaspati he jiske falon kii sabji banati he

 sutara t = 1 2 b h { \ displaystyle T={ \ frac {1}{2}}bh} main yah maan rakhane par, tribhuj kaa kshetrafal nimna prakaar likhaa ja saktaa he- t = 1 2 ab sin ⁡ γ = 1 2 bc sin ⁡ α = 1 2 ca sin ⁡ β { \ displaystyle t = { \ frac {1} {2}} ab \ sin \ gamma = { \ frac {1} { 2}} bc \ sin \ alpha = { \ frac {1} {2}} ca \ sin \ beta} 
 Additionally, sin α = sin = sin, and so on for the other two angles: t = 1 2 a b sin ⁡ = 1 2 b c sin ⁡ = 1 2 c a sin ⁡ 
 { \ displaystyle T={ \ frac {1}{2}}ab \ sin={ \ frac {1}{2}}bc \ sin={ \ frac {1}{2}}ca \ sin
} t = b 2) 2 sin ⁡ β, { \ displaystyle t = { \ frac {b ^ {2})} {2 \ sin \ beta}},} or samaan rup se yadi bhujaayen a va c gyaat hon
 t = a 2 2 = a 2 2 sin ⁡, { \ displaystyle t = { \ frac {a ^ {2}} {2}} = { \ frac {a ^ {2}} {2 \ sin}},} or samaan rup se yadi bhujaayen b va c gyaat hon
 Using Heron's formula tribhuj kaa aakaar, bhujaaon kii lambaai se nirdhaarit hota he
 Therefore, its area can also be determined by the length of the arms
 heron ke sutara dwaara: t = s { \ displaystyle t = { \ sqrt {s}}} jahaan s = a + b + c 2 { \ displaystyle { \ displaystyle s={ \ tfrac {a+b+c}{2 xxrep 4 } tribhuj kaa ardhparimaap he
 The following are three other equivalent ways of writing Heron's formula: t = 1 4 2 − 2 { \ displaystyle T={ \ frac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {^{2}-2}}} t = 1 4 2 - { \ displaystyle t = { \ frac {1} {4}} { \ sqrt {2-}}} t = 1 4 
 { \ displaystyle T={ \ frac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {}}
} Use of vector ek trivimiya eucalidian antariksh main upasthit samaantar chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal sadishon kaa upyog karke gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Let the vector AB and AC denote a to b and a to c respectively
 tab samaantar chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal nimna hoga- | AB × AC |, { \ displaystyle | \ mathbf {AB} \ times \ mathbf {AC} |,} jo sadishon AB or AC ke sadish gunan kaa pariman he
 The area of triangle ABC is half of it, 1 2 | a b × a c | 
 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}}| \ mathbf {AB} \ times \ mathbf {AC} |
} The area of triangle ABC can also be expressed in terms of scalar multiplication as follows: 1 2 − 2 = 1 2 | a b | 2 | a c | 2 − 2 
 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}}{ \ sqrt {-^{2}}}={ \ frac {1}{2}}{ \ sqrt {| \ mathbf {AB} |^{2}| \ mathbf {AC} |^{2}-^{2}}}
 \ ,} In two dimensional Euclidean space, expressing the vector AB as a free vector in the Cartesian plane and vector AC, it can be written as: 1 2 | x 1 y 2 − x 2 y 1 | 
 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1}{2}} \ ,|x_{1}y_{2}-x_{2}y_{1}|
