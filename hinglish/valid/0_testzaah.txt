 Somewhere small friction is bad

 So the number is unclear, but the certainty of Prithviraj's victory has been shown everywhere

 The battle of Sutlej was Prithviraj's first war with Ghori
 us yuddh main ghori kii ghorparaajay hui thi
 In the battle that followed the defeat of Ghori, the feudal kingdom called Paramaravanshi Sura used to go to Ghazni region every year
 satlujayuddh kaa vivaran bahutra praapt nahin hota, atah prithviraj ke ghori ke saath do yuddh hi hue ye bhramana he
 The inscription of Phalvardhika confirms the description of the Sampraana Sutlejuddha

 King Prithviraj once sat in the Rajya Sabha while ruling justly
 usee samay chandraraj naamak koi raja prithviraj ke sammukh upasthit hua
 He was the head of the kings of Chandra Raja Paschidisha
 ve rajagan bhaybheet or nirutsahit the
 Because Ghori named Yanavaraja had been attacking other territories to nurture his policy of expansion
 us yanvaraja se parrast pashchimdisha ke sabhi raja prithviraj se sahaayta kii apeksha rakhte the
 Prithviraj saw the hanging face and asked the reason for the tribulation
 chandraraj bolaa, "he rajan! pashchimdisha se ghori naamak yavanraaja anya samrajyon ko padakrant karte hue anek rajyon kaa sarvanaash kar chukaa he
 All the cities of that state which he invaded, were plundered and temples were destroyed

 Any Rajput whom he sees armed sends him to Yamlok

 " chandraraj kaa vachan sun kar prithviraj krodhi hokar khadey hue or bole, After that, Prithviraj with great pride caressed the mustache with his lips
 pashchaat prithviraj ne chaturangini sen ke saath multan pradesh par akraman kar diya
 Prithviraj had a battle with Ghori in a huge plot between Vikampur and Uchh Pradesh
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, vah yuddh 1182-83 varsh main hua hoga
 Since that war took place on the arrow of river Sutlej, hence the name of that war was called Sutlej war
 prithviraj kii vishalsena ke akraman se ghori kii sena yuddh se palaayan kar gai
 Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner
 ghori kii dayaneey sthiti hammirmahakavy main spashtatya varnit nahin he
 But there it is mentioned that, before Prithviraj, Natmastak Ghori became independent, sometimes he made the choice to give annual tax to Prithviraj
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj ne rashtrasankat ko dhyaan main rakhte huue pratikar kiya or ghori ke saath yuddh kaa nirnay liya tha
 The consequences of that war were frightening for Ghori
 kyonki us yuddh ke pashchaat ghori prithviraj kaa karadaata ban gaya tha
 On the orders of Prithviraj, a feudal named Parmavanshi Sur used to accept the Ghazni region every year
 ek baar ekaaki sur ko dekh kar turki logo ne use maar daalaa
 But Sur 74 Turk died by killing soldiers
 sur kii mrityu ke pashchaat prithviraj ne pratapsingh naamak adhikari ko kar lene ke liye niyukt kiya 
 But Pratap Singh was not loyal and pious
 vah turk-deshiyon kaa das tha
 From the Ghazni region, who used to go to the treasury of Prithviraj in the form of Dhan Kar, used to donate a large part of that wealth to the 'masjid' in Pratap Singh Marg itself and to the temples there
 koi bhi yadi daan ke vishay main kuch bhi puchhata tha, tarhi vah kahata tha ki, prithviraj ke visham grahadosh nivaaran ke liye daan de rahaa hoon
 
 prithviraj ne anek baar ghori ko bandi bana kar apamaanit kiya
 Prithviraj used to accept the annual tax as punishment from Ghori every year
 prithviraj ke kargrahan kii pushti shilalekha bhi karte hai
 Many Persian poets produced confusion about Prithviraj's tax acceptance, but the inscription named Phalvardhika from the state of Rajasthan confirms the incident of taxation of Prithviraj
 falvarddhika naamak sthal par sthit falaudidevi ke mandir ke jirnoddhar samay par us shilaalekh kii sthapana hui thi
 The inscription was installed on Thursday, 1555 on the Shuklaikadashi of the Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar
 dahaladesh ke adhipati parmarvansheey raja madhudev tha
 On the orders of his famous son Sur Prithviraj, he used to go to Gajni region every year to accept the annual punishment
 ek baar vah ekaaki hi kar lene gazani chalaa gaya
 Ghori's troops attacked the lonely Sur
 yoddha sur ne 74 yawanon ko markar ant main praan tyaage
 Nagarjuna was suppressed by Prithviraj in the year 1177, then there was a celebration in Ajmeru Prasad after Tabanagarjun Daman
 us utsav main ghori ne prithviraj ko sandhi yaa samarpan ke liye doot bheja tha
 Yada Ghori had sent an envoy to the Sapadalakshsamrajya, only then he had plans to aggress on the state of Gujarat
 atah uski ichha thi ki, chalukyavanshiyon kii or chouhan vanshiyon kii jo shatruta he, use aadhaar bana kar chouhan vansh ke saath milakar gujarat rajya par akraman kiya jaaen
 But on opposing Prithviraj, Ghori himself came out to attack Gujarat
 ekvarsh tak apane sainyavistaar kii niti par kaary karke usne 1178 varsh main gujarat par akraman kiya
 But the state of Gujarat used to have a good state
 atah usne pehle uchh pradesh par akraman kiya
 Ghori, who reached India from Multan region, wanted to attack the Uchchha region
 parantu uchhpradesh ke rajputon se vah bhaybheet ho gaya
 Ghori's victory was impossible before the Rajputs
 atah usne kapat se uchhpradesh par aadhipaty kii yojana banaai
 Ghori came to know from intelligence that the relationship of the king of Uchha Pradesh with his rajni is not simple, that is, his relationship is bitter
 atah ghori ne raji ko sandesh bheja
 In that message he wrote that, "if you kill your husband with poison, then i will marry you"
 ghori ke sandesh ke pratyuttar main raji ne likhaa, "main to prauji ho chali hoon
 What will i do by getting married? But if you marry my daughter, i can do your due work
 raji ke pratyuttar paakar ghori ne anukshan apana sammati patr bheja
 Because his purpose was to establish dominance over the northern region
 vivaahadi kaa vishay to uske kapat kaa keval bhaag tha
 Thereafter, the queen of Uttar Pradesh killed her husband with poison
 durg, koshagaar or shastraagaar ko taala markar uski chaabi ghori ko bhijwa di
 Thus, through deceit and deceit, Ghori became the ruler of the state
 ghori yada uchh pradesh kaa adhipati hua, tabausane uchhpradesh kii raji or rajkumaari ko gazani pradesh bhej diya
 When the princess came to know about her mother's act, she scorned her mother
 apane aacharan ke prati doshabhav or putree kii ghrinaa ke kaaran raji ne apane praan tyaag diye
 After that, the princess also gave up her body after suffering the misery of the world
 dow habibullah kaa mat he ki, uchhpradesh main bhattirajaaon ke shashan kaa pramaan nahin he
 Hence, the creators of Ibn Asir, Yehia Sarhindi, Nizamuddin Ahmed, Farista etc
 have called this event Kalpinik
 parantu ghori ne uchhpradesh par kapat se aadhipaty jamaaya is vishay par sabhi itihasvid sammat hai
 Ghori looted the temple of Someshwaramhadev, situated at a place called Kiradu, en route to obtaining sovereignty over Uttar Pradesh
 shiv ke wo mandir us samay rajasthanrajya main prasiddh tha
 Ghori proceeded towards the state of Gujarat by looting the grand temple which was decorated with Sundararatnas and completely destroyed that temple
 va sanderao pradesh se hote hue nadoliya ke chouhan vanshiyon kii nadol naamak rajdhani par upar akraman kiya
 At that time, the king of the feudatory Klahanvans of Chalukyavansho was ruling Nadol region
 rajasthan main sthit us nadol nagar main turk-sainiko dwaara mandiron ko agnisaat kiya gaya or nagarikon ko lut liya gaya
 Prithviraj got the news of the downfall of Nadol city by Ghori
 uske pashchaat krodh se unhone ghori ke darpabhang kii pratigya kii
 He was adorned with arms with his soldiers
 yuva prithviraj kaa mat tha ki, "chalukya or chouhan vansh kii samasya gruhasamasya he
 No mlechha from outside can attack India and kill the identity of India
 atah hamen ] ko sainya sahaayta deni chaiye"
 But pacifying the wrath of young Prithviraj, Mandaleshwar Kaimas of Sapadalaksha Empire presented his diplomatic interpretation

 apane tark ko pusht karne ke liye kaimaas ne sundope or sund naamak rakshason or tilottama kii puranic katha sunai
 As two Asura brothers named Sundop and Sandak were destroyed in the beauty of Tilottama by enamored internecine warfare, and their intention was that they would perish
 kaimaas kii is rajnatik tark kii sabhi itihasvidon ne ninda kii he
 Because thinking about his country, the young Prithviraj, after counting his problem with the Chalukyas as a householder, was ready to help the state of Gujarat
 parantu kaimaas ke jatiltark main bhrant yuva prithviraj us praant par ho rahe akraman ke drashtaa hi bane rahe
 Some historians say that, if Prithviraj would have assisted the state of Gujarat at that time, that is, had symbolized the attack on the state of Gujarat, then the situation of present-day India and present-day India would have been different
 nadol ke durg par apana aadhipaty prasthaapit kar or sampoorn nadol nagar ko lut kar ghori mirpur se sebadi main sthit hastikundi sthaan ke mandiron ko bhi lutata hua jhalody naamak sthal pahunchaa

 " is kathan kaa hi andhanukaran kuch parvarti lekhakon ne kiya
 But the archival witness proves that at that time the king of Gujarat state was Moolraj II

 In that war, the army of Gujarat State defeated turki-sena
 bahut turki sainik maare gayi, kuch rankshetra kaa tyaag karke bhaag bhi gaye
 It is mentioned in the book 'tarikhe Farishta' that Ghori somehow escaped from the battlefield while protecting his life
 sundhalekh kaa nirmaan 1319 vikram sanvatsar main hua
 The description of the defeat of Turushaka by Kelhan and Kirtipala is also found in that sundial inscription
 prithviraj vijay mahakavy me ullekh milita he ki, gujarat rajya kii vijay ke samachar dene ke liye gujarat rajya se ek doot sapadalaksh pahucha tha
 In front of Prithviraj, he explained in full detail the defeat of Turushaka
 prithviraj ne doot kaa uchit sammaan kiya or jane kii anumati di
 After that, Prithviraj made his minister aware about the national policy
 prithviraj ne kaimaas ko apni rashtraniti ke gyanavikas ke liye spashtshabd main paraamarsh diya
 Historians are of the opinion that in the middle of 1191–1192, the vast empire like Sapadalaksha was defeated by the invasion of the Turks
 uske pichhe kaimaas kii asafal kootneeti hi karanbhoot thi
 Just like Mahmud Ghaznavi attacked the state of Gujarat 150 years ago and looted the state of Gujarat, so was Ghori's Ipsa
 parantu abu parvatamala ke tal main ghori kii ghorparaajay hui
 Historians are of the opinion that Ghori's comparison with Mahmud Ghaznavi is unfit
 kyonki gaznavi kii yoddha buddhi sankatkaal main ati prakhar ho jaati thi
 Unlike him, Ghori Ghori was dissolute, sly and insidious by nature
 usne jitne yaddh jite, unamem usne kapat kaa hi maarg apanaaya
 Ghori, who was defeated in the state of Gujarat, invaded the Lahore region in the year 1182–83
 uske pashchaat ghori ke samrajya kii seemaa panjabrajya kii antimanadi ke sameep main arthath satlujanadi ke sameep main aa pahunchi
 From Sutlejanadi, the border of the Sapradalakshtra kingdom started from the other coast
 sarhind or farista ne samadalakshasamrajya ke pratham sainya awaas ko 'tapahinda' se sambodhit kiya he
 The union of Ghori's empire with the boundary of the Sapadalaksa Samajya led to a state of friction
 uske pashchaat satlujayuddh kaa yuddh hua, jis main ghori kii paraij hui
 Where did Prithviraj fight with Ghori? Scholars differ in this matter
 minhaj siraaj ne yudhakshetra kaa naam narin bataaya he
 The date of the battlefield is written in the Tarhe Farishta text
 anyatra uskaa kathan he ki, tarin ut taraayan abhi taravadi naam se prasiddh he
 Dr
 Khalik Ahmad Nizami and Dr
 Habibullah have both supported the angel book
 kyonki un donon ke mat hai ki, mudrak ke dosha se taraayan ke sthaan par narin ho gaya
 The 'tarayan' area that Dr
 Habibullah supports is 14 miles south of Thaneswar
 parantu us ke matanusaar toravana naamak sthal taraayan yuddh kshetra tha
 That Toravana region is a place adjacent to the subdivision called Kalanwat of Sirsamandal in the state of Rajasthan
 dow habibullah kaa matadhar general kaningham kaa granth he
 In the 'archaeological Survey of India', General Cunningham wrote that, the Tarain war took place in a place 27 miles away from Bathinda
 vah sthaan sadyah toravana naam se prasiddh he
 The basis of the area which Cunningham has talked about in the middle of Bhatinda and Sirsa Jallay is the book called 'yahiya Sirhindi'
 yahia sarhindi naamak lekhak ne 'tarikhe mubarakashahi' naamak pustak main ullikhit kiya he ki, khittaye surasuti kaa yuddh tarinashetra main hua tha
 'date Mubarak Shahi' has been edited by Shamsulumma Muhammad Hidayat Hussain on the basis of people's handiwork, some of them are also in Azamgarh district of Rajasthan state
 azamgarh zille kii darul-musannaphin-sthaan ke tino hastpratiyon main se ek main "khitatye sarasuti" ke sthaan par keval "sarasuti", "mentarin" ke sthaan par "tarai" hi mudrit kiya gaya he
 In fact, that war was the only Narayan region
 tabakaate nasiri or tarikhe-mubaratshahi kaa bhi yahi mat he
 In the pure printed historical text of 'yahiya Sirhindi', the battle took place in Narayankshetra, situated in the 'terai' on the arrow of Saraswatini
 farsibhasha ke mulpath main kahin bhi dosha nahin he, parantu aangal anuwaad dekhakar yaa agyaanavash ye dosha pravisht hua he
 Thus a dispute arose regarding the battlefield
 itihasvidon kii charchaa kaa nishkarsh he ki, prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath yuddh narineshetra main hi hua tha 
 It is strongly supported by many historians
 un main pro es ech hodivaala bhi antarbhoot hote hai 
 Therefore, from the geographical and historical facts, the name of the battlefield was Narayan
 kyonki taravadi ye sthalan narineshetra se samipatam sthal he, atah narin-taravadi-yuddh bhi kaha jaataa he hai
 The knowledge of Torwana Sthal in the district of Sirsa as a Narayan battlefield was the result of misleading references
 dilli se narineshetra 135 ki
me dur he, thaneshwar se narineshetra 21 ki
me dur he
 This has also been mentioned in the book 'date Farishta'
 kaningham dwaara ullikhit toravana-sthal dilli se 342 kimi dur he, atah bhugolic vivaran anusaar bhi general kaningham kii soochna mathyaa siddh hoti he
 From 1175 to 1191, Ghori made many attacks in the neighboring regions of India and in Indian states
 1190 varsh main narin kaa pratham yuddh hua tha
 Ghori was defeated in that war and Prithviraj also made Ghori a point
 ghori ne 1190 varsh main pratham baar suniyojit rup se sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar akraman kiya tha
 Ghori attacked the Sarhind-site of Sapradalakasamrajya by crossing the Sutlej river
 sarhind ke durg ke sainiko dwaara ghori kaa pratikar kiya gaya, parantu ghori ne u durg par aadhipaty sthapit safalataa paali
 Ghori Ziauddin Tolki ruled over the fort of Sirhind and established his dominion and went back to Gajni state
 jiyauddin tolki ne 'tabakaate nasiri' naamak pustak ke lekhak minhaj ke chachaa kaa putr tha
 Regarding his brother, Minhaj has written that, Ghori had appointed 12,000 cavalry soldiers to protect the fort
 'tarikhe farista' naamak pustak main ashwarohion kii sankhya 1040 praapt hoti he 
 When Prithviraj got the news of the attack on the fort of Sirhind, he proceeded to the state of Sirhind with his feudatories
 prithviraj kii sena main 2,00,000 ashvorohi or 3,000 hathi the
 It is mentioned in the angel book that, Prithviraj started the yatra with the Vishalsena towards Sirhind state
 When it became known to Ghori, he too started the journey towards Sirhind with a huge force
 sadyah jo sthal 'taravadi' naam se prasiddh he, wo sthal tab narin tha, us kshetra main donon senaaon ke madhya main bheeshan yuddh hua tha
 Narration's description of the war is found in a book called 'farishta'
 vahaan ullikhit ha ki, rajputon kii vyuhabaddh vishalsena ko jab ghori ne dekha, tab vah bhi apni sena ko vyuhabaddh karne ke liye sena ko teen bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya
 Seeing the army of Rajputs, Ghori's mind became enlightened
 paraajay ke bhay se usne sheeghra hi apni sena ko teen bhaag main vibhajit kiya kyonki rajputon kii sena ke teen bhaag the
 The army of the central division was led by Ghori
 teen bhaago main vibhakt prithviraj kii sena main madhyabhaag kii gajasena prabal akraman karne ko sajj thi
 The main responsibility of the invasion in Prithviraj's army was that of the cavalry
 ashwarohi sena ke prishth main teen vibhaag main vibhakt talavaardhari sainik or shuldhari sainik the
 In the middle of Padati and Gajasena was Bhattarakaparameshwar as the commander
 vahi apane priyagaj par arurh bharateshwar prithviraj yuddh kaa netritv kar rahe the
 When the army was divided into three parts to symbolize its enemies, the responsibility of fierce attack against the army was left and south
 samartantra ke bhaag rup senapati asi vyuharachna banaate hai
 The two armies started fighting towards each other
 sarvapratham prithviraj ke prishthbhag kii ashwarohinee sena ne ghori kii vambhag or dakshinbhaag kii sena par akraman kar diya
 Ghori's soldiers were not powerful in tolerating that deadly attack
 atah praanon kii raksha ke liye sena ke madhyabhaag kii ore palaayan karkane lage
 Thus Turaksena's array collapsed
 ghori ke sabhi vibhaag mishrit ho chuke the
 Many paramilitary were killed by the destruction of that array
 rajputon ke akraman se turksena ke diggaj sainik bhi rankshetra ko tyaag kar palaayan kar gayi
 After the beginning of the war Ghori went towards the feudal Govind of Dehli Pradesh
 ghori ko apni ore aate dekh govind bhi uske saath yoddh karne ke liye aage gayi
 Then both of them fought
 ghori ne govind ke upar apane shul se prahaar kiya
 That shul entered the mouth of Govind
 shulprahaar se govind ke daant bhi gir gayi
 Shul entered from the mouth of Govind and went to the gorge
 uske pashchaat govind ne bhi pratiprahaar kiya
 Govind struck Ghori's arm with a stroke of his prick
 wo aghat ati shaktishaalee tha
 Frightened Ghori changed the direction of his horse and fled the battlefield
 parantu aahat ghori bhoomi par gir gaya
 Ghori was taken captive by the Rajput soldiers
 is prakaar prithviraj ne turk sainiko par purnatah aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 Minhaj's book mentions that Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner
 uske pashchaat ghori dwaara kshamaa yachana karne par prithviraj ne turk ke sainiko ke saath ghori ko mukt kar diya
 Ghori's army was not massacred during Prithviraj's victory
 prithviraj ne sabhi sainiko ko sakushal turk kii ore bhej diya tha
 This generosity of Prithviraj has been criticized by Indian nationalist historian Devara Katu
 itihasvidon ke matanusaar narin ke dwitiya yuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay kaa mukhyatam kaaran ghori kii mukti thi 
 Historian Dr
 Bindhyanath Chauhan says that slaughter of a refugee is prohibited in Indian culture
 parajeet sena ke aahat sainiko par hatyachaar bhartiya yuddh parampara ke anugun anuchit tha
 Because in Manusmriti it is said that - na bhitan na paraavrittan sataan dharmamanusmaran
 7
93 manusmriti
 That is, slaughter of those whose weapons have been destroyed, who are being consumed by mourning, who are seriously hurt, who are afraid, who are sailing with war
 pratham narinyuddh main ghori kii paraajay ke anantar prithviraj ke aadesh se mukt kiya gaya ghori lahore gaya
 There his soldiers were waiting for him
 lahore pradesh main ghori do maas tak rukaa
 Because the disease was necessary for the physical body of Ghori hurt in war
 do maas ghori dwaara lahore durg kaa navnirmaan bhi karavaaya gaya
 Thereafter, he went to Ghazni region with his army
 isami ke kathananusaar gazani pradesh pahuchakar ghori ne gaznavi-vansh ke khushro malik naamak raja or uske putr ko mrityudand diya
 Ghori reached Gajni state and punished the soldiers who had fled the battlefield in the first battle of Narayan
 'farista' naamak pustak main ullekh he ki, ghori jab gazani pradesh pahucha, tab usne afganpradeshy sainiko ko to peeda nahin di, parantu ghori-vansheey, khurasaani-vansheey or khalji-vansheey sainiko kaa apmaan karke unako dand diya
 Ghori tied the city full of unruly young men in the face of those soldiers and marched them
 ghori kaa aadesh tha ki, jo sainik syut se apakv yavon ko na khaaen, unke shir sharir se pruthak kiye jaayen
 Ghori's mood during the Narayan war was filled with depression, tribulation and self-aggression
 tabakaate nasiri or tarikhe farista ityadi granthon main ullekh he ki, ghori itnaa duhkhi ho gaya tha ki, usne ann or jal kaa bhi tyaag kar diya tha
 Day and night he kept burning in the fire of his defeat
 vah apni patni ke paas bhi shayan nahin karata tha
 After this, Ghori again got embellished for the war with the inspiration of her mother
 
 Once Ghori was sitting with Aibak reviewing the defeat in the Narayan war
 tab ghori ko aibak ne kaha, hamaare ashv uttam hai, parantu bhartiya hathion ke mukh dekhakar ve bhaybheet ho jate the
 Because he had never experienced war with Indian elephants before
 atah bhartiya hathion ke sameep ve bhaybheet the
 This is the main reason why we were defeated in front of the Indian Army
 apane paraajay ke kaaran ko ko jaanakar ghori ne agrim yuddh ke purv ashv prashikshan kaise karnaa chaiye? iskaa bhi upaay abak ko kaha
 He said, make weapons out of wet clay and wood
 un hathion ko vaise hi sajaao, jaise bhartiya hathi saje hote hai
 After that, make the horses fearless by making a situation of war by the cavalry around those elephants
 is prakaar yuddh samay main bhartiya hathion ke sammukh upasthit ho te hue bhi ashv nirbhik ho kar unka pratikar karne main sakasham ho jaayenge
 As advised by Ghori, Aibak underwent horse training
 vah swayan bhi yuddh sambaddh nition ko rachane laga
 He created a mobile-military contingent
 us sachal dal kaa mukhya kaary tha ki, yuddh ke samay yadi kisi vyuh ke sainik durbal ho jaaen, tarhi yah dal yuddh kshetra main ek dal se apper dal main jaakar yuddh kar sake
 In this way, if the strength of any party in the war zone is weakened, then this team can balance its force in the war zone by helping that additional team
 ashv par arurh hue sainik baan chalaane main bhi sakasham hone chaiye, atah abak dwaara apane sainikon ko prashin diya gaya tha
 The description of Aibak's strategy is not found in the Persian-language historical literature, but it is mentioned in the book of the famous war scientist A
 A
 Smail
 isami dwaara likhit phutuhussalatin naamak pustak main ek kavach kaa bhi varnan praapt hota he
 The name of that armor was 'karva'
 vah kavach belon ke charm se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Cotton or wool was installed on both sides of that armor
 bhartiya sena yada turk kii sena ke padaati par prahaar karen, tab ve turk sainik aahat na ho jaye ye us kavach nirmaan kaa uddeshy tha
 Thus Ghori, together with Aibak, formulated a proactive policy and defensive policy
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori kii sena main afgaan sena, turk sena, tajik sena or tulak sena ke vibhinn senapati the
 The names of some generals are found in a book called Futuhussalatin
 yatha – 1
 Kharbak - It had a demon-like body
 ye agrim dal kaa senapati tha
 2
 Alba - was the commander of the left department army
 3
 mukalba – kendriya sena kaa yoddha tha
 4
 Kharmel - was a warrior of the Central Army
 5
 kutbuddin aibak – sena kii sampoorn satta kaa mahaprabandhak tha
 It always remained near Ghori in the battlefield
 6
 tazuddin yalduj – kisi dal kaa senapati tha
 7
 Nasiruddin Kubacha - He was leading the haraval-dal
 8
 mohammad bin mahmud – ye bakhtiyaar khalji kaa chachaa tha
 It was a committed and skilled commander
 ye sabhi senapati ran kshetra main sena kaa sanchaalan karne main daksh the
 Except for Ghori's army, these generals also had their own personal army
 minhaj ke kathanananusaar ghori dwaara bharat yatra ke kuch samay purv hi tulaki ke aagrah se tulak-vanshiyon ke 12,000 ashwarohi ko apni sena main samavisht kar diye the 
 1191 Tame Varsha Ghori, in particular: Bharat per Yatram
 peshawar pradesh or multan pradesh hote hue ghori lahore pradesh pahunchaa
 Ghori also started a conspiracy against Prithviraj by staying in the fort of Lahore
 ek ore vah apane sainya vyavasthaapan, sainya prashikshan or guptchar bhejne ke kaary main vyast tha, duusari ore usne apane doot ko ajayameru durg bheja
 Although he knew what Prithviraj would reply to his letter, he sent the messenger to the fortress of Ajayameru
 kyonki vah keval samay vyateet karnaa chahta tha
 His aim behind that was, his army could be equipped for war and allied loyalty could be tested again
 ghori kaa doot prithviraj ke sammukh upasthit hua
 He read the letter provided by Ghori
 us patr main ullikhit tha ki, prithviraj ! apane kaanon main paradheenata kaa aabhushan pahan kar mere prasaad upasthit ho kar tum islam-dharm kaa angikaar karo 
 Other Persian writers have also supported the said statement
 farista main milita he ki, ghori apni sena ke saath lahore pradesh pahunchaa, tab kwamulmulk rukunuddin hamja ne ajayameru durg ko apana sandesh dene ke liye bheja tha
 In it, the message "king should follow Islam" was written
 farista naamak granth main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne yada doot ke mukh se sandesh suna, tabaunhone islam-dharm ke liye abhadra bhashaa kaa upyog kiya
 Prithviraj had also uttered abuses to the kings followers of Islam
 phir kwamulmulk ko waapas bhej diya tha
 In the year 1990, after defeating Ghori, Prithviraj's empire was counted as the main power of India
 prithviraj ke samarthy se virodhiyon ke hriday main shoolaghatavat peeda utpann hone lagi
 Those kings who were defeated by Prithviraj were ready to take the opportunity to strike Prithviraj
 jammu pradesh kaa raja vijayadev ghori kaa pramukh sahaayak ban baitha
 In Prabandhasagraha and Prithviraj Raso Kavya, mentions of the help of Ghori of Jammupathi are received
 nayachandra suri ne apane pustak main likhaa ha ki, jammupradesh ke raja ne apane putr narsinghdev ko apni sena ke saath narineshetra main bheja tha
 The historian named The Hague has mentioned in his book that, all the kings of India were present in the second war of Naranaya, but even to protect national independence, King Jayachand of Kannauj region did not help his son Prithviraj
 usne narin ke pratham yuddh main bhi yuddh nahin kiya
 It was due to the defeat of Prithviraj in the Second World War of Narayan that the position of Muslim power in India became stronger, because Jaichand made a treaty with the commoners
 jems tod ke matanusaar kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand or patan pradesh ke raja ne prithviraj ke samoolnaash ke liye mohammad ghori ko aamantran diya tha 
 King Chandel of Jejakabhukti Pradesh was also an ally of Ghori
 jesalmer pradesh kaa shalivahanabhaati-vansh to ghori ke aashirwad se hi rajasukh kaa upbhog kar rahe the
 In the war, the Hamletbhati dynasty was carrying the important responsibility of Ghori's army
 sapadalakshasamrajya ke prativeshi raja dwaara ghori kii aarthiksahaayta, sainyasahayta or suchnasahayta kii thi
 Yada Ghori with his military reached near the border of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom, then the states around the Tadapalakshtra-empire started to rise at the border of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom
 unka uddesh tha ki, chaaron ore se yuddhrat prithviraj kaa sanybal vibhakt ho jaayegaa
 At the time of the Second Narayan War, it happened according to his plan
 prithviraj kii sena sapadalakshasamrajya ke vibhinn kshetron main yuddh kar rahi thi
 The prince general of Sapradalakshmrajya was engaged in those wars during the war of Narayan
 prithviraj ke anya udayraj naamak senapati bhi anyatra yuddhrat the
 After defeating Ghori in the first Narayan war, Prithviraj became the subject of discussion in the regions of North India
 prithviraj ke bhootpurv shatru unke patan kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 So Yada Ghori fought with Prithviraj, then the kingdoms of Prithviraj attacked the kingdom of Prithviraj
 un rajyo main makhyatya sapadalakshasamrajya ke purv-dakshin-seemaa ke kannauj, kalinger, anhilpatan rajya the
 Bhimdev's mother Naikidevi was the daughter of Paramardev, the ruler of the Chandelvanshi of Jejakabhukti
 1182-83 varsh main un donon rajyon kii bhi prithviraj dwaara parijay hui thi
 On the other hand, furious Jayachand wanted to see the destruction of Prithviraj somehow
 narin ke pratham yuddh ke anantar hi sanyogita haran kii ghatana hui thi
 The historians who studied the conditions then said that Prithviraj was always in the Digvijay expedition, then he did many kings
 parantu prithviraj ne sab ko jeevandaan de diya
 Thus there was no increase in Prithviraj's army or range from the Digvijay campaign, but the number of his enemies was increasing daily
 shatruon kaa manbhang karke unako jeevandaan dena hi prithviraj kii paraajay kaa mukhyakaaran bana
 Under the coincidence, Prithviraj started spending more time with the newly married Sanyogita
 jisase ajayameru prasaad main kisi dushchakr kaa udbhav hua
 a rage named Prithviraj's Padmavati became envy in the mind of coincidence
 ajayameru prasaad main un donon ke madhya baaran baar kalah hone lage the
 Padmavati, neglected by Prithviraj, tried to occupy Prithviraj with the use of captivity
 usne tantrik vidhi ke chalate ek garbhvatee gaay kii hatya kar di
 After that, after breeding the cow, he started his tantric method
 tantrikavidhi ke siddh hone pashchaat prithviraj padmavati ke vasheebhoot ho gaye
 When Prithviraj was tied up in Padmavati's Tantrapash, then another unfortunate incident happened in Prasad
 sapadalakshasamrajya ke kaimaas naamak mahamandaleshwar prithviraj kii anupasthiti main samgr rajkaarya dekha karte the
 He was tied up in an illicit relationship with a maid named Camas Karnati
 samay praapt hote hi ve donon ratri ke andhkaar main rajbhavan main apni kamlila kaa aacharan karte the
 Once in the night, Padmavati saw Camas in a raid with that handmaid in a cell of Prasad
 padmavati ne prithviraj ko kaimaas ke kamprapanch kii chugali kar di
 Prithviraj Cho was confined in Padmavati's Tantrapash, so Prithviraj was unable to make the proper decision in the confusion
 tatpashchaat kaimaas jab raatri main daasi ke saath kaammagn tha, tab prithviraj vahaan pahunche or unhenne vahiin kaimaas kaa vadh kar diya
 The Kaimas had sinful relations with the maid, it was the misfortune of Ajayameru Prasad
 parantu puratanprabandhsangrah main kaimaas ke vadh kaa kaaran "deshadroh" ullikhit kiya gaya he
 According to the ancient management, Pratap Singh, the revenue officer of Prithviraj, used to go for tax acceptance in the Ghazni region
 ek baar garjani pradesh main 'masjid' ko pratapsingh ne ek laksh panon kaa daan de diya
 Sometimes the Kaimas said to the king, "O God, the wealth we get in the form of tax from the Ghazni region makes us king
 parantu rajasav adhikari pratapsingh us dhan kaa aise kaaryon main durvyay kar dete hai"
 When the king asked Pratapsingh about the accusation of Camas, he said, "dev! Knowing the adverse effect on you, i had spent that money
 kyonki jyotishi ne aapke jivan main ksht ke vishay main mujhe bataaya tha"
 Pratapsingh followed the censure in Prithviraj's ears, against the Camas
 vah bolaa, dev ! mantri kaimaas hi baar baar turk-janon ko yahan bulaate rahete hai
 On hearing Pratap Singh's words, the angry Prithviraj killed Camas
 ukt donon kathanak main satya or asaty kaa pareekshan kar to nahin sakate, parantu uplabdh pramaanon se do vishyo kii spashtataa ho rahi he
 One was many members of Ajayemaru rule in contact with the intelligence system of Ghori, Pratapasih was the chief among them
 dwitiya kaimaas ke vadh kii bhi pushti hoti he
 But it is not known in the treason or in the camp
 phutuhussalatin naamak pustak ke anusaar ajayameru pradesh ke rajaprasaad main kaimaas ke vadh kaa samachar ghori ke guptcharo ne gazani pradesh pahuchaya tha
 There are many arguments about the date of the Second Narayan War
 vibhinn pustako main vibhinn tithiyaan praapt hoti hai
 Those books can be divided into three departments
 ve vibhaag hai prithviraj raso ke, farsi lekhako ke or bhartiyarot ke anusaar tithiyaan
 Sanivasar Sankranti Crook
 shravan addho maas
 That is, Prithviraj had a battle with Ghori on the day of Shani Vamsar of 1158 Vikram Samvatsar
 us samay shravan maas aadha vyateet ho chukaa tha ouk karkasacranti thi
 Many of the dates mentioned in Prithviraj Raso Kavya have contradicted it
 kyonki anek bhartiyagranth or anya farsi granth bhi anya tithi kaa upasthaapan karte hai
 Hasan Nizami has mentioned in the book titled Tajul Masir that, in 'hijrisan' 587, Ghori started his journey from Ghazni region to India
 narin yuddh main vah paraajay hua tha, tatpashchaat narin yuddh main vijayi ghori ne 'hijrine' 588 ke 'ramajaan' maas main haansi pradesh ke upar akraman kiya tha
 Aibak was in the state of Kohram at that time and he also started traveling towards Hansi to support Ghori
 gulshane ibrahimi naamak pustak main farista ne ullikhit kiya he ki, hi
 sa
 587 main ghori ne gazani pradesh se yatra armbh kar 588 hi
 narin ke yudhakshetra par pahunchaa
 a comparative study of the date mentioned in the Farsigranthoe gives some guidance about the date of the war
 1190 varsh ke janvari maas ke untiis ve dinank ko yuddh kaa armbh hua tha, tatpashchaat 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank ko yuddh purna ho chukaa tha
 That is, at any time before the twenty-ninth day of January 1190, Ghori started traveling towards India
 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank se purv ghori ne narin yuddh main vijay paa lee thi
 According to the Persian text, Yavanmas, called 'ramadan', was about to begin
 1191 varsh ke janvari maas kii satraa dinank ko yadi 'ramajaan'-maas hoga, to hi farsigranth main ullikhit tithi kaa pramanya sidhya hota he
 H
 The Yavanpanchang of the year starts from 1 Muharram

 That day was Shanivasara
 'ramajaan'-maas yavanpanchang ke anusaar dasavaan maas he, atah 1192 varsh ke sitambar maas kii dasmi dinank ko 'ramajaan'-maas kaa armbh hua tha
 Nizami states that the war of Narayan was completed even before the 'ramadan' month
 atah 1192 varsh ke janvari-maas kii satraa dinank se, 1192 varsh ke sitambar-maas kii dasmi dinank tak narin kaa yuddh purna ho chukaa tha
 The period of war would have been known in the Persian texts, but the exact date of the second war of Narayan is not known
 jainacharya jinaprabhusuri dehali ke raja mohammad tughlaq ke samakaleen the
 There are many evidences of both of them
 vah jainacharya kanyanayaniyamhavirapratimakalp naamak pustak ke rachanaakaar hai
 Historians are of the opinion that this book is more useful than Khartargachhapattavali
 kanyanayaniyamhavirapratimakalp ke barahawein kalp main ullekh praapt hota he ki, 1248 vikram sanvatsar main yada chouhankuldivakar shreeprithviraj kii hatya ghori ne kar di, tatpashchaat ajmeru prasaad main turkon kaa aadhipaty ho gaya
 Therefore, Mahashresthi Ramdev, the minister of Ajayameru, issued the information that, "before Yavan destroys the idols of Jainsangh, before that all the Jainacharya idols should be protected by making a secret cavity in the land"
 1248 vikram sanvatsar main ustaraanshilaalekh kaa nirmaan hua tha
 There were many dilapidated Jain temples and Veer Smarak mills from Rajasthan

 In those inscriptions it is mentioned that a monk named Rajnimitta Gohilvanshi Raji of Rana Motishwara was followed by Satidharma to Krishnawasthi Somvasar of Jyeshthamas of 1248 Vikram Samvatsara
 rana motishwara kii maranatithi ko hi vijayraj naamak uskaa putr bhi hutatma hua tha ye anya shilaalekh main ullikhit kiya gaya he
 Along with Motishwara and Vijayaraja, the names of many souls are found in inscriptions
 ukt tithi ke annusaar 1192 varsh ke may-maas kii chauthi dinank ko vah shilaalekh nirmit hua tha
 Therefore, before that date, those heroes died in a war, it is proved
 goth maangalod naamak sthaan se bhi anya shilaalekh praapt hua he
 That inscription was also quoted on the said date
 us shilaalekh ke anusaar jaisingh ke veergati ke pashchaat anek rajniyaan sati ho gai thi
 Shuklachaturdashi of Vaishakhamas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar, received from a place called Bajlu), satirised his demise on the day of Somavasar when a parampramukh was killed
 vividhtirthakalp or anyashilalekhon ke aadhaar par tithion kaa samanjasy sthapit kar sakate hai
 The above evidences prove that before the fourth day of May-month of 1192 year, Ghori won the Narayan war
 tatpashchaat usne ajayameru par swadhikaar prasthaapit kar liya tha
 The adoption of the Persian texts, the Indian texts and the Indian inscriptions confirm that the overall event of the war took place from the eighth day of February-11 of the year 1192 to the twenty-seventh day of April-11 in the year 1192
 narin ke yuddh kii vaastavik tithi ke gnanarth 1685 vikram sanvatsar main likhit rajavali kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn sidhya hua he
 For the first time in the year 1953, Jainshityacharya Agarchand Nahata published that Rajavali
 1953 varsh main dow dasharath sharma ke 'agyaat kartruk indraprastha prabandh ke kalevar' naamak pustak main wo aavali prakashit kii gai thi
 It is written in the genealogy that Tejpal established the suzerainty of Dehli by imprisoning Diwakar, son of Prithviraj's brother-in-law, Visalpal, on the Krishnadvittiya date of Chaitramas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar
 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii shukladwitiya tithi ko ghori ne tejpal ko parajeet kar dehali par aadhipaty kar liya
 The above evidences prove that the dehli did not fall before 17 March and Prithviraj died before 17 March
 narin yuddh ke anantar ghori kii sainyagatividhi ke bhi pramaan uplabdh hote hai
 In the book titled Tajul Masir, Hasan Nizami has mentioned that Ghori first reached ajayameru-prasad after the Narayana war, then he won Dehli
 hasan nijaami ke kathan kaa samarthan 'lubb tawaarikhe hind' naamak pustak bhi karata he 
 According to Rajavali, on the Krishnadvittiya date of Chaitramas of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar, Tejpal fled from Delhi to Delhi after escaping from Narayan Yudh
 aanglapatchang ke anusaar 1192 varsh ke march-maas kii tritiy dinank thi
 The war of Narayan was completed in the third strike
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj ko sambhavtah teen baje yaa chaar baje turksainiko ne bindi banaaya hoga
 Tejpal must have fled the battlefield at the same time and left for Delhi

 Even if he has gone at a rapid pace, his journey must have ended in two days
 is prakaar narin kaa yuddh 1192 varsh ke march-maas kii pratham dinank ko ravivaasar ke din purna hua hoga
 According to Bharatiya Panchang that day was Holika festival
 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke phalgun-maas kii poornima tithi ko hindooon ke rakt se narin kaa yudhakshetra ranjit hua tha
 According to the opinion of Shri Harihar Niwas Dwivedi, the probable date of the post-narayan war may be the following
 • 1 march – narinyuddh kii samaapti • March 5 - Ghori takes Prithviraj to Ajayemaru
 • 11 march – prithvaaraj kaa hutatma hona
 • March 13 - Govind surrenders the kingdom of Ajayameru
 • 17 march – dehali kaa patan Prithviraj defeated Ghori in Narayankshetra in the year 1190
 tatpashchaat ekvarsh ke abhyaantar main ghori dwaara apane sainyashakti main vruddhi kii gai
 On the other hand, Prithviraj was busy in the field of Indian politics for a year
 unhone us varsh bhi anek yuddh lade the
 The political background of India in 1190 years, that background was contrasted in one year
 rajputon ke antajkalah vishalkay ho chuke the
 The north Indian kings were constantly engaged in inter-war
 ghori dwaara rajput raajaaon kii paraspar sangharsh kii sthiti kaa laabh liya gaya or prithviraj ke upar punah akraman kiya gaya
 In the battlefield of Narayan, Ghori was "adorned to win any form of victory"
 duusari ore prithviraj kii sainyasajjataa hi nahin thi
 Ghori knew how much Prithviraj's military strength is and that Prithviraj is not equipped for war
 prithviraj kii yuddh sambaddh asajjataa ke vishay main hammirmahakavye vivaran praapt hota he
 It is mentioned in the Hammirmahakaavya that Udayaraja, the commander of Prithviraj, arrived late in the battlefield of his army
 prithviraj ke pradhan to narin yuddh main bhaag bhi nahin le sakaa
 Because he was engaged in another war
 viruddhavidhividhvansh naamak granth ke 17 shloke main bhi ese varnan praapt hote hai
 It was necessary for Prithviraj to have a delay in the war, but Ghori was ready to fight by taking advantage of the weakness of Prithviraj
 ghori or uske adhikari yudhyojna ke vishay main bahut kuch pariklpana karke yuddh ke liye sajj the
 When they ?, where? and how ? All of this had been thought by them to attack Prithviraj's army
 The army that Ghori had in Narayan area was divided into four divisions
 us sena ke sainik bhaar viheen shastron or bharasahit ashwon se sajj thae
 The army, which was divided among the Chora divisions, was adorned to attack the Indian Army in all four directions
 jo sena chaaron vibhaag main vibhakt thi, unke atirikt 10,000 sainikon ke ek dal kii rachana ghori ne kii thi
 The 10,000 soldiers were able to wield arrows despite mounting on the horse
 ghori dwaara unako aadesh diya gaya tha ki, wein sarvada shatruon ke saath vam, dakshin, agr or prishth bhaag se yuddh karen
 Further, Ghori had ordered that the cavalry, bearers and elephants of the Indian Army should come forward to attack, and then go backwards and make as much difference as possible between them and the enemy
 ghori kii ye niti bharti sainikon main bhram utpaadit karne ke liye thi
 By the said policy, if the Turksmen conduct in the battlefield, then there is confusion among the Indian soldiers that all the Turksena soldiers are in the battlefield
 ghori kii ranneeti kii vibhinn pariyojna vibhinn pustakon main praapt hoti he
 As it is mentioned in the book Yehia Sarhindi, that the elephants of the Hindus and the horsemen invaded any of the Turksena Dalis, while the other parties attacked from all three directions
 isami ke pustak main bhi ullikhit he ki, narin ke prathamyuddh ke anantar ghori kaa chintan tha ki, bhartiya hastion kii upasthiti main turkdeshiy ashv bhaybheet the, atah dwitiya yuddh main hamen mukhyatya hathi par hi prahaar karne hai
 For this, horse were also trained by Ghori in Ghazni region along with Aibak
 ukt sainya yojana ke saath ghori ne sampoorn raatri sainya sajjataa main vyateet kii
 On the other hand, Prithviraj's army was under deep sleep the whole night
 brahmamuhoort main ghori kii sena prithviraj kii shivi par chaaron ore se akraman karne ke liye sajj thi
 At the time when Prithviraj's soldiers were sleeping, Ghori attacked
 yuddh ke armbh main sway prithviraj bhi nidra main nimagn the
 Some soldiers were busy with daily tasks
 998 varsh main yatha lamgaan-yuddh main hua tha, tathaev narin yuddh main bhi hua
 The Supt Rajput army was attacked by armor, armed and cavalry
 chaalis sahasr se adhik turksainikon ne prithviraj kii sena ke upar aksmaat akraman kar diya tha
 By the time all were decorated, the situation had become like a cataclysm
 anek rajputsainiko kii yudhshibir main hi mrityu ho chuki thi
 Prithviraj's more powerful army was destroyed in that attack
 itihasvidon ke mat he ki, narin kaa dwitiya yuddh vaastavik yuddh nahin tha, api tu durghatana hi thi
 In that war neither elephants or horsemen were used in war, nor any Rajputs could make war
 aashcharyachakit sab praanantak vednaa se aahat yamalok chale gayi
 Most soldiers could not even bathe, some could not even reach near the horse, many Rajput soldiers were killed even before the declaration of war
 us akraman main akramanakari hi shubhasthiti main the, kyonki unhone akraman kaa kaal or sthaan nirdhaarit kiya tha
 He himself was leading Ghori's Central Army
 uske vam bhaag main ilaah naamak senapati or dakshin bhaag main mukalba naamak senapati tha
 The advance team was led by a warrior named Kharbak
 kharmel naamak yoddha apni sena ke saath ghori ke prishth bhaag main niyukt tha
 Qutbuddin Aibak was leading all the departments
 vah sarvada ghori ke sameep hi bana rahata tha
 At that time, Ghori's army consisted of 1,03,000 cavalry
 ghori kii sena kaa prayek sainik 'jihar' naamak kavach se susajjit tha
 Ghori's reserve army consisted of 12,000 aggressive warriors
 wein sab bhi 'jihar' naamak kavach se, loh ke mukut se or asi, dhanush or shul ke saath susajj the
 Prithviraj's army was shattered by the sudden invasion of the Ottoman forces
 sainiko kaa netritv karne ke liye koi bhi samarth nahin tha
 At that time a commander named Govind Rai of Dehli led an army of Rajputs
 usne apni sena ko ekatrit karke turk sena ke viruddh yuddh armbh kar diya
 While Govind Rai was leading the war, other army chiefs also joined him
 kendriya sena kaa netritv pithora ne kiya
 Padmasha Rawal, the president of the left-wing army of Govindarai and the commander of the army of the south, named Bhuvanackamall, were leading the troops of the Nijsena
 gownd raay ne hathisena ke saath khabarak ke agrim dal par akraman kar diya
 Khabarak somehow protected himself
 tatpashchaat usne apane sainikon ko aadesh diya ki, "apane baanon se keval hathion par akraman karo"
 According to Khabarak's orders, the Turksmen attacked the elephants and the Mahavats
 hathisena ke 54 chauvan hathi turk sainikon ke baanon se aahat ho gaye
 Due to which the elephants of the Indian army will be made here isami ke varnan anusaar iske pashchaat hi hindoosena paraajay kii ore unmukh hui
 It is mentioned in the angel that, according to Ghori's order, his army was divided into four divisions
 ghori kaa aadesh tha ki, sabhi vibhaag hindoosena ke saath milakar nahin, api tu vibhagashah yuddh karen
 "if Hindus armies are victorious on Yavanasena, then the soldiers leave the battlefield
 tatpashchaat rajputsainik aapke peeche aayenge, yudhakshetra se dur uchitasthaan par pahunchakar yavansainik hindoosena ke upar akraman kar deven
 Somehow all Hindusanis have to be destroyed "this was also Ghori's order
 yavansena ghori ke aadesh anusaar brahmamuhuut se armbh kar madhyahn paryant yuddh karti rahi, parantu hindoosena kii paraajay kii sambhaavna bhi nahin dikh rahi thi
 In the afternoon, Ghori felt that, in a war with the Hindusena, he still had no victory, he ordered the reserve army to attack
 12,000 arakshit yavansainikon ne aakasmik reeti se hindoosena ke upar akraman kar diya
 That attack was very frightening
 us akraman main anek hindoosainik hutatma ho gayi
 Prior to the war, Prithviraj's army was divided into several divisions as a result of the conspiracy of treason by the border states by attacking Sapalaksha Empire from all four
 tatpashchaat yuddh ke din brahmamuhoort main ghori kii sena kaa aniatik reeti se prithviraj kii yuddh shibir par akraman se anek hindoosainik hutatma ho gaye
 Not only did many royal families of India plot against Prithviraj, but many officials of Prithviraj's army had also joined the conspiracy of Yavan army
 prithviraj ke sameepvarti ke vishwasghaat se hi prithviraj bandi bhi hue
 The above statement is also supported by the authors Hassan Nizami, Isami, Naychandsoori etc
 inaki pustako main yuddh ke virnan vistaar se praapt hote hai
 While the war was at its zenith and Govind Rai was victorious over the Turkasena with the influence of his elephantine, Prithiviraj was leading the Hindusena and Ghori Yavasena's central divisions
 usee samay kharmel ne apane dhanurdhar sainiko ko aadesh diya ki, "hindoosena ke hathion par akraman karen"
 Then the Yavan soldiers attacked the elephants of Hindusena with full force
 banvarsha se aahat hathi bhaybheet hokar itastatah palaayan karne lage
 In that infestation, by the order of Kharmel, the sound was made by the Yvansayas running behind the elephants, and the sound was made from them
 hindoosena main astavyastata kii sthiti main do ghatnaayen ho gai
 First of all, the elephant on which Prithviraj was meditating, he became uncontrolled after being hurt by arrows
 atah prithviraj aahat hathi se neeche utre or apane vishwast ko ashv laane kii ajna di
 Secondly, Ghori ordered his troops to attack from the left and the south, seeing the disastrous situation in the Hindu army and also ordered 12,000 reserve soldiers to attack
 He himself came forward with the Central Army
 aahat hathi se neeche utarkar prithviraj jis ashv par arurh bue, vah ashv naatyashaala kaa ashv tha
 The conspiracy of traitors with Ghori was often successful in the battlefield
 jab prithviraj ashv par arurh hue, tab duusare hi kshan ghori ke sainikon ne bheri ko bajaanaa armbh kar diya
 Hearing Bheri's music, Prithviraj's horse started dancing
 ashv kii sthiti dekhakar prithviraj jaan gayi ki, kya hua he ? or kya hoga ?
 He soon descended from that horse and started a war with Hindu substances
 usee samay peeche se kisi turksainik ne prithviraj kii greeva par aghat kiya
 After this, the Turksmen combined and attacked Prithviraj and made Prithviraj a prisoner
 1192 varsh ke march-maas kii pratham dinank ko aakasmik akraman, bubhuksha, pipaasa or shadyantron se thake hindoosainik yuddh main parajeet ho gayi
 On that day, the numerous Veerasanikas of 36 dynasties gave their lives to protect their motherland
 anek balak anaath or anek striyaan vidhwaa ho gai
 With the fall of the Sapadalaksha kingdom, King Jayachand of Kannauj region celebrated the festival by lighting a lamp of Ghrit
 narin ke yuddh main vijay praapt kar ghori prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru -prasaad pahucha
 It was only after the entry of the city that the Turksmen started the city

 The wealth and valuable things of the people were forcefully abducted by the paramilitary

 In the city, there were recitations of women, boys, old men and men

 Many scholars of Prithviraj Raso poetry are not composed by Chandbaradhi, many scholars have proved this
 gazani pradesh main ek baan se prithviraj ne ghori kaa vadh kiya iskaa prithviraj raso kavy main varnan he
 Against which there are differences among many historians
 ghori ke vadh ke pashchaat chand or prithviraj ne paraspar ghaat karke mrityu kaa varan kar liya is ullekh ke saath hi varnan miltaa he ki, ye soochna chand dwaara ullikhit he
 How can a person even describe his death? This is the first question that arises
 tatpashchaat shilaalekh ityadi ke vishleshan se anek pramaan praapt hote hai
 With which it is not composed by Rachna Chand, but it seems that some other unknown poet has objected to it

 The arrow run by Prithviraj would have given distinction to Ghori, but before that, the traitors helped Ghori and Ghori died
 prithviraj kaa antimkaal kaisaa tha? iske vishay main bhartiya sahitya main paryaapt pramaan uplabdh hai
 There is also a difference of each Indian source in the presentation of the evidence, but the Persian texts are also the same
 jin madhyakaalin sahitya main prithviraj ke mrityu kaa ullekh praapt hota he, un main prithviraj raso kavyan, puratanprabandhsangrahah, viruddhavidhividhwansah, surjacharitamahakavyan, rajdarshini, kanhdade-prabandhah, prabandhchintamanih or hammirmahakavyan antarbhoot hote hai
 In Persian literature, texts such as Tajul Masir, Jawami ul Hikayata or Rivayat, Tabakate Nasiri, Futuhussalatin, Datee Farishta, Guldashne Ibrahimi and ain-akbari are prominent

 Chandbaradayi was absent in that war, because he himself went to Jammu to make a treaty with a feudal named Hahuli Hammir by order of Prithviraj
 vahaan hammir naamak samant ne chandabaradaayi ke paraamarsh ko asweekaar kar diya or chandabaradaayi ko hi jalpa-devi ke mandir main bindi bana liya
 After the end of the war, Chand was liberated
 prithviraj parajeet hue hai or wein ghori ke bandi hai ye samachar chand ko mili
 Therefore, he went to Ghazni region for the salvation of his emperor
 vahaan apane vaak chaaturya se chand ne ghori ko prabhavit kiya
 After that Ghori told him that, despite being blind, Prithviraj is able to skillfully hit the target
 is prakaar ghori ko wo chamatkaar dekhne ke liye prerit kiya
 Chand then describes how Prithviraj killed Ghori with a single arrow
 ghori ke maran ke pashchaat prithviraj or chand ne aatmghaat kar liya
 According to Chand, he and Prithviraj died in the Ghazni region
 ukt kathanak prithviraj raso kavy ke laghutam, madhyam, or brihat tino roopaantaron main uplabdh hota he
 1290 Vikram Samvatsar Varte, the creation period of the ancient management
 lipikaal i
 1428 – 1471 mana jaataa he
 It is mentioned in the "prithvirajaprabandha" of the Puraniprabandha sangraha that, by placing the weight in the king's cervix, Ghori made Prithviraj a prisoner from the hierarchy of Suvarna
 tatpashchaat vah prithviraj ko yoginipur le gaya
 At the Delhi palace, Ghori asked Prithviraj, "O Rajan! If i give you life, what will you do?"
 prithviraj ne pratiprashn kiya ki, "maine tuje saat baar jeevandaan diya, kya tum mujhe ekbar bhi chhodoge?"
 Whose neonatal tumors were removed, they felt sorry in front of Prithviraj Ghori
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ke pradhan ne puchha, dev! kya karnaa chaiye? niyati dwaara nirdhaarit ye sankat samudbhoot hua he
 Prithviraj said, "if you give me a bow, i can kill it"
 pradhan ne puchha, maharaj! evamev karotu
 After that the Pradhan went near Ghori and said, do not sit at this place
 atah ghori ne apane sthaan par louh kaa puttal prasthaapit karvaa diya or pashchaat us pradhan ne prithviraj ko dhanushkand diya
 Prithviraj, by the blow of his arrow, made two parts of Lohputal
 phir unhone dhanushkand kaa tyaag kar diya
 But on hearing the sound of iron they understood that, they have failed
 atah unhone man main hi sochaa ki, meraa kaary to apurna hi rah gaya, atah anya koi mujhe maar hi daalega
 After that Ghori threw Prithviraj in a mahagarta and he ordered Prithviraj to kill him with stones
 yadi inkaa rakt bhoomi par padegaa, to shubh hi hoga aisa wo baar baar logta rahaa
 In 1246 Vikram Samvatsar, the Yavanas killed the stones and took the life of Prithviraj
 banvedh kaa prasang yahan bhi praapt hota he parantu varnan kinchit bhinn he
 Here Ghori's place receives details of his piercing piercing
 yahan sthaan gazani pradesh nahin, api tu dehali he
 Prithviraj Raso is mentioned in the poem that, Prithviraj committed suicide, but according to Jainacharya, Prithviraj died due to the injuries of the stones in a pit here
 is kathanak main keval prithviraj kii mrityu kaa ullekh he
 There is no description of Chandbaradiyi and Ghori's death
 chandrasekharakrut surjancharitamahakavy kii rachana 1692 vikram sanvatsar maani jaati he
 From the 120th verse of the Dasarasarga of the Surjancharitamahakavya to the 168th verse, there is a narration that Prithviraj, the interim of Digvijay campaign, made Ghori a prisoner
 ikkis baar prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi banaaya or phir chhod diya, parantu usne prithviraj kaa apkaar hi kiya
 In a battle, Ghori took Prithviraj as a prisoner and took him to Ghazni region
 vahaan usne prithviraj ko netraheen kar diya
 After that Prithviraj's friend also reached Gajni state
 usne prithviraj ko pratishodh ke liye prerit kiya
 Prithviraj said, i have no army and no eyes
 aise main pratishodh kaise sambhav he?
 Then Chandbaradiyi reminded Prithviraj of rhetoric and Prithviraj was adorned for vengeance
 prithviraj ke saath shabdavedhvidya kii yojana karke chandabaradaayi ghori kii sabha main gaya
 In a few days, Chandbardayi became a confidant of Ghori and his ministers
 tatpashchaat ek din chandabaradaayi ne sabha main kaha, prithviraj andh hokar bhi lohe kii shrinkhalaon ko bhedane main samarth hai
 His skills should be shown one time only
 chandabaradaayi ne kehane par ghori prithviraj ke kaushal dekhne ke liye tatpar ho gaya
 After that, in Rajprasad, Yavanasanikas tied a suvarnasrikhla on a pillar and gave archery in the hands of Prithviraj
 chandabaradaayi ne ghori ko kaha ki, tum swayan teen baar prithviraj ko baan chalaane ke liye ajna do, uske pashchaat hi wein banvedh karegein
 In this way, Prithviraj fired the arrow after the word came out from the mouth
 vah baan ghori ke talumul bhed diya
 So Ghori died instantly
 ghori kii hatya se rajaprasaad main kautuhal kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 So Chandbaradiyi mounted Prithviraj on horse and took him to Jalandhar
 vahaan vah prithviraj ne apane yash ke anusaar rajya karke paralok gayi
 The story of Surajnacharitamahakavya bears commonality with Prithviraj Raso Kavya in many parts
 vahaan se bhed he ki, yahan prithviraj chandabaradaayi ke saath gazani pradesh se nikalne main safal ho jate hai
 After that, they rule in Jangl Pradesh and go to the other world
 surjancharitamahakavyakaar prithviraj raso kavy se purnataya asamarthan bhi nahin karte or virodh bhi nahin karte
 Thus in the Surjancharitamahakavya, only the description of Ghori's murder is found
 1361 vikram sanvatsar ke baishakhmas kii poornima tithi par prabandhchintaman kii rachana hui
 The author of this book is Merutung
 prabandhchintamani main ullikhit he ki, mlechhraj ke putr ne apane pita ke apmaan kaa vairoddhar ke liye sapadalaksh samrajya ke shaasha prithviraj par akraman kar diya
 Ghori attacked Prithviraj's kingdom with full vigor
 parantu prithviraj kii sena ke dhanurdharaveeron kii banvarsha se bhaybheet hokar ghori apane sainya ke saath bhaag gaya
 Prithviraj followed Ghori
 maarg main bhojan vibhaag ke kisi adhikari ne prithviraj ko kaha, he rajan! kripaya saatso oot daan main deven
 Hearing his word, Prithviraj replied that, first of all i will kill Mlechraj and subdue his camels, then you will have a wish
 tab raja aage prayaag karne ke liye udyat hue, to someshwar naamak kisi pradhan ne prithviraj ko baar baar mlechhraj ke peeche na jane ke liye kaha
 Enraged by the words of Someshwar, Prithviraj cut off his ear
 prithviraj se parabhoot hua someshwar mlechhraj ke paksh main sakriy ho gaya
 Someshwar plans with Ghori for a long time and trusts him
 vah ghori ko vishwaas detaa rahaa ki, prithviraj ke sammukh uski hi vijay hogi
 Ghori then attacked Prithviraj's army on Ekadashi date
 mlechhraj kii sena ne jab sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar akraman kiya, tab parna ke pashchaat prithviraj ghadhanidra main the
 Ghori's soldiers attacked him and made him a prisoner
 ghori dwaara bandi banaaye gayi prithviraj ne ekamaas tak bandi ke rup main ajmeru-prasaad main nivas kiya
 When Prithviraj was worshiped on Ekadashi date after one month, then Mlechharaj sent him to eat pakwamans
 bhojan ke samay hone par bhi prithviraj poojamagn the, atah unka dhyaan maance par nahin gaya
 But after a long time, a Kukkur entered the Shibir of Prithviraj
 us kukkur ne us maance ko kha liya
 Seeing Kukkur carrying meat, the Pratihari of Shibir asked Prithviraj, why didn't you protect the food? prithviraj ne pratyuttar diya ki, jiske bhojan kaa bhaar saatso oot bhi dhone main asamarth hua karte the, uske bhojan kii aisi sthiti he
 i am watching all this in a friendly way
 tatpashchaat ek pratihaari ne krodh se prithviraj ko puchha, kya abhi bhi itani shakti avshisht he? usko uttar dete hua prithviraj ne kaha, yadi main apane sthaan par pahunch jaaon, to main apana sharirak bal bataaun
 Pratihari's discussion with Prithviraj, Ghori also got news of that discussion
 krodhavisht ho kar vah prithviraj ko ajayameru -prasaad main le gaya
 He ordered Prithviraj to sit on the throne of Prasad
 tatpashchaat singhaasana ke chaaron or sthit chitron ko dekhakar ghori ko peeda hui
 Prithviraj around the throne had installed pictures of pigs beating the mulchos
 phir krodhavesh main ghori ne parashu se rajsinghaas par sthit prithviraj kaa shirishchhedan kar diya
 The description of the deity of Prithviraj is found in this epic poem
 prithviraj ne ajayameru prasaad main hi dehtyag kiya ye varnan miltaa he
 The creation period of Vividhatirthakalpradeep is believed to be AD 1307-1332
 vividhtirthakalpapradip naamar granth prakritbhasha main likhaa gaya he
 The description of that book is found in the twenty-second cycle called Mahayanavirpratimakalpa, arthath, 1248 vikram sanvatsar main jab chouhankul ke divakar shreeprithviraj kii ghori dwaara hatya kii gai, tab ajmeru-prasaad par turkon kaa aadhipaty ho gaya
 Therefore, Mahashresthiramdev, the minister of Ajayameru, issued information that, "before the destruction of the idols of Yavan Jansingh, install all the Jainacharya idols in Valasthan in the land"
 is prakaar is granth main prithviraj ke dehtyag kaa sthaan ajmeru hi varnit hua he
 The doer of Hammiramahkavya was Naychand Suri
 hammirkavy kaa rachanakaal 1460 vikram sanvatsar mana jaataa he
 The description of the last period of Prithviraj is obtained from the 53rd verse to the 72nd verse in the third verse of Hammirkavya
 vahaan ullikhit he ki, Recalling all the wars Ghori had fought with Prithviraj earlier, Ghor looked at Prithviraj and thought, "just as lions are invincible with antelope, so are they invincible to us"
 atah ratrikaal main ghori ne apane vishwaston ko prithviraj kii ashwashaala main bheja
 Who gave unlimited suvarnamudra to the Ashwadhipati and to the Turwadvak as Utkoch
 ratri ke antimprahar main hi yavansainikon ne prithviraj ke sainikon par akraman kar diya
 With several provocative declarations, the civilians attacked the Hindus
 sangram kii sthiti dekhakar bharateshwar prithviraj ashwapaalak dwaara preshit naatyashaala ke ashv par arurh ho gayi
 Seeing Prithviraj ascended at that time, the Turwadvik started playing the songs with the sound of instruments like Panavanak and Gomukh
 sangit sunakar natyashaala kaa ashv nrity karne laga
 After that, Prithviraj started the war with the Yavanasanis after getting out of the horse
 apane praharon or garjana se prithviraj ke shatruon ke hriday main bhay utpann ho gaya
 Prithviraj was surrounded by the soldiers from all around, like the snake has birds around it
 prithviraj ne anek yavansainikon ke saath yuddh armbh kar diya
 At that time a paramilitary threw a cord from Prithviraj's cervix
 tatpashchaat sabhi sainikon ne milakar prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 In the end Prithviraj was held captive by the soldiers after prolonged struggle
 bandi hone ke pashchaat prithviraj kii apane jivan or bhojan main ruchi hi lupt ho gai
 Someone pleaded to the maledictions that "bharteshwar Prithviraj had left you many times, wouldn't you leave him even once?"
 us vyakti kaa vachan sunakar kuddh ghori bolaa, "isiliye ye hindu rajnatik rahasyon se hin bole jate hai"
 After that Ghori sent Prithviraj to the prison of another fort
 croor yawanon ne prithviraj ko karagaar main hi andh kar diya
 Thereafter, Shivmatanuayi, who is called Shiva, Buddhamatanuayi, who is called Sugat, Jainmatanuayi, who is known as Omniscience, went to Bharatheshwar Prithviraj Shivdham remembering the nature of that wonderful Chinmaya Brahman
 viruddhavidhividhvanskavy ke rachayita lakshmidhar hai
 This poem was composed on the auspicious date of Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar in 1582
 viruddhavidhividhwans ke rachayita lakshmidhar ke pitamah vaaman the
 When Someshwar was coming from Anhilpatan region towards Ajayameru family, he was accompanied by the Nagarabrahmans like Camas, Bhuvanacamall, Sodh etc

 Skanda and Vamana
 skanda or vaaman prithviraj ke mantrimandal ke sadsy the
 Skanda was the general and Vamana was the conspirator
 viruddhavidhividhwans main vaaman ke prutra lakshmidhar ne likhaa he ki, jab ghori kaa prithviraj ke saath pratham narin kaa yuddh hua, tab skanda ne asaadhaaran pradarshan kiya
 When Prithviraj was defeated in the Second World War, the Indus monarch Vamana stole 2,002,000 dhamma-mudras from the treasury of Ajmeru and fled
 aage viruddhavidhividhvanskavy main lakshmidhar ne likhaa ki, Vypaditasturushkai: sah king jivamritto yudhi 17॥ arthath, senapati skanda anyatra yuddh karne ke liye gayi the
 At that time, the king whose intellect was blocked by sleepless addictions, while still alive, was killed by the deceased King Turkushakas
 'kanhad de prabandh' kavy ke rachayita padmanabh hai
 This poem was presented in 1455 AD
 padmanabh visalnagar-sampradaay ke brahman the
 This Padmanabha was the royalty of Akhairaj, the fifth descendant of Kanhaddev, the ruler of Jalore state
 akhairaj ke aadesh se hi usne "kanhad de prabandh" naamak kavy kii rachaana kii thi
 The language of this poem is 'gurjarajasthani'
 1368 vikram sanvatsar main jalaur pradesh ke shaasha 'kanhad de chouhan' kii dehali ke raja allaudin khalji ke saath jo yuddh hua tha, vah itihaas ke mahatvapurn or prasiddh yudhon main gina jaataa he
 Although 'kanhad de Chauhan' knew that the Yavanas had invaded Jalaurdurg from all four sides and there was no way of victory, yet 'kanhad de Chauhan' with his son Veeramdev came out of the fort to protect the Kulparampara
 Made war
 jalauradurg se baahar hi un donon pita-putr kii mrityu ho gai
 The reason for Alauddin Khalji's war with Kanhad de Chauhan is found in the book titled "kanhad de Prabandha"
 padmanabh "kanhad de prabandh" naamak apane kavy main ullikhat karte hai ki, allaudin khalji kii putree sitai viramdev ko prem karti thi
 She wanted to marry Veeramdev itself
 parantu vijaateey stri ke saath vivaah viramdev ke liye ayogy tha
 Because he thought that, thus marrying an alien would offend the ancestors
 yadhyapi firoja jaanati thi ki, viramdev kyon barambar uske pranaynivedan asweekaar kar rahe he, tathaapi firoza ne anekbar viramdev ko patr likhen
 Feroza's statement was that, i was a rajini named Padmavati of Prithviraj in my previous birth
 atah ham donon kaa pranay na keval is janm kaa he, api tu anek janm se he
 So please do not reject my request
 viramdev ko firoza ne jo kaha, wo nimna he

 Through the above verses, the princess is saying that, i accepted many births to get you
 mere chhaaanwein janm main main palhan-vanshiyon kii putree ke rup main janmi thi
 In that birth you were Prithviraj, the son of Someswara
 us janm main maine ghorpaap kiya tha
 To control you as Prithviraj, i killed cow
 us gau ke garbhashay ko nikaal kar us garbhashay par apni tantrik vidhi kii thi
 Prithviraj was subjugated to me by that tantric method, but he was alienated from the royalty
 uske pashchaat ghori naamak mlechharaja ne jab prithviraj kii ghaggharandi ke tir par vadh kar diya, tab apane satidharm kaa avlamban karte hue maine bhi ayodhya main apane deh tyaag diya
 The book 'jawami ul Hikayat' was written by Maulana Nasruddin Muhammad Ufi
 i
 1211 us granth kaa rachanakaal mana jaataa he
 He mentions that when the two armies reached the ranges, shibir kaka was constructed by the soldiers of both the camps
 parantu ghori ne apane sainikon ko pehle hi aadesh diya tha ki, anek kashtha ekatrit kar lewein
 Because his plan was that before Shibir, we would confuse the enemies by keeping the fire burning
 ham raatri ko hi anya maarg se shatruon ke shibir ke prishthbhag main pahunch jaayenge
 After that, we will attack at Brahmamuhurta itself
 ghori kii yojana safala hui, shibir main sthit swalp sainik puri raat shibir ke sammukh agni prajwalit kar baithe rahen
 Due to which Prithviraj's soldiers thought that, Turaksena is in the front shibir
 ghori apane sainikon ke saath puri raatri yatra karke 'cola' kii shibir ke prishthbhag main pahunchaa
 Ghori then suddenly attacked Prithviraj's army
 yavansainikon ne us akraman main anek hindoosainikon kaa vadh kiya
 Seeing the slaughter of many soldiers from a sudden attack, 'kola' thought that, go back
 parantu tatpashchaat uski sena ke hathi aniyantrit ho gayi or sena main utpaat kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 Ghori then imprisoned Kola
 'taj ul masir' granth kaa lekhak sadruddin bin hasan nijaami naishapuri tha
 According to Yavan Panchang, the composition of this book It took place between 603-614
 hasan nijaami ekmaatr vaideshik lekhak he, jisane narinyuddh kaa vivaran diya he
 In that book, a description of the difference of the first Narayan war is found
 jab ghori ne apni paraajay kaa pratishodh lene ke liye ahoratr parishram kiya
 Then there was war and in the end 'islam' was conquered
 ekalakh se adhik hindooon kaa vadh kiya gaya
 Ajayameru Rai was made a prisoner, but then he was freed
 ajayameru raay mukt to hue, parantu uske hriday main yawanon ke liye dwesh tha hi
 So he started planning
 jab ghori ko uske aacharan ke vishay main jyata hua, tab usne ajayameru raaj ke vadh kaa aadesh de diya
 Thereafter, Ajayameru Rai was crowned with a sword studded with pearls
 ghori ke aadesh se ajayameru raay kaa shir unke putr ko bhijwaya gaya
 The author of the book 'tabakate Nasiri' was Abu Umar Minhajuddin Usman bin siraj-ud-din Muhammad Mujjjani
 us granth kaa rachanakaal i
 1259-60 mana jaataa he
 Minhaj has written describing the war that, although there was a vast army of Hindus, he was defeated by Yavasena
 'allah' ne yavansena par upkaar kiya, jisase hindooon kii sena parajeet hui
 Raipithaura was first fighting the war by sitting on an elephant, after that he climbed on the horse and ran to the Sarsi region
 parantu vahaan vah yavansainikon dwaara bandi bana liya gaya
 Then he was sent to hell
 dehali ke govindaray ko bhi bandi banya gaya or uskaa shirishchhedan karke ghori ke sammukh uskaa shir prastut kiya gaya
 Ghori, seeing two fragmentary teeth of that head, knew that it was Govandarai
 ghori ne sapadalakshasamrajya kii rajdhani ko chhodkar haansi, sarsi, digar ityadi pradeshon par apana aadhipaty prasthaapit kar diya
 In 588 years, the fame of the Yavans increased and Ghori Aibak went to Gajni state by giving him royalty
 qutubuddin abak ne bhi meerut ityadi sthanon par akraman karke apane aadhipaty kaa vistaar kiya
 Abdur Rahman Chishti was the author of the book 'meerate Masoodi'
 prithviraj 'abu jalah' ho gaya
 Ghori repeatedly asked Prithviraj to accept 'bait'
 parantu prithviraj ne yab 'bait' kaa angikaar nahin kiya, tab ghori ne uski hatya kar di
 
 'phutuhussalatin' granth kaa lekhak isami tha
 Pithorarai was imprisoned, after which he was presented before Ghori
 ghori ne uske shirishchhedan kaa aadesh diya
 Only such a description is found in the Futuhstalin Granth
 parantu usamen 'karvaa' naamak kavachan kaa varnan or ghori ke senapation ke naam bhi praapt hote hai
 The author of the Tarikh Farishta book was Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah Farishta
 farista iran-deshiy tha
 His ancestors were Hindus
 uske purvaj panjaab pradesh or afghanisthaan pradesh ke simavarti pradeshon ke 'hindu shahiya' vansh ke the
 When was the religion of Islam declared by the ancestors of the angel? It is not received
 parantu i
 1582 varsh main farista apane pita ke saath maharashtrarajya ke ahmadanar ke nizaam shahi sultan murtaja nizaam shah ke rajbhavan main gaya tha
 He was then twelve years old
 vahaan farista ke pita shikshak ke rup main niyukt hue the
 Angel also became a part of the army
 uske pashchaat padonnati hote hi vah rakshakadal kaa adhyaksh ban gaya
 Farishta was the Yavana of the panth named ‘shia’
 uske ahamed-nagar main adhik mitra nahin the
 So he left Ahmed-nagar and went to Bijapur for a livelihood
 bijapur main nivas karte hue ibrahim shah-dwitiyity ke aadesh se tavaarikh naamak granth kii rachana kii
 In the year 1606, that book was completely completed
 narin yuddh kaa varnan jis granth me praapt hota he, us granth kaa naam 'gulshane-ibrahimi' he
 That book is famous by the name of 'date Farishta'
 us granth main ullekh he ki, pithorarai kinchit dur gaya tha, tabhi turkasainikon ne use bandi bana liya
 Then Ghori killed him
 aaine akabari granth main ullikhit he ki, ant main raja yuddh main bandi hua
 After that Ghori took them and went to Ghazni region
 chandrabaradaayi bhi apane swamibhakti kaa nirvaah karne ke liye vahaan pahunchaa
 Chandbaradayi trusted Ghori and appointed him in his service
 chandabaradaayi ne prayatnon se prithviraj ke kargaar ke vishay main jaan liya or prithviraj ke saath mantranaa karke usne prithviraj ko santvana di
 Chandbarai said to Prithviraj, "I will praise your archery in front of Ghori and decorate her to see your skill
" us samay aap avasraanusaar use maar deven"
 Prithviraj was adorned to demonstrate archery skills while supporting Chandbaradayi's plan
 phir unhone ek baan se hi ghori kaa vadh kar diya
 Seeing Ghori's murder, his soldiers attacked Chandbaradiyi and Prithviraj
 ant main un donon kii hatya kar di
 In the Indian source, as the description of all the authors is different, so is the description of the writers of Persian language
 farsigranthon main anek lekhakon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj kii mrityu rankshetra main hui thi
 Whatever description has been introduced by Indian writers and by Persian writers in their texts, that description was comparatively studied and those statements were divided into three parts
 prayek lekhak narinyuddh kii, prithviraj kii mrityu kii or ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main bhinn bhinn vivaran dete hai
 Indian writers and Persian writers are divided into three divisions according to their description
 narinyuddh ke vivaran main jo bhartiyalekhakon or farsilekhakon ne vibhinn varnan kiye, un varnanon ko teen vibhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 One of the sections describing the Narayan war is that Prithviraj was in captivity in the Ghazni region
 phir unke mitra chandabaradaayi vahaan pahunche
 Ghori died due to the combined efforts of both of them
 phir un donon ne aatmghaat kar liya
 This is the story of Prithviraj Raso poetry
 'aaine akabari' kaa varnan prithviraj raso kavy ke anugun hi he, parantu us kavy me lekhak ne sthiti kaa koi varnan nahin kiya he
 a similar description of Prithviraj Raso poetry is found in the Surjancharitamahakaavya
 parantu vahaan rasokavy se adhik pruthakta dikhti he
 According to Surjancharit, after the slaughter of Ghori, Chand and Prithviraj succeeded in migrating safely from the Ghazni region
 phir sapadalakshrajya main hi un donon kii mrityu hui
 There is a section which says that Prithviraj died in the Rangana during the Narayan war
 us varg main pramukhatya farsibhasha ke granth 'tabakaate nasiri', 'phutuhussalatin' or 'gulshane ibrahimi' hai
 The Indian source has only two texts
 viruddhavidhividhwansah or 'kanhad de prabandh'
 In Narayan's war, Prithviraj was captured and Ghori took him to the throne of Ajayameru, then Prithviraj planned against Ghori, who became aware of Ghori
 us samay ghori ne prithviraj ke vadh kaa aadesh diya ye varnan jin granthon main miltaa he, ve is varg main antarbhoot hote hai
 Such descriptions are found in Persian texts like 'tajul Masir', 'jameul Hikayat', 'meerate Masudi' and 'tawarikh of Jammu'
 bhartiyagranthon main puratanprabandhsangrahah, prabandhchintamanih in donon granthon kaa aashay bhi yahi he, parantu jainamtanuai nayanchandsuri ke varnan anusaar ajayameru ke karagaar main anshan se prithviraj ne pranatyag diye
 The attribution of various texts does not prove that, whose death ?, where ?, how? And when? Had happened
 parantu pramaanon ke aadhaar par hi siddh ho saktaa he ki, kiski mrityu ?, kahan ?, kaise ? or kab ? tab hui thi
 Therefore, the evidence of Ghori and Prithviraj's death was analyzed in sequence
 ghori kii mrityu gazani pradesh main prithviraj ke haathon nahin hui thi, api tu prithviraj kii mrityu ke pashchaat chaudaa varsh ghori kii upasthiti ke pramaan praapt hote hai
 Ghori died by Hindus
 ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main anek pramaan praapt hote hai
 The author of the book 'tajul Masir' was Hasan Nizami
 vah apane granth main ullikhit karata he ki, khokhron kaa daman karke ghori varshon bharat main rahakar gazani pradesh waapas ja rahaa tha
 When he reached near Dhamek region, he made shibir in the garden there with flowers like kumud and jasmine
 jab ghori sandhyakalin prarthana main rat tha, tab kuch log vahaan aa pahunche
 He killed Ghori by killing the guards and the workmen
 'tarikhe jahankush' granth kaa lekhak allaudin juvaini tha
 The composition of this book 655 is considered
 minhaj ke 'tabakaate nasiri' granth se teen varsh purv hi allaudin juvaini ke 'tarikhe jahankush' granth kii rachana hui thi
 Describing Ghori's death, Alauddin Juwaini wrote that, "ghori invaded India several times in 602 AD by destroying the Khorasan-province
 vah anek yudhon main vijayi hokar apane sainya ko dhansampann karte ja rahaa tha
 When he was on his way to the Ghazni region by taking Jhemal Pradesh, he put Shibir on the banks of the river 'jihu'
 us shibir main jab ghori madhyahn kaal main nidradhin tha, tab kuch hindooon ne nadi ko langhakar shibir par akraman kar diya
 They murdered Ghori after causing uproar in Shibir
 'tarikhe farista' pustak kaa doosraa naam 'gulshane-ibrahimi' he
 a historian named Briggs translated the book 'tarikhe Farishta'
 vah apane pustak main likhata he ki, '2 Shaban, H
I
 On 602 ', Ghori reached Rohtak village on the arrow of Sindhanadi
 vahaan 20 'gakkhad' logon kaa ek samooh ghori kii hatya ke uddesh se aa pahunchaa
 The relatives of those Hindus were killed by Ghori in the war
 atah ve pratishodh ke liye bahut samay se ghori kii hatya karne ke liye avasar kii pratiksha main the
 It was a sultry atmosphere that day
 atah ghori ke aadesh anusaar sainikon dwaara shibir ke aavaran khule rakkhe the, jis se shibir main vayupravah nirbaadh rahe
 Then when the cover was uncovered by the servants of Ghori, the Hindus knew that opportunity
 phir hindu samooh raatri main hi sena ke sameep main kisi sthaan par chup kar baith gaya
 After that, when one of them reached near Shibir's gate at night, Shibir's gatekeeper stopped him
 us hindu ne chhurika ke praharon se us dwarpal kii hatya kar di
 Chikkar swallowed the mouth of the gatekeeper due to the hard stroke of the blade at the chest
 wo chitkaar sunakak anya sainik bhi shibir ke sameep upasthit ho gayi
 But before that, Hindus entered inside Shibir and killed Ghori
 jab hindooon ne ghori ke shabir main pravesh kiya, tab ghori nidradhin tha
 There were also two servants near Ghori
 parantu hindooon ke haath main shastr dekhakar wein murtiwat baithe rahe
 The Hindus then killed Nidramagn Ghori
 ghori ke sharir par anek vran the
 More than twelve times Hindus attacked Churika
 sabhi aghat ghori ke sharir par pratyaksh dekhe ja sakate the
 Unlike the above mentioned English translation, the original mention is written in the Urdu text
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, itihaas kii ghatana main bhram utpaann karne ke liye athwa bhramavash ashuddh anuwaad hua
 This is what is described in the original version of the book titled 'tarikhe Farishta'
 '2 shaabaan, hi

 Shibir Ghori built Shibir there
 phir duusare din ghori kii hatya hui
 a group of 20 'gakkhad' people arrived there with the intention of killing Ghori
 kyonki un hindooon ke sambandhion kii ghori ne hatya karvaa di thi or unako grihaviheen kar diye the
 So they were waiting for the opportunity of killing Ghori for a long time, wishing for vengeance
 ghori yahan shibir banaakar rah rahaa tha, vahaan kisi prakaar wo samooh pahunch gaya
 At that time the soldiers were eager to go further
 ek sevak aavarnon ko nikaal kar ekatrit kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, he entered Hindu Shibir
 ek hindu ne shibir ke dwarpal par chhurika se akraman karke uski hatya kar di
 Then he ran away from that place
 dwarpal kii aahat avasthaa ko dekhakar anya sainik bhi vahaan upasthit ho gayi
 The servant who was involved in calculating the descent, left the work of Shibir of the servant Ghori and went to the gatekeeper
 usee samay hinduunon ne ghori kii shibir main pravesh kiya
 Two or three servants were sitting near Ghori
 parantu hindooon ke haath main shastr dekhakar ve maun hi rahe
 The Hindus attacked Ghori before they could react
 chhurika ke baaise ati kathor prahaar un hindooon ke dwaara kiye gayi
 Ghori died in the end
 'tabakaate nasiri' pustak kaa rachayita kaaji minhaj tha
 It mentions that while Ghori was doing 'magarbi Namaz', he was killed
 'phutuhussalatin' granth main ullekh praapt hota he ki, jab ghori aaagantukon ke saath goshtimagn tha, tabhi aaagantukon main se ek ne ghori ke upar talwaar se akraman kar diya
 Ghori died of a single stroke of the sword
 ghori ne gazani pradesh main do prakaar kii mudraayen prakashit kii
 Of gold and silver
 us mudra kaa naam 'dirham' tha
 Many Ghori currencies have been received by historians
 keval maishan, princep cabinet sthaan main sangruhit mudraon kaa hi ullekh adhik miltaa he
 The description of the following currencies was proposed by the eminent numerologist Edward Thomas in 1871 in London-city
 sankhya 1, figure 1, swarnadhaatu, bhaar 93 gren, gazanitankashaala Metal - Silver, Weight 74 grains, Time 569 In this mudra, printing like uttamudra is also obtained
 ukt granthon main ghori kii mrityu ke vishay main vividh vivaran praapt hote hai
 Some say that, Ghori was sleeping in the mid-day, others say that, he was busy in evening worship
 koi kahata he ki, vah sainya yatra ke liye sajjataa kar rahaa tha, koi kahata he ki vah aaagantukon ke saath charchamagn tha
 Everyone has different views about the invaders
 vibhinn lekhakon ke mat kaa saar he ki, hindu, gakkhd, mulahida, fidaiyaan, khokhar, ismaili, karamaata ityadi main se kasi vansh main utpann bees logo ne ghori kii hatya kii thi
 In the narration of the said historian, whose description is true and whose false? This knowledge is obtained only through evidence
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori jaise raja kii hatya 20 logo ke samooh ne kar di is vishay main shanka samudbhav hoti he
 Existing Ghori was killed in the array of millions of soldiers, there was no attention of any soldier on it, this description does not seem logical
 parantu farsi-granthon se praapt pramaanon se ghori kii mrityu kaa samay narin ke yuddh ke pashchaat choubees varshon tak siddh hota he
 After the first date of the month of March of 1192, Ghori ruled over the Ghazni region and the Indian states
 uski mrityu '2 shaabaan hi
sa
 602' yavanatithi par hua tha
 Ghori's death has historically supported many Persian texts, and Ghori's twenty-four-year evidence of Indian domination over Indian states has also been found
 dhili-rajavali main pramaan miltaa he ki, ghori ne 1192+14=1206 i
 paryant bhartiyapradeshon par rajya kiya tha
 Then on the arrow of Sindhundi was killed by Hindus
 prithvirajtrutiy tathaa ghori kii sanyuktamudraayen uplabdh hoti hai
 Historians doubt whether Prithviraj had made a treaty with Ghori in the last period? But in the end it was found that, after the defeat of Prithviraj, Ghori published the joint currency of both of them to get protection from the rebellion of the people
 prithvirajsy tathaa ghori kii sanyuktamudraon kaa prapratham prakaashan edward thoms naamak prakhyat mudrashasthri ne kiya tha
 According to his statement, he did not believe that Prithviraj could have a joint currency with Ghori
 kyonki narainyuddh main prithviraj kii parajaya ke anantar ghori unako ajayameru le gaya tha, phir kuch din karagaar main unako sharirakapida dekar ghori ne unki hatya kar di thi
 Therefore, the suspicious Edward Thomas told General Cunningham the received currencies
 general kaningham ne us mudra ke agrabhag or prishthbhag main vidyaman akshar padhe
 At that time, General Cunningham did not have the same currencies
 parantu edward thoms dwaara di gai mudraon se sanyuktamudraayen uplabdh hui
 General Cunningham and Edward Thomas had the same currencies as Nelsen Wright
 un teenon ke paas yadhyapi prithviraj or ghori kii sanyuktamudraayen thi, tathaapi un mudraon kaa bhaar bhinn tha
 1
 Currencies collected by Edward Thomas: - Bharat - 36 grains, front - Prithviraj, cavalry - Nandi Mahmud
 2
 general kaningham dwaara sangruhit mudra :- vyas 55”, bhaar 55 gren, agrabhag - ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag – nandi mahamad sam 
 3
 Currencies adopted by Nelsen Wright: - Vyas 55 ”, weight 55 grains, horse cavalry Prithviraj, backdrop - Nandi Mahamad Sama ukt sanyuktamudraon kaa adhyayan karke nishkarsh prastut karte hue thoms ne kaha ki, in mudraon kaa prakaashan prithviraj ke putr gownd ne kiya tha
 He published currencies in the name of his father and the then ruler Ghori, in recognition of his power
 general kaningham ke nishkarshanusaar prithviraj kinchit samay paryant ghori ke samant the
 Hence the joint currencies were published
 
 According to the conclusion of Nelsen Wright, after the defeat of Prithviraj, Ghori wanted to establish independence over Ajayameru
 atah usne swayan hi ye mudraayen prakashit kii thi 
 Kunwardevi Singh Mandawa also mentions "ghori did thur mudras prakasik", agreeing with the conclusion of Kalingam and Nelsen
 kunvaradevi kaa tark he ki, ghori ne praja ke manobhaav ko parivartit karne hetu tathaa "prithviraj uske adhinsth raja hai" ye sandesh praja main prasaarit karne sanyuktamudraayen prakashit kii hogi
 His political advantage in it was that, "prithviraj rejected Ghori's rule" This message would not give rise to any rebellion
 ve aage kahati hai ki, jaise praja kii manassthiti kaa laabh praapt karne hetu 'ist india company' dwaara mughal-raja shah alam dwitiya ke naam se mudraayen prasaarit kii gai thi, us se praja main mughal-samrajya ke rajtv main vishwaas akhand hua tha
 The same must have happened then

 Dr
 Dineshchandra said that he was unable to give a proof of the actual conclusion regarding the currency, but he opined that these currencies would not have been officially printed by the state printing presses but by other voluntary organizations
 vividh granthon main kaha gaya he ki, narayan ke yudhakshetra main prithviraj maare gayi
 But on the basis of historical background, war and events, the decision regarding the death of Prithviraj in the battlefield is considered unproven
 ghori ke bharat par akraman ke do mukhya uddash the
 First of all, the wealth of India and the expansion of its religion
 narin ke yuddh main ghori ke vijay se uski pratham ichha to purna hui
 But his second motive for denouncing Prithviraj's 'islam' religion was residual
 atah prithviraj kaa jivan anivaary tha
 Evidence of Ghori's second wish is obtainable in various texts
 tajul-masir naamak pustak main ullekh praapt hota he ki, jab ghori apane sainya ke saath lahore pradesh pahunchaa tha, tab usne kwamulmulk ruknuddin hamja naamak doot ko ajayameru prasaad bheja tha
 Ghori had sent the message that, you wear the ornament of slavery in your ears and attend my Rajya Sabha and declare 'islam' religion
 farista main ullikhit he ki, ghori jab lahore pahunchaa tha, tab apane vishwast doot, jiskaa naam kwamulmulk ruknuddin hamja tha, use ajayameru prasaad main bheja tha
 Sent a message with him that, reject the religion of Islam
 farista main aage ullekh prapya he ki, doot se sandesh sunakar prithviraj ati cruddh hue the
 Therefore, Prithviraj addressed the king following the 'islam' religion with abusive words
 us sandesh ke saath doot ko lautaa diya 
 Therefore, Ghori's objective was the universalization of Prithviraj after the conquest of India
 uske liye prithviraj kaa jivan bhi anivaary tha
 Although Ghori could have killed Prithviraj in the Narayan war zone, he went to Ajayameru with Prithviraj
 kyonki prithviraj ke ismali-karan wo chahta tha
 The main soldier of Ghori was Aibak
 narin yuddh ke pashchaat usne samgr yuddh kaa ghatnakram apane rajsabha ke do sadasyon ko kaha
 The two members were Najami and Ufi

 Prof

 Nizami has written that, Ghori took Prithviraj to Ajayemaru
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ne ghori ke viruddh jab kuchakr kiya, to ghori ne samachar milte hi prithviraj kii hatya kar di
 The description found in the book titled Tajul Masir also supports the Indian source
 hasan nijaami ne bhi kisi durgoshtee kii charchaa kii he, parantu uske vishay main kuch bhi vivaran praapt nahin hota he
 As a result of that conspiracy, Ghori killed Prithviraj, it is mentioned by him
 pro
 es ech hodivaala ne apane pustak main likhaa he ki, jab prithviraj ke paramamitra or sahaayak udayraj ko prithviraj ke karagaravaas ke samachar mili, tab vah aatmaglani se duhkhit ho gaya
 He thought that, if i abandon the owner who is suffering, and flee, then my cow dynasty will be stunned
 atah usne dilli par akraman kiya or dilli ke durg par chaaron ore se akraman kar diya
 At that time, someone in Ghori's assembly said to Ghori, "these Prithviraj left you many times, won't you leave them even once?"
 ghori ne us vachan ko sunakar sakrodh kaha, tere jaise logon ke paraamarsh se rajya nasht ho jaayenga
 Ghori then sent Prithviraj to the fortress of Ajayameru
 pro
 hodivaala ke kathananusaar jis vyakti ne prithviraj kii mukti kaa paraamarsh diya tha, vah prithviraj ke vyakti the
 Due to the threat of evil around him, Ghori took Prithviraj to the kingdom of Ajayameru
 is prakaar ghori narin yuddh ke pashchaat prithviraj ko dilli se ajayameru le gaya or vahaan prithviraj kii hatya kii
 The conspiracy described by Hasan Nizami finds mention in the subject called the Puranabhistabhandrasagraha
 vahaan ullikhit he ki, jab mlechhraj ne prithviraj ko chhoda, tab prithviraj ne pratishodh ke liye yojana banaai
 But his treacherous minister told Ghori the plan
 merutung dwaara rachit prabandhchintamani main varnan praapt hota he ki, ghori chitrashaala main 'muslim' logon ko maarthe hue shukaron ko dekh kar kupit ho gaya
 After that, he surrendered Prithviraj
 parantu us varnan main susangata maani nahin jaati he
 Because Ghori knew that, not only Prithviraj, all the kings of Api Tu Chauhan dynasty hated the Gaubhakshi Muslims
 nijaami ne varnan kiya he ki, ghori prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru gaya or unhen chod diya
 It is also mentioned in the Prabandha Chintaman that Prithviraj ascended the throne of Ajayameru
 jinprabh suri naamak jainacharya ke kathan anusaar ghori ne ajayameru main prithviraj kii hatya kar di thi

 The details of where and when Prithviraj died was found to be different in different texts
 parantu prithviraj kii mrityu ajmeru ke prasaad main hui thi ye vidvan siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 
 ghori kisi bhi prakaar prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm swikaarne ko vivash karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, he was ready to establish a co-ethical relationship with Prithviraj
 parantu prithviraj 'islam' dharm ke asweekaar par drudhsankalp the
 Dr
 Hemachandra Rai writes that, "by seeing the history and self-respect of the Chauhan dynasties, there could not have been a confinement of life or slave life for Prithviraj"
 atah prithviraj ke paas dwo maarg the
 Protection of treaty or self-respect using political pragmatism
 prithviraj ne dwitiya maarg kaa chayan kiya
 After getting a negative response from Prithviraj, Ghori got burnt in anger
 atah vah prithviraj se apana icchit kaary karwaane ko unako sharirak or maansik yatnaa dene laga
 Prithviraj did not succumb to Ghori's deathly suffer
 atah usne kootneeti purvak prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karaane hetu shadyantra rachaa
 Ghori sent traitor minister Pratapsingh who served Ghori for many years near Prithviraj
 pratapsingh kaa uddesh tha ki, kisi bhi prakaar se prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikar karne ke liye sajj karnaa
 Therefore, he kept explaining to Prithviraj for a few days
 prithviraj ne pratapsingh par vishwaas karke use apane man kii vyathaa bataai or banvedh kii yojana bhi bataai
 Banvedh's plan is described as a conspiracy in a book called Nizami
 banvedh kii pushti anek granthon main praapt hoti hi he or aitihaasik ghatnakram bhi uski ore sanket karata he
 On the orders of Ghori, Pratap Singh, the minister of Prithviraj, explained to Prithviraj to reject the 'islam' religion
 "ghori kaa vadh karnaa chahta hoon" aisa prithvirajh ne pratapsingh ko kaha
 Prithviraj further said that, i am capable of running a worded arrow
 meri us vidya kaa main pradarshan karne ke liye sajj hoon
 Any way you look forward to watching Ghori displaying my knowledge
 tatpashchaat rajsabha main shabdavedh baan ke pradarshan ke samay ghori kahan sthit he ye mujhe kahana
 i will take my vengeance by slaughtering Ghori with the word arrow
 parantu pratapsingh ne prithviraj kii sahayata karne ke sthaan par prithviraj kii yojana ke sandarbh main ghori ko suchit kar diya
 When Ghori heard about Prithviraj's plan, his anger also arose with anger
 uski kalpana bhi nahin thi ki, koi bhi andh vyakti dhwani sunakar lakshya bhedan karne main sakasham ho saktaa he
 But when the minister repeatedly said about Prithviraj's mastery, Ghori wanted to see the performance of the worded arrow
 ghori ne apane sthaan par lohe kii yaa paththar kii ek murti sthapit kar di thi
 After this Pratap Singh gave a bow in the hands of Prithviraj in the assembly
 ghori ne jab lakshya bhedane kaa aadesh diya, tab anukshan hi prithviraj ne baan chalaa diya
 With that arrow, that idol has two parts
 deshadroh hone se prithviraj kaa antim praayas bhi api vifal ho gaya
 According to the description of Hasan Nizami, the angry Ghori then ordered Prithviraj to be killed
 uske pashchaat ek muslim sainik ne ratnajdit suvarnayukt ek asi se prithviraj kii hatya kar di
 Thus, Prithviraj's lifeline ended in Ajayamuru

 The National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organization is the premier institution of map-making in India after the Survey of India established on the basis of the British Ordinance Survey

 In 1960, the mapping unit of the French Institute of Pondicherry made a significant impact in the development of geography

 Drawing a map is the simplest means of interviewing a human with his physical conditions
 bhuprishth par sthit prakritik vivaran, jaise pahaad, nadi pathaar, maidan, jangal aadi or saanskrithik nirmaan, jaise sadaken, railmarg, pul, kuen dharmik sthaan, kaarkaane aadi kaa sakshipt, sahi or vishwasaneey chithran nakshe par miltaa he
 This interpretation of the map raises three questions: pehali samasya kaa samaadhaan kaagaj kii ek ikai duuri par prithvi kii kai ikai duuri ko pradarshit karke kiya gaya he, arthath kinhin bhi do vinduon kii bhaumik duuri ko nakshe par ek nishchit anupaat main pradarshit karte hai, jaise nakshe par 1 inch = 1 mile 2 mile, 4 mile yaa 50 mile ityadi, yaa 1 ikai = 1,000, 10,000, 25,000 50,000 ityadi
 It can also be written as a ratio of 1: 1,000, 1: 25,000 etc
 is prakaar kii abhivyakti nakshe kaa paimaana kehalaata he
 The second solution to the problem is by map interpolation, in which latitude and longitude are projected onto the plane to facilitate the use of the map
 prakshep kaa arth samajhane ke liye kalpana karen ki kaach ke ek gole par apaardarshee rang se akshansh tathaa deshaantar rekhaayen khinchi hai
 Surfaces that develop as a tangent plane or plane on a sphere, such as a cone or cylinder, are placed and have a point of light at the center of the sphere, in which case the shadow formed on the tangent surface will be called the projection of latitudes or longitudes
 bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke prakshep, jinamein kisi par kshetrafal, kisi par disha evam duuri or kisi par akritiyaan sahi banati hai, isi prakaar kii ek yaa duusari sataha par taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Among them, radial interpolation on the plane, stereoscopic interpolation, cylinder and Cassini interpolation, Mercator interpolation and multicomp interpolation on the cone are the most commonly used
 survekshit bhoomi ke vistaar or bhu prishth par uski sthiti ke anusaar prakshep kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 The third problem has been solved using symbolic symbols for details

 The size of these icons depends on the scale of the map
 maanchitr ke paimaane jaise-jaise chote hote jate hai vaise-vaise kam mahatv ke vivaran chhod die jate hai or chihn bhi chote hote jate hai, jaise bharat ke bhugolic maanchitr, gaanv, choti nadiyaan, vanaspati aadi nahin dikhaae jate or nagar keval binduon yaa chote vritton se pradarshit kiye jate hai
 One thing is particularly noteworthy about the symbolic symbols is that it is not difficult to show other details with length and width, ie, two extended symbolic symbols, but it is of special importance to introduce hilly and raised land on the map

 This is the first copy of the map
 iske baad litho mudran dwaara vaanchit sankhya main pratiyaan taiyaar kar lee jaati hai
 The main reason for hand-drawing the first copy on the blue print is to remove hand-drawn errors on the panel, or aerial survey section, and make the map beautiful and elegant
 iske liye jo upkaran prayukt hote hai, ve nimnlikhit hai : Pure lines are drawn from the desired scale of the map to the diagonal scale, which is reduced by photography to obtain a map of the desired scale
 isse yah laabh hota he ki uparyukt sahaayak upkarnon dwaara bhi yadi rekhan main kuch trutiyaan aa gai hon to ve laghukaran main itani choti rah jaaen ki aankh ko na khatken

 There is also the practice of buying silver on the day of Dhanteras; When it is not possible, people buy silverware
 iske peeche yah kaaran mana jaataa he ki yah chandramaa kaa pratik he jo sheetaltaa pradaan karata he or man main santosh rupi dhan kaa vaas hota he
 Santosh has been called the greatest wealth
 jiske paas santosh he vah swasth he sukhi he or vahi sabase dhanwaan he
 There is no wealth greater than the wealth of satisfaction for the health and health of Lord Dhanvantari, who is also the god of medicine
 log is din hi deepawali kii raat lakshmi ganesh kii puja hetu murti bhi kharidte hen
 On the evening of Dhanteras, there is also the practice of lighting the lamp at the main gate outside the house and in the courtyard

 Dhanvantari is the physician of the gods and is considered to be the god of medicine, so the day of Dhanteras is very important for physicians
 dhanteras ke sandarbh main ek lok katha prachlit he ki ek baar yamraj ne yamaduton se poocha ki praaniyon ko mrityu kii god main sulaate samay tumhaare man main kabhi dayaa kaa bhav nahin aata kya
 Before the fear of Yamdevata, the messengers said that they perform their duty and obey their command, but when Yamdevata removed the fear of the messengers' mind, they said that once while taking the life of King Hema's celibate son Hearing the lamentation of the newly wedded wife, our heart also got upset but according to the law of law, we could not do anything by wishing
 ek doot ne baton hi baton main tab yamraj se prashn kiya ki akaal mrityu se bachane kaa koi upaay he kya
 Answering this question, Yama Devta said that the person who keeps a lamp in the south direction in the name of Yama on the evening of Dhanteras, does not die prematurely
 is manyata ke anusaar dhanteras kii shaam log aangan main yama devtaa ke naam par deep jalaakar rakhte hai
 On this day people also keep a fast in the name of God Yama

 In 1921, Malaviyaji also agreed to treat the Kinkartyavim Viceroy Lord Reading with self-government in the provinces after he was filled with jail by Congress leaders and volunteers, but the Chauri Chaura scandal of 4 February 1922 overturned history
 gandhiji ne bardauli kii kaaryakarini main bina kisi se paraamarsh kiye satyagrah ko achaanak roak diya
 Due to this, there was discontent among the Congress people and it started to be very shocking that Gandhiji had made this terrible mistake by coming at the behest of his elder brother
 gandhiji swayan bhi paanch saal ke liye jail bhej diye gayi
 As a result, sixty one year old Malaviya kept the national consciousness alive by making a stormy tour from Peshawar to Dibrugarh in the scorching sun
 is bhraman main unhone bahut baar kukhyat dhara 144 kaa ulanghan bhi kiya jise sarkaar khun kaa ghunt samajhakar pi gayi
