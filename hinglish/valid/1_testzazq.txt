 Dream Theater was formed in September 1985 when guitarist John Petrucci, bossist John Myung and drummer Mike Portnoy decided to form a band in their spare time while studying at Berkeley College of Music
 teenon ne, barkale ke purvaabhyas kamare main rash or aayran madan ke geeton ke saath apni shuruyaat kii
 Myung, Petrucci and Portnoy, agreed on the name Majesty for their newly formed group
 According to The Score So Far 


 documentary, they were waiting in the ticket line for the Rush event at the Berkeley Performance Center and listening to the band at a boom box
 portnoy ne tippanee kii ki "bastill de" geet kii samaapti "rajasi" lagi
 So it was decided that the band's name would be Majesty
 iske baad teenon ne, samooh main shesh padon ko bharne ke liye prayaas armbh kiya
 Petrucci asked his high school bandmate Kevin Moore to play the keyboard
 After accepting the position, another domestic friend, Chris Collins, was recruited as the lead singer when band members heard him sing a cover of "queen of the Rise" by Quincenriess
 is samay ke dauraan, portnoy, petruki or myung ke vyast kaaryakramon ne unhen apane sangeet par dhyaan kendrit karne ke liye padhai kaa parityag karne par majaboor kiya, chunki unhen laga ve college main or adhik sikh nahin sakate hai
 Moore also left his college, SUNY Fredonia, to concentrate on the band
 1986 ke shuruuaati maheenon main unhone new yark city kshetra main or aasapaas, vibhinn kaarykram prastut kiye
 During this time, the band recorded a collection of demos, titled The Majesty's Demos
 Its initial 1000 copies sold out within six months, and dubbed copies of the cassette became popular in the progressive metal scene
 megesti demos, aadhikarik taur par CD par jari hone ke baavjood, mike portnoy ke itsijam ricard ke madhyam se aaj bhi apane mul tepe swaroop main uplabdh he
 In November 1986, after a few months of simultaneous writing and performance, Chris Collins was fired
 uske pratisthaapan kii talash main ek varsh kii koshish ke baad, charlie dominiki ne, jo band ke anya sadasyon kii tulana main adhik umrdaraj or anbhavi tha, samooh ke liye safaltaapurvak audishan diya
 With the stability that Dominici's appointment brought to Majesty, they began to increase the number of productions offered in the New York City area, increasing their popularity
 dominiki kii niyukti ke fouran baad, las vegas ke ek samooh ne jiskaa naam megesti hi tha apane naam ke prayog ke liye bauddhik sampada kaanoon ke ulanghan ke tahat kanoonee karrwai kii dhamkee di, isliye band, ek nae upnaam ko apnaane ke liye majaboor hua
 Various possibilities were proposed and tested, among them Glasser, Magus, and M1, all of which were rejected, after Portnoy's father suggested the name Dream Theater, a film house in Monterey, California
 apane nae naam or sthirataa ke saath, dream theatre ne neuyork or anya padosi rajyon main or adhik pradarshan karte hue, adhik saamagree lekhan par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 He eventually caught the attention of Mechanic Records, a section of the MCA
 dream theatre ne maikenic ke saath apane pehle record anubandh par 23 june 1988 ko hastakshar kiya, or apane pratham album ko record karne kii muhim main jute gaye
 The band recorded the album at Kajem Victory Studios in Gladwin, Pennsylvania
 mukhya trek kii recording main 10 dinon kaa samay laga or puraa album kareeb 3 saptaah main puraa kar liya gaya
 When Dream and Day United was released in 1989, but it made fans less happy, contrary to the band's expectations
 maikenic ne, dream theatre dwaara anubandh par hastakshar karne se pehle kiye gaye kai vittiya vaadon ko antat tod diya, isliye band keval neuyork shahar ke aasapaas pradarshan karne ke liye majaboor tha
 The promotional tour for the album included just five concerts, all relatively local
 unka pehla sho, be shor, neuyork main sandance main tha, jab unhone clasik rock shakti zebra ke liye shubharambh kiya
 After the fourth show, Dominici was fired due to personal and creative differences
 iske fouran baad, marillian band ne dream theatre ko neuyork main ritz main ek kaarykram ke liye apane liye shubharambh karne ke liye kaha, isliye dominiki ko ek aakhri baar pradarshan kaa avasar diya gaya
 This was happening two years later when Dream Theater wanted to replace a singer
 dominiki ko nikaalane ke baad, dream theatre ne maikenic ke saath khud ko anubandh se mukt karne kii safaltaapurvak ladaai ladi, jiske baad unhone gayakon kaa audishan shuru kiya or apane agle album ke liye saamagree likhi
 ek nae gayak ke liye apni khoj main, unhone 200 se adhik logon kaa audishan liya, unamem se fets warning kaa mukhya gayak jon arch or anya sabhi ko thukraa diya gaya
 In the mid-1990s, at an event in New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as its new singer
 usne band ke saath sirf teen hi gaanon kii prastuti di thi jab use apeksha ke vipareet nimna pradarshan ke liye nikaal diya gaya
 Five months later Dream Theater made its second performance, this time just instrumental
 Until 1991, the band's entire focus remained on the appointment of another singer and additional music writing
 isi avadhi ke dauraan unhone jo likhaa uskaa adhikansh hissaa 1992 main imejez and vards main parinat hua
 In January 1991, Kevin James labrie of the glam metal band Winter Rose flew from Canada to New York to audition
 labri ne band ke teen gaanon ko prastut kiya or use gayak ke pad ke liye turant rakh liya gaya
 Once admitted, labrie decided to remove his maiden name to avoid confusing his name with the other Kevin's in the band
 agle kuch maheenon ke liye, band ne sajiv pradarshan karte hue vaapasi kii or sangeet ke un gayan hisson par kaam kiya jo unhone labri kii niyukti se pehle likhaa tha
 Derek Shulman and ATCO Records, a division of Electra Records, signed a seven-album contract with Dream Theater, based on a three-song demo
 unke nae record anubandh ke tahat record hone vaala pehla elbum tha 1992 kaa imagej and vards 
 ise badhaava dene ke liye, label ne "anadar de" gane ke liye ek CD ekal or video clip jari kii, magar donon ne koi vanijyik prabhaav nahin dikhaaya
 "pul me under" gane ko, haalanki, band or label kii ore se bina kisi prabandhit badhaave ke, kaaphi ucch str kaa radio prasaaran praapt hua
 In response, ATCO produced a video clip for Pull Me Under, which was heavily repeated on MTV
 ek teesraa video clip "tech da time" ke liye nirmit kiya gaya, lekin yah pul me under" jitna safal nahin hua
 As a result of the success of "pull Me Under" as well as continuing tours throughout the US and Japan, Images and Words received Gold certification in the US and Platinum status in Japan
 1993 main europe kaa ek daura shuru hua, jisamen shaamil tha landan ke prasiddh marki club main ek kaarykram
 is sho ko record kiya gaya or live at da marki ke rup main jari kiya gaya, jo dream theatre kaa pehla aadhikarik sajiv album he
 Additionally, a video compilation of his Japan trip was released as Images and Words: Live in Tokyo
 tazaa saamagree par kaam karne ke liye utsuk, dream theatre ne may 1994 main studio main vaapasi kii
 Dream Theater's third studio album, Awake, was released on October 4, 1994, amid controversy among fans
 album ko mix kiye jane se kuch hi samay pehle, moore ne baaki band se kaha ki vah or adhik tour karne kaa icchhuk nahin he or na hi uski sangeet kii us style main koi ruchi he jise dream theatre prastut karata he or isliye vah dream theatre ko chhodkar sangeet main apni vyaktigat ruchi par dhyaan kendrit karegaa
 As a result, the band began to find another keyboard player to replace Moore, before considering a tour
 is album ko aalochakon or prashansakon, donon se acchhee sweekaaryata praapt hui
 The album is considered by some to be Dream Theater's darkest album, mainly due to the theme of the song, and most of its songs deal with internal conflicts
 udhaaharan ke liye "da mirar" madhpan kii padtaal karata he, jisase us vakt portnoy ubar rahaa tha
 Jens Johansen, who later became a member of Stratovarius, was one of the big names to audition, but was keen to fill that vacant position with band member, keyboardist Jordan Rudess
 portnoy or petruki ne rudes ko keyboard patrika main dekha, jahaan use pathakon ke surveykshan main "sarvshereshth naveen pratibha" ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya tha
 The duo invited her to a trial with the band at the Concrete Foundation Forum in Burbank, California
 dream theatre ke sadasyon ke liye, yah kaarykram avishwasaneey rup se shandaar rahaa or rudes ko sthaayee rup se keyboard vadak ke sthaan ko bharne ke liye kaha gaya, lekin iske bajaay rudes ne da dreigs dixi ke saath tour karnaa pasand kiya, kyonki usamen use adhik vyaktigat swatantraaa praapt hui
 Frustrated, Dream Theater hired fellow Berkeley alumnus Derek Sherinian, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper and Kiss, for a promotional tour of Awake
 daure kii samaapti par, band ne sherinean ko moore ke sthai pratisthaapan ke rup main lene kaa nirnay liya
 Once again finding itself with a new member, Dream Theater did not immediately begin work on new material
 duniya bhar ke prashansak, itsijam meling list par ek ho gaye or band par "e change of siruns" gane ko aadhikarik taur par jari karne kaa dabaav daalana shuru kiya
 It was written in 1989 and was intended to be part of Images and Words, but being about 17 minutes long, it was deemed too long for use in the studio
 haalanki, band ne ise kuch avasaron par sajiv rup se pradarshit kiya or saath hi agle varshon main 1995 tak is par sanshodhan jari rahaa
 The petition was a success and the group entered beartrack Studios in New York, with Sherinian to rewrite and record the 23-minute song, which had contributed significantly to its finalization
 "e change of siruns" ke prasar ke liye band ne ise EP ke rup main, cover geeton ke sangrah ke saath jari kiya jise unhone ankaward prashansak club main pradarshan ke dauraan sajiv rup se record kiya tha
 After some short performances to promote a Change of Seasons, Dream Theater took a break for a few months
 tathaapi, vyast rahane ke liye, band ne apane aadhikarik prashansak club ke madhyam se ek vishesh christmas CD jari kii, jisamen durlabh sajiv pradarshan shaamil the jise band ne apane praarambhik varshon ke dauraan record kiya tha
 Until 2005 he continued to release a new CD every Christmas
 antaraal ke dauraan hi, band ke sadasyon ne apane aagaamee sahyogaatmak lekhan satr ke liye vyaktigat rachanaaen likhni shuru kin
 Meanwhile, the Eastwest underwent several changes and Dream Theater's main exposure within the label was removed
 parinamswaroop, company kii nai team ko, eastwast ke purv karmi ke saath dream theatre ke rishton kaa bhaan nahin tha or unhone dream theatre par aisa album likhane ke liye dabaav daalaa jo adhik sulabh ho
 In mid-1997, he entered the studio to write his next album
 band par, mukhyadhara kii dhwani ko apnaane kaa dabaav daalane ke alaava, eastwast ne lekhak / nirmaataa desmund child ko, petruki ke "you or me" gane ke bolon ko taraashne ke liye kaam par rakhaa
 The entire band reworked the song musically, and it appeared on the album as "you Not Me", featuring a chorus that was barely reminiscent of the original
 child kaa album par ek pratyaksh prabhaav padaa, jiske tahat aisi rachanaaen utpann huin jo kam jatil or radio ke adhik anukool thim
 The band wrote about two cds worth of material, including a 20-minute long follow-up to the song "metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper" from Images and Words
 However, the label did not allow a double album to be released as it felt that the 140-minute record would not be digested by the general public
 James labrie also felt that the CD should be a single disc
 aprayukt gaanon ko baad main, itsijam ricard ke release fouling intu infinity main jari kiya gaya
 The material that was featured exclusively on this album was released as Fouling Into Infinity, which received mixed acceptance from fans who were more familiar with the band's former music
 haalanki, is album main madhyam pragatisheel sangeet tha, holo phers or "you note me" jaise trek ne kuch logon ko yah maanane ke liye prerit kiya ki yah ek nai, mukhyadhara sangeet vaale dream theatre kaa aagaaz he
 Overall, the album was disappointing both critically and commercially
 haalanki, portnoy ne us vakt saarvajanik rup se kuch nahin kaha, kai saal baad, 5 phers in a livetime ke liye 2004 kii DVD camentry main, unhone bataaya ki is avadhi ke dauraan ve itane niraash rahe ki unhone dream theatre ko puri tarah se bhang karne kaa man bana liya tha
 During the Touring Into Infinity world tour in Europe, two shows in France and the Netherlands were recorded for the album titled Once in a Livetime
 is album ko, 5 phers in a livetime ke video ke samay hi jari kiya gaya, jisamen kevin moore ke band ko chhod kar jane ke baad se lekar fouling intu infinity ke prachaarak daure tak kii avadhi ko pesh kiya gaya
 In 1997, Mike Varney of Magna Carta Records invited Portnoy to assemble a progressive 'supergroup' to work on an album, becoming the first in a long series of sub-projects for Dream Theater members
 gut main shaamil the drum par portnoy, guitar par petruki, baas par tony levin or keybordvadak jordan rudes, jo dreigs dixi se nikal chukaa tha
 The band assumed the name Liquid Tension Experiment and served as a medium through which Portnoy and Petrucci could convince Rudess to once again join Dream Theater
 1999 main, sherinean kii jagah lete hue, dream theatre ke tisare kii board vadak banane kii peshkash ko usne sweekaar kar liya
 With a new member, Dream Theater once again entered Beartrax Studios to write and record their next album
 portnoy ke ek ultimatum ke parinamswaroop, label ne band ko rachanaatmak kaa puraa niyantran pradaan kiya
 The follow-up to "metropolis Part 1", which was written during the seasons of Falling Into Infinity, resumed work
 unhone us 20 minute ke gane ko ek purna avadharana album main vistaarit karne kaa nirnay liya, jisamen ek kahani hogi jo punarjanm, hatya or vishwasghaat jaise vishyon ke aasapaas ghumegi
 prashansakon ke aadhaar se kisi prakaar kii pareshaani se bachane ke liye, lekhan or recording prakriya ko puri tarah se gopneey rakhaa gaya
 Things fans could find out before the album was released were a track list that was leaked against the band's wishes and a release date
 In 1999, Metropolis Pt
 2: Scenes from a Memory was released to high critical acclaim
 ise kai aalochakon or prashansakon dwaara samaan rup se dream theatre ke utkrisht kaary ke rup mana gaya, baavjood iske ki yah US album chart par sirf # 73 par pahunch sakaa
 The album was mixed by David Bottrill, but only a few of his mixes made it to the final album
 adhikansh hisse ko kevin sharlee dwaara rimix kiya gaya tha
 The rest of the mix can be heard in the band's official bootleg, "the Making of Scenes from a Memory"
 album ko record karte hue ek vyapak vishwa daura shuru hua, jo ab tak kaa unka sabase lambaa daura tha jo ek varsh se adhik samay tak chalaa
 unke kaaryakramon ne elbum ke naatakeey pahalu ko pratibimbit kiya
 He introduced the scenes from a memory album from beginning to end, with a video screen on the back wall that was presenting the story of the album side by side
 album ko isaki sampoornataa main pesh karne ke alaava, band ne dream theatre geeton ke ek duusare set ko bhi prastut kiya or saath hi saath dream theatre ke kuch cover or puraani saamagree ke kuch naveen roopon ko bhi bajaayaa
 neuyork shahar ke roseland bollroom main ek atirikt vishesh sho ke liye, kahani ke charitron ko nibhaane ke liye abhinaytaon ko rakhaa gaya or prastuti ke kuch hisson main pradarshan karne ke liye, ek girjaghar gayak-dal ko soochibaddh kiya gaya
 The show, which was the tour deadline in North America, was recorded for the band's first DVD release
 kai takneekee deriyon ke baad, metropolis 2000 sheershak vaali DVD ko 2001 ke shuru main jari kiya gaya
 Shortly afterwards, the band announced that an audio version of the program would be released, with a full four-hour long set-list
 kaarykram ke CD sanskaran ke cover par, jiskaa sheershak live seens from neuyork tha, dream theatre ke aarambhik logo ko sanshodhit karke dil ke bajaay ek seb chitrit kiya gaya or saath main world trade centre vaale neuyork shahar ke bahya rup ko jiske upar lau pradipt he
 In an unfortunate coincidence, the album was released on the same day as the September 11 attack
 album ko band dwaara turant waapas khinch liya gaya or phir baad main sanshodhit kalakaari ke saath jari kiya gaya
 Leaving that entire ordeal behind, Dream Theater once again entered beartracks Studios to record their sixth studio album
 unke dwaara pehali baar eastwast se ek dabl album jari karne kii anumati kii maang karne ke chaar saal baad, unhen antat yah mauka sicks digreez of inner tarabulence ke saath mila
 The first disc consisted of long tracks ranging from 7–13 minutes, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, the longest song written by Dream Theater to date
 us geet kii utpatti tab hui jab rudes dwaara likhi gai saamagree sicks digreez of inner tarabulence kaa "overchar" khand bani or band ne usamen nihit kuch alag dhunon or vichaaron ko liya or use ek purna kahani ke adhyyon main vistaarit kiya
 Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was well received by the press and critics
 awek ke baad se dream theatre kaa yah sabase zyada prachaarit album tha or isane billboard chart par # 46 or billboard internet chart par # 1 par shubharambh kiya
 During the next year and a half, he once again embarked on a world tour with an extended live schedule, including a few "album cover" shows, in which he completed Metallica's Master of Puppets and Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast in its entirety
 presented
 2003 ke dauraan, dream theatre ne ek or elbum ko likhane or record karne ke liye studio main pravesh kiya
 Since Scenes from a Memory was written and recorded together in the studio, in a spirit of change, the band adopted a different approach, setting aside three weeks of writing time before recording
 album ke liye recording satron ke bich main, do anya pragatisheel metal band, queensrishe or fets warning ke saath ek vishesh daure par uttari america janaa hua
 "escape from the Studio American Tour", as it was cited in Dream Theater's promotional material, featured Queensrèche and Dream Theater as major shows, while Fates Warning performed supporting acts at the event
 prayek sangeet kaarykram ke ek samaapan ke rup main, ek vistaarit doharaav hua karata tha jisamen dream theatre or queensrishe, donon ne ek saath manch par pradarshan kiya or aksar cover gane ko bajaayaa
 At the completion of the tour, Dream Theater returned to the studio to complete a recording of their seventh album Train of Thought
 He focused his attention on writing a great song-oriented album, the inspiration of this mindset he got while presenting Master of Puppets and Number of the Beast on a previous program tour
 parinamswaroop, aisa laga ki un do albamon kii sidhi-sapaat metal dhwani, train of thot main pravesh kar gai
 The album was a critical success, but it eluded a large portion of Dream Theater fans who loved traditional progressive rock, such as Yes or King Crimson
 Despite all this, it seemed that it expanded Dream Theater fans into new territories, which included many other metal fans
 ek or vishwa daura shuru hua, jiske dauraan dream theatre ne use pramukh rup se prabhavit karne vaale yas ke liye samarthan kaaryon kaa pradarshan kiya
 a modest North American tour was concluded by these two bands, after which Dream Theater continued their world tour with their so-called "an Evening Dream Theater"
 unka aglaa kadam ek or sajiv CD / DVD ke mishran ko jari karnaa tha, is baar ise, unke train of thot vishwa daure par tokyo, japan main prasiddh nippon budocan haul main record kiya gaya

 apane prachaar daure train of thot ke puraa hone par, dream theatre ne apane aathven album ko record karne ke liye NYC main hit factory studio main pravesh kiya
 As it turned out, they were the last group to record in that famous studio and after the end of their last season, the lights in that studio were switched off forever
 octaverium ko 7 june 2005 ko jari kiya gaya or isane band ke sangeet ko phir ek nai disha di
 Its eight songs continue Portnoy's "twelve Step Saga" as well as the title track, a 24-minute versatile musical epic that competes "A Change of Seasons"

 Unlike previous visits to Dream Theater, this time the performances were held in cities they had not visited before, or in cities where they had not performed a program for many years

 On May 1, Mike Portnoy spoke to Metal Hammer about the new album for his podcast and said that while 'the Shattered Fortress' is the last in a series of songs about his 12-step process of recovering from alcohol, 'the Best of Times' is a really heavy personal subject about his father who went through the making of the album and said that "he struggled with cancer throughout its production"
 The band has also announced a second Progressive Nation tour, with the tour's first schedule to be held in Europe
 opeth or anexpected ne europe main dream theatre ko manch par samarthan pradaan kiya, jabaki zappa plaz zappa or scale da summit ne uttar america leg bajaayaa or bigelf ne NA or europe tour, donon jagah prastuti di
 On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced on his forum that there had been a change in speakers for the Progressive Nation 2009 tour in North America

 After this, a cruiser of eight thousand tons was purchased

 In Hindi, it is also called 'self-immolation' and 'self-pity'

 It all starts before the child is three years old

 Autism is a mental disease whose symptoms start appearing from birth or from childhood

 No single cause of autism has been discovered
 anushodhon ke anusaar otism hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise- Narcissism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of narcissism are complex and it is unclear whether the cause of ASD is polygynous or rare mutations
 durlabh maamalon main, aatmavimoh ko un karkon se bhi joda gaya he jo janm sambandhi dosha ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Other proposed causes, childhood vaccines, are controversial and there is no scientific evidence
 haal kii ek samiksha ke anumaan ke mutabik prati 1000 logon ke peeche do maamle aatmavimoh ke hote hai, jabaki se sankhya ASD ke liye 6 / 1000 ke kareeb he

 Very few autistic children are able to become self-sufficient when they become adults
 aajkal ek aatmavimohi samskruti viksit ho gayi he, jisame kuch logon ko ilaaj par vishwaas he or kuch logon ke liye aatmavimoh ek vikaar hone ke bajaay ek sthiti he
 Narcissism may be better understood by a group of specific symptoms than by a symptom
 mukhya lakshanon main shaamil hai saamaajik sampark main asamarthta, baatcheet karne main asamarthta, simit shauk or doharaav yukt vyavhaar he
 In other aspects, such as the strange way of eating, however, it is common but not necessary for diagnosis
 saamaajik vikaas aatmavimoh ke shikaar manushya saamaajik vyavhaar main asamarth hone ke saath hi duusare logon ke mantavyon ko samajhane main bhi asamarth hote hai is kaaran log aksar inhen gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Social disabilities last from childhood to adulthood
 otistic bachche saamaajik gatividhiyon ke prati udasin hote he, wo logo kii ore naa dekhte hai, naa muskuraate hai or zyaadaatar apana naam pukaare jane par bhi saamaanya: koi pratikriya nahin karte hai
 The behavior of autistic babies is even more shocking, they do not shake their eyes, and they often touch and shake the other person's hand to speak

 mcdonald In mathematics, the Furye series is an infinite series that represents a recurring function of frequency f as the sum of sine and cosine functions with frequencies f, 2f, 3f, etc
 iskaa prayoge sabase pehle joseph furye ne dhaatu kii platon main ushma pravaah evam taapmaana kii gananaa ke liye kiya tha
 But later it was used in many fields and it proved to be a revolutionary tool of analysis
