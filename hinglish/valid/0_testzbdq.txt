 The word ‘dramil’ has come up in Shankaracharya’s physical commentary

 According to Tamil grammar, the form of the word Dramil is 'tirmid'
 aajkal kuch vidwaanon kii raay ho rahi he ki yah 'tiramid' shabd hi pracheen he jisase sanskritvaalon ne 'dravid' shabd bana liya

 Chaplin was also a big fan of Keaton: in 1925 he welcomed her into the United cast, cautioned against his fatal move to MGM in 1928, and wrote a role in his last American film, Limelight, specifically for Keaton, who had been on screen since 1915

 chaplin kii pehali filmi upasthiti ke baad, mekking a living film banaai gai, senet ko laga kii unhone ek badi mahangi galati kii thi
 Most believe Normand had persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance
 normand ko chaplin saunpe gaye the, jinhone unki kuch pehali filmon ko nirdeshit kiya or likhaa tha
 Chaplin did not like being directed by a woman and the two often disagreed
 ant main donon ne apane matbhedon ko dur kiya or chaplin ke keestone chhodane ke baad bhi lambey samay tak dost bane rahe
 Mac Sennett was not at all angry with Chaplin, and Chaplin believed that Sennett would have fired him after a disagreement with Normand
 However, Chaplin's films soon became successful and became one of Keystone's biggest stars
 chaplin kii pehali filmein mike senet ke keestone studio ke liye banaai gai thi, jahaan unhone apane bahetu charitra ko viksit kiya or bahut jaldi film banane kii kaushal or kala sikhi
janata ne pehali baar bahetu dekha jab 24 umr ke chaplin apni relies hone vaali duusari film, kid auto rasis ait venice, main dikhe 
 However, she made her own dress for a film, Mabels Strange Prediction, which was to be released a few days ago but was released later
 Mack Sennett requested that Chaplin "be in a comedy makeup"
 As Chaplin recalled in his autobiography
 "mujhe pataa nahin tha ki kaisaa mechap karnaa he
 i did not like my character as a press reporter
 lekin almaari kii ore jate hue maine sochaa ki main baigi pant, bade juute, ek chadi or ek darbi topi pahanoonga
main sab kuch virodhabhas chahta tha: pant baigi, kot tang, topi choti or juute bade
 main duvidha main tha ki bada dikhuun yaa chota, lekin senet ko yaad kiya to vah chahta tha kii main ek vruddh aadmi laguun, maine ek choti much lagaai, jo mujhe laga ki mujhe bada dikhaaegi, meri abhivyakti chhupaae bina
mujhe bhoomika kaa pataa nahin tha
 But when i was ready, i felt that person in those clothes and makeup
 main use jaanane laga or jab tak main stage main pahunchaa tab tak vah janm le chukaa tha
 Fatty Arbakkal contributed his father-in-law's derby and his pant
 Chester Conklin gave the short cutaway tailcoat and Ford Sterling 14 no
 Provided the shoes, which were so large, that Chaplin had to wear them on the wrong feet to walk
 He made a mustache out of Mc Sven's crepe hair
 sirf bans kii chadi unki apni thi
 Chaplin's many roles immediately began to gain enormous popularity among cinema audiences
 chaplin kii shuruaati keestone main mike senet kii atyadhik shaareerik kamedi or atishyoktipurna ishaaron ke maanak kaa upyog kiya gaya tha
 Chaplin's pantomime was subtle and could be suitable for romantic and homely imitations, replacing the usual keystone shooting and crowd scenes
 drishy pratibandh shuddh keestone the, lekin; bahetu bhoomika main laaton or eenton ke saath apane dushman par aakraamak hamalaa karnaa tha
 The film's audience liked the new cheerful comedian, though critics warned that his actions were at the limit of obscenity
 chaplin ko jaldi hi apni filmon kaa nirdesan or sampadan kaary saunpa gaya tha
 In his first year in films, he made 34 shorts for Sennett, as well as the historical comedy feature "tillis Punctured Romance"
 chaplin kii mukhya bhunika "da trenp" kii thi 
 parishkrut shishtachar, kapadey or ek sajjan ke sammaan ke saath "da trenp" ek aawaara he
 This character wears a tight coat, large trousers and shoes, and a derby; a bamboo stick; And has a unique toothbrush mustache
 bahetu charitra ko pehali film trailor main pradarshit kiya gaya tha jo ek america film theatre main dikhaaya janaa tha, niles granland dwaara viksit ek slide padonnati, jo kimarcus loev theatre shrinkhalaa main vigyaapan prabandhak tha or 1914 main harlem main loev ke seventh avenue rangamanch main dikhaaya gaya tha
 In 1915, Chaplin signed a more favorable contract with Essene Studios and further developed his cinematic prowess, adding a new level of depth and compassion to the Keystone style spectacle
 Most Essene films were more ambitious, twice the average Keystone comic
 Used to go chaplin ne apni bhi share company banaai, jisamen bholi edana parviens or hasya khalanaayak liyo white or bed jamison shaamil the
 In 1916, the Mutual Film Corporation paid Chaplin US $ 670,000 to produce two dozen reel comedies
 unhen puraa kalatmak niyantran diya gaya tha or atharah maheenon main baarah filmon kaa nirmaan kiya, jinhen cinema main sabase prabhaavshaalee kamedi filmon kii shrenee mili
 Practically every mutual comedy is an excellent one: Easy Street, One Aim, The Poonshop and The Adventure are best known
 edana parviens nayika bani raheen or chaplin ne apane share company main erik campbell, henry bergaman or albert austin ko shaamil kiya; campbell ek gilbert or sulivan diggaj ne, shandaar khalnaayaki pradaan kii or doosraa bananaa bergaman or austin, chaplin ke saath dashakon tak rahe
 Chaplin considered the Mutual Period the happiest period of his career, although he had other concerns that the films were formulaic during that time, due to the stringent production schedules that his contract required
 vishwa yudgh main america ke pravesh ke baad, chaplin apane kareebi dost duglas ferebanks or meri picleford ke saath ek swatantraaa bands ke pravaktaa ban gaye
 Most of Chaplin's films were distributed in the Keystone, Essene, and Mutual periods
 After Chaplin took control of his productions in 1918, industrialists met his demand by bringing back Chaplin's old humor
 filmon ko phir se gadha gaya, punah sheershak gadha gaya or baar-baar pun: prachlit kiya gaya, pehle cinemagharon ke liye, phir grih film bazaar or haal ke varshon main, grih video ke liye
 Essene was also guilty of this practice, creating 'new' Chaplin humor from old film clips and rejected performances
 1933 main baarah mutual hasya ko dhwani film ke rup main nayaa banaaya gaya, jab nirmaataa amadi je
 won bauren ne nai arcestra dhunon or dhwani prabhaav jode
chaplin ke darjanon filmon or vaikalpik sanskaran kii suchi ted okuda-david muska kii kitaab, keestone or assane main charlie chaplin: bahetu kaa aarambh main paaya ja saktaa he
 Attempts to make definitive versions of Chaplin's pre-1918 short films have begun in recent years; All twelve mutual films were reinstated in 1975 by archivist David Sheppard and the Blackhawk films, and in 2006 new restorations were released on DVD with more footage
 chaplin ne kabhi bhi prasanketak se zyada apni film nirmaan vidhiyon ke bare main baat nahin kii, yah daawa karte hue ki aisa karnaa ek jaadugar ke bhram ko todane ke samaan hoga
 In fact, Chaplin had never worked in the finished script until he started making the film The Great Dictator in 1940
 unhone yah vidhi tab viksit kii thi jab unke assane anubandh ne unhen apni filmein likhane or nirdeshit karne kaa mauka diya, jo ek aspasht parisar se shuru karnaa tha - udhaaharan ke liye "charlie ek swasthya spa main pravisht hue" yaa "charlie ek sahuukaar kii dukaan main kaam karte hai
 "chaplin then produced the sets and worked with his share company to improve the jokes and" business "around them, almost always considering the film
 jaise vichaaron ko sweekaar kar or tyaag kar, ek katha kii sanrachana ubhartee thi, to aksar chaplin ko pehle se hi puure ank ko waapas shoot karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi, jo kii anyathaa kahani kaa khandan karti
 chaplin kii adwitiya film banane kii takanic unki maut ke baad jaani gai, 1983 main british vruttchitr agyaat chaplin main jab unke durlabh jivit khaarij shot or cat anukram kii saavdhaanee se jaanch kii
 This is one of the reasons that Chaplin took longer to complete his films than his rivals
 iske alaava, chaplin ek avishwasaneey rup se maang karanevaale nirdeshak the, jaisaa pradarshan vah chaahate the bilkul vaisaa apane abhinaytaon ko dikhaate the or anginat shot lete the, jab tak unhen vaisaa shot naa mili jaisaa vah chaahate the
 Was funded and distributed by First National but otherwise gave him complete creative control that he could do at a slow pace, allowing him to focus on quality
 Chaplin built his Hollywood studio and exercised his freedom , Eternal work that will remain entertaining and impressive
 Although First National expected Chaplin to make short comedies such as: Rakhyat Mutuals, Chaplin, with ambitions expanded most of his personal projects into long feature-films, including Shoulder Arms, The Pilgrim and the feature-length classic, The Kid
 1919 main, chaplin ne meri picleford, duglas ferebanks or di

griphith ke saath sanyukt kalakaar film vitaran company kii sah-sthapana kii, yah sab vikasshil hollywood studio pranali main badhati takat vitarakon or vittiya se chhutkaaraa paanaa chaahate the
 The move, along with full control over the production of his film by his studio, assured Chaplin independence as a filmmaker
 1950 kii shruwaat ke dashak tak unhone UA kii mandal main kaam kiya
 All of Chaplin's joint cast films began with feature length, unusual acting in which Chaplin had only a minor cameo role, a Woman of Paris
 This was followed by the classic comedies Gold Rush and The Circus
 kai dhwani filmon ke aagaman ke baad, chaplin ne dhwani se patibaddh hone se pehle da sarkas, city lits, saath hi modern times banaai
 It was originally silent films in which music and sound were successful with effects
 city lits main yakeenan kamedi or bhavukta kaa sabase sahi santulan tha
 In the final scene, critic James Eggie wrote in Life magazine in 1949 that it was "the greatest single piece of acting ever committed to films
" " Chaplin's speaking films in Hollywood were The Great Dictator, Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight
 jabaki modern times mook thi, isamen baatcheet thi-zyaadaatar nirjeev vastuon se aati jaise kii radio yaa kisi tivi manitor se

modern times pehali film thi jisamen chaplin kii awaz suni gai thi 
haalanki, kai darshak ise abhi bhi ek mook film-or ek yug kaa ant maanate hai
 However, after becoming prevalent in 1927, "eloquent" immediately became a major method of film making, but during the 1930s Chaplin opposed making such a film
 vah cinema ko multah ek mook naatak kala maanate the
 He said: "anger is generally understood more easily than words
 chini pratikon kii tarah, naatakeey arth ke anusaar iskaa matlab alag hota he
 Listen to a description of something unfamiliar — for example, an African warthog; Tell us how surprised you were by giving a picture of an animal "
 Time magazine, 9 February 1931 yah chaplin kii bahumukhi pratibha ko ek shradhanjali he ki unhen 1952 kii film limlite main nritykala karne ke liye or doosraa da sarkas main gayak hone ke liye shrey mila he
 Many of the songs he composed were best known for "smile",] and were lyrical, helping to promote the revival of the film in the 1950s, a famous coverage by Nat King Cole
 chaplin kii aakhri film "dis iz maai saang" se, 1960 ke dashak main kai alag bhashaaon main "a countes from hongkong" pratham shrenee main tha or limlite se chaplin kaa vishay 1950 ke dashak main "itarnali" sheershak ke antargat safal rahaa tha
 Chaplin's successful move to Limelight won an Academy Award in 1972; Delays in the film's debut in Los Angeles made it desirable after decades of filming
 chaplin ne apni pichhali mook filmon ke liye bhi tippanee likhi, jab ve dubaara dhwani yug main release hui thi, khaskar 1971 main da kid ke punah release par
 Chaplin's first speaking film, The Great Dictator, was an act of disobedience against German dictators Adolf Hitler and Nazism, filmed in the United States, a year before the US abandoned the neutrality policy of entering World War II and Was released
 chaplin ne "adenoid hyankl" kaa paatr nibhaayaa, tomania kaa taanashaah, spasht rup se hitler par aadhaarit tha
 The film featured comedian Jack Oki as "benzino Napaloni", Jiv's dictator
 Napaloni's role was clearly an attack on Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and fascism
 paulet godard ne yahudee basti main ek aurat kaa chithran nibhaate hue, chaplin ke saath phir se film main dikhaai die
 In the political climate of the time, the film was seen as an act of courage, both for the depiction of Nazism and its depiction of Jewish characters, and for their persecution
 chaplin ne donon, adenoid hyankl or naajiyon dwaara sataae yahudee nai jaisaa dikhne vaale kii bhoomika nibhaai, jo shaareerik rup se chaplin ke bahetu charitra jaisaa dikhataa tha
 At the finale, by manipulating the situations through a complex plot involving the two roles portrayed by Chaplin, he stepped out of his comedic role to greet the audience with a speech
 da great dictator ke nirmaan, lekhan or abhinay ke liye vah namit hue
 Good writing chaplin kii raajnneetik sahanubhuti hameshaa vipakshi dal ke liye hoti thi
 His politics seemed normal by some contemporary standards, but in the 1940s his views were seen as communist by many
 garibi main bahetu dasha or unka kanoon ke saath takaraa jane ke alaava, mahaan avsaad se pehle bani unki mook filmon main aamtaur par pratyaksh rajnatik vishay yaa sandesh shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 But his films of the 1930s were openly political
 modern times main mazdooron or garib logon ko niraashajanak sthiti main chitrit kiya gaya he
 The final dramatic speech in The Great Dictator, which was without question important to patriotic nationalism, and his outspoken public support for opening a second European border to aid the Soviet Union in World War II in 1942, were controversial
 un bhaashanon main se kam se kam ek main, dainik kaaryakarta main ek samakaleen vivaran ke anusaar, unhone suchit kiya tha ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad samyawad duniya main fail jayega or ise maanav pragati ke baraabar bataaya gaya tha
 In addition to controversial speeches in 1942, Chaplin refused to support the war effort after supporting World War I, which enraged the public, although both of his sons served in Europe's military
 adhikansh dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan, unka joan bairi ke saath sambandh se gambhir aapraadhik or naagarik aaropon se lard rahe the 
yuddh ke baad 1947 main blike kamedi, monsiore vardox main poonjeevaad kii ore unke gambhir vichaaron ne dushmani badai, jisase kai america shaharon main yah film virodh kaa vishay ban gai
 As a result, Chaplin's last American film, Limelight was less political and more autobiographical
 unki agali europe nirmit film, a king in new york, rajnatik utpeedan or vyamoh ko vyangy karti he, jisane unhen paanch saal pehle america chhodane main majaboor kiya tha
 After the film, Chaplin gave up interest in making films on direct political messages, later stating that comedians and clowns should be "above politics"
 haalanki sanyukt rajya america main chaplin ko kai safatayen milin or 1914 se 1953 tak nivasee the, unhone hameshaa ek tatasth rashtravaadi avasthiti banaae rakhaa tha
 During the Mac Carthy era, Chaplin was accused of "un-american activities" as a suspected communist and J
D
 Edgar Hoover, who directed the FBI to keep a comprehensive secret file on him, tried to end his residency in the United States
 yudgh main duusare europea seemaa ke liye unke 1942 abhiyaan ke baad chaplin par FBI kaa dabaav badha or 1940 dashak ke ant main ek mahatvapurn str par pahunch gaya, jab congress kii hastiyon ne sunwaayee main unhen ek gavaah ke rup main bulaane kii dhamkee di thi
 This never happened, perhaps because of fear of Chaplin's ability to satirize investigators
 1952 main chaplin ne US chhod diya, jise united kingdom main landan ke liye limlite ke premier ke liye ek sankshipt yatra ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Hoover finds the trip and negotiated with the Immigration and Civil Service to revoke Chaplin's re-entry permission, to deport Chaplin so that he could not return for his alleged political leanings
 chaplin ne sanyukt rajya america main punah pravesh naa karne kaa faisla kiya, yah likhte hue ki, " xxrep 5 
 pichley vishwa yuddh kii samaapti ke baad se, main pratikriyaavaadi shaktishaalee samoohon ke liye jhooth or prachaar kaa putala ban gaya hoon, jinhone apane prabhaav se or america ke pit patrakarita kii sahaayta se, ek aswasthkar vaataavaran banaaya he, jisamen saaf vichaar rakhane vaale logon ko akelaa kar diya jaataa he or sataaya jaataa he
 i find it almost impossible to continue my motion-film work under these circumstances and so i have abandoned my home in the United States
 " Chaplin made his home in Vevey, Switzerland
 vah sankshep main or vijayi hokar unki patni ke saath april 1972 main mananeey auskar praapt karne or saath hi apane filmon ke punah release or vipanan karne hetu, sanyukt rajya america main laute
 Chaplin won an Oscar for the Academy Award for Original Music Success and was awarded two honorary Academy Awards
 1972 main, chaplin ne 1952 film limlite ke liye ek mul naatakeey main sarvshereshth sangeet ke liye auskar jeeta, jo ek badi hit thi, jisamen cleyar bloom sah abhinetri thi
 The film featured appearances with Buster Keaton, the only time the two great comedians appeared together
 Due to Chaplin's political problems, it did not have a theatrical setting in Los Angeles a week upon the film's first production
 namakan kaa yah maanak 1972 tak puraa nahin hua tha
 Chaplin was also named Best Director for the Circus in 1929, for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for The Great Dictator in 1940, and again Best Original for Monsieur Verdoux in 1948 For the script
