 mcdonald Externalism is a principle of enlightenment
 iske anusaar sansar kaa, bahya vastuon kaa, gyaan vastujanit maansik aakaaron ke anumaan dwaara praapt hota he
 We neither have direct knowledge of the external object nor does our mental state by illusion seem to resemble the external object
 man or bahya vastu donon kii satta he
 Shapes are produced in the mind corresponding to an external object
 un aakaaron se hi bahya vastu ke swaroop kaa anumaan lagata he
 The promoters of the Sautratrik branch of Buddhist philosophy in India accept this principle
 unke anusaar gyaan ke chaar pratyay hai- alamban, samanantar, adhipati or sahakaari
 External object is the reason for knowledge
 maansik akritiyaan unheen se nirmit hoti hai
 Consciousness arising from the mental state of the erratic predecessor of knowledge is the internal cause
 iske bina gyaan kii pratiti ho hi nahin sakati he
 The senses are the supreme cause
 hamen sparshagyan praapt hota he yaa anya koi, yah indriyon par hi nirbhar he
 Light, distance, etc
 are cooperative causes
 in chaar kaarnon yaa pratyayon ke upasthit hone par hi kisi vastu kaa gyaan ho saktaa he
 The knowledge thus attained is not obvious
 pratyaksh to keval maansik pratyay hai
 They have approximate knowledge of external objects
 pashchim main bahya anumeyavaad ke samatuly lock jaise darshanikon kaa 'pratyayon kaa pratikruti siddhant' dhyatavya he
 According to him, both mind and object have power
 vastuen svachh pattica jaise man par apni pratikruti utpann karti hai
 The knowledge of these replicas can be called deterministic
 unke pare yatharth kya he yah jaanane kaa koi nishchit saadhan nahin he
 External objects can be inferred only from the knowledge of mental patterns
 aadhunik yug kaa vivechanaatmak vastuwaad bhi bahut kuch bahya anumeyavaad kaa samarthan karata he
 The proponent of this theory was primarily the American philosopher Drake, Lovejoy, Pratt
 Rogers, Santayna, Sailors, Strong etc
 aapekshikta siddhant athwa saapekshikta kaa siddhant, yaa keval aapekshikta, aadhunik bhautikee kaa ek buniyadi siddhant he jise albert oinstin ne viksit kiya or jiske do bade ang hai - vishisht aapekshikta or saamaanya aapekshikta 
 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: vyatikaran se kisi bhi prakaar kii tarangon kii ek duusare par parsparik prakriya kii abhivyakti hoti he, jiske parinamswaroop kuch vishesh sthitiyon main companon or unke prabhaavon main vruddhi, kami yaa udaseenta aa jaati he
 a detailed study of interference works at the core of all instruments with large resolution power
 bhautik prakaashiki main is dhaaran kaa samavesh thomas yang ne kiya
 Interference after them has been used to express the homogenous or tajjanic effects of waves or vibrations of any kind
 sankshep main kisi bhi tarah kii tarangagati ke kaaran laharon ke takaraav se utpann sthiti ko vyatikaran kii sangya di jaati he
 Whenever two different wavelengths meet together on the surface of water or any other fluid, a state of interference can occur
 jahaan ek tarangasamooh se sambanddh laharon ke tarangashringon kaa duusari shrunkhlaa se sambhddhalaharon ke tanrgashringon se sammilin hota he, vahaan drav kii sataha kaa unnayan us sthaan par laharon ke swatantra or ekant astitv ke sambhav unnayanon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 When the wavelength of one of the waves ends at the wavelength of the other, the wave oscillation at the surface of the fluid is reduced and the yield gradient is equal to the difference between the elevation of one wave component and the gradient of the other
 dhwani main utpann vispand isi vyatikaran kaa ek saadhaaran rup he, jahaan do yaa do se adhik tarangasamooh, jinke tarangadairdhya main maamuli sa antar hota he, kareeb ek hi disha main agrasar hote hue milte hai
 The speed of light is waves
 kisi ekal prakashasrot se ni:sruth urja madhyam ke parshv main saan rup se bikhar jaati he
 If two independent sources of light from which waves of the same magnitude and integral art form continuously oscillate, are placed adjacent to each other, then the distribution of energy around the medium is not congruent, where the beak of one light is on the beak of the other light, Or the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the amplitude increases there and the energy or light intensity of the amplitude also increases
 saath hi, yadi ek kaa tarangashring duusare ke tarangagart par gire, to parinami aayam shunya hota he or prakaash kii tivrata ghat jaati he
 The first state is called collateral interference and the second one is called destructive interference
 paardarshee thos ke patale patton or sabun ke bulabulon par prakaash kii kirnon ke padane par vyatikaran kaa spasht parichay mil saktaa he
 When rays of light fall on soap bubbles, or thin strips of lead, the rays from both their outer and inner surfaces are reflected and returned to the observer's eyes and in wavelets of light that reach the eyes from both sources, Due to the subtle differences in the arts, there is interference, due to which the effects produced are quite seductive and fascinating
 sabun kaa koi bulbula ekvarni prakaash main praaia: kuch kaali rekhaon se aavruth dikhaai padataa he
 The reason is that the two wavelengths of light at the black visible points, which come from the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble, respectively, almost or completely destroy each other's effects
 yadi bulbula shwet prakaash main dekha jaae, to hamen saamanyatya kaali rekhaayen nahin dikhaai padatin
 They are replaced by strips of color
 aisa isliye hota he ki vibhinn rang, jinke yoga se shwet prakaash kii utpatti hoti he bhinn bhinn tarangon ke hote hai, jisase bulbule ke kisi bindu par vyatikaran se rang ke keval ek ansh maatr kaa vinaash hota he or ujle prakaash ke shesh avyav batch rahete hai, jo aankhon par apana purna varniya prabhaav utpann karte hai
 There are some basic conditions that need to be met for the deviation
 inamen se kuch to prakaash kii prakruti main hi antarnihit he or duusari, yadi parinaam kaa prekshan prayog dwaara karnaa hua to, aavashyak ho uthati he
 For simplicity, we can consider two electromagnetic waves, which produce perishable interference at a point from where both waves pass
 yadi vyatikaran kaa praturup sthir rahaa, arthath yadi prakaash kii tivrata kaa parinami tathakthith bindu par samay ke prayek maan ke liye shunya ho, to nimnlikhit sharton kii purti aavashyak he : Two other conditions for successful observation of light-generated patterns, which must be met, are: yadi do atisannikat prakashasrot ke samaan pariman or kalantar kii taragen kisi kalantar vishesh par kuch dur sthit parde ke ek bindu par milen, to parde par kuch bilkul kii rekhaayen jinke antaraal main adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen rahati hai, dekhi jaati hai
 Those minimum and maximum intensity lines are called interpolation fringes
 jab kabhi vyatikaran fringen patali filmon ke chalate banati hai, tab unka kaaran vyatikaran main bhaag lenevaali kirnon ke kalantar kaa parivartan hota he
 This change is caused by a change of film thickness, or a change of volume angle
 yadi motaai samang nahin hui, to praaia: donon tathy ek hi saath kriyasheel ho uthte hai; lekin ek baat spasht he ki jab koi film aankh dwaara dekhi ja rahi he, to use aankh se kareeb 25 senmi
 kii duuri par rakhaa janaa chahie
 If the range of the film is not very large, the difference of the tilt of the rays coming from different points of the film to our eyes is not much and the volume angle of each ray is almost equal
 at: fringen mukhyat: film kii motaai kii bhinnata ke kaaran banati he
 It is also quite clear that at all the points of the film, where the thickness is the same, the light will be the same
 yadi aisa koi bhi bindu kaala yaa ujwal hua, to shesh bhi tadnurup kaale yaa ujwal honge
 Therefore, black or bright strips are just the point of different points of the film of the same thickness

 virechan siddhant dwaara arastu ne pratipaadit kiya ki kala or sahitya ke dwaara hamaare dooshit manovikaron kaa uchit rup se virechan ho jaataa he
 Successful tragedy evokes feelings of compassion and tragedy through ecstasy, harmonizing them and thus presenting Anand's role
 virechan se bhavatmak vishranti hi nahin hoti, bhavatmak parishkar bhi hota he
 In this way, Aristotle has proved art and poetry to be admirable, gracious and effortless
 arastu ne is siddhant ke dwaara kala or kavy kii mahatta ko punarpratishthit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 Aristotle's master Plato recommended that poets and artists be kept outside their ideal state
 unka maananaa tha ki kavy hamaari vaasanaon ko poshit karne or bhadakaane main sahaayak he isliye nindaneey or tyajya he
 Religious and high moral literature is an exception, but most of the literature does not fall under this ideal category
 virechan siddhanth kaa mahatva bahuvidh he
 The first is that he resolved the attack on Plato by poetry and secondly that he must have influenced the poetic thinking of the past in some form or the other
 'virechan' unani katharsis kaa hindi roopaantar he
 The definition of Greek medical science is 'catharsis' and the term of Indian medicine is 'virechan'
 iskaa arth he- rochak aushadhi ke dwaara shaareerik vikaron arthath udar ke vikaron kii shuddhi
 Just as the removal and purification of bodily feces is necessary for health, similarly the removal and purification of mental feces like jealousy, malice, greed, attachment and anger is necessary
 arestu ne ‘catharsis’ shabd kaa lakshanik prayog maanav-man par padanevaali traasadee ke prabhaav kaa udghaatan karne ke liye kiya he
 Plato's objection to the tragedy was - "instead of suppressing human desires, they nourish and nourish them
" vah ucchtar tattvon ke badale nimnatar tattvon ko ubharkar aatma main araajaktaa utpann karti he
 '' arestu ne catharsis siddhanth dwaara plato ke is akshep kaa khandanakar traasadee kii upadeyata sthapit kii
 Aristotle presented the same as a virtue to Plato who had proved the fault
 arestu kaa abhimath he- That is, tragedy is the name of a copy of a work involving a serious self-fulfilling and certain dimension
 


 jiske karunaa traas se udrek dwaara in manovikaron kaa uchit vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, tragedy does not only incite undesirable feelings, but expels human real-life compassion and feelings of tragedy through the artificial evocation of compassion and tragedy
 virechan kaa ullekh arestu kii rachanaaon main keval do sthanon par miltaa he
 The first is mentioned in his 'poetics' treatise, where the nature of Tragedy is indicated and the second in the book 'political' where he has demonstrated the usefulness of music
 in sthalon par unhone virechan shabd kaa sutara rup main evam uske swaroop kii charchaa kii he
 Aristotle says - "music should be studied not for one, but for the accomplishment of many purposes, that is, for instruction in education
" sangeet se bauddhik anand kii bhi uplabdhi hoti he
 xxrep 5 
 They become silent due to the influence of religious ragas, as if their charge is quenched and purgated
 is prakaar virechan se abhipraay shuddhi se he
 These ideas of Aristotle are found in retail form in the context of tragedy-deliberation
 vishesh suvyavasthitrup se inkaa sampaadan nahin kiya gaya he
 In the modern era, Aristotle's limited and meager words have taken the form of a complete poetic-classical theory
 atah ek prashn swaabhaavikrup se uthaa ki karunaa or traas ke udrek tathaa rechan se arestu kaa multah kya abhipraay tha? is sandarbh main arestu ke parvarti vyakhyakaaron ne virechan ke bhinn-bhinn arth or vyakhyaayein prastut kin- Among the Aristotle interpreters, Prof
 Gilbert Murray and Livy have presented a theological interpretation of the phrase
 dharmaparak arth kii ek vishesh prishthbhumi he
 It is related to religious festivals
 pro gilbert mare kaa kathan he ki - ‘‘yunaan main dionusus naamak devtaa se sambaddh utsav apane aap main ek prakaar kii shuddhi kaa pratik tha, jisamen vigat samay ke kalush or paap evam mrityu-sansargon se mukti mil jaati he
 Thus, this remedy of peace of internal disorders by external disorders was quite prevalent in religious institutions during Aristotle's time
 unhone iskaa lakshanik prayog usee ke aadhaar par kiya he or virechan kaa arth hua- ‘‘bahya uttejnaa or ant main uske shaman dwaara atmik shuddhi or shaanti
 '' barnej naamak german vidwaan ne virechan kii nitiparak vyakhya kii he
 According to him, the human mind is beset by many psychics
 jinamein karun or bhay, multah dukhad manoveg hai
 Tragedy overpowers the theater by unrealistic circumstances by exaggerating them with artificial ambiguous measures, resolving the nation of these emotions in the observer's mind as lust and consequently establishing mental harmony
 atah virechan kaa nitiparak arth hua - manovikaron ke uttejan ke uparant udvaig kaa shaman or tajjanya maansik vishadta
 Current psychology and psychoanalytic scriptures also confirm this meaning
 maansik swasthya kii sadhak hone ke kaaran yah paddati naitik maani gai he
 In Goethe and English poetical critics there are hints of the artistic meaning of the phrase
 arestu ke prasiddh vyakhyaakaar pro bujar kaa abhimath he ki virechan keval manovigyaan athwa nidaanshastra ke ek tathy vishesh kaa vaachak na hokar, ek kala-siddhanth kaa abhivyanjak he
 Thus, the duty of tragedy is not only to present a medium of expression for compassion or tragedy, but to provide them with a certain artistic satisfaction
 inako kala ke madhyam main dhalkar parishkrut or spasht karnaa he
 The meaning of purgation is broad here - mental balance is just the former part of it, the culmination of its artistic gratification without which the circle of artistic taste of tragedy is not complete
 prashn uthta he ki uparyukt teenon arthon main se koun sa arth arestu ke mat ke sarvaadhik nikat he? yadhyapi tatkaaleen dharmik paristhitiyon se arestu kaa prabhavit hona swaabhaavik he or swayan dharmik sangeet kii ore arestu ne sanket bhi kiya he ki jis prakaar dharmik sangeet shrotaaon ke bhaavon ko uttejit kar phir shant karata he, usee prakaar traasadee prekshak ke bhay ore karunaa ke bhaavon ko jagaakar baad main unhen upashmit karti he
 In relation to tragedy, this view is not literally correct, because the people who were cured by music were already emotional, whereas those who go to the auditorium are not in a mental state of compassion or fear
 atah virechan siddhanth kii prakalpana par ukt pratha kaa prabhaav apratyaksh to mana ja saktaa he; kintu sidhaa sambandh sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 As far as ethical meaning is concerned, psychology also confirms this
 virechan se arestu ke taatpary bhaavon kaa nishkasana maatr nahin, varan unka santulan bhi he
 Similarly, the meaning of Prof
 Butcher is also worth considering
 unke anusaar virechan ke do paksh he- ek abhavatmak or doosraa bhavatmak
 The negative aspect is that he first stimulates the emotions, then after quenching them, he provides peace of mind
 iske baad sampann kalatmak parithosh uskaa bhavatmak paksh he
 It is not appropriate to give an emotional form to the phrase
 arestu kaa abhisht keval man kaa saamanjasy or tajjanya vimadta tak hi he, jiske aadhaar par vartmaan aalochak richards ne ‘antavritiyon ke samanjan’ kaa siddhanth pratipaadan kiya he
 Dr
 Nagendra is of the opinion that "the seeker of the art of taste is a must - the contemplated mind accepts the joy of art more quickly, but art of the taste is not an easy manifestation of art
" atev virechan siddhanth ko bhavatmak rup dena kadaachit nyaaysangat nahin he
 '' aadhunik vidwaanon ke matanusaar traas or karunaa kii bhavanaayen apane prakrut rup main adhik kshtprad banakar prakat hoti he
 As a result of the observation of tragedy, she publishes her affectionate and non-objectionable form
 is rup main ve nivaiyaktik evam saarvbhaum rup main saamne aati hai
 From this, the close relation of purgation and generalization can be easily seen
 yahan yah prashn uthta he ki kya traasadee ke prabhaav yaa prayojan ko samajhane ke liye virechan siddhanth hi ekmaatr samichin madhyam he? vastutah traasadee ke kaary ko rechan tak simit kar dena uske uddeshy ko sankeern banane jaisaa he
 In contrast, sentimental critics have tried to prove that the undesirable feelings also change and their excesses are erased by making the field of purgation extremely wide
 is vyapak drushtikon kaa pratipaadan dryden, edison aadi vidwaanon ne kiya
 Some scholars doubt the existence of the arbitration process
 unka akshep he ki vaastavik jivan main aisa virechan nahin hota he
 Karunadi becomes enlightened by tragedy, but her peace does not lead to complete peace of mind
 vastav main traasadee kaa chamatkaar multah ragaatmak hota he
 She enlightens emotions through the process of arbitration, adjusts them and thus presents the role of joy
 yah virechan siddhanth kii mahatvapurn dein he
 The second objection is that the parts displayed in the tragedy are unrealistic, so they are unable to enlighten our sentiments, no matter of arbitration
 vastutah yah mat bhi uchit nahin he
 Bhavodevak by tragedy is certainly not the result of art-miracle, but a culmination of a positive effect
 sarabhoot samanjankaree prabhaav hi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, convulsions are completely neutral
 manovishleshan shaastra ke anusaar bhaawanaaon kii atrupti yaa daman maansik rogon kaa pramukh kaaran he
 They can be thought through proper expression and emotion of emotion
 achetan man main pade bhav uchit abhivyakti ke abhaav main maansik granthiyon ko janm dete hai
 By bringing these glands to conscious level, suffocation and insatiableness of the mind is removed
 isse man kaa tanaav dur ho jaataa he or chitt ek prakaar kii vishadta evam halkaapan anubhav karata he
 This process is the basis of the free thought-flow system of psychoanalytic science
 is drushti se virechan kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar sarvatha pusht he
 Scholars like Freud have presented Aristotle sentences in many places in support of their views
 arestu dwaara pratipaadit traasadee ke prabhaav kaa bhartiya kavyashastra main karun ras se paryaapt samya he
 The basic impulses of tragic impact are compassion and tragedy
 ye donon bhav multah dukhad hai
 On the other hand, the permanent feeling of Karun Rasa is 'mourning'
 bhartiya kavyashastra ‘shok’ sthaayee bhav ke antargat karunaa ke saath traas ke astitv ko sweekaar karata he
 Favored destruction or misery are the causes of mourning
 inase karunaa or traas donon kii udbhuti hoti he
 The tragedy is experienced by the compassion of the disaster, the fear of recurrence of the same disaster
 kintu bhartiya aacharyon or arestu ke drushtikon main pramukh antar yah he ki arestu kaa traasad prabhaav ek mishra bhav he, jabaki bhartiya kavyashastra kaa shok sthaayee bhav multah amishra he, jaise - sita ke durbhaagya se utpann karunaa main traas kaa sparsh nahin he, jabaki arestu kii drushti main traasahin karun prasang adarsh sthiti nahin he

 chokhamela maharashtra ke ek nami sant the
 Saint Chokamela has written many abhangs, due to which he has been called India's first Dalit-poet
 saamaajik-parivartan ke aandolan main chokhamela pehle sant the, jinhone bhakthi-kaal ke daur main saamaajik-gaiyr barabari ko logon ke saamne rakhaa
 In his compositions, he appears deeply concerned for the Dalit society
 chokhamela ke jivan sambandhit bahut kam jaankaree uplabdh he
 Since Saint Namdev is called his Guru, his time period should be around this
 chokhamela kaa janm maharashtra ke dalit jati main hua tha
 He was born in a village called Mehunaraja, which falls in the Dyalgaon Raja tehsil of district Buldhana
 chokhamela bachapan se hi vithoba ke bhakt the
 People of the following castes had no other hope in the Hindu social system, so people of serious nature considered godly devotion
 ye alag baat he ki tathakthith bhagwaan ke mandir main unhen pravesh bhi karne nahin diya jaataa tha
 Once Chokhamela came to Pandharpur where Kirtan of Saint Namdev was being done
 ve namdev maharaj ke kirthan se mantra-mugdh ho gaye
 Namdev was a Vitthal-devotee and then he was living in Pandharpur
 namdev ke aakarshan or vitthal-bhakthi ne chokhamela ko pangarpur khinch laayaa
 He started living in Mangalvedh near Pandharpur with his wife Soyra and son Karmamela
 chokhamela nity vithoba ke darshan karne pangarpur aate or mandir kii saaf-safai karte
 However, being a Mahar, he was not allowed to enter the temple
 chokhamela kii ek bahan nirmala bhi hi jo vithoba kii bhakt thi
 There is also a mention of Banka, a disciple of Chokamela

 Varkari means traveler

 They continue walking barefoot singing unbroken

 Abhang is a form of Ovi that women sing

 Many of them describe the brutal and heart-touching atrocities of the brahmin-pandits on Abhang Chokamela

 The Bhakti-movement definitely strengthened the castes called the following
 ve dur se hi sahi, dhol-manjire ke saath ucch jati hinduon ke kaanon main apni aawaaj pahunchaane lage
 They started asking what is their fault in being 'low'
 More or less this was the situation of women in Hindu society
 shudron or ati-shudron ke saath hindu nari bhi poochne lagi ki uske saath achhut-sa bartaav kyon ?namdev, jo darji samaaj ke the or jinaki saamaajik sthiti shudron main thi, chokhamela ko bahut chaahate the
 He was overwhelmed by the immense devotion of Chokhamela
 hamen aise kai prasang milte hai, jab namdev ne sanathan hindu panda-pujaariyon ke krodh se chokhamela kaa bich-bachaav kiya tha
 The task of Chokamela's fathers and grandfathers was to pick up the dead animals in the Hindu houses of the village and take them outside the village and hide them
 iske liye unhen koi mehnatnama nahin diya jaataa tha
 At that time, separate neighborhoods of the Mahars were outside the village
 hinduon kii juuthan par maharon kaa guzar hota tha
 Hindus did not count Mahars in their varna system even in the fourth varna
 unhen varna-bahya mana jaataa tha
 He was forbidden to receive education
 unhen saamaanya suvidhaayen jaise saarvjaanik kune se pani bharne kii manaahi thi
 There was a ban on their entry into the temple
 pangarpur ke vitthal, jo vishnu kaa hi rup he jinhen kabhi krishna to kabhi shiv ke swaroop main puja jaataa haisant chokhamela ne kai abhang likhe hai, jiske kaaran unhen bharat kaa pehla dalit-kavi kaha gaya he
 Chokamela was the first saint in the social-change movement, who put the social-non-equality in front of the people during the period of devotion
 apni rachanaaon main ve dalit samaaj ke liye khaase chintit dikhaai padate hai

 The person does not know anything of truth or untruth when he is the head of all virtues, that is, he lives in the darkness of ignorance
 yani koun si baat uske liye acchhee he vaa koun si buree ye yatharth pataa nahin chalata or is swabhaav ke vyakti ko ye jaanane kii jigyaasa bhi nahin hoti
 The classification between Sattva, Rajas and Tamas is seen in various aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism, where Tamas is the lowest
 tamas ek shakti hoti he jo ki andhkaar, maut, vinaash or agyanta, susti or pratirodh ko badhaava detii he
 Tamas-effected life results in demerit according to karma; An inferior life-form is demoted
 ek tamsik jivan ko aalasy, laaparvaahee, dwesh, dhokhadhadi, asamvedansheeltaa, aalochana or galati dhundhna, kuntha, lakshyaheen jivan, taarkik soch yaa yojana kii kami or bahaane bananaa, dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Tamasic activities include eating more food and / or consuming drugs and alcohol

 Tamas is the lowest, heaviest, slowest and most dull
 It is devoid of the energy of Rajas and the glow of Sattva
 tamas kaa kabhi bhi tamas dwaara virodh nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be resisted through Rajas and it can be even more difficult to convert directly from Tamas to Sattva
