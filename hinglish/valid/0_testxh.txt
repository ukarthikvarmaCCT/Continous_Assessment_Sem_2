 The Directive Principles of State Policy are the latest elements of democratic constitutional development
 sarvapratham ye ireland ke samvidhan me lagu kiye gayi the
 These are the elements which have developed with the development of the Constitution
 in tatwon kaa kaary ek janakalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa he
 The Directive Principles of State Policy have been incorporated from Articles 36 to 51 of the Constitution of India
 bhartiya samvidhan ke bhaag 3 tathaa 4 milakar samvidhan kii aatma tathaa chetana kehalaate he in tatwon main samvidhan tathaa saamaajik nyaay ke darshan kaa vaastavik tatv nihit hai
 Directors are the elements of executive and legislature according to which they have to exercise their rights
 rajya ke niti nirdeshak tattvon kaa uddeshy samuhik rup se bharat main aarthik evam saamaajik loktantr kii rachana karnaa tathaa kalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa hai
 According to Article 37, these elements cannot be applied in any court, these elements are not legal and have political form and only have moral rights
 ve na to koi vaidhanik baadhyataa hi rajya pe lagu karte he na janata hetu adhikaar kartavya
 They are just such general instructions for the state that the state should do such things which will be beneficial for the people of the state
 in nirdeshon kaa paalan karypalika kii niti tathaa vidhayika kii vidhiyaan se ho saktaa he
 In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the elements were essentially subordinate to the fundamental rights
 Chamar Durai Rajan suit would not give priority to fundamental rights in case of a dispute, but when the state legislature started the abolition of zamindari
 In order to give effect to the Directive Principles of Article 39B, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of these elements and in Kameshwar Singh Vs
 From 1952 till 1957, the Supreme Court accepted that the Directive Principles of Policy cannot prevail on Fundamental Rights, but later the Court laid down the Harmony Principle and tried for collaborative development and tried to make both of them more effective
 As much as was possible
 hormoni siddhant dono ke madhya koi sangharsh nahi maan kar dono ko ek duusare kaa poorak maanata he
 According to this theory, if two interpretations are possible that balance the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Right, the second interpretation should be disputed in them, then the court should give priority to the first interpretation over the second interpretation if only one interpretation is possible and which policy - If there is a conflict between the rights, then the court is bound to abolish the 'privy purse' and give priority to the rights over the policy directors
 The Nationalization Act, which was brought for the compliance of Article 39 'B' and 'S', was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 25th Amendment 1971 in response to this and Article 31 Gave birth to s which states that if a law is passed which gives effect to the Directive Principles of 39 b and in this process if paragraph 14, 19, anu 31 sa ke anusaar koi vidhi jo anu 39 ba sa ko prabhavi karti he kisi bhi nyaayalay me parakshit nahi kii ja sakegi
 This amendment was challenged in the Keshavanand Bharti suit
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne anu 31 sa ke pratham bhaag ko vaid maan liya kintu duusare bhaag ko is aadhaar par khaarij kar diya kyonki vah nyaaypalika kii punarikshan shakti chin leti he jo ki samvidhan ke mul dhaanchen kaa ang he
 With the decision of this suit, the Previ Purse and Banking Nationalization Act became valid
 42 vaa samvidhan sanshodhan adhinium 1976 31 sa ko sanshodhit karata he isamen kaha gaya he ki sanshodhit 31 sa ke anuroop yadi rajya koi aisi vidhi banaaye jo ki kisi bhi niti nideshak tatv ko prabhavi kare is aadhaar par asanvaidhanik ghoshit nahin kar sakate ki vah anu 14,19,31 kaa ullaghan karte isi tarah vah vidhi nyaayalay me chunauti praapt nahi kar sakati
 This amendment was challenged in Minerva Mill vs Union of India suit in 1980, in which the Supreme Court declared the new amendment to Article 31 non-constitutional as it distorted the balance of parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution
 44 ve sanshodhan 1978 ne anu 31 kaa hi vilopan kar diya
 The present situation is that two directive elements 39B, c can be applied by giving preference to two fundamental authorities 14, 19
 samvidhan sabha main bhaag 4 ke mahatv pe prashn kiya gaya tathaa kaha gaya ki yah bhaag hi vyarth he kyonki ye tatv koi vaidhaniktaa nahi rakhte he
 These are actually test balloons that test the ability of the government in power
 kuch vidhiyon kii sanvaidhaniktaa kaa pareekshan niti nideshak tatwon ko dhyaan me rakhkar kiya ja sakegaa
 They have educational significance

com Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation is a policy implemented in schools in India that was launched in 2009
 isaki aavashyakata shiksha ke adhikaar ke pariprekshya main aavashyak ho gaya tha
 This evaluation process has been initiated by the examination boards of state governments and the Central Board of Secondary Education
 is paddati dwaara 6veen kaksha se lekar 10veen kaksha ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 In some schools this process is also applicable for class 12th
 bharat ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay or kendriya madhyamik shiksha board ne vidhyalay shiksha kshetra main sudhaar laane ke dinaank 20 sitambar, 2009 ko ghoshit kiya ki satat or vyapak moolyankan ko sudrudh banaaya jayega or oktober 2009 se kaksha 9 ke liye sabhi sambhddha vidyalayon main upyog kiya jayega
 It was further stated in the circular that a new grading system will be implemented for classes 9 and 10 from the current academic session 2009-10
 dinaank 29 sitambar, 2009 ke paripatr sankhya 40 / 29-09- 2009 main ullikhit kakshaon ke liye lagu kii jane vaali grading pranali ke sabhi vivaran pradaan kiye gaye the
 CBSE started imparting continuous and comprehensive evaluation training across the country from 6th October 2009 through workshops in instructor-training format
 satat tathaa vyapak moolyankan kaa arth he chaatro ke vidhyalay aadhaarit moolyankan kii pranali jisamen chaatr ke vikaas ke sabhi paksh shaamil hai
 It is a process of development of assessment in which dual objectives are emphasized
 ye uddeshy vyapak aadhaarit adhigam or duusari ore vyavahaargat parinaamon ke moolyankan tathaa nirdhaaran kii satatta main hai
 The term "continuous" in this scheme refers to the emphasis on evaluating the identified aspects of students' "growth and development", which is a continuous process, rather than an event, built into the whole teaching-learning process
 And extends throughout the academic session
 iskaa arth he nirdhaaran kii niyamitata, unit pariksha kii aavriti, adhigam ke antaraalon kaa nidaan, sudharatmak upayon kaa upyog, punah pariksha or swayan moolyankan
 The second term "broad" means that the scheme seeks to include both academic and co-educational aspects of the growth and development of students
 chunki kshamtaayen, manovritiyaan or abhiruchiyaan apane aap ko likhit shabdon ke alaava anya roopon main prakat karti hai atah yah shabd vibhinn sadhano or takneekon ke anuprayog ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he tathaa iskaa lakshya nimnlikhit adhigam kshetron main chaatr ke vikaas kaa nirdhaaran karnaa haih Thus the scheme is a curricular initiative strength, which seeks to displace the examination towards overall learning
 iskaa lakshya achche naagarik bananaa he jinka swasthya acha ho, unke paas upyukt kaushal tathaa vaanchit gunon ke saath shaikshik utkrushtataa ho
 It is hoped that this will enable the students to meet life's challenges with confidence and success
 shiksha kaa praathmik prayojan purush or mahila main pehle se maujuud sampoornataa ko prakat karnaa he, shiksha kaa prayojan bachche / vyakti kaa chahunmukhi vikaas karnaa he
 In the report of the International Education Commission for the 21st Century, UNESCO mentions four levels of human life, such as physical, intellectual, mental and spiritual
 is prakaar, chahunmukhi vikaas ke rup main shiksha kaa prayojan bhautik, bauddhik, maansik or aadhyatmik staron main prayek bachche kii chuphi hui sambhavyata kaa anukulan karnaa he
 For the first time in the country, CBSE tried to implement this huge goal of all-round development
 samaaj ke prayek kshetra main vaishvikaran kaa shiksha ke liye mahatvapurn nihitarth he
 Increasing commercialization of education is being seen everywhere
 atah vidyalayon ko vastu banane or vidyalayon ke liye bazaar sambandhi sankalpanaaon ke anuprayog or vidyalayon kii gunvattta par badhate dabaav ke prati satark rahane kii jarurat he
 The ever-increasing competitive environment, in which schools are also being dragged, and the increasing expectations of parents are putting unbearable weight of stress and anxiety on children, adversely affecting the personal growth and development of very young children And thus their enjoyment of learning is diminishing
 chaatro kii samaj, shaikshik lakshya, gyaan kii prakruti or ek saamaajik sthal ke rup main vidhyalay kii prakruti saidhantik rup ke anusaar kaksha abhyaas ko maargdarshan dene main hamaari sahaayta ho sakati he
 Conceptual development is thus a continuous process of deepening and enriching relationships and acquiring new levels of meaning
 yah un siddhanton kaa vikaas he ki bacchon kaa prakritik or saamaajik sansar hota he, jisamen unka aapasi sambandh shaamil hai, jo unhen yah samajhaata he ki chijen aisi kyon he, inke kaarnon or prabhaavon ke bich sambandh or nirnay tathaa kaary karne ke aadhaar kya he
 Thus, emotions, emotions and values are inseparable parts of cognitive development and are associated with the development of language, mental performance, conceptualization and reasoning
 jaise-jaise bachche kii bhautik avabodhtmak kshamtaayen viksit hoti hai ve apni manyataon ke bare main or adhik sajag ho jate hai tathaa unki apane adhigam ko niyaman karne main sakasham banate hai
 National Curriculum Framework - In 2005 reforms of examination were proposed as follows- uparokt ke kram main ensiiarti dwaara 2006 main prastut ‘‘pariksha sudhaar’’ par sthiti patr ke anusaar - cbse's efforts to provide a leadership and leading role in the implementation of direct, continuous and comprehensive evaluation are a major step, which seeks to bring the status of schools as equivalent partners of the Board, which are issued separately by the schools under Board instructions
 Determine student's attainment levels for public use through an independent certificate Not
 aisi anek ruparekhaayen hai jo bachche ke shaikshik tathaa sah-shaikshik prakshetron sahit uske chahunmukhi vikaas kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek sarthak kaaryakari ruparekha taiyaar karne ke liye sanderbhit kii ja sakati hai
 The goal of education is to enable children to become responsible, productive and useful members in society
 adhigam anubhavon dwaara gyaan kaushalon or manovritiyon kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he tathaa vidhyalay main chaatro ke liye avasar paidaa kiye jate hai
 In the classroom, students can analyze and evaluate their experiences, learn to doubt, ask questions, investigate, and think independently
 ek paathyacharya kaa arth he - samgr lakshyon, paathyakram, samagriyon, vidhiyon or nirdhaaran ko milajula kar sampurna adhyaapan - adhigam kaarykram bananaa
 In short, it provides a framework of knowledge and abilities, which is considered appropriate at a particular level
 paathyakram se prayojan, arthon or maanakon kaa ek vivaran miltaa he, jisaki tulana main vyakti kaarykram kii prabhaavashiltaa or chaatro dwaara kii gai pragati kii jaanch kar saktaa he
 The assessment not only measures the progress and achievement of the students, but also assesses the effectiveness of teaching materials and methods used in the transaction
 atah moolyankan ko prabhavi aapurti or adhyaapan-adhigam prakriya main sudhaar ke dohare prayojan ke saath paathyacharya ke ghatak ke rup main dekha janaa chahie

 One night, Shanidev appeared in a dream to Pandit Gopaldas and said that one of his idols is buried inside that mound
 shanidev ne pandit gopaldaas ko tila khodakar pratimaa baahar nikaalane kaa aadesh diya
 When Pandit Gopaldas told him that he was unable to do this work due to being blind, Shani Dev said to him - 'open your eyes, now you will be able to see everything
 ' Opening his eyes, Pandit Gopaldas found that his blindness had gone away and that he could see everything clearly
 drushti paane ke baad panditji ne tile ko khodna shuru kiya
 Due to his eyes being corrected, other people also got convinced about his dream and they started helping him in digging

 cabinet, pradhanmantri dwaara chaynit or raashtrapati dwaara niyukt mantriyon se bana hota he
 The Constitution of India does not specify any special qualifications for the post of Prime Minister
 parantu ek aavashyakta zarur nirdhaarit kii gai he: pradhanmantri ke paas loksabhaa athwa rajyasabha kii sadsyta honi chahie, or unke paas loksabhaa main bahumat kaa samarthan hona chaiye
 If at the time of appointment, the eligible person is not a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament, then it is mandatory for him to get the membership of Parliament within 6 months of the appointment otherwise his prime ministership will be rejected
 atah pradhanmantritv ke daavedaar ke paas, ek saansad hone kii sari arhataayen hona chaiye
 The 84th Article of the Fifth Part of the Indian Constitution specifies the qualifications of an MP, according to: koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sthaan ko bharne ke liye chune jane ke liye arhit tabhi hoga jab— As specified in the third point, the eligible will have to live up to any eligibility of eligibility passed by the Parliament in future and since the Prime Minister is mandatory to be an MP, the Prime Minister's eligible to be eligible to be a member of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, some other Qualifications also have to be met, including a person with a distorted character or not being declared insolvent, voluntarily

 pad par niyukti hetu, bhavi padaadhikari ko do shapath lene kii anivaaryta he

 Therefore, a sitting Prime Minister can remain on the Prime Minister indefinitely, provided that the President has "confidence" in him
 iskaa vaastavik arth yah he kii ek vyakti keval tab tak pradhanmantri pad par bana rah saktaa he, jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat kaa vishwash uske paksh main he
 However, the full term of the Lok Sabha is 5 years, after which new elections are held, and the new assembly again passes a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, if the newly elected assembly declares a distrust in the Prime Minister, then the term of the Prime Minister ends

 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri kaa ek puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh kaa hota he, jiske baad uski punahsamiksha hoti he
 However, the term of the Prime Minister can be terminated before 5 years, if due to any reason, pass a no-confidence vote against the Lok Sabha Government or if for any reason, the Prime Minister's membership of the Parliament is declared void, the Prime Minister may, at any time, The resignation of office can be done by handing over a written resignation to the President

 raashtrapati mantrigan kii niyukti uski salaah se hi karte hai
 The Department of Minister's Department also determines the same
 cabinet ke kaary kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 He also gives instructions to the administration of the country

 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global

 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language
 angreji bhashaa kaa kaam chalau gyaan anek kshetron, jaise kii chikitsa or computer, ke liye ek aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he; parinamswaroop ek arab se zyada log kam se kam buniyadi str kii angreji bol lete hai 
 yah sanyukt rashtraki chah aadhikarik bhashaaon main se bhi ek he
 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the
 Bead has written that his entire country, except his old land, had come to Britain
 'england' or 'english ' naam is janajati ke naam se hi praapt hue hai
 Anglo Saxons began invading Denmark and Jutland in 449 AD, before their arrival the locals of England spoke Brythonic, a Celtic language
 haalaanki boli main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parivartan 1066 ke norman akraman ke pashchaat hi aaye, parantu bhashaa ne apane naam ko banaaye rakhaa or norman akraman purv kii boli ko ab puraani angreji kaha jaataa he
 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui
 pehla jarmenic parivaar ke uttari jarmenic shakha ke bhashaa bolne waalon dwaara tha; unhone 8 veen or 9 veen sadi main british dwipon ke kuch hisson ko jitkar upnivesh bana diya
 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date
 san 500 se lekar 1100 tak ke kaal ko puraani angrezi kaa daur kaha jaataa he
 In 1066, the Duke of Normandy invaded England and conquered the anglo-saxon tribes here

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English
 kaanoon or aparaadh-dand se sambandh rakhane vaale bahut se angrezi shabd isi kaal main prachlit hue
 Chaucer's poetry in English literature is said to be an important example of this language

 Spelling simplicity and simple and easy to speak style are characteristic of American English
 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he
 for example: yah bhi It can also be used to express emotion: newclear shabdaanshon ko zyada unche swar main bolaa jaataa he or inako bolne ke lahaze main ek vishisht badlaav hota he

 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai

 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 uccharan ko spasht karne ke liye kuch udhaar shabd dyacritic kaa upyog kar sakate hai, haalaanki mul shabd main yah maujuud nahin tha
 Eg, maté, from Spanish yerba mate) duniya bhar ke shikshit angreji vaktaaon dwaara lagbhag saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut bhashaa ke ek sanskaran ko aupchaarik likhit angreji kaha jaataa he
 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions
 bhashaa ke aupchaarik likhit sanskaran main sthaneey bhinnataayen kaaphi simit hai
 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa
 apane shabdon ke samooh par usne badi sankhya main pareekshan or sudhaar kiye
 usne na sirf vyakaran ko saral banaaya, varan upyogkartaaon ke liye vyakaran ko saamaanya rakhane kii bhi koshish kii
 Soon after the Second World War, it received a lot of publicity as a tool for world peace
 Although it was not converted into a program, other similar versions were created for various international uses
 ek anya sanskaran, sarlikrut angreji, maujuud he jo kii ek niyantrit bhashaa he jiskaa gathan mul rup se airospes udyog ke rakrakhaav minial ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It provides a limited and standardized subgroup of English
 sarlikrut angreji main anumodith shabdon kaa ek shabdkosh he or un shabdon ko kuch vishisht myanon main hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the word close may be used in the phrase "close the door" but "do not go close to the landing gear"
 angrezon ne duniya ke anek deshon ko raajnneetik rup se apana upnivesh banaaya
 Along with this, they also imposed English cleverly on those countries
 isi kaa parinaam he ki aaj britain ke baahar san raa america, austrailia, newjiland, canada, bharat, pakistan, bangladesh, dakshin africa aadi anek deshon main angrezi kaa varchasv he
 English has severely paralyzed the native languages here
 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 sherni thi bharat kii betiyaan, bela or kalyani ne gauri ke kaaji ko gazani main buree maut maaraa tha 4 kya aap jaanate he,naradham narpishaach jehadi gori bharat se prithviraj chouhan kii beti bela or jayachand kii pautri kalyani ko uthaakar gazani le gaya tha In fact, when Naradham Jehadi Ghori spread jihad in our Hindustan and plundered when he went to his homeland, he had taken along with him many Hindu girls and women as well as Bela and Kalyani! Actually Bela Hindu Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan's daughter and Kalyani was the grand daughter of Jaichand! It is to be noted that while Prithviraj Chauhan was a great patriot, Jaichand betrayed the country but, The granddaughter Kalyani was a great patriot
 khayr jab wo jehadi gori apane gazani pahunchaa to uske guru ne "kaaji nizamulk" ne uskaa bharpoor swaagat kiya or, usase kaha ki aao gauri aao hamen tum par naaj he ki tumne hindustan par fatah karke islam kaa naam roshan kiya he! Say how much gold birds have brought to India in Qatar! 'is par jehadi gori ne kutilata se muskuraate hue kaha ki 'kaaji sahab! main hindustan se sattar karod dirham mulya ke sone ke sikke, pachaas lakh chaar sau man sona or chaandi, iske atirikt moolyawaan aabhushanon, motiyon, hira, panna, jaridaar vastra or dhake kii mel-mel kii lut-khasot kar bharat se gazani kii seva main laayaa hum
 'kazi:' Very good! But did the people there teach some humble faith or not? 'ghori:' Many people have been converted to Islam
 ' Qazi: 'and what have the detainees done?' Ghori: 'the detainees have been brought as slaves to Ghazni and, now the detainees are being sold in public in Ghazni
 raunanahar, iraq, khurasaan aadi deshon ke vyapaaree gazani se gulaamon ko kharidkar le ja rahe hai
 Each slave is sold for two or two or three dirhams
 'kaaji : 'hindustan ke mandiron kaa kya kiya?'gori : 'mandiron ko lootakar 17000 hajaar sone or chaandi kii murtiyon laayi gayi hai, do hajaar se adhik keemtee pattharon kii murtiyon or shivlinga bhi laae gayi hai or bahut se puja sthalon ko neptha or aag se jalaakar jamidoj kar diya gaya he
 Qazi 

 'you have done a lot of mercy!' Then grumbled with a dull smile 'all Indians have become united in the context of white and black rich and poor slaves
 jo bharat main pratishthit samajhe jate the, aaj ve gazani main maamuli dukandaaron ke gulam bane hue hai
 'then he paused a little and said:' But have you brought any special gift for us or not? 'ghori:' Laaya hoon na kaji sahib! 'kaaji :'kya!'gori :'jananath kii huuron se bhi sundar jayachand kii pautri kalyani or prithviraj chouhan kii putree bela
 'kazi:' Then what is the delay? 'gori :'bas aapke ishaare bhar kii
 'kazi:' Masha Allah! Do not feed today, new flowers in our harem 'gori :'insha allaah! 'and then, soon after getting Kazi's permission, Shahabuddin Gauri took Kalyani and Bela to the Kazi's harem
 jahaan kalyani or bela kii adbhut sundarataa ko dekhakar kaaji achambhe main aa gaya or, use laga ki swarg se apsaraayein aa gayi hai
 And, when that Qazi proposed marriage to both the princesses, Bela said - 'kaji sir! It will be our luck to be in your company, but we have two conditions
 'kazi:' Say 

 what are your conditions! tum jaisi huuron ke liye to main koi bhi shart maanane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Bella: 'the first condition is that we should not be profaned till we get married
 Do you approve?' Kazi: 'we accept! Explain the second condition
 'bela : 'hamaare yahaan pratha he ki ladki ke liye ladkaa or ladke liye ladki ke yahaan se vivaah ke kapade aate hai
 So, we want to get the bridegroom's couple and the couple's money from India land
 'kaaji :'mujhe tumhaari donon sharten manjuur hai
 'and then Bela and Kalyani, after writing a mysterious letter to Kavichand, got the wedding couple from India land and, with the Qazi their wedding day was fixed, as well, marriage preparations started in the new palace built on the banks of Lake Rahmat
 Hui
 nikaah ke din wo naradham kaaji kavi chand dwaara bheje gayi kapade pahanakar kaaji sahab vivaah mandap main aayaa or, kalyani or bela ne bhi kaaji dwaara diye gayi kapade pahan rakhe the
 Everyone was so anxious about this marriage that a crowd of people had gathered outside to see the wedding
 lekin tabhi bela ne kaaji sahab se kaha-'hamaare hone vaale sartaaj, ham kalma or nikaah padhane se pehle janata ko jharokhe se darshan dena chaahati hai, kyonki vivaah se pehle janata ko darshan dene kii hamaare yahaan pratha he or ,phir gazani waalon ko bhi to pataa chale ki aap budhaape main jananath kii sabase sundar huuron se shaadi rachaa rahe hai
 And, after marriage, we have to wear a burqa for life, then our beauty will be negligible because what is the beauty hidden in the mask? 'haa

haa kyon nahin
 'kazi replied and went with Kalyani and Bella to the palace of Rajmahal, but upon reaching there, that "" Naradham Jehadi "" started flames from Kazi's right shoulder, because Kavichand gave the mystery of Bela and Kalyani
 Considering the letter, he had sent clothes soaked in very sharp venom
 is tarah wo ""naradham jehadi"" kaaji vish kii jwaala se paaglon kii tarah idhar-udhar bhaagane laga,tab bela ne usase kaha-'tumne hi gauri ko bharat par akraman karne ke liye uksaaya tha naa isiilie ,hamane tuje maarane kaa shadyantr rachakar apane desh ko luutane kaa badla le liya he
 We are Hindu Kumaris and, there is not so much courage in any Naradham that even when we live, we can touch our body
 'kalyani ne kaha, 'nalayak! bahut majahabi banate ho, or jehad kaa dhol peetane ke naam par logon ko lutate ho or shanti se rahane vaale logon par julm dhahte ho,thu!dhikkaar he tum par
 'saying this, both of them stood on the very edge of the roof of the palace and stole the poisonous dagger in each other's chest and their soulless body rolled down from that high ceiling
 vahi duusari taraf us vish ke prabhaav se ""naradham jehadi"" kaaji paaglon kii tarah idhar-udhar bhaagta hua bhi tadap-tadap kute kii maut mar gaya
 In this way, the saga of which these two brave Sanatani daughters of India made sacrifices even when they were under foreign soil is praiseworthy and, today, the whole of India remembers the sacrifice of these daughters with reverence

 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i

 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili

 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui
